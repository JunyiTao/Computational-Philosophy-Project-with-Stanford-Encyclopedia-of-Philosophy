    "main_text": "Major Arguments from the Treasury of the Abhidharma || Disproof of Invisible Physicality\n2.3 Disproof of Invisible Physicality\n\nIn a complex but significant passage from the Treasury of the\nAbhidharma, Vasubandhu provides refutations to arguments that\ndefend the necessity of there being a special kind of physicality,\ncalled \u201cunperceived physicality,\u201d or \u201cinvisible\nphysicality,\u201d\n (avij\u00f1aptir\u016bpa).[27]\n As is made clear throughout these arguments, this entity\n(dharma) was affirmed by the Kashmiri Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas\nin order to account for the karmic effects of our physical and vocal\nactions.\n\nThe need for such an entity reflects a conundrum unique to Buddhist\nmorality, premised as it is upon the lawlike, causal regularity of\nkarma operating in the absence of any divine intervention. The issue\nat hand is not in itself the question of karmic continuity in the\nabsence of a self, but rather a particular aspect of that larger\nproblem. (See the sections concerning disproof of the self and\nmomentariness and continuity.) For this argument, then, let us agree\nthat the continuum of consciousness carries on after death, and that\none\u2019s future rebirth is therefore determined by the shape and\ncharacter of one\u2019s consciousness at death. Given that, we can\nsee how a mental action\u2014say, holding a wrong view, or slandering\nthe Buddha in one\u2019s thoughts\u2014can have consequences for\none\u2019s future, by directly affecting the shape of one\u2019s\nconsciousness. But how do actions of speech and body\u2014such as\ninsulting, or hitting someone\u2014bear their karmic fruit in the\nmental continuum? Surely forming the intention to hit someone is a\nconsequential mental act. We might think that Buddhists would simply\nsay that it is karmically equivalent, then, to intend to do\nsomething (which is a mental act) and to actually do it.\nAlthough there is some blurring of the line here (the Buddha does give\ngreat moral weight to merely intending to act), intentions and the\nbodily (or vocal) acts that follow from them are understood as\ndistinct types of actions with distinct karmic results. Furthermore,\nthe Buddha is said to have indicated that the karmic effect\u2014and\nso the moral significance\u2014of doing something is\nadditionally dependent upon the success of the action.\nAttempted murder is not punished to the same degree as murder, even\nkarmically.\n\nThese distinctions accord with widely held moral instincts, but the\nAbhidharma philosophers needed a full, causal explanation for why the\nsuccessful results of physical actions bring about their distinctive\neffects in one\u2019s consciousness. I can see how my plunging a\nknife into someone affects him; but how his dying (which may\nhappen later, in the hospital) affects me is invisible, or\nuncognized. How does what goes around, come around? The\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika answer is that, since his death is a physical\nevent, there must be another physical event\u2014the invisible\nphysicality\u2014which impinges upon me.\n\nVasubandhu rejects this entity, and provides a compelling explanation\nof the Buddha\u2019s differentiation between intentions, acts, and\nsuccess that does not need to appeal to invisible physicality.\nAlthough here Vasubandhu answers through the mouth of another (and so,\npresents this position without explicitly endorsing it), he advocates\nsomething like this position more forcefully in his later,\nExplanation of the Establishment of\n Action.[28]\n He admits that there must be a karmic difference between (1) merely\nintending, (2) intending and acting, and (3) intending, acting and\naccomplishing the deed. But the difference does not come from the\naccomplishment of the result itself\u2014that is, it does not come\nfrom the death of the murder victim. Rather, the karmic effect is the\nresult of my experience and my beliefs. If I experience myself\nstabbing someone, and I know that the person died (even if by\nreading the newspaper the next day), I gain a fuller karmic result\nthan I would have by simply intending to act.\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas present a number of other arguments that\nsuggest the necessity of invisible physicality, all of which follow a\nsimilar logic. A close parallel to the example above is a murder by\nproxy; why do I experience a karmic result if the hit man I\u2019ve\nhired does his job, but not if he doesn\u2019t? My action was the\nsame either way. The Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas also point to the\nenduring, karmic benefits of having taken vows to refrain from\nnegative actions such as killing or stealing. These vows generate a\nkarmic benefit in spite of their being fulfilled through not acting.\nHow is this non-action different from that of someone who\njust happens not to be killing or stealing? Another\nargument suggests that advanced practitioners in refined meditative\nstates cannot be said to be practicing the eight-fold path of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings, since it includes \u201cright\nspeech,\u201d \u201cright action\u201d and \u201cright\nlivelihood\u201d\u2014but no action at all can be taken while in\nmeditative equipoise. Finally, another argument points out that a\ndonor gains great karmic merit when (obviously, later) the monk who\nreceives and eats her gift of food uses its energy to attain a great\nmeditative accomplishment.\n\nSuch arguments draw upon numerous scriptures to indicate that morally\nsignificant effects seem to take place in the world even when physical\nactions are no longer possible or relevant. In each case, Vasubandhu\nreinterprets the scripture, or the situation, or both, in such a way\nas to make it sensible to describe the effect without appealing to\ninvisible physicality. In the case of the vow, Vasubandhu says that a\nvow helps a vow-taker to remember not to do immoral deeds, and the\ndisciplinary vows of monks have the effect of transforming the whole\ncharacter of the mind. Therefore a disciplined vow-taker does not act\nwithout the thought of the vow arising. The vow does not cause a\nmagical imprint on some invisible entity; it transforms the\ndispositions of the vow-taker. The same is true of the meditating\npractitioner; there is no lack of \u201cright action\u201d during\nmeditation, because the meditator\u2019s continuum of aggregates is\nstill disposed to act properly after the meditation session\nis complete. Such arguments exhibit Vasubandhu\u2019s general pattern\nof reducing apparent continuities to causal chains of momentary\nevents, and eliminating as many extraneous elements from the system as\npossible.\n",
