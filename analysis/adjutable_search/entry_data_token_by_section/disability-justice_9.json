    "main_text": "Justice, Disability Identities, and Epistemic Injustice\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry began by pointing out a feature of disability that\ndistinguishes it from other characteristics which have often been seen\nas grounding legitimate claims of justice, such as race, sex, sexual\nand gender identity, and religion. Simply put, achieving full\ninclusion for people with disabilities is expensive to a\ndegree that achieving full inclusion for other minorities is not. Any\nplausible theory of inclusion implies the necessity of considerable\naccommodation and environmental reconstruction. And even if the costs\nof such measures have often been exaggerated, it is difficult to see\nhow the appropriate degree of accommodation and reconstruction would\nnot require diverting significant amounts of resources from other\nworthy goals, including some goals which are supported by\ncountervailing considerations of justice. One implication of this\nfeature of disability is that disability requires us to directly\ncompare, and perhaps trade off, values of relational justice, which\nground the demand for full inclusion as part of a society of equals,\nand values of distributive justice, which ground the demand for a fair\ndistribution of scarce resources. \n\nHaving made this general point, the entry proceeded to discuss\ndifferent models of disability, which differ principally in their\nunderstanding of the relationship between impairment and limitation.\nWhereas the medical model of disability tends to attribute most of the\nlimitations associated with disability to functional aspects of the\nrelevant impairments, the social model of disability emphasizes the\nmediating role of the social environment\u2014broadly understood to\ninclude the configuration of physical space, the availability of\nvarious forms of accommodation, social practices and norms,\netc.\u2014in generating disability-related disadvantage. Among other\nthings, the social model highlights the relational aspects of\ndisability-related disadvantage, such as stigma, invisibility, and\nexclusion, whereas the medical model lends itself to a narrow\ndistributive interpretation of the claims of justice generated by\ndisability.\n\nIn subsequent sections, the entry focused on the role of disability in\ncontractualist and other distributive theories of justice. Disability\nhas often been regarded as a \u201climit case\u201d for\ncontractualist theories of justice, and more specifically for the\nidealizing assumptions these theories make about the capacities of\nthose who choose and those who are governed by contractualist\nprinciples of justice. We also saw that disability has played a\ncentral role in discussions of outcome-oriented, distributive theories\nof justice, in particular luck egalitarianism. Internally, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the\n\u201ccurrency\u201d of justice, since it has often been seen as a\nparadigm example of unchosen disadvantage. Externally, disability has\nplayed a central role in relational criticisms of luck egalitarian\ntheories of justice. At best, these theories have been seen as failing\nto attribute normative significance to morally relevant differences\nbetween identical patterns of distribution which differ in the causal\ncontribution of the social environment. At worst, these theories have\nbeen criticized for expressing disrespect towards people with\ndisabilities in virtue of characterizing them as \u201cmere\u201d\nunfortunates or objects of pity. Although some of these criticisms may\nbe overstated, they have been taken to heart by many theorists of\ndistributive justice, especially proponents of the capabilities\napproach. Finally, the entry concluded by pointing to a topic which\nhas received far less attention in discussions of disability and\njustice: namely, the normative significance of disability as a form of\nsocial identity, and the connections between disability and epistemic\ninjustice.\n\nThis entry raises a number of questions which would benefit from\nfurther exploration. Clearly, one general question is how exactly to\nunderstand the distinction between distributive and relational values\nof justice. Another, related question is how to assess the comparative\nweight or importance of these values. And if, as many find plausible,\nsome form of pluralism about justice is the correct answer, then we\nwill need to work out how the relevant trade-offs, weights, and so on\napply to the special case of disability, which simultaneously raises\nboth distributive and relational concerns. A third question which\ncalls for further research is the link between disability and\nepistemic injustice. We briefly discussed two examples of testimonial\nand hermeneutical injustice concerning people with disabilities, but\nthere are\u2014needless to say\u2014many more. Indeed, disability\nmay be an especially powerful example of epistemic injustice precisely\nbecause the phenomenological experiences of people with disabilities,\nespecially those with sensory impairments, differ considerably\nfrom the experiences of the able-bodied majority, raising the hard\nquestion of how well we must understand others in order to treat them\nas justice requires.\n",
