    "main_text": "Determinism and Free Will\n4. Conclusions\n\nPolqar\u2019s project is threefold. Firstly, he seeks to defend\nJudaism as a true religion against Christianity. For Polqar, true\nreligion coincides with philosophical principles. His defense of\nJudaism against the Christian convert Abner of Burgos essentially\nconsists of the claim that while Judaism coincides with true\nphilosophy and hence is a true religion, Christianity contains\ndoctrines such as the Trinity and the Incarnation that contradict true\nphilosophy and hence is not a true religion. In addition to his\ncritique of Christianity, Polqar uses hermeneutical arguments to\nreinforce his position that Judaism is a true religion. Secondly,\nPolqar, similarly to his fellow Jewish Averroists, wishes to defend\nthe discipline of philosophy. By philosophy, Polqar means\nAverroes\u2019 interpretation of Aristotle. As a consequence, he\noffers an Averroistic interpretation of Judaism and becomes one of the\nmain representatives of Jewish Averroism. His Averroistic commitments\nalso determine his interpretation of Maimonides: his preference for\nMaimonides\u2019 radical views over his harmonizing views, as well as\nhis occasional deviation from Maimonides. Polqar\u2019s third aim is\nto defend his philosophical interpretation of Judaism. From a social\nand political point of view, Polqar\u2019s unreserved embrace of\nphilosophy raised problems within the Jewish community: he had to\nrefute the Jewish traditionalists\u2019 charge that he was a heretic,\nled astray by philosophy, to avoid weakening a community already under\nconsiderable pressure in its Christian environment through internal\nconflict stemming from views perceived as unorthodox. This explains\nhis use of an \u201cesoteric\u201d writing practice through which he\nconceals some of his more radical views from the non-philosophers\namong his readers. This strategy is explicitly highlighted in the\nintroduction to \u02bfEzer ha-Dat, where he declares that due\nto political and social circumstances he must conceal his genuine\nopinion in order to avoid being accused of heresy by those who are\nincapable of understanding his philosophical approach. Polqar\u2019s\nidentification of Judaism and true philosophy, moreover, requires a\nclarification of the difference between true science and\npseudo-science (for example, astrology and divination), and between\ncorrect and incorrect interpretations of Judaism (among the latter,\nfor example, those of the Kabbalists). The major claim guiding my\ninterpretation is that Polqar advances a systematic naturalistic\ninterpretation of Judaism, which in many cases does not agree with\ntraditional Jewish views.\n\nPolqar\u2019s philosophy should thus be seen as part of the Jewish\nAverroist school and as one of several attempts made by\npost-Maimonidean Jewish thinkers to use Maimonides\u2019 ideas and\nmethods to bring the Aristotelian philosophy taught by Averroes and\nthe principles of the Jewish faith more closely together.\n",
