For instance, when one searches for the\nright word, one is guided by content that is not yet symbolised. Also,\nthinking in time using a succession of symbols \u201coverflows [the]\nsymbols\u201d (1953a: 309) and never involves the whole\nsymbol-conveyed thought present at any time\u2014the succession must\nbe guided by something already there in full (1953a:\n309\u2013311).\n\nThe extra features of thought missing from symbol-presented content,\nPrice argues (1953a: 302), are not captured by the so-called classical\ntheory of many ancients and earlier moderns such as Locke and Kant, on\nwhich thinking is \u201cthe awareness or inspection of intelligible\nobjects\u2014universals, or concepts, or abstract ideas, or \u2026.\nSubsistent propositions\u201d (1953a: 302). In short, there is no\nphenomenological evidence for this when one is thinking.\n\nThe key is the right view of concepts. In brief, Price\u2019s\napproach is \u201ca dispositional version of Conceptualism\u201d\n(1953a: 353), on which we talk of concept-manifestation in situations\nwhere certain dispositions are present or actualised or partly\nactualised. According to Price, then, concepts are neither the images\none encounters in thinking nor the objects of thinking which we\nintrospectively grasp in thinking. Rather, they are the dispositions\n(i) to recognise instances of the universals which on other accounts\nare equated with the concept itself or (ii) to recognise recurring\nresemblances.\n\nA very thorough and fair critical discussion of Price\u2019s theory\nof recognition and related issues is given in Broad 1954. Other\ncritical but largely sympathetic discussions include L.W. Beck 1953;\nFindlay 1954; Malcolm 1954; L. 1954; Brandt 1954; Mundle 1954;\nButchvarov 1979: 42, 79, 147, 258.\n",
