    "main_text": "The Offense Principle and Free Speech || Hate Speech and the Offense Principle\n3.3 Hate Speech and the Offense Principle\n\nHate speech causes profound offense. The discomfort caused to the\ntargets of such attacks cannot be shrugged off easily. As with violent\npornography, the offense that is caused by the march through Skokie\ncannot be avoided simply by staying off the streets because offense is\ntaken over the bare knowledge that the march is taking place. As we\nhave seen, however, bare knowledge does not seem sufficient grounds\nfor prohibition. But in respect to some of the other factors regarding\noffensive speech mentioned above, Feinberg suggests that the march\nthrough Skokie does not do very well: the social value of the speech\nseems to be marginal, the number of people offended will be large, and\nit is difficult to see how it is in the interests of the community.\nThese reasons also hold for violent pornography which Feinberg\nsuggests should not be prohibited for reasons of offense.\n\nA key difference, however, is the intensity of the offense; it is\nparticularly acute with hate speech because it is aimed at a\nrelatively small and specific audience. The motivations of the\nspeakers in the Skokie example seemed to be to incite fear and hatred\nand to directly insult members of the community through the use of\nNazi symbols. Nor, according to Feinberg, was there any political\ncontent to the speech. The distinction between violent pornography and\nthe Skokie example of hate speech is that a particular group of people\nwere targeted and the message of hate was paraded in such a way that\nit could not be easily avoided. It is for these reasons that Feinberg\nsuggests hate speech can be limited by the offense principle.\n\nHe also claims that when fighting words are used to provoke people who\nare prevented by law from using a fighting response, the offense is\nprofound enough to allow for prohibition. If pornographers engaged in\nthe same behaviour and paraded through neighborhoods where they were\nlikely to meet great resistance and cause profound offense, they too\nshould be prevented from doing so. It is clear, therefore, that the\ncrucial component of the offense principle is whether the offense can\nbe avoided. Feinberg's principle means that many forms of hate speech\nwill still be allowed if the offense is easily avoidable. It still\nallows Nazis to meet in private places, or even in public ones that\nare easily bypassed. Advertisements for such meetings can be edited\n(because they are less easy to avoid) but should not be banned. It\nseems Feinberg thinks that hate speech does not, in and of itself,\ncause direct harm to the rights of the targeted group (he is not\nclaiming that offence equals harm) and he would be troubled by some of\nthe prohibitions on speech in the U.K. and Australia.\n",
