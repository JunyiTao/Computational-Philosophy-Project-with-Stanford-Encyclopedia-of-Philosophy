    "main_text": "A History of the Gene Within the History of Genetics || Molecular biology: DNA technology, development, and evolution\n1.4 Molecular biology: DNA technology, development, and evolution\n\nMolecular technologies and concepts inevitably had a transforming\ninfluence on other fields. Indeed, it might be argued, that while\nmolecular genetics constituted a discipline centered on a limited\nnumber of questions regarding the molecular basis of heredity,\nmolecular biology is best understood as a set of techniques and\napproaches that came to be applied in various disciplines (Burian\n1993).\n\nIn the classical period of molecular genetics, many central mechanisms\npertaining to DNA replication, gene regulation, and protein synthesis\nwere described. While DNA served as a template in its own replication,\nit was not self-replicating or autocatalytic; many enzymes and other\nmolecules were required in this process, such as DNA polymerase and\nDNA ligase. Furthermore, around 1970, several enzymes specific for\nbacteria or viruses were described such as reverse transcriptase,\nwhich enabled viruses to translate RNA into DNA, and restriction\nenzymes, which cleaved DNA as part of a bacterial defense system. Next\nto explaining important cellular processes, taken together, these\nenzymes could be used as a toolkit to manipulate DNA in\nvitro, in bacterial systems and eventually also in eukaryotic\ncells. In 1972, Paul Berg (born 1926) and colleagues published a study\ndemonstrating the possibility to construct DNA molecules from\nfragments originating from different organisms by using these enzymes\nas tools (Jackson et al. 1972). These molecular tools not only led to\nrecombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering, but also\nfacilitated the further molecular characterization of genes by\nisolating and amplifying them in bacteria (molecular cloning) (Morange\n2020: Ch. 16).\n\nMolecular technologies changed the way research was done in molecular\nbiology. In vitro systems that helped among other things to\nsolve the genetic code, were complemented by new methods of in\nvivo manipulation and detection (Rheinberger 2009). This in turn\nled to the discovery of new cellular mechanisms involved in the\ntranscription and translation of genes. For instance, it had been\nobserved in virus-based model systems that in some cases mRNA\ncorresponded to non-contiguous fragments of the DNA from which it was\ntranscribed. Further studies revealed that in these cases parts of the\ninitial transcript were removed to form the mature mRNA that was\neventually translated and the segments that were removed could\nseparate coding regions. Much to the surprise of biologists, this was\nthe case for all genes in eukaryotic cells, while the mechanism was\nabsent in prokaryotes (Abir-Am 2020; Morange 2020: Ch. 17).\n\u201cSplit genes\u201d and the mechanism of RNA splicing led to an\nimportant reconception of genes. As Walter Gilbert (born 1932)\nwrote:\n\n\nThe notion of the cistron, the genetic unit of function that one\nthought corresponded to a polypeptide chain, now must be replaced by\nthat of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost\nfrom the mature messenger which I suggest we call introns (for\nintragenic regions)\u2014alternating with regions which will be\nexpressed\u2014exons. (W. Gilbert 1978: 501)\n\n\nGilbert\u2019s terminology was widely accepted and it became clear\nthat exons could be spliced together in alternative ways, thus\nmultiplying the number of proteins that could be derived from a\nstretch of DNA. During the 1970s and 80s, further mechanisms of RNA\nprocessing were discovered in various organisms. For instance, mRNA\ncould be generated by splicing together exons from several\ntranscripts, from either the same or adjacent loci or even from\ndifferent chromosomes (\u201ctrans-splicing\u201d). Furthermore, RNA\ncould be edited by changing several or single nucleotides, which could\nhave large effects on the proteins translated from the mRNA. Mobile\nelements in the genome (transposons), already characterized by Barbara\nMcClintock (1902\u20131992) in Maize in the early 1950s by classical\ngenetic means, were also studied in bacteria and molecularly\ncharacterized around 1980 (Comfort 2001). It was not always\nimmediately clear how general these and other mechanisms were (and it\nis still investigated). Nonetheless, it transpired that the notion\nthat one gene, understood as an unequivocally localized stretch of\nDNA, corresponded to one polypeptide, had to be abandoned (Fogle 2000;\nPortin 2002).\n\nAnother important development concerned gene regulation. Studying the\nability of bacteria to adapt to varying food sources, Fran\u00e7ois\nJacob (1920\u20132013) and Jacques Monod (1910\u20131976) developed\nthe operon model, according to which a protein called\n\u201crepressor\u201d is permanently produced, which binds to a DNA\nregion called \u201coperator\u201d in the vicinity of the genes\nrequired for lactose metabolism, thereby inhibiting the production of\nthe respective enzymes and other proteins. If lactose was present, it\n(or a derivate) interacts with the repressor such that the genes are\nactivated, and lactose could be digested by the bacteria. This model\nintroduced an important distinction regarding genes. Those genes that\ncoded for \u03b2-galactosidase or lactose permease or other proteins\nconstituting cellular functions were called \u201cstructural\ngenes\u201d. The genes that produced the repressor and other proteins\ncontrolling the expression of genes were called \u201cregulatory\ngenes\u201d (Jacob & Monod 1961).\n\nThis kind of mechanism was immediately interpreted as providing\nanswers to the question how different genes become activated at\ndifferent times and in different tissues during metazoan development\n(differential gene expression). Between the 1950s and the 1980s the\nconcept of specific developmental genes emerged (Morange 2001: Ch. 7).\nDevelopmental biologists identified a limited number of genes that\nwere essential in establishing the organization of the very early\nembryo and functioned by controlling the expression of various other\ngenes. Molecular cloning led to the molecular characterization of\ndevelopmental genes and the discovery of their evolutionary\nconservation (Weber 2004, see also the entry on \n developmental biology).\n\nEvolutionary biology as well became molecularized\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2018). One important contribution was the\ntheory of the molecular clock, which stated that the rate of\nevolutionary change in a protein remained constant such that the time\nof divergence of lineages could be estimated from data on amino acid\nsequences (Morgan 1998). This lent support to and was explained by the\nneutral theory of molecular evolution suggested, which was\ncontroversially discussed between molecular and traditional biologists\nin the 1960s (Dietrich 1998; entries on\n ecological genetics\n and\n genetic drift).\n In general, molecular biology opened a new perspective on\nevolutionary mechanisms, for instance, the notion that evolution\nbuilds upon events of duplication of genes, chromosomes, or whole\ngenomes. On this view the duplicated elements could acquire new\nfunctions or alter the dosage of gene products (Morange 2020, Ch.\n23).\n",
