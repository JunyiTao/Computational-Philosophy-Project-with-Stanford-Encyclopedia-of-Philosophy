More generally, it allows him to indicate an\nimportant source of meaning in addition to denotation. Most works of\nmusic, dance, and architecture, as well as abstract paintings, do not\nrepresent anything at all. Yet, Goodman can show how, next to\nartworks\u2019 representational powers we must recognize, as a\ncentral and pervasive form of symbolization in art, the capacity for\nartworks to call attention to some of their features, that is, to\nexemplify them.\n\nAs for the features that an artwork appears to exemplify despite its\nnot, literally, possessing them (as when, for instance, a painting is\nclaimed to express sadness in spite of the fact that paintings cannot\nliterally be sad) Goodman claims that such features are\nmetaphorically exemplified, or expressed. In brief,\na work of art expresses something when it metaphorically exemplifies\nit. Accordingly, expression is not limited to feelings and emotions\nbut comprises any feature that can be metaphorically attributed to an\nartwork: in architecture, for instance, a building may express\nmovement, dynamism, or being \u201cjazzy\u201d although, literally,\nit can\u2019t have any of those properties (Goodman, Elgin 1988,\n40).\n\nTo expression and exemplification, too, the general rule for which the\nrelationship between a symbol and what it symbolizes is never\n\u201cabsolute, universal, or immutable\u201d (1976, 50) applies.\nHence, like representation, exemplification and expression are\nrelative, in particular they are relative to established use (Goodman\n1976, 48).\n\nGoodman\u2019s suggestions on the role of exemplification in art are\nin many ways enlightening. Applied to art, the notion seems to provide\nsemantic theories, like Goodman\u2019s, with a way to justify the\nattention we pay, not just to what an artwork symbolizes, by to the\nartwork itself: we do so because we are made privy of, and are\ninterested in, those of a work\u2019s features that are shown forth,\ni.e., exemplified (cf. van der Berg 2012, 603). The notion allows to\nexpand the number of features that are deemed significant in a work,\nwhile still explaining such significance in referential terms. A poem,\nfor instance, is not just a representational symbol; typically, what a\npoetic work exemplifies is as important to its meaning and artistic\nvalue as what the work represents. Accordingly, the goal of the\ntranslator must be \u201cmaximal preservation of what the original\nexemplifies as well as of what it says\u201d (1976, 60). As for\nexpression, expanding the scope of the properties that can be\nmetaphorically exemplified, beyond the strictly emotional ones, adds\nexplanatory power to the theory, making it possible to say, e.g., that\na sculpture expresses fluidity (cf. Robinson 2000, 216).\n\nAs is the case for Goodman\u2019s analysis of depiction, with regard\nto exemplification and expression in art, too, one wonders whether\nGoodman\u2019s claims are meant to provide an exhaustive account of\nsuch notions, and not rather just a very general, structural, analysis\nof them. Whichever the case, Goodman\u2019s proposal is much more\nacceptable at that general level. More specific claims, such as that\nexpression and exemplification are relative to the conventionally\nestablished symbol systems at work, like the analogous claim regarding\nrepresentation, prompt questions on the necessity, for Goodman, to\nrecognize naturalistic constraints on what can be exemplified, or\nexpressed, or represented by what. More importantly, when we examine\nspecific cases, it becomes unclear whether the distinction between\nexemplification in general and expression in particular has been well\ndrawn. Since, for Goodman, not only feelings and emotions can be\nexpressed but also such properties as color or sound pitch, one\nwonders what notion \u201cexpressing red,\u201d said of a non-red\nsymbol, amounts to: how different is it from the notion referred to by\n\u201cexpressing sadness\u201d said of something (a musical sonata)\nthat literally is not sad? Furthermore, as a more general concern on\nGoodman\u2019s project of accounting for the nature, interpretation,\nand values of artworks fully extensionalistically (i.e., just in terms\nonly of what they refer to), one wonders whether the role of property\npossession is not undermined by Goodman\u2019s insistence on\nwhat a work exemplifies. Certainly, works of art have significant\nfeatures that they simply possess, without also exemplifying them. A\nwork of art may have to be recognized as, e.g., calm just in the sense\nof having such feature (if needed, having it metaphorically), and such\nfeature be recognized as relevant to the work\u2019s nature and\nvalue\u2014as something that the beholder ought to\nperceive\u2014without it being the case that the work\nexemplifies or expresses calmness.\n\nBe as it may, it is certainly worth considering whether expression,\nhence exemplification, by requiring possession, requires possession\nthat precedes the item\u2019s acquiring exemplifying function. It\ncould be the case that endowing a work with an exemplification\nfunction could, at once, endow the work with the feature it\nexemplifies, a suggestion that seems especially apt to works of art\n(cf. van der Berg 2012). Whether something like that could be\nexplained, as Goodman would want it, with no reference to either the\nintentions of artists or, more generally, the context of artistic\nproduction remains to be seen. Certainly\u2014and the concern, here,\nis not just about expression, but about metaphorical reference and\nexemplification more generally\u2014the suspicion arises that\nGoodman\u2019s approach, in relying solely on the notion of symbol\nsystem to explain reference (i.e., to explain what a symbol refers to\nand how it does refer to it), ends up underanalyzing the key notions\nat play: exemplification, metaphorical reference, and, hence,\nexpression. Goodman\u2019s own understanding of symbol systems is\nthat they emerge when certain rules are codified. Yet, of course,\nartists may succeed, it seems, at securing reference and endowing\ntheir works with artistically relevant features within, and thanks to,\na specific context of production. Appeal to the rules of a system may\nnot be sufficient to explain how reference is indeed secured. That is,\nand going back to an issue mentioned above, the rules of a system may\nnever be granular enough to offer a full explanation of how a work of\nart exemplifies some of its features but not others, or is\nsuccessfully made to possess, metaphorically, features it\nexpresses.\n",
