    "main_text": "\n\nMexican philosophy has been influenced by a variety of traditions of\nthought, which have been combined and transformed to meet the specific\ndemands and circumstances of Mexican life. The result has been a rich\nand original tradition that is more than 500 years old and that,\ntogether with Peruvian philosophy, is the oldest of the Americas.\n\nAlthough Mexican philosophy has been concerned with every manner of\ntheoretical inquiry, it might be characterized by a particular concern\nwith ethical and political issues and the concrete consequences of\nphilosophical inquiry. The questions concerning human nature and the\nrelation between power and reason have been central to the development\nof Mexican philosophy, from early reflections on the justification of\nthe Spanish conquest to recent debates about democratic reform or the\nIndian insurgence in Chiapas. The critique of philosophical\neurocentrism is another central feature of Mexican philosophy.\n\nThe bibliography includes all the books and articles mentioned in this\narticle and a selection of secondary texts in English.\n",
