    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind || Token-identity theories\n3.2 Token-identity theories\n\nType-identity theory was largely, though not completely, abandoned\nwhen arguments from multiple realizability were put forward to show\nthat due to the fact that at least some mental kinds can be multiply\nrealized\u2014that is: instantiated in different physiological\nkinds\u2014an identification of mental with physiological kinds is\nimpossible. Still, this left space for token-identity theories,\naccording to which any mental kind is physically instantiated. The\nidentity is that of the objects or items that are of the two types or\nthat possess the two relevant properties, even though the types or\nproperties themselves are not identical; e.g., one and the same item\nmight have both mental and neural properties. The bearers of those\nproperties, i.e., the items falling under the types, are identical,\nbut the properties or types themselves are distinct. Token-identity\ntheory is still a reductionist position in that it opposes any form of\ninteractionist substance-dualism, substance-parallelism, and\nsubstance-epiphenomenalism. Even though it is not a very common term,\nin the literature, we sometimes find variants of the expression\n\u2018token reduction\u2019 (Cartwright 1999: 32ff.; Hooker 1981:\npart III; Bickle 1998: 223ff.).\n\nToken-identity theories perfectly match weak interpretations of theory\nreduction. If for reduction, bridge-laws that state correlations or\nmerely extensional relations are sufficient (Richardson 1979), or if\nbridge-laws are not laws in any robust sense, (Klein 2009; Dizadji\nBahmani et al. 2010) then token-identity may be sufficient for\nNagelian theory reduction.\n\nToken-identity theories also match theory-reduction according to\nSchaffner\u2019s and the New Wave reductionist\u2019s models. Within\nthese models, token-identity theories do not back up strong or\nperfectly smooth cases of reduction, but they nevertheless support\nreductions that are stronger than those that are merely extreme cases\nof replacement, not involving correction in any robust sense.\n",
