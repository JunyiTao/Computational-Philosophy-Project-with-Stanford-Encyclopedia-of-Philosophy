    "main_text": "Truth and language || Truth-bearers\n6.1 Truth-bearers\n\nThere have been many debates in the literature over what the primary\nbearers of truth are. Candidates typically include beliefs,\npropositions, sentences, and utterances. We have already seen in\nsection 1 that the classical debates on truth took this issue very\nseriously, and what sort of theory of truth was viable was often seen\nto depend on what the bearers of truth are.\n\nIn spite of the number of options under discussion, and the\nsignificance that has sometimes been placed on the choice, there is an\nimportant similarity between candidate truth-bearers. Consider the\nrole of truth-bearers in the correspondence theory, for instance. We\nhave seen versions of it which take beliefs, propositions, or\ninterpreted sentences to be the primary bearers of truth. But all of\nthem rely upon the idea that their truth-bearers are\nmeaningful, and are thereby able to say something about what\nthe world is like. (We might say that they are able to represent the\nworld, but that is to use \u2018represent\u2019 in a wider sense\nthan we saw in section 3.2. No assumptions about just what stands in\nrelations to what objects are required to see truth-bearers as\nmeaningful.) It is in virtue of being meaningful that truth-bearers\nare able to enter into correspondence relations. Truth-bearers are\nthings which meaningfully make claims about what the world is like,\nand are true or false depending on whether the facts in the world are\nas described.\n\nExactly the same point can be made for the anti-realist theories of\ntruth we saw in section 4.2, though with different accounts of how\ntruth-bearers are meaningful, and what the world contributes. Though\nit is somewhat more delicate, something similar can be said for\ncoherence theories, which usually take beliefs, or whole systems of\nbeliefs, as the primary truth-bearers. Though a coherence theory will\nhardly talk of beliefs representing the facts, it is crucial to the\ncoherence theory that beliefs are contentful beliefs of agents, and\nthat they can enter into coherence relations. Noting the complications\nin interpreting the genuine classical coherence theories, it appears\nfair to note that this requires truth-bearers to be meaningful,\nhowever the background metaphysics (presumably idealism) understands\nmeaning.\n\nThough Tarski works with sentences, the same can be said of his\ntheory. The sentences to which Tarski\u2019s theory applies are fully\ninterpreted, and so also are meaningful. They characterize the world\nas being some way or another, and this in turn determines whether they\nare true or false. Indeed, Tarski needs there to be a fact of the\nmatter about whether each sentence is true or false (abstracting away\nfrom context dependence), to ensure that the Tarski biconditionals do\ntheir job of fixing the extension of \u2018is true\u2019. (But note\nthat just what this fact of the matter consists in is left open by the\nTarskian apparatus.)\n\nWe thus find the usual candidate truth-bearers linked in a tight\ncircle: interpreted sentences, the propositions they express, the\nbelief speakers might hold towards them, and the acts of assertion\nthey might perform with them are all connected by providing something\nmeaningful. This makes them reasonable bearers of truth. For this\nreason, it seems, contemporary debates on truth have been much less\nconcerned with the issue of truth-bearers than were the classical\nones. Some issues remain, of course. Different metaphysical\nassumptions may place primary weight on some particular node in the\ncircle, and some metaphysical views still challenge the existence of\nsome of the nodes. Perhaps more importantly, different views on the\nnature of meaning itself might cast doubt on the coherence of some of\nthe nodes. Notoriously for instance, Quineans (e.g., Quine, 1960) deny\nthe existence of intensional entities, including propositions. Even\nso, it increasingly appears doubtful that attention to truth per\nse will bias us towards one particular primary bearer of\ntruth.\n\nFor more on these issues, see King (2018).\n",
