    "main_text": "Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity || Explaining Normativity via Practical identity\n4.3 Explaining Normativity via Practical identity\n\nIt can seem that desires can be too shallow in our psychology to\nground reasons. Christine Korsgaard has suggested that normativity\nmight instead be grounded in our \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d \u2013 in features of ourselves that we value\n(1996). Our practical identity is to be understood as a matter of\nattitudes we take to ourselves and our lives, but it is something more\ncentral to our sense of ourselves than mere desire. On\nKorsgaard\u2019s account, a parent who values parenthood thereby has\nreasons to act as parents are meant to act. Some people have practical\nidentities that are regrettable, of course, such as the practical\nidentity of a gangster. But, Korsgaard argues, a person\u2019s\npractical identity grounds reasons for her only if it is compatible\nwith the practical identities of everyone else.\n\nThe strategy outlined in the preceding section is to take the\nnormativity of a fact to consist in the fact\u2019s being, or being\nanalyzable as, a fact about reasons. One might then take up\nKorsgaard\u2019s account of reasons as facts about practical identity\nand propose that the normativity of a fact consists in the\nfact\u2019s being, or being analyzable as, a suitable fact about\npractical identity.\n\nThis account can still seem to leave too much to a person\u2019s\ncontingent psychology. It would seem to imply that a rootless person\nwho is aimless and untethered has no reasons whatsoever since he has\nno practical identity. He values nothing about his life. Yet,\nplausibly, there are still things he has reason to do and not to\ndo.\n\nThe theory of normativity on offer here might be classified as an\nexample of basic realism, but it isn\u2019t an example of\nmind-independent realism. It tends to be classified as a\nconstructivist and anti-realist (Street 2010).\n",
