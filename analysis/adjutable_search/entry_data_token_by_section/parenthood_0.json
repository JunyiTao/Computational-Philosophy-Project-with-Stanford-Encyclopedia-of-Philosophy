    "main_text": "Foundations\n1. Foundations\n\nA parent is someone with weighty rights and responsibilities regarding\na given child. Parents usually have decision-making rights over most\nareas of their child\u2019s life and rights to exclude others from\nmaking such decisions. So long as parents fulfill requirements to\nnourish, educate, and provide healthcare for their children, they may\nmake many decisions over how and what their child eats, dresses,\nplays, studies, and with whom he or she interacts.\n Section 5\n surveys controversies regarding the content of these rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\n\u201cParenthood\u201d has distinct senses: biological, social,\nlegal, and moral. These categories present problems at the margins.\nWhile the idea of a biological parent seems self-evident, modern\nreproductive technology complicates it, as a child can have genetic\nparents (gamete providers, who supply the sperm or egg) and a third,\ngestational, parent. Each of these is a biological parent, by virtue\nof making a biological contribution to producing the child. The recent\ntechnology of mitochondrial replacement therapy, in which the nucleus\nof a fertilized egg is transferred to a second egg for medical\nreasons, introduces further complications, as additional genetic\nmaterial\u2014mitochondrial DNA\u2014is supplied by the donor egg\ncell.\n\nBiological parents are commonly distinguished from social parents, who\nrear the child and are socially perceived as responsible for it.\nAdoptive parents, or parents who rear children created with donated\ngametes and gestated by a third party, are social, but not biological,\nparents. (Biological parents need not be social parents, as biological\nparents give up children for adoption, donate gametes, or work as\ngestational parents.) The category of social parent presents\nborderline cases when a given community does not socially recognize\nthose rearing a child as parents. This might occur with a\nmother\u2019s unmarried partner, two friends rearing children\ntogether, other relatives like grandparents rearing the child, or when\na community participates in child-rearing. Legal and moral criteria\nfor the acquisition of parental rights and responsibilities should\nclearly designate whom society should recognize as having them.\n\nLegal parenthood consists in possessing legal parental rights and\nresponsibilities. Historically, in the US, a pregnant woman\u2019s\nhusband has been presumed to be her child\u2019s legal father:\nmarriage, not biology, underpins the legal relation. This has faced\nlegal challenges from genetic fathers (Rosenman 1995; see Hubin 2003\non fatherhood). Law in different jurisdictions is also increasingly\nrecognizing legal parental rights on the basis of same-sex marriage.\nThe rise of ART has prompted many questions regarding assignment of\nlegal parenthood when there are contending claims\u2014as between a\ncouple who commissioned a contract pregnancy and the contracting\ngestational parent. They have also stretched the understanding of\nparenthood, as when the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized three legal\nparents (A.A. v. B.B., 2007 ONCA 2)\u2014a lesbian couple\nand sperm donor. The wider use of ART and gamete donation, along with\nbroader recognition of same-sex marriage and changing social attitudes\ntowards polyamory, have led some philosophers to argue for rethinking\nthe family to include more than two social and legal parents, on\ngrounds including child welfare, social justice, and environmental\nimpact (see, e.g., Cutas 2011, Shrage 2018, Gheaus 2019, Grill\n2020).\n\nLegal, social, and biological parenthood can be conceptually\ndistinguished; however, parenthood is arguably fundamentally a moral\nrelationship, and its moral grounds and obligations should be\nconsidered in resolving the borderline cases. Moral parenthood is\npossession of moral parental rights and responsibilities. These may\ndiffer in content from legal rights and responsibilities\u2014we\nmight think parents morally ought to do more than they are legally\nrequired to do, for example. The moral grounds for assigning parental\nrights can also differ from their legal assignment. Of course, legal\nassignment of parenthood may trigger moral obligations, due to a\ngeneral moral obligation to obey the law or because the legal parent\nis best-placed to rear the child. But moral theories of parenthood\ngive independent grounds for parental rights, on the basis of which\nparticular legal arrangements may be criticized.\n\nThe interrelation of legal, moral, social, and biological parenthood\ndepends on the particular moral theory of how one becomes a parent.\nFor example, on a genetic account, biology determines moral parental\nstatus, whereas on an intentional account, biology will be less\nmorally salient.\n Section 4\n reviews these theories.\n",
