    "main_text": "The Nature of Grounding || Well-foundedness\n2.4 Well-foundedness\n\nAnother issue is whether grounding is well-founded. Different\nauthors mean different things in claiming that grounding is\nwell-founded. According to Schaffer, grounding is well-founded in the\nsense that downwardly non-terminating chains of grounds are\nimpossible. In conceiving of grounding as a relation between entities\nin general and not just facts, Schaffer\u2019s rationale concerns the\nnotion of reality inheritance. Schaffer claims that, were\nthere downwardly non-terminating grounding chains, the being of any\nobject in such a chain would be \u201cinfinitely deferred, never\nachieved\u201d (2010: 62). Something \u201c\u2026cannot be real\nmerely by having a limitless sequence of ancestors, each claiming\nreality from its parents\u201d; instead, \u201cThere must actually\nbe a source of reality somewhere\u201d (2016a: 95). This echoes\nLeibniz, who claims that in the event that every object is a being of\naggregation, \u201cone never arrives at any real being\u201d (Adams\n1994: 333).\n\nOthers claim that grounding is well-founded in the sense that any\ngrounded fact is ultimately grounded by ungrounded facts (Dixon 2016;\nRabin & Rabern 2016). Note that this conception of the\nwell-foundedness of grounding, in contrast to the one above, allows\nfor infinitely descending grounding chains. How so? Following Bliss\n(2013) and Rabin and Rabern (2016), consider Euclidean space, which is\ncomprised of points and regions that include those points. Suppose\nthat regions are gunky in that every region has a region as a proper\npart. And suppose that the existence facts concerning regions are\ngrounded by the existence facts concerning their sub-regions, the\nexistence facts concerning sub-regions are grounded by the existence\nfacts concerning their sub-sub-regions, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. Hence, the fact that region R exists is a\nmember of an infinitely descending grounding chain. But suppose that\nthe existence facts concerning regions are also grounded by the\nexistence facts concerning points. Suppose, moreover, that the\nexistence facts concerning points lack grounds. Hence, while the fact\nthat R exists is a member of an infinitely descending\ngrounding chain, this fact nonetheless is grounded in facts that\nthemselves lack grounds. The same applies to all the other facts that\nare links in the grounding chain in question.\n\nIt may be that, if considerations involving reality inheritance are\nrelevant here, they ultimately support the idea that grounding is\nwell-founded in the second sense rather than the first. While there\nmay be something wrong about reality inheritance in the absence of a\nsource of reality, perhaps there is nothing wrong about endless\nreality inheritance per se. (See Puryear 2020 for discussion\nof the historical context of reality inheritance and Trogdon 2018b for\nfurther discussion of reality inheritance in the contemporary\ncontext.)\n",
