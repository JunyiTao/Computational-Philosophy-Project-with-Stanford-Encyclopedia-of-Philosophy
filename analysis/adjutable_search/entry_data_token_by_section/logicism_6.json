    "main_text": "Constructive Logicism || Motivation for a different kind of neo-logicism\n4.1 Motivation for a different kind of neo-logicism\n\nWe begin this section with some remarks about Gentzenian proof theory.\nThis is not because it played any direct role in the development of\nlogicism\u2014far from it\u2014but because we seek in this section\nto describe in broad terms a different kind of neo-logicism that draws\nmore heavily on proof-theoretic resources.\n\nIt was only with the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the early 1930s (see\nGentzen 1934, 1935) that researchers in foundations were equipped with\nformal calculi of deduction that could do real justice to the actual\nstructure of inferential dependencies within mathematical proofs. What\nwe have in mind here are the dependencies of conclusions upon both\npremises and assumptions that may have been made only \u201cfor the\nsake of argument\u201d. A good example of assumptions of the latter\nkind are reductio assumptions (assume \\(\\phi\\); derive\nabsurdity; conclude \\(\\neg \\phi\\), now independently of \\(\\phi)\\).\n\nIt is extraordinary that the community of mathematical logicians took\nso long to discover the calculi of natural deduction (and the\nsequent calculi), once Frege, in 1879, had cracked the\npreviously hidden grammatical code of multiply quantified sentences.\nIt is remarkable that G\u00f6del, in 1929, could have demonstrated the\ncompleteness of first-order logic before Gentzen\u2019s\nnatural formulation of it, when that logic was available only in the\nforms of the highly unnatural deductive calculi devised by Frege, by\nHilbert, and by Russell and Whitehead.\n\nThe essential breakthrough of Gentzen\u2019s treatment was to\ncharacterize each logical operator in isolation, with rules of its\nown, rules in which only that operator would explicitly\nfeature. Moreover, the rules in question would deal only with a\nsingle occurrence (in dominant position) of the operator in\nquestion. The rule for reasoning to a conclusion with the operator\ndominant was called the operator\u2019s introduction rule;\nwhile the rule for reasoning from a premise with the operator\ndominant was called its elimination rule.\n\nThe introduction and elimination rules for any logical operator have\nto be in a certain kind of equilibrium, an equilibrium that\nlends itself to an interpretation of the rules as matching the\ninferential obligations of any responsible, rational and sincere\nspeaker to the inferential entitlements of any responsible, rational\nand trusting\n listener.[42]\n\nThe equilibrium in question is explicated by the so-called\nreduction procedures for the logical operators. These\nprocedures enable one to remove from a proof any sentence occurrence\nthat stands both as the conclusion of an application of an\nintroduction rule and as the major premise of an application of the\ncorresponding elimination rule. Repeated application of the procedures\nwill eventually turn the proof into one that is in normal\nform\u2014essentially, one that is not eligible for any further\napplication of the\n procedures.[43]\n The significance of proofs in normal form is that they represent\ndirect deductive routes from their premises to their\nconclusions.\n\nPowerful, incisive and revolutionary though Gentzen\u2019s approach\nhas since proved to be, it was, in its turn, curiously limited. It was\nrestricted to just the universally acknowledged logical\noperators of first-order logic: \\(\\neg , \\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow ,\n\\exists\\) and \\(\\forall\\).\n\nAt exactly the same time there appeared Carnap (1934), Logische\nSyntax der Sprache, which offered an account of analyticity for\nlanguages in which all logico-mathematical operators could\nmake similar contributions to the status of a sentence as analytically\ntrue (or analytically false). Carnap, however, did this by employing\naxiomatizations involving all the various logico-mathematical\noperators, co-functioning in grammatically complex axioms. His\napproach was therefore quite unlike the more \u2018natural\u2019 one\nof Gentzen, which was single-operator focused. Moreover, the\nunnatural approach was still Carnap\u2019s preferred choice in work\nas late as his Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (Carnap\n 1939).[44]\n We mention Carnap in contrast with Gentzen here because of\nGentzen\u2019s tragic early death at the end of the Second World War.\nWho knows how Gentzen might have extended his exquisitely conceived\ninferentialist techniques to items on the broad logicist agenda? His\nwritings appeared in English translation only in 1969 (see Gentzen\n1934/1935 [1969]). Carnap, however, did survive to exert considerable\ninfluence on the thinking of a new generation of philosophers of\nmathematics on the problems and prospects for logicism; and he was\nable to do so from the mid-1930s, in the USA, writing in English.\n\nAfter the early 1940s, proof theory did not broaden and diversify so\nas to address a potentially fertile agenda: an investigation of the\nvarious forms that introduction and elimination rules might take, as\nit examines rule-governed expressions whose rules are not quite so\nneatly classifiable as introduction and elimination rules. This is the\ncase, for example, with families of \u2018coeval\u2019 and\ninterdependent concepts of a nevertheless logico-mathematical kind. An\nexample of such a family is that of the ordered pair of any\ntwo things; the first member of any ordered pair; and the\nsecond member of the same. An important feature of this\nexample, and of other examples that could be given, is that the\noperators in question are term-forming operators. Gentzen had\nconfined his study to sentence-forming operators. Perhaps it was\nTarski\u2019s theory of truth for formalized languages (see Tarski\n1956 [1933]) that deflected interest away from further development of\nthis essentially inferentialist approach to the meanings of\nlogical and mathematical operators.\n",
