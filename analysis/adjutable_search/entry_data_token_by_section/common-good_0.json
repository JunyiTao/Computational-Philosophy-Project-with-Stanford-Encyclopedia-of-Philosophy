    "main_text": "First Contrast: Welfare Consequentialism\n1. First Contrast: Welfare Consequentialism\n\nThe common good belongs to a family of concepts that relate to\ngoodness rather than rightness (Sidgwick 1874). What makes the common\ngood different from other concepts in this family is that it is a\nnotion of the good that is understood to be internal to the\nrequirements of a social relationship. In any community, the common\ngood consists of the facilities and interests that members have a\nspecial obligation to care about in virtue of the fact that they stand\nin a certain relationship with one another. In a family, for instance,\nthe family home is part of the common good because the familial bond\nrequires members to take care of the home as part of a shared effort\nto care for one another\u2019s interests in shelter and safety. In a\nuniversity, the climate of academic freedom on campus is part of the\ncommon good because the special relationship among members of the\nuniversity community requires them to care for this climate as part of\na shared effort to care for one another\u2019s interests in teaching,\nlearning and inquiring.\n\nThe common good differs from the various notions of the good that play\na foundational role in welfare consequentialist accounts of political\nmorality. Among the notions in the latter category, we can include:\nthe sum of pleasure over pain, total satisfaction of rational desire,\naggregate welfare adjusted for distributive considerations, welfare\nprioritarianism, equality of welfare (in certain formulations), Pareto\noptimality, and so on. Unlike the common good, these notions make no\nessential reference to the requirements of a social relationship. They\nset out fully independent standards for the goodness of actions,\nmotivations and states of affairs, and the independent character of\nthese standards allows them to serve as foundational elements in a\nnormative theory that has a consequentialist\n structure.[2]\n\nAccording to classical utilitarianism, for example, the correct course\nof action is the optimal course of action as judged from the\nstandpoint of an impartial concern for the pleasures and pains of all\nsentient creatures (Sidgwick 1874). Suppose that a relationship\nconsists of a set of requirements for how people who stand in the\nrelationship should act towards one another\u2014e.g., parents should\nfeed their children, parents should clothe their children, children\nshould defer to their parents\u2019 judgment, etc. According to\nclassical utilitarianism, an agent should perform the action that\nsatisfies the requirements of a relationship only when her doing so\nwould result in the greatest sum of pleasure over pain. The notion of\nthe good here\u2014i.e., the sum of pleasure over pain\u2014is\ndefined independently of the requirements of any relationship, so it\nsets out a criterion for goodness that can tell us, among other\nthings, when it would be good for people to comply with any particular\nrelational requirements.\n\nSome welfare consequentialist notions of the good incorporate a\ndistributive element\u2014e.g., welfare prioritarianism\u2014and\nthis feature may make it more plausible to see these notions as\ninternal to the requirements of a relationship. For example, some may\nthink that welfare prioritarianism could be internal to the family\nrelationship, where the relationship is understood to require family\nmembers to perform the action that is optimal from the standpoint of\nthe worst off member of the group. But keep in mind that even more\ndistributionally sensitive notions of the good, such as welfare\nprioritarianism, retain other features of a consequentialist\nunderstanding of goodness that make it difficult to see how these\nnotions could be internal to a relationship in the relevant sense.\n\nTake agent neutrality. Insofar as welfare prioritarianism is a\ngenuinely consequentialist notion, it says that the correct course of\naction is the course of action that is optimal as judged from a\nstandpoint that does not change with the position of the agent or the\nrelationships that the agent happens to stand in (Williams 1973; Nagel\n1986; cf. Sen 1993). Understood in this way, welfare prioritarianism\ndoes not require an agent to perform the action that is optimal from\nthe standpoint of the worst off member of her own\nfamily. Instead, it requires an agent to perform the action that is\noptimal from the agent neutral standpoint of, say, the welfare of the\nworst off person in the world or the average welfare of all those in\nthe class of people who are worst off in their respective families. If\npeople have reason to pay special attention to the worst off member of\ntheir own families, on this view, it is because a pattern of reasoning\nalong these lines leads to the highest level of welfare for the worst\noff person in the world or the highest average welfare for those in\nthe relevant class.\n\nBecause it is an agent neutral notion, welfare prioritarianism may\nrequire parents to harm their own children if circumstances arise such\nthat doing so would bring about the best result from the standpoint of\nthe welfare of the worst off person in the world or the average\nwelfare of those in the relevant class. A parent might be required to\nact this way, even when lowering the welfare of her own child would\nlead to only a slightly higher level of welfare for the other people\naffected. These implications are clearly at odds with our ordinary\nunderstanding of the agent relative character of relational\nrequirements.\n\nThe upshot is that welfare consequentialist accounts of political\nmorality are not based, at the most fundamental level, on conceptions\nof the common good. They are based instead on notions of the good that\nare understood to be prior to and independent of any social\nrelationship. Nonetheless, it is worth stressing that a welfare\nconsequentialist account of political morality may incorporate a\nconception of the common good as part of a more specific account of\nthe ethical obligations of citizens in public life. After all, a\ncertain pattern of agent relative motivation among citizens may be the\noptimal pattern as judged from the standpoint of aggregate welfare (or\nsome other suitably agent neutral perspective). John Stuart Mill sets\nout a theory along these lines in Considerations on Representative\nGovernment (1862). On his view, citizens should take an active\ninterest in the public affairs of their community and social\ninstitutions should be designed to generate this pattern of motivation\namong citizens. The reason for this is that an orientation among\ncitizens towards the common affairs of their community is part of\nthe best political arrangement overall, as judged from the standpoint\nof the principle of\n utility.[3]\n",
