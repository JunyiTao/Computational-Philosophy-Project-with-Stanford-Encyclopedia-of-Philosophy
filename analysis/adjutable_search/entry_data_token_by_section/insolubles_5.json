    "main_text": "Early Developments to the 1320s\n2. Early Developments to the 1320s\n\nIn 1132, Adam of Balsham, the founder of the important logical school\nof the \u201cParvipontani\u201d (so called because they\ngathered at the Petit Pont in Paris), wrote an Art of\nDiscussing (Ars disserendi), in which he treats, among\nother things, various kinds of yes/no questions, including\n\u201cwhether he speaks truly who says he lies\u201d and\n\u201cwhether he who says nothing but that he lies is speaking the\ntruth\u201d. ([AB]: 107.)\n\nThe importance of this passage should not be exaggerated. It is true\nthat it gives us the earliest known explicit medieval formulation of\nthe\n Liar.[7]\n But Adam makes no attempt to solve the paradox, does not say it was a\ncurrent topic of discussion in his day, and in fact does not even\nindicate he recognized its paradoxicalness. He simply offers it as an\nexample of one kind of yes/no question.\n\nIt is not until later in the twelfth century that one finds an\nexplicit statement of the special problems raised by insolubles. In\nhis On the Natures of Things (De naturis rerum), of\nunknown date but apparently well known by the end of the century,\nAlexander Neckham ([N-NR]: 289)\n wrote[8]:\n\n\nAgain, if Socrates says he lies, and says nothing else, he says some\nproposition. Therefore, either a true one or a false one. Therefore,\nif Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or what is\nfalse.\n\nBut if (1) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is true, then it is true that Socrates lies. And\nif it is true that Socrates lies, Socrates says what is false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies,\nand he says what is true, he says what is false.\n\nBut if (2) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is false, then it is false that Socrates says\nwhat is false. And if it is false that Socrates says what is false,\nSocrates does not say what is false. But if Socrates says only that he\nlies, he says either what is true or what is false. Therefore, if\nSocrates says he lies, he says what is true. Therefore, if Socrates\nsays only that he lies, and he says what is false, then he says what\nis true.\n\nBut if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true\nand says what is false.\n\n\nNevertheless, although it is clear that Neckham was fully aware of\nwhat is paradoxical about the Liar, he makes no attempt to\nsolve the paradox. He presents it only as an example of the\n\u201cvanities\u201d logic deals with. This suggests that by his day\nothers were trying to solve the paradox, and in fact in the\ndiscussion of the fallacy secundum quid et simpliciter\ncontained in the so-called Munich Logic (= Dialectica\nMonacensis) from sometime in the second half of the century, we\nfind the remark: \u201cBut how this fallacy arises in uttering the\ninsoluble \u2018I am saying a falsehood\u2019, that is a matter\ndiscussed in the treatise on\n insolubles\u201d.[9]\n\nThe first text we have that actually tries to solve the paradox is an\nanonymous treatise from the very end of the twelfth or the very early\nthirteenth century (De Rijk 1966). From then on, there are a great\nnumber of surviving treatments (see Spade 1975). In the early 1320s,\nThomas Bradwardine, in a preliminary section of his own treatise on\ninsolubles, lists eight views in circulation in his day, in addition\nto his own (see Bradwardine [B-I], ch. 2; Spade 1987: 43\u201346).\nSome of these views can no longer be identified in the texts that\nsurvive from the period before Bradwardine, but among the surviving\nviews, we can distinguish five broad approaches to\n\u201csolving\u201d the\n paradox.[10]\n (Sometimes these approaches are combined in a single author.)\n",
