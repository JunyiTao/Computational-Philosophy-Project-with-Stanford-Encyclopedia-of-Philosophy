    "main_text": "Newtonian Spacetime\n2. Newtonian Spacetime\n\nModern physical theories are often formulated in a language that\npermits one to express a variety of different views with respect to\ntime and its relation to space. One can, for example, formulate the\nbasic ideas of classical (that is, Newtonian) physics, the special\ntheory of relativity, and the general theory of relativity in this\nlanguage. For a brief introduction to manifolds and the spacetime\nview, see the section on\n modern spacetime theories\n in the entry on\n the hole argument\n in this Encyclopedia. For more detail with minimal technical demands\nthe reader should see the first four chapters of Geroch (1978) or the\nmore demanding chapter 2 of Friedman (1983).\n\nFor our purposes, the defining feature of a manifold that is a\nNewtonian spacetime is that the temporal interval between any two\npoints or events in the spacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nis a well-defined quantity. This quantity is\nwell-defined in that it does not depend upon point of view, reference\nframe, coordinate system or \u201cobserver\u201d. This quantity,\nthen, is absolute in the sense of being frame- or\nobserver-independent. (In the special theory of relativity the\ntemporal interval between two distinct spacetime points fails to be\nabsolute in this sense.)\n\nIf the temporal interval between two events is 0, then we say that the\ntwo events are simultaneous. This relation of (absolute)\nsimultaneity is an equivalence relation (That is, it is reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive.) that slices (partitions or foliates) the\nspacetime or manifold into mutually exclusive and exhaustive planes of\nsimultaneity. These planes of simultaneity can then be completely\nordered by the relation \u2018is earlier than\u2019 or its converse\n\u2018is later than\u2019.\n",
