    "main_text": "Ethical Egoism\n2. Ethical Egoism\n\nEthical egoism claims that I morally ought to perform some action if\nand only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my\nself-interest. (There are possibilities other than maximization. One\nmight, for example, claim that one ought to achieve a certain level of\nwelfare, but that there is no requirement to achieve more. Ethical\negoism might also apply to things other than acts, such as rules or\ncharacter traits. Since these variants are uncommon, and the arguments\nfor and against them are largely the same as those concerning the\nstandard version, I set them aside.)\n\nOne issue concerns how much ethical egoism differs in content from\nstandard moral theories. It might appear that it differs a great deal.\nAfter all, moral theories such as Kantianism, utilitarianism, and\ncommon-sense morality require that an agent give weight to the\ninterests of others. They sometimes require uncompensated sacrifices,\nparticularly when the loss to the agent is small and the gain to\nothers is large. (Say the cost to me of saving a drowning person is\ngetting my shirtsleeve wet.) Ethical egoists can reply, however, that\negoism generates many of the same duties to others. The argument runs\nas follows. Each person needs the cooperation of others to obtain\ngoods such as defense or friendship. If I act as if I give no weight\nto others, others will not cooperate with me. If, say, I break my\npromises whenever it is in my direct self-interest to do so, others\nwill not accept my promises, and may even attack me. I do best, then,\nby acting as if others have weight (provided they act as if I have\nweight in return).\n\nIt is unlikely that this argument proves that ethical egoism generates\nall of the standard duties to others. For the argument depends on the\nability of others to cooperate with me or attack me should I fail to\ncooperate. In dealings with others who lack these abilities, the\negoist has no reason to cooperate. The duties to others found in\nstandard moral theories are not conditional in this way. I do not, for\nexample, escape a duty to save a drowning person, when I can easily do\nso, just because the drowning person (or anyone watching) happens\nnever to be able to offer fruitful cooperation or retaliation.\n\nThe divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral theories\nappears in other ways.\n\nFirst, the ethical egoist will rank as most important duties that\nbring her the highest payoff. Standard moral theories determine\nimportance at least in part by considering the payoff to those helped.\nWhat brings the highest payoff to me is not necessarily what brings\nthe highest payoff to those helped. I might, for example, profit more\nfrom helping the local Opera society refurbish its hall than I would\nfrom giving to famine relief in Africa, but standard moral theories\nwould rank famine relief as more important than Opera hall\nimprovements.\n\nSecond, the cooperation argument cannot be extended to justify\nextremely large sacrifices, such as the soldier falling on the\ngrenade, that standard moral theories rank either as most important or\nsupererogatory. The cooperation argument depends on a short-term loss\n(such as keeping a promise that it is inconvenient to keep) being\nrecompensed by a long-term gain (such as being trusted in future\npromises). Where the immediate loss is one\u2019s life (or\nirreplaceable features such as one\u2019s sight), there is no\nlong-term gain, and so no egoist argument for the sacrifice.\n\nAn ethical egoist might reply by taking the cooperation argument\nfurther. Perhaps I cannot get the benefits of cooperation without\nconverting to some non-egoist moral theory. That is, it is not enough\nthat I act as if others have weight; I must really give them weight. I\ncould still count as an egoist, in the sense that I have adopted the\nnon-egoist theory on egoist grounds.\n\nOne problem is that it seems unlikely that I can get the benefits of\ncooperation only by conversion. Provided I act as if others have\nweight for long enough, others will take me as giving them weight, and\nso cooperate, whether I really give them weight or not. In many\nsituations, others will neither have the ability to see my true\nmotivation nor care about it.\n\nAnother problem is that conversion can be costly. I might be required\nby my non-egoist morality to make a sacrifice for which I cannot be\ncompensated (or pass up a gain so large that passing it up will not be\ncompensated for). Since I have converted from egoism, I can no longer\nreject making the sacrifice or passing up the gain on the ground that\nit will not pay. It is safer, and seemingly feasible, to remain an\negoist while cooperating in most cases. If so, ethical egoism and\nstandard moralities will diverge in some cases. (For discussion of the\ncooperation argument, see Frank 1988; Gauthier 1986 ch. 6; Kavka 1984\nand 1986 Part II; Sidgwick 1907 II.V.)\n\nThere is another way to try to show that ethical egoism and standard\nmoral theories do not differ much. One might hold one particular\nobjective theory of self-interest, according to which my welfare lies\nin possessing the virtues required by standard moral theories. This\nrequires an argument to show that this particular objective theory\ngives the right account of self-interest. It also faces a worry for\nany objective theory: objective theories seem implausible as accounts\nof welfare. If, say, all my preferences favor my ignoring the plight\nof others, and these preferences do not rest on false beliefs about\nissues such as the likelihood of receiving help, it seems implausible\n(and objectionably paternalistic) to claim that \u201creally\u201d\nmy welfare lies in helping others. I may have a duty to help others,\nand the world might be better if I helped others, but it does not\nfollow that I am better off by helping others. (For a more optimistic\nverdict on this strategy, noting its roots in Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle, the Stoics, and the British Idealists, see Brink 1997 and\n2003.)\n\nOf course the divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral\ntheories need not bother an ethical egoist. An ethical egoist sees\negoism as superior to other moral theories. Whether it is superior\ndepends on the strength of the arguments for it. Two arguments are\npopular.\n\nFirst, one might argue for a moral theory, as one argues for a\nscientific theory, by showing that it best fits the evidence. In the\ncase of moral theories, the evidence is usually taken to be our most\nconfident common-sense moral judgments. Egoism fits many of these,\nsuch as the requirements of cooperation in ordinary cases. It fits\nsome judgments better than utilitarianism does. For example, it allows\none to keep some good, such as a job, for oneself, even if giving the\ngood to someone else would help him slightly more, and it captures the\nintuition that I need not let others exploit me. The problem is that,\nas the discussion of the cooperation argument shows, it also fails to\nfit some of the confident moral judgments we make.\n\nSecond, one might argue for a moral theory by showing that it is\ndictated by non-moral considerations -- in particular, by facts about\nmotivation. It is commonly held that moral judgments must be\npractical, or capable of motivating those who make them. If\npsychological egoism were true, this would restrict moral judgments to\nthose made by egoism. Other moral judgments would be excluded since it\nwould be impossible to motivate anyone to follow them.\n\nOne problem with this argument is that psychological egoism seems\nfalse. Replacing psychological with predominant egoism loses the key\nclaim that it is impossible to motivate anyone to make an\nuncompensated sacrifice.\n\nThe ethical egoist might reply that, if predominant egoism is true,\nethical egoism may require less deviation from our ordinary actions\nthan any standard moral theory. But fit with motivation is hardly\ndecisive; any normative theory, including ethical egoism, is intended\nto guide and criticize our choices, rather than simply endorse\nwhatever we do. When I make an imprudent choice, this does not count\nagainst ethical egoism, and in favor of a theory recommending\nimprudence.\n\nThe argument has other problems. One could deny that morality must be\npractical in the required sense. Perhaps morality need not be\npractical at all: we do not always withdraw moral judgments when we\nlearn that the agent could not be motivated to follow them. Or perhaps\nmoral judgments must be capable of motivating not just anyone, but\nonly idealized versions of ourselves, free from (say) irrationality.\nIn this case, it is insufficient to describe how we are motivated;\nwhat is relevant is a description of how we would be motivated were we\nrational.\n\nFinally, if I do not believe that some action is ultimately in my\nself-interest, it follows from psychological egoism that I cannot aim\nto do it. But say I am wrong: the action is in my self-interest.\nEthical egoism then says that it is right for me to do something I\ncannot aim to do. It violates practicality just as any other moral\ntheory does.\n\nSo far a number of arguments for ethical egoism have been considered.\nThere are a number of standard arguments against it.\n\nG. E. Moore argued that ethical egoism is self-contradictory. If I am\nan egoist, I hold that I ought to maximize my good. I deny that others\nought to maximize my good (they should maximize their own goods). But\nto say that x is \u201cmy good\u201d is just to say that my\npossessing x is good. (I cannot possess the goodness.) If my\npossession of x is good, then I must hold that others ought\nto maximize my possession of it. I both deny and am committed to\naffirming that others ought to maximize my good. (Sometimes Moore\nsuggests instead that \u201cmy good\u201d be glossed as\n\u201cx is good and x is mine.\u201d This does not\nyield the contradiction above, since it does not claim that my\npossession of x is good. But it yields a different\ncontradiction: if x is good, everyone ought to maximize it\nwherever it appears; egoists hold that I ought to maximize x\nonly when it appears in me.)\n\nOne reply is that egoism can be stated without using \u201cmy\ngood.\u201d The egoist can hold (as Sidgwick usually does) that she\nought to maximize her happiness or self-interest (Prichard 2002:\n176).\n\nAnother reply is that one might keep \u201cmy good\u201d but deny\nthat if my possessing x is good, others ought to maximize my\npossession of it. C. D. Broad writes that the egoist can hold that\n\u201cequally pleasant states of mind are equally good things, no\nmatter whose states of mind they may be. But...each of us is properly\nconcerned, not with all good things, but only with a certain\nrestricted class of good things, viz., those which are states of his\nown mind\u201d (Broad 1930: 243; also Broad 1942: 44\u20136, 1971c:\n347\u201350, Prichard 2002: 217, Ewing 1965: 33). As Broad notes,\nthis sort of position is not unique to egoists; deontologists also\ndeny that one ought always maximize the good.\n\nThere is another way to deny that if my possessing x is good,\nothers ought to maximize my possession of it. One might hold that\n\u201cmy good\u201d should not be analyzed in terms of what Moore\ncalls \u201cgood absolutely\u201d but rather is a distinct concept,\ngood-for-me, linked only to agent-relative reasons (Mackie 1976, Smith\n2003). It does not follow from \u201cmy possession of x is\ngood-for-me\u201d that others ought to maximize what is\ngood-for-me.\n\nMoore also suggests that the reason for me to pursue my good is the\ngoodness of the thing I obtain. If what I obtain is good, then there\nis reason for everyone to pursue it, not just in me, but anywhere.\nAgain, moving to good-for-me avoids this consequence. But something\nclose to this argument is plausible, especially for some bad things.\nOne might argue that it is the way my pain feels \u2014 its badness\n\u2014 and not any connection between me and the pain that gives me\nreason to alleviate it. If so, I have reason to alleviate the pain of\nothers (Nagel 1986, Rachels 2002). (This argument can be directed\nagainst rational egoism as well.)\n\nA second argument against ethical egoism was made by H. A. Prichard.\nHe argues that self-interest is the wrong sort of reason. I do not,\nfor example, think the reason I have a duty to help a drowning child\nis that helping benefits me (Prichard 2002 1, 9, 26, 29, 30, 122, 123,\n171, 188). Similarly, Prichard chastises Sidgwick for taking seriously\nthe view that there is \u201ca duty...to do those acts which\nwe think will lead to our happiness\u201d (Prichard 2002 135).\n\nThis may be convincing when \u201cduty\u201d means \u201cmoral\nduty.\u201d It is less convincing when, as Prichard also thinks, the\nissue is simply what one ought to do. He takes there to be only one\nsense of \u201cought,\u201d which he treats as \u201cmorally\nought.\u201d Any other \u201cought\u201d is treated as really\nmaking the non-normative claim that a certain means is efficient for\nattaining a certain end. But ethical egoism can be seen as making\ncategorical and normative ought-claims. And the historical popularity\nof ethical or rational egoism (see Crisp 2019), which Prichard so\noften notes, indicates that self-interest is not obviously irrelevant\nto what one ought to do.\n\nA third argument, like Moore\u2019s, claims that ethical egoism is\ninconsistent in various ways. Say ethical egoism recommends that\nA and B both go to a certain hockey game, since\ngoing to the game is in the self-interest of each. Unfortunately, only\none seat remains. Ethical egoism, then, recommends an impossible state\nof affairs. Or say that I am A and an ethical egoist. I both\nclaim that B ought to go to the game, since that is in her\nself-interest, and I do not want B to go to the game, since\nB\u2019s going to the game is against my self-interest.\n\nAgainst the first inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can reply\nthat ethical egoism provides no neutral ranking of states of affairs.\nIt recommends to A that A go to the game, and to\nB that B go to the game, but is silent on the value\nof A and B both attending the game.\n\nAgainst the second inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can claim\nthat she morally recommends that B go to the game, although\nshe desires that B not go. This is no more odd than claiming\nthat my opponent in a game would be wise to adopt a particular\nstrategy, while desiring that he not do so. True, the ethical egoist\nis unlikely to recommend ethical egoism to others, to blame others for\nviolations of what ethical egoism requires, to justify herself to\nothers on the basis of ethical egoism, or to express moral attitudes\nsuch as forgiveness and resentment. These publicity worries may\ndisqualify ethical egoism as a moral theory, but do not show\ninconsistency.\n\nA fourth argument against ethical egoism is just that: ethical egoism\ndoes not count as a moral theory. One might set various constraints on\na theory\u2019s being a moral theory. Many of these constraints are\nmet by ethical egoism \u2014 the formal constraints, for example,\nthat moral claims must be prescriptive and universalizable. Ethical\negoism issues prescriptions \u2014 \u201cdo what maximizes your\nself-interest\u201d \u2014 and it issues the same prescriptions for\npeople in relevantly similar situations. But other constraints are\nproblematic for ethical egoism: perhaps a moral theory must sometimes\nrequire uncompensated sacrifices; or perhaps it must supply a single,\nneutral ranking of actions that each agent must follow in cases where\ninterests conflict; or perhaps it must respect principles such as\n\u201cthat I ought to do x is a consideration in favor of\nothers not preventing me from doing x;\u201d or perhaps it\nmust be able to be made public in the way, just noted, that ethical\negoism cannot. (For sample discussions of these two objections, see\nBaier 1958 189\u2013191; Campbell 1972; Frankena 1973 18\u201320;\nKalin 1970.)\n\nThe issue of what makes for a moral theory is contentious. An ethical\negoist could challenge whatever constraint is deployed against her.\nBut a neater reply is to move to rational egoism, which makes claims\nabout what one has reason to do, ignoring the topic of what is morally\nright. This gets at what ethical egoists intend, while skirting the\nissue of constraints on moral theories. After all, few if any ethical\negoists think of egoism as giving the correct content of morality,\nwhile also thinking that what they have most reason to do is\ndetermined by some non-egoist consideration. One could then, if one\nwished, argue for ethical egoism from rational egoism and the\nplausible claim that the best moral theory must tell me what I have\nmost reason to do.\n",
