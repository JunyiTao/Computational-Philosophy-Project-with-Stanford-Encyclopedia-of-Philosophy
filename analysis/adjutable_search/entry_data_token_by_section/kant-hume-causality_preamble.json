    "main_text": "\n\nKant famously attempted to \u201canswer\u201d what he took to be\nHume\u2019s skeptical view of causality, most explicitly in the\nProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783); and, because\ncausality, for Kant, is a central example of a category or pure\nconcept of the understanding, his relationship to Hume on this topic\nis central to his philosophy as a whole. Moreover, because\nHume\u2019s famous discussion of causality and induction is equally\ncentral to his philosophy, understanding the relationship between the\ntwo philosophers on this issue is crucial for a proper understanding\nof modern philosophy more generally. Yet ever since Kant offered his\nresponse to Hume the topic has been subject to intense controversy.\nThere is no consensus, of course, over whether Kant\u2019s response\nsucceeds, but there is no more consensus about what this response is\nsupposed to be. There has been sharp disagreement concerning\nKant\u2019s conception of causality, as well as Hume\u2019s, and,\naccordingly, there has also been controversy over whether the two\nconceptions really significantly differ. There has even been\ndisagreement concerning whether Hume\u2019s conception of causality\nand induction is skeptical at all. We shall not discuss these\ncontroversies in detail; rather, we shall concentrate on presenting\none particular perspective on this very complicated set of issues. We\nshall clearly indicate, however, where especially controversial points\nof interpretation arise and briefly describe some of the main\nalternatives. (Most of this discussion will be confined to footnotes,\nwhere we shall also present further, more specialized details.)\n",
