    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nG\u00e9raud (or Gerauld) de Cordemoy was born in October of 1626,\nthe son of a University of Paris professor. He was the third of four\nchildren born to G\u00e9raud and Nicole de Cordemoy, and the only\nson. His father died when he was nine years old, and other than this,\nalmost nothing is known of Cordemoy\u2019s early years. While there\nis not a record of the date of his marriage (to Marie de Chazelles),\nthe first of his five children is known to have been born on December\n7, 1651, when Cordemoy was twenty-five.\n\nCordemoy earned a living as a lawyer, but was very active in Parisian\nphilosophical circles. He attended various philosophy salons, and was\nacquainted with the Minim Emmanuel Maignan and the physicist Jacques\nRohault, both organizers of philosophical conferences. In 1664,\nCordemoy\u2019s essay Discours de l\u2019\u00e1ction des corps\n(A Discourse on the action of bodies) was included, along with a\ndiscourse by Rohault, in the posthumous publication of\nDescartes\u2019 Le Monde (The World) by Claude Clerselier.\nThat essay would later become the second of the six discourses which\nmake up one of Cordemoy\u2019s two most important works, Le\nDiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me en six discours pour\nservir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9claircissement de la physique (The\nDistinction of the body and the soul in six discourses, in order to be\nuseful for the clarification of physics) (1666). In this work,\nCordemoy presents his atomism, his arguments for occasionalism, and\nhis accounts of the distinction of and the interaction between the\nmind and the body.\n\nCordemoy\u2019s other important work, the Discours physique de la\nparole (A Physical discourse on speech), appeared in 1668, as did\nhis Copie d\u2019une lettre ecrite \u00e0 un s\u00e7avant\nreligieux de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus (A Copy of a letter written\nto a learned religious of the Company of Jesus). The latter is\nCordemoy\u2019s attempt to reconcile Cartesian philosophy with the\nstory of creation as found in the Book of Genesis. The former is an\naccount of speech production, and its popularity led to\nCordemoy\u2019s being recognized as one of the more important French\nphilosophers of his time. He was even the model for the character of\nthe Master of Philosophy in Moli\u00e8re\u2019s play Le\nBourgeois Gentilhomme.\n\nOther, shorter works by Cordemoy include his Traitez de\nMetaphysique (Treatise on Metaphysics) and his Traitez sur\nl\u2019Histoire et la Politique (Treatise on History and\nPolitics). At the time of his death, Cordemoy was working on a\nhistory of France, which would be completed by his eldest son\nLouis-G\u00e9raud and which appeared in two volumes, in 1685 and\n1689. In addition to his philosophical and historical publications,\nCordemoy served briefly as the director of l\u2019Academie\nFran\u00e7ais (having been elected a member in 1675) and was\nfor a time the tutor to the Dauphin, son of King Louis XIV. Shortly\nafter his 58th birthday, Cordemoy suffered a brief illness\nand died, on October 15, 1684.\n",
