    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPeter Frederick Strawson was born, in London, on November 23, 1919. He\nstudied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at St. John\u2019s\nCollege, Oxford, between 1937 and 1940. His philosophy tutors were\nJ.D. Mabbott, an eminent political philosopher, later to become Master\nof the college, and H. P. Grice, whom Strawson himself described as\n\u2018one of the cleverest and most ingenious thinkers of our\ntime\u2019. (This quotation comes from Strawson\u2019s\n\u2018Intellectual Autobiography\u2019 contained in Hahn 1998.\nStrawson\u2019s account there of his life and thought contains much\nthat is of philosophical interest, and it also reveals much about him\nas a person.) Strawson was then called up for military service and\nbelongs to that generation of British philosophers, including Ayer,\nHampshire, Hare, Hart and Wollheim, who saw service in the Second\nWorld War. His first post after the war was at Bangor, in Wales. After\nwinning the prestigious John Locke Prize in Oxford (a prize awarded on\nthe basis of a written examination to philosophy graduates in Oxford),\nhe received an appointment at University College, Oxford, which made\nhim a Fellow in 1948. Two years later, in 1950, with the publication\nof \u2018On Referring\u2019 in Mind and his debate with\nAustin about truth, he achieved international fame.\n\nHis subsequent life as a philosopher was spent mostly in positions at\nOxford, first as a Fellow at University College, and then, after 1968,\nas Gilbert Ryle\u2019s successor as Wayneflete Professor of\nMetaphysical Philosophy, at Magdalen College. Writing extensively, in\nboth books and articles, about the philosophy of language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and the history of philosophy, he succeeded\nin redirecting Oxford philosophy away from the limitations which had\nto some extent been accepted under the influence of Austin, towards a\nre-engagement with some traditional abstract philosophical issues.\nFrom the early 1950s onwards he established a pre-eminence within\nOxford philosophy, both through his publications and also through his\nquite exceptional critical abilities. Part of the way that\nStrawson\u2019s approach to philosophy contrasted with Austin\u2019s\nis that Strawson was committed to the value of publication, of books\nand articles, whereas Austin seemed content to develop his views and\npromulgate them in lectures and talks. His achievements were\nrecognised by election in 1960 to the British Academy, by the\nreception of a knighthood in 1977 and by many other honours. In 1998\nhe became the twenty-sixth philosopher to have a volume devoted to him\nin the famous Library of Living Philosophers series, adding another\nBritish name to the list of recipients of this honour, previous ones\nbeing Whitehead, Russell, Moore, Broad and Ayer. He was probably the\nmost famous and most discussed British philosopher within the academic\nworld of philosophy from the 1950s until the late 1980s. His status is\nevidenced by the fact that his writings attracted the attention of,\nand were discussed by, the world\u2019s leading philosophers,\nincluding, Russell, Sellars, Putnam, Quine, Davidson, and Kripke.\n\nStrawson was married and had four children. He was a highly cultured\nman, with a passion for literature, especially poetry, large amounts\nof which he could recite and which he also wrote. In conversation,\nmanners and appearance, the overwhelming impression was of elegance\nand effortless intelligence.\n\nStrawson retired in 1987, but remained philosophically active until\nhis death in Oxford on February 13, 2006.\n",
