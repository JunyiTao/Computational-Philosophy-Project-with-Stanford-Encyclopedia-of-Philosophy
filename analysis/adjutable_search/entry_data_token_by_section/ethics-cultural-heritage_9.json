    "main_text": "Cultural Property || Stewardship\n2.4 Stewardship\n\nAs introduced in the previous two sections, one might think that the\nconcept of cultural property places an emphasis on ownership where\nwhat is really required is stewardship. For instance, one might think\nthat \u201ccultural property does not really belong to\nanyone\u2026that all of us have a duty towards cultural property\nbecause of its relative scarcity and profound significance\u201d\n(Harding 1997: 760). This kind of view might be shared by those who\naim to prioritize the preservation of cultural property (Warren 1989;\nMerryman 1994) or those who think we have special duties to cultural\nheritage grounded either in the virtues (James 2013) or an\ninter-generational social contract (Thompson 2000a; though stewardship\nshould not necessarily be equated with preservation (Harding 1997:\n771)).\n\nWhile the concept of stewardship might solve certain problems\nconcerning cultural property by uniting contestants over ownership\naround a common aim, it is also liable to inherit transposed versions\nof some of the same problems. For instance, advocates of stewardship\nmust contend with what and whose values will guide stewardship\nefforts. What exactly should be stewarded, why, and for the sake of\nwhom? If, for instance, scientific or world heritage values take the\nlead, stewardship models can invite the same kinds of objections as\nuniversalist notions of cultural property that leave inadequate room\nfor the purportedly special relationship between particular cultural\ngroups and objects, or crowd out alternative value systems or sources\nof knowledge (Wylie 2005). These concerns can perhaps be avoided\nthrough a non-monolithic understanding of stewardship that\nacknowledges rights and duties for multiple parties with respect to\nsingle objects (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009), but they remain\nconcerns that advocates of stewardship models will need to address if\nstewardship is to serve as a viable substitute for an ownership model\nof cultural property.\n",
