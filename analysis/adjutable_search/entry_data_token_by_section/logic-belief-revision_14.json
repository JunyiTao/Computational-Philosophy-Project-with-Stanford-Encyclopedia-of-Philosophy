This operation is\ncalled consolidation. The consolidation of a belief base \\(A\\) is\ndenoted \\(A!\\). A plausible way to perform consolidation is to\ncontract by falsum (contradiction), i.e. \\(A! = A\\div\\smbot\\).\n\nUnfortunately, this recipe for consolidation of inconsistent belief\nbases does not have a plausible counterpart for inconsistent belief\nsets. The reason is that since belief revision operates within\nclassical logic, there is only one inconsistent belief set. Once an\ninconsistent belief set has been obtained, all distinctions have been\nlost, and consolidation cannot restore them.\n",
