    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Memorials\n3.2 Memorials\n\nMemorials take a number of different forms, such as monuments,\npreserved sites of important or tragic events, museums, archives,\nceremonies or educational activities (Barsalou and Baxter 2007,\nZembylas 2011). They may be officially or privately sponsored. Yet all\nprovide a shared focus for memory. Scholars argue that memorials of\npast wrongdoing have the potential to play a number of different roles\nin the process of reconciliation. First and foremost, they help\npreserve the memory of the past event, which counters any who would\ndeny or forget the past. They help consolidate a communal\nunderstanding of history and provide a shared focus for emotions, such\nas grief or remorse. By helping to forge a collective memory of the\npast, memorials may also help rebuild or reshape a sense of collective\nidentity (Harjes 2005). Commemorations provided by groups responsible\nfor wrongdoing may demonstrate a willingness to acknowledge\nresponsibility for such wrongs, (renewed) respect for the victims, and\ncommitment never to repeat such misdeeds (Barsalou and Baxter 2007,\nBlustein 2014). For the victimized group, a memorial can encourage\nself-respect, show fidelity to the dead, and help preserve their sense\nof themselves as a people (Blustein 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, memorials are frequently surrounded by controversy,\nas parties disagree over the version of history put forward or the\nmanner in which it is displayed (Minow 1998). Attempts to aestheticize\npast horrors may be offensive to some viewers (Young 2008). Memorials\nmay cynically divert attention from ongoing problems (Blustein 2014)\nor serve as a rallying point for those who would like to renew the\nconflict (Barsalou and Baxter 2007). Furthermore, the meanings of\nmemorials change over time, as they are continually reinterpreted by\nlater audiences inhabiting different political circumstances. There is\nthus no guarantee that a memorial that contributes to reconciliation\nat one point in time will continue to do so (Blustein 2014).\n",
