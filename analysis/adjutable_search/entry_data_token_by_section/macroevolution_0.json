Punctuated Equilibria\n\nThe classic paper on punctuated equilibria (PE) was co-authored by\nNiles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (1972), although Eldredge (1971)\nwas originally responsible for the idea. Their (1972) presentation of\nPE draws heavily on themes from Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1962) work, as\nthey present PE as a new paradigm to rival traditional Darwinian\ngradualism (Turner 2011b: chapter 2). Far from challenging the modern\nsynthesis in that early work, they present PE as a straightforward\nconsequence of allopatric speciation (speciation driven by isolating\ngeographic change). Eldredge and Gould reasoned that if speciation\nwere typically allopatric, then it would tend to happen fairly rapidly\nin geological terms, and new species would be geographically distant\nfrom parent species. Consequently, in the fossil record, one should\nnot expect to see very many cases where a fossil series documents a\nclear and gradual transition from one species to another. Eldredge and\nGould also argued that most morphological change occurs in\n(geologically) rapid spurts during speciation events and that new\nspecies, once they arise, typically exhibit stasis.\n\nWhen Eldredge and Gould (1972) introduced punctuated equilibria, the\nreceived view of expected morphological change via evolution was that\nof phyletic gradualism. This is a notion that can be traced all the\nway from Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species to, for instance,\nSimpson (1970). In accepting phyletic gradualism, paleontologists had\nlong had to accept that the incompleteness of the fossil record was\nsignificantly responsible for the lack of (ideally expected)\ngeological documentation of gradual transformation in the majority of\nfossilized speciation events. What Eldredge and Gould uniquely\nrealized, however, was that the expectation of phyletic gradualism\nclashed not only with what the fossil record actually showed, but also\nwith what the dominant model of (allopatric) speciation predicted. So\nthey developed PE: an alternative view of morphological evolution (and\nstasis) intended to synthesize what allopatric speciation projected\nwith what the fossil record depicted.\n\nIn the Origin of Species, Darwin had attributed the lack of\nfossil series exhibiting gradual morphological transition to the\nincompleteness of the fossil record. He thought of speciation and\nmorphological evolution as gradual processes (though he did\nacknowledge variation in evolutionary rates), and thought that they\noften happen under the geological radar. As he put it: \u201cNature\nmay almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of\nher transitional or linking forms\u201d (Darwin 1859 [1964: 292]).\nEldredge and Gould were, in contrast, proposing that the fossil record\nis more complete than it seems, and that we should take the rapid\nappearance of new species more or less at face value. As they\neventually put it, in designing the theory of punctuated equilibrium\nthey were \u201choping to validate our profession\u2019s primary\ndata as signal rather than void\u201d (Gould & Eldredge 1993:\n223). One epistemological issue in play here is whether the absence of\nevidence\u2014in this case, the absence of evidence of gradual\nevolutionary change\u2014is really evidence of absence (Sober 2009;\nCurrie & Turner 2017).\n\nThe ensuing debate about punctuated equilibria proved to be complex\nand contentious. Gould, in particular, made increasingly bold and\ncontroversial claims on behalf of PE during the 1980s, and he tended\nto see PE as the opening wedge for a more ambitious critique of the\nmodern synthesis. Notoriously, Gould also flirted with non-Darwinian\naccounts of speciation, such as Richard Goldschmidt\u2019s (1940)\nidea that new species arise from \u201chopeful monsters\u201d (Gould\n1977). The stasis claim of PE was also controversial, especially since\nGould took it to mean that cumulative, directional natural selection\nis a less significant factor in evolution than many had thought. The\nreasoning was that if directional natural selection were the dominant\ndriver of evolutionary change, then you would not expect to see such\nclear patterns of stasis in the fossil record. PE elicited a great\ndeal of opposition from biologists and philosophers who were more\ncommitted to a selectionist picture of evolution (Dawkins 1986;\nDennett 1995; and see Sterelny 2001a for a useful guide to the\ncontroversy).\n\nIn the meantime, PE also inspired new empirical research in\npaleontology, with scientists doing statistical analysis of large\nfossil samples to try to assess the relative importance of stasis vs.\ngradual directional change. This research continues to get more\nsophisticated, and as it happens, PE has fared reasonably well,\nempirically (J. Jackson & Cheetham 1999; Hunt 2007; Uyeda, Hansen,\nArnold, & Pienaar 2011).\n\nOne other philosophical issue raised by PE concerns the explanation of\nevolutionary stasis (Turner 2017). Eldredge and Gould never really\noffered a very clear account of the mechanism(s) that could maintain\nstasis, a fact that critics often seized upon (e.g., Coyne &\nCharlesworth 1996). They did propose that species might be homeostatic\nsystems. To make matters worse, there is a mismatch between the fossil\nevidence (where stasis is common) and studies of extant populations\nthat show lots of directional evolutionary change (Price, Grant,\nGibbs, & Boag 1984; Endler 1986; Lenski & Travisano 1994;\nHarshman & Hoffmann 2000), a puzzle sometimes called the\n\u201cparadox of stasis\u201d (Hendry 2007). Many evolutionary\nbiologists (e.g. Estes and Arnold 2007) are quick to attribute stasis\nat larger scales to well-known processes such as stabilizing selection\nand/or habitat tracking, but Kaplan (2009) raises some critical\nquestions about that move. And Sterelny (2001b) has pointed out that\ncases of \u201ccoordinated stasis\u201d in the fossil record pose\nspecial explanatory challenges. Coordinated stasis is a pattern where\na whole ecological assemblage seems to persist without change for\nmillions of years. Stasis, the idea at the heart of PE, remains an\nissue of considerable theoretical and empirical interest in\npaleontology (Lidgard & Hopkins 2015; Lidgard & Love\n2018).\n",
