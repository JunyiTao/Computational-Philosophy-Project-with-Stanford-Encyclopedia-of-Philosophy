A learner for \\(\\mathbf{H}\\)\nmaps a finite sequence of observations to a hypothesis in\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\). For example in the New Riddle of Induction, the\nnatural projection is a learner for the hypothesis set \\(\\mathbf{H}\\)\nthat comprises \u201call emeralds are green\u201d, \\(H_1 =\\)\n\u201call emeralds are grue(1)\u201d, \\(H_2 =\\) \u201call emeralds\nare grue(2)\u201d, etc. for all critical times \\(t\\). A\nlearner reliably identifies, or simply identifies, a\ncorrect hypothesis from \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if for every complete data\nsequence the following holds: if \\(H\\) from \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is correct\nhypothesis for the data sequence, then there is a finite number of\nobservations such that the learner conjectures the correct hypothesis\n\\(H\\) for any further observations consistent with the data\nsequence. The generalizing method and the natural projection rule are\nexamples of reliable learners for their hypothesis sets.\n\n\nTheorem. There is a learner that reliably identifies\na correct hypothesis from \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if and only if each\nhypothesis \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is a finite or countable disjunction of\nrefutable hypotheses.\n\nFor the proof see Kelly [1996, Ch. 3.3].\n\n\nExample. For illustration, let\u2019s return to the\nornithological example with two alternative hypotheses: (1) all but\nfinitely many swans are white, and (2) all but finitely many swans are\nblack. As we saw, it is possible in the long run to reliably settle\nwhich of these two hypotheses is correct. Hence by the\ncharacterization theorem, each of the two hypotheses must be a\ndisjunction of refutable empirical claims. To see that this indeed is\nso, observe that \u201call but finitely many swans are white\u201d\nis logically equivalent to the disjunction\n\nat most 1 swan is black or at most 2 swans are black \u2026 or at\nmost \\(n\\) swans are black \u2026 or \u2026 ,\n\n\nand similarly for \u201call but finitely many swans are black\u201d.\nEach of the claims in the disjunction is refutable. For example, take\nthe claim that \u201cat most 3 swans are black\u201d. If this is\nfalse, more than 3 black swans will be found, at which point the claim\nis conclusively falsified. The figure below illustrates how the\nidentifiable hypotheses are structured as disjunctions of refutable\nhypotheses.\n\n\nFigure 5 [An extended description of figure 5 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nThe characterization theorem implies that we can think of a reliable\nmethod as adopting internal strengthened versions of the\noriginal hypotheses under investigation that are refutable. As the\nexample above shows, the theorem does not imply that the strengthened\nhypotheses are mutually exclusive (e.g.\u201cat most 3 swans are\nblack\u201d is consistent with \u201cat most 2 swans are\nblack\u201d.). A recent alternative characterization theorem due to\nBaltag, Gierasimczuk, and Smets [2015] provides an alternative\nstructural analysis where identifiable hypotheses are decomposed into\nmutually exclusive components, as follows.\n\nA hypothesis \\(H\\) is  verirefutable  if it is equivalent to\nthe conjunction of a verifiable and a refutable hypothesis (given\nbackground knowledge): \\(H = (V\\) and \\(R)\\) where \\(V\\) is verifiable\nand R is refutable. For example, the hypothesis \u201cexactly 2 swans\nare black\u201d is verirefutable, since it is equivalent to the\nconjunction of the verifiable hypothesis \u201cat least 2 swans are\nwhite\u201d and the refutable hypothesis \u201cat most 2 swans are\nwhite\u201d. The term \u201cverirefutable\u201d is due to [Genin\nand Kelly 2015]; it signifies that when a verirefutable hypothesis is\ntrue, there is some initial condition after which the hypothesis is\nrefutable, that is, the hypothesis will be falsified by data if it is\nfalse. Baltag et al. refer to verirefutable hypotheses as locally\nclosed. They establish the following characterization theorem for\nreliable learning [Baltag et al. 2015].\n\nTheorem. There is a learner that reliably identifies a correct\nhypothesis from \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if and only if each hypothesis \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is\nequivalent to a finite or countable disjunction of mutually exclusive\nverirefutable hypotheses.\n\n\nSince the verirefutable hypotheses are mutually exclusive, they\nconstitute a valid  refined  hypothesis space whose members\nentail exactly one of the original hypothesis. The characterization\ntheorem entails that without loss of learning power, inductive methods\ncan transform the original hypothesis space into a verirefutable one.\nThe figure below illustrates the decomposition into verirefutable\nhypotheses.\n\n\nFigure 6 [An extended description of figure 6 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nA few points will help explain the significance of characterization\ntheorems.\n\nStructure of Reliable Methods. Characterization theorems tell\nus how the structure of reliable methods is attuned to the structure\nof the hypotheses under investigation. For example, the theorem\nmentioned establishes a connection between falsifiability and\ntestability, but one that is more attenuated than the na\u00efve\nPopperian envisions: it is not necessary that the hypotheses under\ntest be directly falsifiable; rather, there must be ways of\nstrengthening each hypothesis that yield a countable number of\nrefutable \u201csubhypotheses\u201d. We can think of these refutable\nsubhypotheses as different ways in which the main hypothesis may be\ntrue. (For example, one way in which \u201call but finitely many\nswans are white\u201d is true is if there are are at most 10 black\nswans; another is if there are at most 100 black swans, etc.).\nStrengthening the original hypotheses so they become empirically\nrefutable matches the spirit of\n Lakatos\u2019s methodology\n in which a general scientific paradigm is articulated with auxiliary\nhypotheses to define testable (i.e., falsifiable) claims.\nImport of Background Assumptions. The characterization result\ndraws a line between the solvable and unsolvable problems. Background\nknowledge reduces the inductive complexity of a problem; with enough\nbackground knowledge, the problem crosses the threshold between the\nunsolvable and the solvable. In many domains of empirical inquiry, the\npivotal background assumptions are those that make reliable inquiry\nfeasible. (Kuhn [1970] makes related points about the importance of\nbackground assumptions embodied in a \u201cparadigm\u201d).\nLanguage Invariance. Learning-theoretic characterization\ntheorems concern what Kelly calls the \u201ctemporal\nentanglement\u201d of various observation sequences [Kelly 2000].\nUltimately they rest on entailment relations between given evidence,\nbackground assumptions and empirical claims. Since logical entailment\ndoes not depend on the language we use to frame evidence and\nhypotheses, the inductive complexity of an empirical problem as\ndetermined by the characterization theorems is\nlanguage-invariant.\n\n",
