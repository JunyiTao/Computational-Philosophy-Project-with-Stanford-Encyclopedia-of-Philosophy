    "main_text": "Evaluating Computational Philosophy || Critiques\n4.2 Prospects and Undeveloped Aspects\n\nPhilosophy at its best has always been in contact with the conceptual\nand scientific methodologies of its time. Computational philosophy can\nbe seen as a contemporary instantiation of that contact, crossing\ndisciplinary boundaries in order to both influence and benefit from\ndevelopments in computer science and artificial intelligence.\nIncorporation of new technologies and wider application within\nphilosophy can be expected and should be hoped for.\n\nThere is one extremely promising area in need of development within\ncomputational philosophy, though that area may also call for changes\nin conceptions of philosophy itself. Philosophy has classically been\nconceived as abstract rather than concrete, as seeking understanding\nat the most general level rather than specific prediction or\nretrodiction, often normative, and as operating in terms of logical\nargument and analysis rather than empirical data. The last of these\ncharacteristics, and to some extent the first, will have to be\nqualified if computational philosophy grows to incorporate a major\nbatch of contemporary techniques: those related to big data.\n\nExpansion of computational philosophy in the intersection with big\ndata seems an exciting prospect for social and political philosophy,\nin the analysis of belief change, and in understanding the social and\nhistorical dynamics of philosophy of science (Overton 2013; Pence\n& Ramsey 2018). A particular benefit would be better prospects for\nvalidation of a range of simulations and agent-based models, as\nemphasized above (M\u00e4s 2019; Reijula & Kuorikoski 2019). If\ncomputational philosophy moves in that promising direction, however,\nit may take on a more empirical character in some respects. Emphasis\non general and abstract understanding and concern with the normative\nwill remain marks of a philosophical approach, but the membrane\nbetween some topic areas in philosophy and aspects of computational\nscience can be expected to become more permeable.\n\nDissolving these disciplinary boundaries may itself be a good in some\nrespects. The examples presented above make it clear that in\nincorporating (and contributing to) computational techniques developed\nin other areas, computational philosophy has long been\ncross-disciplinary. If our gain is a better understanding of the\ntopics that have long fascinated us, compromise in disciplinary\nboundaries and a change in our concept of philosophy seem a small\nprice to pay.\n",
