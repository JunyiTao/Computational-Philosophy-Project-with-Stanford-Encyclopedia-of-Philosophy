    "main_text": "Marxism and Leninism\n4. Marxism and Leninism\n\nIn recent years, scholars have devoted less attention to the debates\non colonialism within the Marxist tradition. This reflects the waning\ninfluence of Marxism in the academy and in political practice.\nMarxism, however, has influenced both post-colonial theory and\nanti-colonial independence movements around the world. Marxists have\ndrawn attention to the material basis of European political expansion\nand developed concepts that help explain the persistence of economic\nexploitation after the end of direct political rule.\n\nAlthough Marx never developed a theory of colonialism, his analysis of\ncapitalism emphasized its inherent tendency to expand in search of new\nmarkets. In his classic works such as The Communist\nManifesto, Grundrisse, and Capital, Marx\npredicted that the bourgeoisie would continue to create a global\nmarket and undermine both local and national barriers to its own\nexpansion. Expansion is a necessary product of the core dynamic of\ncapitalism: overproduction. Competition among producers drives them to\ncut wages, which in turn leads to a crisis of under-consumption. The\nonly way to prevent economic collapse is to find new markets to absorb\nexcess consumer goods. From a Marxist perspective, some form of\nimperialism is inevitable. By exporting population to resource rich\nforeign territories, a nation creates a market for industrial goods\nand a reliable source of natural resources. Alternately, weaker\ncountries can face the choice of either voluntarily admitting foreign\nproducts that will undermine domestic industry or submitting to\npolitical domination, which will accomplish the same end.\n\nIn a series of newspaper articles published in the 1850s in the\nNew York Daily Tribune, Marx specifically discussed the\nimpact of British colonialism in India. His analysis was consistent\nwith his general theory of political and economic change. He described\nIndia as an essentially feudal society experiencing the painful\nprocess of modernization. According to Marx, however, Indian\n\u201cfeudalism\u201d was a distinctive form of economic\norganization. He reached this conclusion because he believed\n(incorrectly) that agricultural land in India was owned communally.\nMarx used the concept of \u201cOriental despotism\u201d to describe\na specific type of class domination that used the state\u2019s power\nof taxation in order to extract resources from the peasantry.\nAccording to Marx, oriental despotism emerged in India because\nagricultural productivity depended on large-scale public works such as\nirrigation that could only be financed by the state. This meant that\nthe state could not be easily replaced by a more decentralized system\nof authority. In Western Europe, feudal property could be transformed\ngradually into privately owned, alienable property in land. In India,\ncommunal land ownership made this impossible, thereby blocking the\ndevelopment of commercial agriculture and free markets. Since\n\u201cOriental despotism\u201d inhibited the indigenous development\nof economic modernization, British domination became the agent of\neconomic modernization.\n\nMarx\u2019s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing\nmodernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent\nrationalization for foreign domination. His account of British\ndomination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows\ntowards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the\nimmense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to\nbourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both\nnecessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration\nof foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India. For Marx,\nthis upheaval has both positive and negative consequences. When\npeasants lose their traditional livelihoods, there is a great deal of\nhuman suffering, but he also points out that traditional village\ncommunities are hardly idyllic; they are sites of caste oppression,\nslavery, misery, and cruelty. The first stage of the modernization\nprocess is entirely negative, because poor people pay heavy taxation\nto support British rule and endure the economic upheaval that results\nfrom the glut of cheaply produced English cotton. Eventually, however,\nBritish merchants begin to realize that Indians cannot pay for\nimported cloth or British administration if they don\u2019t\nefficiently produce goods to trade, which provides an incentive for\nBritish investment in production and infrastructure. Even though Marx\nbelieved that British rule was motivated by greed and exercised\nthrough cruelty, he felt it was still the agent of progress. Thus,\nMarx\u2019s discussion of British rule in India has three dimensions:\nan account of the progressive character of foreign rule, a critique of\nthe human suffering involved, and a concluding argument that British\nrule must be temporary if the progressive potential is to be\nrealized.\n\nLenin developed his analysis of Western economic and political\ndomination in his pamphlet Imperialism: The Highest Stage of\nCapitalism (1917) (see Other Internet Resources). Lenin took a\nmore explicitly critical view of imperialism. He noted that\nimperialism was a technique which allowed European countries to put\noff the inevitable domestic revolutionary crisis by exporting their\nown economic burdens onto weaker states. Lenin argued that\nlate-nineteenth century imperialism was driven by the economic logic\nof late-capitalism. The falling rate of profit caused an economic\ncrisis that could only be resolved through territorial expansion.\nCapitalist conglomerates were compelled to expand beyond their\nnational borders in pursuit of new markets and resources. In a sense,\nthis analysis is fully consistent with Marx, who saw European\ncolonialism as continuous with the process of internal expansion\nwithin states and across Europe. Both Marx and Lenin thought that\ncolonialism and imperialism resulted from the same logic that drove\nthe economic development and modernization of peripheral areas in\nEurope. But there was one distinctive element of Lenin\u2019s\nanalysis. Since late capitalism was organized around national\nmonopolies, the competition for markets took the form of military\ncompetition between states over territories that could be dominated\nfor their exclusive economic benefit.\n\nMarxist theorists including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, and Nikolai\nBukharin also explored the issue of imperialism. Kautsky\u2019s\nposition is especially important because his analysis introduced\nconcepts that continue to play a prominent role in contemporary world\nsystems theory and post-colonial studies. Kautsky challenges the\nassumption that imperialism would lead to the development of the areas\nsubjected to economic exploitation. He suggests that imperialism is a\nrelatively permanent relationship structuring the interactions between\ntwo types of countries. (Young 2001) Although imperialism initially\ntook the form of military competition between capitalist countries, it\nwould result in collusion between capitalist interests to maintain a\nstable system of exploitation of the non-developed world. The most\ninfluential contemporary proponent of this view is Immanuel\nWallerstein, who is known for world-systems theory. According to this\ntheory, the world-system is a relatively stable set of relations\nbetween core and peripheral states. This international division of\nlabor is structured to benefit the core states (Wallerstein\n1974\u20131989) and transfers resources from the periphery to the\ncore.\n",
