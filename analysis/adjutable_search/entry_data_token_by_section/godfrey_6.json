    "main_text": "Philosophical Knowledge of God\u2019s Existence\n7. Philosophical Knowledge of God\u2019s Existence\n\n\nAccording to Godfrey, insofar as a natural knowledge of God is\naccessible to human reason, it belongs more properly to metaphysics\nthan does knowledge of any other being. And he clearly holds that God\u2019s\nexistence can be established by philosophical reasoning. But Avicenna\nand Averroes had differed concerning whether it belongs to natural\nphilosophy (physics) or to metaphysics to demonstrate this conclusion.\nAvicenna had maintained that this task pertains to metaphysics and only\nto metaphysics, whereas Averroes had defended the opposite position\nthat only physics can demonstrate the existence of God, the First Mover\n(Wippel, 1981, 102\u20133). As will be seen more fully in the following\nsection, Godfrey defends something of a compromise position. In\nQuodlibet XI, q. 1 he mentions that the metaphysician\u2019s consideration\nof God in himself is more perfect than that of the natural philosopher,\nwho simply views him as the First Mover of the first mobile being,\ni.e., the outermost heavenly sphere. But, Godfrey adds, by reason of\nall that God is in himself, he is also the First Mover (PB 5.3). In\nQuodlibet V, q. 10 he writes that one can know by reasoning from\nnatural things that God is the first being which depends on nothing\nwhatsoever and upon which everything else depends and, therefore, that\nhe is the causal and productive principle of all other things (PB 3.41;\nWippel, 1981, 105). And in Quodlibet IX, q. 20, he refers to different\nthings that natural reason can know in metaphysics with certainty about\nGod\u2014that because he is the first being he is simple; that he is\nbeing in actuality; that he is an intellectual being, etc. (PB\n4.288).\n",
