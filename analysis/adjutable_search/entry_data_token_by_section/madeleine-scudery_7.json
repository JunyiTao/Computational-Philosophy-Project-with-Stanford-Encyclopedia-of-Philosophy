    "main_text": "Philosophy || Aesthetics\n3.5 Aesthetics\n\nIn the dialogues Scud\u00e9ry develops a philosophy of art that\nlargely adheres to neoclassical aesthetics. Art is the imitation of\nnature; nature itself possesses an internal harmony reflective of the\nhidden divine beauty. In her emphasis on the individuality of artistic\nperception and of the individual work of art, however, Scud\u00e9ry\nadds her own subjectivist account of art to the classical mimetic\ntheory to which she subscribes.\n\nOf Magnificence and Of Magnanimity presents\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s mimetic theory of art in capsule form. All art\nrepresents an imitation of nature, \u201cnature\u201d here being\nunderstood as the physical world. \u201cArt has imitated what Nature\nhas made in different places of the world\u201d [CN, 1: 23].\nEach art imitates a particular section of nature. Dance, for example,\nimitates the motion of the stars. \u201cThe people who invented dance\ntook the order and movement of the stars as their model\u201d\n[CN, 1: 38]. Through artistic mimesis, a distinctive sector\nof the natural world is transmuted into a particular genre of art. It\nis this specialized study of material nature that explains the\ndemarcation among the various genres constituting the beaux\narts.\n\nBeauty does not lie solely in the work fashioned by the artist; nature\nitself manifests a complex beauty in each of its discrete parts.\nObservations on Butterflies details the beauty to be found in\nthe structure of the butterfly, one of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s favored\nobjects of scientific observation. \n\n\nThe wings of these little animals account for what is most admirable\nin them. Each butterfly has four wings; their wings are so well\ncoordinated that it seems the butterflies have only two wings when we\nwatch them flying. Their structure is marvelous. They are made of a\nkind of cartilage\u2026which colors the wings of these little\nanimals. It makes them appear thin and transparent, like a fine piece\nof parchment or like a very dry and very clear stroke of the brush.\n[EM, 2: 309] \n\n\nThe artistic construction of a work of art rests on the careful\nimitation of a nature whose intricate structure already expresses a\nharmony matching the beauty produced by the finest artisans and\nartists.\n\nThe artistic mimesis defended by Scud\u00e9ry does not entail a\nservile imitation of nature. On the contrary, each work of art\nrepresents an idiosyncratic interpretation of nature which reflects\nthe unique temperament, style, history, and skill of the individual\nartist. The practice of painting reflects the individual differences\nwhich emerge in works based on careful observation of the same\nphysical object in the same studio setting. \n\n\nIn celebrated academies of painting they have often presented one\nsingle model to the same view of all the artists. They saw him; they\nobserved him; he gave them all the time they wanted without changing\nhis position. Still, I can assure you that even those who depict him\nfrom the same angle will show notable differences in their works.\n[CN, 1: 450] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry adds a subjectivist note to the mimetic account of art.\nAlthough the artist imitates external nature, in fact a single precise\nexternal object in nature, the final work of art portraying that\nnature will bear the idiosyncratic stamp and style of the individual\nartist. Even at its most realistic, the artwork cannot be reduced to a\nfacsimile of the physical cosmos.\n\nAs in the rest of her philosophy, moral considerations weigh heavily\nin Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophy of art. Since art powerfully\nshapes the moral imagination of those who view it, the artist must\nproduce an art that reflects the moral order as well as the physical\norder of nature. Her strictures on the composition of fables, a\nfavorite salon literary genre, express Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s concern\nfor the moral rectitude of the artwork. \n\n\nIt [the fable] should censure vice and reward\nvirtue\u2026.Imagination should always be subordinate to judgment.\nExtraordinary events should be clearly justified\u2026.The style\nshould be neither too elevated nor too low. Nowhere should social\nconventions or morals be offended. [CDS, 2: 475] \n\n\nThe moral strictures on art also reflect the rationalism of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s aesthetics. Even in the realm of the fable, the\nreasonable and the measured should trump the imaginative and the\nfantastic.\n\nGiven its moral pedagogical power, art should be a major political\nconcern. The state should vigorously promote art that both edifies and\npleases by its aesthetic quality. Good public art is particularly apt\nto promote the aristocratic virtues. \u201cWhen the prince promotes\nthem, the love of science and the beaux arts is very helpful\nin establishing the practice of politeness\u201d [CN, 1:\n185]. In her censure of the vice of sloth, Scud\u00e9ry singles out\nfor criticism the indolent artists who do not make the contribution\nthey could make to society\u2019s artistic heritage and moral\natmosphere.\n",
