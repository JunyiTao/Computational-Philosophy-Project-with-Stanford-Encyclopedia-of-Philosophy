    "main_text": "Beneficence in Business Ethics\n7. Beneficence in Business Ethics\n\n\nBusiness ethics is a second area of applied ethics in which\nquestions about beneficence have emerged as central. Hume\u2019s immediate\nsuccessor in sentiment theory, Adam Smith, held an important view about\nthe role and place of benevolence that has influenced a number of\nwriters in business ethics. Smith argued that the wealth of nations and\nthe well-being of their citizens are dependent upon social\ncooperation\u2014fundamentally, political and economic\ncooperation\u2014but that this realm is not dependent on the\nbenevolence of moral relations. Smith proposes that it would be vain\nfor us to expect benevolence in market societies. In commercial\ntransactions the only successful strategy in motivating persons is to\nappeal to personal advantage: Never expect benevolence from a butcher,\nbrewer, or baker; expect from them only a regard to their own interest.\nMarket societies operate not by concerns of humanity and benevolence,\nbut from self-love.\n",
