    "main_text": "The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading || Constitution or Causation?\n4.2 Constitution or Causation?\n\nSome Simulation Theorists defend a strong view of\nsimulation-based mindreading (Gordon 1986, 1995, 1996; Gallese et al.\n2004; Gallese & Sinigaglia 2011). They maintain that many\nsimulation-based mindreading events are (entirely)\nconstituted by mental simulation events (where mental\nsimulation events are simulated mental states or simulation\nprocesses). In other words, some Simulation Theorists claim that,\non many occasions, the fact that a subject S is\nrepresenting someone else\u2019s mental states is nothing over and\nabove the fact that S is undergoing a mental simulation event:\nthe former fact reduces to the latter. For example, Lisa\u2019s\nundergoing a mirrored disgust experience as a result of observing\nJohn\u2019s disgusted face would count as a mindreading event:\nLisa\u2019s simulated mental state would represent John\u2019s\ndisgust (Gallese et al. 2004). Let us call this \u201cthe\nConstitution View\u201d.\n\nWe shall elaborate on the details of the Constitution View in\n section 4.3.\n Before doing that, we consider an argument that has been directed\nagainst it over and over again, and which is supposed to show that the\nConstitution View is a non-starter (Fuller 1995; Heal 1995; Goldman\n2008b; Jacob 2008, 2012). Lacking a better name, we will call it\n\u201cthe Anti-Constitution argument\u201d. Here it is. By\ndefinition, a mindreading event is a mental event in which a subject,\nS, represents another subject, Q, as having a certain\nmental state M. Now\u2014the argument continues\u2014the\nonly way in which S can represent Q as having\nM is this: S has to employ the concept of that\nmental state and form the judgment, or the belief,\nthat Q is in M. Therefore, a mindreading event is\nidentical to an event of judging that someone else has a certain\nmental state (where this entails the application of mentalistic\nconcepts). It follows from this that mental simulation events cannot\nbe constitutive of mindreading events, since the former events are not\nevents of judging that someone else has a certain mental state. An\nexample should clarify the matter. Consider Lisa again, who is\nundergoing a mirrored disgust experience as a result of\nobserving John\u2019s disgusted face. Clearly, undergoing such a\nsimulated disgust experience is a different mental event from\njudging that John is experiencing disgust. Therefore,\nLisa\u2019s mental simulation does not constitute a mindreading\nevent.\n\nIn\n section 4.3,\n we will discuss how the defenders of the Constitution View have\nresponded to this argument. Suppose for the moment that the\nAnti-Constitution argument is sound. What alternative pictures of\nsimulation-based mindreading are available? Those Simulation Theorists\nwho reject the Constitution View tend to endorse the Causation\nView, according to which mental simulation events never\nconstitute mindreading events, but only causally contribute\nto them. The best developed version of this view is Goldman\u2019s\n(2006) Three-Stage Model (again, this is our label, not his),\nwhose basic structure is as follows:\n\n\nSTAGE 1. Mental simulation: Subject S undergoes a\nsimulation process, which outputs a token simulated mental state\nm*.\n\nSTAGE 2. Introspection: S introspects m* and\ncategorizes/conceptualizes it as (a state of type)\nM.\n\nSTAGE 3. Judgment: S attributes (a state of type)\nM to another subject, Q, through the judgment\nQ is in M.\n\n(The causal relations among these stages are such that: STAGE 1 causes\nSTAGE 2, and STAGE 2 in turn causes STAGE 3. See Spaulding 2012 for a\ndiscussion of the notion of causation in this context.)\n\n\nHere is our trite example. On the basis of observing John\u2019s\ndisgusted facial expression, Lisa comes to judge that John is\nhaving a disgust experience. How did she arrive at the formation of\nthis judgment? Goldman\u2019s answer is as follows. The observation\nof John\u2019s disgusted facial expression triggered a disgust\nmirroring process in Lisa, resulting in Lisa\u2019s undergoing a\nmirrored disgust experience (STAGE 1). This caused Lisa to introspect\nher simulated disgust experience and to categorize it as a disgust\nexperience (STAGE 2) (the technical notion of introspection used by\nGoldman will be discussed in\n section 4.4).\n This, in turn, brought about the formation of the judgment John\nis having a disgust experience (STAGE 3). Given that, according\nto Goldman, mindreading events are identical to events of judging that\nsomeone else has a certain mental state, it is only this last stage of\nLisa\u2019s cognitive process that constitutes a mindreading event.\nOn the other hand, the previous two stages were merely causal\ncontributors to it. But mental simulation entirely took place at STAGE\n1. This is why the Three-Stage Model is a version of the Causation\nView: according to the model, mental simulation events causally\ncontribute to, but do not constitute, mindreading events.\n",
