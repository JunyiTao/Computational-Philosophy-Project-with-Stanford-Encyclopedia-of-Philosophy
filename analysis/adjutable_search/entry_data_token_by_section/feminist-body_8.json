    "main_text": "Intersectionality\n4. Intersectionality\n\nBoth the foundational status and the inevitability\nof sexual difference has become a key point of contention between\nsexual difference theorists and intersectional theorists whose work is\nanchored particularly in black feminist thought (Crenshaw 2019, Hill\nCollins and Bilge 2016 ), but also in contributions from theorists of bodily\nabilities and trans theorists. (Garland-Thomson 2002, Bettcher and Garry\n2009, Koyama 2006) These\ntheorists challenge the priority of sexual difference, in our accounts\nof embodied subjectivity, and the possibility of providing generic\naccounts of what such difference consists in. What counts as\nbeing a man or a woman, what life opportunities result from gendered\npositionality, and how these factors are internalized to form our\nlived experience of being gendered, is mediated by the other\ncategories which intersect with gendered ones. Being a \u201cblack\nman/woman\u201d, or \u201cgay man/woman\u201d, or \u201ctrans\nman/woman\u201d (themselves categories which also mediate each other\nand are mediated further by, for example, nationality, religion, age,\nclass and our positioning on the ability/disability axis), each has a\ndifferent content from being a \u201cwhite, straight, middleclass,\ncis gendered, able bodied woman or man\u201d. The normative ideals\nattached to the concepts are different, though also overlapping. These\npositionalities have consequences for our life opportunities both\neconomically and in the wider social realm, which the structural data\nmake evident. And all of this has consequences for our lived\nsubjectivity, how we experience our bodies, our sense of ourselves as\nmale or female, amongst other identifiers. \n\nBlack feminist critiques challenge the racism of mainstream white\nfeminist thought for theorizing womanhood from the perspective of\nwhite women thereby rendering the particular experiences of black and\nother groups of marginalized women invisible. Audre Lorde writes:\n\n\nAs a Black lesbian feminist comfortable with the many ingredients of\nmy identity, and a woman committed to racial and sexual freedom of\nexpression, I find I am constantly being encouraged to pluck out some\naspect of myself and present this as a meaningful whole, eclipsing or\ndenying the other parts of self. But this is a destructive and\nfragmenting way to live. (Lorde 1984) \n\n\nTwo centuries earlier Sojourner Truth, in her famous\n\u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech at Seneca Falls (see above)\nsignalled the very different modes of embodiment for black slave women\nand white bourgeois women. The coining of the term intersectionality\nis often accredited to African-American civil rights advocate and\nfeminist and critical race scholar, Kimberle Crenshaw (2019). As black\nwomen we do not experience racism AND sexism as separate discrete\nstrands of oppression, Crenshaw argues, but instead racism and sexism\nintersect and combine to shape the lives, including the experiences of\nembodiment, of black women, in very specific ways. This is not a\nmatter of adding on experiences of being raced to a foundational sexed\nidentity. What constitutes being a woman is inter-articulated with\nbeing black, in ways that challenge the universalism of sexual\ndifference theory.\n\nDisability theorists from the 1990s onwards explored how disability\naffected the gendering process and gender the experiences and outcomes\nof differing bodily abilities (Mairs 1990, Thomas 1999). Feminist\ntheory, as Garland-Thomson argues: \n\n\ninterrogates how subjects are multiply interpellated; in other words,\nhow the representational systems of gender race, ethnicity, ability,\nsexuality and class mutually construct, inflect and contradict one\nanother. (2002: 3) \n\nthe status of the lived body, the politics of appearance, the\nmedicalisation of the body, the privilege of normalcy (2002: 4) \n\n\nall look different from the perspective of women regarded as disabled.\nAnd the relative privileges of normative femininity are often denied\nto these women. Such work by intersectional feminists challenge any\nfoundational role, or universal articulation of, sexed difference\nitself.\n",
