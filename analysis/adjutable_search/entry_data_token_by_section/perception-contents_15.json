    "main_text": "The Representation of Objects || Causal and Non-Causal Contents\n5.2 Causal and Non-Causal Contents\n\nOf the three proposals considered so far, the two that posit\nobject-involving contents ((1) and the multiple-content proposal (2))\npredict that the cube experience will be falsidical. Searle (1983)\ndefends a fourth proposal about how objects are represented in\nexperience that makes the same prediction, but without positing\nobject-involving contents. He proposes that when you see the cube, you\nexperientially entertain complex contents of the following form:\n\n(4) There is a red cube at L, and the fact that there is a\nred cube at L is causing this experience.\n\n\nSearle\u2019s proposal predicts that the cube experience is\nfalsidical, because the fact that there is a red cube at L is\nnot causing your experience, and the second clause of his\ncomplex existentially quantified contents says that it is. According\nto Searle, this proposal also reflects the phenomenology of\nparticularity.\n\nSearle\u2019s proposal entails that in experiences of seeing objects,\nthe experience itself is represented (note the occurrence of\n\u2018this experience\u2019 in (4)). Armstrong, Burge, Soteriou and\nothers have objected to Searle\u2019s proposal on the grounds that\nthese contents are too cognitively sophisticated to be contents of\nexperiences of seeing. They argue that only sophisticated creatures\nhave the cognitive resources needed for this form of self-reference,\nand plenty of creatures can have visual experiences of seeing objects\neven while lacking these resources; so such self-reference cannot be a\nnecessary condition for visually experiencing objects. Another\nobjection, also raised by Armstrong, Burge and Soteriou, is that\ncausal relations between experiences and facts are not represented in\nexperience. Armstrong claims that this too is overly sophisticated;\nBurge claims that it is not part of the phenomenology of visual\nexperience. The debate turns on exactly what cognitive resources are\nneeded for an experience to represent (a) itself, and (b) causal\nrelations between itself and other things. If one denies that causal\nrelations of any sort can be represented in experience, then one will\nthink Searle\u2019s view is false.\n\nIn principle several replies to these objections are open to defenders\nof Searle\u2019s position. First, they can claim that what is needed\nfor representations of (a) and (b) is not so cognitively sophisticated\nafter all. Second, they can deny that the cognitively sophisticated\nand cognitively unsophisticated creatures have experiences with the\nsame contents. Third, they can argue that such causal relations really\nare present in visual phenomenology, for example by contrasting visual\nexperiences of seeing objects with visual experiences of imagining\nthem. Searle himself pursues the last strategy in his 1989.\n5.3 Are Ordinary Objects Represented?\n\nThe discussion so far has assumed that ordinary objects are\nrepresented in at least some experiences. Some philosophers assume\nthat ordinary objects are represented in visual experience, but this\nis a matter of some controversy. According to theories on which visual\nexperience represents only very low-level properties, such as color,\nthe shapes of facing surfaces, their illumination properties and\nnothing more, visual experience does not carry information about\nwhether any of the facing surfaces belong to the same ordinary object,\nand does not carry information about whether there are any ordinary\nobjects in the immediate environment at all. Instead, visual\nexperience represents that low-level properties are instantiated at\ncertain locations, without taking a stand on whether ordinary objects\nare instantiating them. A version of this view is defended by Austen\nClark (2000, ch. 5), who argues that experience represents colors (and\nperhaps other low-level properties) instantiated in regions of\nspace-time around the perceiver, and nothing else. In Clark\u2019s\nterms, reference within experience is limited to reference to places:\nthese are the only things to which properties are attributed in\nexperience. Clark refines his view in 2004.\n5.4 Mind-Independence\n\nSome perceptual experiences arguably represent objects as existing\nindependently of the subject\u2019s mind (where something is\nmind-independent only if it does not depend for its existence on being\nperceived). One might think that representing that something exists\nindependently of being perceived is a precondition for representing\nthe occurrence of more mundane happenings in the external world, such\nas a tomato\u2019s being round, or a cat\u2019s sitting on a mat.\nRepresenting mind-independence is thus arguably a fundamental kind of\ncontent. In what different ways might experiences represent things as\nmind-independent?\n\nOne debate in this area (already mentioned in connection with spatial\nrepresentation) is whether a visual experience\u2019s representing\nthings as occupying three dimensions suffices to represent things as\nmind-independent (see Strawson 1958, Peacocke 1983, Smith 2002).\n\nAnother idea, prominent in the writings of Merleau-Ponty 1945 and\nHusserl 1900, is that some experiences are about things in the world\nexternal to the mind in virtue of representing possible interaction\nbetween the subject and the thing represented. For instance, according\nto one version of this view, a visual experience\u2019s representing\n(say) a bird as mind-independent consists (at least in part) in its\nrepresenting that if the subject moves relative to the bird, different\nparts of the bird will come into view, and that if something opaque\nmoves between the subject\u2019s eyes and the bird, then the bird\nwill be occluded. More generally, the idea is that an object looks\nmind-independent if it looks as if different perspectives on it may be\ntaken.\n\nIt is clear that subjects have some sort of expectations to this\neffect. But what concerns Merleau-Ponty and Husserl is what bearing\nthese expectations have on experience itself. These two philosophers\nagreed that experience would not be what it is without such\nexpectations; but they disagreed about how exactly they are\nincorporated into experience. According to Merleau-Ponty, the\n\u2018expectations\u2019 took the form of \u2018readiness\u2019 on\nthe part of the subject to move her body relative to an object in\norder to get a better view, if she so wished. Rather than posit mental\nstates that represent the possibility and possible results of\nsuch interaction, Merleau-Ponty thought that such representation was\nimplicit in the subject\u2019s own dispositions. This idea has been\ndeveloped in the literature on so-called \u2018embodied\ncognition\u2019 (see Clark 1997, Hurley 2000, Noe and O\u2019Regan\n2001). Husserl, in contrast, held that the subject\u2019s\nexpectations about how phenomenology would change with\nchanges in the perceiver\u2019s apparent movement were presented in\nexperience along with other properties, such as location and shape.\nSimilar ideas are developed in Smith 2002 and Siegel 2006b.\n\nA third idea in the area is that tactile experiences themselves, by\nvirtue of their phenomenology alone, represent things as external to\nthe subject\u2019s body. Consider the experience of grasping a\nrounded bottle. In experiencing the limits of one\u2019s body, one\nseems simultaneously to experience the surfaces of things external to\none. This seem to yield two ways of describing tactile phenomenology:\nit involves both a feeling of pressure, located roughly at the places\non the hands where the glass is touching; and a feeling of something\nspatially external to the body, located at the point where it touches\nthe body. Moreover, tactile experiences of grasping a rounded bottle\nseems to represent the surfaces touching each part of the hand as\nsurfaces that are part of the same object, so that it is also part of\nwhat the experience represents that the surfaces extend through space\nnot occupied by the body. If so, then tactile experiences represent\nboth happenings inside the body and things outside the body.\n\nNow, in principle something could exist in the space outside a\nsubject\u2019s body, yet not exist independently of that\nsubject\u2019s mind. But assuming that things outside the body are\nnot also internal to the mind, this would be a way of representing\nthings outside the mind as well. For further discussion of the\nrelation between tactile experience and mind-independence, see\nO\u2019Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1992b, Smith 2002, Condillac\n1947.\n6. Concepts and Content\n\nMany philosophers hold that beliefs and concepts are related\nin the following way: in order to have a belief that x is\nF, for any object x and any property F, a\nsubject must have concepts of the object and the property, and must\ndeploy those concepts in the belief. When concepts and\nbeliefs are related in this way, belief content is said to be\nconceptual. Call this view belief conceptualism\n(endorsed by Dretske 1981 and Martin 1992a, among others). Belief\nconceptualism is typically defended on the grounds that beliefs differ\nfrom one another according to which concepts one has. One can believe\nthat whales swim without believing that large sea-dwelling mammals\nswim, even though whales are large sea-dwelling mammals. According to\na common defense of belief conceptualism, the relevant beliefs differ\nin which concepts the thinker is deploying, and that explains how it\nis that someone can have one of these beliefs without the other.\nAccording to a related defense of belief conceptualism, it explains\nwhy some thinkers cannot have any thoughts about some subject matter.\nSuppose the thinker lacked the concept \u2018whale\u2019: she had no\nidea what whales were, nor even that there was such a thing. Arguably\nsuch a thinker could not believe that whales swim, that whales are\nblue, or anything else about whales. According to belief\nconceptualism, this is because she lacks the concept of a whale. A\nfull specification of belief conceptualism would require explicating\nwhat concepts are, and what it is to possess and deploy one.\n\nIf beliefs have conceptual content, a question arises about whether\nexperiences do as well. Here it is useful to distinguish between two\ntheses about experiences. The first concerns concepts explicitly, and\nis the straightforward analog of the thesis above.\n\nExperience conceptualism: For any object x and any\nproperty F, a subject has an experience as of x\nbeing F only if she has concepts of x and\nF, and deploys those concepts in the experience.\n\n\nThe second thesis says that the contents of experiences are the same\nkind of content as belief contents. This thesis does not mention\nconcepts explicitly.\n\nSame-content: For any experience as of an object x\nhaving a property F, if the experience has content\np, then it is possible to have a belief with content\np.\n\n\nIn principle two strands to the debate about the role of concepts in\nexperience contents can be distinguished: whether experiences have any\ncontents that cannot be believed, and whether concepts play the same\nrole in the contents of beliefs as they play in the contents of\nexperience. Some philosophers accept the same-content thesis and\nbelief-conceptualism but deny experience-conceptualism, e.g., Tye\n(2005). Speaks (2005, 2009) defends same-content thesis but denies\nexperience-conceptualism.\n6.1 Conceptualist Views of Content\n\nExperience conceptualism and the same-content thesis go naturally with\nthe views (discussed in\n Section 2.2\n above) that link the content of experience to the contents of\nbeliefs, either by identifying experiences with beliefs or with\ndispositions to form beliefs. However, McDowell (1994), Sedivy (1996)\nand Brewer (1999) endorse both theses while denying that experiences\nand beliefs are linked in either of these ways. They defend both\ntheses on the grounds that experiences can provide justification for\nbeliefs only if these theses are true. Peacocke (2001a), Byrne (1996),\nHeck (2000) and others have objected to these \u2018epistemic\u2019\ndefenses of experience conceptualism on the grounds that experience\ncan stand in inferential relations with beliefs if they have accuracy\nconditions, and they can have accuracy conditions even if experience\nconceptualism is false. (Earlier defenses of experience-conceptualism\nare found in Craig (1976) and Peacocke (1983)).\n\nDretske and Martin have argued against experience conceptualism on the\ngrounds that it cannot reflect the informational richness of\nexperience (see Dretske 1981, Martin 1992a, see also Bermudez and\nMacpherson 1999) and Chuard (2007). The main idea that experiences can\n(and typically do) convey information about so many objects,\nproperties and relations in the environment that it is implausible to\nsuppose in those cases that the subject could possess and deploy\nconcepts for every object, property and relation that experience\nrepresents. The richness argument thus has two main parts: the first\npart defending the alleged phenomenal and informational richness of\nexperience; the second defending that inference from richness to the\nfalsity of experiential conceptualism.\n\nMartin in his 1992a makes a version of the richness argument against\nexperiential conceptualism. His strategy is to consider cases in which\none remembers a perceived object or property that one did not notice\nat the time of the experience itself. In Martin\u2019s example,\nsomeone is looking for cufflinks in a drawer, and fails to see them\neven though they are right there in front of him; but later on, when\nremembering the look of the drawer\u2019s contents, realizes that the\ncufflinks were among them. The fact (if it is a fact) that one can\nhave such memories suggests that the cufflinks were perceived\nconsciously after all.\n\nHow is this sort of case supposed to counter experiential\nconceptualism? If deploying a concept of an object or property is\nsufficient for noticing it, then the fact that one can perceive\nsomething without noticing it implies that one can perceive something\nwithout forming a concept of it. And that in turn suggests that one\ncan represent an object or property in experience without forming a\nconcept of it\u2014contra experiential conceptualism.\n\nDretske develops the richness argument slightly differently. He\ndistinguishes between digital and analog ways of\nencoding information, where the difference between these is analogous\nto the difference between the way statements and pictures\n(respectively) encode information. When information that s is\nF is encoded in digital form (as in a sentence, for example),\nno extra information is carried in the encoding; but when information\nthat s if F is encoded in analog form (as in a\nphotograph, for example), extra information will usually be carried in\nthe encoding. After explicating the difference between analog and\ndigital encodings of information, Dretske (in his 1981) writes,\n\u201cThe traditional idea that knowledge, belief and thought involve\nconcepts while sensation (or sensory experience) does not is\nreflected in this coding difference\u201d. Dretske thinks that\nexperiences encode information in the analog way, whereas beliefs\nencode information in the digital way. This view targets both the\nsame-content thesis, and experiential conceptualism.\n\nA different argument against experiential conceptualism appeals to the\nidea that the contents of experience are sometimes very finely\ngrained. The idea here is that experiences often provide\ndetailed, determinate information, in contrast to thought. Consider\nthe case of color experience. If you have an experience as of\nsomething red, you will experience it as being a determinate shade of\nred. In contrast, if you think that something is red, there need not\nbe any determinate shade of red such that you think that it is that\nshade of red. It is worth noting that an experience could be\nfinely-grained without being informationally rich\u2014as a visual\nexperience would if it represented nothing but a uniform field\n(sometimes called a \u2018ganzfeld\u2019) of a single color.\n\nIn his 1995, Tye attacks experience-conceptualism using the example of\ndeterminate color properties, which he says can be represented in\nexperience even by subjects who lack concepts of them. A similar point\nis made by Raffman (1995) who discusses evidence that humans\nperceptually discriminate more shades of color than they remember and\nhave concepts of. It is supposed to be independently plausible that\nthe discriminated shades are represented in experience; so if the\nsubjects really do lack concepts of them, then experiential\nconceptualism is false. A similar line of thought is hinted at by\nEvans (1982), who asks (apparently rhetorically) \u201cDo we really\nunderstand the proposal that we have as many colour concepts as there\nare shades of colour that we can sensibly discriminate?\u201d\n(229).\n\nIn response to this line of thought, McDowell (1994) has proposed that\nthe subjects really do possess fine-grained color concepts, albeit\ndemonstrative ones. This proposal has sparked debate about\nwhat counts as possessing a demonstrative concept. One point of debate\nconcerns whether a subject counts as having a demonstrative concept of\na shade of color, only if she can re-identify the shade on subsequent\noccasions. If so, then McDowell\u2019s argument fails, since this is\nprecisely what human subjects cannot always do. It is a matter of\ncontroversy, however, whether having demonstrative concepts does\nrequire this (as Kelly 2001 argues), or whether there can be one-off\ndemonstrative concepts. Another point of debate raised by\nMcDowell\u2019s concerns whether it is possible to form demonstrative\nconcepts of the shade represented in experience in cases of illusion,\nwhen the shade represented in experience differs from the shade of the\nthing seen. If demonstrative concepts of color shades can pick out\nonly shades actually had by the thing demonstrated (as Heck 2000\ncontends), then again McDowell\u2019s argument fails. However, it is\nagain a matter of controversy whether demonstrative concepts are\nlimited in this way. Yet another point of debate in this area is\nwhether experience itself would be needed to anchor demonstrative\nconcepts in the first place \u2014 in which case, it is said, they\ncould not already be constituted by them (Heck defends this view).\n6.2 Varieties of Non-Conceptual Content\n\nThis section reviews some proposals about the contents of experience\nthat use the label \u2018non-conceptual content\u2019.\nScenario Content\n\nOne way to argue against the same-content thesis is to assume, or\nindependently defend, a theory of belief content, and then offer a\npositive account of experience content that differs from it. This is\nPeacocke\u2019s strategy in his 1992. (Note the change in view from\nexperiential conceptualism, which Peacocke defends in his 1983).\nPeacocke accepts belief conceptualism, and has the view that belief\ncontents are Fregean, composed of Fregean senses. Peacocke describes a\nkind of content called scenario content that is not composed\nof Fregean senses, but is the content of experiences. Scenario content\nis a set of ways of filling out the space around the perceiver,\nrelative to an origin and axes marking directions, that is consistent\nwith the perceiver\u2019s experience being veridical. Peacocke\nstresses that although spatial concepts may be needed to specify a\nscenario, those concepts need not be possessed by subjects whose\nexperiences have that scenario content. Thus, according to Peacocke,\nspatial properties (such as coming from the left of the perceiver, or\nbeing approximately three feet away) can be represented in\nexperiences, even when the subject lacks the concept \u2018to the\nleft\u2019 or \u2018being approximately three feet away\u2019. If\nexperiences have scenario content, and if Peacocke is right that the\nrelevant concepts are not required for experiences to have scenario\ncontent, then experience conceptualism is false (barring the necessary\naccompaniment to scenario content of other contents that can be had\nonly if the subject possesses and deploys concepts of the very ways of\nfilling out the space around the perceiver that are specified by\nscenario content).\n\nAccording to Peacocke, one role of scenario content is to make it\npossible for the subject to form demonstrative concepts, such as ones\nthat might naturally be expressed by that figure, that\ncolor, that shape, where the figure, color or shape\npicked out by the concept is one that is represented in experience.\nLike demonstrative expressions, demonstrative concepts pick out\ndifferent things on different occasions, and as Peacocke sees it the\nrole of experience is to anchor a demonstrative concept to its\nreferent. Positioned scenario content is the content of experience\nthat does this.\nProto-Propositional Content\n\nIn another example involving Mach figures (discussed in\n Section 4.2),\n one focuses on a single four-sided equilateral figure, and contrasts\nthe experience of seeing it as a square and seeing it as a diamond.\nThe experiences supposedly differ phenomenally. According to Peacocke,\nthere can be no difference in the scenario content of these\nexperiences, because they represent the space around the perceiver as\nfilled in in the same way. Rather, according to Peacocke, the\ndifference is in the way in which the very same shape\nproperty is represented in experience. The central claim in support of\nthis view is that the properties represented do not differ. In his\n(2001a) Peacocke offers two other examples in support of this claim.\nFirst, there are supposedly two ways of hearing the interval that\nsounds when middle C and F-sharp just above it are played on a piano:\none and the same interval, he says, can be heard as an augmented\nfourth, or as a diminished fifth. Second, a matrix of evenly spaced\ndots can be seen as a set of rows or a set of columns.\n\n\n\n\nThe multiple \u2018ways\u2019 in which the same property can be\nrepresented, according to Peacocke, are not modes of presentation of\nthe sort that constitute the contents of beliefs. In the three\nputative examples of single properties that are represented in\ndifferent ways (the four-sided figure, the middle C/F-sharp interval,\nand the arrangement of dots), there are (according to Peacocke)\nmultiple concepts in the vicinity that pick out the same shape,\ninterval, or arrangement. The concepts \u2018regular diamond\u2019\nand \u2018regular square\u2019, or simply two occurrences of\n\u2018that shape\u2019, one for each way of seeing the four-sided\nfigure; the concepts \u2018augmented fourth\u2019 and\n\u2018diminished fifth\u2019 in the case of the interval; and the\nconcepts \u2018row\u2019 and \u2018column\u2019 in the case of the\ndots. These concepts differ from the perceptual \u2018ways\u2019 of\nrepresenting the shape (or the interval or the dot-arrangement),\naccording to Peacocke, in that the perceptual \u2018ways\u2019 make\nit possible to acquire the concepts, and so cannot be identical with\nthem. In the case of the two demonstrative shape concepts, these are\nanchored to each shape by the experience of it, and in order to play\nthis role, they cannot be the same as demonstrative concepts (a point\nechoed by Heck). In his (1992), Peacocke uses the label\n\u2018proto-propositional content\u2019 for contents just described.\nThe discussion of these examples in his (2001) is intended to clarify\nthe 1992 discussion (see 2001, fn 14).\nThe State View\n\nAccording to the state view, an experience E has\nnon-conceptual content just in case (i) E has accuracy\nconditions; and (ii) the subject of E need not possess any of\nthe concepts used to specify E\u2019s correctness\nconditions. This thesis that experiences have non-conceptual content\nin this sense is sometimes called the state view of\nnon-conceptual content (Heck 2000), because it is only a condition on\nthe possession of concepts, rather than being a condition on the kind\nof content had by E. Note that while the state view is\nincompatible with experiential conceptualism (assuming that the\nconcepts required by the latter are those used in a canonical\nspecification), it is neutral on the same-content thesis. Consider a\nsubject who doesn\u2019t possess the concept RED29 (where red29 is a\nspecific shade of red), but whose experience represents something as\nbeing red29. Nothing in the state view prevents some other subject\nfrom believing the contents of the first subject\u2019s experience.\nSome philosophers (e.g., Crane 1992) have defended the state view\nusing arguments from richness and fine-grainedness of experience\n(reviewed in\n Section 6.1).\n Other defenses of the state view include Stalnaker (1998a).\n\nAnother kind of content that is called \u2018non-conceptual\ncontent\u2019 is Cussins\u2019 construction-theoretic\ncontent; this is introduced in\n Section 4.2.\n7. Content and Phenomenology\n\nAs the term \u2018experiences\u2019 is used here, it is definitional\nof experiences that they have a phenomenal character. If they have\ncontents as well, then a question arises as to how these two features\nare related. It is useful to contrast different views on the relation\nbetween the content of an experience and its phenomenology by\nconsidering phenomenally indistinguishable experiences, or\nexperiences with the \u2018same phenomenology\u2019, on the one\nhand; and experiences with the same content, on the other. A\npreliminary remark about this notion is in order.\n\nThe notion of phenomenal indistinguishability of unrepeatable\nexperiences cannot be defined as a statistical notion. Exactly how it\nshould be defined is a matter of controversy. Gottlob Frege and Moritz\nSchlick raised doubts about the coherence of the notion of\ninterpersonal phenomenal indistinguishability, (these\n\u2018Frege-Schlick\u2019 doubts are discussed by Stalnaker 2000,\nShoemaker 1981 and 1996) In addition, though phenomenal\nindistinguishability is commonly taken to be a sort of\nphenomenal sameness, some philosophers use the expression to\npick out a merely epistemic notion, involving experiences that\nsubjects cannot distinguish (for discussion, see T. Williamson (1990),\nMartin (2004), Siegel (2004), and entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.)\n Martin and Williamson regard it as a substantive claim that\nexperiences said to be \u2018phenomenally the same\u2019 have\nanything more than an epistemic property of indistinguishability in\ncommon.\n\nThere are several relations in which the content of an experience has\nbeen thought to stand to its phenomenology. One position holds that\ncontent suffices for phenomenology. A stronger position holds that the\ncontent of experience is identical with its phenomenology. A third\nposition is that the phenomenology of an experience determines its\ncontent. These positions and others are discussed below.\n7.1 Representationalism about Phenomenology\n\nRepresentationalism (or intentionalism) is the\nthesis that phenomenal properties are determined by representational\nproperties. The thesis is sometimes stated as the supervenience claim\nthat phenomenal properties supervene on the representational\nproperties of an experience, so that any two experiences that have the\nsame representational properties have the same phenomenology.\n\nRepresentationalism comes in many versions. One way in which versions\ndiffer is that they may be claims about all sensory experience, or\njust some kinds of sensory experience. (Tye 1995 defends a version of\nrepresentationalism about all sensory experience; most discussions to\ndate have focused on visual experience, as does Pautz 2010.)\n\nA challenge to across-the-board representationalism comes from\nexperiences in modalities where it is unclear whether the experiences\nrepresent happenings in the space outside the body, such as gustation,\nolfaction, and experiences of afterimages. However, the notion of\naccuracy conditions that defines the notion of content we\u2019ve\nbeen working with leaves it open whether those conditions pertain to\nthe world outside the mind or not. Consider whether olfactory\nexperiences represent anything about the smells or sources of smells\noutside the body (for discussion see Smith (2002), chapter 5, Batty\n2010, 2011, Richardson 2013). There is a coherent view on which an\nolfactory experience can have accuracy conditions, even if they are of\nthe form \u2018an odor like so is present to me\u2019. To take\nanother example, consider afterimages. According to Loar (2003),\nexperiences of afterimages represent \u2018luminous happenings in\nstrange spaces\u2019, which suggests that an experience of an\nafterimage could include a content roughly like \u2018there is a\nreddish luminous occurrence over there\u2019, where\n\u2018there\u2019 indicates a position in the \u2018strange\nspace\u2019. (Perhaps the experience is neutral about whether the\nspace is inside or outside the mind). The notion of accuracy\nconditions also leaves it open whether there could be accuracy\nconditions that were met whenever a subject had an experience with\nthose conditions. For instance, suppose that sense can be made of the\nnotion of \u2018mental space\u2019 or \u2018subjective\nspace\u2019, and that some experiences have accuracy conditions\nconcerning smells, tastes or afterimages that reside in such space.\nGiven these suppositions, one might think that whenever an experience\nrepresents that something occurs in such spaces, the experience is\naccurate. In opposition to this idea, Bengson (2013) argues that the\nvisual experiences of pink glow or seeing blackness, and the auditory\nexperience of ringing in the ears fail to attribute color, luminance,\nor auditory properties to anything at all, and so resist analysis in\nterms of accuracy conditions. \n\nAnother potential problem for across-the-board representationalism\nconcerns experiences in different sense-modalities. As stated,\nrepresentationalism requires that any two experiences with the same\ncontent have the same phenomenology, even if the experiences occur in\ndifferent sensory modalities. Seeing something square and touching\nsomething square are phenomenally different. If representationalism is\ntrue for both haptic-tactile and visual experiences, then these\nexperiences cannot have the same content. Normally two such\nexperiences would probably not have exactly the same content anyway,\nfor instance if the visual experience represented properties (e.g.,\ncolors) that the tactile experience didn\u2019t. But abstracting away\nfrom those differences, there is a strong intuition that the visual\nphenomenology correlated with visually representing squareness differs\nfrom the tactile phenomenology correlated with feeling something to be\nsquare. It seems that across-the-board representationalism must either\n(i) deny the intuition that the visual phenomenology correlated with\nvisually representing squareness differs from the tactile\nphenomenology correlated with feeling something to be square, or else\n(ii) deny that the contents related to representations of squareness\nreally are the same after all, so that each modality (or natural\ngrouping of modalities) has a special kind of content to call its own,\nand one cannot experience by one modality exactly the same thing as\none can experience by another. Response (ii) is illustrated by one\nanswer to Molyneux\u2019s question (see entry on\n Molyneux\u2019s problem)\n whether someone born blind and was familiar with the feel of a cube\ncould recognize a cube upon seeing it for the time, without also\ntouching it. If the answer to Molyneux\u2019s question is that the\npreviously blind person could not visually recognize cubes, one might\nconjecture that this is because the shape properties represented by\nvisual experience on the one hand and by haptic tactile experience on\nthe other differ.\n\nAnother response to this potential problem revises the thesis of\nrepresentationalism, construing the representational properties that\ndetermine phenomenology as attitude-content complexes rather than\ncontents alone. For example, Chalmers 2004 distinguishes pure\nrepresentational properties\u2014the property of having a\ncertain content\u2014from impure representational\nproperties\u2014the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in a certain way. Examples of impure representational\nproperties include the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in modality M, and that of having attitude\nA to a certain content. Impure representationalism\nis then the thesis that impure representational properties determine\nphenomenology, so that any two experiences with the same impure\nrepresentational properties have the same phenomenology. This position\nallows that experiences in different modalities, or experiences that\ninstantiate different attitudes, could have the same content, yet\ndiffer phenomenally because, say, one is visual and the other\nkinesthetic. For instance, perhaps both represent that one\u2019s\nhand is moving, or that something is round. Versions of impure\nrepresentationalism are held by Lycan 1996, Chalmers 2004, 2006, Pautz\n2010.\n7.2 Does Phenomenology Determine Content?\n\nThe converse of representationalism is the thesis (put roughly) that\nthe phenomenology of an experience determines its content. The thesis\nis often more precisely formulated as a supervenience claim. Two\ntheses here should be distinguished:\n\n(1) For any two phenomenally identical experiences, there are some\naccuracy conditions that they share.\n\n\n(2) Any two phenomenally identical experiences have the same accuracy\nconditions.\n\n\nClaim (2) says that all accuracy conditions are determined by\nphenomenology, claim (1) says that at least some are.\n\nClaim (1) constrains which contents experiences have. Shoemaker\ndevelops this idea in a series of papers (1994, 2005). See also\nChalmers (2004, 2005).\n\nThe two theses above are both entailed by a strong version of\nrepresentationalism, which combines representationalism with the\nthesis that any two experiences with the same phenomenal properties\nhave the same representational properties. This sort of\nrepresentationalism is sometimes held in the guise of an identity\nclaim: the claim that phenomenal properties are identical to\nrepresentational properties. Versions of this view are defended by\nDretske 1995, Tye 2000, and Carruthers 2000. But theses (1) and (2)\ncan be held even if one rejects these strong representationalist\ntheses. Some philosophers hold (1) on the grounds that the\nrepresentational content of an experience is grounded in its\nphenomenology. According to Horgan and Tienson 2002, for example,\nthere is a kind of content that experiences have in virtue of their\nphenomenology, so that their phenomenology has explanatory priority\nover the content itself. This view is suggested by Siewert (1998) and\ndefended by Kriegel (2002; 2013), and see entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.\n\n\nSome philosophers deny both (1) and (2) on the grounds that the\naccuracy-conditions of an experience are determined in part by\nextra-cranial features, while the phenomenology of an experience is\nnot. These philosophers are internalist about phenomenology, but\nexternalist about experience content. (Block 1990 and 1996, Speaks\n2009).\n8. Theories of Intentionality for Experience\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve discussed some reasons to think that there are\ncontentful experiences, and some questions about what sorts of\ncontents there might be. A different cluster of questions concerns\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the contents it does.\nHow is representation of any property is possible? Two sorts of\ntheories addressing this question are addressed in\n Section 8.2\n and\n Section 8.3,\n and some possible constraints on such theories are reviewed in\n Section 8.1.\n8.1 Externalism vs. Internalism About Perceptual Content\n\nExternalism about experience content (or\nexperience-content externalism) is the thesis that subjects\nalike in properties that are intrinsic to them need not share the same\nexperience contents. If experience-content externalism is true, then\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the content it does\ndepends on external relations to things outside the subject\u2019s\nskin, such as social relations between the subject and others, or\ncausal relations to things in the environment. Defenders of\nexperience-content externalism include Dretske, Lycan, and Tye, all of\nwhom argue for experiential externalism on the grounds that the\nalleged best naturalistic theories of intentionality for experience\nare externalist theories. (For discussion of externalism about the\ncontent of other mental states, see the entry on\n external theories of content.)\n\nA thesis opposed to experience-content externalism is\nexperience-content internalism. Put roughly, this is the\nthesis that experience content is determined entirely by the\nindividual\u2019s intrinsic properties. Total experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that all experience content is\ndetermined by the individual\u2019s intrinsic properties (i.e., that\ntwo subjects alike in all intrinsic respects will have exactly the\nsame experiential contents). Partial experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that there is a sort of\nexperiential content that is determined by a subject\u2019s intrinsic\nproperties (i.e., two subjects alike in all intrinsic respects will\nhave the same experiential contents of this sort. This thesis allows\nthat experiences may also have some externally determined contents.\nTotal experiential internalism is defended by Segal 1991 and Matthews\n1985; partial experience-content internalism is defended by Chalmers\n2004.\n\nExternalism and internalism about contents are distinct theses from\nexternalism and internalism about phenomenology. Internalism about\nphenomenology is the thesis that intrinsic duplicates are\nphenomenal duplicates. Externalism about phenomenology is the\ndenial of this thesis, on the grounds that phenomenology is determined\nin part by factors outside a subject\u2019s skin. Externalism about\nphenomenology is sometimes motivated by representationalism about\nphenomenology combined with externalism about content. If one is\nexternalist about experiential content, and if one holds that the\ncontent and the phenomenology of an experience co-vary, then one must\nalso be an externalist about phenomenology. This thesis is defended by\nDretske (1995) and Lycan (2001), and criticized by Block (1990) and\n(1996). For further discussion, see the entry on\n external theories of content.\n\nOne of the main motivations for experience-content internalism is the\nidea that only internally individuated states can figure in\npsychological explanations. This mirrors one of the main motivations\nfor internalism about the contents of other mental states. The general\nissue is reviewed in the entry on\n externalism.\n In the case of experience, philosophers have pursued this debate with\nrespect to Marr\u2019s computational theory of vision, one of the\nleading empirical theories of visual processing. The debate is over\nwhether Marr\u2019s theory itself posits any externally-individuated\ncontents, or whether the contents it posits are all individuated\ninternalistically. If Marr\u2019s theory is correct and explanatory,\nand if the representational contents it posits are externally\nindividuated, then it provides a counter-example to\nindividualists\u2019 claims that only internally-determined contents\nfigure in psychological explanation. The debate thus focuses on\nexactly what commitments Marr\u2019s theory makes about the\nindividuation of perceptual content.\n\nThough Marr\u2019s theory posits representational states, it does not\nmake use of the notion of a visual experience, and it is an open\nquestion how experiences map onto the stages of computational visual\nprocessing posited by the theory (see Marr (1982), section 7.2 for\nMarr\u2019s own brief discussion of this issue). Marr\u2019s theory\nseeks to explain how the visual system arrives at representations of a\nthree-dimensional array given retinal stimulation as input. The\nretinal stimulations, or \u2018gray arrays\u2019, are computational\ndescriptions that represent light and intensity values in a\ntwo-dimensional coordinate system. According to Marr, the visual\nsystem computes a description of a three-dimensional scene in three\nstages. First, given the gray arrays, it computes a \u2018primal\nsketch\u2019 of reflectance changes on the surface outside the\nviewer. Next, with the primal sketch as input, it computes a\n\u20182.5-D sketch\u2019 of this surface, a sketch that explicitly\nrepresents information concerning depth and contours of the surfaces\nrelative to the viewer. (The depth information concerns only facing\nsurfaces, so that the 2.5 sketch contains no information\u2014and\ntherefore no misinformation\u2014about how surfaces continue out of\nview.) Finally, given the 2.5 sketch as input, the visual system\ncomputes information concerning all three dimensions of objects, one\nthat describes their shapes and orientations. According to the theory,\nthe computation at each stage combines the input from the previous\nstage with assumptions that are supposedly built into the visual\nsystem.\n\nThe debate is over whether Marr\u2019s theory allows two subjects,\ncall them V and V*, to have different visual\ncontents, when V is a normal perceiver on earth, and\nV* is an intrinsic duplicate of V, with the same\ngray arrays as those had by V, and undergoes the same\nsequence of computations, viewed internally. V*\u2019s gray\narrays, however, have different distal causes. Borrowing an example\nfrom Burge (1986), suppose that V\u2019s gray arrays are\ntypically caused by shadows, and occasionally caused by cracks;\nwhereas V* lives in a world where the optical laws are\ndifferent, and there are no instances of the sort of shadows that\ncause V\u2019s gray arrays. According to Burge, Marr\u2019s\ntheory says that the contentful visual states that are computed from\nV\u2019s gray arrays always represent shadows, and thus the\nones that arise from gray arrays caused by cracks are misperceptions;\nwhile the contentful visual states that are computed from\nV*\u2019s gray arrays represent cracks. Neither V\nnor V* can discriminate the relevant sorts of cracks from the\nrelevant sort of shadows, but according to Burge this is not\nsufficient to make their contents the same. According to Gabriel\nSegal, in contrast, the contentful visual states computed from both\nV and V*\u2019s gray arrays represent a property\nmore general than the property of being a crack or the property of\nbeing a shadow\u2014a \u2018crackdow\u2019. (For further\ndiscussion, see Matthews 1988, Burge 1988, Davies 1991, Shapiro 1993,\nEgan 1991, and Patterson 1996.)\n8.2 Functionalist Informational Theories of Experience\n\nDretske and Tye have each proposed that an experience has the contents\nit does in virtue of having certain functional properties.\n\nAccording to Dretske, an experience has its content fixed by the\nbiological, phylogenetically determined function of the system (or\ncombination of systems: (1995), 22) of which it is a state. The\nfunction of the system is to provide information: for instance, the\nfunction of the auditory system is to provide information about pitch,\nintensity, timbre, and direction of sound, and it does this by\noccupying different states corresponding to different values for each\nof these properties. The different states are all the different\nauditory experiences that a given system is capable of being in. The\nsame main idea is developed by Ruth Millikan, who focuses on mental\ncontent generally rather than on experience content per\nse.\n\nTye\u2019s account of experience content derives from the theories of\nintentionality for belief developed by Stampe (1977) and Stalnaker\n(1984). According to Tye, an experience S of creature\nc has the content that p just in case: \u201cIf\noptimal conditions were to obtain, S would be tokened in\ncreature c if and only if P were the case; moreover,\nin these circumstances, S would be tokened in c\nbecause P is the case\u201d (2000, 136, note omitted; cf.\n1995, 101). For the case of visual experiences, Tye, like Dretske,\nappeals to the design of the visual system to explain what\n\u201coptimal conditions\u201d are: \u201cIn the case of evolved\ncreatures, it is natural to hold that such conditions for vision\ninvolve the various components of the visual system operating as they\nwere designed to do in the sort of external environment in which they\nwere designed to operate\u201d (Tye 2000, 138).\n\nBoth kinds of theories are externalist: according to them,\nwhat makes it the case that a subject\u2019s mental state has the\ncontent it does is in part facts about the subject\u2019s\nenvironment. Any objections to externalism about mental content are\nthus also objections to these theories of intentionality. For\ninstance, suppose there was a creature, Swampman, who suddenly popped\ninto existence due to random conglomeration of particles, and happened\nto be an intrinsic molecular duplicate of, say, Jerry Fodor. Pure\nexternalist theories (that is, theories that hold that the only way\nmental states can have content is by standing in the right external\nrelations to the subject\u2019s environment) are committed to denying\nthat Swampman would have any contentful mental states. Some\nphilosophers have found this commitment counterintuitive. For further\ndiscussion of this objection and others, see the entry on\n external theories of mental content.\n\nA central challenge facing Dretske\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s theory\nis to specify the relevant notions of informational system\nand function in an informational system. One question in the\narea is whether informational systems and functions within them are\ncontained within an organism, or whether they rather encompass\nmultiple organisms in a community. Much work by Millikan has been\ndevoted to this topic. According to her, an informational system\nencompasses both creatures who produce representations, and creatures\nwho use or receive them; and the relevant notion of function is\nsupposed to be defined in terms of both parts of such a system. For\ninstance, in a bee dance, what makes it the case that the bee dance\nrepresents the location of nectar is in part that other bees respond\nto it by flying to the nectar. A analogous challenge for co-variation\ntheories inspired by Stampe and Stalnaker is to specify what the\nrelevant \u2018becausal\u2019 relations are. Until these central\nnotions are pinned down, the theories remain programmatic.\n\nOne objection that has been raised against both kinds of informational\ntheories of experience (those that invoke biological functions, and\nthose that invoke co-variation) is that these theories are\ninsufficiently general. According to the objection, there can be\nproperties represented in a subject\u2019s experience even if she has\nnot been in causal contact with instances of those properties before,\nand which it is no part of the biological function of the visual\nsystem to represent. For example, consider impossible scenes depicted\nin Escher drawings, or a hallucination of a color that one has never\nseen before (such as Hume\u2019s missing shade of blue). Suppose\nexperiences can represent that one is standing before an Escher\nstaircase, or that something is the missing shade of blue. According\nto Tye\u2019s theory, this can happen only if in optimal conditions\nthat type of experience is tokened because these things are the case.\nBut since it is logically impossible to be standing before an Escher\nstaircase, this condition can never be met. And if it is nomologically\nimpossible to be seeing anything that is the missing shade of blue,\nthen even if the proposed necessary condition in principle can be met,\nthe worlds in which it is met would seem to be irrelevant ones for the\npurpose of the theory. So, the objection concludes, Tye\u2019s theory\nmust predict that Escher staircases and missing shades of color cannot\nbe represented in experience. For further discussion of objections to\ninformational theories, see the entry on\n causal theories of mental content.\n \n8.3 Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nAccording to some philosophers (e.g., Horgan and Tienson 2002; Kriegel\n2002, 2013; Siewert 1998), there is a some content of experience that\nis constitutively determined by the experience\u2019s phenomenology\nalone (Horgan and Tienson 2002, p. 524). Horgan and Tienson call this\nthesis phenomenal intentionality (See entry on\n phenomenal intentionality).\n A consequence of the thesis is that phenomenology enjoys explanatory\npriority over intentionality. Proponents of phenomenal intentionality\ntake phenomenology as a primitive notion, which cannot be reduced to\ncontent, and then try to explain (at least some kinds of) content in\nterms of it.\n\nIf the phenomenal intentionality thesis is true, then phenomenology\ncannot be reduced or identified with content, or with the having of\ncontent. The thesis thus stands in contrast to views defended by\nDretske and Tye according to which the content of experience is wholly\nexplained in causal or functional terms, where one does not need to\ninvoke phenomenology to explain why an experience has the content it\nhas. These latter views leave open the possibility that the content of\nan experience enjoys explanatory priority over its phenomenology, so\nthat one can explain phenomenology in terms of content.\n\nTogether with the assumption (made by Horgan and Tienson and by\nKriegel) that phenomenology is narrow (i.e., shared by intrinsic\nduplicates), the thesis of phenomenal intentionality yields an\ninternalist theory of experience content. This introduces\nanother respect in which phenomenal intentionality stands opposed to\nsome versions of functionalist informational theories of experience\ncontent\u2014namely, those versions that hold that the only\ncontents experiences can have are those had in virtue of the\nfunctional properties of the sort discussed in\n Section 8.2.\n If the thesis of phenomenal intentionality is true and phenomenology\nis narrow, then there are narrow contents that are constitutively\ndetermined by phenomenology. Any objections to narrow content will\nthus also apply to this thesis. For further discussion of narrow\ncontent, see the entry on\n narrow content.\n9. Directions for Future Research\n\nThere is much more research in philosophy to be done on the contents\nof experience. A great deal of theorizing has focused on visual\nexperiences. Even so, none of the questions discussed above are fully\nsettled, and so there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nany of those topics. Additional topics ripe for future research\ninclude questions such as: what is the relation between perceptual\ncontent and perceptual contact with reality?; how do experiences in\ndifferent modalities interact?; what role does experiential content\nplay in reasoning, in intentional action and more generally in being\nan agent?; and how are perceptual constancies reflected in the\ncontents of experience?; what notion of contents of experience is most\ntheoretically useful for unconscious perception, and how may the\nlatter be distinguished among the varieties of subpersonal information\nprocessing?",
