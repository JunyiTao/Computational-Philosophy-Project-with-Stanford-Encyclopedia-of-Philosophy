It was H\u014dnen who achieved perhaps the\nradical doctrinal innovation of his seminal period in Japanese\nBuddhist history by establishing the practice of vocal nembutsu as an\nindependent, self-sufficient path of Buddhist praxis. Despite\nwidespread esteem for his priestly and scholarly attainments and the\npurity of his religious aspirations, H\u014dnen himself, in his\npenetrating self-reflection, expressed a profound awareness of his\nincapacity to fulfill any Buddhist practice and thereby advance\nhimself toward enlightenment. He therefore searched throughout\nBuddhist tradition for an accessible path, and at length found the\nexposition of the nembutsu.\n\nNembutsu practices in early Buddhist tradition centered on mindfulness\nexercises conducted in veneration of Sakyamuni Buddha, and included\nelements of bodily worship and the reverent repetition of the name of\nthe Buddha. Later, it developed into a core practice of monastics\ninvolving ritual prostrations with the body, contemplation on the\nfeatures of enlightened beings and vocal recitation of their names,\nconducted with long lists of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Such nembutsu\npractice was and remains a basic practice in the Tendai monastery of\nEnryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, where H\u014dnen originally trained and\nlived. In addition, the Chinese Tientai practice of \u201cconstant\nwalking samadhi\u201d (j\u014dgy\u014d zammai), in which a\nmonk circumambulates a large statue of Amida, intoning the nembutsu\nand meditating on Amida Buddha and features of the Pure Land\ncontinuously for ninety days, had been transmitted to Mount Hiei\nduring the Heian period, and the group practice of \u201cconstant\nnembutsu\u201d (fudan nembutsu) in which the nembutsu was\nchanted continuously for a set number of days\u2014three or\nseven\u2014interspersed with the chanting of sutra passages and hymns\nat the \u201csix hours\u201d of the day, was frequently conducted.\nAlthough deeply familiar with such comprehensive modes of practice\nembracing physical, mental, and verbal discipline, and although widely\nrevered for his own contemplative and scholarly attainments,\nH\u014dnen taught that simply uttering the Name of Amida Buddha,\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu,\u201d entrusting oneself to his vow to save\nall beings, results in birth into Amida\u2019s buddha-field of\nenlightened activity. No intellectual command of Buddhist teachings,\naccumulation of merit, moral rectitude, or any act of practice other\nthan the vocal nembutsu is necessary.\n\nThe Pure Land Buddhist path based on the working of Amida\u2019s Vow\nis therefore an effective means toward emancipation from\nbirth-and-death and attainment of Buddhahood\u2014for H\u014dnen, the\nonly viable way for people at present\u2014and it can be practiced\nindependently of any other Buddhist teaching or method of praxis.\nWhile traditionally the nembutsu practice involved mental\nconcentration and the accumulation of numerous recitations, H\u014dnen\ntaught that in the Pure Land path only the simple saying of\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu\u201d with complete trust was involved. There\nwas no specified manner of utterance, no necessity for any\naccompanying ritual or meditative endeavor, and no stipulation of the\nlength of the period of practice or number of repetitions.\n\nThe question, of course, is why mere vocalization of Amida\u2019s\nName should hold the power to bring about birth into a buddha-field\nand eventual enlightenment, which in our present condition are\nvirtually impossible to accomplish, even through the achievement of\nextensive learning, deep meditative states, heroic discipline, and\ncompassionate action. Without an adequate demonstration that vocal\nnembutsu held such power, Pure Land praxis would remain an\nsupplementary discipline within the existing schools of Buddhist\ntradition, one supportive practice to be performed in combination with\na range of other methods.\n\nH\u014dnen promulgated his teaching by adopting an innovative\nperspective on the nature of the practices taught in Buddhist\ntradition. He reasoned that, although the utterance of the\nBuddha\u2019s name had long been transmitted in various Buddhist\nschools as one among countless different kinds of practice useful for\nattainment of enlightenment, the vocal nembutsu designated in\nAmida\u2019s vow as the act leading to birth into the Pure Land was\nqualitatively distinct from every one of the thousands of other\ntechniques found in the Buddhist teachings. While the physical act of\nvoicing the Name of Amida in itself might be identical, in other forms\nof Buddhism it was performed in conjunction with various other\npractices, including the awakening of the resolute aspiration for\nenlightenment (bodhicitta; see 2.2 above) and the selfless\ntransference of merits, and like other practices, its fulfillment as\npraxis genuinely leading toward Buddhahood turned on the\npractitioner\u2019s own purity of motive and powers of concentration\nand discipline.\n\nThe nembutsu taught in Amida\u2019s vow, however, as the simple\nvoicing of \u201cNamu-amida-butsu\u201d accessible to all beings\nregardless of their moral qualities or spiritual capacities, was\nspecifically selected by Amida Buddha as the means by which he could\nbring to fruition his compassionate vow to liberate all living things\nfrom samsaric existence. In other words, Amida, through his vow and\nthe salvific virtue of his own already completed performance of\nendless aeons of bodhisattva practices, established the saying of the\nName as the medium by which his own compassionate working actively\nreaches each being. Thus, the nembutsu has been prepared for beings as\neffective practice\u2014already fulfilled by Amida as the\nact resulting in birth in the Pure Land. This salvific activity is\nparticularly appropriate in the present age, when the accomplishment\nof praxis as ordinarily understood in Buddhist tradition has receded\nbeyond the reach of beings. Anticipating this situation, Amida\u2019s\nvow teaches that one should relinquish the illusions and attachments\nfocused on the self and its capacities and set aside the extensive\nbody of traditional methods of praxis as no longer effective, since\nthey require a purity of performance no longer achievable. The Pure\nLand tradition characterizes such practices as\n\u201cself-power\u201d and advocates instead a turn to the saying\nthe nembutsu as the act that embodies \u201cOther Power,\u201d Amida\nBuddha\u2019s wisdom-compassion functioning in the world.\n\nTwo aspects of H\u014dnen historical role relate directly to our\nconcerns here with philosophical aspects of interpreting and\narticulating his religious awareness: the means by which H\u014dnen\neffected his ground-breaking contribution to Buddhist tradition, and\nH\u014dnen\u2019s legacy as inherited by his disciples. Regarding the\nfirst, H\u014dnen is recognized as the first and perhaps most\nrevolutionary \u201cfounder\u201d of a native Japanese Buddhist\ntradition. Based on his principle of \u201cthe nembutsu selected in\nAmida\u2019s primal vow\u201d (senjaku hongan nembutsu) as\nthe practice embodying the Buddha\u2019s Other Power, he established\nthe Pure Land school (J\u014ddosh\u016b) as an authentic Buddhist\npath, effective in itself and independent from the traditionally\nrecognized schools that had been transmitted to Japan from the Asian\ncontinent over the preceding centuries. H\u014dnen set about to\naccomplish this in his major writing, Collection on the Nembutsu\nSelected in the Primal Vow (Senchaku hongan\nnembutsu-sh\u016b), composed in kanbun (Chinese) and\naddressed to an audience versed in Buddhist erudition and its methods\nof discourse. Here, H\u014dnen systematically raises the traditional\nissues involved in recognizing the Pure Land teaching as a legitimate\nschool of Buddhism, such as the identification of foundational sutras,\nthe delineation of the historical lineage of masters by which the Pure\nLand path has been transmitted down to the present, and its doctrinal\northodoxy, demonstrated with reference to the sutras and the\ncommentarial tradition. In his work, H\u014dnen argues logically and\ncogently on the basis of scriptural evidence, including extended\ncitations from the recognized Chinese canon.\n\nH\u014dnen allowed his work to be copied only by disciples during his\nlifetime, but it was published shortly after his death. It immediately\ngarnered vehement censure and counter-argument from scholar-monks of\ntraditional schools, attesting to the impact H\u014dnen\u2019s\nnembutsu teaching was already having in Japanese society, but also to\nthe recognition of the forms of scholastic discourse and rational\nargument into which his thought had been cast. From the accounts of\nhis followers and records of his spoken words and letters, it appears\nthat H\u014dnen was an immensely charismatic figure, communicating his\nteaching to both the ordained and lay and persuasively responding to\nthe questions of his many listeners from all walks of life.\nNevertheless, the major formulation of his religious thought followed\ncustomary models, dictated by his formidable role in Buddhist\nhistory.\n",
