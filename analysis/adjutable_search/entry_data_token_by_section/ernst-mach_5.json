    "main_text": "Psychology and the Life Sciences || Haeckel, Hering and Evolutionary Theory\n3.4 Haeckel, Hering and Evolutionary Theory\n\n\n Nineteenth century evolutionary theory is complicated in that in the\ncultures which most obviously experienced a widespread acceptance of\nevolution, inspired apparently by Darwin\u2019s 1859 publication\nof Origin of the Species, evolutionary ideas had already been\npresent and Darwin\u2019s mechanism for evolutionary change, natural\nselection, was not necessarily accepted. Rather, more deeply\nteleological accounts of nature were often put forward within an\nevolutionary framework. Mach came of intellectual age in 1860, right\nwhen this explosion of evolutionary ideas was starting. Unlike the\ndisciplines of psychology and physics, he makes no contributions to\nevolutionary theory; however, his entire system is located within an\nevolutionary framework. This framework is not one that he argues for;\nrather, it was the metaphysics (yes, metaphysics) he adapted from his\nnineteenth century German intellectual culture. The two immediate\ninfluences on Mach in this regard were Herring and Haeckel, or at\nleast we can turn to their writings to understand the evolutionary\ntradition Mach was part of.\n\nThe greatest popularizer of evolutionary theory in the nineteenth\ncentury was of course Ernst Haeckel. Although he is now best known for\nhis infamous maxim, \u201contogeny recapitulates phylogeny\u201d,\nhis larger project was to put forward an evolutionary metaphysics; in\nparticular to offer a monistic unified account of our reality. His\nproject, overlapping significantly with that of Mach and Herring,\nsought to embed the developments of psychology within a theory of\nevolutionary development; evolution was the evolution of not just the\nspecies but also of the psyche.\n\n\nIn late nineteenth century continental Europe a different notion of\n\u2018direction\u2019 existed than the one that Darwin directly\nattacked. Whereas the theory of natural selection maintains that\nevolution is a directionless process having no guiding factor or end\npoint, relying rather on selection within particular environments on\nrandom variations thrown up by the chaos of nature, Hering, Haeckel,\nand Mach were part of a German tradition which held that there is an\ninner telos in nature. Hering and Mach were atheists, and disbelieved\nin a soul, but still accepted the idea that nature had internal\ndirection. As will be shown later, this idea of internal\ndirection extends for Mach all the way up to his ideas on the purpose\nof science.\n\n\nHering was Mach\u2019s close friend, political ally, academic\npartner, and second only to Fechner in terms of total influence.\nHering was also a fellow Fechnerian (he studied under Fechner), and he\nshared both Mach\u2019s bio-psychological orientation and nativist\ntheories of spatial intuition. Hering is known for his work in\nbinocular vision and for his debates with Helmholtz over color vision,\nand also for his address to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna,\n\u201cOn Memory as a Universal Function of Organized\nMatter\u201d.\n",
