    "main_text": "The Character of Republican Leaders\n8. The Character of Republican Leaders\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s arguments in favor of republican regimes also\nappeal to his skeptical stance toward the acquisition of\nvirt\u00f9 by any single individual, and hence the\nimplication that a truly stable principality may never be attainable.\nThe effect of the Machiavellian dichotomy between the need for\nflexibility and the inescapable constancy of character is to\ndemonstrate an inherent practical limitation in single-ruler regimes.\nFor the reader is readily led to the conclusion that, just because\nhuman conduct is rooted in a firm and invariant character, the rule of\na single man is intrinsically unstable and precarious. In the\nDiscourses, Machiavelli provides a psychological case that\nthe realities of human character tend to favor a republic over a\nprincipality, since the former \u201cis better able to adapt itself\nto diverse circumstances than a prince owing to the diversity found\namong its citizens\u201d (Discourses CW 253).\n\nMachiavelli illustrates this claim by reference to the evolution of\nRoman military strategy against Hannibal. After the first flush of the\nCarthaginian general\u2019s victories in Italy, the circumstances of\nthe Roman required a circumspect and cautious leader who would not\ncommit the legions to aggressive military action for which they were\nnot prepared. Such leadership emerged in the person of Fabius Maximus,\n\u201ca general who by his slowness and his caution held the enemy at\nbay. Nor could he have met with circumstances more suited to his\nways\u201d (Discourses CW 452). Yet when a more offensive\nstance was demanded to defeat Hannibal, the Roman Republic was able to\nturn to the leadership of Scipio, whose personal qualities were more\nfitted to the times. Neither Fabius nor Scipio was able to escape\n\u201chis ways and habits\u201d (Discourses CW 452), but\nthe fact that Rome could call on each at the appropriate moment\nsuggests to Machiavelli an inherent strength of the republican\nsystem.\n\nIf Fabius had been king of Rome, he might easily have lost this war,\nsince he was incapable of altering his methods according as\ncircumstance changed. Since, however, he was born in a republic where\nthere were diverse citizens with diverse dispositions, it came about\nthat, just as it had a Fabius, who was the best man to keep the war\ngoing when circumstances required it, so later it had a Scipio at a\ntime suited to its victorious consummation (Discourses CW\n452).\n\n\nChanging events require flexibility of response, and since it is\npsychologically implausible for human character to change with the\ntimes, the republic offers a viable alternative: people of different\nqualities fit different exigencies. The diversity characteristic of\ncivic regimes, which was so reviled by Machiavelli\u2019s\npredecessors, proves to be an abiding advantage of republics over\nprincipalities.\n\nThis does not mean that Machiavelli\u2019s confidence in the capacity\nof republican government to redress the political shortcomings of\nhuman character was unbridled. After all, he gives us no real\nindication of how republics manage to identify and authorize the\nleaders whose qualities are suited to the circumstances. It is one\nthing to observe that such variability has occurred within republics,\nquite another to demonstrate that this is a necessary or essential\nfeature of the republican system. At best, then, Machiavelli offers us\na kind of empirical generalization, the theoretical foundations of\nwhich he leaves unexplored. And the Discourses points out\nthat republics have their own intrinsic limitation in regard to the\nflexibility of response needed to conquer fortune. For just as with\nindividual human beings, it is difficult (if not impossible) to change\ntheir personal characteristics, so\n\ninstitutions in republics do not change with the times \u2026 but\nchange very slowly because it is more painful to change them since it\nis necessary to wait until the whole republic is in a state of\nupheaval; and for this it is not enough that one man alone should\nchange his own procedure. (Discourses CW 453)\n\nIf the downfall of principalities is the fixed structure of human\ncharacter, then the failing of republics is a devotion to the\nperpetuation of institutional arrangements whose time has passed.\nWhether it is any more plausible to hold out hope for the creation of\nmore responsive republican institutions than to demand flexibility in\nthe personal qualities of princes is not directly examined by the\nDiscourses.\n\nMachiavelli thus seems to adhere to a genuinely republican position.\nBut how are we to square this with his statements in The\nPrince? It is tempting to dismiss The Prince as an\ninauthentic expression of Machiavelli\u2019s \u201creal\u201d views\nand preferences, written over a short period in order to prove his\npolitical value to the returned Medici masters of Florence. (This is\ncontrasted with the lengthy composition process of the\nDiscourses.) Yet Machiavelli never repudiated The\nPrince, and indeed refers to it in the Discourses in a\nway that suggests he viewed the former as a companion to the latter.\nAlthough there has been much debate about whether Machiavelli was\ntruly a friend of princes and tyrants or of republics, and hence\nwhether we should dismiss one or another facet of his writing as\nancillary or peripheral, the questions seems irresolvable. Mark\nHulliung\u2019s suggestion that \u201cboth\u201d Machiavellis need\nto be lent equal weight thus enjoys a certain plausibility (Hulliung\n1983).\n",
