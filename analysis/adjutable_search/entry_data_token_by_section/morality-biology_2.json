Here \u2018morality\u2019\nrefers, as noted earlier, to a certain set of empirical\nphenomena, such as the observed capacity of human beings to make\nnormative judgments, or the tendency to have certain sentiments such\nas sympathy or guilt or blame, or certain \u2018intuitions\u2019\nabout fairness or violence. Just as we can inquire into the origins\nand functions of other traits, such as human linguistic capacities, we\ncan inquire into the origins and functions of the various\npsychological capacities and tendencies associated with\n\u2018morality\u2019.\n\nThe sense of \u2018morality\u2019 in the above questions may be\ncalled the empirical sense of the term, and it is in this\nsense that scientists speak of \u201cthe evolution of\nmorality,\u201d using such tools as comparative genomics and primate\nstudies to shed light on it (Rosenberg 2006; de Waal 1996 and 2006).\nSuch explanatory projects will be discussed in section 2.\n\nThe Normative Sense of \u2018Morality\u2019\n\n\nIn contrast to the above, there is a very different use of the term\n\u2018morality\u2019 in what may be called the normative\nsense. Consider the question: \u201cDoes morality require\nthat we make substantial sacrifices to help distant strangers?\u201d\nSuch a question arises from the deliberative standpoint as we seek to\ndetermine how we ought to live, and it is a normative rather than an\nempirical question. We are not here asking an anthropological question\nabout some actual moral code\u2014even that of our own\nsociety\u2014but a normative question that might lead us to a new\nmoral code. When we use \u2018morality\u2019 in the normative sense,\nit is meant to refer to however it is we ought to live, i.e.,\nto a set of norms that ought to be adopted and\n followed.[2]\n\nPhilosophers employ this normative sense of \u2018morality\u2019 or\n\u2018moral\u2019 in posing a variety of both normative and\nmetaethical questions: What does morality require of us? Does morality\nhave a purely consequentialist structure, as utilitarians claim? What\nkind of meaning do claims about morality in the normative sense have?\nAre there moral truths\u2014i.e., truths about morality in the\nnormative sense\u2014and if so, what are they grounded in and how can\nwe come to know them? Is morality culturally relative or at least\npartly universal? (Note that this is not the same as the\nanthropological question whether or to what extent morality\nin the empirical sense varies from culture to\nculture.)\n\nWhile morality in the normative sense is not an empirical phenomenon\nto be explained, there are still important questions to ask about how\nevolutionary theory may bear on it. Can we look to our evolutionary\nbackground for moral guidance, gaining insight into the content of\nmorality in the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of\nprescriptive evolutionary ethics)? (Section 3) Does\nevolutionary theory shed light on metaethics, helping to resolve\nquestions about the existence and nature of morality\nin the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of evolutionary\nmetaethics)? Does it, for example, lend support to nihilism (the idea\nthat there is really no such thing as morality\nin the normative sense) or to skepticism (the idea that even if\nthere are truths about morality in the normative sense we cannot know\nthem, or at least could not know them if they were objective truths)?\n(Section 4)\n\nHaving distinguished various issues and questions, we may turn now to\nconsider first the scientific explanatory projects concerning morality\nin the empirical sense.\n",
