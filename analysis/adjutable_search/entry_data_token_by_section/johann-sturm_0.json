    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nSturm was born in Hilpoltstein close to Nuremberg on November 3, 1635\nin the midst of the Thirty Years War (1618\u20131648) which\ndevastated mainly those areas that were to later constitute the\nterritory of Germany. Sturm\u2019s father, Johann Eucharius Sturm,\nwas a tailor, valet, treasurer, and custodian of the silverware at the\ncourt of Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich of Pfalz-Hilpoltstein.\nSturm\u2019s mother was Gertraud Bock, daughter of Konrad Bock,\ncountry parson of Liebenstadt. During his infancy, Sturm learned Latin\nand other (fine) arts from the court chaplain (concionator),\nJohann Jakob Beurer.\n\nWhen the Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich (himself a Protestant) died\nin 1644, leaving no heir to the throne, his territory devolved unto\nhis older brother Wolfgang Wilhelm, who had converted to Catholicism\nin 1613. Although Johann-Friedrich had reached an agreement with his\nbrother that (unlike all other subjects) the courtiers and servants to\nJohann-Friedrich\u2019s court could remain Protestant, this promise\nceased upon his death. As a consequence of the Counter-Reformation,\nall subjects had to become Catholic. Sturm and his family, being\nLutherans and resisting this call, fled the county in 1645. They\nsettled close by in Wei\u00dfenburg. From 1646 onwards, Sturm\nattended the Latin School in Wei\u00dfenburg living in the house of\nthe rector, Johannes Hupfer, who took care of him. In 1653, upon the\nadvocacy of Sturm\u2019s father, Daniel W\u00fclfer, priest and dean\nof St. Lorenz, employed Johann Christoph as amanuensis. He supported\nSturm financially and furthered his academic career. Initially, Sturm\nmight have thought about studying at the University of Altdorf, since\nhe enrolled on October 4, 1653. However, he did not take up his\nstudies.\n\nInstead of studying at the University of Altdorf, Sturm decided to\nread at the University of Jena, enrolling on February 2, 1656. Sturm\nstudied mathematics and physics with both Erhard Weigel\n(1625\u20131699) and Johann Zeisold (1599\u20131667). He studied\ntheology with Henning Spoercke. Sturm was awarded the degree of\nmagister philosophiae magna cum laude on January 27, 1658. On\nOctober 10, 1660 Sturm enrolled at the University of Leiden, where he\nstudied philosophy with Johannes De Raey (1622\u20131702) and\narchitecture privatim with Nicolai Goldmann\n(1611\u20131665). It was in Leiden that Sturm most likely came into\ncontact with the concept of and the driving force behind the idea of\neclecticism (see\n sect. 2)\n as Henricus Bornius (1617\u20131665), professor of ethics at the\nUniversity of Leiden, had formulated it in his (1653) inaugural\nlecture De vera philosophandi libertate. During his one-year\nstay in Leiden, Sturm also visited Baruch de Spinoza\n(1632\u20131677). In 1661, Sturm returned to Jena via Amsterdam,\nHamburg, Lower Saxony, Magdeburg, and Leipzig. In Jena, he spent one\nmore year on the study of theology.\n\nIn 1662, Sturm returned to his former benefactor, Daniel W\u00fclfer,\ninstructing his sons, but also conducting his own philosophical\nstudies. Only in 1664 was Sturm able to find a decent employment as\npriest of Deiningen and (from 1667 onwards) Klosterzimmern, allowing\nhim to settle and start a family.\n\nOn August 15, 1669 Sturm was offered a position as professor of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf, which he took\nover from Abdias Trew (1597\u20131669). Sturm held this position\nuntil his death in 1703. His most famous students were the Swiss\npolyhistor Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1672\u20131733); Johann Gabriel\nDoppelmayr (1671\u20131750), a German mathematician, natural\nphilosopher and encyclopedist; Johann Heinrich M\u00fcller\n(1671\u20131731), one of Sturm\u2019s successors to the chair of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf; Martin Knorre\n(1657\u20131699); and Georg Albrecht Hamberger (1662\u20131716), a\nteacher of Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754). Besides his\nprofessorship, Sturm was twice the rector of the University of\nAltdorf, and nine times the dean of the faculty of philosophy.\n\nSturm was married three times: his first wife was Barbara Johanna\nKesler. They married in 1664. She died in 1679. His second wife was\nMaria Salome H\u00f6chstetter. They married in 1680. She died in 1691.\nHis third wife was Dorothea Elisabeth G\u00f6ring. They married in\n1692 and she outlived Sturm. Sturm had 13 children, Leonhard Christoph\nSturm being the most famous one.\n\nSturm died in Altdorf on December 25, 1703 from the consequences of a\nstroke he had suffered two months earlier. He was said to be \n\n\na pious, honest, kind, upright man, of clear speech, very eager in\n[the search for] justice and truth, and the successful renovator of\nmathematical studies. (Brucker 1766: 770) \n\n\nIn his eulogy on Sturm, Georg Paul R\u00f6tenbeck, who was ordinary\nprofessor of political science and logic at the University of Altdorf\nand whose daughter was married to Sturm\u2019s son Leonhard\nChristoph, portrays Sturm as humble, decent, impartial, duteous,\npatient, and godly. Furthermore, Sturm is venerated as a brilliant\nphilosopher and mathematician as well as a good family father (Hermann\n& Platz 2003: 10\u201327).\n\nThroughout his life as professor of mathematics and physics at the\nUniversity of Altdorf, Sturm produced a variety of works, including\nmathematical textbooks, a colorful set of disputations, works on\nastronomy (aimed at discrediting astrology), and calendars. However,\nSturm\u2019s core interest concerned natural philosophy. He published\nthree systematic treatises on physics, the Physica\nConciliatrix (PC, 1684), the Physica Electiva sive\nHypothetica (PE, 1697/1722) and the posthumously published\nCompendium Physicae Modernae Sanioris (CPMS, 1704).\n\nThe Physica Electiva is Sturm\u2019s masterpiece. It is\ndivided into three parts: a physica generalis (general\nphysics) that lays down the foundations of Sturm\u2019s system and\nincludes his discussion of key metaphysical themes such as the nature\nof matter, form, and causation; a physica specialis (special\nphysics) that covers the main phenomena of the supralunary and the\nsublunary world; and a physica specialissima (very special\nphysics) that is devoted to the study of life and human beings. During\nhis life, Sturm managed to published only the physica\ngeneralis. The physica specialis was published\nposthumously by Christian Wolff in 1722. The third part has never been\npublished. It has been alleged that it were held in manuscript form by\nthe city library of Nuremberg (Gaab, in Gaab et al. 2004). Based on\narchival research conducted by one of the authors (C. Henkel) in the\ncity library of Nuremberg in October 2019, he thinks no such\nmanuscript exists there. However, the city library of Nuremberg holds\nwhat he takes to be study notes of Sturm\u2019s students on courses\nin natural \n philosophy.[1]\n",
