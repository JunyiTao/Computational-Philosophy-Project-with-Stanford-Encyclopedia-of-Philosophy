Introduction\n\nIt is not uncommon for humans to find themselves with the intuition\nthat random, unplanned, unexplained accident just\ncouldn\u2019t produce the order, beauty, elegance, and\nseeming purpose that we experience in the natural world around us. As\nHume\u2019s interlocutor Cleanthes put it, we seem to see \u201cthe\nimage of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects\u201d in\nnature (Hume 1779 [1998], 35). And many people find themselves\nconvinced that no explanation for that mind-resonance which\nfails to acknowledge a causal role for intelligence, intent and\npurpose in nature can be seriously plausible.\n\nCosmological arguments often begin with the bare fact that there are\ncontingently existing things and end with conclusions concerning the\nexistence of a cause with the power to account for the\nexistence of those contingent things. Others reason from the\npremise that the universe has not always existed to a cause that\nbrought it into being. Teleological arguments (or arguments from\ndesign) by contrast begin with a much more specialized catalogue\nof properties and end with a conclusion concerning the existence of a\ndesigner with the intellectual properties (knowledge,\npurpose, understanding, foresight, wisdom, intention) necessary to\ndesign the things exhibiting the special properties in\nquestion. In broad outline, then, teleological arguments focus upon\nfinding and identifying various traces of the operation of a mind in\nnature\u2019s temporal and physical structures, behaviors and paths.\nOrder of some significant type is usually the starting point\nof design arguments.\n\nDesign-type arguments are largely unproblematic when based upon things\nnature clearly could not or would not produce (e.g.,\nmost human artifacts), or when the intelligent agency is itself\n\u2018natural\u2019 (human, alien, etc.). Identifying designed\ntraces of \u2018lost\u2019 human civilizations or even non-human\ncivilizations (via SETI) could in principle be uncontroversial.\nObjections to design inferences typically arise only when the posited\ndesigner is something more exotic or perhaps supernatural.\n\nBut despite the variety of spirited critical attacks they have\nelicited, design arguments have historically had and continue to have\nwidespread intuitive appeal\u2014indeed, it is sometimes claimed that\ndesign arguments are the most persuasive of all purely philosophical\ntheistic arguments. Note that while design arguments have\ntraditionally been employed to support theism over metaphysical\nnaturalism, some might also be relevant for panentheism, panpsychism,\nand other views involving irreducible teleology.\n2. Design Inference Patterns\n\nThe historical arguments of interest are precisely the potentially\nproblematic ones\u2014inferences beginning with some empirical\nfeatures of nature and concluding with the existence of a designer. A\nstandard but separable second step\u2014the natural theology\nstep\u2014involves identifying the designer as God, often via\nparticular properties and powers required by the designing in\nquestion. Although the argument wielded its greatest intellectual\ninfluence during the 18th and early 19th centuries, it goes back at\nleast to the Greeks and in extremely clipped form comprises one of\nAquinas\u2019s Five Ways. It was given a fuller and quite nice early\nstatement by Hume\u2019s Cleanthes (1779 [1998], 15).\n\nThe question remains, however, about the formal structure of such\narguments. What sort of logic is being employed? As it turns out, that\nquestion does not have just a single answer. Several distinct answers\nare canvassed in the following sections.\n2.1 Analogical Design Arguments: Schema 1\n\nDesign arguments are routinely classed as analogical\narguments\u2014various parallels between human artifacts and certain\nnatural entities being taken as supporting parallel conclusions\nconcerning operative causation in each case. The standardly ascribed\nschema is roughly thus:\n\n\nSchema 1:\n\nEntity e within nature (or the cosmos, or nature itself)\nis like specified human artifact a (e.g., a machine)\nin relevant respects R.\na has R precisely because it is a\nproduct of deliberate design by intelligent human agency.\nLike effects typically have like causes (or\nlike explanations, like existence requirements,\netc.)\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is (highly) probable that e has R precisely\nbecause it too is a product of deliberate design by intelligent,\nrelevantly human-like agency.\n\n\n2.1.1 Humean objections\n\nThis general argument form was criticized quite vigorously by Hume, at\nseveral key steps. Against (1), Hume argued that the analogy is not\nvery good\u2014that nature and the various things in it are not\nvery like human artifacts and exhibit substantial differences\nfrom them\u2014e.g., living vs. not, self-sustaining vs. not. Indeed,\nwhereas advocates of design arguments frequently cited similarities\nbetween the cosmos on the one hand and human machines on the other,\nHume suggested that the cosmos much more closely resembled a living\norganism than a machine. (Contemporary cosmology strengthens\nHume\u2019s point, given the radical changes that have taken place\nsince the Big Bang. The universe looks less stable and\n\u201cmachine-like\u201d than when the design argument was at the\nheight of its popularity.) But if the alleged resemblance is in\nrelevant respects distant, then the inference in question will be\nlogically fragile. And while (2) may be true in specific cases of\nhuman artifacts a, that fact is only made relevant to natural\nphenomena e via (3), which underpins the transfer of the key\nattribution. Against (3), Hume argued that any number of alternative\npossible explanations could be given of allegedly designed entities in\nnature\u2014chance, for instance. Thus, even were (1) true\nand even were there important resemblances, the argument might confer\nlittle probabilistic force onto the conclusion.\n\nMore generally, Hume also argued that even if something like the\nstated conclusion (4) were established, that left the arguer far from\nanything like a traditional conception of God. For instance, natural\nevils or apparently suboptimal designs might suggest e.g., an amateur\ndesigner or a committee of designers. And if phenomena instrumental to\nthe production of natural evils (e.g., disease microorganisms)\nexhibited various of the Rs, then they would presumably have\nto be laid at the designer\u2019s door, further eroding the\ndesigner\u2019s resemblance to the wholly good deity of tradition.\nAnd even the most impressive empirical data could properly establish\nonly finite (although perhaps enormous) power and wisdom, rather than\nthe infinite power and wisdom usually associated with divinity. But\neven were one to concede some substance to the design argument\u2019s\nconclusion, that would, Hume suggested, merely set up a regress. The\ndesigning agent would itself demand explanation, requiring ultimately\na sequence of prior analogous intelligences producing intelligences.\nAnd even were the existence of a designer of material things\nestablished, that did not yet automatically establish the existence of\na creator of the matter so shaped. And since analogical\narguments are a type of induction (see the entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning),\n the conclusion even if established would be established only to some,\nperhaps insignificant, degree of probability. Furthermore, we could\nnot ground any induction concerning the cosmos itself upon a requisite\nfund of experiences of other cosmoi found to be both deliberately\ndesigned and very like ours in relevant respects\u2014for\nthe simple reason that this universe is our only sample. And finally\nthe fraction of this one cosmos (both spatially and temporally)\navailable to our inspection is extraordinarily small\u2014not a\npromising basis for a cosmically general conclusion. Hume concluded\nthat while the argument might constitute some limited grounds for\nthinking that \u201cthe cause or causes of order in the universe\nprobably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence\u201d\n(1779 [1998], 88) Hume\u2019s emphasis)\u2014and that is not a\ntrivial implication\u2014it established nothing else whatever.\n\nHistorically, not everyone agreed that Hume had fatally damaged the\nargument. It is simply not true that explanatory inferences cannot\nproperly extend beyond merely what is required for known effects. As a\nvery general example, based on the few observations which humans had\nmade during a cosmically brief period in a spatially tiny part of the\ncosmos, Newton theorized that all bits of matter at\nall times and in all places attracted all\nother bits of matter. There was nothing logically suspect here.\nIndeed, simplicity and uniformity considerations\u2014which have\nconsiderable well-earned scientific clout\u2014push in the direction\nof such generalizations.\n\nBut Hume certainly identified important places within the argument to\nprobe. Whether his suggestions are correct concerning the uncertain\ncharacter of any designer inferred will depend upon the specific\nRs and upon what can or cannot be definitively said\nconcerning requirements for their production.\n2.1.2 R Concerns: Round 1\n\nKey questions, then, include: what are the relevant Rs\ntypically cited? do those Rs genuinely signal purpose and\ndesign? how does one show that either way? are there viable\nalternative accounts of the Rs requiring no reference to\nminds? how does one show that either way? The specific\nRs in question are obviously central to design argument\nefforts. Although the underlying general category is, again, some\nspecial type of orderliness, the specifics have ranged rather widely\nhistorically. Among the more straightforwardly empirical are inter\nalia uniformity, contrivance, adjustment of means to ends,\nparticularly exquisite complexity, particular types of functionality,\ndelicacy, integration of natural laws, improbability, and the fitness\n(fine-tuning) of the inorganic realm for supporting life. Several\nproblematic proposals that are empirically further removed and have\naxiological overtones have also been advanced, including the\nintelligibility of nature, the directionality of evolutionary\nprocesses, aesthetic characteristics (beauty, elegance, and the like),\napparent purpose and value (including the aptness of our world for the\nexistence of moral value and practice) and just the sheer niftiness of\nmany of the things we find in nature.\n2.2 Deductive Design Arguments: Schema 2\n\nBut some advocates of design arguments had been reaching for a deeper\nintuition. The intuition they were attempting to capture involved\nproperties that constituted some degree of evidence for design, not\njust because such properties happened to be often or even only\nproduced by designing agents. Advocates were convinced that the\nappropriate Rs in question were in their own right directly\nreflective of and redolent of cognition, that this directly suggested\nmind, that we could see nearly directly that they were the\ngeneral sort of thing that a mind might or even\nwould generate, and that consequently they did not depend for\ntheir evidential force upon previously established known instances of\ndesign. When we see a text version of the Gettysburg Address, that\ntext says mind to us in a way totally unrelated to any\ninduction or analogy from past encounters with\nwritten texts. It was that type of testimony to mind, to design, that\nsome historical advocates of design arguments believed that they found\nin some Rs observed in nature\u2014a testimony having no\ndependency on induction or analogy. Beauty, purpose and in general\nvalue especially when conjoined with delicate complexity were\npopular underlying intuitive marks. Intricate, dynamic, stable,\nfunctioning order of the sort we encounter in nature was frequently\nplaced in this category. Such order was taken to be suggestive of\nminds in that it seemed nearly self-evidently the sort of thing minds\nwere prone to produce. It was a property whose\nmind-resonating character we could unhesitatingly attribute\nto intent.\n\nDespite Hume\u2019s earlier demurs that things in nature are not\nreally very like artifacts such as machines, most people who are most\nfamiliar with nature\u2019s dazzling intricacies freely admit that\nnature abounds with things that look designed\u2014that are\nintention-shaped. For instance, Francis Crick (no fan of\ndesign) issued a warning to his fellow biologists:\n\nBiologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not\ndesigned, but rather evolved. (Crick 1988, 138).\n\n\nAlong with this perception of mind-suggestiveness went a further\nprinciple\u2014that the mind-suggestive or design-like\ncharacteristics in question were too palpable to have been generated\nby non-intentional means.\n\nThat allows specification of a second design inference pattern:\n\n\nSchema 2:\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are\ndesign-like (exhibit a cognition-resonating, intention-shaped\ncharacter R)\nDesign-like properties (R) are not producible by\n(unguided) natural means\u2014i.e., any phenomenon exhibiting such\nRs must be a product of intentional design.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products\nof intentional design, which in turn requires agency of some\ntype.\n\n\n\nNotice that explicit reference to human artifacts has dropped\nout of the argument, and that the argument is no longer comparative\nbut has become essentially deductive. Some arguments were historically\nintended as arguments of that type. William Paley famously sees no\ndesign-like properties in a stone, but finding a watch on the ground\nwould be another matter. Unlike the stone, it could not always have\nbeen there. Why\n not?[1]\n\nFor this reason, and for no other, namely, that when we come to\ninspect the watch, we perceive\u2014what we could not discover in the\nstone\u2014that its several parts are framed and put together for a\npurpose \u2026 [The requisite] mechanism being observed \u2026 the\ninference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a\nmaker. ... Every observation which was made in our first chapter\nconcerning the watch may be repeated with strict propriety concerning\nthe eye, concerning animals, concerning plants, concerning, indeed,\nall the organized parts of the works of nature. \u2026 [T]he\neye \u2026 would be alone sufficient to support the\nconclusion which we draw from it, as to the necessity of an\nintelligent Creator. \u2026\n\n\nAlthough Paley\u2019s argument is routinely construed as analogical,\nit contains an informal statement of the above variant argument type.\nPaley goes on for two chapters discussing the watch, discussing the\nproperties in it which evince design, and destroying potential\nobjections to concluding design in the watch. It is only then that\nentities in nature\u2014e.g., the eye\u2014come onto the horizon.\nPaley isn\u2019t trying to persuade his readers that the watch is\ndesigned and has a designer. He is teasing out the bases and\nprocedures from and by which we should and should not reason about\ndesign and designers. Thus Paley\u2019s use of the term\n\u2018inference\u2019 in connection with the watch\u2019s\n designer.[2]\n\nOnce having acquired the relevant principles, then in Chapter 3 of\nNatural Theology\u2014\u201cApplication of the\nArgument\u201d\u2014Paley applies the same\nargument (vs. presenting us with the other half of the analogical\nargument) to things in nature. The cases of human artifacts and nature\nrepresent two separate inference instances:\n\nup to the limit, the reasoning is as clear and certain in the one case\nas in the other. (Paley 1802 [1963], 14)\n\n\nBut the instances are instances of the same inferential\nmove:\n\nthere is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for\nvision as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it.\n(Paley 1802 [1963], 13)\n\n\nThe watch does play an obvious and crucial role\u2014but as a\nparadigmatic instance of design inferences rather than as the\nanalogical foundation for an inferential comparison.\n\nSchema 2, not being analogically structured, would not be vulnerable\nto the ills of\n analogy,[3]\n and not being inductive would claim more than mere probability for\nits conclusion. That is not accidental. Indeed, it has been argued\nthat Paley was aware of Hume\u2019s earlier attacks on analogical\ndesign arguments, and deliberately structured his argument to avoid\nthe relevant pitfalls (Gillispie 1990, 214\u2013229).\n2.2.1 Assessing the Schema 2 argument\n\nFirst, how are we to assess the premises required by this schema?\nPremise (5), at least, is not particularly controversial even now.\nCrick\u2019s earlier warning to biologists would have been pointless\nwere there no temptation toward design attributions, and even as\nimplacable a contemporary opponent of design arguments as Richard\nDawkins characterized biology as:\n\nthe study of complicated things that give the appearance of having\nbeen designed for a purpose. (Dawkins 1987, 1)\n\n\nDay-to-day contemporary biology is rife with terms like\n\u2018design\u2019, \u2018machine\u2019, \u2018purpose\u2019,\nand allied terms. As historian of science Timothy Lenoir has\nremarked:\n\nTeleological thinking has been steadfastly resisted by modern biology.\nAnd yet, in nearly every area of research biologists are hard pressed\nto find language that does not impute purposiveness to living forms.\n(Lenoir 1982, ix)\n\n\nWhether or not particular biological phenomena are designed, they are\nfrequently enough design-like to make design language not\nonly fit living systems extraordinarily well, but to undergird the\ngeneration of fruitful theoretical\n conceptions.[4]\n Advocates of design arguments claim that the reason why theorizing\nas if organisms are designed meets with such success is that\norganisms are in fact designed. Those opposed would say that\nall teleological concepts in biology must, in one way or another, be\nreduced to natural selection.\n\nHowever, principle (6) (that the relevant design-like properties are\nnot producible by unguided natural means) will be more problematic in\nevolutionary biology. What might be the rational justification for\n(6)? There are two broad possibilities.\n\n1. Empirical: induction. Induction essentially involves\nestablishing that some principle holds within the realm of our\nexperience (the sample cases), and then generalizing the\nprinciple to encompass relevant areas beyond that realm (the\ntest cases). The attempt to establish the universality of a\nconnection between having relevant Rs and being a product of\nmind on the basis of an observed consistent connection between having\nrelevant Rs and being a product of mind within all (most) of\nthe cases where both R was exhibited and we knew\nwhether or not the phenomenon in question was a product of mind, would\nconstitute an inductive generalization.\n\nThis approach would suffer from a variety of weaknesses. The\nR-exhibiting things concerning which we knew whether they\nwere designed would be almost without exception human artifacts,\nwhereas the phenomena to which the generalization was being extended\nwould be things in nature. And, of course, the generalization in\nquestion could establish at best a probability, and a fairly modest\none at that.\n\n2. Conceptual. It might be held that (6) is known in the same\nconceptual, nearly a priori way in which we know\nthat textbooks are not producible by natural processes unaided by\nmind. And our conviction here is not based on any mere induction from\nprior experiences of texts. Texts carry with them essential marks of\nmind, and indeed in understanding a text we see at least partway into\nthe mind(s) involved. Various alien artifacts (if any)\u2014of which\nwe have had no prior experience whatever\u2014could fall into this\ncategory as well. Similarly, it has been held that we sometimes\nimmediately recognize that order of the requisite sort just\nis a sign of mind and intent.\n\nAlternatively, it could be argued that although there is a genuine\nconceptual link between appropriate Rs and mind, design,\nintent, etc., that typically our recognition of that link is\ntriggered by specific experiences with artifacts. On this view, once\nthe truth of (6) became manifest to us through those experiences, the\nappropriateness of its more general application would be clear. That\nmight explain why so many advocates of design arguments seem to\nbelieve that they must only display a few cases and raise\ntheir eyebrows to gain assent to design.\n\nEither way, principle (6), or something like it, would be something\nwith which relevant design inferences would begin. Further\ninvestigation of (6) requires taking a closer look at the Rs\nwhich (6) involves.\n2.2.2 R Concerns: Round 2\n\nOne thing complicating general assessments of design arguments is that\nthe evidential force of specific Rs is affected by the\ncontext of their occurrence. Specifically, properties which seem to\nconstitute marks of design in known artifacts often seem to have\nsignificantly less evidential import outside that context. For\ninstance, we typically construe enormous complexity in something known\nto be a manufactured artifact as a deliberately intended and produced\ncharacteristic. But mere complexity in contexts not taken to involve\nartifacts (the precise arrangement of pine needles on a forest floor,\nfor instance) does not seem to have that same force. In the case of\nnatural objects, it is less clear that such complexity\u2014as well\nas the other traditional empirical Rs\u2014bespeaks\nintention, plan, and purpose.\n\nFurthermore, even within those two contexts\u2014artifact and\nnature\u2014the various Rs exhibit varying degrees of\nevidential force. For instance, even in an artifact, mere complexity\nof whatever degree speaks less clearly of intent than does an engraved\nsentence. As most critics of design arguments point out, the examples\nfound in nature are not of the \u201cengraved sentence\u201d\nsort.\n2.2.3 Gaps and Their Discontents\n\nEvidential ambiguity would virtually disappear if it became clear that\nthere is no plausible means of producing some R independent\nof deliberate intent. Part of the persuasiveness of (6) historically\ncame from absence of any known plausible non-intentional alternative\ncausal account of the traditional Rs. Such cases are often\nlinked to alleged gaps in nature\u2014phenomena for which, it is\nclaimed, there can be no purely natural explanation, there being a gap\nbetween nature\u2019s production capabilities and the phenomenon in\nquestion. (For example, nature\u2019s unaided capabilities fall short\nof producing a radio.) Design cases resting upon nature\u2019s\nalleged inability to produce some relevant \u2018natural\u2019\nphenomenon are generally assumed to explicitly or implicitly appeal to\nsupernatural agency, and are typically described as\n\u201cGod-of-the-gaps\u201d arguments\u2014a description usually\nintended to be pejorative.\n\nThe position that there are causal gaps in nature is not\ninherently irrational\u2014and would seem to be a legitimate\nempirical question. But although gaps would profoundly strengthen\ndesign arguments, they have their suite of difficulties. Gaps are\nusually easy to spot in cases of artifactuality (take the radio\nexample, again), but although they may be present in nature,\nestablishing their existence there can usually be done (by\nscience, at least) only indirectly\u2014via probability\nconsiderations, purported limitations on nature\u2019s abilities,\netc.\n\nSeveral possible snags lurk. Gaps in nature would, again, suggest\nsupernatural agency, and some take science to operate under an\nobligatory exclusion of such. This prohibition\u2014commonly known as\nmethodological naturalism\u2014is often claimed (mistakenly,\nsome argue) to be definitive of genuine\n science.[5]\n While such \u201cestablished\u201d limitations on science have been\noverturned in the past, the spotty track record of alleged gaps\nprovides at least a cautionary note. Purported gaps have been closed\nby new scientific theories postulating means of natural production of\nphenomena previously thought to be beyond nature\u2019s capabilities.\nThe most obvious example of that is, of course, Darwin\u2019s\nevolutionary theory and its descendants.\n2.3 Inferences to the Best Explanation/Abductive Design Arguments: Schema 3\n\nSome philosophers of science claim that in a wide variety of\nscientific cases we employ an \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d\n (IBE).[6]\n The basic idea is that if one among a number of competing candidate\nexplanations is overall superior to others in significant\nrespects\u2014enhanced likelihood, explanatory power and scope,\ncausal adequacy, plausibility, evidential support, fit with\nalready-accepted theories, predictiveness, fruitfulness, precision,\nunifying power, and the like\u2014then we are warranted in\n(provisionally) accepting that candidate as the right explanation\ngiven the evidence in question (Lipton 1991, 58). Some advocates see\ndesign arguments as inferences to the best explanation, taking design\nexplanations\u2014whatever their weaknesses\u2014as prima\nfacie superior to chance, necessity, chance-driven evolution, or\nwhatever.\n\nA general schema deployed in the current case would give us the\nfollowing:\n\n\nSchema 3:\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) exhibit\nexquisite complexity, delicate adjustment of means to ends (and other\nrelevant R characteristics).\nThe hypothesis that those characteristics are products of\ndeliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) would adequately\nexplain them.\nIn fact, the hypothesis that those characteristics are products of\ndeliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) is the best\navailable overall explanation of them.\n\n\nTherefore (probably)\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products\nof deliberate, intentional design (i.e., the Design Hypothesis is\nlikely true).\n\n\n\nIn arguments of this type, superior explanatory virtues of a theory\nare taken as constituting epistemic support for the acceptability of\nthe theory or for the likely truth of the theory.\n\nThere are, of course, multitudes of purported explanatory, epistemic\nvirtues, including the incomplete list a couple of paragraphs back.\nAssessing hypotheses in terms of such virtues is often contentious.\nThe assessment of \u2018best\u2019 is not only a value-tinged\njudgment, but is notoriously tricky (especially given the ambiguous\nand hard to pinpoint import of the Rs in the present case).\nThere is also the very deep question of why we should think that\nfeatures which we humans find attractive in proposed explanations\nshould be thought to be truth-tracking. What sort of justification\nmight be available here?\n2.3.1 IBE, Likelihood and Bayes\n\nOne key underlying structure in this context is typically traced to\nPeirce\u2019s notion of abduction. Suppose that some\notherwise surprising fact e would be a reasonably expectable\noccurrence were hypothesis h true. That, Peirce\nargued, would constitute at least some provisional reason for thinking\nthat h might be true. Peirce\u2019s own characterization was\nas follows (Peirce 1955, 151):\n\n\nSchema 3:\n\nThe surprising fact, C, is observed.\nBut if A were true, C would be a matter of\ncourse.\n\n\nHence,\n\nThere is reason to suspect that A is true.\n\n\n\nThe measure of C being a \u2018matter of course\u2019 given\nA is frequently described as the degree to which C\ncould be expected were A true. This intuition is\nsometimes\u2014though explicitly not by Peirce\nhimself\u2014formalized in terms of likelihood, defined as\nfollows:\n\nThe likelihood of hypothesis \\(h\\) (given evidence \\(e\\)) =\n\\(P(e | h)\\)\n\n\nThe likelihood of h is the probability of finding evidence\ne given that the hypothesis h is true. In cases of\ncompeting explanatory hypotheses \\(h_1\\) and\n\\(h_2\\) the comparative likelihoods on specified\nevidence can be taken to indicate which of the competitors the\nevidence better supports, i.e.:\n\nLikelihood Principle:\n\n\\( [P(e| h_1) > P(e|h_2)] \\leftrightarrow\\)\n(\\(e\\) supports \\(h_1\\) more than it does \\(h_2\\))\n\n\nHigher likelihood of \\(h_1\\) than \\(h_2\\) on specific evidence does\nnot automatically imply that \\(h_1\\) is likely to be true, or is\nbetter in some overall sense than is \\(h_2\\).  \\(h_1\\) might, in fact,\nbe a completely lunatic theory which nonetheless entails e,\ngiving \\(h_1\\) as high a likelihood as possible. Such maximal\nlikelihood relative to e would not necessarily alter\n\\(h_1\\)\u2019s lunacy. Likelihood thus does not automatically\ntranslate into a measure of how strongly some specific evidence\ne supports the hypothesis \\(h_1\\) in question (Jantzen 2014a,\nChap.  11). Given this limitation, some argue that only a full-blown\nBayesian analysis should be used to assess competing hypotheses. For a\ncontrast between IBE and Bayesianism, see the entry on abduction.\nFor an important recent critique of theistic design arguments in\nBayesian terms, see Sober 2009, the reply in Kotzen 2012, and\nthe response in Jantzen 2014b.\n\nThere are other potential issues here as well. Sober argues that\nwithout additional very specific assumptions about the putative\ndesigner we could specify no particular value for \\(P(e | h)\\) \u2014\ne.g., the likelihood that a designer would produce vertebrate eyes\nwith the specific features we observe. Depending on the specific\nassumptions made we could come up with any value from 0 to 1 (e.g.,\nSober 2003, 38).  Jantzen argues that the same problem applies to any\nlikelihood involving chance as an alternative hypothesis to\ndesign. Chance is equally vague. If we allow the naturalist to fill it\nout in ways that reduce this vagueness, the design theorist should be\naccorded the same benefit (Jantzen 2014a, 184).\n\nThere is also the potential problem of new, previously unconsidered\nhypotheses all lumped together in the catch-all basket. Without\nknowing the details of what specific unconsidered hypotheses might\nlook like, there is simply no plausible way to anticipate the apparent\nlikelihood of a novel new hypothesis. This, on some views, is\nessentially what happened with traditional design arguments. Such\narguments were the most reasonable available until Darwinian evolution\nprovided a plausible (or better) alternative the details and\nlikelihood of which were not previously anticipatable. We should note\nthat the problem of unconsidered hypotheses is an issue for all\nlikelihood arguments, not merely those involving design.\n3. Alternative Explanation\n\nWithout going into the familiar details, Darwinian processes fueled by\nundesigned, unplanned, chance variations that are in turn conserved or\neliminated by way of natural selection would, it is argued, over time\nproduce organisms exquisitely adapted to their environmental\n niches.[7]\n And since many of the characteristics traditionally cited as\nevidences of design just were various adaptations, evolution\nwould thus produce entities exactly fitting traditional criteria of\ndesign. Natural selection, then, unaided by intention or intervention\ncould account for the existence of many (perhaps all) of the\nRs which we find in biology. (A parallel debate can be found\nbetween those who believe that life itself requires a design\nexplanation (Meyer 2009) and those proposing naturalistic explanations;\nsee the entry on\n life.)\n\nThat was\u2014and is\u2014widely taken as meaning that design\narguments depending upon specific biological gaps would be\nweakened\u2014perhaps fatally.\n\nPremise (10)\u2014not to mention the earlier (6)\u2014would thus\nlook to simply be false. What had earlier appeared to be\npurpose (requiring intent) was now apparently revealed as\nmere unintended but successful and preserved function.\n\nOf course, relevant premises being false merely undercuts the relevant\nschemas in present form\u2014it does not necessarily refute either\nthe basic design intuition or other forms of design arguments. But\nsome critics take a much stronger line here. Richard Dawkins, for\ninstance, subtitles one of his books: \u201cWhy the evidence of\nevolution reveals a universe without design\u201d (Dawkins, 1987).\nTypically underlying claims of this sort is the belief that Darwinian\nevolution, by providing a relevant account of the origin and\ndevelopment of adaptation, diversity, and the like, has explained away\nthe alleged design in the biological realm\u2014and an attendant\ndesigner\u2014in much the same way that kinetic theory has explained\naway caloric. Indeed, this is a dominant idea underlying current\nresponses to design arguments. However, undercutting and explaining\naway are not necessarily the same thing, and exactly what explaining\naway might mean, and what a successful explaining away might require\nare typically not clearly specified. So before continuing, we need\nclarity concerning some relevant conceptual landscape.\n3.1 Explaining Away[8]\n\nThat an alleged explanatory factor \u03b1 is provisionally explained\naway requires that there be an alternative explanation \u03a3 meeting\nthese conditions:\n\n\u03a3 is explanatorily adequate to the relevant phenomenon\n(structure, property, entity, event)\n\u03a3 can be rationally supported in terms of available (or\nlikely) evidence\n\u03a3 is relevantly superior to the original in terms either of\nadequacy or support\n\u03a3 requires no essential reference to \u03b1\n\n\nHowever, (a) \u2013 (d) are incomplete in a way directly relevant to\nthe present discussion. Here is a very simple case. Suppose that an\nelderly uncle dies in suspicious circumstances, and a number of the\nrelatives believe that the correct explanation is the direct agency of\na niece who is primary heir, via deliberately and directly\nadministering poison. However, forensic investigation establishes that\nthe cause of death was a mix-up among medications the uncle was\ntaking\u2014an unfortunate confusion. The suspicious relatives,\nhowever, without missing an explanatory beat shift the niece\u2019s\nagency back one level, proposing that the mix-up itself was\norchestrated by the niece\u2014switching contents of prescription\nbottles, no doubt. And that might very well turn out to be the\ntruth.\n\nIn that sort of case, the \u03b1 in question (e.g., niecely agency)\nis no longer directly appealed to in the relevant initial explanatory\nlevel, but is not removed from all explanatory relevance to the\nphenomenon in question. In general, then, for \u03b1 to be explained\naway in the sense of banished from all explanatory relevance the\nfollowing condition must also be met:\n\nno reference to \u03b1 is required at any explanatory level\nunderlying \u03a3\n\n\nRoughly this means that \u03a3 does not depend essentially on any\npart \u03b2 of any prior explanation where \u03b1 is essential to\n\u03b2. There are some additional possible technical qualifications\nrequired, but the general intuition should be clear.\n\nThus, e.g., whereas there was no need to appeal to caloric at some\nprior or deeper level, with design, according to various design\nadvocates, there is still an explanatory lacuna (or implicit\npromissory note) requiring reference to design at some explanatory\nlevel prior to Darwinian evolution. Indeed, as some see it (and as\nPaley himself suggested), there are phenomena requiring explanation in\ndesign terms which cannot be explained away at any prior explanatory\nlevel (short of the ultimate level).\n\nThat some phenomenon \u03b1 has been explained away can be taken to\nmean two very different things\u2014either as\n\nshowing that it is no longer rational to believe that \u03b1\nexists\n\n\nor as\n\nshowing that \u03b1 does not exist\n\n\n(And often, of course, both.)\n\nFor instance, few would assert that there is still an extant rational\ncase for belief in phlogiston\u2014any explanatory work it did at the\nproximate level seems to have ceased, and deeper explanatory uses for\nit have never subsequently materialized. Perhaps its non-existence was\nnot positively established immediately, but removal of rational\njustification for belief in some entity can morph into a case for\nnon-existence as the evidence for a rival hypothesis increases over\ntime.\n3.1.1 Level-shifting\n\nPurported explanations can be informally divided into two broad\ncategories\u2014those involving agents, agency, intention, and the\nlike; and those involving mechanism, physical causality, natural\nprocesses, and the like. The distinction is not clean (functioning\nartifacts typically involve both), but is useful enough in a rough and\nready way, and in what follows agent explanations and mechanical\nexplanations respectively will be used as convenient handles. Nothing\npernicious is built into either the broad distinction or the specified\nterminology.\n\nThere are some instructive patterns that emerge in explanatory\nlevel-shifting attempts, and in what immediately follows some of the\nmore basic patterns will be identified.\n(a) Agent explanations\n\nIntention, intervention, and other agency components of explanations\ncan very frequently be pushed back to prior levels\u2014much as many\ndefenders of teleological arguments claim. The earlier case of the\nalleged poisoning of the rich uncle by the niece is a simple example\nof this.\n\nBut in some cases, the specifics of the agent explanation in question\nmay appeal to some prior level less plausible or sensible. For\nexample, suppose that one held the view that crop circles were to be\nexplained in terms of direct alien activity. One could, upon getting\nirrefutable video proof of human production of crop circles, still\nmaintain that aliens were from a distance controlling the brains of\nthe humans in question, and that thus the responsibility for crop\ncircles did still lie with alien activity. While this retreat of\nlevels preserves the basic explanation, it of course comes with a\nsignificant cost in inherent implausibility.\n\nStill the level-changing possibility is as a general rule available\nwith proposed agent explanations.\n(b) Mechanical explanations\n\nPushing specific explanatory factors back to a prior level often works\nless smoothly in cases of purely mechanical/physical explanations than\nin intentional/agency explanations. In many attempted mechanistic\nrelocation cases, it is difficult to see how the specific relocated\nexplanatory factor is even supposed to work, much less generate any\nnew explanatory traction. Exactly what would caloric do if pushed back\none level, for instance?\n\nAlthough level shifting of specific explanatory factors seems to work\nless easily within purely physical explanations, relocation attempts\ninvolving broad physical principles can sometimes avoid such\ndifficulties. For instance, for centuries determinism was a basic\nbackground component of scientific explanations (apparently stochastic\nprocesses being explained away epistemically). Then, early in the 20th\ncentury physics was largely converted to a quantum mechanical picture\nof nature as involving an irreducible indeterminism at a fundamental\nlevel\u2014apparently deterministic phenomena now being what was\nexplained away. However, DeBroglie, Bohm and others (even for a time\nEinstein) tried to reinstate determinism by moving it back to an even\ndeeper fundamental level via hidden variable theories. Although the\nhidden variable attempt is generally thought not to be successful, its\nfailure is not a failure of principle.\n3.1.2 Possible disputes\n\nHow one assesses the legitimacy, plausibility, or likelihood of the\nspecific counter-explanation will bear substantial weight here, and\nthat in turn will depend significantly on among other things\nbackground beliefs, commitments, metaphysical dispositions, and the\nlike. If one has a prior commitment to some key \u03b1 (e.g., to\ntheism, atheism, naturalism, determinism, materialism, or teleology),\nor assigns a high prior to that \u03b1, the plausibility of taking\nthe proposed (new) explanation as undercutting, defeating, or refuting\n\u03b1 (and/or \u03a3) will be deeply affected, at least\ninitially.\n\nTilting the conceptual landscape via prior commitments is both an\nequal opportunity epistemic necessity and a potential pitfall\nhere. Insisting on pushing an explanatory factor back a level is often\nan indication of a strong prior commitment of some sort. Disagreement\nover deeper philosophical or other principles will frequently generate\ndivergence over when something has or has not been explained away. One\nside, committed to the principle, will accept a level change as\nembodying a deeper insight into the relevant phenomenon. The other,\nrejecting the principle, will see an ad hoc retreat to defend an\n\u03b1 which has in fact been explained away.\n\nReturning to the present issue, design argument advocates will of\ncourse reject the claim that design, teleology, agency and the like\nhave been explained away either by science generally or by Darwinian\nevolution in particular. Reasons will vary. Some will see any\nscience\u2014Darwinian evolution included\u2014as incompetent to say\nanything of ultimate design relevance, pro or con. (Many on\nboth sides of the design issue fit here.) Some will see Darwinian\nevolution as failing condition (a), (b) and/or (c), claiming that\nDarwinian evolution is not explanatorily adequate to selected\n\u03b1\u2019s, is inadequately supported by the evidence, and is far\nfrom superior to agency explanations of relevant phenomena.\n(Creationists and some\u2014not all\u2014\u2018intelligent\ndesign\u2019 advocates fit here.) Some will argue that a Darwinian\nfailure occurs at (d), citing e.g., a concept of information\nclaimed to be both essential to evolution and freighted with agency.\n(Some intelligent design advocates fit here; see Dembski 2002 and\nMeyer 1998.) However, the major contention of present interest\ninvolves (e).\n3.2 Indirect Causation, Design and Evidences\n\nHistorically, design cases were in fact widely understood to allow for\nindirect intelligent agent design and causation, the very\ncausal structures producing the relevant phenomena being themselves\ndeliberately designed for the purpose of producing those\n phenomena.[9]\n For instance, it was typically believed that God could have initiated\nspecial conditions and processes at the instant of creation which\noperating entirely on their own could produce organisms and other\nintended (and designed) results with no subsequent agent intervention\nrequired. Paley himself, the authors of the Bridgewater\nTreatises and others were explicitly clear that whether or not\nsomething was designed was an issue largely separable from the means\nof production in question. Historically it was insisted that design in\nnature did track back eventually to intelligent agency\nsomewhere and that any design we find in nature would\nnot\u2014and could not\u2014have been there had there ultimately\nbeen no mind involved. But commentators (including many scientists) at\nleast from the early 17th century on (e.g., Francis Bacon and Robert\nBoyle) very clearly distinguished the creative initiating of nature\nitself from interventions within the path of nature once initiated.\nFor instance, over two centuries before Darwin, Bacon wrote:\n\nGod \u2026 doth accomplish and fulfill his divine will [by ways] not\nimmediate and direct, but by compass; not violating Nature, which is\nhis own law upon the creation. (Quoted in Whewell 1834, 358)\n\n\nIndeed, if the Rs in question did directly indicate the\ninfluence of a mind, then means of production\u2014whether unbroken\ncausation or gappy\u2014would be of minimal evidential importance.\nThus, the frequent contemporary claim that design arguments all\ninvolve appeal to special divine intervention during the course of\nnature\u2019s history\u2014that in short design arguments are\n\u201cGod-of-the-gaps\u201d arguments\u2014represents serious\nhistorical (and present) inaccuracy.\n\nHowever, if Rs result from gapless chains of natural causal\nprocesses, the evidential impact of those Rs again threatens\nto become problematic and ambiguous, since there will a\nfortiori be at the immediate level a full natural causal account\nfor\n them.[10]\n Design will, in such cases, play no immediate mechanistic explanatory\nrole, suggesting its superfluousness. But even if such conceptions\nwere explanatorily and scientifically superfluous at that level, that\ndoes not entail that they are conceptually, alethically, inferential,\nor otherwise superfluous in general. The role of mind might be\nindirect, deeply buried, or at several levels of remove from the\nimmediate production mechanism but would still have to be present at\nsome level. In short, on the above picture Darwinian evolution will\nnot meet condition (e) for explaining away design, which is not itself\na shortcoming of Darwinian evolution.\n\nBut any gap-free argument will depend crucially upon the Rs\nin question being ultimately dependent for their eventual\noccurrence upon agent activity. That issue could be integrated back\ninto an altered Schema 2 by replacing (6) with:\n\n(6a) Design-like properties (R) are (most probably) not\nproducible by means ultimately devoid of\nmind/intention\u2014i.e., any phenomena exhibiting such Rs\nmust be a product (at least indirectly) of intentional design.\n\n\nThe focus must now become whether or not the laws and conditions\nrequired for the indirect production of life, intelligent life, etc.,\ncould themselves be independent of intention, design, and mind at some\ndeep (perhaps primordial, pre-cosmic) point. In recent decades,\nexactly that question has arisen increasingly insistently from within\nthe scientific community.\n4. Further Contemporary Design Discussions\n4.1 Cosmological: Fine-tuning\n\nIntuitively, if the laws of physics were different, the evolution of\nlife would not have taken the same path. If gravity were stronger, for\nexample, then flying insects and giraffes would most likely not exist.\nContemporary physics provides significantly more drama to the story.\nEven an extraordinarily small change in one of many key parameters in\nthe laws of physics would have made life impossible anywhere in the\nuniverse. Consider two examples:\n\nThe expansion rate of the universe is represented by the\ncosmological constant \u039b. If \u039b were slighter greater,\nthere would be no energy sources, such as stars. If it were slightly\nless, the Big Bang would have quickly led to a Big Crunch in which the\nuniverse collapsed back onto itself. For life to be possible, \u039b\ncannot vary more than one part in 1053 (Collins 2003)\n\nLife depends on, among other things, a balance of carbon and\noxygen in the universe. If the strong nuclear force were different by\n0.4%, there would not be enough of one or the other for life to exist\n(Oberhummer, Cs\u00f3t\u00f3, and Schlattl 2000). Varying this\nconstant either way \u201cwould destroy almost all carbon or almost\nall oxygen in every star\u201d (Barrow 2002, 155). \n\n\nMany examples of fine-tuning have to do with star formation. Stars are\nimportant since life requires a variety of elements: oxygen, carbon,\nhydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Stars contain the only\nknown mechanism for producing large quantities of these elements and\nare therefore necessary for life. Lee Smolin estimates that when all\nof the fine-tuning examples are considered, the chance of stars\nexisting in the universe is 1 in 10229. \u201cIn my\nopinion, a probability this tiny is not something we can let go\nunexplained. Luck will certainly not do here; we need some rational\nexplanation of how something this unlikely turned out to be the\ncase\u201d (Smolin 1999, 45). Smolin is not merely claiming that all\nimprobable events require an explanation, but some improbable events\nare special. (In poker, every set of five cards dealt to the dealer\nhas the same probability, assuming that the cards are shuffled\nsufficiently. If the dealer is dealt a pair on three successive hands,\nno special explanation is required. If the dealer is dealt a royal\nflush on three successive hands, an explanation would rightly be\ndemanded, and the improbability of this case isn\u2019t even close to\nthe magnitude of the improbability that Smolin mentioned.) Physicists\nwho have written on fine-tuning agree with Smolin that it cries out\nfor an explanation. (What physicists in general think is, of course,\nharder to determine.) One explanation is that the universe appears to\nbe fine-tuned for the existence of life because it literally has been\nconstructed for life by an intelligent agent.\n\nThere are two other types of responses to fine-tuning: (i) it does\nnot, in fact, require a special explanation, and (ii) there are\nalternative explanations to theistic design. Let\u2019s briefly\nconsider these (also see the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n4.1.1 No explanation needed\n\nThree approaches have been taken to undermine the demand for\nexplanation presented by fine-tuning.\n4.1.1.1 Weak anthropic principle\n\nIn a sense, it is necessary for the fine-tuned constants to have\nvalues in the life-permitting range: If those values were not within\nthat range, people would not exist. The fine-tuned constants\nmust take on the values that they have in order for\nscientists to be surprised by their discovery in the first place. They\ncould not have discovered anything else. According to the weak\nanthropic principle, we ought not to be surprised by having made such\na discovery, since no other observation was possible. But if we should\nnot have been surprised to have made such a discovery, then there is\nnothing unusual here that requires a special explanation. The demand\nfor explanation is simply misplaced.\n4.1.1.2 Observational selection effect\n\nSober gives a related but stronger argument based on observational\nselection effects (Sober 2009, 77\u201380). Say that Jones nets a\nlarge number of fish from a local lake, all of which are over 10\ninches long. Let \\(h_{\\textrm{all}}\\) = \u2018all of the fish in the lake\nare over 10 inches long\u2019 and \\(h_{1/2}\\) = \u2018Half of the\nfish in the lake are over 10 inches long\u2019. The evidence \\(e\\) is\nsuch that \\(P(e|h_{\\textrm{all}}) >\nP(e | h_{1/2})\\). Now say that Jones discovers\nthat his net is covered with 10 inch holes, preventing him from\ncapturing any smaller fish. In that case, \\(e\\) does not favor one\nhypothesis over the other. The evidence \\(e\\) is an artifact of the net\nitself, not a random sample of the fish in the lake.\n\nWhen it comes to fine-tuning, Sober considers\n\\(h_{\\textrm{design}}\\) = \u2018the constants have been set in place by an\nintelligence, specifically God\u2019, and\n\\(h_{\\textrm{chance}}\\) = \u2018the constants are what they are as a matter\nof mindless random chance\u2019. While intuitively\n\n\\(P(\\textrm{constants are just right for life} | h_{\\textrm{design}}) >\\) \n  \\(\\;\\; P(\\textrm{constants are just right for life} | h_{\\textrm{chance}}) \\)\n\n\none has to consider the role of the observer, who is analogous to the\nnet in the fishing example. Since human observers could only detect\nconstants in the life-permitting range, Sober argues, the correct\nprobabilities are\n\n\\( P(\\textrm{you observe that the constants are right} |\nh_{\\textrm{design}} \\amp \\textrm{you exist}) =\\) \n\\(\\;\\; P(\\textrm{you\nobserve that the constants are right} | h_{\\textrm{chance}} \\amp\n\\textrm{you exist}) \\)\n\n\nGiven this equality, fine-tuning does not favor \\(h_{\\textrm{design}}\\)\nover \\(h_{\\textrm{chance}}\\). The selection effect prevents any\nconfirmation of design.\n\nSober\u2019s analysis is critiqued in Monton 2006 and Kotzen\n2012. Also see Jantzen 2014a (sec. 18.4). We should note that if\nSober is correct, then the naturalistic explanations for fine-tuning\nconsidered below (4.1.2) are likewise misguided.\n4.1.1.3 Probabilities do not apply\n\nLet C stand for a fine-tuned parameter with physically\npossible values in the range [0, \u221e). If we assume that nature is\nnot biased toward one value of C rather than another, then\neach unit subinterval in this range should be assigned equal\nprobability. Fine-tuning is surprising insofar as the life-permitting\nrange of C is tiny compared to the full interval, which\ncorresponds to a very small probability.\n\nAs McGrew, McGrew & Vestrup argue (2001), there is a problem here\nin that, strictly speaking, mathematical probabilities do not apply in\nthese circumstances. When a probability distribution is defined over a\nspace of possible outcomes, it must add up to exactly 1. But for any\nuniform distribution over an infinitely large space, the sum of the\nprobabilities will grow arbitrarily large as each unit interval is\nadded up. Since the range of C is infinite, McGrew et\nal.  conclude that there is no sense in which life-friendly\nuniverses are improbable; the probabilities are mathematically\nundefined.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to truncate the interval of possible\nvalues. Instead of allowing C to range from [0, \u221e), one\ncould form a finite interval [0, N], where N is very\nlarge relative to the life-permitting range of C. A\nprobability distribution could then be defined over the truncated\nrange.\n\nA more rigorous account employs measure theory. Measure is sometimes\nused in physics as a surrogate for probability. For example, there are\nmany more irrational numbers than rational ones. In measure theoretic\nterms, almost all real numbers are irrational, where\n\u201calmost all\u201d means all but a set of zero measure. In\nphysics, a property found for almost all of the solutions to an\nequation requires no explanation; it\u2019s what one should expect.\nIt\u2019s not unusual, for instance, for a pin balancing on its tip\nto fall over. Falling over is to be expected. In contrast, if a\nproperty that has zero measure in the relevant space were actually\nobserved to be the case, like the pin continuing to balance on its\ntip, that would demand a special explanation (Earman 1987, 315).\nAssuming one\u2019s model for the system is correct, nature appears\nto be strongly biased against such behavior (Gibbons, Hawking &\nStewart 1987, 736). The argument for fine-tuning can thus be recast\nsuch that almost all values of C are outside of the\nlife-permitting range. The fact that our universe is life-permitting\nis therefore in need of explanation.\n\nThe question of whether probabilities either do not apply or have been\nimproperly applied to cosmological fine-tuning continues to draw\ninterest. For more, see Davies 1992, Callender 2004, Holder\n2004, Koperski 2005, Manson 2009, Jantzen 2014a (sec. 18.3), and\nSober 2019 (sec. 5.1). Manson (2018) argues that neither theism nor\nnaturalism provides a better explanation for fine-tuning.\n4.1.2 Rival explanations\n\nAssuming that fine-tuning does require an explanation, there are\nseveral approaches one might take (Koperski 2015, section 2.4).\n4.1.2.1 Scientific progress\n\nThat the universe is fine-tuned for life is based on current science.\nJust as current science explained or explained away many past\nanomalies, future science may explain or explain away fine-tuning.\nScience may one day find a naturalistic answer, eliminating the need\nfor design. For suggestions along these lines, see Harnik, Kribs &\nPerez 2006, and Loeb 2014.\n\nWhile this is a popular stance, it is a promissory note rather than an\nexplanation. The appeal to what might yet be discovered is not itself\na rival hypothesis.\n4.1.2.2 Exotic life\n\nIt\u2019s conceivable that life could exist in a universe with\nparameter values that we do not typically believe are life-permitting.\nIn other words, there may be exotic forms of life that could survive\nin a very different sort of universe. If so, then perhaps the\nparameter intervals that are in fact life-permitting are not\nfine-tuned after all.\n\nThe main difficulty with this suggestion is that all life requires a\nmeans for overcoming the second law of thermodynamics. Life requires\nthe extraction of energy from the environment. Any life-form\nimaginable must therefore have systems that allow for something like\nmetabolism and respiration, which in turn require a minimal amount of\ncomplexity (e.g., there can be no single-molecule life forms). Many\nexamples of fine-tuning do not allow for such complexity, however. If\nthere were no stars, for example, then there would be no stable\nsources of energy and no mechanism for producing the heavier elements\nin the periodic table. Such a universe would lack the chemical\nbuilding blocks needed for a living entity to extract energy from the\nenvironment and thereby resist the pull of entropy.\n4.1.2.3 Multiverse\n\nWhile the odds of winning a national lottery are low, your odds would\nobviously increase if you were to buy several million tickets. The\nsame idea applies to the most popular explanation for fine-tuning: a\nmultiverse. Perhaps physical reality consists of a massive array of\nuniverses each with a different set of values for the relevant\nconstants. If there are many\u2014perhaps infinitely\nmany\u2014universes, then the odds of a life-permitting universe\nbeing produced would seem to be much greater. While most of the\nuniverses in the multiverse would be unfit for life, so the argument\ngoes, ours is one of the few where all of the constants have the\nrequired values.\n\nWhile the philosophical literature on the multiverse continues to grow\n(see Collins 2009, 2012, and Kraay 2014), many of the arguments\nagainst it share a common premise: a multiverse would not, by itself,\nbe a sufficient explanation of fine-tuning. More would have to be\nknown about the way in which universes are produced. By analogy, just\nbecause a roulette wheel has 38 spaces does not guarantee that the\nprobability of Red 25 is 1/38. If the wheel is rigged in some\nway\u2014by using magnets for example\u2014to prevent that outcome,\nthen the probability might be extremely small. If the table were\nrigged and yet Red 25 was the actual winner, that would\nrequire a special explanation. Likewise, one would have to know\nwhether universe production within the multiverse is biased for,\nagainst, or is indifferent to the life-permitting values of the\nrelevant constants. Depending on the outcome, the existence of a\nmultiverse might or might not explain fine-tuning.\n\nA more pressing problem would be the proliferation of \u201cBoltzmann\nbrains\u201d (BB) in a multiverse (Carroll 2020). BBs are intelligent\nbeings produced by quantum fluctuations. The beliefs of such\nnonstandard observers are formed by random processes and therefore\nlack rational support. Since there would be many orders of magnitude\nmore BBs than standard observers in a multiverse, it is statistically\nlikely that you are not, in fact, a standard observer after all. This\nfact serves as a defeater for most of your beliefs, including your\nbelief in a multiverse. Belief in a multiverse is therefore\nself-defeating.\n4.2 Biological: Intelligent Design\n\nA high-profile development in design arguments over the past 20 years\nor so involves what has come to be known as Intelligent Design (ID).\nAlthough there are variants, it generally involves efforts to\nconstruct design arguments taking cognizance of various contemporary\nscientific developments (primarily in biology, biochemistry, and\ncosmology)\u2014developments which, as most ID advocates see it, both\nreveal the inadequacy of mainstream explanatory accounts (condition\n(a)) and offer compelling evidence for design in nature at some level\n(condition (e) again).\n\nID advocates propose two specialized Rs\u2014irreducible\ncomplexity (Behe 1996) and specified complex information\n(Dembski 1998,\n 2002).[11]\n Although distinctions are sometimes blurred and while ID arguments\ninvolving each of those Rs tend to be gap arguments,\nan additional focus on mind-reflective aspects of nature is typically\nmore visible in ID arguments citing specified complexity than in\narguments citing irreducible complexity.\n\nThe movement has elicited vociferous criticism and opposition (Pennock\n2000). Opponents have pressed a number of objections against ID\nincluding, inter alia contentions that ID advocates have\nsimply gotten the relevant science wrong, that even where the science\nis right the empirical evidences cited by design advocates do not\nconstitute substantive grounds for design conclusions, that the\nexistence of demonstrably superior alternative explanations for the\nphenomena cited undercuts the cogency of ID cases, and that design\ntheories are not legitimate science, but are just disguised\ncreationism, God-of-the-gaps arguments, religiously motivated,\netc.\n\nWe will not pursue that dispute here except to note that even if the\ncase is made that ID could not count as proper science, which is\n controversial,[12]\n that would not in itself demonstrate a defect in design arguments as\nsuch. Science need not be seen as exhausting the space of legitimate\nconclusions from empirical data. In any case, the floods of vitriol\nflowing from both\n\nsides in the current ID discussion suggest that much more than the\npropriety of selected inferences from particular empirical evidences\nis at issue.\n5. The Persistence of Design Thinking\n\nThat question is: why do design arguments remain so durable if\nempirical evidence is inferentially ambiguous, the arguments logically\ncontroversial, and the conclusions vociferously disputed? One\npossibility is that they really are better arguments than most\nphilosophical critics concede. Another possibility is that design\nintuitions do not rest upon inferences at all. The situation\nmay parallel that of the existence of an external world, the existence\nof other minds, and a number of other familiar matters. The 18th\ncentury Scottish Common Sense philosopher Thomas Reid (and his\ncontemporary followers) argued that we are simply so constructed that\nin certain normally-realized experiential circumstances we simply\nfind that we in fact have involuntary convictions about such\na world, about other minds, and so forth. That would explain why\nhistorical philosophical attempts to reconstruct the\narguments by which such beliefs either arose or were justified were\nsuch notorious failures\u2014failures in the face of which ordinary\nbelief nonetheless proceeded happily and helplessly onward. If a\nsimilar involuntary belief-producing mechanism operated with respect\nto intuitions of design, that would similarly explain why\nargumentative attempts have been less than universally compelling but\nyet why design ideas fail to disappear despite the purported failure\nof such arguments.\n\nA number of prominent figures historically in fact held that we could\ndetermine more or less perceptually that various things in nature were\ncandidates for design attributions\u2014that they were in the\nrequisite respects design-like. Some, like William Whewell,\nheld that we could perceptually identify some things as more than mere\ncandidates for design (1834, 344). Thomas Reid also held a view in\nthis\n region,[13]\n as did Hume\u2019s Cleanthes, and, more recently, Alvin Plantinga\n(2011, 263\u2013264).\n\nIf something like that were the operative process, then ID, in trying\nto forge a scientific link to design in the sense of\ninferences from empirically determined evidences would be\nmisconstructing the actual basis for design belief, as would be design\narguments more generally. It is perhaps telling, in this regard, that\nscientific theorizing typically involves substantial creativity and\nthat the resultant theories are typically novel and unexpected. Design\nintuitions, however, do not seem to emerge as novel construals from\ncreative grappling with data, but are embedded in our thinking nearly\nnaturally\u2014so much so that, again, Crick thinks that biologists\nhave to be immunized against it.\n6. Conclusion\n\nPerception and appreciation of the incredible intricacy and the beauty\nof things in nature\u2014whether biological or cosmic\u2014has\ncertainly inclined many toward thoughts of purpose and design in\nnature, and has constituted important moments of affirmation for those\nwho already accept design positions. Regardless of what one thinks of\nthe arguments at this point, so long as nature has the power to move\nus (as even Kant admitted that the \u2018starry heavens above\u2019\ndid), design convictions and arguments are unlikely to disappear\nquietly.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Babbage, Charles, 1838. <em>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise: A\nFragment</em>, London: J.
