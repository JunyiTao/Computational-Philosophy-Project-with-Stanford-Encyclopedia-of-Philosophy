    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality || Duplication Preserving vs. Duplication Non-Preserving Properties\n2.4 Duplication Preserving vs. Duplication Non-Preserving Properties\n\nThe third characterisation Lewis lists when isolating the concept of\nintrinsicality is that duplicates never differ with respect to their\nintrinsic properties. Lewis holds a further principle that may not be\nobvious from the above quote: that any property with respect to which\nduplicates never differ is intrinsic. Adding this further principle to\nthe characterisation gives us (12).\n\n(12)\n \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff \\(F\\) never differs between duplicates. \n\n\n(12), however, has the following problem. Assume that no man has a\nmass of 500 kg (although it is possible for a man to have a mass of\n500 kg). Since nothing has the property of being a popular man who is\n500 kg, given this assumption, no two duplicates differ in whether\nthey have this property. (12) therefore falsely classifies being a\npopular man who is 500 kg as intrinsic.\n\nDavid Lewis doesn\u2019t face this problem due to his concretist\ntheory of possible worlds. Lewis holds that, in addition to the world\nwe live in, there are many other concrete worlds of the same kind as\nthe world we live in. Moreover, he holds that contained in some of\nthese worlds are 500 kg duplicate men, some of whom are popular, and\nsome of whom are not. Given Lewis\u2019s concretist theory of\npossible worlds, then, being a popular man who is 500 kg is classified\nas extrinsic by (12).\n\nPhilosophers who instead endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can\u2019t accept (12). According to\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds, possible worlds\ndo not contain concrete entities such as 500 kg men as parts.\nAccording to standard abstractionists, then, there are no 500 kg men,\nthere are only possible worlds that represent that there are 500 kg\nmen. Philosophers who endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can replace (12) with (13) (see Moore 1922\nand Francescotti 1999). (Or at least, they can replace (12) with (13)\ngiven they hold that there are things that exist according to\nnon-actual possible worlds that don\u2019t exist according to the\nactual world. Abstractionists who deny this will have to further\nmodify (13).)\n\n(13)\n \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and for any possible worlds\n\\(u\\) and \\(v\\) such that \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at\n\\(v, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(v\\) \n\n\nGiven a standard abstractionist theory of possible worlds, there is a\npossible world \\(u\\) that represents there being a popular 500 kg man\n\\(x\\), and there is another possible world \\(v\\) that represents there\nbeing an unpopular 500 kg man \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) has the same\nintrinsic properties as \\(y\\) at \\(v\\), and hence \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v\\). Given this, (13) classifies being a\npopular man who is 500 kg as extrinsic.\n\nPutting aside for the moment the question of whether (13) correctly\ncharacterises a genuine notion of intrinsicality, let us call the\nnotion it does characterise duplication preservation. (13), understood\nas a characterisation of duplication preservation has two important\nconsequences. First, it has the consequence that identity properties,\nsuch as being Obama, aren\u2019t duplication preserving. The reason\nfor this is that, since Obama could have had a duplicate distinct from\nhimself, there is a possible world at which Obama has a duplicate who\nis not Obama, and hence there is a possible world at which something\nhaving the property of being Obama has a duplicate which lacks this\nproperty.\n\nA more general consequence can be stated using the distinction between\nqualitative and non-qualitative properties, where a qualitative\nproperty is intuitively a property that doesn\u2019t concern any\nparticular entities, while a non-qualitative property is a property\nthat does concern one or more particular entities. Examples of\nqualitative properties include the property of being cubical and the\nproperty of being next to a tin, while examples of non-qualitative\nproperties include the property of being Obama and the property of\nbeing next to Clinton. It plausibly follows from (13), understood as a\ncharacterisation of duplication preservation, that any non-qualitative\nproperty that is possibly instantiated is not a duplication preserving\nproperty.\n\nSay that a property is indiscriminately necessary iff it is\nnecessarily had by everything. The second consequence of (13),\nunderstood as a characterisation of duplication preservation, is that\nany two properties that are indiscriminately necessary are duplication\npreserving. Consider, for example, the indiscriminately necessary\nproperty of being such that there is a number (where we are assuming\nthat numbers necessarily exist). Since all things at all possible\nworlds have this property, it is a duplication preserving\nproperty.\n\nSince being such that there is a number is neither a local property or\nan identity interior property, but is a duplication preserving\nproperty (given numbers necessarily exist), the duplication preserving\nproperties do not coincide with either the local properties or the\nidentity interior properties. Since being Obama is a metaphysical\nnecessitation interior property, but is not a duplication preserving\nproperty, the duplication preserving properties don\u2019t coincide\nwith the metaphysical necessitation interior properties either. (Moore\n(1922) and Dunn (1990), in effect, both distinguish duplication\npreservation from interiority on these grounds.) Hence, we have at\nleast four distinct kinds of properties that are characterised by\nLewis\u2019s three characterisations: local properties, identity\ninterior properties, metaphysical necessitation interior properties,\nand duplication preserving properties.\n\nIf Lewis\u2019s three characterisations concerning intrinsicality\ncharacterise different notions, the three characterisations described\nin section\n 1.2\n concerning having a property in an intrinsic fashion also\ncharacterise different notions. In order to distinguish these notions,\nwe may employ these characterisations to define having a property in a\nduplication preserving fashion, having a property in an interior\nfashion (relative to different entailment relations), and having a\nproperty in a local fashion.\n",
