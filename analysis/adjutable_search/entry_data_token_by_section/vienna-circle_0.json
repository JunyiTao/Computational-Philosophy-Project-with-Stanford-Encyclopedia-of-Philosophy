Introductory Remarks\n\nWhile it is in the nature of philosophical movements and their leading\ndoctrines to court controversy, the Vienna Circle and its philosophies\ndid so more than most. To begin with, its members styled themselves as\nconceptual revolutionaries who cleared the stables of academic\nphilosophy by showing metaphysics not simply to be false, but to be\ncognitively empty and meaningless. In addition, they often associated\ntheir attempt to overcome metaphysics with their public engagement for\nscientific Enlightenment reason in the ever-darkening political\nsituation of 1920s and 1930s central Europe. Small wonder then that\nthe Vienna Circle has sharply divided opinion from the start. There is\nvery little beyond the basic facts of membership and its record of\npublications and conferences that can be asserted about it without\ncourting some degree of controversy. (For English-language survey\nmonographs and articles on the Vienna Circle, see Kraft 1950,\nJorgensen 1951, Ayer 1959b, Passmore 1967, Hanfling 1981, Stadler\n1998, Richardson 2003. Particularly rich in background and\nbio-bibliographical materials is Stadler 1997 [2015]. The best short\nintroductory book has remained untranslated: Haller 1993. For popular overviews see Sigmund 2015 [2018] and Edmonds [2020].)\n\nFortunately, more than three decades worth of recent scholarship in\nhistory of philosophy of science now allows at least some disputes to\nbe put into perspective. (See, e.g., the following at least in part\nEnglish-language collections of articles and research monographs:\nHaller 1982, McGuinness 1985, Rescher 1985, Gower 1987, Proust 1989,\nZolo 1989, Coffa 1991, Spohn 1991, Uebel 1991, Bell and Vossenkuhl\n1992, Sarkar 1992, Uebel 1992, Oberdan 1993, Stadler 1993, Cirera\n1994, Salmon and Wolters 1994, Cartwright, Cat, Fleck and Uebel 1996,\nGiere and Richardson 1996, Nemeth and Stadler 1996, Sarkar 1996,\nRichardson 1998, Friedman 1999, Wolenski and K\u00f6hler 1999, Fetzer\n2000, Friedman 2000, Bonk 2003, Hardcastle and Richardson 2003,\nParrini, Salmon and Salmon 2003, Stadler 2003, Awodey and Klein 2004,\nReisch 2005, Galavotti 2006, Carus 2007, Creath and Friedman 2007,\nNemeth, Schmitz and Uebel 2007, Richardson and Uebel 2007, Uebel 2007,\nWagner 2009, Manninen and Stadler 2010, McGuinness 2011, Symons, Pombo\nand Torres 2011, Creath 2012, Wagner 2012, Damb\u00f6ck 2016,\nPihlstr\u00f6m, Stadler and Weidtmann 2017, Schiemer 2017, Tuboly 2017, Carus 2018, Cat and Tuboly 2019, Makovec and Shapiro 2019.) What distinguishes these works from valuable\ncollections like Schilpp 1963, Hintikka 1975 and Achinstein and Barker\n1979 is that the unspoken assumption, to have understood Vienna Circle\nphilosophy correctly enough so as to consider its consequences\nstraightforward, is questioned in the more recent\nscholarship. Many other pieces of new Vienna Circle scholarship are\nspread throughout philosophical journals and essay collections with\nmore systematic or wider historical scope; important work has also\nbeen done in German, Italian and French language publications but here\nmust remain unreferenced.)\n\nTwo facts must be clearly recognized if a proper evaluation of the\nVienna Circle is to be attempted. The first is, that, despite its\nrelatively short existence, even some of the most central theses of\nthe Vienna Circle underwent radical changes. The second is that its\nmembers were by no means of one mind in all important matters;\noccasionally they espoused perspectives so radically at variance with\neach other that even their ostensive agreements cannot remain wholly\nunquestioned. Behind the rather thin public front, then, quite\ndifferent philosophical projects were being pursued by the leading\nparticipants with, moreover, changing alliances. One way of taking\naccount of this is by speaking (as above) explicitly of the\nphilosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle (and to avoid the\nsingular definite description) while using the expression\n\u201cVienna Circle philosophy\u201d (without an article) in a\nneutral generic sense.\n\nRecent scholarship has provided what the received view of Viennese\nneopositivism lacks: recognition and documentation of the sometimes\nsharply differentiated positions behind the generic surface. This does\nnot invalidate all previous scholarship, including some fundamental\ncriticisms of its positions, but it restores a depth to Vienna Circle\nphilosophy that was absent from the standard histories. The value of\nthis development must not be underestimated, for the recognition of\nthe Vienna Circle\u2019s sophisticated engagement with aspects of the\nphilosophical tradition and contemporaneous challenges calls into\nquestion unwarranted certainties of our own self-consciously\npost-positivist era. While there remains support for the view that\nphilosophical doctrines were held in the Vienna Circle that wholly\nmerited many of the standard criticisms to be cited below, there is\nnow also support for the view that in nearly all such cases, these\ndoctrines were already in their day opposed within the Circle itself.\nWhile some of the Vienna Circle philosophies are dated and may even\nbe, as John Passmore once put it, as dead as philosophies can be,\nothers show signs of surprising vitality. Which ones these are,\nhowever, remains a matter of debate.\n\nThe lead pursued in this article is provided by the comments of a\nlong-time associate of the Vienna Circle, C.G. Hempel, made in\n1991:\n\nWhen people these days talk about logical positivism or the Vienna\nCircle and say that its ideas are pass\u00e9, this is just wrong.\nThis overlooks the fact that there were two quite different schools of\nlogical empiricism, namely the one of Carnap and Schlick and so on and\nthen the quite different one of Otto Neurath, who advocates a\ncompletely pragmatic conception of the philosophy of science\u2026.\nAnd this form of empiricism is in no way affected by any of the\nfundamental objections against logical positivism\u2026. (quoted in\nWolters 2003, 117)\n\n\nWhile differing with Hempel\u2019s specific claim about how\nthe two \u201cschools\u201d divide, the aim here is to fill out his suggestive\npicture by indicating what Schlick, Carnap and Neurath stand for\nphilosophically and why the different wings of the Vienna Circle \nrequire differentiated assessments. After reviewing the basic facts\nand providing an overall outline of Vienna Circle philosophy (in sect.\n2), this article considers various doctrines in greater detail by way\nof discussing standard criticisms with the appropriate distinctions in\nmind (in sect. 3). No comprehensive assessment of the Vienna Circle\nand the work of its members can be attempted here, but some basic\nconclusions will be drawn (in sect. 4).\n",
