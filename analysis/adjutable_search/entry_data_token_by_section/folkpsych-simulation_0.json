The Origins and Varieties of ST\n\nThe idea that we often arrive at representing other people\u2019s\nmental states by mentally simulating those states in ourselves has a\ndistinguished history in philosophy and the human sciences. Robert\nGordon (1995) traces it back to David Hume (1739) and Adam\nSmith\u2019s (1759) notion of sympathy; Jane Heal (2003) and Gordon\n(2000) find simulationist themes in the Verstehen approach to\nthe philosophy of history (e.g., Dilthey 1894); Alvin Goldman (2006)\nconsiders Theodor Lipps\u2019s (1903) account of empathy\n(Einf\u00fchlung) as a precursor of the notion of mental\nsimulation.\n\nIn its modern guise, ST was established in 1986, with the publication\nof Robert Gordon\u2019s \u201cFolk Psychology as Simulation\u201d\nand Jane Heal\u2019s \u201cReplication and Functionalism\u201d.\nThese two articles criticized the Theory-Theory and introduced ST as a\nbetter account of mindreading. In his article, Gordon discussed\npsychological findings concerning the development of the capacity to\nrepresent others\u2019 false beliefs. This attracted the interest of\ndevelopmental psychologists, especially Paul Harris (1989, 1992), who\npresented empirical support for ST, and Alison Gopnik (Gopnik &\nWellman 1992) and Joseph Perner (Perner & Howes 1992), who argued\nagainst it\u2014Perner has since come to defend a hybrid version of\nST (Perner & K\u00fchberger 2005).\n\nAlvin Goldman was an early and influential defender of ST (1989) and\nhas done much to give the theory its prominence. His work with the\nneuroscientist Vittorio Gallese (Gallese & Goldman 1998) was the\nfirst to posit an important connection between ST and the newly\ndiscovered mirror neurons. Goldman\u2019s 2006 book Simulating\nMinds is the clearest and most comprehensive account to date of\nthe relevant philosophical and empirical issues. Among other\nphilosophical proponents of ST, Gregory Currie and Susan Hurley have\nbeen influential.\n\nSince the late 1980s, ST has been one of the central players in the\nphilosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific discussions of\nmindreading. It has however been argued that the fortunes of ST have\nhad a notable negative consequence: the expression \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d has come to be used broadly and in a variety of\nways, making \u201cSimulation Theory\u201d a blanket term lumping\ntogether many distinct approaches to mindreading. Stephen Stich and\nShaun Nichols (1997) already urged dropping it in favor of a\nfiner-grained terminology. There is some merit to this. ST is in fact\nbetter conceived of as a family of theories rather than a\nsingle theory. All the members of the family agree on the thesis that\nmental simulation, rather than a body of knowledge about other minds,\nplays a central role in mindreading. However, different members of the\nfamily can differ from one another in significant respects.\n\nOne fundamental area of disagreement among Simulation Theorists is the\nvery nature of ST\u2014what kind of theory ST is supposed to\nbe\u2014and what philosophers can contribute to it. Some Simulation\nTheorists take the question \u201cHow do people arrive at\nrepresenting others\u2019 mental states?\u201d as a straightforward\nempirical question about the cognitive processes and mechanisms\nunderlying mindreading (Goldman 2006; Hurley 2008). According to them,\nST is thus a theory in cognitive science, to which\nphilosophers can contribute exactly as theoretical physicists\ncontribute to physics: \n\n\ntheorists specialize in creating and tweaking theoretical structures\nthat comport with experimental data, whereas experimentalists have the\nprimary job of generating the data. (Goldman 2006: 22) \n\n\nOther philosophical defenders of ST, however, do not conceive of\nthemselves as theoretical cognitive scientists at all. For example,\nHeal (1998) writes that: \n\n\nit is commonly taken that the inquiry into \u2026 the extent of\nsimulation in psychological understanding is empirical, and that\nscientific investigation is the way to tell whether ST \u2026 is\ncorrect. But this perception is confused. It is an a priori\ntruth \u2026 that simulation must be given a substantial role in our\npersonal-level account of psychological understanding. (Heal 1998:\n477\u2013478) \n\n\nAdjudicating this meta-philosophical dispute goes well beyond the aim\nof this entry. To be as inclusive as we can, we shall adopt a\n\u201cbalanced diet\u201d approach: we shall discuss the extent to\nwhich ST is supported by empirical findings from psychology and\nneuroscience, and, at the same time, we shall dwell on\n\u201cpurely philosophical\u201d problems concerning ST. We leave to\nthe reader the task of evaluating which aspects should be put at the\ncentre of the inquiry.\n\nImportantly, even those who agree on the general nature of ST might\ndisagree on other crucial issues. We will focus on what are typically\ntaken to be the three most important bones of contention among\nSimulation Theorists: what is meant by \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d?\n (section 2).\n What types of simulation processes are there?\n (section 3).\n What is the role of mental simulation in mindreading?\n (section 4).\n After having considered what keeps Simulation Theorists apart, we\nshall move to discuss what holds them together, i.e., the opposition\nto the Theory-Theory of mindreading\n (section 5\n and\n section 6).\n This should give the reader a sense of the \u201cunity amidst\ndiversity\u201d that characterizes ST.\n",
