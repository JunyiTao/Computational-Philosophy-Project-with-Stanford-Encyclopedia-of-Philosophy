    "main_text": "Varieties of Non-Evidentialism\n6. Varieties of Non-Evidentialism\n\nWe have already seen that there are any number of ways in which one\ncan fail to be a strict Evidentialist. One might hold, for instance,\nthat belief need not always be based on evidence (though of\ncourse the moderate Evidentialist could agree with that), or that\nbelief requires evidence but its degree needn't be\nproportioned to the strength of the evidence, or that belief\nrequires evidence but need not be based on that evidence, or\nthat belief requires that there be evidence even if the\nsubject doesn't possess that evidence. No doubt there are\nother ways as well, and the question of whether a particular\nphilosopher counts as an Evidentialist will ultimately hang on how\nEvidentialism itself is construed.\n\nMost important for present purposes, however, is to note that the fact\nthat someone is not a prudential Evidentialist, say, does not\nentail that she is a Non-Evidentialist for prudential\nreasons\u2014or for any other reasons. Indeed, she might still be an\nEvidentialist, but for moral or epistemic rather than prudential\nreasons. As I will use the term, being a Non-Evidentialist\nwith respect to a certain domain of beliefs requires, as a necessary\ncondition, that one is not an Evidentialist of any sort about that\ndomain of beliefs.\n\nI suggested earlier that a natural place to draw the line between\nmoderate Evidentialists and Non-Evidentialists about a domain of\nbeliefs rests on the question of whether belief on the basis of\ninsufficient evidence is ever reasonably required. Are we\never obliged to believe, even in the absence of sufficient evidence?\nStrict and moderate Evidentialists will say no, Non-Evidentialists\nwill say yes. Naturally, the reasons that motivate this putative\nrequirement will be different according to different types of\nNon-Evidentialism. Here the focus will be on the three main types of\nNon-Evidentialism that are prevalent among contemporary philosophers:\nPractical Non-Evidentialism (which includes what is sometimes called\n\u201cpragmatism\u201d), Conservativism, and Fideism.\n",
