    "main_text": "Natural Language Ontology as a Subdiscipline of Both Linguistics and Philosophy || Natural Language Ontology as Part of Descriptive Metaphysics\n2.1 Natural Language Ontology as Part of Descriptive Metaphysics\n\nA dominant contemporary view of metaphysics is that its subject matter\nis that of fundamental reality, the task of metaphysics being, in\nPlato\u2019s words, to \u201ccarve nature at its joints\u201d. If\nthe subject matter of metaphysics is fundamental reality, then natural\nlanguage ontology will have no place in it. There is another view of\nmetaphysics, however, on which metaphysics, at least in part, has as\nits subject matter the general nature of things as reflected\nin a particular range of \u201cdata\u201d. Those data may\nconsist in intuitions, experiences (as in phenomenology), or in\nlinguistic intuitions about the acceptability, truth conditions, and\ninferential relations of natural language sentences (natural language\nontology). On such an approach to metaphysics, it is left open what\nsuch data may reflect, whether it is reality in one sense or another,\na realm of actual but derivative entities, entities constituted by the\nexperience itself, or a realm of conceived reality. Older traditions\nof metaphysics that fall under the approach include the Kantian\ntradition, which deals, for example, with ontological categories, but\nas preconditions of accessing the world, rather than as categories of\nhow things really are, as well as the phenomenological tradition\n(Brentano, Husserl, Ingarden), where ontology was also pursued, but\nbased on how things appear (or are constituted by appearance), rather\nthan assumptions about a mind-independent reality.\n\nIn contemporary analytic philosophy, Strawson\u2019s (1959) notion of\ndescriptive metaphysics most clearly focuses on what is reflected in\ndata. The subject matter of descriptive metaphysics is what Strawson\ncalls our \u201cshared conceptual scheme\u201d, a term indicative of\na Kantian background (see entry on\n Strawson).\n Nowadays descriptive metaphysics is more commonly taken to have as\nits subject matter the ontology reflected in our shared intuitions or\nordinary judgments (since metaphysics is generally taken not to be\nabout representations or concepts, but things and their nature).\nStrawson contrasts descriptive metaphysics with what he calls\n\u201crevisionary metaphysics\u201d, which aims to produce a better\nstructure of our thought (or a better ontology, as one may rather\nsay). Strawson does not elaborate how \u201cbetter\u201d is to be\nunderstood; it may be meant to be metaphysics that better carves\nnature at its joints, provides a better foundation of the natural\nsciences, or is better able to meet whatever the standard a given\nrevisionary metaphysician may have in mind.\n\nGiven the Strawsonian distinction, natural language ontology clearly\nbelongs to descriptive metaphysics, in the sense that its subject\nmatter is the ontology reflected in linguistic intuitions regarding\nthe truth conditions or acceptability of natural language\nsentences.\n\nA distinction somewhat similar to the Strawsonian distinction between\ndescriptive and revisionary metaphysics is Fine\u2019s (2017a)\nalready mentioned distinction between \u201cna\u00efve\nmetaphysics\u201d and \u201cfoundational metaphysics\u201d.\nNa\u00efve metaphysics is interested in the general nature of things,\nwithout regard for whether they are real, with our ordinary judgments\nbeing an important guide. As it does not distinguish between\nappearance and reality, Fine also calls it the \u201cmetaphysics of\nappearances\u201d. The subject matter of foundational metaphysics, by\ncontrast, is the ontology of what there really is, fundamental\nreality. Foundational metaphysics is defined in terms of its subject\nmatter, not in terms of its deviation from na\u00efve metaphysics.\nWhat is novel in Fine\u2019s distinction is how the relation between\nna\u00efve and foundational metaphysics is understood: foundational\nmetaphysics must take na\u00efve metaphysics as its starting point (as\nmentioned in\n \u00a71.3);\n naive metaphysics, by contrast, should be pursued without regard of\nfoundational considerations\n\nGiven the Finean distinction, natural language ontology will be part\nof na\u00efve metaphysics. The term \u201cna\u00efve\nmetaphysics\u201d is potentially misleading, though, when applied to\nnatural language ontology. The ontology implicit in natural language\nneeds to be distinguished from the ontology of what non-philosophers\nnaively think there is or accept upon (naive) reflection (the subject\nmatter of folk metaphysics). The ontology of natural language, by\ncontrast, is the ontology that competent speakers of the language\nimplicitly accept, whether philosophers or non-philosophers and\nwhether they would naively or not so naively agree with it upon\nreflection. For that reason, this entry stays with the better\nestablished and less misleading Strawsonian term \u201cdescriptive\nmetaphysics\u201d, suitably understood.\n\nThe view that descriptive metaphysics is to be pursued without\nfoundational considerations also defines a methodological principle\nfor natural language ontology, which is not always adhered to in\nnatural language semantics, namely that the decision whether to posit\nentities of particular ontological categories as semantic values\nshould not be made based on assumptions about what is fundamental or\nwhat really exists, but rather on the grounds of the semantic behavior\nof expressions.\n\nIt is not clear that natural language ontology can be pursued just as\na form of \u201cmetaphysics of appearances\u201d without\nfoundationalist considerations. Considerations as to what is\nrelatively fundamental certainly enter decisions as to how to\nunderstand derivative entities as semantic values. More importantly,\nconsiderations regarding truth play a central role in semantics as\nwell as natural language ontology. The guiding principle for natural\nlanguage ontology may better be that of giving priority to linguistic\nintuitions over foundationalist considerations when linguistic\nintuitions are available.\n\nOne might think that involving metaphysical considerations in natural\nlanguage ontology means mistakenly imposing a sophisticated\nmetaphysics on the \u201cfolk\u201d (competent speakers that are\nnon-philosophers). Clearly, however, what matters is whether the\nontology posited is the correct one, as the ontology speakers\nimplicitly accept by way of using language, not whether it has been\nposited through reflection by the ontologist.\n",
