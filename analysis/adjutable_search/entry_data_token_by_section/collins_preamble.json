    "main_text": "\n\nAnthony Collins (1676\u20131729) was a wealthy English free-thinker,\ndeist and materialist who in his later years became a country squire\nand local government official in Essex. Along with John Toland,\nCollins was the most significant member of a close knit circle of\nradical free thinkers that arose in England in the first three decades\nof the eighteenth century. This group included such men as Samuel\nBold, Matthew Tindal, Thomas Woolston and William\n Wollaston.[1]\n Collins was a friend of John Locke in Locke\u2019s old age and Locke\nwas one important formative influence on his philosophical views. In\nrespect to his materialism and determinism Collins was clearly\ninfluenced more by Hobbes, Bayle and possibly Spinoza than he was by\nLocke. The Latitudinarians may well have influenced his views about\nfree thinking as well as Locke. Collins\u2019 works had some\ninfluence in England and much more on the continent during the\neighteenth century.\n\nCollins\u2019 central passion is the autonomy of reason particularly\nwith respect to religion. Collins was strongly motivated by an\naversion to religious persecution. Issues revolving around religious\nfreedom are the threads that run through all of his writing. It is\npossible to divide Collins\u2019 works into those that are mainly\nphilosophical and those that are more narrowly religious, but they are\nclearly connected. His 1707\u20138 pamphlet controversy with Samuel\nClarke over whether \u201cmatter can think\u201d and other topics,\nand his book about free will and determinism are chiefly engaged with\nphilosophical topics. Even these topics, however, involve such\nreligious issues as the immortality of the soul and punishment and\nreward in the next life. His writing about reason and free-thinking\nmay be regarded as on the borderline between philosophy and religion.\nAlthough it deals with epistemological and sometimes metaphysical\nissues, it focuses almost entirely on religious issues. His religious\nworks are even more narrowly focused. The Thirty-nine Articles are the\nonly official confessional statement of Anglicanism. Two of\nCollins\u2019 books deal with the authenticity of Article 20 of the\nThirty-nine Articles and whether the church has the power to make\ndoctrine. In large measure, these represent the doctrines of\nfree-thinking applied to the particular case of the Anglican Church.\nCollins also wrote a book examining the question of whether the\nprophecies of Christ\u2019s messiahship could be accepted. This seems\nto be a rejection of Christianity as a revealed religion. How far\nCollins went in the direction of atheism is still a matter of\nscholarly debate.\n\nCollins was clearly a controversial figure in his time; nor has\nscholarly treatment down the years done much better at being\nobjective. As Ernest Campbell Mossner remarks: \n\n\nThe Deists were long subjected to the odium theologicum and\nthe historians of the movement have almost without exception\ndowngraded or slandered them both socially as well as intellectually\nsince the time of John Leland in the eighteenth century. (Mossner\n1967b: 335)\n\n",
