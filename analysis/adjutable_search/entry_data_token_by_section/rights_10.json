When our reasons\nwithin these three different domains conflict, we may have reasons of\ndifferent kinds to act in different ways. Yet there are also rights\nentirely beyond the realm of conduct. These are rights to\nbelieve, to feel and to want. For example,\nthe prime minister asserts that he had a right to believe what his\nadvisors told him. The artist says she has a right to feel angry at\nher critics. The frustrated suburbanite complains he has a right to\nwant more out of life.\n\nThe realm of rights of rights to believe, to feel, and to want are the\nrealms of epistemic, of affective, and of\nconative rights. Together with the realm of rights of\nconduct, these are the four realms of rights. Each of these four\nrealms of rights defines a separate conceptual space: there are no\nepistemic rights to act, and no affective rights to believe. What is\ndistinctive about the three realms of rights beyond the rights of\nconduct is that they seem only to contain only privilege-rights (Wenar\n2003). One may, for example, have a privilege-right to believe what\none\u2019s eyes tell one, and a privilege-right to feel proud of what\none has done. It is interesting to consider why these epistemic,\naffective, and conative realms contain no claims, powers, or\nimmunities.\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in epistemic rights in\nparticular (Altschul 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Graham and\nPedersen 2012), though there is also skepticism about this category\n(Glick 2010). William James, for instance, calls The Will to\nBelieve, \u201can essay in justification of faith, a defense of\nour right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite\nof the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been\ncoerced.\u201d James\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d conclusion in the\nessay is that \u201cwe have the right to believe at our own risk any\nhypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will\u201d (James 1897,\n2, 29). Similarly, the deepest questions in Kant\u2019s philosophy\nare framed in terms of rights. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories aims to\nprove the validity of the employment of the concepts of pure\nunderstanding. In the Critique of Practical Reason, the\nDeduction of Freedom aims to demonstrate our entitlement to regard\nourselves as free. In both Deductions, the central question is\na quaestio iuris: \u201cBy what right?\u201d Kant\u2019s\nquestions are: By what right do we employ the categories; and by what\nright do we think of ourselves as free?\n",
