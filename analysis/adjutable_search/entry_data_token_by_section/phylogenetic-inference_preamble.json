    "main_text": "\n\nPhylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history and\nrelationships among individuals, groups of organisms (e.g.,\npopulations, species, or higher taxa), or other biological entities\nwith evolutionary histories (e.g., genes, biochemicals, or\ndevelopmental mechanisms). Phylogenetic inference is the task\nof inferring this history, and as with other problems of inference,\nthere are interesting and difficult questions regarding how these\ninferences are justified.\n\nIn this entry, we examine what phylogenetic inference is and how it\nworks. In the first section, we briefly introduce the field of\nphylogenetics and its history. In section 2, we explore how\nphylogenetic inference provides useful problems for philosophers to\nexamine, and where philosophical approaches have contributed to the\nscientific examination of phylogenetics. This will help display why\nphylogenetic inference is not merely a biological research problem,\nbut a philosophical one as well. Finally in section 3, we will move to\na discussion of some of the contemporary debates about foundational\nissues in phylogenetics, and what the future of phylogenetic inference\nlooks like.\n",
