    "main_text": "Classical Descriptive Set Theory || Limitative Results\n2.4  Limitative Results\n\nIt proved difficult to extend the above results to higher\npointclasses, so much so that in 1925 Luzin said that \u201cone\nwill never know\u201d whether all of the projective sets of\nreals have the regularity properties. \n\n We now know the reason for the difficulties\u2014the early\nanalysts were working in ZFC and the above questions cannot be\nresolved on the basis of ZFC alone. It is a testament to the power of\nthe early analysts that they obtained the strongest results that were\nwithin the reach of their background assumptions. \n\n The independence of the above statements follows from the dual\ntechniques of inner model theory (invented by G\u00f6del in\n1938) and outer model theory (invented by Cohen in\n1963). \n\n The first half was established by G\u00f6del and Addison: \n\n Theorem 2.3 (G\u00f6del). Assume ZFC + V = L. Then there are \u03a3\u033012 sets that do not have the property of Baire and are not Lebesgue measurable and there are \u03a0\u033011 sets that do not have the perfect set property. \n\n\n Theorem 2.4 (Addison 1959). Assume ZFC + V = L. Then for all n \u2265 2,  Unif(\u03a3\u03301n).  \n\n\nIt follows that (assuming that ZFC is consistent), ZFC cannot prove\nthat \u03a3\u033012\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable,\nthat \u03a0\u033011\nsets have the perfect set property, and that\nUnif(\u03a3\u03301n)\nfails for n \u2265 2. It remained open whether ZFC could\nestablish the negations. \n\n The second half was established by Martin, Solovay and Levy: \n\n Theorem 2.5 (Solovay 1965). Assume  ZFC and that there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Then there is a forcing extension in which all projective sets have the perfect set property, the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n\nThe strongly inaccessible cardinal is necessary for the perfect set\nproperty (even\nfor \u03a0\u033011\nsets (Solovay)) and Lebesgue measurability (Shelah) but not for the\nproperty of Baire (Shelah). However, Martin and Solovay showed in 1970\nthat if ZFC is consistent then so is ZFC along with the statement that\nall \u03a312\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n Theorem 2.6 (Levy 1965). Assume ZFC. Then there is a forcing extension in which Unif(\u03a0\u033012) fails. \n\n\nIn fact, Levy noted that this is the case in the original model\nintroduced by Cohen. \n\n Putting everything together we have the following: (1) If ZFC is\nconsistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether\nall \u03a3\u033012\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. (2) If\nZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d is\nconsistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether\nall \u03a0\u033011\nsets have the perfect set property. (3) If ZFC is consistent, then ZFC\ncannot determine the pattern of the uniformization property; more\nprecisely, it is consistent with ZFC that the uniformization property\nhas either the pattern \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Uniformization under V = L. \n\n\nor the pattern \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Uniformization in the Cohen model.\n\n\nFurther Reading: For more on the history of classical\ndescriptive set theory see Kanamori (1995).
