    "main_text": "The Standard View\n1. The Standard View\n\n\nThe standard view among political theorists, such as Robert Audi,\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, Charles Larmore, Steven Macedo, Martha Nussbaum,\nand John Rawls is that religious reasons can play only a limited role\nin justifying coercive laws, as coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale lack moral\n legitimacy.[2]\nIf the standard view is correct, there is\nan important asymmetry between religious and secular reasons in the\nfollowing respect: some secular reasons can themselves justify state\ncoercion but no religious reason can. This asymmetry between the\njustificatory potential of religious and secular reasons, it is further\nclaimed, should shape the political practice of religious\nbelievers. According to advocates of the standard view, citizens\nshould not support coercive laws for which they believe there is no\nplausible secular rationale, although they may support coercive laws\nfor which they believe there is only a secular rationale. (Note \nthat not just any secular rationale counts.)  We can refer\nto this injunction to exercise restraint as The Doctrine of\nReligious Restraint (or the DRR, for\n short).[3]\nThis abstract\ncharacterization of the DRR will require some refinements, which we'll\nprovide in sections 2 and 3. For the time being, however, we can\nget a better feel for the character of the DRR by considering the\nfollowing case.\n",
