Joyce\n(2005) suggests that there is an important difference between\nthe weight of evidence and the balance of evidence. He argues that\nthis is a distinction that precise probabilists struggle to deal with\nand that the distinction is worth representing. This idea has been\nhinted at by a great many thinkers including J.M. Keynes, Rudolf\nCarnap, C.S. Pierce and Karl Popper (see\nreferences in Joyce 2005; G\u00e4rdenfors and Sahlin 1982). Here\u2019s\nKeynes\u2019 articulation of the intuition:\n\nAs the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude\nof the probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,\naccording as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the\nfavourable evidence; but something seems to have increased in\neither case,\u2014we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest\nour conclusion. I express this by saying than an accession of new\nevidence increases the weight of an\nargument. (Keynes 1921: 78, Keynes\u2019\nemphasis)\n\nConsider tossing a coin known to be fair. Let\u2019s say you have seen\nthe outcome of a hundred tosses and roughly half have come up\nheads. Your degree of belief that the coin will land heads should be\naround a half. This is a case where there is weight of evidence behind\nthe belief.\nNow consider another case: a coin of unknown bias is to be\ntossed. That is, you have not seen any data on previous tosses. In the\nabsence of any relevant information about the bias, symmetry concerns\nmight suggest you take the chance of heads to be around a half. This\nopinion is different from the above one. There is no weight\nof evidence, but there is nothing to suggest that your attitudes\nto \\(H\\) and \\(T\\)\nshould be different. So, on balance, you should have the same\nbelief in both.\nHowever, these two different cases get represented as having the\nsame probabilistic belief,\nnamely \\(p(H)=p(T)=0.5\\). In the fair coin\ncase, this probability assignment comes from having evidence that\nsuggests that the chance of heads is a half, and the prescription to\nhave your credences match chances (ceteris paribus). In the\nunknown bias case, by contrast, one arrives at the same assignment in\na different way: nothing in your evidence supports one proposition\nover the other so some \u201cprinciple of indifference\u201d\nreasoning suggests that they should be assigned the same\ncredence (see H\u00e1jek 2011, for discussion of the\nprinciple of indifference).\nIf we take seriously the \u201cambiguity aversion\u201d discussed\nearlier, when offered the choice between betting on the fair coin\u2019s\nlanding heads as opposed to the unknown-bias coin\u2019s landing heads, it\ndoesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to prefer the former. Recall the preference\nfor unambiguous gambles in the Ellsberg game\nin section 2.1. But if both coins have the same\nsubjective probabilities attached, what rationalises this preference\nfor betting on the fair coin? Joyce argues that there is a difference\nbetween these beliefs that is worth representing. IP does\nrepresent the difference. The first case is represented\nby \\(P(H)=\\{0.5\\}\\), while the second is\ncaptured by \\(P(H)=[0,1]\\).\nScott Sturgeon puts this point nicely when he says:\n\n[E]vidence and attitude aptly based on it must match in\ncharacter. When evidence is essentially sharp, it warrants sharp\nor exact attitude; when evidence is essentially fuzzy\u2014as it is\nmost of the time\u2014it warrants at best a fuzzy attitude. In a\nphrase: evidential precision begets attitudinal precision; and\nevidential imprecision begets attitudinal\nimprecision. (Sturgeon 2008: 159 Sturgeon\u2019s\nemphasis)\n\nWheeler (2014) criticises Sturgeon on\nthis \u201ccharacter matching\u201d thesis. However, an argument for\nIP based on the nature of evidence only requires that the character of\nthe evidence sometimes allows (or mandates?) imprecise belief and not\nthat the characters must always match. In\nopposition, Schoenfield (2012) argues\nthat evidence always supports precise credence, but that for reasons\nof limited computational capacity, real agents needn\u2019t be required to\nhave precise credences. However, her argument only really supports the\nclaim that sometimes indeterminacy is due to complexity of\nthe evidence and computational complexity. She doesn\u2019t have an\nargument against the claims Levi, Kaplan, Joyce and others make that\nthere are evidential situations that warrant imprecise attitudes.\nStrictly speaking, what we have here is only half the\nstory. There is a difference between the\nrepresentations of belief as regards weight and balance. But that\nstill leaves open the question of exactly what is representing the\nweight of evidence? What aspect of the belief reflects this\ndifference? One might be tempted to\nview \\(\\overline{P}(H)-\\underline{P}(H)\\) as a\nmeasure of the weight of evidence\nfor \\(H\\). Walley\n(1991) tentatively suggests as much. However, this would get\nwrong cases of conflicting evidence. (Imagine two equally reliable\nwitnesses: one tells you the coin is biased towards heads, the other\nsays the bias is towards tails.) The question of whether and\nhow IP does better than precise probabilism has not yet received an\nadequate answer. Researchers in IP have, however, made progress on\ndistinguishing cases where your beliefs happen to have certain\nsymmetry properties from cases where your beliefs capture evidence\nabout symmetries in the objects of belief. This is a\ndistinction that the standard precise model of belief fails to\ncapture (de Cooman and Miranda\n2007).\nThe precise probabilist can respond to the weight/balance\ndistinction argument by pointing to the property\nof resiliency (Skyrms 2011)\nor stability (Leitgeb\n2014). The idea is that probabilities determined by the weight\nof evidence change less in response to new evidence than do\nprobabilities determined by balance of evidence alone. That is, if\nyou\u2019ve seen a hundred tosses of the coin, seeing it land heads doesn\u2019t\naffect your belief much, while if you\u2019ve not seen any tosses of the\ncoin, seeing it land heads has a bigger effect on your beliefs. Thus,\nthe distinction is represented in the precise probabilistic framework\nin the conditional probabilities. The distinction, though, is one that\ncannot rationalise the preference for betting on the fair coin. One\ncould develop a resiliency-weighted expected value and claim that this\nis what you should maximise, but this would be as much of a departure\nfrom orthodox probabilism as IP is. If someone were to develop such a\ntheory, then its merits could be weighed against the merits of IP type\nmodels.\nAnother potential precise response would be to suggest that there\nis weight of evidence for \\(H\\) if many\npropositions that are evidence for \\(H\\) are\nfully believed, or if there is a chance proposition\n(about \\(H\\)) that is near to fully\nbelieved. This is in contrast to cases of mere balance where few\npropositions that are evidence for \\(H\\) are\nfully believed, or where probability is spread out over a number of\nchance hypotheses. The same comments made above about resiliency apply\nhere: such distinctions can be made, but this doesn\u2019t get us to a\ntheory that can rationalise ambiguity aversion.\nThe phenomenon of dilation (section 3.1)\nsuggests that the kind of argument put forward in this section needs\nmore care and further elaboration.\n",
