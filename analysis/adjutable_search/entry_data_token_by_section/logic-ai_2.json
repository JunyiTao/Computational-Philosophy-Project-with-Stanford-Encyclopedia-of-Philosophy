Nonmonotonic Reasoning and Nonmonotonic Logics\n3.1 Nonmonotonicity\n\n\nAristotle believed that most reasoning, including reasoning about\nwhat to do and about sublunary natural phenomena, dealt with things\nthat hold \u201calways or for the most part.\u201d But Aristotelian logic deals\nonly with patterns of inference that hold without exception. We find at\nthe very beginning of logic a discrepancy between the scope of logical\ntheory and common sense reasoning. Nonmonotonic logic is the first\nsustained attempt within logical theory to remedy this discrepancy. As\nsuch, it represents a potential for a sweeping expansion of the scope\nof logic, as well as a significant body of technical results.\n\n\nThe consequence relations of classical logics are monotonic. That\nis, if a set \u0393 of formulas implies a consequence C then\na larger set \u0393 \u222a A will also imply C. A\nlogic is nonmonotonic if its consequence relation lacks this\nproperty. Preferred models provide a general way to induce a\nnonmonotonic consequence relation. Invoke a function that for each\n\u0393 produces a subset\n M\u0393 of the models of \u0393; in general,\nwe will expect\n M\u0393 to\nbe a proper subset of these models. We then say that \u0393 implies\nC if C is satisfied by every model in\n M\u0393. As long as we do not\nsuppose that\n M\u0393\u222a{A} \u2286\n M\u0393, we can easily have an\nimplication relation between \u0393 and C without imposing\nthis relation on supersets of\n \u0393.[14]\n\n\nThis model theoretic behavior corresponds to expectation-guided\nreasoning, where the expectations allow certain cases to be neglected.\nHere is an important difference between common sense and mathematics.\nMathematicians are trained to reject a proof by cases unless the cases\nexhaust all the possibilities; but typical instances of common sense\nreasoning neglect some alternatives. In fact, it is reasonable to\nroutinely ignore improbable possibilities. Standing in a kitchen in\nCalifornia, wondering if there is time to wash the dishes before leaving\nfor work, one might not take the possibility of an earthquake into\naccount.\n\n\nThere seem to be many legitimate reasons for neglecting certain\ncases in common sense reasoning. A qualitative judgment that the\nprobability of a case is negligible is one reason. But, for instance,\nin a planning context it may be reasonable to ignore even nonnegligible\nprobabilities, as long as there is no practical point in planning on\nthese cases.\n\n\nThe motivations for nonmonotonicity seem to involve a number of\ncomplex factors; probability (perhaps in some qualitative sense),\nnormality, expectations that are reasonable in the sense that one can\u2019t\nbe reasonably blamed for having them, mutual acceptance, and factors\nhaving to do with limited rationality.  It may well be that no one has\nsucceeded in disentangling and clarifying these motivating\nconsiderations. In the early stages of its emergence in logical AI,\nmany researchers seem to have thought of nonmonotonic reasoning as a\ngeneral method for reasoning about uncertainty; but by the end of the\n1980s, implementations of fully quantitative probabilistic reasoning\nwere not only possible in principle, but were clearly preferable in\nmany sorts of applications to methods involving nonmonotonic logic. A\nplausible and realistic rationale for nonmonotonic logic has to fit it\ninto a broader picture of reasoning about uncertainty that also\nincludes probabilistic\n reasoning.[15]\n3.2 Historical Motivations\n\n\nThree influential papers on nonmonotonic logic appeared in 1980:\n McDermott & Doyle 1980,\n Reiter 1980,\n and\n McCarthy 1980.\n In each case, the\nformalisms presented in these papers were the result of a gestation\nperiod of several years or more. To set out the historical influences\naccurately, it would be necessary to interview the authors, and this \nhas not been done. However, there seem to have been two motivating factors:\nstrategic considerations having to do with the long-range goals of AI,\nand much more specific, tactical considerations arising from the\nanalysis of the reasoning systems that were being deployed in the\n1970s.\n\nSection 2.2\n drew attention to McCarthy\u2019s\nproposed goal of formalizing common sense reasoning. The brief\ndiscussion above in\n Section 3.1\n suggests that\nmonotonicity may be an obstacle in pursuing this goal. An additional\nmotive was found in\n Minsky 1974,\n which was\nwidely read at the time. This paper presents an assortment of\nchallenges for AI, focusing at the outset on the problem of natural\nlanguage\n understanding.[16]\n Minsky advocates frame-based\nknowledge representation\n techniques[17]\n and (conceiving of the use of these\nrepresentations as an alternative to logic), he throws out a number of\nloosely connected challenges for the logical approach, including the\nproblem of building large-scale representations, of reasoning\nefficiently, of representing control knowledge, and of providing for\nthe flexible revision of defeasible beliefs. In retrospect, \nmost AI researchers would tend to agree that these problems are general\nchallenges to any research program in AI (including the one Minsky\nhimself advocated at the time) and that logical techniques are an\nimportant element in addressing some, perhaps all, of the issues. (For\ninstance, a well structured logical design can be a great help in\nscaling up knowledge representation.)\n\n\nMinsky apparently intended to provide general arguments against\nlogical methods in AI, but\n McDermott & Doyle 1980\n and\n McCarthy 1980\n interpret\n Minsky 1974\n as a challenge that can be met by\ndeveloping logics that lack the monotonicity property. Perhaps\nunintentionally, the paper seems to have provided some incentive\nto the nonmonotonic logicians by stressing monotonicity as a source of\nthe alleged shortcomings of logic. In fact, the term\n\u2018monotonicity\u2019 apparently makes its first appearance in\nprint in Minsky\u2019s 1974 paper.\n\n\nThe development of nonmonotonic logic also owes a great deal to the\napplied side of AI. In fact, the need for a nonmonotonic analysis of a\nnumber of AI applications was as persuasive as the strategic\nconsiderations urged by McCarthy, and in many ways more influential on\nthe shape of the formalisms that emerged. Here, we mention three\nsuch applications that appear to have been important for some of the\nearly nonmonotonic logicians: belief revision, closed-world reasoning,\nand planning.\n3.2.1 Belief Revision\nDoyle 1979\nprovides an analysis and algorithm for a \u201ctruth maintenance\nsystem\u201d. The TMS answers a general need, providing a mechanism\nfor updating the \u201cbeliefs\u201d of knowledge bases. The idea of\nthe TMS is to keep track of the support of beliefs, and to use the\nrecord of these support dependencies when it is necessary to revise\nbeliefs.\n\n\n\nIn a TMS, part of the support for a belief can consist in the\nabsence of some other belief. This introduces nonmonotonicity.\nFor instance, it provides for defaults; that Wednesday is the default\nday for scheduling a meeting means the belief that the meeting will be\non Wednesday depends on the absence of special-case beliefs\nentailing that it will not be on Wednesday.\n\n\nThe TMS algorithm and its refinements had a significant impact on AI\napplications, and this created the need for a logical analysis. (In\neven fairly simple cases, it can be hard in the absence of analytic\ntools to see what consequences a TMS should deliver.) This provided a\nnatural and highly specific challenge for those seeking to develop a\nnonmonotonic logic. The TMS also provided specific intuitions: the idea\nthat the key to nonmonotonicity has to do with inferences based on\nunprovability was important for the modal approaches to nonmonotonic\nlogic and for default logic. And the TMS\u2019s emphasis on interactions\nbetween arguments began a theme in nonmonotonic logic that remains\nimportant to this day. (See the discussion of argument-based\napproaches, in\n Section 3.4,\n below.)\n3.2.2 Closed-world reasoning\n\n\nThe study of databases belongs to computer science, not specifically to\nAI. But one of the research paradigms in the scientific analysis of\ndatabases uses logical models of the representations and reasoning\n (see\n Minker 1997\n for a recent survey of the\nfield), and this area has interacted with logical AI. The deductive\ndatabase paradigm was taking shape at about the same time that many AI\nresearchers were thinking through the problems of nonmonotonic logic,\nand provided several specific examples of nonmonotonic reasoning that\ncalled for analyses. Of these, perhaps the most important is the\nclosed-world assumption, according to which\u2014at least as\nfar as simple facts are concerned, represented in the database as\npositive or negative literals\u2014the system assumes that it knows\nall that there is to be known. It is the closed world assumption that\njustifies a negative answer to a query \u201cIs there a direct flight\nfrom Detroit to Bologna?\u201d when the system finds no such flight in\nits data. This is another case of inference from the absence of a\nproof; a negative is proved, in effect, by the failure of a systematic\nattempt to prove the positive. This idea, which was investigated in\npapers such as\n Reiter 1978\n and\n Clark 1978\n also provided a challenge for\nnonmonotonic logics, as well as specific intuitions\u2014note that\nagain, the idea of inference rules depending on the absence of a proof\nis present here. \n3.2.3 Planning\n\n\nRational planning is impossible without the ability to reason about\nthe outcomes of a series of contemplated actions. Predictive reasoning\nof this sort is local; in a complex world with many features, we\nassume that most things will be unchanged by the performance of an\naction. But this locality has proved to be difficult to formalize. The\nproblem of how to formalize this \u201ccausal\ninertia\u201d[18] is known as the Frame\nProblem. \n\n\nIt is very natural to suppose that inertia holds by default;\nvariables are unchanged by the performance of an action unless there is\na special reason to think that they will change. This suggests that\nnonmonotonic temporal formalisms should provide an appropriate\nfoundation for reasoning about action and change. So attempts to\nformalize the reasoning needed in planning also created a need for\nnonmonotonic logics. One of the earliest attempts to formalize\nnonmonotonic reasoning,\n Sandewall 1972,\naddresses the frame problem. Inertial defaults are an especially\nimportant and instructive case study; no more will be said about them\nhere, since they are discussed in detail in\n Section 4.4,\n below.\n3.3 The Earliest Formalisms\n\n\nThe three 1980 papers mentioned at the beginning of\n Section 3.2\n represent three approaches to\nnonmonotonic logic that remain important subfields to this day:\ncircumscription (McCarthy), modal approaches (Doyle\n& McDermott) and default logic (Reiter).\n\n\nIn\n McCarthy 1993a,\n McCarthy urges\nus, when considering the early history of circumscription, to take into\naccount a group of three papers: McCarthy\n 1986,\n 1980,\n and\n 1987.\n The first paper connects the\nstrategic ideas of\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969\n with the need for a nonmonotonic logic, and\nsketches the logical ideas of domain circumscription, which is\nnow classified as the simplest case of circumscription. The second\npaper provides more thorough logical foundations, and introduces the\nmore general and powerful predicate circumscription approach.\nThe third paper concentrates on developing techniques for formalizing\nchallenging common sense examples.\n\n\nAll forms of circumscription involve restricting attention to models\nin which certain sets are minimized; for this reason, circumscription\ncan be grouped with the preferred models approaches to nonmonotonicity:\nsee\n Section 3.4,\n below. McCarthy\u2019s\nformalism is fairly conservative; though it raises interesting logical\nissues in higher-order logic and complexity, it uses familiar logical\nframeworks. And much of the focus is on the development of\nformalization techniques. The other varieties of nonmonotonic logic,\nincluding default logic and the modal nonmonotonic logics, raise issues\nof the sort that are familiar to philosophical logicians, having to do\nwith the design of new logics, the systematic investigation of\nquestions concerning validity, and managing the proliferation of\nalternative logics.\n\n\nAs the discussion above of truth maintenance indicated, it is very\nnatural to think of nonmonotonic inferences as being hedged.\nThat is, a nonmonotonic inference may require not merely the presence\nof a set of proved conclusions, but the absence of certain\nother conclusions. The general form of such a rule is:\nDR:\n\n In the presence of\n{A1,\u2026,An} and in the\nabsence of {B1,\u2026,Bn},\nconclude C.\n\n\nAn important special case of DR is a normal\ndefault, a simple rule to the effect that C holds by\ndefault, conditionally on assumptions\nA1,\u2026,An. This can be\nformalized by taking the condition that must be absent to simply be the\nnegation of the conclusion.\nNDR:\n\n In the presence of\n{A1,\u2026,An} and in the\nabsence of \u00acC, conclude C.\n\n\nAt first sight, it is somewhat perplexing how to formalize this\nnotion of nonmonotonic inference, since it seems to require a circular\ndefinition of provability that can\u2019t be replaced with an inductive\ndefinition, as in the nonmonotonic case. The difficulty with the early\ntheory of\n Sandewall 1972\n is that it does\nnot address this difficulty successfully.\n McDermott & Doyle 1980\n and\n Reiter 1980\n use fixpoint definitions to\nsolve the problem. In both cases, the logical task is (1) to develop a\nformalism in which rules like DR can be expressed, and\n(2) to define the relation between a theory DT (which may\nincorporate such rules) and the theories E which could count\nas reasonable consequences of DT. In the terminology that\nlater became standard, we need to define the relation between a theory\nDT and its extensions.\n\n\nIn retrospect, we can identify two sorts of approaches to\nnonmonotonic logic: those based on preference and those based\non conflict. Theories of the first sort (like circumscription)\ninvolve a relatively straightforward modification of the ordinary\nmodel-theoretic definition of logical consequence that takes into\naccount a preference relation over models. Theories of the second sort\n(like default logic) involve a more radical rethinking of logical\nideas. The possibility of multiple extensions\u2014different possible\ncoherent, inferentially complete conclusion sets that can be drawn from\na single set of premises\u2014means that we have to think of logical\nconsequence not as a function taking a set of axioms into its logical\nclosure, but as a relation between a set of axioms and\nalternative logical closures. Since logical consequence is so\nfundamental, this represents a major theoretical departure. With\nmultiple extensions, we can still retrieve a consequence relation\nbetween a theory and a formula in various ways, the simplest being to\nsay that DT nonmonotonically implies C if C\nis a member of every extension of DT. Still, the\nconflict-based account of consequence provides a much richer underlying\nstructure than the preferential one.\n\n\nReiter approaches the formalization problem conservatively.\nNonmonotonicity is not expressed in the language of default logic,\nwhich is the same as the language of first-order logic. But a theory\nmay involve a set of default rules\u2014rules of the form\nDR.\n Reiter 1980\nprovides a fixpoint definition of the extensions of such a theory, and\ndevelops the theoretical groundwork for the approach, proving a number\nof the basic theorems.\n\n\nOf these theorems, we mention one in particular, which will be used\nin\n Section 4.5,\n in connection with the Yale\nShooting Anomaly. The idea is to take a conjectured extension (which\nwill be a set T*) and to use this set for consistency checks\nin a proof-like process that successively applies default rules in\n<W,D> to stages that begin with\nW.\n\n\nWe define a default proof process\nT0,T1,\u2026 for W,\nD, relative to T*, as follows.\n\nLet T0 = W.\nIf no default rule in D is nonvacuously applicable to\nTi relative to T*, then\nTi+1 =\nThFOL(Ti), where\nThFOL(T) is the logical closure in\nFOL of T.\nOtherwise, choose some default rule \n\n\n\n\nA\u00a0 : \u00a0B1,\u2026, Bn\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\nthat is nonvacuously applicable to Ti\nrelative to T*, and let \nTi+1 =\nThFOL(Ti\u222a{\nC}).\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, as long as we can nonvacuously close the stage we are\nworking on under an applicable default, we do so; otherwise, we do\nnothing. A theorem of Reiter\u2019s says that, under these circumstances: \nT is an extension of <W,\nD> if and only if there is a proof process\nT0, T1,... for W,\nD, relative to T, such that \n\n\n\n\nT =\n\n\u222a\n0\u2264 i\n\nTi .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we can show that T is an extension by (1) using\nT for consistency checks in a default reasoning process from\n<W, D>, (2) taking the limit T\u2032\nof this process, and (3) verifying that in fact T\u2032 =\nT. \n\n\nThe modal approach represents a \u201chigher level of nonmonotonic\ninvolvement\u201d than default logic. The unprovability construct is\nrepresented explicitly in the language, by means of a modal operator\nL informally interpreted as \u2018provable\u2019 (or, as\n in\n McDermott & Doyle 1980,\n by\nthe dual of this operator).[19]\n Although McDermott and Doyle\u2019s\nterminology is different from Reiter\u2019s, the logical ideas are very\nsimilar\u2014the essence of their approach, like Reiter\u2019s, is a\nfixpoint definition of the extensions of a nonmonotonic logic.\nIncorporating nonmonoticity in the object language creates some\nadditional complexities, which in the early modal approach show up\nmainly in proliferation of the logics and difficulties in evaluating\nthe merits of the alternatives. As better foundations for the modal\napproach emerged, it became possible to prove the expected theorems\nconcerning equivalence of modal formalisms with default\n logic.[20]\n\n\nReiter\u2019s paper\n Reiter 1980\n appears to\nhave developed primarily out of tactical considerations. The earlier\npaper\n Reiter 1978\n is largely concerned\nwith providing an account of database queries. Unlike the other seminal\npapers in nonmonotonic logic, Reiter\u2019s shows specific influence from\nthe earlier and independent work on nonmonotonicity in logic\nprogramming\u2014the work seems to have been largely inspired by the\nneed to provide logical foundations for the nonmonotonic reasoning\nfound in deductive databases. Doyle and McDermott\u2019s paper shows both\nstrategic and tactical motivation\u2014citing the earlier literature\nin logicist AI, it motivates nonmonotonic logic as part of a program of\nmodeling common sense rationality. But the theory is also clearly\ninfluenced by the need to provide a formal account of truth\nmaintenance.\n3.4 Approaches to Nonmonotonic Logic\n\n\nNonmonotonic logic is a complex, robust research field. Providing a\nsurvey of the subject is made difficult by the fact that there are many\ndifferent foundational paradigms for formalizing nonmonotonic\nreasoning, and the relations between these paradigms is not simple. An\nadequate account of even a significant part of the field requires a\nsomething like a book-length treatment. A number of books are\navailable, including\n \u0141ukaszewicz 1990,\n Brewka 1991,\n Besnard 1992,\n Marek & Truszczynski 1994,\n Antoniou 1997,\n Brewka et al. 1997,\n Schlechta 1997,\n Antonelli 2005,\n Makinson 2005b,\n and\n Horty 2012.\n Two\ncollections are especially useful:\n Ginsberg 1987\n and\n Gabbay et al. 1994.\n The former is a useful source for readers interested in the\nearly history of the subject, and has an excellent introduction. The\nhandbook chapters in\n Gabbay et al. 1994\n provide overviews of important topics and approaches.\nMy current recommendation for readers interested in a quick, readable\nintroduction to the topic would be\n Brewka et al. 1997\n and self-selected chapters of\n Gabbay et al. 1994.\nSome other sources include \nBochman 2004,\nMakinson 2005,\nAntoniou and Wang 2007,\nBochman 2007,\n and\nSchlechta 2007.\nWe rely\non these references for technical background, and will concentrate on\nintellectual motivation, basic ideas, and potential long-term\nsignifgicance for logic.\n3.4.1 Preference Semantics\n\n\nAt the outset in\n Section 3.1,\n it was mentioned how\npreferred models could be used to characterize a nonmonotonic\nconsequence relation. This general model theory of nonmonotonicity\nemerged in\n Shoham 1988,\n five years after\nthe work discussed in\n Section 3.2,\n and\nrepresents a much more general and abstract approach. \n\n\nPreferential semantics relies on a function S taking a set\nK of models into a subset S(K) of\nK. The crucial definition of preferential entailment\nstipulates that A is a (nonmonotonic) consequence of \u0393\nif every model M of S(Models(\u0393))\nimplies A. Shoham\u2019s theory is based on a partial order\n\u227c over models: S(K) can then be characterized\nas the set of models in K that are \u227c-minimal\nin K. To ensure that no set can preferentially entail a\ncontradiction unless it classically entails a contradiction, infinite\ndescending \u227c chains need to be disallowed.\n\n\nThis treatment of nonmonotonicity is similar to the earlier modal\nsemantic theories of conditionals\u2014the similarities are\nparticularly evident using the more general theories of conditional\nsemantics, such as the one presented in\n Chellas 1975.\n Of course, the consequence\nrelation of the classical conditional logics is monotonic, and\nconditional semantics uses possible worlds, not models. But the\nleft-nonmonotonicity of conditionals (the fact that A\n C does not imply\n[A\n \u2227\n B]\n \nC) creates issues that\nparallel those in nonmonotonic logics. Early work in nonmonotonic logic\ndoes not seem to be aware of the analogy with conditional logic. But\nthe interrelations between the two have become an important theme more\nrecently; see, for instance,\n G\u00e4rdenfors & Makinson 1994,\n Boutilier 1992,\n Pearl 1994,\n Gabbay 1995,\n Benferat et al. 1997,\n Delgrande 1998,\n Arlo-Costa & Shapiro 1992,\n Alcourr\u00f3n 1995,\n Asher 1995,\n and\n Thomason 2007.\n\n\nPreference semantics raises an opportunity for formulating and\nproving representation theorems relating conditions over preference\nrelations to properties of the abstract consequence relation. This line\nof investigation began with\n Lehmann & Magidor 1992.\n3.4.2 Modal and epistemic theories\n\n\nNeither Doyle or McDermott pursued the modal approach much beyond\nthe initial stages of\n McDermott 1982,\nand\n McDermott & Doyle 1980.\n With a helpful suggestion from Robert Stalnaker (see\n Stalnaker 1993),\n however, Robert C. Moore\nproduced a modal theory that improves in many ways on the earlier\nideas. Moore gives the modal operator of his system an epistemic\ninterpretation, based on the conception of a default rule as one that\nlicenses a conclusion for a reasoning agent unless something that the\nagent knows blocks the conclusion. In Moore\u2019s autoepistemic\nlogic, an extension E of a theory T is a\nsuperset of T that is stable, i.e., that is\ndeductively closed, and that satisfies the following two rules:\n\nIf A\u2208E then\n \u25a1A\u2208E.\nIf A\u2209E then\n \u00ac\u25a1A\u2208E.\n\n\n\nIt is also usual to impose a groundedness condition on\nautoepistemic extensions of T, ensuring that every member of\nan extension has some reason tracing back to T. Various such\nconditions have been considered; the simplest one restricts extensions\nto those satisfying \n\nE is the set of nonmodal consequences of\nT\u222a{A :\n \u25a1A\u2208E} \u222a\n {\u00ac\u25a1A : A\u2209E}.\n\n\n\nAutoepistemic logic remains a popular approach to nonmonotonic logic,\nin part because of its usefulness in providing theoretical foundations\nfor logic programming. For more recent references, see\n Marek & Truszczynski 1991,\n Moore 1995b,\n Marek & Truszczynski 1989,\n Konolige 1994,\n Antoniou 1997,\n Moore 1993,\n and\n Deneker et al. 2003.\n\n\nEpistemic logic has inspired other approaches to nonmonotonic logic.\nLike other modal theories of nonmonotonicity, these use modality to\nreflect consistency in the object language, and so allow default rules\nalong the lines of DR to be expressed. But instead of\nconsistency, these use ignorance. See\n Halpern & Moses 1985\n and\n Levesque 1987\n for variations on this idea.\nThese theories are explained, and compared to other nonmonotonic\nlogics, in\n Meyer & van der Hoek 1995.\n In more recent work, Levesque\u2019s ideas are systematically\npresented and applied to the theory of knowledge bases in\n Levesque & Lakemeyer 2000.\n3.5 Further Topics\n\n\nThis brief historical introduction to nonmonotonic logic leaves\nuntouched a number of general topics that might well be of\ninterest to a nonspecialist. These include graph-based and\nproof-theoretic approaches to nonmonotonic logic, results that\ninterrelate the various formalisms, complexity results, tractable\nspecial cases of nonmonotonic reasoning, relations between nonmonotonic\nand abductive reasoning, relations to probability logics, the logical\nintuitions and apparent patterns of validity underlying nonmonotonic\nlogics, and the techniques used to formalize domains using nonmonotonic\nlogics. For these and other topics, the reader is referred to the\nliterature. As a start, the chapters in\n Gabbay et al. 1994\n are highly\nrecommended.\n",
