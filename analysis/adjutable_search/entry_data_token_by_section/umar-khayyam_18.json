    "main_text": "Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist || The Parallel Postulate and the Theory of Ratios\n4.2 The Parallel Postulate and the Theory of Ratios\nThe process of reasoning from postulates and definitions has been basic to mathematics at least since the time of Euclid. Islamic geometers were well versed in this art, but also spent some effort examining the logical foundations of the method. They were unafraid to revise and improve upon Euclid\u2019s starting points, and they rebuilt Euclid\u2019s Elements from the foundation in several ways. Khayyam\u2019s \u201cCommentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates of Euclid\u2019s Work\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d\u200b[14] deals with the two most important issues in this context, the parallel postulate and the definition of equality of ratios.\nEuclid\u2019s fifth \u201cparallel\u201d postulate states that if a line falls on two given lines such that the two interior angles add up to less than two right angles, then the given lines must meet on that side. This statement is logically equivalent to several more easily understood assertions, such as: there is exactly one parallel to a given line that passes through a given point not on the given line; or, the angles of a triangle sum to two right angles. It has been known since the early 19th century that non-Euclidean geometries violate these properties; indeed, it is not yet known whether the space in which we live satisfies them.\nThe parallel postulate, however, was not subject to doubt at Khayyam\u2019s time, so it is more appropriate to think of Islamic efforts in this area as part of the tradition of improving upon Euclid rather than as the origin of non-Euclidean geometry. Khayyam\u2019s reconstruction of Euclid is one of the better ones: he does not try to prove the parallel postulate. Rather, he replaces it with two statements, which he attributes to Aristotle,[15] that are both simpler and more self-evident: two lines that converge must intersect, and two lines that converge can never diverge in the direction of convergence. Khayyam then replaces Euclid\u2019s 29th proposition, the first in which the parallel postulate is used, with a new sequence of eight propositions. Khayyam\u2019s insertion amounts to determining that the so-called Saccheri quadrilateral (one with two equal sides perpendicular to the base) is in fact a rectangle. As Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri published this quadrilateral in his book Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus in 1733, it is also known as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral. Khayyam believed his approach was an improvement on that of his predecessor Ibn al-Haytham (ca. 965\u20131040) because his method does not rely on the concept of motion, which Khayyam said should be excluded from geometry. Apparently Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b agreed, since he followed Khayyam\u2019s path in the next century (Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 186).\nBook II of \u201cCommentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates of Euclid\u2019s Work\u201d takes up the question of the proper definition of ratio. This topic is obscure to the modern reader, but it was fundamental to Greek and medieval mathematics. If the quantities joined in a ratio are whole numbers, then the definition of their ratio poses no difficulty. If the quantities are geometric magnitudes, the situation is more complicated because the two line segments might be incommensurable (in modern terms, their ratio corresponds to an irrational number). Euclid, following Eudoxus, asserts that \\(A/B = C/D\\) when, for any magnitudes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the magnitudes \\(xA\\) and \\(xC\\) are both (i) greater than, (ii) equal to, or (iii) less than the magnitudes \\(yB\\) and \\(yD\\) respectively. There is little wonder that Khayyam and others were unhappy with this definition, for while it is clearly true, it does not get at the heart of what it means for ratios to be equal.\nAn alternate approach, which may have existed in ancient Greece but certainly existed in the 9th century, is the \u201canthyphairetic\u201d definition (Hogendijk 2002). The Euclidean algorithm is an iterative process that is used to find the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers. The algorithm may be applied equally well to find the greatest common measure of two geometric magnitudes, but the algorithm will never terminate if the ratio between the two magnitudes is irrational. A sequence of divisions within the algorithm results in a \u201ccontinued fraction\u201d that corresponds to the ratio between the original two quantities. Khayyam, following several earlier Islamic mathematicians, defines the equality of \\(A/B\\) and \\(C/D\\) according to whether their continued fractions are equal.\nOne may wonder why the proponents of the anthyphairetic definition felt that it was more natural than Euclid\u2019s approach. There is no doubt, however, that it was preferred; Khayyam even refers to the anthyphairetic definition as the \u201ctrue\u201d nature of proportionality. Part of the explanation might be simply that the Euclidean algorithm applied to geometric quantities was much more familiar to medieval mathematicians than to us. Khayyam\u2019s preference is due to the fact that the anthyphairetic definition allows a ratio to be considered on its own, rather than always in equality to some other ratio. Khayyam\u2019s achievement in this topic was not to invent a new definition, but rather to demonstrate that each of the existing definitions logically implies the other. Thus Islamic mathematicians could continue to use ratio theorems from the Elements without having to prove them again according to the anthyphairetic definition.\nBook III continues the discussion of ratios; Khayyam sets himself the task of demonstrating the seemingly innocuous proposition \\(A/C = (A/B) (B/C)\\), a fact which is used in the Elements but never proved. During this process Khayyam sets an arbitrary fixed magnitude to serve as a unit, to which he relates all other magnitudes of the same kind. This arrangement allows Khayyam to incorporate both numbers and geometric magnitudes within the same system. Thus Khayyam thinks of irrational magnitudes as numbers themselves, which effectively defines the set of \u201creal numbers\u201d that we take for granted today which is composed of rational numbers together with irrational numbers. This revolutionary step to consider irrational numbers as mathematical entities in their own right was one of the most significant advances of conception to occur between ancient Greek and modern mathematics (Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973, 327).\n",
