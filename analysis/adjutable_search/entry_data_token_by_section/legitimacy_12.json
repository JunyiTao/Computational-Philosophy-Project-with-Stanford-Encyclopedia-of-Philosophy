    "main_text": "Political Legitimacy and Democracy || Alternative Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n4.3 Alternative Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n\nSome conceptions of democratic legitimacy seek to reconcile\ninstrumentalist and non-instrumentalist considerations. What we may\ncall rational proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy add\nconditions that refer to the quality of outcomes to those that apply\nto the procedural properties of democratic decision-making.\n\nAs is the case with pure proceduralist conceptions, rational\nproceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy also vary with the\nunderlying account of democracy. A version of rational proceduralism\nis implicit in Arrow\u2019s approach to aggregative democracy (Arrow\n1963; see Peter 2008 for a discussion). The problem he poses is: are\nthere methods of democratic decision-making that are based on equal\nconsideration of individual interests and are conducive to rational\nsocial choice? As is well known, his impossibility theorem shows a\nproblem with finding such decision-making mechanisms. Arrow\u2019s\nway of posing the problem\u2014which contrasts with May\u2019s\n(1952)\u2014suggests that the possible irrationality of majority rule\nundermines its legitimacy, even if it respects certain procedural\nvalues. His view implies that democratic legitimacy only obtains if\nthe outcomes themselves satisfy certain quality\nconditions\u2014specifically, he postulated that they should satisfy\ncertain rationality axioms.\n\nThe default conception of democratic legitimacy that many deliberative\ndemocrats favor is also a version of rational proceduralism.\nHabermas\u2019 conception of democratic legitimacy is an example.\nDrawing on discourse ethics, Habermas (1990; 1996) argues that\npeople\u2019s participation in the justificatory processes of\ndeliberative democracy is necessary for political legitimacy.\nAccording to him, \u201cthe procedures and communicative\npresuppositions of democratic opinion- and will-formation function as\nthe most important sluices for the discursive rationalization of the\ndecisions of an administration bound by law and statute\u201d (1996:\n300). The legitimacy of democratic decisions, then, depends on both\nprocedural values and on the substantive quality of the outcomes that\nthese deliberative decision-making procedures generate. As Habermas\nputs it: \u201cDeliberative politics acquires its legitimating force\nfrom the discursive structure of an opinion- and will-formation that\ncan fulfill its socially integrative function only because citizens\nexpect its results to have a reasonable quality\u201d\n(Habermas 1996: 304; see also Benhabib 1994; Knight and Johnson 1994;\nCohen 1997a,b; Bohman 1997). In his view, only deliberative democratic\ndecision-making can produce a decision everyone has reasons to\nendorse.\n\nEstlund objects to both pure proceduralist and the versions of\nrational proceduralism just discussed that they unduly neglect\nepistemic considerations. But he also objects to epistemic\ninstrumentalist accounts that they fail to give a sufficient\nexplanation for why those who disagree with the outcome of the\ndemocratic decision-making process ought to treat it as binding. To\ncorrect for that, Estlund\u2019s alternative conception of democratic\nlegitimacy puts more emphasis on procedures while still giving weight\nto epistemic considerations. The conception of legitimacy that he\nadvocates \u201crequires that the procedure can be held, in terms\nacceptable to all qualified points of view, to be epistemically the\nbest (or close to it) among those that are better than random\u201d\n(Estlund 2008: 98). By privileging what he calls the \u201cqualified\nacceptability requirement\u201d (2008: 40ff) over epistemic\nconsiderations, Estlund avoids the worry about political deference\nthat drives Lafont\u2019s (2019) rejection of epistemic theories of\ndemocratic legitimacy.\n\nAs we saw, worries about political deference are an important source\nfor scepticism about both epistocratic and epistemic democracy\ntheories of legitimacy (see also van Wietmarschen 2019, Lillehammer\n2021, and Brinkmann 2022 on political deference). Peter (2023), by\ncontrast, argues that these principled worries about political\ndeference are overstated and that legitimate political decision-making\nmay be compatible with a requirement to politically defer, even in a\nsystem that is overall democratic.\n",
