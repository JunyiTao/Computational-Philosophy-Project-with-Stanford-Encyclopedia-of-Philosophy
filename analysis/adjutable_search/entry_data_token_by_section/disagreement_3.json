    "main_text": "Disagreement with Superiors, Inferiors, Peers, and Unknowns\n4. Disagreement with Superiors, Inferiors, Peers, and Unknowns\n\n\nA child has belief \\(B\\) that Hell is a real place located in the\ncenter of the earth. You disagree. This is a case in which you\ndisagree with someone who you recognize to be your epistemic\ninferior on the question of whether \\(B\\) is true. You believe\nthat Babe Ruth was the greatest baseball player ever. Then you find\nout that a sportswriter who has written several books on the history\nof baseball disagrees, saying that so-and-so was the greatest ever. In\nthis case, you realize that you\u2019re disagreeing with\nan epistemic superior on the matter, since you know that\nyou\u2019re just an amateur when it comes to baseball. In a third\ncase, you disagree with your sister regarding the name of the town\nyour family visited on vacation when you were children. You know from\nlong experience that your memory is about as reliable as hers on\nmatters like this one; this is a disagreement with a\nrecognized epistemic peer.\n\n\nThere are several ways to define the terms \u2018superior\u2019,\n\u2018inferior\u2019, and \u2018peer\u2019 (Elga, 2007; see section 5 below).\n\n\nYou can make judgments about how likely someone is compared to you\nwhen it comes to answering \u2018Is belief \\(B\\) true?\u2019\ncorrectly.  If you think she is more likely (e.g., you suppose that\nthe odds that she will answer it correctly are about 90% whereas your\nodds are just around 80%), then you think she is your likelihood\nsuperior on that question; if you think she is less likely, then\nyou think she is your likelihood inferior on that question;\nif you think she is about equally likely, then you think she is\nyour likelihood peer on that question. Another way to\ndescribe these distinctions is by referencing the epistemic position\nof the various parties.  One\u2019s epistemic position describes how\nwell-placed they are, epistemically speaking, with respect to a given\nproposition. The better one\u2019s epistemic position, the more\nlikely one is to be correct.\n\n\nThere are many factors that help determine one\u2019s epistemic\nposition, or how likely one is to answer \u2018Is belief \\(B\\)\ntrue?\u2019 correctly. Here are the main ones (Frances 2014):\n\ncognitive ability had while answering the question\nevidence brought to bear in answering the question\nrelevant background knowledge\ntime devoted to answering the question\ndistractions encountered in answering the question\nrelevant biases\nattentiveness when answering the question\nintellectual virtues possessed\n\n\n\nCall these Disagreement Factors. Presumably, what determines\nthat \\(X\\) is more likely than \\(Y\\) to answer \u2018Is \\(B\\)\ntrue?\u2019 correctly are the differences in the Disagreement Factors\nfor \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\n\nFor any given case of disagreement between just two people, the odds\nare that they will not be equivalent on all Disagreement Factors:\n\\(X\\) will surpass \\(Y\\) on some factors and \\(Y\\) will surpass \\(X\\)\non other factors.  If you are convinced that a certain person is\nclearly lacking compared to you on many Disagreement Factors when it\ncomes to answering the question \u2018Is \\(B\\) true?\u2019 then\nyou\u2019ll probably say that you are more likely than she is to\nanswer the question correctly provided you are not lacking compared to\nher on other Disagreement Factors. If you are convinced that a certain\nperson definitely surpasses you on many Disagreement Factors when it\ncomes to answering \u2018Is \\(B\\) true?\u2019 then you\u2019ll\nprobably say that you are less likely than she is to answer the\nquestion correctly provided you have no advantage over her when it\ncomes to answering \u2018Is \\(B\\) true?\u2019. If you think the two\nof you differ in Disagreement Factors but the differences do not add\nup to one person having a net advantage (so you think any differences\ncancel out), then you\u2019ll think you are peers on that\nquestion.\n\n\nNotice that in this peer case you need not think that the two of you\nare equal on each Disagreement Factor. On occasion, a philosopher will\ndefine \u2018epistemic peer\u2019 so that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are peers\non belief \\(B\\) if and only if they are equal on all\nDisagreement Factors.  If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are equal on all\nDisagreement Factors, then they will be equally likely to judge \\(B\\)\ncorrectly, but the reverse does not hold.  Deficiencies of a peer in\none area may be accounted for by advantages in other areas with the\nfinal result being that the two individuals are in an equivalently\ngood epistemic position despite the existence of some inequalities\nregarding particular disagreement factors.\n\n\nIn order to understand the alternative definitions of\n\u2018superior\u2019, \u2018inferior\u2019, and\n\u2018peer\u2019, we will look at two cases of disagreement (Frances\n2014).\n\n\nSuppose I believe \\(B\\), that global warming is happening. Suppose I\nalso believe \\(P\\), that Taylor is my peer regarding \\(B\\) in this\nsense: I think we are equally likely to judge \\(B\\) correctly. I have\nthis opinion of Taylor because I figure that she knows about as well\nas I do the basic facts about expert consensus, she understands and\nrespects that consensus about as much as I do, and she based her\nopinion of \\(B\\) on those facts. (I know she has some opinion on \\(B\\)\nbut I have yet to actually hear her voice it.) Thus, I think she is\nmy likelihood peer on \\(B\\).\n\n\nBut in another sense I don\u2019t think she is my peer on\n\\(B\\). After all, if someone asked me \u2018Suppose you find out\nlater today that Taylor sincerely thinks \\(B\\) is false. What do you\nthink are the odds that you\u2019ll be right and she\u2019ll be\nwrong about \\(B\\)?\u2019 I would reply with \u2018Over 95%!\u2019 I\nwould answer that way because I\u2019m very confident in\n\\(B\\)\u2019s truth and if I find out that Taylor disagrees with that\nidea, then I will be quite confident that she\u2019s wrong and\nI\u2019m right. So in that sense I think I have a definite\nepistemic advantage over her: given how confident I am in \\(B\\),\nI think that if it turns out we disagree over \\(B\\), there is a 95%\nchance I\u2019m right and she\u2019s wrong. Of course, given that I\nthink that we are equally likely to judge \\(B\\) correctly and\nI\u2019m very confident in \\(B\\), I\u2019m also very confident that\nshe will judge \\(B\\) to be true; so when I\u2019m asked to think\nabout the possibility that Taylor thinks \\(B\\) is false, I think\nI\u2019m being asked to consider a very unlikely scenario. But the\nimportant point here is this: if I have the view that if it turns out\nthat she really thinks \\(B\\) is false then the odds that I\u2019m\nright and she\u2019s wrong are 95%, then in some sense my view is\nthat she\u2019s not \u201cfully\u201d my peer on \\(B\\), as I think\nthat when it comes to the possibility of disagreement I\u2019m very\nconfident that I will be in the right and she won\u2019t be.\n\n\nNow consider another case. Suppose Janice and Danny are the same age\nand take all the same math and science classes through high school.\nThey are both moderately good at math. In fact, they almost always get\nthe same grades in math. On many occasions they come up with different\nanswers for homework problems. As far as they have been able to\ndetermine, in those cases 40% of the time Janice has been right, 40%\nof the time Danny has been right, and 20% of the time they have both\nbeen wrong. Suppose they both know this interesting fact about their\ntrack records! Now they are in college together. Danny believes, on\nthe basis of their track records, that on the next math problem they\nhappen to disagree about, the probability that Janice\u2019s answer\nis right equals the probability that his answer is right\u2014unless\nthere is some reason to think one of them has some advantage in this\nparticular case (e.g., Danny has had a lot more time to work on it, or\nsome other significant discrepancy in Disagreement Factors). Suppose\nfurther that on the next typical math problem they work on Danny\nthinks that neither of them has any advantage over the other this time\naround. And then Danny finds out that Janice got an answer different\nfrom his.\n\n\nIn this math case Danny first comes to think that \\(B\\) (his answer)\nis true. But he also thinks that if he were to discover that Janice\nthinks \\(B\\) is false, the probability that he is right and Jan is\nwrong are equal to the probability that he is wrong and Janice is\nright. That\u2019s very different from the global warming case in\nwhich I thought that if I were to discover that Taylor thinks \\(B\\) is\nfalse, the probability that I\u2019m right and she\u2019s wrong are\n19 times the probability that I\u2019m wrong and she\u2019s right\n(95% is 19 times 5%).\n\n\nLet\u2019s say that I think you\u2019re my conditional peer\non \\(B\\) if and only if before I find out your view on \\(B\\) but after\nI have come to believe \\(B\\) I think that if it turns out\nthat you disbelieve \\(B\\), then the chance that I\u2019m\nright about \\(B\\) is equal to the chance that you\u2019re right about\n\\(B\\). So although I think Taylor is my likelihood peer on the global\nwarming belief, I don\u2019t think she is my conditional peer on that\nbelief.  I think she is my conditional inferior on that matter. But in\nthe math case Danny thinks Janice is his likelihood peer and\nhis conditional peer on the relevant belief.\n\n\nSo, central to answering the Response Question and the Belief\nQuestion is the following:\n\nBetter Position Question: Are the people who disagree\nwith \\(B\\) in a better epistemic position to correctly judge\nthe truth-value of the belief than the people who agree with\n\\(B\\)?\n\n\nPut in terms of levels of confidence we get the following:\n\nBetter Position Question*: Are the people who have a\nconfidence level in \\(B\\) that is different from yours in a better\nepistemic position to correctly judge the truth-value of the\nbelief than the people who have the same confidence level as\nyours?\n\n\nThe Better Position Question is often not very easy to answer. For\nthe majority of cases of disagreement, with \\(X\\) realizing she disagrees\nwith \\(Y\\), \\(X\\) will not have much evidence to think \\(Y\\) is her peer, superior,\nor inferior when it comes to correctly judging \\(B\\). For instance, if I am\ndiscussing with a neighbor whether our property taxes will be\nincreasing next year, and I discover that she disagrees with me, I may\nhave very little idea how we measure up on the Disagreement Factors. I\nmay know that I have more raw intelligence than she has, but I probably\nhave no idea how much she knows about local politics, how much she has\nthought about the issue before, etc. I will have little basis for\nthinking I\u2019m her superior, inferior, or peer. We can call these\nthe unknown cases. Thus, when you discover that you disagree\nwith someone over \\(B\\), you need not think, or have reason to think, that\nshe is your peer, your superior, or your inferior when it comes to\njudging \\(B\\).\n\n\nA related question is whether there is any important difference\nbetween cases where you are justified in believing your interlocutor\nis your peer and cases where you may be justified in believing that\nyour interlocutor is not your peer but lack any reason to think that\nyou, or your interlocutor, are in the better epistemic\nposition. Peerhood is rare, if not entirely a fictional idealization,\nyet in many real-world cases of disagreement we are not justified in\nmaking a judgment regarding which party is better positioned to answer\nthe question at hand. The question here is whether different answers\nto the Response Question and the Belief Question are to be given in\nthese two cases.  Plausibly, the answer is no. An analogy may help. It\nis quite rare for two people to have the very same weight. So for any\ntwo people it is quite unlikely that they are \u2018weight\npeers\u2019. That said, in many cases it may be entirely unclear\nwhich party weighs more than the other party, even if they agree that\nit is unreasonable to believe they weigh the exact same\namount. Rational decisions about what to do where the weight of the\nparty matters do not seem to differ in cases where there are\n\u2018weight peers\u2019 and cases where the parties simply lack a\ngood reason to believe either party weighs more. Similarly, it seems\nthat the answers to the Response Question and the Belief Question will\nnot differ in cases of peer disagreement and cases where the parties\nsimply lack any good reason to believe that either party is\nepistemically better positioned on the matter.\n\n\nAnother challenge in answering the Better Position Question occurs\nwhen you are a novice about some topic and you are trying to determine\nwho the experts on the topic are. This is what Goldman terms the\n\u2018novice/expert problem\u2019 (Goldman 2001). While novices\nought to turn to experts for intellectual guidance, a novice in some\ndomain seems ill-equipped to even determine who the experts in that\ndomain are. Hardwig (1985, 1991) claims that such novice reliance on\nan expert must necessarily be blind, and thus exhibit an unjustified\ntrust. In contrast, Goldman explores five potential evidential sources\nfor reasonably determining someone to be an expert in a domain:\n\nArguments presented by the contending experts to support their own\nviews and critique their rivals\u2019 views.\nAgreement from additional putative experts on one side or other of the\nsubject in question.\nAppraisals by \u201cmeta-experts\u201d of the experts\u2019\nexpertise (including appraisals reflected in formal credentials earned\nby the experts).\nEvidence of the experts\u2019 interests and biases vis-a-vis the\nquestion at issue.\nEvidence of the experts\u2019 past\n\u201ctrack-records\u201d. (Goldman 2001, 93.)\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of the literature on the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement, however, concerns recognized peer disagreement (for\ndisagreement with superiors, see Frances 2013). We turn now to this\nissue.\n",
