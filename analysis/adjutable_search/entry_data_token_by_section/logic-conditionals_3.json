    "main_text": "Three-Valued Conditionals || Open issues\n2.3 Open issues\n\nDespite its simplicity, the use of trivalence raises several issues.\nOne open problem is how to deal with counterfactual\nconditionals\u2014the problem is not without options, but trivalence\nso far has been used mostly to deal with indicative conditionals. A\nrelated issue is how to make three-valued conditionals interact with\nmodalities and other operators more generally.\n\nAnother problem concerns the expressiveness of a finitely-valued\ntruth-functional account. McGee (1981) shows that the common\n\u201cflat\u201d \\(L_1\\)-fragment of the logics of conditionals of\nAdams, Stalnaker and Lewis, i.e., the system P,\ncannot be characterized in terms of the preservation of a designated\nset of truth-values in a finite-valued logic. Prima facie, this\nresults appears in tension with Adams\u2019s as well as Dubois and\nPrade\u2019s trivalent characterization of P. As\npointed out by M. Schulz (2009), however, the trivalent\ncharacterization proposed by Adams\u2014or indeed Dubois and\nPrade\u2014differs from the one entertained by McGee (it asks for\nmore than the preservation of a fixed set of designated values, and\nallows quantification over subsets of the\n premises).[1]\n As discussed by Schulz, whether a similar characterization can be\ngiven for the non-flat logics of Stalnaker and Lewis is an open\nquestion.\n",
