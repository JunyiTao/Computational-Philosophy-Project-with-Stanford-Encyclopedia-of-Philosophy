    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || Aristotle\n3.1 Aristotle\n\nThe work of Aristotle on the Rule of Law is still influential. Though\nhe formulated the question of whether it was better to be ruled by the\nbest man or the best laws, he approached that question realistically,\nnoting that it depended not only on the type of law one was\nconsidering but also on the type of regime that enacted and\nadministered the law in question (Politics 1282b)\n\n\nBut Aristotle did maintain that law as such had certain advantages as\na mode of governance. Laws are laid down in general terms, well in\nadvance of the particular cases to which they may be applied.\nMoreover, \n\n\nlaws are made after long consideration, whereas decisions in the\ncourts are given at short notice, which makes it hard for those who\ntry the case to satisfy the claims of justice. (Rhetoric\n1354b) \n\n\nThere were, he conceded, some cases so fraught with difficulty that\nthey could not be handled by general rules\u2014cases that required the\nfocused insight of particular judges; he used the term\nepieikeia (sometimes translated as equity). But these cases\nshould be kept to a minimum and legal training and legal institutions\nshould continue to play a role in the way they are disposed of.\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the general desirability of rules and\nhis treatment of epieikeia continue to influence modern\njurisprudence (see Scalia 1989 and Solum 1994).\n",
