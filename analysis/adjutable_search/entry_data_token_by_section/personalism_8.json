    "main_text": "Characteristics of personalist thought || Interiority and subjectivity\n6.3 Interiority and subjectivity\n\n\nPersonalists assert that only persons are truly\n\u201csubjects.\u201d This is not to say that in the syntactic sense\nother entities do not \u201cact\u201d or \u201cproduce\u201d or\n\u201ccause,\u201d but properly speaking they do not possess\nsubjectivity. In the modern sense, subjectivity depends primarily on\nthe unity of self-consciousness, and on interiority, freedom, and\npersonal autonomy. Though non-personal beings may \u201cact\u201d in\nthe syntactic sense, they are not truly subjects of action since the\ncause of their action is extrinsic to them. Despite the difference\nwith regard to the ultimate nature of the \u201cnon-personal\u201d\nbetween some personalists in the narrow sense and personalists in the\nbroader sense, there is in this area a considerable overlap between\nthe two forms of personalism. For theistic personalists, personal subjectivity embraces the moral\nand religious dimensions, which are part and parcel of the person\u2019s\nnature as a conscious, intelligent, free, willing subject in relation\nwith God and others. As free, thinking subjects, persons also exercise\ncreativity through their thought, imagination, and action, a\ncreativity which affects both the surrounding world and the person\nhimself. Furthermore, personalists have observed that the lived\nexperience of the human person, as a conscious and self-conscious\nbeing, discloses not only actions but also\ninner happenings that depend upon the self. These\nexperiences, lived in a conscious way, go into the makeup and\nuniqueness of the person as well. As regards the ethical question, not\nonly are persons free and responsible moral subjects, but their\nsubjectivity also conditions others\u2019 ethical responsibility toward\nthem.\n\n\nWhat we perceive as \u201cthings\u201d can be examined and known\nfrom the outside, as what is regarded as \u201cobjects\u201d. In a\nsense, they stand in front of us, they present themselves to us, but\nalways as outside of us. They can be described, qualified, and\nclassified. Classical-realist personalists accept the legitimacy, even\nnecessity, of knowing man too in this way. From this objective\nviewpoint it is possible to discern some of the superiority of the\nhuman being to the rest of reality. Yet in the human person, a\nthoroughly unique dimension presents itself, a dimension not found in\nthe rest of reality. Human persons experience themselves first of all\nnot as objects but as subjects, not from the outside but from the\ninside, and thus they are present to themselves in a way that no other\nreality can be present to them. But here the influence and value of\nthe phenomenological method, as well as of aspects of the earlier\nidealistic tradition, often makes itself especially felt in\npersonalism and adds to the classical-realist analysis. The essence of\nthe person is explored as an intuition from the inside, rather than as\na deduction from a system of thought or through empirical observation\nin the ordinary sense. The human being must be treated as a subject,\nmust be understood in terms of the modern view of specifically human\nsubjectivity as determined by consciousness.  But this contribution is\nnot conceived by personalists as simply replacing in every respect\nearlier, more objectivist notions of man, but quite as much as\ncomplementing them.\n\n\nThis conscious self-presence is the interiority of the human person,\nand it is so central to the meaning of the concept of person that one\ncan say that personality signifies interiority to self. Because of the\nperson\u2019s subjectivity, he is not only acted upon and moved by external\nforces, but also acts from within, from the core of his own\nsubjectivity. Since he is the author of his actions, he possesses an\nidentity of his own making, which cannot be reduced to objective\nanalysis and thus resists definition. This resistance to definition,\nthis irreducibility, do not mean that the person\u2019s subjectivity and\nlived experience are unknowable, but rather that we must come to know\nthem differently, by a method that merely reveals and discloses their\nessence. In lived experience of self-possession and self-governance,\none experiences that one is a person and a subject, and through\nsympathy and empathy one experiences the personhood of\nothers. To apply the early terminology with some added modern\nmeanings, the person comprises both an objective subsistence\n(\u03cd\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) and a\nsubjective subsistence\n(\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd).\n\n\nA conclusion of personalism is that the experience of the human being\ncannot be derived by way of cosmological reduction. We must pause at\nthe irreducible, at that which is unique and unrepeatable in each\nhuman being, that by virtue of which he or she is not just a particular\nhuman being \u2013 an individual of a certain species \u2013 but a\npersonal subject. This is the only way to come to a true understanding\nof the human being.  Obviously the framework of the irreducible is not\nexhaustive of the human condition, and such an understanding must be\nsupplemented by a cosmological perspective. Nevertheless, personalists\nwould say it is impossible to come to a true understanding of the\nperson while neglecting his subjectivity.\n\n\nThe focus on the subjectivity of persons explains many personalists\u2019\ninsistence on the difference between the concept of\n\u201cperson\u201d and that of \u201cindividual.\u201d Gilson\nwrote that \u201cevery human person is first an individual, but he is\nmuch more than an individual, since one only speaks of a person, as of\na personage, when the individual substance under consideration\npossesses in his own right a certain dignity.\u201d The major\ndistinction is that an individual represents a single unit in\na homogenous set, interchangeable with any other member of the set,\nwhereas a person is characterized by his uniqueness and\nirreplaceability.\n\n\nVon Balthasar, for example, wrote: \u201cFew words have as many\nlayers of meaning as\nperson. On the surface it means just any human being, any\ncountable individual. Its deeper senses, however, point to the\nindividual\u2019s uniqueness which cannot be interchanged and\ntherefore cannot be counted.\u201d In this deeper sense persons\ncannot, properly speaking, be counted, because a single person is not\nmerely one in a series within which each member is identical to the\nrest for all practical purposes and thus exchangeable for any other.\nOne can count apples, because one apple is as good as another (i.e.,\nwhat matters is not that it is this apple, but simply that it\nis an apple), but one cannot count persons in this\nway. One could count human beings, as individuals of the same species,\nbut the word person emphasizes the uniqueness of each member\nof the human species, his incommensurability and incommunicability. Von\nBalthasar goes on to say: \u201cIf one distinguishes between\nindividual and person (and we should for the sake of\nclarity), then a special dignity is ascribed to the person, which the\nindividual as such does not possess\u2026We will speak of a\n\u2018person\u2019\u2026when considering the uniqueness, the\nincomparability and therefore irreplaceability of the\nindividual.\u201d\n\n\nAs valid as these philosophical distinctions are, whether one speaks\nof a human individual or a human person, these are simply two names\napplied to the same reality. Personalists are quick to assert that\npersonality is not superadded to humanity, but is inherent to the\nessence of every human being, since it is rooted in human nature\nitself. \u201cHuman person\u201d and \u201chuman individual,\u201d\nwhile underscoring different dimensions of a human being, are\nsynonymous in everyday language and have the same referent. Some\nthinkers have proposed a real distinction between a human person and a\nhuman individual. From their perspective, personhood would be an\nacquired \u201cextra\u201d for a human being, a status reached not\nsimply by being an individual of the species, but by entering into\ncertain relationships with other persons in a conscious, intentional\nway. In other words, while all human persons would be human\nindividuals, the reverse would not be true.\n\n\nPersonalists typically reject this, and insist that each living human\nbeing normally possesses \u2013 actually and not merely potentially,\nalthough the importance of further development or actualization is\nstrongly stressed \u2013 the definitional and constitutive\nconsciousness, intentionality, will etc., the radical capacity to\nreason, laugh, love, and choose. These are not just some abstractly\nconceivable common characteristics of a species, but aspects of the\nunique, individual, organic functioning of every human being. In this\nway, personalists see personhood as subsisting even while its\noperations come and go with many changing factors such as immaturity,\ninjury, sleep, and senility.\n",
