    "main_text": "Scientific Apologetics\n2. Scientific Apologetics\n\nMersenne was indubitably an heir to the Thomistic view of a necessary\nsynthesis between Christian faith and philosophy. As expressed in the\npraefatium of the Quaestiones in Genesim, it is \u201ca duty\nof the learned to refute atheists\u201d, the tacit assumption being\nthat \u201ctrue philosophy never contradicts the teachings of the\nChurch\u201d (ID II: 490\u20131). This synthesis was vindicated in\nthe rather troubled political, and religious context of early\nseventeenth-century France, which still bore the scars of half a\ncentury of religious wars, and appeared exposed and vulnerable to what\nCatholics considered a severe crisis of orthodoxy, raging on all\nfronts. A rising tide of libertines, deists, skeptics, cabbalists,\nalchemists, and naturalist metaphysicians, all more or less\nconsciously in league with the Protestants, seemed to Mersenne on the\nverge of overwhelming the \u201ctrue\u201d Christian faith. Mersenne\noften pointed out the connection between Protestantism and the various\nforms of heterodoxy and atheism: the Calvinist belief in\npredestination insensibly drives men toward superstition and atheism,\nas it appears more difficult to believe that God wants our damnation,\nthan to represent Him as a \u201ccruel Saturn who devours his\nchildren\u201d, or simply to own that there is no God at all (ID II:\n589). So, Mersenne\u2019s early-interventions may be seen as taking\npart in the larger movement of \u201cre-catholization\u201d of the\nFrench state after the pacification allowed by the Edit de Nantes. In\nthis regard, Mersenne\u2019s advocacy of a harmonious conciliation of\nfaith and reason was not without similarities with a noted feature of\nGalileo\u2019s \u201ccultural program\u201d in the same years: both\nwanted to contribute to the Counter-Reformation, and both defended the\nspecific idea that Catholics should not leave to Protestant heretics\nthe monopoly of reason and scientific knowledge. Mersenne was however\nwary of any anti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties (including those\nof Galileo himself), as he saw them as ipso facto dangerously\nverging towards contesting religious truth. According to Garber\n(2004), the Aristotelian framework, particularly prominent in the\nfirst works, was adopted not so much for its philosophical virtues as\nsuch, but rather as a rampart of orthodoxy, as a tried doctrine, that\nhas long proved its ability to be harmoniously conjoined with\nChristian faith, and as it were to protect it. By contrast,\nalternative ways of thinking offered no such guarantee against heresy,\nas they were often defended with a zeal that was dangerously close to\nfanaticism. As Mersenne stated in the preface to the\nQuaestiones (1623):\n\n\nThese men who desire to found a new philosophy, and to demonstrate it\nfrom fundamental principles, never regard the glory of God. Rather\nthey strive with an ignorant obsessive zeal [cacozelia], by\nwhich they seek to shake up and overturn the Catholic religion, if\nthey are able to do it\u2014unless I am mistaken. (QG Praefatio,\ntranslated in Garber 2004: 141)\n\n\nThus it seems quite clear that the stakes of a book like the\nQuaestiones were not simply a defense of natural religion but\nalso, and perhaps primarily, a defense of catholic faith (and its\nmysteries) against the caricature conveyed in a growing number of\nwritings, that represented it as resulting from superstition and\nignorance:\n\n\nIt is appropriate to Catholics, and especially to theologians to know\nthe sciences and to scrutinize God\u2019s works, not only because we\nthus receive the meaning of His will as from the pages of a Book, but\nalso because we show how unfounded is the atheist\u2019s\nrepresentation of Catholics as melancholic, agitated with thousands\nscruples and superstitions. (QG: col 2 \u2013 translation here and\nelsewhere from the author, unless otherwise indicated)\n\n\nTo realize this aim, Mersenne\u2019s strategy was twofold: polemical\nand constructive. On the one hand he attacked his polymorph enemy with\nthe rhetorical instruments of a skilled debater, using the weapons of\nthe adversaries, or making one refute the other (as in the dialogue\nbetween the alchemist and the skeptic in the first book of La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences). Hermetic authors such as\nRobert Fludd, or cabbalistic Christians such as Giovanni Pico and\nJacques Gaffarel were vehemently denounced, as they availed themselves\nof spurious allegorical interpretations of the Bible. Even when their\nreading of the Bible is not wrong, they are dangerous as they make\npeople believe they can deduce a priori, or through divine\ninspiration, what can only be known a posteriori, through\nrevelation and experience. Heretic tendencies were pointed out in the\ndoctrines of the Alchemists, who, in the wake of Paracelsus\u2019s\nMysterium magnum, tried to give naturalist interpretations of\nChristian mysteries, such as the resurrection or the miracle of\nCreation. Mages, sorcerers, and adepts of esoteric mysteries such as\nthe Rosicrucians prosper on men\u2019s propensity to superstition.\nNaturalist metaphysicians\u2014Bruno, Campanella,\nPomponnazi\u2014who endowed nature with creative powers, verge\ndangerously toward pantheism, casting doubt on creation, on the\ntranscendence and freedom of God. A leading thread in all these\ncriticisms, is the idea that the Catholic belief in miracles and\nmysteries, far from being superstitious, is much more attuned to sound\nreason than the doctrines that are opposed to it. A light knowledge of\nphilosophy may induce some doubts, but the more one knows the\nsciences, the more these Catholic beliefs and mysteries are reinforced\nand may be vindicated against false religion and atheism. A smattering\nof knowledge in optics can for example cast doubt on the truth of\ndivine epiphanies, but a better knowledge of this same science allows\none to exclude the idea that miracles can be illusions caused by\nreflections or refractions and therefore makes more sensible their\ndivine origin (QG: col. 522, 538). This sort of negative argument\nshows that Mersenne\u2019s rationalist defense of religion allows for\ntruths beyond the capacity of men\u2019s reason. In this, Mersenne\nstand explicitly against the deist. Both allowed for \u201cnatural\nreligion\u201d, but whereas the deist denounced the superstition and\nanthropomorphism of popular belief, Mersenne reversed the attacks and\ndenounced the far worse anthropomorphism of one who measures God by\nhuman reason: \u201cit is feebleness of the mind, to believe that our\nfinite understandings can comprehend the divine attributes or\nacts\u201d (ID I: 318\u20139; see also ID I: 669\u201370, and\nBeaude 1980). This however should not be understood as revealing a\nsecret inclination towards fideism: religion teaches truths which\nsurpass reason, \u201cnot in destroying it, but rather in perfecting\nit\u201d (ID I: 680).\n\nMersenne\u2019s criticisms are based on a careful reading and\nexposition of the adverse doctrines, to the point that Mersenne has\nbeen sometimes taken to task for offering the enemies of religion a\nmuch too complacent advertisement. It has been remarked (Carraud 1994:\n152) that the discourse of others (le discours\nd\u2019autrui) holds a distinctive place in Mersenne\u2019s\nwritings: it is neither dismissed as in Descartes, nor deftly\nre-appropriated as in Leibniz, but rather faithfully produced and\nreported in order to be discussed on its own level and according to\nits own merits. This is the case, for example with the cabbalistic\n\u201csefirot\u201d and numerological methods which are\npatiently, almost sympathetically, expounded in the\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9. The same holds for Giordano\nBruno\u2019s doctrine. However heretical the man was, his arguments in\nfavor of the infinity and plurality of the worlds (from his De\nInfinito) are not simply dismissed or brushed aside. The\nChristian philosopher reports them quite accurately in the second part\nof the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 des d\u00e9istes, before\nanswering and criticizing them.\n\nApart from its polemical intent, Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific\napologetics\u201d may be seen as articulating a natural theology\ntogether with a \u201csacred physics\u201d or \u201csacred\nmathematics\u201d. On the one hand a host of rational\narguments\u2014some of them borrowed from the sciences, some from\ntraditional metaphysics\u2014are brought in to prove God\u2019s\nexistence and demonstrate His attributes. This natural theology is\nwhere Mersenne articulates his main ideas on metaphysics and we shall\ncome back to it in the next part of this article. On the other hand,\nscience is used as an instrument of exegesis. The Quaestiones in\nGenesim contains thus numerous scientific excursuses whose aim is\neither to give a scientific (mainly mathematical) exposition of a\nbiblical content\u2014as when Mersenne \u201ccalculates\u201d what\nshould be the size of Noah\u2019s ark, or suggests that our knowledge\nof architecture should help us to see the excellence of the temple of\nSolomon\u2014or to illustrate a Catholic mystery (such as the triadic\nunity of God or the miracle of the Creation) through a mathematical\nanalogy.\n\nThis edifying use of mathematics is perhaps the hallmark of\nMersenne\u2019s writings. It is still very much present in later\npublications (such as the Harmonie Universelle). The minim is\nliterally fascinated by the almost magical properties of numbers and\ngeometrical figures, where the most surprising and complicated objects\nand properties are generated from the simplest principles. This gives\nhim a general analogy for religious truths. There are \u201cthousands\nof things in the mysteries of faith\u201d that are\n\u201cincomprehensible to the pagan and to a peripatetic\nphilosopher\u201d, but that may be made understood by a\n\u201cChristian Euclid\u201d (un Euclide chr\u00e9tien) :\nMathematics makes the relation of the infinite to the finite sensible,\nshowing how an infinite motion can be made in a finite space. It can\nthus \u201cexplain\u201d the union of the two natures in the same\ndivine person. Although the mathematical point is the humblest object,\n\u201cthe minim of geometry\u201d (HU III: Livre de\nl\u2019Utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Harmonie, 16), it is in a sense the\nclosest to God itself. Both are simple, without parts. The point\nengenders the line and together with the line, the surfaces, and with\nlines and surfaces the bodies. This gives us an insight on how God\nengenders the son, the son and God together, the holy spirit, and then\nall together the universe. Unity contains all numbers eminently, as\nGod contains all created acts and all creatures, etc (ibid. 16\u201317).\nMersenne also likes to suggest mathematical analogies illustrating, or\nsymbolizing moral virtues. Thus, as the height of a triangle is\nmeasured by a perpendicular line elevated from the basis, the goodness\nof our actions is measured by the righteousness of our intention\n(\u201cla droite intention\u201d, VS I: 12). Mixed mathematics,\noptics, music and mechanics are also mobilized in the moral use of\nmathematics. For example:\n\n\nmechanics teaches us to live well, either by imitating heavy bodies\nwhich always seek their center in the center of the Earth, just as the\nspirit of Man must seek his own center in the divine essence which is\nthe source of all our spirits, or by maintaining ourselves in that\nperpetual moral and moderate balance which consists of rendering all\nthat belongs to Him first of all to God and then to our neighbor. (MC\nIV: 208\u201309)\n\n\nThe philosophical value of Mersenne\u2019s apologetics may be\ndifferently assessed. Mersenne seemed to pay little attention to\ncontemporary arguments according to which the Bible is not to be taken\nliterally on questions dealing with nature (see, e.g., Galileo\u2019s\n1615 Letter to Christina). His exegesis indeed offers a rather rough\nexample of what will be later called \u201cconcordism\u201d, the\nconception that there cannot be any discrepancy between the teachings\nof the sciences and those of the Bible, taken in the most literal\nsense. However, the most distinctive aspect of Mersenne\u2019s\napologetics, the edifying use of mathematics, although sometimes\nna\u00efve in its formulations, did have philosophical influence.\nPascal, who does not spare his sarcasm on those who think they can\n\u201cprove God from the course of the moon and the planets\u201d\n(Pascal 1963: 599, fg. 781), is nevertheless quite faithful to\nMersenne\u2019s use of mathematics, when he discusses men\u2019s\ndisproportion and God\u2019s greatness from the mathematical model of\nthe infinite divisibility of space, or from a speculation on the two\ninfinites whose terms are reminiscent of similar passages from the\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nBesides, although Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific\napologetics\u201d was primarily conceived as a defense of religion\nagainst \u201catheists\u201d, where science is only a tool, it\nturned out to be also a defense of mathematical sciences against\nwhoever might think that they are vain curiosity and must be either\nrejected, or at least relativized as inessential knowledge\u2026\nThis is especially manifest in the later works, where Mersenne gave\nfree rein to his passion for mathematical sciences. Whereas natural\ntheology and anti-deistic polemic were no longer dominant themes, he\nstill vindicated the \u201cusefulness\u201d of mathematics, not only\nfor men\u2019s welfare, but for their edifying virtues. In the next\ndecades, one could find similar moves in defense of the\n\u201cusefulness of natural experimental philosophy\u201d in the\nworks of Robert Boyle.\n",
