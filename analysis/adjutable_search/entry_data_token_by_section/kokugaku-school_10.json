Meiji Period (1868\u20131912) Kokugaku\n\u014ckuni Takamasa (1792\u20131871) and Fukuba Bisei (1831\u20131907)\n\n\u014ckuni Takamasa (1792\u20131871) and Fukuba Bisei\n(1831\u20131907) were samurai of Tsuwano domain, and both studied at\nthe domanial school Y\u014dr\u014dkan. Takamasa learned Kokugaku from\nHirata Atsutane and Murata Harukado, and studied for a time at\nSh\u014dheik\u014d Academy in Edo. In 1853, U.S. Commodore Perry led a\nfleet of four \u201cBlack Ships\u201d to the bay of Edo, which led\nto the Tokugawa bakufu signing treaties which opened Japanese ports to\nWestern powers. Facing the challenges of domestic politics and\nencroaching Western powers, Takamasa noted that the Kokugaku of the\nMotoori school which focused on \u201cancient matters\u201d and\nliterary texts, and that of Atsutane which concerned itself with the\nspirit realm of \u201cyumei\u201d or\n\u201ckakuriyo\u201d were insufficient to respond to\nforeigners. Takamasa renamed his version of Kokugaku\n\u201chongaku\u201d or \u201cmototsu\nmanabi\u201d, the \u201cessential learning\u201d, based on\n\u201chonky\u014d\u201d or the \u201cessential\nteachings\u201d which he quoted from the Kojiki. In his\nHongaku kyoy\u014d, completed in 1855, Takamasa outlines the\ngoal of his \u201chongaku\u201d scholarship:\n\n\nHonky\u014d refers to the genealogy of our emperor and the ancient\nmatters (furukoto) of the divine age which convey the truth\nof when heaven and earth were formed. When viewing the ancient\nmatters, on the surface it appears shallow, but underneath lies a deep\nwill. People of the world perceive shallowness of their surface and\ndismiss, or insult and ridicule it, and believe it is inferior to\nConfucian and Buddhist writings. Something I, Takamasa, remember from\nmy youth, is that I lamented this. Wondering how I could draw out this\ndeep will, I sincerely prayed to the Great Goddess Amaterasu and the\nGod Omoikane, that I may discern that divine providence, to draw out\nthat hidden will. Thus I became one who teaches people broadly about\nthis. (1855 [1971: 404])\n\n\nTakamasa characterizes Japan as a nation whose emperor is enthroned by\nthe Heavenly Decree and whose state is governed by the shogun. The\nshogun encourages its people to uphold and preserve the virtues of\nduty, filial piety, and chastity, while the daimyo protect their\ndomains. The people work industriously in their various occupations.\nTakamasa asserts Japan\u2019s emperor is superior among the monarchs\nof the world because Japan\u2019s imperial lineage, unlike the\nothers, is uninterrupted from ancient times. He cites this as evidence\nfor the greatness and superiority of Japan among nations of the world.\nTo make the Japanese aware of such things including their need to\ncontinuously uphold the virtues of duty, filial piety, and chastity is\nthe focal point of his \u201cHongaku\u201d form of Kokugaku\nteachings. He goes as far as to say that such teachings should even be\ntaught to foreigners.\n\nWhile asserting the \u201crevere emperor, expel barbarians\u201d\nideology of late-Tokugawa, Takamasa acquiesced to the opening of the\ncountry as a necessary initial response, but proposed to eventually\nexpel foreigners over time. He wrote in Hongaku\nkyoy\u014d,\n\n\nNow foreign countries frequently send warships to seek commercial\nrelations. Although commercial relations are a good thing which are\nmutually beneficial, warships are weapons for conquering a nation.\nUtilizing these to start a war is to be a bandit. For the sake of the\nnation, it is necessary to expel and remove them. (1855 [1971:\n428])\n\n\nAfter studying at the domanial school, Fukuba Bisei later became a\ndisciple of Takamasa and Hirata Kanetane. From 1863 Bisei became\nactive politically in support of the imperial court against the\nTokugawa shogunate. In the late-Tokugawa years, Bisei took his orders\nfrom the daimyo Kamei Koremi, working in support of political reforms.\nIn 1867, Bisei directed the Separation of Kami and Buddhas\nmovement in Tsuwano, then worked with Takamasa to draft the Separation\nedicts issued across Japan in 1868. Those edicts forcibly removed\nBuddhist elements from shrines to re-establish them as exclusively\nShinto institutions. That same year, the Council of Divinity\n(Jingikan) was established as the highest office of\ngovernment, even above the Council of State (Daj\u014dkan),\nto carry out religious rituals of the imperial court and state. Bisei\nserved as a magistrate in this Council as well as a tutor to the\nimperial court. Working with Takamasa, Bisei formulated a Shinto theology which asserted that\nall shrines would be used to perform rites of the state.\n\nThe Hirata school had placed primacy on the kami\n\u014ckuninushi, lord of the underworld, and Ame-no-Minakanushi, one\nof the three creator deities. By contrast, that view was eclipsed by\nthe Shinto promoted by Takamasa and Bisei, who placed Amaterasu at the\ncenter of the pantheon, following the teachings of Motoori Norinaga\nand Aizawa Seishisai (1782\u20131863). Bisei worked as a high\nadministrator of Shinto affairs for the Meiji state and served as the\nmain administrator of the Great Promulgation Campaign (Taiky\u014d\nsenpu und\u014d). From 1870 through 1884, this campaign aimed to\ndevelop a popular awareness and understanding of \u201cShinto\u201d,\nand Bisei trained priests as national evangelists to proselytize a\nnational doctrine. As a part of these efforts to develop Shinto as a\nstate religion, Bisei contributed to the Unity of Religion and\nPolitics (saisei itchi, lit. Unity of Rites and Political\nRule) policy which presented the emperor as a sacred ruler who\nperformed rituals as part of governance. Rather than articulate his\nideas through writings, Bisei applied Kokugaku knowledge through\nrenewed rites and policies of the court and state.\n",
