    "main_text": "Who, or What, Can Dominate? || Domination by Agents, Group Agents, and Groups\n2.1 Domination by Agents, Group Agents, and Groups\n\nThe neorepublican tradition (i.e., the tradition of thinking about\ndomination associated primarily with the historical scholarship of\nQuentin Skinner and the political theory of Philip Pettit) tends to\npresent domination as a relation between agents; only agents can\ndominate or be dominated (Pettit 1997: 52), though the agent/agents\nmight be a group or collective. Domination by groups may not require\nthat they do so as a group agent (List & Pettit 2011:\n19\u201341). The metaphysics of group agency usually require shared\nbeliefs or joint intentions among the members of the group; but,\ndominating power may be grounded in group membership (white people in\nWestern racialized hierarchies, men in patriarchy) even if that group,\nor some of its members, do not meet the metaphysical requirements for\ngroup agency. At least for those who think unexercised power is\nsufficient for domination, a man who rejects the patriarchy of his\nsociety may still dominate women because of what he is in a position\nto do\u2014e.g., have his testimony in court taken more seriously\nthan a woman\u2019s\u2014even if he explicitly rejects and tries to\nundermine patriarchal institutions.\n\nA minority position in the literature sees domination fundamentally as\na relation between groups, where any domination between individuals is\nparasitic on group membership. If this is true, the domination of one\nindividual by another counts as such only because one belongs to a\ndominant group and the other belongs to a subordinate group\n(Wartenberg 1990).\n",
