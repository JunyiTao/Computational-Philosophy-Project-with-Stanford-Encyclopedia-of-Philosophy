    "main_text": "Hook\u2019s Defense of the Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge\n2. Hook\u2019s Defense of the Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge\n\nAt the center of Hook\u2019s support for pragmatism was the\njustification of the pragmatic theory of knowledge. This justification\ncharacteristically took the form of setting the pragmatic theory\nagainst two opposing conceptions of truth which were identified as the\n\u201ccorrespondence\u201d theory of truth, which was advocated by\nphilosophical Realists, and the \u201ccoherence\u201d theory of\ntruth, which was advanced by philosophical Idealists. For Hook, the\nsuperiority of pragmatism was most evident in the recognition that it\nwas the only theory of knowledge which explained why the attainment of\nknowledge was important for human activity in its interaction with the\nenvironment. In the pragmatic theory of knowledge, the discovery and\nconfirmation of true hypotheses about the nature of the world was\nunderstood as the realization of an instrument that enabled human\nbeings to predict and control aspects of their environment.\n\nIn contrast, whatever the merit of the correspondence theory of truth,\nit could not ground a theory of knowledge that could explain why why\nthe attainment of truth should make a difference in human affairs. In\nsuch theories, as truth is a matter of statements\n\u201cmirroring\u201d or \u201ccopying\u201d reality, knowledge is\nnot connected with the human ability to experimentally alter the\nenvironment. Here Hook remained faithful to the early pragmatism of\nPeirce and James, which featured a standard criticism of the\ncorrespondence theory as presupposing human beings as \u201cpassive\nspectators\u201d whose role in knowledge is that of mirroring the\nobjects and events of the environment in which the knower finds\nhimself. The pragmatist indictment was that the correspondence theory\nof truth relegated the knower to the role of \u201cpassive\nspectator\u201d in a completed universe, an image that is at odds\nwith the success of experimental scientific inquiry. Picking up on\nthemes in Dewey\u2019s work on experimental method, Hook argued that\nknowledge is best conceived as an instrument for human prediction and\ncontrol of the environment. This remained a significant pragmatist\ninsight to be recognized even in the context of later and more\nsophisticated interpretations of the correspondence theory, like\nAlfred Tarski\u2019s \u201csemantic theory of truth.\u201d Despite\nthe pragmatic criticism of the correspondence theory, Dewey, Hook and\nother pragmatists like C.I. Lewis recognized the legitimacy of the\ngoal of this theory in its aspiration to realize a connection between\nhuman language about the world and the facts of the world, or between\nlinguistic assertions and what actually \u201cis the case\u201d in\nthe world.\n\nTo appreciate the full force of the pragmatist theory of knowledge, it\nmust be positioned in opposition not only to Realist views rooted in\nthe correspondence theory of truth, but also to Idealist views that\nare based in the coherence theory of truth. Idealists, from the\npre-pragmatic generation of Bradley and Royce to the later writings of\nBrand Blanshard, had identified truth with consistency or coherence.\nPragmatists could accept that the truth of logical or mathematical\nsystems could be defined in terms of their consistency since such\nsystems could be understood as abstract formal structures of language\nwithout requiring confirmation or applicability to empirical\nexperience. A coherence theory, however, could not provide a criterion\nfor truth. In a contingent universe, where empirical events were not\nderived from a set of consistent axioms but were parts of the flux of\nexperience of nature, no criterion of consistency or coherence could\nprovide the basis for an account of truth. From the pragmatic\nperspective, the coherence theory presupposed and required a\nmetaphysical conception of the world as forming parts of the absolute\nmind so that inconsistent and incoherent events were excluded. The\nrejection of an Idealist theory of absolute mind in metaphysics by\nPeirce, James and Dewey brought with it their rejection of a coherence\ntheory of truth in epistemology. Thus for pragmatism, truths about the\nworld were not arrived at by the criterion of coherence but by a\nmethod through which verifiable empirical hypotheses were confirmed in\nexperimental practice.\n\nAgainst both competitors, pragmatists claim the advantage of being\nable to neatly tether knowledge to successful inquiry. With successful\ninquiry understood as the controlled and deliberate transformation of\none\u2019s surroundings, Dewey and Hook were able to draw an explicit\ntie between their pragmatist theory of knowledge and at least one\ninstance of highly impactful science, namely Darwinian biology. That\nis, they saw it as an attractive feature of their conception of\nknowledge that it was friendly to a conception of the human mind as an\nevolved instrument for improved prediction and control of the\nenvironment.\n\nBoth Hook and Dewey sought to place the application of the scientific\nmethod and the pragmatic theory of knowledge in the maelstrom of human\nsocial, cultural and political issues. Even in these difficult\ndomains, they believed that the Peircian model of scientific method\ncould be realized. Just as Peirce had suggested that a history of\nexperimental method would demonstrate a movement from fallible\nhypotheses to their progressive replacement by other fallible\nhypotheses with greater degrees of confirmation approaching the\nasymptotic limit ascribed to truth, Dewey and Hook argued that the\npragmatic theory of knowledge or truth should pursue this scientific\nmethod with respect to what Dewey had termed the \u201cproblems of\nmen.\u201d\n\nWhile the contrast between the convergence in the natural sciences\nwithin the community of inquiry and the divergence and disagreement\nover political and social issues within a political community is\nhistorically evident, there is a theoretical basis for the pragmatic\nthesis of a unitary method. Scientific method requires that inquirers\nare committed to the rational and open-minded investigation and\nanalysis of experimental consequences. The celebrated illustration\nthat Galileo cites is that he is unable to persuade his critics of the\ntruth of scientific results if they refuse to look through the\ntelescope. Similarly, the existence of persons whose antecedent\nattitudinal framework or whose bias within their structuring of their\nperceptions limits their ability to observe the empirical evidence\nthat is relevant for resolving an issue does not negate the\nobjectivity of the factual evidence or the legitimacy of the\nacceptance of the hypotheses that represent the optimal interpretation\nof the data. Along these lines, the optimal policy option or decision\nfor resolving a problematic situation is also open, to a degree, to\nobjective confirmation or refutation. Thus Hook identified his\nfoundational belief to be a pragmatic theory of knowledge derived from\nDewey as the basis for his extended forays into public debate over a\nhost of political and social questions.\n\nThe broadness of this justification of pragmatic theory of knowledge\nwas one aspect of Hook\u2019s effort, later abandoned, to ally\npragmatism with Marxism. One parallel which provided a basis for\nHook\u2019s effort was the pragmatists\u2019 identification of truth\nas instrumental in transforming the human condition. Thus for Hook,\nthe pragmatic theory of knowledge was paralleled by the well-known\npassage in Marx\u2019s \u201cTheses on Feuerbach.\u201d\nMarx\u2019s gnomic statement that \u201cPhilosophers have hitherto\nonly interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change\nit\u201d could be interpreted as indicating the distinction between\nan account of knowledge in which the knower or spectator sought to\nduplicate or interpret in language the phenomena of the real world, as\nopposed to the ways in which an experimentalist knower would develop\nhypotheses which would result in the transformation of the environment\naccording to predictable hypotheses. From this perspective, the\nvindication of the Marxist hypothesis by the consequences of its\ntransformational activity paralleled the general pragmatic thesis of\nthe vindication of an hypothesis by its success in modifying the\nnatural and human environment.\n\nThe truth of the hypothesis could not be recognized except as\nconfirmed by the changes that its application to experience generated\nfor future experience. By stressing this parallel between Marx and\nDeweyan instrumentalism, Marxism was not interpreted by Hook as a\ndogmatic thesis about historical inevitability but as an experimental\nhypothesis to be confirmed by its future consequences. In developing\nthis parallel, Hook also asserted that his interpretation of Marx\ndiffered from the materialist variant of an Hegelian dialectic of\nhistory, which he ascribed to \u201corthodox idolaters\u201d of\nMarxism (Hook, The Meaning of Marx, 1934, \u201cThe Meaning\nof Marx\u201d). The analogy to Deweyan pragmatism also enabled Hook\nto differentiate his interpretation of Marxism from what he referred\nto as the misinterpretation by Stalin and the Soviet authorities\nwhich, according to Hook, had transmuted Marxism into a species of\nsecular religion.\n\nFor Hook, the connection between Marxism and pragmatism ran deeper\nthan the connection between knowledge as an instrument of change in\npragmatism and knowledge as an instrument for revolutionary\ntransformation in Marxism. On Hook\u2019s interpretation,\nMarx\u2019s theory could be identified as an application of\nscientific method to social and economic history. The Marxist theory\nwould then be justified in the same way that any scientific hypothesis\nwould be justified, that is, through confirmation by empirical\nevidence. Thus, the Marxist interpretation of the \u201ccontradiction\nof capitalism\u201d could be interpreted as a verifiable empirical\nhypothesis about the ways in which the class relations of production,\nthat is, the ways the manufactured and agricultural enterprises of a\ncountry were owned and managed, fettered or blocked the social forces\nof production, that is, the ability of these enterprises to produce a\nmuch greater volume of products that could more fully satisfy the\nneeds of persons in a society. The revolutionary slogan calling for\nthe liberation of the social forces of production directed against the\nclass relations of capitalist society could be interpreted as a\nverifiable empirical hypothesis that socializing the means of\nproduction would bring about a far greater volume of products and\ntheir distribution to a much greater range of persons in the society.\nAlong these lines, Marxism represented the application of scientific\nmethod to the current empirical realities of society. Hook did not\nbalk at referring to Marxism as developing a \u201cscience of\nhistory.\u201d Similarly, he referred to the Marxist theory and\npractice of revolution as analogous to the Deweyan model of the\napplication of scientific method to the resolution of a problematic\nsituation.\n\nOn this interpretation of Marxism, the philosophical presupposition of\nMarx and Engels which were identified as dialectical materialism were\nincompatible with the delineation of Marxism as a scientific and\nexperimental hypothesis. Thus, while, or even because Hook asserted\nhis belief in a version of Marxism as compatible with pragmatism as an\nexperimental hypothesis, the various theses of Marxist dialectical\nmaterialism were subjected to an intensely probing and extremely\nskeptical criticism in his writings. Consequently, Hook found himself\nto be identified as a supporter of Marxism through an unorthodox\ninterpretation of that theory, while at the same time he was\ncastigated as an opponent of Marxism by the recognized authoritative\nfigures of the Marxist movement because of his severe criticism of the\nmetaphysical claims within the Marx-Engels canon regarding dialectical\nmaterialism. Hook\u2019s interpretation of Marxism as a scientific\nhypothesis would appear to be compatible with the Marxist\nmovement\u2019s preferred characterization of its theory as\n\u201cscientific socialism\u201d in opposition to \u201cutopian\nsocialism.\u201d Yet, scientific socialism was asserted by its\nfollowers to be a species of ultimate philosophical truth rather than,\nas Hook\u2019s pragmatic interpretation required, a set of fallible\nand corrigible hypotheses about the historical situation, including\ncontemporaneous economic processes and their eventual outcomes. It was\nevident to believers in Marxism as a kind of secular faith or religion\nthat its interpretation as a species of experimental science left the\nway open for its refutation and revision or rejection in light of the\nanalysis of future consequences. For Marxists, and to a significant\ndegree for Hook, in the early 1930s Marxism was a commitment of faith\nand a normative guide to revolutionary action. Yet as an experimental\ntheory according to Peircian pragmatic principles, it would admit of\n\u201cdisconfirmation\u201d or refutation in the light of future\nhistorical evidence. From this perspective, in the context of the\n1920s, the empirical nature of the institutions of the socialist\nsociety in the Soviet Union and their development in the near future\ncould be identified as representing factors that would confirm or\nrefute the Marxist hypothesis.\n\nHook\u2019s philosophical position was characterized by his\naffirmation of Marxism and activist commitment to its implementation\nin the United States, even as he concluded that the evidence of the\nfailure of socialist institutions and Marxist practices in the Soviet\nUnion had increasing weight. Even as Hook became deeply involved in\nthe socialist and communist political movements during the late 1920s\nand early 1930s, the analysis of the negative evidence derivable from\ndevelopments within Soviet society was reshaping his positive attitude\ntoward Marxism. Consequently, Hook\u2019s involvement with Marxism\noscillated between his continuous exploration of Marxist theory\nincluding its historical origins and his increasing criticism of\nSoviet institutions and Communist Party practice. The critical\napproach to Soviet society and pro-Soviet movements gradually\ndisplaced the previous vindication of Marxist theory.\n\nOne continuing aspect of Hook\u2019s involvement in Marxism was the\ncompletion in 1935 of his most significant scholarly contribution to\nthe development of Marxist thought: From Hegel to Marx. This\nresearch had been undertaken during his residence in Europe, primarily\nin Germany and briefly in Moscow, after the completion of his doctoral\ndissertation at Columbia. In Moscow, Hook had carried out research at\nthe Marx-Engels Institute in 1929, which was then headed by a scholar\nof the history of Marxism, David Riazanov. A tension between two\nopposing attitudes was paradigmatic of Hook\u2019s involvement in\nMarxism during that period. On the one hand, Hook was immersing\nhimself in what were considered canonic texts of Leninism; on the\nother hand, Hook was to discover himself reacting with abhorrence to\nthe purge of Riazanov from the Institute, in part, presumably, on\naccount of his objectivity in his approach to the sacred texts of the\nnew State.\n\nFrom Hegel to Marx provided an analysis of the origins of\nMarxist theory through an account of Marx\u2019s intellectual\nconfrontation with each of the Young Hegelians who had sought to\ninterpret the relevance of Hegel for developments in European society.\nHook tried to show how Marx\u2019s successive rethinking of the\nwritings of David Strauss, Bruno Bauer, Arnold Ruge, Max Stirner,\nMoses Hess and Ludwig Feuerbach led to the emergence of his own\n\u201cscientific theory of history.\u201d Hook\u2019s study did\njustice to the subtleties of the polemics that flourished among the\nYoung Hegelians on diverse issues including the nature of emancipation\nin bourgeois society or the function of religion in relationship to\nclass consciousness in European society. Further, by selecting these\nthinkers as the originating background for Marx rather than focusing\nupon Marx\u2019s earlier philosophical manuscripts, Hook was able to\nprovide evidence for the interpretation of Marx that indicated links\nwith a pragmatic theory of knowledge and a nascent experimental social\nscience. Accordingly, Hook could suggest that just as the pragmatists\nlike Dewey had moved beyond the Hegelian tradition toward a\nnaturalistic account of mind and of human self-consciousness, so\nMarxism had moved beyond the idealistic framework of Hegelian thought\ntoward a materialistic and potentially scientific account of\nhistorical change as the process of dialectic.\n\nHook\u2019s final attempt to provide an interpretation of Marxism\nwhich was consistent with pragmatism was developed in his 1933 book\nToward the Understanding of Karl Marx. In this work, arguably\nfor the last time, Hook defended the closeness of the analogy between\nthe Marxist theory of knowledge as connected to revolutionary activism\nand the pragmatic theory of knowledge as requiring confirmation of\nhypotheses by their experimental consequences. In this work, also\narguably for the last time, Hook sustained the interpretation of Marx\nas a critical and experimental science of history which was to be\ntested by the future historical relationship between the social forces\nof production or technology and the class relations of production in a\ncapitalist society.\n\nSince, as previously noted, Hook\u2019s interest in Marxism was not\nan abstract theoretical one, but involved his personal commitment and\nactivity in the arena of contemporaneous politics, it was virtually\ninevitable that the focus of his concern would shift toward the major\nevents that emerged as the dominant historical realities of the 1930s.\nHook\u2019s political thought was pioneering in the critical\nintensity that he brought to bear upon two major movements of the\n1930s: Stalinism and Nazism.\n\nHook went against the grain of the growing radical movements in the\nUnited States which had become more pro-Soviet as the economic\ndepression lengthened and the New Deal was perceived on the left as\nhaving failed to solve the problems of the depression. Hook became a\nsevere critic of the movement of policy in the Soviet Union, including\nthe formulation of the charge that the Soviet rehabilitation camps\nwere actually a form of slave labor, that the purges of writers and\nartists represented brutal repression, and that the trials of leading\nmembers of the Communist Party and the Politburo were show trials\nwhich involved framing the accused in order to strengthen\nStalin\u2019s position in his struggle for complete power.\nHook\u2019s criticism of communism in the Soviet Union went through\nseveral phases and the earliest phase was not anti-socialist, perhaps\nnot even anti-communist, but could be identified as anti-Stalinist. It\nalso represented a degree of identification with the thought and\npolitical approach of what was termed during that time Trotskyism.\n\nHook was distinguished from many in the radical movement in the 1930s\nin his recognition of the novel threat of Nazism to European and\nWestern society. For most Marxist theorists, the emergence of Nazism\ncould not be considered a major historical threat since the laws of\nhistorical inevitability were believed to prove that socialism must\nfollow the capitalist crisis. The success of Nazism in Germany must\nthen be explained away as a passing phenomenon in the decadent\n\u201clast phase of capitalism.\u201d Even as a post-doctoral\nstudent in Germany in the late 1920s, Hook had expressed criticism of\nthe approach to the elections in Germany of the Communist Party in\ntheir confidence that any Nazi triumph would be brief and would\nnecessarily be followed by the transfer of power toward socialism and\nthe Communist Party. Hook\u2019s opposition to Nazism included a\npartial recognition of the extreme price that even a brief\ntransitional period of Nazi rule could exact in Europe. It was this\nopposition to Nazism that led Hook to subsequently break decisively\nwith the Trotskyite position in the early 1940s.\n\nIt is significant that Hook\u2019s vindication of Marxism by\nreference to its scientific character paves the way for the refutation\nof Marxism when its predicted consequences are not verified in\npractice. Hook\u2019s practical political involvement throughout the\n1930s with the record of Soviet dictatorship as well as with the\nregressive oppression by the National Socialist regime in Germany\nprovided strong evidence that his own predictions about the future of\ncapitalism and socialism that had been derived from Marxist theory\nwere not being verified by the historical events. Even more generally,\nthe idea that there could be a \u201cscience of history\u201d which\nwould allow human prediction and control of historical outcomes was\nrefuted for any open-minded observer of the facts whose vision was not\nblinkered or blinded by faith in a theoretical construction.\n\nHook\u2019s enduring commitment to Deweyan pragmatism contributed to\nhis ultimate rejection of Marxism. The understanding of verification\nin pragmatic theory as requiring experimental confirmation of\nhypotheses by an appeal to derived, predictable consequences\nilluminated crucial dissimilarities between pragmatism and a Marxist\ntheory of verification through revolutionary activism in societal\ntransformation. Further, the interpretation of the scope and limits of\nscientific method in the attainment of knowledge led to a\nclarification of the extreme difficulties, insuperable in\nmethodological terms, between the establishment of a natural science\nand the realization of a \u201cscience of history.\u201d Thus\nHook\u2019s continuing commitment to the exploration of Deweyan\npragmatism led him to the abandonment of his support for Marxism. To a\ndegree, Hook\u2019s focus on foundational moral issues shifted by the\nlate 1930s from the investigation of the compatibility of Deweyan\npragmatism with Marxism toward the defense of Deweyan ethical\nnaturalism against the tide of opposition from moral absolutism and\nfrom moral emotivism.\n\nBefore turning to Hook\u2019s defense of ethical naturalism in moral\ntheory, the practical issues that dominated contemporaneous political\ndiscussion merit review. There are three elements that were connected\nto contemporaneous political controversy.\n\nThe first issue was the question of the nature of Stalin\u2019s rule\nin the Soviet Union, which was highlighted by the trials of leading\nfigures of the Russian Revolution, including, most prominently, Leon\nTrotsky. A second major issue was the interpretation of the character\nof the Nazi regime which was given primary significance by the\nquestion of American support for Britain at the risk of war with Nazi\nGermany. The policy options raised by the discussion of these two\npractical issues brought to the fore, for Hook, the more general issue\nof the relative weight to be ascribed to political factors as opposed\nto economic factors, that is, the value of the existence of\ninstitutions of democracy or dictatorship compared with the value of\nthe institutions of capitalism or socialism.\n\nOn the first issue, Hook acted directly by requesting John Dewey to\nserve as the judge of a proposed impartial tribunal which would\nexamine the justice of the charges that had been brought by the Soviet\ngovernment under Joseph Stalin against Leon Trotsky. To a degree, such\na tribunal could be justified as an extension and application of the\npragmatic method. The tribunal would seek to resolve conflicting\nopinions by an appeal to evidence and by undertaking a form of free\ninquiry. Dewey accepted Hook\u2019s argument that Trotsky may have\nbeen the victim of injustice by a socialist society. Presumably, such\nan injustice merited some attempt at rectification, particularly since\nthe Soviet Union had assumed a role of a morally progressive society\nin its relation to Western societies and Dewey himself had lauded\nSoviet education experiments as progressive on his visit to that\ncountry in 1928. Accordingly, Dewey agreed to become the judge of a\nquasi-formal trial of Leon Trotsky to be held in the country of\nTrotsky\u2019s exile, Mexico, on the charges that the Soviet Union\nhad brought against him. This form of trial does not have a juridical\nfunction so that the goal of the trial may be considered as carrying\nout an educational rather than judicial function. The moral authority\nof John Dewey enhanced the credibility of the proceedings. The trial\ninvolved a rigorous examination of the evidence against Trotsky.\nTrotsky himself was cross-examined as a witness at the trial. The\nresult was a verdict rendered by Dewey which was essentially\nrecognized as a declaration that Trotsky was not guilty of the charges\nbrought against him by the Soviet authorities.\n\nOne byproduct of this trial was Dewey\u2019s published analysis of\nthe set of Trotsky\u2019s beliefs about Marxism, freedom, scientific\nmethod and democracy. Dewey had concluded that Trotsky did not\nunderstand the nature of democracy and its required toleration for the\nrights of the minority in the process of government. Dewey argued that\nTrotsky\u2019s approach revealed a mind that was \u201clocked in\nabsolutes\u201d and failed to recognize the variable and contingent\nnature of historical processes. Trotsky\u2019s belief that Marxism\nhad provided a theory of scientific socialism which was a blueprint\nfor the development of the historical future was not consistent with\nthe pragmatic understanding of the scientific method. Although Hook\nhad taken the initiative in generating Dewey\u2019s involvement in\nthe vindication of Trotsky, he shared Dewey\u2019s negative\nconclusions about the compatibility of Trotsky\u2019s beliefs with\npragmatism, freedom and democracy.\n\nIn the debate over the second issue, that is, opposition to Nazism\nincluding the risk of American entry into the Second World War, Hook\nfurther distanced himself from the Marxist or the Trotskyist approach.\nThe leading intellectual journal of political discussion of the left\nduring this period was Partisan Review. This magazine, which\nhad been founded as a communist literary journal devoted to the\nunlikely union of Marxism with aesthetic modernism, had been taken\nover by the Trotskyist movement in the mid-1930s. Sidney Hook served\non its editorial board along with his colleague in the New York\nUniversity Philosophy Department, James Burnham, and the Columbia\nUniversity Professor of English and literary critic, Lionel Trilling.\nThe editors of Partisan Review published a controversial\neditorial against American support for Britain and the anti-Nazi cause\non the ground that such support could lead the United States into the\nwar against Nazi Germany. The Partisan Review editorial\nfollowed the Trotskyist theoretical position that had been formulated\nduring the period shortly before the Second World War. The Trotskyist\nview was that the United States was a corporate capitalist society\nwhose militarization would be facilitated by its entry into the war.\nConsequently, a war between the United States and Nazi Germany would\nrepresent a war between two forms of corporate capitalist militarism.\nThis kind of war was identified as one during which the forces of\nsocialism, which were considered as the forces of democracy, would\nprobably experience repression and from which, in any event, they\ncould expect no benefit.\n\nHook\u2019s rejection of this argument indicates the distance he had\nmoved from Marxism and Trotskyism. The empirical facts regarding\nNational Socialism could not be identified as a phase within the\ndecadent death throes of international capitalism. Rather, the\nempirical facts of Nazi aggression and Nazi aims required a practical\nassessment and appropriate response freed from the blinders of Marxist\nhistorical determinism. The policy options had to be examined from the\nperspective of political and moral realism with an evaluation of their\npotential consequences.\n\nIn assessing his support for the capitalist democratic societies like\nthe United Kingdom and the United States against the socialist Soviet\nUnion governed by a single Communist Party or the national socialism\nof Germany governed by a single National Socialist German\nWorkers\u2019 Party, Hook explicitly affirmed that the defense and\npreservation of the institutions of political democracy that permitted\nfreedom for individuals and groups were a much more important priority\nthan the transfer of the ownership of the means of production from\nindividuals and corporations to a socialist state. This conclusion\nwent directly counter to the Marxist view that the political\norganization of a society was secondary to the primary economic\nstructure of the society, that is, in one Marxist phrasing, that a\nstate is nothing but the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. This\nconclusion, which emerged during the debate over support for the\nUnited States against Nazi Germany, was subsequently to become a\nstrong basis for Hook\u2019s support for American policy against the\nSoviet Union during the period that is referred to as the Cold\nWar.\n\nOne additional aspect of Hook\u2019s consideration of the\nrelationship between pragmatism and Marxism was his attempt to set up\nan \u201cexperimental\u201d test for the vindication or refutation\nof Marxism as an historical theory. Hook\u2019s analysis of the role\nof the heroic person at different periods in history that was carried\nout in his 1943 study The Hero in History can be interpreted\nas developing such a \u201ccrucial experiment.\u201d In the final\nchapter of this study, the role of Lenin as the hero of the Russian\nRevolution is examined. It is evident on Hook\u2019s account that the\nRussian Revolution cannot be adequately understood as an historical\ntransformation that was carried out under inevitable dialectical laws.\nThe empirical historical narrative of the period does not cohere with\na theoretical construction according to which the social forces of\nproduction of pre-Soviet Russia were being fettered by the class\nrelations of production of a capitalist society resulting in an\ninevitable revolutionary transformation.\n\nFor Hook, the realization of Leninist rule in Russia required that\nLenin be interpreted as an \u201cevent-making\u201d hero. This\nthesis is incompatible with Marxism. According to Marxism, the actions\nof those who are identified as heroes in history must be interpreted\nas \u201cdetermined,\u201d or strongly \u201cconditioned,\u201d by\nthe economic substructure. In The Hero in History,\nHook\u2019s criticism of the Marxist theory of history hinges upon an\naccount of the historical achievements of the hero, Lenin, who brought\nabout a Marxist state in Russia. Thus, ironically, the work that\nmarked Hook\u2019s final break with Marxism was an un-Marxist\ninterpretation of the achievement of Lenin in his founding of the\nMarxist socialist state.
