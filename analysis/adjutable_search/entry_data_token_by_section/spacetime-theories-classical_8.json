    "main_text": "Newtonian Absolute Space in the Twentieth Century\n5. Newtonian Absolute Space in the Twentieth Century\n\nThis article is largely a historical survey of prominent views.\nHowever, it is hard to fully understand those debates without knowing\nsomething about scientific and mathematical developments have changed\nrecent understanding of the issues. In particular, a spacetime\napproach can clarify the situation with which the interlocutors were\nwrestling, and help clarify their arguments. This is a point widely\nrecognized in the secondary literature, and indeed colors much of what\nis said there (for good and bad, as we shall touch on later). So a\nshort digression into these matters is important for engaging the\nliterature responsibly; that said, while \u00a77 presupposes this\nsection, the reader only interested in \u00a76 could skip this\nsection.\n",
