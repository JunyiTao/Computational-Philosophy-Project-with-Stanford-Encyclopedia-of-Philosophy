Examples of Voting Methods \n\nA quick survey of elections held in different democratic societies\nthroughout the world reveals a wide variety of voting methods. In this\nsection, I discuss some of the key methods that have been analyzed in\nthe voting theory literature. These methods may be of interest because\nthey are widely used (e.g., Plurality Rule or Plurality Rule with\nRunoff) or because they are of theoretical interest (e.g., Dodgson\u2019s\nmethod). \n\nI start with the most widely used method:\n\nPlurality Rule:\n\nEach voter selects one candidate (or none if voters can abstain), and\nthe candidate(s) with the most votes win.\n\n\nPlurality rule (also called First Past the Post) is a very\nsimple method that is widely used despite its many problems. The most\npervasive problem is the fact that plurality rule can elect a\nCondorcet loser. Borda (1784) observed this phenomenon in the 18th\ncentury (see also the example from Section 1). \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n1\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n7\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\n7\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n6\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n\n\nCandidate \\(A\\) is the Condorcet loser (both \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) beat\ncandidate \\(A\\), 13 \u2013 8); however, \\(A\\) is the plurality rule\nwinner (assuming the voters vote for the candidate that they rank first). \nIn fact, the plurality ranking (\\(A\\) is first with 8\nvotes, \\(B\\) is second with 7 votes and \\(C\\) is third with 6\nvotes) reverses the majority ordering \\(C\\mathrel{>_M} B\\mathrel{>_M}\nA\\). See Laslier 2012 for further criticisms of Plurality Rule and\ncomparisons with other voting methods discussed in this article. One\nresponse to the above phenomenon is to require that candidates pass a\ncertain threshold to be declared the winner. \n\nQuota Rule:\n\nSuppose that \\(q\\), called the quota, is any number between 0\nand 1. Each voter selects one candidate (or none if voters can\nabstain), and the winners are the candidates that receive at least\n\\(q \\times \\# V\\) votes, where \\(\\# V\\) is the number of voters. \nMajority Rule is a quota rule with \\(q=0.5\\) (a candidate is the\nstrict or absolute majority winner if that candidate\nreceives strictly more than \\(0.5 \\times \\# V\\) votes). Unanimity\nRule is a quota rule with \\(q=1\\).\n\n\nAn important problem with quota rules is that they do not identify a\nwinner in every election scenario. For instance, in the above election\nscenario, there are no majority winners since none of the candidates\nare ranked first by more than 50% of the voters. \n\nA criticism of both plurality and quota rules is that they severely\nlimit what voters can express about their opinions of the candidates.\nIn the remainder of this section, I discuss voting methods that use\nballots that are more expressive than simply selecting a single\ncandidate. Section 2.1 discusses voting methods that require voters to\nrank the alternatives. Section 2.2 discusses voting methods that\nrequire voters to assign grades to the alternatives (from some fixed\nset of grades). Finally, Section 2.3 discusses two voting methods in\nwhich the voters may have different levels of influence on the group\ndecision. In this article, I focus on voting methods that either are\nfamiliar or help illustrate important ideas. Consult Brams and\nFishburn 2002, Felsenthal 2012, and Nurmi 1987 for discussions of\nvoting methods not covered in this article. \n",
