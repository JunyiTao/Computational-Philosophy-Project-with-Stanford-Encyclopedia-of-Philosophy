    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art || Humboldt\u2019s History of Art and the Study of Nature\n5.1 Humboldt\u2019s History of Art and the Study of Nature\n\nHumboldt begins volume two of Kosmosby drawing on\nSchiller\u2019s distinction between \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and\n\u201csentimental\u201d poetry, as articulated in his 1795\u20136\nwork \u00dcber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung [On\nNa\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry]. Although Humboldt agrees with\nSchiller\u2019s historicization of art as a development from a more\nimmediate or na\u00efve unity of humanity and nature to a more\nabstracted and self-reflexive (sentimental) human consciousness, he is\naware of its limits. It only holds for European art, and says nothing\nabout the human relation to the natural world outside of Europe\n(Kosmos 2: 191; CO 2: 21\u201322). Examining poetry from the\nHindu Vedas, for instance, Humboldt remarks on their vastly different\ninterest in nature, which contrasts not only to Greek and Roman\npoetry, but also to Hebrew poetry. While the Greeks expressed\nlittle\u2014if any\u2014interest in direct depictions of the natural\nworld, Humboldt notes that in certain Vedas, the \u201cmain\nsubject\u2026is the veneration and praise of nature\u201d\n(Kosmos 2: 206; CO 2: 50). Accordingly, a more sensitive\napproach to the history of art would also be comparative.\n\nHumboldt goes on to distinguish crucial moments in the history of art\nand situates them in their larger historic and geographic context. In\nso doing, he connects transformations in artistic depictions of nature\nto transformations in our knowledge about nature. Speaking of the\nemergence of landscape painting in the seventeenth century, for\ninstance, he writes that landscape painting is indebted to the new\ninstruments and tools of observation that became available in the\nseventeenth century, just as these instruments are themselves indebted\nto discoveries in perspective in art in earlier periods\n(Kosmos 2: 228; CO 2: 89). \n",
