The Etymological Section (394e\u2013421c)\n\nHaving arrived at the conjecture that there is a connection between\nthe correctness of names and their etymological meaning, Socrates\nbegins to uncover the etymological meaning of Greek names\u2014and\ndoes not stop until he has spent more than 25 Stephanus pages on\ndiscussing more than 100 names. Remarkably, his etymological analyses\ngradually take on a Heraclitean character; taken together, they\nsuggest that many Greek names encapsulate descriptions that would be\ntrue of the being of their referents if and only if Heraclitus were\nright in claiming that everything is in flux. The Greek name for\nexcellence, ar\u00eat\u00ea, is characterized as an\nabbreviation of the descriptive phrase \u201cthat which always\nflows\u201d (aei rh\u00eaon), for example (415c\u2013d);\nand the name for practical wisdom, phron\u00easis, is said\nto have the meaning \u201cunderstanding of movement and flux\u201d\n(ph\u00f4ras kai rhou no\u00easis) (411d). These and many\ncomparable analyses eventually lead Socrates to the conclusion that\nall (or at least many) Greek names must be built up from a small set\nof basic names that refer to movements and processes\u2014such as,\ne.g., the names ion, rhe\u00f4n, and doun.\nThis result, in turn, prompts him to augment his naturalist theory by\ninvestigating the correctness of these basic names.\n\nInsofar as the etymological section provides an incentive to complete\nthe naturalist theory of correctness, it has a clear dialectical\nfunction. But given its extraordinary length, this can hardly be its\nonly function. How else does the etymological section contribute to\nSocrates\u2019 inquiry, then? Three (non-exclusive) answers to this\nquestion suggest themselves:\n\nThe etymological section might shine a light on the prospects and\nproblems of etymological research.\nThe etymological section might make a point about the correctness\nof names.\nThe etymological section might draw attention to the ontological\nchallenge of Heracliteanism.\n\n\nThe present section zooms in on these possible answers.\n",
