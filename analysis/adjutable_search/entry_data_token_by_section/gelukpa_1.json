    "main_text": "Conventional Truth and the Consequence School\n2. Conventional Truth and the Consequence School\n\nGeluk philosophers take the radically anti-foundationalist,\nantirealist Consequence School (Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka),\ngrounded in the texts of the Indian Buddhist philosophers\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Candrak\u012brti, to be the most sophisticated\nschool of Buddhist philosophy. The Consequence School gets its name\nfrom the fact that it relies on reductio argument to\ndemonstrate emptiness, in contrast to independent formal arguments.\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, no independent formal argument can prove the\nemptiness of phenomena to those not already convinced of that fact\nbecause these arguments presuppose a common understanding of the terms\nused. That is, this kind of formal argument presumes that a subject\nmatter is objective or given and is understood in the same way by all\nparties to the debate, and he follows Candrak\u012brti in arguing that\nthis cannot be the case when an antirealist (who understands\nemptiness) and a realist (who lacks an understanding of emptiness)\nengage in dialogue (Changkya in Cozort 1998, 451). This is because a\nproponent of the Consequence School consents to no such given,\nobjective facts.\n\nBy invoking consensus as the mark of (conventional) reality, the Geluk\nschool\u2019s coherence theory of truth anticipates some of the\ninsights of the later Wittgenstein (see Thurman 1980). There are no\nfoundations in the Geluk tradition, neither ultimate nor conventional;\nthere is only transactional usage\u2014\u201cwhat is renowned in the\nworld.\u201d Thus, unlike some other Middle Way philosophies, like\nthe Autonomy School (sv\u0101tantrika), the distinction\nbetween \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d relative\ntruth itself depends upon our epistemic conventions and practices, not\non a world of independent truthmakers. \u201cWhat works\u201d is the\ncriterion; that is, what conforms to the ways of the world is a\nconventional truth in the way that a game works when you subscribe to\nits rules. Any further notion of a \u201ccorrect\u201d relative\nimplicates a foundation, an essentialist presumption about the way\nthings are (Changkya 1998, 321; B\u00f6tr\u00fcl 2011, 141).\nTherefore, the measure of what is correct is simply what conforms to\nthe world rather than based on any other warrant that would serve as a\ndeeper structure or more fundamental layer of reality beyond what is\nsimply conventional (Cozort 1998, 52).\n\nTsongkhapa identifies three criteria for conventional truth. A\nconventional truth is what (1) is acknowledged by a conventional\nepistemic instrument, (2) is not undermined by another conventional\nepistemic instrument, and (3) is not undermined by an analysis of its\nultimate nature (Tsongkhapa 2000, 627). The third criterion\nunderscores an important point in Gelukpa philosophy: that an\nobject\u2019s emptiness of intrinsic existence (its ultimate status)\ndoes not undermine its status as a conventional truth. Whether or not\nthis is successful, or if this is even possible, is a strongly debated\nphilosophical question. The first two criteria reflect the commitment\nthat what counts as true or real depends upon our epistemic resources,\nwhich themselves are mutually supportive, and which both support and\nare supported by the entities they reveal, as well as the fact that\nthere is a difference between being correct and incorrect regarding\nconventional truth. Because of this commitment to a robust sense of\nconventional truth, their rivals in Tibet have charged the Geluk\ninterpretation of the Middle Way with being realist (about the\nconventional truth) and nihilist (about the ultimate truth), or even\nan incoherent mixture\u2014full of contradictions\u2014of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s foundationalist epistemology with\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s antirealist ontology. The Geluk philosophy\ncontinues to be engaged in the debate about the unique role that\nepistemology plays within the antifoundationalist Consequence School\n(The Yakherds, 2021).\n\nTsongkhapa and his Geluk followers insist is that nothing exists on\nits own even conventionally; that interdependence is universal\n(Tsongkhapa 1988, 585). Therefore, we cannot ground conventions in any\ndeeper foundation. The fact that there is nothing but groundless\nconventions\u2014all the way up and all the way down\u2014is another\nway of seeing why the ultimate and the conventional are not distinct\nfrom one another; the two truths are none other than two aspects of\nthe same thing.\n\nGeluk philosophers argue that this explains the crucial distinction\nbetween the Middle Way (Madhyamaka) and the Mind-Only (Cittam\u0101tra\nor Yog\u0101c\u0101ra) schools of Buddhist philosophy which, on their\nreading, assigns the mind a privileged ontological status as the truly\nexistent ground of an illusory external world. Rather than claim that\nthe mind is independently real in contrast to unreal external objects,\nlike a subjective idealist, Geluk theorists argue that a proponent of\nthe Middle Way explicitly affirms the interdependency of minds and\nobjects. K\u00fcnzang S\u00f6nam (1823\u20131905), explains\nTsongkhapa\u2019s position as the thesis that minds and external\nobjects are equally conventionally existent and equally ultimately\nnonexistent, and so of exactly the same ontological and\nepistemological status. He goes on to show how external objects are\naccepted conventionally in the Consequence School because the\ncoextensive presence and absence of objects and cognitions undermines\nthe claim that even conventionally there are no external objects. That\nis, when there are external objects, there are internal cognitions,\nand when there are internal cognitions, there are external objects;\ncognitions and objects are paired and thus rise and fall together. He\nreiterates this point by saying that not only does no conventional\nanalysis negate external objects, but that conventional analysis\nundermines the absence of externality (K\u00fcnzang 2007, 706\u2013707).\nOne might think that since Geluk philosophers take the existence of\nthe external world to be affirmed in the Consequence School, that they\nare committed to external realism, and indeed some of their critics\nhave accused them of this (The Yakherds 2021). But the affirmation of\nthe existence of the external world is simply an affirmation of its\nconventional reality, and of its knowability using conventional\nepistemic instruments. So, while Geluk philosophers are not idealists,\nthey are certainly not external realists, either.\n\nTsongkhapa outlined three types of \u201cintrinsic\ncharacteristic\u201d (rang mtshan) that convey important\nfeatures of the different metaphysical systems of the Abhidharma,\nDharmak\u012brtian epistemology, and the Consequence School,\nrespectively. Through this threefold distinction he sets up his\npresentation of what uniquely defines the ultimate truth, and by\nimplication, the conventional truth, in the Consequence School, while\nincorporating a range of metaphysical systems into his comprehensive\ninterpretative scheme. Firstly, Tsongkhapa says that an\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d is distinguished from a\n\u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d in the Abhidharma context of\nmetaphysics, where an intrinsic characteristic distinguishes a\nparticular trope from a general type. That is to say, an intrinsic\ncharacteristic marks a contrast that delineates, for instance, the\nheat of fire (intrinsic characteristic) from its being a member of the\nlarger class of material form (general characteristic). Tsongkhapa\nconveys another meaning of \u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d\nfound in Dharmak\u012brtian epistemology that distinguishes the\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d that is the unique particular\nfrom that which is an universal. In contrast to the second meaning of\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d\u2014which marks a contrast of\na more real kind of entity (a particular) from another, less\nsubstantially real counterpart (an universal)\u2014the third meaning\nof \u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d represents a subtle kind of\nreification that is a problem. This third type of intrinsic\ncharacteristic is presupposed by distorted cognitions that impute\nthings to have independent existence. This kind of intrinsic\ncharacteristic, as the imputation of things existing on their own,\neven conventionally, is what Tsongkhapa describes as the subtle\nreification that is uniquely eliminated in the philosophical system of\nthe Consequence School (Tsongkhapa 2008, 425\u2013426).\n\nGeluk philosophers emphasize the interdependence \u2014 the\nrelational nature of things (the internal and external, and the\nultimate and conventional). Indeed, the argument for universal\nemptiness from the premise of interdependence is often called\n\u201cthe king of arguments.\u201d K\u00fcnzang S\u00f6nam says that\nit is \u201cthe king\u201d because it can simultaneously induce\ncertainty in emptiness and appearance from the side of emptiness;\nthere are no other Middle Way arguments that do this. That is,\ndemonstrating that the objects we encounter are (mere) appearance\neliminates the reification of (intrinsic) existence, while showing\nthat emptiness is the emptiness of intrinsic existence\u2014as\nopposed to empirical existence\u2014eliminates the misconception that\nthings are utterly nonexistent. The fact that the interdependent world\nexists (dependently, without intrinsic existence) reveals how the\nconventional and ultimate truths are paired in this philosophy. There\nis no hierarchy of a transcendent, ultimate world contrasted with the\nimmanent world of conventions that lacks any value. Rather, the\nontological unity of the two truths in the Consequence School erases\nthis dichotomy, and arguably erases the dichotomy of the domains of\nontology and ethics, too. That is, the system of this antirealist\n\u201cground\u201d of emptiness and interdependence arguably\nsupports an ethical system in a more seamless way than an instrumental\nnotion of ethics can, with its associated notion of a means or\n\u201cpath\u201d that results in a qualitatively different,\ntranscendent goal. Indeed, the Geluk (lit. \u201cway of\nvirtue\u201d) appeals to this ethical feature in its name.\n",
