    "main_text": "Quinean Epistemology || Other aspects of epistemology\n4.4 Other aspects of epistemology\n\nQuine also has things to say on more familiar epistemological themes.\nIn some cases he indicates how they can be integrated into his\napproach; thus he suggests that we can (albeit unrealistically)\nschematize the testing of a scientific theory by thinking of ourselves\nas deriving observation categoricals which can then be directly tested\nagainst observation sentences. In other cases he is content to adopt\nmore or less unchanged the account given by earlier authors, as in his\nlist of the virtues of a theory (see 1990a, 20). Our account above has\nstressed the most novel parts of his epistemology.\n\nOne issue left unaddressed above is the question whether Quine\u2019s\nnaturalized version of epistemology is normative. Some commentators\nhave claimed that it is not, and that this is a serious defect (see\nKim, 1988). Others claim that naturalized epistemology is normative\n(see Gregory, 2008). Quine himself has weighed in, saying that critics\n\u2018are wrong in protesting that the normative element\u2026goes\nby the board\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19). He cites the \u2018finding of\nnatural science\u2026that our information about the world comes only\nthrough impacts on our sensory receptors\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19) as\nbeing normative, \u2018warning us against telepaths and\nsoothsayers\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19). More generally, naturalized\nepistemology is concerned with \u2018the whole strategy of rational\nconjecture in the framing of scientific hypotheses\u2019 (Quine\n1990a, 20).\n\nNaturalized epistemology is thus certainly normative in this sense: it\ntells us that in drawing up scientific theories we should\nrely on the evidence of the senses rather than on soothsayers; that we\nshould aim at simple theories, and so on. In telling us these\nthings, however, it relies on what we already know: it deploys some\nparts of our science to guide attempts in other areas. It does not\ntake a normative attitude towards science as a whole, criticizing or\njustifying it by wholly external, non-scientific standards. That would\nrequire a wholly extra-scientific position, an idea which Quine\nderogates as \u2018First Philosophy\u2019 (e.g. Quine 1981, 67). The\nrejection of any such idea is one way of phrasing the naturalism he\nadvocates.\n",
