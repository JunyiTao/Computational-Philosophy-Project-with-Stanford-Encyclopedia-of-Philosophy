    "main_text": "Denying Change\n3. Denying Change\n\n\nIt is on the face of it extremely implausible to deny change, but\nextreme implausibility has not always deterred philosophers. The\nEleatics (C5th BCE), particularly Parmenides, appear to have been the\nfirst to do so. Parmenides maintained that whatever one speaks about\nor thinks about must in some sense exist; if it did not exist then it\nis nothing, so one would be speaking or thinking about nothing, which\nwould be empty. From this thesis, it is deduced that the existing\nthing cannot have come into existence, because to say that it could\nwould be to speak of a time when it did not exist. By similar\nreasoning, existing things are eternal because they cannot go out of\nexistence. It is now a small step to conclude that change is an\nillusion, on the grounds that a change in a thing implies that there\nwas a time when the thing-as-changed did not exist. However, this\nargument is not persuasive: the premiss that the non-existent cannot\nbe thought or spoken about is dubious.\n\n\nParmenides\u2019 disciples Melissus and Zeno developed this\ntheme. Melissus argued that motion implies empty space to move into,\nbut empty space is a nothing and so cannot exist, so that motion is\nimpossible since it implies a contradiction. This argument requires\nthe dubious premisses (1) that empty space is a nothing (which is\ndenied by realists from Newton to Nerlich), and (2) that motion would\nhave to be change relative to space. Even those who have held that\nempty space is a nothing (relationists from Leibniz to Mach and\nonward) have not generally denied motion, proposing instead that\nmotion of a thing is change in the spatial relations between that\nthing and other things.\n\n\nZeno\u2019s brilliant paradoxes are generally accounted as attempts to\ndefend Parmenides. We will not look at these in detail, but his\nparadox of the arrow is relevant to what follows. This is the argument\nthat an arrow in flight could not really be moving because at any\ngiven instant it would be at a place identical with itself (and not\nanother place); something at just one (self-identical) place could not\nbe described as moving, and an arrow which is motionless at every\ninstant in a temporal interval must be motionless throughout the\ninterval. Discussion of this subtle argument is deferred until\ndiscussion in a later section of Graham Priest\u2019s position, which turns\non similar premisses.\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s well-known argument (1908) that time is unreal applies\nequally to the unreality of (temporal) change it seems. McTaggart\ndistinguished between two ways of attributing temporal\ncharacteristics to events. The \\(A\\)-series of events is given\nby the descriptions \u201cpast,\u201d \u201cpresent\u201d and\n\u201cfuture,\u201d while the \\(B\\)-series is strictly in terms\nof the relational concepts \u201cearlier,\u201d\n\u201csimultaneous\u201d and \u201clater.\u201d Now the\n\\(B\\)-series is insufficient to define change, because\n\\(B\\)-series relations apply unchangingly if they apply at all;\nwhatever is earlier than something is always earlier than\nit. Moreover, the \\(B\\)-series presupposes the \\(A\\)-series\nsince if \\(X\\) precedes \\(Y\\) then there must be a time\nwhen \\(X\\) is past and \\(Y\\) present. This step in the\nargument is not at all absurd: the discovery of spacetime, the\nrelativistic realisation of the \\(B\\)-series, has impelled many\nfrom Minkowski on to describe it as a \u201cstatic\u201d conception\nof time. A genuinely dynamic conception of change would thus need to\nhave things coming into and going out of existence with the passage\nof time, whereas spacetime invites quantification over it all\n\u201cat once\u201d as it were.\n\n\nThus according to McTaggart the source of time and change must be\nfound in the \\(A\\)-series. But the \\(A\\)-series implies a\nvicious regress. Any event must have all three properties, pastness,\npresentness and futurity, but this is a contradiction. The only way\nout of the contradiction is to say that the event is past, present\nand future at different times; but the same question arises about the\ntemporal instants themselves, which would force us to appeal to a\nfurther time series to avoid the contradiction.\n\n\nWhatever we make of this argument, and much has been written about it,\nit highlights the baffling nature of the apparent passage of time. In \nparticular, if temporal flux is denied then at the least an explanation \nof its intuitive naturalness is mandatory. For a close analysis, see the \nentry Savitt (2006) in this Encyclopedia. \n \n\nHowever, one thing can be said about all the above denials of change:\nthey all argue against change on the ground that it implies a\ncontradiction. But the assumption of the consistency of change has\nbeen denied by a number of influential figures, as we will see.\n",
