    "main_text": "\n\nNaturalism in epistemology, as elsewhere, has a long history. But it\nis only relatively recently that it has gone by just that name and\nreceived so much focused attention. As in other areas of philosophy,\nquestions concerning naturalism\u2019s merits are central to recent\nepistemological debate. While many epistemological theories and\npositions are agreed by all to exemplify, or to run counter to,\nnaturalistic epistemology (NE), it is difficult to characterize\nprecisely, since \u201cnaturalism\u201d is used to refer to a range\nof positions, commitments, and so on. NE, then, is more a movement or\ngeneral approach to epistemological theorizing than it is some\nsubstantive thesis (/theses). Broadly speaking, however, proponents of\nNE take the attitude that there should be a close connection between\nphilosophical investigation\u2014here, of such things as knowledge,\njustification, rationality, etc.\u2014and empirical\n(\u201cnatural\u201d) science. Beyond that, and as detailed below,\nproponents of NE diverge in how they conceive of that close\nconnection, exactly\u2014whether and to what extent they advocate use\nof empirical methods, or insist upon the relevance of the\nresults of certain areas of empirical study, or invoke\ncertain recognized \u201cnatural\u201d properties,\nrelations, and so on, in their accounts of certain central\nepistemic phenomena. So too, proponents of NE differ in which\nscience(s) they take to be relevant to epistemological\ntheory\u2014whether it is psychology and/or cognitive science,\nethology, cultural studies, evolutionary theory, social theory, or\nsome other area of empirical investigation.\n\nNE can also be understood as an attempt to redress the perceived\nshortcomings of what\u2019s typically termed \u201ctraditional\nepistemology\u201d\n (TE).[1]\n Here too, different naturalists are motivated by different concerns.\nTE is variously seen as unduly and unprofitably concerned with\nskeptical worries; as too much the product of \u201carmchair\u201d\n(perhaps a priori, and maybe ultimately idiosyncratic)\ntheorizing; as too geared towards the study of \u201cour\nconcepts\u201d of various states and properties and not concerned\nenough with the epistemological phenomena themselves; as operating\nwithout attention to the conditions in which knowledge (for example)\nis actually produced and/or shared, the limits, contours and history\nof actual human cognition, and so on. \n\nGiven that the differences amongst naturalistic theories make it\ndifficult to give a precise characterization of NE, it is not\nsurprising that the division between NE and TE is itself something of\nan idealization. Of course, just as there are clear instances where a\ntheory belongs on one or the other side of this divide, there\nare some real differences between NE and TE broadly\nunderstood. Nonetheless, many specific epistemological theories\nincorporate elements of each, and so any neat bifurcation of extant\nepistemologies into NE and TE is bound to sacrifice accuracy for\nprecision.\n\nThe discussion to follow describes some of the dominant claims,\ncommitments, and forms that naturalistic epistemology, so understood,\nhas taken, and specific examples of such naturalistic views. As well,\nboth the principal motivations for and the major objections to NE will\nbe discussed. Finally (and, in some cases, along the way), we will\nbriefly consider the relation between NE and some other recent and\nimportant subjects, positions, and developments\u2014some of them\njust as controversial as NE itself. These include externalism,\nexperimental philosophy, social epistemology, feminist epistemology,\nevolutionary epistemology, and debates about the nature of (epistemic)\nrationality.\n",
