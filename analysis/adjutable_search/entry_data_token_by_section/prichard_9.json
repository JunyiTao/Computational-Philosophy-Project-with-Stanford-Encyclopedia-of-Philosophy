    "main_text": "Significant Issues on Which Prichard Changed His Mind || The nature of obligation, or of obligatedness\n6.4 The content of a moral principle\n\nIn his earliest work Prichard supposes that principles specify\ndistinct obligations, e.g. those of telling the truth, educating\none\u2019s children, serving one\u2019s country. It did not take him\nlong to see that, so understood, pretty well any collection of\nprinciples is going to lead to contradiction and incoherence. He then\nmoved to what looks like a form of what we now know best as\nRoss\u2019s theory of prima facie duties. On this understanding, a\nprinciple specifies what Prichard calls a \u2018claim\u2019 on us,\nfor example that we serve our country \u2013 but all such claims can\nbe defeated by more pressing claims to do something else, such as care\nfor our aging mother. Prichard\u2019s version seems to differ from\nRoss\u2019s, however, at least if we are to trust a letter he wrote\nto Ross in 1932 (to be found in MacAdam, 286\u20137). Ross thinks\nthat duty proper, as he calls it, is a quite different sort of thing\nfrom a prima facie duty; the notion of \u2018duty\u2019 in\n\u2018prima facie duty\u2019 is a different notion from that in\n\u2018duty proper\u2019. Prichard, by contrast, thinks of this as\nincoherent, and opts instead for the view that, expressed in terms of\n\u2018ought\u2019, maintains that, faced with a moral difficulty,\nthere will be different actions each of which in some respect I ought\nto do (this is the prima facie ought) and of those one will be the\naction which I most ought to do, my duty proper. On this picture there\nis no great divide between the \u2018ought\u2019 of duty proper and\nthe \u2018ought\u2019 of prima facie duty.\n",
