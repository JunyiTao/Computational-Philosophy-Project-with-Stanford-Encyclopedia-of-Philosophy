    "main_text": "Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing || Politeness and civility\n2.4 Politeness and civility\n\nAs a remedy for some of the problems that women and other arguers\nface, some feminists champion politeness, while others stress that\nexpecting etiquette to address abuses of power belies the realities of\nwomen and others who are socially marginalized. Norms of politeness\nfunction to minimize conflict and so can hold people in subordinate\npositions (Mayo 2001). Like \u201cideal theory\u201d in philosophy\n(Mills 2005), politeness can exacerbate the oppression it\nignores\u2014in this case, discursive marginalization.\n\nGovier argues that the discursive norm of politeness limits the\nproblem of overt interpersonal aggression in arguing (1999). Respect\nfor other people and careful consideration of their views ought to be\npart of persuasion, including rational persuasion, which\nscholars often take to be the central or even the sole purpose for\narguing (1999: 58\u201359). On this view, aggressive styles of\ncommunication or \u201cancillary adversariality\u201d can be\ndismissed as simple rudeness or hostility. These ought not to be\ntolerated in any context and may not impact much on the beliefs and\nattitudes of the audience (Govier 1999; Miller 1995).\n\nThe main difficulty with this ideal arises because norms of politeness\ntend to be gendered in ways that undermine women\u2019s authority\nwhen people argue, affirming power and status for men but not for\nwomen. This dynamic can receive reinforcement when women adopt\ncooperative strategies that play into norms of\n\u201cfemininity\u201d, according to Burrow (2010) and Hundleby\n(2013a). Securing cooperation and connection with other people\nprovides the very purpose for politeness. Both \u201cmasculine\u201d\nand \u201cfeminine\u201d forms of politeness can reflect this\npurpose. However, the gendered dynamics of politeness in many cultures\nmay entail that cooperative or collaborative argumentation serves\nwomen poorly. It contributes to their subordination and perhaps also\nthe subordination of other people with marginalized social identities.\nFor women, cooperating and connecting with others may entail deferring\none\u2019s interests and promoting dialogue through hedging,\nquestioning intonation, and use of tag questions, for example,\n\u201cYou know?\u201d \u201cRight?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you\nthink?\u201d These strategies generally imply powerlessness or\nconflict avoidance. In contrast, masculine norms of polite connection\nfacilitate shared competition and encourage joint autonomy along with\nregard for each other\u2019s needs (Burrow 2010).\n\nBurrow argues that women often have no easy options for conforming\nwith the etiquette demands that reinforce power differences among\nspeakers. Deferential styles of dialogue are part of most subordinate\npositions and, for women, other aspects of social rank do not mitigate\nthis much. Therefore, to negotiate politeness and to argue\neffectively, women need complex strategies tailored to their\ncircumstances (2010).\n\nHenning (2021) observes that what many feminist and\nnot-specifically-feminist argumentation theorists count as rudeness\nmay actually belong to politeness strategies in African-American\nVernacular English (AAVE). In particular, \u201csignifying\u201d or\n\u201csignification\u201d within AAVE \u201cutilizes exaggeration,\nirony, and indirection to partake in coded messages, riddled with\ninsults\u201d. To refuse to participate in signification is rude and\npoliteness demands participation in speech that on the surface\nsuggests disrespect. In some cultures, arguing not only performs\npro-social functions, it provides such an important form of\nsociability that superficial or even insincere arguing may be an\nessential part of interaction and social bonding (Schiffrin 1984).\n\nBecause of the range of conflicting politeness strategies across\ndifferent communities, it may serve better to seek an alternative to\npoliteness as a norm and that may lie in an inclusive practice and\nethic of civility in dialogue. Civility tends to be understood as\ndeeper than politeness, sometimes considered itself to be a virtue or\nas involving such virtues as respect for other people (Calhoun 2000:\n253; Bone et al. 2008; Laverty 2009; Reiheld 2013). Respecting others\nrequires trying to understand them \u201cas they wish to be known and\nunderstood\u201d in the cooperative argumentation model developed by\nMakau and Marty (2013: 69). Others suggest that civil respect be\nparsed in ethical frameworks, such as deontology or consequentialism,\nbecause simple deference to existing social standards may be\noppressive in assigning more restrictive practices to certain groups\nof people. Practices of respect may involve people\u2019s adherence\nto oppressive social roles, just as they do for politeness, if common\npractice determines them. Ethically rich interpretations of civility\nmust be shared among interlocutors in order that civility can fulfill\nits function to regulate disagreement. Such shared norms of civility\nnot only aid the articulation of understandings that prejudiced and\noppressive behavior are intolerable, they also aid people\u2019s\nability to challenge broader social problems (Calhoun 2000).\n\nCivility may be distinguished from other virtues as \u201can\nessentially communicative form of moral conduct\u201d, a display and\nexpression of how one regards others (Calhoun 2000: 260). However,\nthis virtue has limits and incivility can also perform important\nargumentative functions. Uncivil communication can create space for\nnew forms of meaning and value:\n\n\nThe disruption entailed by incivility provides room for concerted\nreconstruction of social practices, identities, and spaces. (Mayo\n2001: 79)\n\n\nUncivil communication and arguing may even be necessary for some\nsocial change (Lozano-Reich & Cloud 2009: 223\u2013224). Because\ncertain practices viewed as \u201ccivil\u201d may depoliticize\ndisagreement, incivility that highlights these political problems can\nprove to be as necessary as civility is to democratic decision-making\n(Mayo 2001). Which moral and political demands justify incivility\nremains, however, a complicated question that demands analysis of the\ndiscursive norms in operation in a particular context for their\nability to sustain interpersonal respect.\n",
