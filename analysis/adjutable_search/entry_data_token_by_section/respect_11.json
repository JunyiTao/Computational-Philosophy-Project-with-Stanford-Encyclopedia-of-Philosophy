    "main_text": "Self-Respect || Treatment of self-respect in moral and political philosophy\n5. Conclusion\n\nEveryday discourse and practices insist that respect and self-respect\nare personally, socially, politically, and morally important, and\nphilosophical discussions of the concepts bear this out. Their roles\nin our lives as individuals, as people living in complex relations\nwith other people and surrounded by a plethora of other beings and\nthings on which our attitudes and actions have tremendous effects,\ncannot, as these discussions reveal, be taken lightly. The discussions\nthus far shed light on the nature and significance of the various\nforms of respect and self-respect and their positions in a nexus of\nprofoundly important but philosophically challenging and contestable\nconcepts. These discussions also reveal that more work remains to be\ndone in clarifying these attitudes and their places among and\nimplications for our concepts and our lives.\n",
