    "main_text": "Power as Empowerment\n4. Power as Empowerment\n\nUp to this point, this entry has focused on power understood in terms\nof an oppressive or unjust power-over relationship. I have used the\nterm \u201cdomination\u201d to refer to such relationships, though\nsome of the theorists discussed above prefer the terms\n\u201coppression\u201d or \u201csubjection,\u201d and others refer\nto this phenomenon simply as \u201cpower.\u201d However, a\nsignificant strand of feminist theorizing of power starts with the\ncontention that the conception of power as power-over, domination, or\ncontrol is implicitly masculinist. In order to avoid such masculinist\nconnotations, many feminists from a variety of theoretical backgrounds\nhave argued for a reconceptualization of power as a capacity or\nability, specifically, the capacity to empower or transform oneself\nand others. Thus, these feminists have tended to understood power not\nas power-over but as power-to. Wartenberg (1990) argues that this\nfeminist understanding of power, which he calls transformative power,\nis actually a type of power-over, albeit one that is distinct from\ndomination because it aims at empowering those over whom it is\nexercised. However, most of the feminists who embrace this\ntransformative or empowerment-based conception of power explicitly\ndefine it as an ability or capacity and present it as an alternative\nto putatively masculine notions of power-over. Thus, in what follows,\nI will follow their usage rather than Wartenberg\u2019s.\n\nFor example, Jean Baker Miller claims that \u201cwomen\u2019s\nexamination of power\u2026can bring new understanding to the whole\nconcept of power\u201d (Miller 1992, 241). Miller rejects the\ndefinition of power as domination; instead, she defines it as\n\u201cthe capacity to produce a change \u2013 that is, to move\nanything from point A or state A to point B or state B\u201d (Miller\n1992, 241). Miller suggests that power understood as domination is\nparticularly masculine; from women\u2019s perspective, power is\nunderstood differently: \u201cthere is enormous validity in\nwomen\u2019s not wanting to use power as it is presently conceived\nand used. Rather, women may want to be powerful in ways that\nsimultaneously enhance, rather than diminish, the power of\nothers\u201d (Miller 1992, 247\u2013248).\n\nSimilarly, Virginia Held argues against the masculinist conception of\npower as \u201cthe power to cause others to submit to one\u2019s\nwill, the power that led men to seek hierarchical control\nand\u2026contractual constraints\u201d (Held 1993, 136). Held views\nwomen\u2019s unique experiences as mothers and caregivers as the\nbasis for new insights into power; as she puts it, \u201cthe capacity\nto give birth and to nurture and empower could be the basis for new\nand more humanly promising conceptions than the ones that now prevail\nof power, empowerment, and growth\u201d (Held 1993, 137). According\nto Held, \u201cthe power of a mothering person to empower others, to\nfoster transformative growth, is a different sort of power from that\nof a stronger sword or a dominant will\u201d (Held 1993, 209). On\nHeld\u2019s view, a feminist analysis of society and politics leads\nto an understanding of power as the capacity to transform and empower\noneself and others.\n\nThis conception of power as transformative and empowering is also a\nprominent theme in lesbian feminism and ecofeminism. For example,\nSarah Lucia Hoagland is critical of the masculine conception of power\nwith its focus on \u201cstate authority, police and armed forces,\ncontrol of economic resources, control of technology, and hierarchy\nand chain of command\u201d (Hoagland 1988, 114). Instead, Hoagland\ndefines power as \u201cpower-from-within\u201d which she understands\nas \u201cthe power of ability, of choice and engagement. It is\ncreative; and hence it is an affecting and transforming power but not\na controlling power\u201d (Hoagland 1988, 118). Similarly, Starhawk\nclaims that she is \u201con the side of the power that emerges from\nwithin, that is inherent in us as the power to grow is inherent in the\nseed\u201d (Starhawk 1987, 8). For both Hoagland and Starhawk,\npower-from-within is a positive, life-affirming, and empowering force\nthat stands in stark contrast to power understood as domination,\ncontrol or imposing one\u2019s will on another.\n\nA similar understanding of power can also be found in the work of the\nprominent French feminists Luce Irigaray and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\nCixous. Irigaray, for example, urges feminists to question the\ndefinition of power in phallocratic cultures, for if feminists\n\u201caim simply for a change in the distribution of power, leaving\nintact the power structure itself, then they are resubjecting\nthemselves, deliberately or not, to a phallocratic order\u201d\n(Irigaray 1985, 81), that is, to a discursive and cultural order that\nprivileges the masculine, represented by the phallus. If we wish to\nsubvert the phallocratic order, according to Irigaray, we will have to\nreject \u201ca definition of power of the masculine type\u201d\n(Irigaray 1985, 81). Some feminists interpret Irigaray\u2019s work on\nsexual difference as suggesting an alternative conception of power as\ntransformative, a conception that is grounded in a specifically\nfeminine economy (see Irigaray 1981 and Kuykendall 1983). Similarly,\nCixous claims that \u201cles pouvoirs de la femme\u201d do not\nconsist in mastering or exercising power over others, but instead are\na form of \u201cpower over oneself\u201d (Cixous 1977,\n483\u201384).\n\nAlong similar lines, Nancy Hartsock refers to the understanding of\npower \u201cas energy and competence rather than dominance\u201d as\n\u201cthe feminist theory of power\u201d (Hartsock 1983, 224).\nHartsock argues that precursors of this theory can be found in the\nwork of some women who did not consider themselves to be feminists\n\u2013 most notably, Hannah Arendt, whose rejection of the\ncommand-obedience model of power and definition of \u2018power\u2019\nas \u201cthe human ability not just to act but to act in\nconcert\u201d overlaps significantly with the feminist conception of\npower as empowerment (1970, 44). Arendt\u2019s definition of\n\u2018power\u2019 brings out another aspect of the definition of\n\u2018power\u2019 as empowerment because of her focus on community\nor collective empowerment (on the relationship between power and\ncommunity, see Hartsock 1983, 1996). This aspect of empowerment is\nevident in Mary Parker Follett\u2019s distinction between power-over\nand power-with; for Follett, power-with is a collective ability that\nis a function of relationships of reciprocity between members of a\ngroup (Follett 1942). Hartsock finds it significant that the theme of\npower as capacity or empowerment has been so prominent in the work of\nwomen who have written about power. In her view, this points in the\ndirection of a feminist standpoint that \u201cshould allow us to\nunderstand why the masculine community constructed\u2026power, as\ndomination, repression, and death, and why women\u2019s accounts of\npower differ in specific and systematic ways from those put forward by\nmen\u2026.such a standpoint might allow us to put forward an\nunderstanding of power that points in more liberatory\ndirections\u201d (Hartsock 1983, 226).\n\nThe notion of empowerment has also been taken up widely by advocates\nof so-called \u201cpower feminism.\u201d A reaction against a\nperceived over-emphasis on women\u2019s victimization and oppression\nin feminism of the 1980s, power feminism emerged in the 1990s in the\nwritings of feminists such as Camille Paglia, Katie Roiphe, Christina\nHoff Sommers, and Naomi Wolf. Although this movement has had more\ninfluence in mainstream media and culture than in academia \u2013\nindeed, in many ways it can be read as a critique of academic feminism\n\u2013 it has also sparked scholarly debate. As Mary Caputi argues in\nher book Feminism and Power: The Need for Critical Theory\n(2013), power feminists reject not only the excessive focus on\nwomen\u2019s victimization but also the claim, made by earlier\nempowerment theorists, that women are \u201csensitive creatures given\nmore to a caring, interconnected web of human relationships than to\nthe rugged individualism espoused by men\u201d (Caputi 2013, 4). In\ncontrast, power feminists endorse a more individualistic,\nself-assertive, even aggressive conception of empowerment, one that\ntends to define empowerment in terms of individual choice with little\nconcern for the contexts within which choices are made or the options\nfrom which women are able to choose. Caputi argues that power feminism\nrelies on and mimetically reproduces a problematically masculinist\nconception of power, one \u201centhralled by the display of\n\u2018power over\u2019 rather than \u2018power\nwith\u2019\u2026\u201d (Caputi 2013, xv). As she puts it:\n\u201cfeminism must query the uncritical endorsement of an\nempowerment aligned with a masculinist will to power, and disown the\ntough, sassy, self-assured but unthinking\n\u2018feminist\u2019\u201d (Caputi 2013, 17). Because of its\ntendency to mimic an individualistic, sovereign, and masculinist\nconception of power over, power feminism, according to Caputi,\n\u201cdoes little, if anything, to rethink our conception of\npower\u201d (Caputi 2013, 89). In order to prompt such a rethinking,\nCaputi turns to the resources of the early Frankfurt School of\ncritical theory and to the work of Jacques Derrida.\n\nSerene Khader\u2019s Adaptive Preferences and Women\u2019s\nEmpowerment offers another rethinking of empowerment in feminist\ntheory. Focusing on empowerment in the context of international\ndevelopment practice, Khader develops a deliberative perfectionist\naccount of adaptive preferences. Rather than defining adaptive\npreferences in terms of autonomy deficits, Khader defines them as\npreferences \u201cinconsistent with basic flourishing\u2026that are\nformed under conditions nonconductive to basic flourishing and\u2026that\nwe believe people might be persuaded to transform upon normative\nscrutiny of their preferences and exposure to conditions more\nconducive to flourishing\u201d (Khader 2011, 42). The perfectionism\nin her account leads her to emphasize the distinction between merely\nadaptive preferences \u2013 those formed through adaptation to existing\nsocial conditions \u2013 and what she calls \u201cinappropriately\nadaptive preferences\u201d (IAPs) \u2013 preferences that are\nadaptive to bad or oppressive social conditions and that are harmful\nto those who adopt them (52\u201353). She also insists that IAPs are most\noften selective rather than global self-entitlement deficits (109),\nwhich means that they impact individuals\u2019 sense of their own\nworth or entitlement to certain goods not globally but rather in\nparticular domains and contexts and in relation to certain specific\nindividuals or groups. This allows her to acknowledge the\npsychological effects of oppression working through the mechanism of\nIAPs without denying the possibility of agency on the part of the\noppressed.\n\nKhader draws on her deliberative perfectionist account of IAPs to\ndiagnose and move beyond certain controversies over the notion of\nempowerment that have emerged in feminist development practice and\ntheorizing. As the concept of women\u2019s empowerment has become\ncentral to international development practice, feminists have raised\nconcerns about the ideological effects of this shift. While\nacknowledging that the language of empowerment in development practice\ncan have ideological effects, Khader addresses these concerns by\nproviding a clearer conception of empowerment than the one implicit in\nthe development literature and emphasizing what she understands as the\nnormative core of this concept, its relation to human flourishing. She\ndefines empowerment as the \u201cprocess of overcoming one or\nmany IAPs through processes that enhance some element of a\nperson\u2019s concept of self-entitlement and increase her capacity\nto pursue her own flourishing\u201d (Khader 2011, 176). This\ndefinition of empowerment enables her to rethink certain dilemmas of\nempowerment that have emerged in development theory and practices. For\nexample, many development practitioners define empowerment in terms of\nchoice, and then struggle to make sense of apparently\nself-subordinating choices. If choice equals empowerment, then does\nthis mean that the choice to subordinate or disempower oneself is an\ninstance of empowerment? Khader\u2019s finely grained analysis\nprovides an elegant way out of this dilemma by emphasizing the\nconditions under which choices are made and the tradeoffs among\ndifferent domains or aspects of flourishing that these conditions may\nnecessitate. Discussing a case of young women in Tanzania who chose to\nundergo clitoridectomy after receiving education about the\npractice aimed at empowering them, Khader writes: \u201cAre the young\nwomen who choose clitoridectomy disempowered because they have few\noptions for unambiguously pursuing their flourishing or are they\nempowered because they have exercised agential capacities by making a\nchoice? My analysis of IAP allows us to say both\u201d (187). For\nKhader, empowerment is a messy, complex, and incremental concept. Her\nanalysis of empowerment enables us to see that\n\u201cself-subordinating choices can have selective empowering\neffects under disempowering conditions\u201d (189). But the normative\ncore of her account, its deliberative perfectionism, insists that\n\u201ca situation where one cannot seek one\u2019s basic flourishing\nacross multiple domains is a tragic one\u201d (189).\n",
