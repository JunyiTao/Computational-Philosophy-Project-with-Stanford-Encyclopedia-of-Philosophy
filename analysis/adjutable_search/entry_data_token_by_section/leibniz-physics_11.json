    "main_text": "Leibniz on the Laws of Motion || A system of conservation principles\n4.2 A system of conservation principles\n\n\nFrom the perspective of kinematics, there is little new in Leibniz\u2019s\npositive account of the laws of motion. As we have seen, Leibniz\u2019s\nearliest systematic physics sought to accommodate the laws of impact\nas developed by Huygens and Wren by showing how those results might be\nderived from more fundamental laws of motion and the structure of the\nactual world. In his later work, that strategy is replaced by the\nattempt to show how essentially those same (\u201cconcrete\u201d)\nlaws of motion may be derived from a set of three conservation\nlaws. Although Leibniz\u2019s contribution to the kinematics of motion and\nimpact was thus not revolutionary, he nonetheless had the good sense\nto champion the best accounts going, and made them his own through his\nelegant derivations and by relating them to the broader themes of his\ndynamics and metaphysics. \n\n\nOne of the conservation laws that Leibniz takes to govern the \nbehavior of material bodies is what he calls the conservation of \nrelative velocity (GM VI.227/Langley 667). According to this \nprinciple, two perfectly elastic bodies will maintain the same \nrelative velocity with respect to their common center of gravity \nbefore and after \n collision.[25]\n That is, letting A and B represent two elastic \nballs involved in a head on collision: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Velocity\\ A_{\\before} &- \\Velocity\\ B_{\\before} = \\\\\n & \\Velocity\\ B_{\\after} - \\Velocity\\ A_{\\after}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nor more simply:\n\n\\[\nV_{A\\ \\before} - V_{B\\ \\before} = V_{B\\ \\after} - V_{A\\ \\after}\n\\]\n\n\n\nLeibniz suggests that the conservation of relative velocity is rooted\nin the conservation of the ability of the two colliding bodies to \nperform work on one another. The guiding idea here seems to be that \nthe ability of, say, the balls A and B to act on \none another in virtue of their relative motion, should not be lost at\nall (at least in idealized cases), so that after a collision they \nshould continue to have the same ability to act on one another as \nthey had before they collided, and thus that they should have the \nsame relative velocity after the collision as they had \n before.[26]\n\n\n\nA second conservation law Leibniz calls the conservation of \nquantity of progress. According to it, two bodies will maintain \nthe same relative progress \u2013 where progress is measured by the \nquantity of mass (molem) times velocity \u2013 before and \nafter collision (GM VI.227/Langley 667). Thus, letting A and\nB once again represent two balls involved in a head on \ncollision:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\Mass\\ A\\times V_{A\\ \\before}) &+ (\\Mass\\ B\\times V_{B\\ \\before}) = \\\\\n &(\\Mass\\ B\\times V_{B\\ \\after}) + (\\Mass\\ A\\times V_{A\\ \\after}) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nor more simply:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nM_A \\times V_{A\\ \\before} &+ M_B \\times V_{B\\ \\before} =  \\\\\n &M_B \\times V_{B\\ \\after} + M_A \\times V_{A\\ \\after}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s conservation of progress is closely related to the \nCartesian law of conservation of quantity of motion (and the more \nfamiliar law of the conservation of momentum). As Leibniz is at pains\nto emphasize, however, his law differs from the Cartesian law at \nleast in that it traffics in \u201csigned\u201d velocities rather \nthan scalar speeds. Leibniz is thus able to maintain that although \n\u201cit will be found that the total progress is conserved, or that\nthere is as much progress in the same direction before or after the \nimpact\u201d nonetheless the quantity of motion, as measured simply \nby speed times mass is not conserved (GM VI.217/Langley 658). \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s third law applies the conservation of vis\nviva to cases of impact. It therefore maintains that the \n\u201cmotive\u201d or \u201cliving\u201d force, as measured by \nmass times velocity squared for a pair of bodies is the same before \nand after collision (GM VI.227/Langley 667\u2013668): \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n M_A \\times (V_{A\\ \\before})^2 &+ M_B \\times (V_{B\\ \\before})^2 = \\\\\n &M_B \\times (V_{B\\ \\after})^2 + M_A \\times (V_{A\\ \\after})^2\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nUnlike the quantity of progress, but like relative velocity, the \nquantity of vis viva appears to be conserved only \nin elastic collisions. At the macro-level, when a lump of soft clay \nstrikes another lump of soft clay, their momentum is conserved but \nkinetic energy is lost. As noted above, rather than abandon the \nuniversality of his third law, Leibniz suggests instead that energy \nis conserved but redistributed to the minute parts of which the clay \nis composed. In this way, he tells us \u201cthat which is absorbed \nby the minute parts is not absolutely lost for the universe, although\nit is lost for the total force of the concurrent bodies\u201d (GM \nVI.231/Langley 670). \n\n\nIn his Essay on Dynamics, Leibniz shows how from any two of \nhis conservation laws the third law may be derived. This might \nsuggest that Leibniz sees all three as being on a par with one \nanother. In fact, however, he insists that the conservation of \nvis viva is more fundamental than the conservation \nof relative velocity or common progress. His reasons for privileging \nmv2 in this way are far from clear, but he must \nhave recognized them to be necessarily metaphysical. Although the \nmeasurement of mv2 is relative to a choice of \nreference frame, Leibniz probably thought that it had a better claim \nto tracking an intrinsic property of bodies in light of the \nconsiderations he raises in his Brief Demonstration. For \nLeibniz, vis viva is a force attributable to particular \nbodies in virtue of which they are able to perform work on other \nbodies \u2013 or as in the case of a pendulum \u2013 on themselves; he \nthus held the conservation of vis viva to be the most \nfundamental, overarching conservation law for the physical world. \n",
