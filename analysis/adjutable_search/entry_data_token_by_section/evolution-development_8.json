Related to this issue is the question how much \u2013 in\nthe sense of what kind of facts \u2013 natural selection alone can\nexplain (see the entry\n adaptationism).\n It is widely accepted that such explanations can address the general\ndynamics of trait frequencies and survival (see Sober 1984). However,\nwhether this also holds for addressing in more detail the development\nof particular traits of individuals is an unsettled issue. While some\nauthors claim that evolutionary explanations by natural selection can\nexplain why a particular individual has a certain trait rather than\nanother trait (Neander 1995; Forber 2005) others deny this (Sober\n1984; Stegmann 2010). What is more, it has been argued that\nintegrating explanations of developmental phenomena, like\ndevelopmental bias, phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, and inclusive inheritance, to the explanatory framework of evolutionary\ntheory would lead to a \u201csignificantly expanded explanatory\ncapacity\u201d of this theory (Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010: 12).\nHowever, while there is often agreement in evolutionary biology over\nthe existence of these developmental phenomena (Laland et al. 2014;\nWray et al. 2014), their explanatory relevance is questioned. Against\nthis background, scholars have begun analyzing based on which criteria\nof explanatory power, like precision, proportionality, sensitivity,\nand idealization, developmentalist evolutionary explanations are\nbetter than selectionist explanations. This includes identifying,\nwhich tradeoffs between explanatory standards (e.g., between precision\nand sensitivity or idealization) those accounts face that seek to\nintegrate developmental and evolutionary explanations (Baedke et al.\n2020b; Uller et al. 2020).\n",
