    "main_text": "The early Buber: Gestalt as a means of realization\n3. The early Buber: Gestalt as a means of realization\n\n\nBuber\u2019s early writings include anthologies, such as The Tales of\nRabbi Nachman (1906), The Legend of the Baal Shem Tov\n(1908), and mystical writings from world religions (Ecstatic\nConfessions, 1909), lectures on Judaism (On Judaism,\n1967b), and an expressionist dialogue on \u201crealization\u201d\n(Daniel, 1913). His essays on the arts include reflections on\nthe Isenheim Altarpiece, the dance of Nijinsky (Pointing the\nWay, 1957), Jewish art, and the painter Lesser Ury (The First\nBuber, 1999a). Common to these early productions is the\npreoccupation with shape (Gestalt), movement, color,\nlanguage, and gesture as the means of a \u201crealized\u201d or\n\u201cperfected\u201d particular human existence that represents\nlife beyond the limits of spatio-temporal duration imposed on us in\nthe manner of a Cartesian grid.\n\n\nThe German words Form (form) and Gestalt (here\ntranslated as \u201cshape\u201d) are not identical, although, in\nEnglish, it is easy to confuse one with the other. Buber uses\nGestalt as a term of central, constitutive, and animating\npower, contrasting it with the Platonic term Form, which he\nassociates with a lack of genuine vitality. Commenting upon a work by\nMichelangelo, Buber speaks of Gestalt as hidden in the raw\nmaterial, waiting to emerge as the artist wrestles with the dead block.\nThe artistic struggle instantiates and represents the more fundamental\nopposition between formative (gestaltende) and shapeless\n(gestaltlose) principles. The tension between these, for\nBuber, lay at the source of all spiritual renewal, raging within every\nhuman individual as the creative, spiritual act that subjugates\nunformed, physical stuff (1963b: 239). It is the free play of\nGestalt that quickens the dead rigidity of form.\n\n\nThe wrestling with form and its overcoming and its reanimation with\nliving energy in Buber\u2019s early work was rooted in a concern with\nthe embodiment of perception and imagination. Whether writing about\nHasidic masters, Nijinsky, religiosity, Judaism, mysticism, myth,\n\u201cthe Orient,\u201d or the Isenheim Altar, Buber always returned\nto the same fundamental dynamics. Everything starts from the most basic\nfacts of human existence: the body and motion. As understood by the\nearly Buber (following a Kantian intuition), the world is one in which\nthe objective spatial order was dissolved, where up and down, left and\nright, bear no intrinsic meaning. More fundamentally, orientation is\nalways related to the body, which is, however, an objective datum. Ethical\nlife remains inextricably linked, within the world of space, to the\nhuman body and to physical sensation as they reach across the divide\ntoward an unmitigated Erlebnis. The \u201cunity,\u201d so\nimportant to Buber\u2019s early conception of the self, was not an\noriginal one. It was instead the effect of those gestural acts that\n\u201cdance it out\u201d (Pointing the Way, 1957).\n\n\nBuber conceived of political community as a type of plastic shape,\nan object (or subject) of Gestaltung and hence realization.\nJust as he had enlivened Kant\u2019s distinction between phenomenon and\nnoumenon with his literary imagination, so too he transformed the\nvalue-theoretical distinction between Gesellschaft (society)\nand Gemeinschaft (community), types of social aggregation\ntheorized by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, into a wellspring for his\npolitical speeches and writings. The first arena for his social,\npsychological, and educational engagement was the Zionist movement.\nBuber\u2019s social philosophy was stimulated and decisively influenced by his close friend, the anarchist Gustav Landauer, whom he recruited to write the volume on revolution for his series Die Gesellschaft. As a pioneer of social thought and a student of Georg Simmel, Buber participated in the 1909 founding conference of\nthe German sociological association. Buber\u2019s social-psychological\napproach to the study and description of social phenomena and his interest in the constitutive correlation between the individual and his and her social experience\nremained important aspects of his philosophy of dialogue. It came to\nthe fore again in his last academic position at Hebrew\nUniversity in Jerusalem, where he taught social philosophy (prominent\nstudents: Amitai Etzioni, Shmuel Eisenstadt).\n\n\nBuber\u2019s thought matured under the impact of Landauer\u2019s harsh critique, which persuaded Buber that he had unduly romanticized the war. Buber\u2019s 1916 lead essay\nfor the new journal Der Jude still praised the war as an\nopportunity for the modern Jew to forge, out of the chaos of rupture, a\nfeeling for community, connection, a new unity, a unified\nGestalt, one that could restore the Jewish people to a\ncondition of wholeness. For Buber\u2019s friend Landauer, such\nthoughts were \u201cvery painful\u2026very repugnant, and borderline incomprehensible. Object though you will, I call this way of thinking aestheticism and formalism and I say that you have no right\u2026to try and tuck these tangled events into your philosophical scheme\n(sch\u00f6nen und weisen Allgemeinheiten): what results is\ninadequate and outrageous\u201d (Letters of Martin Buber, p.\n189; transl. modified). Landauer continued to argue, \u201cHistorical matters can only\nbe talked about historically, not in terms of formal patterns\n(formalem Schematismus) \u2026 I gladly grant that behind\nthis is the desire to see greatness; but desire alone is not sufficient\nto make greatness out of a confused vulgarity\u201d (ibid., 190\u20131).\nLandauer\u2019s challenge to the grotesque fusion of\nErlebnis, Gemeinschaft, and Gestalt out of\nworld war and mass slaughter precipitated the end of aesthetic\nreligiosity in Buber\u2019s work.\n",
