    "main_text": "The Debate About Liberty || Negative Liberty\n1.2 Negative Liberty\n\nLiberals disagree, however, about the concept of liberty, and as a\nresult the liberal ideal of protecting individual liberty can lead to\ndifferent conceptions of the task of government. Isaiah Berlin\nfamously advocated a negative conception of liberty:\n\nI am normally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of\nmen interferes with my activity. Political liberty in this sense is\nsimply the area within which a man can act unobstructed by others. If\nI am prevented by others from doing what I could otherwise do, I am to\nthat degree unfree; and if this area is contracted by other men beyond\na certain minimum, I can be described as being coerced, or, it may be,\nenslaved. Coercion is not, however, a term that covers every form of\ninability. If I say that I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the\nair, or cannot read because I am blind\u2026it would be eccentric to\nsay that I am to that degree enslaved or coerced. Coercion implies the\ndeliberate interference of other human beings within the area in which\nI could otherwise act. You lack political liberty or freedom only if\nyou are prevented from attaining a goal by human beings (Berlin, 1969:\n122).\n\n\nFor Berlin and those who follow him, then, the heart of liberty is the\nabsence of coercion by other agents; consequently, the liberal\nstate\u2019s commitment to protecting liberty is, essentially, the\njob of ensuring that citizens do not coerce each other without\ncompelling justification. So understood, negative liberty is a matter\nof which options are left to our discretion, or more precisely, which\noptions are foreclosed by the actions of others, and with what\nwarrant, and this is so regardless of whether we exercise such options\n(Taylor, 1979).\n",
