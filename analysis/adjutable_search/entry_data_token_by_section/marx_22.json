    "main_text": "Ideology || Ideology and Stability\n6.2 Ideology and Stability\n\nMarx does not view ideology as a feature of all societies, and, in\nparticular, suggests that it will not be a feature of a future\ncommunist society. However, ideology is portrayed as a feature of all\nclass-divided societies, and not only of capitalist\nsociety\u2014although many of Marx\u2019s comments on ideology are\nconcerned with the latter. The theory of ideology appears to play a\nrole in explaining a feature of class-divided societies which might\notherwise appear puzzling, namely what might be called their\n\u201cstability\u201d; that is, the absence of overt and serious\nconflict between social classes. This stability is not permanent, but\nit can last for extended historical periods. This stability appears\npuzzling to Marx because class-divided societies are flawed in ways\nwhich not only frustrate human flourishing, but also work to the\nmaterial advantage of the ruling minority. Why do the subordinate\nclasses, who form a majority, tolerate these flaws, when resistance\nand rebellion of various kinds might be in their objective\ninterests?\n\nMarx\u2019s account of the sources of social stability in\nclass-divided societies appeals to both repressive and non-repressive\nmechanisms. Such societies might often involve the direct repression\n(or the threat of it) of one group by another, but Marx does not think\nthat this is the whole story. There are also non-repressive sources of\nsocial stability, and ideology is usually, and plausibly, considered\none of these. Very roughly, Marx\u2019s account of ideology claims\nthat the dominant social ideas in such societies are typically false\nor misleading in a fashion that works to the advantage of the\neconomically dominant class.\n\nWe should note that ideology would seem to be a part and not the whole\nof Marx\u2019s account of the non-repressive sources of stability in\nclass divided societies. Other factors might include: dull economic\npressure, including the daily grind of having to earn a living;\ndoubts\u2014justified or otherwise\u2014about the feasibility of\nalternatives; sensitivity to the possible costs of radical social\nchange; and collective action problems of various kinds which face\nthose who do want to rebel and resist. Marx does not think individuals\nare permanently trapped within ideological modes of thinking. Ideology\nmay have an initial hold, but it is not portrayed as impervious to\nreason and evidence, especially in circumstances in which the\nobjective conditions for social change obtain.\n",
