    "main_text": "Stuff as Distinct From Things || Serious Pluralities\n3.1 Serious Pluralities\n\nSome have taken a view of pluralities which is not ontologically\ninnocent. Henry Laycock and Michael Burke, at times, have tentatively\nfavored the notion that there is a novel ontic category of plural\nentities which are not individual items of quantification.\n\nWhat is the difference between the ontologically innocent and\nontologically serious pluralists, and what is the case for the serious\nposition? The serious pluralist can have several motivations. Laycock\n(1972) argues that there is definite reference of mass expressions,\nsuch as \u2018that water\u2019, \u2018the water in the tub\u2019,\nbut that this reference is not singular reference. \u2018This\nwater\u2019, on a demonstrative occasion, refers, but, \u201cmy\ncontention is that this water, unlike this or that drop, is\nnot a particular object\u201d (1972, p.\u20094). Laycock claims\nthat \u201cwe can and do think of stuff as having an\nindependent reality [from things]\u201d (1972, p.\u200927,\nitalics his). While saying \u201cthat there is gold in a certain\nregion is certainly to assert the existence of\nsomething\u201d (1972, p.\u200928), he does deny that this\n\u2018something\u2019 is particular, and, throughout his work,\ndenies that it is a set or a fusion. What definite singular terms like\n\u2018the gold in the\u2026\u2019 \u201cdesignate is a quite\ndistinct type of item, concrete but not particular\u201d (1972,\np.\u200928).\n\nIf one really believes that i) there is water, ii) we make definite\nreference to it, iii) water is not a thing (i.e., not a sum or set),\nand iv) plural quantification and predication is irreducible to\nsingular quantification and predication, then one might feel compelled\nto accept that mass expressions like water and gold\nrefer to genuine entities distinct from (or \u2018over and\nabove\u2019) the water and gold molecules. Let us call whatever it is\nthat is referred to with definite reference by mass expressions in\nthis way \u2018pluralities\u2019 (Laycock and Burke do not use the\nphrase, and Laycock would probably find it at best infelicitous, and\nat worst a grave source of metaphysical error).\n\nBelief in irreducible pluralities gets more traction when combined\nwith a denial of unrestricted mereology, which is just what Laycock\ndoes:\n\nThe posit of a physical object without a physical unity\u2014the\nposit of a \u2018formless\u2019 or \u2018structureless\u2019\nconcrete plurality, an arbitrary physical unit upon which there are no\nphysical or spatio-temporal constraints\u2014is no mere curiosity: it\nwould seem to be a kind of incoherence\u2026the concept of an object\nis the concept of a unit or a unity\u2026A physical object with all\nthe physical unity of a set of physical objects, for example\n{Caesar\u2019s nose, the Eiffel Tower, the Andromeda galaxy}\u2014a\nphysical object in short lacking physical or spatio-temporal\nunity\u2014is no physical object at all. (2006, p.\u200995)\n\n\nIf one accepts (i)\u2013(iv), and has reason to reject both UFM (see\n 2.1.1)\n and the set-theoretical view, and one wants commonsense sentences\nfeaturing mass expressions to come out true, then what is left to be\nreferred to by nominal statements about water, lead, etc. except\npluralities?\n\nAnother motivation can be found in Burke (1997), inspired by Laycock.\nBurke was concerned to resolve the coincidence puzzle between not only\na thing and its constituting piece of matter, but between these things\nand the matter per se. (Since some copper can persist past\nthe shattering of a piece of copper which constitutes a statue, then\npresumably the copper is distinct from either). Burke\u2019s account,\nall the details of which do not concern us here (see the entry on\n material constitution\n and the supplement\n Sums and Ordinary Objects\n for details) requires that the statue and piece of copper be\nidentical. If this is so, and the statue comes into existence, and is\nidentical with its constituting piece, then a new piece must come into\nexistence and the old one cease to be. One of the options Burke\ncanvasses to explain why it is that we (mistakenly) assume the piece\ncontinues in existence is because the copper persists through\nthe change:\n\nOf course, this explanation concedes that the statue\u2026shares its\nplace with something, namely, the copper. So am I not\nallowing coinciding objects after all? No, I am not, since I deny that\nthe copper is a single object. Following Laycock (1972) , I claim that\nthe copper is a plurality. It is many objects\u2026 The case of the\nstatue and the copper is not a case of coinciding objects because it\nis not a case in which one object occupies the same place as any one\nother. (1997, p.\u200912, italics his)\n\n\nBurke denies the identification of the many copper bits and the piece\nof copper:\n\nWell, I hold that each of the many is a part of the one, but I deny\nthat the many parts collectively are identical with the\none\u2026Trivially, the many are many. But it is not individually\nthat they are many. (They are one each.) So the many collectively are\nmany. But \u2018many\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 are contrary. So\nthe many collectively are not one. But, again trivially, the one is\none. So it is false that the many collectively are identical with the\none. (1997, p.\u200913)\n\n\nIt is doubtful, though, that postulating pluralities which are not\nthings can solve the coincidence puzzles. Burke, who himself brought\nup a similar objection to coincidence in general, faces the following\nproblem. How are distinct entities, such as the statue and the copper,\ndifferent in sort, given that they both have the same intrinsic\nproperties? There seems to be a one to one correspondence between the\nfeatures of the statue and those of the copper. Why isn\u2019t the\ncopper a statue, for the same reasons the piece of copper is? Burke\ncan insist that the main difference is that the statue/piece is one\nthing, whereas the copper is many things, but it is not clear why\nwithholding the honorific thing from \u2018the\u2019 copper\nplurality solves the problem (Zimmerman 1997, p.\u200923).\n\nIt is unclear what the addition of the attribution of \u2018concrete\nnon-particulars\u2019 to the plural analysis is doing, and doubtful\nthat it clarifies matters. (See Steen 2011 for a critique of\n\u2018contingent non-particularity\u2019). Indeed it seems to\nsomewhat back away from the plural analysis. The initial reason for\nanalyzing concrete mass expressions in terms of plural quantification\nand predication is that talk about \u2018the lions\u2019 and\n\u2018those Hobbits\u2019 is relatively unproblematic. But then, why\nreduce mass expressions to plural reference if one holds that\nwater or a water plurality is something over and above\nthose water molecules, yet denies that the lion\nplurality is something over and above those lions?\nIt\u2019s not clear why both water and lions get a plural reference\ntreatment, yet the referents of mass expressions get to retain some\nkind of ontological halo which distinguishes their referents from\nnon-mass plural expressions. Laycock (2006) no longer holds (and only\ntentatively held) that mass expressions are plural.\n",
