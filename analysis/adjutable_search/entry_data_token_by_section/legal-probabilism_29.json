    "main_text": "Further Objections || The difficulty about conjunction\n7.1 The difficulty about conjunction\n\nSuppose the plaintiff is to prove two separate claims, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), according to the governing standard of proof, say,\npreponderance of the evidence (which the legal probabilist may\ninterpret as the requirement that the facts be established with\ngreater probability than .5). If the plaintiff has proven each claim\nwith probability .7, the burden of proof should be met. And yet, if\nthe two claims are independent, the probability of their conjunction\nis only \\(.7\\times.7=.49\\), below the required threshold. Arguably,\ncommon law systems subscribe to a conjunction principle which states\nthat if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are established according to the governing\nstandard of proof, so is their conjunction. Probability theory\u2014the\ncriticism goes\u2014cannot capture this principle. This is the so-called\nconjunction paradox or difficulty about conjunction. It was originally\nformulated by Cohen (1977) and has enjoyed great popularity every\nsince (Allen 1986; Allen and Stein 2013; Allen and Pardo 2019;\nHaack 2014; Schwartz and Sober 2017; Stein 2005).\n\nWithout rejecting the conjunction principle of the common law, legal\nprobabilists can respond in a few different ways. Dawid (1987) argues\nthat the difficulty about conjunction disappears if evidential support\nis modeled probabilistically by likelihood ratios instead of posterior\nprobabilities. He writes that \n\n\nsuitably measured, the support supplied by the conjunction of several\nindependent testimonies exceeds that supplied by any of its\nconstituents. \n\n\nAlthough the original paradox pertains to posterior probabilities of\nliability, Dawid argues that the paradox does not arise for likelihood\nratios. Garbolino (2014) also recommends switching to likelihood\nratios. Yet the conjunction paradox still arises for likelihood ratios\nwhen the items of evidence, say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), are assessed relative\nto a composite hypothesis, say \\(A \\wedge B\\). Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nprovide positive support for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively. Urbaniak\n(2019) shows that the combined likelihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(a \\wedge b \\pmid  A\\wedge B)}{\\Pr(a\\wedge b \\pmid  \\neg (A \\wedge B))}\\]\n\n\ncan be lower than the individual likelihood ratios  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(a \\pmid  A)}{\\Pr(a \\pmid  \\neg A)}\\]\n\n\nand \n\n \\[\\frac{\\Pr(b \\pmid  B)}{\\Pr(b \\pmid  \\neg B)}.\\]\n\n\nCheng (2012) provides another probability-based solution to the\nconjunction paradox. He argues that the standard of proof in civil\ncases should require that the plaintiff\u2019s hypothesis be\ncomparatively more probable on the evidence than the defendant\u2019s\nhypothesis. On this account, the probability of \\(A\\wedge B\\) given\nthe overall evidence in a case should be compared with the probability\nof the alternative hypotheses given the same evidence. The\nalternatives to be considered are as follows: \n\n\\(A\\wedge \\neg B\\), \n\\(\\neg A \\wedge B\\), and \n\\(\\neg A \\wedge \\neg B\\).\n\n\nGiven suitable assumptions, the probabilities of these alternatives\nwill fall below the probability of \\(A\\wedge B\\) provided \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), individually, are supported by the evidence. So whenever the\nstandard of proof is met for individual claims \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the\nstandard should also be met for the composite claim \\(A \\wedge B\\).\nKaplow (2014) advances a similar argument. Urbaniak (2019) points out\nthat Cheng splits the defense hypothesis into three sub-cases,\n\\(A\\wedge \\neg B\\), \\(\\neg A \\wedge B\\), and \\(\\neg A \\wedge \\neg B\\),\nbut does not consider the alternative \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\). The\nprobability of \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\) may actually exceed that of\n\\(A\\wedge B\\). If \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\) is the alternative hypothesis,\nthe standard might not be met for the composite claim \\(A \\wedge B\\),\neven when the standard is met for individual claims \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\n(for another critique of Cheng\u2019s approach, see Allen & Stein\n2013).\n\nFinally, legal probabilists can pursue a holistic approach in response\nto the conjunction paradox. This solution has been defended by\nopponents of legal probabilism (Allen 1986; Allen and Pardo 2019), but\ncan also be adopted by legal probabilists. Instead of assessing the\nposterior probabilities of individual claims given individual pieces\nof evidence, the holistic approach recommends assessing the\nprobability of the overall composite claim, say \\(A \\wedge B\\), in\nlight of all the evidence available (Hedden and Colyvan, 2019; see\nhowever the response by Allen 2020). Bayesian networks (see earlier\ndiscussion in Section 3) can help\nto assess the evidence holistically (de Zoete, Sjerps, and Meester\n2017; de Zoete and Sjerps 2018; Neil et al. 2019).\n",
