    "main_text": "The Formula of the Universal Law of Nature\n5. The Formula of the Universal Law of Nature\n\nKant\u2019s first formulation of the CI states that you are to\n\u201cact only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at\nthe same time will that it become a universal law\u201d (G 4:421).\nO\u2019Neill (1975, 1989) and Rawls (1980, 1989), among others, take\nthis formulation in effect to summarize a decision procedure for moral\nreasoning, and we will follow their basic outline: First, formulate a\nmaxim that enshrines your proposed plan of action. Second, recast that\nmaxim as a universal law of nature governing all rational agents, and\nso as holding that all must, by natural law, act as you yourself\npropose to act in these circumstances. Third, consider whether your\nmaxim is even conceivable in a world governed by this new law of\nnature. If it is, then, fourth, ask yourself whether you would, or\ncould, rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world.\nIf you could, then your action is morally permissible.\n\nIf your maxim fails the third step, you have a \u201cperfect\u201d\nduty admitting \u201cof no exception in favor of inclination\u201d\nto refrain from acting on that maxim (G 4:421). If your maxim fails\nthe fourth step, you have an \u201cimperfect\u201d duty requiring\nyou to pursue a policy that can admit of such exceptions. If your\nmaxim passes all four steps, only then is acting on it morally\npermissible. Following Hill (1971), we can understand the difference\nin duties as formal: Perfect duties come in the form \u201cOne must\nnever (or always) \u03c6 to the fullest extent possible in\nC\u201d, while imperfect duties, since they require us to\nadopt an end, at least require that \u201cOne must sometimes and to\nsome extent \u03c6 in C.\u201d So, for instance, Kant held\nthat the maxim of committing suicide to avoid future unhappiness did\nnot pass the third step, the contradiction in conception test. Hence,\none is forbidden to act on the maxim of committing suicide to avoid\nunhappiness. By contrast, the maxim of refusing to assist others in\npursuit of their projects passes the contradiction in conception test,\nbut fails the contradiction in the will test at the fourth step.\nHence, we have a duty to sometimes and to some extent aid and assist\nothers.\n\nKant held that ordinary moral thought recognized moral duties toward\nourselves as well as toward others. Hence, together with the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duties, Kant recognized four\ncategories of duties: perfect duties toward ourselves, perfect duties\ntoward others, imperfect duties toward ourselves and imperfect duties\ntoward others. Kant uses four examples in the Groundwork, one\nof each kind of duty, to demonstrate that every kind of duty can be\nderived from the CI, and hence to bolster his case that the CI is\nindeed the fundamental principle of morality. To refrain from suicide\nis a perfect duty toward oneself; to refrain from making promises you\nhave no intention of keeping is a perfect duty toward others; to\ndevelop one\u2019s talents is an imperfect duty toward oneself; and\nto contribute to the happiness of others is an imperfect duty toward\nothers. Again, Kant\u2019s interpreters differ over exactly how to\nreconstruct the derivation of these duties. We will briefly sketch one\nway of doing so for the perfect duty to others to refrain from lying\npromises and the imperfect duty to ourselves to develop talents.\n\nKant\u2019s example of a perfect duty to others concerns a promise\nyou might consider making but have no intention of keeping in order to\nget needed money. Naturally, being rational requires not contradicting\noneself, but there is no self-contradiction in the maxim \u201cI will\nmake lying promises when it achieves something I want.\u201d An\nimmoral action clearly does not involve a self-contradiction in this\nsense (as would the maxim of finding a married bachelor). Kant\u2019s\nposition is that it is irrational to perform an action if that\naction\u2019s maxim contradicts itself once made into a universal\nlaw of nature. The maxim of lying whenever it gets you what you\nwant generates a contradiction once you try to combine it with the\nuniversalized version that all rational agents must, by a law of\nnature, lie when doing so gets them what they want.\n\nHere is one way of seeing how this might work: If I conceive of a\nworld in which everyone by nature must try to deceive people any time\nthis will get them what they want, I am conceiving of a world in which\nno practice of giving one\u2019s word could ever arise and, because\nthis is a law of nature, we can assume that it is widely known that no\nsuch practice could exist. So I am conceiving of a world in which\neveryone knows that no practice of giving one\u2019s word exists. My\nmaxim, however, is to make a deceptive promise in order to get needed\nmoney. And it is a necessary means of doing this that a practice of\ntaking the word of others exists, so that someone might take my word\nand I take advantage of their doing so. Thus, in trying to conceive of\nmy maxim in a world in which no one ever takes anyone\u2019s word in\nsuch circumstances, and knows this about one another, I am trying to\nconceive of this: A world in which no practice of giving one\u2019s\nword exists, but also, at the very same time, a world in which just\nsuch a practice does exist, for me to make use of in my maxim. It is a\nworld containing my promise and a world in which there can be no\npromises. Hence, it is inconceivable that I could sincerely act on my\nmaxim in a world in which my maxim is a universal law of nature. Since\nit is inconceivable that these two things could exist together, I am\nforbidden ever to act on the maxim of lying to get money.\n\nBy contrast with the maxim of the lying promise, we can easily\nconceive of adopting a maxim of refusing to develop any of our talents\nin a world in which that maxim is a universal law of nature. It would\nundoubtedly be a world more primitive than our own, but pursuing such\na policy is still conceivable in it. However, it is not, Kant argues,\npossible to rationally will this maxim in such a world. The argument\nfor why this is so, however, is not obvious, and some of Kant\u2019s\nthinking seems hardly convincing: Insofar as we are rational, he says,\nwe already necessarily will that all of our talents and abilities be\ndeveloped. Hence, although I can conceive of a talentless world, I\ncannot rationally will that it come about, given that I already will,\ninsofar as I am rational, that I develop all of my own. Yet, given\nlimitations on our time, energy and interest, it is difficult to see\nhow full rationality requires us to aim to fully develop literally all\nof our talents. Indeed, it seems to require much less, a judicious\npicking and choosing among one\u2019s abilities. Further, all that is\nrequired to show that I cannot will a talentless world is that,\ninsofar as I am rational, I necessarily will that some\ntalents in me be developed, not the dubious claim that I rationally\nwill that they all be developed. Moreover, suppose\nrationality did require me to aim at developing all of my talents.\nThen, there seems to be no need to go further in the CI procedure to\nshow that refusing to develop talents is immoral. Given that, insofar\nas we are rational, we must will to develop capacities, it is by this\nvery fact irrational not to do so.\n\nHowever, mere failure to conform to something we rationally will is\nnot yet immorality. Failure to conform to instrumental principles, for\ninstance, is irrational but not always immoral. In order to show that\nthis maxim is categorically forbidden, one strategy is to make use of\nseveral other of Kant\u2019s claims or assumptions.\n\nFirst, we must accept Kant\u2019s claim that, by \u201cnatural\nnecessity,\u201d we will our own happiness as an end (G 4:415). This\nis a claim he uses not only to distinguish assertoric from problematic\nimperatives, but also to argue for the imperfect duty of helping\nothers (G 4:423) He also appears to rely on this claim in each of his\nexamples. Each maxim he is testing appears to have happiness as its\naim. One explanation for this is that, since each person necessarily\nwills her own happiness, maxims in pursuit of this goal will be the\ntypical object of moral evaluation. This, at any rate, is clear in the\ntalents example itself: The forbidden maxim adopted by the\nne\u2019er-do-well is supposed to be \u201cdevoting his life solely\nto\u2026enjoyment\u201d (G 4:423) rather than to developing his\ntalents.\n\nSecond, we must assume, as also seems reasonable, that a necessary\nmeans to achieving (normal) human happiness is not only that we\nourselves develop some talent, but also that others develop some\ncapacities of theirs at some time. For instance, I cannot engage in\nthe normal pursuits that make up my own happiness, such as playing\npiano, writing philosophy or eating delicious meals, unless I have\ndeveloped some talents myself, and, moreover, someone else has made\npianos and written music, taught me writing, harvested foods and\ndeveloped traditions of their preparation.\n\nFinally, Kant\u2019s examples come on the heels of defending the\nposition that rationality requires conformity to hypothetical\nimperatives. Thus, we should assume that, necessarily, rational agents\nwill the necessary and available means to any ends that they will. And\nonce we add this to the assumptions that we must will our own\nhappiness as an end, and that developed talents are necessary means to\nachieving that end, it follows that we cannot rationally will that a\nworld come about in which it is a law that no one ever develops any of\ntheir natural talents. We cannot do so, because our own happiness is\nthe very end contained in the maxim of giving ourselves over to\npleasure rather than self-development. Since we will the necessary and\navailable means to our ends, we are rationally committed to willing\nthat everyone sometime develop his or her talents. So since we cannot\nwill as a universal law of nature that no one ever develop any talents\n\u2014 given that it is inconsistent with what we now see that we\nrationally will \u2014 we are forbidden from adopting the maxim of\nrefusing to develop any of our own.\n",
