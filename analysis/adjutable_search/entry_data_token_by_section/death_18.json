    "main_text": "The Timing Puzzle || Subsequentism\n4.3 Subsequentism\n\nIn cases like catching the flu, it makes sense to say that the\noffending event is bad for its victim after it occurs\u2014while she\nis incurring intrinsic evils she otherwise would lack. Perhaps the\nsame is true of deprivation harm. Recall the example, discussed\nearlier, in which being sedated at time t is bad for a person\ndue to the fact that it deprives her of good things: in this example,\nit seems, being sedated makes her worse off than she otherwise would\nbe at a time after t\u2014at the time when she would have\nbeen enjoying those goods had she not been sedated. Can we extend this\nstory to the deprivation harm for which a victim\u2019s death is\nresponsible? Does a person\u2019s death makes her worse off than she\notherwise would be after she dies\u2014during the time when she would\nhave been enjoying the goods of which her death has deprived her, had\nshe not died? Call this stance subsequentism. Proponents of\nsubsequentism include Neil Feit (2002) and Ben Bradley (2004,\n2009).\n\nSubsequentism is plausible only if we can make good sense of the\nwelfare level someone occupies while dead, but this may not be\npossible. There are at least two problems to discuss.\n\nOne difficulty is the problem of the subject. Suppose we are\nterminators rather than anti-terminators (discussed in Section 2.6).\nSuppose, too, that you die at time t1 but had you\nnot you would have experienced joy at time t2.\nTime t2 arrives while you are dead, so that, given\nthe termination thesis, t2 arrives while you no\nlonger exist. Consider the property, lacks joy. Does it make\nsense to attribute this (or any other) property to you at\nt2? Does it make sense to say that some subject\nhas a property at a time when that subject does not exist? If not, it\nseems difficult to make sense of your having a welfare level then.\nEpicurus seemed to be thinking along these lines when he wrote that\n\u201cdeath is nothing to us, since when we are, death is not, and\nwhen death is present, then we are not.\u201d (Echoing Epicurus,\nNagel 1970 wrote \u201cSo long as a person exists, he has not yet\ndied, and once he has died, he no longer exists; so there seems to be\nno time when death, if it is a misfortune, can be ascribed to its\nunfortunate subject.\u201d But if this is the reason we cannot\nascribe misfortune to a victim of death then we cannot even ascribe\ndeath to any victim.)\n\nIt might seem possible to solve the problem of the subject by simply\nswitching sides and becoming anti-terminators, but this will not work.\nAnti-terminators can say that it is a straightforward matter to\nattribute the property lacks joy to you at\nt2, since you still exist at\nt2. You are your (joyless) corpse at\nt2. This won\u2019t work because you might die\nand go out of existence without leaving a corpse, and even if you\nleave a corpse it might rot away, taking you out of existence, well\nbefore time t2 arrives. Both possibilities are\nconsistent with the fact that, had you not died when you did, at\nt1, you would have experienced joy at\nt2.\n\nStill, there are more promising strategies for solving the problem of\nthe subject. Subsequentists might adopt a view that is sometimes\ncalled metaphysical eternalism (defended by Nagel 1970 and Silverstein\n1980, among others). On this view, past and future objects are\nontologically on a par with present objects. Existing things are\nspread out in both space and time. Suppose it is possible to refer to\nanything that is ontologically on a par with present objects. Then,\ngiven metaphysical eternalism, we can still refer to Socrates, even\nthough \u2018Socrates\u2019 refers to something whose existence is\ntemporally located wholly in the past, and say of him that he is not\nalive. For similar reasons, perhaps, we can also attribute the\nproperty lacks joy to a person, such as Socrates, whose\nexistence is over.\n\nHowever, even if they can solve the problem of the subject, and make\nsense of attributing properties to subjects who are dead,\nsubsequentists face another difficulty: it seems confused to speak of\nhow well off a subject is during times when she is dead. Now, it does\nmake sense to attribute the property lacks joy to a corpse,\nand to a person who has stopped existing. Anti-terminators will add\nthat a person will have this property\u2014lacks\njoy\u2014while she is a corpse. But it makes no sense to ask how\nwell off a person is while she is a corpse or during some time after\nshe has stopped existing altogether. The concept of faring well or ill\ndoes not apply to things like concrete blocks and corpses or to\npersons while they are corpses. Things that do fare well or ill may\npass through periods of time when they have a level of welfare that is\nequal to 0\u2014during those times they are capable of accruing goods\nor evils but do neither\u2014but unlike them, bags of concrete are\nnot capable of having any welfare level, not even a level of 0. The\nsame seems true of a corpse. And the same seems true of us during such\ntimes as we are no longer alive\u2014times when we have become\ncorpses or when those corpses have turned to dust.\n\nMany theorists who reject subsequentism assume that because death\ntakes a person out of actual existence, the dead are not\n\u201cthere\u201d to be harmed. Palle Yourgrau (2019) rejects this\nassumption. He combines modal realism (the view that, like the actual\nworld, other possible worlds are concrete objects) with the thesis of\ntransworld identity (one and the same object exists in more than one\npossible world), and says that although a dead person no longer exists\nin the actual world, one and the same person is still alive, and\nexists, in other possible worlds. We may deny that, after a person has\ndied, she is no longer real at all\u2014not \u201cthere\u201d to be\nharmed\u2014because she still exists in other worlds, according to\nYourgrau.\n",
