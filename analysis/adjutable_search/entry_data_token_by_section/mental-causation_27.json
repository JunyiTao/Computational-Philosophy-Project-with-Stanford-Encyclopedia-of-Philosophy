    "main_text": "Problem IV: Externalism || The Appeal to Explanatory Practice\n7.5 The Appeal to Explanatory Practice\n\nSome theorists would challenge the distinction\u2014implicit in the\nforegoing discussion\u2014between explanation and causation. Our\nconcept of causality, they would insist, is bound up with the\nconcept of explanation: causally relevant properties are those that\nfigure in our best causal explanations (Segal and Sober 1991; Wilson\n1992; Burge 1993; Raymont 2001; \u00a76.3). We find out what causal\nrelations amount to by starting with clear cases of causal\nexplanation. Given that we (and the cognitive scientists) routinely\nexplain physical events by citing mental causes (and mental events by\ninvoking physical causes), questioning whether real causal\nrelations answer to these explanations is to succumb to the kind of\nmetaphysical hubris that gives metaphysics a bad name.\n\nThis appeal to explanatory practice has the potential to answer in one\nfell swoop all four of the property-based problems we\u2019ve\nconsidered.\n\nDoubtless our understanding of the notions of causality and causal\nrelevance depends importantly on our grasp of causal explanations. But\nthere are at least two areas of concern about the explanatory strategy\n(compare Kim 1998, pp. 60\u20137). First, you might wonder whether\nthe strategy addresses the right question. Earlier, we pointed out\nthat the central question of mental causation is not so much\nwhether mental properties are causally relevant but\nhow they could be, given some alleged feature of mental\nproperties (in the case at issue here, the feature is their being\nrelational properties). The explanatory strategy would at best seem to\nbe addressing only the \u201cwhether\u201d question, not the\n\u201chow\u201d question. Second, even when restricted to the\n\u201cwhether\u201d question, the strategy rests on a conflation of\nwhat appears to be an epistemological notion (explanation) with\nmetaphysical notions (causation and causal relevance). A full\nevaluation of the view would thus require a deeper look into how the\ntwo are related.\n",
