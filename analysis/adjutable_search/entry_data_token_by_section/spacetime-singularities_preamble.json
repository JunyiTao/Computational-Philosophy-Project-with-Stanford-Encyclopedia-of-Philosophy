    "main_text": "\n\nA spacetime singularity is a breakdown in spacetime, either in its\ngeometry or in some other basic physical structure. It is a topic of\nongoing physical and philosophical research to clarify both the nature\nand significance of such pathologies. When it is the fundamental\ngeometry that breaks down, spacetime singularities are often viewed as\nan end, or \u201cedge\u201d, of spacetime itself. Numerous\ndifficulties, however, arise when one tries to make this notion more\nprecise. Breakdowns in other physical structures pose other problems,\njust as difficult. Our current theory of spacetime, general\nrelativity, not only allows for singularities, but tells us that they\nare unavoidable in some real-world circumstances. Thus we apparently\nneed to understand the ontology of singularities if we are to grasp\nthe nature of space and time in the actual universe. The possibility\nof singularities also carries potentially important implications for\nthe issues of physical determinism and the scope of physical laws.\n\n\nBlack holes are regions of spacetime from which nothing, not even\nlight, can escape. A typical black hole is the result of the\ngravitational force becoming so strong that one would have to travel\nfaster than light to escape its pull. Such black holes generically\ncontain a spacetime singularity at their center; thus we cannot fully\nunderstand a black hole without also understanding the nature of\nsingularities. Black holes, however, raise several additional\nconceptual problems and questions on their own. When quantum effects\nare taken into account, black holes, although they are nothing more\nthan regions of spacetime, appear to become thermodynamical entities,\nwith a temperature and an entropy. This seems to point to a deep and\nhitherto unsuspected connection among our three most fundamental\ntheories, general relativity, quantum field theory and thermodynamics.\nIt is far from clear, however, what it may mean to attribute\nthermodynamical properties to black holes. At the same time, some of\nthese thermodynamical properties of black holes now seem amenable to\ndirect testing in terrestrial laboratories by observing the behavior\nof \u201canalogue\u201d systems composed of ordinary material. This\nall raises problems about inter-theory relations, in particular about\nrelations between the \u201csame\u201d quantity as it appears in\ndifferent theories. It also bears on the meaning and status of the\nSecond Law of thermodynamics, with possible implications for\ncharacterizing a cosmological arrow of time. \n\nFinally, the evolution of black holes is apparently in conflict with\nstandard quantum evolution, for such evolution rules out the sort of\nincrease in entropy that seems to be required when black holes are\npresent. Indeed, as purely gravitational entities with striking\nquantum properties, what we know about black holes lies at the heart\nof and guides many attempts to formulate a theory of quantum gravity.\nThis has led to a debate over what seemingly fundamental physical\nprinciples are likely to be preserved in, or violated by, a full\nquantum theory of gravity. \n\nBecause so few philosophers have worked on these issues, many\nquestions and problems of great possible interest have not been\ninvestigated philosophically at all; others have had only the barest\nstarts made on them; consequently, several sections discussed in this\narticle merely raise questions and point to problems that deserve\nphilosophical attention. The field is wide open for expansive and\nintensive exploration. \n\nAll the technical material required to delve more deeply into the\nsubject of this entry can be found in any of a number of excellent\nclassic and recent sources, including: Hawking and Ellis (1973);\nGeroch and Horowitz (1979); Wald (1984, 1994); Brout et\nal (1995); Malament (2007, 2012); and Manchak (2013). The\nreader unfamiliar with general relativity may find it helpful to\nreview the Hole Argument entry's\n Beginner's Guide to Modern Spacetime Theories,\n which presents a brief and accessible introduction to the concepts of\na spacetime manifold, a metric, and a worldline. \n",
