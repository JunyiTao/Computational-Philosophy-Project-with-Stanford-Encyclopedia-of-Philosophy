    "main_text": "Authenticity || Self-Recovery in Sartre and Beauvoir\n5.5 Self-Recovery in Sartre and Beauvoir\n\n\nSartre and Beauvoir follow Heidegger in viewing self-deception as\nstructural to the human condition. It is, as Sartre writes,\n\u201can immediate, permanent threat to every project of the human\nbeing\u201d (1943 [1956, 116]). Although I can certainly deceive\nmyself by over-identifying with freedom and denying the extent to which\nmy possibilities are constrained by facticity, the most common and\nfamiliar form of bad faith is when I over-identify with my facticity,\nas if I were a fully realized object or thing, a being\n\u201cin-itself\u201d (en-soi). This form of self-deception\nis understandable as it creates the consoling impression that there is\nsomething secure and thing-like about my identity, that \u201cI am\nwhat I am,\u201d and there is nothing that can change me. But to\nlive this way is to deny my freedom and transcendence, that I am\nself-making, that I live for myself\u2014or, in the\nvernacular of Sartre and Beauvoir, \u201cfor-itself\u201d\n(pour-soi). Human beings are, on their view, always in the\nprocess of making or constituting themselves, modifying and negating\ntheir being through moment-to-moment choices and actions. This means my\nidentity is never fixed or stable because I can always choose to take a\nnew path or interpret myself in other ways. Regardless of how I see\nmyself at a given time\u2014as a professor, a father, or a political\nactivist\u2014I am also \u201cnot\u201d that person, because my\nidentity is never realized and complete; I am always free to negate a\ngiven identity and define myself differently in the future. This means\nI am \u201cwhat I am not\u201d (1943\n[1956, 103]). And this situation appears to undermine the prospect of\nauthenticity altogether. If the self is always unstable, always in\nquestion, how can I ever be genuine or true to myself?\n\n\nIn Being and Nothingness, Sartre provides an answer,\nreferring to authenticity in terms of a \u201crecovery\u201d\n(r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration) of a self or way of being \u201cthat\nwas previously corrupted\u201d (1943 [1956,\n 116]).[11]\n But this act of\n\u201cself-recovery\u201d has nothing to do with creating or holding\non to a particular identity. It involves, rather, a clear-eyed\nawareness and acceptance of the instability and ambiguity of the human\ncondition. And, along with this acceptance, a willingness to act in the\nface of this ambiguity and to take responsibility, however horrible,\nfor wherever these actions might lead. As Sartre writes,\n\u201cauthenticity consists in a lucid consciousness of the situation,\nin assuming the responsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it\n[\u2026] sometimes with horror and hate\u201d (1946 [1948, 90]). But\njust because existence is fundamentally ambiguous does not mean that\nour chosen projects are meaningless or absurd. My projects have meaning\nand value because I chose these projects, but the meaning is\ncontingent; it is never enduring or stable. In The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, Beauvoir explains: \u201cThe notion of ambiguity must\nnot be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is\nabsurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it\nis ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed\u201d (1947\n[1948, 129]). The point of authenticity, then, is not to be concerned\nwith who I am\u2014because, at bottom, I am nothing. It is to\nbe concerned with what I do. As Sartre writes,\n\u201cAuthenticity reveals that the only meaningful project is that of\ndoing (not that of being)\u201d (1948 [1992, 475]). For\nSartre and Beauvoir, to be authentic is to recover and accept the\nambiguous tension of the self, that: we are who we are\nnot\u2014and\u2014we are not who are. And by\nmeans of this recovery, recognize that the task of existence involves\nacting and doing, that is, realizing our freedom through projects in\nthe world but also, as we will see, taking responsibility for how these\nprojects might enhance or diminish freedom for others.\n",
