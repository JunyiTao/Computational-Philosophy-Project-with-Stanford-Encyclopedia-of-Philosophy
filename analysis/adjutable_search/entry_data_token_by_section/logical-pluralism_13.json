Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism\n\nSeveral other varieties of logical pluralism have been proposed since\nBeall and Restall\u2019s early work, and five are outlined in this\nsection. A useful way to classify these different\nviews\u2014including Beall and Restall\u2019s case-based\npluralism\u2014is as each taking logical consequence to be\nrelative to a different feature\u2014e.g., precisifications\nof \u201ccase\u201d (for Beall and Restall), sets of logical\nconstants (for Varzi), kinds of truth-bearer (for Russell), goals (for\nCook\u2019s less radical approach), and epistemic norms (for Field\u2019s).[6]\n\nOccasionally it is objected that one or more of these views does not\nconstitute a \u201creal\u201d logical pluralism, on the grounds that\nit merely relativises consequence to some new parameter, and (the\nobjection continues) this would make the view a form of relativism,\nrather than a form of\n pluralism.[7]\n We take up the question of what makes for a \u201creal\u201d or\nsubstantive logical pluralism in more fully in\n \u00a76.\n But it is worth remembering that not just some but most of\nthe views standardly discussed under the heading of logical\npluralism\u2014including the most central case-based\nversions\u2014can be understood as relativising logical consequence\nto something distinctive. They are standardly described as logical\npluralisms anyway, presumably because they are views on which it can\nreasonably be claimed that more than one logic is correct. The\nliterature is thus easier to follow if one doesn\u2019t assume that\nthe words \u201cpluralism\u201d and \u201crelativism\u201d mark an\nimportant or widely agreed-upon distinction (S. Shapiro 2014: 1).\n",
