These\nanswers are couched in terms of molecular level phenomena and they\nprovide much of the basic theory associated with molecular\ngenetics.\n\nWhat is a gene?  This question is dealt with\nat further length in section 4 of this article, but a quick answer\nsuffices for present purposes: genes are linear sequences of\nnucleotides in DNA molecules. Each DNA molecule consists of a double\nchain of nucleotides. There are four kinds of nucleotides in DNA:\nguanine, cytosine, thymine, and adenine. The pair of nucleotide chains\nin a DNA molecule twist around one another in the form of a double\nhelix. The two chains in the helix are bound by hydrogen bonds between\nnucleotides from adjacent chains. The hydrogen bonding is specific so\nthat a guanine in one chain is always located next to cytosine in the\nadjacent chain (and vice-versa) and thymine in one chain is always\nlocated next to adenine (and vice-versa). Hence, the linear sequence of\nnucleotides in one chain of nucleotides in a DNA molecule is\ncomplimentary to the linear sequence of nucleotides in the other chain\nof the DNA molecule. A gene is a segment of nucleotides in one of\nthe chains of a DNA molecule. Of course, not every string of\nnucleotides in DNA is a gene; segments of DNA are identified as genes\naccording to what they do (see below).\n\nHow are genes replicated? The idea that genes are\nsegments in a DNA double helix provides a straightforward answer to\nthis question. Genes are faithfully replicated when the paired chains\nof a DNA molecule unwind and new chains are formed along side the\nseparating strands by the pairing of complementary nucleotides. When\nthe process is complete, two copies of the original double helix have\nbeen formed and hence the genes in the original DNA molecule have been\neffectively replicated.\n\nWhat do genes do? Roughly speaking, genes serve as\ntemplates in the synthesis of RNA molecules. The result is that the\nlinear sequence of nucleotides in a newly synthesized RNA molecule\ncorresponds to the linear sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment\nused as the template. Different RNA molecules play different functional\nroles in the cell, and many RNA molecules play the role of template in\nthe synthesis of polypeptide molecules. Newly synthesized polypeptides\nare linear sequences of amino acids that constitute proteins and\nproteins play a wide variety of functional roles in the cell and\norganism (and environment). The ability of a polypeptide to function in\nspecific ways depends on the linear sequence of amino acids of which it\nis formed. And this linear sequence corresponds to the linear sequence\nof triplets of nucleotides in RNA (codons), which in turn corresponds\nto the linear sequence of nucleotides in segments of DNA, and this\nlatter segment is the gene for that polypeptide.\n\nHow do differences in genes bring about differences in\nphenotypic traits? The modest answer given above to the\nquestion \u2018What do genes do?\u2019\nprovides the basis for explaining how differences in genes can bring\nabout differences in phenotypic traits. A difference in the nucleotide\nsequence of a gene will result in the difference in the nucleotide\nsequence of RNA molecules, which in turn can result in a difference in\nthe amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. Differences in the linear\nsequences of amino acids in polypeptides (and in the linear sequences\nof nucleotides in functional RNA molecules) can affect the roles they\nplay in the cell and organism, sometimes having an effect that is\nobservable as a phenotypic difference. The mutations (differences in\ngenes) identified by the Morgan group (e.g., the purple mutation) have\nbeen routinely identified as differences in nucleotide sequences in\nDNA.\n",
