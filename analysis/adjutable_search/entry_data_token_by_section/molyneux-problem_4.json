Biographers and\ncommentators dealing with well-known philosophers have analysed the\nsolutions they proposed for it. Molyneux\u2019s problem has also\nturned up frequently in textbooks and general histories of psychology,\nophthalmology, neurophysiology, etcetera (and also in publications on\ndiverse disciplines, like mathematics, architecture, literature, arts\nand sports). A few authors have written brief and incomplete histories\nof the problem. Degenaar (1996) has written a comprehensive survey of\nthe history of the discussion about Molyneux\u2019s problem. Riskin\n(2002) described Molyneux\u2019s problem in the wider context of the\nEnlightenment.\n\nPhilosophers, psychologists and other scientists have also tried to\nsolve the Molyneux problem by making use of alternative approaches,\nboth old and new. They have, for example, made use of various accounts\nof recovery from early blindness. As was to be expected, these proved\nto be as problematic and inconclusive as were their predecessors in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nThe Molyneux problem has also been tackled by methods more amenable to\nexperimental control than is possible in clinical studies, namely by\nrearing animals in darkness. Visual deprivation experiments have shown\nthat during the development of the visual system there is a certain\ncritical period in connection with the presentation of light patterns.\nDuring this period, changes brought about by deprivation can be\nreversed. If exposure to light is postponed for too long, however, the\ndevelopment of normal visual mechanisms will be extremely difficult,\nif not impossible. Although the results of deprivation experiments are\nnot relevant to the solution of Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem\u2014Molyneux supposed that his blind man had a good visual\nsystem, whereas that of deprived animals is abnormal\u2014they have\nbeen used as evidence for Locke\u2019s position.\n\nA different approach to Molyneux\u2019s problem involves the use of\nsensory substitution devices, developed in the context of corporeal\nmobility or reading (Morgan, 1977). Learning how to use sensory\nsubstitution systems has been considered a good approximation to\nMolyneux\u2019s problem, since such systems present information\nnormally handled by one modality, such as vision, to another sense,\ntypically audition or touch, using forms of coding novel to the user.\nExperiments with sensory substitution systems show that subjects need\nsome time to learn to distinguish and identify objects, and this has\nbeen interpreted as a confirmation of the position of Molyneux and\nLocke. Some researchers have stressed the fact that a sensory aid is\nnot, strictly speaking, a new modality, and that to learn to use such\ndevices is only an approximation to Molyneux\u2019s problem,\ndepending as it does upon the raising of similar issues.\n\nAnother variation of Molyneux\u2019s problem was suggested by Evans\n(1985). He wondered whether the visual cortex of a patient with\ncongenital blindness could be electrically stimulated in such a way\nthat the patient experiences a pattern of light flashes (phosphenes)\nin the shape of a square or circle. This question has been\ninvestigated experimentally, but the results do not provide a final\nanswer to Molyneux\u2019s question (see Jacomuzzi, Kobau and Bruno\n2003 for discussion).\n\nMore recently, Gallagher (2005, ch. 7) argued that modern\ndevelopmental psychology and neurophysiology suggest that\nLocke\u2019s reaction to Molyneux\u2019s question was right, but for\nthe wrong reasons.\n\nA more or less straightforward attempt to answer Molyneux\u2019s\nquestion empirically has been carried out during the last decade. One\nreason that Molyneux\u2019s problem could be posed in the first place\nis the dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended\ncongenital blindness. It has been estimated that less than twenty\ncases have been found in the last 1000 years (Valvo 1971). In Western\ncountries the vast majority of cases of curable congenital blindness\nare detected in infancy and treated as early as possible. However,\nmany congenitally blind children in developing countries often do not\nreceive treatment despite having curable conditions because of\ninadequate medical services. In 2003, Pawan Sinha set up a program in\nIndia as a part of which he treated five patients, aged from 8 to 17\nyears, that almost instantly took them from total congenital blindness\nto fully seeing. This provided an opportunity to answer\nMolyneux\u2019s problem empirically. Based on this study, it was\nconcluded that the answer to Molyneux\u2019s question is likely\nnegative. Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could\ndistinguish between objects visually as effectively as they would do\nby touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between object\nperceived using the two different senses. The results of the\ntouch-to-vision tests were barely better than if the subjects had\nguessed. However, such cross-modal mappings developed rapidly, in the\ncourse of a few days (Held, et al., 2011). \n\nA fruitful tendency is taking Molyneux\u2019s problem to be a cluster\nof\n subproblems[3]\n or generating different versions of or variations on Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem (e.g. Glenney, 2013 and Matthen and Cohen, 2020). \n\nA valuable contribution to the discussion about Molyneux\u2019s\nProblem is Ferretti and Glenney (2021), a collection of one poem and\ntwenty essays that explore the long-standing issues Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem presents to philosophy of mind, perception and the senses. It\nconsiders the question from an interdisciplinary angle, examines its\npre-history, and perspectives from religion and disability. The essays\nare arranged around five criticisms: (1) Molyneux\u2019s\nappropriation of the question from another source; (2) the\nencouragement of bias against people with blindness, a social failure\ncalled ocularism; (3) a lack of specificity resulting in ambiguity as\nto what might count as a satisfying answer; (4) a crude generality\nthat belies the underlying complexity of vision and touch; and (5) the\nincapability to be experimentally testable, though presumably designed\nto be so (Ferretti and Glenney, 2021, p. 2).\n",
