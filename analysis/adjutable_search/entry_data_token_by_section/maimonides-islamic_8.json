    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Epistemology\n6.1 Epistemology\n\n\nOn the epistemological/psychological details of active intellect,\nMaimonides appears to follow a Farabian tradition in at least some\nrespects. With Aristotle, al-Farabi describes the goal of human\nexistence as the attainment of happiness.  Al-Farabi goes on to\ndescribe this state of human perfection in at least partly passive\nterms\u2014as something which is \u201cgiven to the possible beings\ncapable of receiving it \u201d (PR, N1 35). In this context, the\n\u201cgiver\u201d emerges as active intellect. Al-Farabi describes\nthe purpose of active intellect as \u201ctrue and supreme happiness\n\u201d (PR, N1 38), and further clarifies that the human being can\nhave this happiness \u201conly when the active intellect first gives\nthe first intelligibles, which constitute the primary\nknowledge\u2026\u201d (PR, N1 35).\n\n\nFor al-Farabi and Avicenna, as for Maimonides, this\n\u201cgiving\u201d activity of active intellect is described in\nparticular as an emanative overflow, and is seen as foundational to\nthe activity of human knowing.  Contrasting human intellection from\nGod's own fully actualized state of intellection (see above),\nal-Farabi follows Aristotle and speaks of the actualization process of\nhuman intellect as requiring an activating cause:\n\n\n\u2026neither the rational faculty nor what is provided in man by\nnature has the wherewithal to become of itself intellect in actuality.\nTo become intellect in actuality it needs something else which\ntransfers it from potentiality to actuality\u2026 (PS IV.13.1, W\n199).\n\n\n\nThe activating cause needed to bring man from a state of potential to\na state of actual knowing is the active intellect (sometimes\ntranslated as \u201cagent\u201d intellect). Rooted in Aristotle's\nown account of soul at De Anima 3.5 (BWA, 591), this idea\nstands as a cornerstone to Islamic\u2014and\nMaimonidean\u2014philosophical theories of epistemology, prophecy,\nand even afterlife and immortality. How to best interpret what\nAristotle is actually trying to say at De Anima 3.5 need not\nconcern us. Looking, rather, for the features of Aristotle's text\nwhich served as a basis for various Islamic philosophical accounts of\nactive intellect, we find Aristotle's description of a\n\u201cseparable \u201d (BWA 592), essentially \u201cactive\u201d\n(BWA 592) intellect \u201cwithout [which] nothing\n thinks,\u201d[19]\n an \u201cimpassible,\u201d and\n\u201cunmixed\u201d state of intellect, furthermore described by\nAristotle not only as \u201cimmortal and eternal\u201d (BWA 592) but\nas the perfected reality of the human mind once it is \u201cset free\nfrom its present conditions \u201d (BWA 592). \n\n\nIn thinking about the Islamic philosophical context to Maimonides\u2019\nepistemology, we can talk broadly of the influence on his thought of\nIslamic Neoplatonized Aristotelian theories of Active Intellect: Human\nknowledge-formation relies on the activity of this lowest of the\nseparate intellects. It is important, though, to keep in mind some\nimportant Islamic philosophical points of difference in considering\nMaimonides\u2019 context: Starting with al-Farabi and Avicenna, both\nenvision Active Intellect as a key reality outside of God and outside\nof the human mind which plays a key role in the human process of\nknowledge-formation. Following Taylor, however (see Taylor 2012), we\nmight note that while Avicenna sees the ideas contained within Active\nIntellect as the source for the human intellect\u2019s own ideas, al-Farabi\nsees the Active Intellect as merely preparing a person\u2019s mind to\nabstract ideas from her sensory encounter with the material\nworld\u2014an idea, as Taylor points out, found too in\nThemistius\u2019 Paraphrase of the De Anima in which he speaks of a\n\u201cseparate agent intellect which contains all the forms [and\nwhich] comes to be in the human agent intellect empowering and guiding\nits action\u201d (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources). Summarizing this divide between al-Farabi and Avicena in\nanother way, we might note that while al-Farabi upholds a doctrine of\nabstraction by which the human mind receives content from the outside\nworld, Avicenna instead treats the mind as receiving representations\nof the intelligibles from the Active Intellect. Taylor\u2014citing\nBurnyeat 2008\u2014reminds us (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources) that there is actually no doctrine of abstraction in\nAristotle; that said, we may nonetheless speak of al-Farabi\u2019s more\nAristotelian (because more sensory and world-reliant) approach to\nknowledge as opposed to Avicenna\u2019s more Platonic/Neoplatonic approach\naccording to which humans receive ideas from \u201con high\u201d so\nto speak (in the case of Plato from the realm of forms, in the case of\nPlotinus from the universal intellect, and in the case of Avicenna\nfrom the active intellect). Taylor also emphasizes the\nrepresentationalist aspect of Avicenna\u2019s view: it is not the active\nintellect\u2019s intelligibles that enter into the human mind, but rather\nrepresentations of those intelligibles (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources).\n\n\nTurning to Averroes\u2019 mature view (as found in his Long Commentary\non De Anima), he advances the idea not only of a shared active\nintellect, but of a shared material intellect, revealing, as Taylor\nargues, elements of al-Farabi and Themistius in his sense of the\nactive intellect\u2019s role in enabling the human intellect to reliably\nabstract from the outside world. In this sense, Averroes rejects the\nAvicennian sense of active intellect emanating ideas into the human\nmind. (Note: Taylor points to the further vestige of Themistius in\nAverroes\u2019 argument that shared human discourse necessitates belief in\na shared intellect.)  Along similar lines, Averroes rejects the\nPlatonic/Neoplatonic description\u2014found in both al-Farabi and\nAvicenna\u2014of active intellect as a repository of ideas. Averroes\ninstead focuses on active intellect as a \u201cform for us\u201d, in\nthe sense, says Taylor, of \u201cintrinsically operating within\nus\u201d (Taylor 2005, 29)\u2014though not in the sense of\nsuggesting that there is either an active intellect or a material\nintellect for each person, and also while maintaining that active and\nmaterial intellect are themselves completely separate intellects. For\nAverroes, there is for all humans one shared separate active intellect\nand one shared separate material intellect, with the activation of\nabstraction taking place in the shared active intellect and the\nreception of the abstracted intelligibles taking place in the shared\nmaterial intellect. In using her soul\u2019s powers correctly the human\nbeing is able to benefit from these processes of abstraction and\nreception, in this way moving from a state of sensation to a state of\nknowledge. Even with the involvement of shared separate active and\nmaterial intellects, Averroes describes the process as intrinsic to\nthe individual human soul and as active intellect becoming \u201cform\nfor us\u201d (itself understood as the human\u2019s final end) in a true\nconjunction or uniting of the individual human soul with the active\nintellect. (In fact, it is precisely this intimate\nrelation/conjunction/unification that Averroes find lacking in\nal-Farabi\u2019s (and we might add, Avicenna\u2019s) view of active intellect as\nsimply emanating data into the human soul; see Taylor 2005, 26-31.) As\nTaylor summarizes this view in Averroes: \u201cWe must use our powers\nof sense, imagination, cogitation and memory to form particular\nrefined intentions, intelligibles in potency, for presentation to the\nagent intellect [i.e. the active intellect] for abstraction, that is,\nfor transference to the higher level of being intelligibles in act,\nand for the attendant impression upon the receptive material\nintellect\u201c (Taylor 2005, 31). (For further insights on Averroes\u2019\nepistemology, see for example: Taylor 1998, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009,\n2011, 2012b (Other Internet Resources); Wolfson 1958; Kogan 1985;\nDavidson 1992; Kaplan 1977; Twetten 1995).\n\n\nIn approaching Maimonides\u2019 own writings, it is important to keep in\nmind competing epistemological views at play in his Islamic\nphilosophical context. In this way we can continue to work to\ndetermine which of al-Farabi, Avicenna, or Averroes is more\ninfluential on his epistemological thinking, and what\u2014if\nany\u2014broader religious and philosophical implications that might\nhave for how we view his work.\n\nWe might here also consider the extent and nature of Maimonides\u2019 view\non the limits of human knowledge (a point about which there is much\nscholarship and much debate); in two classical essays by Altmann and\nPines on this topic, the Islamic influences on Maimonides of\nal-Farabi, ibn Bajja, Avicenna, and Averroes are explored (see Altmann\n1987 and Pines 1979).\n",
