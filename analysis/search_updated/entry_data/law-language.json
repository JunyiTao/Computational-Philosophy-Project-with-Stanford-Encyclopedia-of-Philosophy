    "preamble": "\n\nThe use of language is crucial to any legal system, not only in the\nsame way that it is crucial to politics in general, but also in two\nspecial respects. Lawmakers characteristically use language to make\nlaw, and law must provide for the authoritative resolution of disputes\nover the effects of that use of language. Political philosophers are\nnot generally preoccupied with questions in the philosophy of\nlanguage. But legal philosophers are political philosophers with a\nspecialization that gives language (and philosophy of language) a\nspecial\n importance.[1]\n\nPhilosophy of law can gain from a good philosophical account of the\nmeaning and use of language, and from a good philosophical account of\nthe institutionalized resolution of disputes over language. Philosophy\nof language can gain from studying the stress-testing of language in\nlegal regulation and dispute resolution. And philosophers of language\ncan gain from the reminder that their task is not only to account for\nwhat people share in virtue of the mastery of a language; they also\nneed to account for the possibility of disagreements over the meaning\nand use of language, and for the possibility that there might be good\nreason for resolving those disagreements in one way rather than\nanother.\n\nAfter a brief historical note on the linguistic preoccupations of\nlegal philosophers in section 1, section 2 outlines the relation\nbetween the law of a jurisdiction and the language with which law can\nbe made and in which it can be expressed.

Section 4 addresses the\nimplications for legal philosophy of the widespread use of evaluative\nlanguage in law, and section 5 addresses the implications for legal\nphilosophy of the widespread use of vague language in law.

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical introduction\n\nSystematic efforts to use philosophical insights about language to\nsolve problems in philosophy of law are relatively recent. Jeremy\nBentham was perhaps the first to make a deliberate attempt at it. He\ndeveloped a radically empiricist theory of the meaning of words, which\nsupported his utilitarianism and his legal theory.\n\nBentham wanted to abandon what he considered to be a nonsensical\nmythology of natural rights and duties\u2014that is, moral rights and\nduties that people have regardless of whether anyone is prepared to\nenforce them. He wanted, instead, to explain the nature of law by\nreference to \u2018sensible\u2019 phenomena (Bentham 1782, 251\u20132,\n283n.). Linguistic acts struck him as respectably empirical phenomena,\nand he made them an essential element of his theory of law. He based\nhis\n \u2018legal positivism\u2019\n on his claims about the meaning and use of words.\n\nLanguage had not been especially important to the\n natural law\n theorists whose views Bentham despised. They accounted for a law as a\ncertain sort of reason. From that perspective, philosophy of language\nhas no special role in explaining the nature of law. Philosophy of\nlanguage cannot explain the nature of reasons; it has the ancillary\nrole of explaining the possibility of communicating reasons and the\npossibility of creating reasons by the use of language (so that\nnatural law theorists have the same reason as others to seek a good\naccount of the legal effects of the use of language, and of the role\nof courts in resolving disputes over it). Bentham, by contrast,\nfastened on the \u2018sensible\u2019 phenomenon of a perceptible,\nintelligible linguistic act for his purpose of expounding the nature\nof law by reference to empirical phenomena.\n\nBentham seems to have thought of the meaning of a word in causal\nterms, as its capacity to act on a subject by raising an image of\nperceptible substances or emotions for which, he said, the word was a\nname. \u2018By these general terms or names, things and persons,\nacts, and so forth are brought to view\u2026\u2019 (Bentham 1782,\n82; see also Bentham 1776, 28, 108n). Words that do not bring to view\nsuch perceptible things have no meaning, on his theory, except insofar\nas they can be expounded by\n\u2018paraphrasis\u2019\u2014Bentham\u2019s method of translating\nwhole sentences in which those words are used into sentences that do\nraise images of perceptible things.\n\nTo many legal theorists that approach appeared, as H.L.A. Hart put it,\n\u2018as a revelation, bringing down to earth an elusive notion and\nrestating it in the same clear, hard, empirical terms as are used in\nscience\u2019 (Hart 2012, 84). The theory supported not only\nBentham\u2019s empiricism, but also his utilitarianism, because it\nprivileged what he viewed as the ultimate sensible (and therefore\nintelligible) \u2018affections\u2019: the pain and pleasure that\nutilitarianism treats as the basis for a theory of value and of\nmorality.\n\nIn his legal theory, this view of language became the basis of an\ninnovative account of law as the expression of the will of a sovereign\nin a political community. Bentham stated it as follows:\n\nA law may be defined as an assemblage of signs declarative of a\nvolition conceived or adopted by the sovereign in a state,\nconcerning the conduct to be observed in a certain case by a\ncertain person or class of persons, who in the case in question are or\nare supposed to be subject to his power\u2026 (Bentham 1782, 1)\n\n\nHe went on to explain that the signification of volition by such an\nassemblage of signs must be backed by \u2018motives\u2019 of pain or\npleasure offered by the sovereign.\n\nTwo features of this theory tie the philosophy of law to the\nphilosophy of language. One feature is methodological, and the other\nis substantive. First, Bentham proposes his theory as a definition of\nthe term a law (see section 6.1 below, on \u2018Definition\nas a methodology in philosophy of law\u2019). Secondly, he defines a\nlaw as a particular kind of assemblage of signs (see section 2.1\nbelow, on \u2018Law and Signs\u2019). In Bentham\u2019s view, a law\nis an assemblage of signs, and legal philosophy is a form of\nphilosophy of language. The legal theorist has a linguistic task of\ndefining the terms (especially law, but others as well) of\nlegal discourse.\n\nThat, in brief, is the apogee of the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law. Bentham was ahead of his time. His theory of the\nmeaning and use of words anticipated various trends in\ntwentieth-century philosophy of language (including Frege\u2019s and\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u2018context principle\u2019, some views of\nlogical positivists, and the development of speech act theory). It was\nH.L.A.Hart who, in the 1950s and 1960s, made a concerted effort to use\ntwentieth-century developments in philosophy of language to\n\u2018elucidate\u2019 the nature of law. He did so with an\nenthusiasm for the work of Wittgenstein, and also of the Oxford\nphilosophers J.L.Austin and Paul Grice. So Hart had some advantages\nover Bentham. Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations had been directed against the view that a\nword\u2019s meaning is the thing for which it stands as a name. That\nwas one of the misconceptions that distorted Bentham\u2019s theory of\nthe meaning of words: he thought that a word like \u2018right\u2019\nhad to be a name for an entity, and that since no such entity could be\nsensed, the word was a name for a \u2018fictitious\nentity\u2019 (Bentham 1782, 251). And J.L.Austin took an\nattitude to ordinary discourse that was quite opposed to that of\nBentham, who thought that philosophy must tear away the \u2018veil of\nmystery\u2019 that ordinary language throws over every object of\nstudy (Bentham 1782, 251). Wittgenstein\u2019s attitude was more\ncomplex: he thought both that philosophers create philosophical\nproblems by bewitching themselves with language, and also that a clear\nunderstanding of the use of language could provide healthy therapy for\npeople suffering from philosophical problems. Taking advantage of the\ninsights of Wittgenstein and J.L.Austin, Hart aimed to put philosophy\nof language to work in addressing problems of legal philosophy,\nwithout making what he regarded as Bentham\u2019s extravagant\nmistakes.\n\nIn 1961, Hart\u2019s book The Concept of Law raised issues\nthat have occupied legal philosophers ever since. He borrowed J.L.\nAustin\u2019s method of \u2018using a sharpened awareness of words\nto sharpen our perception of the phenomena\u2019 (Hart 2012, v, 14).\nHart\u2019s observations about the use of language in law were\nelements in an innovative approach to explaining the normativity of\nlaw\u2014that is, the fact that law presents itself as conferring\nrights and powers and as imposing obligations and liabilities. Hart\nargued that we can understand that feature of law more clearly, if we\nunderstand where Bentham and his nineteenth-century disciple\n John Austin\n (not to be confused with J.L.Austin) went wrong in explaining the\nmeaning and use of normative language. Hart\u2019s new approach to\nthe issue has been a starting point for discussions of the normativity\nof law since the 1960s (see section 6.2 below).\n\nRonald Dworkin argued that Hart\u2019s focus on language had a toxic\neffect on legal philosophy. He wrote that Hart suffered from a\n\u2018semantic sting\u2019, because he wrongly thought \u2018that\nlawyers all follow certain linguistic criteria for judging\npropositions of law\u2019 (Dworkin 1986b, 45; see section 6.1 below).\nThat argument in the philosophy of language has set an agenda for much\ndebate in philosophy of law (see, for example, the essays in Coleman,\n2001).\n\nBecause of the allure of philosophy of language, and partly as a\nresult of the influence of Hart, the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law became the focus of much jurisprudential thought and\ndebate in the 20th century. One notable example is the work of Jerzy\nWr\u00f3blewski, a Polish legal theorist who developed a\n\u2018semantic conception of a legal norm\u2019 (Wr\u00f3blewski\n1983), and offered a theory of legal language as a sub-type of natural\nlanguage with multiple \u2018fuzzy\u2019 characteristics\n(Wr\u00f3blewski 1985). In Italian analytical legal philosophy, the\ninfluential theorist Norberto Bobbio began in the 1950s \u2018to\nconsider law as a language and legal science as a meta-language\u2019\n(Pintore and Jori 1997, 3), in service of a theory of law based on a\nnon-cognitivist moral theory. Two succeeding generations of Italian\nlegal theorists have engaged in \u2018dispute on semiotic ground,\nrather than directly by arguments of general legal philosophical\npositions\u2019 (Pintore and Jori, 17).\n\nThat development was one instance of the widespread use of views about\nlanguage in debunking conventional views about law in the 20th\ncentury. Perhaps this development resulted not so much from the\ninfluence of Bentham\u2019s own writings, as from pursuit of the same\nsearch that he undertook, for ways of identifying the elements of law\nthat suit empiricist philosophical sensibilities. The energetic\n20th-century school of \u2018Scandinavian legal realism\u2019 viewed\nlegal terms like \u2018right\u2019 as \u2018lacking semantic\nreference\u2019 and \u2018denoting nothing\u2019. So they\nconsidered statements asserting the existence of rights, duties, and\nother legal relations to be incapable of being true or false\n(Olivecrona 1971, 246, 255, 261). They variously explained the use of\nsuch statements as attempts to perform magical incantations, or as\ntools for taking advantage of the psychological conditioning that\nleads officials and citizens to act in one way or another when they\nhear such statements (see the outline of Scandinavian realism in\nOlivecrona 1971, 174\u2013182, and see Ross 1956; see also section\n5.1 of the entry on\n naturalism in legal philosophy).\n\nSimilarly, various strands in the influential American legal academic\nenterprise of \u2018economic analysis of law\u2019 share\nBentham\u2019s debunking attitude toward central legal terms such as\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018obligation\u2019. Like Bentham, some\neconomic analysts oscillate (or equivocate) between (1) a moral theory\nthat reduces those normative terms to terms describing maximization of\nhuman satisfactions, and (2) a theory that does not engage in moral\nargument, but only claims to describe human motivation, accounting for\nterms such as \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018obligation\u2019 as\nrhetorical epithets that agents use to pursue what they will (see the\nentry on the\n economic analysis of law,\n section 2.2).\n\nNot all legal sceptics have been driven by the empiricism of Bentham\nand the Scandinavians. Many other forms of scepticism about law have\nalso sought support in scepticism about the meaning of language.\nAttacks on the coherence of the idea of the rule of law, and on the\nmeaningfulness of legal discourse, have used ideas in the philosophy\nof language as diverse as Saul Kripke\u2019s interpretation of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on rule following (see section 3.1 of the\nentry on\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning),\n and deconstruction (see Endicott 2000, chapter 1).\n2. The use of language in law\n2.1 Law and signs\n\nThere are insurmountable objections to Bentham\u2019s idea that a law\nis an assemblage of signs. Law (in the sense that is relevant here) is\nthe systematic regulation of the life of a community by standards\ntreated as binding the members of the community and its institutions.\nA law is a standard that is part of such a systematic form of\nregulation. Many such standards have no canonical linguistic\nformulation (that is, no form of words which, according to law,\ndetermines the content of the standard). Lawyers in common law systems\nare familiar with such norms: murder may be a criminal offence (or\nslander may be a tort, or certain agreements may be enforceable as\ncontracts\u2026), not because of the expression by any person or\ninstitution of a rule that it should be so, but because the\ninstitutions of the legal system customarily treat murder as an\noffence (or slander as a tort...). Moreover, common law systems cannot\nbe distinguished from legal systems consisting only of linguistic\nacts, because no legal system consists only of linguistic acts. A\ncivil law system with a civil code and a criminal code may make murder\nan offence (and slander a tort\u2026) by a written act, and it may\nbe a written constitution that gives legal force to the civil code and\nto the criminal code. But the validity of the written constitution\nwill depend on a norm which is not created by the use of signs: the\nrule that the constitution makers\u2019 act of using that\ntext to set out the constitution is to be treated as\n authoritative.[2]\n\nBentham and John Austin knew that there are rules of law that were not\nlaid down in language. Preserving their view of law as signification\nof volition, they accounted for such laws as tacit commands\nof the sovereign. That convoluted device cannot provide the resources\nneeded to explain the existence of a norm. In the right circumstances,\nit is certainly possible to communicate without using signs (and in\nparticular, it is possible to convey a volition, backed by a threat of\nforce, just by saying or writing nothing). But silence can only be a\nmeans of communication when the circumstances give it a meaning. We\ncan say that a tacit command has been issued only if it is possible to\nidentify features of the situation that distinguish the tacit\ncommunication from mere inaction communicating nothing (see Hart 2012,\n45\u201348). Those features do not generally accompany customary\nrules (in fact, they generally do not accompany customary rules).\n\nThere is another conclusive objection to the idea that a law is an\nassemblage of signs. When a lawmaking authority does use language to\nmake a law (as when a legislature uses a lawful process to pass an\nenactment that is within its powers), the resulting law is not an\nassemblage of signs. When I write you an email message to make a\nrequest, the message is an assemblage of signs, but the request is not\nan assemblage of signs; I used the assemblage of signs to make it. The\nlaw that results from the use of language in an enactment is a norm or\nnorms whose existence and content are determined by the legal effect\nthat the law ascribes to that use of an assemblage of signs (see Von\nWright 1963, Chapter VI, on the distinction between norm formulations\nand norms).\n\nA law, therefore, is not an assemblage of signs, and law is not\nnecessarily made by the use of language, and every legal system has\nnorms that were not made by the use of language. Laws are not\nlinguistic acts. Laws, you may say, are standards of behaviour that\ncan be communicated (and some of which are made) by using language.\nBut even this is controversial among writers on legal\ninterpretation.\n2.2 Language and legal interpretation\n\nWhat is the relationship between the language that is used to make\nlegal standards, and the law itself? If the law provides that a form\nof words determines the content of a standard (such as a term of a\ncontract, or a criminal offence, or a duty of the executor of a will),\nwhat is the effect of the use of the words? The question seems to\ndemand general theories of the meaning of language and of the\ninterpretation of communicative acts. If there are no general theories\nto be had, then there is no general answer to the question. A theory\nof meaning and interpretation of legal language would not be very much\nless general than a theory of meaning and interpretation of\nlanguage.\n\nLegal theorists have tried to construct theories of the meaning of\nlegal language, and theories of legal interpretation, based on\nspecific features of law, of legal systems, and of the use of language\nin making law. The entries on\n constitutionalism\n (see section 7, \u2018Constitutional Interpretation\u2019),\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning,\n legal interpretation,\n legal interpretivism,\n the nature of law, and\n naturalism in legal philosophy\n all address theories of legal interpretation. This section addresses\nfeatures of language that raise challenges for philosophy of law and\nfor philosophy of language. Any good account of the legal effect of\nthe use of language in law making depends on the context of its use\n(addressed in this section). Section 2.3 addresses\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 effects of language use, such as\ncontext-dependence, which have long been the matter of jurisprudential\ndebate; recently the use of Gricean and post-Gricean\n pragmatics\n has become a major field of debate among philosophers of language and\nphilosophers of law. These pragmatic features of communication raise\ninsuperable difficulties for any attempt to give a true account of\nlegal interpretation that is well enough organised to deserve to be\ncalled a \u2018theory\u2019. Debates over the pragmatics of legal\nlanguage are often premised on the view that the effect of a lawmaking\nuse of language is that the content of the linguistic communication in\nquestion determines the content of the law. But we will see in section\n3 that even this premise is controversial; it has been denied by\ntheorists who account for the law as being determined by moral reasons\nfor conclusions as to what rights, duties, powers, and liabilities\npeople have, given the facts of legal practice and history.\n\nAs an instance of controversy over the effect of the use of language\nin law, consider the case of Garner v Burr [1951] 1 KB 31.\nThe legislature had made it an offence to use a \u2018vehicle\u2019\non a road without pneumatic tires. Lawrence Burr fitted iron wheels to\nhis chicken coop, and pulled it down the road behind his tractor. Burr\nwas prosecuted under the statute. The magistrates acquitted him,\napparently on the ground that a chicken coop is not a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019. The appeal court reversed that decision. The\nLord Chief Justice wrote,\n\nThe regulations are designed for a variety of reasons, among them the\nprotection of road surfaces; and, as this vehicle had ordinary iron\ntyres, not pneumatic tyres, it was liable to damage the roads. [The\nmagistrates] have put what is in my opinion too narrow an\ninterpretation on the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purposes of\nthis Act. It is true that, according to the dictionary definition, a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 is primarily to be regarded as a means of\nconveyance provided with wheels or runners and used for the carriage\nof persons or goods. It is true that the [magistrates] do not find\nthat anything was carried in the vehicle at the time; but I think that\nthe Act is clearly aimed at anything which will run on wheels which is\nbeing drawn by a tractor or another motor vehicle. Accordingly, an\noffence was committed here. It follows that [the magistrates] ought to\nhave found that this poultry shed was a vehicle within the meaning of\ns. 1 of the Road Traffic Act of 1930. ([1951] 1 KB 31 at 33)\n\n\nThe magistrates and the appeal court seem to have disagreed over the\neffect of two principles: a principle that statutes should only be\nread as imposing criminal liability if they do so unequivocally, and a\nprinciple that the purposes for which Parliament passed the statute\nshould be pursued. Assume that those principles are legal\nprinciples, in the sense that a decision in accordance with the law\nmust respect them. The apparent tension between the principles might\nbe resolved in one of the following two ways. We do not have the\nmagistrates\u2019 reasons, but let\u2019s presume that they resolved\nthe tension in the first way; the appeal court resolved it in the\nsecond way:\n\n1. by concluding that Parliament\u2019s purposes can be respected\nappropriately while still construing the prohibition narrowly (so that\nit is no offence to pull a chicken coop down the road on iron wheels,\nbecause the chicken coop is not undeniably a vehicle), or\n\n\n2. by concluding that Parliament\u2019s purpose is sufficiently clear\nthat it can be pursued by convicting Mr.Burr, without jeopardising the\nprinciple that criminal liabilities ought to be clearly spelled out,\neven if someone might reasonably claim that a chicken coop on wheels\nis not a \u2018vehicle\u2019.\n\n\nIt may seem that this common sort of disagreement tells us nothing\nabout language, except perhaps that language is of no particular\nimportance in law. It may seem that the two courts did not disagree\nover any question of language (after all, everyone involved was\ncompetent in English), but only over whether they ought to give effect\nto Parliament\u2019s evident purpose of protecting roads by\nconvicting Mr.Burr, or whether that would be unfair to him.\n\nOne explanation of the decision would be that the appeal court ignored\nthe word \u2018vehicle\u2019, and treated the pneumatic tires rule\nas if it applied to anything that moves on wheels (instead of applying\nto vehicles, which is what the legislation said). But the Lord Chief\nJustice did not explain his decision that way. He did not hold that,\nbecause Parliament aimed to protect roads from iron wheels, Burr\nshould be convicted regardless of the meaning of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019. He held that the magistrates ought to have\nfound that the chicken coop was a vehicle, \u2018for the\npurposes\u2019 of the Road Traffic Act. Presumably the magistrates,\ntoo, considered themselves to be giving effect to the language of the\nAct, rather than ignoring (in the interests of fairness) what\nParliament had enacted.\n\nNo doubt, legal decisionmakers sometimes depart from what the\nlegislature provided in a valid enactment (or a testator provided in a\nvalid will...). They may do so corruptly, or in the exercise of an\nequitable jurisdiction to depart from the law, or because they\nconsider that justice demands it even if the law accords them no power\nto depart from the enactment or the will. But in Garner v\nBurr, the magistrates and the appeal judges evidently saw\nthemselves as giving effect to the Road Traffic Act. And the sort of\ndisagreement that arose in that case (disagreement over the legal\neffect of the use of a word) is so common that we seem to find a\nparadox:\n\nThe apparent paradox of legislative language:\n\nCompetent speakers of the English language share a knowledge of the\nmeaning of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019, and the law that is made by\nlegislation using the word must be determined by the meaning of the\nword, yet English speakers disagree\u2014apparently\nsincerely\u2014over the effect of legislation using the word.\n\n\nTo resolve the apparent paradox of legislative language, we can say\nthat what speakers of the English language share, in virtue of their\ngrasp of the meaning of a word like \u2018vehicle\u2019, is an\nability to use the word in a way that depends on the context. The\nquestion of whether a chicken coop on wheels counts as a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 would be a different question (and might have a\ndifferent answer), if another statute or regulation imposed a tax on\n\u2018vehicles\u2019. The relevant considerations might be different\nagain if a statute or regulation required \u2018vehicles\u2019 to\nkeep to the left-hand side of the road. The Lord Chief Justice was\nright that a dictionary definition of \u2018vehicle\u2019 could not\nconclude the question of whether the chicken coop was a vehicle in\nGarner v Burr, because the purpose of a dictionary definition\nis to point the reader to features of the use of the word that can be\nmore-or-less important in a variety of more-or-less analogical ways in\nvarious contexts. A definition of \u2018vehicle\u2019 as a mode of\nconveyance offers the reader one central strand in the use of that\nword, but does not tell the reader whether a more-or-less analogical\nextension of the word to a chicken coop on wheels is warranted or\nunwarranted by the meaning of the word. Another way of stating this\nresolution of the apparent paradox of legislative language is by\ndistinguishing between the meaning of a word (which the magistrates\nand the appeal judges all knew) and the way in which a communicative\nact using the word ought to be understood (over which they disagreed).\nThe judges and magistrates in Garner v Burr shared a\nknowledge of the meaning of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019; they could\nall share mastery of that word, while disagreeing over the effect of\nthe legislature\u2019s use of the word. The evident good sense of\nthat proposition has led some philosophers to theories that state or\nimply that law is not made by the use of language; see section 3\nbelow.\n2.3 The pragmatics of legal language\n\nThe dependence of the effect of legal language on context is an\ninstance of a general feature of communication, which some\nphilosophers of language have approached by distinguishing semantics\nfrom pragmatics. The distinction is, roughly, between the meaning of a\nword or phrase or other linguistic expression, and the effect that is\nto be ascribed to the use of the expression in a particular way, by a\nparticular user of the language, in a particular context. The\npragmatics of legal language is a vast field, because the term\n\u2018pragmatics\u2019 could be used as a heading for much of what\nmodern legal scholars and theorists have described as grounds for\ninterpretation. In fact, \u2018pragmatics\u2019 could also be used\nas a heading for much that they have described as the theory of\ninterpretation \u2013 since \u2018pragmatics\u2019 is a term not\nonly for effects of communication, but also for the study of those\neffects.  For example, the work of the judges in Garner v\nBurr can be described as an exercise in pragmatic inference. The\ntechnical sound of the word \u2018pragmatics\u2019 may suggest that\nit is a term for the theoretical study of its object; in fact, the\nfield of study is what might be inferred from the fact that someone\nsaid what they said in the context in which they said it. No object of\nstudy is less apt for theorising.\n\nThis vast field has been much studied over millennia by lawyers and\nphilosophers, but only recently through the use of resources that may\nbe borrowed from the 20th-century development of\n\u2018pragmatics\u2019 as a discipline in linguistics and the\nphilosophy of language. Much recent work in the pragmatics of legal\nlanguage has focused on Gricean and post-Gricean pragmatics, as a\nsource of insights into the theory of legal interpretation (see e.g.\nMarmor 2008, 2014, Soames 2008, Ekins 2012 (see especially pp\n205\u2013211), Carston 2013, Solum 2013; on Gricean and post-Gricean\npragmatics, see\n pragmatics).\n\nIt is controversial whether legal pragmatics is simply a part of the\npragmatics of language use in general (see Dascal and\nWr\u00f3blewski 1988). It stands to reason that if the pragmatics of\nlanguage use depends on the context of an utterance, the legal context\nof a lawmaking use of language will have implications for the meaning\nconveyed and, therefore, for the law that is made. Scott Soames has\nargued that the question of the relation between the content of the\nlaw and authoritative sources (such as statutes), is \u2018an\ninstance of the more general question of what determines the contents\nof ordinary linguistic texts\u2019 (Soames 2008). It is a popular\nidea that when a legislature enacts a statute, \u2018The content of\nthe statute is what the lawmakers asserted and committed themselves\nto, in adopting the statutory language\u2019 (Soames 2008). Speakers\ncan commit themselves to something that they have not asserted, and\ncan make assertions in contexts that make it clear that they are not\ncommitted to what they have asserted.\n\nBut Andrei Marmor has argued that the pragmatics of legal language is\nunique in crucial respects (Marmor 2008), with pragmatic\nconsiderations playing some very significantly lesser role in law than\nin other contexts: \u2018In ordinary conversations, pragmatic\nenrichment is the norm, not the exception; in statutory law, it is the\nexception\u2019 (Marmor 2014, 34). In his view, the Gricean maxims of\nconversation, derived from a general principle of cooperation, do not\nstraightforwardly apply in legislative communication, because\nlegislative communication is \u2018strategic\u2019 rather than\ncooperative (Marmor 2014, 45\u201357). Likewise, Francesca Poggi has argued\nthat Grice\u2019s theory does not apply to legislation, because of\nthe \u2018conflictual behaviour\u2019 of those addressed by\nlegislation (Poggi 2011, 35). As Marmor points out, speakers and\nlisteners in strategic communication take advantage of uncertainties\nin the\n implicatures\n to be derived from pragmatic norms of communication. For present\npurposes, we can think of an implicature as a proposition that a\nperson is to be understood to have conveyed by using language in a\nparticular way, although it is not expressed by what the person said\n(see Grice 1975, 43\u20134). Speakers may exploit implicatures in order to\navoid asserting what they prefer to implicate, and listeners may\nexploit uncertainties concerning implicatures in order to bend the\neffect of a communication to their liking. Yet these aspects of\ncommunication are not distinctive to law making. And they depend on\ncooperation among participants in the \u2018conversation\u2019 in\nquestion: some degree of cooperation is necessary in order for it to\nmake any sense for a speaker to take advantage of an implicature, or\nfor a listener to treat an uncertain implicature as a genuine\nimplicature.\n\n\u2018Near-side\u2019 pragmatics (for Korta and Perry\u2019s\ndistinction between \u2018near-side\u2019 and \u2018far-side\u2019\npragmatics, see\n pragmatics)\n is a matter of what is said by an utterance; in informal conversation\nit involves the use of indexicals and pronominal figures that are\navoided in legislation, and involves the implications of context for\nan understanding of the uses of terms. And \u2018far-side\u2019\npragmatics (determining what is implicated rather than said, and\ndetermining what speech acts are carried out by means of an utterance)\ncan involve figurative uses of language such as sarcasm, innuendos,\nand other techniques that lawmakers avoid. There is some force in\nMarmor\u2019s claim that pragmatics is different in law. Legislation\nsystematically avoids many communicative devices that can be so very\nuseful in other contexts of communication. But those devices are also\navoided in a wide range of other formalized and technical uses of\nlanguage\u2014for example, in most wedding invitations, in Wikipedia\narticles that have not been hacked, and in well-written instruction\nguides for applying for bank account or for operating a rice\ncooker.\n\nYet the pragmatic effects of communication are essential in all of\nthose formalised contexts of language use, and they are essential to\nthe legislative use of language. This is true both of\n\u2018near-side\u2019 and \u2018far-side\u2019 pragmatics. The\ndiscussion of the decision in Garner v Burr, above, provides\nan illustration of the ways in which the context of a legislative\nenactment can determine the reference of terms such as\n\u2018vehicle\u2019, and this determination of meaning is an aspect\nof near-side pragmatics. The dispute over the requirement of pneumatic\ntires on \u2018vehicles\u2019 in Garner v Burr can be\nunderstood as a dispute over the effect of the context on the content\nof the regulatory provision; another way of making the same point is\nto describe it as a dispute over the implicatures to be drawn from the\nfact of the enactment of that provision. This aspect of the pragmatics\nof legal language is simply an instance of the pragmatics of the use\nof language in general. It would be very easy to formulate a version\nof the apparent paradox of legislative language, discussed in section\n2.2 above, in a non-legal context: only imagine that Lawrence\nBurr\u2019s mother told him not to go driving the farm vehicles down\nher driveway without tires.\n\nThe role of far-side pragmatics is illustrated by the master\nimplicature of every legislative act: it is never said in legislation,\nbut there is always an implicature, that the rights and duties and\npowers established by the legislation are to be legal rights\nand duties and powers, under the law of the jurisdiction for which the\nenactment is made (see Endicott 2014, 55). Very many other more\nparticular lawyers\u2019 presumptions serve as maxims of the\npragmatics of lawmaking (such as the presumption that a new enactment\noverrides a contrary previous enactment).\n\nIt is worth noting, as well, that the diversity of contexts of\ncommunication (even the diversity of conversations that the same two\npeople may have, let alone all the diversity of exchanges that might\nbe called \u2018conversations\u2019 by more or less remote analogy)\nis so great that the variations among pragmatic aspects of ordinary\nconversations are much wider and deeper than any general distinction\nthat can be drawn between legislative communication as a class, and\nordinary conversations as a class. The use of language in making law\nis so closely interwoven with the use of language to exercise\nauthority in other contexts, and with the use of language in games, in\ntalk (in many different contexts) of what is right and wrong, and\ngenerally in communication in families and in organisations of every\nkind, that the pragmatics of legal language is best seen as a deeply\nintegral part of the pragmatics of the use of language in general.\n\nIt may seem otherwise, because the persons to whom laws are addressed\ncan be extraordinarily creative in finding ways of fitting the laws to\ntheir own interests, and parties to a dispute over the law tend to\ndisagree deeply over the effect of the language that has been used to\nmake law (so that it is not at all unusual for each side to end up\nwith a deeply-felt conviction that the law is so clearly on his or her\nown side, that no reasonable person could think otherwise). So it\nseems, as Marmor argues, that the use of language to make law is not\npart of a cooperative exchange between lawmakers and the persons to\nwhom their communications are addressed.\n\nFor this very reason, of course, every legal system has tribunals for\nthe resolution of legal disputes. They are always an integral part of\nthe system of governance in a state that is ruled by law, although\nthey very often have various forms of independence from other\ninstitutions of the system. The tribunals or courts typically have\nauthority to interpret the lawmaking use of language and to determine\nits effect in particular cases. Unlike the parties to a dispute,\ncourts are characteristically involved with the lawmakers in the\nenterprise of governance (even where the courts are independent), and\noften have their own lawmaking capacities. Their role in the system is\nthe substratum for a cooperative principle that has even deeper\nsignificance (and somewhat simpler implications) in the operation of a\nlegal system, than Grice\u2019s cooperative principle has in ordinary\nconversation. And, of course, that cooperative role of a court in the\nlegal system constrains the arguments of parties to a dispute: however\nstrongly they are inclined to twist the language of the law (and\nhowever strongly they may feel that the other side is twisting the\nlanguage of the law), they need an argument that will persuade an\ninstitution that is committed, at least in principle, to cooperative\ninterpretation of lawmaking acts. One way of explaining the decision\nin is to say that the Lord Chief Justice cooperated with the\nlegislature by treating the legislature as having adhered to\nGrice\u2019s Cooperative Principle: \u2018Make your conversational\ncontribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by\nthe accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you\nare engaged\u2019 (Grice 1989, 26; for discussion of the principle\nsee\n Grice).\n Sometimes, as lawyers know well, courts interpret legislation in more\nor less non-cooperative ways, and it is not hard to envisage\nlegislative pathologies (or to identify real life examples of\npathologies) that justify such an attitude on the part of judges. If\ncourts take a generally non-cooperative attitude to legislation, the\nwhole legal system suffers from a pathology: an inability to sustain\nthe rule-of-law values of openness and clarity of the laws.\n\nThe problem faced in cases like Garner v Burr is an\nespecially vivid reminder of a problem that philosophers of language\nhave long been more or less aware of (see Aristotle\u2019s discussion\nof the notion of \u2018friendship\u2019 in Eudemian Ethics VII, 2,\n1236a 33). The context-dependence of the meaning of utterances\nrequires an account of linguistic competence that relates it to other\nhuman capacities\u2014capacities to judge the importance of context\nand to draw analogies. It would be a mistake in the philosophy of\nlanguage to account for language in a way that divorces its mastery\nfrom other aspects of reason. That connection between the use of\nlanguage and reason is also illustrated by the contentious nature of\nthe use of language in law. Much work on pragmatics by philosophers of\nlanguage has concerned the conditions for understanding an utterance;\njudicial disputes over language are a reminder that those\nconditions\u2014even though they are conditions of intelligibility of\ncommunication\u2014lend themselves to disagreement and to reasoned\ndispute over how an utterance is to be understood (see Carston 2013,\nfor discussion of controversies over the application of conversational\nmaxims). The special feature that distinguishes the legal use of\nlanguage from ordinary conversation is not that participants in a\nlegal system act strategically while participants in an ordinary\nconversation act cooperatively; the special feature is that in order\nto attain the ideal of the rule of law, legal systems need\ninstitutions and processes for resolution of the disputes about the\neffect of law-making uses of language that arise as a result of its\ncontext-dependence, and as a result of other pragmatic aspects of\ncommunication.\n3. Can law be made by the use of language?\n\nDiscussions of the pragmatics of legal language are expressly or\nimplicitly premised on a view of the relation between a law-making use\nof language, and the law that is made. It is the view that if an\nagency or a person is authorised to make law, it makes the law that it\ncommunicates by its use of\n language.[3]\n That \u2018communication model\u2019 must be qualified in at least\nfour ways, because the law itself regulates the making of law:\n\nthe law that is made will be limited by any legal limit on the\npower of the law maker (as to the substance of the law that it can\nmake, or as to the process by which it can lawfully make law),\nand\nrules of law may qualify the law that is made in a variety of ways\nthat are not susceptible of any general\n characterisation[4]\n (see Solum 2013 for an extensive discussion of ways in which the law\nthat is made by a communicative act may be qualified), and\ncourts may need to resolve indeterminacies in the effect of an act\nof law making, and where they do so, their decisions may have\nconclusive legal effect (for the parties, and also for the future if\nthe decision is treated as a precedent), and\nif a court departs from the law that the law maker communicated\n(for good reasons or bad), the decision of the court may still have\nconclusive legal effect (for the parties, and also for the future if\nthe decision is treated as a precedent).\n\n\nEven with those qualifications, some theorists reject the\ncommunication model. They argue that the identification of legal\nrights and duties cannot be based merely on facts such as the fact\nthat an authority has communicated this or that. This section will\naddress theories that seek to ground the law on something more\ndignified than mere words. And we will have to ask whether those\ntheories can account for the diverse normative powers that legal\nsystems confer on institutions and agencies and persons.\n3.1 The Semantic Sting\n\nThe most influential theory to have denied the communication model is\nthat of Ronald Dworkin, as it emerged in his argument against the idea\nthat the law of a country is a system of rules. H.L.A.Hart had tried\nto explain the nature of a legal system on the basis of social rules\nfor identifying the law of a community, which provide shared tests of\nvalidity for rules of the system. Hart treated it as obvious that such\nrules commonly identify the acts of law-making authorities as sources\nof law, conferring power on those authorities to make law, and that\n(subject to qualifications that are part of the communication model\nsuch as those listed above) the law becomes what a lawmaker conveys\nthat it is to be, in the communicative act by which it exercises such\na power.\n\nOn that view, the content of the law of a community depends on a\nconventional way of recognizing legal rules. But if members of the\ncommunity share a way of recognizing their law, how can they engage in\nthe deep disputes about the law that we are all so familiar with?\nDworkin made that question into a focus of jurisprudential debate. And\nhe framed the question as an objection to a misguided view of\nlanguage, and of the relation between law and language. He began his\nbook Law\u2019s Empire (Dworkin 1986b) by contending that\nlegal theorists like Hart cannot explain theoretical disagreement in\nlegal practice, because they think that lawyers share uncontroversial\ntests (tests which Dworkin termed \u2018criteria\u2019) for the\ntruth of propositions of law. The \u2018semantic sting\u2019\ninvolves the misconception that the language of the law can be\nmeaningful only if lawyers share such criteria. It is fatal to a legal\ntheory, because it leads the theorist to think that people cannot have\nany deep (or \u2018substantive\u2019 or \u2018genuine\u2019)\ndisagreement about the law. They can only disagree (1) about empirical\nquestions such as what words were used in a statute, or (2) about how\nto resolve penumbral cases, or (3) about whether the law should be\nchanged. If you suffer from the semantic sting, you will conclude that\ndisagreeing about the criteria for application of the language of the\nlaw would be like using the same words with different meanings. People\nwho disagree in that way are only talking past each other. Here is how\nDworkin set out the views of theorists who suffer from the semantic\nsting:\n\n\nWe follow shared rules, they say, in using any word: these rules set\nout criteria that supply the word\u2019s meaning. Our rules for using\n\u2018law\u2019 tie law to plain historical fact.\u2026\nPhilosophers of law must elucidate them for us by a sensitive study of\nhow we speak. They may disagree among themselves, but that alone casts\nno doubt on their common assumption, which is that we do share some\nset of standards about how \u2018law\u2019 is to be used. (Dworkin,\n1986b, 31)\n\n\nDworkin argued that legal philosophy needs to make a fresh start, in\norder to face the challenge of explaining disagreement about the law.\nAny theory of law, he claimed, needs to be a \u2018constructive\ninterpretation\u2019 of legal practice. A constructive interpretation\nis one that simultaneously fits the facts of the object of\ninterpretation (in the case of legal interpretation, the object is not\nsome particular communicative act by a lawmaker, but the entire\npractice of the community) and portrays it as an object that\nachieves its purpose. On this view, a theory that does not present law\nas an exercise in constructive interpretation cannot even compete as a\ntheory of law, because it suffers from the semantic sting. And the\ncommunication model is incompatible with the idea that law is an\nexercise in constructive interpretation.\n\nThe semantic sting really does seem a gruesome fate for a lawyer,\nbecause those who suffer from it would have to say that no one really\ndisagrees with anyone about the law: whenever people think they\ndisagree about how to identify the law on any point, that fact in\nitself would demonstrate that there is nothing to disagree about:\nthere is no law on the point at issue, if the agreed ways of\nidentifying the law do not decide the point. So if you suffer from the\nsemantic sting, you will conclude that sincere, competent lawyers who\nknow the facts of a case will never disagree with each other. When an\napparent disagreement arises, they ought to throw up their hands and\nsay that there is no law on the point. If you suffer from the semantic\nsting, you will think that at least one party to any dispute over the\ncontent of the law is either legally inept and philosophically\nmisguided, or dishonest.\n\nDworkin somewhat obscured his brilliant argument by melding the vice\nof thinking that legal philosophy is a matter of disclosing the agreed\nway of using the word \u2018law\u2019 (see section 6.1 below) with\nthe vice of thinking that the content of the law of a jurisdiction is\ndetermined by agreement over the use of the words in which it is\nformulated. Pierluigi Chiassoni has recently isolated the second vice\nand called it the \u2018container-retrieval\u2019 theory (Chiassoni\n2019, 113). On the container-retrieval theory, legislative language is\nfilled up with content by linguistic conventions as to the application\nof the words in which it is expressed. The task of applying\nlegislation is the task of identifying those cases to which its words\nconventionally apply. On that approach, Garner v Burr was\nrightly decided if English speakers were disposed in 1951 to apply the\nword \u2018vehicle\u2019 to a chicken coop on wheels. If they were\ndisposed to withhold the term, the case was wrongly decided. And if\nthey had no shared disposition either way, then there was a gap in the\nlaw, and the Court of Appeal had to fill it. In any case, the\ncontent-retrieval theorist is, as Dworkin suggested, doomed to\nconclude that competent lawyers cannot disagree in good faith as to\nwhat law has been made.\n\nDworkin\u2019s challenge is pressing because of the absurdity of the\ncontent-retrieval view. To meet the challenge, it is necessary to\nexplain how it can be reasonable to disagree over the application of\nrules made by communicative acts. If the meaning of words determines\nthe rules, and the Lord Chief Justice and the magistrates agreed in\ntheir grasp of the meaning of the words of the legislation, how could\nthey differ on the question of what the rules required?\n\nThe potential for such a reasonable disagreement (even among people\nwho understand the language of the lawmaker equally well) is to be\nfound in the complex pragmatic considerations discussed in section 2.3\nabove, concerning the effect of a lawmaking communicative act.\nConsider that if we tried to adhere to the content-retrieval theory,\nwe would have to say that the relevant dispositions of speakers have\nto be contextualised: because the context affects speakers\u2019\ndispositions, we would have to ask whether they are disposed to apply\nthe word to a chicken coop with wheels, in the context of the\napplication of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 in a statutory provision\nmaking it an offence to use a vehicle without tires, for the purpose\nof protecting road surfaces... And once we ask the dispositions of\nspeakers in that proper context, it becomes obviously absurd to think\nthat there should be any legal force in their dispositions to decide\nthe very question that the Court had jurisdiction and duty to\ndecide.\n\nIf we accept the communication model, we will conclude that\nparticipants in legal practice typically share an understanding of the\nmeaning of the language of legislation; yet it is still clear that\nthere are bound to be deep disagreements as to the implications of\nthose law-making acts in some cases. Disagreement about the content of\nthe law will arise if the persons subject to the law must apply a test\nthat, like the legislation in Garner v Burr, can be\ncontroversial in its application in some cases. Likewise, disagreement\nwill arise if the legislative act delegates authority to a court (as\nlegislatures often do), or if the legislature communicates unclearly.\nThe persons subject to the law must decide (and may dispute) how to\ninterpret the acts of the legislature. And it may also be unclear (and\ncontroversial) in some cases whether the legislature has the power\nthat it claims to have exercised, or whether a court has power to\ndepart (and if so, whether it ought to depart) from a decision of the\nlegislature.\n\nDoes the recent outpouring of work on the pragmatics of legal language\nprovide a successful defence of the communication model against\nDworkin\u2019s semantic sting argument? That work makes it abundantly\nclear that the communication model does not need to rely on the\ncontent-retrieval picture of the meaning of words. The point of legal\ninterpretation in Garner v Burr was not to decide whether the\nmeaning of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 encompasses a chicken coop\non wheels. It was, instead, to decide what it was that Parliament had\ndone, when it required vehicles on the roads to have tires. In\nJ.L.Austin\u2019s slogan, \u2018The total speech act in the total\nspeech situation is the only actual phenomenon which, in the last\nresort, we are engaged in elucidating.\u2019 (Austin 1962, 148).\n\nBut Dworkin would presumably have extended his \u2018semantic\nsting\u2019 argument into an argument that the communication model\nsuffers from a \u2018semantic-and-pragmatic sting\u2019\u2014i.e.,\nthe misconception that the content of the law is determined by\nagreement both as to the semantics of words, and also as to the\npragmatics of communication. He would no doubt have said that the only\nantidote to this sting is his theory of \u2018constructive\ninterpretation\u2019, holding that the \u2018pragmatic\u2019\naspects of the use of language in law include the attitude that law\nmust justify the use of state coercion, which requires the interpreter\nto construct the theory of rights and duties that best fits and\njustifies the whole pattern of legal practice. That was\nDworkin\u2019s essential claim. His semantic sting argument cannot in\nitself undermine the communication model, because his argument was\nbased on an impoverished view of the controversy that can result from\ncommunication.\n3.2 How to make a legal norm\n\nSo the communication model can explain controversy over the law. But\ncan it explain how a law maker can do \u2018normative magic\u2019\n(Enoch 2014, 296), making mere words into law? Mark Greenberg has\nargued that:\n\nTrying to understand legislation on the model of communication is\nmisguided because legislation and legislative systems have purposes\nthat have no parallel in the case of communication and that may be\nbetter served if a statute\u2019s contribution to the content of the\nlaw is not constituted by what is communicated by the legislature.\n(Greenberg 2011, 221; for arguments against Greenberg\u2019s claim,\nsee Marmor 2014, 15\u201322, and Asgeirsson 2020, Chapter 1)\n\n\nThat can indeed be the case if, for example, the purposes of the law\nare best served if a court is authorised to depart from what the\nlegislature decided. But it is also possible for the law\u2019s\npurposes to be served by treating a law maker\u2019s contribution to\nthe content of the law as being just what the law maker communicated.\nConsider for simplicity the making of a particular legal norm. With a\ngesture of a hand, a police officer at the scene of an accident can\nwave to a driver to indicate that she can go ahead, or can direct the\ndriver to stop. The law, by authorising the officer to direct traffic,\nmakes the officer\u2019s gesture count as the law\u2019s decision as\nto whether the driver has permission to proceed or a duty to stop.\n\nLanguage facilitates the making of far more articulate legal norms.\nWhen the appeal court in Garner v Burr sent the matter back\nto the magistrate with instructions to convict, suppose that the\nmagistrate wrote \u2018fine: five shillings\u2019 on the court\ndocket. If the justice was authorised to impose such a fine, and\nwriting those words on the docket was a lawful way of exercising that\nlegal power, then how should we understand the contribution to the law\nof the act of the magistrate? That contribution would, in English law,\nbe just what the magistrate indicated by using the words: that Mr Burr\nwas thereby fined five shillings. A court bailiff would be treated by\nEnglish law as being authorised to collect five shillings, and not\nmore. The law\u2019s good reasons for such a way of proceeding are\nvery evident: after Mr Burr\u2019s presumably fair hearings in the\nmagistrate\u2019s court and the appeal court, when a magistrate (in\nthe exercise of a jurisdiction on behalf of a court) wrote those words\non the docket, the best way to proceed is for the bailiff to treat the\njudgment of the court as a fait accompli. Suppose, instead, that the\nbailiff treated the magistrate\u2019s decision as one weighty\nconsideration among others in the overall calculation concerning how\nmuch property to seize from Mr Burr. The loss of finality would be a\nsetback for the rule of law. The resulting discretionary power of\nbailiffs would likewise be a setback for the rule of law. And the\nshift of decision making power from the magistrates (subject to the\nappeal court\u2019s oversight) to a bailiff would be a setback for\nregulatory justice because of the loss of just and expert decision\nmaking as to the rights and the liabilities of the parties to a\ndispute.\n\nIt is the capacity of the law to regulate its own allocation of power\nin a just and effective way that explains why it is appropriate for\nthe law to give a court legal power to impose a fine by its act (that\nis, by what the judge says in the exercise of the power).\n\nNow consider the making of general legal norms. In England there is a\nValue Added Tax of 20 per cent. That is the case because the U.K.\nParliament enacted (in language that you may well consider rather\nperemptory) that \u2018VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20 per\ncent\u2019 (Value Added Tax Act 1994 s 2(1), as amended by the\nFinance (No 2) Act 2010, s 3(1)), and English law treats Parliament as\nhaving law-making authority. We can imagine a system in which the\ncontribution of that legislative act to the law of England is\nqualified by a discretion on the part of tax collectors to collect\nmore or less than 20 per cent. We can imagine a system in which judges\nare given an equitable jurisdiction to reduce the tax where a company\nsupplying goods and services is at risk of insolvency. There are sound\nand pressing reasons, instead, for English law to treat the decision\nof the legislature as having determined the tax. The central reason,\nof course, is the allocation of the taxing power to the Parliament;\nsubsidiary but very important reasons concern the rule of law values\nto be secured if taxpayers and enforcement officials and judges are\nall bound by the decision of Parliament.\n\nMark Greenberg writes, in the entry on\n legal interpretation,\n\nIt is crucial not to conflate a provision\u2019s linguistic meaning\nwith its contribution to the content of the law.... If, in addressing\nthe preliminary question of what legal interpretation seeks, we simply\nconflate a statute\u2019s contribution with its linguistic meaning,\nthen, among other mistakes, we miss the need for a substantive\nargument for that claim. (Greenberg 2021)\n\n\nHere is the substantive argument: the purposes of a legal system very\ncommonly include the allocation of decision-making power, enabling a\nperson or an agency not merely to take an action that they know will\nbe treated as legally consequential, but to decide what the law is to\nbe on some point. The law can authorise them to take an action that\nthe law itself treats as its decision of a matter of right or duty or\nliability. When, for example, the U.K. Parliament enacts that\n\u2018VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20 per cent\u2019, the\ncontribution to the law is that VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20\nper cent.\n\nThat argument, you might say, should not be overgeneralised, for not\nall legislation is like the Value Added Tax. Just as it is possible to\nmake law by the use of language, it is also possible to fail to do so:\nwhen the would-be lawmaker has no authority, or when the law deprives\nthe act of lawmaking effect because of a defect in the substance or\nthe process of the action of the would-be lawmaker, or when the law\nconfers on another agency the power to override or to change the law\nmade by the lawmaker. And it is possible for the law made by a\nlegislature or by the framers of a constitution to be morphed out of\nall recognition by a pattern of judicial acts that change its effect,\neven if the courts and all the lawyers describe the courts\u2019 role\nall along as \u2018interpretation\u2019. Moreover, in some\ncircumstances and for some purposes there is something to Ronald\nDworkin\u2019s picture of a judge in the United States as \u2018a\npartner continuing to develop, in what he believes is the best way,\nthe statutory scheme Congress began\u2019 (Dworkin 1986b, 313). For\nlegislation can create a scheme of regulation that cries out for\nelaboration in the course of the judicial resolution of disputes over\nits operation. But that work of reasoned elaboration is only an\noccasional aspect of a role in which a judge may be bound by a\nlegislative decision, where the law allocates a power of lawful\ndecision to the legislature.\n\nWe should conclude that it is not merely possible for an agency or a\nperson to make law by the use of language; it is a central technique\nof legal ordering (and of the rule of law) for the law to confer\nauthority on persons and agencies to make particular legal norms and\ngeneral rules of law. The reasons of political morality for doing so\nare indeed a dignified ground for the content of the law, although the\ntechniques that enable the effective allocation of legal power also\nlend themselves to abuse. And the moral value of the allocation of\nlegal power and its potential for abuse both depend on human language:\nthe most prodigiously useful set of tools for the articulation of a\npolicy and for the conferral and for the exercise of power.\n\nWhen lawmakers use those tools to make law, is it the linguistic\nmeaning of their action that determines the content of the law?\nGreenberg says that \u2018Linguistic meaning is the information that\nis reliably and systematically conveyed by words, sentences, and other\nlinguistic entities.\u2019 (see the entry on\n legal interpretation,\n section 2.1). But linguistic entities do not convey information, or\nmake law. We need to remind ourselves of J.L.Austin\u2019s slogan,\nand we need to remind ourselves of the lesson of the semantic sting:\nwhen an agency or a person has authority to make law, and exercises\nits authority lawfully (as Parliament did in imposing the Value Added\nTax, or as a court does in ordering the payment of a fine), it would\nbe absurd to think that the contribution to the law of its action is\ndetermined by the dispositions of speakers of the language to use the\nwords of the law maker in one way or another. The content of the law\nmade by the lawmaker is what the lawmaker did in the exercise of its\nlawmaking authority. That is, what it communicated by using the\nlanguage it used, in the way that it did, in \u2018the total speech\nsituation\u2019.\n4. Evaluative language and the nature of law\n\nThe context of the use of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 in Garner\nv Burr requires anyone addressing the problem in the case to make\nevaluative judgments, just to decide whether the word applied to the\nchicken coop on wheels. The context of use is a criminal prohibition\nimposed for a presumably good public purpose of protecting road\nsurfaces. To determine in that context whether the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 extends to a chicken coop on wheels, you need to\naddress (and to resolve any tension between) the two principles\nmentioned above: that the purposes for which Parliament passed the\nstatute should be pursued, and that criminal liability should not be\nextended to conduct that has not been unequivocally prohibited.\nBecause of that context, the question of the meaning and application\nof the language of the statute cannot be answered without making\njudgments on normative questions as to how those principles are to be\nrespected. The role of evaluative considerations in the application of\nordinary descriptive terms like \u2018vehicle\u2019 raises a\nchallenge for any thorough-going scepticism about value: the challenge\nis to decide whether to adopt a thorough-going scepticism about the\nmeaning and application of descriptive language, which seems to follow\nfrom general scepticism concerning value (see Chiassoni 2019 for a\nsustained defence of such a form of scepticism, concluding that\n\u2018The province of proper and practical legal\ninterpretation\u201cthe province of judicial and juristic\ninterpretation\u201dis, properly speaking, a province without\ntruth.\u2019 (at 46)).\n\nThe effect of the use of descriptive language can depend on evaluative\nconsiderations. For philosophy of law, that dependence raises special\nproblems. If you cannot tell whether to describe an object as a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purposes of the Act without evaluative\nreasoning, then the legal effect of the Road Traffic Act does not\ndepend merely on physical facts (such as that there were wheels on the\nchicken coop) and social facts (such as that Parliament used the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 in the Act, or the complex social fact of the\nwhole pattern of uses that have been made of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019). You cannot identify the law (that is, you\ncannot tell what legal rights and duties people have) without\nevaluative reasoning. That conclusion, if it is sound, seems to have\nimportant implications for the long-running debates in theory of law\nover the relation between fact and value in law, and over relations\nbetween law and morality. The conclusion seems to contradict one of\nthe most provocative and controversial claims in the theory of\nlaw\u2014the \u2018sources thesis\u2019, which Joseph Raz has\nstated as follows:\n\nAll law is source-based. A law is source-based if its existence and\ncontent can be identified by reference to social facts alone, without\nresort to any evaluative argument. (Raz (1994), 194\u20135; see entry\n the nature of law)\n \n\nWe can only decide whether the chicken coop was a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act by\nunderstanding the Act as pursuing something that the legislature\ndecided to pursue, and by making an normative judgment as to whether\ndue respect for the goal that the legislature valued through the\nenactment, and due respect for the requirement of certainty in\ncriminal liability, support the conclusion that the chicken coop is to\nbe treated as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 in the relevant sense. So we\ncannot apply the law without resort to evaluative and normative\nreasoning.\n\nIt may seem that judges need to make such evaluative judgments only in\nborderline cases for the application of legal language\u2014and that\nthey have discretion in those cases (that is, the judge must make a\ndecision that is not determined by law). That, you might say, would\nvindicate the sources thesis. But a clear case of a vehicle counts as\na \u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act just\nbecause the evaluative considerations that justify the use of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 in that context clearly support its application.\nThe sources thesis seems to be contradicted even in the clearest cases\nof the application of a law stated in descriptive language, if the\ncontent of such laws depends on how the purposes of the law ought to\nbe conceived. That form of evaluation, you may say, can only be\ncarried out by engaging in the very same form of reasoning that, in\nRaz\u2019s theory, law excludes.\n\nIt is true that, in order to decide what the sources have directed\n(and thereby, in Raz\u2019s terms, to identify the existence and\ncontent of a law), you need to understand the sense in which a word\nlike \u2018vehicle\u2019 is used. But the existence and content of\nthe offence can still be identified without first judging whether it\nought to be an offence to do what Mr.Burr did, or whether there ought\nto be any offence at all of driving without pneumatic tires. The\nsources thesis articulates this important insight: in English law,\nthere was no offence of driving without pneumatic tires (whether or\nnot it would be a good idea for that to be an offence), until\nParliament acted to create the offence. And then, it became an offence\nbecause of the fact that Parliament had done so (whether or not it was\na good idea to do so). Moreover, if the institutions of the law had\nnot been prepared to treat the chicken coop as a vehicle, then because\nof that social fact, it would have been false (after a decision with\nprecedential effect) to say that it was an offence to pull a chicken\ncoop on iron wheels on the road. Law is reflexive in the sense that\nthe law gives legal authority to legal institutions to identify the\nlaw. Therefore, the courts\u2019 decisions determine legal rights and\nobligations. So, we might say, a law is source-based if its existence\nand content can be identified by reference to social facts alone,\nwithout resort to any evaluative argument, other than whatever\nevaluative argument may be needed to determine the social facts, or to\nwork out their implications for the case at hand.\n\nRaz\u2019s explanation of the nature of law is not undermined by the\nfact that evaluative judgments are necessary in order to identify the\nimplications of the social fact that Parliament prohibited vehicles\nfrom being driven without pneumatic tires. It is still possible for\nlegal directives to have the exclusionary force that, in his theory of\nauthority, they claim (Raz 2009, chapters 1 and 2). The court in\nGarner v Burr can decide whether it is an offence to pull a\nchicken coop on wheels without pneumatic tires, without answering the\nquestion, \u2018should it be an offence to pull a chicken coop down a\nroad on iron wheels?\u2019, or the question, \u2018should it be an\noffence to use a vehicle without pneumatic tires?\u2019 But the court\nneeds to ask the related question: \u2018what is the relevant sense\nof \u201cvehicle\u201d for the purposes of this Act?\u2019 It is\nwhat Parliament did that determines Lawrence Burr\u2019s liability;\nit may take evaluative reasoning to answer the question of social\nfact, \u2018what did Parliament prohibit, when it prohibited vehicles\nfrom being driven without pneumatic tires?\u2019\n5. Vagueness in language and in law\n\nA speed limit on a highway is a fairly precise law: in most cases it\nis clear whether a driver has conformed to the standard. But highway\ntraffic regulation also needs (and typically uses) rules against\ncareless or dangerous driving. Such abstract standards are designed to\ncontrol a variety of behaviour that is too diverse for the legislative\npurpose to be attained by reference to any uniform, measurable\ncriterion that would allow the precision of a speed limit.\n\nVague laws, such as a rule against careless driving, pose problems for\nphilosophy of law that are related to problems that philosophers of\nlanguage and of logic have addressed in arguments about the\nparadox of the heap (see the entry on the\n Sorites paradox).\n Suppose that, according to law, it counts as careless driving to\ndrive with bald tires. If the law gives a precise definition of the\nthickness of tire tread that counts as bald, then in this regard the\nlaw is (more or less) precise, and for the purposes of the law,\nvirtually every tire is either clearly bald or clearly not bald. But\nif there is no such precise standard, then there are \u2018borderline\ncases\u2019 in which it is neither clearly true that a tire is bald,\nnor clearly false. And we can construct a sorites series and a sorites\nparadox for the application of the law:\n\nA new tire is not\n bald.[5]\nIf a tire is not bald, it does not become bald by losing one\nmolecule of rubber from its tread.\nSo a tire that has lost one molecule of rubber is not bald.\nReiterate 2.\nSo a tire that has lost two molecules of rubber is not bald.\nReiterate 2.\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\nN. So a tire never goes bald.\n\nN+1. So no one can ever break the rule against careless driving by\ndriving with bald tires.\n\n\nThe false conclusions N and N+1 arise by apparently valid reasoning\nfrom apparently true premises. Philosophical approaches to the paradox\nseem to have implications for legal theory: arguments that vague terms\nare incoherent, and that reasoning with them is impossible,\nwould support arguments that vague laws are incoherent. Since vague\nlaws are an important part of every legal system (Endicott 2001), the\nimplications seem to be far-reaching.\n\n\u2018Epistemic\u2019 arguments that the only way to solve\nthe paradox is to deny the truth of step 2 (so that vagueness is a\nproblem of ignorance as to where the sharp boundary is between tires\nthat are and are not bald) imply that there is always a single right\nanswer to the application of a law stated in vague language. Arguments\nthat the application of a vague expression is indeterminate in\nborderline cases (or in some borderline cases) imply that the\napplication of a law that can be expressed in vague language is\nindeterminate in some cases. But it is even controversial whether such\ntheories matter to legal philosophy (Schiffer 2001 and 2021,\nGreenawalt 2001).\n\nPhilosophers of law have not been especially concerned with the\nquestion of how to solve (or to resolve) the paradox, but they have\ndebated the nature of borderline cases, and its implications for the\nrole of judges in a community, and for the possibility of the rule of\nlaw. If the application of vague laws is indeterminate in some cases,\nthen in those cases a judge (or other official) responsible for\napplying the law cannot decide the matter by applying the law, since\nthe law does not determine the matter (and in fact, no one can use the\nlaw to guide their conduct).\n\nSome legal philosophers have responded to this problem by claiming\nthat judges never (or virtually never) have such a choice, and that\nthere is virtually always a right answer to a question of legal rights\n(Dworkin, 1986a, 1991). Others have responded to the problem by\nclaiming that the law gives judges discretion, in all or some\nborderline cases, to decide issues that the law does not determine\n(Hart, 2012, chapter VII.1). That is, the standards of the system\nleave a choice to judges as to how to decide the issue. Then judges\nmust treat the parties to litigation as having liabilities or\nobligations or entitlements that were not determinately theirs at the\ntime when the dispute arose. That power of judges appears to some to\nrun contrary to a requirement of the rule of law: that laws (or at\nleast, that legal burdens) should not be imposed retroactively.\n\nAs a result, vagueness raises an extraordinarily important set of\nproblems for the philosophy of law. It may seem to be a different set\nof problems from those raised by vague language in general, because of\nthree ways in which the legal use of vague language is distinctive.\nFirst, legal systems need to provide for authoritative resolution of\ndisputes as to the effect of the use of vague language (where in some\nother domains of the use of language, we can get by without any such\nresolution).\n\nSecondly, vagueness in legal language is distinctive because lawmakers\navoid ordinary vague expressions like \u2018driving very fast\u2019\nand prefer precise speed limits (or blood alcohol limits...). When the\nlaw uses vague language, it uses abstract evaluative\nexpressions. Lawmakers typically do not prohibit driving with\n\u2018bald\u2019 tires; they either impose precise measures (such as\ntire tread measurements), or address the problem as part of an\nabstract, general prohibition on, e.g., \u2018careless\u2019\ndriving. An abstract standard calls upon its subjects to construct a\nview of the care that, in their law, a driver owes to another\nperson\u2014(and not merely to ask the seemingly pointless question,\nhow bald is a bald tire?). Abstract standards are a very common and a\nvery important part of lawmaking technique. A negligence standard may\nrequire \u2018reasonable care\u2019; a constitution may define a\nprocedural right as a right to \u2018due process\u2019, or a\ncontract may require the delivery of goods in \u2018satisfactory\ncondition\u2019. Those abstract terms are very different from the\nvague descriptive terms that philosophers of logic use to illustrate\ntheir arguments about the sorites paradox (\u2018heap\u2019,\n\u2018thin\u2019, \u2018bald\u2019, \u2018red\u2019\u2026). It\nmisses the point, you might think, to say that abstract standards do\nnot draw sharp lines, because they are not designed to draw lines at\nall. By using an abstract standard, the lawmaker requires the people\nwho must apply the law to construct a theory of the standard (of care,\nor of process, or of condition), which will draw any line that is\nneeded. Ronald Dworkin has claimed that abstract expressions are not\nvague at all\u2014that they have a different semantics from that of\nvague words like \u2018heap\u2019 (Dworkin, 1986b, 17).\n\nThirdly, the legal context of an expression may be very different from\nother contexts of its use. Principles of legal interpretation (for\nexample, a legal requirement that vague criminal enactments are to be\ninterpreted as applying only in clear cases) may make the legal effect\nof the use of a word more precise than its ordinary effect. The\ninterpretation of a legal prohibition on careless driving demands an\nunderstanding of what counts as careless for the purposes of the\nlaw. The effect of a vague legal prohibition may be governed by\nprecedents that rule out decisions that would otherwise be a\nreasonable application of the vague language. Even apart from the\nregulatory role of precedent, a good advocate or judge may have a\nrelatively clear sense of the accepted practice in applying the\nprohibition, and the practice may well involve not treating certain\nforms of conduct as careless, when it would be fair enough, apart from\nthat practice, to call them careless.\n\nGiven these distinctive features of law, it may seem that\nlogicians\u2019 discussions of heaps and baldness are beside the\npoint, and that legal reasoning is exempt from any implications that\nthe paradox may have for logic or for semantics. And because of the\ncontext dependence of the use of language in law (see section 2.2),\nsome have argued that indeterminacies in law are not significantly\nrelated to the susceptibility of statements of law to sorites\nreasoning (Lanius 2019, Chapter 3). Yet statements of law that use\nabstract expressions, and use them to different effect in different\ncontexts, certainly are vague in the philosophers\u2019 sense: that\nis, they appear to be susceptible to sorites reasoning.\n\u2018Careless driving\u2019 in its legal sense is a much more\ncomplex concept than \u2018driving with bald tires\u2019, and\ndriving with bald tires is an instance of careless driving only in\nvirtue of the evaluative and contextual considerations that must be\nunderstood if the law of careless driving is to be understood. Yet\n\u2018careless driving\u2019 is susceptible to sorites reasoning:\ne.g., those evaluative and contextual considerations give reason to\nconclude that it is careless to drive with bald tires. For all their\ncomplexity (and their relation to deep questions of the rights of the\ncitizen and the responsibilities and the liabilities that a community\ncan justifiably impose on the citizen), those considerations do not\ndetermine a standard that is more precise than a standard\nthat could be expressed using such an ordinary vague expression as\n\u2018bald\u2019. That is, those considerations do not provide a way\nof distinguishing between one tire in the sorites series and the next.\nSimilarly, it is obviously possible to construct sorites series for\nthe application of even more abstract legal standards such as the\nright to due process, or the United States constitutional prohibition\non cruel and unusual punishment. These evaluative tests have special\nlegal meanings that can only be understood in the context of a legal\nsystem, and in the more particular context of a specific area of law,\nand by reference to their elaboration and development in a common law\nsystem of precedent. Even with a mastery of all those aspects of the\ncontext, however, the best theory of the effect of such standards will\nnot provide a way of distinguishing between one tire in the sorites\nseries and the next. A theory of careless driving in some particular\nlegal system at a particular time would be a defective theory, if it\nyielded the conclusion that the loss of one molecule of rubber from a\ntire can make the difference between driving that is careless and\ndriving that is not careless according to law.\n\nConsider again the case of Garner v Burr (above, section\n2.2). The term \u2018vehicle\u2019, as properly understood for the\npurposes of the Road Traffic Act, is vague if there are borderline\ncases for its application (cases in which it is unclear whether the\nterm applies to some object). It may seem that nothing is more\npatently a borderline case of a \u2018vehicle\u2019 than a chicken\ncoop on wheels. But we should bear in mind that (if the discussion in\nsection 2.2 above is sound) the correct application of the term\ndepends on legal principles relating to the purposes of the\nlegislation and to the need for clarity in criminal liabilities. So\nthe chicken coop on wheels is a borderline case if it is unclear\nwhether those principles required the provision to be applied to it.\nAnd the application of the term was indeterminate in the case, if\nthose principles did not require a decision one way or the other. Of\ncourse, the appeal court held that a conviction was\nrequired\u2014which we might say amounts to a decision that the term\napplied to the chicken coop on wheels. The magistrates and the appeal\ncourt disagreed about it, but that disagreement in itself does not\nmean either that the application of the term was determinate or that\nit was indeterminate. And the fact that the appeal judges seem to have\nthought that the term clearly applied to the chicken coop cannot tell\nus that the application of the term was determinate.\n\nThe magistrates\u2019 approach put a special emphasis on the\nprinciple of certainty in criminal liability, and the appeal\ncourt\u2019s approach put a special emphasis on the effective\naccomplishment of the purpose the legislation was designed to pursue.\nEach approach would take the law in a different direction. The\napplication of the term was indeterminate (before the decision of the\nappeal court set a precedent) if neither approach was demanded by the\ncomplex resources of legal reasoning that the courts (as a matter of\nlegal obligation) had to act upon. If that was the case, then the\nappeal court\u2019s decision was not contrary to the law. But a\ndecision upholding the acquittal would not have been contrary to the\nlaw, either. The law as it was at the time of the decision allowed the\ncourts to move it in either direction.\n\nThat account of a case like Garner v Burr would support the\ncontroversial claim that judges have widespread discretion in\nresolving legal disputes. Legal philosophers have debated whether that\nclaim undermines the ideal of the rule of law, or reflects a basic\nrequirement of the rule of law: that a legal system needs techniques\nfor the resolution of legal issues that are not determined by the law\n(see Endicott 2000, chapter 9, and on the value of vagueness in law\nsee Asgeirsson 2020; on a variety of issues concerning vagueness and\nphilosophy of law, see the essays in Keil and Poscher 2016).\n6. The use of philosophy of language in philosophy of law\n6.1 Introduction: Definition as a methodology in philosophy of law\n\nBentham presented his theory as a definition. In focusing their\nattention on the meaning of the main terms of legal discourse, Bentham\nand John Austin were ahead of their time. But it has come to be a\ncommonplace view in legal theory (though still controversial) that\nthey were misguided in attempting to define those terms. So, for\nexample, Hart in the 1960s rejected definition as a useful technique\nin philosophy of law (Hart 2012, 14\u201317). Dworkin in the 1980s\naccused Hart of only repackaging the same approach as the \u2018more\ncandidly definitional\u2019 method of John Austin (Dworkin 1986,\n32\u201333). And Richard Posner in the 1990s accused both Hart and\nDworkin of pointlessly \u201ctrying to define\n\u2018law\u2019\u201d (Posner 1996, vii).\n\nThere is no reason to describe the work of either Hart or Dworkin as\ndefining the word \u2018law\u2019. And defining that word would not\nsolve any of the problems of jurisprudence (as Hart pointed out). The\nfundamental reason is that the legal philosophers\u2019 problems and\ntheir disputes would not be resolved by a statement of the meaning of\nthe word \u2018law\u2019 that would be useful to someone who did not\nknow it. Philosophers of law cannot solve their problems by giving a\ndefinition of the word \u2018law\u2019, any more than philosophers\nof language can solve their problems by giving a definition of the\nword \u2018language\u2019 (for discussion of the implications for\nlegal philosophy of the semantics and metasemantics of the word\n\u2018law\u2019, see Coleman and Simchen 2003).\n\nA further reason is that, as John Finnis and Ronald Dworkin have both\nexplained in different ways, the word \u2018law\u2019 can be used in\na variety of senses: the law of the jungle, the law of gravity, laws\nof thought, Murphy\u2019s law, etc. (Finnis 1980, 6; Dworkin 1986,\n104). A definition would have to allow for those senses. It might be\nan intriguing (and arduous) study in culture and human thought to\nexplain the analogies among those senses, but it is a study that holds\nout no special promise for understanding the law of a community.\n6.2 Language and the normativity of law\n\nLegal philosophers have tried to explain the normativity of\nlaw\u2014the fact that the law of a community is, or presents\nitself as, a guide to the conduct of members of a community. One easy\nway to express this abstract feature of law is by pointing out that\nthe law can be stated by making normative statements (i.e. statements\nthat use expressions like \u2018obligation\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, \u2018may\u2019). And one\nattractive way of trying to explain the normativity of law is by\nexplaining the meaning and use of the normative language that is often\nused in stating the law. That is, the problem of explaining the nature\nof legal norms (obligations, rights, etc.) can be addressed by\nexplaining the meaning or the use of the normative words that are used\nin law (\u2018obligation\u2019, \u2018right\u2019,\u2026).\nJoseph Raz has put it that \u2018The problem of the normativity of\nlaw is the problem of explaining the use of normative language in\ndescribing the law or legal situations.\u2019 (1990, 170)\n\nWe saw that Bentham\u2019s theory of normative language in general\nwas that, because there is no object, substance or perceptible human\naffection for which they stand as a name, words such as\n\u2018right\u2019 must be \u2018expounded\u2019 by paraphrasing\nsentences containing them. The paraphrase would use sentences that\ncontain only words that can be defined as referring to objects,\nsubstances, and affections. When no such paraphrase is available, he\nconsidered that normative language is meaningless. So he held that the\nphrase \u2018natural rights\u2019 is \u201csimple nonsense: natural\nand imprescriptible rights, rhetorical nonsense; nonsense upon\nstilts\u201d (Bentham 1843, Art.II). While the language is\nmeaningless, he thought, we can explain its use\u2014as a way of\ndoing something. Using such nonsensical expressions is a way in which\nthe speaker expresses his preferences.\n\nAlthough Bentham and John Austin thought that the notion of a\nnatural right was nonsense, they did not at all think the\nsame about the notion of legal rights. In their command\ntheory they found a way of paraphrasing normative expressions in their\nlegal use. They explained the meaning of the word\n\u2018duty\u2019\u2014and thereby the normativity of law\u2014by\nreference to the pain and pleasure that a superior offered as\nmotivation for compliance with the superior\u2019s will:\n\nThat is my duty to do, which I am liable to be\npunished, according to law, if I do not do: this is the\noriginal, ordinary, and proper sense of the word duty.\n(Bentham 1776, 109; cf. John Austin 1832, 14).\n\n\nHart used the resources of twentieth-century philosophy to challenge\nthat approach to normative language. He drew on the work of J.L.\nAustin, a philosopher of language who thought that problems in many\nareas of philosophy could be dissolved by pointing out the things that\npeople do with words. J.L. Austin once suggested that \u201ca\nstatement of \u2018the law\u2019\u201d is a performative statement,\nrather than \u201ca statement of fact\u201d (Austin 1962, 4 n.2).\nThe suggestion is that to state the law is to perform an act (an act\nother than the making of an assertion that could be true or false).\nJ.L. Austin\u2019s claim offered to account for the normativity of\nlaw by reference to the things that people do with words. That hint\nattracted Hart (Hart, 1954), whose theory of law is based on a\n\u2018practice theory of rules\u2019. He articulated the theory by\npointing out what people do with the normative language they use in\nstating rules.\n\nHart started by arguing that Bentham and Austin had explained the\nmeaning and use of normative language in a way that failed to account\nfor its role in ordinary discourse. He pointed out that their account\nof the meaning of the word \u2018duty\u2019 left them unable to draw\na distinction that people ordinarily draw in their use of language,\nbetween the command of a gunman (which no one would say imposes a\n\u2018duty\u2019 or an \u2018obligation\u2019), and a legal\nprescription:\n\nThe plausibility of the claim that the gunman situation displays the\nmeaning of obligation lies in the fact that it is certainly one in\nwhich we would say that B, if he obeyed, was\n\u2018obliged\u2019 to hand over his money. It is, however, equally\ncertain that we should misdescribe the situation if we said, on these\nfacts, that B \u2018had an obligation\u2019 or a\n\u2018duty\u2019 to hand over the money. So from the start it is\nevident that we need something else for an understanding of the idea\nof obligation. There is a difference, yet to be explained, between the\nassertion that someone was obliged to do something and the\nassertion that he had an obligation to do it. (Hart 2012, 82)\n\n\nBentham and Austin would have had a ready response: that people\nordinarily misuse the word \u2018obligation\u2019. They fail to give\nit a meaning that can be expounded by reference to sensible objects.\nBentham and Austin were linguistic philosophers, but (unlike J.L.\nAustin) not ordinary language philosophers. They sought a way of using\nlanguage that would back up their empiricism and utilitarianism, and\nthey were actually pleased if that technique called for a\nreorganisation of ordinary language: it showed that they were\ndisclosing what had been obscured by mere cant.\n\nHart\u2019s approach to language was different. It may seem that he\ndid not need to talk about language, and that his point could have\nbeen made without mentioning types of assertions, or what \u2018we\nwould say\u2019. His argument, you might think, simply puts into the\nlinguistic mode an argument that could be made with no mention of\nlanguage: an argument that you can have an obligation without being\nliable to sanction. And yet, the linguistic form of the argument was\nimportant to Hart. He wanted to avoid explaining the difference\nbetween obligation and coercion in the way a\n natural law\n theorist might (by saying that an obligation is a kind of reason). So\nhis focus on the use of the word \u2018obligation\u2019 is\nno accident. He did not point out the way we use that word as an\noblique way of appealing to our shared wisdom as to what obligation\nis. It was actually important to him to point out how we\nuse the word. His explanation of the normativity of law\nrelies on the use of such words to display an attitude.\n\nHart claimed that a legal system is a system of power-conferring and\nduty-imposing rules, which are validated by a \u2018rule of\nrecognition\u2019. That rule is not made valid by another rule; it is\na \u2018social rule\u2019. In explaining that crucial notion of a\nsocial rule, Hart turned to the use of words to explain the\nnormativity of law. He claimed that a social rule is a regular pattern\nof conduct accompanied by a \u2018distinctive normative\nattitude\u2019, which \u2018consists in the standing disposition of\nindividuals to take such patterns of conduct both as guides to their\nown future conduct and as standards of criticism\u2019 (Hart, 2012,\n255). In accounting for that disposition, or \u2018internal\nattitude\u2019, Hart\u2019s emphasis was on speech acts\u2014on the\nuse that participants in the practice make of normative language.\n\nWhat is necessary [for a social rule to exist] is that there should be\na critical reflective attitude to certain patterns of behaviour as a\ncommon standard, and that this should display itself in criticism\n(including self-criticism), demands for conformity, and in\nacknowledgments that such criticism and demands are justified, all of\nwhich find their characteristic expression in the normative\nterminology of \u2018ought\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, and\n\u2018should\u2019, \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019\n(Hart, 2012, 57).\n\n\nHart\u2019s interest in normative language was focused not on its\nmeaning, but on the attitude that people display when they use it. His\nexplanation of the difference between non-normative and normative\nassertions (between, as he put it, \u2018the assertion that someone\nwas obliged to do something and the assertion that he had\nan obligation to do it\u2019) was merely that the latter sort of\nassertion is used to display a distinctive sort of attitude.\n\nJust as Bentham\u2019s approach to normative language was allied to\nhis empiricism and his utilitarianism, Hart\u2019s approach to\nnormative language was allied to his philosophical methodology, and to\nhis views on the relation between law and morality. His methodological\npurpose was to elucidate human practices, and he wanted to defend a\nconceptual separation between law and morality\u2014a distinction in\nkind between legal obligation and moral obligation (see Hart 2012,\n239\u2013240). The practice theory of rules attracted him as a tool\nfor those purposes, because it offered a way of accounting for the\nnormativity of law by pointing to forms of behaviour which could be\ndescribed, and which did not (in his view) carry any moral baggage. In\nsaying that people use normative language to display an attitude to\nregularities of behaviour, the theorist did not need to do moral\nphilosophy, and did not need to make any moral evaluations of the\npractice being described. The theorist did not even need to ascribe\nany moral evaluations to the participants in the practice, since the\nfact that people use normative language to display an attitude is,\nHart considered, consistent with their having various moral views or\nnone at all.\n\nHow much simpler it would be to say that normative language means the\nsame in its moral uses and in its legal uses. While a person who says\nthat you must stop at a red light may display various\nattitudes, what he or she asserts is a necessity that implies\na (presumptively) conclusive reason to stop. If the statement is a\nstatement of law, the necessity is a legal necessity; if the statement\nis a moral statement, the necessity is a moral necessity.\n\nThat approach is not only simpler; it closes the gap that Hart left in\nhis theory. According to Hart, the meaning of normative language\ndiffers in morality and in law. But in fact, Hart had nothing to say\nabout the meaning of normative expressions such as\n\u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018must\u2019 or \u2018obligation\u2019\nor \u2018right\u2019 (except that their meaning differs in law and\nin morality). He only pointed out that people display an attitude when\nthey use such language.\n\nJoseph Raz rejected Hart\u2019s claim that normative terms have a\ndistinctive meaning in statements of law. In Raz\u2019s view, to make\na normative statement such as \u2018you must stop at a red\nlight\u2019 is to imply that you have a certain sort of reason for\naction. If it is a statement applying the law, it implies that you\nhave reason to stop from the point of view of the law. Raz\u2019s\ntheory of law, unlike Hart\u2019s, is part of a theory of practical\nreason in general, and his account of normative statements treats them\nas having the same meaning in law and in morality. Hart initially\nthought that that approach would necessarily lead to an extreme sort\nof natural law theory, in which every true statement of law is\nnecessarily a true moral statement, and every valid legal obligation\nis necessarily a moral obligation. But Raz resolved that concern of\nHart\u2019s, by pointing out that normative statements can be made in\na detached way. People can make them without endorsing the point of\nview from which the reasons they are stating are valid (see Raz 1990,\n175\u2013177). Still, Hart did not accept Raz\u2019s approach, which\nhe felt created a certain sort of conceptual connection between law\nand morality. In responding to Raz, he insisted that \u2018statements\nof the subject\u2019s legal duties need have nothing directly to do\nwith the subject\u2019s reasons for action\u2019 (Hart 1982, 267).\nAnd in an interview with the Spanish journal Doxa near the\nend of his career he maintained \u2018that legal and moral obligation\nare conceptually different\u2019, so that a statement of obligation\nhas a different meaning in law and in morality (De Paramo 1988). He\nnever explained the difference in meaning; its necessity only follows\nfrom a methodological preconception.\n",
