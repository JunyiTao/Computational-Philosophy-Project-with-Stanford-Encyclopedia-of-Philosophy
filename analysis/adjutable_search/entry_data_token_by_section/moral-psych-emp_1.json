Thought Experiments and the Methods of Ethics\n\n\u201cIntuition pumps\u201d or \u201cthought experiments\u201d\nhave long been well-used items in the philosopher\u2019s toolbox\n(Dennett 1984: 17\u201318; Stuart et al. 2018). Typically, a thought\nexperiment presents an example, often a hypothetical example, in order\nto elicit some philosophically telling response. If a thought\nexperiment is successful, it may be concluded that competing theories\nmust account for the resulting response. These responses are supposed\nto serve an evidential role in philosophical theory choice;\nif you like, they can be understood as data competing\ntheories must\n accommodate.[3]\n If an appropriate audience\u2019s ethical responses to a thought\nexperiment conflict with the response a theory prescribes for the\ncase, the theory has suffered a counterexample.\n\nThe question of whose responses \u201ccount\u201d philosophically\n(or, who is the \u201cappropriate\u201d audience) has been answered\nin a variety of ways, but for many philosophers, the intended audience\nfor thought experiments seems to be some species of \u201cordinary\nfolk\u201d (see Jackson 1998: 118, 129; Jackson & Pettit 1995:\n22\u20139; Lewis 1989: 126\u20139). Of course, the relevant folk\nmust possess such cognitive attainments as are required to understand\nthe case at issue; very young children are probably not an ideal\naudience for thought experiments. Accordingly, some philosophers may\ninsist that the relevant responses are the considered judgments of\npeople with the training required to see \u201cwhat is at stake\nphilosophically\u201d. But if the responses are to help adjudicate\nbetween competing theories, the responders must be more or less\ntheoretically neutral, and this sort of neutrality is\nrather likely to be vitiated by philosophical education. A dilemma\nemerges. On the one hand, philosophically na\u00efve subjects may be\nthought to lack the erudition required to grasp the philosophical\nstakes. On the other, with increasing philosophical sophistication\ncomes, very likely, philosophical partiality; one audience is\nna\u00efve, and the other\n prejudiced.[4]\n\nHowever exactly the philosophically relevant audience is specified,\nthere are empirical questions that must be addressed in determining\nthe philosophical potency of a thought experiment. In particular, when\ndeciding what philosophical weight to give a response, philosophers\nneed to determine its origins. What features of the\nexample are implicated in a given judgment\u2014are people\nreacting to the substance of the case, or the style of exposition?\nWhat features of the audience are implicated in their\nreaction\u2014do different demographic groups respond to the example\ndifferently? Are there factors in the environment that are affecting\npeople\u2019s intuitive judgments? Does the order in which people\nconsider examples affect their judgments? Such questions raise the\nfollowing concern: judgments about thought experiments dealing with\nmoral issues might be strongly influenced by ethically\nirrelevant characteristics of the example or the audience or the\nenvironment or the order of presentation. Whether a characteristic is\nethically relevant is a matter for philosophical discussion, but\ndetermining the status of a particular thought experiment also\nrequires empirical investigation of its causally relevant\ncharacteristics. We\u2019ll now describe some examples of such\ninvestigation.\n\nAs part of their famous research on the \u201cheuristics and\nbiases\u201d that underlie human reasoning, Tversky and Kahneman\n(1981) presented subjects with the following problem:\n\n\nImagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual\nAsian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative\nprograms to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the\nexact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as\nfollows:\n\nIf Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.\nIf Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600\npeople will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be\nsaved.\n\n\n\nA second group of subjects was given an identical problem, except that\nthe programs were described as follows:\n\n\nIf Program C is adopted, 400 people will die.\nIf Program D is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that nobody\nwill die and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.\n\n\n\nOn the first version of the problem, most subjects thought that\nProgram A should be adopted. But on the second version, most chose\nProgram D, despite the fact that the outcome described in A is\nidentical to the one described in C. The disconcerting implication of\nthis study is that ethical responses may be strongly influenced by the\nmanner in which cases are described or framed. It seems that\nsuch framing sensitivities constitute ethically irrelevant influences\non ethical responses. Unless this sort of possibility can be\nconfidently eliminated, one should hesitate to rely on responses to a\nthought experiment for adjudicating theoretical controversies. Such\npossibilities can only be eliminated through systematic empirical\n work.[5]\n\nWhile a relatively small percentage of empirical work on\n\u201cheuristics and biases\u201d directly addresses moral\nreasoning, numerous philosophers who have addressed the issue\n(Horowitz 1998; Doris & Stich 2005; Sinnott-Armstrong 2005;\nSunstein 2005) agree that phenomena like framing effects are likely to\nbe pervasively implicated in responses to ethically freighted\nexamples, and argue that this state of affairs should cause\nphilosophers to view the thought-experimental method with considerable\nconcern.\n\nWe turn now to order effects. In a pioneering study, Petrinovich and\nO\u2019Neill (1996) found that participants\u2019 moral intuitions\nvaried with the order in which the thought experiments were presented.\nSimilar findings have been reported by Liao et al. (2012), Wiegman et\nal. (2012), and Schwitzgebel & Cushman (2011, 2015). The\nSchwitzgebel and Cushman studies are particularly striking, since they\nset out to explore whether order effects in moral intuitions were\nsmaller or non-existent in professional philosophers. Surprisingly,\nthey found that professional philosophers were also subject to order\neffects, even though the thought experiments used are well known in\nthe field. Schwitzgebel and Cushman also report that in some cases\nphilosophers intuitions show substantial order effects when the\nintuitions of non-philosophers don\u2019t.\n\nAudience characteristics may also affect the outcome of thought\nexperiments. Haidt and associates (1993: 613) presented stories about\n\u201charmless yet offensive violations of strong social norms\u201d\nto men and women of high and low socioeconomic status (SES) in\nPhiladelphia (USA), Porto Alegre, and Recife (both in Brazil). For\nexample:\n\n\nA man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a dead chicken. But\nbefore cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he\ncooks it and eats it. (Haidt et al. 1993: 617)\n\n\nLower SES subjects tended to \u201cmoralize\u201d harmless and\noffensive behaviors like that in the chicken story. These subjects\nwere more inclined than their high SES counterparts to say that the\nactor should be \u201cstopped or punished\u201d, and more inclined\nto deny that such behaviors would be \u201cOK\u201d if customary in\na given country (Haidt et al. 1993: 618\u201319). The point is not\nthat lower SES subjects are mistaken in their moralization of such\nbehaviors while the urbanity of higher SES subjects represents a more\nrationally defensible response. The difficulty is deciding\nwhich\u2014if any\u2014of the conflicting responses is fit to serve\nas a constraint on ethical theory, when both may equally be the result\nof more or less arbitrary cultural factors.\n\nPhilosophical audiences typically decline to\nmoralize the offensive behaviors, and we ourselves share their\ntolerant attitude. But of course these audiences\u2014by virtue of\neducational attainments, if not stock portfolios\u2014are\noverwhelmingly high SES. Haidt\u2019s work suggests that it is a\nmistake for a philosopher to say, as Jackson (1998: 32n4; cf. 37)\ndoes, that \u201cmy intuitions reveal the folk conception in as much\nas I am reasonably entitled, as I usually am, to regard myself as\ntypical\u201d. The question is: typical of what demographic? Are\nphilosophers\u2019 ethical responses determined by the philosophical\nsubstance of the examples, or by cultural idiosyncrasies that are very\nplausibly thought to be ethically irrelevant? Once again, until such\npossibilities are ruled out by systematic empirical investigation, the\nphilosophical heft of a thought experiment is open to question.\n\nIn recent years there has been a growing body of research reporting\nthat judgments evoked by moral thought experiments are affected by\nenvironmental factors that look to be completely irrelevant to the\nmoral issue at hand. The presence of dirty pizza boxes and a whiff of\nfart spray (Schnall et al. 2008a), the use of soap (Schnall et al.\n2008b) or an antiseptic handwipe (Zhong et al. 2010), or even the\nproximity of a hand sanitizer dispenser (Helzer & Pizarro 2011)\nhave all been reported to influence moral intuitions. Tobia et al.\n(2013) found that the moral intuitions of both students and\nprofessional philosophers are affected by spraying the questionnaire\nwith a disinfectant spray. Valdesolo and DeSteno (2006) reported that\nviewing a humorous video clip can have a substantial impact on\nparticipant\u2019s moral intuitions. And Strohminger et al. (2011)\nhave shown that hearing different kinds of audio clips (stand-up\ncomedy or inspirational stories from a volume called Chicken Soup\nfor the Soul) has divergent effects on moral intuitions.\n\nHow should moral theorists react to findings like these? One might, of\ncourse, eschew thought experiments in ethical theorizing. While this\nmethodological austerity is not without appeal, it comes at a cost.\nDespite the difficulties, thought experiments are a window, in some\ncases the only accessible window, into important regions of ethical\nexperience. In so far as it is disconnected from the thoughts and\nfeels of the lived ethical life, ethical theory risks being\n\u201cmotivationally inaccessible\u201d, or incapable of engaging\nthe ethical concern of agents who are supposed to live in accordance\nwith the normative standards of the\n theory.[6]\n Fortunately, there is another possibility: continue pursuing the\nresearch program that systematically investigates responses to\nintuition pumps. In effect, the idea is to subject philosophical\nthought experiments to the critical methods of experimental social\npsychology. If investigations employing different experimental\nscenarios and subject populations reveal a clear trend in responses,\nwe can begin to have some confidence that we are identifying a deeply\nand widely shared moral conviction. Philosophical discussion may\nestablish that convictions of this sort should serve as a constraint\non moral theory, while responses to thought experiments that empirical\nresearch determines to lack such solidity, such as those susceptible\nto order, framing or environmental effects, or those admitting of\nstrong cultural variation, may be ones that ethical theorists can\nsafely disregard. \n",
