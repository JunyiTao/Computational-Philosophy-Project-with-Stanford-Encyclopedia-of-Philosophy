The natural assumption may appear to be that we are\ntalking about specimens of the biological species Homo\nsapiens, that is, organisms belonging to the taxon that split\nfrom the rest of the hominin lineage an estimated 150,000 years ago.\nHowever, certain claims seem to be best understood as at least\npotentially referring to organisms belonging to various older species\nwithin the subtribe Homo, with whom specimens of Homo\nsapiens share properties that have often been deemed significant\n(Sterelny 2018: 114).\n\nOn the other hand, the \u201cnature\u201d that is of interest often\nappears to be that of organisms belonging to a more restricted group.\nThere may have been a significant time lag between the speciation of\nanatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) and the evolution\nof behaviourally modern humans, i.e., human populations whose life\nforms involved symbol use, complex tool making, coordinated hunting\nand increased geographic range. Behavioural modernity\u2019s\ndevelopment is often believed only to have been completed by 50,000\nyears ago. If, as is sometimes claimed, behavioural modernity requires\npsychological capacities for planning, abstract thought,\ninnovativeness and symbolism (McBrearty & Brooks 2000: 492) and if\nthese were not yet widely or sufficiently present for several tens of\nthousands of years after speciation, then it may well be\nbehaviourally, rather than anatomically modern humans whose\n\u201cnature\u201d is of interest to many theories. Perhaps the\nrestriction might be drawn even tighter to include only contemporary\nhumans, that is, those specimens of the species who, since the\nintroduction of agriculture around 12,000 years ago, evolved the\nskills and capacities necessary for life in large sedentary,\nimpersonal and hierarchical groups (Kappeler, Fichtel, & van\nSchaik 2019: 68).\n\nIt was, after all, a Greek living less than two and a half millennia\nago within such a sedentary, hierarchically organised population\nstructure, who could have had no conception of the prehistory of the\nbeings he called anthr\u00f4poi, whose thoughts on their\n\u201cnature\u201d have been decisive for the history of\nphilosophical reflection on the subject. It seems highly likely that,\nwithout the influence of Aristotle, discussions of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d would not be structured as they are until today.\n",
