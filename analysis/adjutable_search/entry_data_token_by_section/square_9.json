His\nexamples of true particular negatives with patently empty subject terms\nare\n these:[18]\nSome man who is a donkey is not a donkey. \n\n\n\nWhat is different from being is not.\n\n\nSome thing willed against by a chimera is not willed against by\na chimera.\n\n\nA chimera does not exist.\n\n\nSome man whom a donkey has begotten is not his son.\n\n\n\nSo by the end of the 14th century the issue of empty terms was\nclearly recognized. They were permitted in the theory, the\nO form definitely did not have existential import,\nand the logical theory, stripped of the incorrect special cases of\ncontraposition and obversion, was coherent and immune to 20th century\ncriticism.\n",
