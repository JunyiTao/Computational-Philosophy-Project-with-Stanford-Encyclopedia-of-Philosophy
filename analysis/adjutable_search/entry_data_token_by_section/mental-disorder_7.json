    "main_text": "The Disorder in Mental Disorder || Disunity and Irrationality\n4.1 Disunity and Irrationality\n\nWorks of ancient philosophy are focused more on the psyche\u2019s\nhealth (or eudaimonia) than its illness. Nonetheless, there\nare hints that just as a unified soul is one that is healthy (as well\nas rational and virtuous), a soul lacking unity will be disturbed, or\nmad. Offering an account of the harmonious soul, whose rational and\nnon-rational elements achieve unity, Aristotle leaves us a picture of\nthe warring and fractured state of an unhealthy soul, for\n example.[4]\n The emphasis on disunity is here tied to the vices and irrationality:\na fully unified soul is virtuous and rational, a dis-unified one\nvicious and irrational in its unhealthy divisions. And, while adhering\nto a different account of the passions and a more knowledge-based and\nPlatonic analysis of vice, this link with the vices and virtues is\nalso characteristic of the subsequent Stoic analyses (Irwin 2013). A\nconception of mental illness as psychic disunity (as well as an\nassociation between health, rationality and virtue) reoccurs in later\nphilosophy (in Spinoza, for example), and in psychoanalytic\ntraditions. Within present-day disorder descriptions, some symptom\nclusters readily fit the classical emphasis on disunity (addictions,\nand bipolarity, for example); others, including most personality\ndisorders, are less easily depicted in such terms (see Worrell &\nDenham 2016).\n\nAs a characteristic attributed to mental disorder irrationality or\n\u201cunreason\u201d has been linked to emphasis on order and logic\nduring the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d. Together with the emergence of\nempirical science, this emphasis is seen to have laid the foundation\nfor our contemporary psychiatric categories and\n theories.[5]\n In the present day, cultural norms and intuitive folk psychology\nassign the boundaries of mental disorder, and these intuitions\nconflict about some particular conditions (addictions, and disorders\nof personality, for example). Yet disturbed or disabled doxastic\nstates and capabilities remain core examples of disorder, over which\nintuitive agreement is strong. Characterized by incomprehensibly\ndisordered thought, failure to adjust beliefs in response to new\nevidence, inconsistencies between thought and action, and delusional\nconvictions, psychosis and psychotic thought patterns are regularly\njudged prototypical features of mental disorder. So the rationalistic\nanalysis of disorder corresponds\u2014but only to a reduced version\nof the presently sprawling overall category.\n\nForms of doxastic irrationality are still the mainstay of much policy\nand legal analysis about mental disorder. Assessments of criminal\nresponsibility, of fitness to stand trial, and of the capacity to\nundertake binding contracts, for example, are expressed in terms of\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to know and understand (Reznek 1987;\nRobinson 1996, 2013; Adshead 2008). Ostensibly, construing mental\ndisorder as a want of rationality has been weakened by evidence from\nbehavioral economics showing that holding and acting on well-grounded\nand reasons-responsive beliefs occurs rarely in the general\npopulation, and common prejudices and superstitions seem barely\ndistinguishable from clinical delusions with respect not only to their\nprevalence but to the way they are adopted and maintained (Bortolotti\n2009, 2013, 2020).\n\nConfidence that a want of rationality defines mental disorder is\nsimilarly eroded if, understood as effective social function and\npersonal flourishing, mental health lies in traits such as unwarranted\noptimism, and the distorting tendency to emphasize, and remember,\nsuccess over failure experiences in \u201cpositive\nillusions\u201d(Taylor & Brown 1988; McKay & Dennett 2009;\nJefferson et al. 2017). Along these lines, some illusions, delusions,\nand hallucinations have recently been acknowledged to be\n\u201cperfectly acceptable, sometimes praiseworthy ways of being\nhopeful, committed to imagining and enacting a better world for\noneself and others\u2026making moral and meaningful\nlives\u201d(Flanagan & Graham 2017: 309)\n\nBut as this indicates, whether disorder is usefully characterized as a\nwant of reason also depends on guiding, normative conceptions of\nmental health or eudaimonia, and on the role of reason in\nthose conceptions\u2014not merely on facts of the matter, or on\nconsequentialist reasoning.\n",
