    "main_text": "Notable Figures || Outliers in the Song and Ming\n2.5 Outliers in the Song and Ming\n\nOther than the Northern Song Neo-Confucians described in\n section 2.1,\n every philosopher mentioned heretofore has been a Neo-Confucian in\nthe narrow sense associated with Daoxue (see\n section 1\n on the differences between the broad and narrow senses of\n\u201cNeo-Confucian\u201d). That is, each has been someone who takes\nmost of his cues from the Cheng brothers, most notably by adopting\ntheir robustly metaphysical accounts of human nature and the\nfundamental unity or oneness of things. But philosophers of this sort\ndid not have a monopoly on Confucian discourse, and over the course of\nthe roughly seven centuries of Song, Yuan, and Ming thought there were\na number of talented and innovative Confucian philosophers at the\nborders or outside of these mainstreams.\n\nA once-influential but now somewhat neglected set of philosophers in\nthe Song dynasty are often associated with what is called the\n\u201cYongjia school\u201d of Confucianism, named after the county\nin which some of its most prominent thinkers lived and taught at\nvarious points in their lives. The Yongjia Confucians had roots in the\nteachings of the Cheng brothers and Daoxue, but with the\npassage of time some of the leading thinkers came to see themselves as\nopponents of that tradition, in part because of their impatience with\nspeculative metaphysics and their more practical orientation toward\nissues of governance and administration. Two of the most distinguished\nConfucians aligned with Yongjia were Chen Liang (1143\u20131194) and\nYe Shi (1150\u20131223), both contemporaries and occasional\ninterlocutors of Zhu Xi. Chen and Ye tended to measure public policies\nand moral practices in terms of their contributions to public welfare\nor general social benefit (li \u5229), a tendency that\neventually led some 20th and 21st century\nhistorians to characterize Chen and Ye as \u201cutilitarian\u201d\nthinkers (Qi 1982: 1178\u20131187; Tillman 1982; Xiao 1982: 539). For\nboth Chen and Ye, the rightness and desirability of a particular\npractice was determined by its consequences and not (or at least not\ndirectly) the agents\u2019 motives and character. Chen and Ye also\nargued against accounts of the Way (Dao) that posited it as a\ntimeless, abstract entity independent of concrete affairs and\ncircumstances (Niu 1998; Tillman 1982).\n\nAnother maverick Confucian of this period was Wang Tingxiang\n(1474\u20131544). In opposition to the metaphysical dualists of his\ntime, Wang proposed that the ordinary features and behaviors of\nqi (vital stuff) could account for everything in the cosmos,\nincluding the sources of order and creation that mainstream\nNeo-Confucians tended to identify with irreducible li\n(Patterns) (Ong 2006; Y. Liu 2000: 55\u201385). He also rejected the\nfundamental unity and oneness of the universe and\u2014still more\nastonishingly\u2014denied that a comprehensive unity was even\ndesirable (Kim 2008; Ong 2006). And Wang furthermore took the\ndecidedly unorthodox view that goodness and the predispositions for\nvirtue aren\u2019t necessary features of human nature, suggesting\ninstead that the moral emotions that people often cited as evidence of\nnatural goodness, such as moral shame, are primarily responsive to\nsocial norms and expectations (Ong 2006: 474). In taking this position\nhe defied a centuries-old Confucian consensus about human nature that\nwas rarely contradicted in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties.\n\nPerhaps the most fertile period for those who worked at the periphery\nof the main lines of Neo-Confucianism was five or six decades that\nspanned the collapse of the Ming and the consolidation of the Qing\ndynasty, roughly 1640 to 1700. Although this was a time of instability\nin some parts of China, it nevertheless witnessed declining faith in\nlongstanding political customs as well as budding movements in\nConfucian scholarship that paved the way for more dramatic departures\nfrom orthodoxy. One such movement was the rise of \u201cevidential\nstudies\u201d (kaozheng xue \u8003\u8b49\u5b78),\nunderstood as approaches to scholarship that lean more heavily on\nareas of study like astronomy, geography, mathematics, and especially\nphilology. A leading scholar of evidential studies was Gu Yanwu\n(1613\u20131682), who established a reputation not just as a\nprecocious philologist but also as a creative political reformer\n(Angle 2002: 89\u201393; Brown 2011; Gu 2017). Another remarkably\noriginal and prolific philosopher was Wang Fuzhi (1619\u20131692),\nwho reconceived all of Neo-Confucian metaphysics and moral psychology,\nworking against the prevailing dualism of li and qi\nand developing an account of the virtues that made considerably more\nroom for human desires and emotions (J. Liu 2010, 2018: 157\u2013179,\n265\u2013284; Cheng 1991). A third was Huang Zongxi\n(1610\u20131695), who wrote comprehensive intellectual histories of\nthe Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties and offered some of the most\nradical political reforms ever put forward by a traditional Confucian\nthinker, contending that scholars and ministers be permitted to\ncriticize their ruler openly and proposing that a variety of\nprocedural requirements be imposed on the deliberation and\ndecision-making of the emperor (SYXA; MRXA; MYDFL; de Bary\n2011). All of these philosophers (and especially Huang) completed\nsignificant portions of their work in the early years of the Qing\ndynasty, but they were products of the distinctive intellectual and\nsocial circumstances witnessed at the end of the Ming, when Confucian\nthinkers started to consider political reforms in earnest and began to\ndoubt a great deal of what had, for centuries, passed for obvious\ntruths about the Confucian canon.\n",
