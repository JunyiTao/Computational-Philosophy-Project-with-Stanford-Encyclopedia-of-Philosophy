The history Habermas\nreconstructs is a decline and fall of self-reflection in\nWissenschaft\u2014science in the broadest sense. His\nparticular interest is in Erkenntniskritik, namely the\ntradition of critical philosophy from Kant, German Idealism, and Hegel\nthrough to Marx, which, on his account, is gradually side-lined by\nways of thinking that employ the methods of positivistic natural and\nsocial science. His thesis is: \u201cThat we disavow reflection is\npositivism\u201d (1968b: 9 [1971a: vii]).\n\nHabermas\u2019s analysis takes its cue from Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 idea\nof reification\u2014the idea that beings, forms of life, and social\nrelations assume the appearance of nature (Luk\u00e1cs 1971:\n83\u2013223). Habermas\u2019s analysis reveals this illusory\nindependence and naturalness to be historical, and in principle\nreversible. Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s thesis that: \u201cAll\nreification is a forgetting\u201d also animates the analysis\n(Horkheimer & Adorno 1971 [2002: 191]). Positivism in the\nempirical and social sciences, and historicism in the cultural\nsciences, Habermas argues, exhibit a merely contemplative stance\ntoward their respective objects, an attitude that obscures the point\nthat science and knowledge is fundamentally a human enterprise that\nserves human interests, which are rooted in the natural history of the\nspecies (1968b [1971a: 301\u20134]).\n\nAccording to Habermas, there are three knowledge-constitutive\ninterests. The empirical and natural sciences are governed by the\ncognitive interest in the technical control of objectified processes.\nThe historical-hermeneutical sciences are shaped by a practical\ninterest in orienting action and reaching understanding, while\nself-reflection (and Erkenntniskritik) are determined by a\ncognitive interest in emancipation and in\nM\u00fcndigkeit\u2014autonomy and responsibility (1968b\n[1971a: 313\u2013314]). Habermas\u2019s overall aim is to explain\nhow Marxism, and social theory more broadly, succumbed to a\npositivistic self-misconception, while rescuing the animus of\nMarx\u2019s theory of society for critical social theory, by\nconnecting it with the interest in emancipation and autonomy, and with\na method of critical self-reflection.\n\nHabermas\u2019s long essay \u201cTechnology and Science as\n\u2018Ideology\u2019\u201d is a festschrift for Herbert Marcuse,\nand not an uncritical one (1968a [1970]). It deals with topics he\nbroached in the volume of essays Theory and Practice (1971\n[1973b]) that broadly argue against the reduction of political theory\nfrom a body of thought answering practical questions of how one should\nlive, to \u201ca form of social engineering that dispenses with\npublic discourse\u201d (Celikates & Jaeggi 2009 [2017: 261]).\n\nHabermas develops the following theses that exhibit the major concerns\nof his early work, based on the following diagnosis: Capitalist\nsocieties institutionalize the aim of economic growth, which has the\neffect of expanding sub-systems of instrumental reason. In that\ncontext, science and technology cease to be connected to a realm of\nvalues that help people answer practical questions of how they want to\nlive, and become absorbed instead into the economic and administrative\nsystems as forces of production geared to the aim of continuous\neconomic growth. Politics, instead of residing in a popular practice\nof democratic self-determination, atrophies to the technocratic\nadministration of public affairs in the hands of small groups of\nexperts, leading to a depoliticization of ordinary citizens (Celikates\n& Jaeggi 2009 [2017: 261]). The question is who can reconnect\ntechnocratic politics with the \u201cgood life\u201d.\nHabermas\u2019s answer is that students may be part of the solution,\nsince their protests do not aim at securing them \u201ca larger share\nof social rewards\u201d, but are targeted against the reduction of\nsocial and political life to economic growth and individual gain\n(1970: chapter 6, 120\u2013122).\n",
