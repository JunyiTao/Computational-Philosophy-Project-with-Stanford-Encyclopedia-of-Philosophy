But departures from random mating are\nactually quite common. Organisms may tend to choose mates who are\nsimilar to them phenotypically or genotypically\u2014a mating system\nknown as \u2018positive assortment\u2019. Alternatively, organisms\nmay choose mates dissimilar to them\u2014\u2018negative\nassortment\u2019. Another type of departure from random mating is\ninbreeding, or preferentially mating with relatives.\n\nAnalysing the consequences of non-random mating gets quite\ncomplicated, but some conclusions are fairly easily seen. Firstly,\nnon-random mating does not in itself affect gene frequencies (so\narguably is not an evolutionary \u2018force\u2019 on a par with\nselection, mutation and migration); rather, it affects genotype\nfrequencies. To appreciate this point, note that the gene frequency of\na population, at the zygotic stage, is equal to the gene frequency in\nthe pool of successful gametes from which the zygotes are formed. The\npattern of mating simply determines the way in which haploid gametes\nare \u2018packaged\u2019 into diploid zygotes. Thus if a random\nmating population suddenly starts to mate non-randomly, this will have\nno effect on gene frequencies.\n\nSecondly, positive assortative mating will tend to decrease the\nproportion of heterozygotes in the population,. To see this, consider\nagain a single locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), with\nfrequencies \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in a given population. Suppose that\ninitially the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so the\nproportion of \\(A_1 A_2\\) heterozygotes is \\(2pq\\). If the population\nthen starts to mate completely assortatively, i.e., mating only occurs\nbetween organisms of identical genotype, it is obvious that the\nproportion of heterozygotes must decline. For \\(A_1 A_1 \\times A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_2 A_2 \\times A_2 A_2\\) matings will produce no\nheterozygotes; and only half the progeny of \\(A_1 A_2 \\times A_1 A_2\\)\nmatings will be heterozygotic (on average). So the proportion of\nheterozygotes in the second generation must be less than\n\\(2pq\\). Conversely, negative assortment will tend to increase the\nproportion of heterozygotes from what it would be under Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium.\n\nWhat about inbreeding? In general, inbreeding will tend to increase\nthe homozygosity of a population, like positive assortment (Hartl\n2020, ch. 3). This is because relatives tend to be genotypically\nsimilar. Inbreeding often has negative effects on organismic\nfitness\u2014a phenomenon known as \u2018inbreeding\ndepression\u2019. The explanation for this is that deleterious\nalleles often tend to be recessive, so have no phenotypic effect when\nfound in heterozygotes. Inbreeding reduces the proportion of\nheterozygotes, making recessive alleles more likely to be found in\nhomozygotes where their negative phenotypic effects become apparent.\nThe converse phenomenon\u2014\u2018hybrid vigour\u2019 resulting\nfrom outbreeding\u2014is widely utilised by animal and plant\nbreeders.\n",
