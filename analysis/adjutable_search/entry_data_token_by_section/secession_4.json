    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede || Remedial Right Only Theories\n2.1 Remedial Right Only Theories\n\n\nRemedial right only theories, as their designation suggests, hold\nthat secession is justified as a remedy of last resort against\ninjustices perpetrated against the aspiring secessionist group by the\nstate. Remedial right theorists assume that a sufficiently just state\nhas legitimate jurisdiction over the people within its territory. This\nlegitimacy confers on the state permission to rule over its all\ncitizens\u2014including those members of aspiring secessionist groups.\nMatters can change only if the state violates the conditions of its\nlegitimacy, which requires that the state commit injustices that are\nsufficiently weighty so as to undermine the state\u2019s claim to\nlegitimate rule. Various remedial right only views have different views\nas to what types of injustices are of sufficient weightiness to ground\nthe right to secede. The most prominent view of this sort, advanced by\nAllen Buchanan, identifies three particular kinds of injustices for\nwhich secession can be a remedy: 1) genocide or other large-scale\nviolations of basic human rights; 2) unjust annexation; and 3) the\npersistent violation of intrastate autonomy agreements (Buchanan 2003:\np. 351). Recently, Buchanan has also considered the possibility of\nanother condition: failure to enter into negotiations with the possible\noutcome of an intrastate autonomy regime in the case of any group that\nhas a reasonable claim to such autonomy (Buchanan, personal\ncommunication, August 2021).\n\n\nGiven the tendency for unilateral secession to provoke massive\nviolence, the obvious strength of the remedial right only approach is\nthat it places a significant constraint on unilateral\nsecession\u2014namely, the requirement of a serious and persistent\ngrievance of injustice suffered by the secessionists. To that extent,\nit captures the intuition that nonconsensual state-breaking, like\nrevolution, is a grave affair requiring a weighty justification. More\nspecifically, this view provides a plausible explanation of how the\nstate can come to lose its entitlement to the territory: it does so by\nfailing to do what gives states a moral claim to control territory in\nthe first place, namely, providing justice for those within its\njurisdiction.\n\n\nAnother strength of the remedial right only approach is that it\nappears to provide the right incentives: States that are just (or at\nleast do not persist in very serious injustices) are morally immune to\nunilateral secession and entitled to international support in\nmaintaining their territorial integrity. On the other hand, if, as the\ntheory recommends, a unilateral right to secede as a remedy for serious\nand persistent injustices is acknowledged, this will give states an\nincentive to act more justly.\n\n\nSome critics have objected that the remedial right only approach to\nunilateral secession is disturbingly irrelevant to the concerns of many\ngroups seeking self-determination. They say that in most cases it is\nnationalism that fuels the quest for self-determination, not grievances\nof injustice per se (Moore 1998a). An advocate of the remedial\nright only view might respond that the latter is only an account of\nunilateral secession, not a comprehensive theory of self-determination.\nThus, the remedial right only approach to unilateral secession is\ncompatible with a fairly permissive stance toward intrastate autonomy,\nincluding various forms of self-government for national minorities\nwithin the state. The point is to uncouple the unilateral (claim-)right\nto secede from the various legitimate interests that\ngroups\u2014including national minorities\u2014can have in various\nforms of self-determination short of statehood.\n\n\nMoreover, the remedial right only approach need not reject claims to\nindependence on the part of nations; it only rejects the much stronger\nassertion that nations as such have a unilateral right to secede. In\nmany cases the groups that suffer persistent grave injustices are in\nfact nations, and therefore would be accorded the right to secede by\nthe remedial right only theory. To that extent it is inaccurate to say\nthat this type of theory ignores the realities of national\nself-determination movements. But just as important, the remedial right\nonly theory, when integrated into a comprehensive theory of\nself-determination that includes a principled account of when\nintrastate autonomy arrangements warrant international support, will\naddress the concerns of national minorities in cases in which they do\nnot have a unilateral right to secede.\n\n\nWhat the remedial right only approach does not do is\nconcede that nations as such\u2014independently of any persisting\npattern of grave injustices\u2014have a unilateral right to secede.\nBut it can be argued that this is a virtue of the account, not a\ndefect. It thereby avoids the objection to which ascriptivist theories\nare vulnerable, namely, that they endorse a unilateral right to secede\nfor all nations in a world in which virtually every state contains more\nthan one nation and in which nations are not neatly sorted into\ndiscrete regions of the state\u2019s territory, but instead claim the\nsame territories. The point is not simply that the ascriptivist view is\nunfeasible; its support for the idea of the ethnically exclusive state\nis an incitement to ethnic cleansing if not genocide. However, this\nline of argument can supply an effective reply to the objection that\nremedial right only theories neglect the importance of nationalism only\nif the account of the right to secede a remedial right only theory\nadvances is properly situated in a plausible, more comprehensive theory\nof self-determination.\n",
