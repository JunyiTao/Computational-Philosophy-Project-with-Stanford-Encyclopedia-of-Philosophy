Conclusion\n\nAs the second century of genetics unfolds, there is little reason to\nthink the influential science will slow down. In New Zealand,\ngovernment leaders proposed using gene-editing technologies to\neradicate invasive species from the island nation (Yong 2017). In the\nUnited States, the All of Us Research Program rolled out, with the aim\nbeing to collect DNA from 1,000,000 Americans and link that\ninformation up with medical records so as to usher in a new genomic\nparadigm of precision medicine (Pear 2016). In China, scientists\ninserted a human gene involved in brain development into monkeys in\norder to see how the addition of that human gene altered the\nmonkey\u2019s own development (CBC Radio in\n Other Internet Resources).\n These programs, practices, and proposals raised profound questions\nabout the dangers of intervening on complex ecosystems, the politics\nof distributing scarce biomedical resources, and the ethics of\nnon-human animal research. As genetics progresses, so too will the\nphilosophical questions about it.\n",
