    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics || Autonomy\n4.1 Autonomy\n\n\u201cFreedom is the only reality in wishing, willing, sensing and\nstriving\u201d, writes F. Schlegel (TPL II: 155). While the absolute\nreality of freedom might not admit of a proof, according to many of\nthe romantics, human beings should nonetheless approximate freedom by\ndeveloping autonomy\u2014self-determination and self-legislation.\nAutonomy is the right of the individual to think for herself and act\nrationally and freely (TPL II: 155). The work of art and aesthetic\njudgment were seen as paradigmatic expressions of autonomy and, as\nsuch, as splendid models for the cultivation of individual human\nautonomy. For (as discussed in\n \u00a73.3)\n neither the creation of art nor its appreciation is grounded in prior\ngiven laws. And yet, both the production and judgment of art are not\nlawless, but normatively governed by the laws generated autonomously\nby each individual work and by each individual aesthetic judgment.\nPoetry is a \u201claw unto itself\u201d.\n\nThis characteristic of the production and judgment of art should not\nonly be incorporated into the way every person is to govern\nherself\u2014as the source of her own rational laws rather than as\nsubject to external laws, and as self-determining rather than\npassively determined\u2014but also serve as a model for the way in\nwhich every person should be respected and treated. Aesthetics\nprovides us with a paradigm for following two central ethical\ndemands\u2014the demand to govern oneself autonomously and the demand\nto respect everyone else as autonomous.\n\nThese two duties, then, constitute another explanation of the\n\u201ccategorical imperative of the genius\u201d previously\nmentioned\u2014the demand that every person be a genius. For if every\nindividual is to be autonomous, she should fashion herself after the\nmodel of the artist.\n",
