Hobbes on Experimentation: Conflict with Robert Boyle and the Royal Society\n\nHobbes\u2019 conflict with Robert Boyle concerning the nature of\nnatural philosophy in general, and the air-pump experiments in\nparticular, took place over several years and in a series of\n publications.[5]\n Hobbes wrote Dialogus Physicus (1661; a second version\nappeared in\n 1668)[6]\n as a dialogue aimed at criticizing Boyle\u2019s New Experiments\nPhysico-Mechanical (1660). Boyle responded to various criticisms\nin works such as An Examen of Mr. T. Hobbes his Dialogus Physicus\nde Natura A\u00ebris (1662), An Examen of Mr. Hobbes\u2019\nDoctrine about Cold (1665), and Animadversions upon Mr.\nHobbes\u2019 Problemata de Vacuo (1674). The most comprehensive\nand influential treatment of this period of Hobbes\u2019 life is\nShapin and Schaffer\u2019s Leviathan and the Air-Pump\n (1985).[7]\n This section will focus upon Hobbes\u2019 criticisms of the air-pump\nexperiments in the Dialogus Physicus with an aim of showing\nhow they illuminate our understanding of Hobbes\u2019 natural\nphilosophy.\n\nMost generally both Boyle and Hobbes viewed the natural world as\ncomposed of bits of matter in motion. Even if there were some points\nof agreement between the versions of mechanical philosophy offered by\nboth Boyle and\n Hobbes,[8]\n there are important differences. A crucial difference between the two\nrelates to the status (or lack thereof) of Laws of Nature. While Boyle\ntalked about the laws of nature as established by God (see the section on\n Laws of Nature in the entry on Boyle),\n Hobbes restricted discussion of laws to the laws of human conduct\ndiscovered by those who escape the state of nature and create a\ncommonwealth. In contrast to laws of the natural world, Hobbes\narticulated a priori principles of motion at the foundation\nof his physics in De Corpore VIII.19 and IX.7. Rather than\nbeing known as laws of motion, issued by some divine lawmaker, these\nHobbesian principles of motion are explicated by thought experiments\nand seem to rely upon a version of the principle of sufficient reason\n(Jesseph 2006: 132). Although Hobbes held that they were true of all\nhuman experience, since Hobbes holds that we cannot know the actual\ncauses of natural phenomena he would have to admit that nature might,\nunbeknownst to us, act otherwise. However, despite these differences,\nthe primary dissimilarity that emerges between Hobbes and Boyle\nconcerning the air-pump experiments is one of method as it relates to\nthe status of experiments/experience (see the section on\n Philosophy of Experiment in the entry on Boyle).\n\nGiven that Hobbes was convinced of the impossibility of knowing the\nactual causes of natural phenomena, he held that any phenomenon admits\nof multiple possible explanations. This should not be taken to imply\nthat Hobbes saw all explanations, and thus all possible causes or\nsuppositions, as standing on equal footing. Instead, Hobbes held that\nwork in first philosophy and geometry must be completed prior to\nattempting to make any explanations in natural philosophy. This seems\nto be what Hobbes meant in the De Homine extended quotation\nprovided above when he said that \u201cnothing can be demonstrated by\nphysics without something also being demonstrated a\npriori\u201d (MC 42; OL II.93). When giving an explanation,\nHobbes held that one should ideally appeal to those causes that are\ndemonstrable from geometry when mixed with facts and rule out those\nthat are not intelligible according to geometrical principles.\n\nIn contrast, Boyle\u2019s method prescribed that instead of bringing\ncausal principles to an experiment and expecting to explain some\nphenomenon by appeal to those principles, one should attempt to arrive\nat a supposition that would explain a phenomenon only after repeated,\ncareful experiments. Thomas Sprat detailed the care taken in the\ndesign of experiments and the manner in which Royal Society members\nwere formed into committees that shared parts of an experiment so that\n\u201c[b]y this union of eyes, and hands\u201d they were able to\ngain \u201ca full comprehension of the object in all its\nappearances\u201d (Sprat 1667: 85).\n\nWe can make sense of Hobbes\u2019 direct criticisms of Boyle\u2019s\nprioritization of experiment with this methodological difference in\nmind. Hobbes\u2019 view of the foundational role played by first\nphilosophy and mathematics over experiment/experience is clear when he\nclaimed in Dialogus Physicus that\n\n\n\u2026ingenuity is one thing and method is another. Here method is\nneeded. The causes of those things done by motion are to be\ninvestigated through a knowledge of motion, the knowledge of which,\nthe noblest part of geometry, is hitherto untouched. (DP 347; OL\nIV.236)\n\n\nAccording to Hobbes, then, one must have geometrical principles\nalready in place to aid in choosing a supposition before engaging in\nexperiments. Unlike the Royal Society\u2019s aim to have multiple\nmembers examine the same object, Hobbes emphasized the need for\nindividual conceptual clarity, something that could be accomplished\nfrom an armchair.\n\nThis criticism from Hobbes, and Boyle\u2019s rebuttals relying upon\nevidence from experiments, could be seen as a conflict of\nBoyle\u2019s experimental natural philosophy against a form of\nspeculative natural\n philosophy.[9]\n However, it is important to avoid taking Hobbes\u2019 criticisms of\nBoyle\u2019s method to imply that Hobbes completely eschewed\nexperiment/experience while engaging in natural-philosophical\nexplanations. Indeed, Hobbes held that both natural history and civil\nhistory are \u201cuseful (no, indeed necessary) for philosophy\u201d\n(CSL 189; OL I.9). Experiment/experience play the role of establishing\nthat some phenomenon occurs, what we have seen Hobbes called the\n\u2018that\u2019, but one should never hope, according to Hobbes, to\nglean a possible cause from mere observations, even if those\nobservations were carefully documented and repeated many times.\n\nThis is clear when in the Dialogus Physicus Hobbes, speaking\nthrough speaker A, often granted the observational reports of the\nexperimenters without question. For example, speaker A does not\nquestion what the experimenters claim they observed regarding a\nbladder that had been placed inside the air-pump and weighed, noting\n\u201cThey can be certain that the scale in which the bladder is, is\nmore depressed than the other, their eyes bearing witness\u201d (DP\n369; OL IV.261). Instead of criticizing the experimenters\u2019\nreliance upon observations, speaker A argues that the experimenters\ncannot know, in the case of this explanation, what the cause of the\nscale being depressed is because their posited cause (the\n\u201cnatural gravity\u201d of the air) does not allow them to\nexplain why the scale is depressed after the air-pump is engaged. In\ncontrast, speaker A offers a possible cause that is borrowed, with an\nexplicit citation, from Hobbes\u2019 geometrical account of\n\u201csimple circle motion\u201d and \u201cfermentation\u201d\ndeveloped in De Corpore 21.5 (Adams 2017).\n",
