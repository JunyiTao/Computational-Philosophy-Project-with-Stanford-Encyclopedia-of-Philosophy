    "main_text": "\n\nFederalism is the theory or advocacy of federal principles for\ndividing powers between member units and common institutions. Unlike\nin a unitary state, sovereignty in federal political orders is\nnon-centralized, often constitutionally, between at least two levels\nso that units at each level have final authority and can be self\ngoverning in some issue area. Citizens thus have political obligations\nto, or have their rights secured by, two authorities. The division of\npower between the member unit and center may vary, typically the\ncenter has powers regarding defense and foreign policy, but member\nunits may also have international roles. The decision-making bodies of\nmember units may also participate in central decision-making bodies.\nMuch recent philosophical attention is spurred by renewed political\ninterest in federalism and backlashes against particular instances,\ncoupled with empirical findings concerning the requisite and\nlegitimate basis for stability and trust among citizens in federal\npolitical orders. Philosophical contributions have addressed the\ndilemmas and opportunities facing Canada, Australia, Europe, Russia,\nIraq, Nepal, Ethiopia and Nigeria, to mention just a few areas where\nfederal arrangements are seen as interesting solutions to accommodate\ndifferences among populations divided by ethnic or cultural cleavages\nyet seeking a common, often democratic, political order.\n",
