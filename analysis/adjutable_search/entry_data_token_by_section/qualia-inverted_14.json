    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026For the Explanatory Gap\n3.7 \u2026For the Explanatory Gap\n\n\nMany philosophers think there is an \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d\n(Levine 1983, 2001) between physical facts and facts about conscious\nexperience. On this view, even if consciousness is a physical\nphenomenon, it cannot be given a physical explanation. Inverted\nspectrum scenarios often play a role in arguments for the gap:\nLet\u2019s call the physical story for seeing red\n\u201c\\(R\\)\u201d and the physical story for seeing green\n\u201c\\(G\\ldots\\)\u201d When we consider the qualitative\ncharacter of our visual experiences when looking at ripe McIntosh\napples, as opposed to looking at ripe cucumbers, the difference is not\nexplained by appeal to \\(G\\) and \\(R\\). For \\(R\\)\ndoesn\u2019t really explain why I have the one kind of qualitative\nexperience\u2014the kind I have when looking at McIntosh \napples\u2014and not the other. As evidence for this, note that it seems\njust as easy to imagine \\(G\\) as to imagine \\(R\\) underlying\nthe qualitative experience that is in fact associated with \\(R\\).\nThe reverse, of course, also seems quite imaginable. (Levine 1983,\n356\u20137)\n\n\nThe argument for the gap suggested by Levine 1983 can be set out as\nfollows:\n\nArgument D\n\nP1.\n\nIf a physical theory \\(T\\) explains the fact that we have\nexperiences with \\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at\nMcIntosh apples, and experiences with \\(Q_{G}\\)\nwhen looking at cucumbers, then it is not imaginable that the explanans\nholds without the explanandum. That is, it is not imaginable that\n\\(T\\) holds and we do not have experiences with\n\\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at McIntosh apples\n(etc.).\nP2.\n\nA red-green spectrum inversion scenario in which \\(T\\)\nholds is imaginable.\nHence:\n\nC.\n\nNo physical theory explains the fact that we have experiences\nwith \\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at McIntosh apples,\nand experiences with \\(Q_{G}\\) when looking at\ncucumbers.\n\n\n\nNotice that Argument D does not have as a premise a spectrum\ninversion hypothesis\u2014that a certain spectrum inversion\nscenario is possible. All the argument requires is that the\nspectrum inversion scenario is imaginable. Indeed, since\nLevine is a physicalist, he thinks that this scenario is not\npossible.\n\n\nWhat is the intended interpretation of \u2018imagine\u2019 in P1\nand P2? (In the literature \u2018conceive\u2019 is used\ninterchangeably.) The usual answer (Levine 2001, Ch. 2) is this:\n\\(p\\) is imaginable iff not-\\(p\\) is not a priori.\nOn this interpretation, P1 amounts to this: it is a priori\nthat if the explanans holds, so does the explanandum; that is, that the\nexplanans a priori entails the explanandum. This can be\nmotivated by appeal to the \u201cdeductive-nomological\u201d model of\nexplanation (see Hempel 1965, and the entry on\n scientific explanation);\n this\nmodel is controversial, and in fact Levine rejects it, but he argues\nthat there is a broader motivation:\nFrom the brief survey of current theories of scientific\nexplanation just presented, I think the following claim can be\njustified: in a good scientific explanation, the explanans either\nentails the explanandum, or it entails a probability distribution over\na range of alternatives, among which the explanandum resides. (2001,\n74)\n\n\nOne might resist Argument D by denying P2 (for some ammunition, see\nHardin 1987; 1993, 134\u201342; for a reply see Levine 1991; see also Hardin\n1991). A much more common response is to deny P1 (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; for a reply see Chalmers and Jackson 2001).\n\n\nOne exegetical complication is that Levine himself now denies P1,\nwhile continuing to maintain the existence of the explanatory gap on\nthe basis of an argument related to Argument D, although somewhat more\ncomplicated (2001, Ch. 3). And in any case, just like the inverted\nspectrum argument against behaviorism, functionalism and physicalism\n(see subsection 3.1 above), inverted spectrum scenarios are not playing\nan essential role in the case for the gap, and indeed Levine 2001 leans\nmore heavily on \u201cabsent qualia\u201d scenarios: \u201cThe\nconceivability of zombies\u2026is the principal manifestation of the\nexplanatory gap\u201d (79).\n",
