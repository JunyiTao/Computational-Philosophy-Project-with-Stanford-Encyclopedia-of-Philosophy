    "main_text": "Self-Deceit and Ignorance\n8. Influence\n\nButler\u2019s Sermons were read in the eighteenth century, in\nparticular after the publication of the Analogy, and went\nthrough multiple editions. The Analogy was reprinted many\ntimes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as were\nButler\u2019s works. His initial influence seems to have been\ngreatest on Scottish philosophers, including (perhaps) his\ncontemporary Francis Hutcheson, George Turnbull, David Fordyce, David\nHume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, and their fellow travellers \u2014\nnotably Edmund Burke. Hume sought to meet Butler and emended the\nmanuscript copy of A Treatise on Human Nature he gave to him\nfor fear it would cause offense. Hume\u2019s and Smith\u2019s\naccounts of sympathy, compassion, resentment, justice, and their\nempirical attitude towards moral psychology (and to the centrality of\nmoral psychology for ethics) and the limits of metaphysical\nexplanations in morals bear Butler\u2019s influence. Hume\u2019s\ndiscussion of induction in his Treatise has also been seen as\na criticism of Butler\u2019s procedure in the Analogy\n(Russell 2008). Butler was also widely read in Germany. Solomon\nMaimon, for example, quotes Butler\u2019s \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d in the Preface to his Autobiography. In the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century Butler\u2019s\nSermons became more influential than the Analogy,\ndue to their influence at Oxford and Cambridge and particularly on\nWilliam Whewell (see Tennant 195\u2013199) and Sidgwick. Throughout\nthe later nineteenth century and the twentieth century they were\ndiscussed by and had great impact on many of the central moral\nphilosophers of the Anglo-American tradition \u2014 G. E. Moore, H.\nA. Pritchard, and particularly W. D. Ross, among many. Butler\u2019s\ninfluence and importance has persisted (see, for example, the section\non Butlerian Accounts in the entry on\n forgiveness).\n",
