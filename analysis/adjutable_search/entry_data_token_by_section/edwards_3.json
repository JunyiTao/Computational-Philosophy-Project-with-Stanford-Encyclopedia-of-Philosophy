    "main_text": "Metaphysics || God as Being in General\n2.3 God as Being in General\n\nGod is \u201cbeing in general.\u201d He \u201cis the sum of all\nbeing, and there is no being without his being; all things are in him\nand he in all\u201d (\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d no. 880; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 20, 122). Edwards appears to have borrowed the\nphrase \u201cbeing in general\u201d from Malebranche. What does he\nmean by it?\n\nHe does not mean that God is the power of being or being as such as\nearlier commentators like Clyde Holbrook and Douglas Elwood have\nsuggested. God is neither a power nor a universal but a concrete\nentity or substance \u2014 a necessarily existing \u201cintelligent\nwilling agent such as our souls, only without our imperfections, and\nnot some inconceivable, unintelligent, necessary agent\u201d\n(\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d no. 383; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 13,\n452).\n\nTrue Virtue associates being with capacity or power, and\nasserts that \u201cdegree of existence\u201d is a function of\n\u201cgreater capacity or power,\u201d of having \u201cevery\nfaculty and every positive quality in an higher degree. An\narchangel must be supposed to have more existence, and to be\nevery way further removed from nonentity than a worm\nor a flea\u201d (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 8, 546). Miscellany 94 identifies perfect entity and\nperfect activity:\n\nGod is a pure act\u2026because that which acts perfectly is all act,\nand nothing but act. There is an image of this in created beings that\napproach to perfect action. [Thus,] the saints of heaven are all\ntransfigured into love, dissolved into joy, become activity itself,\nchanged into mere ecstasy. (Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 13, 260f.)\n\n\n\u201cThe Discourse on the Trinity\u201d claims that there is no\ndistinction between substance and act in the divine essence because\nGod\u2019s essence is both \u201cwholly substance and wholly\nact\u201d (Edwards 1957, vol. 21, 116). And \u201cThe Mind\u201d\nno. 45 identifies being with consciousness. \u201cPerceiving being\nonly is properly being\u201d (Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 6,\n363). Although Edwards never systematically developed or integrated\nthese scattered observations, their drift is toward the identification\nof being with mind in act, and of degree of being with degree of mind\nor consciousness and the comparative perfection of the activity in\nwhich it is engaged. God's consciousness and power are unlimited, and\nhis activity is perfect. His being is therefore unlimited.\n\nWhy, though, is God being in general? Because finite beings are\nabsolutely and immediately dependent upon him for both their being and\nproperties. Indeed, as the only true substance and only true cause,\ncreated beings are no more than God's \u201cshadows\u201d or\n\u201cimages.\u201d (While \u201cparticular minds\u201d deliberate\nand choose, and so possess a kind of agency, they lack real power and\nare thus no more than images of divine agency. Because they lack not\nonly power but also consciousness and will, bodies are even further\nremoved from real agency and hence are, as Edwards says, mere shadows\nof being.) As the only true substance and only true cause, God is the\n\u201chead\u201d of the system of beings, its \u201cchief\npart,\u201d an absolute sovereign whose power and perfection are so\ngreat that \u201call other beings are as nothing to him, and all\nother excellency\u2026as nothing and less than nothing,\u2026in\ncomparison of his\u201d (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 8, 451). \u201cThe whole system of created beings\nin comparison of him is as the light dust of the balance\u201d\n(\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d no. 1208; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 23,\n133). \u2018Being in general,\u2019 then, refers to the system of\nbeings \u2014 primarily to God but to \u201cparticular\nbeings,\u201d too, in so far as they depend upon and more or less\nadequately reflect him.\n\nThe claim that God is the only real substance, the \u201cproper\nentity\u201d of things, has led to accusations of pantheism. Students\nof Edwards have responded by insisting on a distinction in Edwards\nbetween God and creatures. The distinction is real but insufficient to\nrefute charges of pantheism. For, historically, pantheisms do not\nidentify the divine with nature as such but, rather, with nature's\nsubstance or essence or inner being or power. Natural phenomena aren't\nidentical with the divine. They are its modes or properties or parts.\nEdwards clearly believes that God is the world's real substance.\nHowever, the sense of his assertion is very different from that of the\npantheists. In claiming that God is the world's substance Edwards\nmeans that God's decrees are the only cause of an entity's being and\ncharacteristics. He isn't a pantheist because the relation between God\nand the world is construed as a relation between a creative volition\nand its immediate effects. Edwards' model is not a whole and its\nparts, or a substance (a bearer of properties) and its properties, or\nan essence and its accidents, but agent causality.\n",
