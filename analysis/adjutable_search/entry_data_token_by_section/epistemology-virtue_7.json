    "main_text": "Contextualism\n8. Contextualism\n\nAccording to a widely debated view in recent epistemology,\ncontextualism, the truth conditions for knowledge attributions such as\n\u201cS knows that P\u201d are context-sensitive, due to the\ncontext-sensitivity of the cognitive verb \u201cknow\u201d (for a\nreview, see Rysiew 2016). Contextualists disagree over how to model\nthe alleged context-sensitivity. Some say \u201cknow\u201d is an\nindexical possessing a context-invariant character that is a function\nfrom contexts to contents (Cohen 2013). Others claim that\n\u201cknows\u201d is a vague predicate in need of contextual\nsupplementation to predicate a determinate property (Heller 1999).\nCritics argue that leading contextualist proposals are ad hoc or\nunmotivated because we lack independent evidence that\n\u201cknows\u201d is context-sensitive in these ways (Stanley 2005),\nor because behavioral experiments demonstrate that people do not\nevaluate knowledge attributions in the way that leading contextualists\nhave assumed or predicted (Turri 2016b).\n\nGreco (2004, 2008) defends a version of contextualism, what he calls\n\u201cvirtue contextualism\u201d. Virtue contextualism emerges from\nthe basic idea, mentioned above, that to know is to believe the truth\nbecause of your intellectual virtue or ability. When we say\n\u201cbecause of your intellectual virtue or ability\u201d, how are\nwe to understand \u201cbecause\u201d? In general, explanatory talk\nis context-sensitive. It is context-sensitive in two primary ways.\nFirst, abnormal features tend to be explanatorily salient.\nThere\u2019s a panic in a Manhattan apartment building, which happens\nvery soon after a tiger wanders into the lobby. We have no trouble\nidentifying the panic\u2019s cause: the tiger. That\u2019s true even\nthough the tiger\u2019s presence isn\u2019t individually sufficient\nto cause a panic\u2014people must also fear tigers, but they normally\ndo. Second, our interests and purposes single out certain features as\nespecially relevant. We tend to focus on things we can control. If a\nstudent asks a teacher why he failed the exam, the teacher might point\nout that he rarely came to class and didn\u2019t pick up a study\nguide until the morning of the exam.\n\nIf explanatory talk is generally context-sensitive, and knowledge-talk\nis just a species of explanatory-talk, then perhaps\nknowledge-attributions are too. By changing what seems normal or by\nchanging our interests and purpose, we might go from a context where\nsaying \u201cS believes the truth because of her virtue\u201d\nexpresses a truth, to a context where uttering the same words\nexpresses a falsehood. And since saying \u201cS knows\u201d is\ntantamount to saying \u201cS believes the truth because of her\nvirtue\u201d, it follows that knowledge-attributions are likewise\ncontext-sensitive. By deriving its account of context-sensitivity from\nthe general character of explanatory-talk, virtue contextualism might\navoid the charge that it is unmotivated and ad hoc. However, further\nwork is required to test whether the theory fits with people\u2019s\nactual linguistic behavior.\n",
