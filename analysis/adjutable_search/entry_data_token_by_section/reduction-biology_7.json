The same higher\nlevel phenomenon (e.g., a Mendelian trait such as coat color) can be\nproduced by several different molecular mechanisms or a higher level\nphenomenon is realized by different kinds of molecular configurations\n (multiple realization).\n This is a potential problem for both theory reduction and explanatory\nreduction (though to differing degrees). In defense of his model of\ntheory reduction, Schaffner (1976) replies that it is sufficient to\nspecify one such molecular situation. Then the higher level situation,\nwhich is determined by the molecular constellation, can be derived\nlogically from this molecular specification of the higher level\nsituation. However, one has to be clear about the nature of the\nexplanandum in a reductive explanation (i.e., what is the\nconsequent of a reductive deduction). Is it a type of higher\nlevel phenomenon (described by higher level predicates) or merely a\ntoken phenomenon (an instance of a higher level phenomenon)?\nTheory reduction is the idea that a whole theory (such as classical\ngenetics) can be reduced, or at least that its laws can be reduced.\nFor example, the Mendelian principle of segregation is a law\ndescribing a phenomenon occurring in all sexually reproducing\norganisms, not just a token phenomenon, so this general\nprinciple\u2014covering various lower level realizations\u2014would\nhave to be explained/deduced molecularly.\n\nConsider the example that Schaffner (1993) offers in support of the\npossibility of reduction: the Mendelian concept of\n\u201cdominance\u201d. On his account, given classical genes \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), the property \u201callele \\(a\\) is dominant (relative to\nallele \\(b)\\)\u201d can be expressed in molecular terms as\nfollows. Assume that genotype \\(aa\\) yields phenotype \\(A\\) and\ngenotype \\(bb\\) corresponds to phenotype \\(B\\), while \\(ab\\) yields\n\\(A\\) (because of dominance). We ascertain that gene \\(a\\) consists of\nDNA sequence \\(\\alpha\\) and gene \\(b\\) consists of DNA sequence\n\\(\\beta\\), and that phenotype \\(A\\) is brought about by protein\n\u05d0 while phenotype \\(B\\) is brought about by protein\n\u05d1. This yields the following supposed reduction:\n\nAllele \\(a\\) is dominant (relative to \\(b)\\) iff the\npresence of two copies of DNA sequence \\(\\alpha\\) molecularly produces\nprotein \u05d0 [thus phenotype \\(A\\)], the presence of two\ncopies of sequence \\(\\beta\\) produces protein \u05d1 [phenotype\n\\(B\\)], and the presence of one copy of \\(\\alpha\\) and one copy of\n\\(\\beta\\) produces \u05d0 [phenotype \\(A\\)]. (Schaffner 1993, 442)\n\n\nAlthough Schaffner explicitly claims to have shown that the\npredicate (or concept of) \u201cdominance\u201d can be\nreduced to the language of biochemistry, his evidence actually shows\nhow a single instance of dominance (allele \\(a\\) is\ndominant to allele \\(b)\\) could be brought about by states on the\nmolecular level. But epistemic reduction requires reducing higher\nlevel concepts and, since Mendelian dominance can be brought about by\ndifferent kinds of molecular situations, this higher level\npredicate corresponds to many molecular predicates,\nwhich makes any reductive translation of higher level concepts very\ncomplex. (In addition to translating such concepts into molecular\nterms, theory reduction also requires deducing higher level\ngeneralizations involving such concepts.) A similar issue can apply to\nexplanatory reduction. Biology attempts to explain kinds of\nphenomena occurring in different contexts and organisms: reductive\nexplanations must molecularly explain kinds of phenomena in\naddition to single instances.\n\nSubsequent discussion based on ideas in metaphysics and\n philosophy of mind\n has clarified how one conception of the many-one relation between\nmolecular and higher level kinds can bear on epistemic reduction. In\nhis general treatment of reduction in psychology and social science,\nJerry Fodor (1974, 1975, 1997) distinguishes between token-token\nreduction and type-type reduction (or between token\nphysicalism and type physicalism). Token-token reduction is the idea\nthat each token higher level property or process is\nmetaphysically identical to a token physico-chemical property or\nprocess (the weak sense of ontological reduction that is\nuncontroversial: see\n Section 1).\n The dispute centers on how much more than token-token reduction is\npossible. A substantially stronger idea is that each type of\nhigher level phenomenon corresponds to one type of lower\nlevel phenomenon. Type-type reduction yields a bold version of\nepistemic reductionism where higher level concepts and\nknowledge about higher level phenomena could be immediately reduced to\nmolecular notions. Yet Fodor argues that type-type reduction\n(regarding mental and social kinds in particular) is empirically\nfalse. Consider a simple law or causal principle of a higher-level\nscience relating two kinds, \\(S\\) and \\(T\\), such that \\(\\forall x(Sx\n\\rightarrow Tx)\\), which can be read as \u201call \\(S\\)s are\n\\(T\\)s\u201d or \u201call events of type \\(S\\) bring about events of\ntype \\(T\\)\u201d. (Some laws or principles might be of a more complex\nlogical form.) As a matter of fact, a higher level kind is often\nrealized by several different kinds on the physical level; different\ninstances of the higher level kind are of a different type on the\nmolecular level. If kind \\(S\\) is realized by the lower level kinds\n\\(M_1, M_2 , \\ldots ,M_i\\), the bridge principle (reduction function)\nis of a disjunctive form:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x (Sx \\leftrightarrow (M_1 x \\vee M_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee M_i x))\n\\]\n\n\n\\(T\\) is likewise multiply realized, say by the molecular kinds \\(N_1,\nN_2 , \\ldots ,N_j\\). Fodor\u2019s point is that the lower level basis\nof the higher level law \\(\\forall x(Sx \\rightarrow Tx)\\) consists in\nseveral laws that reduce different higher level instances, such\nas:\n\n\\[ \n\\forall x(M_1 x \\rightarrow N_3 x), \\forall x(M_2 x \\rightarrow N_1\nx), \\forall x(( M_3 x \\vee M_4 x) \\rightarrow N_2 x),\\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nThus, while on the higher level there is one unified law\n\\(\\forall x (Sx \\rightarrow Tx)\\),\nits translation into molecular terms is a disjunctive\nstatement:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x ((M_1 x \\vee M_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee M_i x) \\rightarrow (N_1\nx \\vee N_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee N_j x))\n\\]\n\n\nThis disjunctive statement has the appearance of being a gerrymandered\ncombination rather than a genuine law. Therefore, the higher level law\ncannot be reduced to a unified lower level law. Token-token\nreduction obtains, but since the natural kinds (to which laws apply)\nof the higher level science cross-cut the kinds of the lower level\nscience, type-type reduction fails and the law-based explanation from\nthe higher level cannot be replaced by a unified law-based explanation\non the lower level. Steven Kimbrough (1978) argues that this situation\nalso applies to the relation between classical and molecular genetics:\nontological (token-token) reduction is possible, but not epistemic\n(type-type)\n reduction.[11]\n\nThe multiple realizability of higher level kinds is typically viewed\nas an obstacle to reduction (e.g., Kincaid 1997), and many have\ninterpreted the many-one relation between molecular and higher level\nphenomena in a similar way. Rosenberg\u2019s earlier discussions that\ncriticized theory reduction in light of multiple realization (1978,\n1985, 1994) used the notion of\n supervenience,\n which is another way to spell out an idea of ontological without\nepistemic reduction\n (non-reductive physicalism).[12]\n Higher level facts supervene on physical facts if any difference\nbetween two higher level situations implies a difference in the\nphysical basis. Yet this is consistent with two distinct physical\nsituations corresponding to the same higher level state (many-one).\nSince biological properties such as fitness supervene on physical\nproperties, fitness can be nothing more than a combination of physical\nproperties, even though no such property complex is necessary for\nhaving a particular fitness value. Higher level theories abstract away\nfrom irrelevant variation in lower level features and thereby arrive\nat generalizations that are explanatory precisely because they do not\ninclude features irrelevant to explaining the phenomenon (Putnam 1975,\nStrevens 2008). From this perspective, theory reduction of classical\nto\n molecular genetics\n is impossible as the many\u2013many relations between classical and\nmolecular kinds make any reductive account radically disjunctive. At\nthe same time, the notion of supervenience implies that classical and\nmolecular genetics are not incommensurable, and that molecular\ngenetics can shed light on the exceptions of classical genetics.\n\nA related critique of reductionism in genetics is due to Philip\nKitcher (1984). It is not that the complexities of any reduction due\nto many-one relations between molecular and higher level kinds exceed\nour cognitive capacities. Rather, the reductive, molecular\naccount does not adequately explain because it does not involve the\nnatural kinds that underlie the appropriate causal relations.\nPrinciples of classical genetics (e.g., segregation) are explained by\ncellular processes (e.g., the behavior of chromosomes in meiosis)\nbecause the higher level kinds picked out by cytology are causally\nrelevant. Rephrasing these cellular processes in molecular terms leads\nto an account that mentions various disjunctive combinations of\nmolecular kinds, while failing to exhibit the unified kinds that are\nthe causes of the cellular process. A key aspect of Kitcher\u2019s\nargument is that an epistemic account of reduction fails for\nontological reasons: it does not capture the natural kind structure of\nchromosomal phenomena studied by classical genetics.\n\nSchaffner\u2019s reply to the multiple realization objection (1993,\n463\u20136) emphasizes that the same DNA sequence can be present in\nmany individuals, which means that molecular biology studies more than\ntoken phenomena; molecular generalizations apply to\nrestricted types. This is true but fails to address the core\nissue. Critics of reductionism do not argue that each higher level\ntype corresponds to several lower level tokens (which is\ntrivially true) or that molecular biology can study token phenomena\nonly. Rather, the point is that a higher level type corresponds to\nseveral lower level types, and for each of these lower level\nkinds a distinct molecular account obtains. Thus, a unified (as\nopposed to disjunctive) causal explanation of the higher level\nphenomenon appears impossible.\n\nWaters (1990) challenges the commitment to unification that implies\nthere is explanatory loss in appealing to the multiply realized\n\u201cgory details\u201d of molecular biology. In some cases,\ndisjunctive explanations at a lower level seem to explain better than\nunified explanations at higher levels. Elliott Sober (1999) extends\nthis line of argument: an explanation in terms of higher level kinds\ncan be more unified or general by encompassing heterogeneous lower\nlevel kinds, but this same heterogeneity exhibits important\ndifferences in scientifically interesting properties. Only the lower\nlevel science can account for such differences and therefore, in this\nsense, offers a deeper explanation than the higher level science.\nExplanations are not better or worse along a one-dimensional scale.\nThere are several epistemic virtues an explanation can possess, such\nas generality, depth, or specificity. Sometimes a lower level\nexplanation is better relative to one epistemic virtue, while a higher\nlevel explanation is preferable relative to another, such as\nunification. And unification itself can be explicated differently in\nterms of functional or structural features of biological systems (see,\ne.g., Weiskopf\n 2011).[13]\n\nMany contemporary accounts of explanatory reduction focus on\n mechanisms\n and the study of\n model organisms.\n One reply to the multiple realization objection from this perspective\nargues explicitly for token-token reduction, discussing how the causal\ndescription of a token mechanism explains (Delehanty 2005). Weber\n(2005) acknowledges that higher level features are multiply realizable\nbut notes that this does not hamper the reducibility of token systems\nor individual organisms: \u201cthe fact that chemotactic behavior is\nmultiply realizable does not affect the reductionistic explanation of\nthis organism\u2019s behavioral biology\u201d (48).\nHowever, this stratagem ignores the key point of contention because\ntoken-token reduction is uncontroversial. The focus on token phenomena\nor individual organisms fails to address an important epistemological\nfeature of scientific knowledge: explanations often cover\ntypes of phenomena. In many biological contexts, such as\n developmental biology,\n the intellectual aim is to explain phenomena instantiated in\nmany organisms and the use of model organisms is predicated on this\n aim.[14]\n Any version of epistemic reductionism has to address this feature of\nscientific explanation to be adequate. Explaining development\u2014as\nunderstood by many developmental biologists\u2014means to have an\naccount of ontogeny exhibited by individual organisms belonging to a\nlarger group (e.g., understanding the developmental principles that\ngovern vertebrate or amphibian development). As the\nsame morphological structure may develop in different species by means\nof different processes and based on the action of different genes,\nmultiple realization obtains and is relevant for such explanations\n(Laubichler and Wagner 2001).\n\nMoreover, even if the aim is to explain a feature of a single\norganism, it does not follow that an explanation should appeal\nexclusively to factors on the lowest level. An explanation should only\ninclude factors that are explanatorily relevant; an irrelevant factor\nis one whose omission from (or modification in) the explanation does\nnot prevent the explanandum from following (Strevens 2008).\nThis also holds for mechanistic explanation, which should cite those\nfeatures as components of a mechanism whose modification would make a\ncausal difference to the explanandum phenomenon (Craver\n2007). For instance, chromosomes are relevant parts of the mechanisms\n(\u201cworking entities\u201d) needed to explain Mendelian patterns\nof inheritance (Darden 2005), but this particular explanation will\napply regardless of the lower level, molecular composition of the\nchromosomes (e.g., whether or not the various genes have similar or\nvery different DNA sequences).\n\nIn the context of developmental biology, even during the development\nof a single organism, a structure may be present across time and have\na stable developmental-functional role, but its underlying molecular\nand cellular basis may change (Brigandt 2006, Kirschner 2005).\nEntities above the molecular level can be more robust so that when\nsome molecular processes change or break down these higher level\nentities are not modified or removed. Knocking out a gene need not\nhave any impact on ontogeny due to genetic redundancy, while\neliminating a particular cell or group of cells may dramatically\ninterfere with normal development (Brigandt 2013a, 2015, Mitchell\n2009). A higher level causal connection can be more salient in that\nthe regular operation of the mechanism strongly depends on the\npresence of this kind of causal relation. Such a higher level causal\nrelation is realized by molecular entities and their interactions\n(i.e., supervenience obtains), but if relevant higher level processes\nare less sensitive to disturbance or intervention than certain\nmolecular causes, the more powerful mechanistic explanation can be the\none that appeals to more robust, higher level causal connections. This\nis one reason why some biological sciences preferentially invoke\nhigher level entities and processes in the face of multiple\nrealization, explaining in terms of higher level natural kinds and\ncauses.\n\nIn summary, the level(s) of organization a successful explanation\naddresses often depends on the particular explanandum. If the\naim is to explain a type of phenomenon, multiple realization issues\n(many-one relations) are likely pertinent. In the explanation of a\ntoken phenomenon, the explanation should include lower level factors\nonly to the extent that they are explanatorily relevant for that\nparticular explanandum.\n4.3 Representation, Temporality, and Intrinsicality\n\nSarkar\u2019s (1998) account of explanatory reduction draws attention\nto the requirement of representation: natural phenomena must be\nsymbolized, embodied, pictured, or designated through media such as\nequations, scale miniatures, or abstract diagrams (Abrahamsen et al.\n2018, Bechtel et al. 2018, Potochnik 2017, Sheredos and Bechtel 2020).\nEvery reductive explanation in science involves representations of the\nsystems or features to be related by reduction. (Note that this is not\nthe question of how theory structure is represented; see, e.g.,\nSchaffner 1996.) Almost all of the discussion surrounding one-many\n (Section 4.1)\n and many-one problems\n (Section 4.2)\n for theory and explanatory reduction assume or presume particular\nrepresentations that directly impact the arguments offered (e.g., they\ninvolve approximations of different kinds). Sarkar distinguishes three\nrepresentational criteria for a reductive explanation: (i)\nfundamentalism: the explanation of the phenomenon relies entirely on\nfeatures that pertain to a more fundamental realm; (ii) abstract\nhierarchy: the system is represented as a hierarchy, where the lower\nlevels are regarded as more fundamental; and, (iii) spatial hierarchy:\nthe abstract hierarchy is rendered physical by the requirement that\nthe entities on the lower level are (spatial) parts of the entities at\nhigher levels (see\n Section 3.2).\n Whether or not there are one-many or many-one relations between\ndifferent hierarchical levels turns on the nature of the hierarchy\ninvoked and how it is characterized. The decomposition of a system is\nnot a univocal enterprise and, depending on the principles utilized,\ncan generate both competing and complementary sets of part\nrepresentations from the same system (Craver 2009, Kauffman 1971,\nWimsatt 1974, Winther 2011). Certain governing principles are often\nvisible, such as functional versus structural decompositions (Bechtel\nand Richardson 1993, Winther 2006). Therefore, prior to determinations\nof whether reductive explanations succeed or fail, questions of\nrepresentational choice and adequacy need to be addressed\nexplicitly.\n\nThese representational issues are not idle with respect to differing\nexplanations, both past and present, because the same line of argument\nabout the non-independence of organismal parts constituted reasons for\ntreating the organism from a non-reductionist standpoint (Aristotle,\nParts of Animals II.3, Owen, Hunterian Lectures [1837] in\nSloan 1992, 213\u20134). Individuation of parts and their explanatory\nrelationship to wholes is critically dependent on the principles\nutilized in representing them (Love 2012). Wimsatt (1974, 1986, 1997,\n2007) has claimed that reduction and emergence are compatible within\nthe context of explaining organizational complexity in living systems,\ngoing so far as to argue that reductionist methodology can identify\nemergence when specific conditions of aggregativity are delineated.\nDifferent failures of aggregativity result when different conditions\nare not met, which yields a subtle taxonomy of compositional\nrelations, as well as highlighting that different decompositions\nproduce distinct fulfillments and/or violations of those conditions\nthat can be methodologically exploited by scientists for the purpose\nof causal discovery.\n\nIn addition to individuation, two other issues related to\nrepresentation are germane: temporality and intrinsicality\n(H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011). In most discussions of epistemic\nreduction, both theoretical and explanatory, no explicit distinction\nhas been drawn between constitutional or spatial relations\n(arrangements) and causal or temporal relations (dynamics; but see\nMitchell 2009, 2012). One source of the focus on spatial relations is\nthe objection to reductionism from structural organization (Polanyi\n1968, cf. Delehanty 2005, Frost-Arnold 2004, Schaffner 1993, ch. 9.2),\nwhich is related to the \u201ccontext\u201d objection\n (Section 4.1).\n Moreover, physical science models that serve as templates for\nthinking about reduction emphasize spatial composition questions\nrather than causal relations (Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011). As\nSchaffner has remarked: \u201cBiological theories are usually given\nin the form of a series of temporal (and frequently causal) models. In\nphysics, time is usually eliminated by making it implicit in\ndifferential equations, whereas in biology a temporal process \u2026\nis the rule\u201d (1993, 83\u20134, cf. Kellert 1993, 93). Nagel\npresciently recognized differences between spatial and temporal\norganization in his discussion of teleological explanation (in part\nbecause he was reading the literature on explaining ontogeny by\ntheoretical biologists; see\n Section 2).\n\nThe contrast between structure and function is evidently a contrast\nbetween the spatial organization of anatomically\ndistinguishable parts of an organ and the temporal (or\nspatiotemporal) organization of changes in those parts. What is\ninvestigated under each term of the contrasting pair is a mode of\norganization or a type of order. In the one case the organization is\nprimarily if not exclusively a spatial one, and the object of the\ninvestigation is to ascertain the spatial distribution of organic\nparts and the modes of their linkage. In the other case the\norganization has a temporal dimension, and the aim of the inquiry is\nto discover sequential and simultaneous orders of change in the\nspatially ordered and linked parts of organic bodies. (Nagel 1961,\n426)\n\n\nKitcher also glimpsed the potential significance of temporality for\nreductive explanation in the context of embryology: \u201cBecause\ndevelopmental processes are complex and because changes in the timing\nof embryological events may produce a cascade of effects at several\ndifferent levels, one sometimes uses descriptions at higher levels to\nexplain what goes on [later] at a more fundamental level\u201d (1984,\n371).\n\nA very different distinction utilizing time, which is agreed upon by\ndiverse participants, distinguishes between the historical succession\nof theories via reduction (\u201cdiachronic reduction\u201d) and\ncurrent attempts to relate parts to wholes, such as in explanatory\nreduction or interlevel theory reduction (\u201csynchronic\nreduction\u201d; see\n Section 3.1).\n\nSynchronic reduction is mereological explanation, in which the\nbehavior of more composite items described in reduced theories is\nexplained by derivation from the behavior of their components by the\nreducing theory. Thus, reduction is a form of explanation. Diachronic\nreduction usually involves the succession of more general theories\nwhich reduce less general ones, by showing them to be special cases\nwhich neglect some variables, fail to measure coefficients, or set\nparameters at restricted values. As the history of science proceeds\nfrom the less general theory to the more general, the mechanism of\nprogress is the reduction of theories. (Rosenberg 2006, 28)\n\n\nThe first distinction to note is that between synchronic and\ndiachronic conceptions of reductionism. The term reduction is\noften used to refer to the relation between a theory and its\nhistorical successor. \u2026 This is \u2026 what I mean by\ndiachronic reductionism. My concern, on the other hand, is solely with\nsynchronic reductionism, that is to say, with the relations between\ncoexisting theories addressed to different levels of organization.\n(Dupr\u00e9 1993, 94\u20135)\n\n\nWhat this distinction misses is the possibility of diachronic aspects\nof part-whole or interlevel relations. Scientific explanations\ncommonly invoke dynamic (causal) processes involving entities on\nseveral levels of organization (Craver and Bechtel 2007). This is one\nof the core reasons why development is a persisting biological topic\nfor reductionism. During ontogeny there are causal interactions over\ntime among parts and activities (both homogeneous and heterogeneous)\nto bring about new parts and activities (both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous), eventually generating an integrated adult (whole)\norganism.\n\nTemporality can be added as a fourth criterion on representations for\nreductive explanations: (iv) temporal hierarchy: for an abstract\nhierarchy embedded in an explanation, the entities and their behaviors\non the lower level are temporally prior to the entities and their\nbehaviors at the higher levels (H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011).\nAlthough temporal or process hierarchies have not received the same\nattention as spatial hierarchies (such as in Wimsatt\u2019s\naggregativity criteria), their importance is seen in explanations that\ninvoke higher level features (e.g., tissue interactions during\nontogeny) at an earlier time to causally explain lower level features\nat a later time (e.g., gene expression patterns). For example, a study\nof the developmental origin of aortic arch asymmetry involves a\nmixture of reductionist and non-reductionist representations according\nto the criterion of temporality (Yashiro et al. 2007; see also Love\n2017). The explanation depicts several events in a sequential process.\nFirst, fundamental level properties (gene expression) change\nnon-fundamental level properties (arterial structure), which alters\nblood flow dynamics (thereby fulfilling the temporality condition).\nThese new dynamics induce a subsequent change in gene expression\n(thereby violating the temporality condition). This altered gene\nexpression then produces the non-fundamental property of interest,\naortic arch asymmetry (thereby fulfilling the temporality condition).\nThus, depending on how time is represented and which temporal\npartitions are utilized, an explanation may be reductive,\nnon-reductive, or both. This is a good example of how ontological and\nepistemic reduction can yield strikingly different answers. A\nbiologist using a higher level feature at an earlier time to explain a\nlower level feature at a later time (a non-reductionist explanation by\nthe criterion of temporality) is not denying that this higher level\nfeature is composed of lower level features (e.g., cells and\nmolecules), nor the possibility that the higher level feature was\ncaused by a different set of lower level features at some more distal\npoint in time.\n\nAnother example is found in protein folding within molecular biology\n(H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011). Functional proteins are folded\nstructures composed of amino acid components linked together into a\nlinear chain. If we ask whether the folded protein is mereologically\ncomposed of its amino acid parts given current representations in\nmolecular biology, then the affirmative answer seems to favor\nexplanatory reduction with respect to the spatial hierarchy. But if we\nask whether the linear amino acid chain folds into a functional\nprotein (a causal process with a temporal dimension) purely as a\nconsequence of its linked amino acid parts, then the answer is less\nclear. Empirical studies have discerned a necessary role for other\nfolded proteins to assist in the proper folding of newly\ngenerated linear amino acid chains (Frydman 2001). That the linked\namino acid components alone are insufficient causally, even if they\nare sufficient constitutionally, allows for a more explicit\nappreciation of the significance of temporality and dynamics (Mitchell\n2009), especially because the relations of interest concern only\nmolecular biological phenomena (as opposed to higher levels of\norganization, such as cells or anatomy).\n\nA final representational feature is intrinsicality, whereby what is\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d are explicitly or\nimplicitly distinguished in reductive explanations. Wimsatt (1980)\ndrew attention to the fact that every investigation must divide a\nsystem from its environment and that methodological reductionism\nfavors attributions of causal responsibility to internal parts of a\nsystem rather than those deemed external (see also Wilson 2004). In\nthe protein folding case, it appears that the failure of temporally\nindexed explanatory reduction involves the causal powers of something\nextrinsic to (an instance of) the process under scrutiny\n(i.e., the folding of a single amino acid chain). The presumption of\natemporal, compositional relationships has encouraged a neglect of\nthis distinction because nested part-whole relations are predicated on\na prior individuation of a system from its environment (H\u00fcttemann\nand Love 2011). Kaiser\u2019s (2015) idea that a reductive\nexplanation must (among other things) represent each lower-level part\nof the explanation \u201cin isolation\u201d from other parts is one\nexplicit attempt to engage representational questions related to\nintrinsicality\n (Section 3.2).\n Overall, this line of thought relates to the context-dependency\nobjection\n (Section 4.1),\n but emphasizes the importance of functional dependency relations\nuncovered by attending to temporality in addition to structural\norganization.\n\nRecognizing temporal aspects of reductive explanations found in\nbiology alongside other representational issues like intrinsicality,\nboth of which are not captured by a focus on mereology alone,\nstrengthens the argument in favor of talking about different\nkinds of reductionism rather a unified account of reduction\nor overarching dichotomies of \u201creductionism\u201d versus\n\u201canti-reductionism\u201d (or \u201cholism\u201d). Once we\nincorporate distinctions about different types of reduction\n(ontological, epistemic, and methodological), the different\ninterpretations of these types (e.g., theoretical versus explanatory\nepistemic reductions), the different representational features\ninvolved (spatial, temporal, etc.), and the distinct biological topics\nto which philosophers have applied them (e.g., development or\nfunctional anatomy), then any single conception of reduction appears\ninadequate to do justice to the diversity of phenomena and reasoning\npractices in the life sciences. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of\nbiological subdisciplines only reinforce this argument and suggest to\nsome that we should move beyond reductionism entirely.\n5. \u201cAlternatives\u201d to Reductionism: Moving Beyond Dichotomies\n\nMuch of the past discussion about reduction presupposes a unitary view\nof the scientific enterprise that involves a close relation between\nnatural kinds, laws, counterfactual dependence, explanation, and\nconfirmation (Godfrey-Smith 2008). One of the ubiquitous features of\nmodern biology that is prima facie incompatible with many\nmethodological and epistemological reductionist theses is the\nproliferation and flourishing of diverse biological subdisciplines,\nmolecular and otherwise. Despite the purported \u201chegemony of\nmolecular biology\u201d (Kitcher 1999a), biological subdisciplines\nfocused on higher levels of organization have not disappeared:\n\u201cSpecial sciences: still autonomous after all these years\u201d\n(Fodor 1997). For some time this feature of biological research, along\nwith many of the problems associated with theoretical reduction\n(especially its inapplicability to scientific practice, but also the\ndifficulties in identifying clear-cut and distinct\n\u201clevels\u201d to relate reductively; Brooks 2014, 2021, Brooks\net al. 2021, McGill and Potochnik 2012, Potochnik 2021), has prompted\nphilosophers to reject \u201creduction\u201d as the appropriate (or\nonly) relation among concepts and explanations from different\n domains.[15]\n Instead, relations of coordination driven by a commitment to\nunifying, integrating, or synthesizing aspects of scientific knowledge\nhave been offered (Bechtel and Hamilton 2007, Brigandt 2013b, Love\n2017, Potochnik 2011).\n\nLindley Darden and Nancy Maull were at the forefront of this\ndiscussion with the concept of an\n inter-field theory\n (Darden and Maull 1977, Maull 1977). For example, the advent of the\nchromosome theory of inheritance in the 1910s bridged the previously\nunrelated fields of Mendelian genetics (which studied phenotypic\npatterns of inheritance across generations) and cytology (which dealt\nwith the material contents of cells). This interfield theory effected\na kind of unification, but Mendelian genetics and cytology were not\nreduced to each other, nor did the interfield theory reduce both\nfields. More recent work has articulated interfield relations without\nrelying on the notion of a theory (Ankeny and Leonelli 2016, Bechtel\n1986, Burian 1993, Grantham 2004a, 2004b, Leonelli 2013, Mitchell\n2002). This parallels the trend in models of explanatory reduction of\nmoving away from theories as the only epistemic units of interest\n (Section 3.2),\n but the emphasis is on such relations as coordination, integration,\nsynthesis, or reciprocal interaction (Bechtel 2013, Green 2013,\nHochstein 2016, Love 2017, Nathan 2017, Plutynski 2013). A rationale\nfor these complex relations emerges from the demand for\nmultidisciplinary research (O\u2019Rourke et al. 2016); the\nexplanatory task involves coordinating diverse epistemic resources\n(Ankeny and Leonelli 2016), which amounts to an implicit rejection of\nthe \u201cfundamentality\u201d of one particular discipline\nproducing the most empirically adequate explanations.\n\nIn this context, Alan Love (2008a, 2014) uses the notion of a problem\nagenda to argue that some scientific problems not only motivate\ninterdisciplinary research but also provide structure for the\nrequisite intellectual coordination (see also Brigandt 2010, 2012,\nBrigandt and Love 2012, Villegas et al. 2023). Problem agendas consist\nof numerous component questions that stand in systematic relations and\nare tied to associated standards of explanatory adequacy. These\nstandards imply what epistemic resources and different disciplines are\nneeded to address the problem. The relations among component questions\nof the problem agenda (i.e., its internal structure) foreshadow how\nvarious contributions can be coordinated to generate an adequate\nexplanatory framework. Building on this perspective, Ingo Brigandt\n(2010) suggests that there is no single, linear hierarchy among\nscientific fields (e.g., Oppenheim and Putnam 1958), but that the\nrelationships among theories and disciplinary approaches are\ndetermined by and vary with the scientific problem being addressed.\nThese philosophical accounts align with general research on\ninterdisciplinarity, which has identified the presence and\narticulation of a complex question as a prerequisite (Repko 2008,\nSzostak 2002, 2009). Thus, instead of unification being a regulative\nideal with biologists seeking as much unity as possible in their\nexplanations of the complex natural world (e.g., Kitcher 1999b), an\nerotetic perspective suggests that particular problems determine the\nneed for and degree of any integration (Brigandt 2010). William\nBechtel\u2019s (1993, 2006) studies of cell biology document how the\nformation of new subdisciplines generates both integration among\napproaches and some disintegration due to new specializations.\nBechtel\u2019s attention to the institutional underpinnings of\nbiology also meshes with sociological analyses of disciplinary\norganization (Gerson 1998, 2013).\n\nRecently, accounts of explanation revolving around\n \u201cmechanisms\u201d\n have been widely discussed (e.g., Baetu 2015, Bechtel 2006, 2008,\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2005, Craver 2006, 2007, Darden 2006, Glennan\n1996, 2017, Machamer et al. 2000). Many philosophers view experimental\nbiology as fundamentally concerned with the discovery of mechanisms\n(Craver and Darden 2013, Darden and Craver 2002, Tabery 2004), where\nmechanisms are understood as akin (though not equivalent) to machines\nwith interconnected, organized parts operating to produce regular or\nexpected outcomes. Conceiving of biological explanation in terms of\nmechanisms provides a philosophical framework that closely tracks\nbiological practice and does not rely on the notion of a theory.\nBesides providing new models for explanatory reduction\n (Section 3.2),\n mechanisms also have been used to demonstrate integration among\ndifferent fields. Darden (2005) argues that both reduction and\nreplacement fail to capture the relations between classical and\n molecular genetics.\n Both fields deal with different mechanisms that occur at different\nperiods of the cell cycle and involve different working entities:\nclassical genetics focuses on meiosis and involves chromosomal\nbehavior; molecular genetics focuses on gene expression and involves\nvarious molecular entities such as nucleotide sequences. Relations\nbetween the two fields are manifested as differential attention to\ndistinct aspects of a larger, temporally extended mechanism.\n\nThe mechanisms framework has proved particularly fruitful in capturing\nexplanations that appeal to entities at several levels of organization\n(Darden 2016, Tabery 2014). An instructive example is Carl\nCraver\u2019s (2005, 2007) discussion of multilevel and multifield\nexplanation in the context of neuroscientific studies of learning.\nWhile the cellular-molecular process of long-term potentiation is\ncritical for memory formation, it is not merely a molecular\ncounterpart of memory. Long-term potentiation is a lower-level\ncomponent of an overall, multilevel mechanism. Reductionist accounts\nhave neglected the phenomenon of disciplinary integration at the same\nlevel of structural organization and invested too heavily in finished\nreductive explanations, ignoring the dynamic changes in research\nstrategy that precede them (Craver 2005). In addition to searching for\nmolecular correlates of higher-level phenomena\n(\u201cdownward-looking\u201d episodes), there also have been\nattempts to understand the role of molecular mechanisms in complex\nhigher-level phenomena (\u201cupward-looking\u201d periods of\nresearch). Sometimes progress has been achieved independently of or by\nabandoning reduction as an explanatory goal. This need to change\nstrategies depending on the research context is ubiquitous in\nmechanistic research (Bechtel 2010), which serves as another reminder\nfor philosophers to attend to actual scientific practice. Even though\na mechanism is temporally extended, philosophical analyses of\nmechanisms may not capture all aspects of temporality (see\n Section 4.3).\n While discussions have focused on the representation of time relative\nto a mechanism (e.g., Bechtel 2006, Machamer et al. 2000), not all\naspects of the dynamics of biological systems are well represented as\nmechanisms involving entities and activities. Some might be better\nmodeled using equations (Bechtel 2012, Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010,\n2011, Brigandt 2015, Weber 2008), and in other cases time might be\nrepresented independently of the mechanisms being\n investigated.[16]\n\nComplexity also has been a source for articulating non-reductionist\nepistemological accounts of biological reasoning (Wimsatt 1974, Hooker\n2011). Sandra Mitchell (2003, 2009) has argued that different forms of\nbiological complexity block standard reductionist perspectives.\nMultiple (idealized) causal models must be integrated from different\ndisciplinary approaches to adequately represent this complexity,\nincluding our uncertainty in predicting its behavior, which has\nimplications for any social policy derived from these models (see also\nMitchell 2008, 2020, Mitchell and Gronenborn 2017). She specifically\ndraws attention to the phenomenon of self-organization, which refers\nto how system behaviors or patterns emerge from non-specific\ninteractions among lower-level components (Camazine et al. 2001,\nKauffman 1993), such as the collective behavior of social insects.\n(Self-organizing phenomena are also relevant to reductionism in\nphysical science; see, e.g., Goldenfeld and Kadanoff 1999, Whitesides\nand Ismagilov 1999.) Although decomposing a system into parts is\nimportant for claims about self-organization, there is no localization\nof causal responsibility to individual components (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993, ch. 9). Instead, the system behavior is a function of\ngeneric patterns of component interaction, which foregrounds how\ncomplexity emerges from dynamics rather than constitution (see\n Section 4.3).\n For example, gene networks and human social networks may exhibit\nisomorphic patterns of self-organization due to their interactive\nstructure, which is unrelated to whether genes or humans are the\ncomponents. Thus, self-organizing phenomena occupy an odd place in the\nreductionism discussion because even though components are used to\nexplain the behavior of the system, it is the nature of their\ninteractions (not their specific characteristics) that generate\npatterns of behavior. These patterns are often referred to as\n emergent properties\n of the system (see also Bishop et al. 2022, Grantham 2007, Mitchell\n2012).\n\nThe philosophical import of biological complexity is underscored by\nrecent trends in systems biology (Boogerd et al. 2007, Green 2015,\n2017, Green et al. 2015, Mazzocchi 2012, Noble 2006, O\u2019Malley\nand Soyer 2012). In addition to the mathematical modeling of\nsystem-wide behavior, systems biology has a wealth of data about\nvarious molecular components of cells stemming from functional\ngenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods.\nDownward looking strategies in systems biology attempt to analyze\nsystemic dynamics into different components, whereas upward looking\nstrategies aim to synthesize how the quantitative interactions among\nindividual molecules result in higher-level behavior (Green et al.\n2018, Krohs and Callebaut 2007). Despite the focus on molecular\ncomponents and their interactions, non-reductionist themes tied to\ncomplexity are motivated by non-linear interactions and feedback loops\nthat generate emergent behaviors, distributed control, and system\nrobustness (Brigandt 2015, Bruggeman et al. 2002, Westerhoff and Kell\n2007).\n\nAnother distinct strand of discussion about reductionism is found in\ncritical analyses of methodology and explanation from the perspective\nof\n feminist philosophy of science\n and studies of the\n social aspects of science\n (e.g., Fehr 2004, Longino 1990, 1996).\n Feminist philosophy of biology\n has related reductionism and pluralism to other philosophical,\nscientific, and social issues. One core idea in these discussions is\nthat forms of reductionism are involved in mutually reinforcing\nfeedback loops with other factors, such as socioeconomic status or\nexpectations about gender (Keller and Longino 1996, Levins and\nLewontin 1985). Thus, reductionism, whether ontological, epistemic, or\nmethodological, can be understood as the manifestation of more diverse\ncommitments (e.g., political ideology) than much of the philosophy of\nbiology literature on reductionism would suggest\u2014the history of\nbiology points in this direction as well (see, e.g., Allchin 2008).\nThis line of criticism also suggests that the interrelations between\nreductionism in biology and the social sciences should be treated more\nexplicitly. Elisabeth Lloyd (2002) has argued that medical research\nshould not be restricted simply to molecular biological investigation\nbecause higher levels of social organization that are culturally\nsanctioned have unrecognized causal effects on health. As the social\nsciences and medicine attempt to apply different life science\nreasoning strategies, similar philosophical issues predictably\ntransfer, but with the potential for more socially damaging\nconsequences (see, e.g., Richardson 2013, 2021).\n\nA shared feature of many alternatives to reductionism is an emphasis\non pluralist dimensions of epistemology in biology that situate\nmethodological or explanatory reduction as only one among many\ncomponents (Dupr\u00e9 1993, Kellert et al. 2006, Longino 2000,\n2002, 2013, Mitchell 2003, Muszynski and Malaterre 2021,\nO\u2019Malley 2013). In different ways, these positions stress how\nthe scientific investigation of biological phenomena demands diverse\nepistemic tools without a requirement to tie it all together into\nfundamental physics, macromolecular chemistry, or even\n molecular biology.\n Thus, ontological reduction becomes more or less unhinged from\nepistemological reduction because there is no need to demonstrate how\neach and every domain of scientific inquiry is anchored in physical\nstuff. Scientists are epistemologically profligate, even if they are\nlargely metaphysically frugal (see Dupr\u00e9 1993 and van Fraassen\n2002 for differing perspectives on science and metaphysics). The\nplurality of biological research motivates a philosophical\n pluralism\n about biology, both in terms of the many meanings available for\ndifferent methodological and epistemological types of reduction, and\nthe need to have multiple dimensions of reductionism in order to\nsecure empirical adequacy with respect to modeling biological\nphenomena (Grantham 1999, Kellert et al. 2006, Looren de Jong 2006,\nMorange 2006, Sullivan 2009, van der Steen 1999, Wylie 1999).\n\nIt is clear that these different kinds of \u201calternatives\u201d\nto reductionism successfully capture a number of features left\nuntreated or ignored by theory reduction. However, it is an open\nquestion whether they supplant discussions of reduction or bear some\ncomplex relation to them (Craver 2005). Reasons in favor of the latter\nposition include the continued use of \u201creductionist\u201d\nlanguage (for and against) in biological research, as well as the fact\nthat a near universal reason for rejecting reduction and choosing an\nalternative is the problematic nature of theory reduction,\nwhich only represents a small space of the philosophical\npossibilities. One interpretation of some alternatives to reduction is\nthat they are responding to the complexity of reduction that has\nbecome more apparent over the past two decades (e.g., seeing\nexplanations as inherently interlevel), and the fact that\nbiologists\u2019 use of the term \u201creductionism\u201d refers to\ndifferent specific commitments in different cases and research\ncontexts. Thus, for example, mechanisms approaches are another way to\ntreat the heterogeneity of explanation (including reductive and\nnon-reductive aspects), which was largely ignored in the literature on\ntheory reduction, which assumed that a few select examples from\nbiological research were representative. This heterogeneity is a\npervasive feature of the history of biology; philosophical\nalternatives to reduction are responding in part to long-standing\ncontroversies among life science investigators about the legitimacy of\nreductionist research strategies and modes of explanation (see\n Section 2).\n The compatibility or conflict among these various alternatives and\ndifferent accounts of explanation in biology is still being probed\n(e.g., Bechtel 2006, 40\u201344), but the traditional philosophical\nproject of articulating a single notion of reduction to capture most\nessential aspects of theory structure and explanation across biology\nis unlikely to succeed.\n6. Future Prospects\n\nArguably, discussions of reductionism in biology are becoming more\nrather than less philosophically interesting. This is a consequence of\nrecognizing the diverse conceptual landscape carved out over past\ndecades, one that is much larger than that conceived of when only\nNagelian theory reduction was in view. Biological science is now more\nspecialized than ever, but disciplinary proliferation brings with it\nissues relevant to any analysis of reduction: using the same terms\ndifferently, disparate methodologies, distinct explanatory norms, and\ndivergent interests in \u201clevels\u201d of biological organization\n(Brooks 2021, Potochnik 2021). It also includes an acknowledgment that\ncertain enduring biological topics like development still engender\ndifficult questions about reductionism and new fields of inquiry\nreinvigorate these discussions (e.g., synthetic biology\u2019s appeal\nto molecular components as Lego-like building blocks in the\n Registry of Standard Biological Parts).\n Philosophers need to recognize that a criterion of adequacy on\naccounts of reductionism in biology involves interpreting why\nscientists make pronouncements about the failure of reductionism in\ndifferent areas of life science (see, e.g., De Backer et al.\n 2010).[17]\n\nThere also is increasing contact between neuroscience and\npsychologically oriented investigations (Barwich 2020, Bechtel 2008,\nBoogerd et al. 2002, Craver 2007, Sullivan 2016, 2017, Tabb 2019). A\npotential prospect related to the contact between molecular\nneurobiology and psychology is the injection of epistemic\nconsiderations into philosophy of mind discussions (Godfrey-Smith\n2008). More attention to issues of representation, decomposition, and\ntemporality could alter the nature of these debates. At the same time,\na more explicit evaluation of metaphysical components\nimported from philosophy of mind into philosophy of biology is\nwarranted. Discussions of the status of downward causation and\nrealization in biological systems are relevant for a better\nunderstanding of the intersection between epistemological and\nmetaphysical components of reduction (Craver and Bechtel 2007, Green\n2021, Love 2012, Robinson 2005, Wilson and Craver 2007, Woodward\n2021). For example, an interest in the context sensitivity of\nrealization in philosophy of mind (Wilson 2004, ch. 6) invokes issues\npertaining to the context objection, individuation, temporality\n(especially causation versus constitution), and intrinsicality. These\nanalyses can then be imported into biological contexts to argue for or\nagainst particular aspects of reductionism (see, e.g., Wilson\n2005).\n\nMore work is needed in how to relate different kinds of hierarchies to\nquestions of reductionism. Biological hierarchies are diverse (Grene\n1987, Korn 2002, 2005) and subject to evolutionary change (Baedke\n2021, DiFrisco, 2021, T\u00ebmkin 2021), and some areas of biological\nresearch, such as paleontology and systematics (Valentine and May\n1996; see also Grantham 1999, 2004a, 2004b, 2007), have been ignored\nwhen reductionism comes into view. Paying attention to temporality\nencourages the exploration of functional or control hierarchies in\nmore detail (Love 2021, Salthe 1985, 1993, Wimsatt 2002). The\nlimitations of representing biological systems in terms of hierarchies\nshould be explored in more depth as well (Bechtel 2022, Brooks 2014,\nO\u2019Malley et al. 2014, Potochnik 2021, Potochnik and McGill\n2012).\n\nAll of these possibilities suggest more scrutiny of disciplinary\nheterogeneity in biological investigation relevant to reductionism.\nAlthough ecology has received some treatment (Dupr\u00e9 1993, ch.\n5, Mikkelson 2004), issues of decomposition and representation have\nnot yet received wide attention. Other topics connected to explanatory\nreduction and mechanisms in experimental research are cancer\n(Bertolaso 2013, 2016, Bizzarri et al. 2008, Green 2021, Moss 2002,\nPlutynski 2013, Soto and Sonnenschein 2005, 2006) and stem cells\n(Fagan 2013, Laplane 2016, Laplane and Solary 2019). Because of the\ndiversity of explanations found in these different disciplines, the\nnature of scientific explanation returns with a vengeance (Schaffner\n2006). Although only a few reductionists demand that explanation be\nstrictly nomological (Rosenberg 2006, Weber 2005), the subtle\ninterplay between explanation and reduction must be treated when\nranging over diverse biological subdisciplines. Additionally, as more\nattention is given to the diversity of investigative reasoning (or\n\u201cscientific practice\u201d) in and among these disciplinary\ncontexts, the interplay between different aspects of methodological\nand epistemic reduction will become more salient. To achieve an\nunderstanding of the intricacy and diversity of scientific practice,\nit has become more common for philosophers of science to interact or\ncollaborate with scientists from various fields (\u201cengaged\nphilosophy of science\u201d), where some of the engagement with\npracticing scientists and stakeholders affected by science and\ntechnology also aims at influencing the methodological approaches\nadopted in such research (Brister and Frodeman 2020, Kaiser and\nMeunier 2014, Plaisance and Elliott 2021, Tuana 2010, 2013).\n\nA final prospect concerns whether discussions of reduction in\ndifferent sciences will interact fruitfully. Although questions about\nreduction in philosophy of physics have largely diverged from those in\nphilosophy of biology, some connections have been drawn (Batterman\n2021, Green and Batterman 2017). For example, Sarkar has approached\nquantum mechanics using his account of reductionism that was forged in\na biological context (Jaeger and Sarkar 2003). A potential\nintersection between these discussions arises around the relations\nbetween parts and wholes or temporality, which have come under\nscrutiny from philosophers focused on the physical sciences\n(H\u00fcttemann 2004, Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011, Rueger 2000,\nRueger and McGivern 2010). Another area worthy of more attention is\nreductive explanation in chemistry, which has been ignored in large\npart by philosophers of biology (see, e.g., Bishop 2010, LePoidevin\n2005, Ramsey 1997, Scerri 1994, 2000).\n\nIn all these cases it seems clear that debates about reductionism in\nbiology have not reached a denouement but rather portend vigorous\nphilosophical discussion as the heterogeneity of issues related to its\nontological, epistemological, and methodological types are brought to\nbear on perennial biological topics. The task of philosophers focused\non reductionism in biology will be to analyze these promiscuities of\nreasoning and seek to develop different accounts of reduction that\ncapture what scientists actually do and contribute to more general\nperspectives on biological knowledge and scientific inquiry.",
