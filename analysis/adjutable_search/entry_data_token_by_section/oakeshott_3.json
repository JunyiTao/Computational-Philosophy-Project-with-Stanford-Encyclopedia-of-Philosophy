    "main_text": "Civil Association\n4. Civil Association\n\n\nFor the study of politics to be genuinely philosophical, Oakeshott\nthought, it must exchange the vocabulary of political activity for one\nthat explains politics in other terms\u2014different terms from those\nto be explained. But this can lead to misunderstanding because the\nvocabularies are not interchangeable. The need to escape the shackles\nof an inherited political vocabulary explains why, in On Human\nConduct especially, Oakeshott modifies that vocabulary to\ndistinguish the kind of association he calls \u201ccivil\u201d from\nassociation to promote a substantive purpose, \u201centerprise\u201d\nassociation. If we apply the idea of enterprise association to the\nstate, we necessarily generate a conception of it as a corporate\nundertaking. Civil association, in contrast, implies a state whose\nlaws leave citizens free to pursue their own self-chosen purposes: a\nstate premised on the independence of those associated and therefore\ncommitted to resisting the domination that occurs in private life when\nsome impose their preferences on others and in public affairs when the\nstate itself is organized to impose a collective purpose on\neveryone. For this to work there must be limits to the pursuit of\nindividual purposes, and in civil association these are understood as\nlimits that enjoin respect for the freedom of all. Oakeshott\u2019s\nLatinate terminology\u2014civitas for state, cives\nfor citizens, lex for law, jus for the rightness of\nlaw, and respublica for the common good\u2014springs from\nhis wish to direct the reader away from the conventional connotations\nof the English words by using words less closely identified with the\nconcerns of enterprise association that pervade modern politics and\ntherefore modern political discourse. Civitas is a mode of\nassociation in which cives are related to one another as\nfellow subjects of common laws and in which the laws based are\nnoninstrumental.\n\n\nAn obvious objection to this view is that a state needs instrumental\nas well as noninstrumental laws; no state can function without issuing\norders and framing policies to secure compliance, raise revenue,\ndefend itself against enemies, and so forth. Oakeshott would not\ndisagree. Any actual state is a mixture of formal and substantive\nelements, procedures and policies, civil and enterprise\nassociation. But defining civil association does not mean identifying\nthe features of an actual state; it means identifying the\n\u201cpostulates\u201d of civil association as a mode of\nassociation. These are attributes of a state that determine its civil\ncharacter and distinguish it from states in which that character is\nrecessive or even suppressed, as in a despotism. Cives are\nunited in their recognition of the authority of lex and of\nthe obligations it prescribes. The law identified as lex\nconstrains citizens in the same way that Hobbes said hedges constrain\ntravelers: keeping them on the roads without prescribing their\ndestinations (Leviathan, ch. 30). To say that the laws in a\ncivitas are authoritative is to say that their recognition as\nlaw is independent of whether cives approve of the\nobligations they prescribe. Similarly, to consider the desirability of\na law in civil association is to engage in an activity narrowly\nfocused on the question of whether that law is an appropriate\nexpression of respublica, conceived not as a substantive\ngood, interest, or purpose but as rules, procedures, and offices\ngoverning the conduct of the associates (OHC 147\u2013149):\nthis is the res publica, the \u201cpublic concern\u201d,\nwhich is the proper subject for political deliberation in civil\nassociation. In an actual state, however, the public concern includes\nsubstantive goods that follow from or are needed to sustain the rule\nof law, for it is the rule of law that defines the civil\ncondition. These goods, as Kant and others have observed, might\ninclude policing, roads, schools, hospitals, and social security\n(Ripstein 2009: chs. 8 and 9). Civil laws do not violate the premises\nof civil association when they redress \u201cpublic bads\u201d such\nas poverty, epidemic disease, or air pollution (de Jongh\n2022). There is, in short, ample room for welfare concerns\nwithin the civil condition, once the idea of civil association is\nbrought down to earth. \n\n\nOakeshott considers the implications of a \u201ccivil\u201d\nunderstanding of the modern state in many writings, but most\nsystematically in his essays \u201cOn the Civil Condition\u201d\n(OHC Part II) and \u201cThe Rule of Law\u201d (OH\n119\u2013164). Underlying the theory of civil association that he\ndevelops in these works is a distinction between two modes of human\nrelationship, one moral and the other prudential. Laws in the mode of\ncivil association, which is an idea abstracted from what might be\ngoing on in an actual state, are noninstrumental rules enabling the\ncoexistence of independent wills, not instruments to advance a\ncollective purpose. Such laws are \u201cmoral\u201d, in the sense\nthat they prescribe authoritative constraints on how individuals may\ngo about satisfying their wants, not prudential devices for achieving\nsubstantive satisfactions. In contrast to persons transacting or\ncooperating to satisfy wants, those who are related morally (in this\nsense of the term) are related on the basis of rules as rules:\nnoninstrumental standards of conduct whose authority is distinguished\nfrom their utility. One might question Oakeshott\u2019s use of the\nword \u201cmoral\u201d without disputing his suggestion that there\nis a distinction between the propriety of an act as judged by its\nrelationship to a rule and its consequential desirability. A moral\nrule binds people regardless of their purposes; it binds enemies as\nwell as friends. As a moral relationship, then, civil association\nunites people not as subjects compelled to pursue a collective goal\nbut as individuals pursuing goals of their own, subject to the\nconstraints of laws that are not the instruments of some larger\npurpose.\n\nLex is what Oakeshott calls an \u201cideal character\u201d,\nan abstraction that is not to be confused with the actual law of any\nexisting state. To theorize civil association is not to describe the\ncontingent features of a particular state but to identify the\npresuppositions of the state as a mode of association. Having\nidentified the modes of civil and enterprise association, Oakeshott is\nable to distinguish a legal order organized to advance a substantive\npurpose, one shaped by laws instrumental to that end, from one in\nwhich the laws are noninstrumental constraints on the choices of\nsubjects pursuing their own purposes. Once we have grasped the\ndistinction, we can see why he identifies the rule of law with civil\nassociation: differentiating the rule of law from other kinds of legal\nrule is necessary to distinguish between laws premised on the\nindependence of citizens and laws designed to conscript them for\npurposes not their own and thereby to dominate them. For Oakeshott,\nthe rule of law is a concept, not a description of any existing legal\norder, much less (as it is for a less philosophical thinker like\nFriedrich Hayek) a guiding ideal or ideology. In what has been called\n\u201cthe ambiguity thesis\u201d (Friedman 1989), Oakeshott holds\nthat any actual state\u2014any existing legal order\u2014is mixture\nof noninstrumental rules regulating interactions among citizens and\nrules instrumental to achieving substantive purposes: an ambiguous\ncombination of civil and enterprise association.\n\n\nThere will, then, be enterprise elements even in states in which the\ncivil character predominates. An actual state must have, in addition\nto rules of association, some way to recognize, alter, and apply those\nrules. Civil association, in other words, requires legislative and\njudicial institutions and an apparatus of \u201cruling\u201d\n(policing, licensing, conscripting, and the like). Such institutions\nare needed to anchor the idea of civility in the real world. The\ngovernment of an actual state will occupy buildings, keep records, and\ncollect taxes. And as a necessary part of governing it will sometimes\npursue substantive policies, attempt to produce particular outcomes,\nissue specific orders or commands, and concern itself not only with\nclasses of persons but with named individuals. These powers can be,\nand often are, misused, but they must be available if the rule of law\nis to be more than \u201ca logician\u2019s dream\u201d (OH\n149). But there is a difference between the conceptual presuppositions\nof civil association and the conditions for realizing it in the\ncircumstances of a particular state. In civil association the\npersona of the legislator, judge, or administrator is defined\nby the obligations of lex. A legislator is not an advocate\nfor policies. A judge is not an arbitrator between interests, nor is\nan administrator the implementer of a collective project. What is to\nbe legislated, adjudicated, and implemented is noninstrumental law,\nlex, not policies to advance the substantive purposes of a\nstate conceived as a corporate enterprise. In any actual state these\nroles\u2014legislator and policymaker, judge and arbitrator, ruler\nand manager\u2014may not be sharply distinguished. But in the mode of\ncivil association, they are distinct.  \n\n\nThere is also a difference between the authority of a law and its\ndesirability: a legal order that its subjects disapprove of might have\ndifficulty sustaining itself. The difference is conceptual as well as\npractical. Oakeshott joins legal positivists in distinguishing the\nvalidity of a law as law (which he calls its\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d) from its desirability or justice (its\n\u201crightness\u201d). But as his vocabulary signals, there are\nsubtle distinctions that he finds important. In a civil association, a\nlaw is authentic if it is the outcome of an authoritative procedure\nfor enacting or otherwise recognizing it as part of the legal\norder. This leaves open questions about its utility, moral legitimacy,\nconformity to some standard of fair distribution, or other qualities\nthat might bear on its desirability. For Oakeshott, the rightness of a\nlaw (or as he puts it, the jus of lex) is not a\nmatter of its consequences. He does not agree with John Rawls, Ronald\nDworkin, or other liberal egalitarians that the rightness of a law\n(which they call justice) depends on whether it fairly distributes\nbenefits and burdens (OH 156). Nor does he agree that it\ndepends on criteria that Lon Fuller (1969) calls the \u201cinner\nmorality\u201d of law, which requires among other things that laws be\npublic, general, and not retroactive. These are qualities not of\njustice but of legality, Oakeshott argues. A law that is secret,\ntailored to benefit or injure particular individuals, or designed to\npunish acts performed before its enactment is a disguised command, not\na genuine legal rule (OHC 128). He also disagrees with those\nwho think that a law\u2019s rightness depends on its conformity with\na higher law, whether divine or natural, with principles of human\nrights, or with any other universal and categorical standard\n(OHC 174; OH 142). \n\n\nOakeshott is less clear about what justice or rightness in civil\nassociation is than what it is not. He suggests that the most\nimportant consideration in assessing a law's rightness is whether the\nobligations it prescribes are appropriately imposed, in part because\nlaw is inherently coercive (OHC 160; OH 143). That\nan action is harmful, wrong, or otherwise undesirable is not\nnecessarily a decisive reason to forbid it legally. Whether a state\nshould constrain someone\u2019s choices on such grounds depends on\nwhat Oakeshott calls the moral-legal self-understanding of a community\n(OH 160). If the criteria used in judging the justice of laws\nare not already embedded in the way a community deliberates legal\nchanges, what is called justice becomes an arbitrary standard that can\nundermine the rule of law. The defect here arises when we judge a\ncommunity\u2019s laws according to abstract criteria unrelated to the\nself-understandings of its members. Here again, Oakeshott's view\nresembles that of Michael Walzer, who argues that appropriate and\neffective \u201csocial criticism\u201d comes from those who are\nexperienced in the ways of the community they criticize: they are\n\u201cconnected critics\u201d who base their criticism on the\ncommunity\u2019s own standards. They stand \u201ca little to the\nside, but not outside\u201d the communities whose practices they\ncriticize (Walzer 1987: 61). The desirability of a law, then, must be\njudged in relation to the practices of the community. These are not\nunivocal, however, and so the judgments are a matter for continuing\ndebate. Judging well requires a disciplined focus on the obligations a\nstate can properly prescribe. A law might be found wanting, for\nexample, if enforcing it were to require intrusive surveillance. The\ncharacter of deliberation in a state bearing the character of a civil\nassociation is defined by its style more than by its conclusions in\nparticular cases (OH 161).\n \nOakeshott\u2019s idea of civil association responds to a\nfundamental question in political philosophy: how can the nonvoluntary\ncharacter of law be reconciled with individual freedom? And his\nanswer, which self-consciously restates conclusions reached by\nRousseau, Kant, and J.S. Mill, among others, is that law respects\nindividual freedom only when it is understood as limited to regulating\nthe activities of citizens pursuing purposes of their own. A legal\norder of this kind must ensure adequate compliance with its laws, but\ncoercion for that end should be distinguished from coercion designed\nto advance substantive policies unrelated to maintaining the civil\norder. The state as a framework of laws for the coexistence of free\nindividuals becomes a tyranny when law is used to impose the purposes\nof some on others who do not share them. The legal subject in an\nenterprise state is not an independent citizen but someone to be led,\nmanaged, mobilized, or provided for: a subordinate assigned a role in\na purposive project. The dependent role-players in an enterprise state\nand the independent individuals in a civil one are equally\n\u201cfree\u201d, in one sense of that word, because both have\n\u201cagency\u201d, the capacity to choose even when their choices\nare constrained. But only in civil association do those associated\nenjoy \u201cindividual freedom\u201d, which for Oakeshott means\nfreedom from being legally subjected to the purposes of others.\n\n\nThis is a version of the republican idea of freedom as independence or\nnondomination (Skinner 1998; Pettit 1997), though for Oakeshott as for\nKant independence is defined in moral rather than material terms and\nstripped of certain other elements of republican political thought,\nsuch as that the people must make its own laws. Individual freedom,\nwhich is distinct from the freedom inherent in agency, is not\ncompromised by law in civil association. One reason for this is that\nin civil association, as a mode of association, laws are\ngeneral rules, not particular commands. The more nearly a state\nresembles an enterprise association in practice, the less it can\naccommodate activities \u201ceccentric or indifferent to its\npurpose\u201d (OHC 316). Participating in a purposive\nenterprise can express individuality only if participation is freely\nchosen. The subjects of an enterprise state are not independent,\nbecause the purposes they are compelled to serve have been chosen for\nthem. And although some may contingently escape servitude, whether\nthey are permitted to go (or for that matter to stay) is a management\ndecision (OHC 317). Because individual freedom in enterprise\nassociation is the freedom to dissociate as well as to associate, it\ncan exist only if the association itself is voluntary, and this cannot\nbe assumed if the association is a state.\n\n\nOakeshott builds his account of civil association in On Human\nConduct on an exploration of its presuppositions. These include\nthe ideas of agency, agents, actions, transactions to satisfy wants,\ninstrumental and noninstrumental practices, and the conduct of agents\nrelated in terms of such transactions and practices. And he explores\nideas about the modern state in European thought and practice, a topic\nhe also discusses in other writings (Oakeshott 1993b, 1996, 2006,\n2008). He traces the distinction between civil and enterprise\nassociation to the medieval ideas of societas and\nuniversitas, terms he borrows (and redefines) for his\npurpose. Societas designates a relationship of agents in a\npractice (such as a common language), agents \n\n\njoined not in seeking a common substantive satisfaction, but in virtue\nof their understanding and acknowledgement of the conditions of the\npractice concerned and of the relationships it entails. (OHC\n88) \n\n\n\nA universitas, in contrast, is a corporate undertaking (such\nas a partnership or school) established to advance a particular\nend. Societas is not identical with civil association,\nhowever; it stands for a larger class of relationships based on the\nnoninstrumental considerations that define them. The civil condition\nemerges only when these considerations harden into rules\n(\u201claws\u201d) and are supplemented with other rules for\nrecognizing, altering, and enforcing them. Oakeshott examines\nreflections on the modern state, so conceived, found in Machiavelli,\nMadison, Constant, and Montesquieu, among others, and more\nphilosophically (that is, in terms of its presuppositions rather than\nincidental features) in Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and\nHegel. He also examines the ideas of thinkers who saw the state as a\npurposive enterprise. These include Francis Bacon, for whom the state\nwas a productive estate, Joseph de Maistre, who saw it as \u201ca\nreligious corporation in the Catholic idiom\u201d (OHC 281),\nand various theorists of enlightened despotism, socialism, national\nself-determination, and economic development. But Oakeshott\u2019s\ndiscussion of these thinkers and their arguments is only loosely\nhistorical, inviting the charge that he is using them for his own\npurposes and in a way that does not meet his own standard of genuine\nhistorical inquiry.\n",
