This notion of a paradigm recurs in the Sophist, in \nthe Stranger\u2019s discussion of imitation (Sophist 235d\u2013e), but\nthe Sophist and Statesman use another conception as\nwell. A paradigm involves a mundane example with a \nfeature\u2014sometimes an essential feature\u2014relevant to the \ndefinition of the more difficult kind under investigation. In the \nSophist, an angler, defined as a sort of hunter, guides the \ninitial search for the sophist, who is also identified as a sort of \nhunter.\n\n\nA paradigm is not merely an example (or paradigmatic example) of some\ngeneral kind, as angling is an example of hunting and more generally\nof expertise. The search for the definition of the example reveals a\nprocedure, which can be transferred to the harder case, independent of\ncontent. Different paradigms introduce different procedures. The\nangler introduces the method of dichotomous division, and the\ndefinition of the angler recounts the steps on one side of that\ndivision. Both the procedure and definitional structure are featured\nin the harder case. The Statesman\u2019s main paradigm, weaving,\nis offered much later in the investigation, after an initial attempt\nto define the statesman by dichotomous division has led to an impasse.\nAgain, the example shares properties in common with the target\nkind\u2014both the weaver and the statesman engage in the art of\nintertwining, among other things. The paradigm also introduces a\nprocedure that can be extended to the target. The Stranger calls the\nnew procedure division \u201cby limbs\u201d (Statesman\n287c). By means of such division he gradually marks off the kind to be\ndefined (weaver or statesman) from other sorts of experts related to\nit in various ways and operating in the same domain. Plato\u2019s paradigms\nin the Sophist and Statesman typically reveal a\nproductive next move or series of moves in an investigation.  A\nparadigm indicates how to go on\u2014how to take the opening steps in\nan investigation or how to get beyond an impasse.\n",
