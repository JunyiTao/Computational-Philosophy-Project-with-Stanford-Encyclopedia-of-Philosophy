    "main_text": "The Nature of Memory || Theories of memory\n1.2 Theories of memory\n\nA theory of memory is roughly a theory of how memory works or of what\nremembering consists in. Almost no theories of memory are essentially\nepistemological. Almost none require any discussion of epistemology.\nFor that reason, this entry will say little about theories of memory\n(but see entry on\n memory).\n One unique theory of memory, however, merits coverage here: the\nepistemic theory of memory. Why? For one, it is essentially\nepistemological. And for another, it stands apart from what most of\nthis entry will focus on.\n Section 2\n covers theories that, in a way, use memory to illuminate\nepistemology, and epistemology to illuminate memory\u2019s\nepistemic power. The theories comment on the conditions in\nwhich memory provides or cannot provide some epistemic good, and why.\nThe epistemic theory of memory, however, uses epistemology to\nilluminate the memory\u2019s nature. Rather than explain\nknowing in terms of remembering, the epistemic theory explains\nremembering in terms of knowing.\n\nThe epistemic theory places an epistemic necessary condition on\nremembering. More specifically, propositional remembering requires\nknowing (Anscombe 1981; Ayer 1956; Audi 2002; Locke 1971; Malcolm\n1963; Moon 2013; Owens 2000; Pappas 1980; Williamson 2000). Any\nsubject who remembers that p knows that p. This\ntheory can lift a lantern to the nature of remembering, as it implies\nthat every necessary condition for knowing is also one for\nremembering. If knowing requires believing, remembering requires it\ntoo. If knowing requires truth, so does remembering. And so on.\n\nStronger versions of the epistemic theory say that remembering at a\nmoment requires knowing not only then but also previously. They add,\nmoreover, that that earlier knowing explains, or bears some other\nspecial connection to, the later knowing. Any subject who remembers\nthat p at a moment knows that p then because she\nknew that p before.\n\nThe epistemic theory faces more than one danger. To begin, it is worth\nnoting that the different versions of the epistemic theory generally\nwill not be complete theories of remembering. They state just\nnecessary conditions on remembering, not sufficient conditions. They\nmight be correct, but they do not say all that remembering is. Indeed,\nthey often could say much more. Suppose remembering requires knowing\nbecause of past knowing. The \u201cbecause\u201d here masks an\nomission. How does one know at one time because of knowing at\nan earlier time? The most natural answer is: by memory. But we should\nhesitate to accept that answer here. The epistemic theory is supposed\nto be clarifying what remembering is. Paired with the natural answer,\nthe epistemic theory says roughly that to remember requires memory to\nconnect knowing with earlier knowing. The explanation of remembering\ncritically involves some residual, opaque memory activity. An\nexplanation minimally citing memory, or one further elucidating its\nactivity, might be more insightful.\n\nA more common criticism of the epistemic theory is that knowledge\nrequires something that remembering does not (Bernecker 2010; see also\nAudi 1995; Lai 2022). One form of the criticism goes as follows.\nKnowledge roughly requires good and undiminished reason to believe.\nSuppose you remember that p\u2014you\u2019ve come to know\nthat p and therefore have reason good enough for knowing that\np. Later you gain reason to doubt that p (see\ndiscussion of defeaters in\n Section 2.2.3).\n Your reason to believe that p is no longer good enough for\nknowing that p. But can you now remember that p? The\nepistemic theory must say, perhaps unintuitively, you cannot. Perhaps\neven worse, the epistemic theory seems to imply that you remembered\nthat p up until you gained the reason to doubt. So you\nrecently remembered that p, but can remember no longer, and\nnot because of any forgetting. It\u2019s because of some\nlearning\u2014your gaining reason to doubt. It may instead be more\nplausible to suppose the epistemic theory is mistaken. Remembering\ndoes not require good and undiminished reason to believe, in which\ncase it does not require knowing.\n\nAlso, if the epistemic theory is correct, there is no remembering\nfalsely. Knowledge requires truth. Remembering, if it requires\nknowing, also requires truth. Propositional misremembering,\nthen, isn\u2019t remembering at all. At best it\u2019s mere apparent\nremembering. It\u2019s not memory\u2019s doing. In other words,\nwhether a subject is remembering that p is not settled by the\nmechanisms that produce p as an output for the subject and by\nthe functions of those mechanisms. Instead, the accuracy of p\nalso matters for whether the subject counts as remembering. The\nepistemic theory is only as plausible as this consequence (cf. De\nBrigard 2014).\n\nFinally, the epistemic theory\u2019s prospects may depend on the\nempirical matter of whether and how memory is generative. Perhaps\nresearch in neuroscience and cognitive psychology could make it\nplausible that propositional remembering is in some cases generative.\nThis would doom at least the stronger versions of the epistemic\ntheory. Knowing that p in the past would be unnecessary for\nremembering that p now, if memory can generate p as\nthe content of some propositional remembering.\n\nDefenses of the epistemic theory tend to suggest that its alternatives\nare themselves flawed (Adams 2011; James 2017) or that the alleged\ncounterexamples to it are insufficiently clear (Moon 2013; Sakuragi\n2013).\n",
