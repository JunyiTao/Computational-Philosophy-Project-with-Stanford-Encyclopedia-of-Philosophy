    "main_text": "Concepts of Consciousness || Consciousness as an entity\n2.3 Consciousness as an entity\n\n\nThe noun \u201cconsciousness\u201d has an equally diverse range of\nmeanings that largely parallel those of the adjective\n\u201cconscious\u201d. Distinctions can be drawn between creature and\nstate consciousness as well as among the varieties of each. One can\nrefer specifically to phenomenal consciousness, access consciousness,\nreflexive or meta-mental consciousness, and narrative consciousness\namong other varieties.\n\n\nHere consciousness itself is not typically treated as a substantive\nentity but merely the abstract reification of whatever property or\naspect is attributed by the relevant use of the adjective\n\u201cconscious\u201d. Access consciousness is just the property of\nhaving the required sort of internal access relations, and qualitative\nconsciousness is simply the property that is attributed when\n\u201cconscious\u201d is applied in the qualitative sense to mental\nstates. How much this commits one to the ontological status of\nconsciousness per se will depend on how much of a Platonist one is\nabout universals in general. (See the entry on\n the medieval problem of universals.)\n It need not commit one to consciousness as a distinct entity any more\nthan one's use of \u201csquare\u201d, \u201cred\u201d or\n\u201cgentle\u201d commits one to the existence of squareness,\nredness or gentleness as distinct entities.\n\n\nThough it is not the norm, one could nonetheless take a more\nrobustly realist view of consciousness as a component of reality. That\nis one could think of consciousness as more on a par with\nelectromagnetic fields than with life.\n\n\nSince the demise of vitalism, we do not think of life per\nse as something distinct from living things. There are living\nthings including organisms, states, properties and parts of organisms,\ncommunities and evolutionary lineages of organisms, but life is not\nitself a further thing, an additional component of reality, some vital\nforce that gets added into living things. We apply the adjectives\n\u201cliving\u201d and \u201calive\u201d correctly to many things,\nand in doing so we might be said to be attributing life to them but\nwith no meaning or reality other than that involved in their being\nliving things.\n\n\nElectromagnetic fields by contrast are regarded as real and\nindependent parts of our physical world. Even though one may sometimes\nbe able to specify the values of such a field by appeal to the behavior\nof particles in it, the fields themselves are regarded as concrete\nconstituents of reality and not merely as abstractions or sets of\nrelations among particles.\n\n\nSimilarly one could regard \u201cconsciousness\u201d as referring\nto a component or aspect of reality that manifests itself in conscious\nstates and creatures but is more than merely the abstract\nnominalization of the adjective \u201cconscious\u201d we apply to\nthem. Though such strongly realist views are not very common at\npresent, they should be included within the logical space of\noptions.\n\n\nThere are thus many concepts of consciousness, and both\n\u201cconscious\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d are used in a\nwide range of ways with no privileged or canonical meaning. However,\nthis may be less of an embarrassment than an embarrassment of riches.\nConsciousness is a complex feature of the world, and understanding it\nwill require a diversity of conceptual tools for dealing with its many\ndiffering aspects. Conceptual plurality is thus just what one would\nhope for. As long as one avoids confusion by being clear about one's\nmeanings, there is great value in having a variety of concepts by which\nwe can access and grasp consciousness in all its rich complexity.\nHowever, one should not assume that conceptual plurality implies\nreferential divergence. Our multiple concepts of consciousness may in\nfact pick out varying aspects of a single unified underlying mental\nphenomenon. Whether and to what extent they do so remains an open\nquestion.\n",
