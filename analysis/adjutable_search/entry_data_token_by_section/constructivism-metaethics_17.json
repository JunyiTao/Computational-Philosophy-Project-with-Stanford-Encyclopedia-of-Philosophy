    "main_text": "The Euthyphro Question || Constitutivist Strategies\n7.2 Constitutivist Strategies\n\nThe second way to construe the objection that constructivism tacitly\nrelies on realism focuses on the constitutivist strategy, which is\nadopted by many constructivists. This strategy appeals to constitutive\nhence \u201cunconstructed\u201d features of agency to ground a set\nof normative constraints. Constructivists hold that the appeal to such\nconstraints is neither arbitrary nor does it commit constructivism to\nmoral realism. But how does constructivism justify the norms it claims\nto be constitutive of practical reason? Again, the objection says,\neither they are arbitrary or they are realist and depend on some\nnormative features of reality, which are unconstructed (Fitzpatrick\n2013; Stern 2013; Baiasu 2016; Bratu & Dittmeyer 2016).\n\nWhile this criticism is addressed especially to Kantian\nconstructivism, in some sense it threatens all views that appeal to\nconstitutive norms of reasoning (Ripstein 1987; Enoch 2006,\n2011b).\n\nIs there anything ultimately at stake in whether we call the appeal to\nconstitutive norms realist, rather than constructivist? In addressing\nthe question \u201cWhy does x count as a reason for doing\ny?\u201d both realists and constructivists deploy\nunconstructed or underived elements. Non-naturalist realists say:\n\u201cIt just does\u201d, it is \u201csimply true\u201d that facts\nsuch as x count as a reason for doing y, and\n\u201cthere won\u2019t be any illuminating explanation of what makes\nthem true\u201d (Shafer-Landau 2003: 47, 48). In other words,\nrealists take the normativity of reasons as a primitive feature that\ndoes not require any explanation and for which no further explanation\nwill be useful. By contrast, naturalist realists hold that normative\nfacts are just natural facts, which can be investigated by ordinary\nempirical methods, for example, facts about the responses of agents\nunder idealized (naturalistically described) circumstances (see Smith\n2012, 2013).\n\nConstructivists would disagree with both views. The aim of\nconstructivism is not the reduction of moral properties to natural\nproperties; rather, this theory proposes a self-authenticating account\nof the standards of practical reason (O\u2019Neill 1989b; Korsgaard\n2003, 2009; Street 2010; Velleman 2009, compare Smith 2012, 2013).\n\nIn contrast to some kinds of realism, constructivism does not seek\naxioms or first principles or objective values on which to ground\nmoral truths (Bagnoli 2014, 2016). Rather than providing an external\nfoundation for morality, it holds that in forming our intentions and\nbeliefs, we are answerable to criteria of correctness that are\ninternal to and constitutive of the very exercise of rationality\n(Korsgaard 2008: 13\u201315, 110\u2013126, 207\u2013229).\n\u201cConstitutive standards are opposed to external standards, which\nmention desiderata for an object that are not essential to its being\nthe kind of thing that it is\u201d (Korsgaard 2008: 8). The\nconstructivist conviction is that appeal to standards constitutive of\nagency explains with ease why such standards are normative (Korsgaard\n2008: 8). They are normative because in the very activity of reasoning\nwe are committing ourselves to being guided by them (Wallace\n2012).\n\nAs O\u2019Neill remarks, the constructivist vindication of reason is\n\u201cavowedly circular\u201d: \n\n\nIf the standards of practical reasoning are fundamental to all human\nreasoning, then any vindication of these standards is either circular\n(since it uses those very standards) or a failure (since it is not a\nvindication in terms of the standards that are said to be\nfundamental). (O\u2019Neill 1989b: 29) \n\n\nThis kind of reply is shared by Kantians (Bagnoli 2016), Humeans\n(Velleman 2009: 138\u2013141) and other constitutivists (Ferrero\n2010a; Katsafanas 2013; Smith 2013; Arruda 2016).\n\nThe constitutivist strategy appears to be particularly problematic for\nthe varieties of Kantian constructivism that derive moral obligations\nfrom structural features of rational agency. Many contend that\nunderstood as a constitutive standard the categorical imperative is\nnot rich enough to identify moral obligations (Cohen 1996; Bratman\n1998; Gibbard 1999: 149, 152\u2013153; Fitzpatrick 2005). Some\nconstructivists offer similar grounds for rejecting Kantian\nconstructivism about reasons (see\n sections 3,\n 4,\n 5.1).\n In fact, most Kantian constructivists deny that moral obligations can\nbe derived from universal features of bare rationality alone and also\ndeny that appeal to constitutive norms of rationality is sufficient to\nprovide a complete system of moral duties (Bagnoli forthcoming).\n\nThere is room for disagreement concerning the principles that are\nthought to be constitutive of rational agency. Arguably, the principle\nof logical consistency is one such principle but it is generally\nthought to be too thin to help in rational choice. By itself,\nconsistency does not seem to account for the kind of constraints that\nrational agents need to impose on the dynamic process of goal\nmanagement (Shemmer 2012; Gibbard 1999; Smith 1999). To account for\nthese normative constraints, some add a broad principle of coherence,\nwhich demands a unified account of the agent\u2019s goals, and thus\ngoes beyond strict logical consistency (Shemmer 2012). Others argue\nfor additional but related principles, which regulate attention and\ndisregard (James 2007, 2012), respect for others having equal standing\n(Bagnoli 2013b), benevolence and non-interference (Smith 2013: 322,\n328). Kantians hold that the normativity of instrumental principles of\nrationality rests on the normativity of non-instrumental principles\n(O\u2019Neill 1989b: 73\u201374; Korsgaard 1997, 2008: esp.\n67\u201369).\n\nThe differences among these views can be illustrated by comparing\ntheir respective diagnoses of a fictional Caligula whose state of mind\nis completely coherent but who values torturing people for fun (Street\n2010: 371). For realists, he is in error about some true moral value.\nThere are some reasons\u2014for example, the reason not to torture\nothers for fun\u2014that we have quite independently of our\nevaluative attitudes and practical reasoning. Kantians agree with\nrealists that fictional Caligula has no good reasons for torturing\nanyone, but differ in explaining why this is so. Some Kantians think\nthat fictional Caligula is incoherent, even though not obviously so.\nHis incoherence can be shown by spelling out the norms that are\nconstitutive of valuing. Such constitutive norms entail valuing\nhumanity, and this shows that fictional Caligula is making a mistake\nby his own lights, even though he may never fully realize this, due to\npoor reflection, ignorance of the non-normative facts or some other\nlimitation (Korsgaard 1996a: 121\u2013123). A different Kantian\nargument establishes that an internally coherent Caligula is\nconceivable, that is, he can be thought without contradiction, but his\ncase is blocked by general facts about moral sensibility (Engstrom\n2009: 243, \u00a7 III.7, Bagnoli 2009). Such a Caligula would have no\nreason to torture others. By contrast, Humean constructivists hold\nthat an internally coherent Caligula is possible and that such a\nperson has reasons for torturing others (Street 2009).\n",
