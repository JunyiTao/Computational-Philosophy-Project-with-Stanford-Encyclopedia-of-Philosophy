    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is the nature of motion in physical theories and theorising, and\nis there any significance to the distinction between\n\u2018absolute\u2019 and \u2018relative\u2019 motion? In the\ncompanion article, on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n we discussed how such questions were addressed in the history of\nphysics from Aristotle through to Newton and Leibniz. In this article,\nwe explore the ways in which the selfsame issues have been taken up by\ncontemporary authors, beginning with Mach, moving on to Einstein, and\nconcluding with a discussion of two highly relevant modern research\nprogrammes: shape dynamics and the so-called \u2018dynamical\napproach\u2019 to spacetime. Readers interested in following up\neither the historical or the current debates about the natures of\nspace, time and motion will find ample links and references scattered\nthrough the discussion and in the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below.\n\nThe reader should note at the outset that this article presupposes\nfamiliarity with some of the basic concepts of relativity theory; in\naddition, section 3 presupposes familiarity with some relativity\nstandard machinery from theoretical physics (e.g., Lagrangian\nmechanics). It would not be appropriate, in this philosophical\narticle, to explain all of the background details here from the ground\nup. In lieu of doing so, we have (a) provided extensive references to\nliterature in which the relevant concepts are explained further, (b)\nhighlighted more technical subsections of this article which can be\nskipped on first reading, and (c) provided throughout non-technical\nsummaries of the relevant conceptual points.\n",
