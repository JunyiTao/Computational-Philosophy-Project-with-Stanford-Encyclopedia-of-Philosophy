    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice\n4. Pluralism and Rational Choice\n\nThe big question facing pluralism is whether rational choices can be\nmade between irreducibly plural values. Irreducible plurality appears\nto imply incommensurability\u2014that is to say, that there is no\ncommon measure which can be used to compare two different values. (See\nthe entry on\n incommensurable values.)\n Value incommensurability seems worrying: if values are\nincommensurable, then either we are forced into an ad hoc ranking, or\nwe cannot rank the values at all. Neither of these are very appealing\noptions.\n\nHowever, pluralists reject this dilemma. Bernard Williams argues that\nit is a mistake to think that pluralism implies that comparisons are\nimpossible. He says:\n\nThere is one motive for reductivism that does not operate simply on\nthe ethical, or on the non-ethical, but tends to reduce every\nconsideration to one basic kind. This rests on an assumption about\nrationality, to the effect that two considerations cannot be\nrationally weighed against each other unless there is a common\nconsideration in terms of which they can be compared. This assumption\nis at once very powerful and utterly baseless. Quite apart from the\nethical, aesthetic considerations can be weighed against economic ones\n(for instance) without being an application of them, and without their\nboth being an example of a third kind of consideration. (Williams\n1985, p. 17)\n\n\nMaking a similar point, Ruth Chang points out that incommensurability\nis often conflated with incomparability. She provides clear\ndefinitions of each: incommensurability is the lack of a common unit\nof value by which precise comparisons can be made. Two items are\nincomparable, if there is no possible relation of comparison, such as\n\u2018better than\u2019, or \u2018as good as\u2019 (1997,\nIntroduction). Chang points out that incommensurability is often\nthought to entail incomparability, but it does not.\n\nDefenders of pluralism have used various strategies to show that it is\npossible to make rational choices between plural values.\n",
