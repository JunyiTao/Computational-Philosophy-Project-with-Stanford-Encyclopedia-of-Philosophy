But no one holds\nthat view, for the reason just given: representation alone is cheap\nand ubiquitous. (Lloyd (1991) and Thau (2002) perhaps come close; Thau\nsuggests that representing a certain special sort of content does\nsuffice for a sensory quality.)\n\nStrong representationalism (defended by Dretske, Tye and\nLycan) is the view that representation of a certain kind\nsuffices for a sensory quality, where the kind can be specified in\nfunctionalist or other familiar materialist terms, without recourse to\nproperties of any ontologically \u201cnew\u201d sort. (A mixed\nrepresentational-functional view is what Block (1996) calls\n\u201cquasi-representationism.\u201d) We might further contrast (a)\ntheories that appeal to functional considerations only to separate\nsensory qualities from other represented properties with (b) theories\nthat use functional considerations more ambitiously, to distinguish\nqualitatively different experiences that have the same intentional\ncontent.\n\nWeak representationalism says only that qualitative states\nnecessarily have representational content, which admission is\ncompatible with sensory qualities also necessarily involving features\nthat are ontologically \u201cnew\u201d (Block (1990, 1996), Chalmers\n(1996)). Weak representationalism has been fairly uncontroversial\n(though it would have been denied by Russell, who showed no sign of\nthinking that his sense-data represented anything, and by behaviorists\nand Wittgensteinians who are hostile to the whole idea of mental\nrepresentation). At the very least, one who rejects it must try to\nexplain why we distinguish between veridical and unveridical\nexperiences; but more recently new opponents such as Campbell (2002),\nTravis (2004), No\u00eb (2005), Brewer (2006), and Fish (2009) have\nattempted just that.\n\nThroughout the rest of this entry, unless otherwise noted,\n\u201crepresentationalism\u201d shall mean the strong\nrepresentationalist view. The mixed sort of account that Block calls\n\u201cquasi-representationism\u201d is a version of strong\nrepresentationalism, since it does rule out qualitative features that\nare both nonintentional and nonfunctional.\n\nAlso, we shall consider strong representationalism as applying to all\nsensory states, including bodily sensations as well as visual and\nother perceptions. Weak representationalism is somewhat controversial\nfor pains, itches and other sensations, since it is not obvious that\nsuch sensations represent anything at all. Accordingly, strong\nrepresentationalism will be all the less defensible for them.\n\nThere are further issues that divide strong representationalists,\ngenerating different versions of the view. One is the question, of\nwhether sensory qualities themselves, in our very specific sense,\nexhaust all of what has usually been thought of as a sensory\nstate\u2019s overall phenomenal character. Dretske and Tye maintain\nthat they do; Lycan (1998) and others argue that they do not. This\nmatter will be discussed below, in the context of what is called the\n\u201ctransparency\u201d thesis.\n",
