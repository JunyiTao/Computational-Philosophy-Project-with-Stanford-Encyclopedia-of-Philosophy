For instance, the\nmarriage rite has two different meanings for men and women. As\nexplained in the White Tiger Hall (Baihutong), the\nterm \u201cmarriage\u201d (jiaqu \u5ac1\u5a36) is in\nfact a compounded term: jia \u5ac1 for women and\nqu \u5a36 for men. For a woman, to get married\n(jia \u5ac1) is to seek an external completion so as to\nfind a suitable home, and for a man, to qu \u5a36 is to\nacquire [a bride] (Baihutong, \u201cJiaqu\u201d\nchapter; for other translations see Tjan 1949 [1952]; also\nsee Shuowen jiezi). In other words, in the family system of\npatrilineage, marriage for the groom is an occasion of\nacquisition for his family contiguous to his existing\nidentity, whereas for the bride an occasion of exodus from her own\nnatal family in search for a new home, an external completion to her\npersonhood/womanhood.\n\nA successful integration into the husband\u2019s patrilineage is\nindeed essential to a woman\u2019s life ritually and by necessity. In\nthe Confucian textual tradition, marriage is consummated, however, not\nthrough the physical intimacy between the husband and wife, but\nthrough the ritual completion of ancestor worship. According to the\nLiji, the purpose of marriage is twofold: first is to secure\nthe sacrificial service in the ancestral temple, and second to\ncontinue the lineage (Liji, \u201cHunyi\u201d\nchapter). To secure her service to the ancestral hall marks the\npriority of the marriage institution and hence also marks the\nbeginning of a consummated marriage through which a new bride\nestablishes herself as part of this new patrilineage.\n\nA new bride becomes a wife in the fullest sense only after she has\npartaken in the ancestral rites; otherwise, she is not yet a member of\nher new patrilineal family. As explained in the\nBaihutong,\n\n\nTo take in a wife without first announcing it in the ancestral temple,\nit will be inauspicious [\u2026] Once a wife has been here for three\nmonths, she is now allowed to partake in the ancestral worship\n[\u2026] If she dies before partaking in the ancestral worship, her\nbody is to be interred with her natal family; this is to show that she\nis not yet a wife in the fullest sense. (Baihutong,\n\u201cJiaqu\u201d chapter; also see Liji,\n\u201cZengziwen\u201d chapter)\n\n\nIn addition, according to the customary law of \u201cThree grounds a\nwife cannot be expelled\u201d (sanbuchu\n\u4e09\u4e0d\u51fa) as stated in the Family Sayings of\nConfucius (Kongzi jiayu), a wife\u2019s participation\nin the three-year mourning ritual for the in-laws constitutes one of\nthe three compelling grounds that overrides the customary law of\n\u201cSeven reasons for expelling a wife\u201d (qichu\n\u4e03\u51fa), one of which is childlessness (Kongzi\njiayu, \u201cBenmingjie\u201d chapter; for other\ntranslations see Kramers\n 1950).[11]\n In sum, for a woman to establish herself as part of this new\npatrilineage, she must retrospectively observe the ancestral rites or\nprospectively provide a male heir.\n",
