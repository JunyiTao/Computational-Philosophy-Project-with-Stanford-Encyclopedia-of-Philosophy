    "main_text": "Diachronic Dutch Book Arguments || The Principle of Reflection\n4.3 The Principle of Reflection\n\nA Dutch Strategy argument has also been given for the controversial\nPrinciple of Reflection, which requires that for any proposition \\(A\\)\nand any future time \\(t\\), an\nagent\u2019s current probability for \\(A\\) conditional\non later assigning it probability \\(r\\) is itself \\(r\\),\nthat is pr \\((A\\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r) = r\\). In\nviolating Reflection, the agent fails to endorse certain of her\npossible future judgments, which as van Fraassen showed (van Fraassen\n1984), opens the door to a Dutch Strategy. If the agent violates\nReflection in that \\(\\pr(A\\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r) \\gt r\\), the bookie\nsells the following bets:\n\n\n\n(Bet 1)\nfor \\(\\pr(A \\wedge \\pr_t(A) = r)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($1\\)\nif \\((A \\wedge \\pr_t(A) = r)\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\n\n\n(Bet 2)\nfor \\(x\\,\\pr(\\pr_t(A)\\ne r)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($x\\)\nif \\(\\pr_t(A)\\ne r\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\n\n\n(Bet 3)\nfor \\((x-r)\\,\\pr(\\pr_{t}(A) = r)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($x-r\\)\nif \\(\\pr_t(A) = r\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\nwhere \\(x = \\pr(A \\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r)\\).\n\nIn the event that \\(\\pr_{t}(A) = r\\), the bookie then buys a fourth\nbet from the agent on \\(A\\) with a prize of 1, with a\nprice of the agent\u2019s new probability.\n\nThe idea that the existence of such a strategy shows that agents\nshould satisfy Reflection has been widely disputed, even by many who\ntake the Dutch Book arguments for probabilism and conditionalization\nas having force. Much of the discussion stems from a variety of\ncounterexamples to Reflection in which it appears irrational not to\nviolate the principle. One example, due to Talbott, turns on the fact\nthat real agents lack perfect recall (Talbott 1991). He considers a\nperson who had spaghetti \\((S)\\) the previous night, say November 16,\nand contemplates the probability that she will give to her having\neaten spaghetti on that day in year\u2019s time. Since she eats\nspaghetti on average one out of every ten days, she thinks it likely\nthat \\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).1. But surely she should not assign a\nprobability of 0.1 to her having had spaghetti the previous night\nconditional on the claim that \\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).1, since she is\nnearly certain (say \\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).99) of what she had for dinner\nthe previous night.\n\nThe forgetting that makes it reasonable to violate Reflection in\nTalbott\u2019s spaghetti dinner example involves one type of limited\nfuture impairment. Christensen gives a different case in which an\nagent has just consumed a mind-altering drug (LSQ) that he expects in\nhour\u2019s time will make him believe that he can fly, without\nconferring upon him any such power (Christensen 1991). However, this\nis the only effect of the drug, so that the agent\u2019s faculties\nwill remain otherwise acute. Before the drug takes effect, the agent\nshould not take his probability that he can fly conditional on his\ncoming to believe it in an hour to be high, as required by Reflection,\nbecause what he will think when under the influence is irrelevant to\nhis ability to fly. A similar example involving Ulysses and the Sirens\nis discussed by van Fraassen (1995).\n\nIt is important in both of these examples that it is not only\nreasonable to violate Reflection, but that to do otherwise would\ninvolve failing to properly account for the evidence about the\nunreliability of one\u2019s future beliefs. Christensen\u2019s own\nresponse involves arguing that because the bets in diachronic Dutch\nBook arguments are made over time, unlike in the synchronic argument\nfor the probability axioms, they do not reveal a form of inconsistency\nthat is generally irrational. One of several troubles with this is\nthat it would require rejecting the claim that the Dutch Strategy\nagainst agents who plan to violate Conditionalization reveals any sort\nof problematic inconsistency. Other problems with Christensen\u2019s\nresponse are discussed in (Vineberg 1997).\n\nOthers have tried to respond to the counterexamples by distinguishing\nfeatures of the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection that do not\ninvolve dismissing all diachronic Dutch Book arguments. For instance,\nHitchcock emphasizes that it is important to consider what the bookie\nknows in assessing the relevance of Dutch Books on an agent\u2019s\nrationality (Hitchcock 2004). He observes that unlike the case in\nwhich an agent violates the probability axioms, where the bookie can\ndetermine and place the bets with only the knowledge of the\nagent\u2019s beliefs, in Talbott\u2019s example, the bookie may need\nto exploit information that is unavailable to the agent in order to\nmake the Dutch Book.\n\nTaking into account what a bookie needs to know in order to guarantee\nhimself a profit fails to distinguish adequately between the Dutch\nBooks that appear to be norms of rationality and those that do not.\nFirst, as Hitchcock acknowledges, this won\u2019t work to resolve the\ntension between the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection and many of\nthe other counterexamples. In Christensen\u2019s example, taking LSQ\ndoes not have any effect on memory, it merely changes the\nagent\u2019s evaluation of his ability to fly, that is, he changes\nhis view of a very limited bit of evidence, so that the Dutch Strategy\ncan be carried out without the bookie having relevant information that\nthe agent lacks.\n\nStill, perhaps we might take the fact that a book can be made without\nhaving knowledge beyond that of the agent as at least a necessary\ncondition for a telling book. Various cases, besides that of the\nspaghetti dinner, give plausibility to the idea that a Dutch Book only\nestablishes the unreasonableness of violating a particular principle\nwhen the book is made with no special knowledge not possessed by the\nagent. Consider an agent who violates the probability axioms in virtue\nof failing to recognize some complicated logical truth. Arguably this\nis not unreasonable, and setting up a Dutch Book in this case would\nrequire knowledge that the agent lacks. But, insofar as the\nirrationality in violating the axioms stems from the fact that it is\nsupposed to be a form of inconsistency, as both Hitchcock and\nChristensen maintain, then the fact that a bookie might need (logical)\nknowledge that the agent lacks in order to set up the book, is\nirrelevant to whether the book has force. Whether an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs are inconsistent, unlike the question of whether she\nis to be regarded as reasonable, is independent of what she or anybody\nelse knows.\n\nBriggs offers another way of distinguishing those Dutch Books that\nmark the violation of a genuine norm from those that do not (Briggs\n2009). The contention is that whereas the Dutch Strategy against those\nwho violate Conditionalization reveals what Briggs terms incoherence,\nwhich is taken to be a form of inconsistency, the Dutch Strategy\nagainst violators of Reflection reveals merely self-doubt, which\ninvolves an agent who suspects herself of incoherence. Briggs assumes\nthat an agent\u2019s credences \u201ccondone\u201d accepting\ncertain bets as fair, and that an agent\u2019s credences admit of a\nDutch Book just in case those credences condone a set of bets that\nyield a net loss to the agent in every world where the agent has those\ncredences and accordingly would condone the bets. Violating the\nprobability axioms, Conditionalization or Reflection makes one\nvulnerable to a Dutch Book in this sense. Briggs observes that the\nbets in the Dutch Books that may be constructed against someone\nviolating either the probability axioms or Conditionalization will\nyield a net loss in every possible world; but, the bets in the Dutch\nStrategy against the violator of Reflection will not result in a loss\nin certain worlds in which the agent\u2019s beliefs differ from those\nthat she has in the actual world. Accordingly, Briggs suggests that\nincoherence is marked by Dutch Books that involve bets that result in\na loss in every world, and thus that violation of Reflection does not\ninvolve incoherence.  \n\nThis way of attempting to save the Dutch Strategy argument for\nConditionalization, while jettisoning that for Reflection, is\ncriticized by Mahtani (2012), who argues that Briggs\u2019 test\nmistakenly counts certain cases of mere self-doubt as\nincoherence.  Mahtani proposes a new way of understanding\nDutch Book arguments as revealing incoherence, according to which an\nagent is incoherent if and only if she would accept as fair a set of\nbets that would result in a loss under any interpretation of the\nclaims involved (Mahtani 2015). With this understanding, violation of\nthe probability axioms reveals incoherence, but violations of\nReflection and cases of self-doubt in which the agent isn\u2019t sure\nof her own credences do not count as incoherence, as they do not\ninvolve proper Dutch Books that result in a loss under any\ninterpretation. As she discusses, this way of understanding Dutch\nBooks leaves it open as to whether there is a proper Dutch Book\nargument for Conditionalization.\n\nBoth Briggs and Mahtani extract the condition of incoherence from the\nfeatures of certain bets.  However, it remains unclear as to\nhow precisely the concept of incoherence, in their sense, is to be\nunderstood, although they seem to take it as a form\nof inconsistency.  Still, the discussion is important\nfor there is some intuition that violating Reflection is less similar\nto holding inconsistent beliefs than violating the probability axioms.\nWhen it comes to Conditionalization, Briggs takes the Dutch Book\nargument as establishing the full principle that the rule will be\nfollowed, which appears too strong, since the consistency required by\nrationality does not seem to require having a plan for updating nor to\nstrictly require following through on such a plan. Indeed, precisely\nwhat sort of inconsistency is involved in cases where one is\nsusceptible to a Dutch Strategy on account of having an alternative\nupdating rule to Conditionalization remains unclear, and is perhaps a\npoint in favor of Mahtani\u2019s analysis upon which the status of\nConditionalization remains inconclusive. Against Mahtani, Pust\n(2021) claims that her reading of logical form is too narrow, and that\ngiven a more plausible account of logical form, cases of self-doubt\nwill be subject to Dutch Books that establish incoherence. Moreover,\nPust argues that the point applies to Dutch Books against violators of\nReflection, so that they too will count as incoherent. If this is\nright, Mahtani\u2019s new understanding of Dutch Book arguments would\nfail to distinguish as intended between Dutch Books\nto undermine the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection.\n The proposals of both Briggs and Mahtani must contend with\nthe subtle connection between credences and bets. Mahtani associates\ncredences with bets that the agent would accept as fair, but as\npreviously noted, having credences need not go along with accepting\nbets as fair in the way needed to connect the violation of various\nprobabilistic norms with a Dutch Book. While Briggs acknowledges that\nthere is a complex relationship between credences and bets, the notion\nthat credences condone certain bets also appears to be in the spirit\nof the depragmatized DBAs, which, as observed, suffer from various\ndifficulties.  \n\nPettigrew (2020) offers another way of jettisoning the Dutch Strategy\nargument for Reflection, while retaining that for Conditionalization.\n He observes that the Reflection principle is synchronic, whereas\nthe Dutch Strategy argument for it is diachronic.  As a result,\nhe claims that the Dutch Strategy argument here fails to target\nReflection.  Instead, he says that since violators of Reflection\ncan\u2019t follow conditionalization, if they have an updating rule, it is\nthis departure from Conditionalization that is implicated by the Dutch\nStategy. This approach to distinguishing the Dutch Strategy argument\nfor Reflection from that for Conditionalization and the probability\naxioms does not involve some sort of consistency, but rather it is in\nline with taking Dutch Strategy arguments to move directly from Dutch\nBook vulnerability to irrationality.  The trouble is that\nviolators of Reflection are subject to a Dutch Strategy no matter what\nfuture credences they come to have, regardless of whether they\nadopt a particular updating rule, so given the understanding of\nDutch Strategy vulnerability as indicating some form of irrationality,\nit is hard to see here why the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection\ndoesn\u2019t defend the principle as a norm.\n\nThe significance of distinguishing between different types of Dutch\nBooks so as to mark off some as pointing to a form of incoherence or\nirrationality is unclear. Whereas one or another\nproposal may comport better with our intuitions about what is\nintuitively incoherent (inconsistent), or irrational, if we retain\nRamsey\u2019s idea of credences as guides to action, then any way of\ndistinguishing between Dutch Books here looks problematic, since any\ncredences that lead to a sure loss are, at least to some extent,\ndefective as a guide to action.  \n\nRather than defend the idea that violations of Reflection can be\nrational by attempting to distinguish the Dutch Strategy argument for\nthe principle from other Dutch Book arguments that are desirable to\nretain, an alternative is to take each kind of Dutch Book as pointing\nto a defect, and then argue that the most reasonable attitude in\nsome circumstances is to hold on to less than ideal\ncredences. The view that Dutch Book vulnerability generally\ninvolves a departure from the ideal of consistency is\nendorsed in defense of Reflection by Huttegger (2013).  The\nidea is that whereas the Dutch Strategy argument does establish\nReflection as a kind of consistency constraint, this doesn\u2019t require\nthat in bad circumstances departure from the ideal cannot\nbe the most rational option overall.  This response does\nassume that violations of Reflection can sensibly be held as a form of\ninconsistency, and this remains controversial.\n",
