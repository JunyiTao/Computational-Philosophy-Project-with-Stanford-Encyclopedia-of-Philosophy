    "main_text": "Prime Matter\n12. Prime Matter\n\n\nGodfrey defends the matter-form composition of corporeal beings but\nrejects any kind of spiritual matter and therefore any matter-form\ncomposition of spiritual entities (Wippel, 2012). He also opposes the strong tendency\nwithin the Franciscan tradition, also promoted by Henry of Ghent, that\nwould assign some minimum degree of actuality to prime matter.\nAccording to Godfrey prime matter is pure potentiality and can never be\nkept in existence without some substantial form, not even by God. Prime\nmatter and substantial form are directly related to one another as\npotency principle and act principle. Neither is a being in its own\nright, but both are principles of one and the same composite entity\n(Quodlibet XIV, q. 5, PB 5.404\u201305).\n",
