    "main_text": "Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology || The Law\n5.7 The Law\n\nMany important questions in social ontology are connected to\njurisprudence, or the study of the nature of law itself. Consider a\ngiven legal obligation or prohibition in a locality, such as a U.S.\nfederal law on reporting requirements for public corporations, or a\nstate law governing medical reimbursements. Lawyers and judges mainly\nwork on specific applications of such laws, such as whether a\nparticular corporation satisfying a particular reporting requirement.\nIn certain circumstances lawyers and judges investigate and interpret\nthe content of the law, such as whether some provision is incompatible\nwith the Constitution.\n\nThe study of the nature of law is distinct from these. It can be\ndivided into two principal inquiries, corresponding to the division\nbetween the \u201cconstituents\u201d and \u201csources\u201d\ndiscussed in sections\n 3\n and\n 4.\n The first inquiry examines what determines or grounds the content of\nlaws in general, within a legal system. For instance, is the content\nof a law exhaustively determined by the statutes recorded in the legal\ncode? Or is that only a part of what determines the content of a law?\nOther candidate contributors to the content of a law are historical\njudicial interpretations, jury decisions, patterns of practices,\nlegislative actions and intentions, executive statements, general\nlegal principles, and moral principles. Hart (1961) casts this\nquestion as the inquiry into the \u201crule of recognition\u201d in\na legal system: that is, what conditions a proposition needs to\nsatisfy in order for it to be a law (see also Dworkin 1967, 1978,\n1986; Greenawalt 1986; Shapiro 2007, 2009).\n\nA second question is: What are the sources of these contributors to\nthe content of the law? In virtue of what do texts or enactments or\ninterpretations or moral considerations figure into grounding the\ncontent of a nation\u2019s laws? Positivist theories hold that social\npractices and other sociological facts are the sources of legality;\nnatural law theories argue instead that legality is rooted in human\nnature and that legal standards are independent of human decision and\npractice. A central problem for any theory of the sources of law is\nthe authority, or bindingness, which law carries (if it does carry\nthese). See the articles in J.L. Coleman, Shapiro, & Himma 2002,\nas well as entries on the\n nature of law,\n natural law theories,\n legal positivism,\n and\n the economic analysis of law.\n\nOther issues in the ontology of law pertain to the nature of entities\nthat pervade the law, such as contracts (Fried 1981, Barnett 1985,\nHart & Holmstrom 1986), promises (Scanlon 1990, Kolodny &\nWallace 2003, Owens 2006, Shiffrin 2008), and torts (J.L. Coleman\n1982, 1983, Postema 2001). The law also plays a central role in\nsetting up certain social categories, such as marriage and\ncorporations. Marriage is tightly regulated by the law in many\ncultures. Does the law define what marriage is, or is marriage set up\nwholly or in part by social practices? Likewise for corporations: does\nthe law have a privileged role in determining what types of\ncorporations exist in a modern society, or are corporations products\nof social and economic systems? (See\n section 5.3.)\n\nSocial ontology also has implications for the practice of lawmaking\nand adjudication. Theorists of corporate liability, for instance,\ninvestigate the nature of corporate agency and responsibility, and the\nrelation between these and the agency and responsibility of individual\npeople connected to the corporation (French 1984, Fisse &\nBraithwaite 1993, Erskine 2003, Gobert & Punch 2003, Pettit 2007).\nThe law is also often called on to adjudicate ontological questions,\nsuch as whether goods of a certain kind fall under a clause of a trade\nagreement, or whether a particular act is an instance of a\ncriminalized activity.\n",
