    "main_text": "Butch/FTM Border Wars and Border Zone Dwellers || Finding Voice in the Borderlands\n7.3 Finding Voice in the Borderlands\n\nThe work of C. Jacob Hale is a kind of philosophical intervention in\nthese borderland disputes. He offers one of the earliest theorizations\nof trans issues from within the analytic tradition. And in some ways,\nhis perspective welds together trans, queer, and feminist sensibilities\nfrom a distinctive queer, feminist, ftm vantage point. (Hale uses the\nterm ftm rather than FTM as a way to refuse the term as an\nabbreviation of female-to-male. Instead, for Hale, it is a\ncommunity-specific term. This discussion of Hale will respect his\nterminological decisions). His work centers around the analysis of\ngender categories.\n\nHale (1996) examines Monique Wittig's (1992) contentious claim\nthat lesbians are not women. (Wittig's point was to turn on its\nhead the heterosexist view that lesbians fail to count as women by\narguing that lesbians step outside the oppressive category of woman\nwhich requires heterosexual relations with men). Hale is one of the\nfirst to defend the view (now adopted by many feminist philosophers)\nthat the category woman is what Wittgenstein called a\nfamily-resemblance concept. The concept woman, in Hale's\nview, has thirteen, differently weighted characteristics none of which\nare necessary or sufficient for category membership (1996, 107\u201312).\nThis position enables Hale to then argue, pace Wittig, that some\nlesbians are women, others are not, and for some there is no fact of\nthe matter (1996, 115).\n\nIn Hale's view, the category woman is inherently normative (1996,\n104). Individuals who fall within it can be assessed on the degree to\nwhich they conform to the thirteen characteristics. For Hale, the\ncategory is governed by both positive and negative exemplars. Negative\nexemplars serve to proscribe certain forms of behavior and threaten the\npossibility of falling out of the category altogether (1996, 105). Yet\nwhile the threat of falling outside of the category must be in place to\nregulate conduct, owing to the cultural requirements of preserving the\nprevailing common sense about gender, very few individuals must\nactually fall outside of the category altogether (105\u20136).\n\nSimilarly, Hale argues, there is no single feature which can\ndistinguish between butch and ftm individuals (except, perhaps, the\nsheer self-identification with the very labels butch or\nftm). Not all ftms self-identify as men and not all\nbutches self-identify as women, some butches identify more strongly\nwith masculinity than do some ftms, and some butches avail themselves\nof body-altering medical technologies, while some ftms do not (1998a,\n321\u20132). Hale also critiques \u201cdesire for a penis\u201d as the\ndividing line between butches and ftms (199a, 326\u201330): Such an attempt\nerases complex butch desires as well as the idiosyncratic relationship\nof ftms to their bodies while accounting for butch/ftm distinctions in\na phallocentric way. Additionally, it draws on a model of\n\u201csex-change surgery\u201d which is borrowed from male-to-female\ncontexts (in which \u201cthe surgery\u201d is identified with genital\nsurgery) and thereby further promotes male-to-female dominance in trans\ncontexts (329\u201330). By this Hale means that \u201cthe surgery\u201d is\ntypically used to refer to genital reconstruction surgery. However the\ncentralization of one surgery is especially problematic in ftm\ncontexts. Double mastectomy and hysterectomy are other important\nsurgeries. Indeed, \u201ctop surgery\u201d (as it is sometimes\ncalled) often figures more prominently in ftm contexts.\n\nInstead, Hale suggests that both categories would be better analyzed\nas family-resemblance concepts (1998a, 323). If so, claims Hale, it\nwould be better to speak of a border zone where the categories\npartially overlap with each other than to search for a firm boundary\nbetween the two (323). The model allows Hale to, perhaps in the spirit\nof Anzald\u00faa, speak of \u201cborder zone\ndwellers\u201d\u2014individuals who live at the edges of multiple,\noverlapping identity categories. He argues that given the evidence,\nBrandon (Teena) appears to have been such a border zone dweller\n(317\u20139). Attempts to claim the dead (or the living) who live in such\nborder zones, argues Hale, make it even harder for such individuals to\nlive there (319). It makes it more difficult to live there by\nthreatening to eliminate border zone space altogether by trying to\nforce individuals who occupy it into other frameworks. Similarly,\nborder zone dwellers may face pressure to claim identity categories\nthat do not work well and which threaten to erase the specifics of\ntheir lived experiences (336). Such subject positions (constituted by\na lack of any central identity category) are important, albeit\ndifficult place to speak from (partially because there doesn't\nseem to be any available language). Yet such specificity must be\nmaintained, argues Hale, partially through calling into question the\nfunction of definitions and categories, partially through artistic\nendeavor that attempts to creatively give voice to experiences not\nwell captured in the available language (336\u20137). Hale strongly urges\nthat butch/ftm border zones be \u201cdemilitarized\u201d (i.e., that\ndifferent \u201ccamps\u201d such as ftm community and lesbian\ncommunity stop trying to claim border zone dwellers as their own)\nin order to make room for marginalized border zone dwellers themselves\n(340).\n\nHale expands on his notion of the border zone dweller in order to\noutline what it might be to articulate an ftm feminist voice (1998b).\nHe draws principally on Mar\u00eda Lugones' notion of\n\u2018world\u2019-travelling (Lugones 1987). In her view, those\nmarginalized by the mainstream may occupy different\n\u2018worlds\u2019 in which they may be constructed as different\npersons. (A shift in self, for Lugones, constitutes a shift in\n\u2018world\u2019). For Hale, then, border zone dwellers, those who\noccupy \u2018dislocated locations,\u2019 may fit within different\ncategories (\u2018man\u2019, \u2018ftm\u2019, \u2018butch\u2019,\n\u2018genderqueer\u2019 etc.) that attach to different cultural\n\u2018worlds\u2019 (1998b, 116\u20137). However, since these border zone\ndwellers are marginal with respect to the categories, their fit in all\ncases will be only limited and tenuous. In this way, Hale modifies\nLugones' conception of \u2018world\u2019-travel (which does not\npostulate such a tenuous fit into categories) (117). By contrast,\nLugones' conception insists upon the multiplicity of languages\nand systems of meaning, which is de-emphasized in Hale's\nmodel.\n\n\nHale argues that because many ftms have had experiences living as girls\nor women, have a history of moving in feminist \u2018worlds\u2019,\nand may be far more aware of the significance of masculine enactments,\nthere is a strong basis for wanting to avoid certain forms of\nmasculinity while embracing those which abide by feminist values\n(1998b, 118). This requires, according to Hale, maintaining human bonds\nwith non-trans feminist women and travelling to their\n\u201cworlds\u201d while continuing to recognize oneself as a border\ndweller. This is difficult, however, given assumptions by non-trans\nfeminists who do not have the experience of certain forms of gender\noppression (such as transphobia) (118).\n\nIt also requires caution with respect to the types of identifications\none makes. For Hale, identification as a member of a category\ninvolves both identifications with members of that group as\nwell as identifications as not-members of some other category\n(119). There may be pressure, through uptake of the category ftm, for\nexample, to identify primarily with non-trans men and to dis-identify\nwith butch lesbians. Such pressure, for Hale must be avoided (119).\nIdentification with may operate independently of\nidentification as a member of category (on the basis of, for\nexample, historical ties). The making of such identifications must be\nguided by the exercise of moral and political agency. In light of this,\nHale argues, gendered self-identities must be made secondary to moral\nand political identifications (120).\n",
