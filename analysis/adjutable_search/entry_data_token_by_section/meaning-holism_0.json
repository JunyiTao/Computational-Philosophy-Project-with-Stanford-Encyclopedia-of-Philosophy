General characterization of the view\n\nThe label \u201cmeaning holism\u201d is generally applied to views\nthat treat the meanings of all of the words in a language as\ninterdependent. Meaning holism is typically contrasted with\natomism about meaning (where each word\u2019s meaning is\nindependent of every other word\u2019s\n meaning),[1]\n and molecularism about meaning (where a word\u2019s meaning\nis tied to the meanings of some comparatively small subset of other\nwords in the language\u2014such as \u201ckill\u201d being tied to\n\u201ccause\u201d and \u201cdie\u201d or \u201cif \u2026\nthen\u2026\u201d being tied to \u201cnot\u201d and\n\u201cor\u201d).\n\nThe view is often traced to Quine\u2019s claims that \u201cIt is\nmisleading to speak of the empirical content of an individual\nstatement\u201d (Quine 1951: 43), and that \u201cthe unit of\nempirical significance is the whole of science\u201d (Quine 1951:\n42), and one finds an even earlier statement of it in Hempel\u2019s\nassertion that\n\n\nthe cognitive meaning of a statement in an empirical language is\nreflected in the totality of its logical relationships to all other\nstatements in the language. (Hempel 1950: 59)\n\n\nThe interdependence associated with meaning holism is usually taken to\nfollow from the meaning of each word (or sentence) being tied to its\nuse, with this \u201cuse\u201d typically being understood in terms\nof (1) all of the beliefs that could be expressed with (the words in)\nit (Bilgrami 1992; Davidson 1984), or (2) all of the inferences it is\ninvolved in (Block 1986, 1998; Harman 1973; Sellars 1974). The\n\u201cbelief-focused\u201d and \u201cinference-focused\u201d ways\nof characterizing use-based holism are often treated as\n interchangeable,[2]\n and will be so treated here unless the distinction is particularly\nrelevant in a\n context,[3]\n and so for our purposes here, meaning holism will be understood as\nthe following general view:\n\n\nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to produce a\nchange in the meanings of each of the rest.\n\n",
