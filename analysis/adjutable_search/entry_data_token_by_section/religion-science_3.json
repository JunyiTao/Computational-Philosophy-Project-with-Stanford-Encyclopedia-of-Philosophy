    "main_text": "Science, religion, and how they interrelate || The scientific study of religion\n1.4 The scientific study of religion\n\nScience and religion are closely interconnected in the scientific\nstudy of religion, which can be traced back to seventeenth-century\nnatural histories of religion. Natural historians attempted to provide\nnaturalistic explanations for human behavior and culture, including\nreligion and morality. For example, Bernard Le Bovier de\nFontenelle\u2019s De l\u2019Origine des Fables (1724)\noffered a causal account of belief in the supernatural. People often\nassert supernatural explanations when they lack an understanding of\nthe natural causes underlying extraordinary events: \u201cTo the\nextent that one is more ignorant, or one has less experience, one sees\nmore miracles\u201d (1724 [1824: 295], my\ntranslation). Hume\u2019s Natural History of Religion (1757)\nis perhaps the best-known philosophical example of a natural\nhistorical explanation of religious belief. It traces the origins of\npolytheism\u2014which Hume thought was the earliest form of religious\nbelief\u2014to ignorance about natural causes combined with fear and\napprehension about the environment. By deifying aspects of the\nenvironment, early humans tried to persuade or bribe the gods, thereby\ngaining a sense of control.\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, authors from newly\nemerging scientific disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, and\npsychology examined the purported naturalistic roots of religious\nbeliefs. They did so with a broad brush, trying to explain what\nunifies diverse religious beliefs across cultures. Auguste Comte\n(1841) proposed that all societies, in their attempts to make sense of\nthe world, go through the same stages of development: the theological\n(religious) stage is the earliest phase, where religious explanations\npredominate, followed by the metaphysical stage (a non-intervening\nGod), and culminating in the positive or scientific stage, marked by\nscientific explanations and empirical observations.\n\nIn anthropology, this positivist idea influenced cultural\nevolutionism, a theoretical framework that sought to explain cultural\nchange using universal patterns. The underlying supposition was that\nall cultures evolve and progress along the same trajectory. Cultures\nwith differing religious views were explained as being in different\nstages of their development. For example, Tylor (1871) regarded\nanimism as the earliest form of religious belief. James Frazer\u2019s\nGolden Bough (1890) is somewhat unusual within this\nliterature, as he saw commonalities between magic, religion, and\nscience. Though he proposed a linear progression, he also argued that\na proto-scientific mindset gave rise to magical practices, including\nthe discovery of regularities in nature. Cultural evolutionist models\ndealt poorly with religious diversity and with the complex\nrelationships between science and religion across cultures. Many\nauthors proposed that religion was just a stage in human development,\nwhich would eventually be superseded. For example, social theorists\nsuch as Karl Marx and Max Weber proposed versions of the\nsecularization thesis, the view that religion would decline in the\nface of modern technology, science, and culture.\n\nFunctionalism was another theoretical framework that sought to explain\nreligion. Functionalists did not consider religion to be a stage in\nhuman cultural development that would eventually be overcome. They saw\nit as a set of social institutions that served important functions in\nthe societies they were part of. For example, the sociologist\n\u00c9mile Durkheim (1912 [1915]) argued that religious beliefs are\nsocial glue that helps to keep societies together.\n\nSigmund Freud and other early psychologists aimed to explain religion\nas the result of cognitive dispositions. For example, Freud (1927) saw\nreligious belief as an illusion, a childlike yearning for a fatherly\nfigure. He also considered \u201coceanic feeling\u201d (a feeling of\nlimitlessness and of being connected with the world, a concept he\nderived from the French author Romain Rolland) as one of the origins\nof religious belief. He thought this feeling was a remnant of an\ninfant\u2019s experience of the self, prior to being weaned off the\nbreast. William James (1902) was interested in the psychological roots\nand the phenomenology of religious experiences, which he believed were\nthe ultimate source of all institutional religions.\n\nFrom the 1920s onward, the scientific study of religion became less\nconcerned with grand unifying narratives, and focused more on\nparticular religious traditions and beliefs. Anthropologists such as\nEdward Evans-Pritchard (1937) and Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski (1925) no\nlonger relied exclusively on second-hand reports (usually of poor\nquality and from distorted sources), but engaged in serious fieldwork.\nTheir ethnographies indicated that cultural evolutionism was a\ndefective theoretical framework and that religious beliefs were more\ndiverse than was previously assumed. They argued that religious\nbeliefs were not the result of ignorance of naturalistic mechanisms.\nFor instance, Evans-Pritchard (1937) noted that the Azande were well\naware that houses could collapse because termites ate away at their\nfoundations, but they still appealed to witchcraft to explain why a\nparticular house collapsed at a particular time. More recently,\nCristine Legare et al. (2012) found that people in various cultures\nstraightforwardly combine supernatural and natural explanations, for\ninstance, South Africans are aware AIDS is caused by the HIV virus,\nbut some also believe that the viral infection is ultimately caused by\na witch.\n\nPsychologists and sociologists of religion also began to doubt that\nreligious beliefs were rooted in irrationality, psychopathology, and\nother atypical psychological states, as James (1902) and other early\npsychologists had assumed. In the US, in the late 1930s through the\n1960s, psychologists developed a renewed interest for religion, fueled\nby the observation that religion refused to decline and seemed to\nundergo a substantial revival, thus casting doubt on the\nsecularization thesis (see Stark 1999 for an overview). Psychologists\nof religion have made increasingly fine-grained distinctions between\ntypes of religiosity, including extrinsic religiosity (being religious\nas means to an end, for instance, getting the benefits of being a\nmember of a social group) and intrinsic religiosity (people who adhere\nto religions for the sake of their teachings) (Allport & Ross\n1967). Psychologists and sociologists now commonly study religiosity\nas an independent variable, with an impact on, for instance, health,\ncriminality, sexuality, socio-economic profile, and social\nnetworks.\n\nA recent development in the scientific study of religion is the\ncognitive science of religion (CSR). This is a multidisciplinary\nfield, with authors from, among others, developmental psychology,\nanthropology, philosophy, and cognitive psychology (see C. White 2021\nfor a comprehensive overview). It differs from other scientific\napproaches to religion in its presupposition that religion is not a\npurely cultural phenomenon. Rather, authors in CSR hold that religion\nis the result of ordinary, early developed, and universal human\ncognitive processes (e.g., Barrett 2004, Boyer 2002). Some authors\nregard religion as the byproduct of cognitive processes that are not\nevolved for religion. For example, according to Paul Bloom (2007),\nreligion emerges as a byproduct of our intuitive distinction between\nminds and bodies: we can think of minds as continuing, even after the\nbody dies (e.g., by attributing desires to a dead family member),\nwhich makes belief in an afterlife and in disembodied spirits natural\nand spontaneous. Another family of hypotheses regards religion as a\nbiological or cultural adaptive response that helps humans solve\ncooperative problems (e.g., Bering 2011; Purzycki & Sosis 2022):\nthrough their belief in big, powerful gods that can punish, humans\nbehave more cooperatively, which allowed human group sizes to expand\nbeyond small hunter-gatherer communities. Groups with belief in big\ngods thus out-competed groups without such beliefs for resources\nduring the Neolithic, which would explain the current success of\nbelief in such gods (Norenzayan 2013). However, the question of which\ncame first\u2014big god beliefs or large-scale societies\u2014is a\ncontinued matter of debate.\n",
