    "main_text": "Religious Hatred and Anti-Semitism\n2. Religious Hatred and Anti-Semitism\n\nReligious belief is sometimes the source of putative cases of hate\nspeech, and sometimes its target. In both cases, assessing the\nconceptual addition of religion to hate speech is a difficult task.\nSpeech rooted in religious conviction is sometimes subjected to\nscrutiny to determine whether instances should count as hate speech or\nnot. For instance, the Westboro Baptist Church\u2019s demonstrations\noften make use of slurs and other explicitly defamatory language. This\nis an extreme case, which can be accommodated by extant hate speech\nlegislation. Other cases, however, involve religious leaders making\ncontentious statements\u2014for instance, questioning the legitimacy\nor recognition of LGBT+ individuals, while claiming these are\nstatements of love, not hate. Questions about religious speech of this\nsort concern whether it is simply contentious speech liberal\ndemocratic societies must tolerate or speech that runs afoul of deeply\nheld norms that ought to be proscribed.\n\nSome wonder whether religious sensibilities should be afforded special\nprotection from offense. Amnon Reichman (2009), for instance, notes\nthat some Israeli scholars have argued that providing special\nprotection for religious beliefs is a good idea \u201cso as not to\npush [religious] believers into having to choose between the authority\nof the state and the authority of their religion (namely, the\nauthority of God)\u201d (338). This relies on an assumption that\nreligion is an institutionalized normative regime in competition with\na legal regime where clashes over religious beliefs threaten the\nsocial fabric of society. It is in turn prudent to mitigate such\nclashes in order to avoid situations of unrest like the incidents\ninvolving comedic cartoons of Mohammed in the Dutch newspaper\nJyllands-Posten and the French publication Charlie\nHebdo.\n\nIt is not clear, however, that religious beliefs warrant special\nprotection over other forms of belief that may be just as strongly\nheld. Clashes over deeply held political beliefs can pose a similar\nthreat to the social fabric as religious beliefs. Thus, there is no\nreason to think the same concern should not apply quite broadly.\nProviding certain types of speech special protection on these grounds\nwould threaten to introduce quite repressive legislation on speech in\ngeneral.\n\nHolocaust denial, denial of the Armenian Genocide, and the denial of\nother crimes against humanity have also been the subject of special\nlegislation, especially in Europe. As Michael Whine (2009) notes, 16\nEuropean states, as well as Israel, have criminalized Holocaust denial\n(543). In these contexts, at least one rationale for banning speech\nthat denies or trivializes the Holocaust concerns its role in inciting\nhatred (Altman, 2012). One possible justification for such legislation\nrests on claims about what denial speech is. According to Martin\nImbleau (2011), denial speech poses as an historical endeavor but is\nreally propaganda. The denier\u2019s aim is to \u201ceradicate the\nawareness of the truth that prevents the resurgence of past criminal\nideologies\u201d (2011, 238). But if this is the rationale, it\npotentially opens up justifications for much broader application since\nsimilar claims might be made of other forms of propaganda. (For a\ngeneral overview on Holocaust denial, see Robert Wistrich (2012) and\nBehrens et. al (2017).)\n",
