    "main_text": "Twentieth Century || Music as Symbol: Langer and Goodman\n2.3 Music as Symbol: Langer and Goodman\n\nA recurring feature of twentieth century reflection on music is the\nattempt to consider it as a symbol system, and the related interest in\nthe analogies and differences between music and language.\n\nAn early and influential effort in this direction is that of Susanne\nLanger (1895\u20131985). In Philosophy in New Key (1942),\nshe rejects the idea that music is connected to emotional life in\nvirtue of a causal connection with emotions in the composer,\nperformer, or listener. Music is neither a \u201cstimulus\u201d to\nemotions, nor a \u201csymptom\u201d of them, but rather their\nsymbol:\n\n\nif it [music] has an emotional content, it \u201chas\u201d it in the\nsame sense that language \u201chas\u201d its conceptual\ncontent\u2014symbolically. (Langer 1942: 218)\n\n\nWhile music and language are alike in that they both have a semantic\nfunction, the analogy does not cut any deeper, according to Langer.\nShe distinguishes between discursive and presentational symbol\nsystems. Discursive symbolisms possess a vocabulary composed of\nidentifiable elements, to which a fixed meaning is associated.\nPresentational symbolisms lack such discrete meaningful units.\nLanguage is an example of the former, painting of the\nlatter\u2014both a sentence and a painting symbolize something, but\nthe sentence may be broken down into component parts with a fixed\nmeaning, whereas the painting cannot.\n\nAccording to Langer, musical symbols are presentational symbols of a\nparticular sort. The commonplace descriptions of music in emotional\nterms (\u201csad\u201d, \u201chappy\u201d,\n\u201cmelancholy\u201d, etc.) are due to an isomorphic relation\nbetween the dynamic form of music and that of feelings. For instance,\nthe musical expression of anxiety is achieved by prolonged, unresolved\ntensions, and this is the form of anxiety as we experience it. Because\nmusic matches the form of feelings much more closely than language may\neven aspire to do, musical symbols cannot be replaced by linguistic\nones without loss in precision\u2014this is Langer\u2019s version of\nthe ineffability thesis (see\n \u00a71.1).\n\nHowever, Langer acknowledges that radically different feelings may\nshare a common dynamic form, as may happen with an outburst of anger\nand one of joy. This means that music cannot have a definite emotional\nmeaning, but rather ranges over a variety of possible interpretations.\nThus, music is an \u201cunconsummated symbol\u201d, the exact import\nof which is not fixed (Langer 1942: 240).\n\nLanger\u2019s view has been attacked on various grounds (see Budd\n1985: chapter 6 and S. Davies 1994: chapter 3). Perhaps the most\nobvious objection is that music\u2019s dynamic structure matches that\nof emotions just as well as that of many other phenomena, but\nLanger\u2019s view does not explain why music is not a symbol of them\ntoo (Budd 1985: 114; Green 2007 offers a more plausible view of the\ncongruence between music and emotions).\n\nNelson Goodman\u2019s (1906\u20131998) Languages of Art\n(1968) is both a product of the already established theory of symbols,\nexemplified by Langer and Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), and a\nfoundational work in the development of analytic philosophy of art\n(see\n \u00a72.6).\n This is borne out by the tightly-knit weave of semiotics and ontology\nthat characterizes the book: Goodman develops a general theory of\nnotation that should account for the ontological status of works in\ndifferent art forms. He introduces a crucial distinction between\nautographic and allographic arts. Painting and\nsculpture are autographic, as only a determination of the work\u2019s\nhistory of production (that is, an attribution) guarantees the\nwork\u2019s authenticity. Music and literature are allographic, as\nwork identity depends on the presence of essential features as\ndetermined by a notation\u2014a word sequence in the case of a work\nof literature, and a score in the case of music. Forgeries of\nautographic works are works that claim a false history of production.\nForgeries of allographic works are impossible, as notation provides a\ntest for work-identity. If the candidate object meets it, it is an\ninstance of the work, if not, it is a different work.\n\nFor a notation to perform this function, it must meet certain strict\nsyntactic and semantic requirements (Goodman 1968: chapter 4). Goodman\nthinks that these requirements are met by most elements in Western\nmodern musical notation, with the important exceptions of dynamics,\ntempo indications, and others, which therefore become irrelevant to\nthe work\u2019s identity (but see Webster 1971). A performance counts\nas an instance of a given work if and only if it complies with its\nscore, and a work of music is nothing other than the class of\nperformances compliant with that score.\n\nThe notational systems that characterize allographic arts prescribe\nabsolute compliance, as a series of minor deviations could otherwise\nresult in a completely different work being considered an acceptable\ninstance of the original one. This means that only a note-for-note\naccurate performance of a musical work should count as an instance of\nit (see Predelli 1999).\n\nThis result is in tension not only with a sensible view of successful\nperformance, but also with one of Goodman\u2019s stated\nmethodological principles. He holds that the notational systems\ncharacteristic of allographic arts should provide rigorous identity\nconditions, while at the same time respecting our intuitive notion of\nwhat counts as a given artwork (Goodman 1968: 121\u2013122,\n197\u2013198). But Goodman\u2019s account of compliance between\nscore and performance is both too strict and too permissive to respect\nour intuitions: It fails to make room for pre-theoretically valid\nperformances (e.g., a rendition with a single wrong note), while\naccepting ones that we would consider incorrect (e.g., a performance\nthat is note-for-note correct, but played at a tempo that renders the\nwork unrecognizable). Subsequent work on the ontology of music has\ninherited from Languages of Art the notion of compliance and\nthe related idea that some features are determinative of a\nwork\u2019s identity, while also attempting to avoid Goodman\u2019s\nnotational strictures (see S. Davies 2001).\n\nGoodman\u2019s semiotic analysis also accounts for musical\nexpression. In his nominalist framework, for an object to possess a\nproperty is for it to be denoted by a predicate. If the\nobject refers back to that predicate, it exemplifies\nit\u2014a red swatch of cloth is denoted by the predicate\n\u201cred\u201d, but it also exemplifies it when it is used as a\nsample by a tailor. But properties may also be possessed\nmetaphorically\u2014a cloth is literally red, but a work of music is\nonly metaphorically sad. When an object exemplifies a property it\npossesses metaphorically, it expresses it. Expression is\nmetaphorical exemplification (Goodman 1968: 95). Note that this view\nexplains the logical structure of the description of music in\nemotional terms, but it does not attempt an explanation of why emotion\nterms are applied to music in the first place. In the philosophy of\nmusic, as in the philosophy of art more generally, Goodman was a\npivotal figure in setting the methodological tone of the subsequent\ninquiry in the English-speaking world, although his preferred\nsolutions have been largely disputed.\n",
