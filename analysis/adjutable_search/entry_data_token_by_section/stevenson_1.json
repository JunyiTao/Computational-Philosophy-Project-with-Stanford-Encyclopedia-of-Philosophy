    "main_text": "Ethics and Psychology || Ethics, Metaethics, and Moral Problems\n2.1 Ethics, Metaethics, and Moral Problems\n\nFor Stevenson, a field of study is demarcated by the kinds of problems\ninto which it inquires. Biology inquires into problems concerning\nlife; history inquires into problems concerning past social events and\ncultural developments; etc. Ethics inquires into ethical problems,\nproblems about what is good or bad, what ought to be done, how we\nought to feel about something, etc. Ethical problems are ubiquitous.\nThey are the \u201cproblems that are familiar in everyday\ndiscussions, and which range from idle bits of gossip about this or\nthat man\u2019s character to prolonged and serious discussions of\ninternational politics\u201d (1963a, v). Stevenson conceives of his\nwork as having \u201cfar less to say about the summum bonum\nof the philosophers than about the judgments of the ordinary\u201d\nperson as they finish \u201creading the morning\u2019s newspaper\u201d\n(1963a, v). He writes about his approach to the nature of moral\nproblems as follows:\n\n\nIt requires us to abstract from the detailed subject matter of the\nproblems and pay selective attention to the aspects of them that are\nmost likely to prod us into problem solving. It requires us\nto see these aspects not from a moral point of view (which would\nattend any attempt to settle the problems) but rather from\nthe point of view of an informal, common sense psychology. In effect,\nthen, it asks for a generic description, given in psychological terms,\nof those ethical doubts and uncertainties, or discords and\ndisagreements, that we often resolve by inquiry, deliberation, and\ndiscussion, but which on some occasions can lead us into an impasse,\nand on other occasions can induce us temporarily to suspend judgment,\nacknowledging that we are not yet in a position to come to a\ntrustworthy conclusion. (1963b, 186\u2013187)\n\n\nStevenson\u2019s aim was that of \u201csharpening the tools\u201d for the\n\u201clegislators, editorialists, didactic novelists, clergymen, and\nmoral philosophers\u201d addressing ethical (and other normative)\nquestions (1944,1). It is an interesting question how, precisely, the\nsharpened tools would help us in addressing such questions of\nnormative ethics (Stevenson doesn\u2019t say very much about this,\nbut see 1944, Ch. 15) Quite independently of this issue, though,\nStevenson\u2019s insights into how moral problems arise and are dealt with\nin our lives as social, communicative beings, are of seminal\nimportance to the development of metaethics.\n",
