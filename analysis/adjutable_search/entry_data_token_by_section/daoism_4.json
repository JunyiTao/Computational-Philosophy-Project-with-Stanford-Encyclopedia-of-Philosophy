    "main_text": "Daoism and Buddhism\n8. Daoism and Buddhism\n\nBuddhism came to China at a time when the intellectuals were hungry\nfor fresh ideas, but it arrived with massive handicaps. It was saddled\nwith the Indo-European focus on an appearance-reality metaphysics and\nepistemology, with with approximations to concepts of\n\u2018truth\u2019, sense-data experience, mind as a container of a\nsubjective world populated by counterparts of sensible objects,\npropositional knowledge, representational belief, a belief-desire\npsychology together with a logic-informed concept of\n\u2018reason\u2019 as both a human faculty and a property of beliefs\nand concepts. The highly developed Buddhist arguments had little\npurchase on Chinese intellectuals and the only available common form\nof discourse that could \u201cdomesticate\u201d this alien system\nwas Neo-Daoist \u201cabstruse learning\u201d which focused on the\nmetaphysical notions of being and non-being. That issue resonated\nsuperficially with a Buddhist puzzle about the nature of Nirvana. If\nNirvana was the opposite of Samsara (the eternal cycle of rebirth or\nreincarnation) then was it a state of being or of non-being? Nirvana\nis the achievement of the Buddha\u2014the expression of\nBuddha-nature. So the cosmology of this version of Buddhism, like that\nof the Neo-Daoists, aided achievement of some goal. Realization of the\npuzzling nature of this state led to Buddhahood.\n\nMeantime, Buddhism came armed with a paradox that would delight\nthinkers of a Daoist turn of mind\u2014the fabled paradox of desire.\nRebirth was caused by desire and Nirvana could be achieved only by the\ncessation of desire. That meant that in order to achieve Nirvana, one\nhad to cease to want to achieve it. This argument informs the Mahayana\nnotion of a Bodhisattva, who qualifies for Nirvana but voluntarily\nstays behind in the cycle of rebirth to help the rest of us.\nEnlightenment could only be achieved all at once. (This conclusion was\nalso a consequence of the Buddhist view that the ego is an illusion.)\nThe Mahayana wing of Buddhism was the more successful in China because\nthis implicit egalitarianism\u2014everyone could be Buddha, just as\neveryone can be a Daoist or Confucian Sage.\n\nThe other Buddhist philosophy that had the greatest appeal in China\nwas Madyamika, which answered the question of the nature of Nirvana or\nthe Buddha nature by not answering it\u2014Neo-Daoist quietism. The\nrealization of this emptiness was a kind of non-realization, a giving\nup, or an inexpressible, mystical, prajna-knowledge which\ncontrasts with \u201cordinary\u201d knowledge. This helped blend\ndiscussion of dao and Buddha-nature even more and fueled the\neventually widespread Confucian bias that they were the same basic\nreligion.\n\nMeantime, the introduction of a more \u201cWestern\u201d religious\nmodel (monasticism) to China and coincided with the launch of\norganized \u201cDaoist\u201d religions. Modeled thus in style and\nprogressively in content, Daoist religion, the quasi-religious\nNeo-Daoist stoical quietism began to blend with Buddhism. \n\nIn China, the two dominant theoretical Buddhist sects reflect the\ncosmological structures of the two Neo-Daoists. Tian-tai is\n\u201ccenter dominated\u201d with a single thought (the\ninexpressible Madyamika Buddha-nature) determining everything. Hua-yan\nshifts emphasis to the inter-relations of all \u201cdharmas.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a cosmos of interaction that constitutes the expression of Buddha\nnature. \n\nThe most Daoist of Chinese sects is famously the Chan (Japanese\n\u2018Zen\u2019) sect. We can understand its Daoist character by\nreturning to the paradox of desire. Laozi\u2019s analysis says artificial\ndesires are those created by learned distinctions. If we are to\neliminate the desire for Nirvana, it must be by\n\u201cforgetting\u201d the dichotomy of Nirvana-Samsara. This\nrealization is both the inner reality of enlightenment and corresponds\nto a mystical answer to the being/non-being of Nirvana. It underwrites\nthe Chan/Zen emphasis on practice, the here and\nnow\u2014\u201cevery moment Zen\u201d\u2014and the signature\n\u201crealization\u201d that we are already Buddha. The Buddha\nnature is your self-nature\u2014again exemplifying the Neo-Daoist\n\u201cSage within, King without\u201d spirit.\n\nDaoist simplicity stimulated Chan\u2019s abandonment of Buddhist\ntheory and was accompanied by another traditional Daoist\nfeature\u2014the emphasis on total absorption in practice of a highly\ncultivated skill. Chinese Zen was dominated by the notion of\n\u201csudden enlightenment\u201d which consists of the denial that\nany process leads anyone closer to the Buddha-nature. You can\u2019t get\nany closer\u2014you\u2019re just there. Pay attention! \n",
