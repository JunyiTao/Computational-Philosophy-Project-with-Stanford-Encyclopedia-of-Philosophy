    "main_text": "The Fall\n5. The Fall\n\nWe have been exploring one of the most interesting and perplexing\naspects of Camus\u2019s thought: his determination to criticize\nattitudes that he finds to be natural and inevitable. For one, the\npossibility of suicide haunts humans, and so does the desire for an\nimpossible order and an unachievable permanence. Existentialist\nwriters had similar insights, but Camus criticizes their inability to\nremain consistent with their initial insight. Similarly, he insists\nthroughout The Rebel that the metaphysical need he sees\nleading to Communism\u2019s terror is universal: he describes it and\nits consequences so that we can better resist it in ourselves as well\nas others. His reflexive anti-Communism notwithstanding, an underlying\nsympathy unites Camus to those revolutionaries he opposes, because he\nfreely acknowledges that he and they share the same starting points,\noutlook, stresses, temptations, and pitfalls. Although in political\nargument he frequently took refuge in a tone of moral superiority,\nCamus makes clear through his skepticism that those he disagrees with\nare no less and no more than fellow creatures who give in to the same\nfundamental drive to escape the absurdity that we all share. This\nsense of moral complexity is most eloquent in his short novel The\nFall, whose single character, Clamence, has been variously\nidentified as everyman, a Camus-character, and a Sartre-character. He\nwas all of these. Clamence is clearly evil, guilty of standing by as a\nyoung woman commits suicide. In him Camus seeks to describe and indict\nhis generation, including both his enemies and himself.\nClamence\u2019s life is filled with good works, but he is a hypocrite\nand knows it. His monologue is filled with self-justification as well\nas the confession of someone torn apart by his guilt but unable to\nfully acknowledge it. Sitting at a bar in Amsterdam, he descends into\nhis own personal hell, inviting the reader to follow him. In telling\nClamence\u2019s story, Camus was clearly seeking to empathize as well\nas describe, to understand as well as condemn. Clamence is a monster,\nbut Clamence is also just another human being (Aronson 2004,\n192\u2013200). Beyond the character and actions of Clamence, The\nFall demonstrates a unique message at the heart of Camus\u2019s\nwriting. Life is no one single, simple thing, but a series of tensions\nand dilemmas. The most seemingly straightforward features of life are\nin fact ambiguous and even contradictory. Camus recommends that we\navoid trying to resolve them. We need to face the fact that we can\nnever successfully purge ourselves of the impulses that threaten to\nwreak havoc with our lives. Camus\u2019s philosophy, if it has a\nsingle meaning, is that we should learn to tolerate, indeed embrace\nthe frustration and ambivalence that humans cannot escape.\n",
