    "main_text": "Epistemic Utility Arguments concerning Outright Beliefs || Updating your beliefs when you receive evidence\n4.4 Updating your beliefs when you receive evidence\n\nAll the norms we have considered so far in this entry have been\nsynchronic: that is, they say what rationality requires of your\nbeliefs at a given time. In this section, we turn to diachronic norms:\nthese say what rationality requires of the relationship between your\nbeliefs at one time and your beliefs at another, typically when you\nlearn some evidence between those times. We\u2019ll look at two sets\nof norms for belief updating: AGM belief revision\n (Section 4.4.1)\n and Plan Lockean Revision\n (Section 4.4.2).\n4.4.1 AGM belief revision\n\nAGM belief revision is a set of putative norms that govern full\nbeliefs introduced by Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors,\nand David Makinson (1985); it includes both synchronic and diachronic\nnorms (see entry on\n the logic of belief revision).\n The synchronic norms are these, and they apply both before and after\nyou acquire new evidence:\n\n\nConsistency If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is an inconsistent set\nof finitely many propositions, then you should not believe each\nproposition in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).\n\nClosure If \\(X\\) is a logical consequence of the\npropositions in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), then you should not believe each\nproposition in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) while not believing \\(X\\).\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen that we cannot give an argument for either of\nthese from the point of view of epistemic utility. But perhaps we can\ndo better with the diachronic norms. These norms govern a belief\nupdating operator \\(\\star\\), which takes your belief set\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), together with a proposition \\(E\\) that gives the\nevidence you learn, and returns \\(\\mathbf{B} \\star E\\), which is your\nnew belief set after you learn \\(E\\). The AGM postulates state that\nthe following are required by rationality:\n\n\nSuccess \\(E\\) is in \\(\\mathbf{B} \\star E\\). That is,\nafter learning a proposition, you should believe it.\n\nInclusion \\(\\mathbf{B} \\star E \\subseteq\n\\mathsf{Cn}(\\mathbf{B} \\cup \\{E\\})\\), where \\(\\mathsf{Cn}\\) takes a\nset of propositions and returns its logical closure. That is, you\nshould believe a proposition after learning only if it is a logical\nconsequence of what previously believed and the proposition you\nlearn.\n\nPreservation If \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(E\\) are\nconsistent, then \\(\\mathbf{B} \\subseteq \\mathbf{B} \\star E\\). That is,\nif what you learn is consistent with what you previously believed, you\nshouldn\u2019t drop your belief in anything you previously believed\nwhen you learn.\n\nExtensionality If \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are logically\nequivalent, then \\(\\mathbf{B} \\star E = \\mathbf{B} \\star F\\). That is,\nlearning either of two logically equivalent propositions should change\nyour beliefs in the same way.\n\n\nAs Shear and Fitelson (2019) show, we can justify\n Success,\n Inclusion, and\n Extensionality\n by appealing to\n Maximize Expected Epistemic Utility.\n To do this, we note that, as we\u2019ll justify in\n Section 5.3,\n there is a standard norm that is taken to govern how we should update\nour credences in response to new evidence. It\u2019s called\nConditionalization and it says that, if you assign positive credence\nto a proposition \\(E\\) and then learn \\(E\\) for sure as evidence, then\nyour new credence in a proposition \\(X\\) should be your old\nconditional credence in \\(X\\) given \\(E\\), where that is defined to be\nthe ratio of your credence in the conjunction of \\(X\\) and \\(E\\) to\nyour credence in \\(E\\) alone; or, in other words, it\u2019s the\nproportion of your old credence in \\(E\\) that you also assigned to\n\\(X\\). So you might think that (i) you should set your original\ncredences by maximising expected utility with respect to your original\ncredences, and (ii) set your new credences after learning evidence by\nmaximising expected utility with respect to your new credences, which\nare obtained from your old ones by updating on your evidence in line\nwith Conditionalization. Doing this secures\n Success,\n Inclusion, and\n Extensionality.\n It doesn\u2019t secure\n Preservation\n because learning a new proposition that is consistent with all the\npropositions to which you assigned credence higher than some threshold\ncan lead you to drop your credence in one of those propositions below\nthat threshold.\n4.4.2 Almost Lockean Completeness for Updating Plans\n\nPatrick Rooyakkers (ms) has extended Rothschild\u2019s argument for\nthe Lockean Thesis so that it establishes a version of Almost Lockean\nCompleteness but for combinations of belief sets and updating plans.\nThe idea is this: Suppose you\u2019re about to learn some new\nevidence. You don\u2019t know what it is, but you know it will be one\nof the propositions \\(E_1, \\ldots, E_k\\), which together form a\npartition\u2014that is, the propositions are exhaustive and mutually\nexclusive. Then, as well as your prior belief set, which we\u2019ll\ncall \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), you should have an updating plan in place for how\nyou\u2019ll respond to each of the possible pieces of evidence you\nmight receive; for each \\(E_i\\), this should give the belief set\n\\(\\beta_{E_i}\\) you plan to have if \\(E_i\\) is the proposition you\nlearn. Then the following norm governs this plan:\n\n\nAlmost Lockean Completeness for Plans with threshold\n\\(t\\) Rationality requires that there is a probabilistic\ncredence function such that:\n\nIf the unconditional credence it assigns to \\(X\\) is greater than\n\\(t\\), then \\(X\\) is in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\); if it is less than \\(t\\), then\n\\(X\\) is not in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\); \nFor each \\(E_i\\), if the conditional credence it assigns to \\(X\\)\ngiven \\(E_i\\) is greater than \\(t\\), then \\(X\\) is in \\(\\beta_{E_i}\\);\nif it is less than \\(t\\), then \\(X\\) is not in \\(\\beta_{E_i}\\).\n\n\n\nThat is, you are required to obey the Lockean Thesis with a particular\nthreshold and some probabilistic credence function before you acquire\nthe new evidence, and obey it with respect to some unconditional\ncredences; and you are required to plan to obey it with the same\nthreshold after you\u2019ve received the evidence, and obey it then\nwith respect to the conditional credences given the evidence you\nlearn.\n\nRooyakkers\u2019 argument has the same form as Rothschild\u2019s. He\nproves the following on the assumption that the epistemic utility at a\nworld of a pair consisting of a prior belief set and a belief plan\nshould be the sum of the epistemic utility of the prior belief set at\nthat world and the epistemic utility of the posterior belief set that\nthe plan endorses if you learn the proposition in the partition that\nis true at that world:\n\n\nDominance Theorem for Almost Lockean Completeness for Plans\n(Rooyakkers ms) A prior belief set and a belief plan together\nsatisfy Almost Lockean Completeness for Plans iff there is no set of\nepistemic utilities with uniform ratio under which the pair is\nstrongly dominated.\n\n",
