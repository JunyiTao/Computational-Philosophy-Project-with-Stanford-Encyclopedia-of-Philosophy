For example, the logical\nreconstruction of the various branches of geometry still needed to be\ncompleted and published. In fact, it was Whitehead\u2019s task to do\nso by producing a fourth Principia Mathematica volume.\nHowever, this volume never saw the light of day. What Whitehead did\npublish were his repeated attempts to logically reconstruct the\ngeometry of space and time, hence extending the logicism project from\npure mathematics to applied mathematics or, put differently, from\nmathematics to physics\u2014an extension which Russell greeted with\nenthusiasm and saw as an important step in the deployment of his new\nphilosophical method of logical analysis.\n\nAt first, Whitehead focused on the geometry of space.\n\nWhen Whitehead and Russell logicized the concept of number, their\nstarting point was our intuition of equinumerous classes of\nindividuals\u2014for example, our recognition that the class of\ndwarfs in the fairy tale of Snow White (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy,\nBashful, Sneezy, Dopey) and the class of days in a week (from Monday\nto Sunday) have \u2018something\u2019 in common, namely, the\nsomething we call \u2018seven.\u2019 Then they logically defined (i)\nclasses C and C\u2032 to be equinumerous when there is a one-to-one\nrelation that correlates each of the members of C with one member of\nC\u2032, and (ii) the number of a class C as the class of all the\nclasses that are equinumerous with C.\n\nWhen Whitehead logicized the space of physics, his starting point was\nour intuition of spatial volumes and of how one volume may contain (or\nextend over) another, giving rise to the (mereo)logical relation of\ncontainment (or extension) in the class of volumes, and to the concept\nof converging series of volumes\u2014think, for example, of a series\nof Russian dolls, one contained in the other, but idealized to ever\nsmaller dolls. Whitehead made all this rigorous and then, crudely put,\ndefined the points from which to further construct the geometry of\nspace.\n\nThere is a striking resemblance between Whitehead\u2019s construction\nof points and the construction of real numbers by Georg Cantor, who\nhad been one of Whitehead and Russell\u2019s main sources of\ninspiration next to Peano. Indeed, Whitehead defined points as\nequivalence classes of converging series of volumes, and Cantor\ndefined real numbers as equivalence classes of converging series of\nrational numbers. Moreover, because Whitehead\u2019s basic\ngeometrical entities of geometry are not (as in Euclid) extensionless\npoints but volumes, Whitehead can be seen as one of the fathers of\npoint-free geometry; and because Whitehead\u2019s basic geometrical\nrelation is the mereological (or part-whole) relation of extension, he\ncan also be seen as one of the founders of mereology (and even, when\nwe take into account his later work on this topic in part IV of\nProcess and Reality, of mereotopology).\n\n\u201cLast night\u201d, Whitehead wrote to Russell on 3 September\n1911,\n\n\nthe idea suddenly flashed on me that time could be treated in exactly\nthe same way as I have now got space (which is a picture of beauty, by\nthe bye). (Unpublished letter kept in The Bertrand Russell Archives at\nMcMaster University)\n\n\nShortly after, Whitehead must have learned about Einstein\u2019s\nSpecial Theory of Relativity (STR) because in a letter to Wildon Carr\non 10 July 1912, Russell suggested to the Honorary Secretary of the\nAristotelian Society that Whitehead possibly might deliver a paper on\nthe principle of relativity, and added: \u201cI know he has been\ngoing into the subject\u201d. Anyhow, in the early years of the\nsecond decade of the twentieth century, Whitehead\u2019s interest\nshifted from the logical reconstruction of the Euclidean space of\nclassical physics to the logical reconstruction of the Minkowskian\nspace-time of the STR.\n\nA first step to go from space to space-time was the replacement of\n(our intuition of) spatial volumes with (our intuition of)\nspatio-temporal regions (or events) as the basis of the construction\n(so that, for example, a point of space-time could be defined as an\nequivalence class of converging spatio-temporal regions). However,\nwhereas Whitehead had constructed the Euclidean distance based on our\nintuition of cases of spatial congruence (for example, of two parallel\nstraight line segments being equally long), he now struggled to\nconstruct the Minkowskian metric in terms of a concept of\nspatio-temporal congruence, based on a kind of merger of our intuition\nof cases of spatial congruence and our intuition of cases of temporal\ncongruence (for example, of two candles taking equally long to burn\nout).\n\nSo, as a second step, Whitehead introduced a second relation in the\nclass of spatio-temporal regions next to the relation of extension,\nnamely, the relation of cogredience, based on our intuition of rest or\nmotion. Whitehead\u2019s use of this relation gave rise to a constant\nk, which allowed him to merge spatial and temporal\ncongruence, and which appeared in his formula for the metric of\nspace-time. When Whitehead equated k with\nc2 (the square of the speed of light) his metric\nbecame equal to the Minkowskian metric.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s most detailed account of this reconstruction of the\nMinkowskian space-time of the STR was given in his 1919 book, An\nEnquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, but he\nalso offered a less technical account in his 1920 book, The\nConcept of Nature.\n\nWhitehead first learned about Einstein\u2019s General Theory of\nRelativity (GTR) in 1916. He admired Einstein\u2019s new mathematical\ntheory of gravitation, but rejected Einstein\u2019s explanation of\ngravitation for not being coherent with some of our basic intuitions.\nEinstein explained the gravitational motion of a free mass-particle in\nthe neighborhood of a heavy mass as due to the curvature of space-time\ncaused by this mass. According to Whitehead, the theoretical concept\nof a contingently curved space-time does not cohere with our\nmeasurement practices; they are based on the essential uniformity of\nthe texture of our spatial and temporal intuition.\n\nIn general, Whitehead opposed the modern scientist\u2019s attitude of\ndropping the requirement of coherence with our basic intuitions, and\nhe revolted against the issuing bifurcation of nature into the world\nof science and that of intuition. In particular, as Einstein\u2019s\ncritic, he set out to give an alternative rendering of the\nGTR\u2014an alternative that passed not only what Whitehead called\n\u201cthe narrow gauge\u201d, which tests a theory\u2019s empirical\nadequacy, but also what he called \u201cthe broad gauge\u201d, which\ntests its coherence with our basic intuitions.\n\nIn 1920, first in a newspaper article (reprinted in Essays in\nScience and Philosophy), and then in a lecture (published as\nChapter VIII of Concept of Nature), Whitehead made public an\noutline of his alternative to Einstein\u2019s GTR. In 1921, Whitehead\nhad the opportunity to discuss matters with Einstein himself. And\nfinally, in 1922, Whitehead published a book with a more detailed\naccount of his alternative theory of gravitation (ATG)\u2014The\nPrinciple of Relativity.\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electrodynamics\n(unlike Einstein\u2019s GTR) could be conceived as coherent with our\nbasic intuitions\u2014even in its four-dimensional format, namely, by\nelaborating Minkowski\u2019s electromagnetic worldview. Hence,\nWhitehead developed his ATG in close analogy with the theory of\nelectrodynamics. He replaced Einstein\u2019s geometric explanation\nwith an electrodynamics-like explanation. Whitehead explained the\ngravitational motion of a free mass-particle as due to a field action\ndetermined by retarded wave-potentials propagating in a uniform\nspace-time from the source masses to the free mass-particle.\n\nIt is important to stress that Whitehead had no intention of improving\nthe predictive content of Einstein\u2019s GTR, only the explanatory\ncontent. However, Whitehead\u2019s replacement of Einstein\u2019s\nexplanation with an alternative explanation entailed a replacement of\nEinstein\u2019s formulae with alternative formulae; and these\ndifferent formulae implied different predictions. So it would be\nincorrect to say that Whitehead\u2019s ATG is empirically equivalent\nto Einstein\u2019s GTR. What can be claimed, however, is that for a\nlong time Whitehead\u2019s theory was experimentally\nindistinguishable from Einstein\u2019s theory.\n\nIn fact, like Einstein\u2019s GTR, Whitehead\u2019s ATG leads to\nNewton\u2019s theory of gravitation as a first approximation. Also\n(as shown by Eddington in 1924 and J. L. Synge in 1952)\nEinstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s theories of gravitation lead to\nan identical solution for the problem of determining the gravitational\nfield of a single, static, and spherically symmetric body\u2014the\nSchwarzschild solution. This implies, for example, that\nEinstein\u2019s GTR and Whitehead\u2019s ATG lead to the exact same\npredictions not only with respect to the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury and the bending of starlight in the gravitational field of\nthe sun (as already shown by Whitehead in 1922 and William Temple in\n1924) but also with respect to the red-shift of the spectral lines of\nlight emitted by atoms in the gravitational field of the sun (contrary\nto Whitehead\u2019s own conclusion in 1922, which was based on a\nhighly schematized and soon outdated model of the molecule). Moreover\n(as shown by R. J. Russell and Christoph Wassermann in 1986 and\npublished in 2004) Einstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s theories of\ngravitation also lead to an identical solution for the problem of\ndetermining the gravitational field of a single, rotating, and axially\nsymmetric body\u2014the Kerr solution.\n\nEinstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s predictions become different,\nhowever, when considering more than one body. Indeed, Einstein\u2019s\nequation of gravitation is non-linear while Whitehead\u2019s is\nlinear; and this divergence qua mathematics implies a\ndivergence qua predictions in the case of two or more bodies.\nFor example (as shown by G. L. Clark in 1954) the two theories lead to\ndifferent predictions with respect to the motion of double stars. The\npredictive divergence in the case of two bodies, however, is quite\nsmall, and until recently experimental techniques were not\nsufficiently refined to confirm either Einstein\u2019s predictions or\nWhitehead\u2019s, for example, with respect to double stars. In 2008,\nbased on a precise timing of the pulsar B1913+16 in the Hulse-Taylor\nbinary system, Einstein\u2019s predictions with respect to the motion\nof double stars were confirmed, and Whitehead\u2019s refuted (by Gary\nGibbons and Clifford Will). The important fact from the viewpoint of\nthe philosophy of science is not that, since the 1970s, now and again,\na physicist rose to claim the experimental refutation of\nWhitehead\u2019s ATG, but that for decades it was experimentally\nindistinguishable from Einstein\u2019s GTR, hence refuting two modern\ndogmas. First, that theory choice is solely based on empirical facts.\nClearly, next to facts, values\u2014especially aesthetic\nvalues\u2014are at play as well. Second, that the history of science\nis a succession of victories over the army of our misleading\nintuitions, each success of science must be interpreted as a defeat of\nintuition, and a truth cannot be scientific unless it hurts human\nintuition. Surely, we can be scientific without taming the authority\nof our intuition and without engaging in the disastrous race to\ndisenchant nature and humankind.\n\nFor a more detailed account of Whitehead\u2019s involvement with\nEinstein\u2019s STR and GTR, cf. Palter 1960, Von Ranke 1997,\nHerstein 2006 and Desmet 2011, 2016b, and 2016c.\n\nIn 1925, in one of his Lowell lectures (published as Chapter VIII of\nScience and the Modern World), Whitehead made public a\npopular outline of his alternative to Bohr\u2019s solar system view of\nmaterial atoms, but he never published a more detailed\nand technical account of this alternative quantum theory (AQT).\nWhitehead called his AQT, \u2018the theory of primates.\u2019 In it,\nprimates are not apes, of course, but standing\n(or stationary) electromagnetic waves (or vibrations).\nThese waves are different from the\ntraveling electromagnetic waves outside atoms. They\nare not light waves, but standing waves of charge density\ninside atoms, in fact, constituting atoms.\n\nWhitehead was up to date with respect to the old quantum\nmechanics of Planck, Einstein and Bohr. He was as familiar with\nJeans\u2019 Report on Radiation and the Quantum-Theory\n(1914) as with Eddington\u2019s Report on the Relativity Theory\nof Gravitation (1918). And prior to his departure to\nHarvard, on 12 July 1924, Whitehead chaired a\nsymposium\u2014\u201cThe Quantum Theory: How far does it modify the\nmathematical, the physical, and the psychological concepts of\ncontinuity?\u201d\u2014which was part of a joint session of the\nAristotelian Society and the Mind Society. Unfortunately, he did not\nhimself deliver a lecture at that symposium, and the most technical\naccount of his AQT can be found in the student notes of lectures\nWhitehead gave at Harvard, especially in the fall semester of the\nacademic year 1924\u20131925. Whitehead\u2019s lectures, however, were not\nclear-cut presentations, but instances of philosophy in the making.\nMoreover, his philosophy students lacked the necessary knowledge\nof mathematical physics to fully comprehend Whitehead when he\ntalked physics. Consequently, the student notes of Whitehead\u2019s Harvard\nlectures dealing with quantum theory are low quality notes. Ronny\nDesmet, however, has made a first attempt to correct some of the\nmistakes and to reconstruct Whitehead\u2019s AQT in his 2020 paper,\n\u201cWhitehead\u2019s Highly Speculative Lectures on Quantum Theory\u201d\n(Henning & Petek 2020: 154\u2013181), and in his 2022 paper,\n\u201cWhitehead\u2019s 1925 View of Function and Time\u201d (to be published).\n\nIn his AQT, Whitehead conceived of all electrons\nand protons as compositions of standing electromagnetic\nwaves of charge density, which he called \u2018primates\u2019 or \u2018primordial\nelements.\u2019 In Science and the Modern World, Whitehead wrote:\n\u201cWe shall conceive each primordial element as a vibratory ebb and flow\nof an underlying energy, or activity\u201d (1925 [1967: 35]).\nWhen a material atom emits energy, one of\nits composing standing electromagnetic waves\nis transformed into a travelling electromagnetic wave, that is,\ninto light. The energy emitted by an atom is the energy of the\nemitted light, and the action of the emitted light is the product\nof its energy and its period (which is the inverse of its frequency).\nExperiment had revealed that the amounts of energy\nand action of atomic light emission do not form\na continuous, but a discrete spectrum; they are quantized\nphysical variables. In fact, a smallest amount of action\nexists, the quantum of action, given by Planck\u2019s\nconstant, and all measured amounts of action\nof atomic light emission are integer multiples of\nthis quantum of action. Whitehead conceived of electrons and\nprotons as composed of standing electromagnetic waves of\nwhich the action is also always a multiple of the\nquantum of action. And as he conceived of the atomic energy\nemission as a transformation of these standing into traveling\nelectromagnetic waves, it became clear to him that\nthis emission actually involves the decay of\na primate, and that the loss of the\nprimate\u2019s quantized energy and action explains why the\nemitted light has similarly quantized energy and\naction.\n\nContrary to his ATG, Whitehead\u2019s AQT soon became obsolete.\nExperiments revealed that there are more elementary\nparticles than electrons and protons. And, of course, the\nnew quantum mechanics (of Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli,\nand many others) emerged. As Whitehead focused on philosophy\nwhen at Harvard, his knowledge of physics began to be out of\ndate. His own theory, however, showed some similarities with the new\nquantum mechanics. Whitehead\u2019s standing electromagnetic waves, in a\nsense, foreshadowed Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave mechanics. And\nwhereas the discovery of the quantum of action was the\n\u201cphysicist\u2019s nightmare\u201d (Whitehead 2021:93), Whitehead was happy with\nthe increasing importance of the notion of \u2018action\u2019 in\nphysics. Action is an activity through time, and hence\nconfirms Whitehead\u2019s idea that processes, and\nnot instantaneous configurations of inactive masses, are\nfundamental in nature. Moreover, since there is a minimum quantum\nof action, Whitehead interpreted the equation, action\nequals the product of energy and period (which is a duration), by\nsaying: \u201cconcentration of time increases energy\u201d (2021: 93). This\nstatement of Whitehead, in a sense, foreshadowed Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle with respect to energy and time, which was\nformulated two years later. As his AQT thus foreshadowed the new\nquantum mechanics in two respects, one wonders what he thought of this\nnew theory when it emerged. Charles Hartshorne wrote that\nWhitehead definitely saw \u201cHeisenberg\u2019s famous article of 1927 on the\nUncertainty Principle\u201d (2010: 28). Hartshorne was sure about this,\nbecause it was he himself who showed it to Whitehead. But\nthere is (as yet) no evidence that Whitehead seriously studied\nthis paper in particular, or the new quantum mechanics in general.\n\nWhitehead said to his students: \u201cA definite creative act is looked on\nas handing over to physics the ultimate unit\u201d (2021: 41), where the\nultimate unit is Planck\u2019s constant, or, in other words, the quantum of\naction. Clearly, Whitehead thought of the quantum of action\nas an abstract aspect of his ultimate metaphysical building\nblocks, his elementary creative acts or \u2018actual\noccasions,\u2019 and his AQT, like the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of\nelectrodynamics and Whitehead\u2019s ATG, were still at the back of\nhis mind when he developed his metaphysics at Harvard. This may\nwell be the reason why his metaphysics\u2014his process philosophy\u2014has\nbeen conceived by many authors as an interesting framework to\nontologically interpret the mathematical formalism of quantum\nmechanics. And even authors who are not directly inspired by\nWhitehead, often come up with interpretations of quantum\nmechanics that are strikingly Whiteheadian. A good and recent example\nis Carlo Rovelli\u2019s relational interpretation. Rovelli writes:\n\n\nIn the world described by quantum mechanics there is no reality except\nin the relations between physical systems. It isn\u2019t things that\nenter into relations but, rather, relations that ground the notion of\n\u201cthing\u201d. The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of\nobjects: it is a world of events. Things are built by the happenings\nof elementary events: as the philosopher Nelson Goodman wrote in the\n1950s, in a beautiful phrase, \u201cAn object is a monotonous\nprocess.\u201d A stone is a vibration of quanta that maintains its\nstructure for a while, just as a marine wave maintains its identity\nfor a while before melting again into the sea. \u2026 We, like waves\nand like all objects, are a flux of events; we are processes, for a\nbrief time monotonous \u2026 (2017: 115\u2013116)\n\n\nAnd Rovelli adds that in the speculative world of quantum gravity:\n\n\nThere is no longer space which contains the world, and no\nlonger time during the course of which events occur. There\nare elementary processes \u2026 continuously interact[ing] with each\nother. Just as a calm and clear Alpine lake is made up of a rapid\ndance of a myriad of minuscule water molecules, the illusion of being\nsurrounded by continuous space and time is the product of a\nlong-sighted vision of a dense swarming of elementary processes.\n(2017: 158)\n\n",
