    "main_text": "Ammonius as Aristotelian Commentator\n2. Ammonius as Aristotelian Commentator\n\nAmmonius established the tradition of Aristotelian commentary in\nAlexandria. He was followed in this by his students Asclepius,\nPhiloponus (ca. 490\u2013570), Simplicius (writing after 529 after\nmoving to the Athenian school and moving with it from Athens to Persia\nafter the school\u2019s closure under Justinian), and Olympiodorus\n(495/505-after 565). The tradition continues through the Christian\ncommentators Elias (probably a pupil of Olympiodorus), David,\nPs.-Elias and Stephanus (fl. ca. 610).\n\nDamascius commented that Ammonius, who explicated works of both Plato\nand Aristotle, was more practiced in the latter (Life of\nIsidore 57C). The Christian character in Zacharias\u2019\ndialogue (562\u2013565) accuses Ammonius\u2019 star pupil Gesius and his\ncomrades, presumably including Ammonius, of being accustomed to refute\nPlato\u2019s doctrines, while claiming to be his pupils and wanting\nto be called \u2018Platonists\u2019; he also uses a literal\ninterpretation of the cosmogony in Plato\u2019s Timaeus to\ncounter the Aristotelian doctrine of the world\u2019s co-eternity\nwith God espoused by the dialogue\u2019s \u2018Ammonius\u2019\ncharacter. Still, Ammonius did lecture on Platonic texts. He is cited\nby name nine times in his student Olympiodorus\u2019 commentary on\nthe Gorgias, three times on the Phaedo, and not at\nall on Alcibiades I; the differences probably reflect the\nfact that for the Gorgias Olympiodorus could rely less on a\nprevious tradition of Neoplatonic interpretation. In all cases, he is\ncited with the greatest respect. \n\nThe most substantive comment cited by Olympiodorus from\nAmmonius\u2019 lectures on the Gorgias (\u00a732,2\u20133)\nis a defense of the four democratic politicians Socrates declines to\ncall statesmen (499b\u2013503c); Ammonius says they are practitioners\nof the \u2018intermediate\u2019 rhetoric, rather than of the false\nkind. He draws his explanation from the Republic (425c-427a),\nwhere he distinguishes three kinds of physician: the false kind that\ngives prescriptions aimed at flattery and pleasing the patient, the\ntrue kind that insists the patient do what is best for him, and the\nintermediate kind that gives the patient a true prescription but does\nnot insist that he follow it. In this explanation, Ammonius follows\nthe lead of his father Hermeias, who cited (in Phdr. p.\n231,26\u2013232,14 Lucarini-Moreschini) this passage of the\nGorgias in his explanation of Phaedrus 260d as\nreferring to true, popular, and intermediate rhetoric and the\ndifferent kinds of therapy of the masses they apply. Ammonius\u2019\nlectures on Plato seem to have been enlivened by wit and personal\nremarks, some apparently cited as apophthegms from the great teacher.\nSocrates (Gorgias 513a) warns Callicles against assimilating\nhimself to the current Athenian d\u0113mos, thereby\nattaining power but perhaps losing all he holds dear. Such\nassimilation, Olympiodorus says, destroys one\u2019s soul utterly;\nthe proper object to which one should assimilate one\u2019s soul is\nthe cosmos, that is, God. Like the Thessalian witches mentioned by\nSocrates, nowadays too the Egyptian magicians claim to have the power\nto \u2018draw down the moon\u2019 and run such risk of destruction,\nif they fail. Olympiodorus notes that we must not believe these\nmythical stories, though most people are deceived by them: this is\nsimply an eclipse; similarly, even now they say that there are\nmagicians in Egypt who can change men into crocodiles, asses, or any\nshape they like\u2014but one must not believe it. Indeed, Ammonius\ntold them, in his exegesis, \u201cthis experience overpowered me too,\nand when I was a boy I used to believe these things were true\u201d\n(in Gorg. \u00a739,2). Known for astronomical expertise,\nAmmonius was chiding his credulous audience. Another remark of\nAmmonius\u2019 is cited in Olympiodorus\u2019 argument that the myth\nat the end of the Gorgias that emphasizes the judgement of\nour souls in the underworld over that of judges in our present life\nshows that our actions derive from our own souls\u2019 autonomy.\nOlympiodorus notes (\u00a748,5) that it is up to us to choose virtue\nor vice and that there is no place for astrology, which would nullify\nforesight, law, and justice: \u201cAmmonius the philosopher says\n\u2018I know some men who have the astrological horoscope of\nadulterers, yet are temperate, since the self-moving nature of the\nsoul dominates\u2019\u201d. Again, Ammonius does not deny the\ninfluence of the stars in our lives, but insists that our individual\nchoice plays an overriding role. Explaining that aristocracy is the\nbest government, Olympiodorus (\u00a742,1\u20132) likens the city to\nthe cosmos, ruled best by God, citing the Homeric line so favored by\nAristotle (Metaphysics 12.10, 1076a4) and his Neoplatonic\nexegetes: \u201cRule of many is not good: let there be one\nchief!\u201d. If someone objects that this is rather monarchy than\naristocracy, respond with Ammonius: \u201cKeep silent; let him have\nyour fist\u201d! \n\nIn his lectures on Aristotle, Ammonius was heavily indebted to his\nteacher Proclus, even if he disagreed with him on some important\npoints. The introduction to his in Int. makes Ammonius\u2019\ngreat debt to Proclus clear: \u201cNow, we have recorded the\ninterpretations of our divine teacher Proclus, successor to the chair\nof Plato and a man who attained the limits of human capacity both in\nthe ability to interpret the opinions of the ancients and in the\nscientific judgment of the nature of reality. If, having done that, we\ntoo are able to add anything to the clarification of the book, we owe\ngreat thanks to the god of eloquence\u201d (1,6\u201311; cf. in\nAn. Pr. 43,30, with a citation of Proclus\u2019 School\nCommentary [skholikon hupomn\u0113ma]). Proclus, in\nturn, often used Iamblichus (see, e.g., in An. Pr. 40,16). In\naddition, Ammonius used other commentators. For example in his in\nInt., most of his material comes from Proclus\u2019 lectures,\nbut Ammonius has polished up what he had in his notes of those\nlectures, then added material of his own or from other sources. In\nthis case, Ammonius\u2019 main source for supplementing\nProclus\u2019 lectures was apparently the now lost voluminous\ncommentary (see Stephanus in Int. 63,9) of Porphyry, which\nwas also the major source of Boethius\u2019 commentary on De\nInt. and probably also of Ammonius\u2019 citations of earlier\nauthors, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias (active late 2nd\nto early 3rd century), Aspasius (first half of\n2nd century), Herminus\u2019 (2nd C.), and the\nStoics. Both Porphyry and Proclus held Int. c. 14 to be\nspurious (252,10 ff.). Although Ammonius agreed, unlike them he\ndecided to include commentary on the chapter, which he repeats\n\u2018verbatim\u2019 from Syrianus, having nothing of his own to add\n(254,22\u201331; cf. 253,12).\n\nThe sources on which Ammonius drew and his mode of using them will\nlikely have varied according to the nature of the previous\ncommentaries he could work with for each text. In Asclepius\u2019\npublished version of Ammonius\u2019 lectures, for example, we see a\nvery different procedure from the one Ammonius followed in writing out\nhis own commentary on De Interpretatione and basing it on\nProclus\u2019 lectures. It is difficult to say to what extent\nAsclepius\u2019 commentary on Metaphysics A\u2013Z is\neither a reflection or a more thorough reworking of Ammonius\u2019\nlectures. Still, this work is reasonably thought to give the best\nrepresentation we have of the lectures themselves, copied down by\nAmmonius\u2019 student \u2018from the voice\u2019 of the master.\nIndications of the commentary\u2019s origin in the lectures abound\n(cf. Luna 2001, 100\u2013103): the explanation of a passage often\nbegins by referring to \u201cwhat was said yesterday\u201d (e.g.,\n3,13; 433,18\u201319); we are told that \u201cthe teacher of\nmedicine Asclepius, who studied with us at these lessons\u201d raised\na question, and \u201cour professor of philosophy\u201d answered him\n(143,31 ff.). That faithful transcription of lectures was practiced\nand thus could have formed the basis of a later reworking for\npublication is implied by Damascius\u2019 story (45A) about\nTheosebius, who compared his own transcripts of lectures on the\nGorgias given at two different times by his master Hierocles\nand found nothing repeated between the two versions, \u201ceach of\nwhich, however improbable it is to hear, hewed as much as possible to\nthe intention of Plato\u201d. \n\nIn Asclepius of Tralles\u2019 commentary on Metaphysics A-Z\nthere are two voices: the Peripatetic voice of Aristotle and Alexander\nof Aphrodisias and the Neoplatonic voice of Syrianus and Ammonius.\nAsclepius begins with a lemma taken from Aristotle, sometimes\nparaphrases it, and explains its philosophical significance; then, if\nnecessary, he explains why Aristotle was wrong, saying that \u201cwe,\non the other hand, say\u201d or \u201cagainst this we say\u201d or\n\u201cour teacher of philosophy Ammonius says\u201d, or else why\nAristotle appears wrong but really agrees with Plato. Next, he\nexplains the Aristotelian text itself, usually taking the explanation\nfrom Alexander, either word-for-word or in paraphrase; occasionally,\nhe appears to have drawn his paraphrase of Alexander from Syrianus.\nAsclepius\u2019 commentary and, presumably, Ammonius\u2019 lectures,\nthen, combine the inheritance of Alexander and of Syrianus, a move in\nkeeping with the opinion of Syrianus himself, who introduced his\ncommentary on Metaphysics \u0393 saying (54,11\u201315):\n\u201c[Aristotle] will attempt to teach [these things] in this book,\nwhich, since it has been made sufficiently clear by the very\nhardworking Alexander, we will not interpret in its entirety. But if\nhe seems to us to say something that is troublesome [and requiring]\nscrutiny, that part we will try to examine, summarizing all the rest\nfor the sake of the treatise\u2019s coherence.\u201d The commentary\non Metaphysics A, closely studied by Cardullo (2012),\nprovides numerous clear examples of Asclepius\u2019\u2014i.e.,\nAmmonius\u2019\u2014procedures. Thus, in explaining the famous\ndeclaration of all men\u2019s desire for knowledge in the opening\nsentence of the Metaphysics, Ammonius goes through a number\nof different types of knowledge, following Aristotle, ending with art,\nwhich is superior to experience, since it knows the\n\u2018why\u2019 and not just the\n\u2018that\u2019: \u201cHence Plato says of the divine\nmind \u2018I do not call art that which is an irrational\nthing\u2019\u201d. With this reference to Gorgias 465a6,\nAsclepius-Ammonius cites (28,3\u20136 on Metaph. 984b1) a\nPlatonic argument in explanation of an Aristotelian one to show their\nclose relation. Later, Asclepius attributes Aristotle\u2019s argument\nthat wisdom is chosen for itself, not for the sake of something else,\nto Plato (20,15\u201316; cf. Cardullo 2012, 266 n. 391). In another\ninstance of this kind of association, Asclepius comments that\n\u201cit is good that sensible things exist: even pitch is necessary\nfor the perfection of the cosmos, and \u2018it is unjust to leave\nsuch a great matter to chance or luck\u2019, but only to God, who has\ncreated everything because of his own goodness\u201d. That the\nreference is to the Demiurge of the Timaeus (29e) is evident\nfrom the emphasis on the creator\u2019s goodness, and the producing\ncause is here connected with the Unmoved Mover, which is a final cause\ndue to its goodness (Cardullo 2012, 294 n. 488). \n\nFrom Ammonius\u2019 version of the list of ten preliminary topics\nrecommended by Proclus for those beginning to study Aristotle (cf.\nElias, in Cat. 107,24\u201327), we know that the study of\nAristotle in Ammonius\u2019 school began with logic, then moved on to\nethics, physics, mathematics, and theology (Ammonius, in Cat.\n5,31\u20136,8). Ammonius also introduced as a new set a sequence of\nlessons introductory to the study of Aristotle consisting of: an\nintroduction to philosophy; an introduction to Porphyry\u2019s\nEisag\u014dg\u0113 or Introduction to Aristotle\u2019s\nlogic; a commentary on Porphyry\u2019s Introduction; the\nreading of Porphyry\u2019s Introduction itself; an\nintroduction to the philosophy of Aristotle; an introduction to the\nCategories (cf. Sorabji 2016c, 48\u201350; Hadot, 1988,\n44\u201345). The introduction to philosophy was particularly\ncongenial and influential, giving a number of definitions of\nphilosophy and, particularly, two definitions \u2018from the\ngoal\u2019: Plato\u2019s \u2018assimilation to God as far as\npossible\u2019 (Theaetetus 176b) and \u2018practice of\ndeath\u2019 (Phaedo 64a; Ammonius, in Isag. 3,7 ff.\nand 4,15 ff.). Lectures on the works of Plato and Aristotle presumably\nlasted about an hour. In Proclus we see signs of such hour-long\ndivisions, as well as a division of the lecture on an individual\npassage into discussion of its doctrine (the\u014dria),\nsometimes quite wide-ranging, followed by its wording\n(lexis); signs of this division are still present in\nAmmonius\u2019 in Int. Students evidently took copious\nnotes, which they might then publish, under their own names or that of\nAmmonius himself.\n\nThe lectures of Ammonius and his students gave a very detailed\nexegesis of their text and an indication of its philosophical\nimportance, including how it related to other texts of Aristotle and\nPlato. These two philosophers were each taken to be substantially\nself-consistent and uniform in opinion throughout his own writings,\nand in agreement with one another and with the truth (see, e.g.,\nSimplicius, in DA 1,3\u201321). According to Elias (in\nCat. 107,24\u20137), Proclus put together a list of ten\nquestions to be answered preliminary to the study of Aristotle, and it\nis Ammonius who gives us the first preserved version of these. One of\nthe preliminary questions concerns the role of the interpreter. Elias\n(in Cat. 122,25\u2013123,5) says that the exegete is also a\nknower, in the one capacity explaining what is unclear in his text and\nin the other judging its truth and falsity. He ought not to insist\nthat his author is always correct, but he ought rather to value the\ntruth more than the man; he ought not to become an exclusive partisan\nof his philosopher, as Iamblichus was for Plato. Further, he ought to\nknow all of Aristotle, so that he can show on the basis of\nAristotle\u2019s works that he agrees with himself; he ought to know\nall of Plato, so that he can show that Plato agrees with himself,\nwhile making the works of Aristotle an introduction to those of Plato.\nThese requirements are associated with Ammonius by Olympiodorus in his\ncommentary on the Gorgias (cf. Tarrant in Jackson et al.\n1998, 11 and notes on 32.1 and 42.2), and one can see the insistence\non knowing and judging the truth over loyalty to Aristotle in\nAmmonius\u2019 own introductory precepts (in Cat. 7,34\nff.).\n\nThe later Alexandrian commentators tend to emphasize that it is the\ncommentator\u2019s duty not to interpret apparent disagreements of\nAristotle with Plato literally, but to look to the sense and discover\nthe fundamental agreement or \u2018harmony\u2019\n(sumph\u014dnia) of the two philosophers (e.g., Simplicius,\nin Cat. 7,31). Ammonius\u2019 own statement of the qualities\nof an exegete (in Cat. 7,34 ff.) does not say this, but in\npractice he does point out the agreement of Plato and Aristotle\n(in Int. 39,11). Syrianus and Proclus criticized, at times\nharshly, Aristotle\u2019s disagreement with Plato\u2019s views on,\ne.g., the existence of Forms and the demiurgic role of God as crafting\nand creating the physical world. In contrast, Ammonius points out\n(Asclepius, in Metaph. 69,17\u201327; cf. Sorabji 2005, vol.\n3 sect. 5(d), and Cardullo 2012, 78\u201381) that, while Aristotle\n\u2018seems\u2019 to be attacking Plato on the Forms in\nMetaph. 990b3, he actually agrees with Plato, since he\npraises (De An. 429a28) those who say that the soul is the\nplace of Forms. Ammonius also makes God the efficient cause of all\nthings, in addition to being the final cause (see below, sect. 3.2).\nThis appears to be a characteristic difference of approach between\nSyrianus-Proclus and Ammonius and his pupils: the latter outdo the\nformer in their concern to \u2018harmonize\u2019 Aristotle\u2019s\nand Plato\u2019s views and their willingness to interpret Aristotle\nas not disagreeing with Plato in any fundamental way. \n",
