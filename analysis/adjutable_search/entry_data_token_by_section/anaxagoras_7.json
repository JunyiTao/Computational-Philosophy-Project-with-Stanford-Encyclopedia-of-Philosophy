    "main_text": "The Physical Principles || Ingredients and Seeds\n3.2 Ingredients and Seeds\n\n\nNowhere in the extant fragments does Anaxagoras give a complete list\nof the ingredients in the mixture, or a clear indication of their\nscope, so it is up to commentators to figure out what he meant, given\nthe available evidence. There are three alternatives.  First, some\nscholars have held that Anaxagoras limited the basic ingredients to\nthe opposites, such as hot and cold, wet and dry, sweet and bitter,\ndark and light, and so on. It is the opposites that have explanatory\nforce in the theory, and all other things and properties are reducible\nto the opposites. Supporters of this view include Tannery 1886, Burnet\n1930, Cornford 1930, Vlastos 1950, Schofield 1980 (with reservations),\nInwood 1986, Spanu 1987\u201388, Sedley 2007, and Marmodoro 2015, 2017. On\nthis view all the material stuffs and all the objects in the universe\nwould be natural constructs. At the opposite extreme, a second option\naccepts that literally everything in the natural world is in the\noriginal mixture \u2014 opposites, but also natural materials (fire,\nearth, copper, iron, and the like), animals and plants (and their\nparts such as flesh, blood, and bone), and so on. This view makes no\ndistinction between ingredients and what have been called natural\nconstructs above. It can be found in Strang 1963, Stokes 1965, Guthrie\n1965, Barnes 1982, Furth 1991, Graham 1994 and 2004, Lewis\n2000. Finally, there is a middle view, which rejects the\nopposites-only account, and accepts that some things (plants and\nanimals, heavenly bodies) are natural constructs. The original mix\nincludes opposites, but also natural substances like metals and earth,\nand the ingredients of animals, such as flesh, blood, and bone, but no\nwhole physical objects such as plants and animals themselves, or their\norganic parts such as legs and hearts (Curd 2007; this view is\nsuggested in Schofield 1980, 132 ff.).\n\n\nThe \u201copposites only\u201d view cannot stand (arguments\nagainst it are given in Guthrie 1965 and Graham 2004). B15 may provide\nsome evidence for the view:\n\n\nThe dense and the wet and the cold and the dark came together\nhere, where <the> earth is now; but the rare and the hot and the\ndry <and the bright> moved   out to\nthe far reaches of the aether.\n\n\nBut Anaxagoras\u2019 own lists include more than the opposites (see B4a and\nB4b). Further, the Principle of Predominance (in B12, see sect. 3.4)\nwould seem to require more than opposites, since it does not seem to\nsay that each thing is reducible to opposite characteristics that\npredominate, but that each thing gets its character from the\nparticular material ingredients that predominate in it. Further\nevidence against the opposites-only view is found in Aristotle.\nAristotle claims that for Anaxagoras, the elements (the basic\nrealities) are what Aristotle calls the homoiomerous parts (On\nComing to Be and Passing Away I.1 314a18). These are (for\nAristotle) things that are literally \u201clike-parted,\u201d i.e.,\nthey are homogeneous all the way through, like a piece of pure gold,\nrather than being different in their different parts (like a hand),\nand Aristotle lists flesh, blood, bone, and adds \u201cand the others\nof which the part is called by the same name [as the whole].\u201d\nThe term homoiomeries is Aristotelian, and has no role to\nplay in Anaxagoras (Graham 1994, Curd 2007; contra: Sisko\n2009), but it is clear that for Aristotle, the ingredients in an\nAnaxagorean mixture are not just the opposites.\n\n\nIf the attempt to reduce the Anaxagorean ingredients to opposites is\nunsuccessful, so, too, is the interpretation that allows as an\ningredient every kind of thing in the phenomenal world. A minor\npoint is that Anaxagoras surely does not think that artifacts made by\nhuman beings are part of the mixture, and there are other semi-natural\nartifacts as well that would not seem to be present: cheese, bronze,\nwhiskey, for example. More importantly, the wide-scope view fails\nto take seriously B17\u2019s replacement of coming-to-be and\npassing-away with mixture and dissolution. Further, it is unclear\nhow the view can discriminate between an individual and its parts or\ningredients. Are there homunculi of individuals in the original\nmix? (Lewis 2000 accepts this.) If so, how can the theory\nexplain that the growth of an organism is not simply its enlargement\n(by adding ingredients) but also its development? (A\nplant\u2019s leaves may grow larger, but its seed pods develop, and\nare not just an enlargement of a structure that was already present in\nthe seedling plant.) In B4a Anaxagoras refers to the animals and\nhumans \u201cthat have been compounded, as many as have soul,\u201d\nand this suggests that B17\u2019s implicit model of living things as\nnatural constructs mixed together from the ingredients that are\ngenuinely real must be taken seriously.\n\n\nIt seems, then, best to interpret Anaxagoras as claiming that all\nthe material ingredients of natural living things and the heavenly\nbodies are present in the original mix, but that these objects\nthemselves are not among the ingredients but are natural constructions,\nproduced by the processes of mixture and separation that we call\nnutrition and growth, or by the rotations of the heavens and the\nattendant clumping together and breaking apart of the ingredients of\nthe stars, clouds, comets, planets, and so on.\n\n\nA problem for any account of the original mixture is Anaxagoras\u2019\nmention of seeds. The word for seeds (spermata) occurs twice\nin the fragments, in lists of ingredients (in B4a and in B4b), but\nAnaxagoras nowhere explains or makes it clear what it means. There are\na number of options: seeds have been taken to be the smallest possible\nbits of ingredients (but, as argued above, there are no smallest bits\nin Anaxagoras\u2019 system), or to be extremely small homunculi-like\ningredients that some interpretations take to be origins for\nAnaxagoras of living things which then expand by the addition of other\ningredients (Lewis 2000). Furley 1976 and 2002 advocates the simplest\ninterpretation, that Anaxagoras simply means biological seeds (but not\nhomunculi), and this seems the best proposal (see also Barnes 1982,\nCurd 2007, Sedley 2007, Marmodoro 2015, 2017, 147\u2013153; Marmodoro also sees seeds as biological, containing pre-existing structures). A seed would then be a biological origin\npoint, and might perhaps be the route through which nous\n(which controls all things that have soul, i.e., anything alive)\nenters a living thing. If a seed is mixed with the right ingredients\nin the right circumstances, a living thing will grow.\n",
