    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\n\n The debate over adaptationism is often\ntraced back to a 1979 paper by Stephen Gould and Richard Lewontin,\ncalled \u201cThe Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm:\nA Critique of the Adaptationist Programme,\u201d or simply the\n\u201cSpandrels\u201d paper. This paper is important but, in\nfact, this debate traces back to the nineteenth century, with elements\nof adaptationism or pluralism as currently understood being present in\nthe work of Henry Bates, William Bateson, Charles Darwin, Ernst\nHaeckel, Herbert Spencer, Alfred Wallace, and August Weissman, among\nothers (see Mayr 1982 and Ruse 2003 for some of the historical\nbackground).\n\n\n In the early twentieth century, views that\nwe now call adaptationism and pluralism were enunciated by biologists.\nAmong them were two of the then (and now) most influential evolutionary\nbiologists: Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. The central idea of\nFisher's important 1930 book \u201cThe Genetical Theory of\nNatural Selection\u201d is that natural selection is the only\nimportant influence on trait evolution. This is the central text of\nadaptationism; indeed, it has an honored place in the minds of most\nevolutionary biologists, no matter what their position on adaptationism\n(compare Grafen 2003 and Kimura 1983). Issued again in 1958 in a\nrevised edition and in 1999 in a variorum edition, this book has\ngarnered over 8,400 journal citations; over 7,600 have occurred\nsince 1975 (Web of Science, June 2010).\n\n\n Sewall Wright's pluralist view\nof evolution was presented in several places, with his 1931 paper\n\u201cEvolution in Mendelian Populations\u201d and the 1977 book\n\u201cEvolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 3 Experimental\nResults and Evolutionary Deductions\u201d being the best known. The\npaper has received over 3,400 citations; over 3,000 have occurred since\n1975, while the book has received over 800 citations since 1977 (Web of\nScience, June 2010).\n\n\n These works by Fisher and Wright are\ncanonical contributions to the field of evolutionary biology. They were\nbased partially on prior claims and counterclaims about the influence\nof natural selection and of non-selective forces on trait evolution,\nespecially in species such as land snails that have easily\ndistinguishable trait variation (see Millstein 2007a). In turn, these\nworks stimulated continuing claims and counterclaims. The mid-1970s\nexplosion of citations reflects the fact that the number of biologists\nstudying ecology and evolution increased markedly as compared to the\nearly 1960s and that evolutionary biology gained separate departmental\nstatus at many universities; these changes were in part caused by the\nincreased societal awareness and concern at that time about pollution\nand the impact of humans on the environment. There were two central but\nmainly disjunct scientific developments that energized the\nproliferation and refinement of adaptationist and of pluralist views\nduring this period. The first was the extensive development of\n\u201cstrategic\u201d claims in evolutionary ecology, which in the\ncase of a given trait, say, the allocation of energy to male and to\nfemale offspring (e.g., Hamilton 1967; see also Charnov 1982), provides\nan explanation as to why the observed trait is locally optimal. Such a\nclaim invokes only natural selection as an important causal explanation\nof the trait. The second development was the neutral theory in\npopulation genetics, which posits that natural selection plays little\nor no role in determining DNA and protein sequence variation in natural\npopulations (e.g., Kimura 1968, 1983). The former development generated\nlittle initial controversy, while the latter development immediately\ngenerated lasting controversy (see Dietrich 1994).\n\n\n It is this combination of social,\ninstitutional, and scientific developments that formed the background\nto Gould and Lewontin's 1979 paper, which can be best understood\nas an important but not singular event in a long-standing debate in\nevolutionary biology. It is neither the beginning of the debate over\nadaptationism nor something much narrower, e.g., little more than\n\u201cthe attempted intellectual lynching\u201d of sociobiology, cf.,\nQueller (1995); see also Pigliucci and Kaplan (2000). Such claims are\nat best historically incorrect.\n",
