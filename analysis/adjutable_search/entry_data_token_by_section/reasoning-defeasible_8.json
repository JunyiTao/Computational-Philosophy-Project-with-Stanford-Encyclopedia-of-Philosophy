    "main_text": "Applications and Motivation || Defeasible Obligations\n2.5 Defeasible Obligations\n\nPhilosophers have, for quite some time, been interested in defeasible\nobligations, which give rise to defeasible inferences about what we\nare, all things considered, obliged to do. David Ross, in 1930,\ndiscussed the phenomena of prima facie obligations (Ross\n1930, 1939). The existence of a prima facie obligation gives one good,\nbut defeasible grounds, for believing that one ought to fulfill that\nobligation. When formal deontic logic was developed by\nChisholm and others in the 1960s (Chisholm 1963), the use of classical\nlogic gave rise to certain paradoxes, such as Chisholm\u2019s paradox\nof contrary-to-duty imperatives. These paradoxes can be resolved by\nrecognizing that the inference from imperative to actual duty is a\ndefeasible one (Asher and Bonevac 1996; Nute 1997). \n\nSuch defeasible obligations can also appear in the domain of law: see\nPrakken and Sartor 1995 and 1996.\n",
