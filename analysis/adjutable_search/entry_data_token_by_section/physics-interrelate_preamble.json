    "main_text": "\n\n\nMany issues in the philosophy of science concern the nature of theories\nand certain relations that may obtain between them. Typically, one is\ninterested in the degree to which a successor to a given theory \u201cgoes\nbeyond\u201d (both descriptively and explanatorily) the theory it succeeds.\nMost often these issues are framed in the context of reductive\nrelations between theories. When does a theory \\(T'\\) reduce\nto a theory \\(T\\)? How is one to understand the nature of this\nreduction relation? Interestingly, there are two distinct, yet, related\nways of understanding the reductive relationship between \\(T\\) and\n\\(T'\\). Thomas Nickles noted this in a paper entitled \u201cTwo\nConcepts of Intertheoretic Reduction.\u201d On the one hand, there is the\n\u201cphilosopher\u2019s\u201d sense of reduction on which the supplanted theory is\nsaid to reduce to the newer more encompassing theory. On the other\nhand, the \u201cphysicist\u2019s\u201d sense of reduction puts things the other way.\nThe newer, typically more refined theory is said to reduce to the older\ntypically less encompassing theory in some sort of limit. These two\nsenses of reduction will be discussed in turn. \n",
