    "main_text": "Human Evolution and the Descent of Man || The Ethical Theory of the Descent of Man\n5. Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe historiography adopted in this article rejects a simple linear\nstory of the development of Darwinian theory as a history of\nincreasingly true theories leading to a present consensus. Instead it\nfavors a more complicated \u201ccompeting research programs\u201d\nanalysis (Lakatos 1970), programs which through historical competition\nhave resulted in more adequate accounts of the relation of living\nbeings to historical time and naturalistic processes, but which show\nrepeated historical competition with one another .\n\nMore general philosophical issues associated with evolutionary\ntheory\u2014those surrounding natural teleology, ethics, the relation\nof evolutionary naturalism to the claims of religious traditions, the\nimplications for the relation of human beings to the rest of the\norganic world\u2014continue as issues of scholarly inquiry. If\ncontemporary neo-selectionist evolutionary theory displays continuity\nwith select features of the theories of Darwin, alternative\ninterpretations, such as the current movement known as evolutionary\ndevelopmental theory or \u201cevo-devo\u201d, mark a return to\npresumably discarded traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncentury that considered it essential to link evolution with embryonic\ndevelopment and with the effects of external conditions on inheritance\n(Gilbert 2015; Newman 2015; Laubichler & Maienschein 2013, [eds]\n2007; Gissis & Jablonka [eds] 2011; Pigliucci & M\u00fcller\n[eds] 2010; Amundson 2005; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996). Such\ndevelopments suggest that there are still substantial theoretical\nissues at stake that may alter the future understanding of\nevolutionary theory in important ways (Sloan, McKenny, & Eggleson\n[eds] 2015).\n",
