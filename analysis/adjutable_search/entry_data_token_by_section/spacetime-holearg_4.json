    "main_text": "What Represents Spacetime?\n4. What Represents Spacetime?\n\nRecall our original concern: we want to know whether we can conceive\nof spacetime as a substance\u2014that is, as something that exists\nindependently of the material events which unfold within it. To do\nthis, we need to know what in the above structures represents\nspacetime. One popular answer to that question is that the manifold of\nevents represents spacetime. This choice is natural since modern\nspacetime theories are built up by first positing a manifold of events\nand then defining further structures on them. So, on a realist view of\nphysical theories on which they are to be understood\n\u2018literally\u2019, it is very natural to regard the manifold as\nbeing an independently existing structure that bears properties, and\nwhich thereby plays the role of a container just as we expect that\nspacetime\n does.[4]\n\nOne might wonder whether some of the further structures defined on the\nmanifold represent further properties of spacetime rather than what is\ncontained within spacetime. In particular, the metric field contains\nimportant information on spatial distances and times elapsed. Ought\nthat not also to be considered a part of the containing spacetime as\nopposed to what is contained within spacetime?\n\nAgainst this line of thought, some would argue that general relativity\nmakes it hard to view the metric field simply as being part of the\ncontaining spacetime. For, in addition to spatial and temporal\ninformation, the metric field also represents the gravitational field.\nTherefore it also carries energy and momentum\u2014the energy and\nmomentum of the gravitational field (although a notorious technical\nproblem in general relativity precludes identifying the energy and\nmomentum density of the gravitational field at any particular\nevent in spacetime). This energy and momentum is freely interchanged\nwith other matter fields in spacetimes. To carry energy and momentum\nis (the thought goes) a natural distinguishing characteristic of\nmatter contained within spacetime.\n\nSo, the metric field of general relativity seems to defy easy\ncharacterization. We would like it to be exclusively part of spacetime\nthe container, or exclusively part of matter the contained. Yet it\nseems to be part of both. But in any case, the crucial point to note\nhere (contrary to some historical writing on the hole argument) is\nthat one need not settle this issue in order to get the hole argument\noff the ground! As long as one is dealing with a theory which is\nactively generally covariant in the sense articulated above, the hole\nargument will rear its head, as we will now see.\n",
