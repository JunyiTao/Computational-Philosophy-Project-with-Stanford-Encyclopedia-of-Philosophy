    "main_text": "Nature of the God/world Relation\n5. Criticisms and Responses\n\nPanentheism continues to develop. This growth has led to diverse forms\nof panentheism such as soteriological, revelational or expressivist,\nand dipolar (Gregersen 2004, 21). The variety of forms of panentheism\nhas also resulted in different degrees of panentheism ranging from\nexplicit fully developed panentheism to vague and underdeveloped forms\nof panentheism and to expressions of theism that share certain\nconcepts with fully developed forms of panentheism. Michael Brierley\nlists three premises as distinctive to panentheism: God is not\nseparate from the cosmos, God is affected by the cosmos, and God is\nmore than the cosmos (2006, 639\u2013640). Fully developed\npanentheism includes thinkers such as Charles Hartshorne, Phillip\nClayton, Leonardo Boff, Peter Hodgson, John Macquarrie, Sallie\nMcFague, J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, and Arthur Peacocke who have identified\nthemselves as panentheists. Other thinkers such as Paul Tillich have\nrarely self-identified as panentheists but share concepts with\npanentheism (Burch 1998, 251). And finally, especially through world\nreligions and early theologies various forms of theism offer diversity\nsharing certain concepts with panentheism.\n\nAnother impetus for development has been criticisms of panentheism.\nThese criticisms have taken two forms. One form, by major alternatives\nto panentheistic understandings of the God-world relation, has\ncriticized the adequacy of panentheism. Panentheism faces challenges\nboth from those who resist any lessening of the emphasis upon divine\ntranscendence and from those who find pantheism more adequate than any\nsystem distinguishing between God and the world. Recently, an\nimportant criticism, especially from Analytic theology, has been that\npanentheism lacks the distinctiveness needed to identify it precisely\nenough to distinguish it from other forms of theism, critique it, and\nfurther its development. Finally, the variety of the versions of\npanentheism has led to an active internal discussion among the various\nversions.\n\nCriticisms of panentheism from major alternatives such as pantheists\nand scientists working with naturalist assumptions criticize\npanentheism for its metaphysical claim that there is a being above or\nother than the natural world. At times, this criticism has been made\nby claiming that a thorough-going naturalism does not need a\ntranscendent, individualized reality. Robert Corrington describes the\ndevelopment of his thought as a growing awareness that panentheism\nunnecessarily introduces a being above nature as well as in nature\n(2002, 49). William Drees expresses a similar criticism by arguing\nthat all contemporary explanations of human agency, including\nnon-reductionist explanations, are naturalistic and do not require any\nreference to a higher being. For panentheists to claim that divine\nagency is analogous to human agency fails both to recognize that human\nagency requires no additional source or cause and to explain how a\ndivine source of being could act in the realm of physical and mental\nprocesses (1999). Frankenberry makes this objection more specific.\nPanentheism offers a more complex relationship between God and the\nworld than is necessary. This unnecessary complexity is revealed by\nthe problems that panentheism has with the logic of the freedom of\nparts in wholistic relations, the possibility of the body-soul analogy\nrelapsing into gender inflected ideas of the soul as the male\nprinciple, the problem with simultaneity of events in the divine\nexperience in relation to the principle of the relativity of time, the\nnecessity of the everlasting nature of value, and finally the use of\nthe ontological argument to establish the necessity of the abstract\npole of the divine nature (1993, 36\u201339). Carl Gillett points out\nthat panentheism lacks an explanation for a causal efficacy higher\nthan the causal efficacy realized by microphysical causation (2003,\n19). Generally, panentheists respond to these criticisms by claiming\nthe inadequacy both scientifically and metaphysically of any type of\nreductionistic naturalism. Such a naturalism whether articulated in\nscientific categories or religious categories fails to recognize the\nemergence of levels of complexity in nature. The emergence of higher\nlevels of organization that cannot be completely explained in terms of\nlower levels renders non-differentiated accounts of being inadequate.\nPanentheists often argue that the emergence of higher levels of order\nmakes possible downward causation. Davies describes the difficulties\nin coming to a clear description of downward causation and concludes\nthat the complexity of systems open to the environment makes room for\ndownward causation but has not yet provided an explanation of how\ndownward causation works (2006, 48). The concepts of entanglement and\ndivine entanglement may offer a new perspective on causation and\nespecially the role of the divine in natural causation (Wegter-McNelly\n2011).\n\nThe basic theological criticism of panentheism is that its concept of\nGod is inadequate. J. Cooper concludes that panentheists reduce the\nscope and power of God\u2019s immanence (J. Cooper, 2006, 330). M.\nLeidenhag criticizes the panentheist rejection of ontological\ndifference between divine influence and natural causes for making the\nnotion of divine influence ontologically superfluous (M. Leidenhag\n2014, 209\u2013210). Similarly, Mariusz Tabaczek requires that the\ndifference between God and the world hold that God is distinct and\nutterly different from all created entities (Tabaczek 2022, 631). The\npanentheistic God changes because God needs the world and thus is\nchanged by changes in the world (Tabaczek 2022, 633). Because God\nchanges, God is not essentially identical to God, God\u2019s aseity\nis compromised by including potential rather than being fully actual\n(Tabaczek 2022, 634). God loses metaphysical independence from\ncreatures, and has only a relative transcendence, transcendence of\ndifference rather than transcendence of being (Tabaczek 2022, 634).\nEfforts to justify a mutual relation fail to recognize that relation\nis posterior to substance, things need to be what they are in order to\nrelate (Tabaczek 2022, 638). If God is not ontologically different\nfrom the world, God lacks the omni characteristics and an adequate\ntype of transcendence. According to J. Cooper, if God\u2019s\ntranscendence does not infinitely exceed God\u2019s immanence,\nGod\u2019s presence, knowledge, and power are limited rather than\ncomplete, immediate, and unconditioned (J. Cooper 2006,\n322\u2013328). Whitehead\u2019s understanding of God\u2019s\ntranscendence is limited because God only influences events before or\nafter the decisions of the events. Likewise, Hegel\u2019s denial of\ndivine simplicity makes ontological difference between God and the\nworld impossible thus limiting God\u2019s transcendence (Tabaczek\n2013, 151, 154).\n\nThe panentheistic response to the foundational issue of the\nontological distance between God and world is that the essential\ndifferences between God and the world adequately distinguish God from\nthe world. Clayton argues that the differences in essence and function\nbetween God and creation preserve the divinity of God (Clayton 2001,\n10). Humans are constituted by free and finite relatedness but God has\na primordial and essential nature (Clayton 2005, 254). Real change\ndoes occur in the divine experience, but not in the divine nature\n(Clayton 2019, 9). God is prior to the evolution of the natural world\nbecause creation is contingent (Macallan, 376). The divine act of\ncreation exceeds the individual identities and their transcendence\nover other created beings. Divine transcendence is not mere\nself-transcendence of created beings because the actions of all finite\nagents participate in the divine act (Clayton 2008a, 216). God\u2019s\ntranscendence is found in God\u2019s awareness of all that occurs\nwithin the world but this transcendence is much more intimate than an\nexternalist or substantialist model can account for (Clayton 2008a,\n148).\n\nTop-down causation indicating God\u2019s vertical transcendence is a\nfurther response that Clayton and others have made to critiques about\nthe absence ontological difference. But Jensen finds this inadequate\nbecause they are unable to verify clearly God\u2019s presence in the\ncausal nexus of the world (2014, 131). However, Bracken rejects the\nnecessity of a causal joint when both top-down and bottom-up causation\ntakes place (2014, 10). Also, Clayton counters that few process\npanentheists accept a full equality between finite actual occasions\nand the divine actual occasion or occasions. While God and finite\nrealities are equal in having existence, God being the chief\nexemplification of creativity indicates a difference between God and\nactual occasions and thus a vertical transcendence (Clayton 2015b,\n27). Finally, Bracken\u2019s field understanding of panentheism gives\npriority to God as the regent subsociety that communicates a unifying\npatter of operation just as mind does in human existence (2014,\n79\u201380).\n\nSeveral challenges to panentheism claim that the absence of an\nontological difference between God and the world means that\npanentheism cannot account for God\u2019s causal influence on the\nworld. J. Leidenhag concludes that salvation through emergence as the\nmeans of divine action cannot explain how an individual can accelerate\nevolutionary development to significant change rather than gradual\ndevelopment (J. Leidenhag 2016, 872). M. Leidenhag thinks that the\nabsence of ontological difference runs the risk of making the notion\nof divine influence ontologically superfluous (M. Leidenhag 2014,\n209\u2013210). Panentheistic explanations of divine causation argue\nthat the differences between God and the world allow for divine\ncausation without control of creation. Clayton argues that differences\nin essence and function between God and the world preserve the\ndivinity of God so that it is not necessary to locate creation outside\nof God (2001, 210). Bringing emergence together with transcendence\nrecognizes that the physical is not closed and in downward causation\ncan be influenced by the non-physical. Science is coming to understand\nmatter as having a propensity to self-organization leading to more and\nmore complex systems that display new qualities that are not present\nat simpler stages (Clayton 2001, 209). \u201cJust as the\nneurophysiological structure of the higher primates is \u2018upwardly\nopen\u2019 to the emergence and causal power of the mental, so the\nmental or cultural world is upwardly open to the influence of the\nCreator Spirit.\u201d (Clayton 2003, 211). This makes possible an\ninternalist understanding of God\u2019s action and creativity.\nConcepts of emergence and system levels avoid the dilemma between\nupward and downward causation by understanding causation as circular,\ninvolving interacting effects between different levels of organization\n(Clayton 2008a, 68). Bringing emergence together with transcendence\nrecognizes that a divine source entails divine involvement with the\nworld (Clayton 2004c, 185). Divine causality is best understood as a\nform of causal influence that prepares and persuades. History in this\nsense is the result of divine persuasion and is open (Clayton 2008a,\n198).\n\nHowever, a concept of divine causation risks raising the problem of\nevil if divine causation is the sole source of reality. J. Leidenhag\npoints out that if God generates the world with all its inequality and\ninjustice God becomes responsible for evil with all the issues of\ntheodicy (J. Leidenhag 2016, 879). Thomas J. Oord illustrates a\ntypical panentheist response to the critique that a panentheist\nconcept of God makes God responsible for evil. For Oord, God\u2019s\nlove is inherently uncontrolling (Oord 2019, 30). God\u2019s love\nempowers others giving them the possibility of choosing to do evil.\nGod does not create or cause evil. Clayton describes all the actions\nof finite agents as participating in the divine act in a way that\ntheir partial autonomy of action is preserved (Clayton 2008a, 216).\nThe autonomy of finite actions makes possible the existence of\nevil.\n\nBut if God does not control all that happens, the question of if God\ncan guarantee the defeat of evil arises. If God cannot finally\novercome evil, God is not worthy of worship. A closely related\ncritique is that the panentheistic God is unable to guarantee a future\ngood. While panentheists agree that human freedom logically precludes\nGod\u2019s prevention of future evil that results from human choice,\nmany affirm that God\u2019s response to unpreventable evil is that\nGod suffers with the person suffering evil. However, God\u2019s\nsuffering with a person does not offer any guarantee that evil will be\novercome. But the support of a relationship with God does offer a\nbasis for the hope of overcoming evil. Clayton and Bracken maintain\nthat the world does influence God but God\u2019s will, expressed\nthrough the decisions that God makes, protects God\u2019s ability to\nsave (Clayton 2005). Moltmann\u2019s description of God\u2019s\nessence as directing God\u2019s activity in order to maintain the\nreliability of God as love acting on behalf of creation provides an\nexplanation of how God acts to overcome evil. Moltmann does not find\nit necessary to protect divine freedom by giving it priority over\ndivine love but rather understands freedom as acting according to the\ndivine nature of love (Moltmann 1981, 98, 99). Even more specifically,\nGriffin\u2019s discussion of divine variable action allows for\nspecific and distinctive manifestations of divine love (2004, 45).\nBut, Alexander Jensen criticizes the ability of the panentheist\nconcept to save by distinguishing between salvation by God and\nsalvation through agents of their own salvation (2014, 12\u201313).\nFor him a process panentheist\u2019s God can only draw and persuade\nrather than save (Jensen 2014, 128). Kenneth Pak concludes that an\nopen future makes any ultimate victory over evil impossible (2014,\n223\u2013224). In response, B. Cooper lists five ways in which a\nprocess theology supports God\u2019s power over other realities and\nevil: 1) ontological priority in providing definition, God\u2019s\nexistence establishes the nature of all that exists, 2) universality\nto all actuality, actual existence occurs due to divine actuality, 3)\nas the ground of novelty, God makes possible new realities, 4) as the\nground and preserver of all value, God preserves all value, and 5) as\nthe unconditioned character of God\u2019s integrity seeking to\nincrease value in the world and love towards the world, God\u2019s\nincrease of value and love depends only upon God (1974, 102). Palmyre\nOomen finds three similar elements in Whitehead\u2019s thought that\nrelate to God\u2019s governing and sustaining the world: 1) God\noriginates all occasions by presenting the initial aim which provides\nsome direction against evil, 2) God preserves all that can be\npreserved, and 3) God as everlasting means that no occasion can\novercome God forever (2015, 287\u2013288).\n\nAnalytic theology (Jeanine Diller and Asa Kasher, eds. 2013; Andrei A.\nBuckareff and Yujin Nagasawa, eds. 2016) offers a different type of\ncritique of panentheism. Analytical approaches to panentheism critique\npanentheism as lacking a distinctive identity making careful\nidentification, research, and development of a distinctive position\nimpossible. Two responses to this challenge to identify the\ndistinctiveness of panentheism have developed. One response seeks to\nidentify a defining characteristic. The second response affirms the\nrichness of diversity and suggests certain commonalities distinguish\npanentheism from other forms of theism.\n\nBenedikt G\u00f6cke\u2019s effort to identify a specific\ncharacteristic of panentheism notes the similarities of classical\ntheism and panentheism and concludes that the crucial difference is a\nmodal difference in that the world is not necessary for God in\nclassical theism while the world is necessary for God in panentheism\n(2013b). Raphael Lataster challenges G\u00f6cke\u2019s limitation of\nthe distinction between classical theism and panentheism by claiming\nthat panentheism\u2019s rejection of divine immutability\ndistinguishes panentheism from classical theism (2014). G\u00f6cke\nrejects this distinction as failing to recognize that spatial\nreferences are not adequate in dealing with metaphysical rather than\nphysical or logical necessity (2014). G\u00f6cke makes the\nrequirements for the distinction between classical theism and\npanentheism more specific by calling for a consistent definition of\n\u201cin\u201d by panentheists and by noting the presence of\nlogically contradictory but self-consistent interpretations of key\nnotions by various panentheists (2015). Yujin Nagasawa develops the\nconcept of modal panentheism by describing modal panentheism as\nholding that God is the totality of all possible worlds and that all\npossible worlds exist to the same extent that the actual world exists.\nThus, God includes all possible worlds and any actual worlds. But\nNagasawa also notes that modal panentheism has some similarities to\nclassical theism which limits any modal distinction between classical\ntheism and panentheism (2016). R. T. Mullins provides further evidence\nand refinement in identifying the distinctiveness of panentheism by\npointing out similarities among panentheism, open theism, and\nneo-classical theism and by critiquing G\u00f6cke\u2019s modal\ndistinction as failing to say anything unique about God. Both modal\ndistinctions and considering the world as God\u2019s body fail\nbecause they do not say anything unique about the nature of God\n(2016). Mullins offers an analytic response to the challenge regarding\nthe distinctiveness of panentheism by suggesting that panentheism can\ndistinguish itself from classical theism by making absolute space and\ntime attributes of God and by recognizing the distinction between\nabsolute time and space and physical and temporal realities contained\nwithin absolute time and space. Such a distinction offers a literal\nunderstanding of \u201cin\u201d in contrast to classical theism\n(2016). Oliver Crisp critiques Mullins\u2019s identification of\nabsolute space and time as attributes of God because that appears to\nmake God spatial and temporal (2019, 30\u201331). Pfeifer finds that\nMullins\u2019s identification of absolute time and space is helpful\nbut lacks clarity as to whether absolute time and space are attributes\nof God or the substance of God (2020, 130).\n\nA different response to the challenge that panentheism lacks a\ndistinctive characteristic suggests a symmetrical, mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe as the crucial characteristic of\npanentheism (Griffin 2004, 43\u201344; Keller 2008, 73; Clayton 215a,\n189; Gregersen 2004, 20, 22, 23; J. Cooper 2006, 29; Olson 2013, 330;\nMeister 2017, 5; Henriksen 2017, 1084; Stenmark 2019, 27; Gasser 2019,\n50).\n\nA variety of terms have been used to describe a mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe. Daniel Dombrowski (2013a, 32) described\nGod\u2019s relation to the universe as an organic relation in that\nGod and the universe influence each other. Niels Gregersen (2004, 20),\ncited by Stenmark (2019, 29), uses the phrase \u201cbilateral\nrelations\u201d. Stenmark calls God\u2019s relation to the world an\n\u201contological symmetrical\u201d relation in comparison to\nclassical theism\u2019s \u201casymmetrical\u201d ontological\ndependence. The basic nature of a mutual relation between God and the\nuniverse involves an influence of each member of the relationship on\nthe other member and assumes some degree of independence or freedom of\neach member.\n\nA mutual relation differs from the understanding of the God/world\nrelation in classical Christian theism. Panentheism and classical\nChristian theism both distinguish between God and the world. Classical\ntheism identifies this as an ontological difference. God\u2019s being\ndiffers from the being of the world. G\u00f6cke calls this a model\ndifference in which God\u2019s existence is necessary while the\nworld\u2019s existence is contingent (2013b). Stenmark describes this\nas God being ontologically distinct from the world in classical theism\nand contrasts that with panentheism as holding that God ontologically\nincludes the world (2019, 19, 27; G\u00f6cke 2017, 5\u20136). At\ntimes, classical Christian theism maintains the ontological difference\nbetween God and the world while allowing for the influence of the\nworld upon God by distinguishing between God\u2019s ontological\nnature and God\u2019s conceptual knowledge of the world or\nGod\u2019s compassion for the world (G\u00f6cke 2017, 3). God\u2019s\nknowledge may change as the world changes and God\u2019s care may\nrespond to different events in the world, but God\u2019s existence or\nessence is not changed (Stenmark 2019, 30). While God is immanent and\nactive in the world as well as transcendent for classical Christian\ntheism, the relationship between God and the universe is asymmetrical\nin that God influences the universe, but the universe does not affect\nGod (J. Cooper, 2006, 18, 22 and Stenmark 2019, 30). The world changes\nbecause of God\u2019s presence in the world, but this dynamic\nrelationship does not indicate any change in God\u2019s nature or\nwill.\n\nThe balance between God\u2019s transcendence and God\u2019s\nimmanence further refines the distinctiveness of panentheism\u2019s\nmutual relation between God and the universe in distinction from both\nclassical Christian theism and pantheism. By deriving divine immanence\nfrom divine transcendence, classical Christian theism prioritizes\nGod\u2019s transcendence (J. Cooper 2006, 328; Coman 2016, 82). In\ncontrast, Gregersen (2004, 19) balances transcendence and immanence.\nThus, panentheism affirms the basic role of divine immanence.\nLikewise, in contrast to pantheism\u2019s derivation of divine\ntranscendence from divine immanence, panentheism affirms God\u2019s\ntranscendence from the world. David Nikkel recognizes the importance\nof this balance even within panentheism. He warns against an\noveremphasis upon transcendence leading to the loss of the\nindeterminacy needed for growth that occurs in panentheism overly\ninfluenced by German idealism and an overemphasis on immanence leading\nto the loss of God as the source of existence that occurs in\npanentheism overly influenced by process thought (2016). The classical\nChristian tradition due to a variety of influences such as Platonic\ninfluence that stressed the reality of the forms in contrast to matter\nshaped by the forms (see Straus 2010) has tended to understand God as\nan unrelated Other to ordinary existence. Prioritizing divine\ntranscendence by calling for a deity unlimited by events in the world\nas seen in the doctrine of creation from nothing limits\ncreation\u2019s freedom to impact divine actions. While divine\nimmanence is not denied by the classical Christian tradition,\ntranscendence over all specific relations enables the immanence of the\ndivine relation to all of reality. God is present to all of reality\nbecause God exists independently from all other reality and is\nuninfluenced by other reality. This separation of divine reality from\nordinary, created reality makes the relationship of the divine to all\nof created reality an external relationship. The external nature of\nthis relationship becomes apparent in deviations from the classical\nChristian tradition such as deism. Because of the assumed external\nnature of God\u2019s relation to creation, God cannot logically be\nconceived of as being affected by created reality. God then does not\nrespond in any way to the created order but acts without consideration\nof the events of the world. Understanding God\u2019s transcendence in\nbalance with God\u2019s immanence enables a positive relation between\nscience and theology (Clayton 2020a) and provides a basis for morality\nand ethics (Ciocan 2016, 175).\n\nThe panentheistic mutual relation also differs from pantheism which\nprioritizes divine immanence by identifying the infinite with the\nfinite. The emphasis upon divine immanence seeks to affirm the\npresence of God in the world. In contrast to pantheism\u2019s\nderivation of divine transcendence from divine immanence, panentheism\naffirms God\u2019s transcendence from the world. If divine immanence\nrather than transcendence is stressed, even when that includes the\ninfluence of other realities, it fails to retain a robust concept of\ndivine transcendence. While some forms of this interest lead to\npantheism and the identity of God with the creation, the emphasis upon\nimmanence can acknowledge the need for a source of newness and novelty\nthat is not limited by, or to, the past. For panentheism the basis for\nthis novelty is internal to created reality rather than an external\nreality providing novelty. However, the question about the adequacy of\nthe novelty for the present situation must be considered. The\ntranscendence involved in the emphasis upon immanence is a horizontal\nrather than a vertical transcendence. A horizontal transcendence\ninvolves beings of the same ontological status. For example, a person\ndiffers from other persons and thus in a sense transcends the\nlimitation of other peoples\u2019 experiences just as they are not\nlimited to the first person\u2019s experiences. Newness and novelty\nthen arise from the unrealized potentials in the original situation.\nHowever, this limitation risks making radical novelty impossible\nbecause the context always limits the possibilities.\n\nAnother response to the challenge that panentheism lacks a distinctive\ncharacteristic recognizes the diversity of types of panentheism and\nsimilarities between some other forms of theism and panentheism (Olson\n2020 [Other Internet Resources]; Burch 1998; Gustafson 2011). This\ndiversity of panentheism and the similarities to other forms of theism\nrequires identifying panentheism by means of more than single\ncharacteristic (Lataster and Bilimoria 2018, 57\u201358). Several\nsuggestions about ways to identify the commonality among the diverse\nexpressions of panentheism and similar forms of theism have been made.\nMichael Brierley finds eight common themes in panentheism although all\neight themes may not be present in each expression of panentheism\n(2004, 6\u20138). Gregersen identifies a core common to all forms of\npanentheism, God contains the world so that the world belongs to God\nand there is a feeding back from the world into divine life (2017,\n582). This common core then is expressed in a variety of forms of\npanentheism as particular theologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Stenmark\ndescribes panentheism as having core doctrines and extension claims\n(2019, 23). Panentheism and classical theism share extension claims\nthat God is the creator of the world and that continued existence of\nthe world depends upon God\u2019s ongoing creative activity. Both\npanentheism and classical theism maintain the immanence of God, but\nthey differ in that panentheism holds that God ontologically includes\nthe world while classical theism maintains an ontological distinction\nbetween God and creation. For Stenmark, the core claims of panentheism\nare that God ontologically includes the world and that God depends on\nthe world for God\u2019s own existence (2019, 25\u201326). Clayton\nsuggests that panentheism be considered a philosophical research\nprogram which may include sub-research programs. The panentheistic\nresearch program affirms the pervasiveness of change with real change\ntaking place in the divine experience but not in the divine nature.\nSince panentheists differ on whether creation is from nothing or is\nnecessary this is a sub-research program within panentheism (Clayton\n2019, 9\u201310).\n\nWhile the idea of panentheism may not be a philosophically stable\nconcept in itself, that instability makes possible respecification in\nlight of particular theologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Thus the term\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d pointed to a balance between classical\ntheism and pantheism in the early twentieth century with its use of\n\u201cin\u201d. The growth of the influence of scientific thought\nupon theology leads to a more specific understanding of the balance in\nthe relation between God and the world that emphasizes the mutual\ninteraction of God and the world and moves on from the usefulness of\n\u201cin\u201d.\n\nThe varieties of panentheism participate in internal criticism.\nClayton (2008a, 127) and Steven Crain (2006) emphasize the dependence\nof the world upon God rather than the dependence of God upon the world\nalthough they maintain that God is influenced, and changed, by the\nworld. They criticize understandings of God that limit God by making\nGod subject to metaphysical principles. Griffin emphasizes the\nregularity provided by metaphysical principles. This regularity\nrecognizes the order in reality that the reliability of God\u2019s\nlove provides. Panentheists also caution that the emphasis upon the\nontological nature of the relation between God and the world can lead\nto a loss of the integrity of the world. Richardson warns against\nlosing the discrete identity of finite beings in God (2010, 345).\nCase-Winters calls for maintaining a balance between the distinction\nbetween God and the world and God\u2019s involvement with the world.\nOver-emphasis upon either side of the balance leads to positions that\nare philosophically and theologically inadequate (Case-Winters 2007,\n125).\n",
