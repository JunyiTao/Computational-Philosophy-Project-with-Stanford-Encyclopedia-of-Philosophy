    "main_text": "What is Knowledge? || Knowing How\n2.2 Knowing How\n\nIn his groundbreaking book, The Concept of Mind, Gilbert Ryle\nargued that knowing how to do something must be different from knowing\nany set of facts. No matter how many facts you might know about\nswimming, say, it doesn\u2019t follow from your knowledge of these\nfacts that you know how to swim. And, of course, you might know how to\nswim even without knowing very many facts about swimming. For Ryle,\nknowing how is fundamentally different from knowing\nthat.\n\nThis Rylean distinction between knowing how and knowing\nthat has been prominently challenged, beginning in 1975 with the\npublication of Carl Ginet\u2019s Knowledge, Perception, and\nMemory. Ginet argued that knowing how to do something was simply\nknowing that a particular act was a way to do that thing. This\nchallenge was extended and systematized by Bo\u00ebr and Lycan (1975),\nwho argued that knowing who, knowing which,\nknowing why, knowing where, knowing when,\nand knowing how\u2014all of the varieties of knowing\nwh-, as they called it\u2014were all just different forms of\nknowing that. To know who is F, for instance, was simply to\nknow that a particular person is F. To know why\np is simply to know that a particular thing is the reason\nwhy p. And to know how to F was simply to know\nthat a particular act is a way to F. This view was\nelaborated in considerable detail by Stanley and Williamson 2001, and\nthen challenged or refined by many subsequent writers (see, for\ninstance, the essays in Bengson and Moffett 2011, and also Pavese 2015\nand 2017).\n",
