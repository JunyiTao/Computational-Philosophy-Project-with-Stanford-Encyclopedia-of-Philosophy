    "main_text": "Justice: Four Distinctions || Corrective versus Distributive Justice\n2.2 Corrective versus Distributive Justice\n\nA second important contrast, whose pedigree reaches back at least as\nfar as Aristotle, is between justice as a principle for assigning\ndistributable goods of various kinds to individual people, and justice\nas a remedial principle that applies when one person wrongly\ninterferes with another\u2019s legitimate holdings. Thus suppose Bill\nsteals Alice\u2019s computer, or sells Alice faulty goods which he\nclaims to be in perfect order: then Alice suffers a loss, which\njustice demands that Bill should remedy by returning the computer or\nfulfilling his contract honestly. Corrective justice, then,\nessentially concerns a bilateral relationship between a wrongdoer and\nhis victim, and demands that the fault be cancelled by restoring the\nvictim to the position she would have been in had the wrongful\nbehaviour not occurred; it may also require that the wrongdoer not\nbenefit from his faulty behaviour. Distributive justice, on the other\nhand, is multilateral: it assumes a distributing agent, and a number\nof persons who have claims on what is being distributed. Justice here\nrequires that the resources available to the distributor be shared\naccording to some relevant criterion, such as equality, desert, or\nneed. In Aristotle\u2019s example, if there are fewer flutes\navailable than people who want to play them, they should be given to\nthe best performers (Aristotle, The Politics, p. 128). In\nmodern debates, principles of distributive justice are applied to\nsocial institutions such as property and tax systems, which are\nunderstood as producing distributive outcomes across large societies,\nor even the world as a whole.\n\nThe conceptual distinction between distributive and corrective justice\nseems clear, but their normative relationship is more difficult to pin\ndown (see Perry 2000, Ripstein 2004, Coleman 1992, chs. 16\u201317).\nSome have claimed that corrective justice is merely instrumental to\ndistributive justice: its aim is to move from a situation of\ndistributive injustice brought about by the faulty behaviour to one\nthat is more nearly (if not perfectly) distributively just. But this\nview runs into a number of objections. One is that so long as Alice\nhas a legitimate title to her computer, her claim of corrective\njustice against Bill does not depend on her having had, prior to the\ntheft, the share of resources that distributive justice ideally\ndemands. She might be richer than she deserves to be, yet corrective\njustice still require that the computer be returned to her. In other\nwords, corrective justice may serve to promote conservative rather\nthan ideal justice, to use the distinction introduced in 2.1. Another\nobjection is that corrective justice requires the wrongdoer himself to\nrestore or compensate the person he has wronged, even if the cause of\ndistributive justice could be better served by transferring resources\nfrom a third party \u2013 giving Alice one of\neven-more-undeservedly-rich Charles\u2019s computers, for example.\nThis underlines the bilateral nature of corrective justice, and also\nthe fact that it comes into play in response to faulty behaviour on\nsomeone\u2019s part. Its primary demand is that people should not\nlose out because others have behaved wrongfully or carelessly, but it\nalso encompasses the idea that \u2018no man should profit by his own\nwrong\u2019. If Alice loses her computer in a boating accident, she\nmight, under an insurance scheme, have a claim of\ndistributive justice to a new machine, but she has no claim\nof corrective justice.\n\nIf corrective justice cannot be subsumed normatively under\ndistributive justice, we need to explain its value. What is achieved\nwhen we make Bill return the computer to Alice? Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, ch. 4) suggested that corrective\njustice aims to restore the two parties to a position of equality; by\nreturning the computer we cancel both Bill\u2019s unjustified gain\nand Alice\u2019s unjustified loss. But this assumes that the computer\ncan be returned intact. Corrective justice requires that Alice be made\nno worse off than she was before the theft, even if that means Bill\nsuffering an absolute loss (e.g. by paying for a new computer if he\nhas damaged Alice\u2019s). Aristotle himself recognized that the idea\nof evening out gain and loss made no literal sense in a case where one\nperson assaults another and has to compensate him for his injury\n\u2013 there is no \u2018gain\u2019 to be redistributed. It seems,\nthen, that the value of corrective justice must lie in the principle\nthat each person must take responsibility for his own conduct, and if\nhe fails to respect the legitimate interests of others by causing\ninjury, he must make good the harm. In that way, each person can plan\nher life secure in the knowledge that she will be protected against\ncertain kinds of external setbacks. Philosophers and lawyers writing\non corrective justice disagree about what standard of responsibility\nshould apply \u2013 for example whether compensation is required only\nwhen one person wilfully or negligently causes another to suffer loss,\nor whether it can also be demanded when the perpetrator displays no\nsuch fault but is nevertheless causally responsible for the\ninjury.\n",
