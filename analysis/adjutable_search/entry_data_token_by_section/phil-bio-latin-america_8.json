    "main_text": "Theories\n4. Theories\n\nThe five different kinds of philosophical inquiry that fall under the\ngeneral heading of philosophy of biology distinguished in\n Section 1\n are often interrelated. This can be clearly seen when a philosophical\nanalysis is made of a biological theory. In this section, we will\nfocus on the first three types mentioned above: the reassessment of\nsome problems, theses, and solutions developed in general philosophy\nof science or in other special philosophy of science in the context of\nbiology; the analysis of logical, semantic, pragmatic,\nepistemological, methodological, ontological, praxiological,\naxiological, ethical, and aesthetical aspects of biology; and the\nphilosophical analysis of specific conceptual problems in biology.\n\nThe first of these, a topic within general philosophy of science, is\nthe problem of the nature, structure, and function of scientific\ntheories. In various specific philosophies, such as that of biology,\nthe question arises as to whether theories exist as such and whether\nthey are of the same type as those found in other scientific\ndisciplines. Of course, the answer to be given depends centrally on\nthe explication of the metascientific concept of theory, to which we\nwill return later, and on the successful application of that concept\nin the realm of biology. Furthermore, the explication of the concept\nof theory is linked and contributes to the explication of other\nmetascientific concepts, such as scientific concept, statement, law,\nprinciple, or explanation, and of other philosophical issues of\nscience, such as hypothesis and theory testing and evaluation,\nconceptual change, theory-change, scientific progress, and scientific\nrationality.\n\nIn relation to the second kind of philosophical research, the analysis\nof theories entails the analysis of some logical, semantic, pragmatic,\nepistemological, methodological, ontological, praxiological, and,\neventually, axiological aspects of biology, and makes possible the\nsubsequent analysis of some ethical and aesthetic aspects of biology.\nAnd regarding the third kind of philosophical inquiry, the analysis of\ntheories includes and contributes to the explication of all the\nconcepts occurring in them (see\n Section 4.3).\n\nThroughout the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, three main\ngeneral explications of the metascientific concept of theory, or\nconceptions of scientific theories, can be identified: the\nclassical or received view, the historical\nor historicist view, and the semantic or\nmodel-theoretic view. It is worth noting that despite the use\nof the singular definite article to refer to the three previous\nmetatheoretical conceptions, we ought to clarify that each groups\ntogether a number of versions, variants, or approaches that share\ncertain basic ideas but differ from each other in the particular way\nthey understand or elaborate these ideas. We will now refer to some of\nthe most significant discussions and contributions made in Latin\nAmerica in this field, appealing to the three major metatheoretical\nconceptions mentioned above.\n",
