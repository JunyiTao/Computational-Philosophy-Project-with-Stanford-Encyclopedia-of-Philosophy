    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Motion || Achilles and the Tortoise\n3.2 Achilles and the Tortoise\n\nThe [second] argument was called \u201cAchilles,\u201d accordingly,\nfrom the fact that Achilles was taken [as a character] in it, and the\nargument says that it is impossible for him to overtake the tortoise\nwhen pursuing it. For in fact it is necessary that what is to overtake\n[something], before overtaking [it], first reach the limit from which\nwhat is fleeing set forth. In [the time in] which what is pursuing\narrives at this, what is fleeing will advance a certain interval, even\nif it is less than that which what is pursuing advanced\n\u2026. And in the time again in which what is pursuing will\ntraverse this [interval] which what is fleeing advanced, in this time\nagain what is fleeing will traverse some amount \u2026. And\nthus in every time in which what is pursuing will traverse the\n[interval] which what is fleeing, being slower, has already advanced,\nwhat is fleeing will also advance some amount. (Simplicius(b) On\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, 1014.10)\n\n\nThis paradox turns on much the same considerations as the last.\nImagine Achilles chasing a tortoise, and suppose that Achilles is\nrunning at 1 m/s, that the tortoise is crawling at 0.1\nm/s and that the tortoise starts out 0.9m ahead of\nAchilles. On the face of it Achilles should catch the tortoise after\n1s, at a distance of 1m from where he starts (and so\n0.1m from where the Tortoise starts). We could break\nAchilles\u2019 motion up as we did Atalanta\u2019s, into halves, or\nwe could do it as follows: before Achilles can catch the tortoise he\nmust reach the point where the tortoise started. But in the time he\ntakes to do this the tortoise crawls a little further forward. So next\nAchilles must reach this new point. But in the time it takes Achilles\nto achieve this the tortoise crawls forward a tiny bit further. And so\non to infinity: every time that Achilles reaches the place where the\ntortoise was, the tortoise has had enough time to get a little bit\nfurther, and so Achilles has another run to make, and so Achilles has\nan infinite number of finite catch-ups to do before he can catch the\ntortoise, and so, Zeno concludes, he never catches the tortoise.\n\nOne aspect of the paradox is thus that Achilles must traverse the\nfollowing infinite series of distances before he catches the tortoise:\nfirst 0.9m, then an additional 0.09m, then\n0.009m, \u2026. These are the series of distances\nahead that the tortoise reaches at the start of each of\nAchilles\u2019 catch-ups. Looked at this way the puzzle is identical\nto the Dichotomy, for it is just to say that \u2018that which is in\nlocomotion must arrive [nine tenths of the way] before it arrives at\nthe goal\u2019. And so everything we said above applies here too.\n\nBut what the paradox in this form brings out most vividly is the\nproblem of completing a series of actions that has no final\nmember\u2014in this case the infinite series of catch-ups before\nAchilles reaches the tortoise. But just what is the problem? Perhaps\nthe following: Achilles\u2019 run to the point at which he should\nreach the tortoise can, it seems, be completely decomposed into the\nseries of catch-ups, none of which take him to the tortoise.\nTherefore, nowhere in his run does he reach the tortoise after all.\nBut if this is what Zeno had in mind it won\u2019t do. Of course\nAchilles doesn\u2019t reach the tortoise at any point of the\nsequence, for every run in the sequence occurs before we\nexpect Achilles to reach it! Thinking in terms of the points that\nAchilles must reach in his run, 1m does not occur in the sequence\n0.9m, 0.99m, 0.999m, \u2026, so of\ncourse he never catches the tortoise during that sequence of runs!\n(And the same situation arises in the Dichotomy: no first distance in\nthe series, so it does not contain Atalanta\u2019s start!) Thus the series\nof catch-ups does not after all completely decompose the run: the\nfinal point\u2014at which Achilles does catch the tortoise\u2014must\nbe added to it. So is there any puzzle? Arguably yes.\n\n\nAchilles\u2019 run passes through the sequence of points 0.9m, 0.99m,\n0.999m, \u2026, 1m. But does such a strange\nsequence\u2014comprised of an infinity of members followed by one\nmore\u2014make sense mathematically? If not then our mathematical\ndescription of the run cannot be correct, but then what is?\nFortunately the theory of transfinites pioneered by Cantor assures us\nthat such a series is perfectly respectable. It was realized that the\norder properties of infinite series are much more elaborate than those\nof finite series.  Any way of arranging the numbers 1, 2 and 3 gives a\nseries in the same pattern, for instance, but there are many distinct\nways to order the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, \u2026 for instance. Or\n\u2026\u00a0, 3, 2, 1. Or \u2026\u00a0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5,\n\u2026. Or 2, 3, 4, \u2026\u00a0, 1, which is just the same\nkind of series as the positions Achilles must run through. Thus the\ntheory of the transfinites treats not just \u2018cardinal\u2019\nnumbers\u2014which depend only on how many things there are\u2014but\nalso \u2018ordinal\u2019 numbers which depend further on how the\nthings are arranged. Since the ordinals are standardly taken to be\nmathematically legitimate numbers, and since the series of points\nAchilles must pass has an ordinal number, we shall take it that the\nseries is mathematically legitimate. (Again, see\n\u2018Supertasks\u2019 below for another kind of problem that might\narise for Achilles\u2019.)\n",
