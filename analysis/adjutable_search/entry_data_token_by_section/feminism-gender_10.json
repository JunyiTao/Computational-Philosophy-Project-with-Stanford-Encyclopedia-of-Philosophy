Feminism is the\nmovement to end the oppression women as a group face. But, how should\nthe category of women be understood if feminists accept the above\narguments that gender construction is not uniform, that a sharp\ndistinction between biological sex and social gender is false or (at\nleast) not useful, and that various features associated with women\nplay a role in what it is to be a woman, none of which are\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient (like a variety of\nsocial roles, positions, behaviours, traits, bodily features and\nexperiences)? Feminists must be able to address cultural and social\ndifferences in gender construction if feminism is to be a genuinely\ninclusive movement and be careful not to posit commonalities that mask\nimportant ways in which women qua women differ. These\nconcerns (among others) have generated a situation where (as Linda\nAlcoff puts it) feminists aim to speak and make political demands in\nthe name of women, at the same time rejecting the idea that there is a\nunified category of women (2006, 152). If feminist critiques of the\ncategory women are successful, then what (if anything) binds\nwomen together, what is it to be a woman, and what kinds of demands\ncan feminists make on behalf of women?\n\nMany have found the fragmentation of the category of women problematic\nfor political reasons (e.g. Alcoff 2006; Bach 2012; Benhabib 1992;\nFrye 1996; Haslanger 2000b; Heyes 2000; Martin 1994; Mikkola 2007;\nStoljar 1995; Stone 2004; Tanesini 1996; Young 1997; Zack 2005). For\ninstance, Young holds that accounts like Spelman\u2019s reduce the\ncategory of women to a gerrymandered collection of individuals with\nnothing to bind them together (1997, 20). Black women differ from\nwhite women but members of both groups also differ from one another\nwith respect to nationality, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation and\neconomic position; that is, wealthy white women differ from\nworking-class white women due to their economic and class positions.\nThese sub-groups are themselves diverse: for instance, some\nworking-class white women in Northern Ireland are starkly divided\nalong religious lines. So if we accept Spelman\u2019s position, we\nrisk ending up with individual women and nothing to bind them\ntogether. And this is problematic: in order to respond to oppression\nof women in general, feminists must understand them as a category in\nsome sense. Young writes that without doing so \u201cit is not\npossible to conceptualize oppression as a systematic, structured,\ninstitutional process\u201d (1997, 17). Some, then, take the\narticulation of an inclusive category of women to be the prerequisite\nfor effective feminist politics and a rich literature has emerged that\naims to conceptualise women as a group or a collective (e.g. Alcoff\n2006; \u00c1sta 2011; Frye 1996; 2011; Haslanger 2000b; Heyes 2000;\nStoljar 1995, 2011; Young 1997; Zack 2005). Articulations of this\ncategory can be divided into those that are: (a) gender nominalist\n\u2014 positions that deny there is something women qua\nwomen share and that seek to unify women\u2019s social kind by\nappealing to something external to women; and (b) gender realist\n\u2014 positions that take there to be something women qua\nwomen share (although these realist positions differ significantly\nfrom those outlined in Section 2). Below we will review some\ninfluential gender nominalist and gender realist positions. Before\ndoing so, it is worth noting that not everyone is convinced that\nattempts to articulate an inclusive category of women can succeed or\nthat worries about what it is to be a woman are in need of being\nresolved. Mikkola (2016) argues that feminist politics need not rely\non overcoming (what she calls) the \u2018gender controversy\u2019:\nthat feminists must settle the meaning of gender concepts and\narticulate a way to ground women\u2019s social kind membership. As\nshe sees it, disputes about \u2018what it is to be a woman\u2019\nhave become theoretically bankrupt and intractable, which has\ngenerated an analytical impasse that looks unsurpassable. Instead,\nMikkola argues for giving up the quest, which in any case in her view\nposes no serious political obstacles.\n\nElizabeth Barnes (2020) responds to the need to offer an inclusive\nconception of gender somewhat differently, although she endorses the\nneed for feminism to be inclusive particularly of trans people. Barnes\nholds that typically philosophical theories of gender aim to offer an\naccount of what it is to be a woman (or man, genderqueer, etc.), where\nsuch an account is presumed to provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being a woman or an account of our gender terms\u2019\nextensions. But, she holds, it is a mistake to expect our theories of\ngender to do so. For Barnes, a project that offers a metaphysics of\ngender \u201cshould be understood as the project of theorizing what\nit is \u2014if anything\u2014 about the social world that ultimately\nexplains gender\u201d (2020, 706). This project is not equivalent to\none that aims to define gender terms or elucidate the application\nconditions for natural language gender terms though.\n",
