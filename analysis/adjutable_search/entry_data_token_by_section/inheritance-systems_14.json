Developmental and Evolutionary Implications\n\nOne of the best arguments for studying heredity through the\nperspective afforded by multiple inheritance systems is that this\nperspective opens up questions about the evolutionary and\ndevelopmental relations and interactions between the various\ninheritance systems that are characterized. Among these questions are\nquestions about whether each system creates new targets of selection,\nabout the ways in which inheritance systems may provide developmental\nscaffolding for other inheritance systems, about the regulatory role\nthey may have in relation to one another, and about the evolution of\ninheritance systems. We now turn to these issues.\n\nNon-genetic inheritance can have an effect on the ecological\nconditions an organism faces by affecting or determining behavior and\nactivities, thus increasing or dampening selection. The result is a\nfeedback loop between actions of the organism and selection that leads\nto what Conrad Waddington referred to as the cybernetic nature of\nevolution (Waddington 1961). Behavioral and symbolic inheritance, in\nparticular, can reinforce this process. By thus affecting the\nselective challenges faced by the organism, the evolutionary feedback\nloop can turn short-term hereditary effects, that would not survive\nmany generations, into long term evolutionary change.\n Section 4.4\n further discusses the ramifications of this phenomenon.\n\nJablonka and Lamb (2005/2014) present a general account of biological\nevolution based on the multiple inheritance systems perspective. They\nargue that evolution can occur through any of the inheritance systems\nthey identify (e.g., the behavioral) without necessarily involving\ngenetic changes. This can happen through natural selection operating\non non-genetic hereditary variations. Epigenetic changes are usually\ngenerated at a higher rate than genetic changes, often as a result of\nchanges in environmental conditions, and the variation that is\ngenerated may have a higher chance of being beneficial than blind\nvariation. This may allow rapid adaptation to changing conditions.\nThese claims apply to behavioral inheritance and symbolic inheritance\nas well. Shea, Pen, & Uller (2011) distinguish between the\nadaptation resulting from selection on epigenetic variations, which\nthey term selection-based effects, and the adaptation\nresulting from induced response to the environment, which they term\ndetection-based effects, and discuss their evolutionary and\ndevelopmental consequences. Selection-based effects lead to adaptation\nvia natural selection operating on reliably transmitted epigenetic\nvariations and are analogous to the selection-based effects of genetic\ninheritance, though epigenetic variation may occur more rapidly and\nits frequency may increase due to environmental challenges.\nDetection-based effects, in contrast, are the result of directional\nvariation and are a form of phenotypic plasticity.\n\nWhile Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s approach is similar to that of\nMaynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry (Maynard Smith &\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995), in that Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nfocus on changes in the way hereditary information is stored and\ntransmitted, Jablonka and Lamb argue that Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry neglect the evolutionary role played by distinct\ninformation-transmitting systems. In particular, they argue that\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s approach neglects the role\nof instructive processes, of the sort typically found in EISs, BISs,\nand the SIS, which lead to induced hereditary changes that are acted\nupon by natural selection (Jablonka & Lamb 2005: 343). Maynard\nSmith and Szathm\u00e1ry, in contrast, argue that even with the\nexistence of epigenetic inheritance processes, natural selection\nworking on mutations that are typically not adaptive (i.e.,\nnon-directed) remains the fundamental evolutionary process (Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 249).\n",
