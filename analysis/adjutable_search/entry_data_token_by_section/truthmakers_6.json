    "main_text": "Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)?\n2. Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)?\n\nEven when truth-maker panegyrists agree about what it is to be a\ntruth-maker, they often still disagree about the range of truths that\nare eligible to be made true. This results in further disagreement\nabout what kinds of entities truth-makers are. There is potential for\ndisagreement here because of the appearance that different ranges of\ntruths require different kinds of truth-makers. Sometimes, discovering\nthemselves unable to countenance the existence of one or other kind of\ntruth-maker, panegyrists may find themselves obliged to reconsider\nwhat truths really require truth-makers or to reconsider what it is to\nbe a truth-maker. We can get a sense of the complex interplay of\nforces at work here by starting out from the most simple and general\nprinciple about truth-making (maximalism) and then seeing what\npressures are generated to make us step back from it.\n",
