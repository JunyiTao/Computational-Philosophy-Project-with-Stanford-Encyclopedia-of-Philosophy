    "main_text": "Theoretical Frameworks || Normativity of Understanding\n2.3 Normativity of Understanding\n\nSuppose you accurately grasp that your house burned down because of\nfaulty wiring. You do not think it burned down because of a lightning\nstrike, or a stray cigarette. Faulty wiring was the cause, and you\naccurately grasp it as the cause (see Pritchard 2009, 2010 for more\ndetails on a case like this).\n\nIs that all there is to understanding why your house burned down? Or\ndoes it also matter, for example, how one comes to grasp this\nrelationship? These questions push us to ask about the normative\ndimension of understanding, and in particular to ask: Are there better\nand worse ways to come by one\u2019s grasp, and does this matter for\nthe acquisition of understanding? For example, are careful experiments\nor good evidence needed? Or can one come by one\u2019s grasp more or\nless by luck, and yet still in a way that generates understanding?\n\nA parallel question with respect to knowledge would ask: Supposing you\nhave a true belief, is that all there is to knowledge? And here most\nwould say \u201cno\u201d. In addition to the true belief, how\nyou came by that true belief is also important. Is it\nbased on good evidence, or a reliable process, or a well-functioning\ndesign plan? When it comes to knowledge, these further normative\nquestions clearly matter. It is therefore not surprising that the same\nsorts of questions have been asked with respect to understanding.\n\nWhile some argue that the normative profile of understanding is\nessentially the same as the normative profile of knowledge (Grimm\n2006; Khalifa 2013, 2017b; Greco 2014), others claim that they differ\nin important ways, and especially with respect to the way in which\nunderstanding, but not knowledge, seems compatible with luck.\nAmong theorists who see a difference between knowledge and\nunderstanding here, we can distinguish those who claim that\nunderstanding can be fully externally lucky from those who\nthink it can only be partly externally lucky.\n\nA leading advocate of the fully externally lucky view is\nJonathan Kvanvig, who argues that how one comes by one\u2019s\naccurate grasp matters\u2014what we might call the\n\u201cetiology\u201d of the accurate grasp\u2014but it does not\nmatter in all the same ways that we find in cases of knowledge (see\nespecially Kvanvig 2003). In particular, it matters that the grasp was\nacquired in a way that was internally appropriate\n(especially, in accord with the evidence in one\u2019s possession),\nbut it does not matter that the grasp was externally\nappropriate\u2014for example, that one came by one\u2019s\nevidence in a reliable way. Thus Kvanvig argues:\n\n\nWhat is distinctive about understanding has to do with the way in\nwhich an individual combines pieces of information into a unified\nbody. This point is not meant to imply that truth is not important for\nunderstanding, for we have noted already the factive character of both\nknowledge and understanding. But once we move past its facticity, the\ngrasping of relations between items of information is central to the\nnature of understanding. By contrast, when we move past the facticity\nof knowledge, the central features involve non-accidental connections\nbetween mind and world. (Kvanvig 2003: 197)\n\n\nFor instance, suppose you read a history book full of inaccurate facts\nabout the Comanche dominance of the Southern Plains in the nineteenth\ncentury, but your dyslexia miraculously transforms them all into\ntruths (Kvanvig 2009). For Kvanvig, despite the one-in-a-billion\nluckiness of your grasp\u2019s origins, you could nonetheless come to\nan understanding of this topic. So long as the accuracy and internal\nappropriateness conditions are satisfied, how you came by your\naccurate grasp is not important.\n\nOther philosophers have objected to Kvanvig\u2019s account. On their\nview, it is implausible to think you can come to understand the world\nthrough sheer external luck, or (perhaps worse) through being the\nvictim of massive deception (Grimm 2006; Pritchard 2010; Khalifa\n2017b: ch. 7; Kelp 2021). Thus Pritchard claims that one needs to\nacquire one\u2019s accurate grasp \u201cin the right fashion\u201d\n(Pritchard 2010: 108) or \u201cin the right kind of way\u201d\n(Pritchard 2010: 110)\u2014in other words, by means of a reliable\nsource or method. One\u2019s grasp therefore cannot be the result of\n\u201cGettier luck\u201d\u2014where, for instance, by sheer chance\na story intended to deceive you happens to be right (Pritchard\n2010).\n\nAt the same time, philosophers such as Pritchard and Alison Hills hold\nthat understanding does tolerate certain kinds of luck, and\nin a way that propositional knowledge does not (Pritchard 2010; Hills\n2016). They therefore hold that understanding can be\u00a0partly\nexternally lucky. Thus imagine your environment is filled with\nmisleading information about some event\u2014the fire that destroyed\nyour house, for example. Suppose that only Source X will offer\nyou the truth about the fire\u2014that faulty wiring was the\ncause\u2014while all of the other sources will offer plausible but\nmistaken accounts. If you luckily rely on Source X, that source\ncan enable you to understand why the event occurred, even though it\ncannot generate knowledge about why it occurred, due to the presence\nof what Pritchard calls \u201cenvironmental luck\u201d. The upshot,\non this view, is that while understanding is compatible with\nenvironmental luck, it is not compatible with Gettier luck. They\nconclude from this that since knowledge is compatible with neither\nGettier luck nor environmental luck, understanding is not a species of\nknowledge.\n\n(For recent empirical studies regarding the compatibility of judgments\nof understanding with luck, and finding mixed support for this\ncompatibility, see Wilkenfeld et al. 2018; Carter et al. 2019.)\n\nRegarding the normative profile of understanding and its relation to\nknowledge, others have argued that understanding is not vulnerable to\ndefeat, especially in the face of known counterevidence, in the way\nthat knowledge is (Hills 2016; Dells\u00e9n 2017). Dells\u00e9n\nfor instance argues that if I come to believe or grasp that a car\nengine works a certain way, and it really does work that way, then my\nunderstanding of how the engine works is secure even if I have\n(misleading) evidence that the person telling me about the engine is\nunreliable (Dells\u00e9n 2017). To these philosophers, this provides\nstill another reason for thinking that understanding is not a species\nof knowledge.\n",
