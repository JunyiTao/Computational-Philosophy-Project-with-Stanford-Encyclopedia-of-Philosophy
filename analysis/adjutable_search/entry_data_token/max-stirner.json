Stirner\u2019s Life and Work\n\nStirner was born Johann Caspar Schmidt on 25 October 1806, the only\nchild of lower middle class Lutheran parents living in Bayreuth.\n\u201cStirner\u201d was originally a nickname, resulting from a\nlarge forehead, exaggerated by the way he pushed back his hair, and\nonly later \u2014 in the form of \u201cMax Stirner\u201d \u2014\nadopted as a literary pseudonym and his preferred name. His father had\ndied when Stirner was only six months old, and he was brought up by\nhis mother (who subsequently remarried) and then later, when his\nmother moved from Bayreuth, by an aunt who looked after him in order\nthat he could continue his schooling at the renowned local Gymnasium.\nStirner subsequently pursued his undergraduate studies, with little\nacademic distinction, at the universities of Berlin, Erlangen, and\nK\u00f6nigsberg. In Berlin, he is known to have attended three\nlecture-series given by G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831): on the\nphilosophy of religion; on the history of philosophy; and on the\nphilosophy of \u201csubjective spirit\u201d (which concerns\nindividual psychology, including thinking and the will).\n\nTowards the end of his university career, Stirner devoted much of his\ntime to \u201cfamily affairs\u201d, possibly a euphemism for his\nmother\u2019s deteriorating mental health. In 1832, he returned with\nhis mother to Berlin, and sought, with qualified success, to train as\na teacher. (Stirner\u2019s mother was committed to a mental home in\n1837 and she would eventually outlive him by three years.) A period of\nprivate study and irregular work followed, including eighteenth months\nworking unpaid as an Latin teacher. During this time he married Agnes\nButz (1815\u20131838), a member of his landlady\u2019s family. In\nAugust 1838, Agnes died giving birth to a still-born child. Edgar\nBauer (1820\u20131886) would later maintain that Stirner had once\ntold him that, having caught sight of his first wife naked, he was\nunable to touch her again.\n\nBetween 1839 and 1844 Stirner maintained something of a double life in\nBerlin. He obtained a position at a well-regarded private girls\u2019\nschool, and spent the next five years teaching history and literature,\nestablishing a reputation as a polite and reliable teacher in the\nprocess. Away from his teaching post, however, Stirner began to\nfrequent the more avant-garde of Berlin\u2019s intellectual haunts.\nHe used the reading room of the novelist Willibald Alexis\n(1798\u20131871), spent afternoons at the Caf\u00e9 Stehely, and\nfrom 1841 onwards was a regular visitor to Hippel\u2019s wine bar on\nthe Friedrichstrasse. The last of these was the main meeting place of\n\u201cthe free\u201d, an increasingly bohemian group of teachers,\nstudents, officers, and journalists, under the loose intellectual\nleadership of the left-Hegelian Bruno Bauer (1809\u20131882). The\nlatter had recently been dismissed from his teaching post at the\nUniversity of Bonn, following an official inquiry into the orthodoxy\nof his writings on the New Testament. This unconventional group\nincluded Marie D\u00e4hnhardt (1818\u20131902) who became\nStirner\u2019s second wife (and the dedicatee of The Ego and Its\nOwn). In this bohemian environment, and despite his calm and\nunassuming personal appearance, Stirner gained a reputation for his\nhostility to religion, intolerance of moderation, and ability to\nprovoke fierce argument.\n\nStirner\u2019s earliest published writings date from this time in\nBerlin. In addition to some short and unremarkable pieces of\njournalism for the Rheinische Zeitung and the Leipziger\nAllgemeine Zeitung, these writings include a knowing review of\nBruno Bauer\u2019s anonymous and parodic attack on Hegel in The\nTrumpet of the Last Judgement (1842), and an article on pedagogy\nentitled \u201cThe False Principle of Our Education\u201d (1842).\nThe latter, in particular, adumbrates some of the themes of\nStirner\u2019s own later work; for example, contrasting the training\nof individuals to an alien calling, on the one hand, with the\ncultivation of the predisposition to become \u201csovereign\ncharacters\u201d, on the other. During this period, Stirner is said\nto have occasionally alluded to a book that he was working on, but few\nof his associates took its existence seriously. The impact of The\nEgo and Its Own on these left-Hegelian circles was considerable\nas well as unexpected. Stirner had begun serious work on the book in\nearly 1843 and finished it in the middle of 1844. The Ego and Its\nOwn was published by the Leipzig bookseller Otto Wigand\n(1795\u20131870) in an edition of a thousand copies. Although dated\n1845 the book was widely available by November of the previous\nyear.\n\nMeasured by the reaction that it produced, The Ego and Its\nOwn might be described as a critical success. The book was widely\nreviewed, and attracted attention from well-known figures such as\nBettina von Arnim (1785\u20131859), the doyenne of the Berlin\nliterati, and Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907), later a distinguished\nneo-Kantian historian of philosophy. The book also generated responses\nfrom many of its left-Hegelian targets; Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804\u20131872), Moses Hess (1812\u20131875), Arnold Ruge\n(1802\u20131880), and others, all ventured into print in order to\ndefend their own views against Stirner\u2019s polemic. (Stirner\nreplied to some of these left-Hegelian rejoinders in an article\nentitled \u201cStirner\u2019s Critics\u201d [1845].)\n\nHowever, The Ego and Its Own was neither a popular nor a\nfinancial success. Stirner had left his teaching post shortly before\nthe book was published, and by 1846 he was reduced to advertising in\nthe Vossische Zeitung for a loan. By then, Stirner had also\nsquandered much of his second wife\u2019s inheritance (losing money\non a failed dairy business), and she left him towards the end of the\nsame year. Many years later Marie D\u00e4hnhardt was traced to England\nby Stirner\u2019s loyal biographer, the poet and novelist John Henry\nMackay (1864\u20131933). She refused to meet Mackay in person but\nwrote to him characterising Stirner as a very sly man whom she had\nneither respected nor loved, and describing their relationship\ntogether as more of a cohabitation than a marriage.\n\nFrom 1847, Stirner\u2019s life was characterised by social isolation\nand financial precariousness. He remained detached from contemporary\nevents \u2014 for example, he seems to have largely ignored the\nrevolutions of 1848 \u2014 and his daily life was dominated by\ndomestic routine and economic hardship. Stirner continued to write\nintermittently, but commentators have generally found his later work\nto be of little independent interest; that is, of little interest\napart from its disputed potential to illuminate The Ego and Its\nOwn. He translated into German some of the economic writings of\nJean-Baptiste Say (1767\u20131832) and Adam Smith (1723\u20131790),\nand may have written a series of short journalistic pieces for the\nJournal des oesterreichischen Lloyd. In 1852, he published a\nHistory of Reaction in two parts; a work consisting mainly of\nexcerpts from other authors \u2014 including Edmund Burke\n(1729\u20131797) and Auguste Comte (1898\u20131857) \u2014 excerpts\nwhich are not always easily distinguished from his own occasional\ncommentary. Its intellectual purpose remains uncertain, although there\nare some continuities with Stirner\u2019s critical account of\nrevolution in The Ego and Its Own (Stepelevich 2021:\n161\u2013169). Stirner\u2019s main strategy for economic survival in\nthis period seems to have involved repeatedly changing addresses in\norder to evade his creditors, although not quickly enough to avoid two\nbrief periods in a debtors\u2019 prison in 1853 and 1854.\n\nIn May 1856, still living in reduced circumstances in Berlin, Stirner\nfell into a \u201cnervous fever\u201d, seemingly after being stung\nin the neck by an insect. Following a brief remission, he died on 25\nJune (aged 49 years and 8 months). His death went largely unnoticed by\nthe outside world.\n\nIt might look as if there is a stark contrast between the often\nmelodramatic and provocative tone of Stirner\u2019s best-known work,\non the one hand, and the more mundane, sometimes poignant, events of\nhis own solitary life, on the other. However, commentators often\nstrive to link his life and philosophical views more closely. John\nHenry Mackay, for example, emphasizes the\n\u201cataraxic\u201ddimension of The Ego and Its Own, and\nportrays Stirner\u2019s life as an authentic embodiment of the\nemotional detachment that the egoist must cultivate in order to avoid\nbeing enslaved by their own passions and commitments. Even the pathos\nof Stirner\u2019s death is said to reflect the egoist\u2019s refusal\nto love life, or fear death, excessively (Mackay 1914: 212). Such\nclaims are not without interest, but the lack of direct evidence\nregarding Stirner\u2019s own interior life makes them difficult to\nevaluate and endorse.\n2. The Ego and Its Own\n2.1 Form and Structure\n\nModern readers hoping to understand The Ego and Its Own are\nconfronted by several obstacles, not least the form, structure, and\ncentral arguments, of Stirner\u2019s book.\n\nMuch of Stirner\u2019s prose \u2014 crowded with aphorisms,\nemphases, and hyperbole \u2014 appears calculated to disconcert. Most\nstriking, perhaps, is his use of word play. Rather than reach a\nconclusion through the conventional use of argument, Stirner often\napproaches a claim that he wishes to endorse by exploiting words with\nrelated etymologies or formal similarities. For example, he associates\nwords for property (such as \u201cEigentum\u201d) with\nwords connoting distinctive individual characteristics (such as\n\u201cEigenheit\u201d) in order to promote the claim that\nproperty is expressive of selfhood. (Stirner\u2019s account of\negoistic property \u2014 see 2.4 below \u2014 gives this otherwise\northodox-looking Hegelian claim a distinctive twist.)\n\nThis rejection of conventional forms of intellectual discussion is\nlinked to Stirner\u2019s substantive views about language and\nrationality. His distinctive style reflects a conviction that both\nlanguage and rationality are human products which have come to\nconstrain and oppress their creators. Stirner maintains that accepted\nmeanings and traditional standards of argumentation are underpinned by\na conception of truth as a privileged realm beyond individual control.\nAs a result, individuals who accept this conception are abandoning a\npotential area of creative self-expression in favour of embracing a\nsubordinate role as servants of truth. In stark contrast, Stirner\ninsists that the only legitimate restriction on the form of our\nlanguage, or on the structure of our arguments, is that they should\nserve our individual ends. It is the frequent failure of conventional\nmeanings and received forms of argument to satisfy his interpretation\nof this criterion which underpins the remorselessly idiosyncratic form\nof Stirner\u2019s prose.\n\nThe Ego and Its Own has an intelligible, but scarcely\ntransparent, structure. It is organised around a tripartite account of\nhuman experience, which is first introduced in a description of the\nstages of an individual life. The first stage in this developmental\nnarrative is the realistic one of childhood, in which\nchildren are constrained by material and natural forces such as their\nparents. Liberation from these constraints is achieved with what\nStirner calls the self-discovery of mind, as children find the means\nto outwit those extrenal forces in their own determination and\ncunning. The resulting idealistic stage of youth, however,\ncontains new internal sources of constraint, as individuals once more\nbecome enslaved, this time to the spiritual forces of conscience and\nreason. Only with the adulthood of egoism do individuals\nescape both material (external) and spiritual (internal) constraints,\nlearning to value their personal satisfaction above all other\nconsiderations.\n\nStirner portrays this dialectic of individual growth as an analogue of\nhistorical development, and it is a tripartite account of the latter\nwhich structures the remainder of the book. Human history is reduced\nto three successive epochs of: realism (the ancient, or pre-Christian,\nworld); idealism (the modern, or Christian, world); and egoism (the\nfuture world). Part One of The Ego and Its Own is devoted to\nthe first two of those historical epochs, providing a negative\ncritique of the past. And Part Two is concerned with the third of\nthese epochs, providing a positive account of the future.\n\nIn both individual and historical forms, the second stage of this\ntripartite developmental narrative is presented as a negation of the\nfirst, and the third stage, in turn, as the negation of that negation.\nThe triadic structure of this narrative has been read as confirming\nStirner\u2019s Hegelian formation and commitments (Stepelevich:\n1985), but can also be seen as embodying a self-conscious parody of\nHegelianism. In this context, Stirner has plausibly been understood as\noffering both a provocation and a knowing attempt at humour, utilising\na dialectical structure in order to advance his own anti-Hegelian\nposition (De Ridder: 2008). There is little doubt about the\nprovocation, but assessing Stirner\u2019s seriousness is a harder\ntask.\n2.2 The Ancient and Modern Worlds\n\nPart One of The Ego and Its Own is backward-looking and\nnegative. It is backward-looking in that it is concerned with the\nancient and modern worlds rather than with the future. And it is\nnegative in that its primary aim is to demonstrate the failure of\nmodernity to escape from the very religious modes of thought which it\nclaims to have outgrown. The bulk of Stirner\u2019s genealogical\naccount is devoted to the modern epoch, and the ancient world is only\ndiscussed insofar as it contributes to the genesis of modernity. In\nboth cases, however, the majority of his examples are taken from the\ncultural and intellectual spheres. Cumulatively these examples are\nmeant, not only to undermine historical narratives which portray the\nmodern development of humankind as the progressive realisation of\nfreedom, but also to support an account of individuals in the modern\nworld as increasingly oppressed by the spiritual. For Stirner, the\nsubordination of the individual to spirit \u2014 in any of its guises\n\u2014 counts as a problematic form of religious servitude.\n\nStirner\u2019s account of the historical development of modernity\nlargely revolves around a single event, the Reformation. He attempts\nto show that, from the perspective of the individual, the movement\nfrom Catholic to Protestant hegemony is not a liberating one, but\ninstead constitutes both an extension and intensification of the\ndomination of spirit. The Reformation extends, rather than contracts,\nthe sphere of religious control over the individual because it refuses\nto recognise the distinction between the spiritual and the sensuous.\nRather than preventing priests from marrying, for example,\nProtestantism makes marriage religious, thereby extending the sphere\nof the spiritual to include the sensuous. The Reformation also\nintensifies, rather than relaxes, the bond between individuals and\nreligion. The more inward faith of Protestantism, for example,\nestablishes a perpetual internal conflict between natural impulses and\nreligious conscience. In a typically vivid and combative metaphor,\nStirner describes this internal conflict in the individual \u2014 in\nwhich natural impulses battle with religious conscience \u2014 as\nanalogous to the struggle between the populace and the secret police\nin the contemporary body politic.\n\nStirner\u2019s claim that the modern world reproduces, rather than\nabolishes, religious modes of thought provides the opportunity for a\nsustained attack on the writings of his left-Hegelian contemporaries.\nLudwig Feuerbach, in particular, is singled out for failing to\novercome the subordination of the individual to spirit.\n\nThe centrality of the critique of Feuerbach to Stirner\u2019s project\nis clear from the form of The Ego and Its Own which embodies\na structural parody of Feuerbach\u2019s best-known work. Where the\ntwo halves of Feuerbach\u2019s Das Wesen des Christentums\nhad been entitled God and Man \u2014 with the first\nattacked and the second celebrated \u2014 the two corresponding parts\nof Stirner\u2019s opus are named Man and I. More\nsubstantively, Stirner seeks to challenge the contemporary verdict of\nprogressives concerning Feuerbach\u2019s achievement. Stirner\nmaintains that the contemporary celebration of Feuerbach for having\ncompleted the critique of religion, is not merely mistaken but nearer\nthe opposite of the truth. Far from undermining religion, the\nFeuerbachian problematic is said to reproduce and amplify its central\nfeatures.\n\nFor Feuerbach, the primary error of Christianity is that it takes\nhuman predicates and projects them into another world as if they\nconstitute an independent being. He sees religious belief as a\nnecessary step in the progress of humankind to self-understanding.\nMore precisely, it is through transformative criticism \u2014\nrecovering the correct relation of subject and predicate from its\ninversion in Christianity \u2014 that we first come to understand\nwhat human nature is. Moreover, Feuerbach maintains that, once\nliberated from their otherworldly form, these essential human\ncharacteristics \u2014 and especially perhaps our love for others\n\u2014 would quickly come to form the basis of the unalienated social\nand political life of the future. This emancipatory ambition also\nhelps to clarify Feuerbach\u2019s insistence that he should be seen\nas a friend, and not an enemy, of religion; in particular, he sought\nnot to destroy Christianity, but to liberate its content from\notherworldly forms. This claim is also at the heart of his distinctive\n\u2014 and perhaps idiosyncratic \u2014 denial that he was an\natheist. Feuerbach maintains that true atheism requires the rejection\nnot only of God as subject, but also of those predicates \u2014 love,\nwisdom, justice, and so on \u2014 traditionally associated with\ndivinity.\n\nStirner might be said to pick up this \u2014 perhaps idiosyncratic\n\u2014 characterisation of \u201ctrue atheism\u201d and run with\nit. Stirner maintains that religion, properly understood, is\ncharacterised by the subordination of the individual to\n\u201cspirit\u201d in any of its guises. Consequently, the rejection\nof God as a transcendental subject leaves the essential character and\nfailing of religion intact. Feuerbach\u2019s perfectionist\nproblematic, Stirner remarks, might have altered \u201cthe\ntinsel\u201d (the divine subject) but it leaves \u201cthe main\nthing\u201d (the divine predicates) unchanged (56). (Page references\nin parenthesis are to the 1995 Cambridge edition of The Ego and\nIts Own cited in the Bibliography below.) The sacred is allowed\nto remain, if not as God, then as \u201cMan with a capital\nM\u201d in Byington\u2019s inspired English rendering of\nStirner\u2019s \u201cDer Mensch\u201d. In short, rather\nthan describing human nature as it is, Feuerbach is said to have\ndeified a prescriptive account of what being human involves. As a\nresult, the real kernel of religion, the positing of an \u201cessence\nover me\u201d (46), has been left intact. Indeed, Stirner suggests\nthat Feuerbach\u2019s achievement was to have effected a\n\u201cchange of masters\u201d (55) which actually made the tyranny\nof the divine over the individual even more complete. More complete\nbecause it extends and intensifies domination. It extends domination\nbecause this new deity is no longer the preserve of the faithful, but\ncan possess everyone, believers and unbelievers alike. And it\nintensifies domination because the scrutiny of our own conscience is\nmuch harder to evade than that of a transcendental subject that a\nflutters \u201cover our heads as a dove\u201d (86).\n\nStirner extends this critique to the work of all the left-Hegelians,\nincluding those with whom he had associated in Berlin. Individual\nleft-Hegelians disagree about the content of human nature. Thus for\n\u201cpolitical liberals\u201d like Arnold Ruge human nature is\nidentified with citizenship, for \u201csocial liberals\u201d like\nMoses Hess human nature is identified with labour, and for\n\u201chumane liberals\u201d like Bruno Bauer human nature is\nidentified with critical activity. However, notwithstanding those\ndifferences, all these left-hegelians reproduce the basic Feuerbachian\nerror: separating the individual from their human essence, and then\nsetting that essence above the individual as something to be striven\nfor. In contrast, Stirner maintains that because it has no universal\nor prescriptive content, human nature cannot ground any claim about\nhow we ought to live. His own intellectual project\u2014which he\ndescribes as an attempt to rehabilitate the prosaic and mortal self,\nthe \u201cun-man\u201d(124) for whom the notion of a calling is\nalien\u2014is intended as a radical break with the work of these\ncontemporaries.\n\nIt might seem obvious that Stirner subscribes to a resolutely\nanti-perfectionist position here. However, this reading has been\nchallenged. Stirner certainly rejects what might be called\n\u201cessentialist perfectionism\u201d; that is, those ethical\ntheories which value certain characteristics of the individual\nprecisely because they realise some aspect of human nature. However,\nhe himself continues to embrace a character ideal, a picture of a\nself-ruling individual whose perfection is valuable apart from any\nhappiness or pleasure that it might bring. The Stirnerian egoist must\nnot only avoid submission to external powers, but must also cultivate\na kind of emotional detachment towards their own thoughts and\nfeelings, ensuring that the latter do not subjugate the egoist, or\nmake the egoist an instrument of their own realisation. In short, the\nsuggestion here is that an \u201canti-essentialist\nperfectionism\u201d survives in this ideal of character, in\nStirner\u2019s celebration of the \u201cun-man\u201d and the egoist\n(Leopold 2019).\n2.3 The Egoistic Future\n\nPart Two of The Ego and Its Own is forward-looking and\npositive. It is forward-looking in that it is concerned with the\negoistic future rather than with the ancient or modern worlds. And it\nis positive in that it aims to establish the possibility that\nStirner\u2019s contemporaries can be liberated from the tyranny of\nreligion.\n\nStirner\u2019s account of the developing historical relationship\nbetween the individual and society is advanced in a series of\nparallels which are designed to portray egoism as the embodiment of a\nmore advanced civilisation. At one point, he takes the early modern\nidea of a social contract, in which progress traditionally consists of\na move from an atomistic state of nature to a communal civil society,\nand neatly inverts it. It is membership of society, and not individual\nisolation, Stirner suggests, which is humankind\u2019s \u201cstate\nof nature\u201d (271); that is, an early and problematic stage of\ndevelopment whose inadequacies are, in due course, outgrown.\nElsewhere, he describes the developing relationship between the\nindividual and society as analogous to that between a mother and her\nchild. As the individual (the child) develops a mature preference for\na less suffocating environment, they must throw off the claims of\nsociety (the mother) which seeks to maintain them in a subordinate\nposition. In both cases, Stirner draws the lesson that the individual\nmust move from social to egoistic relationships in order to escape\nsubjection.\n\nWhat is meant by \u201cegoism\u201d, however, is not always clear.\nStirner is occasionally portrayed as a psychological egoist, that is,\nas a proponent of the descriptive claim that all (intentional) actions\nare motivated by a concern for the self-interest of the agent.\nHowever, this characterisation of Stirner\u2019s position can be\nquestioned. Not least, The Ego and Its Own is structured\naround the opposition between egoistic and non-egoistic modes of\nexperience. Indeed, he appears to hold that non-egoistic modes of\nexperience have predominated historically (in the epochs of realism\nand idealism). Moreover, at one point, Stirner appears explicitly to\nconsider adopting the explanatory stance of psychological egoism only\nto reject it. In a discussion of a young woman who sacrifices her love\nfor another in order to respect the wishes of her family, Stirner\nremarks that an observer might be tempted to maintain that selfishness\nhas still prevailed in this case since the woman clearly preferred the\nwishes of her family to the attractions of her suitor. However,\nStirner rejects this hypothetical explanation, insisting that,\nprovided \u201cthe pliable girl were conscious of having left her\nself-will unsatisfied and humbly subjected herself to a higher\npower\u201d (197), we should see her actions as governed by piety\nrather than egoism.\n\nIt would also be a mistake to think of Stirner as advocating a\nnormative proposition about the value of self-interested action as\nordinarily understood. Stirnerian egoism needs to be distinguished\nfrom an individual\u2019s pursuit of conventional self-interest. In\nThe Ego and Its Own, Stirner discusses the important example\nof an avaricious individual who sacrifices everything in pursuit of\nmaterial riches. Such an individual is clearly conventionally\nself-interested (they act only to enrich themselves) but it is an\negoism which Stirner rejects as one-sided and narrow. Stirner\u2019s\nreason for rejecting this form of egoism is instructive. He suggests\nthat the avaricious individual has become enslaved to a single end,\nand that enslavement is incompatible with egoism properly\nunderstood.\n\nStirnerian egoism is then perhaps best thought of, not in terms of the\npursuit of conventional self-interest, but rather as a variety of\nindividual self-rule or autonomy. Egoism properly understood is to be\nidentified with what Stirner calls \u201cownness\n[Eigenheit]\u201d, a type of autonomy which is incompatible\nwith any suspension, whether voluntary or forced, of individual\njudgement. \u201cI am my own\u201d, Stirner writes, \u201conly when\nI am master of myself, instead of being mastered \u2026 by anything\nelse\u201d (153). As previously noted, this Stirnerian ideal of\nself-rule has external and internal dimensions, requiring not only\nthat we avoid subordinating ourselves (externally) to others, but also\nthat we escape (internally) being \u201cdragged along\u201d (56) by\nour own appetites. In short, Stirner not only rejects the legitimacy\nof any subordination to the will of another but also recommends that\nindividuals cultivate an ideal of emotional detachment towards their\nown appetites and projects.\n\nJudged against this account of egoism, characterisations of Stirner as\na \u201cnihilist\u201d\u2014in the sense that he rejects all\nnormative judgement\u2014would also appear to be mistaken. The\npopular but doubtful description of Stirner as a\n\u201cnihilist\u201d is encouraged by his explicit rejection of\nmorality. Morality, on Stirner\u2019s account, involves the positing\nof obligations to behave in certain fixed ways towards others. As a\nresult, he rejects morality as incompatible with egoism properly\nunderstood. However, this rejection of morality is not grounded in the\nrejection of values as such, but in the affirmation of what might be\ncalled the non-moral good of autonomy. That is, Stirner allows that\nthere are actions and desires which, although not moral in his sense\n(because they do not involve obligations to others), are nonetheless\nto be assessed positively. Stirner is clearly committed to the\nnon-nihilistic view that certain kinds of character and modes of\nbehaviour (namely autonomous individuals and actions) are to be valued\nabove all others. His conception of morality is, in this respect, a\nnarrow one, and his rejection of the legitimacy of moral claims is not\nto be confused with a denial of the propriety of all normative or\nethical judgement. There is, as a result, no inconsistency in\nStirner\u2019s frequent use of an explicitly evaluative vocabulary,\nas when, for example, he praises the egoist for having the\n\u201ccourage\u201d (265) to lie, or condemns the\n\u201cweakness\u201d (197) of the individual who succumbs to\npressure from their family.\n\nTwo features of Stirner\u2019s position emerge as fundamental. First,\nhe values \u201cownness\u201d not as one good amongst many, but as\nthe most important good, a good which trumps all others. Second, he\nadopts an account of self-rule which is incompatible with the\nexistence of any legitimate obligations to others, even those which an\nindividual has voluntarily undertaken; thereby rejecting perhaps the\nmost familiar (contractual) way of reconciling individual autonomy\nwith the existence of binding obligations. In short, Stirner appears\nto value individual self-rule above all else, and he interprets that\nindividual self-rule in a stringent and idiosyncratic manner.\n2.4 Some Consequences of Egoism\n\nThe consequences of Stirner\u2019s position look extreme and\nfar-reaching. As the example of morality already suggests, egoists are\nlikely to find themselves in conflict with some cherished social\ninstitutions and practices. Stirner consistently associates\n(non-egoistic) society with relationships of \u201cbelonging\u201d,\nwhich he treats as involving the subjugation of individuals. For\nexample, he maintains that \u201cthe forming of family ties binds a\nman\u201d (102). Stirner never seriously considers the possibility\nthat belonging might, at least potentially or in some cases, have more\npositive associations; for example, of being at home or of feeling\nsecure. Confronted with the conflict between egoism and\n\u201csociety\u201d, Stirner is not prompted to re-examine his\ncommitment to, or understanding of, self-rule, but instead confidently\ndenies the legitimacy of those conventional institutions and\npractices. Two examples of this radical response may noted here.\n\nOn Stirner\u2019s account, there is a necessary antipathy between the\negoistic individual and the state. This inevitable hostility is based\non the conflict between Stirner\u2019s conception of autonomy and any\nobligation to obey the law. \u201cOwn will and the state\u201d, he\nwrites, \u201care powers in deadly hostility, between which no\n\u2018perpetual peace\u2019 is possible\u201d (175). Since\nself-rule is incompatible with, and valued more highly than, any\nobligation to obey the law, Stirner rejects the legitimacy of\npolitical obligation. Note that this rejection stands irrespective of\nthe foundation of that political obligation, and whatever the form of\nthe state. \u201cEvery state\u201d, Stirner insists, \u201cis a\ndespotism, be the despot one or many\u201d (175). Even in the\nhypothetical case of a direct democracy in which a collective decision\nhad been made unanimously, Stirner denies that the egoist would be\nbound by the result. To be bound today by \u201cmy will of\nyesterday\u201d, he maintains, would be to turn my\n\u201ccreature\u201d, that is \u201ca particular expression of\nwill\u201d, into my \u201ccommander\u201d; it would be to freeze my\nwill, and Stirner denies that \u201cbecause I was a fool yesterday I\nmust remain such\u201d (175).\n\nPromise-keeping is another early victim of this commitment to, and\nunderstanding of, self-rule. Stirner associates the institution of\npromising with illegitimate constraint, since the requirement that\nduly made promises be kept is incompatible with his understanding of\nindividual autonomy. Stirner rejects any general obligation to keep\npromises as just another attempt to bind the individual. The egoist,\nhe suggests, must embrace the heroism of the lie, and be willing to\nbreak even his own word \u201cin order to determine himself instead\nof being determined\u201d (210). Note that Stirner\u2019s enthusiasm\nfor lying excludes those who break their word in the service of some\nlarger goal \u2014 as Luther, for example, became unfaithful to his\nmonastic vows for God\u2019s sake \u2014 and is reserved only for\nthose individuals who are willing to break their word for their own\nsake.\n\nAs well as a negative account of the institutions and practices that\negoists must reject as incompatible with autonomy, The Ego and Its\nOwn also contains some positive suggestions about the possible\nshape of egoistic relationships which do not conflict with individual\nself-rule. In particular, Stirner provides a brief sketch of what he\ncalls the \u201cunion of egoists [Verein von\nEgoisten]\u201d (161).\n\nThe egoistic future is said to consist not of wholly isolated\nindividuals but rather in relationships of \u201cuniting\u201d, that\nis, in impermanent connections between individuals who themselves\nremain independent and self-determining. The central feature of the\nresulting \u201cunion of egoists\u201d is that it does not involve\nthe subordination of the individual. The union is \u201ca son and\nco-worker\u201d (273) of autonomy, a constantly shifting alliance\nwhich enables individuals to unite without loss of sovereignty,\nwithout swearing allegiance to anyone else\u2019s \u201cflag\u201d\n(210). This union of egoists constitutes a purely instrumental\nassociation whose good is solely the advantage that the individuals\nconcerned may derive for the pursuit of their individual goals; there\nare no shared final ends and the association is not valued in itself.\nIn his reply to \u201cStirner\u2019s Critics\u201d, he imagines two\npleasingly familiar street scenes to illustrate this model of egoistic\nunion: in the first, children happen upon each other and spontaneously\nengage in the \u201ccomradeship of play\n[Spielkameradschaft]\u201d; and, in the second, Moses Hess\n(one of the critics in question) bumps into friends before all decide\nto adjourn for a drink, not out of loyalty, but in the expectation of\npleasure (Stirner 1914: 295\u20136).\n\nStirner sometimes seems torn as how best to elucidate this basic\naccount of egoistic social relations. At least, in The Ego and Its\nOwn, his elaboration of egoistic relations can appear to\nequivocate between: on the one hand, downplaying the social and\npsychological impact of a shift to egoistic relationships, and on the\nother hand, acknowledging and defending the dramatic and perturbing\nconsequences of such a move.\n\nIn the first, and less predominant, of these moods, Stirner strives to\nmoderate the suggestion that his views might have radical and\nunforeseen consequences. More precisely, he suggests that certain\nfamiliar and worthwhile relationships \u2014 such as\n\u201clove\u201d \u2014 can continue into the egoistic future. This\nsuggestion is presumably aimed at making that egoistic future appear\nless disruptive and more attractive, not least to those attached to\nthese familiar and worthwhile relationships.\n\nThat said, it is far from certain that all of the relevant\nrelationships would survive intact from their reincarnation in\negoistic form. Consider, for example, Stirner\u2019s contrast between\ntwo different kinds of love: the \u201cbad case\u201d where\n\u201cownness\u201d is sacrificed, and the good case of egoistic\nlove in which self-rule is retained. Egoistic love allows the\nindividual to deny themself something in order to enhance the pleasure\nof another, but only because their own pleasure is enhanced as a\nresult. The object of egoistic love, in other words, remains the\nindividual themself. The egoist will not sacrifice their autonomy and\ninterests to another, but rather loves only as long as \u201clove\nmakes me happy\u201d (258). At one point, Stirner characterises this\nrelationship as one in which the individual \u201cenjoys\u201d the\nother (258). The description is a revealing one, since enjoying\nanother person and loving them would appear to be rather different\nmatters. Loving another person in the conventional (and non-egoistic)\nsense might be thought to include the desire to promote the welfare of\nthat person, even when it is not in our interests, or when it\nconflicts with our own wants and happiness. In this respect, it stands\nat some distance from Stirner\u2019s account of egoistic love. The\npoint here is not a terminological one\u2014Stirner rightly cares\nlittle whether we call egoistic love \u201clove\u201d and\n\u201chence stick to the old sound\u201d (261) or whether we invent\na new vocabulary\u2014but rather that a world without this experience\nwould be an unfamiliar and impoverished one. Stirner has not obviously\nsucceeded in establishing that this particular familiar and worthwhile\nrelationship would survive reestablishment on egoistic premises. (For\na more positive verdict, see Cleary 2015.)\n\nIn the second, and more predominant, of these moods, Stirner\ncelebrates the radical and unfamiliar consequences of adopting an\negoistic order. Indeed, in places, he seems to revel in the clam that\nhis views have startling consequences from which few of his readers\nwill take any solace. This is one of the sources of the melodramatic\nand provocative tone that permeates many parts of The Ego and Its\nOwn.\n\nStirner describes the appropriate relation between the egoist and\ntheir objects \u2014 which include, of course, other persons as well\nas things \u2014 as a property relation. The egoist properly stands\nin a relation of \u201cownership\u201d to the wider world. This\nnotion of \u201cegoistic property\u201d is not to be confused with\nmore familiar juridical concepts of ownership (such as private\nproperty or collective ownership). These more familiar forms of\nproperty rest on notions of right, and involve claims to exclusivity\nor constraints on use, which Stirner rejects. Egoistic property is\nrather constituted by the \u201cunlimited dominion\u201d (223) of\nindividuals over the world, by which Stirner appears to mean that\nthere are no moral constraints on how an individual might relate to\nthese persons and things. Stirner sometimes describes the resulting\nassociation between people as involving relationships \u201cof\nutility, of use\u201d (263). The egoist, he suggests, views others as\n\u201cnothing but\u2014my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to\nuse by you\u201d (263). Stirner embraces the stark consequences of\nthis rejection of any general obligation towards others, insisting,\nfor example, that the egoist does not renounce \u201ceven the power\nover life and death\u201d (282). Over the course of the book, Stirner\nvariously declines to condemn the officer\u2019s widow who strangles\nher child (281), the man who treats his sister \u201cas wife\nalso\u201d (45), and the murderer who no longer fears his act as a\n\u201cwrong\u201d (169). In a world in which \u201cwe owe each\nother nothing\u201d (263), it seems that acts of infanticide, incest,\nand murder, might all turn out to be justified.\n\nAt one point, Stirner acknowledges that few readers of The Ego and\nIts Own will draw any comfort from this vision of an egoistic\nfuture, but insists that the welfare of this audience is not of any\ninterest to him. Indeed, Stirner suggests that, if he had been\nmotivated by a concern for others, then he would have had to conceal\nrather than propagate his ideas. As it is, Stirner maintains that even\nif he had believed that these ideas would lead to the \u201cbloodiest\nwars and the fall of many generations\u201d (263) he would still have\ndisseminated them.\n3. Stirner\u2019s Influence\n\nAt the time of his death, Stirner\u2019s brief period of notoriety\nwas long over, his book had been out of print for several years, and\nthere was little sign that his life or work might have any longer term\nimpact.\n\nHowever, in the years since, The Ego and Its Own has been\ntranslated into at least eight languages, and appeared in over one\nhundred editions. Stirner and his work have been associated with a\nhuge variety of causes, including many of which he would have been\nunaware. Stirner has been variously characterised as: a left-Hegelian;\na petit-bourgeois ideologue; a solipsist; a nihilist; the first\npoststructuralist; an existentialist; an individualist anarchist; a\nproto right libertarian; a fascist; and as simply insane (Blumenfeld\n2018: 5\u201310). Interest in the connections between Stirner and\nother thinkers \u2014 both philosophical affinity and historical\ninfluence \u2014 are also strikingly varied. For example, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, Stirner was frequently portrayed\nas a precursor of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900), as having\nanticipated, if not influenced \u2014 it is far from certain that\nNietzsche had read any Stirner \u2014 both the style and substance of\nNietzsche\u2019s work (Carus 1914: 74\u201399). In the 1960s and\nearly 1970s, Stirner was rediscovered as a forerunner of\nexistentialism, whose anti-essentialist concept of the self as a\n\u2018creative nothing\u2019 was portrayed as having affinities with\nthe notion of human nature employed by Jean-Paul Sartre\n(1905\u20131980) (Paterson 1971). More recently, Stirner has been\nidentified as a nascent poststructuralist; linked not least with\nGilles Deleuze (1925\u20131995), who also rejects the idea of a\nuniversal human nature, employs a genealogical critique of humanist\ndiscourses of power and identity, and opposes various forms of\nstate-centric thought (Newman 2009, and Feiten 2019). These parallels\ncan be plausible and interesting, although the sceptic might wonder\nwhether they don\u2019t track intellectual fashion as much as they\nilluminate aspects of Stirner\u2019s own thought.\n\nStirner\u2019s most significant historical influence is perhaps\nthreefold.\n\nFirst, The Ego and Its Own had a destructive impact on the\nconfidence and coherence of Left-Hegelianism. Stirner\u2019s\ninsistence that his radical Hegelian contemporaries had failed to\nbreak with religious modes of thought prompted most of the leading\nleft-Hegelians to defend their own work in public against this attack.\nIn perhaps the most important of these replies, Feuerbach \u2014 who\nappeared defensive and irritated (he suspected Stirner of trying to\nmake his name at Feuerbach\u2019s own expense) \u2014 was widely\nseen as struggling to maintain a besieged and outdated position. Bruno\nBauer also offered a critical response, seeking to defend his own\nphilosophy of self-consciousness against what he saw as\nStirner\u2019s inadequate form of subjectivity (Moggach and de\nRidder, 2013). Stirner replied directly to three of these\nleft-Hegelian reviews \u2014 the defence of Bauer\u2019s\n\u201chumane liberalism\u201d by \u201cSzeliga\u201d (the\npseudonym of Franz Zychlinski (1816\u20131900)); the defence of\nsocialism by Moses Hess; and the defence of Feuerbach by Feuerbach\nhimself \u2014 in an article entitled \u201cStirner\u2019s\nCritics\u201d (1845). In this confident rejoinder, Stirner reiterated\nsome of the central themes of The Ego and Its Own and\nclarified the character of his own commitment to egoism. Stirner may\nalso have provided a final reply to contemporary critics in a\npseudonymous article entitled \u201cThe Philosophical\nReactionaries\u201d, in which the author responds to a young Kuno\nFischer. (The caution is needed since the identification of \u201cG.\nEdward\u201d as Max Stirner is plausible but not incontrovertible.)\n\n\nSecond, Stirner\u2019s work played a related and significant role in\nthe evolution of the thought of Karl Marx. The latter was a\ncontemporary associate of Bauer and his entourage, and was mentioned\nindirectly in a footnote in The Ego and Its Own.\n(Stirner\u2019s footnote treats Marx as a minor, if radical,\nFeuerbachian.) Between 1845 and 1847, Marx collaborated with Friedrich\nEngels (1820\u20131895) on a group of manuscripts now usually called\nThe German Ideology, which included a fierce and sustained\nattack on their erstwhile philosophical contemporaries. Most of these\ntexts were not published at the time, and it was 1932 before this\ncritical engagement with the work of Bauer, Feuerbach, and Stirner,\nappeared fully in print. The account of Stirner contained in the\nso-called The German Ideology takes up over three hundred\npages of the published text \u2014 abridged editions have been known\nto omit much of this dense but fascinating material \u2014 and,\nalthough Marx is remorselessly critical of Stirner\u2019s position,\nit scarcely follows that The Ego and Its Own was without\ninfluence on the former\u2019s ideas. Not least, Stirner\u2019s book\nappears to have been decisive: in motivating Marx\u2019s break with\nthe work of Feuerbach (whose considerable influence on many of\nMarx\u2019s earlier writings is readily apparent); in making Marx\nreconsider the role that concepts of human nature should play in\nsocial and political philosophy; and in forcing Marx to think much\nmore clearly about whether, and in what ways, communism should be\nindividualistic.\n\nThird, and finally, Stirner\u2019s best-known work later became one\nof the founding texts of the political tradition of individualist\nanarchism. The affinity between Stirner and the anarchist tradition\nlies in his endorsement of the claim that the state is an illegitimate\ninstitution. His elaboration of this claim is an interesting and\ndistinctive one (Leopold 2006). For Stirner, a state can never be\nlegitimate, since there is a necessary conflict between individual\nself-rule and the obligation to obey the law (which stirner equates\nwith the legitimacy of the state). Given that individual self-rule\ntrumps any competing consideration, Stirner concludes that the demands\nof the state are not binding on the individual. However, he does not\nthink that individuals have, as a result, any general obligation to\noppose and attempt to eliminate the state (insofar as this is within\ntheir power). Rather the individual should decide in each particular\ncase whether or not to go along with the state\u2019s demands. Only\nin cases where there is a conflict between the autonomy of the egoist\nand the demands of the state, does Stirner recommend seeking to evade\nthe requirements of law. That said, whilst individuals have no duty to\noverthrow the state, Stirner does think that the state will eventually\ncollapse as a result of the wider spread of egoism. The cumulative\neffect of a growing egoistic disrespect for law, he suggests, would be\nto \u201cscuttle\u201d the \u201cship of state\u201d (54).\nAnarchists influenced by Stirner\u2019s individualism and his\nsuspicion of the state can be found in many countries. In Great\nBritain, for example, his ideas influenced Dora Marsden\n(1882\u20131960), and her journals The New Freewoman and\nThe Egoist. In America, James L Walker (1845\u20131904),\nauthor of The Philosophy of Egoism was interested in, and\ninfluenced by, Stirner\u2019s thought, although his best-known\nanarchist admirers in America were in the circle around Benjamin R.\nTucker (1854\u20131939) and the remarkable journal Liberty\n(founded in 1881). (For a defence of the claim that Stirner, Marsden,\nTucker, and others share a theoretical framework, see Welsh 2010.)\nHowever close the connections here, it has often been individualist\nanarchists who have proved most effective at keeping Stirner\u2019s\nideas available, producing and distributing many of the editions and\ntranslations of his work.\n\nStirner is unlikely to have regretted these various disputes about the\nnature and influence of The Ego and Its Own. In considering\nsome diverse interpretative accounts of the Bible, Stirner declines to\nadjudicate between the judgement of the child who plays with the book,\nthe Inca emperor Atahualpa (c.1502\u20131533) who threw it away when\nit failed to speak to him, the priest who praises it as the word of\nGod, and the critic who dissects it as a purely human invention. The\nplurality of interpretations of his own work might similarly have\namused Stirner and encouraged him in his view that there could be no\nlegitimate constraints on the meaning of a text. Stirner certainly\nappears relaxed about the proper interpretation of his own work. He\ninsists that he wrote only to procure an existence in the world for\nhis thoughts, adding that what subsequently happened to those ideas\n\u201cis your affair and does not trouble me\u201d (263).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Stirner", "Works by Stirner in English Translation", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Stirner": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Der Einzige und sein Eigentum</em>, Stuttgart: Philipp Reclam,\n1972.
