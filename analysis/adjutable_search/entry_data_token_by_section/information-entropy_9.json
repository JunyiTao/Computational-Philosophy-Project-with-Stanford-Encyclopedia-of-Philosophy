According to his own comments in (Landauer 1986), it\nappears he believed that logically irreversible operations were a\nnecessary part of a computation and these generated heat. Although it\nwas known to be possible to simulate logically irreversible operations\nwith logically reversible ones, this came with its own cost of\nadditional bits of information needing to be stored. To avoid this\nstorage, and to complete a thermodynamic cycle, required the additional\nbits to be reset to zero, with a corresponding entropy cost.\n\n\nA similar argument was developed from first principles by Penrose\n(1970, Chapters V and VI, with particular reference to VI.3), who had\ndeduced that the Boltzmann entropy could go down on average, but\nonly during macroscopically indeterministic processes. This\nreduction was bounded, such that, if a macroscopically indeterministic\nprocess started in a determinate macrostate of Boltzmann entropy\nS0, and\nproduced distinct macrostates of Boltzmann entropy\nSi, with\nprobability\npi,\n then\nS0 \u2212 \u27e8\u2009Si\u2009\u27e9 \u2264 \u2212k\u2009\u27e8\u2009ln\u2009pi\u2009\u27e9.\nHe further argued this meant that a process which started with\ndistinct macrostates of Boltzmann entropy\nSi, each\noccurring with probability\npi,\ncould not end up in a macrostate with Boltzmann entropy\nSf\nwith certainty, unless\nSf \u2212 \u27e8\u2009Si\u2009\u27e9 \u2265 \u2212k\u2009\u27e8\u2009ln\u2009pi\u2009\u27e9\n as, otherwise, the two processes in succession could lead to a\nmacroscopically\ndeterministic process with decreasing Boltzmann entropy\n(Sf\n<S0).\n\n\nPenrose then directly applied this to the problem of the Szilard\nengine. The insertion of the partition corresponds to a\nmacroscopically indeterministic process. After the insertion the\nmolecule is in one of two possible macrostates, in either case\nreducing the Boltzmann entropy\nby k\u2009ln\u20092. However, this reduction cannot be\ndirectly exploited to\nextract k\u2009T\u2009ln\u20092 heat and leave\nthe molecule in a macrostate occupying the entire box again.  If there\nwas a process which could directly exploit this reduction, it could\ncombine with the insertion of the partition to be a macroscopically\ndeterministic process that reduces the Boltzmann entropy (via the\nextraction of heat from the heat bath). Penrose had already argued,\nfrom first principles, that a macroscopically deterministic process\ncannot reduce the Boltzmann entropy.\n\n\nHe then considered adding a demon, and applied the same argument to\nthe combined system of engine and demon. Now he concluded work can be\nextracted leaving the molecule in a macrostate occupying the entire\nbox, but only by leaving the demon indeterministically in one of a\nnumber of macrostates. The additional statistical entropy of the\nprobability distribution over the demon's macrostates compensates for\nthe entropy reduction in the heat bath. Eliminating the statistical\ndistribution over the demon's states is possible only with the cost of\nan entropy increase in the heat bath.\n\n\nPenrose concluded that the demon needs to measure the location of\nthe molecule, store that location in its memory, and can then extract\nthe work. At the end of the operation, the demon retains the memory of\nwhere the molecule was located, maintaining the indeterministic\noutcome. He considered a demon repeating this process many times,\ngradually filling its memory up with the outcomes of previous\nmeasurements. If the demon's memory is finite, eventually it will run\nout of space, leading to one of two possibilities: either the demon\nceases to be able to operate or the demon must reset some of its memory\nback to zero, which requires a corresponding increase in Boltzmann\nentropy elsewhere.\n\n\nPenrose's solution was effectively rediscovered independently by\nBennett (1982), after Bennett had demonstrated that logically\nreversible computation could avoid the necessity of storing large\nquantities of additional information (Bennett 1973). Bennett presented\nan explicit physical model for reversible measurement. In logical\nterms, he represented a measurement by the state of a measuring system\nbecoming correlated to the state of the measured system. The measuring\nsystem starts in a fixed state (which can be taken to be logical state\nzero) and moves through a correlated interaction, into a copy of the\nlogical state, zero or one, of the system being measured. For\n(measuring system, measured system), a combined input logical state of\n(zero, zero) is left unaffected with the output logical state (zero,\nzero), while a combined input logical state of (zero, one) becomes the\noutput logical state (one, one). As the combined output state can be\nused to uniquely identify the combined input state, the operation is\nlogically reversible.\n\n\nFor the physical process, Bennett made the molecule in the Szilard\nengine diamagnetic and the measuring device a one domain ferromagnet\nwith a fixed initial polarisation. With careful manipulation, he argued\nit is possible to use the perturbation of the magnetic field by the\ndiamagnet, to correlate the polarisation of the ferromagnet\nnon-dissipatively to the diamagnet's location on one side or other of\nthe engine. By the same kind of manipulation, he argued that to reset\nthe polarisation of the ferromagnet to its initial state\nwithout using the correlated location of the diamagnet, there\nis a cost of k\u2009T\u2009ln\u20092 in heat\ngeneration, in accordance with Landauer's principle. Extracting work\nfrom the Szilard engine allows the diamagnetic molecule to move freely\nthroughout the engine, so losing the correlation. The heat generating\nreset operation is then the only way to restore the ferromagnet to its\ninitial polarisation.\n\n\nWith the ferromagnet representing the demon's memory, Bennett had\ngiven an explicit counter-example to the arguments of Szilard and\nBrillouin, that measurement is necessarily dissipative. At the same\ntime he argued that the process of resetting the demon's memory is a\nnecessarily logically irreversible step, which incurs the heat\ngeneration cost identified by Landauer, and this cost saves a modified\nform of the second law. Although Bennett gave a particular model for\nresetting the demons memory, no direct proof was given that there can\nbe no better way. Unlike Penrose's argument, Landauer's principle seems\nto be assumed, rather than derived.\n\n\nSupporters of this resolution argue that the demonless engines of\nPopper et. al. are also examples of this kind of process. In each case\nof a demonless engine, there is another mechanism that is left in one\nof two distinct possible states after the work is extracted, depending\nupon which side of the box the molecule was located. In the case of the\nPopper-Szilard engine, the partition is on the left or right hand side\nand a different weight has been lifted. This state still encodes the\ninformation about which outcome occurs. To truly have completed a\ncycle, reliably, it is necessary to restore the partition to the centre\nof the box, regardless of the side to which it moved, and to have a\ndefinite, single weight raised. If Landauer's principle is correct,\nthis is a resetting operation and necessarily incurs a cost that, on\naverage, offsets the work extracted from the operation of the\nengine.\n",
