    "main_text": "Being and Nothingness || Bad faith and the critique of Freudian psychoanalysis\n4.2 Bad faith and the critique of Freudian psychoanalysis\n\nSartre\u2019s account of bad faith (mauvaise foi) is of\nmajor interest. It is said to be a phenomenon distinctive of the\nfor-itself, thus warranting ontological treatment. It also feeds into\nquestions to do with self-knowledge (see Moran 2001), as well as\nserving as the basis for some of his criticisms of racism and\ncolonialism in his later work. His account of bad faith juxtaposes a\ncritique of Freud with its own \u201cdepth\u201d interpretive\naccount, \u201cexistential psychoanalysis\u201d, which is itself\nindebted to Freud, as Sartre admits. \n\nWe will start with Sartre\u2019s critique of Freud, which is both\nsimple and complex, and features in the early parts of the chapter on\nbad faith in Being and Nothingness. In short, Freud\u2019s\ndiffering meta-psychological pictures (Conscious, Preconscious,\nUnconscious, or Id, Ego, Superego) are charged with splitting the\nsubject in two (or more) in attempting to provide a mechanistic\nexplanation of bad faith: that is, how there can be a\n\u201cliar\u201d and a \u201clied to\u201d duality within a single\nconsciousness. But Sartre accuses Freud of reifying this structure,\nand rather than adequately explaining the problem of bad faith, he\nargues that Freud simply transfers the problem to another level where\nit remains unsolved, thus consisting in a pseudo-explanation (which\ntoday might be called a \u201chomuncular fallacy\u201d). Rather than\nthe problem being something that pertains to an embodied subject, and\nhow they might both be aware of something and yet also repress it at\nthe same time, Sartre argues that the early Freudian\nmeta-psychological model transfers the seat of this paradox to the\ncensor: that is, to a functional part of the brain/mind that both\nknows and does not know. It must know enough in order to efficiently\nrepress, but it also must not know too much or nothing is hidden and\nthe problematic truth is manifest directly to consciousness.\nFreud\u2019s \u201cexplanation\u201d is hence accused of\nrecapitulating the problem of bad faith in an ostensible mechanism\nthat is itself \u201cconscious\u201d in some paradoxical sense.\nSartre even provocatively suggests that the practice of psychoanalysis\nis itself in bad faith, since it treats a part of ourselves as\n\u201cId\u201d-like and thereby denies responsibility for it. That\nis not the end of Sartre\u2019s story, however, because he ultimately\nwants to revive a version of psychoanalysis that does not pivot around\nthe \u201cunconscious\u201d and these compartmentalised models of\nthe mind. We will come back to that, but it is first necessary to\nintroduce Sartre\u2019s own positive account of bad faith.\n\nWhile bad faith is inevitable in Sartre\u2019s view, it is also\nimportant to recognise that the \u201cgerm of its destruction\u201d\nlies within. This is because bad faith always remains at least partly\navailable to us in our own lived-experience, albeit not in a manner\nthat might be given propositional form in the same way as knowledge of\nan external object. In short, when I existentially comprehend that my\nlife is dissatisfying, or even reflect on this basis that I have lived\nan inauthentic life, while I am grasping something about myself (it is\ngiven differently to the recognition that others have lived a lie and\nmore likely to induce anxiety), I am nonetheless not strictly\nequivalent or identical with the \u201cI\u201d that is claimed to be\nin bad faith (cf. Moran 2001). There is a distanciation involved in\ncoming to this recognition and the potential for self-transformation\nof a more practical kind, even if this is under-thematised in\nBeing and Nothingness.\n\nSartre gives many examples of bad faith that remain of interest. His\nmost famous example of bad faith is the caf\u00e9 waiter who plays\nat being a caf\u00e9 waiter, and who attempts to institutionalise\nthemselves as this object. While Sartre\u2019s implied criticisms of\ntheir manner of inhabiting the world might seem to disparage social\nroles and affirm an individualism, arguably this is not a fair reading\nof the details of the text. For Sartre we do have a factical\nsituation, but the claim is that we cannot be wholly reduced to it. As\nSartre puts it: \n\n\nThere is no doubt I am in a sense a caf\u00e9 waiter\u2014otherwise\ncould I not just as well call myself a diplomat or reporter? But if I\nam one, this cannot be in the mode of being-in-itself. I am a waiter\nin the mode of being what I am not. (Sartre 1943 [1956: 60])\n\n\n\nIn subsequent work, racism becomes emblematic of bad faith, when we\nreduce the other to some ostensible identity (e.g., Anti-semite\nand the Jew).\n\nIt is important to recognise that no project of\n\u201csincerity\u201d, if that is understood as strictly being what\none is, is possible for Sartre given his view of the for-itself.\nLikewise, in regard to any substantive self-knowledge that might be\nachieved through direct self-consciousness, our options are limited.\nOn Sartre\u2019s view we cannot look inwards and discover the truth\nabout our identity or our own bad faith through simple introspection\n(there is literally no-thing to observe). Moreover, when we have a\nlived experience, and then reflect on ourselves from outside (e.g.,\nthird-personally), we are not strictly reducible to that Ego that is\nso posited. We transcend it. Or, to be more precise, we both are that\nEgo (just as we are what the Other perceives) and yet are also not\nreducible to it. This is due to the structure of consciousness and the\narguments from Transcendence of the Ego examined in\n section 2.\n In Being and Nothingness, the temporal aspects of this\nnon-coincidence are also emphasised. We are not just our past and our\nobjective attributes in accord with some sort of principle of\nidentity, because we are also our \u201cprojects\u201d, and these\nare intrinsically future oriented.\n\nNonetheless, Sartre argues that it would be false to conclude that all\nmodes of inhabiting the world are thereby equivalent in terms of\n\u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d. Rather, there are\nwhat he calls \u201cpatterns of bad faith\u201d and he says these\nare \u201cobjective\u201d. Any conduct can be seen from two\nperspectives\u2014transcendence and facticity, being-for-itself and\nbeing-for-others. But it is the exclusive affirmation of one or the\nothers of these (or a motivated and selective oscillation between\nthem) which constitutes bad faith. There is no direct account of good\nfaith in Being and Nothingness, other than the enigmatic\nfootnote at the end of the book that promises an ethics. There are\nmore sustained treatments of authenticity in his Notebooks for an\nEthics and in Anti-semite and Jew (see also the entry on\n authenticity).\n",
