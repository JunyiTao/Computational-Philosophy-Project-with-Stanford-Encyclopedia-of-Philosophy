Appreciating Artworks in Digital Media\n\nReflection on the kinds and significance of choices available to an\nartist contributes to a full appreciation of the artist\u2019s work.\nFor any artwork, appreciation begins with recognition of its status as\na work, the product of artistic activity of some kind, and\nthus something to be appreciated as the achievement of an artist or\ngroup of artists. Most commonly, this achievement is understood in\nterms of the aesthetically significant effects achieved by an artist\nwith certain kinds of tools and materials and in light of certain\nappreciative conventions. In other words, the achievement is always\nrelative to an artistic medium. Returning to the case of an artist\nchoosing what to do about the inherent replicability of digital\nimagery, another way of thinking about this choice is in terms of the\nartist recognizing the limits and capacities of their chosen medium.\nImages conveyed digitally are always replicable and so when an artist\naims to convey artistic content through digital imagery, they either\nhave to accept the inevitable multiplicity of their works or resist\nthe tendency of the medium and somehow specify the work\u2019s\nsingularity in presentation. At a more fine-grained level, our\nappreciation of particular effects\u2014of color and composition,\nexpression, narrative structure, and so on\u2014depends on the\neffects themselves but also on background acknowledgment of their\ndegree of difficulty or innovation in the relevant medium. The\nproduction of digital art relies on the computer automation of many of\nthe tasks, both manual and cognitive, traditionally involved in making\nart. The effects achieved by computer automation cannot be assessed in\nthe same way as those achieved by traditional \u201chands-on\u201d\nartistic methods. The terms of our appreciation, therefore, need to be\nadjusted in the digital age. This is certainly compatible with the\ncontinued relevance of medium-based appreciation, as long as we can\nmake sense of digital media as artistic media (Binkley 1998). But\nthere is a strong tendency in film and media studies to assume that\nthe medium has absolutely no role to play in the appreciation of\ndigital art.\n\nSumming up this view, it supposedly follows from the fact that modern\n(digital) computers encode every kind of information in the same\nway\u2014i.e., as a sequence of binary digits\u2014that a digital\nartwork is no longer defined by its mode of presentation, whether in\nimages, moving images, sound patterns, or text. A work\u2019s display\nis rendered merely contingent by the fact that it is generated from a\ncommon code. By adding a particular instruction to the code sequence\nspecifying a work, imagery associated with that work could be\ninstantaneously converted into sounds or text, or just into different\nimagery. This possibility alone supposedly renders meaningless all\ntalk of an artwork being in a particular medium and being properly\nappreciated in terms of that medium (Kittler 1999; Doane 2007).\n\nGiven the considerable effects of digital technology on artistic\nproduction, it is perhaps understandable that some commentators are\ninclined toward a radical overhauling of art theoretical concepts. But\ntheir arguments in support of such an overhaul are, at best,\nincomplete. We see this once we cite some important continuities\nbetween ways of making and thinking about art in the analog age and in\nthe digital age. It has always been the case, for example, that\n\u201cany medium can be translated into any other\u201d (Kittler\n1999: 1): Without using a computer, someone could manually devise a\nset of rules (an algorithm) for the translation of image values, say,\ninto sounds or text. Moreover, a common storage and transmission means\nfor (moving) imagery and sound is not unique to digital technology: As\nDoron Galili points out (2011), electronic image transmission going\nback to the late nineteenth century\u2014in other words, precursors\nof the TV\u2014relies on the conversion of both images and sound into\nelectronic pulses.\n\nApart from these important continuities, the media theorist\u2019s\ninference from translatability to medium-free art simply does not\nhold. That we could set about \u201ctranslating\u201d the imagery of\nSeven Samurai into a symphony does not mean that the original\nartwork lacks a medium; it is a film, after all, and as such, it has\nto be in the medium of moving images. The symphonic translation of\nSeven Samurai is not the same work as the 1954 film by Akira\nKurosawa. This reminds us that, in deciding whether there is a digital\nmedium, we must not reduce the medium to the artist\u2019s materials,\nfor it also matters how the artist uses those materials. Nor must we\nlimit the constitutive materials of a medium to physical materials.\nThe case of literature shows that neither the materials of an art\nform, nor their modes of manipulation, need be physical. The medium of\nliterature is neither paper and ink nor abstract lexical symbols, but\nletters and words used in certain ways. There are, of course, many\ndifferent ways of physically storing and transmitting literary works,\nincluding by the printed page, in audio recordings, and by memory\n(human or computer). But from the fact that David Copperfield\ncan be preserved in many different formats, it does not follow that\nthis novel is any less decisively a novel and, as such, in the medium\nof literature.\n\nJust as with a literary work, the preservation and transmission of\ndigital works in different formats depends on the use of a common\ncode, but a binary numeric code rather than a lexical one. As we have\nseen, words and their literary uses constitute the medium of\nliterature. In the same way, binary code, along with the information\nit implements, and its artistic uses constitute the medium of digital\nart. This allows for the possibility that the digital medium contains\nvarious sub-media, or \u201cnested\u201d media (Gaut 2010). For\ninstance, within the medium of digital art, the medium of digital\nvisual art comprises artistic uses of computer code specifically to\ncreate images. In technical terms, such uses can be referred to as\n(artistic) \u201cbitmapping\u201d, given that a computer ultimately\nstores all images (2D and 3D vector) as bitmaps, which are code\nsequences specifying the integers assigned to light intensity\nmeasurements in a pixel grid. The medium of bitmapping is thus\ndistinguished by a kind of digital technology, but the kind used to\nproduce just those items belonging to the traditional medium of\nimages.\n\nOnce the notion of digital media is revealed to be no more confused or\nmysterious than the familiar notion of literary media, its irreducible\nrole in appreciation becomes apparent. To take just one example,\nproper appreciation of films in the digital age depends on recognizing\nthat digital filmmaking tools do not just make traditional filmmaking\neasier; they also present new creative possibilities and challenges.\nGiven the maturity and mass-art status of the cinematic art form, it\nis easy to take for granted the medium of moving imagery; we may think\nwe know exactly what its limits are, and we may even think we have\nseen everything that can be done with it. The digital medium is\ndifferent, however, and digital cinema is in both the medium of moving\nimagery and the digital medium.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to speak of\n\u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201climits\u201d in relation to\ndigital processes, which allow for instantaneous and endless\nmodification with increasingly user-friendly applications and devices.\nThe high degree of automation in the process of capturing an image\nwith a digital video camera, along with increasingly high image\nresolution and memory capacity, could make it seem as though digital\nimages are too easily achieved to be interesting. Then there are the\npractically endless possibilities for \u201ccorrecting\u201d the\ncaptured image with applications like Photoshop. When we take a photo\nor video on our smartphones, an AI program automatically optimizes\nfocus, contrast, and detail. Digital sound recording is likewise\nincreasingly automated, increasingly fine-grained, and reliant on\never-larger computer memory capacities. Modifying and mastering\nrecorded sound with digital editing software allows for an unlimited\ntesting of options. In digital film editing, sequence changes are\ninstantaneous and entirely reversible\u2014quite unlike when the\nediting process involved the physical cutting and splicing of a film\n(image or sound) strip. Digital tools thus allow filmmakers to focus\n(almost) purely on the the look and sound of the movie without having\nto worry about the technical difficulty or finality of\nimplementation.\n\nRather than dismissing all digital works as too easily achieved to be\ninteresting, medium-based appreciation requires that we consider the\ndigital on its own terms. This means we must allow for the possibility\nthat certain kinds of increased technical efficiency can bring new\ncreative risks. For example, even though committing to certain\neditorial decisions does not entail irreversible alterations to a\nfilmstrip, arriving at those decisions involves sifting through and\neliminating far more options, a process which can easily become\noverwhelming and therefore more error-ridden. When we properly\nappreciate a digital film, part of what we need to appreciate is the\nsignificance of any scene or sequence looking just the way it does\nwhen it could have, so easily, looked many other ways. Similarly, when\nwe properly appreciate an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame, we are, in part, appreciating certain representations,\nfunctions, and capabilities of the input-output system, made possible\nby digital media. This is undeniably a form of medium-based\nappreciation and the medium to which we appeal is digital. It is only\nwhen we think of a digital film as in a digital medium that we can\nappreciate it as a particular response to the creative problem,\nintroduced by coding, of finalizing selections from a vast array of\nequally and instantly available options.\n\nThe case of digital cinema is perhaps a useful starting point for work\nin the philosophy of digital art. Digital cinema is a multi-media art\nform, after all, involving 2D and 3D moving images as well as sound.\nIt also has the potential for robust interactivity, whereby audiences\nselect story events or otherwise modify a film screening in prescribed\nways (Gaut 2010: 224\u201343). Many of the digital tools developed by\nthe film and video game industries are now available more widely to\nartists interested in making other forms of digital art, including net\nart, digital sound installations, and virtual reality art (Grau 2003;\nChalmers 2017; Tavinor 2019). In terms of how the use of these tools\naffects proper appreciation, there are important continuities between\nthe filmmaking context and the wider digital art world. In addition,\nthe philosophy of film is a well-established subfield in aesthetics,\none that engages with both film theory and cognitive science in order\nto explicate the nature of film as a mass art (Thomson-Jones 2014,\nOther Internet Resources). For many of the standard topics in the\nphilosophy of film, interesting and important questions arise when we\nextend the discussion from analog to digital cinema. There is a\nquestion, for example, about the kinds and significance of realism\nthat can be achieved with traditional celluloid film as compared with\nmanipulated digital imagery (Gaut 2010: 60\u201397). The philosophy\nof film can provide some of the initial terms of analysis for artworks\nin a broad range of digital media. At the same time, it is important\nto approach each of the digital arts on their own terms under the\nassumption that the digital is an artistically significant\ncategory.\n",
