    "main_text": "The Special Theory of Relativity || Chronogeometrical Fatalism Again\n3.2 Chronogeometrical Fatalism Again\n\nWe have said much about the relativity of simultaneity but little\nabout the invariance of the speed of light. We now rectify that\nsituation.\n\nImagine that at some point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) of the spacetime an\nidealized point-sized flashbulb flashes for (literally) an instant. It\nfollows from the invariance of the speed of light in all directions\nthat Alice, passing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as above, will find herself\nat the center of an expanding sphere of photons. The radius of the\nsphere expands with speed \\(c\\). (It follows that Bob,\nalso passing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) but moving with some constant\nvelocity with respect to Alice, must find himself also at the center\nof such a sphere, even though he and Alice are moving away from each\nother. Such is relativistic life!) If we try to diagram this\nsituation, it is helpful to suppress one spatial dimension, as we have\nin all the figures above, and so the two-dimensional cut through the\nexpanding sphere looks like an expanding circle, which becomes a cone\nwhen that growth is plotted vertically up the diagram (and so is\ncalled the light cone.) More precisely, this figure is just\nhalf the light cone. If two photons (restricting ourselves to two\ndimensions now) converged on point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) from opposite\ndirections, the lines indicating their histories would mark the other\nhalf, the past lobe, of the light\n cone.[9]\n\nLight cones exist at each point of the spacetime and are invariant\nstructures. Since the speed of light is an invariant quantity, all\n\u201cobservers\u201d agree as to which points of the spacetime are\nilluminated by the popping of the flashbulb at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\nFurthermore, as special relativity is standardly understood, the speed\nof light is a limiting speed. No material particle can be accelerated\nfrom a speed less than \\(c\\) to a speed equal to or\ngreater than \\(c\\). Electromagnetic radiation\n(including light) always propagates in a vacuum at speed \\(c\\).\n(To see why \\(c\\) is held to be\nlimiting speed, see Mermin (1968, Chapter 15) and Nahin (1999, pp.\n342\u2013353 and Tech Note 7.) Given these suppositions, the light\ncone structure divides all spacetime into three distinct sorts of\nregions relative to each spacetime point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). (See chapters\n5 and 6 of Geroch (1978) for a thorough discussion.)\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Light Cone\n\n\nFirst, there are the points from which a photon (travelling at speed\n\\(c\\), of course) may reach \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) or which\n(like \\(\\mathbf{A})\\) may be reached by a photon from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\nWe say that these points are lightlike separated from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\n\nSecond, there are the points inside (rather than on) the future or\npast light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that these points are\ntimelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is\na point in the spacetime timelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and\nfuture to it (that is, inside \\(\\mathbf{O}\\)\u2019s future light\ncone), then a material particle travelling at some relativistically\nacceptable speed (that is, less than \\(c)\\) can travel from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Similarly, a material particle at a\npoint like \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) inside the past light cone of\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), can travel at some speed less than \\(c\\)\nfrom \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\n\nFinally, there are the points of the spacetime that are neither in nor\non the light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that such points are\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), then neither a light signal\nnor a material body can travel from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)\nor vice versa, because such travel would require superluminal\nspeed. If one makes the natural assumption that information and causal\ninfluence are propagated by electromagnetic signals and material\nparticles, then if \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is spacelike separated from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), events or occurrences at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can have no\ncausal influence at all on events at \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), and vice\nversa.\n\nWe have reached this last conclusion by means of quite straightforward\nreasoning from the invariance of the speed of light. But consider the\nfollowing observation of Torretti (1983, p. 247):\n\nBefore Einstein \u2026 nobody appears to have seriously disputed\nthat any two events might be causally related to each other,\nregardless of their spatial and temporal distance. The denial of this\nseemingly modest statement is perhaps the deepest innovation in\nnatural philosophy brought about by Relativity. It has completely\nupset our traditional views of time, space, and causality \u2026\n\n\nAs one illustration of how our traditional views of time and causality\nare upset by restricting the propagation of causal influence to the\nlight cone structure, let us revisit the reasoning of the example of\nthe Andromedean invasion that we used to illustrate and motivate\nchronogeometrical fatalism. We may be able to see now that this\nreasoning is not so compelling as it first seemed, and we may be able\nto see why some philosophers have proposed that we look at becoming in\nMinkowski spacetime in a way quite different from the traditional\nway.\n\nTo make the exposition easier, let us add to the story of the\nAndromedean invasion a fourth \u201cobserver\u201d, Ted, who is at\nrest with respect to Earth (and so also Andromeda) at the spot where\nAlice and Bob meet. Ted too defines an inertial frame, and there is a\npoint at Andromeda (We can call it \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) that (in\nTed\u2019s frame) is simultaneous with the meeting of Alice and Bob\nand Ted. To make our exposition easier still, let us suppose that\nAlice and Bob and Ted set their clocks to read 0 at the instant at\nwhich they all\n meet.[10]\n Let us focus on \\(\\mathbf{D}\\).\n\nTed (at the meeting of Alice and Bob) assigns to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) the\ntime 0, since it is simultaneous (in his frame) with his time 0. Alice\nassigns \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) (roughly) the time \\(-3\\) days, whereas Bob\nassigns it time (roughly) \\(+3\\) days. \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is, of course,\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), and we have been at pains to\nexplain that from a special relativistic standpoint this spacelike\nseparation precludes the (physical) possibility that there is any\ncausal influence upon \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) of the events at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nor vice versa. Once the labelling of spacetime points like\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) with coordinates is complete, what further content is\nthere, what further could be meant, by adding that for Alice and Ted\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is real or fixed? Or that for Alice it is past whereas\nfor Bob it is future? If there is indeed no further content, then what\npossible implications with regard to \u2018reality\u2019 or\n\u2018fixity\u2019 or \u2018determinateness\u2019 or\n\u2018tense\u2019 can be drawn from the fact that Bob labels this\npoint with a positive number, Alice labels it with a negative number,\nand Ted labels it with\n 0?[11]\n\nAny good text in special relativity will sooner or later prove that\nfor any pair of spacelike separated points (but let us\ncontinue to call them \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) there is\nprecisely one admissible inertial frame (with \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as\norigin) in which \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) are simultaneous,\nan infinity of admissible inertial frames in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is\nassigned a positive number (that is, in which \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) occurs\nbefore \\(\\mathbf{D})\\), and an infinity of other admissible inertial\nframes in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is assigned a negative number (that is,\nin which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) occurs before \\(\\mathbf{O})\\). What\nmetaphysical significance could be gleaned from the fact that some\n\u201cobservers\u201d (the usual anthropomorphized way to refer to\nadmissible inertial frames) at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) must assign positive\ntimes, some negative times, and one time 0 to the distant event\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\), which, again, can not be influenced by and can not\nitself influence the events at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), according to special\nrelativity at least?\n\nInability to provide any positive answer to this question can motivate\na different approach to conceptualizing becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime, an approach presented by the philosopher Howard Stein\n(1968, 1991). The basic idea of this approach is to begin from or to\ndefine concepts in terms of the geometric structure intrinsic to the\nspacetime rather than in terms of coordinates. In the present case,\nthis approach leads one to try to define \u2018becoming\u2019 in\nterms of spacetime points and light cones. Pre-relativistically,\n\u2018has become\u2019 is defined relative to a plane of\nsimultaneity. We have seen the limitations of the notion of a plane of\nsimultaneity in special relativity in our discussion of the relativity\nof simultaneity. Stein begins, then, by proposing that one define the\nrelation of \u2018having become\u2019 or \u2018already\ndefinite\u2019 with respect to spacetime points. A two-place relation\nschematically written as \\(Rxy\\) will be intended to capture the idea\nthat point \\(y\\) has already become or is definite with\nrespect to point \\(x\\).\n\nThere are two other formal features that this relation \\(R\\)\nshould possess. It should be\ntransitive\u2014that is, if \\(z\\) has already\nbecome with respect to \\(y\\) and \\(y\\)\nhas already become with respect to \\(x\\), then it seems\nreasonable to require that \\(z\\) has already become\nwith respect to \\(x\\). It should also be\nreflexive\u2014that is, is seems reasonable to require that\n\\(x\\) has become with respect to \\(x\\)\nitself. (We can indicate these conditions briefly as (1) \\(Rzy\\) and\n\\(Rxz\\) entail \\(Rxy\\), for all \\(x, y, z\\) and (2) \\(Rxx\\), for all\n\\(x\\).)\n\nFinally, Stein proposes that the relation \\(R\\) not\nhold between every two points in the spacetime. That is, he proposes\nthat given some choice of spacetime point \\(x\\), there\nis at least one distinct point \\(y\\) that has not\nbecome, that is not already definite, with respect to \\(x\\).\nBut is there a relation that has all these\nintuitively desirable characteristics? The answer is yes. The\nrelation is that between a point \\(x\\) and each point\nin or on its past light\n cone.[12]\n If one can accept that the relation \\(Rxy\\) represents in special\nrelativity the notion of becoming (or, having become), then the\nexistence of the relation specified and found by Stein is a formal\nrefutation of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument for chronogeometric\nfatalism.\n\nThat chronogeometric fatalism (or, the block universe) is refuted is,\nof course, controversial. Is the relation that Stein calls\nbecoming, or having become, a genuine notion of becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime? Stein points out that if its true for his relation R that\nthere is even one point or event x such that there is another point or\nevent y such that both Rxy and Ryx are true, then R must be the\nuniversal\n relation.[13]\n That is, it would follow that Rxy for all x and y. If, then, one\nthinks of the present as a set of events that have become for each\nother but that not all events have become, then it follows that\n\u201cin Einstein-Minkowski space-time an event\u2019s present is\nconstituted by itself alone.\u201d (Stein, 1968, p. 15)\n\nIs this an acceptable view? Callender (2000, S592) remarks that\nrequiring that an event\u2018s present must contain at least one\nevent distinct from it, which he calls the non-uniqueness\ncondition, \u201cseems the thinnest requirement one might put on\nbecoming.\u201d He would then not accept Stein\u2019s relation \\(R\\)\nas representing a genuine relation of becoming since\nit fails to meet this condition, but then he also must accept the\nconclusion of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument, since the only\nalternative to \\(R\\) is the universal relation. If one\nwishes to evade chronogeometric fatalism, as far as the special theory\nof relativity is concerned, then it seems there is no alternative to\naccepting Stein\u2019s relation \\(R\\) as representing\na genuine relation of becoming and to considering that an\nevent\u2019s present is constituted by itself alone. It is a truism\nthat the relativistic revolution in physics has profound implications\nfor our concepts of space and time. This last dilemma supports that\ntruism.\n\nThere may seem to be another obstacle to accepting Stein\u2019s\nrelation \\(R\\) as representing a genuine relation of\nbecoming. \\(R\\) is supposed to represent becoming, but\nthe light cone structure of Minkowski spacetime, in terms of which it\nis defined, is inert. This reaction was voiced, for instance, by Palle\nYourgrau, who wrote that \u201cStein\u2019s mistake is to adduce a\nstructural property as what \u2018justifies the use of our\nnotion of \u201dbecoming\u201c in relativistic\nspacetime.\u201d\u2019 (1999, p. 77) If Yourgrau has put his finger\non a \u201cmistake\u201d, then it is a \u201cmistake\u201d at the\nvery heart of Stein\u2019s effort. There are, however, a few remarks\nto be made on this score.\n\nFirst, there have been attempts to articulate positions like\nStein\u2019s that try to account for passage in terms of geometric\nstructure and that seem to incorporate more dynamic elements,\nexploiting the fact that persistent objects or substances (including\n\u201cobservers\u201d) are represented by timelike world lines,\nrather than by points. The mathematician G. J. Whitrow (1980, p. 348)\nwrote:\n\nAt a given instant \\(E\\) on the world line of an\nobserver \\(A\\) (who need not be regarded as anything\nmore than a recording instrument), all the events from which \\(A\\)\ncan have received signals lie within the\nbackwards-directed light cone with its vertex at \\(E\\ldots\\) . Signals\nfrom events [outside the light cone at \\(E\\)] can only\nreach \\(A\\) after the event \\(E\\), and\nwhen they do reach \\(A\\) they will then lie within \\(A\\)\u2019s\nbackward-directed light cone at that instant.\nThe passage of time corresponds to the continual advance of this light\ncone.\n\n\nThe physicist-philosopher Abner Shimony, in responding to the claim\nthat special relativity shows that becoming is subjective or\n\u201cmind-dependent,\u201d wrote (1993, p. 284):\n\nSomething fleeting does indeed traverse the world line, but that\nsomething is not subjective; it is the transient now, which\nas a matter of objective fact is momentarily present and thereafter is\npast.\n\n\nIn the felicitous phrase of Park (1971), we have here two different\nsorts of animated Minkowski diagrams. Each seems to involve a\nkind of motion, of the light cone or of the transient now\nadvancing along a world line. Our initial restrictions on accounts of\ntransience inspired by Broad\u2019s arguments above, however, should\nmake us wary of invoking motion to account for passage. Park,\nmoreover, sees no benefit to adding the animation.\n\nI want now to make the vital point that the animated diagram may be\nmore intuitive, or more picturesque, or make better cinema than the\natemporal one, but that it contains no more specific, verifiable\ninformation. All of the science of dynamics, that is, all we know\nabout how complex systems (including ourselves) behave and interact,\nis already represented on the atemporal Minkowski diagram.\n\n\nThe non-animated Minkowski diagram may be \u201cstatic\u201d, but,\nas Park points out, the static diagram represents the\nevolution in (proper) time of systems along their world lines. The\ndiagram, if Park is correct, need not itself be animated to represent\ndynamical phenomena. If Park is correct, then what Yourgrau called a\n\u201cmistake\u201d is in fact a virtue of Stein\u2019s account, a\nfeature and not a bug. Stein makes no attempt to animate his geometric\npicture but leaves whatever transience there may be to reside\nin that which it depicts.\n",
