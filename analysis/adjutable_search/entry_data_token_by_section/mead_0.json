    "main_text": "Life and Influences\n1. Life and Influences\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead was born on February 27, 1863, in South Hadley,\nMassachusetts. His father, Hiram Mead, a minister in the\nCongregational Church, moved his family from Massachusetts to Ohio in\n1869 in order to join the faculty of The Oberlin Theological Seminary.\nAt Oberlin he taught homiletics and held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric\nand Pastoral Theology. Mead would attend Oberlin College from\n1879\u20131883, and matriculate at Harvard from 1887\u20131888. At\nHarvard he studied with Josiah Royce, a philosopher deeply indebted to\nG.W.F. Hegel, who also left a lasting impression on Mead. (Mead met\nWilliam James at Harvard, although he did not study with him. Almost\nimmediately after graduation, Mead resided in William James\u2019s\nsummer home tutoring his son Harry.) Mead\u2019s mother, Elizabeth\nStorrs Billings, was a devoutly religious woman, who taught at Oberlin\nfor two years after the death of her husband in 1881, and served as\npresident of Mount Holyoke College from 1890\u20131900. After his\ncollege years, Mead became a committed naturalist and non-believer,\nbut he had struggled for years with the religious convictions that he\nhad inherited from his family and community. For a period of time\nafter college he even considered Christian Social Work as a career,\nbut 1884 he explained in a letter to his friend Henry Castle why this\ncareer path would be problematic.\n\nI shall have to let persons understand that I have some belief in\nChristianity and my praying be interpreted as a belief in God, whereas\nI have no doubt that now the most reasonable system of the universe\ncan be formed to myself without a God. But notwithstanding all this I\ncannot go out with the world and not work for men. The spirit of a\nminister is strong with me and I come fairly by it. (Shalin 1988,\n920\u2013921)\n\n\nMead did indeed move away from his earlier religious roots, but the\nactivist spirit remained with him. Mead marched in support of\nwomen\u2019s suffrage, served as a treasurer for the Settlement House\nmovement, immersed himself in civic matters in Chicago, and generally\nsupported progressive causes. Jane Addams was a close friend. In terms\nof his transformation into a naturalist, no doubt Darwin played a\nsignificant role. As a matter of fact, one can understand much of\nMead\u2019s work as an attempt to synthesize Darwin, Hegel,\nDewey\u2019s functionalist turn in psychology, and insights gleaned\nfrom James. Mead taught with Dewey at the University of Michigan from\n1891\u20131894, and when Dewey was made chair at the University of\nChicago in 1894, he requested that Mead receive an appointment. Mead\nspent the rest of his career at Chicago. But before he began teaching\nat Michigan, Mead was directly exposed to major currents of European\nthought when he studied in Germany from 1888\u20131891, taking two\ncourses from Wilhelm Dilthey and immersing himself in Wilhelm\nWundt\u2019s research.\n",
