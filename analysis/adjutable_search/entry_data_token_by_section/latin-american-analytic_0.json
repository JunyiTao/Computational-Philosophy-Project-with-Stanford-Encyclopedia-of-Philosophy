    "main_text": "Geographical and Theoretical Boundaries\n1. Geographical and Theoretical Boundaries\n\nThis entry gives an overview of analytic philosophy produced\nin Latin America, not about Latin America. It covers\nphilosophical developments concerning diverse and universal problems\nthat are at the heart of Western philosophy. It focuses on\nphilosophers who have developed a large part of their research and\nteaching practice in Latin American\n countries.[1]\n\nWhat is the scope of analytic philosophy? Analytic philosophy is not\nrestricted to the use of conceptual analysis (Ezcurdia 2015).\nFollowing Rabossi (1975) and Sierra (1987), one could draw the\nboundaries of analytic philosophy by focusing on some family traits: a\npositive attitude toward scientific knowledge, a cautious attitude\ntoward metaphysics, a conception of philosophy as a conceptual task, a\nclose relationship between language and philosophy, a concern with\noffering arguments to answer philosophical questions, and a search for\nconceptual clarity.\n\nIt might be objected that non-analytic philosophy can also exhibit\nthese same traits. One can circumvent this problem by adding two\nadditional traits: a historical dimension (Glock 2008) and a\nsociological dimension (Gracia 2010). Historically, analytic\nphilosophy has its roots in the works of authors such as Frege, Moore,\nRussell, Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists, and it has been\npursued by subsequent authors like Anscombe, Ayer, Austin, Ryle,\nSellars, Strawson, Quine, Davidson, Barcan Marcus, and Kripke (the\n\u201canalytic canon\u201d). Sociologically, the analytic tradition\nis made up of several generations of people who enter advisor-student\nand colleague-colleague relationships. They participate in shared\nactivities in which they recognize each other as members of the same\ncommunity, discuss and research similar topics using similar\napproaches, and share a theoretical\n background.[2]\n\nAnalytic philosophy as practiced in Latin America has two additional\ntraits. First, since analytic philosophy was introduced in Latin\nAmerica while other philosophical traditions were dominant, Latin\nAmerican analytic philosophy often deals with metaphilosophical issues\nsuch as the nature of philosophy, its role in society, its relation to\nother philosophical traditions, and the best ways of teaching it.\nSecond, given that analytic philosophy in Latin America has often\nserved the purposes of promoting change in conservative intellectual\ninstitutions and social and political structures, several analytic\nphilosophers in Latin America have engaged politically in their home\ncountries.\n",
