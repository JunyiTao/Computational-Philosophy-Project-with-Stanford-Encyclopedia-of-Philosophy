    "main_text": "Ethical Implications and Core Ethical Issues || (Cyber)Security and the Internet of Things\n3.5 (Cyber)Security and the Internet of Things\n\n\nIn Sections 3.1 through 3.4, we examined a wide range of ethical\nconcerns affecting the use of search engines, focusing mainly on what\ncan be viewed as the \u201cstandard\u201d or received ethical\nconcerns that have come to be associated with search engines during\nthe past three decades. One topic that arguably has been neglected, or\nperhaps considered only indirectly (e.g., in our earlier discussion of\nprivacy-related issues in Sections 3.2 and 3.3), has to do with\nethical concerns affecting (cyber)security. In addition to\ndata security, which is closely related to data privacy (described\nearlier), issues associated with system and network security, as well\nas with national and international security, also now arise in light\nof a specific kind of search search engine that is capable of locating\n\u201cthings.\u201d In this section, we briefly consider some\nemerging security-related challenges generated by the use of this type\nof search engine in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n\nWhat is IoT, and how does it raise security-related ethical concerns\naffecting search engines? IoT generally refers to the interconnection\nof \u201cobjects\u201d on the Internet; these (networked and\n\u201cintelligent\u201d) objects can include webcams, printers, and\nother devices that are not easily identifiable, locatable, or\naccessible to users via conventional search engines (see, for example,\nBurgess 2018). So users might assume that since information about\nthese objects would not be accessible via typical Internet searches,\nthe objects would be fairly secure from network hackers. Many users\nmight also be enamored by the kinds of conveniences they could enjoy\nif their \u201cintelligent\u201d objects were networked\ntogether. Consider, for example, a \u201csmart home\u201d where\nthese objects could communicate with one another as well as with that\nhomeowner\u2019s mobile devices (and possibly also communicate\ndirectly with networked devices and applications embedded in the\nhomeowner\u2019s automobile). On the one hand, we can imagine that\nthe owner of this home would be delighted if its\n\u201cintelligent\u201d refrigerator communicated with her while\ndriving home to alert her that the refrigerator\u2019s supply of milk\nis low. The refrigerator might also communicate directly with the\nhomeowner\u2019s smart phone to trigger an app designed to display\nthe lowest prices for milk at nearby grocery stores. So, ordinary\nusers could easily come to enjoy the kinds of conveniences made\npossible via their interconnected \u201cintelligent\u201d\nobjects. On the downside, however, it is likely that these objects may\nnot have an appropriate level of network security. Thus users could be\nvulnerable to having their objects hacked and also be subject to\nhaving personal information about them (vis-\u00e0-vis their\ninteractions with these objects) acquired by unauthorized individuals\nand organizations, if search engines were indeed capable of\ndiscovering and locating their (non-sufficiently-secure) objects and\ndevices.\n\n\nWhereas traditional search engines have assisted users in locating\nonline information pertaining to the names of people and places,\ncommercial/governmental/educational organizations and institutions,\netc. (via a standard protocol involving HTTP addresses and HTML\nprogramming code), some search engines are now also capable of\nsearching the Internet for certain kinds of \u201cthings\u201d (or\nobjects). Two of these search engines are Thingful and\nShodan. Thingful describes itself as a \u201cdiscoverable\nsearch engine\u201d that provides users with \u201ca unique\ngeographical index of connected objects around the world\u201d\n(https://thingful.net/). As such, Thingful boasts that it can index\nacross multiple IoT networks and infrastructures. Because this search\nengine can locate the geographical position of objects and devices,\nsome critics worry that Thingful can also easily access personal data\nregarding the ways in which users interact and communicate with their\nconnected devices and objects (as in the case of a homeowner\ncommunicating with the \u201cintelligent\u201d objects in her smart\nhome).\n\n\nShodan, a controversial search engine created by John Matherly in\n2009, enables users to find specific types of (Internet-connected)\ncomputers, devices, and systems (including servers and routers), via\nglobally located servers that index the internet continuously.  Shodan\nhas been described both as a \u201cdark Google\u201d and the\n\u201cscariest search engine ever\u201d because it could be used to\nlocate components in a nation\u2019s critical infrastructure as well\nas its military defense system, including the \u201ccommand and\ncontrol systems for nuclear power plants and particle-accelerating\ncyclotrons\u201d (Goldman 2013). Some have even suggested that Shodan\nwas used to locate and monitor major components in Iran\u2019s\ncontroversial nuclear program (Charette 2012). This has also led to\nspeculation that Shodan may have assisted the (then secret)\n\u201cOlympic Games Operation\u201d allegedly carried out by the\nU.S. and Israel to cause Iran\u2019s centrifuges\u2014i.e.,\nfast-spinning machines that enrich uranium\u2014to spin out of\ncontrol (O\u2019Harrow 2012).  While some might be inclined to argue that nations\nsuch as the U.S and Israel would have been justified in using whatever\ncyber-related means they had at their disposal to disrupt the progress\nof Iran\u2019s nuclear program, we can clearly see the downside of\nsuch a practice; i.e., it could also be adopted by so-called\n\u201crogue nations\u201d and used against \u201clegitimate\u201d\nnation states.\n\nSo it would seem that \u201cdiscoverable search engines\u201d like\nShodan and Thingful pose threats not only to our personal privacy and\nsecurity, but also to the security of a nation\u2019s critical\ninfrastructure and military defense systems as well. It will be\ninteresting to see whether this relatively new kind of search engine\nwill be used by nation states, and possibly even by terrorist groups\nas well, in their future strategies and practices affecting\ncyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, and cyberespionage. It will also be\ninteresting to see whether these search engines, and the companies and\norganizations that develop them, will need to be closely regulated\nbecause of the significant societal threats they now pose. We next\nexamine a related question as to whether search engine companies in\ngeneral have some special social/moral responsibilities, in light of\ntheir important societal roles.\n",
