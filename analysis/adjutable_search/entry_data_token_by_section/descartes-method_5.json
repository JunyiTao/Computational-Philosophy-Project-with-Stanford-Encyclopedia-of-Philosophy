    "main_text": "The Method in the Rules: An Example\n3. The Method in the Rules: An Example\n\nLet\u2019s see how intuition, deduction, and enumeration work in\npractice. Descartes describes how the method should be applied in Rule\n5:\n\n\nWe shall be following this method exactly if we first reduce\ncomplicated and obscure propositions step by step to simpler ones, and\nthen, starting with the intuition of the simplest ones of all, try to\nascend through the same steps to a knowledge of all the rest. (AT 10:\n379, CSM 1: 20)\n\n\nA clear example of the application of the method can be found in Rule\n8, where Descartes discusses how to deduce the shape of the anaclastic\nline, i.e., the shape of the lens from which parallel rays of light\nare refracted towards a common point, as they are in eyeglasses or\ntelescopes (see\n Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anaclastic Lens.\n\n\nThe problem of the anaclastic is a complex, imperfectly understood problem. It needs to be\nreduced to a ordered series of simpler problems by means of\nenumeration2. Once the problem has been reduced to its simplest component parts, the\nsimplest problem in the series must be solved by means of intuition,\nand the more complex problems in the series must be solved by means of\ndeduction.\n\nDescartes reduces the problem of the anaclastic into a series of five\nsimpler problems (see Table 1):\n\n\n\n What is the shape of a line (lens) that focuses parallel rays of\nlight to the same point?\n What is the relation between angle of incidence and angle of\nrefraction (i.e., the law of refraction)?\n How is refraction caused by light passing from one medium to\nanother?\n How does a ray of light penetrate a transparent body?\n What is the nature of the action of light?\n What is a natural power?\n\n\nProblem (6) must be solved first by means of intuition, and the\nremaining problems must be answered in order:\n\n A natural power is\u2026\n The nature of the action of light is\u2026\n A ray of light penetrates a transparent body by\u2026\n Refraction is caused by light passing from one medium to another\nwhen\u2026\n The relation between the angle of incidence and the angle of\nrefraction is\u2026\n The shape of the line (lens) that focuses parallel rays of light\nto the same point is\u2026\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descartes\u2019 proposed\ndeduction of the anaclastic line (Garber 2001: 37)\n\n\nThis example illustrates the procedures involved in Descartes\u2019\nmethod. Intuition and deduction can only performed after\nenumeration2 has reduced the problem to an ordered series\nof simpler problems. The simplest problem is solved first by means of\nintuition, and the more complex problems are solved by means of\ndeduction. The order of the deduction is read directly off the\nenumeration by inversion. Note that identifying some of the\nproblems in the series (specifically Problems 3\u20134 in the second\nseries in\n Table 1)\n require experiment. One must observe how light actually passes\nthrough different types of transparent media in order to determine how\nthese media affect the angles of incidence and refraction. \n",
