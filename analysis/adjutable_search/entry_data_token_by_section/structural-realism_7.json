    "main_text": "Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) || OSR and Quantum Field Theory\n4.2 OSR and Quantum Field Theory\n\nThere are states of quantum fields that can be identified with there\nbeing definite numbers of particular particles, but general states\ncannot. Particles are standardly thought of as particular excitations\nof the field sometimes called \u201cfield quanta\u201d. Hence, the\nproblem of metaphysical underdetermination raised by French and\nRedhead (1988) in the context of non-relativistic many particle\nquantum mechanics is obviated in the context of quantum field theory,\nbecause a particles-as-individuals view is not an option since, loose\nidentifications of particles and field quanta not withstanding, field\nquanta are not individual things (see Bigaj 2018). Redhead (1999)\nreviews the interpretative issues with QFT and argues for OSR in the\nlight of them. Much earlier, Cassirer rejected the Aristotelian idea\nof individual substances on the basis of physics, and argued that the\nmetaphysical view of the \u201cmaterial point\u201d as an individual\nobject cannot be sustained in the context of field theory. He offers a\nstructuralist conception of the field:\n\n\nThe field is not a \u201cthing\u201d, it is a system of effects\n(Wirkungen), and from this system no individual element can\nbe isolated and retained as permanent, as being \u201cidentical with\nitself\u201d through the course of time. The individual electron no\nlonger has any substantiality in the sense that it per se est et\nper se concipitur; it \u201cexists\u201d only in its relation\nto the field, as a \u201csingular location\u201d in it. (1936 [1956:\n178])\n\n\nCao in his book on quantum field theory sometimes sounds like an ontic\nstructural realist, because he denies that the structures postulated\nby field theories must be \u201contologically supported by\nunobservable entities\u201d (Cao 1997: 5). However, in his (2003a) he\nexplicitly criticises OSR and argues for a version of ESR in the\ncontext of a discussion of quantum field theory. Saunders (2003c and\nd) also criticises Cao for underestimating the difficulties with a\nnon-structuralist form of realism in the light of the history of\nquantum field theory. Berghofer (2018) argues that quantum fields have\nintrinsic properties and that this undermines OSR.\n\nIn gauge quantum field theories, which are our best current physical\ntheories of all the forces other than gravity, each field is\nassociated with a particular symmetry group, and the unification of\ntheories was achieved by looking for theoretical structures with the\nrelevant combined symmetry (U(1) for quantum electrodynamics, U(2) for\nthe electroweak theory and SU(3)/Z(3) for the strong interaction.)\nLyre argues for OSR in the interpretation of gauge symmetry. He argues\nthat\n\n\nthe traditional picture of spatiotemporally fixed object-like entities\nis undermined by the ontology of gauge theories in various ways and\nthat main problems with traditional scientific realism\u2026can be\nsoftened by a commitment to the structural content of gauge theories,\nin particular to gauge symmetry groups. (2004: 666)\n\n\nHe goes on to note that his favoured interpretation of gauge theories\n(in terms of non-separable holonomies) is one according to which the\nfundamental objects are ontologically secondary to structure because\nthe objects of a theory are members of equivalence classes under\nsymmetry transformations and no further individuation of objects is\npossible. Similarly, Kantorovich (2003) argues that the symmetries of\nthe strong force are ontologically prior to the particles that feel\nthat force, namely the hadrons, and likewise for the symmetries of the\nso-called \u201cgrand unification\u201d of particle physics in the\nStandard Model of particle physics (but see McKenzie (2014) for a\ndifferent view as cited above). However, There are \u201cunitarily\ninequivalent\u201d representations of the algebra of quantum field\ntheories, and Howard (2011) and Ruetsche (2011) argue that this poses\na problem for algebraic conceptions of structure. French (2012)\nresponds, while David Glick (2016) argues for pluralism about\nstructure in OSR on the basis of unitary inequivalence. McCabe (2007)\npresents the structure and interpretation of the Standard Model in\nontic structural realist terms saying:\n\n\nIn terms of structural realism...fibre bundle cross-sections can be\ntreated as the structures which lie beyond the empirical phenomena.\n(2007: 6)\n\n\nFrench (2019b) addresses the Standard Model in terms of his account of\nOSR. Federico Benitez (2023) distinguishes between framework theories\nand interaction theories in assssing structural realism in the context\nof the Standard Model.\n\nThe ontology of fields and especially the status of vacuua, virtual\nparticles and gauge fields is much contested. Malament (1996) and\nHalvorson and Clifton (2002), among others, argue that there is a\nfundamental conflict between relativistic quantum field theory and the\nexistence of localisable particles. Similarly, when it comes to\nquantum field theory in a curved spacetime, \u201ca useful particle\ninterpretation of states does not, in general, exist\u201d (Wald\n1994: 47, quoted in Stachel 2006: 58). Fraser (2008) argues that there\nare no particles in quantum field theory on the basis of a theorem in\nalgebraic quantum field theory (Haag\u2019s theorem). Wallace (2006,\n2011) adopts a different approach, considering the practice of\nLagrangian or \u201ceffective\u201d quantum field theory, which\nmakes explicit that the theory does not describe interactions at\ncertain energy and length scales, and arguing for a view of particles\nas scale-dependent emergent entities. Ladyman (2015) similarly argues\nthat the current scientific understanding of particles exemplifies the\nclaims of Ladyman and Ross (2007) that composition is dynamical, and\nthat ontology is scale-relative.\n\nIf fields are construed as properties of space-time points or regions\nand then the issue becomes whether the spacetime points are\nindividuals and this question is bound up with the debate about\nsubstantivalism in the foundations of General Relativity as discussed\nin the next section.\n",
