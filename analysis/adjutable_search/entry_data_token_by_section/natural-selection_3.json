    "main_text": "Evolution and the Conditions for Natural Selection || Is Evolution Necessary for Natural Selection?\n2.2 Is Evolution Necessary for Natural Selection?\n\nOne natural way to arbitrate the issue of whether systems that undergo\nselection must evolve is to attend to the point of statements of\nprinciples of natural selection, or statements of the requirements for\nselection. Many theorists take it that the point of these principles\nis to set out the scope of a theory in the special sciences that deals\nwith selection and evolution, evolutionary theory. Lewontin claims\nthat the theory of evolution by natural selection rests on his three\nprinciples (1978: 220). Equally, Godfrey-Smith claims that statements\nof conditions for evolution by natural selection exhibit the coherence\nof evolutionary theory and capture some of its core principles (2007:\n489). Finally, Maynard-Smith (1991) offered a statement of conditions\nfor selection that include evolution as a necessary component, calling\nthe theory so delineated, \u201cDarwin\u2019s theory\u201d. For\nthese writers, the (or at least a) point of the principles\nseems to be to capture the domain of application of the theory we have\ninherited from Darwin.\n\nDarwin would have been surprised to hear that his theory of natural\nselection was circumscribed so as to apply only to evolving\npopulations. He himself constructed an explanation of a persistent\npolymorphism, heterostyly, using his own theory. Plants exhibiting\nheterostyly develop two, or sometimes three, different forms of flower\nwhose reproductive organisms vary in a number of ways, principally\nlength. Some plants exhibit different forms of flower on the same\nplant, while some are dimorphic and trimorphic, with only one sort of\nflower per plant. Darwin interpreted the flower variations as\nconducive to intercrossing, which he thought was beneficial, at least\nfor many organisms. Populations should not evolve directionally such\nthat a single form of flower spreads throughout the population;\ninstead, multiple variants should be retained, a polymorphism. Darwin\nthinks it clear that heterostyly is an adaptation: \n\n\nThe benefit which heterostyled dimorphic plants derive from the\nexistence of the two forms is sufficiently obvious [\u2026.] Nothing\ncan be better adapted for this end than the relative positions of the\nanthers and stigmas in the two forms. (Darwin 1877: 30; thanks to Jim\nLennox for this reference) \n\n\nEven though the population is not evolving, but instead remaining the\nsame over time, it exhibits an adaptation that consists in this\npersistent lack of change, an adaptation that Darwin thought\nexplicable using his theory. For a more recent and especially\ncompelling case of a selectionist explanation of a polymorphism, see\nBayliss, Field, and Moxon\u2019s selectionist explanation of a\nfimbriae polymorphism produced by contingency genes (Bayliss, Field,\n& Moxon 2001).\n\nDarwin thought his theory could explain a lack of evolution, and\nDarwinists in Darwin\u2019s wake have explained not only stable\npolymorphisms, but unstable ones, cyclical behaviors, protected\npolymorphisms, and a variety of other behaviors that differ from\nsimple directional evolution. These sorts of behaviors result from\nspecific assignments of values for theoretical parameters in many of\nthe very same models that are used to explain simple directional\nselection (where a single variant spreads throughout a population, as\nin the wolf case discussed in the introduction). The point is that\nsystems seemingly governed by evolutionary theory exhibit a variety of\ndifferent sorts of dynamics, and this variety includes both different\nsorts of evolution, including at least cyclical and directional, as well\nas a lack of evolution at all, as in cases of stabilizing\nselection.\n\nConsider in particular how the difference between stabilizing and\ndirectional selection in the simplest deterministic models of diploid\nevolution lies in the value of a single parameter in the genotypic\nselection model, heterozygote fitness: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np' & = \\frac{w_{D}p^{2} + w_{H}pq}{w_{D}p^{2} + 2w_{H}pq + w_{R}q^{2}}\\\\\nq' & = \\frac{w_{R}q^{2} + w_{H}pq}{w_{D}p^{2} + 2w_{H}pq + w_{R}q^{2}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\(p'\\) is the frequency of one allele (the \\(A\\) allele) in the\nnext generation\n\\(q'\\) is the frequency of the alternative allele (the \\(a\\)\nallele) in the next generation\n\\(p\\) is the frequency of \\(A\\) alleles in this\ngeneration\n\\(q\\) is the frequency of \\(a\\) alleles in this\ngeneration\n\\(w_{D}\\) is the fitness of the organisms bearing 2 \\(A\\)\nalleles\n\\(w_{H}\\) is the fitness of the organisms bearing 1 \\(A\\)\nallele and 1 \\(a\\) allele\n\\(w_{R}\\) is the fitness of the organisms bearing 2 \\(a\\)\nalleles.\n\n\n\nIn the above simple, \u201cdeterministic\u201d models, if we set the\nfitness parameters such that \\(w_{D} > w_{H} > w_{R},\\) the\n\\(A\\) allele spreads throughout the population, together with\nwhatever traits it causes. Suppose we include within the purview of\nDarwin\u2019s theory models of this sort, together with the systems\nthey (approximately) govern. If we change the value of the fitness\ncoefficients such that \\(w_{D} < w_{H} > w_{R},\\) the system\nwill exhibit a different sort of dynamics. It will evolve to an\nequilibrium point, where there exist some \\(A\\) alleles as well as\nsome \\(a\\) alleles in the population, and remain there, resulting\nin a stable polymorphism. If we hold evolution as a condition for\nselection, we will issue the curious ruling that a system governed by\nthe first sort of model falls within the scope of evolutionary theory\nwhile a system governed by the second sort of model only does so up\nuntil it reaches a stable intermediate state but then no longer.\nMoreover, populations exhibiting stable polymorphisms resulting from\nheterozygote superiority, or overdominance, are just one case among\nmany different sorts of systems that equally exhibit stable\npolymorphisms.\n\nConsider further that it is more realistic for systems\u2019 dynamics\nto be a function of effective population size in the binomial sampling\nequation, as well as fitness. The above models are deterministic,\nwhile the dynamics of natural systems are to some extent random. A\nmore realistic systems of equations, one capturing the randomness\ninvolved in evolutionary change, would feed the \\(p'\\) value issued by\nthe above equations into the binomial sampling equation by making \\(p'\n= j\\): \n\n\\[\nx_{ij} = \\frac{(2N)!}{(2N - i)! i!} \\left(1-\\frac{j}{2N}\\right)^{2N-i} \\left(\\frac{j}{2N}\\right)^{i}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(x_{ij}\\) is the probability of \\(i\\) \\(A\\) alleles in\nthe next generation given \\(j\\) \\(A\\) alleles in this\ngeneration, and \\(N\\) is effective population size. A system\ngoverned by both the deterministic equations and the binomial sampling\nequation is said to undergo drift; all natural systems do so. (For\nmore on drift, effective population size, and randomness in\nevolutionary theory, see entry on\n genetic drift).\n A system exhibiting heterozygote superiority whose dynamics are a\nfunction of the binomial sampling equation will not simply rest at its\nstable intermediate frequency but will hover around it, in some\ngenerations evolving toward it, more rarely evolving away, and in some\ngenerations exhibiting no evolution at all. Which of these cases are\ncases in which the system undergoes natural selection in the capacious\nsense? That is, which cases are cases in which the system falls within\nthe purview of evolutionary theory? A natural answer is all of them.\nTo answer in this way, however, we must not make evolution necessary\nfor natural selection. If we do make evolution necessary, we issue the\nverdict that systems governed by the above systems of equations\nsometimes fall within this purview of evolutionary theory and\nsometimes fall outside it, on a generation to generation basis,\ndespite being governed the whole time by a single same system of\nequations, ones undeniably developed as an outgrowth of Darwin\u2019s\ninitial theorizing.\n\nThis last pattern of argument can be extended. Indeed, given that\nevery natural system undergoing selection also undergoes drift,\nevolutionary theory is arguably applicable also to systems that\nundergo drift even in the absence of selection (in the focused sense).\nGradually reduce the importance of focused selection in the above\nsystem of equations, that is, gradually reduce the differences between\n\\(w_{D}\\), \\(w_{H}\\), and \\(w_{R}\\). Is the point at which the values\nequalize so momentous that it marks the point at which systems\ngoverned by the equations cease to fall within the purview of one\ntheory and instead fall within the purview of another? Does\nKimura\u2019s neutral theory of genetic polymorphism belong in a\ndifferent theory than does Ohta\u2019s (1973) competing nearly\nneutral theory? Brandon (2006) argues that the principle of drift is\nbiology\u2019s first law, writing that neutral evolution is to\nevolutionary theory what inertia is to Newtonian mechanics: both being\nthe natural or default states of the systems to which they apply. If\nBrandon is right, then conditions for the application of evolutionary\ntheory must not even include conditions for selection in the focused\nsense, much less conditions for evolutionary change.\n\nThe point of stating conditions for evolution by natural selection\nneed not be to state the conditions of deployment of a particular\ntheory in the special sciences. Godfrey-Smith mentions that the\nprinciples may be important to discussions of extensions of\nevolutionary principles to new domains. Statements of the conditions\nfor evolution by natural selection might have value for other reasons.\nBut evolutionary theory is, despite the name, at least arguably a\ntheory that is applicable to more systems than just those that evolve,\nas the replicator selectionists would have it.\n",
