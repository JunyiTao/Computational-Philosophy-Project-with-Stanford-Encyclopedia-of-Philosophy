    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience || Fundamental Nature\n1.5 Fundamental Nature\n\nThe idea that aesthetic experience offers acquaintance with aspects of\nnature has a deep history. Medieval philosophers treated it as a means\nof knowing the divine. Several of those eighteenth-century\nphilosophers who focused on appreciation of form (see Section 1.1)\nthought form was itself a reflection of God\u2019s creative\npower.\n\nThe association between the arts and truth has an even longer history,\ntracing at least back to Aristotle\u2019s claim in the\nPoetics that (good) drama represents possibilities for human\nlife. Many philosophers have argued that the arts offer acquaintance\nwith emotions by expressing emotions (Section 1.4.), and many have\nargued that they offer acquaintance with moral truths (Ruskin\n1843\u201360 [2004]; Cousin 1854 [1873]; Nussbaum 1990; McMahon 2018;\nsee Landy 2012 for criticism). A significant new trend in\nphilosophical aesthetics also incorporates more cognitive content\ngenerally into the focus of aesthetic experience (see Carroll 2002,\n2006, 2015, Goldman 2013, Peacocke 2021). This section will not cover\nall such views, but only those that treat aesthetic experience as a\nmeans to acquaintance with or knowledge of fundamental facts about the\nstructure of the world and our place in it.\n\nThis claim is systematically defended in three historical contexts:\nRomanticism, post-Kantian German Idealism, and the\n20th-century intersection of existentialism and\nphenomenology.\n1.5.1 Romanticism\n\nThe English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his critical and\nphilosophical essays published together as Biographia\nLiteraria (1817 [1907]), treated imagination as essential to\nartistic creation and aesthetic experience\u2014but fundamentally as\na source of knowledge rather than an empiricist faculty of association\nor a way of entertaining fantasies. In a proto-Idealist vein, he\nclaimed that such knowledge was knowledge of the spirit that grounds\nreality itself, and to which we ourselves belong as individual loci of\nspirit (cf. Guyer 2014b, p. 65). In Germany, the poet-philosopher\nJohann Christian Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin (1795 [1963]) wrote that\naesthetic experience could lead the mind to construct a unity out of a\nmessy space of intuition, which unity mirrored the unity of spirit\ninherent in the metaphysical fabric of the world itself.\n\nA retrospective reverence for the ancient Greek arts was a touchstone\nof the Romantics, who thought its pursuit of beauty precisely allowed\nit to attain \u201cobjectivity.\u201d The English poet John Keats\nconcluded his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn (1820) with these\nlines (46\u201350):\n\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\n\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say\u2019st,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBeauty is truth, truth beauty\u2014that is all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ye know on earth, and all ye need to\nknow.\u201d\n\n\n(For criticism of Keats on this point, see Ruskin 1843\u201360\n[2004]). The German philosopher Friedrich Schlegel made this claim\nexplicitly in his essay \u201cOn the Study of Greek Poetry\u201d\n(1795). He thought Sophocles composed terrific tragedy effortlessly,\njust by letting the harmonious structure of nature flow through him\ninto his drama.\n\nThe Romantics thought that aesthetic experience offered acquaintance\nwith a concrete individual sometimes called \u201cthe\nAbsolute\u201d\u2014either the infinite itself, or some particular\nconcrete individual within nature that somehow reflected the whole\nunified spirit of the universe. As Schlegel (1798\u20131800 [1991])\nput it, \u201cone might believe [Romantic poetry] exists only to\ncharacterize poetical individuals of all sorts; and yet there is still\nno form so fit for expressing the entire spirit of an author \u2026\nIt alone can become, like the epic, a mirror of the whole\ncircumambient world, an image of the age\u201d (\u00a7116, pp.\n31\u20132). This acquaintance with a concrete individual was\ncontrasted with conceptualized or descriptive understanding.\n\nAlthough these various Romantic poets and philosophers thought\naesthetic experience was the best way to achieve acquaintance with the\ntrue fundamental nature of the universe, they also took on a certain\npessimism or \u201cirony\u201d about the extent to which this could\nreally be achieved. The thematization of limitations on our knowledge\nin the context of aesthetic attempts to know the harmonious unity of\nthe world is a common feature of Romantic writing.\n1.5.2 German Idealism\n\nThe systematic theories of German Idealism and the proposals of\nRomanticism permeated one another, especially in the work of Friedrich\nSchelling. His System of Transcendental Idealism (1800\n[1978]) claimed that both the beautiful and the sublime gave us\nawareness of a fundamental conflict between unconscious (but\nnonetheless mental or spiritual) nature and the conscious\n\u201cinfinity\u201d of human freedom. The sublime makes us aware of\nthis terrible conflict directly, and the beautiful offers the\ntemporary apparent reprieve from or resolution of this conflict. In\nhis later Philosophy of Fine Art (1802\u20133 [1989]), he\ndenied that art offered \u201csensual stimulation, as recreation, as\nrelaxation for a spirit fatigued by more serious matters\u201d (in\nCahn and Meskin 2007, p. 170). Instead, \u201ctruth and beauty are\nmerely two different ways of viewing the one absolute,\u201d where\nthe beautiful offers acquaintance with \u201cthe essential forms of\nthings\u201d via concrete particulars, and philosophical theorization\noffers knowledge of the same via general principles (pp. 178,\n173).\n\nArthur Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics in The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818 [1958]) picks up a significant piece of\nSchelling\u2019s system. He expanded on Schelling\u2019s claim that\n\u201cWill is primal being\u201d by claiming that all of fundamental\nreality is a matter of will. What aesthetic experience offers us is\ndirect, intimate acquaintance with essences: \u201cwhat is thus known\nis no longer the individual thing as such, but the Idea, the\neternal form, the immediate objectivity of the will at this\ngrade\u201d (\u00a734 at p. 195).\n\nSchopenhauer sometimes speaks as though we can choose to have an\naesthetic experience by a \u201cconscious and violent tearing away\nfrom the relations of the same object to the will\u201d (\u00a739,\np.202); the \u2018genius\u2019 artist in particular is good at doing\nthis. When we \u201cdevote the whole power of our mind to\nperception\u201d of an object, we can come to forget our own\nwill\u2014which is itself a pleasant thing, for our will is\nconstantly either bored with its own satisfaction or pained by its\nfrustration (\u00a734, pp. 178\u20139).\n\nAt other points, Schopenhauer presented aesthetic experience as a\npassive result of experiencing great art, especially the art of tragic\ndrama. In tragedy, he wrote,\n\nthe terrible side of life is presented to us\u2026 and so that\naspect of the world is brought before our eyes which directly opposes\nour will \u2026 we become aware that there is still left in us\nsomething different that we cannot possibly know positively, but only\nnegatively, as that which does not will life \u2026 it\nraises us above the will and its interest, and puts us in such a mood\nthat we find pleasure in the sight of what directly opposes the will.\n(p.433)\n\n\nOutside of aesthetic experience, we can only know the nature of the\nuniverse by a kind of extrapolation. Schopenhauer thus puts aesthetic\nexperience in a place of priority with respect to philosophy\nitself.\n\nOn this last point he was directly opposed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich\nHegel, whose system of historical development developed in\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit (1807 [1979]) and his\nlectures on aesthetics and fine art (1820\u201329 [1920]) published\nposthumously. According to him, the point of art is to come to\nunderstand the fundamental, minded nature of the world\u2014the\n\u201cspirit\u201d to which we all belong as self-conscious,\nrational, self-determining beings. Hegel considered a mode of\nunderstanding fundamental nature to be more advanced the more that it\nabstracts from concrete sensuous presentation and the more that it can\nturn contemplation back onto itself. There is a scale within types of\nart in this respect; visual art is less advanced than music, which is\nitself less advanced than poetry (1807 [1979]). While self-conscious\nRomantic poetry allows us to see our rational self-determining nature\nas minded beings, it nonetheless remains imperfect as a mode of\nknowledge of spirit. Philosophy, in its endless capacity for\nself-conscious reflection, \u201cis a higher mode of\npresentment\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 181) and can\nultimately supplant art as a mode of knowing the world\u2019s\nessential structure.\n\nThis Hegelian consequence is not a happy one, and it is a serious\ndrawback of treating art as revelatory of the structure of the\nuniverse: its pits aesthetic endeavors in competition with scientific\nand philosophical ones themselves (Poe 1850 [1984], Gotshalk 1947\np.8).\n1.5.3 Existentialism and Phenomenology\n\nSchelling\u2019s (1800 [1978]) account of the inherent conflict\nbetween \u201cunconscious\u201d nature and the\n\u201cconscious\u201d free human subject had a great influence on\nphenomenologists and existentialists who wrote about aesthetic\nexperience in the early to mid-20th century.\n\nIn his influential essay \u201cOn the Origin of the Work of\nArt\u201d (1935 [1971]), the phenomenologist Martin Heidegger\ninitially objected to the centrality of the \u201cmuch-vaunted\naesthetic experience\u201d to point out that the \u201cthingly\naspect\u201d of an artwork is essential to what it does for us (in\nCahn and Meskin 2007, p. 345). But it turns out that he is really only\nobjecting to a certain abstracted, perhaps Hegelian or neo-Hegelian\nconception of aesthetic experience, rather than all experience of art\nconsidered as special. He gives his own account of our experience of\nart, one on which art offers acquaintance with the basic, essential\nnature of our own human subjectivity. Our primary experience of the\nphysical objects around us foregrounds their utility to us\u2014what\nHeidegger had previously called their \u201creadiness-to-hand\u201d\n(Being and Time, 1927)\u2014rather than their physicality;\nthings only stand out as the clumps of matter they are when they fail\nin serving us in the way we expect them to, as when a tool breaks. It\nis art that allows us to step back from this mode of experiencing\nobjects to contemplate that very phenomenological mode of\nreadiness-to-hand itself, and how it struggles against blunt physical\nconstraints. A work of art, then, sets up a\n\u201cworld\u201d\u2014roughly, a way of experiencing\nthings\u2014as it emerges from its physical basis (the\n\u201cearth\u201d). Through experiences of art, we come to see this\nstruggle itself. Heidegger uses the example of a Van Gogh painting of\nworn, dirty peasant shoes and a Greek temple to exemplify how these\nways of \u201cbeing\u201d emerge from physical things in their\n\u201cthingliness.\u201d Heidegger defines art as \u201cthe\nbecoming and happening of truth\u201d as a form of\n\u201cunconcealedness:\u201d it brings to the foreground our ways of\nexperiencing the world and how they clash with physicality.\n\nThe French atheist existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre studied with\nHeidegger and with the founding phenomenologist Edmund Husserl. The\nview of aesthetic experience that emerges from his novel\nNausea (1938 [1965]) is one that draws from both of their\nconceptions of the physical world as fundamentally devoid of meaning.\nThe world and all of \u201cexistence\u201d as it is in itself\nindependently of human agency is absurd enough to inspire a form of\nnausea in the narrator, Antoine Roquentin. This absurdity consists in\nthe facts that: things happen contingently and for no particular\nreason; no life has any narrative unity; and there is no patterned\nstructure to the unfolding of events one after another.\n\nWhat the experience of art is needed to do is to bring any order,\nstructure, and meaning to human life. In a series of scenes in which\nRoquentin hears the music of a particular jazz vocalist, he comes to\nfind in music the necessity, purpose, and internal structure the world\nhad lacked:\n\nIt seems inevitable, the necessity of this music is so strong \u2026\nIf I love that beautiful voice, it is above all because of that: it is\nneither for its fullness nor its sadness, but because it is the event\nwhich so many notes have prepared so far in advance, dying so that it\nmight be born. \u2026 something has happened. (38)\n\n\nFrom Roquentin\u2019s ecstatic listening we can extrapolate a theory\nof an experience of art and why it is so essential to us. Art\nexercises human freedom to structure the world and give it meaning and\na sense of purpose or necessity; it offers to those who appreciate it\na form of aesthetic experience that makes the world feel whole and\nnecessary. By extrapolating from Sartre\u2019s writing of\nNausea itself, we can also see that art can give us\nacquaintance with the very absurdity of existence itself, and\nchallenge us to make something meaningful of ourselves. In What is\nLiterature? (1948 [1967]) Sartre called writing a way of\n\u201cimposing the unity of mind on the diversity of things\u201d\nthat serves our \u201cneed of feeling that we are essential in\nrelationship to the world\u201d (p.27). The creation and appreciation\nof art, then, not only offers knowledge of the nauseating fundamental\nabsurdity in existence, but also offers at least a phenomenological\ncure for it.\n\nNot all in Sartre\u2019s group were so optimistic (nor all so\npessimistic about the meaning in the world; consider Sartre\u2019s\nChristian contemporary Marcel 1951 [1960]). Albert Camus (1942), for\ninstance, thought that absurdity was inescapable, and all you could do\nwas defy it and go on living anyway (cf. Nagel 1971). Later critical\ntheorists who were deeply influenced by the existentialists took a\nmore complicated stance. In Aesthetic Theory (1970 [1997]),\nTheodor Adorno claimed that artworks offer fantasies of escape from\nthe material world by imposing a new form upon its matter, but only in\na way that involves rejecting their material origin. \u201cAesthetic\nexperience,\u201d then, \u201cis that of something that spirit may\nfind neither in the world nor in itself; it is possibility promised by\nits impossibility\u201d (pp. 135\u20136).\n\nThis concludes the survey of the various different types of properties\non which philosophers have variously claimed aesthetic experience\nfocuses. Note that it is consistent to claim that aesthetic experience\nis focused on more than one of these types of properties. In an\nimportant turn in mid-20th-century aesthetics, Frank Sibley\n(1959) argued that there was a heterogeneous class of aesthetic\nproperties\u2014including beauty, sublimity, elegance, charm, and\nvarious expressive properties\u2014on which aesthetic experience\nfocused (for discussion see Matravers 1996, Brady and Levinson 2001).\nSome contemporary philosophers draw from multiple traditions to\ncharacterize aesthetic experience (Carroll 2002, 2006, 2015, Levinson\n1996a-d, 2016b, Stecker 2005, Goldman 2013, Peacocke 2021). Views of\naesthetic experience that diffuse focus onto several different types\nof properties of objects are under correspondingly more pressure to\nclarify what is special about aesthetic experience in other terms.\n",
