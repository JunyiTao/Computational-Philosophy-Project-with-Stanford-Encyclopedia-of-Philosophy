    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || Ethics\n4.3 Ethics\n\nIn contrast to Fichte\u2019s rather cursory treatment of purely\ntheoretical philosophy, ethics or \u201cpractical philosophy,\u201d\nwhich analyzes the determinate ways in which willing and acting are\ndeterminable by principles of pure reason, constitutes a major portion\nof the Jena system, and the System of Ethics is\nFichte\u2019s longest single book. Whereas theoretical philosophy\nexplains how the world necessarily is, practical philosophy\nexplains how the world ought to be, which is to say, how it\nought to be altered by rational beings. Ethics thus considers\nthe object of consciousness not as something given or even as\nsomething constructed by necessary laws of consciousness, but rather\nas something to be produced by a freely acting subject, consciously\nstriving to establish and to accomplish its own goals and guided only\nby its own self-legislated laws. The specific task of\nFichte\u2019s ethics is therefore, first of all, to deduce the\ncategorical imperative (in its distinctively moral sense) from the\ngeneral obligation to determine oneself freely, and, second, to deduce\nfrom this the particular obligations that apply to every free and\nfinite rational being.\n\nLike all of Fichte\u2019s systematic treatises of the Jena period,\nThe System of Ethics begins with a detailed analysis of what\nis involved in the self-positing of the I. In this case, the focus is\nupon the necessity that the I posit for itself its own activity or\n\u201cefficacy,\u201d and upon a detailed analysis of the\nconditions for doing this. In this manner Fichte deduces what he calls\n\u201cthe principle of all practical philosophy,\u201d viz., that\nsomething objective (a being) follows from something subjective (a\nconcept), and hence that the I must ascribe to itself a power of free\npurposiveness or causality in the sensible world. The I must posit\nitself as an embodied will, and only as such does it\n\u201cdiscover\u201d itself at all. From this starting point Fichte\nthen proceeds to a deduction of the principle of morality: namely,\nthat I must think of my freedom as standing under a certain necessary\nlaw or categorical imperative, which Fichte calls\n\u201cthe law of self-sufficiency\u201d or \u201cautonomy,\u201d\nand that I ought always to determine my freedom in accordance\nwith this law. This, therefore, is the task of the philosophical\nscience of \u201cethics,\u201d as understood by Fichte: to provide\nan a priori deduction of our moral nature in general and of our\nspecific duties as human beings.\n\nViewed from the perspective of practical philosophy, the world really\nis nothing more than what Fichte once described as \u201cthe material\nof our duty made sensible,\u201d which is precisely the viewpoint\nadopted by the morally engaged, practically striving subject. On the\nother hand, this is not the only way the world can be viewed, and,\nmore specifically, it is not the only way in which it is construed by\ntranscendental philosophy. For this reason it is somewhat misleading\nto characterized the Wissenschaftslehre as a whole as a\nsystem of \u201cethical idealism.\u201d As noted above, Fichte\ncertainly does succeed in constructing an account of consciousness\nthat fully integrates the imperatives and activities of practical\nreason into the very structure of the latter, but this integration is\nalways balanced by a recognition of the constitutive role of\ntheoretical reason and of the sheer, contingent \u201cgiveness\u201d\nof the I\u2019s original determinacy (doctrine of the\nAnsto\u00df).\n",
