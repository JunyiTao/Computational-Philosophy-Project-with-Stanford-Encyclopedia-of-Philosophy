    "main_text": "Quine\u2019s Naturalism and its Implications || Negative Aspects\n2.2 Negative Aspects\n\nThe view sketched above has both positive and negative aspects. The\nlatter are better-known, and Quine is often thought of as a negative\nphilosopher, primarily concerned to criticize others. He casts doubt\non terms which many philosophers take for granted. He does not dismiss\nsuch terms as meaningless, but simply as not meriting a place in\nserious science, or in the objective account of the world at which\nscience aims. A well-known and important example is his criticism of\nthe idea of meaning, in the sense of the meaning of a particular\nsentence or statement. Quine says: \u201cMeaning\u2026 is a worthy\nobject of philosophical and scientific clarification and analysis,\nand\u2026 it is ill-suited for use as an instrument of philosophical\nand scientific clarification and analysis.\u201d (1981, 185). The\nterm is insufficiently clear, and putative explanations which employ\nit are in fact unexplanatory; by engendering the illusion of\nexplanation they tend to impede the progress of science. So\nphilosophers should not rely on the term. He makes similar remarks\nabout \u201cthought\u201d, \u201cbelief\u201d,\n\u201cexperience\u201d, \u201cnecessity\u201d, and other terms\nwhich many philosophers assume are legitimate and available for\nphilosophical use without themselves requiring explanation and\njustification in other terms. (For an illustration of Quine\u2019s\nattitude towards the term \u201cmeaning\u201d as used by one such\nphilosopher, see his reply to Pagin in Orenstein and Kokato,\n420f.)\n\nThis criticism of the scientific and philosophical use of certain\nordinary terms goes along with rejection of philosophical questions\nwhich make essential use of those terms. For example, many\nphilosophers hold that there are important philosophical problems\nconcerning knowledge: Do we really know anything at all? What exactly\nare the conditions on knowledge? (This latter question has seemed\nespecially pressing since Gettier, 1963.) Quine, by contrast, finds\nthe word \u201cknowledge\u201d vague, and consequently rejects it\nfor serious use, saying that the word is \u2018\u2018useful and\nunobjectionable in the vernacular where we acquiesce in vagueness, but\nunsuited to technical use because of lacking a precise\nboundary\u2019\u2019 (1984, 295). Accordingly, many such questions\nformulated using the term may simply be dismissed, even if it remains\neminently useful for making rough sorts of claim, when we say as above\nthat scientific knowledge is not different in kind from our ordinary\nknowledge.\n",
