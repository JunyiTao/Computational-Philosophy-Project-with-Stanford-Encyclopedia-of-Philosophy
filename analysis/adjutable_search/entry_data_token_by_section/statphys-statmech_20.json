    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || The Relation between GSM and BSM\n6.7 The Relation between GSM and BSM\n\nA pressing and yet understudied question in the philosophy of SM\nconcerns the relation between the GSM and BSM. GSM provides the tools\nand methods to carry out a wide range of equilibrium calculations, and\nit is the approach predominantly used by practitioners in the field.\nWithout it, the discipline of SM would not be able to operate (Wallace\n2020). BSM is conceptually neat and is preferred by philosophers when\nthey give foundational accounts of SM. So what we\u2019re facing is a\nschism whereby the day-to-day work of physicists is in one framework\nand foundational accounts and explanations are given in another\nframework (Anta 2021a). This would not be worrisome if the frameworks\nwere equivalent, or at least inter-translatable in relatively clear\nway. As the discussion in the previous sections has made clear, this\nis not the case. And what is more, in some contexts the formalisms do\nnot even give empirically equivalent predictions (Werndl & Frigg\n2020b). This raises the question of how exactly the two approaches are\nrelated. Lavis (2005) proposes a reconciliation of the two frameworks\nthrough giving up on the binary property of the system being or not\nbeing in equilibrium, which should be replaced by the continuous\nproperty of commonness. Wallace (2020) argues that GSM is a\nmore general framework in which the Boltzmannian approach may be\nunderstood as a special case. Frigg and Werndl suggest that BSM is a\nfundamental theory and GSM is an effective theory that offers means to\ncalculate values defined in BSM (Frigg & Werndl 2019; Werndl &\nFrigg 2020a). Goldstein (2019) plays down their difference and argues\nthat the conflict between them is not as great as often imagined.\nFinally, Goldstein, Lebowitz, Tumulka, and Zangh\u00ec (2020)\ncompare the Boltzmann entropy and the Gibbs entropy and argue that the\ntwo notions yield the same (leading order) values for the entropy of a\nmacroscopic system in thermal equilibrium.\n",
