    "main_text": "Defining Normative Standards\n2. Defining Normative Standards\n\nReconciliation has as its goal improved relationships. Reconciliation\noften denotes restoration, which suggests a return to the status quo\nante, that is, the state of affairs before the wrong or conflict in\nquestion. This connotation has led some scholars to urge the use of\n\u2018conciliation\u2019 rather than \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in\ncontexts where groups or individuals have never lived according to\ngood, just relations, such as the white and black populations of South\nAfrica at the moment the apartheid regime fell (Krog 2008, Moon 2009).\nBut given the importance of the South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid\nexperiences to the literature on reconciliation, other scholars choose\nto brook the linguistic infelicity of defining the term\n\u2018reconciliation\u2019 so that it includes the pursuit of good\nrelations for the first time, and not merely the reestablishment of\nformerly good relations (Govier 2006, C. Murphy 2010, Philpott 2012).\nHere, the task is to articulate an account of improved relationships\nthat satisfies a normative standard for the relationship in question,\na standard that may not have been previously realized in practice.\n\nTheorists of reconciliation generally recognize that reconciliation is\na \u201cscalar\u201d concept, which allows for minimal and maximal\nversions of improved relationships (Crocker 1999, Griswold 2007). Each\nof the categories along which relationships might improve\n(institutions, behavior, beliefs, attitudes or emotions) admits of\ndegree. For example, in the aftermath of a dispute between friends,\nthe resumption of basic respect is a lower degree of emotional\nrestoration than the resumption of love and trust. In the aftermath of\nbloody civil war, the resumption of cooperation between two parties\nmay be described as a greater change in behavior than their mere\npeaceful coexistence. Maximal forms of political reconciliation are\ntypically identified as either civic friendship (May 2011),\nforgiveness (Tutu 1999), or political or national unity (for an\noverview of such conceptions see Allen 1999).\n\nThough the term \u2018reconciliation\u2019 can be used to pick out\nan entire range of phenomena, theorists will often make an argument\nfor somehow privileging one point on the scale. Some scholars attempt\nto fix the definition of reconciliation for a particular relational\ncontext by looking to the nature of the relationship in question. For\nexample, it may not make sense to talk about spouses as reconciled\nunless there is a reestablishment of trust, love and intimacy. Spouses\nmay get over their anger and resentment. They may cooperate\nsuccessfully in raising their children together. But if trust, love\nand intimacy are not restored they have not reconciled as\nspouses. Similarly, in order to define what is necessary for the\nreconciliation of parties as members of a moral community (Radzik\n2009), a political community (C. Murphy 2010), or the international\ncommunity (Barry 1980), we might look to the ideals that appropriately\ndefine those relationships. In the South African debate, some\ncommentators linked their conception of reconciliation to the moral\nvalue of ubuntu (Tutu 1999, Krog 2008). Ubuntu is\nfrequently summarized through the Zulu saying, \u201cumuntu\nngumuntu ngabantu,\u201d which can be translated as \u201ca\nperson depends on others to be a person\u201d (see, for example,\nMatolino and Kwindingwi 2013, who are more critical of the relevance\nof ubuntu in post-apartheid South Africa).\n\nThe debate about the nature of political reconciliation reflects a\nconcern, not only with ideals of political relationship, but also with\nnon-ideal facts about societies torn apart by injustice or violence.\nFor example, Bhargava (2012) defends a weak conception of\nreconciliation by emphasizing how significant an achievement peaceful\ncoexistence can be in the aftermath of atrocities. He worries that\nadvocating the pursuit of stronger forms of reconciliation will\nrequire that the past be forgotten, leaving the victims to absorb the\ncosts of that past without protest. In contrast, C. Murphy (2010)\nargues that minimal versions should be rejected, for they suggest that\nrelationships have been repaired and reconciliation achieved too\nquickly. A more robust notion of political reconciliation highlights\nthe profound impact of conflict and repression on political\ninteraction, and draws attention to the long-term and complex changes\nthe establishment of a just peace among those formerly in conflict\ndemands. Tutu (1999) suggests that forgiveness may be necessary for\nachieving a peaceful and stable political community. Others argue that\nefforts at reconciliation should aim somewhere between the extremes of\na mere cessation of aggression and full-fledged forgiveness.\nMoellendorf (2007), for example, claims that reconciliation involves\nformer enemies coming to see each other as fellow citizens, who should\nbe treated as equals. Gutmann and Thompson (2000) argue political\nreconciliation is oriented towards the cultivation of democratic\nreciprocity in interaction, which is a willingness to seek common\nground with fellow citizens on matters of public policy.\n\nAnother view, which emerges specifically out of the literature on\npolitical reconciliation, insists that reconciliation cannot be\ndefined pre-politically (Schaap 2005) or in a non-context specific\nmanner (Kofi Annan Foundation 2018). That is, the proper standards for\nreconciliation within a particular post-conflict society can only be\ndetermined through the free, deliberative and democratic processes of\nthat society (Crocker 2008). It follows that what counts as\nreconciliation in one context will not count in another.\n\nSome critics charge that even to pose the problem that faces\nconflict-ridden societies as an issue of reconciliation improperly\nassumes that the project of political unity is legitimate and thereby\nundermines calls for decolonization, secession or other forms of\ngreater political autonomy for disempowered groups (Woolford 2004,\nAlfred 2009, Jung 2018). Critics further argue that adopting the frame\nof a unifying rhetoric of reconciliation can blind the parties to\nroles that racial or ethnic identity, gender, colonization or\noppression played in bringing the atrocities about in the first place,\nas well as the lopsided distribution of harms that they have caused\n(Corntassel and Holder 2008, Grey and James 2016). Theorists in the\n\u201cagonistic\u201d tradition are also asking whether the concept\nof reconciliation can remain useful within a framework that assumes\nthat politics is and will properly remain confrontational (Hirsch\n2011a, Bohle 2017).\n",
