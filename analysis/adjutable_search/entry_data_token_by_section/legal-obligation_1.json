    "main_text": "Authority, Obligation, and Legitimacy\n2. Authority, Obligation, and Legitimacy\n\nA competitive market is not a legal system, even though people adjust\ntheir behaviour in response to relative prices and the whole\nconstitutes a form of social order. Neither was the system of mutual\nnuclear deterrence, though it guided behaviour and generated norms\nthat regulated the Cold War. Many philosophers and social scientists\nagree that a social order is a legal system only if it has effective\nauthority. An effective (or de facto) authority may\nnot be justified, but it does stand in a special relation to justified\n(de jure) authority. Justified authority is what effective\nauthorities claim, or what they are generally recognized to have.\n\nWhat is legal authority, and how is it related to obligations? It is a\nkind of practical authority, i.e., authority over action. On one\ninfluential view, \u201cTo claim authority is to claim the right to\nbe obeyed\u201d (R. P. Wolff 1970: 5). There are, of course,\nauthorities that make no such claim. Theoretical authorities, i.e.,\nexperts, are not characterized by claims to obedience. They need not\neven claim a right to be believed. And there are weaker forms of\npractical authority. To give someone authority to use your car is\nmerely to permit him. But political authority, of which legal\nauthority is one species, is normally seen as a right to rule, with a\ncorrelative duty to obey. On this account law claims the right to\nobedience wherever it sets out obligations. And to obey is not merely\nto comply with the law; it is to be guided by it. Max Weber\nsays it is\n\n\nas if the ruled had made the content of the command the maxim of their\nconduct for its very own sake. (Weber 1922 [1963: II 946])\n\n\nOr, as Robert Paul Wolff somewhat more perspicuously puts it:\n\n\nObedience is not a matter of doing what someone tells you to do. It is\na matter of doing what he tells you to do because he tells you to\ndo it. (R. P. Wolff 1970: 9)\n\n\nThis is not to say that one obeys only in treating the\nauthority\u2019s say-so as an indefeasible reason for action; but one\nmust treat as a binding content-independent reason. The question\nwhether there is an obligation of obedience to law is a matter of\nwhether we should act from the legal point of view and obey the law as\nit claims to be obeyed (Raz 1979: 233\u2013249).\n\nIt is an interesting feature of this account that it supposes that one\ncan tell what the authority requires independent of whether the\nrequirement is justified on its merits. Indeed, one might argue\nthat\n\n\nif there is no way of telling whether an utterance is authoritative,\nexcept by evaluating its contents to see whether it deserves to be\naccepted in its own right, then the distinction between an\nauthoritative utterance and advice or rational persuasion will have\ncollapsed. (Friedman 1973: 132)\n\n\nAn idea of this sort is developed by Raz into one of the leading\narguments for the \u201csources thesis\u201d, the idea that an\nadequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only\non social facts, and not on moral arguments. (See the entry on\n legal positivism.)\n Authority\u2019s subjects\n\n\ncan benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their\nexistence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very\nsame issues which the authority is there to settle. (Raz 1994:\n219)\n\n\nIf law aims to settle disputes about moral issues, then law must be\nidentifiable without resolving these same disputes. The law is\ntherefore exhausted by its sources (such as legislative\nenactments, judicial decisions, and customs, together with local\nconventions of interpretation). This kind of argument has been\ngeneralized (see Shapiro 1998), but also subjected to criticism. It is\nuncertain what sort of constraint is posed by the idea that it should\nnot involve \u201cthe very same issues\u201d\u2014perhaps if\nmorality is a necessary condition only there could be moral tests for\nauthority that leave the relevant dependent reasons untouched (Coleman\n2001: 126\u2013127). And while law does indeed serve as a scheme for\nguiding and appraising behaviour, it may also have other functions,\nsuch as educating its subjects about right and wrong, and this may be\nill-served the attitude that the rules are to be obeyed in part\nbecause they are the rules (Waluchow 1994).\n\nThe obligation-correlative view of authority is not universally\naccepted. Some argue that the power to impose moral obligations is\nonly one of the many ways in which political authorities have the\ncapacity to shape the normative status of those subject to them. The\ndistinctive feature of political authority, according to this\napproach, is the broader power unilaterally change the duties,\nliberties and claim-rights of their subjects (Copp 1999 and Perry\n2012). Others argue that political authority involves no claim right,\nbut only a set of liberties: to decide certain questions for a society\nand to enforce their decisions. (Soper 2002: 85 ff; cf. Ladenson 1980;\nGreenawalt 1987: 47\u201361; and Edmundson 1998: 7\u201370).\n\nThe liberty conception must answer two questions. First, is it not a\nfeature of a right to decide that it requires subjects to refrain from\nacting on competing decisions? If the law says that abortion is\npermissible and the Church says that it is not, what does the denial\nof the Church\u2019s right to decide amount to if not that public\npolicy should be structured by the former decision and not the latter,\neven if the latter is correct? Second, does the right to enforce\ninclude a duty of subjects to pay the penalty when required? If it\ndoes, then this is only a truncated version of the\nobligation-correlative theory\u2014one that holds that punitive and\nremedial obligations, but not primary obligations, are binding. If\nnot, it is starkly at variance with the actual views of legal\nofficials, who do not think that subjects are at liberty to evade\npenalties if they can.\n\nThis reaches a methodological issue in the philosophy of law. Some\nconsider that the character of law\u2019s authority is a matter for\ndescriptive analysis fixed by semantic and logical constraints of\nofficial language and traditions of argument. Others maintain that\nsuch analysis is impossible or indeterminate, and that we are\ntherefore driven to normative arguments about what legal authority\nshould be (see Soper 2002; Finnis 1979: 12\u201315). Crudely put,\nthey think that we should understand law to claim only the sort of\nauthority it would be justifiable for law to have. Such is the\nmotivation for Friedrich Hayek\u2019s suggestion that\n\n\nThe ideal type of law \u2026 provides merely additional information\nto be taken into account in the decision of the actor. (Hayek 1960:\n150)\n\n\nHayek favours the free market, and concludes that the nature of legal\nauthority should be understood analogically. The most radical position\nof this sort is Ronald Dworkin\u2019s. He prefers what he calls a\n\u201cmore relaxed\u201d understanding of legal authority (Dworkin\n1986: 429). Others have argued that the pre-emptive notion of\nauthority is unsatisfactory because it is too rigid (e.g., Perry\n1989). Dworkin\u2019s objection runs much deeper. His position is not\nthat law communicates only a weaker form of guidance; it is that law\nis not to be understood as trying to communicate anything at all. A\nsubject considering his legal duties is not listening to the law; he\nis engaged in \u201ca conversation with oneself\u201d, and is\n\u201ctrying to discover his own intention in maintaining and\nparticipating in that practice\u201d (Dworkin 1986: 58). On this view\nthere is no fact of the matter about what law claims that is\nindependent of what each does well to regard it as claiming.\n\nHowever we resolve the methodological question, there are two parallel\nnormative questions:\n\nThe problem of obligation: What if anything justifies the\nduty to obey the law, and how far does that obedience properly\nextend?\nThe problem of legitimacy: What if anything justifies the\ncoercive power of law, and how far may that power properly\nextend?\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between these? Some maintain that obligation\ncomes first:\n\n\n[T]hough obligation is not a sufficient condition for coercion, it is\nclose to a necessary one. A state may have good grounds in some\nspecial circumstances for coercing those who have no duty to obey. But\nno general policy of upholding the law with steel could be justified\nif the law were not, in general, a source of genuine obligations.\n(Dworkin 1986: 191)\n\n\nThe idea is that merely having justice on one\u2019s side is an\ninadequate ground for coercing others; one also needs a special title\nflowing from the moral status of the law. (Contrast, for example,\nLocke\u2019s view that everyone has an \u201cexecutive power of the\nlaw of nature\u201d, at least outside political society [Second\nTreatise, \u00a7 13].)\n\nOthers contend that this gets the relationship backwards. First, it is\ndoubtful whether one could have an obligation to obey an illegitimate\nregime. We might think that \u201cacquiescence in, or even consent\nto, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to\nobligations\u201d (Rawls 1971: 343; but cf. Simmons 1979:\n78\u201379). If so, at least some conditions of legitimacy precede an\nobligation of obedience. Second, there are substantive reasons for\nthinking we would not have obligations to obey if the law were not\nalready justified in upholding its requirements \u201cwith\nsteel\u201d. A legal system that could not justifiably coerce could\nnot assure the law-abiding that the recalcitrant will not take them\nfor suckers. Without being able to solve this assurance problem it\nwould be unjust to impose obligations on them, and unjust to demand\ntheir obedience. Underlying this suggestion is that idea that familiar\nidea that effectiveness is a necessary\u2014but certainly not\nsufficient\u2014condition for justified authority. (See Kelsen 1960\n[1967: 46\u201350]; cf. Finnis 1979: 250. For an alternative\nformulation of the view that there can be no duty to obey until we\nhave established the right of the authority to coerce, see Ripstein\n2004.)\n",
