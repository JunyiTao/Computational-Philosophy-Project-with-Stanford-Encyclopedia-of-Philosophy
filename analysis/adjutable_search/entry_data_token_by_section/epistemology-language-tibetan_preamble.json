    "main_text": "\n\nThe birth of the Tibetan epistemological tradition (Tib. tshad\nma) follows the reception in Tibet of a corpus of Indian Buddhist\nworks focusing on the topic of \u201creliable cognition\u201d (Skt.\npram\u0101\u1e47a, Tib. tshad ma), principally\nworks by Dharmak\u012brti and his commentators. If Tibetan\nepistemology developed to a large extent in the framework of a\ncommentarial tradition, this did not prevent it from evolving into an\nautochthonous system with its specific terminology and formal features\nas well as addressing new topics that add to the themes inherited from\nthe Indian tradition. The present entry focuses on questions linked\nwith the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of language, but the\nscope of Tibetan epistemological works, like that of Indian\nepistemological treatises, extends also to the domain of logic and\nargumentation, metaphysics, religion, and ethics.\n\nThe currently available works (commentaries on the treatises of the\nIndian Buddhist forefathers and independent compositions), written in\nTibetan, range from the 11th c. to the present days. This\nabundant literature has for the most part not been studied outside the\nTibetan framework of monastic studies; the majority of works has never\nbeen edited, only a few are translated, mostly only partially. In\nparticular, material representative of the formative phase of Tibetan\nepistemology only became available in the last two decades.\n\nThis entry will merely scratch the surface of this rich tradition,\nwhich is by no means monolithic. Individual entries will hopefully be\ndevoted to the respective thinkers in the future. Although Tibetan\nepistemologists address common themes of inquiry and can in part be\nsituated within lineages sharing tendencies of interpretation, the\nindividual compositions reveal a diversity that would make any attempt\nat grouping them into rigid categories prone to oversimplification.\nThis article thus relies on the contributions of selected influential\nfigures to sketch out some key topics of inquiry and conflicting\nmodels representative of mainstream interpretative orientations.\n",
