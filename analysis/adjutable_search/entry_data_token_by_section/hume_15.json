    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Rationalism: Critical Phase in the Treatise\n7.1 Moral Rationalism: Critical Phase in the Treatise\n\nHume thinks that \u201csystems and hypotheses\u201d have also\n\u201cperverted our natural understanding\u201d of morality. The\nviews of the moral rationalists\u2014Samuel Clarke (1675\u20131729),\nLocke and William Wollaston (1660\u20131724)\u2014are prominent\namong them. One distinctive, but unhealthy, aspect of modern moral\nphilosophy, Hume believes, is that it allies itself with religion and\nthus sees itself as serving the interests of \u201cpopular\nsuperstition\u201d. Clarke\u2019s theory and those of the other\nrationalists epitomize this tendency.\n\nClarke, Hume\u2019s central rationalist opponent, appeals to reason\nto explain almost every aspect of morality. He believes that there are\ndemonstrable moral relations of fitness and unfitness that we discover\na priori by means of reason alone. Gratitude, for example, is\na fitting or suitable response to kindness, while ingratitude is an\nunfitting or unsuitable response. He believes that the rational\nintuition that an action is fitting has the power both to obligate us\nand to move us. To act morally is to act rationally.\n\nHume\u2019s most famous and most important objection to moral\nrationalism is two-pronged. In Treatise 2.3.3, \u201cOf the\ninfluencing motives of the will\u201d, he rejects the rationalist\nideal of the good person as someone whose passions and actions are\ngoverned by reason. In T 3.1.1, he uses these arguments to show that\nmoral ideas do not spring from reason alone.\n\nIn the first prong of his objection, Hume begins by remarking that\nnothing is more common than for philosophers, as well as ordinary\npeople, to talk about the \u201ccombat\u201d between reason and\npassion. They say we ought to be governed by reason rather than\npassion, and if our passions are not in line with reason\u2019s\ncommands, we ought to restrain them or bring them into conformity with\nreason. Hume counters that \u201creason alone can never be a motive\nto any action of the will\u201d and that by itself it can never\noppose a passion in the direction of the will.\n\nHis first argument rests on his empiricist conception of reason. As we\nsaw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in\ncomparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning\nconcerns matters of fact. He considers mathematical reasoning from the\nrelation of ideas category and causal reasoning from the category of\nmatters of fact. He asks us to look at instances of actions where\nthese two types of reasoning are relevant and says that when we do, we\nwill see that reason alone couldn\u2019t have moved us.\n\nNo one thinks that mathematical reasoning by itself is capable of\nmoving us. Suppose you want to stay out of debt. This may move you to\ncalculate how much money comes in and how much goes out, but\nmathematical reasoning by itself does not move us to do anything.\nMathematical reasoning, when it bears on action, is always used in\nconnection with achieving some purpose and thus in connection with\ncausal reasoning.\n\nHume, however, argues that when causal reasoning figures in the\nproduction of action, it always presupposes an existing desire or\nwant. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea\nto another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the\nideas must be tied to some desire or affection. As he says,\n\n\nIt can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are\ncauses, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are\nindifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us,\ntheir connexion can never give them any influence; and \u2018tis\nplain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion,\nit cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us (T\n2.3.3.3/414).\n\n\nNoticing a causal connection between exercise and losing weight will\nnot move you to exercise, unless you want to lose weight.\n\nIt immediately follows that reason alone cannot oppose a passion in\nthe direction of the will. To oppose a passion, reason must be able to\ngive rise to a motive by itself, since only a motive can oppose\nanother motive, but he has just shown that reason by itself is unable\nto do this.\n\nHaving exposed reason\u2019s pretensions to rule, Hume inverts the\nrationalist\u2019s ideal of the good person, and concludes that\n\u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem\u201d (T 2.3.3.4/415).\n\nThe second prong of Hume\u2019s objection, the argument from\nmotivation, is directed primarily against Clarke and concerns the\nsource of our moral concepts: either they spring from reason or from\nsentiment. Couching this debate in terms of his own version of the\ntheory of ideas, he reminds us that to engage in any sort of mental\nactivity is to have a perception before the mind, so \u201cto approve\nof one character, to condemn another, are only so many different\nperceptions\u201d (T 3.1.1.2/456). Since there are only two types of\nperception\u2014ideas and impressions\u2014the question between\nrationalism and sentimentalism is\n\n\nWhether \u2019tis by means of our ideas or impressions we\ndistinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable\nor praise-worthy? (T 3.1.1.3/456)\n\n\nThe argument from motivation has only two premises. The first is that\nmoral ideas have pervasive practical effects. Experience shows that we\nare often motivated to perform an action because we think it is\nobligatory or to refrain because we think it is unjust. We try to\ncultivate the virtues in ourselves and are proud when we succeed and\nashamed when we fail. If morality did not have these effects on our\npassions and actions, moral rules and precepts would be pointless, as\nwould our efforts to be virtuous. Thus \u201cmorals excite passions,\nand produce or prevent actions\u201d (T 3.1.1.6/457).\n\nThe second premise is that by itself reason is incapable of exciting\npassions or producing and preventing actions, which Hume supports with\nthe arguments we just looked at about the influencing motives of the\nwill. The argument from motivation, then, is that if moral concepts\nare capable of exciting passions and producing or preventing actions,\nbut reason alone is incapable of doing these things, then moral\nconcepts can\u2019t spring from reason alone.\n\nReason for Hume is essentially passive and inert: it is incapable by\nitself of giving rise to new motives or new ideas. Although he thinks\nthe argument from motivation is decisive, in T 3.1.1 he offers a\nbattery of additional arguments, which are intended to show that moral\nconcepts do not arise from reason alone.\n\nHume takes the defeat of rationalism to entail that moral concepts\nspring from sentiment. Of course, he was not the first to claim that\nmoral ideas arise from sentiment. Hutcheson claimed that we possess,\nin addition to our external senses, a special moral sense that\ndisposes us to respond to benevolence with the distinctive feelings of\napprobation. Hume, however, rejects the idea that the moral sentiments\narise from a sense that is an \u201coriginal quality\u201d\nand part of our \u201cprimary constitution\u201d.\n\nHe first argues that there are many different types of virtue, not all\nof which are types of benevolence\u2014respecting people\u2019s\nproperty rights, keeping promises, courageousness, and\nindustriousness\u2014as Hutcheson maintained. If we agree with Hume,\nbut keep Hutcheson\u2019s idea of a moral sense, we would have to\nbelieve that we have many different \u201coriginal\u201d senses,\nwhich dispose us to approve of the variety of different virtues\nseparately. But he complains that this is not only highly implausible,\nbut also contrary to the\n\n\nusual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles\nproduce all the variety we observe in the universe. (T\n3.1.2.6/473)\n\n\nInstead of multiplying senses, we should look for a few general\nprinciples to explain our approval of the different virtues.\n\nThe real problem, however, is that Hutcheson just\nclaims\u2014hypothesizes\u2014that we possess a unique, original\nmoral sense. If asked why we have a moral sense, his reply is that God\nimplanted it in us. Although in his critical phase Hume freely borrows\nmany of Hutcheson\u2019s arguments to criticize moral rationalism,\nhis rejection of a God-given moral sense puts him on a radically\ndifferent path from Hutcheson in his constructive phase. One way of\nunderstanding Hume\u2019s project is to see it as an attempt to\nnaturalize Hutcheson\u2019s moral sense theory. He aims to provide a\nwholly naturalistic and economical explanation of how we come to\nexperience the moral sentiments that also explains why we approve of\nthe different virtues. In the course of explaining the moral\nsentiments, Hutcheson\u2019s idea of an original moral sense\ndisappears from Hume\u2019s account of morality.\n",
