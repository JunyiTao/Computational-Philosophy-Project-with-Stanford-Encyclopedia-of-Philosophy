    "main_text": "Religion and Parapsychology\n5. Economics, Politics, Education\n\nSidgwick may have thought that the \u201cdeepest problems\u201d of\nhuman life had to do with the religious and ethical problems that\ninspired his parapsychological research, but he nonetheless also\ndevoted an enormous amount of time and energy to both the theoretical\nand practical sides of economics, politics, law, and ethics, which\nwere after all relevant to the problem of the dualism. In this he was\ncertainly in line with the tradition of Bentham and James and J. S.\nMill, all of whom presented utilitarianism as a comprehensive doctrine\nthat prioritized political, legal, and economic reform (Albee 1901;\nSkorupski 1993; Rawls 1993 [1996], 2007). If Sidgwick had his own take\non these subjects, his perspective was still that of a theorist and\nreformer with broad \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d concerns, rather\nthan that of an ethicist obsessed with personal ethics narrowly\nconstrued. His professional credentials as both an economist and\npolitical scientist were impeccable, although the professional\norganizations now associated with these disciplines were only\nbeginning to take shape in his era. He was an active member of the\nsection of the British Association concerned with political economy\nand economics, and his book on The Elements of Politics,\nfirst published in 1891, became a staple of political science at\nCambridge and elsewhere. He is best thought of as one of the founding\nfathers of the \u201cCambridge School\u201d of economics, one whose\ncontributions should be classed with those of Alfred Marshall and A.\nC. Pigou (Backhouse 2006; Medema 2009; Cook 2009; Winch 2009; Cord\n[ed.] 2017). \n\nBut Sidgwick\u2019s reputation as an economist has often suffered\nfrom an invidious comparison with Marshall, his Cambridge colleague\nand rival, who is classed among the greatest figures in the history of\nthe discipline. Marshall was both a brilliant economic thinker and a\nrelentless discipline builder, the man who basically established\nmodern economics as an independent academic discipline at Cambridge.\nAs \u201cUniversity politicians\u201d he and Sidgwick were often at\nodds with each other, since Sidgwick on some points resisted his\nefforts, believing that economics should remain integrated with the\nstudy of politics. Almost immediately upon his appointment as\nprofessor in late 1884, Marshall, in a famous incident, confronted\nSidgwick and ridiculed him for his \u201cmania\u201d for\n\u201cover-regulation\u201d and his \u201cfailure to attract men on\na large scale\u201d, the way Green had at Oxford. Marshall claimed\nthat Sidgwick was hampering his efforts, despite his greater knowledge\nof economics. Sidgwick reflected on the charges, but concluded that\nmissionary zeal was not for him:\n\n\nfeeling that the deepest truth I have to tell is by no means\n\u201cgood tidings\u201d, I naturally shrink from exercising on\nothers the personal influence which would make men [resemble] me, as\nmuch as men more optimistic and prophetic naturally aim at exercising\nsuch influences. Hence as a teacher I naturally desire to limit my\nteaching to those whose bent or deliberate choice it is to search\nafter ultimate truth; if such come to me, I try to tell them all I\nknow; if others come with vaguer aims, I wish if possible to train\ntheir faculties without guiding their judgements. I would not if I\ncould, and I could not if I would, say anything which would make\nphilosophy\u2014my philosophy\u2014popular. (Memoir:\n394\u201396)\n\n\nSidgwick had known Marshall for a long time\u2014since the\n1860s\u2014and had in fact helped his career. He had in effect\ntutored Marshall in philosophy, stimulated his interest in educational\nreform, fostered their mutual interest in political economy, and\nhelped call attention to the importance of Marshall\u2019s early\nwork, privately circulating some of it. Initially, Marshall had joined\nin the cause of women\u2019s higher education, but he later opposed\nit, despite his marriage to Newnham graduate Mary Paley. Thus, by the\n1880s and 90s, relations between the two men were often quite strained\n(Groenewegen 1995).\n\nSidgwick had in fact long been a student of political economy.\n\u201cMill\u2019s influence\u201d, he explained, led him \u201cas\na matter of duty\u201d to \u201cstudy political economy thoroughly,\nand give no little thought to practical questions, social and\npolitical\u201d (Memoir: 36). In the early 1860s, he was\nabsorbed in the study of Mill\u2019s classic work, the Principles\nof Political Economy, and much influenced by Mill\u2019s\nCambridge disciple, the blind political economist Henry Fawcett. From\nthe late 1870s on, he regularly published works in this field,\nproducing his own Principles of Political Economy in 1883,\nheading the political economy section of the British Association,\ncontributing to Palgrave, and serving on various government\nCommissions concerned with economic questions (he developed\nconsiderable expertise devising intricate taxation schemes) His work\nas an academic and policy advisor put him in touch with (directly or\nindirectly) many of the leading economists of the day\u2014not only\nsuch Cambridge colleagues as Fawcett, Marshall, J. N. Keynes, and\nHerbert Foxwell, but also such figures as Edgeworth, Leon Walras, N.\nSenior, J. E. Cairnes, and W. S. Jevons. He was even familiar with the\nwork of Karl Marx, at a time when few trained economists even knew who\nMarx was. Moreover, he was long involved with both the practical and\ntheoretical work of the Cambridge Charity Organization Society,\ndeveloping a sophisticated, eclectic approach to the issue of poor\nrelief.\n\nBut like Marshall and many economists down to the present, Sidgwick\ndrew a careful distinction between the descriptive side (the science)\nof economic analysis and the normative or policy side (the art), which\nespecially concerns the proper role of government intervention in the\nmarket system to improve wealth production or wealth distribution. He\nwas also steeped in the great methodological debates over the\nhistorical or inductive versus the analytic or deductive approaches to\nthe subject, and his balanced efforts to combine the two\u2014and\nstrengthen comparative studies as well\u2014considerably distance his\nwork from older Benthamite defenses of Laissez Faire. For Sidgwick,\n\u201ceconomic man\u201d is simply an abstraction that may be useful\nfor explaining or predicting some aspects of the behavior of people\nunder certain historical circumstances and in certain situations. Both\nthe science and art of economic analysis need to recognize the\nlimitations of the assumption that people always act out of\nself-interest and happily so. Indeed, as he rather heatedly put it in\nhis \u201cThe Scope and Method of Economic Science\u201d:\n\n\nThere is indeed a kind of political economy which flourishes in proud\nindependence of facts; and undertakes to settle all practical problems\nof Governmental interference or private philanthropy by simple\ndeduction from one or two general assumptions\u2014of which the chief\nis the assumption of the universally beneficent and harmonious\noperation of self-interest well let alone. This kind of political\neconomy is sometimes called \u201corthodox\u201d, though it has the\ncharacteristic unusual in orthodox doctrines of being repudiated by\nthe majority of accredited teachers of the subject. But whether\northodox or not, I must be allowed to disclaim all connection with it;\nthe more completely this survival of the a priori politics of\nthe eighteenth century can be banished to the remotest available\nplanet, the better it will be, in my opinion, for the progress of\neconomic science. (Sidgwick 1885: 2\u20133 [Miscellaneous:\n171])\n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s position certainly reflected the more sophisticated,\nmore historical, and even more socialistic views of the later J. S.\nMill, who had been influenced by both the Romantic movement and\nMacaulay\u2019s withering criticisms of the apriorism of\nBenthamism\u2014that is, of the supposedly Benthamite attempt to\ndeduce the best form of law and government from the assumption of\nuniversal self-interest (Capaldi 2004; Pitts 2005). Sidgwick followed\nMill in thinking that political economy needed to pay attention to the\ncomplexity and historical variety of human motivation and character,\nas well as the condition of the working class. Perhaps\ncharacteristically, however, Sidgwick appreciated the paradox involved\nin the successful application of the historical method:\n\n\n[I]t may be worth while to point out to the more aggressive\n\u201chistoricists\u201d that the more the historian establishes the\nindependence of his own study, by bringing into clear view the great\ndifferences between the economic conditions with which we are familiar\nand those of earlier ages, the more, prima facie, he tends to\nestablish the corresponding independence of the economic science\nwhich, pursued with a view to practice, is primarily concerned to\nunderstand the present. (Sidgwick 1883 [1901: 48])\n\n\nThis is not to applaud the increasing individualism and\nself-interested behavior of the modern world, which in fact rather\nworried Sidgwick. Again like Mill, he hoped that the future would\nbring a growth in human sympathy and moral motivation. He even hoped\nthat individuals would come to be motivated to work by their concern\nto do their bit for the common good, to make their contribution to\nsociety; \u201cethical\u201d socialism, though not necessarily\ngovernmental socialism, was for him a very attractive development.\nHowever, another side of this story concerns how those in the\n\u201cwaiting room of history\u201d, as Chakrabarty (2000) called\nit, would be treated, not as different, but as inferior. As Mill put\nit, in The Principles of Political Economy:\n\n\nTo civilize a savage, he must be inspired with new wants and desires,\neven if not of a very elevated kind, provided that their gratification\ncan be a motive to steady and regular bodily and mental exertion. If\nthe negroes of Jamaica and Demerara, after their emancipation had\ncontented themselves, as it was predicted they would do, with the\nnecessaries of life, and abandoned all labour beyond the little which\nin a tropical climate, with a thin population and abundance of the\nrichest land, is sufficient to support existence, they would have sunk\ninto a condition more barbarous, though less unhappy, than their\nprevious state of slavery. The motive which was most relied on for\ninducing them to work was their love of fine clothes and personal\nornaments. No one will stand up for this taste as worthy of being\ncultivated, and in most societies its indulgence tends to impoverish\nrather than to enrich; but in the state of mind of the negroes it\nmight have been the only incentive that could make them voluntarily\nundergo systematic labour, and so acquire or maintain habits of\nvoluntary industry which may be converted to more valuable ends. In\nEngland, it is not the desire of wealth that needs to be taught, but\nthe use of wealth, and appreciation of the objects of desire which\nwealth cannot purchase, or for attaining which it is not required.\nEvery real improvement in the character of the English, whether it\nconsist in giving them higher aspirations, or only a juster estimate\nof the value of their present objects of desire, must necessarily\nmoderate the ardour of their devotion to the pursuit of wealth. (Mill\n1871: 104\u20135)\n\n\nLike Mill, and Bentham for that matter, Sidgwick was an enthusiastic\nsupporter of Wakefield and colonization, which was deemed necessary to\nrelieve pressures of population growth in England. Like them, he\ndevoted considerable energy to theorizing the comparative demands of\ncolonization, settler colonization, and dominion with respect to\nBritain\u2019s \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d. But at least with\nrespect to his contributions to the supposed \u201cscience\u201d of\neconomics, there has long been considerable controversy over how\nsuccessful Sidgwick was in going beyond Mill and appreciating the\n\u201cmarginalist revolution\u201d going on around him. Deane argues\nthat \n\n\nthe Principles owed more to the classical tradition of J. S.\nMill than to what contemporaries were then calling the \u201cnew\npolitical economy\u201d of Jevons and Marshall. (Deane 1987: 329)\n\n\n\nAnd Howey, in an influential work, insists that economists \n\n\nmust add something to and take something away from hedonism, as\nordinarily construed, before it becomes marginal utility economics.\nJevons and Gossen could make the transformation; Sidgwick never could.\n(Howey 1960: 95) \n\n\nOn the other side, however, Sidgwick\u2019s economic work has been\npraised by more than one Nobel Prize winner, including George Stigler.\nStigler, after remarking on how the work of Cournot and Dupuit on\nmonopoly and oligopoly \u201cbegan to enter English economics, in\nparticular though Edgeworth, Sidgwick, and Marshall\u201d, confessed\nthat he was \n\n\ncoming to admire Henry Sidgwick almost as much as the other two. His\nPrinciples \u2026 has two chapters (bk II, ch. IX and X)\nwhich are among the best in the history of microeconomics, dealing\nwith the theories of human capital and noncompetitive behavior.\n(Stigler 1982: 41) \n\n\nElements of the Chicago School of Economics, particularly of law and\neconomics, have been intriguingly traced back to Sidgwick by Steven\nMedema (2007), who has also helpfully brought out the impact of\nSidgwick\u2019s religious concerns on his economic approach (2008,\n2009). Many of the contributions to Cord (2017) clarify and highlight\nthe role Sidgwick played in the development of economics, at Cambridge\nand in general.\n\nFor his part, Sidgwick at least claimed that he was part of the new\nmovement, describing himself as a disciple of Jevons: \n\n\nas Jevons had admirably explained, the variations in the relative\nmarket values of different articles express and correspond to\nvariations in the comparative estimates formed by people in general,\nnot of the total utilities of the amounts purchased of such\narticles, but of their final utilities; the utilities, that\nis, of the last portions purchased. (Sidgwick 1883 [1901: 82]) \n\n\nBut he did allow that the differences with the older, Millian school\nhad been exaggerated, and he continued, despite his considerable\nmathematical expertise, to do economics in a qualitative mode. Even\nso, he showed considerable acumen in setting out and conceptually\nclarifying the fundamental concepts of economics (wealth, value,\nlabor, money, efficiency, etc.), in bringing out the difficulties\ninvolved in cross-cultural and trans-historical comparisons of wealth,\nand in analyzing the various cases of market failure, from monopoly to\ncollective action problems to negative externalities. Indeed, his\naccounts of market failure and the possible remedies\u2014the\n\u201cart\u201d of political economy\u2014have received somewhat\nmore recognition. Even Marshall praised this side of Sidgwick\u2019s\nwork. It is widely admitted that Marshall\u2019s hand-picked\nsuccessor at Cambridge, A. C. Pigou, produced a form of welfare\neconomics that largely recapitulated Sidgwick\u2019s contributions\n(Backhouse 2006; Medema 2009; Cook 2009; Winch 2009).\n\nThe form of Sidgwick\u2019s Principles of Political Economy,\nwith its careful conceptual clarifications and distinction between\nnormative and descriptive arguments, and its successive qualifications\nto individualistic, free market accounts of both, would prove to be\ncharacteristic, figuring in many of his essays and in such works as\nThe Elements of Politics. As in the case of the\nMethods, the structure of these works has often made it\ndifficult to see precisely where Sidgwick comes down on many issues.\nTypically, he begins with a robust statement of the\n\u201cindividualistic principle\u201d, as, for example, in the\nElements:\n\n\nwhat one sane adult is legally compelled to render to others should be\nmerely the negative service of non-interference, except so far as he\nhas voluntarily undertaken to render positive services; provided that\nwe include in the notion of non-interference the obligation of\nremedying or compensating for mischief intentionally or carelessly\ncaused by his acts\u2014or preventing mischief that would otherwise\nresult from previous acts. This principle for determining the nature\nand limits of governmental interference is currently known as\n\u201cIndividualism\u201d \u2026 the requirement that one sane\nadult, apart from contract or claim to reparation, shall contribute\npositively by money or services to the support of others I shall call\n\u201csocialistic\u201d. (Sidgwick 1891 [1919: 42])\n\n\nThen, typically, he goes on to explain how any such principle reflects\nvarious psychological and sociological presuppositions\u2014for\nexample, that sane adults are the best judges of their own\ninterests\u2014and that these are only approximate generalizations\nand subject to crucial limitations. The psychological assumption that\n\u201cevery one can best take care of his own interest\u201d and the\nsociological one that \u201cthe common welfare is best attained by\neach pursuing exclusively his own welfare and that of his family in a\nthoroughly alert and intelligent manner\u201d\u2014both essential to\nthe case for Laissez Faire\u2014end up being very heavily qualified\nand subject to so many exceptions that it is scarcely evident what\nSidgwick means when he calls individualism \u201cin the main\nsound\u201d. The list of qualifications covers everything from\neducation, defense, child care, poor relief, public works, collective\nbargaining, environmental protections, and more. He stresses two cases\nthat, he urges, perspicuously point up the problems with the\nindividualistic principle: \u201cthe humane treatment of lunatics,\nand the prevention of cruelty to the inferior animals\u201d. Such\nrestrictions do not aim at securing the freedom of the lunatics or the\nanimals, but are a \u201cone-sided restraint of the freedom of action\nof men with a view to the greatest happiness of the aggregate of\nsentient beings\u201d. An unfortunate\u2014but alas, all too\nrevealing\u2014note adds that the \u201cprotection of inferior races\nof men will be considered in a subsequent chapter\u201d (Sidgwick\n1891 [1919: 141\u201342]).\n\nThese qualifications and limitations then invariably involve a\ndiscussion of the case for socialism and/or communism, a subject that\nSidgwick addressed at length in many works. His main objection to\nsocialistic interference was the familiar one that too much of it\nwould lead to splendidly equal destitution, as the old line has it,\nand that for people as presently constituted economic incentives were\nneeded to spur them to produce. But again, a better, more communal\nworld was possible, and he hoped that \u201chuman nature\u201d would\nchange, growing more sympathetic and more amenable to ethical\nsocialism, leaving the door open to the possibility of legitimating\nmuch greater governmental interference with the market. Winch (2009)\nexpertly brings out not only how far Sidgwick went in suggesting that\ngovernment interference with markets should become \u201ca normal\nelement\u201d of industrial policy, but also how his acceptable\nalternative to expropriating landlords as part of radical land\nnationalization was a program of reparative justice such that the poor\n\u201cshould be eligible for compensation by the rich\u201d. (Winch\n2009: 219). \n\nAt any rate, as noted above, whatever his anxieties about economic\nsocialism, Sidgwick was openly enthusiastic about ethical socialism,\nthe possibility of humanity growing more altruistic and compassionate,\nregarding their labor as their contribution to the common good. He was\nunder no illusions whatsoever, not only about the market failing to\nreflect claims of desert or merit, but also about the limitations of\nthat abstraction, \u201ceconomic man\u201d, since historical and\ncultural or national context could dramatically alter the\npossibilities for moving beyond economic individualism, though again,\nin some areas this emphasis on \u201cnational character\u201d lent\nitself to the racist and imperialistic tendencies of the British\nempire (Schultz 2004). It is possible that Sidgwick\u2019s drift\ntoward racism may have been in significant part a result of his\nabsorption in the work of Jevons, who held that a \u201cman of lower\nrace, a negro for instance, enjoys possession less, and loathes labour\nmore; his exertions, therefore, soon stop\u201d (Jevons 1871: 177).\nSuch views on matters of race, which were more extreme than\nMill\u2019s, would increasingly reverberate through late\nnineteenth-century political economy (Macmillan 1890), finding\nexpression in Sidgwick\u2019s admirer Edgeworth, who would insist on\nhow \u201cCapacity for pleasure is a property of evolution, an\nessential attribute of civilisation\u201d, with\n\u201ccivilisation\u201d being determined in part by race.\n(Edgeworth 1881 [2003: 78]).\n\nClearly, in his political theoretical work, Sidgwick admittedly simply\nassumed the utilitarian criterion as the normative bottom line, rather\nthan arguing for it against rational egoism. He also stressed, in many\ndifferent works, that no one could confidently predict the direction\nof civilization. Although in his more historical works, notably\nThe Development of European Polity, Sidgwick assembled\nevidence to suggest that a continued growth in federalism and\nlarge-scale state organizations was likely, it was a very carefully\nhedged conclusion and cast against a broad critique of the social\nsciences. Much as he admired the sweep and ambition of such pioneers\nof sociology as Spencer and Comte (whose emphasis on the\n\u201cconsensus of experts\u201d was appropriated for his\nepistemological work), he regarded their \u201csciences\u201d of the\nlaws of human development as absurdly over-blown, yielding wildly\ndifferent predictions about the future course of humanity. He\nsincerely hoped that a more cosmopolitan attitude would be the wave of\nthe future, and that the growth of international law and cooperation\nwould decrease the likelihood of war, but he could not convince\nhimself that social science\u2014with the partial exception of\neconomics\u2014was beyond its infancy when it came to predicting\nthings to come (Sidgwick 1902a; see also the introduction to Bryce\n& Sidgwick [eds] 1919).\n\nThus, although D. G. Ritchie famously charged that with Sidgwick\nutilitarianism had grown \u201ctame and sleek\u201d and lost its\nreforming zeal, others, notably F. A. Hayek, held that he had in\neffect paved the way for the \u201cNew Liberalism\u201d and even\nFabian socialism that soon overtook British politics, legitimating a\nfar greater degree of state intervention (Schultz 2004). Woodrow\nWilson, the future president of the U. S., admired Sidgwick\u2019s\nElements, but found the more abstract, analytic side of his\nwork oddly \u201ccolorless\u201d and in need of historical content.\nThese debates continue (Collini 2001; Kloppenberg 1992; H. S. Jones\n2000; Bell 2007, 2016; Winch 2009; Miller 2020), though it would be\ndifficult to conclude that anyone has got Sidgwick quite right.\nSidgwick was at times tame and sleek, at times subversive and\nreformist, at times anxious, at times hopeful, and always more or less\nskeptical. At any rate, Sidgwick\u2019s work in politics and\npolitical theory, like his work in economics, does reveal how far he\nwas from Benthamism; he even criticized at length the Austinian theory\nof sovereignty\u2014which analyzed law in terms of authoritative\ncommand and habitual obedience\u2014so dear to the Benthamites, in a\ncritique that received high praise from the legal historian (and\nSidgwick student) F. W. Maitland.\n\nBut some sides of Sidgwick have not aged at all well, though they too\nneed to be addressed. In an important article on \u201cThe Political\nPhilosophy of Henry Sidgwick\u201d, Miller goes so far as to argue\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s political philosophy has \u201cfallen into\noblivion while his ethics continues to be celebrated\u201d because of\n\n\n\nthe weight he attached to common sentiments and beliefs in his\napplication of the utility principle, illustrated by his treatment of\ntopics such as secession and colonialism. Moreover his Elements of\nPolitics is arranged in such a way that he never has to confront\nthe basic question of what makes states legitimate. This means that\nneither political moralists, who want to see the utility principle\napplied in more radical fashion, nor political realists, for whom the\nproblem of establishing political order is central, find much to\ncommend in his political philosophy. (Miller 2020: 261) \n\n\nThere is certainly much that is right in Miller\u2019s position. It\nmust be allowed, at the least, that Sidgwick\u2019s political\nwritings did not achieve the inspiring tone of J. S. Mill, and that,\nfor all of his indebtedness to On Liberty, Considerations on\nRepresentative Government etc., he tended to highlight the more\nelitist Millian concerns\u2014concerns that often reflected his\nanxieties about the dualism of practical reason, rather than his hopes\nfor a better world. Like the later Mill, Sidgwick harbored many\nsuspicions about the wisdom of democracy and championed the need for a\ncultural \u201cclerisy\u201d or vanguard of educated opinion, often\nsounding a note not unlike that of Walter Lippmann in the twentieth\ncentury, stressing how an educated elite should benevolently shape\npublic opinion. He much admired the work of his friend James Bryce,\nauthor of The American Commonwealth (1888), which pointed up\nboth the vitality and the dangers of the U.S. political system. But he\ndevoted comparatively little effort to proclaiming the benefits of\nfreedom of conscience and speech (or grassroots democracy), was quite\ncritical of Mill\u2019s schemes for proportional representation, and\nworried at length about how \n\n\nto correct the erroneous and short-sighted views of self-interest,\nrepresenting it as divergent from duty, which certainly appear to be\nwidely prevalent in the most advanced societies, at least among\nirreligious persons. \n\n\nIn fact, for the government to supply teachers of this view might even\nbe \n\n\nindirectly individualistic in its aim, since to diffuse the conviction\nthat it is every one\u2019s interest to do what is right would\nobviously be a valuable protection against mutual wrong, \n\n\nthough it would probably detract from the credibility of such teachers\nif they were salaried employees of the state (Sidgwick 1891 [1919:\n213\u201314]). \n\nThe more sinister aspects of Sidgwick\u2019s worries about what he\ntermed the\u201clower classes\u201d and the \u201clower\nraces\u201d, and the ways in which his work (including his\nparapsychology) intertwined with a variety of late Victorian\nimperialistic projects, including those of his colleague Sir John\nSeeley, his friend Charles Henry Pearson, and his brother-in-law\nArthur Balfour, have been brought out primarily by Schultz (2004,\n2007, 2017) and Bell (2007, 2016), though Miller also recognizes the\nimportance of these matters. Plausibly, another reason why\nSidgwick\u2019s political work has been comparatively neglected is\nthat there is so much deeply offensive, colonialist, imperialist, and\nracist content in it. As Bell puts it:\n\n\nSidgwick frequently wrote in a racialized idiom, and his work is\nstudded with examples of crude (albeit standard) civilizational\nstereotyping\u2026. This was a vision of liberal civilizational\nimperialism, remaking the manners as well as the map of the world, and\ndrawing on a long-standing argument about the occupation of\n\u201cunoccupied\u201d territory leavened with late Victorian\nmoralism about the duties of imperialists to indigenous populations.\n(Bell 2016: 262)\n\n\nFor Sidgwick, it was an open, urgent question whether the \u201clower\nraces\u201d were not inherently so, and he thought that intermarriage\nbetween races should be prohibited (as it often was) if there was\nforthcoming evidence that such marriages could result in the\n\u201cdebasement\u201d of the \u201csuperior\u201d race, though he\nhoped that would not prove to be the case. In addition to admiring his\ncolleague Seeley\u2019s work on the expansion of England, he allowed\nthat the evidence marshalled by his friend Charles Henry Pearson, in\nhis National Life and Character, evidence about the\n\u201cthreat\u201d to the supremacy of the \u201cwhite races\u201d\nfrom the \u201cblack and yellow races\u201d, was very impressive, if\nnot quite decisive (Schultz 2004; 2017: 328\u20133). Like so many in\nhis circles, Sidgwick occasionally used the \u201cN word\u201d to\nrefer to Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and even while\nacknowledging the historical atrocities of settler colonialism, he\ninsisted that\n\n\ncivilised nations \u2026 in performance of their legitimate\nbusiness\u2014for it is their legitimate business on utilitarian\nprinciples\u2014of civilizing the world \u2026 have to commit acts\nwhich cannot but be regarded as aggressive by the savage nations whom\nit is their business to educate and absorb. (Sidgwick 1902a:\n236\u201337) \n\n\nHe bought into the racist stereotyping of \u201cnational\ncharacter\u201d to be found in Millian ethology and the work of\nBryce, and he supported the harsh repressive measures his\nbrother-in-law Arthur Balfour used against the Irish, during his time\nas Irish Secretary, opposing Home Rule for Ireland. He extolled the\nsatisfactions of the \u201cspiritual expansion\u201d of\n\u201ccivilized\u201d nations, whatever the economics of the matter,\nand apparently despite the fact that when it came to metaethical\nfoundations, these nations were not themselves very far along on the\nimperialist scale of \u201ccivilization\u201d, being too tempted by\na Machiavellian materialism and Jingoism making for conflict at home\nand abroad. \n\nThus, perhaps what Sidgwick\u2019s political writings so effectively\nhighlight is how his version of liberal imperialism is weaker on the\nliberal side than the Millian version, and how his views on quelling\nsocial strife and achieving peace through a more cosmopolitan,\ninternationalist world order could reflect his racialized and racist\nversion of the \u201ccivilizational mission\u201d of Victorian\nimperialism, heightened by anxieties about the growth of democracy and\nthe decline of religion. As with Mill, it is through the lens of the\ncritique of the culture of imperialism that one can most sharply\ndiscern just why education was accorded such a crucial role here.\nGiven the anti and postcolonial scholarship devoted to Bentham and\nJames and John Stuart Mill, for example Inder Marwah\u2019s\nLiberalism, Diversity and Domination: Kant, Mill and the\nGovernment of Difference (Marwah 2019; see also Pitts 2005), it\nis very surprising indeed how the comprehensive vision of\nutilitarianism that Sidgwick advanced could be ignored or censored in\nthe way that it has been and mostly continues to be. Of course, as\nwith Mill, Sidgwick was somewhat better on the home front and with\ncertain reformist causes, at least insofar as these can be\ndecolonized. Despite his disclaimers, he truly was committed to\nexpanding and improving educational opportunities, the better to\ninfluence the direction of reform. His (highly Millian) feminism was\nfocused on higher education for women and the foundation of Newnham\nCollege, and his many attempts to improve the curriculum of Cambridge\nUniversity (by including Bentham, modern literature, physiology and\nother new subjects) were correlated with efforts to expand its\naudience and impact (McWilliams Tullberg 1975 [1998]; Sutherland\n2006). And beyond formal educational institutions, Sidgwick was\nindefatigable in promoting and participating in discussion societies,\never aiming at the elusive \u201cconsensus of experts\u201d that his\nepistemology called for. If, towards the end of his life, his\nparticipation in such vehicles as the \u201cEthical Societies\u201d\nreflected his despair over the possibility of achieving such a\nconsensus on the \u201cdeepest problems\u201d, and instead involved\nan effort to set such problems aside in the hope of agreeing on the\npractical upshot of ethical questions (Sidgwick 1898), this was not\nhis most characteristic attitude (Skelton 2011), though such\nparticipation did bring home to him how important it was to widen his\ndialogical efforts. His support for John Addington Symonds, one of the\nEnglish followers of Walt Whitman and a pioneer of gay studies, is\nalso suggestive of how important some of his reformist efforts could\nbe (Schultz 2004).\n\nAs with other aspects of his politics, Sidgwick\u2019s views on\neducation and culture have not received nearly as much critical\nattention as his ethical work. But they merit careful analysis, given\nthe way in which he fell in between Mill and Dewey as a prominent and\npolitically charged consequentialist philosopher-educator. Calling for\nthe inclusion of both older humanistic and modern scientific elements\nin any form of education worthy of the name, and for an open-minded\nfallibilistic attitude, he explained in \u201cThe Pursuit of\nCulture\u201d:\n\n\nsince the most essential function of the mind is to think and know, a\nman of cultivated mind must be essentially concerned for knowledge:\nbut it is not knowledge merely that gives culture. A man may be\nlearned and yet lack culture: for he may be a pedant, and the\ncharacteristic of a pedant is that he has knowledge without culture.\nSo again, a load of facts retained in the memory, a mass of reasonings\ngot up merely for examination, these are not, they do not give\nculture. It is the love of knowledge, the ardour of scientific\ncuriosity, driving us continually to absorb new facts and ideas, to\nmake them our own and fit them into the living and growing system of\nour thought; and the trained faculty of doing this, the alert and\nsupple intelligence exercised and continually developed in doing\nthis,\u2014it is in these that culture essentially lies. (1897\n[Miscellaneous: 352]).\n\n\nPerhaps Sidgwick would have admitted that there was always room for\nmore doubt.\n",
