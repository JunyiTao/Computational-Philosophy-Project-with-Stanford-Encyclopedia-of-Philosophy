    "main_text": "\n\nMereology (from the Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2,\n\u2018part\u2019) is the theory of parthood relations: of the\nrelations of part to whole and the relations of part to part within a\n whole.[1]\n Its roots can be traced back to the early days of philosophy,\nbeginning with the Presocratics and continuing throughout the writings\nof Plato (especially the Parmenides and the\nTheaetetus), Aristotle (especially the Metaphysics,\nbut also the Physics, the Topics, and De\npartibus animalium), and Boethius (especially De\nDivisione and In Ciceronis Topica). Mereology occupies a\nprominent role also in the writings of medieval ontologists and\nscholastic philosophers such as Garland the Computist, Peter Abelard,\nThomas Aquinas, Raymond Lull, John Duns Scotus, Walter Burley, William\nof Ockham, and Jean Buridan, as well as in Jungius's Logica\nHamburgensis (1638), Leibniz's Dissertatio de arte\ncombinatoria (1666) and Monadology (1714), and Kant's\nearly writings (the Gedanken of 1747 and the Monadologia\nphysica of 1756). As a formal theory of parthood relations,\nhowever, mereology made its way into our times mainly through the work\nof Franz Brentano and of his pupils, especially Husserl's third\nLogical Investigation (1901). The latter may rightly be\nconsidered the first attempt at a thorough formulation of a theory,\nthough in a format that makes it difficult to disentangle the analysis\nof mereological concepts from that of other ontologically relevant\nnotions (such as the relation of ontological\n dependence).[2]\n It is not until Le\u015bniewski's Foundations of the General\nTheory of Sets (1916) and his Foundations of Mathematics\n(1927\u20131931) that a pure theory of part-relations was given an\nexact\n formulation.[3]\n And because Le\u015bniewski's work was largely inaccessible to\nnon-speakers of Polish, it is only with the publication of Leonard and\nGoodman's The Calculus of Individuals (1940), partly under\nthe influence of Whitehead, that mereology has become a chapter of\ncentral interest for modern ontologists and\n metaphysicians.[4]\n\nIn the following we focus mostly on contemporary formulations of\nmereology as they grew out of these recent\ntheories\u2014Le\u015bniewski's and Leonard and Goodman's. Indeed,\nalthough such theories come in different logical guises, they are\nsufficiently similar to be recognized as a common basis for most\nsubsequent developments. To properly assess the relative strengths and\nweaknesses, however, it will be convenient to proceed in steps. First\nwe consider some core mereological notions and principles. Then we\nproceed to an examination of the stronger theories that can be erected\non that basis.\n",
