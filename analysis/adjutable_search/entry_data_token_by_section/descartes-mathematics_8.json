In Book One he offers his algebraic analysis\nof the problem, and in Book Two he claims to provide the synthesis (or\ndemonstration) that the curves that solve the general problem are\nlegitimately geometrical curves which meet his stated standard for\ngeometrical exactness and precision. And with these two stages\ncompleted, Descartes claims to Mersenne six months after La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie is published that his treatment of the\ngeneral Pappus Problem is proof that his new method for\ngeometrical-problem solving is an improvement over the methods of his\npredecessors:\n\n\nI do not like to have to speak well of myself, but because there are\nfew people who are able to understand my Geometry, and since\nyou will want me to tell you what my own view of it is, I think it\nappropriate that I should tell you that it is such that I could not\nwish to improve it. In the Optics and the\nMeteorology I merely tried to show that my method is better\nthan the usual one; in my Geometry, however, I claim to have\ndemonstrated this. Right at the beginning I solve a problem which\naccording to the testimony of Pappus none of the ancients managed to\nsolve; and it can be said that none of the moderns has been able to\nsolve it either, since none of them has written about it, even though\nthe cleverest of them have tried to solve the other problems which\nPappus mentions in the same place as having been tackled by the\nancients (To Mersenne, end of December 1637; AT 1, 478; CSMK,\n77\u201378).\n\n\nAs great as Descartes\u2019 confidence in his solution to the Pappus\nProblem, there are questions that surround his synthesis of the\ngeneral problem in Book Two.\n\nAs indicated above, Descartes attempts to establish via his synthesis\nthat the curves that solve the Pappus Problem are\n\u201cgeometric\u201d by his own stated standard, that is, that the\nPappus curves are constructible by the \u201cprecise and exact\u201d\nmotions needed to construct genuinely geometric curves. However, it is\nnot at all clear that Descartes has proven this point. Even when\naddressing the basic four-line Pappus Problem in Book Two, Descartes\ndoes not appeal to motions that are evidently clear and distinct as he\nconstructs the Pappus curves that solve the problem (in this case, the\ncircle, parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse). Rather, he relies on\nApollonius\u2019s theory of conics, which requires that a cone be cut\nat a designated point in the plane, and as Bos remarks, this\nApollonian technique for constructing conics \u201cis not a method of\nconstruction that immediately presents itself to the mind as clear and\ndistinct\u201d (Bos 2001, 325). Specifically, since it was not\nevident to mathematicians at the time whether constructions that\nrequired locating a cone in the plane met the exact and rigorous\nstandards of geometrical reasoning, Descartes\u2019 treatment of the\nPappus curves in this four-line case does not convincingly demonstrate\ntheir \u201cgeometric\u201d status. Later in Book Two, when he\ntreats the five-line Pappus Problem, matters get more complicated.\n\nRecall that in addition to his emphasis on the \u201cprecise and\nexact\u201d motions that can be used to describe legitimately\ngeometrical curves, Descartes also claims that these curves \u201ccan\nbe conceived of as described by a continuous motion or by several\nsuccessive motions.\u201d As such, we would reasonably expect that\nthe geometrical construction of these curves should not proceed\npointwise in the manner of Book One, where Descartes constructed the\nPappus curves by solving the equations to which the problem had been\nreduced. However, when Descartes treats the five-line Pappus Problem\nin Book Two, he in fact offers a pointwise construction of the Pappus\ncurve. He then remarks that the pointwise construction of this\n\u201cgeometric\u201d Pappus curve is importantly different from the\npointwise construction of non-geometrical, \u201cmechanical\u201d\ncurves:\n\n\nIt is worthy of note that there is a great difference between this\nmethod in which the [Pappus] curve is traced by finding several points\nupon it, and that used for the spiral and similar curves. In the\nlatter, not any point of the required curve may be found at pleasure,\nbut only such points as can be determined by a process simpler than\nthat required for the composition of the curve\u2026On the other\nhand, there is no point on these [\u201cgeometric\u201d] curves\nwhich supplies a solution for the proposed problem that cannot be\ndetermined by the method I have given (G, 88\u201391).\n\n\nThe suggestion from Descartes is that when we pointwise construct a\ngeometric curve, we can identify any possible point on the curve, and\nimmediately after the above remarks, he proceeds to equate curves\nconstructed in this manner with curves that could possibly be\nconstructed by continuous motions: \u201cthis method of tracing a\ncurve by determining a number of its points taken at random applies\nonly to curves that can be generated by a regular and continuous\nmotion\u201d (G, 91).\n\nThis distinction between the pointwise construction of\n\u201cgeometric\u201d and \u201cmechanical\u201d curves serves two\nrather important purposes in the program of La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie: (1) Descartes can establish that the\nPappus curves he has pointwise constructed are in fact\n\u201cgeometrical\u201d and thereby complete his synthesis (or\ndemonstration) of the general Pappus Problem, and (2) he can maintain\na boundary between intelligible \u201cgeometric\u201d curves and\nunintelligible \u201cmechanical\u201d curves. Without a clear\nindication of why the pointwise construction of a Pappus curve is\n\u201cgeometric,\u201d Descartes would have to allow\n\u201cmechanical\u201d curves such as the spiral and quadratrix into\nthe domain of geometrical curves, since these curves can also be\npointwise constructed. Recall for instance Clavius\u2019s pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix. According to Clavius\u2019s\ndescription, we begin with a quadrant of a circle and then identify\nthe points of intersection between segments that bisect the quadrant\nand segments that bisect the arc of the quadrant (see\n figure 9).\n That is, we identify the several intersecting points of segments\nwhich are constructible by straightedge and compass, and then, to\ngenerate the quadratrix, we connect the intersecting points, which are\nevenly spaced along the sought after curve. Why is such a pointwise\nconstruction not \u201cgeometric\u201d? Because, according to\nDescartes, if we proceed as Clavius does, \u201cnot any point of the\nrequired curve may be found at pleasure.\u201d Specifically, given\nthe restrictions of Euclidean construction, we are only able to divide\nthe given arc into \\(2^n\\) parts. As such, what\nDescartes suggests is that it is not possible to divide the arc any\nway we please, and we cannot therefore locate any arbitrary point\nalong the curve by use of pointwise construction. In the case of the\n\u201cgeometric\u201d curves, however, we can find any arbitrary\npoint on the curve by appeal to the equations corresponding to the\nproblem; or borrowing Bos\u2019s terminology, Descartes is claiming\nthat \u201cgeometric\u201d curves, and the Pappus curves in\nparticular, can be generated by \u201cgeneric\u201d pointwise\nconstructions.\n\n\nFigure 9.\n\n\nWhile consideration of Clavius\u2019s construction of the quadratrix\noffers some reason to accept Descartes\u2019 distinction between the\ndifferent sorts of pointwise constructions, there remains the\ncontroversial claim that curves described by \u201cgeneric\u201d\npointwise constructions are curves that can be constructed by\ncontinuous motion. This identification allows Descartes to establish\nPappus curves as \u201cgeometric\u201d curves, but he offers no\nproof of the identity, and thus, there is question of whether\nDescartes has in fact demonstrated that the Pappus curves are\n\u201cgeometric\u201d by his own standards. (See Grosholz 1991 and\nDomski 2009 for alternative ways of addressing this tension.)\n\nThere is a further question surrounding Descartes\u2019 criterion for\n\u201cgeometric\u201d curves. As we have seen above,\nDescartes\u2019 explicit concern in Book Two is to offer a standard\nfor geometrical curves that is bound with intelligible, clear and\ndistinct motions needed for their construction. However, Mancosu\n(2007) offers a compelling case that behind Descartes\u2019 explicit\nremarks in La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie lies a more fundamental\nconcern: To ensure that those curves mathematicians had used to square\nthe circle, such as the spiral and quadratrix which are explicitly\nmentioned in Book Two, are rendered non-geometrical. Mancosu supports\nhis case with evidence from Descartes\u2019 correspondence that\nshows, for Descartes, it is in fact possible in some instances to\nclearly and distinctly conceive the relation between a straight line\nand a circle, a relation he had considered inexact in La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie. Namely, in a 1638 letter to Mersenne,\nDescartes writes,\n\n\nYou ask me if I think that a sphere which rotates on a plane describes\na line equal to its circumference, to which I simply reply yes,\naccording to one of the maxims I have written down, that is that\nwhatever we conceive clearly and distinctly is true. For I conceive\nquite well that the same line can be sometimes straight and sometimes\ncurved, like a string (To Mersenne, 27 May 1638; AT 2, 140\u2013141;\ntranslation from Mancosu 2007, 118).\n\n\nIn La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, the relation between straight\nand curves lines was considered inexact because, as Descartes put it,\n\u201cthe ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and\nI believe cannot be discovered by human minds\u201d (G, 91). That\nDescartes later admits that he can clearly and distinctly conceive\nsuch a relation suggests, according to Mancosu, that the stated\ncriteria for geometrical curves presented in La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie reveals only part of Descartes\u2019\nmathematical agenda. A more complete portrait must, Mancosu argues,\ntake into account Descartes\u2019 commitment to the impossibility of\nsquaring the circle (see Descartes\u2019 letter to Mersenne, 13\nNovember 1629, AT 1, 70\u201371; translated in Mancosu 2007, 120; see\nalso Mancosu and Arana 2010 for further evidence in support of the\nposition of Mancosu 2007).\n\nWhether Descartes had the hidden agenda that Mancosu suggests, the\nexplicit claims used to define the program of problem-solving\npresented in La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie point to the\nlimitations of Descartes\u2019 mathematics. As we have seen above,\nDescartes\u2019 primary focus is on a standard for geometry\u2019s\n\u201cexactness of reasoning\u201d that is bound to clear and\ndistinct motions for construction and to the finite equations to\nrepresent curves so constructed. Consequently, there is no room in the\nprogram of La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie to use infinitesimal in\nthe construction of curves or to treat curves represented by infinite\nequations. As such, Descartes eliminated from his geometrical program\nthe very elements of mathematical and geometrical reasoning that made\nit possible for Newton and Leibniz to develop the calculus come the\nlate seventeenth century. Nonetheless, given how quickly Descartes\nhoned his mathematical skills and how quickly he developed his\ninnovative program for geometry, it would not be too risky to accept\nDescartes\u2019 self-assessment and maintain some confidence that the\ncalculus would have been in his reach had he considered the\ninfinitesimal and the infinite:\n\n\nhaving determined as I did [in La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]\nall that could be achieved in each type of problem and shown the way\nto do it, I claim that people should not only believe that I have\naccomplished more than my predecessors but should also be convinced\nthat posterity will never discover anything in this subject which I\ncould not have discovered just as well if I had bothered to look for\nit (To Mersenne, end of December 1637; AT 1, 478; CSMK,\n78\u201379).\n\n",
