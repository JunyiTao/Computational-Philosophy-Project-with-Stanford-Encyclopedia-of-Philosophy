    "main_text": "The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge || Epistemic security\n1.1 Epistemic security\n\nThe strongest epistemic claims on behalf of self-knowledge are\ninfallibility and omniscience. One is infallible about one\u2019s own\nmental states if and only if (hereafter, \u201ciff\u201d)\none cannot have a false belief to the effect that one is in a certain\nmental state. One is omniscient about one\u2019s own states\niff being in a mental state suffices for knowing that one is\nin that state. (This omniscience thesis is sometimes expressed by\nsaying that mental states are self-intimating or\nself-presenting.) Few if any contemporary philosophers\nmaintain that we are infallible or omniscient about all of our mental\nstates. Here is a simple example that challenges both infallibility\nand omniscience. Kate trusts her therapist\u2019s insights into her\nown psychology, and so she believes him when he tells her that she\ndistrusts her mother. But the therapist is mistaken\u2014in fact,\nKate trusts her mother. Hence, Kate\u2019s self-ascription I\ndistrust my mother shows that she is fallible about her own\nattitudes (mistakenly taking herself to distrust her mother) and that\nshe is not omniscient (she fails to recognize that she trusts her\nmother).\n\nIn the case described, Kate\u2019s belief about her attitude is based\non the testimony of another person. A more restricted infallibility\nthesis would limit the relevant domain to self-ascriptions based on an\nexclusively first-personal method\u2014perhaps\nintrospection. Descartes thought that we could in principle\nachieve infallibility in this circumscribed realm, but only by\nexercising meticulous care:\n\n\nThere remains sensations, emotions and appetites. These may be clearly\nperceived provided we take great care in our judgments concerning them\nto include no more than what is strictly contained in our\nperception\u2014no more than that of which we have inner awareness.\nBut this is a very difficult rule to observe, at least with regard to\nsensations. (Descartes 1644/1984: I.66, p. 216)\n\n\nA common objection to even restricted infallibility claims is the\nidea, often attributed to Wittgenstein, that where one cannot be\nwrong, one cannot be right either. For instance, Wright maintains that\nthe possibility of error is required for concept application, which is\nin turn required for substantial\nself-knowledge.\u201c[E]rror\u2014if only second-order\nerror\u2014has to be possible, if a genuine exercise of concepts is\ninvolved\u201d (Wright 1989: 634).\n\nIn its unqualified form, the omniscience thesis seems even less\nplausible than the unqualified infallibility\n thesis.[1]\n On pain of regress, omniscience seems to require that self-knowledge\nis not always a matter of grasping one mental state by being in\nanother: that is, it seems to require that some mental states\ncomprehend themselves (so to speak). James rejected this idea.\n\n\nNo subjective state, whilst present, is its own object; its object is\nalways something else. (James 1884: 2)\n\n\nSome modify the omniscience thesis by claiming that, for some states,\nanyone who is in a state of that kind is justified in believing that\nshe is, even if the thinker doesn\u2019t actually have this belief\n(Peacocke 1999; Siewert 1998; Silins 2012; Smithies 2012). Horgan and\nKriegel (2007) defend a modified omniscience thesis, based on the idea\nthat sensations are by definition conscious.\n\nOthers argue that we are infallible or omniscient about our beliefs\nand other attitudes because there is a constitutive connection between\nthe first-order attitude and the belief that one has that attitude\n(see 3.6 and 3.7). This connection varies. On some views, so long as\nwe are rational and have the relevant concepts, believing that p\nconstitutes a belief that one believes that p (Shoemaker\n1994). Others reverse the constitution relation: taking oneself to\nbelieve that p can constitute believing that\np (Coliva 2012a, Bauman 2017).\n\nClaims of infallibility and omniscience concern general relations\nbetween beliefs about mental states and those mental states\nthemselves. The most famous philosophical argument involving\nself-knowledge, Descartes\u2019 cogito argument (Descartes\n1641/1895), does not concern these general relations. Instead, it\nconcerns the certainty of a particular instance of belief.\nDescartes aims to demonstrate that, so long as you are carefully\nattending to your own thoughts, you can know with certain that\nyou\u2019re thinking\u2014and, hence, that you exist. This can be\ncertain even if there is a supremely powerful evil genius who controls\nyour thoughts and seeks to deceive you.\n\nPerhaps the most widely accepted view along these lines is that\nself-knowledge, even if not absolutely certain, is more secure,\nepistemically, than other kinds of empirical knowledge\u2014most\nobviously, perceptual knowledge. Some who take this line maintain that\nthere is a causal gap between a perceptual state and its object, and\nthis gap introduces sources of error that are absent in direct\nintrospective apprehension of a sensation (Russell 1917; Chalmers\n2003; Gertler 2012; Horgan 2012; Siewert 2012).\n",
