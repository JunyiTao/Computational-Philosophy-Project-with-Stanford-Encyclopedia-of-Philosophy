    "main_text": "The Scope of Interventionist Accounts\n11. The Scope of Interventionist Accounts\n\nOne context in which issues about the range of cases in which\ninterventionist account may be legitimately or fruitfully applied\nconcerns \u201ccosmological\u201d claims in which fundamental\nphysical theories are understood as applying to the whole universe.\nConsider the following claim\n\n(4) The\nstate \\(S_t\\) of the entire universe at time \\(t\\) causes the state\n\\(S_{t +d}\\) of the entire universe at time \\(t+d\\), where \\(S_t\\) and\n\\(S_{t+d}\\) are specifications in terms of some fundamental physical\ntheory.\n\n\nOn an interventionist construal,\n (4)\n is unpacked as a claim to the effect that under some possible\nintervention that changes \\(S_t\\), there would be an associated change\nin \\(S_{t+d}\\). This raises the worry that it is unclear what would be\ninvolved in such an intervention (given that there is nothing in\naddition to \\(S_t\\) that might realize the intervention) and unclear\nhow to assess what would happen if it were to occur, given the\nstipulation that \\(S_t\\) is a specification of the entire state of the\nuniverse.\n\nCommenting on an example like this, Pearl writes:\n\n\nIf you wish to include the whole universe in the model, causality\ndisappears because interventions disappear\u2014the manipulator and\nthe manipulated lose their distinction. (2009: 419-20)\n\n\nNote that here Pearl seems to invoke a notion of intervention that is\ndifferent from (and stronger than) a pure setting conception. After\nall, as Reutlinger (2012) notes, it is arguable that there is no\nproblem about imagining the state of the universe at \\(S_t\\) set to\nsome different value and then determining by reference to the laws\ngoverning its evolution what its state will be at \\(S_{t\n +1}\\).[5]\n Pearl\u2019s remark seems to assume that the imagined intervention\nhas to meet some additional constraint beyond this (having to do in\nsome way with the possibility of realizing the intervention).\nPearl\u2019s claim is controversial\u2014it is discussed\nsympathetically by Hitchcock 2007b and Woodward 2007 and criticized by\nother writers such as Reutlinger 2012.\n\nWe will not try to resolve the issues surrounding this particular\nclaim of Pearl\u2019s here, but there is a related and more general\nissue concerning the implications of interventionism for the status of\ncausal claims in physics, even outside of cosmological contexts, that\ndeserves discussion. Return to the contrast between explicating causal\nclaims by appealing to a pure setting notion of intervention and,\nalternatively, explicating them by reference to interventions that\nmeet some further non-trivial constraints regarding possibility, as\ndiscussed above. Consider cases in which there is a physical law\naccording to which there is counterfactual dependence between \\(Y\\)\nand \\(X\\) but interventions on \\(X\\) are in some appropriately\nrelevant sense impossible. A pure setting treatment may conclude that\nsuch relationships are causal while an account relying on a\npossibility constrained notion of intervention will not.\n\nTwo possible illustrations are discussed in Woodward (2016). The field\nequations of General Relativity describe a lawful or nomological\nrelationship between the stress energy tensor and the spacetime\nmetric. \u201cSetting\u201d the former to different values (by\nspecifying initial and boundary conditions) one may calculate the\nassociated different values of the latter. One may doubt, however,\nthat it is appropriate to think of the field equations as describing a\ncausal relationship between the stress-energy tensor and the\nmetric. It is arguable that a possibility constrained interventionist\naccount supports this judgment: specification of the stress energy\ntensor requires reference to the metric in such a way that\ninterventions on the former with respect to the latter will violate\nthe conditions\n M1\u2013M4\n for an intervention. One might conclude on these grounds that\nalthough there is a relation of nomic dependence between the state of\nthe stress energy tensor and the metric, this relation is not causal.\nEmployment of a setting conception of intervention seems to realize\nthe opposite conclusion.\n\nAs a second example, the spins of the entangled particles in an\nEPR\u2013type experiment are lawfully related by a conservation law.\nIt is arguable (cf. Skyrms 1984; Butterfield 1992) that many standard\nphilosophical theories, including regularity and Lewis-style\ncounterfactual theories treat this relationship as causal, and a\nsetting version of an interventionist theory seems to suggest a\nsimilar conclusion. By contrast, various no signaling theorems are\ncommonly interpreted as implying that it is impossible both to\nintervene on one of the separated spin settings and to use the\nrelationship between the two settings to manipulate the other setting.\nIn this case a possibility constrained version of interventionism can\njudge that no causal relationship is present. Although the matter is\ncontroversial among philosophers, most physicists agree with this\njudgment of non-causality.\n\nBoth of these examples illustrate different implications of setting\nand possibility constrained versions of interventionism in physics\ncontexts and how the latter framework requires more than just the\npresence of a nomically sufficient condition or law-based\ncounterfactual dependence for causation. More generally, if one\nthinks, as many philosophers of physics and some physicists do, that\ncausal concepts do not apply, at least in any straightforward way, to\nsome or many fundamental physics contexts, then it is arguably a\nconsideration in favor of a version of interventionism that imposes a\nnon-trivial possibility constraint that it might be used to support\nthis judgment. By contrast, a setting version of interventionism will\ntend to find causation in physics whenever there is nomic\ndependence.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion recently both about the extent\nto which fundamental physics is causal and about what interventionist\nframeworks imply about the status of causal claims in physics. A\nnumber of the essays in Price and Corry 2007 (Price 2007; Hitchcock\n2007b; Woodward 2007) express varying degrees of skepticism about the\napplicability of causal notions in portions of physics, in part on the\nbasis of interventionist considerations. By contrast, Frisch (2014)\nargues vigorously that many physical theories, at least in classical\nphysics, such as classical electromagnetism, make extensive use of\ncausal concepts and that the relevant notion of cause is captured by\nthe interventionist framework and associated technical ideas (such as\nstructural equations and directed graphs). He suggests that writers\nlike Price, Hitchcock, and Woodward (in his 2007 but see his 2016 for\na more nuanced view) underestimate the degree to which interventionist\nideas of causation are applicable to such contexts. Of course it is\nalso possible, consistently, with the views of both Frisch and these\nother writers, that causal notions, understood along possibility\nconstrained interventionist lines, are important in many areas of\nphysics but that there are other physical theories that are not\nfruitfully interpreted as making causal claims, whether understood\nalong interventionist or other lines. In any case, the question of the\nscope of interventionist theories and their implications for causal\nclaims in fundamental physics is an important and at present\nunresolved\n issue.[6]\n",
