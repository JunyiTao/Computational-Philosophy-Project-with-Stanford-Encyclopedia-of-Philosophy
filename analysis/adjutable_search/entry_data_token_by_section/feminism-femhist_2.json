    "main_text": "Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist || Gendered Interpretations of Philosophical Concepts\n1.2 Gendered Interpretations of Philosophical Concepts\n\n\nIf we consider Aristotle's theory of hylomorphism we find a connection\nbetween form and being male, and matter and being female. That is, we\nfind that matter and form are gendered notions in Aristotle (Witt\n1998). By a gendered notion we mean a notion that is connected either\novertly or covertly, either explicitly or metaphorically with gender or\nsexual difference.[3]\n Furthermore, matter and form are not equal\npartners in Aristotle's metaphysics; form is better than matter. And\nsince hylomorphism is the conceptual framework that underlies most of\nAristotelian theory from metaphysics and philosophy of mind to biology\nand literary theory, it looks as if his supposedly universal and\nobjective theories are gendered, and it looks as if his negative\ncharacterization of women tarnishes his philosophical theories.\n\n\nAre Aristotle's theories intrinsically gendered and sexist, so that\ngender cannot be removed without altering the theories themselves?\nSeveral feminist philosophers have developed this thesis. For example,\nin \u201cWoman Is Not a Rational Animal\u201d, Lynda Lange argues that\nAristotle's theory of sex difference is implicated in every piece of\nAristotle's metaphysical jargon, and she concludes that \u201cit is not at\nall clear that it [Aristotle's theory of sex difference] can simply be\ncut away without any reflection on the status of the rest of the\nphilosophy\u201d(Harding and Hintikka 1983: 2). Elizabeth Spelman has argued\nthat Aristotle's politicized metaphysics is reflected in his theory of\nsoul, which, in turn, is used to justify the subordination of women in\nthe Politics (Spelman 1983). And, finally, Susan Okin has argued that\nAristotle's functionalist theory of form was devised by Aristotle in\norder to legitimate the political status quo in Athens, including\nslavery and the inequality of women (Okin 1979: ch. 4).\n\n\nIf these scholars are right, then Aristotle's theories are\nintrinsically biased against women, and it is unlikely that they can\nhave any value for feminists beyond the project of learning about the\nways in which the philosophical tradition has devalued women.\nAlternatively, Charlotte Witt has argued that the suspect gender associations with\nAristotelian matter and form are extrinsic to these concepts, and\ntherefore removable from Aristotle's theories without substantially\naltering them (Witt 1998). The argument that Aristotle's gender\nassociations are not intrinsic to his concepts of matter (female) and\nform (male) turns on the incompatibility of the position that matter is\nintrinsically female, and form intrinsically male with the position\nthat every composite substance is a unity of matter and form. If every\ncomposite substance is a complex of matter and form, then each would be\na hermaphrodite, rather than a male or a female as is the case with\nanimals. Moreover, whatever plausibility gender associations with\nmatter and form might have with regard to animals, is lost entirely\nwhen we consider artifacts, like shoes and beds. If intrinsic gender\nassociations with matter and form are incompatible with Aristotle's\ntheory of substance and extrinsic gender associations are compatible\nwith that theory, then the principle of charity dictates that we opt\nfor the consistent interpretation.  Recent work on sexism in Aristotle's philosophy\nfocuses on his theory of animal reproduction in the biological writings.\nTo what extent and in what ways is Aristotle's theory of animal generation sexist?\n(Henry 2007; Nielsen 2008)  A related issue concerns how Aristotle's view of\nsexual difference in the biology is connected to his ideas about sexual\ndifference in the \u201cPolitics\u201d. (Deslauriers 2009) \n\n\nSometimes, as in the case of Descartes, the feminist argument in\nfavor of a gendered theory is subtle since, unlike Aristotle, he\nexpresses both a personal and a theoretical commitment to equality.\nFurther, his theories are not stated using gendered notions. Yet, some\nfeminists have argued that his theory of mind-body dualism and his\nabstract characterization of reason resonate with gender implications\u2014\non the assumption that women are emotional and bodily creatures (e.g.\nScheman 1993; Bordo 1987; Lloyd 1993b, ch. 3).\n",
