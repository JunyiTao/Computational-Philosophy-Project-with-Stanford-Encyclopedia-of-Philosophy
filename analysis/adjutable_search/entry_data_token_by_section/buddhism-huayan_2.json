    "main_text": "Basic Concepts || Basic Arguments\n1.3 Basic Arguments\n\nThrough the fusion of the ideas of the Avatamsaka Sutra and\nAwakening of Faith in Mahayana, Huayan Buddhism developed a\ndistinctive interpretation of the concepts of \u201cemptiness\u201d\nand \u201cno-self.\u201d The original Indian Buddhist view that\nthere are no selves transformed into the Chinese Buddhist view that\nthere is no individual self, but there is a sort of\ntranspersonal self (One Mind) of which all the transient and\nontologically interdependent aspects of reality are parts. The\nfundamental human vice is selfishness, which is caused by the illusory\nbelief in individual selves, and the fundamental human virtue is\nuniversal compassion, which is caused by the recognition that we are\nall parts of one, transpersonal reality. To fail to have compassion\nfor another person is like ignoring a wound to my own limb because it\nis temporarily numb. \n\nHuayan inherits from Madhyamaka the view that all entities are\nconditioned. To be conditioned is for an entity to be causally or\nconceptually dependent for its existence and its identity on something\nelse. However, Huayan takes the additional steps of arguing that,\nbecause the identity of any one thing is dependent on the identities\nof other things, \u201cone is all,\u201d and because the whole is\ndependent for its identity on its parts, \u201call is one.\u201d\nHuayan adopts from Yogacara the terms \u201crepository\nconsciousness\u201d (alayavijnana) and \u201cwomb of the\nBuddha\u201d (tathagatagarbha), which it uses to describe\nthe reality of the world in itself. The Third Patriarch Fazang\n(discussed more below) illustrates how \u201cone is all and all is\none\u201d with the relationship between a rafter and the building of\nwhich it is a part. He argues that the building is the rafter, because\nthe building is nothing more than the sum of its parts, so each part\nis essential to its identity. Conversely, the rafter is the building,\nbecause what makes the rafter a rafter is its role as a part of the\nbuilding. (Intuitively, if the rafter were removed from the building,\nits identity could change to being a bench, or a teeter-totter, or\nsimply kindling.) \n\nOne of the metaphors from the Avatamsaka Sutra that is\nfrequently used to illustrate mutual interdependence is Indra\u2019s\nnet (or \u201cIndra\u2019s web\u201d). According to pre-Buddhist\nmyth, the god Indra has a net with a jewel at the intersection of\nevery two strands. Each jewel is so bright that it reflects every\nother jewel in the net. This is adopted as a metaphor for the manner\nin which each thing that exists is dependent for both its existence\nand its identity upon every other thing that exists. \n\nSince the only thing that exists is this reality, the world of\nillusion (samsara) is no different ontologically from\nnirvana. (The slogan \u201cNirvana is\nsamsara\u201d is antecedently present in Madhyamaka.) In other\nwords, samsara is simply a mistaken perception of the same\nultimate reality experienced in enlightenment. Fazang illustrates this\nwith the metaphor of a statue of a golden lion (Fazang 2014a). We\nshould not deny or fail to perceive the conventional fact that the\nstatue appears to be a lion. However, we must realize that there is no\nsense in which a lion is actually there, and even the appearance of\nthe lion is not a separate entity beyond the gold that is present. The\ngold can take on different forms (ore, ingots, coins, etc.), but in\nitself it is ultimately unchanging. Similarly, we should not deny or\nfail to perceive that ordinary reality appears to consist of distinct,\npersistent individuals. However, we must realize that there are not\nactually distinct, persistent individuals. All that really exists is\nthe complete network of mutually interdependent entities\n(dharmas), and this network (extended through all of time and\nspace) is eternal and unchanging. \n",
