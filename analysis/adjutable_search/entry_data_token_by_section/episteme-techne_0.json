    "main_text": "Xenophon\n1. Xenophon\n\nXenophon\u2019s only sustained discussions of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea are in two of\nhis Socratic works, Memorabilia and Oeconomicus. The\nMemorabilia recounts conversations which Socrates held on a\nvariety of topics; the Oeconomicus is a conversation largely\ndevoted to one, i.e., the art of running a successful estate and\nhousehold. In these works, knowledge is intimately tied to knowing how\nto do things, especially the more organized kind of knowing-how\ndesignated by techn\u00ea. There is no distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as theoretical knowledge and\ntechn\u00ea as mere craft or skill. Socrates explicitly\nidentifies as technai such activities as playing the harp,\ngeneralship, piloting a ship, cooking, medicine, managing an estate,\nsmithing, and carpentry; by association with these technai,\nwe can include housebuilding, mathematics, astronomy, making money,\nflute playing, and painting. Without marking any difference, he also\ncalls many of these activities epist\u00eamai.\n\nAt the beginning of Memorabilia, Xenophon, in fact, portrays\nSocrates as uninterested in the abstract investigations of the\nphysical philosophers. Socrates, he says, eschewed the investigation\nof the kosmos; he preferred looking into human affairs.\nBesides, humans cannot understand the universe, as shown by the\ninability of those who engage in these kinds of study to agree\n(I.i.11\u201314). In fact, towards the end of the work, Xenophon says\nthat Socrates held that the study of geometry should be pursued to the\npoint where one could measure a parcel of land he meant to buy; study\nof more complicated figures he disparaged because he did not see the\nuse of it (IV.vii.3). If after this introduction we did not expect to\nfind a very great difference between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea, we would not be disappointed.\n\nAlmost all occurrences of the word\n\u2018epist\u00eam\u00ea\u2019 show its close connection\nto skill, practice, and techn\u00ea. In a jocular vein,\nCritoboulos says he wants to gain the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) which will allow him to win over those\nwith good souls and beautiful bodies (II.vi.30). Socrates compares the\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) of justice to the knowledge\nof letters, i.e., a skill (IV.ii.20). As well, the verb\nepistasthai \u2014 the root of epist\u00eam\u00ea\n\u2014 carries the sense of knowing how to do something. The stronger\nknow how to use (chr\u00easthai) the weaker like slaves\n(II.i.12\u201313). If one does not know how to pilot (m\u00ea\nepistamen\u00f4(i) kubern\u00e2n) a ship \u2014 a\ntechn\u00ea \u2014 both he and his ship will be lost\n(II.vi.38). One must learn the crafts (technai) of war from\none who knows them (epistamenon) (II.i.28). Socrates says\nthat some of the sub-skills of generalship \u2014 which elsewhere he\ncalls a techn\u00ea \u2014 come by nature and others come\nthrough knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) (III.i.6\u20137).\nThe difference is between what is not acquired and what is acquired;\nbut we find no distinction \u2014 as in Plato \u2014 between what is\nacquired by teaching and what is acquired by training. Thus Xenophon\ndoes not make the Platonic distinction between theoretical instruction\nand learning by practice (cf. Meno 70a\u2013b).\n\nSocrates emphasizes that learning an epist\u00eam\u00ea\n\u2014 what we would call a field of knowledge \u2014 entails care,\ndiligence, and practice. He says that idleness does not put knowledge\nworthy of mention into the soul; one must also have care or diligence\n(epimeleia) for doing fine and good deeds (II.i.20). Free men\n(actually gentlemen farmers) who are not idle but exercise diligence\n(epimelomenous) in those useful things they understand\n(epistantai) are happiest; work and application\n(epimeleian) help men to learn what they need to know and to\nremember what they learn (II.vii.7\u20138). Near the beginning of the\nMemorabilia, Socrates argues against those who say that a\njust man can never become unjust. Rather, he says, those who do not\ntrain the soul (askountas) cannot carry out the functions of\nthe soul (I.ii.19\u201320). Diligence and training, then, are the\nbasis of these skills, not a theoretical grasp of principles.\n\nEven at his most theoretical, Xenophon\u2019s Socrates shows a\npractical bent. Saying that those who know what each virtue is can\nexpound these to others, he gives definitions for the virtues. A pious\nman, for instance, knows the laws respecting the worship of the gods\nand thus worships the gods lawfully; and, in general, the man who\nknows what is lawful with respect to the gods (ta peri tous theous\nnomima eid\u00f4s) is pious (IV.vi.1\u20134). The pious man,\nthen, is defined by informed religious practice. The most abstract\ndefinition would seem to be that of wisdom. Claiming the wise are wise\nby knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea(i)), Socrates says wisdom\nis knowledge. Next, however, he cautions that no one can know all\nthings; so a person is wise to the extent that he knows (IV.vi.7).\nKnowledge, then, can be accumulated. Since knowledge is divided into\nvarious skills, such as managing an estate and generalship, and their\nsubdivisions, the wise man would appear to be someone who acquires as\nmuch of this kind of knowledge as possible. If so, he is a person of\nwide accomplishments, not someone with a theory about the\nuniverse.\n\nThroughout the Memorabilia, Xenophon weaves the theme of the\ncraft of ruling (basilik\u00ea techn\u00ea).  This craft is the finest of\nvirtues and technai, by which men, public and private, become\ncapable of ruling and benefiting other men and themselves (IV.ii.11).\nKings and rulers are not simply those who are chosen but those who\nknow how to rule (tous epistamenous archein). In this regard\nthey are compared to others who exercise a techn\u00ea, such\nas ship\u2019s pilots (III.ix.10\u201311). A good king does not just\nmanage his own life well but also that of the ones he rules and he is\nthe cause of their happiness (III.ii.2\u20133). However, he also\nargues that rulers have a more pleasant life than those who are ruled.\nHis interlocutor, Aristippus, takes him to be claiming that the ruling\ncraft is happiness. In answer, Socrates describes the life of what is\nobviously a gentleman, capable of winning good friends and subduing\nenemies, fit in body and soul to manage his household, to help his\nfriends, and serve his country (II.i.19\u201320). These constitute\nthe happy life of the gentleman; they also make him able to make\nothers happy (IV.i.2\u20133). Although\nruling is associated with happiness (eudaimonia), Socrates is\nnot tempted to generalize about happiness; instead of an account of happiness,\nhe enumerates the activities of a flourishing member of the\ndominant class.\n\nIn the Oeconomicus, Socrates uses knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and craft (techn\u00ea)\ninterchangeably to refer to the practical undertakings of a gentleman,\ncalled in Greek kalos k\u2019agathos \u2014 literally one\nwho is fine and good. He opens the work with the question whether\nestate management (oikonomia) is the name of a type of\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) like medicine, smithing, and\ncarpentry. Then he asks whether he and his interlocutor can say what\nthe function (ergon) of estate management is, just as they\ncan say what are the functions of these other technai\n(I.1\u20132). When he uses epist\u00eam\u00ea in what\nfollows, the focus of his discussion is some aspect of estate or\nhousehold management. He refers indifferently to the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and the craft (techn\u00ea)\nof estate management and of farming; the latter includes sub-skills\nsuch as breeding stock (V.3) casting seed (XVII.7) and the planting of\ntrees (XIX.1). However, there is a distinction between illiberal arts\n(banausikai technai) and those worthy of a gentleman. The\nlatter are the craft of war (polemik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea) and that of farming (ge\u00f4rgia).\nThe illiberal arts confine one to the workshop and narrow one\u2019s\ninterests to his own welfare; the crafts of war and farming give one a\nwider scope so that he can attend to his friends and city\n(IV.2\u20134; VI.5\u20139). In fact, farming is the mother and nurse\nof the other technai (V.17). However, knowledge by itself is\nnot sufficient to prosper. There are those who have the knowledge and\nresources to increase their estates but are unwilling to do so (I.16).\nOthers, like Socrates\u2019 respondent Critoboulos, might gain such\nknowledge but do not have the wealth necessary to make use of it\n(II.11\u201313). Still, Socrates says, knowledge is not sufficient to\nprofit but one also needs care and diligence in order to put his\nknowledge into effect (XX.2\u20136). This unused knowledge is not\nuntried theory but neglected skill.\n",
