In phase one, Habermas\nformulates (D) as follows:\n\n(D)\nOnly those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet)\nwith the approval of all in their capacity as participants in a\npractical discourse (1983 [1990: 66]).\n\n\nHe initially calls (D) \u201cthe principle of discourse ethics\u201d\n(1983 [1990: 66]). It takes the form of a straightforward validity to\nconsensus (or possible consensus) conditional. The scope of the\nconsensus is \u201call those affected\u201d by the norms. As such it\nis universal among participants in practical discourse, namely among\nall agents.\n\nIn addition, there is principle (U)\u2014the principle of\nuniversalization, which spells out the \u201ccriterion for\ngeneralizing maxims of action\u201d (1983 [1990: 62]). Every valid\nnorm has to fulfil the following condition:\n\n(U)\nAll affected can accept the consequences and the side effects its\ngeneral observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of\neveryone\u2019s interests (and these consequences are\npreferred to those of known alternative possibilities (1983 [1990:\n65]).\n\n\nHabermas first introduces (U) as \u201ca rule of argument that makes\nagreement in practical discourses possible\u201d (1983 [1990: 66]).\nIn phase one he begins with a justification of (U), and then infers\n(D) (1983 [1990: 93]). The initial idea was that (U) was to be given a\n\u201ctranscendental pragmatic\u201d derivation from the rules of\ndiscourse, and (D) inferred from (U). The nature of the putative\ntransition between (U) and (D) however remains unclear (Lumer 1997:\n49), and Habermas has not succeeded in clarifying it.\n\nIn the 1983 programme, after having distanced himself from\nApel\u2019s programme, Habermas proposes to justify (U) by deriving\nit logically from two premises: (1) the rules of discourse and (2)\n\u201cthe idea of the justification of norms\u201d or \u201ca weak\nidea of normative justification\u201d (1983 [1990: 92, 97]). Later,\nin phase two, Habermas reverses the order of justification, and infers\n(U), now designated the \u201cmoral principle\u201d, from (D). At\nthe same time, he weakens (D) by making it apply generally to all\nnorms of action whether moral or not, and labels it \u201cthe\ndiscourse principle\u201d:\n\n(D)\nOnly those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected\npersons could agree as participants in rational discourse\n(1992b [1996b: 107]).\n\n\n(D) now merely \u201cexpresses the meaning of post-conventional\nrequirements of justification\u201d (1992b [1996b: 107]), and is\ngiven along with premise (2). It supposedly merely explicates\n\u201cthe point of view from which action norms can be impartially\ngrounded\u201d (1992b [1996b: 109]). While Habermas weakens (D) he\nstrengthens (U).\n\n\na norm is valid if and only if the foreseeable consequences\nand side effects of its general observance for the interests and\nvalue-orientations of each individual could be freely\naccepted jointly by all concerned. (1996a essay 1:\n60 [1998a: 42 translation amended])\n\n\nNeither Habermas\u2019s followers, with the possible exception of\nRehg (1991 & 1994), nor any of his critics, think that this\nlogical derivation of (U) goes through. Gradually, Habermas backs away\nfrom the claim that (U) can be given a logical or formal derivation.\nHe presents discourse ethics as a \u201cprogramme\u201d of\nphilosophical justification and keeps adding stronger premises to that\nprogramme (Lumer 1997: 53; Habermas 1983 [1990: 43]). According to\nKettner the fact that in phase two (D) is no longer the principle of\ndiscourse ethics, but construed as \u201cstill neutral\u201d with\nregard to morality and law, together with the fact that (U) is now the\nmoral principle, means that the grounding of discourse ethics\nis normatively incomplete, and this effectively amounts to the\n\u201cdisappearance\u201d of the original project, which was\nsupposed to show that the moral principle and the moral point of view\nfall out of the success conditions for communicative action (Kettner\n2002: 207, 211\u201312).\n\nTo sidestep the absence (or failure) of a logical derivation of (U),\nHabermas presents (U) provisionally as an abductive hypothesis (1996a\nessay 1: 60 [1998a: 42]) where abduction is an inference to the best\nexplanation. Ott makes an attempt to justify (D) and (U) as a\nconjunction of pragmatic implications (Ott 1996: 42\u201345), while\nFinlayson claims that U is best thought of as an inference to the best\nexplanation, and both agree that it rests on supplementary premises\ndrawn from Habermas\u2019s modernization theory (Finlayson 2000; Ott\n1996). This raises the question of what kind of justification of the\nmoral standpoint Habermas has in mind. In Moral Consciousness and\nCommunicative Action he presents discourse ethics as a defence of\na cognitivist account of morality against the moral sceptic on grounds\nthat even the sceptic must accept (1983 [1990: 76ff]). The\nphilosophical programme of justification looks like a\nconstructivist\u2014and what Gunnarsson calls a\n\u201crationalist\u201d\u2014argument, invoking slender premises\nand reaching thick normative conclusions, albeit the said normative\nconclusions are not substantial moral norms, but a moral principle of\nuniversalization, and an account of the moral point of view, in which\nmoral agents (participants in discourse) collectively validate\nsubstantial moral norms (Gunnarsson 2000: 99, see also Rees 2020:\n678\u201381, 689\u201391). Gunnarsson argues that all\nHabermas\u2019s rationalist arguments for (U) fail. Benhabib is also\nof this view. In an early critique she argued that (U) was redundant,\nand that (D) should be given a \u201cweak justification\nprogramme\u201d which adduced supplementary moral premises of\n\u201cuniversal respect\u201d and \u201cegalitarian\nreciprocity\u201d (Benhabib 1986: 308; 1992: 31). Habermas\u2019s\ntendency to add ever stronger supplementary premises for his\njustification of (U) is a tacit acknowledgement of his failure to\nprovide either a formal derivation or a \u201crationalist\u201d\njustification of (U). In doing so he moves away from his original idea\nof providing a philosophical justification of (U), towards a more\nmodest explication and reconstruction of the moral point of view,\nwhich can be corroborated by insights drawn from an array of\ndisciplines, including the moral psychology of Lawrence Kohlberg.\n",
