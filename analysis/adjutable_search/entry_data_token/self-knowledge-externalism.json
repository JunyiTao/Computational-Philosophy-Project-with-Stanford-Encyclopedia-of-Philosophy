The view has garnered\nattention since it denies the traditional assumption, associated with\nDescartes, that thought content is fixed independently of the external\nworld. Apparently under this assumption, Descartes also believed that\nhe could know the content of his thoughts while suspending all\njudgment about his environs. (Indeed, such knowledge was thought\nindubitable.) Yet if externalism is correct, this may well be a\nmistake. As we shall see, externalism can suggest that Descartes is\nunable to know that his own thought represents, say, elm trees (vs.\nbeech trees) without knowing that it is elms (and not\nbeeches) that the thought is connected to in the world. But if such\nworldly knowledge is a prerequisite, then Descartes could not know the\ncontent of this thought just \u201cfrom the armchair,\u201d so to\nspeak. So there seems to be a conflict between externalism and such\narmchair knowledge of one\u2019s own thought contents (for short:\n\u201carmchair self-knowledge\u201d). The question whether this\nconflict is real is what drives the contemporary debate on externalism\nand self-knowledge.\n\nOfficially, we can put the issue in terms of an apparent tension\nbetween the following:\n\n\n\n(EXT)\nThought content is determined partly by the\n environment.[2]\n\n\n(SK)\nA subject can know from the armchair what content her thoughts\n have.[3]\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is that EXT seemingly implies that knowing about content\nrequires knowing about the environment. And since the latter is\nempirical, so too would be the former, contra\n SK.[4]\n Now it is usually thought that, if EXT is incompatible with SK, this\nwould be a serious problem for EXT (though some think internalism also\nconflicts with SK; see McLaughlin & Tye 1998a, Farkas 2003, Bar-On\n2006, p. 434). Yet some think the incompatibility threatens SK instead\nof EXT (see section\n 2.4).\n Regardless, the interest in the debate goes beyond EXT, for it\npertains to many central concerns of philosophers, such as the nature\nof knowledge and the relation between mind and world. The debate also\ntouches on more specialized topics, including memory, concept\nacquisition, epistemic responsibility, and transcendental\narguments.\n\nIn the standard terminology, the dispute is between\nincompatibilists who affirm the conflict between EXT and SK,\nand compatibilists who deny it. Incompatibilists have pressed\nthe conflict mainly in two ways. The first way, discussed in section\n2, is by a reductio ad absurdum: Incompatibilists argue that EXT plus\nSK entail the absurdity that one can know just from the armchair\ncontingent facts about the external world. The second way, discussed\nin section 3, features a thought experiment about \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d between two environments. Incompatibilists argue that\nsuch thought experiments show that EXT precludes SK. In section 4, we\nwill end with some lesser-known issues for externalist\nself-knowledge.\n", "toc": [{"#WhyExt": "1.

Why Externalism?\n\nGiven the tension with SK, why should we accept EXT in the first\nplace? One reason is that EXT is more or less entailed by many\ncontemporary theories of content. For instance, several theories say\n(in short) that a\n concept[5]\n has its content in virtue of certain causal relations the concept\nbears to an environmental referent (Dretske 1981, Millikan 1984; 1989,\nFodor 1987; 1990; also, cf. Kripke 1972 and Evans 1982, ch. 6). Others\nsee mental content as posited when interpreting a subject\nvis-\u00e0-vis objects in her environment (Davidson 1973; 1987,\nDennett 1975). Still others see content as determined by the\ninferences that feature the relevant concept. Such an inference,\nmoreover, is often defined partly by the environmental object which\nnormally prompts the inference, or in which the inference normally\nterminates (Sellars 1954).\n\nPredictably, such theories face various difficulties\u2014so none\nprovide a decisive case for EXT. Yet the foremost arguments for the\nview are not so parochial. These arguments instead rest on various\nthought experiments, purporting to show that internally identical\nsubjects can host different thought contents, solely because of\nenvironmental differences (Putnam 1973; 1975, McGinn 1977, Stich 1978,\nBurge 1979; 1982; 1986). If the thought experiments are right about\nthis, then internal states do not wholly determine thought content.\nThe environment would play a part as well.\n\nThe most famous experiment imagines a remote planet called \u201cTwin\nEarth,\u201d a planet which is superficially indiscernible from Earth\n(so that even its events parallel the events on Earth). But there is\none key difference: The compound H2O occurs nowhere on Twin\nEarth. In its place is a different compound that looks, tastes, etc.,\nexactly the same, which we may call \u201cXYZ\u201d. Now consider\nOscar, a normal adult English speaker, along with his Twin Earth\ndoppelg\u00e4nger, Twin Oscar. (Ignore that people are mostly\nH2O; that\u2019s an accident of this example.) The\nexternalist intuition is that, even if these \u201ctwins\u201d are\nunschooled in chemistry, Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to refer to\nH2O yet Twin Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to refer to\nXYZ. After all, when Oscar asserts \u201cwater is scrumptious,\u201d\nthis is directed at water, yet Twin Oscar\u2019s parallel assertion\nis in reference to XYZ, a.k.a. twin\n water.[6]\n\nMoreover, suppose we accept the Fregean view that the meaning of a\nterm determines what the term refers to (or in Carnap\u2019s words,\nthat \u201cintension determines\n extension\u201d).[7]\n Then, given the different referents, the twins\u2019 terms must have\ndifferent meanings as well. But Oscar and Twin Oscar are\nphysical duplicates; so it appears the meaning of \u2018water\u2019\nis not wholly fixed by speakers\u2019 internal states. Rather, the\nenvironment also figures into\n it.[8]\n\nThis claim about linguistic meaning is then extended to the content of\nmental representations for natural kinds like water, and for\nnon-natural kinds like sofas (where the latter are defined by\nsocial convention) (McGinn 1977, Stich 1978, Burge 1979; 1982; 1986).\nConsider that when Oscar says \u201csofas are delightful,\u201d he\nexpresses a thought that references sofas. But suppose that\nTwin Oscar\u2019s community defines a \u201csofa\u201d slightly\ndifferently, so that broad, overstuffed armchairs count as\n\u201csofas.\u201d Consequently, when Twin Oscar asserts\n\u201csofas are delightful,\u201d he differs from Oscar in\nexpressing a thought that refers to (among other things) broad,\noverstuffed armchairs. But again, if content determines reference, the\ndifference in reference demonstrates a difference in intension or\ncontent, in spite of identical internal\n states.[9]\n Thus we arrive at EXT.\n\nSome might find these science fiction stories extravagant, and it may\nbe unclear whether they teach us anything about the real world. Yet\nthere are actual examples which also illustrate the point (Ludlow\n1995b; see also Butler 1997, Tye\n 1998).[10]\n Consider that \u2018chicory\u2019 and \u2018endive\u2019 have\ntheir denotations switched between Standard American English and\nBritish English. The two types of salad green also seem identical to\nthe untrained eye (or palate, as the case may be). Thus a Brit and an\nAmerican, both untrained, might be internally the same in all relevant\nrespects, yet refer to different greens when asserting \u201cchicory\nis scrumptious.\u201d So \u2018chicory\u2019 will express a concept\nwith different content, despite the subjects being internally alike.\n(Notably, \u2018water\u2019 itself might vary in content among\ndifferent locations in the actual world. What flows from taps contains\ndifferent admixtures in different municipalities. Cf. Malt 1994.)\n\nNevertheless, some philosophers reject these considerations for a\nvariety of reasons (Zemach 1976, Mellor 1977, Searle 1983, ch. 8, Bach\n1988; 1998, Crane 1991, Rosenberg 1994, Chomsky 1995; 2000, Segal\n2000, Martinich & Stroll 2007, ch. 5, Farkas 2008, Pollock 2015;\nsee also Fine 1975). Other philosophers do not reject EXT as much as\nrestrict it: They posit a kind of content\u2014so called\n\u201cnarrow\u201d content\u2014which is determined independently\nof the environment (Block 1986, Loar 1988, Georgalis 1994; 1999,\nChalmers 1996; 2002, Jackson 1998, Siewart 1998, Horgan & Tienson\n2002, Wikforss 2007, Mendola 2008; see also the entry on\n narrow content).\n As one illustration, two-dimensionalists characterize narrow content\nas a function that takes an environment as input and outputs the\n\u201cwide\u201d content of the concept in that environment, i.e.,\nthe content of which EXT is true (Chalmers 1996; 2002). And\nputatively, the problem with armchair self-knowledge does not arise\nwith narrow content. (For more, see Fernandez 2004 as well as the\nentry on\n two-dimensional semantics.)\n\nThe debate on whether EXT is unrestrictedly true is important, but\nthis is not the place to discuss it. (Yet see the entry on\n externalism about mental content.)\n For our purposes, the main point is that EXT is not without support,\nand so there is some reason to hold onto the view despite the apparent\ntension with SK.\n2. The Reductio to Armchair Knowledge of the External World\n\nBut is the tension real? One pro argument is a reductio ad absurdum:\nThe claim is that EXT and SK jointly entail an obvious falsehood,\nnamely, that Oscar can know from the armchair contingent facts about\nthe external world (McKinsey 1991; 1994; 2002; 2007, Brown 1995,\nBoghossian 1997; 1998). If so, then EXT and SK cannot be jointly true,\nand the incompatibilist wins the debate.\n\nThe argument is this: Assume EXT and SK for reductio, and\nlet\u2018E\u2019 name the Environmental condition\nthat EXT requires for a concept to have a water content (versus a twin\n content).[11]\n Apparently, then, EXT and SK imply that Oscar can know from the\narmchair\u2014or in the incompatibilist\u2019s idiom, know\n\u201capriori\u201d\u2014both of the following:\n\nIf Oscar is thinking that water is wet, then E\nobtains.\nOscar is thinking that water is wet.\n\n\nIn this, p is known apriori (or just: \u201cp is\napriori\u201d) iff p is known without a concerted empirical\ninvestigation of the external world. (Note that introspective\nknowledge counts as \u201capriori\u201d in this context, even though\nit arises from a kind of introspective experience. For more on the\npresent conception of the apriori, see Miller 1997, Davies 1998,\nNuccetelli 1999, and McLaughlin 2000; 2003). On the current line, (1)\ncan be known apriori if EXT is true (though as we shall see, there are\ndifferent ways to spin this). Whereas, (2) is apriori given SK. Yet if\nOscar has apriori knowledge of both (1) and (2), Oscar can then use\nmodus ponens to know apriori that:\n\nE obtains.\n\n\nBut E is an environmental condition that presumably can only be\nknown empirically. So EXT and SK apparently lead to an absurd sort of\napriori knowledge, and are thus incompatible. (Henceforth, call this\nargument \u201cthe reductio.\u201d)\n\nBefore we consider the compatibilist\u2019s replies, one\nclarification of the reductio is in order. For it may be unclear\nwhether EXT entails (1) in the first place (whether apriori or not).\nHowever, if EXT is derived from one of the causal theories of content\n(from section\n 1),\n then acquiring the water concept requires causally interacting with\nwater (if only via your linguistic community). (See McGinn 1989, ch. 1\npassim, McCullough 1999, but contrast with McLaughlin & Tye 1998a,\nBall 2007.) Thus possessing the concept requires the existence of\nwater, meaning that the view entails (1). Even so, if the\nincompatibilist wants to add that (1) is entailed apriori,\nshe would need the contentious premise that some causal theory of\ncontent is entirely apriori.\n\nSo on a more charitable reading, the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio\ndoes not target an externalism based on a causal theory. It is rather\ndirected at a view based solely on the Twin Earth thought experiments,\ngiven that the experiments are more naturally seen as apriori. (But\nsee Baker 2007.) For the remainder of section 2,\n\u2018externalism\u2019 and \u2018EXT\u2019 shall refer\nexclusively to this kind of Twin Earth based externalism.\n2.1 Reply 1: Environmental Implications are Empirical\n\nYet it may remain unclear whether EXT is committed to (1). For the\nthought experiments alone do not assume that water is\nnecessary for water thoughts (Brueckner 1992). The thought\nexperiments indeed assume that suitable interaction with water is\nsufficient for Oscar to have water thoughts. They also assume\nthat Twin Oscar\u2019s interactions with XYZ are insufficient. But\nthis does not yet imply that interacting with water is the\nonly way that someone can arrive at water thoughts.\n\nHowever, this assumes that E is a condition where water exists\n(or existed at one time). Yet the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio\nneed not assume that (McKinsey 1994; 2002; 2007). One can first see\nthe incompatibilist as presenting a dilemma, corresponding to two ways\nthat EXT might be interpreted. On the first reading, EXT holds that a\nwater thought logically or conceptually implies some\nenvironmental condition E. Yet for the incompatibilist, logical\nor conceptual implications are apriori. So if EXT on this first\nreading is true, (1) is apriori (and nothing here prejudges what\nE\n is).[12]\n\nEven so, the first reading is not the usual interpretation of EXT. On\na more standard construal, EXT holds that a water thought\nmetaphysically implies some environmental condition E.\nYet metaphysical implications, e.g., that\u201cwater is wet\u201d\nimplies \u201cH2O is wet,\u201d are not always apriori.\n(See Kripke 1972 and the entry on\n Rigid Designators).\n So the apriority of (1) is not guaranteed here, and the reductio\nseems in doubt.\n\nYet incompatibilists reply that the second reading cannot be what is\nreally intended. For it renders EXT into something\ntrivial\u2014it is obvious that Oscar\u2019s water thoughts\nmetaphysically imply a number of external conditions, e.g., that Oscar\nwas born (McKinsey, 1994; 2002; 2007, Rowlands 2003). But EXT is\nsupposed to be more substantive than that. Compatibilists reply,\nhowever, that the thought experiments suggest that a water thought\nmetaphysically implies some content specific environmental\ncondition, such as the existence of water (Brueckner\n1995).\n\nSo the way seems clear for the compatibilist to reject the apriority\nof (1). But as before, the incompatibilist may respond that we are\nillicitly assuming E to be the condition simply that water\nexists. Yet the strongest version of the reductio may not assume that.\nOne might instead understand E as follows:\n\nE = Water or a community using the water concept exists\n(or, existed) (Brown 1995, Boghossian 1997).\n\n\nIf E is identified as this disjunctive condition, it is more\nbelievable that (1) is apriori under EXT. And if that is believed, the\nreductio then presses that EXT permits apriori knowledge that\neither water or a community exists. Yet that too\nshould not be apriori.\n\nBut assuming (4), why would EXT render (1) apriori? Granted, many\nexternalists find it apriori plausible that besides interacting with\nwater, Oscar could acquire the water concept from other community\nmembers. That suggests that if Oscar has acquired the concept, (4)\nmust be true. However, some externalists conjecture that there are\nother conditions under which the water concept can be acquired. Even\nif Oscar is socially isolated and lives in a waterless environment, he\ncan conceivably arrive at the concept by hypothesizing the\nH2O molecule (Burge 1982). If this cannot be ruled out\napriori, then EXT does not secure the apriority of (1)\u2014even if\n(4) is assumed.\n\nYet incompatibilists reply that (ironically) these very\nreflections reveal apriori something that should not be apriori\n(Brown 1995, Boghossian 1997). Namely: If Oscar is aware that\nhe has no such hypotheses (i.e., if he is \u201cagnostic\u201d about\nchemical essences), then (1) must be knowable apriori. In more detail,\nif Oscar is agnostic about chemistry and knows that apriori about\nhimself, he can use the reflections above to know apriori that his\nwater thoughts metaphysically require the existence of water or a\ncommunity. From there, apriori knowledge of E seems\nimminent.\n\nNevertheless, the compatibilist\u2019s opening objection lingers:\nNothing yet shows that the only ways to acquire water\nthoughts, under EXT, are in the ways catalogued so far (Ball 2007).\nFor all that has been shown, it remains possible that essence-agnostic\nOscar is socially isolated and his water thoughts reference no natural\nkind. (See also Gallois & Hawthorne 1996, Gallois 2008, and\nMcLaughlin & Tye 1998a, b, c.)\n\nBut perhaps additional apriori considerations can rule this out (Brown\n1995). Suppose that Oscar has the concept of a sofa and knowledgeably\napplies the concept in a variety of cases. Yet assume he is agnostic\non whether the concept applies to broad overstuffed armchairs. Then,\nif Oscar has no community to settle the matter, EXT may suggest that\nOscar\u2019s concept is indeterminate in what it refers to.\nAnd that seems odd.\n\nHowever, the compatibilist may ask why this is supposed to be a\nproblem (McLaughlin & Tye, 1998a, b, c). The indeterminacy may\nshow only that Oscar\u2019s concept is vague and not that\nOscar fails to possess any concept whatsoever. (Brown 2001 replies by\ndefining \u2018agnostic\u2019 so it applies only if the concept is\nnon-vague. Yet Brown 2004, ch. 8 concedes that Oscar then can no\nlonger know apriori if he is \u201cagnostic.\u201d) So, here too, it\nseems that EXT does not reveal apriori that water thoughts\nmetaphysically require a content specific environmental condition.\n2.2 Reply 2: Externalism about Empty Concepts\n\nStill, it may remain intuitively compelling that a Twin Earth thought\nexperiment, if cogent, would show (1) apriori\u2014even if E\nis just the condition where water\n exists.[13]\n For the experiments seem to show apriori that, to have the bona fide\nwater concept, the concept must be non-empty, i.e., its\nreferent must exist. However, a compatibilist can counter this by\noffering a semantics of empty concepts that is consonant with EXT\n(Stoneham 1999, Sawyer 2003, Goldberg 2006b, Haukioja 2006, Parent\n2017, ch. 4; see also Pryor 2007, pp. 184\u2013185). Even so, there\nare two arguments in the literature suggesting that any externalist\nview of empty concepts must fail (Boghossian 1997; 1998, Segal 2000,\nBesson 2012).\n\nOn its face, empty-concept externalism can be supported by a Twin\nEarth thought experiment (Boghossian\n 1997).[14]\n Consider \u201cDry Earth\u201d\u2014a planet exactly like ours,\nexcept wherever water occurs on Earth, there are only watery looking\nholograms (though Dry Earthians mistake these for a real kind). The\nintuition is that unlike Oscar, Dry Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to\nexpress an empty concept. And if Dry Oscar is not referring to water,\nthen as before, the Frege-Carnap view implies that his concept has a\ndifferent intension or content. So even for empty concepts, content\nseems determined partly by facts about the environment (including\nfacts about what is absent from the environment).\n\nHowever, carrying this further may lead to absurdity, since\nexternalism about empty concepts can suggest that a concept\u2019s\nform is sensitive to the environment (Boghossian 1997; 1998).\nSuppose, as is plausible, that empty concepts have a\ndescriptive form\u2014so that (e.g.) the unicorn concept is\nunderstood as the concept \u201chorse with a horn.\u201d For most\nexternalists, this contrasts with our concept of water which does not\nhave a descriptive form, but is rather atomic. If that is correct,\nthen Dry Oscar expresses a descriptive concept when using\n\u2018water\u2019, whereas Oscar expresses an atomic one. In which\ncase, the environmental difference creates a difference in\nform as well as content. But that is strange, since form\nseems to be a purely syntactic matter, fixed entirely by what\u2019s\nin the head.\n\nAt least one compatibilist has tried embracing environment-dependent\nsyntax, though he concedes it is an uncomfortable view (Ludlow 2003;\n2011). At the least, such a stance would seem ad hoc (Besson 2012).\nOthers question the \u201csupervenience principle\u201d in the\nargument, viz., that a difference in form necessitates a difference in\ninternal state (Corb\u00ed 1998, Brown 1999, Korman 2006, Parent\n2015a, 2017, ch. 4). Further argument has been offered for this\nprinciple (Boghossian 1998), yet such arguments may beg the question\nby presupposing a Chomskian, internalist notion of logical form\n(Parent 2015a, 2017, ch. 4\u007f).\n\nHowever this issue unfolds, externalism about empty concepts faces a\nfurther challenge (Segal 2000, pp. 54\u201356). Consider: Either the\nexternalist sees the unicorn-concept as necessarily empty or\n not.[15]\n If the former, then the view implies that unicorns are impossible\nobjects, like round squares. And that is rather counterintuitive (yet\nsee Kripke 1972 on unicorns). But taking the other horn (sorry), a\ncontingently empty concept would have its content fixed by descriptors\nlike \u201chorse with a horn.\u201d In this case, EXT seems false.\nFor the constancy of the descriptors guarantees that the concept has\nthe same content in every possible world, whether or not it contains\nunicorns (Segal 2000; see also Besson 2012). (But for replies, see\nKorman 2006 and Parent 2015a, 2017, ch. 4.)\n2.3 Reply 3: Transmission Failure\n\nIf externalism about empty concepts fails, then EXT may well entail\n(1) apriori, per the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio. But a\ncompatibilist could try a different line of resistance. She might\nsimply grant that (1) and (2) are apriori, but still try to block\napriori knowledge of (3). (Here too, E is assumed to be just\nthe condition where water exists, though it is believed that similar\npoints hold if (4) is true instead.) The most prominent strategy of\nthis type is to deny the \u201ctransmission of warrant\u201d that\nsupposedly occurs in the deduction of (3) from (1) and (2) (hereafter,\n\u201cthe deduction\u201d). The idea is that, even if the\nexternalist agrees that (1) and (2) are warranted, none of this\nwarrant \u201ctransmits\u201d to (3) in the deduction (Davies 1998;\n2000; 2003a; 2003b, Wright 2000a; 2000b; 2003; 2011; 2102; 2015; see\nalso Wright 1985). If so, the deduction cannot furnish apriori\nknowledge of (3), pace the incompatibilist.\n\nFor brevity, let us call the advocate of transmission failure\n\u201cthe advocate.\u201d Then, the advocate\u2019s core idea is\nthat even though (1) and (2) entail (3), they do not prove\n(3). For in brief, the \u201cproof\u201d seems question begging (cf.\nMcLaughlin 2000). \u2018Question begging\u2019, however, may not be\nthe right word here (Beebee 2001, Prichard 2002, Silins 2011). Still,\nthe idea is that (3) in some sense is presupposed, once the deduction\ngets started. If such circularity is operative, then the deduction\ncannot create any warrant for (3), much less prove it. Or in the\nadvocate\u2019s idiom, the warrant for (1) and (2) cannot\ntransmit to (3) in virtue of the deduction.\n\nAs a satisficing\n approximation,[16]\n the transmission of warrant generally occurs iff:\n\n\n\n(TW)\nIf a subject S is warranted in believing p and is\nwarranted in believing that p entails q (and S\nfurther recognizes that q follows deductively from these\nbeliefs)\u2014then S acquires, potentially for the first time,\na warrant in believing q. (Cf. Wright 2000a, p.\n140\u2013141.) \n\n\n\nYet (TW) should be distinguished from epistemic closure, as discussed\nby some anti-skeptics (e.g., Dretske 1970). Some compatibilists think\nthat the reductio also exemplifies a failure of epistemic closure (see\nBernecker 2000, Hale 2000, Sawyer 2006, although see Sawyer 2015 for a\n\u201ccontrastive\u201d account that upholds closure). Regardless,\ntransmission failure is a different affair, if only because epistemic\nclosure concerns \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than\n\u201cwarrant.\u201d Nevertheless, warrant transmission differs even\nfrom the \u201cclosure of warrant,\u201d characterized as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n(CW)\nIf S is warranted in believing p and warranted in\nbelieving that p entails q, then S is warranted\nin believing q (or is able to be thus warranted). \n\n\n\nThe difference between transmission and warrant closure is best seen\nin cases of question begging. Take an overtly circular argument which\nconcludes (3) using (3) as a premise. Trivially, anyone warranted in\nbelieving the premise is warranted in believing the conclusion. So\n(CW) is satisfied in this case. But the argument does not\ntransmit warrant to its conclusion; it cannot bestow any\nwarrant on (3) that was not already there. From a different angle, a\nperson cannot use the argument to gain knowledge of (3) for the\nvery first time. Hence, warrant fails to transmit onto the\nconclusion, even though warrant closure holds\n trivially.[17]\n\n\nThe advocate thus cries \u201ctransmission failure\u201d in relation\nto (1)\u2013(3), on the grounds that (3) is\n\u201cpresupposed.\u201d Yet in this case, the presupposition charge\nis not as straightforward. For clarity\u2019s sake, let us call (1)\nand (2) the \u201c*premises\u201d of the deduction, to contrast them\nwith the premises of the reductio. (The latter are stronger in\nclaiming that the former are apriori.) Then, the advocate bases the\npresupposition charge on the following: An externalist can rationally\ngrant that the *premises are warranted only if she has certain\n\u201cbackground assumptions\u201d which already imply (3).\nThe point is sometimes framed in terms of \u201cinformation\ndependence:\u201d An externalist who grants warrant to the *premises\n\u201crationally requires certain collateral information\u201d that\nincludes (3) (Wright 2000a, p. 149). Consequently, an\nexternalist\u2019s \u201cacceptance of those [background]\nassumptions cannot be rationally combined with doubt about the truth\nof [(3)]\u201d (Davies 2003a, p. 43, but contrast Davies 2000, p.\n402).\n\nFor simplicity (since rational externalists are the only ones we care\nabout), assume henceforth that \u201cthe externalist\u201d is\nrational. Then, the presupposition charge is most readily appreciated\nvia the following\n approximation:[18]\n When considering the reductio,\n\n\n\nB(3)\nAn externalist grants that the *premises are warranted only if\n(3) is already among her Background assumptions. \n\n\n\nNote: B(3) is a \u201csecond order\u201d thesis about the\ndialectics of the reductio; the antecedent is a condition where the\nexternalist grants that the *premises are warranted\n(regardless of whether they are warranted). Thus\nB(3) says that the externalist will be presuming (3), if\nshe concedes warrant to the *premises in the first place. It is in\nthis sense that (3) is presupposed once the deduction is mobilized,\nresulting in transmission failure.\n\nAn argument for B(3) has yet to be given, but there are two\non offer. The first opens with the remark that, since EXT requires\nwater for thinking \u201cwater is wet\u201d (as all parties are\ncurrently allowing), the same is true of the self-attributing thought\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that water is wet.\u201d (Davies 2000\n2003a, 2003b). However, if a person regards this metaphysical claim as\nwarranted along with (2) \u2014then she cannot rationally\nput (3) in doubt. For if the existence of water were in doubt, then\ngiven her warranted metaphysical claim, this rationally compels a\nfurther doubt on whether the thought expressed by (2) exists\nin the first place. But the existence of the thought must be\nacknowledged before one can concede a warrant to it. So our\nexternalist will rationally allow a warrant to both *premises only if\nshe already assumes (3) as background, which is just what\nB(3)says.\n\nThe second argument we might attribute to a character called\n\u201cWrightgenstein\u201d or just \u201cW.\u201d for short, since\nit originates in Crispin Wright\u2019s interpretive work on\nWittgenstein. Qua externalist, W. acknowledges the possibility of\nerror in discerning one\u2019s own mental contents, as when Dry Oscar\nmisjudges his empty concept to have a natural kind content. Even so,\nhe sees no reason to surrender the warrant possessed by ordinary\njudgments about content. This parallels a natural view of perceptual\njudgment: Even though perceptual illusions occur, ordinarily we still\npossess warrant for our perceptual judgments about the world. W.\nthinks this is because our ordinary perceptual and self-attributing\njudgments enjoy a kind of \u201cdefault\u201d warrant. Such a\nwarrant discounts the possibility of illusion, even when one has\ngathered no supporting empirical evidence. Though if a reasonable\nsuspicion arises, the default no longer applies. But ordinarily our\njudgments are \u201cpresumed innocent\u201d of error until proven\n(or at least evidenced to be) guilty; this in turn is rooted in our\ncommunal practices, and is justified on pragmatic grounds (Wright\n2000a, p. 152\u2013153).\n\nAll this is important for B(3), since if W. grants (2) a\nwarrant in the absence of empirical investigation, it will be a\ndefault warrant (at least in part). And this kind of warrant exists\nonly in ordinary cases. Thus, he grants this warrant only if\nhe assumes that there is no Dry Earth illusion where (3) merely\nappears to be true. So in particular, in the context of the reductio,\nW. allows an apriori warrant to the *premises only if (3) is already\nassumed as background. QED\n\nLet us now consider some objections to transmission failure. One\naccuses the advocate of conflating different types of warrant (Raffman\n1998, Sainsbury 2000). Note here that, if the deduction fails to\nprove the conclusion, this does not mean it transmits no\nwarrant at all. (Beebee 2001, Burge 2003). The objector accordingly\nsuggests that the deduction indeed transmits a warrant, though it is a\n\u201cthinner\u201d warrant, i.e., a warrant that is weaker than\nwhat a proof would bestow. But if a thinner warrant transmits, then\ncontra the advocate, the deduction indeed confers some apriori warrant\n(albeit non-demonstrative warrant) onto (3). This, then, vindicates a\nversion of the reductio\u2014for the intuition is that we cannot\nwarrant apriori a claim about the world at all. \n\nBut is this intuition correct? To evaluate it we need further clarity\non what a \u201cthin\u201d warrant is. Some understand this as the\nwarrant failing as a warrant for equivalent propositions. For\ninstance, a non-empirical thin warrant for (2) may fail to warrant the\nextensionally equivalent \u2018I am thinking that H2O is\nwet\u2019 (Davies 2003b, p. 114 and 118). Alternatively,\n\u201cthinness\u201d for W. may reflect that the warrant is not\nsomething earned by gathering empirical or proof-theoretic\nevidence. It is instead just a defeasible \u201centitlement\u201d\nthat holds only in the ordinary cases (Wright 2003).\n\nIf the latter is what \u201cthinness\u201d consists in, then an\nadvocate could try to grant the transmission of a thinner\nwarrant\u2014but still emphasize that transmission failure is the\nrule when the warrants are thicker (Davies 2003b, but compare Wright\n2003, p. 72). Yet an advocate might take a stronger stance by doubting\nwhether any thinner warrants transmits. After all, this\nputative warrant dissipates immediately once any earnest doubt is\nraised (Wright 2000b, yet contrast with Wright 2003; 2011).\n\nA different objection to the advocate is that, despite appearances,\nshe ends up surrendering SK after all. This is because (3) is\nempirical and it is conceded that (2) presupposes (3) (cf. Wright\n2000, p. 151\u2013152). And so, it is hard to see how (2) can be\nwarranted purely apriori if it presupposes empirical facts about the\nworld.\n\nIn response, at least one externalist has relinquished apriori\nknowledge of (2), but emphasizes that some self-knowledge still\nremains apriori (Rowlands 2003, ch. 8). In particular, an externalist\ncould still know apriori that:\n\nIf E obtains, then I am thinking that water is wet.\n\n\nBut for his part, W. thinks apriori knowledge of (2) should not be\nsurrendered. Instead, he claims we should not assume that the warrant\nfor (3) is inevitably empirical. For (3) ordinarily has a\nnon-empirical \u201cdefault\u201d warrant. So given that (2)\npresupposes (3), a non-empirical warrant for (3) makes possible an\napriori warrant for (2). Even so, W. is quick to remind us that a\ndefault warrant for (3) is too \u201cthin\u201d to prove\n(3).\n\nHowever, if the advocate grants an apriori warrant to (3), this may\nsuccumb already to the reductio (Brown 2003; 2004, Sawyer 2006,\nBrueckner 2006). For the absurdity was not that an apriori warrant\ntransmits; instead, it was in thinking that (3) can be apriori\nwarranted at all. \n\nAdvocates can respond in two different ways here. One is to be neutral\non whether (3) is apriori warranted. A neutral position may suffice\nfor the advocate\u2019s purposes, since transmission failure occurs\nif (3) is presupposed, regardless of whether it is apriori\nwarranted (Davies 2000). But such a response is not available to W.,\nfor he clearly thinks that (3) ordinarily has a non-empirical warrant.\nStill, perhaps W. could soften this by reiterating that this is a\n\u201cthin\u201d warrant bestowed by default; it is not a warrant\nthat is transmitted onto (3) by the deduction.\n\nA final worry for W. is that he is conflating the psychological\nphenomenon of SK with something merely linguistic or\n\u201cgrammatical\u201d (Snowdon 2012). If an externalist wishes to\nexplain how knowledge of content is possible, why would she\nappeal to a linguistic convention to illuminate the matter?\nIt is clear, however, that W. never meant to forbid psychology from\nhaving its say (Wright 2015, p.54). But it is possible that our\nlinguistic practices for crediting self-knowledge have mislead us\nabout the psychological facts. An analogy with ethical expressivism is\nhelpful on this score (cf. Wright 2015, p. 55) Instead of\ninvestigating the \u201creal moral facts,\u201d ethical\nexpressivists try to account for moral discourse, precisely due to the\nsuspicion that the discourse may not be grounded in bona fide facts of\nthe relevant sort. Similarly, there may be a suspicion in W. that a\nrobust psychological phenomenon of \u201carmchair\nself-knowledge\u201d simply does not exist. Nonetheless, it may be\ndesirable for us to speak as if there was such knowledge, given our\naims and interests more broadly.\n2.4 Reply 4: Self-Knowledge is Empirical\n\nSo far, the replies to the reductio have been \u201ccombative\u201d\nin that they seek to undermine some tacit or explicit premise therein.\nYet other responses are \u201cconcessive\u201d in that they admit\nthat the reductio has a point. One concessive response is to reject\nEXT in light of the reductio, though as we saw in section 1, EXT has\nits own arguments to contend with. But a different concession,\nconsidered in this section, is to forgo SK. (There is also a\n\u201cquasi-concessive\u201d response, considered in section 2.5,\nwhere the apriority of (3) is simply embraced rather than rejected as\nabsurd.)\n\nSome incompatibilists indeed take the lesson of the reductio to be\nthat SK is false (see, e.g., McKinsey 2002). The sentiment is often\nthat SK should have been highly suspect from the start. Jacob (2004)\nonce expressed this well as follows:\n\n[T]he contemporary philosophical situation is puzzling. On the one\nhand, few if any features of the special epistemic authority granted\nby both the traditional empiricist and the traditional rationalist\npictures of introspective self-knowledge have survived recent\nphilosophical scrutiny. On the other hand, several\nphilosophers\u2026assume that the alleged special epistemic\nauthority granted to introspective self-knowledge by traditional\nepistemology can bear the burden of an argument against content\nexternalism\u2026I take externalism about the contents of an\nindividual\u2019s thoughts\u2026to be more plausible\u2026than\nanything we may think about introspective\nself-knowledge\u2026Imposing top down constraints\u2026from the\nassumptions about the alleged epistemic status of introspective\nself-knowledge sounds to me like putting the cart before the horse.\n(pp. 401, 402)\n\n\nThis attitude is encouraged by research from empirical psychology,\nwhich suggests that self-knowledge is largely an illusion. (See for\ninstance Nisbett & Wilson 1977, Nisbett & Ross 1980, Gopnik\n1983.) However, even if the research shows we are often ignorant of\nour own minds, it does not follow that this is most often the\ncase. In fact, it has been argued that the current research does not\neven preclude infallible self-directed judgments, such as those\ndescribed in section\n 3.1\n (Parent 2016; 2017, ch. 2).\n\nStill, there are other reasons to surrender SK, and this would be one\nway to understand the lesson of the reductio. For instance, well-known\nQuinean arguments exist against apriori knowledge, though this is not\nthe place to discuss these. (But see section 3 of the entry on\n Quine.)\n Ryle 1963, ch. 6 independently argued that self-knowledge is apriori;\nsuch knowledge was instead achieved via empirical observation of\none\u2019s own behavior. Yet many contemporary philosophers balk at\nthis, since it at least underestimate the \u201cauthority\u201d that\nOscar usually has in judging his own mental states (compared to\nothers\u2019 judgments) (Boghossian 1989, pp. 7\u20138). On the\nother hand, given the psychological research mentioned above, a\nneo-Rylean view may provide just the right amount of first-person\nauthority, to the extent that Oscar observes more of his behavior than\nanyone else (Ludlow & Martin 1993; Martin 1994; McGeer 1996).\n\nThere is a more recent incarnation of this sort of view, supported by\nthe latest from cognitive science (Carruthers 2011). The claim is that\none interprets sensory input when attributing thoughts to oneself,\njust as in attributing thoughts to others. However, the \u201csensory\ninput\u201d behind self-attributions may include input from\ninteroception, proprioception, and the like. Nevertheless, the view\nmaintains that interpretation of \u201cinput\u201d is central in\nboth first-person and third-person attributions of thought, which cuts\ninto so called \u201cfirst-person authority.\u201d\n\nA rather different line against SK derives from an externalist view\nabout concept possession. This view hypothesizes that possession of a\n(non-empty) kind concept requires the ability to ostend or\ndemonstratively identify instances of the kind by perceptual\nmeans (Brewer 1999; 2000a; 2000b). If so, then to possess the water\nconcept is already to know perceptually where (instances of) the stuff\nresides. That in turn normally suffices for knowing that water exists.\nSo when it comes to the reductio, the absurdity stems from thinking\nthat (2) is apriori, since knowledge of (2) already rests on knowledge\nof (3). So one can hardly learn (3) for the first time via knowledge\nof (2)\u2014the learning proceeds in the other direction.\n\nIn the acquisition process, however, the role of demonstrative\nidentification may be unclear. Nevertheless, a similar argument\nagainst SK can be formulated as long as some kind of\nempirical knowledge is needed to acquire the water concept. Indeed, it\nis typically assumed that a person acquires a concept from\nexperience\u2014which already portends that acquisition depends on\nempirical knowledge. Yet if that\u2019s right, then even knowledge of\n(2) has an empirical basis, since possession of the water concept\ndoes. Hence, knowledge of (2) does not qualify as purely apriori .\n\n\nIn response, a defender of SK may concede that there is a\n\u201ctraining period\u201d for acquiring a concept. Still, apriori\nknowledge might be possible in that, once the subject has acquired the\nrelevant concepts, she can use them to gain new knowledge\nwithout further empirical inquiry (Boghossian & Peacocke 2000, p.\n2). But one problem is that EXT usually portrays concept possession in\na way that blurs the distinction between the \u201ctraining\nphase\u201d and the post-acquisition phase (Hawthorne 2007, p. 213).\nFor the externalist thought experiments allow a subject to possess\n(e.g.) the sofa concept even prior to being \u201ctrained\u201d that\nno armchair is a\n sofa.[19]\n\n\nA final line against SK is that, if (1) is not apriori (as is\nplausible), it follows that apriori knowledge of (2) is impossible\n(Gertler 2004). After all, if (1) is not apriori, then Oscar\napparently cannot discriminate apriori between his water concept and\nthe Dry Earthian concept. So it seems incorrect to say that (2) is\nsomething known. Now in fact, this raises the extremely\nimportant question of whether such discriminations are necessary for\nself-knowledge, but further discussion will be delayed until section\n3. The discrimination sub-literature usually addresses the \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d arguments rather than the incompatibilist\u2019s\nreductio.\n2.5 Reply 5: A Transcendental Argument?\n\nThe last response to the reductio is to deny that the argument is a\nreductio at all. Instead, this compatibilist embraces that EXT and SK\nfacilitate armchair knowledge of the world. Some externalists have\neven offered independent arguments to that effect (Putnam 1981). But\nthese independent arguments are significantly more complex, having to\ndo with model theory and Skolem\u2019s \u201cparadox.\u201d Such\nthings shall not be discussed here (but see the entry on\n skepticism and content externalism).\n\nYet as concerns the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio, it is unclear if\nany externalist accepts it as an anti-skeptical argument (though see\nPeacocke 1996, p. 152). Even if one believes that some\ntranscendental argument can succeed against skepticism, it is hard to\nbelieve that the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio is a case\nin point (cf. Davies 1998, p. 353).\n\nBe that as it may, Warfield (1998) and Sawyer (1998) are often\ninterpreted as embracing the reductio qua anti-skeptical argument. But\nthe fact is that Warfield is mostly addressing Putnam\u2019s (1981)\nargument. (Warfield mentions the reductio in passing, but he endorses\nBrueckner\u2019s 1992 compatibilism from section\n 2.1,\n instead of a transcendentalist reply.)\n\nSawyer, moreover, explicitly discourages those who interpret her\n(1998) as embracing the reductio as an anti-skeptical argument:\n\u201cRemarks by others indicate that in general the question of\nwhether externalist arguments yield apriori warrants for beliefs about\nenvironmental conditions is seen as synonymous with the question\nwhether we have an apriori refutation of external world skepticism. I\ndo not see the questions as synonymous\u201d (2006, p. 150). Instead,\nSawyer\u2019s view seems similar to that of W., where speakers are\ngiven a prima facie (albeit quite defeasible) warrant when ascribing\ntheir own mental contents. Granted, Sawyer allows that given EXT, such\na non-empirical warrant can be transmitted to\n (3).[20]\n But it is not the kind of warrant that suffices to undermine\nskepticism; the warrant is rather of the \u201cthin\u201d variety,\nnoted at the end of section\n 2.3.\n Nevertheless, although Sawyer\u2019s view is not as radical as many\nhave thought, she would face similar obstacles as W.\n3. Slow Switching Arguments\n\nWe have explored one argument against the joint truth of EXT and SK,\nnamely, the reductio to armchair knowledge of the world. But there is\na further group of arguments to the same incompatibilist end. Such\narguments rest on a different thought experiment, the \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d experiment, to bolster the incompatibility of EXT and\nSK. In brief, the new thought experiment suggests that under EXT,\nself-attributions of thought content are not sufficiently\ndiscriminating to vindicate SK.\n\nThe slow switch thought experiment again features Oscar on\nEarth\u2014yet this time, we suppose he is unwittingly\nswitched to Twin Earth (e.g., during his sleep by a secret\ngovernment operative) (Burge 1988, Boghossian 1989). Upon his arrival,\nhe then takes up his usual activities, being none the wiser. Now the\nexternalist\u2019s intuition is that although Oscar\u2019s use\nof\u2018water\u2019 on Twin Earth initially refers to water on\nEarth, over time it comes to denote XYZ. (The switch is thus a\n\u201cslow\u201d one.) After all, Oscar will acquire the habit of\nusing \u2018water\u2019 in the presence of XYZ, and of using\n\u2018water\u2019 to converse with Twin Earthians about the stuff.\nYet if \u2018water\u2019 changes its referent, then (by the earlier\nFrege-Carnap view) this signals a shift in intension or content. And\nthe change in content can occur without Oscar noticing. Indeed it\nseems Oscar cannot detect the switch just from the\narmchair.\n\nWhat this indicates is that Oscar is unable to discriminate from the\narmchair whether assertions using \u2018water\u2019 have a water\ncontent versus a twin water content. As with the original Twin Earth\nexample, the lesson here is extended to mental content as\nwell. Hence, if a \u201cwater thought\u201d is one that Oscar\nexpresses with help from the term \u2018water\u2019, the slow switch\nexperiment indicates that:\n\nOscar cannot discriminate from the armchair that his water thought\nhas a water content rather than a twin water content.\n\n\nHis inability to discriminate, moreover, seems pertinent to SK. As\nBurge (1988, p. 653) puts it, (A) can easily suggest that SK is false\nin Oscar\u2019s case, i.e.:\n\nOscar cannot know from the armchair what content his water thought\nhas.\n\n\nGeneralizing from this, (B) suggests that SK ends up false if EXT is\ntrue.\n\nIn section\n 3.1,\n we shall see that Burge denies that (A) entails (B). Yet in light of\nhis resistance, Boghossian (1989) formulates a different version of\nthe slow switch argument. This second version, known as the memory\nargument, runs as follows. As before, suppose Oscar unwittingly\nis subject to a slow-switch, so that the concept he expresses with\n\u2018water\u2019 at t1 denotes water, and the\nconcept he expresses at t2 denotes twin water. Then,\nif p is a thought that Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 in\nexpressing, the memory argument runs as follows (adapted from Ludlow\n1993a):\n\nIf Oscar forgets nothing, then what Oscar knows at\nt1, Oscar knows at t2.\nOscar forgot nothing.\nOscar does not know at t2 that he thinks\np. \nSo, Oscar does not know at t1 that he thinks\np. [from (a)-(c)]\n\n\nPremise (a) is seen as a platitude about memory (though some deny\nthis; see section\n 3.3).\n Premise (b) is regarded as stipulative, and premise (c) is thought to\nbe the lesson of the slow switch experiment. The thinking behind (c)\nis this: Even if Oscar knows his water thoughts at\nt1, yet these morph into twin water thoughts at\nt2, he no longer knows at t2 about\nany water thoughts. For Oscar no longer has water\nthoughts at t2.\n\nThere are further variations on these slow switch arguments.\nWhat\u2019s more, there ends up being multiple interpretations of the\ninitial thought experiment. (See the supplementary document,\n Variations on Slow Switching,\n for more details.) Nonetheless, all variations embody the same basic\nthought: If EXT is true, then in a slow switch Oscar cannot\ndistinguish from the armchair a water content from a twin content.\nThis then forms the basis for why EXT precludes SK. Given the two\ntypes of slow switch argument, note that sections\n 3.3\n addresses only the second type, the memory argument. The remaining\nsections, however, plausibly have some bearing on both types of\nargument.\n3.1 Reply 1: Self-Verifying Judgments\n\nAs concerns the (A) to (B) maneuver, Burge protests that this glosses\nover an especially secure type of armchair self-knowledge. The claim\nis that some judgments about one\u2019s own thought contents (a.k.a.,\n\u201csecond order\u201d judgments) are self-verifying.\nRoughly, these are judgments where \u201cthinking makes it\nso\u201d\u2014where judging \u201cI am now thinking that p\n\u201d is enough to make it true that one is now thinking\nthat p. Importantly, however, this self-verifying feature is\nlimited to one\u2019s occurrent thinking of p (in\ncontrast to any standing or dispositional thoughts).\n\nTo illustrate the self-verifying feature, consider the judgment:\n\n\n\n(W)\nI am thinking, with this very thought, that water is wet.\n\n\n\n\nBurge\u2019s idea is that in executing this judgment, one \u201cruns\nthrough\u201d the very thought that the judgment is about. That is,\njudging (W) necessitates thinking the thought that water is\nwet\u2014and thinking this thought is precisely what (W) contends. So\nthe very act of judging (W) suffices to render the judgment true. It\nis in that sense that the judgment is self-fulfilling or\nself-verifying. Besides Burge, self-verifying judgments were touted\naround the same time by Davidson (1987; 1988) and Heil (1988; 1992),\nthough others have subsequently embraced them as well (e.g., Falvey\nand Owens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Bar-On 2004, Parent 2007, 2017, chs. 3\nand 7).\n\nNevertheless, the suggestion that certain judgments are\ninfallible can seem exceedingly strong. But for one,\ninfallibility does not imply that the judgment is\nindubitable. A judgment could de facto be perfectly reliable,\nyet the subject might still have some unanswered questions about it.\nSecond, it is crucial that \u2018thinking\u2019 is construed\nminimally, in that to \u201cthink\u201d that p is not\nnecessarily to believe that p. \u201cThinking\u201d\nthat p just means having some mental state or other with the\ncontent p \u2014it does not imply any particular\nattitude toward that content.\n\nIn light of things like Freudian repression, it can be easy to dismiss\nBurge\u2019s view. But it is important that it pertains only to a\nlimited class of rather atypical judgments. For instance, it applies\nonly when the second-order judgment contains a\n\u201cself-referential\u201d mechanism, expressed in (W) by the\nphrase \u2018with this very\n thought\u2019.[21]\n Moreover, the infallibility concerns occurrent judgments that\nattribute the co-occurrent first-order thought. And the\njudgment that (W) can be true even if the subject\u2019s mind also\nharbors, consciously or unconsciously, a variety of other\nthoughts.\n\nAlthough self-verifying judgments are atypical, Burge still thinks\nthey are sufficient to block the inference from (A) to (B). For\napparently, they provide a kind of Cartesian access to one\u2019s own\nthought-contents\u2014meaning that (B) is false even if (A) is true.\nGranted, self-verifying judgments are a rarefied kind of judgment, so\nthe view is not satisfying as a general view of self-knowledge\n(Boghossian 1989, pp. 19\u201322). Still, the main goal was to block\nthe inference from (A) to (B), and self-verifying judgments seem to do\nthat.\n\nQuite a detailed literature has ensued concerning self-verifying\njudgments; the interested reader is directed to the supplemental\ndocuments,\n The Epistemic Status of Self-Verifying Judgments,\n and\n A Problem with Critical Reasoning.\n3.2 Reply 2: Relevant Alternatives\n\nA different reply to slow switch arguments may have seemed obvious\nfrom the start. It is that the slow switch thought experiment is a\nbizarre piece of science fiction, and is simply irrelevant to whether\nwe know our own thoughts from the armchair. After all, unlike\nOscar, we are not the victims of covert switches. So how\ncould the experiment bear on our capacity for armchair\nself-knowledge?\n\nThe point is often framed in terms of a \u201crelevant\nalternatives\u201d epistemology (cf. Goldman 1976; 1986). The\nsuggestion is that in order to know that p, one does not need\nto rule out every possible scenario where ~p. Rather,\nit suffices just to rule out the \u201crelevant alternatives\u201d\nwhere ~p. And ordinarily, deviant skeptical possibilities are\nnot among the relevant alternatives that a knower needs to exclude.\nThus, while driving along the countryside, one can ordinarily know if\none sees a barn\u2014even without excluding the possibility of a mere\nbarn fa\u00e7ade. For barn fa\u00e7ades are ordinarily irrelevant.\nIn the same way, slow switch possibilities ordinarily are irrelevant\nto knowing what content a thought has (Warfield 1992, Falvey &\nOwens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Brown 2004, ch. 2). Accordingly, it is\nnormally unnecessary to rule out such a possibility in order to know\nfrom the armchair one\u2019s own thought.\n\nBut what determines relevance exactly? A popular answer comes from the\nepistemic contextualists (DeRose 1995; 2009, Lewis 1998; see also the\nentry on\n epistemic contextualism).\n Contextualism in the first instance is a view about knowledge, yet it\nimplies that whether an alternative is relevant is determined by the\nevidential standards in the context. Consider that in order\nto know whether it is raining, normally one can just take a look out\nthe window. When engaging a Cartesian skeptic, however, that is\ninsufficient. For the skeptic \u201craises the bar\u201d on the\nevidence needed to know by imagining bizarre alternatives that he\nwants ruled out, e.g., the possibility that you are dreaming.\nSimilarly, some compatibilists regard slow switching as a bizarre\nskeptical possibility which makes exceedingly high the evidential\nstandards for knowledge (Hohwy 2002; Neta 2003 is also pertinent). So\nif context makes that possibility relevant, one may lose the ability\nto self-know from the armchair. Still, if switching possibilities are\nirrelevant, contextualism says that even an externalist can know her\nown thoughts from the armchair.\n\nWhen first championing the memory argument, Boghossian (1989) noted\nthe reply from relevant alternatives, yet maintained that the slow\nswitch experiment still shows a conflict between EXT and SK. For one\ncan imagine cases where slow switching is a relevant\nalternative. And in those cases, one could not rule out this\npossibility just from the armchair. Even the relevant alternatives\naccount denies the externalist armchair self-knowledge in such a\nscenario. Still, why does this reveal a problem with our\nself-knowledge? If slow switching actually occurred on a regular\nbasis, it would be a relevant alternative that could not be excluded\nfrom the armchair, and the externalist would lose SK. But to\nacknowledge a possible scenario of this sort does not mean that EXT\nand SK are incompatible (Warfield 1992). It shows merely that\nif EXT is true, self-knowledge is not necessarily within\nreach from the armchair.\n\nIn reply, some incompatibilists subversively suggest that switches\ndo occur on a regular basis (Ludlow 1995b; Butler 1997). In\nsection\n 1,\n we saw that one \u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenario might occur in the\nactual world: Recall the superficially indiscernible extensions of\n\u2018chicory\u2019 and \u2018endive\u2019, which are swapped\nbetween British and Standard American English. An American ex-patriot\nthus could be unwittingly fooled into denoting chicory when speaking\nor thinking about \u201cendive.\u201d Still, this seems like an\natypical case. But to the contrary, the potential for an undetected\nswitch might be as common as the potential for polysemy in the\nlanguage (Ludlow 1995b). Consider that between different philosophical\ncircles, the term \u2018pragmatism\u2019 denotes different yet\nsuperficially similar philosophical theses. So thanks to unnoticed\nswitches between subgroups, one might be fooled into saying or\nbelieving things about different kinds of pragmatism. Such variation\namong linguistic subgroups seems entirely commonplace. It is the\nprevalence of these switches, moreover, that makes them\nrelevant even if no actual switch occurs in a given instance.\n\nIn her defense, a compatibilist can observe that these cases are not\ncases of slow switching, and the usual view is that contents\ndo not change in a \u201cquick switch.\u201d (Though the\nindividuation of some cognitive processes may switch immediately; see\nClark & Chalmers 1998). Yet even if slow switches regularly occur,\nthis still does not show that EXT and SK are incompatible (Warfield\n1997). It might mean that EXT and SK are not jointly true in our\nworld. Nevertheless, they still might hold in some other possible\nworld; so no incompatibility strictly follows.\n\nRegardless, it may be troubling enough if an externalist cannot\nactually have armchair self-knowledge (Ludlow 1997). It is\nstandardly agreed, moreover, that the externalist should concede one\ntype of armchair self-knowledge\u2014namely, knowledge that is\ndiscriminatory between water contents and twin contents, a.k.a.\n\u201ccomparative knowledge\u201d of content (Falvey & Owens\n1994; see also Mendola 2008). But this may not be a huge concession,\nsince one may remain capable of knowing a self-verifying judgment that\n(W) from the armchair, absent any comparisons with twin contents.\nBesides, there is independent reason to reject such comparative\nknowledge anyway (see Owens 1990; 1992).\n\nA different issue is that if a compatibilist concedes SK when switches\nare relevant, she may be conceding too much (Goldberg 2006a). For\nthere is a persistent Cartesian intuition that armchair self-knowledge\nshould be unaffected by skeptical hypotheses about the external world.\nFollowing Meditation Two, even if an evil demon is deceiving\nme, it still seems I can know what I am currently thinking. Yet the\nslow switch experiment suggests that this Cartesian intuition is\nmistaken. For if a slow switch hypothesis is relevant, then even a\nrelevant alternatives epistemology demands that we discriminate water\nthoughts from twin water thoughts. Yet one is unable to do so from the\narmchair. So apparently, some deviant hypotheses about the external\nworld can undermine armchair knowledge of one\u2019s own\noccurrent thoughts, contra the Cartesian intuition. Something\nimportant about armchair self-knowledge may be lost.\n\nBut a relevant alternatives compatibilist might still rescue the\nCartesian intuition. First, note that in many slow switch arguments,\nthe issue is not whether Oscar knows that he thinks that\np from the armchair; rather, it is whether Oscar knows\nwhat he thinks. And unlike ascriptions of \u201cknowledge\nthat,\u201d ascriptions of \u201cknowledge what\u201d are\nappropriate only relative to one\u2019s goals or\npurposes in a context (Bo\u00ebr & Lycan 1986, Braun 2006,\nDeRose 2009, ch. 2,\n appendix).[22]\n Hence, whether it is apt to say \u201cOscar knows what he\nthinks\u201d partly depends on contextually salient goals or\npurposes. Granted, if Oscar\u2019s goal is to discriminate between a\ncontent and a twin content, then he cannot \u201cknow what\u201d he\nthinks from the armchair. However, it may be that for other\nanti-skeptical purposes, Oscar can indeed \u201cknow what\u201d\n(Parent 2015b, 2017, chs. 5 and 10). For instance, suppose the skeptic\nchallenges Oscar on whether he knows the truth of anything with\ncertainty. Then, if Oscar points to his self-verifying judgment (W)\n(\u201cI am thinking forthwith that water is wet\u201d) this could\ncount as meeting the challenge. It is a case where the truth of\nhis judgment is certain, even if its content is in question. So\nat least relative to that goal, Oscar may know what he thinks (Parent\n2015b, 2017, ch. 5).\n\nBefore closing this section, it is worth noting that compatibilists\nsometimes prefer not to insist on the irrelevance of slow switches,\nbut rather to contest whether their relevance undercuts armchair\nself-knowledge (Falvey & Owens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Butler 1997,\nMcLaughlin & Tye 1998a, Vahid 2003, Brown 2004, Morvarid 2015). A\nvariety of inferential principles might lead to the\nincompatibilist\u2019s conclusion from the relevance of slow\nswitching. As a more noteworthy example, the principle here might be\nsome kind of \u201ctruth tracking\u201d condition; cf. Nozick 1981\n(Falvey & Owens 1994). On this approach, the slow switch argument\nassumes that (W) does not express knowledge, since the subject S fails\nto track the truth in the following sense:\n\n\n\n(TC)\nS \u2019s justification for the belief that p is\nsuch that, if some relevant alternative were true instead, S\nwould still believe that p.  \n\n\n\nAccording to (TC), S fails to know since her justification\nwould not divert her judgment, in a relevant scenario where the\njudgment is false. However, if this is the principle operative in the\narguments, it seems they can be resisted (Falvey & Owens 1994).\nPlausibly, we do not satisfy (TC) when it comes to\nself-verifying judgments (see section\n 3.1).\n For if we consider a counterfactual where I have twin water thoughts\nin lieu of water thoughts, I cannot believe I have water\nthoughts. A self-attribution expressed as \u201cI am thinking that\nwater is wet\u201d would inevitably attribute a twin water thought\ninstead. My self-attribution \u201ctracks the truth\u201d perfectly\nin the counterfactual circumstances.\n3.3 Reply 3: Externalism about Memory\n\nLet us now focus our attention on the second version of the slow\nswitch argument, a.k.a. the memory argument, which is repeated here\nfor the reader\u2019s convenience. Where t2 is a\ntime after a slow switch, and t1 is a time before,\nthen:\n\nIf Oscar forgets nothing, then what Oscar knows at\nt1, Oscar knows at t2.\nOscar forgot nothing.\nOscar does not know at t2 that he thinks\np. \nSo, Oscar does not know at t1 that he thinks\np. [from (a)-(c)]\n\n\n(Slow-switching is a relevant alternative here, since it is assumed\nthat Oscar actually is slow-switched.) Now as one might expect, each\nof the premises have been challenged by various compatibilists.\nRegarding (a), some reject the suggestion that even if p was\nknown at t1, remembering p does not imply\nknowing it at t2 (Bernecker 2010, ch. 3).\nBut even if remembering implies knowing, there are other ways Oscar\ncan lose knowledge besides forgetting (Brueckner 1997a; Burge 1998, n.\n18). For instance, suppose Oscar knows he is driving through a\ncountryside with at least one barn, but some defeating\ncondition is introduced (e.g., he enters Barn Fa\u00e7ade\nCounty). Then, he may no longer know at t2\nthat there is a barn in his environs, even if he truly believes it.\nThat\u2019s because, although nothing has been forgotten, a defeating\ncondition exists at t2 that was absent at\nt1.\n\nAn incompatibilist might try to stipulate that Oscar meets all the\nconditions needed to know p on the basis of memory. However,\nthe compatibilist can reply that this is inconsistent with Oscar being\nslow switched (Brueckner 1997a). For a slow switch is a\ndefeating condition, akin to entering Barn Fa\u00e7ade County. In\nthat case, the incompatibilist\u2019s argument does not even get\nstarted.\n\nAlternatively, a compatibilist can attack the portrayal of memory\nsuggested by the argument. Here, one might claim that Oscar\u2019s\nmemory content is partly determined not by the Earthly\nenvironment in which the memory was formed. Rather, memory content is\nconditioned by the environment in which recall occurs (Ludlow\n1995a; 1996; 1999; Gibbons 1996; Tye 1998; Bernecker 1998). This means\nthat, even if knowledge of a water thought was initially stored in\nmemory, what is \u201crecalled\u201d on Twin Earth is a twin water\nthought. If so, then a slow switch causes a kind of memory failure,\nsince the knowledge initially stored in memory is not what is\nrecalled. (N.B., memories of second-order thoughts are the most\ndialectically relevant here, though the literature often uses\nfirst-order memories as examples, cf. Kraay 2002.)\n\nThis view of memory as \u201cshifty\u201d between different\nenvironments may be a consequence of EXT. Apparently, we can just as\neasily construct a Putnam-style thought experiment about Oscar\u2019s\nand Twin Oscar\u2019s memories (Ludlow 1995a; 1996; 1999;). Moreover,\nin the slow switch experiment, the presumption is that Oscar\u2019s\nwater thoughts generally change over to twin water\nthoughts\u2014including whatever (first- or second-order) thoughts\nare stored in memory.\n\nIt may be quite unintuitive to see memory in this way, and we shall\nattend to objections shortly. But it is worth noting that the view\nallows an externalist to resist the memory argument. A compatibilist\nmight first grant that Oscar does not forget strictly\nspeaking\u2014after all, we can assume no neurological impairment has\noccurred in him. Yet she can add that Oscar loses some memory content\nregardless, thanks to the slow switch. Even though Oscar does not\ntruly \u201cforget,\u201d he has still lost knowledge by a different\nroute; premise (a) of the memory argument is thus false. (The\n\u201cshifty\u201d view of memory has waned in recent years;\nBernecker 2004; 2010 relinquishes it in favor of something like\nBurge\u2019s 1998 view, described below. Ludlow 2004 trades it for a\nview where a memory is a temporally extended object, one which has\n\u201cstages\u201d that hosts different contents at different times.\nYet see Burge 1998 n. 2 for remarks against such a view.)\n\nThe externalist view of memory can come as a shock; however, it might\nenjoy some intuitive support (Tye 1998). For instance, suppose after\nthe switch that Oscar judges:\n\n\n\nW(\u2020)\nWater is the only thing I now drink; however, many years ago, I\ndrank water fortified by gin. \n\n\n\nSince (W\u2020) is judged after the slow switch, the initial use of\n\u2018water\u2019 refers to XYZ. But does the second use of\n\u2018water\u2019 refer to XYZ? It seems so, since (W\u2020) is\ncomparing his current imbibing habits with the past. Such a\ncomparison, of course, requires the liquid named in (W\u2020) to be\nconstant. And since the initial use of \u2018water\u2019 denotes\nXYZ, the second use of \u2018water\u2019 must also. The upshot is\nthat after the switch, the second clause in (W\u2020) expresses a\nmemory that has \u201cshifted\u201d from water content to a twin\nwater content, as predicted by the compatibilist.\n\nStill, the \u201cshifty\u201d view of memory remains controversial.\nConsider that if Oscar\u2019s memory content is calibrated to Twin\nEarth, so to speak, then some thoughts stored in memory will shift\nfrom being true to being false (Hofmann 1995 (Other\nInternet Resources), Brueckner 1997a, Nagasawa 2000). Oscar on Earth\nexpresses a veridical memory when he asserts:\n\n\n\n(W\u2021)\n As a child, I thought that water was positively\nscrumptious. \n\n\n\nHowever, after the slow switch, (W\u2021) self-attributes a twin\nwater thought\u2014and that thought is false. So what was a genuine\nmemory becomes displaced by a false memory.\n\nYet the objection may beg the question of how memory should function\n(Ludlow 1996). For the issue is precisely whether memory is supposed\nto preserve past contents across different environments. The\ncounter-suggestion is that memory instead offers information about\npast events, in terms pertinent to the present environment (Ludlow\n1996; 1999, Bernecker 1998). Ludlow (1999) provides an illustration:\n\u201cIf at t1 I believed it was possible to drown\nin water, memory will deliver a t2 belief that it is\npossible to drown in twater\u2014and good thing, too! Twater is no\nless \u2026dangerous than water\u201d (p. 167).\n\nAs a second worry, if Oscar\u2019s memory contents shift, has he\nreally forgotten nothing? A case can be made that the memory shifts\nindeed constitute forgetting (Brueckner 1997a). For even though memory\noffers up a similar substitute content, it seems clear that Oscar\nfails to recall something about water. Yet a failed attempt\nat recall just means that Oscar \u201cforgot.\u201d If so,\nthen it is premise (b) rather than (a) which is the culprit in the\nmemory argument. (Even so, there may remain a different sense in which\nOscar does not forget; Brueckner 1997a, n. 21; see also Kraay\n2002).\n\nNevertheless, it can be debated whether EXT entails the\n\u201cshifty\u201d theory of memory. When Burge first presented his\nTwin Earth experiment, he conceded that it does not show that\nall mental contents satisfy EXT (though it suggests that that\nis typically so) (1979, p. 92, passim). The contents of memory thus\nmight be an exception. And indeed, Burge (1993; 1998) endorses the\nview that memory should \u201cpreserve\u201d past thought contents.\nSo in a slow switch case, Burge holds that Oscar\u2019s properly\nfunctioning memory preserves an Earthian thought content, so that the\nvery same content is available later for recall.\n\nAccordingly, Burge rejects premise (c) of the memory argument: If\nOscar truly forgot nothing, then preservative memory means he knows at\nt2 what he knew at t1. Per Falvey\n& Owens (1994), Oscar\u2019s memory may not provide comparative\nknowledge of content, i.e., knowledge that enables armchair\ndiscriminations between water and twin water contents. But memory\nstill preserves knowledge of his thought at\nt1\u2014meaning that (c) is false. (The\nincompatibilist might rejoin that (c) is stipulative in the thought\nexperiment; but in that case, Burge sides with Brueckner 1997a in\nrejecting (b). Yet see Schroeter 2007 for a different issue in cases\nwhere Burge rejects (c).)\n\nWhether one accepts the \u201cshifty\u201d view of memory or not,\nthe debate is important to opening up different interpretations of the\nslow switch thought experiment. For it complicates what effect the\nslow switch has on Oscar\u2019s conceptual repertoire. The default\nview is that the slow switch causes Oscar\u2019s water concept to be\nwholly replaced by the twin water concept. But it may be\nunclear why a slow switch destroys Oscar\u2019s water\nconcept, even as he becomes acquainted with twin water (Boghossian\n1989; 1992a, Gibbons 1996, Burge 1998). More discussion of the issue\nis found in the supplementary document,\n Variations on Slow-Switching.\n\nAs a final thought, memory may ultimately be a red herring in\ndefending incompatibilism. For suppositions about memory seem\ninessential to the so-called \u201cmemory argument\u201d (Goldberg\n1997; 1999a; 2000a). After all, the key idea is that Oscar\u2019s\nself-attributions can be open to more than one interpretation: Suppose\nOscar recognizes slow switches as relevant alternatives, and he\nasserts \u2018I am thinking that water is scrumptious\u2019. Then,\nfor all Oscar can tell from the armchair, this might express a water\nthought or a twin water thought. Such \u201cunderdetermination\u201d\nin the interpretation is what Oscar cannot resolve without empirical\ninvestigation. So already there is a problem with armchair\nself-knowledge, absent any premises about memory.\n\nWhen spelled out, this \u201cmemory free\u201d slow switch argument\nassumes the following \u201cprinciple of knowing\nidentification:\u201d\n\n\n\n(PKI)\nIf a subject S recognizes that there is more than one\nrelevant interpretation of her assertions/beliefs\u2014and S\nhas nothing to decide between them\u2014then S lacks knowledge\nof the content of her assertion/belief. \n\n\n\nIf Oscar satisfies the antecedent of (PKI), it may seem that he is\nmissing only comparative knowledge of content\u2014i.e.,\nknowledge that allows armchair discrimination between a content and a\ntwin content (Brueckner 1999; cf. Falvey & Owens 1994). And we saw\nthat many compatibilists are already willing to surrender that type of\nknowledge. That\u2019s because Oscar\u2019s assertion \u201cI am\nthinking that water is scrumptious\u201d might still count as one\nkind of armchair self-knowledge (cf. section\n 3.1),\n even if it is not of the comparative type.\n\nHowever, (PKI) is applied to a specific kind of case, namely, where\n(i) there is more than one relevant interpretation, and (ii)\nthe subject recognizes this (Goldberg 1999a). There, even a\nrelevant alternatives epistemology requires Oscar to rule out the Twin\nEarth interpretation. Toward making this clearer, suppose that Oscar\nis informed of the switches at some later time t3.\nIn that sort of case, (i) and (ii) will be satisfied. Thus if he\nasserts \u201cI am thinking water is scrumptious,\u201d he will be\naware of relevant alternative interpretations that he cannot rule out\nfrom the armchair. Accordingly, even if his judgment is\nself-verifying, it is tendentious to say he knows from the\narmchair the content of his thought. (But for a rebuttal, see\nBrueckner 2000.)\n\nNotably, since the \u201cmemory free\u201d argument is restricted to\na special sort of case, it does not show that EXT and SK are entirely\nincompatible (Goldberg 1999a, p. 217; Goldberg 2000a). It\nstill suggests, however, that EXT precludes SK when certain skeptical\nhypotheses are entertained\u2014contrary to, e.g., the view in\nMeditation Two. \n3.4 Reply 4: The Argument is Self-Undermining\n\nAs should be clear, slow switch arguments can be seen as skeptical\narguments, where the skeptic raises the possibility that we\nare in Oscar\u2019s predicament. The externalist is thus asked to\nrule out deviant thought contents from the armchair. Moreover, since\nthe skeptic thinks she cannot do so, he claims that the externalist\nlacks armchair self-knowledge. But one sort of reply is that such\nskepticism is self-undermining (Ebbs 1996; 2001; 2005;\nBrueckner & Ebbs, 2012, ch. 12). The contention is that, assuming\nEXT, the skeptic cannot both deny SK and be justified in accepting the\npremises of his own argument. If so, skeptical slow switch arguments\nend up being incoherent.\n\nConsider that, since the skeptic wants to make a general point about\nknowledge, he should see slow switch possibilities as relevant to his\nown situation. The skeptic should not make an exception of himself,\nre: his skeptical thesis. Hence, when the skeptic levies the slow\nswitch argument, his premises force him to say of himself:\n\nIf I am on Twin Earth, then my saying \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that twin water is\nscrumptious.\nIf I am on Earth, then my saying \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that water is\nscrumptious.\n\n\nHis premises also require him to say that:\n\nI cannot know from the armchair which of the two thoughts is\nexpressed by \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 (given that switching\npossibilities are relevant).\n\n\nThe problem, however, is that (III) applies to \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 whenever the skeptic says it. Therefore, it applies\nto the utterance as it occurs in the consequent of (II). So\nif (III) is assumed, it follows that the skeptic does not know from\nthe armchair what thought is expressed by the consequent of (II),\nhence, by (II) itself. Yet if it is unknown what thought is expressed\nby (II), one can hardly be justified in accepting the\nthought. Hence, the skeptic cannot simultaneously hold (III) and be\njustified in accepting (II). (Ebbs also makes the analogous point\nabout the justification for (I), followed by similar objections and\nreplies. But for brevity\u2019s sake, we shall just consider\n(II).)\n\nThe skeptic might offer two different replies to the self-undermining\ncharge. The first is that, although the exact content of (II) may be\nunknown, the skeptic can still be justified in accepting (II)\n(Brueckner 1997b). For it seems that (II) can be shown true, no matter\nwhether the skeptic speaks English or Twin English. After all,\nregardless of what \u2018water\u2019 denotes, it is true to say\n\u201c \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that\nwater is scrumptious.\u201d Moreover, since the skeptic can recognize\nthis from the armchair, it seems he can be justified in accepting\n(II), even while assuming (III).\n\nBut to the contrary, it is possible to imagine \u201cweird\nworlds\u201d where (II) ends up false (Ebbs 2001). Consider a world\nmuch like this one, where H2O fills the lakes and rivers,\netc., and where \u2018water\u2019 refers to H2O. The\ndifference is that \u2018Earth\u2019 in this weird world does not\ndenote the planet that the skeptic currently occupies. Rather, it\ndenotes Twin Earth. In that case, when the skeptic states (II), the\nproposition expressed is that if he is on Twin Earth, then\nasserting \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought\nthat water (i.e. H2O) is scrumptious. (Remember\nthat \u2018water\u2019 in this scenario still denotes\nH2O.) Yet if that is what (II) expresses, then the skeptic\nsays something false. And so, since the skeptic apparently\ncannot exclude a weird world from the armchair, he cannot prove to\nhimself that (II) is true. So once more, the skeptic cannot\njustifiably adopt (II) while assuming (III).\n\nThe skeptic has a second line of reply to the self-undermining charge,\nwhich takes the form of a dilemma. Observe that \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 either expresses the content that the skeptic\nthinks it expresses, or not. If it does, then (II) is true\u2014and\nso, in conjunction with (I) and (III), the slow switch argument\nremains standing (Brueckner 2003). On the other hand, suppose that\n\u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 does not express the content that\nthe skeptic thinks it does. That just means he has a false belief\nabout the content of his first order thought. So he lacks knowledge of\nits content (since knowledge requires truth). And thus SK is false in\nthis case too. Consequently, on either horn of the dilemma, SK is\nthreatened (Brueckner 2003).\n\nNevertheless, the skeptic could not justifiably claim that (I)-(III)\nfigure into a sound argument (Ebbs 2005). For at this stage, the\nskeptic has conceded that (II) might not be true. Even so, it seems\nthat he can justifiably identify a different argument as a sound\nskeptical argument, namely, the dilemma offered above (Brueckner\n2007).\n\nSo has the skeptic escaped the self-undermining charge? There may\nstill be a question about the skeptic\u2019s adoption of (III). It\nmay seem that this is entirely justified, but why is that exactly?\nApparently, it is because the skeptic is justified in thinking that\n\u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 might express a different thought\nthan the one it actually expresses on Earth, viz., that water is wet.\nYet notice that this last bit assumes (II) (Brueckner & Ebbs,\n2012, ch. 12). But at this stage, the skeptic has already conceded\nthat (II) might be false, due to the possibility of a \u201cweird\nworld.\u201d So if (III) is justifiably believed only if (II)\nis\u2014and (II) was already surrendered\u2014then the skeptic must\nconcede the justification for (III). So a kind of self-undermining\nworry remains (Brueckner & Ebbs, ch. 12. For a response, see ch.\n13).\n3.5 Reply 5: Anti-Recognitionalism\n\nA more programmatic critique of slow switch arguments resists its\nassimilation of self-knowledge to perceptual knowledge. In particular,\nthe complaint is that slow switch arguments mistakenly assume that,\nfor Oscar to know what he is thinking, he must recognize what\nhe is thinking on the basis of some \u201cinward observation.\u201d\nSlow switch arguments then exploit the fact that what would be\n\u201cobserved\u201d is compatible with more than one thought\ncontent. However, for one kind of compatibilist, such\n\u201crecognitional\u201d models of self-knowledge are largely in\nerror. According to her, self-knowledge is unlike perceptual knowledge\nin that it is not normally the product of any kind of recognition\n(though she need not deny the existence of introspection altogether).\nSome even take slow switch arguments as positive evidence for the\nanti-recognitional view of self-knowledge (e.g., Moran 2001, p.\n15).\n\n\u201cAnti-recognitionalist\u201d compatibilism can be developed in\na number of ways. We have already seen some precedent in Burge\nvis-\u00e0-vis self-verifying judgments (section\n 3.1).\n For these judgments do not represent a \u201ccognitive\nachievement\u201d (in the words of Boghossian 1989); they are\nautomatically self-verifying, whether the subject invests any\nepistemic effort in them or not. Anti-recognitionalism has also arisen\nin W.\u2019s notion of \u201cdefault\u201d entitlement (from\nsection\n 2.3).\n For W., a subject does not need a tight philosophical argument to be\nentitled to her self-attributions; such entitlement is granted\nautomatically (unless there is special reason to withhold it).\n\nA variety of other anti-recognitionalist views exist. E.g., there is a\nneo-expressivist view which is gaining prominence (Bar-On & Long\n2001, Finkelstein 2003, Bar-On 2004; 2006; 2011; 2012a, b; 2103,\nParent 2017, ch. 8). There are also views which utilize\nagency-theoretic ideas to explain self-knowledge (Moran 2001, Heal\n2002, Bilgrami 2006, O\u2019Brien 2007, Coliva 2009). The interested\nreader is encouraged to visit the entry on\n self-knowledge\n for more.\n4. Other Issues with Externalist Self-Knowledge\n\nThere is a surprising number of further issues regarding EXT and SK.\nSome of these consist in lesser-known incompatibilism arguments. For\ninstance, there is a kind of \u201cinverted\u201d memory argument\nsuggesting that, if Burge\u2019s self-verifying judgments count as\nbona fide self-knowledge, then one\u2019s memory would be infallible\nin ways that it is obviously not (Goldberg 2000b). In addition, it is\nsometimes argued that EXT and SK preclude the standard analysis of\nepistemic possibility. (Ebbs 2003; 2011. But see McLaughlin 2004.)\n\nQuestions about compatibility have been extended to more than just\nknowledge of content. There is also a case to be made that EXT\nprecludes armchair knowledge of one\u2019s attitudes toward\nthose contents (Bernecker 1996, Gibbons 2001). Thus, even if it is\nknown that you are currently thinking that water is scrumptious, EXT\nmay preclude armchair knowledge that you believe this. For\nwhat counts as \u201cbelief\u201d might vary according to\none\u2019s linguistic community. In addition, new issues have arisen\nin light of externalism about qualia (as held by Lycan 1987;\n1996; 2001, Dretske 1995, Tye 1995). Briefly, if a quale is partly\nindividuated by the subject\u2019s environment, then it seems one\ncould not know that one had a quale of fire engine red unless\none antecedently knew the actual color of fire engines. But since the\nlatter is not knowable from the armchair, then it seems neither is the\nformer (Levine 2003, Ellis 2007).\n\nAnother set of issues concerns the metaphysics of mind. Some have\nwondered if EXT and SK absurdly allow armchair knowledge of\nFodor\u2019s (1975) Language of Thought Hypothesis (Davies 1998).\nOthers have suggested that the Language of Thought Hypothesis\nfalsifies SK, assuming EXT (Boghossian 1989, p. 6, Bonjour 1991).\nFurther, some writers have worried that if one can know what one\nthinks, then one can know that one thinks. If so, then the\nability to armchair know one\u2019s own thoughts would too easily\nrefute eliminativism about the mental (Dretske 2003a; 2003b; 2004,\nBernecker 1998; 2004b, Jacob 2004, Parent 2017, ch. 9; some papers in\nSmithies & Stoljar 2012 are also relevant).\n\nIn addition, there is a burgeoning literature on whether EXT is\ncompatible with epistemic internalism, a view where knowledge or\njustification supervenes on what\u2019s in the head (Pritchard &\nKallestrup 2004, Brown 2007, Gerken 2008; also cf. Chase 2001,\nBrueckner 2002. Goldberg 2007a is germane too). Many of the issues\nhere turn on what kind of self-knowledge is allowed by EXT, and in\nparticular, whether such knowledge is discriminating enough for\njustificatory purposes.\n\nThe debate on externalism and self-knowledge should continue to see\nnew developments. After all, as one writer observes:\n\nin the last two decades several developments in the philosophy of\nmind, the philosophy of language, and epistemology make it worthwhile\nto reconsider semantic externalism\u2019s implications for\nself-knowledge...[T]hese developments include various versions of 2D\nsemantics, the emerging popularity of so-called transparency views of\nself-knowledge...various doctrines pertaining to the semantics of\n\u2018knows\u2019 (such as contextualism, contrastivism, and\npragmatic encroachment), a renewed focus on anti-luminosity arguments\n(deriving from the work of Williamson (2000)), and developments in the\nepistemology of testimony as well as in the epistemology of\nunderstanding. (Goldberg 2015b, pp. 7-8)\n Moreover, the externalism/self-knowledge debate seems\nnot to be just a short-lived fancy; instead, it is arguably a\nsignificant plot-point in the history of Western philosophy. This is\nbecause:\n\n\n[T]he issue reflects an important clash between philosophical\nparadigms before and after the linguistic (or conceptual) turn. On one\nhand, it is characteristic of Cartesianism that we can know contents\nintrospectively, independently of knowing the external world. On the\nother hand, Frege taught us that content determines which external\nobjects we refer to (or in Carnap\u2019s terminology, that intension\ndetermines extension). And as Putnam (1975, p. 218ff.) argues,\nFrege\u2019s idea seems to result in externalism: If content\ndetermines reference, then a difference in reference between\nOscar and Twin Oscar shows a difference in content. That seems to\nhold, even if their narrow psychological states are the same. So if\nFrege\u2019s view leads to externalism, yet this precludes Cartesian\nknowledge of content, then apparently one of these\nparadigm-defining ideas has to go. Either Cartesians were wrong\nto say we can know contents just by introspection, or Fregeans were\nmisguided to think that content is what determines reference. (Parent\n2015b, p. 1346)\n The debate on whether EXT is compatible with SK thus\ndeserves our continued, serious attention.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"WorCit\">Works Cited</a>", "<a name=\"Col\">Collections</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"WorCit\">Works Cited</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anderson, C.
