    "main_text": "Preliminaries || A Framework for Discussion\n1.3 A Framework for Discussion\n\nIn approaching the topic of physicalism, one may distinguish what I\nwill call the interpretation question from the truth\nquestion. The interpretation question asks: \n\nWhat does it mean to say that everything is\nphysical?\n\n\nThe truth question asks: \n\nIs it true to say that everything is physical?\n\n\nThere is obviously a sense in which the second question presupposes an\nanswer to the first \u2014 you need to know what a statement means\nbefore you can ask whether it\u2019s true \u2014 and so we will\nbegin with the interpretation question. \n\nThe interpretation question itself divides into two sub-questions,\nwhich I will call the condition question and the\ncompleteness question. The condition question asks:\n\nWhat does it mean to for something to be\nphysical?\n\n\nThe condition question holds fixed the issue of what it means for\neverything to satisfy some condition, or to bear a relation to\nsomething that satisfies that condition, and asks instead\nwhat is the condition, being physical, that\neverything satisfies or bears a relation to. Notice that a parallel\nquestion could be asked of Thales: what is the condition, being\nwater, that according to Thales, everything satisfies?\nThe completeness question asks:\n\nWhat relation or relations must obtain between everything\nand the physical if physicalism is to be true?\n\n\nIn other words, the completeness question holds fixed the issue of\nwhat it means for something to be physical, and asks instead what\nrelation or relations obtain between everything and the physical if\nphysicalism is true; in what sense, in other words, is physicalism a\ncomplete thesis, a thesis that applies to everything\nwhatsoever. Notice again that a parallel question could be asked of\nThales: assuming we know what condition you have to satisfy to be\nwater, what does it mean to say that everything satisfies that\ncondition? \n\nOnce again there is a sense in which the second question here\npresupposes an answer to the first \u2014 you need to know what it is\nfor something to be physical in order to assess different proposals\nabout the relation everything bears to the physical.  Nevertheless, it\nis easier from a presentational point of view to discuss the\ncompleteness question first, leaving our answer to the condition\nquestion for the moment impressionistic, and that will be our\nprocedure. \n",
