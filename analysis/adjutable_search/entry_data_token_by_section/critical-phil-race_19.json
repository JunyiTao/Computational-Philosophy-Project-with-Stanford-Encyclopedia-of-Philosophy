Reconstituting the History of Philosophy\n\nThe racist beliefs of major figures in the traditional canon of modern\nphilosophy went unexplored until the second half of the\n20th century. Most historians of philosophy assumed that\ncanonical figures were simply men of their time, and that their racism\nwas devoid of philosophical interest and significance. Critical race\nphilosophers have opened up debate on these issues, such as how the\nracism of important philosophers such as Locke and Kant may require us\nto reassess standardly generous interpretations of their political and\nethical views (Zack 2017; Taylor et al. 2018; Mills 2017; Bernasconi\nand Mann 2005). They have also argued that bringing racism to the fore\nwill require changing the standard ways of doing the history of\nphilosophy.\n5.1. Doing Philosophy Differently\n\nFirst, a change in interpretive methods is in order, to\nchange the way in which we read canonical texts. Before we assume that\nthe racism of a given philosopher was typical of their day, we need to\nexplore the historical context and consider the written views of his or\nher contemporaries so that we can reasonably assess what any given\nphilosopher \u201ccould or should have known\u201d about, for\nexample, slavery (Bernasconi 2018, 3). In fact, as recent work has\nshown, throughout the modern period, slavery and colonialism were\nsubject to vigorous debates both by those inside and outside of\nimperial nations (Jeffers 2018; Valls 2005; Mehta 1999; Pitts 2006;\nDussel 2018, 2013; Mosley 2017). A thorough examination of the\nintellectual scene in which canonical philosophers were ensconced\nraises new questions about their views and assumptions (Bernasconi and\nMann 2005; Ward and Lott 2002). But such an examination requires that\nwe contextualize philosophical texts historically and socially before\nwe can justify our interpretations.\n\nSecond, the existing canon has too many omissions on crucial issues,\nespecially in regard to moral and political debate, to be taken as\nsufficient unto itself, given that such topics as slavery were\nextensively discussed and debated by other theorists in the same time\nperiod. The question of how to expand, if not reconstitute, the canon\nof modern philosophy has generated debate over what constitutes\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d writings as opposed to other sorts. It is\nimportant to remember that the canon of modern European philosophers\ndoes not include only professional philosophers working within\nuniversities: such professionals did not even appear until the\nbeginning of the 19th century. And the issue of what makes a\ntext count as a philosophical argument is of course subject to further\ndebate. Many of the already accepted canonical European texts come in\nthe form of letters, memoirs, fiction, dialogues, interpretations of\nsacred writings, and journalistic essays. Think of Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions, Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, Hume\u2019s Dialogues on\nNatural Religion, Pascal\u2019s Pensees, The Federalist Papers,\nNietzsche\u2019s Thus Spake Zarathustra, or Edmund Burke\u2019s\nReflections on the Revolution in France. Philosophers read texts in a\nphilosophical manner even when the text itself is not written in the\nform of a logically ordered argument.\n\nThere is original philosophical work in Africana, Latin American,\nindigenous and other traditions on metaphysics, morality, aesthetics\nand a whole host of philosophical issues that should become part of a\nrevised canon (Jeffers 2018; Henry 2000; Dussel 2013, 2018; Wiredu\n2004; Maffie 2013). The existence of original philosophical work in\nancient China and India is not as contested, yet these sources are also\nabsent representation in many so-called \u201ctop\u201d graduate\nprograms. Hence, there is an unjustificable Eurocentrism in the\nexisting canon\u2019s formation. The question of whether a given work\ncounts as philosophy cannot be decided upon by a priori\ncriteria created by a foreshortened canon. Therefore, we need to engage\nin both critical and reconstructive work on the question of canonicity\nitself.\n\nThe third point follows from the last. The traditional canon is not\nonly insufficient but problematic in ways that require new analyses and\ninterpretations. Without doing this critical work, taking concepts\ndeveloped within modern Western political philosophy as the foundation\nfrom which to build further theories of social justice may result in\nextending the life of racist ideas and failing in our anti-racist aims\n(Mills 1998; Gines 2014; Basevich 2020; Zack 2017; Taylor et al. 2018).\nConcepts that look to be neutral on issues of race may have racist\neffects even without racist motivations, such as the labor theory of\nvalue that excuses the appropriation of lands from indigenous groups,\nor concepts of equality that may be formulated in a way that assumes\nsameness, or ontologies of the self that obscure relationality and\ndependence on hierarchical social infrastructures. Thus, it is not\nmerely that the traditional canon needs to be augmented: it needs a\nthorough critical analysis that puts ideas and concepts in their\nhistorical context, explores their real-world applications, and then\nconsiders the reasons for their influence and popularity\nvis-\u00e0-vis other possible positions available at the time or,\nfrankly, even now.\n5.2 The Revelations of Contextualization\n\nTo reiterate, a historical and cultural contextualization of\nphilosophical ideas is perhaps the most crucial methodological reform\nneeded to change the way we understand the history of philosophy, and\ncontextualization is just as important in regard to present day work as\nfor philosophy written in the distant past. Contemporary approaches to\nphilosophical historiography have sometimes assumed that\ncontextualization is unnecessary, but this assumption, left\nunchallenged, can constrain critical analysis. When traditional\nhistorians of philosophy have begun to engage with questions of race,\nthe problematics have sometimes been foreshortened by decontextualized\nmethods of analysis. In this vein, Robert Bernasconi argues that\nnaturalistic tendencies in analytic philosophy have overemphasized the\nquestion of whether a given philosopher believed in race as a natural\nkind, resulting in a limited interpretive exploration (2012,\n552\u2013553).\n\nTake, for example, Du Bois\u2019s rich 1899 [1986a] text \u201cThe\nConservation of Races\u201d where he elaborates an account of African\nAmericans as a distinct historical people. Du Bois\u2019s account was\nreduced in a number of contemporary critical essays to the question of\nwhether he meant \u201cblack\u201d to refer to biology, in which\nbiological concepts themselves were understood as free of culture. But\nfrom phenomenology\u2019s point of view, the philosophical\nconceptualization of nature, and the current political uses made of\nnaturalist claims, are themselves cultural artifacts, historically and\nculturally contingent. Thus, when we read the history of modern\nEuropean philosophy, we need to be alive to the ways in which\n\u201cnature\u201d is being socially constructed and conscripted for\nphilosophical projects.\n\nCPR has worked to advance new interpretations of canonical\nphilosophers but has also, at the meta-level, contested standard\napproaches to interpretation. The interpretation of Kant, for example,\nhas had to contend with his extensive writings on anthropology and\ngeography in which he espoused unambiguously racist claims (Elden and\nMendieta 2011; Kant 1798 [2012]). Until recently this large body of writings\nwas considered irrelevant to the understanding of Kant\u2019s ethics\nor his cosmopolitanism on the grounds of disciplinary distinctions\nbetween philosophical work and other writings. But why ignore\nKant\u2019s writings about the nature of human difference if we are\ntrying to understand his actual views about the way peoples should\ninteract? Like feminist philosophers who developed an analysis of the\nsubtle ways in which some moral theories assumed a male embodiment,\nCritical Philosophers of Race have shown that doctrines of\nself-determination and universal reciprocity developed by modern\nEuropean philosophers were never intended to apply to all groups: the\nright to autonomy was based on certain capacities that legitimated the\nexclusion of children, the disabled, and usually women, but, also,\nnon-Europeans who were viewed as developmentally \u201cbehind\u201d.\nTaking some aspect of a philosophers\u2019 view and giving it the most\ngenerous reading possible distorts our understanding of modern\nphilosophy and its conceptual offerings (Basevich 2020;\nShorter-Bourhanou forthcoming; Kirkland 2018).\n\nMills argues that the only way to make sense of the evident\ncontradictions in modern European philosophy is to understand this body\nof work as distinguishing types of selves among the human race\n(Mills 1998). Because of these type-differences, anti-authoritarian\nreforms and demands for democracy were never meant to be extended to\nthe colonies. Sub-persons (women, slaves, the members of inferior\ncultures) did not merit suffrage, freedom, consultation, or\nself-determination. There was debate over whether these groups would\nremain forever inferior, less than human, or whether they might advance\n(Boxill 2005). But even those, like Rousseau, who believed in the\npossibility of uplift, assumed that \u201cpersons\u201d would be the\nones showing \u201csub-persons\u201d the way forward, and judging\ntheir progress.\n5.3 Questioning \u2018modernity\u2019 itself\n\nLucius Outlaw characterizes modern European philosophers as sharing\na commitment to a \u201cproject of modernity\u201d that aimed to put\nall human activity \u201cunder the aegis of\n\u2018reason\u2019\u201d (1996, 147; see also Kirkland 2018; Yancy\n2020; Dussel 1995, 2013, 2018; McCarthy 2009; Mehta 1999). Despite a\ndiversity of approaches and disagreements, the modern Europeans shared\na distinctive philosophy of history that defined progress as the\nexpansion of freedom and rationality. Social institutions and cultures\ncould then be compared and ranked in regard to this singular metric of\nuniversal development. It was useful for Empire, as Outlaw argues, to\nreframe the wide expanse of alterity among human beings and cultures as\ndevelopmental differences. The possibilities of a true pluralism was\nthen foreclosed by norms of modernity. The unfortunate result still\nwith us is that the impetus to study current social and cultural\ndifferences in thought, or the variety of philosophical writings, is\ndiminished on the grounds that these constitute inessential and\naccidental aspects of the human condition, irrelevant to the\nformulation or discernment of freedom and reason. Eurocentrism in\nphilosophical curricula is then no accident, Outlaw concludes, nor is\nit viewed as a deficiency since the modern European canon is assumed to\nprovide sufficient elaboration and debate over the universal principles\nof freedom and reason.\n\nThus, this project of modernity gave birth to a\n\u201cfalse universalism that blocks the appreciation of racial and\nethnic differences\u2026and contributed to deceptions that masked\nvarious forms of domination that were\nrationalized\u2026\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 150). Critical social theory\nworthy of the name needs to embrace a pluralism of philosophical\nprojects, concepts, and frameworks that have arisen from differently\nsituated thinkers from diverse regions or group experiences who are\naddressing, at least in some cases, dissimilar puzzles and challenges.\nA pluralist approach to philosophical projects can then engage in\ncritical dialogue across these differences. The point of noting real\nphilosophical alterities for Outlaw is not to counsel empty tolerance\nbut to avoid presumptive judgments based on putative universals crafted\nby only one side.\n\nQuestioning European projects of modernity has been productively\ndisruptive of the staid problematics that have dominated numerous\nsub-fields, from political philosophy to aesthetics to epistemology\n(Narayan and Harding 2000; Dotson 2012, 2014; Taylor 2016). Previously,\nthe focal points that dominated these sub-fields, such as skepticism,\nideal forms of justice, the universal nature of aesthetic value, and so\non, came exclusively from modern European or ancient Greek\nphilosophers. The recent critical work is challenging the hegemony of\nthe traditional canon in setting out the agenda for philosophy. To be\nsure, previous movements in philosophy have also made progress in\nexpanding the problematics, such as pragmatism, post-structuralism,\nsocial epistemology, feminist philosophy, and others. New questions\nhave made it to the table, and old questions have had new\nformulations.\n\nParticularly important has been the transformation of political\nproblematics, reaching well beyond the debates over liberalism,\nconservatism, and Marxism (McGary 1999; Cohen 1999, Gooding-Williams\n2009; Shelby 2018; Lugones 2003; Corlett 2003 and 2010; Darby and Rury\n2018; Hanchard 2018). The move from ideal to non-ideal approaches has\nplayed a particularly productive role in opening up the field of\npolitical philosophy to engage with racial injustice and inequality\n(Mills 2005). Non-ideal approaches have cast new light on ideal\nconceptions of normative, optimally functional behavior. Shelby,\nGooding-Williams, and Cathy Cohen have all, in different ways, turned\nto the project of investigating \u201chow [so-called] deviant\npractices can be transformed into political challenges to the power\nthat the state exercises over the ghetto poor through the promotion and\nenforcement of [illegitimate] norms\u201d (Gooding-Williams 2009,\n251). Gooding-Williams indicts Du Bois\u2019s adoption of mainstream\nnorms of respectability in his account of the Philadelphia ghettos and\nsuggests that we look instead to Frederick Douglas as the better\npolitical philosopher for emancipation (see also James 1997). The\nproject of civilizing Black people was a strategy that would only\nensure their subjection. Douglas envisioned a subaltern black\ncounterpublic that might have its own distinct ideas about the optimal\nnorms of communal life and what constituted civilized behavior (see\nDawson 2011).\n\nThese new problematics in political philosophy often draw from\nneglected historical sources, including Douglass and Du Bois as well as\nMartin Delaney, Anna Julia Cooper, Simon Bolivar, Kwame Nkrumah,\nAmilcar Cabral, Walter Rodney, Haya de la Torre, Jose Mart\u00ed,\nAim\u00e9 and Suzanne Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, and many others.\nRelated to these new non-European sources has been an altered map of\nthe European sources of greatest interest, to include more of\nMontaigne, Las Casas, Condorcet, Rousseau, Gramsci, Marcuse, and\nothers.\n\nTo be sure, many Critical Philosophers of Race decline to follow\nOutlaw in believing that there is a \u2018black counterpublic\u2019\nthat represents a racially cohesive formation. To the extent there is\ncohesion, it is based more on opposition to white supremacy, some\nargue, than an expression of shared sensibilities and orientations. And\nso the debate ensues. As this entry has shown, strong differences\nabound among CPR scholars over the history of Negritude and\nmetissage, the implications of intersectionality, the meaning\nand future of racial concepts, and the weighty role of capitalism as a\ncausal factor. A newly interpreted, reorganized and expanded history of\nphilosophy is reformulating our central questions in many sub-fields,\ninvigorating new lines of argumentation, more relevant for current\nchallenges.",
