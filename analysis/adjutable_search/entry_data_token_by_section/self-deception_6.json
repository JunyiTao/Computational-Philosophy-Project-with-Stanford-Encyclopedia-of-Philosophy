    "main_text": "Revisionist Approaches || Revision of Belief: Adjustment of Attitude or Content\n3.2 Revision of Belief: Adjustment of Attitude or Content\n\nApproaches that focus on revising the notion that self-deception\nrequires holding that p and ~p, the dual-belief\nrequirement implied by traditional intentionalism, either introduce\nsome \u201cdoxastic proxy\u201d (Baghramian and Nicholson 2013) to\nreplace one or both beliefs or alter the content of the\nself-deceiver\u2019s belief in a way that preserves tension without\ninvolving outright conflict. These approaches resolve the doxastic\nparadox either by denying that self-deceivers hold the unwelcome but\nwarranted belief ~p (Talbott 1995; Barnes 1997;\nBurm\u00fadez 2000; Mele 2001), denying they hold the welcome but\nunwarranted belief p (Audi 1982, 1988; Funkhouser 2005;\nGendler 2007; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Jordan 2020, 2022), denying they\nhold either belief p or ~p (Archer 2013; Porcher\n2012), or contending they have shifting degrees of belief regarding\np (Chan and Rowbottom 2019). Lauria et al. (2016)\nargue for an integrative approach that accommodates all these products\nof self-deception on the basis of empirical research on the role\naffect plays in assessments of evidence.\n\nDenying the Unwelcome Belief: Both intentionalists and\nnon-intentionalists may question whether self-deceivers must hold the\nunwelcome but warranted belief. For intentionalists, what\u2019s\nnecessary is some intention to form the target belief p, and\nthis is compatible with having no views at all regarding p\n(lacking any evidence for or against p) or believing p is merely\npossible (possessing evidence too weak to warrant belief that\np or ~p) (Berm\u00fadez 2000). Moreover, rejecting\nthis requirement relieves the pressure to introduce deep divisions\n(Talbott 1995). For non-intentionalists, the focus is on how the false\nbelief is acquired, not whether a person believes it\u2019s\ncontradictory. For them, it suffices that self-deceivers acquire the\nunwarranted false belief that p in a motivated way (Mele\n2001). The selectivity and tension typical of self-deception can be\nexplained without attributing ~p since nearby proxies like\nsuspicion that ~p can do the same work. Citing Rorty\u2019s\n(1988) case of Dr. Androvna, a cancer specialist who believes she does\nnot have cancer but who draws up a detailed will and writes\nuncharacteristically effusive letters suggesting her impending\ndeparture, Mele (2009) points out that Androvna\u2019s behavior might\neasily be explained by her holding that there\u2019s a significant\nchance I have cancer. And this belief is compatible with\nAndrovna\u2019s self-deceptive belief that she does not, in fact,\nhave cancer.\n\nDenying the Welcome Belief: Another strand of revision of\nbelief approaches focuses on the welcome belief that p,\nproposing alternatives to this belief that function in ways that\nexplain what self-deceivers typically say and do. Self-deceivers\ndisplay ambiguous behavior that not only falls short of what one would\nexpect from a person who believes that p but seems to justify\nthe attribution of the belief that ~p. For instance,\nAndrovna\u2019s letter-writing and will-preparation might be taken as\nreasons for attributing to her the belief that she won\u2019t\nrecover, despite her verbal assertions to the contrary. To explain the\nspecial pattern of behavior displayed by self-deceivers, some of these\ntheorists propose proxies for full belief, such as sincere avowal\n(Audi 1982, 1988); pretense (Gendler 2007); an intermediate state\nbetween belief and desire, or \u2018besire\u2019 (Egan 2009); some\nother less-than-full belief state akin to imaginations or fantasies\n(Lazar 1999); or simply \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 (Jordan 2020,\n2022). Such states may guide and motivate action in many, though not\nall, circumstances while being relatively less sensitive to evidence\nthan beliefs.\n\nOthers substitute a higher-order belief to explain the behavior of\nself-deceivers as another kind of proxy for the belief that p\n(Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013). On such approaches,\nself-deceivers don\u2019t believe p; they believe that they\nbelieve that p, and this false second-order\nbelief\u2014\u201cI think that I believe that\np\u201d\u2014underlies and underwrites their sincere avowal\nthat p as well as their ability to entertain p as\ntrue. Self-deception, then, is a kind of failure of self-knowledge, a\nmisapprehension or misattribution of one\u2019s own beliefs. By\nshifting the content of the self-deceptive belief to the second-order,\nthis approach avoids the doxastic paradox and explains the\ncharacteristic \u2018tension\u2019 or \u2018conflict\u2019\nattributed to self-deceivers in terms of the disharmony between the\nfirst-order and second-order beliefs, the latter explaining their\navowed belief and the former their behavior that goes against that\navowed belief (Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013).\n\nDenying both the Welcome Belief and the Unwelcome\nBelief: Given the variety of proxies that have been\noffered for both the welcome and the unwelcome belief, it should not\nbe surprising that some argue that self-deception can be explained\nwithout attributing either belief to self-deceivers, a position Archer\n(2013) refers to as \u2018nondoxasticism.\u2019 Porcher (2012)\nrecommends against attributing beliefs to self-deceivers on the\ngrounds that what they believe is indeterminate since they are, as\nSchwitzgebel (2001, 2010) contends,\n\u201cin-between-believing,\u201d neither fully believing that\np nor fully not believing that p. For Porcher\n(2012), self-deceivers show the limits of the folk psychological\nconcepts of belief and suggest the need to develop a dispositional\naccount of self-deception that focuses on the ways that\nself-deceivers\u2019 dispositions deviate from those of stereotypical\nfull belief. Funkhouser (2009) also points to the limits of folk\npsychological concepts and suggests that in cases involving deep\nconflict between behavior and avowal, \u201cthe self-deceived produce\na confused belief-like condition so that it is genuinely indeterminate\nwhat they believe regarding p.\u201d Archer (2013), however,\nrejects the claim that the belief is indeterminate or that folk\npsychological concepts are inadequate, arguing that folk psychology\noffers a wide variety of non-doxastic attitudes such as\n\u2018hope,\u2019 \u2018suspicion,\u2019 \u2018anxiety,\u2019\nand the like that are more than sufficient to explain paradigm cases\nof self-deception without adverting to belief.\n\nShifting Degrees of Belief: Some contend that\nattention to shifting degrees of belief offers a better explanation of\nparadigm cases of self-deception\u2014especially the behavioral\ntensions\u2014and avoids the static paradox (Chan and Rowbottom\n2019). In their view, many so-called non-doxastic attitudes entail\nsome degree of belief regarding p. Shifts in these beliefs\nare triggered by and track shifts in information and non-doxastic\npropositional attitudes such as desire, fear, anxiety, and anger. For\ninstance, a husband might initially have a high degree of belief in\nhis spouse\u2019s fidelity that plummets when he encounters\nthreatening evidence. His low confidence reveals afresh how much he\nwants her fidelity and prompts him to despair. These non-doxastic\nattitudes trigger another shift by focusing his attention on evidence\nof his spouse\u2019s love and fidelity, leaving him with a higher\ndegree of confidence than his available evidence warrants. On this\nshifting belief account, the self-deceiver holds both p and\n~p at varying levels of confidence that are always greater\nthan zero (example due to Chan and Rowbottom 2019).\n\nWhile revision of belief approaches suggest a number of\nnon-paradoxical ways of thinking about self-deception, some worry that\nthose approaches denying that self-deceivers hold the welcome but\nunwarranted belief that p eliminate what is central to the\nnotion of self-deception, namely, deception (see, e.g., Lynch\n2012; Mele 2010). Whatever the verdict, these revision of belief\napproaches suggest that our way of characterizing belief may not be\nfine-grained enough to account for the subtle attitudes or\nmeta-attitudes that self-deceivers bear on the proposition in\nquestion. Taken together, these approaches make it clear that the\nquestion regarding what self-deceivers believe is by no means\nresolved.\n",
