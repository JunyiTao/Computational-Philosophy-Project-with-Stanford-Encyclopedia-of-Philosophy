    "main_text": "\n\nIn the accounts we give of one another, claims about our\nabilities appear to be indispensable. Some abilities are so\nwidespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the\nability to walk, or to write one\u2019s name, or to tell a hawk from a\nhandsaw. Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the\nability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or\nto tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe\nsuch abilities to one another we have the impression that we are\nmaking claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least\nsometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards\ngiving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at\nleast at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or\noutright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to\nsay what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the\nappearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 insofar as it gives an account, not of\nthis or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally.\n\nThis article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,\nstates a framework for discussing philosophical theories of ability.\nSection 1 will say more about the distinction between abilities and\nother powers of agents and objects. Section 2 will make some formal\ndistinctions that are helpful for framing any theory of ability. The\nsecond part, Sections 3\u20135, surveys theories of ability that have\nbeen defended in the philosophical literature. Section\u00a03 concerns\nthe most prominent kind of theory, on which abilities are to be\nunderstood in terms of a hypothetical relating an agent\u2019s actions\nto her volitions. Section 4 concerns theories that are not\nhypothetical in this way, but that nonetheless retain the basic\nreductive orientation of hypothetical theories. Section 5 then\ndiscusses various alternative theories of ability that have been\nproposed in the recent literature. The third part, Section 6, turns to\nthe relationship between a theory of ability and the free will\ndebates. Such debates often involve claims about agents\u2019\nabilities, and many have hoped that getting clearer on abilities\nthemselves could resolve, or at least shed light on, such debates. The\naim of this last section will be to assess whether these hopes are\nreasonable ones.\n",
