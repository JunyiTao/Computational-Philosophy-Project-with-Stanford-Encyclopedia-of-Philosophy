    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Data Protection and Security\n1.3 Data Protection and Security\n\nThe moral significance attached to medical privacy is reflected in\ndata protection and security laws adopted by local and national\nauthorities around the world. The point of these laws is to regulate\nthe collection, quality, storing, sharing and retention of health\ndata, including the electronic health record (EHR) (CDT 2009, in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Health privacy statutes limit disclosure in the absence of informed\nconsent; but typical statutes recognize numerous exceptions for\nroutine uses, research, public health reporting, and legal process and\nlaw enforcement. The policy consensus seems to be that, while medical\nprivacy is important, patients\u2019 medical information may be\ndisclosed to third-parties for socially important purposes unrelated\nto their own care. Electronically stored and produced medical\ninformation is by its very nature mobile. Those with access can\ntransmit EHR data across town or across state and national borders.\nPatients today have unprecedented access to their own health\ninformation. Patients may transmit medical data over email, entrust it\nto third party cloud data storage providers, or collect health data\nvia apps and wearable devices with little attention to third part\naccess and use.\n\nSome jurisdictions have special rules for management of certain health\ninformation. Data regarding HIV/AIDS, mental health and genetics are\nafforded special treatment in U.S. law, for example. Philosophers\nponder whether particular conditions merit such exceptionalism. The\nargument for HIV/AIDS exceptionalism recalls the early days of the\nglobal epidemic when knowledge of the illness was poor, treatment was\nineffective, and social stigma attached to affliction. The argument\nfor mental health exceptionalism is that patients do and must\n\u201cbare their souls\u201d to mental and behavioral health\nproviders, making disclosures socially costly (Radden 2004). A U.S.\nfederal statute prohibits basing employment or health insurance\ndecisions on information about a person\u2019s DNA or genetic\npredispositions (GINA 2008). The leading argument for genetic data\nexceptionalism appears to be that genetic data conveys uniquely\ndetailed information about a person and her biological family,\ninformation a person might have a right to know or a right not to know\n(Chadwick et al. 2014). Some genetic information can foretell a\nperson\u2019s health future (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).\n\nThe use of electronic technology has been described as a boon for\nhealth care delivery and administration for decades (Burton 2004;\nNational Research Council 1991). Yet heightened concerns for privacy\nfollowed increased portability of health data mandated by law (HIPAA\n1996) and third-party (\u201ccloud\u201d) data storage. The\nobligation to protect medical data held by the state or private\ncompanies has taken on a new urgency as more and more health data is\nbeing transmitted and stored electronically. It has been argued that\ninformation managers owe it to the public to take stringent measures\nto prevent data breaches and to appropriately respond and remediate\nwhen a breach occurs. A data breach can result from the theft of a\nlaptop; fraudulent or accidental access to data; sabotage by dishonest\nor disgruntled employees; or the loss of data storage devices. Major\nhospitals, health agencies and insurers have experienced highly\npublicized data breaches affecting millions of consumers whose names,\naddresses, health identification numbers and other data were\ncompromised (Seh et al. 2020). A philosophical question raised by data\nbreaches is how to define and morally repair harm. Medical identity\ntheft and public disclosure of private facts are generally regarded as\n\u201charms\u201d (Biegelman 2009). But it has been argued that\nnegligently causing increased risks of identity theft and public\ndisclosure of private facts are harms, too. If risk amplification is\nharm, though, it is unclear what should count as fair compensation or\nmoral repair. \n",
