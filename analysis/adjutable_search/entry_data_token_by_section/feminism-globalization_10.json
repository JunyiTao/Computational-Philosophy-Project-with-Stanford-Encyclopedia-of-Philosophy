Conclusion\n\nOn the whole, globalization presents a number of challenges to\nfeminist political philosophers who seek to develop conceptions of\njustice and responsibility capable of responding to the lived\nrealities of both men and women. As globalization will most certainly\ncontinue, these challenges are likely to increase in the coming\ndecades. As we have outlined above, feminist political philosophers\nhave already made great strides towards understanding this complex\nphenomenon. Yet the challenge of how to make globalization fairer\nremains for feminist philosophers, as well as all others who strive\nfor equality and justice.\n",
