Cohen termed the \u201cNewtonian style\u201d. Its constitutive\nfeature is the mathematization of nature, i.e., \u201cdealing\nmathematically with the realities of the external world\u201d. This\nmeant much more than deriving numerical results from experiments, or a\nfocus on measurement, or a commitment to a means of exposition that\nproceeded from definitions and axioms. Instead, it meant taking\nmathematics as the model of reality: constructing \u201cthe\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation\u201d and then to\nadvance from this idealized case by the addition of further conditions\ntoward more accurate mathematical analogues of actual situations\n(Cohen 1980: 51, 151, see also Smith 2002; Smeenk & Schliesser\n2013). There are no traces of this approach in Hume, so if one takes\nthe Principia\u2019s \u201cNewtonian style\u201d as the\nessence of Newton\u2019s method, then one should also conclude that\nHume\u2019s experimental method is not Newtonian. (For a contrasting\nview see de Pierris 2015 who credits Hume with a\nPrincipia-style Newtonian inductive methodology, and for a\ncritique of her views see Landy 2017.)\n\nAs McGuire (1970b: 182) points out \u201cNewton did not see any\ndichotomy in method between that used in the Principia and\nthat found in the Opticks\u201d. But even if he considered\nhis methodology fundamentally the same in both works, and he treated\nmathematical and experimental analyses as contributing to inquiry in\nthe same manner, this was perceived differently by subsequent\ngenerations. In Query 31 Newton himself introduces two different ways\nof analysis that \u201cmay proceed from compounds to ingredients, and\nfrom motions to the forces producing them\u201d (Opticks, Query 31 added in 1718, Newton 2004:\n139; for a discussion\nsee e.g. Ducheyne 2012; Demeter 2016): the first way allows for a\nqualitative analysis that does not require the centrality of a\nmathematical framework of analysis. The crucial element is indeed\ncommon to their methodology, namely the idea of causal\nanalysis\u2014this is the core of Newtonian analysis, and these\nare the terms in which Colin Maclaurin (1775: 8\u201310) introduces\nthe Newtonian method to his contemporaries. Nevertheless, it is\nimmediately clear from this passage that an analysis \u201cfrom\ncompounds to ingredients\u201d must proceed differently and find\ndifferent causes from an analysis \u201cfrom motions to the forces\nproducing them\u201d: they will be different with respect to both the\nmethod of analysis, and the nature of the causes\nthat can be so analysed.\n\nFrom the angle of Newton\u2019s Preface to the first edition of the Principia, \n\n\nthe basic problem of philosophy seems to be to discover the forces of\nnature from the phenomena of motions and then to demonstrate the other\nphenomena from these forces. (Newton 2004: 41) \n\n\nSo its method is focused on analysing the causes of motions\nin terms of forces, a quantifiable natural kind that is\ndefined in terms of other quantities. So defined, the problem cries\nout for a mathematical apparatus, and so it fosters what I.B. Cohen\ntermed \u201cthe Newtonian style\u201d in philosophy: taking\nmathematics as the model of reality, constructing \u201cthe\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation\u201d, and then\nproducing from this idealized case by the addition of further\nconditions more and more accurate mathematical analogues of actual\nsituations (Cohen 1980: 51, 151). Through this series of\n\u201csuccessive approximations\u201d, Newton\u2019s axioms or laws\nof motion function as \u201cinference tickets\u201d that allow for\ndrawing conclusions from motions to forces and vice versa,\nand also from macrophysical to microphysical forces composing them\n(Smith 2002: 143, 155\u2013159; Smeenk & Schliesser 2013).\n\nThe analysis of compounds to ingredients, followed in the\nOpticks, looks for parts, components, constituents etc., and\naccompanies the mathematical methods of analysis where they prove to\nbe inadequate in themselves. The qualitative component of analysis is\nintended to reveal the composition of optical and, especially\nin the Queries, chemical phenomena. The paradigmatic cases are, of\ncourse, Newton\u2019s prism experiments that revealed the composition\nof white light. In the first two books of the Opticks Newton\nhimself uses the method of analysis of compounds into ingredients\n\u201cto discover and prove the original differences of rays of\nlight\u201d (Query 31, Newton 2004: 140), that is to discover\nqualitative differences that persist due to the lack of their analysis\nin the \u201cNewtonian style\u201d. Most notable among them, as the\nexperimentum crucis had revealed, are colours that\n\n\n\nare not Qualifications of Light, derived from Refractions, or\nReflections of natural Bodies (as \u2019tis generally believed,) but\nOriginal and connate properties, which in divers\nRays are divers. (Newton 1671/72: 3081; for discussion and context see\nDucheyne 2012: 190\u2013192)\n\n\nIn this vein, the Opticks provides a more appropriate setting\nfor understanding the character of Hume\u2019s experimentalism than\nthe context of the Principia. As Colin Maclaurin put it in\nhis 1748 account of Newton\u2019s discoveries: while the\nPrincipia inquires into forces acting between bodies in great\ndistance, the Opticks explores the \u201chidden parts of\nnature\u201d, which are not so easily \u201csubjected to\nanalysis\u201d because of the subtlety and minuteness of the\nagents (Maclaurin 1775: 21). The principles of human nature that Hume\nendeavours to explore also belong to the hidden parts of nature that\ncan be explored by a method of qualitative analysis and\nsynthesis similar to the one advertised in Query 31. (Landy 2017\noffers a consonant reconstruction of Hume\u2019s philosophy of\nscience as aiming at the exploration of hidden processes of the\nmind.)\n\nThe Treatise begins with setting up a \u201cscheme of\nfundamental \u2018elements\u2019\u201d for analyzing human\nphenomena in terms of ideas and impressions. Humean analysis begins\nwith phenomena from the historical and everyday observation of human\nbehavior, and the analysis proceeds by \u201cexperiments \u2026\njudiciously collected and compar\u2019d\u201d (THN I.10), in order\nto arrive at analogies among various instances \u201cfrom the\nobservation of several parallel instances\u201d (EHU 8.13). The\nproducts of comparative analysis so conducted are the principles of\nvarious faculties, like perception, imagination, reason, etc., whose\ninteraction results in ideas and impressions causing behaviour, but\ntheir contribution can hardly be measured and the principles of their\ninteraction can hardly be quantified\u2014not even in principle, so\nthey cannot be mathematized either (see also\n section 4.6\n above). Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them (Demeter 2016).\n\nThe methodological core thus consists in collecting relevant\nphenomena, finding analogies between them, and ascribing those\nanalogies to similar causes, thereby reducing a variety of phenomena\nto regular principles underlying them (THN App.3, Abs.1, EHU\n4.12)\u2014while knowing that our knowledge cannot transcend what we\ncan infer on an analogical basis from the effects themselves (THN\nI.8). Just as comparing rays of light reveals their determinable\nproperties which, once determined, can be used in constructing\nexplanations, the comparison of instances of human behavior reveals\nthe principles of human nature with increasing generality and\nexactness. Salient human phenomena are collected from history and\nobservation, then compared; if analogies and similarities are found,\nthey are ascribed to some principle of human nature that are also\ncompared, grouped and resolved into more general ones (see also\nSection 4.8 below). This process results in determinable properties of\nhuman nature like the faculties of reason, sympathy, moral sense etc.;\ndetermining how these properties are actually instantiated in\ndifferent social, historical, individual, etc. circumstances provides\nthe explanatory raw material for singular phenomena (EHU 8.7, 8.9).\nThus we reach the principles of human nature that are the proper aim\nof inquiry in the science of man. These principles can be used, at the\nstage of synthesis, to explain why our impressions and ideas follow\none another in the order they do.\n\nThe outcome of these procedures is the refinement of the theory of\nhuman nature. While exploring exceptions and eliminating superfluous\nconditions it turns out, for example, that some principles of human\nnature are universal, some others are particular (THN 1.4.4.1). Some\nprinciples of imagination are then constitutive of human nature, but\nsome others are just contingent on culture or history, or even\nidiosyncratic, and can lead to local superstitions or philosophical\nchimeras, like presupposing \u201csubstance\u201d as the bearer of\nproperties in scholastic metaphysics. The universal principles provide\nthe fundamental framework of determinable human properties that are\nactually determined by social and historical circumstances. This\nexplains why certain virtues, like courage, are evaluated differently\nin different historical periods (EPM 7.11\u201314), and also why a\ncreature without sympathy, however contingent its degree and direction\nmay be, would count as a \u201cmonster\u201d and not a\n\u201cman\u201d (EPM 6.1\u20132). Sympathy is a universal principle\nof human nature, but the principles of the degree and direction of its\nsensitivity are determined by the conditions within which it is\ndeveloped and refined through social interaction (EPM 5.41\u201342).\nThis amounts to saying that Hume\u2019s account of human nature has\nboth universalistic and contextualist elements, and this is the\noutcome of his experimental methodology: it is through a series of\nsuccessive approximation through a comparative study of changing\ncircumstances that the universal and contingent principles of human\nnature can be distinguished.\n\nAnalysis and synthesis so understood constitutes the core of\n\u201cthe experimental method of reasoning\u201d that distinguishes\nHume\u2019s enterprise from the alternative approach that Newton\n(2004: 121) had termed \u201chypothetical philosophy\u201d. Hume is\naware of this distinction and explicitly sides with the\nexperimentalist camp. His methodological pronouncements and\ncommitments situate him in the context of \u201cmethodological\nNewtonianism\u201d characteristic to Scottish moral and natural\nphilosophers, who \u201cdealt with aspects of philosophy for which\nNewton had not laid down the specific postulates upon which future\ntheories were to be built\u201d (Donovan 1975: 29, see also Demeter\n2016).\n",
