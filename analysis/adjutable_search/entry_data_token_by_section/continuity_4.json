The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Nineteenth Century\n\nThe rapid development of mathematical analysis in the eighteenth\ncentury had not concealed the fact that its underlying concepts not\nonly lacked rigorous definition, but were even (e.g., in the case of\ndifferentials and infinitesimals) of doubtful logical character. The\nlack of precision in the notion of continuous function\u2014still\nvaguely understood as one which could be represented by a formula and\nwhose associated curve could be smoothly drawn\u2014had led to doubts\nconcerning the validity of a number of procedures in which that\nconcept figured. For example it was often assumed that every\ncontinuous function could be expressed as an infinite series by means\nof Taylor\u2019s theorem. Early in the nineteenth century this and\nother assumptions began to be questioned, thereby initiating an\ninquiry into what was meant by a function in general and by a\ncontinuous function in particular.\n\nA pioneer in the matter of clarifying the concept of continuous\nfunction was the Bohemian priest, philosopher and mathematician\nBernard Bolzano (1781\u20131848). In his Rein analytischer\nBeweis of 1817 he defines a (real-valued) function \\(f\\) to be\ncontinuous at a point \\(x\\) if the difference \\(f(x + \\omega) - f(x)\\)\ncan be made smaller than any preselected quantity once we are\npermitted to take \\(w\\) as small as we please. This is essentially the\nsame as the definition of continuity in terms of the limit concept\ngiven a little later by Cauchy. Bolzano also formulated a definition\nof the derivative of a function free of the notion of infinitesimal\n(Bolzano 1851 [1950]). Bolzano repudiated Euler\u2019s treatment of\ndifferentials as formal zeros in expressions such as \\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\),\nsuggesting instead that in determining the derivative of a function,\nincrements \\(\\Delta x,\\) \\(\\Delta y,\\) \u2026, be finally\nset to zero. For Bolzano differentials have the status of\nideal elements, purely formal entities such as points and\nlines at infinity in projective geometry, or (as Bolzano himself\nmentions) imaginary numbers, whose use will never lead to false\nassertions concerning real quantities.\n\nAlthough Bolzano anticipated the form that the rigorous formulation of\nthe concepts of the calculus would assume, his work was largely\nignored in his lifetime. The cornerstone for the rigorous development\nof the calculus was supplied by the ideas\u2014essentially similar to\nBolzano\u2019s\u2014of the great French mathematician Augustin-Louis\nCauchy (1789\u20131857). In Cauchy\u2019s work, as in\nBolzano\u2019s, a central role is played by a purely arithmetical\nconcept of limit freed of all geometric and temporal intuition. Cauchy\nalso formulates the condition for a sequence of real numbers to\nconverge to a limit, and states his familiar criterion for\n convergence,[26]\n namely, that a sequence \\(\\langle s_n\\rangle\\) is convergent if and\nonly if \\(s_{n+r} - s_n\\) can be made less in absolute value than any\npreassigned quantity for all \\(r\\) and sufficiently large \\(n\\).\nCauchy proves that this is necessary for convergence, but as to\nsufficiency of the condition merely remarks \u201cwhen the various\nconditions are fulfilled, the convergence of the series is\nassured\u201d (Kline 1972: 951). In making this latter assertion he\nis implicitly appealing to geometric intuition, since he makes no\nattempt to define real numbers, observing only that irrational numbers\nare to be regarded as the limits of sequences of rational numbers.\n\nCauchy chose to characterize the continuity of functions in terms of a\nrigorized notion of infinitesimal, which he defines in the Cours\nd\u2019analyse as \u201ca variable quantity [whose value]\ndecreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge to the limit\n0\u201d (Kline 1972: 951). Here is his definition of\ncontinuity. Cauchy\u2019s definition of continuity of \\(f(x)\\) in the\nneighborhood of a value \\(a\\) amounts to the condition, in modern\nnotation, that \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a}f(x) = f(a)\\). Cauchy defines\nthe derivative \\(f '(x)\\) of a function \\(f(x)\\) in a manner\nessentially identical to that of Bolzano.\n\nThe work of Cauchy (as well as that of Bolzano) represents a crucial\nstage in the renunciation by mathematicians\u2014adumbrated in the\nwork of d\u2019Alembert\u2014of (fixed) infinitesimals and the\nintuitive ideas of continuity and motion. Certain mathematicians of\nthe day, such as Poisson and Cournot, who regarded the limit concept\nas no more than a circuitous substitute for the use of infinitesimally\nsmall magnitudes\u2014which in any case (they claimed) had a real\nexistence\u2014felt that Cauchy\u2019s reforms had been carried too\nfar. But traces of the traditional ideas did in fact remain in\nCauchy\u2019s formulations, as evidenced by his use of such\nexpressions as \u201cvariable quantities\u201d, \u201cinfinitesimal\nquantities\u201d, \u201capproach indefinitely\u201d, \u201cas\nlittle as one wishes\u201d (Kline 1972: 951) and the\n like.[27]\n\nMeanwhile the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815\u201397)\nwas completing the banishment of spatiotemporal intuition, and the\ninfinitesimal, from the foundations of analysis. To instill complete\nlogical rigor Weierstrass proposed to establish mathematical analysis\non the basis of number alone, to\n \u201carithmetize\u201d[28]\n it\u2014in effect, to replace the continuous by the discrete.\n\u201cArithmetization\u201d may be seen as a form of mathematical\natomism. In pursuit of this goal Weierstrass had first to formulate a\nrigorous \u201carithmetical\u201d definition of real number. He did\nthis by defining a (positive) real number to be a countable set of\npositive rational numbers for which the sum of any finite subset\nalways remains below some preassigned bound, and then specifying the\nconditions under which two such \u201creal numbers\u201d are to be\nconsidered equal, or strictly less than one another.\n\nWeierstrass was concerned to purge the foundations of analysis of all\ntraces of the intuition of continuous motion\u2014in a word, to\nreplace the variable by the static. For Weierstrass a variable \\(x\\)\nwas simply a symbol designating an arbitrary member of a given set of\nnumbers, and a continuous variable one whose corresponding set \\(S\\)\nhas the property that any interval around any member \\(x\\) of \\(S\\)\ncontains members of \\(S\\) other than \\(x\\). Weierstrass also\nformulated the familiar \\((\\varepsilon , \\delta)\\) definition of\ncontinuous\n function:[29]\n a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) if for any \\(\\varepsilon\n\\gt 0\\) there is a \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\lvert f(x) -\nf(a)\\rvert \\lt \\varepsilon\\) for all \\(x\\) such that \\(\\lvert x -\na\\rvert \\lt\n \\delta\\).[30]\n\nFollowing Weierstrass\u2019s efforts, another attack on the problem\nof formulating rigorous definitions of continuity and the real numbers\nwas mounted by Richard Dedekind (1831\u20131916). Dedekind focussed\nattention on the question: exactly what is it that distinguishes a\ncontinuous domain from a discontinuous one? He seems to have been the\nfirst to recognize that the property of density, possessed by the\nordered set of rational numbers, is insufficient to guarantee\ncontinuity. In Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872) he\nremarks that when the rational numbers are associated to points on a\nstraight line, \u201cthere are infinitely many points [on the line]\nto which no rational number corresponds\u201d (1872: section 3 [1999:\n770]) so that the rational numbers manifest \u201ca gappiness,\nincompleteness, discontinuity\u201d, in contrast with the straight\nline\u2019s \u201cabsence of gaps, completeness, continuity\u201d\n(1872: section 3 [1999: 771]). Dedekind regards this principle as\nbeing essentially indemonstrable; he ascribes to it, rather, the\nstatus of an axiom \u201cby which we attribute to the line its\ncontinuity, by which we think continuity into the line\u201d (1872\n[1999: 771\u2013772]. It is not, Dedekind stresses, necessary for\nspace to be continuous in this sense, for \u201cmany of its\nproperties would remain the same even if it were discontinuous\u201d\n(1872 [1999: 772]).\n\nThe filling-up of gaps in the rational numbers through the\n\u201ccreation of new point-individuals\u201d (1872 [1999: 772]) is\nthe key idea underlying Dedekind\u2019s construction of the domain of\nreal numbers. He first defines a cut to be a partition\n\\((A_1,\\) \\(A_2)\\) of the rational numbers such that every member of\n\\(A_1\\) is less than every member of \\(A_2\\). After noting that each\nrational number corresponds, in an evident way, to a cut, he observes\nthat infinitely many cuts fail to be engendered by rational numbers.\nThe discontinuity or incompleteness of the domain of rational numbers\nconsists precisely in this latter fact.\n\nIt is to be noted that Dedekind does not identify irrational numbers\nwith cuts; rather, each irrational number is newly\n\u201ccreated\u201d by a mental act, and remains quite distinct from\nits associated cut. Dedekind goes on to show how the domain of cuts,\nand thereby the associated domain of real numbers, can be ordered in\nsuch a way as to possess the property of continuity, viz.\n\n\n\nif the system \\(\\Re\\) of all real numbers divides into two classes\n\\(\\fA_1\\), \\(\\fA_2\\) such that every number \\(a_1\\) of the class\n\\(\\fA_1\\) is less than every number \\(a_2\\) of the class \\(\\fA_2\\),\nthen there exists one and only one number by which this separation is\nproduced. (1872: section 5 [1999: 776])\n\n\nThe most visionary \u201carithmetizer\u201d of all was Georg\n Cantor[31]\n (1845\u20131918). Cantor\u2019s analysis of the continuum in terms\nof infinite point sets led to his theory of transfinite numbers and to\nthe eventual freeing of the concept of set from its geometric origins\nas a collection of points, so paving the way for the emergence of the\nconcept of general abstract set central to today\u2019s mathematics.\nLike Weierstrass and Dedekind, Cantor aimed to formulate an adequate\ndefinition of the real numbers which avoided the presupposition of\ntheir prior existence, and he follows them in basing his definition on\nthe rational numbers. Following Cauchy, he calls a sequence \\(a_1,\\)\n\\(a_2 ,\\)\u2026, \\(a_n,\\)\u2026 of rational numbers a\nfundamental sequence if there exists an integer \\(N\\) such\nthat, for any positive rational \\(\\varepsilon\\), there exists an\ninteger \\(N\\) such that \\(\\lvert a_{n+m} - a_n \\rvert \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\) for all \\(m\\) and all \\(n \\gt N\\). Any sequence\n\\(\\langle a_n\\rangle\\) satisfying this condition is said to have a\ndefinite limit b. Dedekind had taken irrational numbers to be\nmental objects associated with cuts, so, analogously, Cantor\nregards these definite limits, as nothing more than formal\nsymbols associated with fundamental sequences (Dauben 1979:\n38). The domain \\(B\\) of such symbols may be considered an enlargement\nof the domain \\(A\\) of rational numbers. After imposing an\narithmetical structure on the domain \\(B\\), Cantor is emboldened to\nrefer to its elements as (real) numbers. Nevertheless, he\nstill insists that these \u201cnumbers\u201d have no existence\nexcept as representatives of fundamental sequences. Cantor then shows\nthat each point on the line corresponds to a definite element of\n\\(B\\). Conversely, each element of \\(B\\) should determine a definite\npoint on the line. Realizing that the intuitive nature of the linear\ncontinuum precludes a rigorous proof of this property, Cantor simply\nassumes it as an axiom, just as Dedekind had done in regard to his\nprinciple of continuity.\n\nFor Cantor, who began as a number-theorist, and throughout his career\ncleaved to the discrete, it was numbers, rather than geometric points,\nthat possessed objective significance. Indeed the isomorphism between\nthe discrete numerical domain \\(B\\) and the linear continuum was\nregarded by Cantor essentially as a device for facilitating the\nmanipulation of numbers.\n\nCantor\u2019s arithmetization of the continuum had the following\nimportant consequence. It had long been recognized that the sets of\npoints of any pair of line segments, even if one of them is infinite\nin length, can be placed in one-one correspondence. This fact was\ntaken to show that such sets of points have no well-defined\n\u201csize\u201d. But Cantor\u2019s identification of the set of\npoints on a linear continuum with a domain of numbers enabled the\nsizes of point sets to be compared in a definite way, using\nthe well-grounded idea of one-one correspondence between sets\nof numbers.\n\nCantor\u2019s investigations into the properties of subsets of the\nlinear continuum are presented in six masterly papers published during\n1879\u201384, \u00dcber unendliche lineare\nPunktmannichfaltigkeiten (\u201cOn infinite, linear point\nmanifolds\u201d). Remarkable in their richness of ideas, these papers\nprovide the first accounts of Cantor\u2019s revolutionary theory of\ninfinite sets and its application to the classification of subsets of\nthe linear continuum. In the fifth of these papers, the\nGrundlagen of 1883, are to be found some of Cantor\u2019s\nmost searching observations on the nature of the continuum.\n\nCantor begins his examination of the continuum with a tart summary of\nthe controversies that have traditionally surrounded the notion,\nremarking that the continuum has until recently been regarded as an\nessentially unanalyzable concept. It is Cantor\u2019s concern to \n\n\ndevelop the concept of the continuum as soberly and briefly as\npossible, and only with regard to the mathematical theory of\nsets. (1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 2, p. 903]) \n\n\nThis opens the way, he believes, to the formulation of an exact\nconcept of the continuum. Cantor points out that the idea of the\ncontinuum has heretofore merely been presupposed by mathematicians\nconcerned with the analysis of continuous functions and the like, and\nhas \u201cnot been subjected to any more thorough inspection\u201d\n(1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 3, p. 904]).\n\nRepudiating any use of spatial or temporal intuition in an exact\ndetermination of the continuum, Cantor undertakes its precise\narithmetical definition. Making reference to the definition of real\nnumber he has already provided (i.e., in terms of fundamental\nsequences), he introduces the \\(n\\)-dimensional arithmetical space\n\\(G_n\\) as the set of all \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers \\(\\langle\nx_1,x_2 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\rangle\\), calling each such an arithmetical\npoint of \\(G_{n.}\\) The distance between two such points is given\nby \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x'_1 - x_1)^2  + (x'_2 - x_2)^2 + \\ldots (x'_n - x_n)^2}\n\\]\n\n\nCantor defines an arithmetical point-set in \\(G_n\\) to be any\n\u201caggregate of points of the points of the space \\(G_n\\) that is\ngiven in a lawlike way\u201d (1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 6, p.\n904]).\n\nAfter remarking that he has previously shown that all spaces \\(G_n\\)\nhave the same power as the set of real numbers in the interval (0,1),\nand reiterating his conviction that any infinite point sets has either\nthe power of the set of natural numbers or that of\n (0,1),[32]\n Cantor turns to the definition of the general concept of a continuum\nwithin \\(G_{n}.\\) For this he employs the concept of\nderivative or derived set of a point set introduced\nin a paper of 1872 on trigonometric series. Cantor had defined the derived\nset of a point set \\(P\\) to be the set of limit points of\n\\(P,\\) where a limit point of \\(P\\) is a point of \\(P\\) with\ninfinitely many points of \\(P\\) arbitrarily close to it. A point set\nis called perfect if it coincides with its derived\n set.[33]\n Cantor observes that this condition does not suffice to characterize\na continuum, since perfect sets can be constructed in the linear\ncontinuum which are dense in no interval, however small: as an example\nof such a set he offers the\n set[34]\n consisting of all real numbers in (0,1) whose ternary expansion does\nnot contain a \u201c1\u201d.\n\nAccordingly an additional condition is needed to define a continuum.\nCantor supplies this by introducing the concept of a\nconnected set. A point set \\(T\\) is connected in\nCantor\u2019s sense if for any pair of its points \\(t, t'\\) and any\narbitrarily small number \\(\\varepsilon\\) there is a finite sequence of\npoints \\(t_1,\\) \\(t_2,\\)\u2026, \\(t_n\\) of \\(T\\) for which the\ndistances \\([tt_1],\\) \\([t_1 t_2],\\) \\([t_2 t_3],\\) \u2026, \\([t_n\nt'],\\) are all less than \\(\\varepsilon\\). Cantor now defines a\ncontinuum to be a perfect connected point set.\n\nCantor has advanced beyond his predecessors in formulating what is in\nessence a topological definition of continuum, one that,\nwhile still dependent on metric notions, does not involve an order\n relation.[35]\nIt is interesting to compare Cantor\u2019s definition with the\ndefinition of continuum in modern general topology. In a well-known\ntextbook (Hocking & Young 1961: 43) on the subject we find\na continuum defined as a compact connected subset of a\ntopological space. Now within any bounded region of Euclidean\nspace it can be shown that Cantor\u2019s continua coincide with\ncontinua in the sense of the modern definition. While Cantor lacked\nthe definition of compactness, his requirement that continua be\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (which led to his rejecting as continua such\nnoncompact sets as open intervals or discs) is not far away from the\nidea.\n\nThroughout Cantor\u2019s mathematical career he maintained an\nunwavering, even dogmatic opposition to infinitesimals, attacking the\nefforts of mathematicians such as du Bois-Reymond and\nVeronese[36]\nto formulate rigorous theories of actual infinitesimals. As far as\nCantor was concerned, the infinitesimal was beyond the realm of the\npossible; infinitesimals were no more than \u201ccastles in the air,\nor rather just nonsense\u201d (1893 [1965: 506], translated by Fisher\n1981: 118), to be classed \u201cwith circular squares and square\ncircles\u201d (1893 [1965: 507], translated by Fisher 1981: 118). His\nabhorrence of infinitesimals went so deep as to move him to outright\nvilification, branding them as \u201cCholera-bacilli of\nmathematics\u201d (1893 [1965: 505], translated by Fisher 1981:\n116). Cantor\u2019s rejection of infinitesimals stemmed from his\nconviction that his own theory of transfinite ordinal and cardinal\nnumbers exhausted the realm of the numerable, so that no further\ngeneralization of the concept of number, in particular any which\nembraced infinitesimals, was admissible.\n",
