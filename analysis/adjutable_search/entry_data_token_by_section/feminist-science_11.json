Just such a rethinking is taken up as\nan aspect of queer science studies. Queer science studies is queer\nboth in its challenge to beliefs about what are \u201cordinary\u201d\nor \u201cnatural\u201d features of the world (beliefs about sex and\nsexuality, for example) and in its subject matter\u2014behavior and\nsubjects that have not traditionally been topics of science.\n\nWhile queer perspectives are not equivalent to feminist\nperspectives\u2014there are feminists who do not consider the gender\nbinary to be a problem in itself, for example\u2014they may\nnonetheless be thought of as extending approaches that feminists have\ntaken to critiquing dominant assumptions about sex and gender. Queer\nstudies does so more radically, however. Consider the distinction\nbetween sex and gender. The distinction arose as a way of separating\nbiological characteristics through which humans are classified into\nsexes from social attributions through which they are gendered.\nRoughly, characteristics directly associated with reproduction or\nsecondary sex traits were to be classed as the former whereas the\nsocial roles, clothing, and behavior associated with the different\nsexes were said to belong to the latter category. The idea allowed\nfeminists to argue that biological distinctions should not determine\nsocial role\u2014that biology was not destiny. Some feminists\nultimately challenged the distinction in part because of the presumed\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d of sex, its associations with a\n\u201cnatural\u201d sexuality, and the recognition of the role that\nsuch assumptions play in science, including biology (ideas about\nreproduction) and scientific work on sexuality. In addition, the way\nsocial understandings of sex\u2014beliefs about gender\u2014shaped\nthese sciences also has become clearer. (See the discussion in\n section 2.2.)\n Thus, in practice, ideas of sex and gender turn out to be difficult\nto separate. Although the distinction has not been without\nbenefit\u2014Deboleena Roy and Banu Subramaniam point out how the\ndistinction gave rise to productive work countering claims of\nbiological determinism by providing tools for discussing the social\nconstruction of the body, for example (Roy & Subramaniam 2016:\n25)\u2014it has problems as well. \n\nQueer science studies have been more explicit about addressing\ndifficulties with the distinction and the reasons for doing so. Of\nparticular concern is the way medicine is implicated in the lives of\nintersex and trans individuals and the role of problematic assumptions\nunderlying that medicine. Prominent among these are the assumptions\nthat sexual identity is based in nature (biology) and also the belief\nthat characteristics that are stereotypically identified with one or\nanother gender are natural (based in biology). For example, Dussauge\nand Kaiser, voice such a challenge to the first of these and argue\nthat it should be replaced with an understanding of sexual identity as\nconstructed through \u201ccomplex heteronormative power relations and\nsex/gendered norms\u201d (Dussauge & Kaiser 2012: 122). This\nalternative framing encourages new approaches to scientific research\nfrom a queer perspective.\n\nA recent collection, Queer Feminist Science Studies: A Reader\n(Cipolla et al. 2017), emphasizes the connection to feminism both in\nits title and in the editors\u2019 introduction where the focus is on\nthe dualisms that are part of the sex/gender framework (e.g.,\nnature/culture, male/female, normal/deviant) and how they shape\nsociety and consequently the social practices of scientific\nresearch.\n\n\n[W]e argue that queer theory sharpens feminist engagements with\nscience by turning critical attention to the imbrication or dependence\nof center and periphery, inside and outside, natural and artificial,\nand normativity and deviance. Rather than being opposed, these terms\nare coentangled divisions produced through specific histories. Thus,\nthere is now a rich array of queer work that contests the\nnaturalization of the categories of normal and deviant sexuality and\nbinarized notions of sexed anatomy, gender identity, sexual desire,\nand sexual identity. (Cipolla, et al. 2017: 12)\n\n\nAnne Fausto-Sterling\u2019s research on the historical emergence of\nthe idea that there are two sexes exemplifies the kind of critique\nthat informs queer science studies. She traces this particular binary\nto the increasing involvement of science in deciding the fate of\nintersexual individuals, beginning in the nineteenth century. This\ndevelopment was partly a result of the emergence of sexuality as a\nproper subject of scientific study at this time, coupled with a belief\nthat science describes nature as it really is and hence should be\nappealed to when we were uncertain about nature. Fausto-Sterling\nidentifies several questionable assumptions underlying this research.\nThe first is that science is indeed able to provide objectivity on\nissues of sexual identity and sexuality. Second, that the\nclassification of humans into two sexes is natural. The final\nassumption she identifies is that science will find this\nclassification in nature through identifying the defining or essential\ncharacteristics of each of the two sexes.\n\nFausto-Sterling addresses each of these assumptions in turn. She\nargues that science does not provide an objective account of\nbiological sex, since science is a social and historical human\nactivity and many of the ways of thinking about sexuality and sexual\nidentity were guided by pre-existing conceptions of gender (also see\nthe discussion of objectivity in\n section 4.2).\n As an illustration, she examines the gendered understanding of female\nsexuality as passive and the way that understanding influenced the\ndesign of experiments meant to test the effect of sex hormones on the\nsexual behavior of rats (Fausto-Sterling 2000: 195\u2013232). These\nhormones were themselves classified as male and female, in spite their\nhaving other functions besides those related to reproduction and in\nspite of their presence in both those identified as male and those\nidentified as female. The results of these experiments were in turn\nused to make claims about behavior and sex in humans. This move is\nproblematically circular and additionally depends on analogical\nreasoning to human sexual behavior from the behavior of rats.\n\nAs for the other two assumptions, that there are only two sexes and\nthat they are to be identified through essential characteristics,\nFausto-Sterling points out that the idea that there are only two sexes\nshould be rejected on the basis of two sorts of evidence, social and\nscientific. The social evidence indicates that there are cultures that\nrecognize more than two sexes and the evidence from science indicates\nthis as well. In addition, various different forms of intersexuality\nbelie the notion that there are two mutually exclusive and jointly\nexhaustive sexes (Fausto-Sterling 2000: Chapter 4). The belief that\nthere are essential characteristics that are identifiers for each of\nthe two sexes is rejected through similar arguments.\nFausto-Sterling\u2019s discussion is in the context of the harms done\nto intersexual persons\u2014usually as infants who are unable to make\nchoices for themselves\u2014and so her concerns focus on the\ninjustice done in the name of a science that fails to examine these\nassumptions. \n\nSarah Richardson\u2019s work on the human genome also\nillustrates the problematic intertwining of assumptions about gender\nand research on sex (Richardson 2013;\n section 2.2).\n In a 2012 article, she focuses on how the X chromosome came to be\nidentified as \u201cfemale\u201d\u2014something that happened in\nspite of the anomalous presence of male sperm genes on X chromosomes\nand the fact that males also have X chromosomes (Richardson 2012,\nreprinted in abridged form in Cipolla et al. 2017).\n\nFausto-Sterling and Richardson provide examples of the sort of\nthinking that queer science studies is engaged in. The challenges to\ntraditional understanding of sex, sexuality, gender, gender identity,\nwhat is natural and what is cultural, what is normal and what is\ndeviant seek to disrupt conventional thinking and approaches. Insofar\nas sexist thinking is conventional, it too will be challenged.\n",
