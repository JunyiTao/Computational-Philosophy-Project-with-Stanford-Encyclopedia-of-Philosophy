    "main_text": "General Philosophical Questions about Moral Reasoning || Moral Uptake\n2.1 Moral Uptake\n\nOne advantage to defining \u201creasoning\u201d capaciously, as\nhere, is that it helps one recognize that the processes whereby we\ncome to be concretely aware of moral issues are integral to moral\nreasoning as it might more narrowly be understood. Recognizing moral\nissues when they arise requires a highly trained set of capacities and\na broad range of emotional attunements. Philosophers of the moral\nsense school of the 17th and 18th centuries stressed innate emotional\npropensities, such as sympathy with other humans. Classically\ninfluenced virtue theorists, by contrast, give more importance to the\ntraining of perception and the emotional growth that must accompany\nit. Among contemporary philosophers working in empirical ethics there\nis a similar divide, with some arguing that we process situations\nusing an innate moral grammar (Mikhail 2011) and some emphasizing the\nrole of emotions in that processing (Haidt 2001, Prinz 2007, Greene\n2014). For the moral reasoner, a crucial task for our capacities of\nmoral recognition is to mark out certain features of a situation as\nbeing morally salient. Sartre\u2019s student, for instance, focused\non the competing claims of his mother and the Free French, giving them\neach an importance to his situation that he did not give to eating\nFrench cheese or wearing a uniform. To say that certain features are\nmarked out as morally salient is not to imply that the features thus\nsingled out answer to the terms of some general principle or other: we\nwill come to the question of particularism, below. Rather, it is\nsimply to say that recognitional attention must have a selective\nfocus. \n\nWhat will be counted as a moral issue or difficulty, in the sense\nrequiring moral agents\u2019 recognition, will again vary by moral\ntheory. Not all moral theories would count filial loyalty and\npatriotism as moral duties. It is only at great cost, however, that\nany moral theory could claim to do without a layer of moral thinking\ninvolving situation-recognition. A calculative sort of utilitarianism,\nperhaps, might be imagined according to which there is no need to spot\na moral issue or difficulty, as every choice node in life\npresents the agent with the same, utility-maximizing task. Perhaps\nJeremy Bentham held a utilitarianism of this sort. For the more\nplausible utilitarianisms mentioned above, however, such as\nMill\u2019s and Hare\u2019s, agents need not always calculate\nafresh, but must instead be alive to the possibility that because the\nordinary \u201clandmarks and direction posts\u201d lead one astray\nin the situation at hand, they must make recourse to a more direct and\ncritical mode of moral reasoning. Recognizing whether one is in one of\nthose situations thus becomes the principal recognitional task for the\nutilitarian agent. (Whether this task can be suitably confined, of\ncourse, has long been one of the crucial questions about whether such\nindirect forms of utilitarianism, attractive on other grounds, can\nprevent themselves from collapsing into a more Benthamite, direct\nform: cf. Brandt 1979.) \n\nNote that, as we have been describing moral uptake, we have not\nimplied that what is perceived is ever a moral fact. Rather, it might\nbe that what is perceived is some ordinary, descriptive feature of a\nsituation that is, for whatever reason, morally relevant. An account\nof moral uptake will interestingly impinge upon the metaphysics of\nmoral facts, however, if it holds that moral facts can be perceived.\nImportantly intermediate, in this respect, is the set of judgments\ninvolving so-called \u201cthick\u201d evaluative concepts \u2013\nfor example, that someone is callous, boorish, just, or brave (see the\nentry on\n thick ethical concepts).\n These do not invoke the supposedly \u201cthinner\u201d terms of\noverall moral assessment, \u201cgood,\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d\nYet they are not innocent of normative content, either. Plainly, we do\nrecognize callousness when we see clear cases of it. Plainly, too\n\u2013 whatever the metaphysical implications of the last fact\n\u2013 our ability to describe our situations in these thick\nnormative terms is crucial to our ability to reason morally. \n\nIt is debated how closely our abilities of moral discernment are tied\nto our moral motivations. For Aristotle and many of his ancient\nsuccessors, the two are closely linked, in that someone not brought up\ninto virtuous motivations will not see things correctly. For instance,\ncowards will overestimate dangers, the rash will underestimate them,\nand the virtuous will perceive them correctly (Eudemian\nEthics 1229b23\u201327). By the Stoics, too, having the right\nmotivations was regarded as intimately tied to perceiving the world\ncorrectly; but whereas Aristotle saw the emotions as allies to enlist\nin support of sound moral discernment, the Stoics saw them as inimical\nto clear perception of the truth (cf. Nussbaum 2001). \n",
