Against the \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d\n\nThe unwillingness to be drawn into discussing particular ethical\nissues that Williams complains of was a reflection of earlier\ndevelopments. In particular, it was a reflection of the logical\npositivists\u2019 disdain for \u201cmoralising\u201d, a disdain\nwhich arose naturally from the emotivist conviction of philosophers\nsuch as A.J.Ayer that to utter one\u2019s first-order moral beliefs\nwas to say nothing capable of truth or falsehood, but simply to\nexpress one\u2019s attitudes, and hence not a properly\nphilosophical activity at all. More properly philosophical,\non emotivist and similar views, was a research-programme that became\nabsolutely dominant during the 1950s and 1960s in Anglophone\nphilosophy, including moral philosophy. This was linguistic analysis\nin the post-Wittgensteinian style of J.L.Austin, who hoped, starting\nfrom an examination of the way we talk (whoever \u201cwe\u201d may\nbe: more on that in a minute), to reveal the deep structure of a wide\nvariety of philosophically interesting phenomena: among the most\nsuccessful applications of Austin\u2019s method were his studies of\nintention, other minds, and responsibility.\n\nWhen Ayer\u2019s dislike of preaching and Austin\u2019s method of\nlinguistic analysis were combined in moral philosophy, one notable\n result[4]\n was Richard Hare\u2019s \u201cuniversal presciptivism\u201d, a\nmoral system which claimed to derive the form of all first-order moral\nutterances simply from linguistic analysis of the two little words\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d. Hare argued that it\nfollowed from the logic of these terms, when used in their full or\nspecially moral sense, that moral utterances were (1) distinct from\nother utterances in being, not assertions about how the world is, but\nprescriptions about how we think it ought to be; and (2) distinct from\nother prescriptions in being universalisable, by which Hare\nmeant that anyone who was willing to make such a prescription about\nany agent, e.g. himself, should be equally willing to make it about\nany other similarly-placed agent. In this way Hare\u2019s theory\npreserved the important emotivist thesis that a person\u2019s moral\ncommitments are not rationally challengeable for their content, but\nonly for their coherence with that person\u2019s other moral\ncommitments\u2014and thus tended to keep philosophical attention away\nfrom questions about the content of such\n commitments.[5]\n At the same time, his system was also able to accommodate a central\npart of the Kantian outlook, because it gave a\n rationale[6]\n for the twin views that moral commitments are overriding as\nmotivations (so that they will motivate if present), and that\nthey are overriding as rational justifications (so that they\nrationally must motivate if they are present). Hence cases\nlike akrasia, where a moral commitment appears to be present\nin an agent but gets overridden by something else along the way to\naction, must on Hare\u2019s view be cases where something has gone\nwrong: either the agent is irrational, or else she has not really\nuttered a full-blown moral ought, a properly moral\ncommitment, either because (1) the prescription that she claims to\naccept is not really one that she accepts at all, or (2) because\nalthough she does sincerely accept this prescription, she is not\nprepared to give it a fully universalised form, and hence does not\naccept it as a distinctively moral prescription.\n\nIn assessing a position like Hare\u2019s, Williams and other critics\noften begin with the formidable difficulties involved in the project\nof deducing anything much about the structure of morality from the\nlogic of moral language: see e.g., Geach, \u201cGood and Evil\u201d,\nAnalysis 1956, and Williams 1972: 52\u201361. These\ndifficulties are especially acute when the moral language we consider\nis basically just the words \u201cought\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d\nand their opposites. \u201cIf there is to be attention to language,\nthen there should be attention to more of it\u201d (Williams 1985:\n127); the closest Williams comes to inheriting the ambitions of\nlinguistic analysis is his defence of the notion of morally\n\u201cthick concepts\u201d (1985:\n 140\u2013143)[7].\n These\u2014Williams gives coward, lie, brutality and\ngratitude as examples\u2014are concepts that sustain an\nethical load of a culturally-conditioned form, and hence succeed both\nin being action-guiding (for members of that culture), and in making\navailable (to members of that culture) something that can reasonably\nbe described as ethical knowledge. Given that my society has\narrived at the concept of brutality, that is to say has got clear, at\nleast implicitly, about the circumstances under which it is or is not\napplicable, there can be facts about brutality (hence,\nethical facts) and also justified true\n beliefs[8]\n about brutality (hence, ethical knowledge). Moreover, this knowledge\ncan be lost, and will be lost, if the concept and its social context\nis lost. (For a strikingly similar philosophical project to that\nsuggested by this talk of thick concepts, cp. Anscombe 1958a, and\nPhilippa Foot\u2019s papers \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d and\n\u201cMoral Arguments\u201d, both in her Virtues and\nVices.)\n\nBefore we even get to the problem how the structure of morality is\nsupposed to follow from moral language, there is the prior question\n\u201cWhose moral language?\u201d; and this is a deeper\nquestion. We do not suppose that all moral language (not even\u2014to\ngesture towards an obviously enormous difficulty\u2014all moral\nlanguage in English) has always and everywhere had\nexactly the same presuppositions, social context, or cultural\nsignificance. So why we should suppose that moral language has always\nand everywhere had exactly the same meaning, and has always been\nequally amenable to the analysis of its logical structure offered by\nHare? (Or by anyone else: it can hardly be insignificant that when\nG.E.Moore (Principia Ethica sections 17, 89) anticipated Hare by\noffering a linguistic analysis of \u201cgood\u201d, his analysis of\nthis term was on the face of it quite different from Hare\u2019s,\ndespite Moore\u2019s extreme historical and cultural proximity to\nHare.) Basing moral objectivism on the foundations of a linguistic\napproach leaves it more vulnerable to relativistic worries than other\nfoundations do. For on the linguistic approach, we also face a\nquestion of authority, the question why, even if something like the\noffered analysis of our moral language were correct, that should\nlicense us to think that the moral language of our society\nhas any kind of universal jurisdiction over any\nsociety\u2019s. In its turn, this question is very apt to breed the\nfurther question how, if our moral language lacks this universal\njurisdiction over other societies, it can make good its claim to\njurisdiction even in our society.\n\nThese latter points about authority are central to Williams\u2019\ncritique of contemporary moral philosophy. Like Anscombe before him,\nWilliams argues that the analysts\u2019 tight focus on such words as\n\u201cought\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and \u201cgood\u201d has\ncome, in moral theory, to give those words (when used in their alleged\n\u201cspecial moral sense\u201d) an air of authority which they\ncould only earn against a moral and religious backdrop\u2014roughly,\nthe Christian world-view\u2014that is nowadays largely missing. What\nWilliams takes to be the correct verdict on modern moral theory is\ntherefore rather like Nietzsche\u2019s on George\n Eliot:[9]\n the idea that morality can and will go on just as before in the\nabsence of religious belief is simply an illusion that reflects a lack\nof \u201chistorical sense\u201d. As\n Anscombe[10]\n puts it (1958: 30), \u201cit is not possible to have a [coherent law\nconception of ethics] unless you believe in God as a law-giver\u2026\nIt is as if the notion \u2018criminal\u2019 were to remain when\ncriminal law and criminal courts had been abolished and\nforgotten.\u201d And as Williams puts it (1985: 38), the\n\u201cvarious features of the moral judgement system support each\nother, and collectively they are modelled on the prerogatives of a\nPelagian God.\u201d\n\nWhat then are these features? That is a big question, because Williams\nspent pretty well his whole career describing and criticising them.\nBut he gives his most straightforward, and perhaps the definitive,\nsummary of what the \u201cmorality system\u201d comes to in the last\nchapter of Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. (The\nchapter\u2019s title provocatively describes morality as \u201cthe\npeculiar institution\u201d, this phrase being the American\nConfederacy\u2019s standard euphemism for\n slavery.[11])\n\nFollowing this account, we may venture to summarise the\n\u201cmorality system\u201d in nine leading\n theses.[12]\nFirst, the morality system is essentially practical:\nmy moral obligations are always things that I can do, so that\n\u201cif my deliberation issues in something that I cannot do, then I\nmust deliberate again\u201d (1985: 175). This implies,\nsecond, that moral obligations cannot (really)\nconflict (185: 176). Third, the system includes a\npressure towards generalisation which Williams calls \u201cthe\nobligation out-obligation in principle\u201d: this is the\nview that every particular moral obligation needs the logical backing\nof a general moral obligation, of which it is to be explained as an\ninstance. Fourth, \u201cmoral obligation is\ninescapable\u201d (185: 177): \u201cthe fact that a given agent\nwould prefer not to be in [the morality] system will not excuse\nhim\u201d, because moral considerations are, in some sense like the\nsenses sharpened up by Kant and by Hare, overriding\nconsiderations. In any deliberative contest between a moral obligation\nand some other consideration, the moral obligation will always win\nout, according to the morality system. The only thing that\ncan trump an obligation is another obligation (1985: 180);\nthis is a fifth thesis of the morality system, and it\ncreates pressure towards a sixth, that as many as\npossible of the considerations that we find practically important\nshould be represented as moral obligations, and that considerations\nthat cannot take the form of obligations cannot really be important\nafter all (1985: 179). Seventh, there is a view about\nthe impossibility of \u201cmoral luck\u201d that we might call, as\nWilliams calls it, the \u201cpurity of morality\u201d (1985:\n195\u20136): \u201cmorality makes people think that, without its\nvery special obligation, there is only inclination; without its utter\nvoluntariness, there is only force; without its ultimately pure\njustice, there is no justice\u201d; whereas \u201cin truth\u201d,\nWilliams insists, \u201calmost all worthwhile human life lies between\nthe extremes that morality puts before us\u201d (1985: 194).\nEighth, \u201cblame is the characteristic reaction\nof the morality system\u201d to a failure to meet one of its\nobligations (1985: 177); and \u201cblame of anyone is directed to the\nvoluntary\u201d (1985: 178). Ninth, and finally, the\nmorality system is impersonal. We shall set this last feature of the\nsystem aside until section 4, and focus, for now, on the other\neight.\n\nFor each of the theses, Williams has something (at least one thing) of\ndeep interest to say about why we should reject it. The\nfirst and second\u2014about the\npracticality of morality and the impossibility of real\nconflict\u2014are his target in his well-known early paper\n\u201cEthical Consistency\u201d (PS: 166\u2013186). In real life,\nWilliams argues, there surely are cases where we find ourselves under\nethical demands which conflict. These conflicts are not always\neliminable in the way that the morality system requires them always to\nbe\u2014by arguments leading to the conclusion that one of the\noughts was only prima facie (in Ross\u2019s\nterminology: see Williams 1985: 176\u2013177), or pro tanto\n(in a more recent terminology: see Kagan 1989), or in some other way\neliminable from our moral accounting. But, Williams argues, \u201cit\nis surely falsifying of moral\n thought[13]\n to represent its logic as demanding that in a conflict\u2026 one of\nthe conflicting oughts must be totally rejected [on the\ngrounds that] it did not actually apply\u201d (PS:\n 183\u20134).[14]\n For the fact that it did actually apply is registered by all sorts of\nfacts in our moral experience, including the very important phenomenon\nof ineliminable agent-regret, regret not just that something happened,\nbut that it was me who made it happen (1981: 27\u201330).\n\nSuppose for\n example[15]\n that I, an officer of a wrecked ship, take the hard decision to\nactively prevent further castaways from climbing onto my already\ndangerously overcrowded lifeboat. Afterwards, I am tormented when I\nremember how I smashed the spare oar repeatedly over the heads and\nhands of desperate, drowning people. Yet what I did certainly brought\nit about that as many people as possible were saved from the\nshipwreck, so that a utilitarian would say that I brought about the\nbest consequences, and anyone might agree that I found the only\npracticable way of avoiding a dramatically worse outcome. Moreover, as\na Kantian might point out, there was nothing unfair or\nmalicious about what I did in using the minimum force\nnecessary to repel further boarders: my aim, since I could not save\nevery life, was to save those who by no choice of mine just happened\nto be in the lifeboat already; this was an aim that I properly had,\ngiven my role as a ship\u2019s officer; and it was absolutely not my\nintention to kill or (perhaps) even to injure anyone.\n\nSo what will typical advocates of the morality system have to say to\nme afterwards about my dreadful sense of\n regret?[16]\n If they are\u2014as perhaps they had better not be\u2014totally\nconsistent and totally honest with me, what they will have to say is\nsimply \u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought; you did what\nmorality required, so your deep anguish about it is irrational.\u201d\nAnd that, surely, cannot be the right thing for anyone to say. My\nanguish is not irrational but entirely justified. Moreover, it is\njustified simply as an ex post facto response to what I did:\nit does not for instance depend for its propriety upon the\nsuggestion\u2014a characteristic one, for many modern moral\ntheorists\u2014that there is prospective value for the future in my\nbeing the kind of person who will have such reactions.\n\nThe third thesis Williams mentions as a part of the\nmorality system is the obligation out-obligation in\nprinciple, the view that every particular moral obligation needs the\nbacking of a general moral obligation, of which it is to be explained\nas an instance. Williams argues that this thesis will typically engage\nthe deliberating agent in commitments that he should not have. For one\nthing, the principle commits the agent to an implausibly demanding\nview of morality (1985: 181\u2013182):\n\nThe immediate claim on me, \u201cIn this emergency, I am under an\nobligation to help\u201d, is thought to come from, \u201cOne is\nunder this general obligation: to help in an emergency\u201d\u2026\nBut once the journey into more general obligations has started, we may\nbegin to get into trouble\u2014not just philosophical trouble, but\nconscience trouble\u2014with finding room for morally indifferent\nactions\u2026 if we have accepted general and indeterminate\nobligations to further various moral objectives\u2026 they will be\nwaiting to provide work for idle hands, and the thought can gain a\nfooting that\u2026 I am under an obligation not to waste time in\ndoing things that I am under no obligation to do. At this stage,\ncertainly, only an obligation can beat an obligation [cp. the\nfourth thesis], and in order to do what I wanted to\ndo, I shall need one of those fraudulent items, a duty to myself.\n\n\nIt is only the pressure to systematise that leads us to infer that, if\nit is X\u2019s particular obligation in S to \u03c6,\nthen this must be because there is a general obligation, on any\nX-like agent, to \u03c6 in any S-like\n situation.[17]\n Unless some systematic account of morality is true\u2014as Williams\nof course denies\u2014there is no obvious reason why this inference\nmust hold in any more than trivial sense. But even if it does hold, it\nis not clear how the general duty explains the particular\none; why are general obligations any more explanatory than particular\nones? Certainly anyone who is puzzled as to why there is this\nparticular obligation, say to rescue one\u2019s wife, is unlikely to\nfind it very illuminating to be pointed towards the general obligation\nof which it is meant to be an instance. (Williams\u2019 closeness to\ncertain particularist strategies should be obvious here: cp. Dancy\n2004, and Chappell 2005.)\n\nAnother inappropriate commitment arising from the obligation\nout-obligation in principle, famously spelled out at 1981: 18, is\nthe agent\u2019s commitment to a \u201cthought too many\u201d. If\nan agent is in a situation where he has to choose which of two people\nto rescue from some catastrophe, and chooses the one of the two people\nwho is his wife, then \u201cit might have been hoped by some people\n(for instance, by his wife) that his motivating thought, fully spelled\nout, would be the thought that it was his wife, not that it was his\nwife and that in situations of this kind it is permissible to save\none\u2019s wife.\u201d The morality system, Williams is suggesting,\nmakes nonsense of the agent\u2019s action in rescuing his wife: its\ninsistence on generality obscures the particular way in which this\naction is really justified for the agent. Its real justification has\nnothing to do with the impersonal and impartial standards of morality,\nand everything to do with the place in the agent\u2019s life of the\nperson he chooses to rescue. For Williams, the standard of \u201cwhat\nmakes life meaningful\u201d is always deeper and more genuinely\nexplanatory than the canon of moral obligation; the point is central,\nand we shall come back to it below in sections 3 and 4.\n\nWilliams\u2019 opposition to the fourth thesis,\nabout the inescapability of morality, rests on the closely-related\ncontrast he draws between moral considerations, and considerations\nabout \u201cimportance\u201d: \u201cethical life is important, but\nit can see that things other than itself are important\u201d (1985:\n184). This notion of importance is grounded, ultimately, in the fact\n\u201cthat each person has a life to lead\u201d (1985: 186). What is\nimportant, in this sense, is whatever humans need to make it possible\nto lead what can reasonably be recognised as meaningful lives; the\nnotion of importance is of ethical use because, and insofar as, it\nreflects the facts about \u201cwhat we can understand men as needing\nand wanting\u201d (1972: 95). The notion that moral obligation is\ninescapable is undermined by careful attention to this concept of\nimportance, simply because reflection shows that the notion of moral\nobligation will have to be grounded in the notion of importance if it\nis to be grounded in anything that is not simply illusory. But if it\nis grounded in that, then it cannot itself be the only thing that\nmatters. Hence moral obligation cannot be inescapable, which refutes\nthe fourth thesis of the morality system; other\nconsiderations can sometimes override or trump an obligation without\nthemselves being obligations, which refutes the\nfifth; and there can be no point in trying to\nrepresent every practically important consideration as a moral\nobligation, so that it is for instance a distortion for Ross (The\nRight and The Good, 21 ff.) to talk of \u201cduties of\ngratitude\u201d (1985: 181); which refutes the\nsixth.\n\nIt is worth noting that the fourth thesis,\nthat morality is inescapable for all agents in all\nsituations, has implications beyond the realm of personal ethics.\nWilliams\u2019 most enduring contribution to political philosophy is\nhis denial of political moralism, the view that that politics\nis always and everywhere regulated by morality. The result is his\ncelebrated political realist position, which denies that legitimate\npolitics can just consist in the systematic application of some moral\ntheory or principle. Rather, for Williams, the basic political\nquestion is: can the state secure the bare conditions of \u201corder,\nprotection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation\u201d?\nIf so, it has met the Basic Legitimation Demand, which is not\na moral demand but rather a kind of precondition for the existence of\npolitics at all. For Williams, all of this means that political\nnormativity stands outside of the morality system (IBD, ch.1). More\nconcretely, this means that certain kinds of considerations\ndistinctive to politics must be allowed to retain self-standing\npractical significance. We might illustrate this thought by noting\nthat in the realm of ordinary interpersonal ethics, it seems perfectly\nreasonable to try to reduce or minimize coercive relations, whereas in\npolitics this demand is nonsensical, since politics begins with the\nquestion of how a governing body\u2019s coercive power ought to be\ndeployed.\n\nPolitical philosophy aside, Williams also denies that personal\ndecision-making must always and everywhere be regulated by moral\nnormativity. Another vivid instance of the escapability of moral\nobligations is Williams\u2019 own example of \u201cGauguin\u201d, a\n(fictionalised) artist who deliberately rejects a whole host of moral\nobligations (to his family, for instance) because he finds it more\n\u201cimportant\u201d, in this sense, to be a painter. As Williams\ncomments (1981: 23), \u201cWhile we are sometimes guided by the\nnotion that it would be the best of worlds in which morality were\nuniversally respected and all men were of a disposition to affirm it,\nwe have, in fact, deep and persistent reasons to be grateful that that\nis not the world we have\u201d; in other words, moral obligation is\nescapable because it is not in the deepest human interest that it\nshould be inescapable. (\u201cBecause\u201d: the fact that this sort\nof inference is possible in ethics is itself a revealing fact about\nthe nature of ethics.)\n\nWilliams\u2019 Gauguin example, we have suggested, has force against\nthe thesis that morality is inescapable. It also has force against the\nseventh thesis of the morality system, its insistence\non \u201cpurity\u201d and its denial of what Williams calls\n\u201cmoral luck\u201d. To understand this notion, begin with the\nfamiliar legal facts that attempted murder is a different and less\ngrave offence than murder, and that dangerous driving typically does\nnot attract the same legal penalty if no one is actually hurt.\nInhabitants of the morality system will characteristically be puzzled\nby this distinction. How can it be right to assign different levels of\nblame, and different punishments, to two agents whose mens\nrea was exactly the same\u2014it was just that one would-be\nmurderer dropped the knife and the other didn\u2019t\u2014or to two\nequally reckless motorists\u2014one of whom just happened to miss the\npedestrians while the other just happened to hit them?\n\nOne traditional answer\u2014much favoured by the\nutilitarians\u2014is that these sorts of thoughts only go to show\nthat the point of blame and punishment is prospective\n(deterrence-based), not retrospective (desert-based). There are\nreasons for thinking that blame and punishment cannot be made sense of\nin this instrumental fashion (cp. UFA: 124, 1985: 178). \u201cFrom\nthe inside\u201d, both notions seem essentially retrospective, so\nthat if a correct understanding of them said that they were really\nfictions serving a prospective social function, no one who knew that\ncould continue to use these notions \u201cfrom the inside\u201d:\nthat is, the notions would have proved unstable under reflection for\nthis person, who would thereby have lost some ethical knowledge. If\nthis gambit fails, another answer\u2014favoured by Kantians, but\navailable to utilitarians too\u2014is that the law would need to\nengage in an impossible degree of mind-reading to pick up all and only\nthose cases of mens rea that deserve punishment irrespective\nof the outcomes. Even if this is the right thing to say about the law,\nthe answer cannot be transposed to the case of morality: morality\ncontrasts with the law precisely because it is supposed to apply even\nto the inner workings of the mind. Thus, morality presumably ought to\nbe just as severe on the attempted murderer and the reckless but lucky\nmotorist as it is on their less fortunate doubles.\n\nWilliams has a different answer to the puzzle why we blame people more\nwhen they are successful murderers, or not only reckless but lethal\nmotorists, despite the fact that they have no voluntary control over\ntheir success as murderers or their lethality as motorists. His answer\nis that\u2014despite what the morality system tells us\u2014our\npractice of blame is not in fact tied exclusively to voluntary\ncontrol. We blame people not only for what they have\nvoluntarily done, but also for what they have done as a\nmatter of luck: we might also say, of their moral luck.\nThe way we mostly think about these matters often does not distinguish\nthese two elements of control and luck at all clearly\u2014as is also\nwitnessed by the important possibility of blaming people for what they\nare. These phenomena, Williams argues, help to reveal the\nbasic unclarity of our notion of the voluntary; they also help to show\nhow \u201cwhat we think\u201d about blame is not always the same as\n\u201cwhat we think we think\u201d.\n\nParallel points apply with praise. Someone like the Gauguin of\nWilliams\u2019 story can be seen as taking a choice of the demands of\nart over the obligations of family life which will be praiseworthy or\nblameworthy depending on how it turns out (\u201cThe only\nthing that will justify his choice will be success itself\u201d,\n1981: 23). Here success or failure is quite beyond Gauguin\u2019s\nvoluntary control, and thus, if the morality system were right, would\nhave to be beyond the scope of praise and blame as well. A fault-line\nin our notions of praise and blame is revealed by the fact that,\nintuitively, it is not: the case where Gauguin tries and fails to be\nan artist is one where we condemn him \u201cfor making such a mess of\nhis and others\u2019 lives\u201d, the case where he tries and\nsucceeds is, very likely, one where we say, a little grudgingly\nperhaps, \u201cWell, all right then \u2014 well done.\u201d We have\nthe morality system\u2019s narrow or \u201cpure\u201d versions of\nthese notions, in which they apply only to (a narrow or\n\u201cpure\u201d version of) the voluntary; but we also have a wider\nversion of the notions of praise and blame, in which they also apply\nto many things that are not voluntary on any account of the voluntary.\nWilliams\u2019 thesis about moral luck is that the wider notions are\nmore useful, and truer to experience. (For a sustained defense of\nWilliams on these basic points, see Joseph Raz \u201cAgency and\nLuck\u201d)\n\nNor is it only praise and blame that are in this way less tightly\nconnected to conditions about voluntariness than the morality system\nmakes them seem. Beyond the notion of blame lie other, equally\nethically important, notions such as regret or even anguish at\none\u2019s actions; and these notions need not show any tight\nconnection with voluntariness either. As we saw in my shipwreck\nexample above, the mere fact that it was unreasonable to expect the\nship\u2019s officer to do much better than he did in his desperate\ncircumstances does not make it reasonable to fob off his anguish with\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought\u201d. Likewise, to use\nan example of Williams\u2019 own (1981: 28), if you were talking to a\ndriver who through no fault of his own had run over a child, there\nwould be something remarkably obtuse\u2014something irrelevant and\nsuperficial, even if correct\u2014about telling him that he\nshouldn\u2019t feel bad about it provided it wasn\u2019t\nhis fault. As the Greeks knew, such terrible happenings will leave\ntheir mark, their miasma, on the agent. \u201cThe whole of\nthe Oedipus Tyrannus, that dreadful machine, moves towards\nthe discovery of just one thing, that he did it. Do we\nunderstand the terror of that discovery only because we residually\nshare magical beliefs in blood-guilt, or archaic notions of\nresponsibility? Certainly not: we understand it because we know that\nin the story of one\u2019s life there is an authority exercised by\nwhat one has done, and not merely by what one has intentionally\ndone\u201d (1993: 69).\n\nThis sums up Williams\u2019 case for thinking that the wider notion\nof praise and blame is tenable in a way that the narrower notion is\nnot because of its dependence on a questionably \u201cpure\u201d\naccount of the voluntary (1985: 194; cp. MSH Essays 1\u20133). In\nthis way, he controverts the eighth thesis of the\nmorality system, its insistence on the centrality of blame; which was\nthe last thesis that we listed apart from impersonality, the\ndiscussion of which we have postponed till the next section.\n\nSo much on Williams\u2019 critique of the \u201cmorality\nsystem\u201d. How far our discussion has delivered on its promise to\nshow how Williams\u2019 positive views emerge from his negative\nprogrammes of argument, we leave, for now, to the reader\u2019s\njudgement: we shall say something more to bring the threads together\nin section 5. Before that, we turn to Williams\u2019 critique of\nutilitarianism, the view that actions, rules, dispositions, motives,\nsocial structures, (\u2026etc.: different versions of utilitarianism\nfeature, or stress, some or all of these things) are to be chosen if\nand only if they maximally promote utility or well-being.\n",
