    "main_text": "Ethics || A difficulty for moral theories\n5.1 A difficulty for moral theories\n\nUntil recently, problems of risk have not been treated systematically\nin moral philosophy. A possible defence of this limitation is that\nmoral philosophy can leave it to decision theory to analyse the\ncomplexities that indeterminism and lack of knowledge give rise to in\nreal life. According to the conventional division of labour between\nthe two disciplines, moral philosophy provides assessments of human\nbehaviour in well-determined situations. Decision theory takes\nassessments of these cases for given, adds the available probabilistic\ninformation, and derives assessments for rational behaviour in an\nuncertain and indeterministic world. On this view, no additional input\nof moral values is needed to deal with indeterminism or lack of\nknowledge, since decision theory operates exclusively with criteria of\nrationality. \n\nExamples are easily found that exhibit the problematic nature of this\ndivision between the two disciplines. Compare the act of throwing down\na brick on a person from a high building to the act of throwing down a\nbrick from a high building without first making sure that there is\nnobody beneath who can be hit by the brick. The moral difference\nbetween these two acts is not obviously expressible in a probability\ncalculus. An ethical analysis of the difference will have to refer to\nthe moral aspects of risk impositions as compared to intentional\nill-doing. More generally speaking, a reasonably complete account of\nthe ethics of risk must distinguish between intentional and\nunintentional risk exposure and between voluntary risk-taking, risks\nimposed on a person who accepts them, and risks imposed on a person\nwho does not accept them. This cannot be done in a framework that\ntreats risks as probabilistic mixtures of outcomes. In principle,\nthese outcomes can be so widely defined that they include all relevant\nmoral aspects, including rights infringements as well as\nintentionality and other pertinent mental states. However, this would\nstill not cover the moral implications of risk taking per se,\nsince these are not inherent properties of any of the potential\noutcomes. \n\nMethods of moral analysis are needed that can guide decisions on\nrisk-takings and risk impositions. A first step is to investigate how\nstandard moral theories can deal with problems of risk that are\npresented in the same way as in decision theory, namely as the (moral)\nevaluation of probabilistic mixtures of (deterministic) scenarios.\n",
