    "main_text": "Arguments for Fictionalism || Via eliminativist antirealism\n3.1 Via eliminativist antirealism\n\nOne historically important argument for fictionalism goes as follows.\nSuppose that we have an independent argument for what one may call\neliminativist antirealism about a particular discourse\n(whether it be mathematical discourse, or moral discourse,\nor\u2009\u2026\u2009.): an argument to the effect that the\natomic sentences of the discourse are all untrue, either because the\ncharacteristic objects of the discourse do not exist \u2014 there are\nno numbers \u2014 or because its characteristic predicates are\nuninstantiated \u2014 nothing is right, good, etc. This eliminativist\nantirealism threatens to convict ordinary speakers of massive,\nwidespread error. This is often regarded as a serious problem. It is\nhere that fictionalism comes to the rescue: if we suppose that the\nutterances in question are made in a fictional spirit, then\neliminativist antirealism about (say) mathematics does not commit\nordinary speakers of massive error.\n\nAs set out, this is an argument for hermeneutic fictionalism.\nRevolutionary fictionalism, aiming to secure a purpose that\nmathematical discourse can serve even if mathematical entities do not\nexist, would not avert the threat that the eliminativist antirealist\nwould have to say of ordinary speakers that they are in massive error.\nBut there is a nearby argument for revolutionary fictionalism. It goes\nlike this: Eliminativist antirealism threatens to come at a serious\ncost. If by the lights of our philosophy of mathematics there are no\nmathematical entities, it seems mathematical discourse must be\nabandoned (because mathematical utterances are systematically untrue):\nsuch discourse cannot be worthwhile. It is here that revolutionary\nfictionalism comes to the rescue: so long as there is some worthwhile\naim of mathematical discourse despite the nonexistence of mathematical\nentities, mathematical discourse need not be abandoned.\n\nConsider too some specific motivations for revolutionary fictionalism.\nFirst, Joyce (2005) on moral fictionalism. Joyce starts out from the\nassumption that, when taken literally, moral sentences are\nsystematically untrue, and seeks to show that it can still be\npractically useful to pretend that it is not so. Joyce asks first what\nthe benefits are of believing that some acts are morally right and\nothers morally wrong, and thinks that even when such a belief is\nfalse, it can be valuable: \u201cThe distinctive value of categorical\nimperatives is that they silence calculations. In this manner, moral\nbeliefs function to bolster self-control against practical\nirrationality\u201d (301). The basic idea is that for prudential\nreasons, essentially reasons such as those suggested by Hobbes and\nHume, one ought generally to act in accordance with alleged moral\nrequirements (\u201cthe fear of punishment, the desire for an ongoing\nbeneficial relationship, the motivation to maintain a good reputation,\nthe simple fact that one on the whole likes one\u2019s\nfellows,\u2026\u201d). But were it not for the moral beliefs one\nmight still be tempted by the short term gains from acting immorally.\nTurning to moral fictionalism, Joyce thinks that the make-believe that\nmoral properties are instantiated can have the same benefits as the\ngenuine belief that they are. In general, fictions can produce real\nemotions, which have motivational effects. Joyce remarks, \u201cHuman\nmotivation is often aroused more effectively by mental images than by\nmental calculation\u201d. Second, consider Field\u2019s (1980, 1989)\nrevolutionary fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics. On\nField\u2019s view the function of mathematics is to facilitate\ninferences from certain empirical, and nominalistically acceptable,\nstatements to others. A mathematical theory can perform this function\nso long as it is conservative, where a mathematical theory T\nis conservative if, roughly, for every nominalistic theory N,\nT+N has no consequences for the ontology of\nN that are not consequences of N alone. The\nimportant point is that a mathematical theory need not be true in\norder to be useful in this way. In both these cases, the supposed\nlesson from the considerations adduced is that pretense would serve us\nas well as real belief or real assertion.\n\nThis first argument for fictionalism is only an indirect argument for\nthe view. It says only that if we have reason to embrace eliminativist\nantirealism about some discourse, then fictionalism about D\nshould also be attractive. The argument does not even purport to\naddress the intrinsic merits of fictionalism. \n",
