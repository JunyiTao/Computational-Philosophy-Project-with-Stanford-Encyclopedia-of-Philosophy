This realism is continued in\nthe Communia naturalium [OHI, 2\u20134] but with certain\nimportant qualifications. This polemical account of the discussion of\nAristotle in the 1260s is understood by Bacon as an aid for the study\nof theology. And now, it is clear that for Bacon, in the intention and\nexecution of nature, the individual has definite ontological\npriority over genera and species. His account becomes an attack\non contemporary positions influenced by Albertus Magnus that would\nsubordinate the individual to the universal. Species and genera are\nthere for the sake of the production of the individual. He states,\n\u201cIn no other field are the authorities in such\ndisagreement.\u201d Even Aristotle seems to contradict himself. Bacon\nfinds a correct answer in the Metaphysics of Avicenna:\n\n\nThere are two kinds of nature, universal and particular, Avicenna\nteaches in the sixth book of [his] Metaphysics.\n\n\nBacon adds,\n\n\nUniversal [nature] is the governing force of the universe [and is]\ndiffused among the substances of the heavens [and] throughout all the\nbodies in the world; it is [that] in which all bodies agree and\nthrough which all are maintained at a certain general level of\nperfection and well being. This universal nature is the corporeal\nnature that is designated in the second genus, which is [that of]\nbody, and this nature excludes all incompatible things which are\nabhorrent to the whole universe, such as a vacuum. ([OHI, II], 92 =\nTTUM, 85\u201386) \n\n\nWe see then that Bacon understands universal nature as supervening on\na world of distinct individual natures such that corporeal action is\ncontiguous and that a vacuum is excluded. The \u201cparticular\nnature\u201d is the directing power of the species with its\nindividuals, and is divisible into the directive power of the species\nand of the individual. The example he gives is from embryology: there\nis the directing power of the species intending the production of the\nhuman in general; it intends the production of the individual\naccidentally. And there is the directing power of the individual,\nwhich aims at the determinate individual human as such and mankind in\ngeneral. As he puts it, \u201cthe universal is prior to the\nparticular in [both] the work and execution of nature, but is\nposterior in intent\u201d ([OHI,II], 93 = TTUM, 87). He then states\nthe ontological priority of the individual over universals as\nfollows:\n\n\nBut if we would speak about the universal nature that is the directing\npower of the universe, [we should say that] it intends and brings\nabout an individual first and principally, about which there\nis mention in the Book of the Six Principles. Nature operates\nin a hidden manner in things: once a determinate man is generated, man\nas such is generated. And the cause of this is that one individual\nexcels all universals in the world, for a universal is nothing but the\nagreement of many individuals. ([OHI,II], 94, = TTUM, 86)\n\n\nHe distinguishes the absolute nature of an individual as\nsomething absolute, that is, \u201cthat which constitutes it and\nenters its essence.\u201d This absolute nature of an individual is\nontologically more important than that by which one individual has\nsome agreement with another. One can notice that Bacon is now writing\nas a person with a theological interest: \u201cAnd because all the\nthings which I am treating are for the sake of theology, it is clear\nthrough theological reasons that a universal is not [favorably]\ncompared to singulars. For God did not make this world for the sake of\nuniversal man, but for singular persons\u2026Therefore, speaking\nplainly and absolutely, we must say that an individual is prior in\nnature [to a universal] both in operation and in intent,\u201d and so\n\u201c\u2026it is necessary that the ranking according to prior and\nposterior be denominated absolutely and simply from the governing\npower of an individual\u2026\u201d ([OHI,II], 94\u201395 = TTUM,\n88\u201389). Bacon knows that he is defending a position in rank\nopposition to the common view: \u201cSince the whole rabble [at\nParis] holds the contrary position, because of certain authorities,\nthe views of the latter must be presented\u201d ([OHI,II], 96 =TTUM,\n90).\n\nThis account has given rise to opposing interpretations. Theodore\nCrowley (1950) saw in these passages the beginnings of late medieval\nnominalism that would find its expression in William of Ockham. Thomas\nS. Maloney (1985) challenged this reading and argued that the later\nRoger Bacon, like the earlier Bacon, was not a nominalist but an\nextreme realist. More recently, Chiara Chrisciani has argued that\nalready in 1964, Camile Berube saw Bacon as the originator of the\nFranciscan doctrine of the direct intellectual perception of the\nsingular. He also noted the link between Bacon and William of Ockham\neven though the path of influence was long and complex. She also\ncorrectly noted that for Bacon, we have a sense-perception of\nuniversals, one quite different from his contemporaries. Following K.\nTachau and Y. Raizman-Kedar, Crisciani argues that the universals are\nmaterially embodied in the intellect. In a recent study, while\nagreeing with this position with respect to the material intellect, I\nargued that it needed qualification. Perhaps we should hold that there\nare elements of both \u2018extreme-realism\u2019 and\nproto-nominalism in this account in the Communia naturalium. In\nhis important essay on individuation in the fourteenth century, Jorge\nJ.E. Gracia (1991) argues for seeing this text and others as the\nbeginning of the strict tradition of late medieval nominalism.\n",
