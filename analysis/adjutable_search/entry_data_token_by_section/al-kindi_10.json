    "main_text": "Science || The use of mathematics\n5.1 The use of mathematics\n\n\nDespite the anti-empiricist character of al-Kindi\u2019s epistemology noted\nabove, he devoted enormous energy to various branches of the physical\nsciences. Particularly well represented in the extant corpus are his\nwork on optics and medicine, especially the compounding of drugs (for\noptics see Rashed 1997; for medicine see Gauthier 1939, Klein-Franke\n1975, Celentano 1979; for these aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s thought\ngenerally see Adamson 2007, ch.7). What is characteristic about\nal-Kindi\u2019s approach to such topics is the use of mathematics. It has\nbeen persuasively argued that mathematics was fundamental to\nal-Kindi\u2019s own philosophical method (Gutas 2004, cf. Endress 2003); a\ngood example is his mathematical approach to Aristotle\u2019s categories,\nwhich makes quantity and quality fundamental for Aristotelian logic\n(Ighbariah 2012). Certainly he missed no opportunity to apply\nmathematical techniques to what we would now think of as\n\u201cscientific\u201d topics. In addition, he wrote numerous works\non music (edited in Zakariyya\u2019 1962), which for the ancients and\nal-Kindi himself was a branch of the mathematical sciences. He also\nwrote extensively on more recognizably mathematical topics, as is\nattested by the Fihrist, though again much of this material\nis lost.\n\n\nA good example of how al-Kindi applied mathematics to other fields\nis his use of geometry in optics (see further Lindberg 1971, Rashed\n1997, Adamson 2006). On this subject al-Kindi followed the tradition\ninaugurated by Euclid, and carried on by Ptolemy and others, in which\ngeometrical constructions were used to explain phenomena such as visual\nperspective, shadows, refraction, reflection, and burning mirrors. This\nprocedure implies that light and vision can be formalized as\ngeometrical lines, an implication that al-Kindi and his sources embrace\nby claiming that vision occurs when \u201crays\u201d emitted from the\neyes along straight lines strike a visual object. Likewise, objects are\nilluminated when a light source emits light rays that strike the\nobjects\u2019 surfaces. Aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s account anticipate\nthat of Ibn al-Haytham, who some decades later would be the first to\nexplain vision accurately.\n\n\nNow, this account based on \u201crays\u201d also seems to underlie\nal-Kindi\u2019s most ambitious work on the physical sciences: a\nlengthy treatise entitled On Rays (de Radiis, for\nwhich see D\u2019Alverny and Hudry 1974) and preserved only in Latin.\nThere is some question as to its authenticity, but it seems plausible\nthat On Rays represents al-Kindi\u2019s attempt to explain\nall physical interaction \u2013 from heating and cooling, to vision,\nto astral influence, to magical incantations \u2013 in terms of a\nfundamentally geometrical mechanism. (For connections to the optical\nworks, see Travaglia 1999.)\n",
