    "main_text": "Teleology\n7. Teleology\n\nMany commentators on the Timaeus have pointed out that the\nteleological account set out in the Timaeus is the\nfulfillment of a quest for teleological explanations related in the\nPhaedo (see, e.g., Strange 1999). In that dialogue the\ncharacter Socrates describes his foray into causal questions in the\nrealm of natural science and recounts both his high expectations of\nand disappointment with Anaxagoras\u2019 concept of Intellect\n(nous) as providing the true cause of natural phenomena.\nSocrates expected the use Anaxagoras made of Intellect to provide\nteleological explanations; instead, Anaxagoras employed the concept to\nprovide the same sort of causal explanation\u2014in terms of physical\ninteractions\u2014that Socrates had found confusing. Continuing to\nhope for teleological causal explanations but finding them elusive,\nSocrates settles for a second best account: offering causal\nexplanations in terms of participation in Forms (Phaedo 99c6\nff.).\n\nIt is not entirely clear by what avenue of reasoning Plato found what\nhis character Socrates failed to find in the Phaedo, but it\nis reasonable to assume that the role of the form of the Good,\nintroduced in the Republic, assisted in the discovery.\nAlthough the character Socrates in that dialogue declines to offer an\naccount of the nature of the Good, it is not unreasonable to connect\nthat form, as some have done, with rational, mathematical\n order.[18]\n Such order as the expression of goodness is arguably for Plato the\nultimate metaphysical datum; forms other than the Good are good in so\nfar as they possess such intelligible order, and they do so perfectly.\nSensibles are good in so far as they participate in these forms,\nthough they fail to do so completely. What is left to be explained,\nthen, is how such order is manifested in the visible universe, however\nimperfectly. The explanation offered in the Timaeus is that\norder is not inherent in the spatio-material universe; it is imposed\nby Intellect, as represented by the Craftsman.\n\nWhile the figure of the Craftsman seems to be an anthropomorphic\nrepresentation of\n Intellect,[19]\n it remains to ask what the ontological status of Intellect is, in\nrelation to the division between being and becoming\u2014a\ndistinction that appears to be exhaustive. Some interpreters, relying\non Timaeus\u2019 claim (at 30b3) that intellect cannot become present\nto anything apart from soul, have argued that Intellect is (part of)\nthe world\u2019s\n soul.[20]\n This cannot be correct: like the rest of becoming, the world\u2019s\nsoul is a product of the Craftsman, and hence neither it nor anything\nelse on the side of becoming can be identified with Intellect.\nAlternatively, either Intellect is a form, or the distinction between\nbeing and becoming is not exhaustive. Some have argued that Intellect\nis to be identified with the entire realm of\n forms,[21]\n or the form of the\n Good,[22]\n while others, understanding \u201cnous\u201d to name a\nvirtue, have opted for the form of Intelligence (a substance in virtue\nof its status as a\n form).[23]\n More recently, it has been suggested that the figure of the Craftsman\nis a personification of\n craftsmanship.[24]\n None of these accounts seem adequate either: if Intellect were a form\nof any kind, it would be an intelligible object, not a subject that\npossesses cognition and efficient causal\n agency.[25]\n Intellect, then, cannot be placed either on the side of being or on\nthat of becoming, and that dichotomy is thus not\n exhaustive.[26]\n It is reasonable to conclude that Intellect is a sui generis\nsubstance that transcends the metaphysical dichotomy of being and\nbecoming\u2014possibly not unlike the Abrahamic conception of\n God.[27]\n\nThe teleology of the Timaeus may be usefully compared to that\nof Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature. What is immediately\nstriking in that comparison is the absence from Aristotle\u2019s\nnatural philosophy of a purposive, designing causal agent that\ntranscends nature. Aristotelian final causes in the formation of\norganisms and the structures of the natural world are said to be\nimmanent in nature (i.e., the nature or \u201cform\u201d of the\norganism or structure) itself: it is not a divine Craftsman but nature\nitself that is said to act\n purposively.[28]\n Such an immanent teleology will not be an option for Plato.\nAristotle\u2019s teleology is local, with no more than a few hints at\na global level : while it makes sense to ask Aristotle for a\nteleological explanation of this or that feature of the natural world,\nit makes little sense to ask him for a teleological explanation of the\nworld as a whole. Moreover, for Aristotle the development of an\nindividual member of a species is determined by the form it has\ninherited from its (male) parent: the goal of the developing\nindividual is to fully actualize that form. For Plato the primeval\nchaotic stuff of the universe has no inherent preexisting form that\ngoverns some course of natural development toward the achievement of\nsome goal, and so the explanatory cause of its orderliness must be\nexternal to any features that such stuff may possess.\n",
