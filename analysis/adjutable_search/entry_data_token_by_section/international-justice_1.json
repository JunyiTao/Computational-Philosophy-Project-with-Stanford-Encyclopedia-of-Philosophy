Justice and Particularity\n\nThe trend towards greater and more sophisticated theorizing about\ninternational justice was both exemplified and encouraged by the\npublication of Rawls\u2019 The Law of Peoples. This\nwork\u2014an extensive elaboration and revision of an earlier essay\n(Rawls 1993b)\u2014discusses and, has influenced the subsequent\ndiscussion of, a variety of issues of international and global import,\nincluding and especially the obligations of distributive justice in\nthe international realm. Before we turn to Rawls\u2019s account of\ninternational distributive justice, we should acknowledge some salient\nfeatures of how he conceives of his project. Rawls\u2019 perspective\nis unabashedly international rather than global.\nUnlike the early cosmopolitans who conceive of the world as a single\ncooperative unit and seek a single principle of distributive justice\nto govern everyone, Rawls explicitly seeks principles that will\nregulate the interactions among territorially defined political,\ncorporate agents that have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force,\ncalled peoples\u2014and, only indirectly, govern individuals\n(Rawls 1999a: 6).\n\nSecond, and partly as a consequence of this conceptualization of\ninternational justice, Rawls does not attempt to derive complete\nprinciples of international and global justice. Rather, he describes\nprinciples that ought to regulate the foreign policy of a liberal\npeople (Rawls 1999a: 9\u201310). Thus, when Rawls says, for example,\nthat some non-democratic peoples are sufficiently well-ordered to be\nworthy of full membership in the society of peoples, he is arguing\nthat democratic peoples may not use political power or pressure to\nchange them\u2014not that non-democratic but well-ordered peoples are\nideal or beyond moral criticism. Furthermore, he argues that the ideal\ncase of international justice is a world composed entirely of\nwell-ordered peoples whose interactions are governed by a set of moral\nprinciples. The account is then extended to cover various non-ideal\ncases: societies burdened by poverty and failing institutions or rogue\nstates that wage aggressive war. What constitutes a minimally just or\nwell-ordered people is a matter of immense controversy, but the\nbroader conceptual point is unchanged: Rawls conceives of\ninternational justice as being ideally about the interactions of\nmorally justified, centralized territorial polities.\n\nThird, his account of the law of peoples is constrained by the need\nthat it describe a \u201crealistic utopia\u201d (Rawls 1999a:\n11\u201312) that follows Rousseau\u2019s dictum to take\n\u201cpeople as they are and laws as they might be\u201d. As a\nconsequence, there are at least three distinct instances where Rawls\nappeals to empirical facts as a way of \u201crealistically\u201d\ngrounding particular normative claims. First, an international system\ncomposed of well-ordered peoples with representative governments will\nbe peaceful (1999a: 44\u201354); second, issues beginning with\ncultural diversity, geographic distance, and linguistic pluralism\ncombine to make a world state fundamentally unworkable (1999a: 36);\nand, lastly, the primary causal component of national wealth and\nprosperity is the political culture and the corresponding\neffectiveness of their political institutions (1999a:\n108\u2013110).\n\nWith the above normative and descriptive picture in view, Rawls\npresents a provisional list of principles that peoples could\nreasonably endorse:\n\n Peoples are free and independent, and their freedom and\nindependence are to be respected by other peoples.\n Peoples are to observe treaties and undertakings.\n Peoples are equal and are parties to the agreements that bind\nthem.\n Peoples are to observe a duty of non-intervention.\n Peoples have the right of self-defense but no right to instigate\nwar for reasons other than self-defense.\n Peoples are to honor human rights.\n Peoples are to observe certain specified restrictions in the\nconduct of war.\n Peoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under\nunfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent\npolitical and social regime. (Rawls 1999a: 37)\n\n\nNotably absent from this list is the difference principle or anything\nlike it. When deciding on these principles, peoples do not know how\nbig, rich, prosperous, or powerful they will be. Yet, unlike\nindividuals in the first original position, the peoples represented in\nthis international original position will not demand that material\ninequalities among them be justified with reference to the\nexpectations of the least well-off. The peoples in the second original\nposition know that they have sufficient resources to be well-ordered,\nand they need no more. So, in the ideal case, where international\nsociety is fully composed of well-ordered states that follow the law\nof peoples, there are no distributive requirements at all. Some\npeoples may be very rich and others quite poor and, correspondingly,\nthere could be large differences in wealth among individuals of\ndifferent countries, but there is no principled reason\u2014on\nRawls\u2019 view\u2014to find that objectionable.\n\nThe Law of Peoples does include some elements that constrain\ninequality\u2014or, at least, poverty. We shall mention three. First,\ninequalities that undermine the instantiation, enforcement, and\nmaintenance of other principles will violate the Law of\nPeoples:\n\n\nThe Law of Peoples, on the other hand, holds that inequalities are not\nalways unjust, and that when they are, it is because of their unjust\neffects on the basic structure of the Society of Peoples, and on\nrelations among peoples and among their members. (Rawls 1999a:\n113)\n\n\nThus, if one could show that a deep material inequality among peoples\nundermined their ability to, say, be considered equals in the\nnegotiation of treaties or tempted peoples to inappropriately\nintervene in the domestic affairs of other peoples, then that would be\na reason\u2014from the standpoint of international justice\u2014for\neliminating that inequality. However, this principle must be moderated\nin light of Rawls suggestions that both poor and rich well-ordered\npeoples will be \u201csatisfied\u201d with their political and\neconomic position within the Society of Peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n27\u201330), and that the most important determinant of wealth is the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people. Well-ordered\npeoples\u2014rich or poor\u2014will generally act according to the\nprinciples that make up the law of peoples and even poor peoples will\nhave fairly strong political institutions, so Rawls would argue that\nit is unlikely that mere inequality will be a problem among\nwell-ordered states.\n\nSecond, all members of the Society of Peoples must respect human\nrights that guarantee that every person, regardless of society, a\nminimum level of material prosperity and physical security, though\nthis minimum level will fall far short of distributive equality (Rawls\n1999a: 65).\n\nThird, Rawls writes:\n\n\nBurdened societies, while they are not expansive or aggressive, lack\nthe political and cultural traditions, the human capital and know-how,\nand, often, the material and technological resources needed to be\nwell-ordered. The long term goal of (relatively) well-ordered\nsocieties should be to bring burdened societies, like outlaw states,\ninto the Society of well-ordered Peoples. Well-ordered peoples have a\nduty to assist burdened societies. (Rawls 1999a: 106)\n\n\nSome societies are sufficiently poor or have sufficiently weak\ninstitutions that they are unable to become and remain well-ordered on\ntheir own. In those cases, the Society of Peoples must produce the\nmaterial, human, and institutional support to help these burdened\nsocieties become minimally just. This could very well include some\nwealth transfers from richer nations to burdened ones, but Rawls is\nskeptical that this will be the primary tool of assistance.\n\nIt is important to see that the duty of assistance to burdened\nsocieties is structurally dissimilar to the difference principle.\nFirst, the difference principle is meant to continuously apply, via\nthe basic structure, to the flow of social and economic interactions,\nbut the duty of assistance has a target and a cutoff point: once all\nsocieties are well-ordered, no people has any further obligation to\ndistribute resources to burdened nations. Second, while the difference\nprinciple is explicitly about the distribution of primary goods, the\nduty of assistance might, in the end, have very little to do with\nactual wealth; burdened societies might be quite wealthy in terms of\nresources, but have failing or deeply embedded non well-ordered\ninstitutions while well-ordered nations may be quite poor.\nFurthermore, when confronted with consistently failing institutions,\nwell-ordered peoples might conceivably discharge their obligations as\nmuch through the provision of technical know-how, information, and\ninstitutional assistance\u2014rather than through than financial\nsupport.\n\nRawls thus argues for a two-tiered theory of distributive justice. The\nrespect for the free and equal status of each citizen in domestic\ncontext demands an egalitarian distribution of primary goods, but\nequality in the international context requires that each person find\nthemselves in a well-ordered people and that those peoples are\nrespected within international society. Economic inequalities are\ninherently problematic\u2014and require justification\u2014at the\ndomestic level but not at the international. In other words, the\ndistributive outcomes of international trade and the global economy\nare only indirectly relevant to international justice.\n\nBut why this strong distinction between domestic and international?\nRawls\u2019s response has several themes. First, Rawls suggests that\nlimitations on distributive justice are a consequence of tolerating\nand respecting the economic decisions of peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n117\u2013118). Insofar as peoples are well-ordered, they have made\ndecisions about savings rates, education, and population policy that\nessentially determine national prosperity, and it would be\ndisrespectful of the decisions made by richer and poorer\nnations\u2014who presumably adopted these policies for what they took\nto be good reasons\u2014to require one people to compensate another.\nThis argument is especially controversial because Rawls argues that\nnon-democratic \u201cdecent consultation hierarchies\u201d are\nwell-ordered and ought to be accepted into the ranks of the Society of\nPeoples (Rawls 1999a: 62\u201378). This leaves open the possibility\nthat individuals will become impoverished as a consequence of public\npolicies and choices that they had no hand in deciding. Kok Chor Tan,\nfor example, has argued that Rawls has improperly stretched his\nargument for toleration of reasonable, but illiberal, comprehensive\ndoctrines within a generally liberal political culture into an\nargument for respecting illiberal political cultures (Tan 1998).\n\nRawls further seems to suggest that the \u201cbasic structure\u201d\nof international realm is quite different from the basic structure of\nthe domestic state. In the domestic case, the basic structure is\ncomposed of powerful and effective institutions to which the\nprinciples of justice apply. In the international\ncase, Rawls suggests that the basic structure simply is the\nprinciples by which well-ordered peoples govern themselves\u2014there\nare no institutions distinct from the acts and decisions of the\npeoples themselves. In other words, the interactions among peoples are\nnot\u2014and need not be\u2014regulated by a robust set of\npolitical, economic, and social institutions that would constitute an\nindependent basic structure. As a consequence of this lack of an\ninternational basic structure, Rawls argues that the moral objections\nto inequality in the domestic case do not apply (Rawls 1999a:\n114\u2013115). Inequality among individuals of different peoples does\nnot, for example, undermine the fair value of the political liberties\nor fair equality of opportunity, since they are not co-members of\neconomic and political systems, and peoples will treat other peoples\nas equals insofar as they are well-ordered and reasonable. Since the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people are primary cause of\nwealth and its distribution, the criterion of reciprocity does not\ndemand equal distributive shares among members of different\npolities.\n\nRawls\u2019s arguments should not be taken as a defense of the status\nquo in international relations. Many states\u2014especially\nauthoritarian, weak, and failing ones\u2014are not well-ordered, and\nthe principles informing current foreign policies are not those\ndescribed in the The Law of Peoples. Neither Rawls nor his\ncritics would defend the justice of the world today. The theoretical\ndifference between these perspectives, though, is profound. The real\npoint of dispute between them is this: once well-ordered nations have\nensured that every person lives in a well-ordered state and are\nthereby guaranteed certain minimum protections against starvation and\npoverty, does the international order represent a basic structure of\nthe right type, and robustness, so that the fact that some peoples are\nmuch wealthier than others ought to be considered an affront to\njustice? Rawls himself will answer in the negative, while his critics\nwill answer in the affirmative.\n",
