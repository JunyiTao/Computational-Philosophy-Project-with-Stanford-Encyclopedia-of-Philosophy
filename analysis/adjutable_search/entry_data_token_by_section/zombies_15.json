But that\nwas true once of the idea that the earth stands still, and is true now\nof the idea that science can explain events without appealing to\nanything nonphysical. Some anti-physicalists believe their\nopponents\u2019 commitment makes them turn a blind eye to the\ndifficulties:\n\nSome may be led to deny the possibility [of zombies] in order to make\nsome theory come out right, but the justification of such theories\nshould ride on the question of possibility, rather than the other way\nround (Chalmers 1996, 96).\n\n\nOn the other hand, some physicalists believe the zombie idea exerts an\nirrational grip on anti-physicalist thinking, so that\n\nit is tempting to regard anti-physicalist arguments as\nrationalizations of an intuition whose independent force masks their\ntendentiousness (Loar 1990/1997, 598).\n\n\nIn spite of the fact that the arguments on both sides have become\nincreasingly sophisticated \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014\nthey have not become more persuasive. The pull in each direction\nremains strong.\n",
