    "main_text": "Reception and influence\n7.1 Influence on general occidental philosophy\n\n\nCrescas is not a part of the very limited group of medieval Jewish\nphilosophers whose major philosophical works have been translated into\nLatin (in particular Maimonides, Rabbi Isaac Israeli, and Rabbi Shlomo\nIbn Gabirol). The non-Jewish occidental philosopher had no possibility\nof direct access to any of his works until the very recent translation\nof Or Hashem into French. Despite this fact, his philosophical opinions\ninfluenced occidental philosophy, especially through their adoption by\ntwo important authors: Pico della Mirandola and Spinoza. Pico\ntranslated some of Crescas\u2019s critiques on Aristotelian science in\nhis book Examen Vanitas Doctrinae Gentium, and it is possible\nthat Crescas may have influenced some of the Italian\nphilosopher\u2019s other opinions as well. The main influence of\nCrescas on general occidental philosophy is undoubtedly via his\ninfluence on Spinoza. Spinoza, himself Jewish, probably studied Or\nHashem as a young student, for Crescas\u2019s book had a profound\ninfluence on his opinions. Indeed, Crescas is one the few medieval\nphilosophers that Spinoza quotes with\n sympathy.[33]\nThere is some controversy among Spinoza scholars\nregarding the subject of the influence of Jewish thought on Spinoza\u2019s\nopinions, but it is very probable that Crescas had a significant\ninfluence on at least two of his most important views: the essence of\nGod and determinism. We can conclude that in spite of the lack of\ndirect influence, Crescas definitely had an important indirect\ninfluence on occidental philosophy, especially via his influence on\nSpinoza.\n",
