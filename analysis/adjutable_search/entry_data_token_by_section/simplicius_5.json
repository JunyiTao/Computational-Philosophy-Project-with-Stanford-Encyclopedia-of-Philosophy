The Harmony of Plato and Aristotle and Christian Threads\n\n\n[The good exegete] must, I believe, not convict the philosophers of\ndiscordance (diaph\u00f4nia) by looking only at the letter\n(lexis) of what [Aristotle] says against Plato; but he must\nlook towards the spirit (nous), and track down\n(anikhneuein) the harmony (sumph\u00f4nia) which\nreigns between them on the majority of points. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 7.29\u201332, translated by M. Chase)\n\n\nThis programmatic statement from the introductory section to the\nCommentary on the Categories shows that the harmony of Plato\nand Aristotle was one of Simplicius\u2019 top priorities as a\ncommentator. As mentioned earlier, the ancient notion of harmony\n(sumph\u00f4nia) did not entail a strict identity of\nphilosophical views. Rather, it referred to positions that are\nreconcilable, compatible, or even complementary:\n\n\nThe text of the two philosophers can be in accord by being\ncomplementary in a unified system, which is quite different from their\nbeing in accord as to the very ideas they contain. (Golitsis 2018:\n72)\n\n\nNeoplatonists frequently characterised Aristotle as the secretary of\nnature, as it were, while Plato was the metaphysician par excellence\n(cf. Raphael\u2019s \u201cThe School of Athens\u201d). Each had his\nown peculiar domain and his peculiar philosophical attitude, but one\ncould nevertheless speak of a harmony between the two approaches:\n\n\n[Aristotle] always refuses to deviate from nature; on the contrary, he\nconsiders even things which are above nature according to their\nrelation to nature, just as, by contrast, the divine Plato, according\nto Pythagorean usage, examines even natural things insofar as they\nparticipate in the things above nature. (Simplicius, In Cat.\n6.27\u201330, translated by M. Chase)\n\nOne ought to know that Aristotle is always doing natural philosophy\nwhen he does theology, while Plato is always doing theology when he\ndoes natural philosophy. (Elias/David, In Cat.\n120.30\u2013121.4)\n\nHowever, I think that one should also attend to the purpose\n(skopos) as well as at the words and recognise that the\ndifference (diaphora) between the two philosophers on these\nquestions is not about things (pragmata) but about words:\nPlato rejects the ordinary use of words (sun\u00eatheia) in\nthe name of precision, but Aristotle makes use of the ordinary use of\nwords on the grounds that the truth is not at all harmed by this.\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 69.11\u201315, translated by I.\nMueller)\n\nHere, therefore, the difference (diaphora) between the\nphilosophers is not over a reality (pragma), but over a name\n(onoma), as it is in most cases. I think the reason often is\nthat Aristotle wishes to preserve linguistic usage and carries out his\narguments on the basis of what is evident to the senses, while Plato\noften scorns them and readily resorts to intellective theories.\n(Simplicius, In Phys. 1249.12\u201317, translated by I.\nBodn\u00e1r, M. Chase, and M. Share; cf. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius,\nIn de Anima 28.12\u201313)\n\n\nCertainly, one may wonder whether such a program does justice to\neither Plato or Aristotle, although this issue is not relevant to the\npresent discussion of Simplicius. Within the framework of Late\nNeoplatonism, it seems advisable to distinguish Simplicius from\nSyrianus and Proclus, since both of the latter are much more explicit\nand polemical when it comes to reprimanding Aristotle for his\ncriticism of Plato. On the other hand, while it is true that\nSimplicius makes a great effort to reconcile the two philosophers,\nsuch a rapprochement could also be considered a Platonisation of\nAristotle and a stealthy neutralisation of his at times anti-Platonic\nline of reasoning.\n\nBe that as it may, it is nevertheless clear that there is a rich\npedigree in the history of the Platonic tradition regarding\nharmonisation. Simplicius continues and extends a program that was\ninaugurated by his teacher Ammonius, and also before him by Porphyry,\nand it was afterwards continued in Alexandria by Hierocles and\nOlympiodorus, more or less along the same lines as Simplicius.\nKaramanolis (2018: 36) argues convincingly that Porphyry (and before\nhim some Middle Platonists) had already considered Aristotle a crucial\npart of the Platonic tradition:\n\n\n[\u2026] Porphyry wrote commentaries on works of Aristotle because\nhe found these works to represent an elaboration on, and a development\nof, Plato\u2019s philosophy. [\u2026] What Porphyry does deny is\nthat Aristotle contradicts the essence of Plato\u2019s philosophical\nviews when he articulates theories that are not in Plato, since these\nmay be inspired from Plato or continue in some way Plato\u2019s\nthinking on a given issue.\n\n\nScholars have remarked that Simplicius\u2019 eagerness to harmonise\nPlato and Aristotle should be seen in the context of the\nNeoplatonist\u2019s anti-Christian attitude and especially his\npolemics against the Christian Platonist John Philoponus (Hoffmann\n2014: 286). After Christianity became the official state religion (in\n380 CE), it was ever more difficult for pagan philosophers to teach\nand practice their cultic rituals. This development culminated in the\nfamous edict of 529, commonly referred to as the closing of the\nPlatonic Academy (see\n \u00a71).\n One of the main criticisms, made as early as the first Christian\napologist Tertullian, was that Greek philosophers and their schools\nwould constantly contradict each other, so that it was impossible to\nspeak of a unified intellectual tradition or heritage. In this\nrespect, John Philoponus was particularly dangerous in criticising the\nHellenic tradition from within, and with an excellent knowledge of all\nof the relevant texts. If all of this weren\u2019t bad enough, the\nChristian Platonist from Alexandria openly countered efforts toward\nharmonisation. Being a fervent champion of the creation of the world\nin time (according to the Christian creed), Philoponus argues that one\nof the most common arguments of the harmonisers\u2014that Aristotle\nwould only criticise the apparent meaning of Plato\u2019s\nwords\u2014is not valid. He even refers to it as a fiction\n(muthos), adding that if it were true, Aristotle would have\nsaid so explicitly:\n\n\nFrom these passages we can most certainly see that Aristotle\u2019s\nrefutations of Plato are not directed at people who have wrongly\nunderstood Plato, which is a fiction created by some more recent\ncommentators out of embarrassment at the disagreement between the\n<two> philosophers, but rather constitute a rebuttal of the\nnotions of Plato himself. For, if Aristotle had not been attacking\nPlato\u2019s own doctrine of the Forms but, as these commentators\nclaim, that of people who have misunderstood him, he would have\nspecified precisely this at the outset and not have refuted the\ndoctrine of the Forms generally and without qualification.\n(Philoponus, De aet. Mundi 29.2\u201313, translated by P.\nGolitsis 2018: 73)\n\n\nSimplicius\u2019 polemics with Philoponus in his commentaries on the\nPhysics and De Caelo will be examined in more detail\nbelow.\n\nAmmonius, pupil of Proclus was also an important predecessor for\nSimplicius. Ammonius taught in Alexandria (around the second half of\nthe fifth century) and famously argued that Aristotle\u2019s Unmoved\nMover is both a final and an efficient cause (Simplicius, In\nCael. 271.13\u201321 and In Phys.\n1360.24\u20131363.24). Such a reading of Aristotle, which Proclus\nstill firmly opposes (In Parm. IV 842.20\u201327 [Steel],\nwhere he calls the Unmoved Mover agonos, i.e., not productive\nor infertile; see also Tempelis 1998: 134 n. 609), was an important\nstep in combining the demiurge in Plato\u2019s Timaeus with\nAristotle\u2019s self-thinking intellect (Metaphysics Lambda\n6\u20137). Simplicius welcomes Ammonius\u2019 innovation and, not\nsurprisingly, refers to him with great approval (see In Phys.\n1362.11\u201316 and Golitsis 2017a).\n\nBut it should not be forgotten that there were also other threads to\nSimplicius\u2019 approach of harmonising the Hellenic tradition and\nespecially of integrating Aristotle. At In Cael.\n297.1\u20136, he mentions some interpreters (tines) who\nbetrayed a hostile attitude towards Aristotle. It is likely that he\nmainly had Syrianus and Proclus in mind. Simplicius had to deal with\nsuch criticism with much more delicacy than the criticism coming from\nPhiloponus. There is a telling passage in In Cael.\n640.20\u201331, where Simplicius explains that Proclus has refuted\nAristotle\u2019s criticism of Plato in the De caelo in a\nspecial monograph (now lost; see Steel 2005 and Luna, Segonds, and\nEndress 2012: 1591\u20131596) in order to immediately remark that the\ncriticism was only apparent.\n\nWhat are the different strategies Simplicius uses to harmonise Plato\nand Aristotle or to integrate the Presocratics and even earlier\ntraditions (Chaldeans, Orphics) into the Platonic tradition? In\nPlatonic Theology I 4, Proclus discusses at length an\nexegetical device that seems to be comparable to the doctrine of the\n\u201cfour senses of scripture\u201d (quattuor sensus sacrae\nscripturae), well known from biblical exegesis. According to\nProclus, different hermeneutical methods may be applied to different\ntexts, depending on the mode of their composition. From the\nperspective of the Neoplatonists, different authors or even schools of\nthought had different ways of expressing themselves; this applied\nmainly to traditions that were active or alleged to be active before\nSocrates and Plato: the Chaldeans, the Orphics, Homer (and Hesiod),\nthe Presocratics (esp. Parmenides and Pythagoras, including the\nPseudo-Pythagorean tradition)\u2014but also to Plato and Aristotle.\nTexts could be written \u201cin riddles\u201d, \u201cas\nmyths\u201d, \u201cin symbols\u201d, or \u201cin images\u201d,\nand they could be \u201cinspired\u201d or \u201cdialectical\u201d.\nAt times, this entailed that these texts needed to be translated or\ndecoded in order to serve in philosophical debates. It goes without\nsaying that such presuppositions also granted a certain kind of\nexegetical freedom to the interpreters. Plato himself, Proclus\nexplains, betrays at least four modes of expressing himself in\ndifferent dialogues, while Aristotle was often considered to\nintentionally write in an obscure way for members of his school.\nMoreover, while Plato, according to Simplicius, \u201crejects the\nordinary use of words in the name of precision\u201d, Aristotle\n\u201cmakes use of the ordinary use\u201d (Simplicius, In\nCael. 69.11\u201315).\n\nIt is against this background that Simplicius\u2019 attempt to\nharmonise the Greek tradition should be interpreted. Compared to\nProclus, Simplicius\u2019 approach is less complex, and it is, in\nfact, rather similar in principle. Regarding the Presocratics,\nSimplicius remarks that they frequently speak in riddles\n(ainigmat\u00f4d\u00f4s) and that Aristotle\u2019s\ncriticism of them is merely directed against their apparent meaning.\nWhat is more, we should keep in mind that they wrote before the\nmethods of philosophical discourse and formal logic were firmly\nestablished by Plato and Aristotle:\n\n\nBut since we will hear Aristotle too refuting the opinions of earlier\nphilosophers, and before Aristotle Plato seems to do this, and before\nboth of them Parmenides and Xenophanes, it should be known that these\npeople, being concerned for those who listen more superficially,\nrefuted the apparent absurdity (to phainomenon atopon) in\ntheir accounts, since the ancients were accustomed to express their\ndoctrines in riddles (ainigmat\u00f4d\u00f4s). (Simplicius,\nIn Phys. 36.25\u201331, translated by R. Barney and S.\nMenn)\n\n[\u2026] Eudemus bears witness to this when he says: \u2018Someone\nmight be amazed at Parmenides for following these untrustworthy\narguments and being deceived by things of this kind, but these matters\nhad not yet then been clarified. For neither did anyone refer to\n\u201c[being spoken of] in many ways\u201d but Plato was the first\nto introduce \u201cin two ways\u201d, nor [did anyone speak of] the\n\u201cin itself\u201d or \u201cthe accidental\u201d; and it seems\nthat he [i.e., Parmenides] was indeed misled by these points. These\nhave been studied through the arguments and counter arguments, and the\nsyllogistic <figure>. For there was no agreement unless it was\nseen to be necessary. But our predecessors made claims without proof.\n(Simplicius, In Phys. 120.6\u201312, translated by P. Huby\nand C. C. W. Taylor)\n\n\nSimplicius uses the same pattern of argument regarding\nAristotle\u2019s criticism of Plato: Aristotle argues merely against\nthe apparent meaning of Plato\u2019s words (see, for instance, In\nCael. 352.27\u201328, 296.6\u20138 and 26\u201330, 377.20\nff.). Pantelis Golitsis has rightly pointed out that such criticism had\na \u201cpreventive\u201d and \u201cpedagogical\u201d function for\nordinary, more superficial, and inexperienced readers who were prone\nto misunderstand Plato. This goes back, in part, to the Neoplatonist\nSyrianus (Golitsis 2018: 94). For instance, Golitsis points to In\nPhys. 821.27\u201329, where Simplicius explains that\n\u201cAristotle philosophised in a way which is more suited to the\nmajority of people and because he was aware of their misunderstandings\n[\u2026]\u201d (translated by J. O. Urmson and P. Golitsis).\nSimplicius\u2019 arguments are, as previously noted, indebted to\nAmmonius. Olympiodorus, Ammonius\u2019 pupil in Alexandria, shows a\nstrategy similar to Simplicius\u2019 strategy. The only difference\nmay be that, as already noted, Simplicius never seems to disagree with\nPlato. Was the Alexandrian or the Ammonian school more liberal in this\nrespect? Once again, it is interesting to compare Simplicius with\nOlympiodorus:\n\n\nOlympiodorus follows Ammonius in emphasizing the harmony between\nAristotle and his master [\u2026]. He calls him a true disciple of\nPlato (In Alc. 5.29\u201332). Whenever possible he resolves\napparent contradictions and says that in the rare instances where\nAristotle diverges from Plato he is still indebted to him (In\nGorg. 41.9, 214.13\u2013215.11). Olympiodorus is not blind to\nthe divergences, and in those cases he usually, though not always,\nagrees with Plato. (Opsomer 2010: 707)\n\n",
