MacKinnon writes, \u201cWomen\nwho charge men with sexual abuse are not believed. The pornographic\nview of them is: they want it; they all want it\u201d (MacKinnon\n1987: 191). When they communicate their unwillingness to participate\nin a sexual activity, their interlocutors will infer that they are\nmisreporting their desires. In this way, pornography silences women,\nbecause it reinforces the prejudice that women are dishonest or coy\nwhen they express little or no sexual interest in men who pursue\nsexual contact with them. Similarly, when a juror listens to the\ntestimony of a sexual assault victim, his perception of her sincerity\nwill be skewed by his exposure to pornography (Langton 2009: 297). On\nthis view, pornography is a mechanism that can be wielded to deny\nwomen their equal right to free speech, social respect, and personal\nsecurity, and thus subordinates and silences them.\n\nRae Langton deploys the tools of speech act theory to elaborate\nfurther how pornography silences and subordinates women (Langton 1995:\n215). Langton points out that pornographic words and images, like\nutterances in general, are a form of social action. The literal\ncontent (locutionary force) of a pornographic work includes the\nrepresentation of a particular sex acts, which have the effect\n(perlocutionary force) of arousing some viewers and shaping their\nattitudes toward women. The illocutionary force of a pornographic work\npertains to the social actions performed in depicting sex and women,\nsuch as informing, commanding, entertaining, approving, and so forth.\nFor example, a posted sign with the words \u201cWhites Only\u201d\nperforms the social act of commanding and enforcing racial segregation\nin a context with certain kinds of formal or informal social rules\ninvolving racial status. Similarly, a pornographic work may perform\nthe function of recommending or approving certain sexually predatory\nbehaviors in a context with certain kinds of social rules about the\nstatus and entitlements of the character types shown. The\nillocutionary force of a particular speech act, sign, or expressive\nwork depends on a variety of factors, including the intentions of the\nauthor and the linguistic and social conventions that link words with\nparticular meanings and social practices. A \u201cWhites Only\u201d\nsign placed on a laundry basket performs a different illocutionary act\nthan one placed on a drinking fountain or bus seat. A successful\nspeech act, where an audience gets what a speaker intends to\ncommunicate or do, depends on various historical, legal, and other\nfeatures of the context of use (Saul 2006b; Bianchi 2008; Mikkola\n2008). Langton argues that there are good, though not conclusive,\nreasons to think that the background factors that enable pornographic\ntexts to endorse, recommend, or command hostile acts against women are\nin place. However, she also suggests that the illocutionary force of\npornography may be blocked effectively by the speech acts of its\ncritics, rather than by censorship (Langton 1995: 216).\n\nJennifer Hornsby also deploys speech act theory to explain how\npornography silences women. Hornsby maintains that pornographic\nmaterials reinforce ideas about women that deprive their utterances of\ntheir ordinary illocutionary meaning (Hornsby 1995: 227). For example,\npornographic works may convey the idea that the women whom men find\nsexy are eager to satisfy their sexual appetites, so that when these\nwomen say \u201cno\u201d, their utterance constitutes not an act of\nrefusal but an act of teasing. In this way, pornography reinforces\nsocial codes that allow men to systematically misread and discount\nwomen\u2019s speech. Women may be silenced, then, not by having their\nspeech suppressed but by changes to the background conditions\nnecessary for successful speech acts, such as refusal. If pornography\ninterferes with the ability of women to communicate, then women cannot\ncontest the harm of pornography with more speech, but only by\nsuppressing pornographic materials.\n\nOne implication of the claim that pornography causes men to misread\nwomen\u2019s communicative acts is that it potentially offers a\ndefense to sexual predators who claim they sincerely believed their\nvictims intended to convey something opposite to the ordinary meaning\nof their utterances. Mari Mikkola argues that this worry does not\nundermine Langton\u2019s and Hornsby\u2019s analysis of pornography.\nInstead, this consequence of their account should force us to rethink\nhow much a conviction in a rape case should depend upon the accused\nhaving malicious motives or intentions (Mikkola 2011). Mary Kate\nMcGowan et al. argue that\n\n\neven if consuming pornography causes some men to believe that women\nare consenting (when they are not), this is insufficient to show that\nthese beliefs are reasonable. Mere belief in consent does nothing to\nundermine a rapist\u2019s responsibility (in most jurisdictions\nanyway) unless that belief is also reasonable. (McGowan et al. 2011:\n145)\n\n\nYet, if pornography can disable or frustrate ordinary communication,\nhow should reasonable and moral people ensure that their sexual acts\nare consensual? Campaigns against sexual assault that propose simple\nrules, such as \u201cno means no\u201d and \u201cyes means\nyes\u201d, essentially instruct us to equate the illocutionary force\nof an utterance with its literal meaning during a sexual encounter. If\npornography has the power to rob speech of its ordinary meanings, then\na cautious and reasonable way to secure consent for a sexual act might\nrequire defaulting to literal interpretation, with the implication\nthat those who do not will be subject to criminal charges and\npunishment.\n\nSusan Brison explores the subordination thesis and contends that\npornography is a form of group libel that may undermine the autonomy\nof the target group. By spreading falsehoods about women, pornography\nnarrows the range of social options and opportunities that women have\navailable to them. Members of groups that are socially vilified by\nhate literature have a more difficult journey pursuing their aims or\nattempting to perform particular social roles (Brison 1998). Langton\nargues that, even if pornography is about fantasy and is to be\nunderstood as fictional, it can misinform. According to Langton,\npornography projects the beliefs and fantasies of those who are\nsocially powerful, and because those with less social power may\nconform their behavior to those beliefs, the beliefs become\nself-fulfilling. In this way, pornographic speech harms women by\nchanging the world it appears to describe (Langton 2009: 301\u20139).\nMcGowan similarly argues that pornography functions as \u201can\nerroneous but authoritative judgment about women\u2019s\nnatures\u201d, in the way an umpire\u2019s call establishes the\nfacts about the events of a game (McGowan 2005: 43). Abigail Levin\nclaims that \u201cpornography and hate speech are the voice of\nmajority hegemonic power\u201d and thereby operate to privilege and\nvindicate the interests of the powerful majorities and dominant groups\n(Levin 2009: 371\u20132).\n\nLouise Antony challenges Langton's use of speech act theory to\nexplain the apparent self-verifying nature of pornography. Antony\nargues that a speech act cannot both describe a state of affairs and\nbring that state of affairs into being. Langton's account, Antony\nargues, conflates \"power\" with \"authority,\" and\nwhile pornography may have the power or ability to impact the world,\nit is not vested with the authority to do so. Antony points out that\nauthority comes about through social agreement or conventions, and\npornography does not, in this sense, have the authority of an umpire\n(or the law) to impose its commands or view of reality, though it may\nat times succeed in influencing the beliefs or behavior of viewers\n(Antony 2017; see also Stewart 2019).\n\nNadine Strossen challenges the notion that pornographic works have\nsingular authoritative meanings that are inherently sexist or\nmisogynist. She writes\n\n\nProcensorship feminists may well view a woman\u2019s apparent\nwelcoming of sex with a man as degrading, but this is because of their\nnegative attitudes toward women\u2019s ability to make sexual\nchoices. Other viewers are likely to see such a scene as positive and\nhealthy. (Strossen 1995: 162)\n\n\nFurthermore, according to Strossen\n\n\nAmbiguous and positive interpretations apply to the full range of\nsexual speech, including violent imagery and imagery that might well\nbe labeled \u201csubordinating\u201d or \u201cdegrading,\u201d\nsuch as rape scenes and scenes dramatizing the so-called rape\nmyth\u2014namely that women want to be raped. (Strossen 1995:\n146)\n\n\nTo illustrate that pornographic texts can produce divergent responses,\nStrossen examines opposing reactions to a variety of popular media,\nincluding films that depict rape, controversial images of women in\nmainstream advertisements, and Andrea Dworkin\u2019s own sexually\ngraphic novels. Strossen claims that the effect on some viewers,\nincluding women, may be positive:\n\n\nPornography, including pornographic rape scenes, may serve another,\nintensely political end for women who read or see them: they go\nagainst the grain, thus allowing viewers to express rebellion and\nindividuality. In this sense, too, words or images that literally\ndepict a woman\u2019s powerlessness may well have an empowering\nimpact on female viewers. (Strossen 1995: 174)\n\n\nThe existence of divergent interpretations and responses to\npornographic works challenges the idea that pornography has any\nsingle, harmful impact on the background conditions of communication.\nIn short, pornographic works can invite or provoke viewers to\nchallenge oppressive social norms, rather than merely conform to them.\nAt the very least, such materials make troubling aspects of human\nsexuality available for public debate and critique (Strossen 1995:\n176).\n\nGeorgia Warnke turns the tables on the silencing hypothesis by\nsuggesting that\n\n\nantipornography feminism silences women\u2019s differing sexual\nself-expressions by condemning those with which it disagrees as false\nconsciousness \u2026 [and] by promoting legislation that would\nsuppress materials through which women can discover different views of\nan authentic sexuality and, indeed, different ways of being sexual.\n(Warnke 1999: 124)\n\n\nConsuelo Concepcion argues that antiporn feminism\n\n\nshows little respect for women\u2019s differing sexual practices, be\nthey heterosexual intercourse or lesbian sadomasochism. This form of\nuniversalization denies women sexual agency because it assumes that\nour ideas about sexuality have no legitimacy and would be co-opted by\nthe patriarchy. \u2026 [and it] delegitimates women\u2019s\ndissenting sexual voices; consequently, it can depict our sexualities\nas a form of moral deviance. (Concepcion 1999: 98)\n\n\nIn sum, not all women are traumatized or silenced by pornography. Some\nwomen enjoy pornography as consumers in ways that transgress or defy,\nrather than reinforce, social norms or erroneous beliefs about\nwomen\u2019s nature. Antiporn feminists overlook and marginalize\nunconventional and diverse forms of sexual expression that some women\nenjoy.\n\nAmy Allen critiques feminist debates about pornography for reducing\nthe idea of power to the capacity to subordinate someone or resist\nsubordination. Anti-pornography feminists understand\npornography\u2019s influence only in terms the subordination of women\nby men, and in this way treat all women as victims and overlook the\nforms of social power some women have by virtue of their race,\nnationality, or class. Pro-sex feminists view pornography as a tool\nfor subverting sexual norms, and empowering women by enabling them to\nresist sexual repression and sexist constructions of feminine\nrespectability. Following Foucault, Allen argues that the power to\noppress or resist are interconnected, in that both are shaped by\ncommon understandings of human needs and desires that can be\ncontrolled by others or liberated. Allen writes\n\n\npornography does not have the power to construct our social reality\nthat MacKinnon and Dworkin claim it has, nor do we as individuals have\nthe power to decide to construe pornography as necessarily subversive.\nSuch a transformation of the impact of pornography can be brought\nabout, if at all, only by a collective social movement. (Allen 2001:\n528)\n\n\nOn this view of pornography\u2019s influence, its capacity to uphold\nor subvert dominant social norms is conditioned by a third form of\npower, which is the capacity to act in solidarity with others.\n",
