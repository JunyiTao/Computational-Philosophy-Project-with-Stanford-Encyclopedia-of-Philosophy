The Quests for Certainty and Purity\n\nOne of philosophy\u2019s responses to the presence of flux and change in\nthe world has been to seek stability in the fixed and unchanging.\nAnother has been to try to rigidly order and compartmentalize that\nwhich is ambiguous or indeterminate. These quests for certainty and\npurity have been the concern of pragmatist and continental feminists\nbecause of their endorsement of traits seen as masculine and their\ncorresponding rejection of those viewed as feminine. Given western\nculture\u2019s association of women with the impure, ambiguous, and\ndisorderly, the quest to free philosophy from those characteristics\nhas been a simultaneous attempt to flee from everything associated\nwith the feminine.\n\nIn The Flight to Objectivity: Essays on Cartesianism and\nCulture, Susan Bordo criticizes the \u201c\u2018flight from the\nfeminine\u2019\u201d that has resulted from philosophy\u2019s quests for\ncertainty and purity (1987, 118). She argues that in the wake of work\nby Richard Rorty, Michel Foucault, and feminist historians and\nphilosophers of science such as Evelyn Fox Keller and Sandra Harding,\nphilosophy cannot easily sustain its anti-cultural and non-historical\naccounts of the world. Adopting Rorty\u2019s metaphor of \u201cthe mirror\nof nature\u201d (1979) to criticize philosophy\u2019s self-conception as a\nneutral reflection of what is given in the\n world,[2]\n Bordo provides a psychocultural analysis of the development of that\nmirror in the work of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Rorty\u2019s Nietzschean and\nDeweyan approach to philosophy understands it as a form of cultural\ntherapy, that is, as a way to improve or \u201ccure\u201d the\n\u201cillnesses\u201d of contemporary society. Similarly, The\nFlight to Objectivity brings together feminist concerns and\npsychoanalytic tools to identify western culture\u2019s Cartesian\n\u201cdisease.\u201d Bordo\u2019s diagnosis is that Cartesian anxiety in\nthe face of epistemological doubt is in fact an anxiety due to\nseparation from an organic universe conceived of as female.\n\nTaking seriously the experiential bases of Descartes\u2019s skepticism,\nBordo identifies the epistemological problem over which Descartes\nobsessed to be that of psychological corruption, which threatens to\nmake it impossible to know how and when to trust one\u2019s felt sense of\nconviction when one believes something to be true. Drawing on Dewey\u2019s\nanalysis in The Quest for Certainty (1988) and the\nanthropological work of Mary Douglas, Bordo argues that an absolutist\nquest for purity is a common response to anxiety over the messiness\nand ambiguity of the world. Moreover, she explains that the quest for\npurity during times of high cultural anxiety is correlated with an\nincrease in male social domination. As anthropologist Peggy Reeves\nSanday\u2019s cross-cultural findings demonstrate, male domination within a\nculture tends to be at its most extreme when that culture experiences\nitself as being in too much flux (Bordo 1987, 111). For Bordo,\nDescartes\u2019s response to historical changes such as the cultural and\nscientific revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nsuch as Martin Luther\u2019s reformation movement and Copernicus\u2019s\nheliocentricism, was to attempt to establish a firm division between\nconfusion and order, the impure and the pure, the ambiguous and the\ncertain, the body and the mind, and the \u201cdirty\u201d from the\n\u201cclean.\u201d Descartes thus can be thought of as the\nquintessential \u201cdirt-rejecter\u201d of Western philosophy\n(1987, 82). As Bordo argues, the mark of Cartesianism is not so much\nits claims to neutral objectivity as it is its \u201cpassion for\nintellectual separation, demarcation, and order\u201d (1987,\n77). Given western culture\u2019s long-standing\nassociation between reason, the orderly mind, and masculinity, on the\none hand, and emotions, the messy body, and femininity, on the other,\nDescartes\u2019 rejection of flux for order was at the same time a\nprivileging of the (culturally constituted) masculine over the\n(culturally constituted) feminine.\n\nDewey once claimed that a felt sense of \u201cinsecurity generates\nthe quest for certainty\u201d (Dewey 1988, 203). Following up on that\nclaim, Bordo argues that the problematic genius of Descartes was to\nfind a way to convert his anxiety in the face of the impure and\nambiguous into the confidence and certitude of objectivity. As Bordo\nexplains, \u201cWhere there is anxiety, there will almost certainly\nbe found a mechanism against that anxiety\u201d (Bordo 1987, 75).\nDescartes took that which produced dread\u2014the perceived\nbarrenness of a mechanistic world\u2014and turned it into an\nadvantage, into that which makes objectivity, and thus also certainty,\npossible. In defense against the painful anxiety he felt about the\nprocess of separating from the organic whole of the universe,\nDescartes effectively declared that he willed and welcomed such a\nseparation. His defense, in other words, can be seen as a\nreaction-formation to a painful loss. Tracing the historical and\ncultural masculinization of thought and the corresponding reconception\nof nature as dead and mechanical rather than organic and alive, Bordo\ndemonstrates how what was lost was the previous cultural conception of\na \u201cfemale cosmos and \u2018feminine\u2019 orientation towards\nthe world\u201d (1987, 100). Descartes\u2019s method of achieving absolute\ncertainty thus is as much a \u201cflight from the feminine\u201d\nhistorically and culturally associated with the organic and fluid, as\nit is the creation of a new epistemological criterion of and method\nfor objectivity.\n",
