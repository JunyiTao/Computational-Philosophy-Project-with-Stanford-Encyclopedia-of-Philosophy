    "main_text": "The ethics of neuroscience || Personal Identity\n2.3 Personal Identity\n\nOne of the aspects of neuroethics that makes it distinctive and\nimportantly different from traditional bioethics is that we recognize\nthat, in some yet-to-be-articulated sense, the brain is the seat of\nwho we are. For example, we now have techniques that alter\nmemories by blunting them, strengthening them, or selectively editing\nthem. We have drugs that affect sexuality, and others that affect\nmood. Here, neuroethics rubs up against some of the most challenging\nand contentious questions in philosophy: What is the self? What sorts\nof changes can we undergo and still remain ourselves? What is it that\nmakes us the same person over time? Of what value is this temporal\npersistence? What costs would changing personhood incur?\n\nBecause neuroscience intervention techniques can affect memory,\ndesires, personality, mood, impulsivity and other things we might\nthink of as constitutive of the person or the self, the changes they\ncan cause (and combat) have a unique potential to affect both the\nmeaning and quality of the most intimate aspects of our lives.\nAlthough neuroethics is quite different from traditional bioethics in\nthis regard, it is not so different from genethics. For a long time,\nit was argued that \u201cyou are your genes\u201d, and so the\nability to interrogate our genomes, to change them, or to select among\nthem was seen as both a promising and potentially problematic one,\nenabling us to understand and manipulate human nature to an extent far\nbeyond any we had previously enjoyed. But as we have discovered, we\nare not (just) our genes. Our ability to sequence the human genome has\nnot laid bare the causes of cancer, the genetic basis for\nintelligence, or of psychiatric illness, as many had anticipated. One\nreason is that our genome is a distal cause of the people we come to\nbe: many complex and intervening factors matter along the way. Our\nbrains, on the other hand, are a far more proximal cause of who we are\nand what we do. Our moment-to-moment behavior and our long-range plans\nare directly controlled by our brains, in a way they are not directly\ncontrolled by our genomes. If \u201cYou are your genes\u201d seemed\na plausible maxim, \u201cYou are your brain\u201d is far more\nso.\n\nDespite its plausibility, it is notoriously difficult to articulate\nthe way in which we are our brains: What aspects of our brains makes\nus the people that we are? What aspects of brain function shape our\nmemories, our personality, our dispositions? What aspects are\nirrelevant or inessential to who we are? What makes possible a\ncoherent sense of self? The lack of answers we have to these deep\nneurophilosophical questions does little to alleviate the pragmatic\nworries raised by neuroscience, since our ability to intervene in\nbrains outstrips our understanding of what we are doing, and can\naffect all these aspects of our being.\n\nIn philosophy, work focusing on persons may address a variety of\ndistinct issues using different constructs. Philosophers might be\ninterested in the nature of personhood, in the nature of the self, in\nthe kinds of traits and psychological states or processes that give an\nexperienced life coherence or authenticity, or in the ingredients for\na flourishing life. Each calls for its own analysis. Outside of\nphilosophy, many of these issues are run together, and confusion often\nresults. Neuroethics, while in a unique position to leverage these\nissues and apply them in a fruitful way, often fails to make the most\nof the conceptual work philosophers have done in this area. For\nexample, papers in neuroethics often conflate a number of these\ndistinct concepts, referring them under the rubric of \u201cpersonal\nidentity\u201d. This conflation further muddies already difficult\nwaters, and diminishes the potential value of neuroethical work. Below\nI try to give a brief roadmap of the separate strands that\nneuroethicists have been concerned with.\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s conception of personal identity refers to the\nissue of what makes a person at one time numerically identical to a\nperson at another time. This metaphysical question has been addressed\nby a variety of philosophical theories. For example, some theorists\nargue that what it is to be the numerically identical over time is to\nbe the same human organism (Olson, 1999), and that being the same\norganism is determined by sameness of life. If having the same life is\nthe relevant criterion, one could argue that life-sustaining areas of\nthe brainstem are essential to personal identity (Olson, 1999). For\nthose who believe instead that bodily integrity is what is essential,\nthe ability of neuroscience to alter the brain will arguably\u00a0have\nlittle effect on personal identity. Many other philosophers have\nidentified the same person as being grounded in psychological\ncontinuity of some sort (e.g., Locke). If this criterion is the\ncorrect one, then the stringency of that criterion may be crucial:\nradical brain manipulation may cause an abrupt enough shift in\nmemories and other psychological states that a person after brain\nintervention is no longer the same person he or she was prior. The\nmore stringent the criterion, the greater is the potential threat of\nneurotherapies to personal identity (Jecker and Ko, 2017; Pascalev et\nal. 2016). On the other hand, if the standards for psychological\ncontinuity or connectedness are high enough, changes in personal\nidentity may in fact be commonplace even without neurotherapies.\nRecognizing this may prompt us to question the criterion and/or the\nimportance or value of personal identity. Parfit, for example, argues\nthat what makes us one and the same person over time, and what we\nvalue (psychological continuity and connectedness) come apart (Parfit,\n1984).\n\nFor some, the question of personhood comes apart from the question of\nidentity. Even if personal (i.e. numerical) identity is unchallenged\nby neurotechnologies and by brain dysfunction, important neuroethical\nquestions may still be raised. Philosophers less concerned with\nmetaphysical questions about numerical identity have focused more on\nthe self, and on notions of authenticity and self-identification,\nemphasizing the importance of the psychological perspective of the\nperson in question in creating a coherent self (Mackenzie and Walker,\n2015; Erler, 2011; Pugh et al., 2017). In this vein, Schectman has\nsuggested that what is important is the ability to create a coherent\nnarrative, or \u201cnarrative self\u201d (Schectman, 2014). There is\nevidence that the ability to create and sustain a coherent narrative\nin which we are the protagonist and with which we identify, is a\nmeasure of psychological health (Waters et al., 2014). On the other\nhand, some philosophers deny that they have a narrative self and\nlocate selfhood in a synchronic property (Strawson, 2004). To further\ncomplicate matters, it has been suggested that there is a distinction\nbetween the narrative person and the narrative self, these being\ndifferentiable via degrees of appropriation. Concerns about the nature\nand coherence of the narrative self, and about authenticity and\nautonomy, tend to be the ones most relevant to neuroethics, since\nthese constructs clearly can be affected by even modest brain changes.\nFor example, how do we evaluate the costs and ethical issues attending\na dramatic change in personality, or a modification of key memories?\nWhat are the criteria governing whether one is authentic or\ninauthentic, and what is the value of authenticity? If\nneurointerventions promise to result in dramatic shifts in a\nperson\u2019s values and commitments, whose interests should take\npriority if one person must be favored - the original or the resulting\nperson? The relevance of personhood, self, agency, identity and\nidentification needs further elaboration for neuroethics. In what\nfollows we discuss how one neurotechnology can bear upon some of these\nquestions.\n2.3.1 Example: Deep Brain Stimulation\n\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS) involves the stimulation of chronically\nimplanted electrodes deep in the brain, and it is FDA approved for\ntreating Parkinson\u2019s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease\naffecting the dopamine neurons in the striatum. Neuromodulation with\nDBS often restores motor function in these patients, permitting many\nto live much improved lives. It is also being explored as treatments\nfor treatment-resistant depression, OCD, addiction, and other\nneurological and psychiatric issues. Although DBS is clearly a boon to\nmany people suffering from neurological diseases, there are a number\nof puzzling issues that arise from its adoption. First, it is a highly\ninvasive treatment, requiring brain surgery and permanent implantation\nof a stimulator, thus posing a real possibility of harm and raising\nquestions of cost/benefit tradeoffs. This is coupled with the fact\nthat scientists have little mechanistic understanding of how the\ntreatment works when it does, and treatment regimes and electrode\nplacement tend to be symptomatic. Occasionally DBS causes unusual side\neffects, such as mood changes, hypomania or mania, addictive\nbehaviors, or hypersexual behavior. In one case a patient with\nwide-ranging musical tastes developed a fixation for Johnny\nCash\u2019s music, which persisted until stimulation was ceased\n(Mantione et al., 2014). Other reported cases involve changes in\npersonality. The ethical questions in this area revolve around the\nethics of intervening in ways that alter mood and/or personality,\nwhich is often discussed in terms of personal identity or\n\u201cchanging who the person is\u201d, and around questions of\nautonomy and alienation (Klaming et al, 2013; Kraemer, 2013a).\n\nOne poignant example from the literature tells of a patient who,\nwithout intervention, was bedridden and had to be hospitalized due to\nsevere motor dysfunction caused by Parkinson\u2019s Disease\n(Leentjens et al., 2003). DBS resulted in a marked improvement in his\nmotor symptoms but also caused him to be untreatably manic, which\nrequired institutionalization. Thus, this unfortunate man had to\nchoose between being bedridden and catatonic, or manic and\ninstitutionalized. He made the choice (in his unstimulated state) to\nremain on stimulation (the literature does not mention whether his\nstimulated self concurred, as he was not deemed mentally competent in\nthat state) (Kraemer, 2013b). While it did not happen in this case,\none could imagine a situation in which the patient will choose, while\nunstimulated, to undergo chronic stimulation, but, while under\nstimulation, would choose otherwise (or vice versa). The\npossibility for dilemmas or paradoxes will arise when, for example, we\ntry to determine the value of two potential outcomes that are\ndifferently valued by the people who might exist. To which person (or\nto the person in which state) should we give priority? Or, even more\nperplexing: if the \u201cidentity\u201d (narrative or numerical) of\nthe person is indeed shifted by the treatment, should we give one\nperson the authority to consent to a procedure or choose an outcome\nthat in practice affects a different person? DBS cases like this will\nprovide fodder for neuroethicists for years to come (Skorburg and\nSinnott-Armstrong, 2020).\n\nMany other neurotechnologies that have been developed for treating\nbrain dysfunction have primary or side effects that affect some aspect\nof what we may think of as related to human agency (Zuk et al., 2018).\nThe ethical issues that arise with these neurotechnologies involve\ndetermining 1) in which way they do impact our selves or our agency;\n2) what value, positive or negative we should put on this impact (or\nability to so affect agency); and 3) how to weigh the positive gains\nagainst the negatives. One issue that has been raised is whether we\npossess a clear enough conception of the elements of agency in order\nto effectively perform this sort of analysis (Roskies, 2015).\nMoreover, given the likelihood that no objective criteria exist for\nhow to evaluate tradeoffs in these elements, and the fact that\ndifferent people may value different aspects of themselves\ndifferently, the weighing process will likely have to be subjectively\nrelativized.\n\nFinally, DBS as well as neural prostheses and BCIs raise another\nneuroethical issue: our conception of humanity and our relations to\nmachines. Some contend that these technologies effectively turn a\nperson into a cyborg, making him or her something other than human.\nWhile some find this an ethically unproblematic natural extension of\nour species\u2019 characteristic drive to invent and improve our\nselves with technology (Clark, 2004), others fear that creating a\nbio-cybernetic organism raises troubling questions about the nature or\nvalue of humanity, about the bounds of self, or about Promethean\nimpulses. These questions too fall squarely in the domain of\nneuroethics.\n",
