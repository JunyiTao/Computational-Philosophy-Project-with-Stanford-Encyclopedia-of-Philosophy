But one might wonder why we should make this assumption. Those\nwho believe that there are (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient\nconditions for identity over time need not, and almost universally do\nnot, believe that these conditions consist in the possession, by an\nobject, of some \u2018omnitemporal core\u2019 (to use a phrase\nsuggested by Harold Noonan) that it has at every time in its\nexistence. So why should things be different in the modal case?\n\nThe obvious answer seems to be this. In the case of identity over\ntime, we can appeal to relations (other than mere similarity) between\nthe states of an individual at different times in its existence. For\nexample, it looks as if we can say that the adult Russell is identical\nwith the infant Russell in virtue of the existence of certain\nspatiotemporal and causal continuities between his infant state in\n1873 and his adult state in (say) 1950 that are characteristic of the\ncontinued existence of a human being. But no such relations of\ncontinuity are available to ground identities across possible worlds\n(cf. Quine 1976).\n\nHowever, on reflection, it may seem that this is too swift. If we\nsuppose that any possible history for Russell is a possible\nspatiotemporal and causal extension of the state that he was actually\nin at some time in his existence, then perhaps we may appeal to the\nsame continuities that ground his identity over time in the actual\nworld in order to ground his identity across possible worlds (cf.\nBrody 1980, 114\u2013115; 121). For example, perhaps to say that\nRussell could have been a playwright is to say that there was some\ntime in his actual existence at which he could have become a\nplaywright. If so, then perhaps we can hold that for a playwright in a\npossible world to be identical with Russell is for that playwright to\nhave, in that world, a life that is, at some early stage, exactly the\nsame as Russell\u2019s actual life at some early stage, but which\ndevelops from that point, in the spatiotemporally and causally\ncontinuous fashion that is characteristic of the continued existence\nof a human being, into the career of a playwright rather than that of\na philosopher. However, although such a conception may seem initially\nattractive, it runs into difficulties if it is intended to provide\nconditions that are genuinely both necessary and sufficient for the\nidentity of individuals across possible worlds. These difficulties\ninclude the fact that it seems too much to demand that Russell have\nexactly the same early history (or origin) as his actual\nearly history (or origin) in every possible world in which he exists.\nYet if Russell\u2019s early history could have been different in\ncertain respects, we face the question: \u2018In virtue of what is an\nindividual in another possible world with a slightly\ndifferent early history from Russell\u2019s actual early\nhistory identical with Russell?\u2019\u2014a question of precisely\nthe type that the provision of necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntransworld identity was intended to answer. (For discussion of this\n\u2018branching\u2019 conception of possibilities, and its\nimplications for questions of transworld identity and essential\nproperties, see Brody 1980, Ch. 5; Mackie 1998; Mackie 2006, Chs\n6\u20137; Coburn 1986, Section VI; McGinn 1976; Mackie 1974; Prior\n1960.)\n",
