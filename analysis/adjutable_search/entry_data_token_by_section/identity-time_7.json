    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles || Relative Identity\n4.2 Relative Identity\n\nAdvocates of relative identity deny that there is a single identity\nrelation (see Geach 1967, Griffin 1977). On their view it is improper\nto ask whether, say, the statue is the same thing as the later lump of\nclay. Instead we should ask whether it is the same statue, or the same\nlump of clay. For an advocate of relative identity denying that the\nearlier statue is the same statue as the later lump of clay is\nconsistent with allowing that the earlier statue is the same lump of\nclay as the later lump of clay. It is natural for the relative\nidentity theorist to insist on relativising the transitivity of\nidentity to the same sortal concept in the following way. What the\nrelativised transitivity principle says is that: a is the\nsame F as b, and b is the same F\nas c implies only that a is the same F as\nc (see Griffin 1977).\n\nOne objection to relative identity is that it conflicts with Leibniz's\nLaw. Here is one way in which such conflict may be thought to arise.\nConsider the property version of Leibniz's Law:\n\nLL: \u2200x\u2200y[x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2192 Fy)]\n\n\nThe relation of identity mentioned in the antecedent of LL is\nunrelativised to a sortal. To make it acceptable to the relative\nidentity theorist, let us amend LL to:\n\nLLR:\n\u2200x\u2200y[\u2200F(x is\nthe same F as y) \u2192\n\u2200G(Gx \u2192 Gy)]\n\n\nSuppose we replace \u2018is the same F as y\u2019\nin LLR with \u2018is the same lump of clay\u2019,\n\u2018x\u2019 with \u2018the earlier statue\u2019,\n\u2018y\u2019 with \u2018the later clay lump\u2019, and\ninstantiate the quantifier \u2200G with \u2018is the same\nstatue as the earlier statue\u2019. We then obtain:\n\nR: the earlier statue is the same lump of clay as the later clay lump\n\u2192 (the earlier statue is the same statue as the earlier statue\n\u2192 the earlier statue is the same statue as the later clay lump ).\n\n\nThe trouble is that R is false. The earlier statue is the same lump of\nclay as the clay lump, and the earlier statue is the same statue is\nthe same statue as the earlier statue, but the earlier statue is not,\ncontrary to LLR, the same statue as the later clay lump.\n4.3 Identity: \u2018Strict\u2019 and \u2018Loose\u2019\n\nFollowing Bishop Butler [see\n Section 5],\n Roderick Chisholm distinguishes between a strict and a loose sense of\nidentity (see Chisholm 1969a). To see what this distinction comes to,\nand how it might help with the puzzle cases, consider the case of Cup\nand Tcup. For Chisholm things have their parts essentially in the\nfollowing sense. It is impossible for a to be identical with\nb in the strict and philosophical sense, unless a\nand b have all their parts in common. Earlier Cup has a part,\na handle, that later Cup, not to say earlier and later Tcup, lacks.\nHence, on Chisholm's view, earlier Cup is not strictly identical with\nlater Cup.\n\nEarlier Cup is nontheless identical with later Cup in a loose and\npopular sense. What then, according to Chisholm, is it for earlier Cup\nand later Cup to be identical in a loose and popular sense? To\nsimplify let us suppose, unrealistically, that the only change of\nparts that Cup in, Chisholm would say, a loose and popular sense\nundergoes is loss of a handle. Call Hcup the object that consists of\nCup's handle together with Tcup. Chisholm would say this. Cup is\nearlier wholly constituted by Hcup, that is Tcup plus handle, and\nlater wholly constituted by Tcup alone. Moreover Tcup is related to\nHcup in such a way that, as Chisholm puts it, Tcup at\nt2 is the ens successivum of Hcup at an\nearlier time t1. For Chisholm what makes\nTcup at t2 an ens successivum of Hcup at\nt1 seems to be this. Tcup is a proper part of Hcup\nat t1. There is a sequence S of cups such\nthat each member of S that is not identical with Hcup is, at\nsome time, a proper part of some member of S. For each time\nbetween and including t1 and\nt2 Cup is wholly constituted by some member of\nS.\n\nCup is wholly constituted by Tcup at t2. Since the\nlater Cup is wholly constituted by something, Tcup, that is an ens\nsuccessivum of something, Hcup, that wholly constitutes Cup we\nmay say that earlier cup is loosely identical with later Cup.\n4.4 Arbitrary Undetached Parts\n\nOne solution to the problem posed by the cup case is to reject what\nPeter van Inwagen calls the Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts\n(see van Inwagen 1981). In setting the problem up we assumed that\nearlier Cup consists of the following parts: a handle together with\nTcup. That assumption is justified if the following is. Tcup existed\nas a part of Cup when Cup still had its handle. Van Inwagen would\nreject that assumption. According to him it is illegitimate to assume\nthat any old way of notionally dividing up an object yields an\nexisting undetached part.\n\nInstead of denying that Tcup exists at t1 when it\nis ostensibly a proper part of Cup, we might instead deny that Tcup at\nt1 is identical with what looks very much like\nTcup at t2. In this way we can preserve\ntransitivity without having to identify the earlier cup with one of\nits proper parts.\n\nOne way to allow that Tcup earlier exists without conceding its later\nidentity with Cup is, following Michael Burke, to maintain that Tcup\ngoes out of existence when Cup loses its handle (see Burke 1994).\n4.5 Four Dimensionalism\n\nHere is what a classical four dimensionalist would say about the case\nof the cup. Suppose the interval from t1 to\nt2 is the time during which Cup has a handle\nattached to it, and t2 to t3\nthe interval during which Cup is without a handle, and, so, putatively\nidentical with Tcup. As before Hcup is the fusion of Tcup and Cup's\nhandle. According to the four dimensionalist, Cup, Tcup and Hcup are\nall extended in time as well as space. Tcup has a temporal part that\nextends from t1 to t2 together\nwith a temporal part that extends from t2 to\nt3. Tcup's t1 to\nt2 and t2 to\nt3 temporal parts are distinct from each other as\nwell as being distinct from the temporally longer Tcup. Hcup, that is\nTcup plus handle, is a four dimensional object that extends from\nt1 to t2. Cup itself consists\nof the following two, among indefinitely many other, temporal parts:\nHcup and the t2 to t3 part of\nTcup.\n\nWhat we should say according to the classical four dimensionalist is\nthis. The t1 to t2 temporal\npart of Tcup is a proper temporal and spatial part of Hcup. Hcup and\nthe t2 to t3 temporal parts of\nTcup are proper temporal parts of Cup. Cup is not identical with any\nof Hcup, Tcup from t1 to t2,\nTcup from t2 to t3, or Tcup\nfrom t1 to t3. In particular\nthere is no question of Cup being literally identical with Tcup from\nt2 to t3, when they are\nindiscernible, though, following David Lewis, we may say that Cup and\nTcup are identical at any time between t2 and\nt3 in the sense that they share temporal parts\nduring those times (see Lewis 1986).\n\nMany four-dimensionalists subscribe to a principle that a number of\nwriters call unrestricted mereological composition. According to that\nprinciple any set of, in this case four-dimensional, objects\nconstitute a further four dimensional object. Armed with the\nunrestricted mereological composition principle a four-dimensionalist\ncan say that what there is, in the case of Theseus' ship, is a Y\nbranching object dividable in an indefinite number of ways into four\ndimensional proper parts an indefinite number of which are ships. For\nexample the ship consisting of the stem together with the replacement\nbranch has as two of its proper parts a ship consisting of just the\nstem, and one consisting of just the replacement branch.\n\nApart from the argument that it provides the best solution to\ndiachronic identity puzzles four dimensionalism has been defended on a\nnumber of other grounds. One we have reviewed already; the argument\nthat four dimensionalism gives the best solution to the problem of\ntemporary intrinsics. Another, also offered by David Lewis, invokes\nthe principle that facts in general supervene on facts about the\ninstantiations of intrinsic properties and external relations. Call\nfacts about the instantiation of intrinsic properties and external\nrelations basic facts, and let R be the spatio-temporal\nregion occupied by Plate throughout its career. According to Lewis\nthere is a world W in which a sequence of shorter Plate-like\nobjects occupy R, and all of the basic facts that obtain in\nour world obtain in W. Lewis' supervenience principle tells\nus that all facts supervene on basic facts. The same basic facts\nobtain in both our world and W. So whatever is true of the\noccupant of R in W is true of the occupant of\nR in our world. The occupant of R in W is a\nsequence of, appropriately interrelated Plate-like objects. Hence the\noccupant of R in our world, that is Plate, is likewise a\nsequence of interrelated Plate-like objects.\n\nRecently Sider (2002) developed an argument for Four Dimensionalism\nfrom considerations about vagueness. He argues that Four\nDimensionalism is true if it cannot be vague how many things there\nare, and also that it cannot be vague how many things there are.\n\nIt should be noted that Sider and Katherine Hawley defend an\nalternative version of Four Dimensionalism which identifies objects\nwith what, on the first version, would qualify as their stages (Hawley\n2001, Sider 2002). In order to make this identification Sider invokes\nsomething close to Lewis\u2019 counterpart relation. Will the table I am\ncurrently looking at persist through the next ten minutes? According\nto the classical four-dimensionalist, otherwise known as the\nperdurantist, the table will persist through that period provided it\nhas a present and a ten minutes from now table stage that are both\nstages of the table without either one being identical with the table.\nIn contrast the stage theorist identifies the table with the present\nstage of the table. How can that be since the present table stage only\nexists now, and the table is supposed to be around ten minutes from\nnow? It can be, says the stage theorist, because, though the ten\nminute from now table stage is not now identical with the table, it\nwill be identical with the table. Moreover it will be identical with\nthe table since it stands in the appropriate counterpart relation to\nthe present table stage.\n\nStage theory enjoys the following advantage over classical\nfour-dimensionalism. Consider the case of a person fissioning into two\nlater people. A classical four-dimensionalist like Lewis will say that\nbefore the fission there are two separate people that cannot be told\napart. The stage theorist has no need to say that. Instead the stage\ntheorist can say there is a single present person who will be\nidentical with each of a pair of later individuals in virtue of\nstanding in the relevant counterpart relations to each one.\n\nIt should also be noted that four dimensionalism differs from\nChisholm's invocation of loose and popular identity in, at least, the\nfollowing way. The persistence of an object for any length of time\nwill, on a four dimensionalist view, require the existence of shorter\nlived objects setting aside the possibility of extended simples. The\npersistence for any length of time, on Chisholm's view, of a three\ndimensional object does not require the existence of shorter lived\nthree dimensional objects. It does not do so because the object\npersisting for a lengthy period may undergo no change of parts.\n4.6 Temporary Identity\n\nIn the case of, for example, the truncated cup we saw that one option\nis to claim that Cup is earlier distinct from Tcup [cup minus its\nhandle], but later identical with Tcup. According to this option the\nidentity of Cup with Tcup is only temporary. We also saw that many\nrefuse to countenance temporary identity because it allegedly\nconflicts with Leibniz's Law [LL]. After all, later Cup, but not Tcup,\napparently later has the property of having had a handle.\n\nDespite this putative conflict with LL, some philosophers are prepared\nto defend temporary identity as the best solution to the puzzles about\ndiachronic identity. George Myro does so by restricting the scope of\nLL to exclude such properties as having had a handle (Myro 1985).\nGallois (1998) does so by arguing that if the identity of Cup and Tcup\nis temporary, we cannot infer from Tcup having had a handle earlier\nthat earlier Tcup has a handle.\n4.7 Further Puzzle Cases\n\nWe have focused attention on one type of case that raises a puzzle\nabout diachronic identity. Such a case involves something ostensibly\nbecoming, or ceasing to be identical with something that is ostensibly\none of its earlier or later proper parts. It would be wrong to give\nthe impression that such a \u201cDeon-Theon\u201d case named after\nthe individuals involved in the example is the only, or even main,\ntype of case posing a problem about diachronic identity. In addition\nthere are what are often referred to as fission and fusion cases. A\nfission case has the following features. We have putatively distinct\nthings b and c existing at some later time\nt2. Each of b and c is related\nto a, which exists at an earlier time t1,\nin such a way that each one is ostensibly identical with\na.\n\nFission cases come in two varieties: symmetrical and asymmetrical.\nExamples of symmetrical fission cases include amoebic and hemispheric\ndivision [for the latter see Personal Identity below]. In a\nsymmetrical case there is some relation that each of b and\nc stand in to a, where standing in that relation is\nwhat makes each one putatively identical with a. In an\nasymmetric case, b is putatively identical with a because it\nstands in a certain relation to a, but c is\nputatively identical with a because it stands in a different\nrelation to a. The best known example of a symmetrical\nfission case is the Ship of Theseus described at the beginning of this\nsection.\n\nLet us see how the proposals for dealing with the cup case apply to\nfission cases. Constitution only delivers a candidate solution in a\nsymmetric fission case. As we noted above, a constitution theorist can\nsay the following about Theseus' Ship. The ship resulting from the\nreplacement of the original planks is identical with, but not\nconstituted from the original planks. The ship reconstituted from the\noriginal planks is not identical with the one originally constituted\nfrom those planks.\n\nSome relative identity theorists have this to say about Theseus' Ship.\nIn that case conflict with the transitivity of identity is avoided by\nmaintaining the following. The replacement ship is the same ship as\nthe original, and the original is the same collection of planks as the\nreassembly ship. Conflict with transitivity is avoided because we need\nnot allow that the reassembly ship is the same ship as the\noriginal.\n\nDistinguishing between a strict and loose sense of\n\u2018identical\u2019 yields the following solution in the case of\nTheseus' Ship. Let Original be the original ship, Replacement be the\nship that results from replacing Original's original planks, and\nReassembly the one that results from their reassembly. In that case,\ndeploying the distinction between a strict and loose sense of\nidentity, we can say this. Reassembly is strictly identical with\nOriginal, but Replacement is only loosely identical with Original. A\nconflict with transitivity of identity is avoided for the following\nreason. It follows by transitivity from Replacement being identical\nwith Original, and Original being identical with Reassembly, that\nReplacement is identical with Reassembly only if a single relation of\nidentity is involved.\n\nHere is what a four dimensionalist such as Lewis will say about\nTheseus' ship. In that case there are two initially indiscernible\nships. The first is a four dimensionally extended ship located where\nthe original ship is initially located that ends up coinciding only\nwith the reassembly ship. The second, also initially located where the\noriginal ship is initially ends up coinciding with the replacement\nship. We thus have a Y-branching four dimensionally extended object\nwith one ship constituted by the stem together with one branch, and\nthe other constituted by the stem together with the remaining\nbranch.\n\nFour Dimensionalism, like the thesis that identities can be temporary,\napplies to both symmetric and asymmetric cases of fission.\n\nA temporary identity theorist will hold that Replacement and\nReassembly are identical at t1, but distinct ships\nat t2.\n\nIn the previous section we reviewed an argument designed to rule out\nindeterminate identities. If that argument can be met, it is open to\nus to say the following about Theseus' Ship. Each of Replacement and\nReassembly is indeterminately identical with Original.\n\nThe puzzle cases are puzzle cases because they bring into putative\nconflict intuitions all of which we want to subscribe to. Consider a\nstatue and the collection of atoms that constitute it. We wish to say\nthat the statue is identical with the collection of atoms. We also\nwish to say that the statue, but not the collection, can survive the\nloss of one atom belonging to that collection. Leibniz's Law appears\nto force us to renounce one of these intuitions. Thomas Sattig argues\nfor a compatibilist view according to which we can hold on to both\nintuitions without giving up, or modifying, Leibniz's Law. We can do\nso by relativising identities to different perspectives. From the\nordinary object perspective the statue is distinct from the atoms that\nconstitute it. From the material object perspective the statue is\nidentical with the atoms that constitute it.\n5. Personal Identity\n\nPersonal identity is perhaps the most extensively discussed special\ncase of identity. What is it for a person existing at one time to be\nidentical to a person existing at another? This question was first\nclearly posed by John Locke in his celebrated discussion of personal\nidentity in the Essay (Locke 1975). Locke distinguishes\nbetween being the same man and being the same person. To be the same\nman is to be the same member of the species human being. For Locke\nwhat is crucial is that having the same consciousness is not\nsufficient for being the same man, but is sufficient for being the\nsame person.\n\nFamously Locke calls the concept of a person a forensic concept. For\nLocke much of the importance attaching to being the same person is\nthat moral responsibility for past deeds goes with being the same\nperson, rather than being the same man or even the same immaterial\nsubstance, as a past person. In his view it is enough to be morally\nresponsible for some deed that one is the same person as its\nperformer. It is not required that one be the same man or the same\nimmaterial substance as the one who performed the act in question.\n\nWhat then, according to Locke, is it to have the same consciousness as\nsome past person? He is customarily interpreted as holding that person\nA is the same person as earlier person B just in\ncase A is able to remember enough of what happened to\nB. This is sometimes referred to as the memory criterion of\npersonal identity. The memory criterion was criticized by Butler and\nReid principally because it was said to be circular, and, as a\ncriterion of personal identity, incompatible with the transitivity of\nidentity. (See Section 2.2, and Joseph Butler \u2018Of Personal\nIdentity\u2019 and Thomas Reid \u2018Of Mr. Locke's Account of Our\nPersonal Identity\u2019 in Perry 1975.)\n\nThe argument for the circularity of the memory criterion went like\nthis. Suppose we think of the memory criterion as giving what would be\nlater called an analysis of A being the same person as\nB. If so, we are invited to analyze A being the same\nperson as b in terms of A remembering enough of what\nhappened to B. But any plausible analysis of A\nremembering what happened to B will mention, in the\nanalysans, A being the same person as B.\n\nSydney Shoemaker has responded to the circularity charge by\ndistinguishing remembering from what he calls Q-remembering (Shoemaker\n1975). A Q-remembers something that happened to b\njust in case there is an appropriate causal link between the event\nQ-remembered and A's memory impression of that event. Unlike\nremembering, Q-remembering a past experience does not imply the\nidentity of the one having the Q-memory with the one who had the\nexperience. We can avoid the charge of circularity by restating the\nmemory criterion in the following way. A is the same person\nas some earlier individual B if and only if A\nQ-remembers enough of what happened to B.\n\nThe charge that the memory criterion conflicts with the transitivity\nof identity was illustrated by the famous case of the schoolboy, the\nyoung lieutenant and the elderly general (Reid 1975). The elderly\ngeneral can Q-remember enough of what happened to the young lieutenant\nto qualify, by the memory criterion, as being the same person as the\nyoung lieutenant. The young lieutenant in turn Q-remembers enough of\nwhat happened to the young schoolboy. But the elderly general can\nremember almost nothing of what happened to the young schoolboy. Since\nthe memory criterion has it that A Q-remembering enough of\nwhat happened to B is a necessary condition for A\nbeing the same person as an earlier person B, it follows\nthat, according to the memory criterion, the elderly general is not\nthe same person as the young schoolboy. Hence, the memory criterion\nimplies, contrary to the transitivity of identity, that, although the\nelderly general is the same person as the young lieutenant, and the\nyoung lieutenant is the same person as the schoolboy, the elderly\ngeneral is not the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe memory criterion came to be modified in two further ways. The\nfirst modification provides a way of reconciling the memory criterion\nwith the transitivity of identity in the light of cases such as the\nelderly general. Instead of saying that A is the same person\nas some earlier B if and only if A can Q-remember\nenough of what happened to B, we say the following.\nA is the same person as B if and only if there is a\nQ-memory chain linking A with B. For there to be a\nQ-memory link between A and B, either A\nremembers enough of what happened to B, or A\nremembers enough of what happened to someone who remembers enough of\nwhat happened to B, or A remembers enough of what\nhappened to someone who remembers enough of what happened to someone\nwho remembers enough of what happened to B, and so on. In the\ncase of the elderly general, the elderly general does remember enough\nof what happened to, someone, the young lieutenant, who remembers\nenough of what happened to the young schoolboy to count, by the\nmodified criterion, as the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe second modification extends the memory criterion to include\nforward looking psychological connections, such as that between\npresent intention and future action, as determinants of personal\nidentity.\n\nWith these modifications incorporated the memory criterion has come to\nbe known as the psychological continuity criterion of personal\nidentity. The psychological continuity criterion is an improvement on\nthe original memory criterion. Nevertheless one of the problems\nconfronting the original memory criterion, its putative conflict with\nthe transitivity of identity, can be brought against its successor in\na different form. We saw that making certain identifications in a\nfission case such as the ship of Theseus [see Section 4: Diachronic\nIdentity Puzzles] threatens the transitivity of identity. One much\ndiscussed type of fission case, hemispheric division, is taken by many\nto show that the psychological continuity criterion is, after all,\nincompatible with the transitivity of identity (Nagel 1975).\n\nSuppose, as may one day be medically feasible, an individual\nA's still functioning upper brain is transplanted from\nA's body to the debrained, but living, body formerly\nbelonging to B. Upon being transplanted A's upper brain is\nconnected to what remains of B's central nervous system so\nthat a person, call her A-B, results.\nA-B believes herself to be A, can\nQ-remember what happened to A, has A's psychological\ndispositions, and so on. Should we say that A-B is\nthe same person as A, the same person as B, or an\naltogether new person? Psychological continuity theorists will have\nlittle hesitation in answering that A-B is the same\nperson as A.\n\nA person can function fairly normally with much of their brain\ndestroyed. Suppose A loses an entire brain hemisphere. Given\nthe plasticity of the brain, and aided by our hypothetical future\nmedical technology, it may be that A could survive such a\nloss. If so, it would be unreasonable to deny that A could\nsurvive the transplantation of only one brain hemisphere given that\nshe could survive the transplantation of he entire intact upper\nbrain.\n\nThe putative conflict with transitivity arises when we consider a case\nin which both of the separated hemispheres of A's original\nbrain are transplanted to separate bodies resulting in what certainly\nlook to be distinct individuals. Suppose, one of A's brain\nhemispheres is transferred to B's body, resulting in a person\nPB, and the other to C's body resulting in a person\nPC. It flouts transitivity to say that PC is\nidentical with A, and that A is identical with\nPB, but deny, at it seems we should, that PC is\nidentical with PB.\n\nThere are a number of ways that defenders of a psychological\ncontinuity criterion have attempted to evade this result. One, adopted\nby David Lewis, goes like this (Lewis 1976). We say that earlier, when\nA is around with an intact brain, there are two indiscernible\nindividuals, PB and PC, sharing a single body.\nAnother, advocated by Robert Nozick, concedes that if both hemispheres\nare successfully transplanted, neither of the later individuals with\njust one brain hemisphere is identical with the earlier one with an\nintact brain, but insist that if only one hemisphere is transplanted,\nthe resulting individual is identical with the former possessor of two\nhemispheres. On this view whether, for example, PB is\nidentical with the earlier person with A's body depends on\nwhether there is an equally good later candidate, such as PC,\nfor being the earlier A-body person (Nozick 1981).\n\nIn one of the most influential discussions of personal identity Derek\nParfit defends a view close to Nozick's by distinguishing between\nsurvival and identity (in Perry 1975). In Nozick's view what\npsychological continuity guarantees is not identity, but survival. In\nthe case where both of A's hemispheres are transplanted to\nyield PB and PC, A survives as PB,\nand survives as PC, though she is identical with neither\nPB nor PC.\n\nParfit, Nozick and Lewis all take psychological continuity to be\nintegral to personal identity in the following sense. In cases where\nthere is no branching psychological continuity is sufficient to ensure\nthe identity of a later with an earlier person. A number of\nphilosophers would reject this claim insisting that bodily persistence\nis required for personal identity. Some, for example Eric Olson, would\nargue that psychological continuity is irrelevant to the identity of\nthose things, human beings, who are the only things we know to be\npersons. Instead, on this view, what is crucial to personal identity\nfor humans is continuing to be the same animal (Olson 1997).",
