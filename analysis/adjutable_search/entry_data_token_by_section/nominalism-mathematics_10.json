    "main_text": "Modal Structuralism || Central features of modal structuralism\n4.1 Central features of modal structuralism\nModal structuralism offers a program of interpretation of\nmathematics which incorporates two features: (a) an emphasis on\nstructures as the main subject-matter of mathematics, and (b) a\ncomplete elimination of reference to mathematical objects by\ninterpreting mathematics in terms of modal logic (as first\nsuggested by Putnam (1967), and developed in Hellman (1989,\n1996)). Given these features, the resulting approach is called\na modal-structural interpretation (Hellman 1989,\npp. vii\u2013viii and 6\u20139).\nThe proposal is also supposed to meet two important requirements\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 2\u20136). The first is that mathematical\nstatements should have truth-values, and thus\n\u2018instrumentalist\u2019 readings are rejected from the\noutset. The second is that: \u2018a reasonable account should be\nforthcoming of how mathematics does in fact apply to the material\nworld\u2019 (Hellman 1989, p. 6). Thus, the applicability problem\nmust be examined.\nIn order to address these issues, the modal structuralist puts\nforward a general framework. The main idea is that although\nmathematics is concerned with the study of structures, this study can\nbe accomplished by focusing only on possible structures, and\nnot actual ones. Thus, the modal interpretation is not committed to\nactual mathematical structures; there is no commitment to their\nexistence as objects or to any objects that happen to\n\u2018constitute\u2019 these structures. In this way, the\nontological commitment to them is avoided: the only claim is that the\nstructures in question are possible. In order to articulate\nthis point, the modal-structural interpretation is formulated in a\nsecond-order modal language based on S5. However, to prevent\ncommitment to a set-theoretical characterization of the modal\noperators, Hellman takes these operators as primitive (1989, pp. 17,\nand 20\u201323).\nTwo steps are taken. The first is to present an appropriate\ntranslation scheme in terms of which each ordinary mathematical\nstatement S is taken as elliptical for a hypothetical\nstatement, namely: that S would hold in a structure of\nthe appropriate kind.\nFor example, if we are considering number-theoretic statements,\nsuch as those articulated in Peano arithmetic (PA, for short), the\nstructures we are concerned with are \u2018progressions\u2019 or\n\u2018\u03c9-sequences\u2019 satisfying PA's axioms. In this case,\neach particular statement S is to be (roughly) translated\nas\n\n\u2610\u2200X(X is an \u03c9-sequence\n  satisfying PA's axioms \u2192 S holds in X).\n\nAccording to this statement, if there were \u03c9-sequences\nsatisfying PA's axioms, S would hold in them. This is\nthe hypothetical component of the modal-structural\ninterpretation (for a detailed analysis and a precise formulation, see\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 16\u201324)). The categorical component\nconstitutes the second step (Helman 1989, pp. 24\u201333). The idea\nis to assume that the structures of the appropriate kind are logically\npossible. In that case, we have that\n\n\u25ca\u2203X(X is an \u03c9-sequence satisfying\n  PA's axioms).\n\nThat is, it is logically possible that there are \u03c9-sequences\nsatisfying PA's axioms. Following this approach, truth preserving\ntranslations of mathematical statements can be presented without\nontological costs, given that only the possibility of the\nstructures in question is assumed.\nThe modal structuralist then indicates that the practice of theorem\nproving can be regained in this framework (roughly speaking, by\napplying the translation scheme to each line of the original proof of\nthe theorem under consideration). Moreover, by using the translation\nscheme and appropriate coding devices, one can argue that arithmetic,\nreal analysis and, to a certain extent, even set theory are recovered\nin a nominalist setting (Hellman 1989, pp. 16\u201333, 44\u201347,\nand 53\u201393). In particular, \u2018by making use of coding\ndevices, virtually all the mathematics commonly encountered in current\nphysical theories can be carried out within [real analysis]\u2019\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 45\u201346). However, the issue of whether set\ntheory has been nominalized in this way is, in fact,\nproblematic\u2014as the modal structuralist grants. After all, it is\nno obvious matter to establish even the possibility of the existence\nof structures with inaccessibly many objects.\nWith the framework in place, the modal structuralist can then\nconsider the applicability problem. The main idea is to adopt the\nhypothetical component as the basis for accommodating the application\nof mathematics. The relevant structures are those commonly used in\nparticular branches of science. Two considerations need to be made at\nthis point.\nThe first is the general form of applied mathematical statements\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 118\u2013124). These statements involve three\ncrucial components: the structures that are used in applied\nmathematics, the non-mathematical objects to which the mathematical\nstructures are applied, and a statement of application that specifies\nthe particular relations between the mathematical structures and the\nnon-mathematical objects. The relevant mathematical structures can be\nformulated in set theory. Let us call the set theory used in applied\ncontexts Z. (This is second-order Zermelo set theory, which is\nfinitely axiomatizable; I'll denote the conjunction of the axioms\nof Z by \u2227Z.) The non-mathematical objects of\ninterest in the context of application can be expressed in Z\nas Urelemente, that is, as objects that are not sets. We will\ntake \u2018U\u2019 to be the statement that certain\nnon-mathematical objects of interest are included\nas Urelemente in the structures of Z. Finally,\n\u2018A\u2019 is the statement of application, describing the\nparticular relations between the relevant mathematical structures\nof Z and the non-mathematical objects described\nin U. The particular relations involved depend on the case in\nquestion. We can now present the general form of an applied\nmathematical statement (Hellman 1989, p. 119):\n\n\u2610\u2200X\u2200f ((\u2227Z\n  & U)X (\u2208f)\n  \u2192 A).\n\nIn the antecedent \u2018(\u2227Z\n& U)X (\u2208f)\u2019\nis an abbreviation for the results from writing out the axioms of\nZermelo set theory with all quantifiers relativized to the second\norder variable X, replacing each occurrence of the membership\nsymbol \u2018\u2208\u2019 with the two place relation variable\n\u2018f\u2019. According to the applied mathematical\nstatement, if there were structures satisfying the conjunction of the\naxioms of Zermelo set theory Z including some non-mathematical\nobjects referred to in U, A would hold in such\nstructures. The application statement A expresses the relations\nin questions, such as an isomorphism or a homomorphism between a\nphysical system and certain set theoretic structures. This is the\nhypothetical component interpreted to express which relations would\nhold between certain mathematical structures (formulated as structures\nof \u2227Z) and the entities studied in the world\n(the Urelemente).\nThe second consideration examines in more detail the relationships\nbetween the physical (or the material) objects studied and the\nmathematical framework. These are the \u201csynthetic\ndetermination\u201d relations (Hellman 1989, pp. 124\u2013135). More\nspecifically, we have to determine which relations among\nnon-mathematical objects can be taken, in the antecedent of an applied\nmathematical statement, as the basis for specifying \u201cthe actual\nmaterial situation\u201d (Hellman 1989, p. 129). The modal\nstructuralist proposal is to consider the models of a comprehensive\ntheory T\u2032. This theory embraces and links the vocabulary\nof the applied mathematical theory (T) and the\nsynthetic vocabulary (S) in question, which intuitively fixes\nthe actual material situation. It is assumed that T determines,\nup to isomorphism, a particular kind of mathematical structure\n(containing, for example, Z), and that T\u2032 is an\nextension of T. In that case, a proposed \u201csynthetic\nbasis\u201d will be adequate if the following condition holds:\n\nLet a be the class of (mathematically) standard models\n  of T\u2032, and let V denote the full vocabulary\n  of T\u2032: then S determines V in a\n  iff for any two models m and m\u2032 in a, and\n  any bijection f between their domains, if f is\n  an S isomorphism, it is also a V isomorphism. (Hellman\n  1989, p. 132.)\n\nThe introduction of isomorphism in this context comes, of course,\nfrom the need to accommodate the preservation of structure between the\n(applied) mathematical part of the domain under study and the\nnon-mathematical part. This holds in the crucial case in which the\npreservation of the synthetic properties and relations\n(S-isomorphism) by f leads to the preservation of the\nanalytic applied mathematical relations (V-isomorphism) of the\noverall theory T\u2032. It should be noted that the\n\u2018synthetic\u2019 structure is not meant to\n\u2018capture\u2019 the full structure of the mathematical\ntheory in question, but only its applied part. (Recall that\nHellman started with an applied mathematical\ntheory T.)\nThis can be illustrated with a simple example. Suppose that\nfinitely many physical objects display a linear order. We can describe\nthis by defining a function from those objects to an initial segment\nof the natural numbers. What is required by the modal structuralist's\nsynthetic determination condition is that the physical ordering among\nthe objects alone captures this function and the description it offers\nof the objects. It is not claimed that the full\nnatural number structure is thus captured. This example also provides\nan illustration of the applied mathematical statement mentioned\nabove. The Urelemente (objects that are not sets) are the\nphysical objects in question, the relevant mathematical relation is\nisomorphism, and the mathematical structure is a segment of natural\nnumbers with their usual linear order.\nOn the modal structural conception, mathematics is applied by\nestablishing an appropriate isomorphism between (parts of)\nmathematical structures and those structures that represent the\nmaterial situation. This procedure is justified, since such\nisomorphism establishes the structural equivalence between the\n(relevant parts of the) mathematical and the non-mathematical\nlevels.\nHowever, this proposal faces two difficulties. The first concerns\nthe ontological status of the structural equivalence between the\n(applied) mathematical and the non-mathematical domains. On what\ngrounds can we claim that the structures under consideration are\nmathematically the same if some of them concern \u2018material\u2019\nobjects? Of course, given that the structural equivalence is\nestablished by an isomorphism the material objects are already\nformulated in structural terms\u2014this means that some mathematics\nhas already been applied to the domain in question. In other words, in\norder to be able to represent the applicability of mathematics,\nHellman assumes that some mathematics has already been applied. This\nmeans that a purely mathematical characterization of the applicability\nof mathematics (via structure preservation) is inherently\nincomplete. The first step in the application, namely the\nmathematical modeling of the material domain, is not, and cannot, be\naccommodated, since no isomorphism is involved there. Indeed, given\nthat by hypothesis the domain is not articulated in\nmathematical terms, no isomorphism is defined there.\nIt may be argued that the modal structural account does not require\nan isomorphism between (applied) mathematical structures and those\ndescribing the material situation. The account only requires an\nisomorphism between two standard models of the overall\ntheory T\u2032, which links the mathematical theory T\nand the description S of the material domain. In reply, note\nthat this only moves the difficulty one level up. In order\nfor T\u2032 to extend the applied mathematical theory T\nand to provide a link between T and the material situation, a\nmodel of T\u2032 will have to be, in particular, a model of\nboth T and S. Thus, if the modal structuralist's\nsynthetic determination claim is satisfied, an isomorphism between two\nmodels of T\u2032 will determine an isomorphism between the\nmodels of S and those of T. In this way, an isomorphism\nbetween structures describing the material situation and those arising\nfrom applied mathematics is still required.\nThe second difficulty addresses the epistemological status of the\nclaim that there is a structural equivalence between the mathematical\nand the non-mathematical domains. On what grounds do we know\nthat such equivalence holds? Someone may say that the equivalence is\nnormatively imposed in order for the application process to get off\nthe ground. But this suggestion leads to a dilemma. Either it is just\nassumed that we know that the equivalence holds, and the\nepistemological question is begged (given that the grounds for this\nare in question), or it is assumed that we do not know that\nthe equivalence holds\u2014and that is why we have to impose\nthe condition\u2014in which case the latter is clearly\ngroundless. However, it may be argued that there is no problem here,\nsince we establish the isomorphism by examining the physical theories\nof the material objects under consideration. But the problem is that\nin order to formulate these physical theories we typically use\nmathematics. And the issue is precisely to explain this use, that is,\nto provide some understanding of the grounds in terms of which we come\nto know that the relevant mathematical structures are isomorphic to\nthe physical ones.\nThe main point underlying these considerations has been stressed\noften enough (although in a different context): isomorphism does not\nseem to be an appropriate condition for capturing the relation between\nmathematical structures and the world (see, e.g., da Costa and French\n2003). There is, of course, a correct intuition underlying the use of\nisomorphism at this level, and this relates to the idea of justifying\nthe application of mathematics: the isomorphism does guarantee that\napplied mathematical structures S and the structures M\nwhich represent the material situation are mathematically the\nsame. The problem is that isomorphism-based characterizations tend to\nbe unrealistically strong. They require that some mathematics has\nalready been applied to the material situation, and that we have\nknowledge of the structural equivalence between S\nand M. What is needed is a framework in which the relation\nbetween the relevant structures is weaker than isomorphism, but which\nstill supports the applicability, albeit in a less demanding way\n(e.g., Bueno, French and Ladyman 2002).\n",
