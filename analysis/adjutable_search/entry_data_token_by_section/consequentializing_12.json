Conclusion\n\nAs Campbell Brown (2011) has noted, arguing with an\nact-consequentialist can be frustrating. You describe some\naction\u2014say, your killing one innocent person to prevent the\nmafia from killing five other innocent people. And then you claim that\nalthough your doing this would clearly be wrong, the outcome in which\nyou do this is one that you should prefer to (and, thus, one that\noutranks) the outcome in which you don\u2019t do this. You conclude,\ntherefore, that act-consequentialism is false: an act can be wrong\neven though its outcome is not outranked by that of any available\nalternative. But the act-consequentialist retorts that, to reach this\nconclusion, you had to presuppose a particular account of how outcomes\nrank, one that the act-consequentialist needn\u2019t accept. So, you\nwere wrong to conclude that act-consequentialism is false. All that\nyou\u2019ve shown is that a certain version of act-consequentialism\nis false. But we already knew that act-consequentialism yields\ncounterintuitive deontic verdicts when combined with certain\nassumptions about how outcomes rank. We learned that long ago by\nstudying the implications of utilitarianism.\n\nNote, then, that arguing against act-consequentialism is a complex\ntask. You can\u2019t test it in isolation from various background\nassumptions. Instead, you must evaluate it along with various\nbackground assumptions, including assumptions not only about how to\nrank outcomes but also about the nature of actions and the reasons for\nperforming them.\n\nThis entry suggests that evaluating the merits of consequentializing\nis similarly complex. First, there\u2019s no consequentializing\ntout court, but only three different types of\nconsequentializing. Objections that apply to one don\u2019t\nnecessarily apply to the others. Second, each type of\nconsequentializing has a different motivation. So, there\u2019s no\nway to assess whether consequentializing is, in general, unmotivated.\nWe can assess only whether a particular type of consequentializing is\nunmotivated. And, in the case of earnest consequentializing, this is\nfurther complicated by the fact that earnest consequentializers offer\ndifferent motivations for different moves\u2014e.g., the idea that we\nhave a special responsibility for our own agency as a motivation for\nwhy agents should prefer that others rather than themselves violate\nagent-centered restrictions. Third, there are two different procedures\nfor consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory. And this means\nthat we can\u2019t just assess whether, in general,\nconsequentializing produces a gimmicky theory. We must instead look at\nwhether either of these two procedures produces a gimmicky theory.\n",
