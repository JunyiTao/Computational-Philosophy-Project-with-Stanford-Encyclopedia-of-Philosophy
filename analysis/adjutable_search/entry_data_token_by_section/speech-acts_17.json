    "main_text": "Force, Norms, and Conversation\n6. Force, Norms, and Conversation\n\nIn elucidating this normative dimension of force, we have sought to\ncharacterize speech acts in terms of their conversational roles. That\nis not to say that speech acts can only be performed in the setting of\na conversation: I can approach you, point out that your vehicle is\nblocking mine, and storm off. Here I have made an assertion but have\nnot engaged in a conversation. Perhaps I can ask myself a question in\nthe privacy of my study and leave it at that\u2013not continuing into\na conversation with myself. However, a speech act\u2019s \u201cecological\nniche\u201d may nevertheless be the conversation. In that spirit,\nwhile we may be able to remove a speech act type from its environment\nand scrutinize it in isolated captivity, doing so may blind us to some\nof its distinctive features.\n",
