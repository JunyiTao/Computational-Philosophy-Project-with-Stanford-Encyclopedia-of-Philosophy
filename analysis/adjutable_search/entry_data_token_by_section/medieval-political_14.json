    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s Politics\n7. Aristotle\u2019s Politics\n\nAnother aspect of the \u201crenaissance of the twelfth century\u201d\nwas the translation into Latin of many Greek and Arabic philosophical\nand scientific writings (see the section on \u201cnew\ntranslations\u201d in the entry on\n medieval philosophy).\n The market for these translations included the teachers, students and\nalumni of the urban schools, which in the early thirteenth century\nbegan to form universities. The universities set the curriculum\nfollowed in the schools of the town, and, given Aristotle\u2019s\nfame, competition for students between the schools of different towns\nsoon meant that Aristotle\u2019s works became the main element in the\nArts curriculum (despite the misgivings of the theologians, who noted\nthe conflicts between Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and Christian\nbelief).\n\nIn their interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy and\nmetaphysics and in philosophical thinking generally, the medieval\nschools were much influenced by Muslim and Jewish thinkers. This was\nnot true, however, in political philosophy. By some accident of\ntransmission, the Islamic world does not seem to have known\nAristotle\u2019s Politics, but the Muslims did become\nacquainted with Plato\u2019s Republic\u2014which, however,\nwas not translated into Latin during the middle ages. In Arabic there\nwas a good deal of political philosophy showing the influence of Plato\n(for some information, see the entry on\n Greek Sources in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy),[37]\n but it had little or no influence over political philosophy in\nmedieval Europe.\n\nAristotle\u2019s Politics was translated into Latin for the\nfirst time in the mid-1260s by William of Moerbeke (Sch\u00fctrumpf\n2014) (An incomplete translation had been made a few years earlier,\npossibly by Moerbeke, and the Nicomachean Ethics, some parts\nof which relate to politics, had been translated by\n Robert Grosseteste\n a little earlier.) Although the Politics did not become part\nof the core curriculum, it was closely studied by many of the leading\nphilosophers of the scholastic period (Fl\u00fceler 1993). Notable\ncommentaries on the Politics were written by Thomas Aquinas\nand Peter of\n Auvergne.[38]\n Ockham drew on their commentaries to give a clear and concise summary\nof Aristotle\u2019s political theory (William of Ockham [c. 1334]\nLetter: 133\u2013143; Lambertini 2000: 269ff.). (For a\nmodern account of the work see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s political theory.)\n\nIdeas which medieval political writers took from Aristotle (or which\nAristotle reinforced) include the following:\n\nIt is natural for human beings to form cities.\n\u201cPolitical\u201d [i.e., city] life is natural to human\n kind.[39]\n On the face of it, this is in conflict with Augustine (see\n \u00a74\n above).\nThe city or state exists not just for security and trade, but to\nfoster the \u201cgood life\u201d, the life according to virtue\n (Politics III.9, 1280 a32\u2013b35).\nSome human beings are slaves \u201cby nature\u201d, i.e., there\nare, or may be, human beings marked out by nature for subordination to\nthe interests of others. Natural slaves are human beings naturally\nlacking in intelligence and in capacity to achieve virtue or\n happiness.[40]\n This conflicted with the thinking of the New Testament (see\n \u00a72.2),\n the lawyers\n (\u00a76)\n and the Stoics and the Fathers of the Church\n (\u00a73).\nWomen should, in general, be ruled by men\n (Politics I.5, 1254 b13).\n The inferiority of women was already the general opinion, but\nAristotle reinforced it, not only by what he said in the\nPolitics but also by his biological theories.\nThere are various forms of government, of which some are good and\nsome are perversions. The good forms seek \u201cthe common\ngood\u201d, i.e., the good of both ruler and ruled. The best is\nkingship, the worst\n tyranny.[41]\n \u201cThe common good\u201d became a basic conception in medieval\npolitical philosophy (Kempshall 1999; McGrade, Kilcullen, and\nKempshall 2001).\nThere is a \u201cbest\u201d regime, the form of government that\nbest fosters the common good. The \u201cideal polity\u201d was not a\ntopic of pre-Aristotelian medieval thought, but it became a common\ntheme (e.g., William of Ockham, Letter: 311\u201323; see\nBlythe 1992).\n\u201cThe rule of law\u201d is better than \u201cthe rule of\n men\u201d,[42]\n i.e., it is better to have rules impartially applied than to leave\nevery decision to the unfettered discretion of the rulers. This\naccorded with the earlier medieval idea that the difference between a\nking and a tyrant is that the king observes the law (see\n \u00a76).\nHowever, since no legislator can foresee every case that may\narise, the rule of law must be tempered by epieikeia,\n\u201cequity\u201d, the making of exceptions to general rules when\nexceptional cases arise\n (Nicomachean Ethics V.10,\n and\n Politics III.16, 1287 a23\u201328, 1287 b15\u201327).\nA good form of government must be stable, not liable to revolution\n (Politics V,\n and\n VI.5).\n Medieval Aristotelians gave some thought to precautions against the\ndegeneration of kingship into\n tyranny.[43]\n Marsilius presents Defensor pacis as a supplement to\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the causes of revolution.\nAlthough Aristotle regarded kingship as ideally best (and medieval\nwriters agreed), Aristotle also gives an argument for\ndemocracy\u2014or, more exactly, an argument that in good government\nthere is a role for ordinary people. If ordinary people deliberate as\na body they may make sound decisions\n (Politics III.11).\n Marsilius (and others) used Aristotle\u2019s remarks to support the\nproposition that the people are the ultimate political authority, an\nidea also found in the Roman law.\nAll of Aristotle\u2019s works supported one of the central\ninstitutions of medieval university life, disputation, in which the\nmaster states opposing positions and supports them with strong\narguments, then evaluates the arguments by criticism. The practice of\ndisputing about important questions, including questions relating to\npolitics, was deeply ingrained in medieval\n culture.[44]\n\n\n",
