    "main_text": "The two sources of morality and religion\n7. The revitalization of Bergsonism\n\nThere are numerous reasons for Bergson\u2019s disappearance from the\nphilosophical scene after World War II. First, at least in France, a\nnew generation of philosophers was arising, in particular, Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty. Like any new generation, this one had to differentiate\nitself from the tradition it was inheriting; in many respects,\nBergson\u2019s thought dominated this tradition. But more important\nwas the fact that Sartre and Merleau-Ponty became interested in\nHusserlian phenomenology, and then in Heidegger\u2019s thought. The\ninfluence of German philosophy on post-World War II French thought is\nwell known. It contributed to the eclipse of Bergson. But, there are\nsome aspects of Bergson\u2019s thought itself which contributed to\nthis eclipse. On the one hand, there is Bergson\u2019s constant\nsuspicion of language; for Bergson, as we noted in the discussion of\nintuition, language is equivalent to symbols. And, symbols divide the\ncontinuity of the duration, leading us into illusions. Bergson\u2019s\ncriticisms of language, moreover, must have struck the generation of\nFrench philosophers who came of age in the 1960s as strange.\nPhilosophers such as Derrida had so thoroughly embraced Heidegger that\nthey believed that \u201clanguage is the house of being.\u201d On\nthe other hand, there is the mysticism of The Two Sources.\nThe striking religious tone of this book did not harmonize well with\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology, which aimed to be a rigorous\nscience.\n\nYet, we can speak of a recent revitalization of Bergsonism.\u00a0 This\nrevitalization is due almost entirely to Deleuze. As we have come to\nunderstand Deleuze\u2019s own thought better, we can see the\noverwhelming influence of Bergson. In particular, two aspects of\nBergson\u2019s thought attracted Deleuze. We have already mentioned\none of them: the concept of multiplicity. This concept is at the very\nheart of Deleuze\u2019s thought, and duration is the model for all of\nDeleuze\u2019s \u201cbecomings.\u201d\u00a0 The other aspect that\nattracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is\nBergson\u2019s criticism of the concept of negation in Creative\nEvolution. We must recall that the linguistic turn in France\nduring the 1960s was accompanied by an \u201canti-Hegelianism.\u201d\nThus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the Hegelian\ndialectic, the negative. Moreover, at the end of his life,\nMerleau-Ponty was also coming to realize that Bergson\u2019s\ncriticism of negation is philosophically important; for Merleau-Ponty,\nthe criticism seemed to function like Husserl\u2019s\n\u201cphenomenological reduction,\u201d and perhaps re-opened what\nHeidegger would call the question of being. But, overall, we must see\nthat a revitalization of Bergsonism became possible because of\nDeleuze\u2019s insistence that Bergsonism is an alternative to the\ndomination of phenomenological thought, including that of Heidegger.\nThe revitalization of Bergsonism leads to a revitalization of the\nquestion of life itself, and not to the retrieval of the question of\nbeing.\n\nIf Deleuze indeed presents a penetrating criticism of Heidegger, it\nlies in the claim that being (Sein) is a unity and not a\nmultiplicity (and in this regard Deleuze\u2019s criticism of\nHeidegger resembles a great deal that of Derrida who always targets\nHeidegger\u2019s idea of gathering [Versammlung]). For\nDeleuze (and perhaps for Derrida as well), the lack of an idea of\nmultiplicity affects Heidegger\u2019s conception of a people. Even if\nthe people in Heidegger are still coming, they will have a proper name\nthat indicates their community will be unified and perhaps closed. In\ncontrast. the people to come in Deleuze (and the democracy to come in\nDerrida) remain in need of a name which indicates that this people is\na genuine multiplicity. Perhaps in these ideas of an always still to\nbe named coming community, we find the enduring influence of\nBergson\u2019s \u201copen society.\u201d The most recent moment of\nthe Bergson revitalization follows on the idea of a people. Andrea J.\nPitts and Mark William Westmoreland published a volume called:\nBeyond Bergson: Exploring Race, Gender, and Colonialism through\nthe Writings of Henri Bergson (SUNY 2019).\n\nApart from Deleuze, and more recently, Frederic Worms has led the way\ntoward Bergson\u2019s revitalization in France. Worms founded the\nSociete des amis de Bergson in 2006. In 2019, several members of the\nSociete des amis de Bergson founded the Global Bergson Research\nProject whose purpose lies in rediscovering Bergson\u2019s influence\nall over the globe.\n",
