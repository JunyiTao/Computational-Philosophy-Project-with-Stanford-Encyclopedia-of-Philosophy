    "main_text": "The Bias-Variance Trade-off\n4. The Bias-Variance Trade-off\n\nThe bias-variance trade-off refers to a particular\ndecomposition of overall prediction error for an estimator into its\ncentral tendency (bias) and dispersion (variance). Sometimes overall\nerror can be reduced by increasing bias in order to reduce variance,\nor vice versa, effectively trading an increase in one type of error to\nafford a comparatively larger reduction in the other. To give an\nintuitive example, suppose your goal is to minimize your score with\nrespect to the following targets.\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n[An extended description of this figure is in the supplement.]\n \n\n\nIdeally, you would prefer a procedure for delivering your\n\u201cshots\u201d that had both a low bias and low variance. Absent\nthat, and given the choice between a low bias and high variance\nprocedure versus a high bias and low variance procedure, you would\npresumably prefer the latter procedure if it returned a lower overall\nscore than the former, which is true of the corresponding figures\nabove. Although a decision maker\u2019s learning algorithm ideally\nshould have low bias and low variance, in practice it is common that the\nreduction in one type of error yields some increase in the other. In\nthis section we explain the conditions under which the relationship\nbetween expected squared loss of an estimator and its bias and\nvariance holds and then remark on the role that the bias-variance\ntrade-off plays in research on bounded rationality.\n",
