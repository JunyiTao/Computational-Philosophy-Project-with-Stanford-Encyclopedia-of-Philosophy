A married bachelor is an impossibility, a contradiction in\nterms. A man who in fact lived his life as a bachelor could have\n(instead) married, but if he had, his bachelor status would\nimmediately have ceased. The scenario is thus not one involving a\nmarried bachelor, but merely one where a particular person, actually a\nbachelor, gets married instead.\n\nThis is a separate topic from that of the previous section, since\nnecessity and the a priori can come apart. Consider the claim\nthat the nucleus of an atom of gold contains 79 protons. This claim is\nnot a priori. It is the fruit of an empirical inquiry into\nthe nature of gold, and could certainly not have been deduced from the\nmeaning of \u201cgold\u201d. It is, however, a necessary truth\n(Kripke 1980: 123\u2013125). The nature of gold is, in this respect,\nimmutable. If you added or subtracted protons from the nucleus, you\nwould no longer have an atom of gold, but some other element\ninstead.\n\nConsider once more the view that \u201cSocrates\u201d means the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon. Does it similarly predict a\nnecessary connection between being Socrates and being the teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon? Is it committed to the impossibility of a Socrates\nwho never taught? If so, the view would seem to be in trouble. For it\nappears a contingent fact\u2014one that could have been\notherwise\u2014that Socrates taught Plato (Searle 1958: 172; Kripke\n1980: 74). Socrates could, after all, have died in infancy; or else\nlived, but declined to take on his most famous pupil.\n\nNote that \u201cSocrates\u201d is a referring expression, while\n\u201cbachelor\u201d is a nominal predicate. In carrying over the\nanalogy from \u201cbachelor\u201d, we had to convert\n\u201cSocrates\u201d into a predicate (\u201cbeing\nSocrates\u201d). This was because the necessity we observed for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d involved the co-instantiation of\nproperties\u2014one can\u2019t be a bachelor without\nbeing unmarried (compare Dummett 1973: 131). But it may be\nthat referring expressions relate to their meanings in a different way\nto predicates\u2014one that implies no necessary co-instantiation of\nproperties. Indeed, we will find that this is the case, for at least\none sort of referring expression, in\n Section 2.5.\n\nA different test using modal sentences relies on the assumption that\nsynonymous expressions should be substitutable salva veritate\nin modal contexts. To agree to this, we don\u2019t have to think that\nthe meaning of an expression corresponds to its truth-conditional\ncontribution; only that, in identical linguistic contexts, synonymous\nexpressions will make (or are likely to make) the same contribution.\n(Keep in mind that synonymous expressions are certainly not\nsubstitutable salva veritate in all contexts. Substituting\n\u201cman who has never been married\u201d for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d might change the truth-value of an attitude\nreport if the attitude holder is ignorant of the meaning of\n\u201cbachelor.\u201d)\n\nAs it turns out, \u201cSocrates\u201d and \u201cthe teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon\u201d cannot be substituted salva\nveritate in modal contexts (compare Kripke 1980:\n40\u201342):\n\n(3) The teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon might not have been human.\n(4) Socrates might not\nhave been human.\n\n\nIf we consider that Plato and Xenophon could have been raised by\nwolves, (3) sounds true, while (4) remains false. Thus, if we agree\nthat synonyms should substitute in this context,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d cannot mean the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon.\n\nHowever, observe that (3) also has a (false) reading on which it says\nroughly the same thing as (4), referring to a particular man, rather\nthan generalizing over teachers of Plato and Xenophon. (A competing\nexplanation is that \u201cSocrates\u201d is lexically univocal, but\ngives rise to a structural ambiguity, being analyzed as a scope-taking\nexpression\u2014see Russell 1905; Neale 1990. Note, however, that\nthis approach doesn\u2019t lend itself as well to the defense of our\ndescriptivist hypothesis. Such a defense needs to claim that names,\nperhaps similarly to the quantifier \u201ceach\u201d, gravitate\ntowards the widest possible scope in the sentence\u2014see Dummett\n1981: Ch.9; Soames 1998; and Sosa 2001 for further discussion of this\nproposal.)\n\nFollowing Rothschild (2007) and Nichols (in unpublished work; see\n other internet resources),\n we could say that while the name \u201cSocrates\u201d refers to an\nindividual, the definite description \u201cthe teacher of Plato and\nXenophon\u201d can refer either to that same individual, or else to a\nparticular role\u2014namely, that of teacher to Plato and Xenophon.\nWhen understood in the second way, (3) means something like \u201cThe\nrole of teacher to Plato and Xenophon might have been filled by a\nnon-human\u201d. This parallels the fact that \u201ctiger\u201d has\na taxonomic reading on which it applies to kinds alongside the more\nstandard reading on which it applies to individual animals, so that\n\u201cthe tiger\u201d can refer to either the kind or some\nparticular tiger.\n\nSupposing that definite descriptions can refer to roles would explain\ntheir different behavior in modal sentences without threatening the\nidea that a name could be synonymous with a definite description on\nits non-role reading. Still, the foregoing reflections offer no\nfurther help in interpreting the claim that \u201cSocrates\u201d\nmeans the teacher of Plato and Xenophon. The claim\ncan\u2019t simply be that \u201cSocrates\u201d and \u201cthe\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon\u201d corefer. Even one who denies a\nmeaning to \u201cSocrates\u201d admits this. But if there are no\ndetectable modal consequences of a name\u2019s having some meaning,\nin what other substantial sense should this possession be\nunderstood?\n",
