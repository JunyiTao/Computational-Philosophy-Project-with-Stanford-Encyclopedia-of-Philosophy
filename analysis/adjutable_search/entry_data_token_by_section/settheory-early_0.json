    "main_text": "Emergence\n1. Emergence\n\nThe concept of a set appears deceivingly simple, at least to the\ntrained mathematician, and to such an extent that it becomes difficult\nto judge and appreciate correctly the contributions of the pioneers.\nWhat cost them much effort to produce, and took the mathematical\ncommunity considerable time to accept, may seem to us rather\nself-explanatory or even trivial. Three historical misconceptions that\nare widespread in the literature should be noted at the outset: \n\n It is not the case that actual infinity was universally rejected\nbefore Cantor. \n Set-theoretic views did not arise exclusively from analysis, but\nemerged also in algebra, number theory, and geometry. \n In fact, the rise of set-theoretic mathematics preceded\nCantor\u2019s crucial contributions. \n\n\nAll of these points shall become clear in what follows.\n\nThe notion of a collection is as old as counting, and logical ideas\nabout classes have existed since at least the \u201ctree of\nPorphyry\u201d (3rd century CE). Thus it becomes difficult\nto sort out the origins of the concept of set. But sets are neither\ncollections in the everyday sense of this word, nor\n\u201cclasses\u201d in the sense of logicians before the\nmid-19th century. The key missing element is objecthood\n\u2014 a set is a mathematical object, to be operated upon just like\nany other object (the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is as much \u2018a\nthing\u2019 as number 3). To clarify this point, Russell employed the\nuseful distinction between a class-as-many (this is the traditional\nidea) and a class-as-one (or set). \n\nErnst Zermelo, a crucial figure in our\nstory, said that the theory had historically been \u201ccreated by\nCantor and Dedekind\u201d [Zermelo 1908, 262]. This suggests a good\npragmatic criterion: one should start from authors who have\nsignificantly influenced the conceptions of Cantor, Dedekind, and\nZermelo. For the most part, this is the criterion adopted here.\nNevertheless, as every rule calls for an exception, the case of\nBolzano is important and instructive, even though Bolzano did not\nsignificantly influence later writers.\n\nIn 19th century German-speaking areas, there were some\nintellectual tendencies that promoted the acceptance of the actual\ninfinite (e.g., a revival of Leibniz\u2019s thought). In spite of\nGauss\u2019s warning that the infinite can only be a manner of\nspeaking, some minor figures and three major ones (Bolzano, Riemann,\nDedekind) preceded Cantor in fully accepting the actual infinite in\nmathematics. Those three authors were active in promoting a\nset-theoretic formulation of mathematical ideas, with Dedekind\u2019s\ncontribution in a good number of classic writings (1871, 1872,\n1876/77, 1888) being of central importance.\n\nChronologically, Bernard Bolzano was the first, but he exerted almost\nno influence. The high quality of his work in logic and the\nfoundations of mathematics is well known. A book entitled\nParadoxien des Unendlichen was posthumously published in\n1851. Here Bolzano argued in detail that a host of paradoxes\nsurrounding infinity are logically harmless, and mounted a forceful\ndefence of actual infinity. He proposed an interesting argument\nattempting to prove the existence of infinite sets, which bears\ncomparison with Dedekind\u2019s later argument (1888). Although he\nemployed complicated distinctions of different kinds of sets or\nclasses, Bolzano recognized clearly the possibility of putting two\ninfinite sets in one-to-one correspondence, as one can easily do,\ne.g., with the intervals \\([0, 5]\\) and \\([0, 12]\\) by the function\n\\(5y = 12x\\). However, Bolzano resisted the conclusion that both sets\nare \u201cequal with respect to the multiplicity of their\nparts\u201d [1851, 30\u201331]. In all likelihood, traditional ideas\nof measurement were still too powerful in his way of thinking, and\nthus he missed the discovery of the concept of cardinality (however,\none may consider Non-Cantorian ideas, on which see Mancosu 2009). \n\nThe case of Bolzano suggests that a liberation from metric concepts\n(which came with the development of theories of projective geometry\nand especially of topology) was to have a crucial role in making\npossible the abstract viewpoint of set theory. Bernhard Riemann\nproposed visionary ideas about topology, and about basing all of\nmathematics on the notion of set or \u201cmanifold\u201d in the\nsense of class (Mannigfaltigkeit), in his celebrated\ninaugural lecture \u201cOn the Hypotheses which lie at the\nFoundations of Geometry\u201d (1854/1868a). Also characteristic of\nRiemann was a great emphasis on conceptual mathematics,\nparticularly visible in his approach to complex analysis (which again\nwent deep into topology). To give but the simplest example, Riemann\nwas an enthusiastic follower of Dirichlet\u2019s idea that a function\nhas to be conceived as an arbitrary correspondence between\nnumerical values, be it representable by a formula or not; this meant\nleaving behind the times when a function was defined to be an analytic\nexpression. Through this new style of mathematics, and through his\nvision of a new role for sets and a full program for developing\ntopology, Riemann was a crucial influence on both Dedekind and\nCantor (see Ferreir\u00f3s 1999).\n\nThe five-year period 1868\u20131872 saw a mushrooming of\nset-theoretic proposals in Germany, so much so that we could regard it\nas the birth of set-theoretic mathematics. Riemann\u2019s geometry\nlecture, delivered in 1854, was published by Dedekind in 1868, jointly\nwith Riemann\u2019s paper on trigonometric series (1854/1868b, which\npresented the Riemann integral). The latter was the starting point for\ndeep work in real analysis, commencing the study of\n\u201cseriously\u201d discontinuous functions. The young Georg\nCantor entered into this area, which led him to the study of\npoint-sets. In 1872 Cantor introduced an operation upon point sets\n(see below) and soon he was ruminating about the possibility to\niterate that operation to infinity and beyond: it was the first\nglimpse of the transfinite realm.\n\nMeanwhile, another major development had been put forward by Richard\nDedekind in 1871. In the context of his work on algebraic number\ntheory, Dedekind introduced an essentially set-theoretic viewpoint,\ndefining fields and ideals of algebraic numbers. These ideas were\npresented in a very mature form, making use of set operations and of\nstructure-preserving mappings (see a relevant passage in\nFerreir\u00f3s 1999: 92\u201393; Cantor employed Dedekind\u2019s\nterminology for the operations in his own work on set theory around\n1880 [1999: 204]). Considering the ring of integers in a given field\nof algebraic numbers, Dedekind defined certain subsets called\n\u201cideals\u201d and operated on these sets as new objects. This\nprocedure was the key to his general approach to the topic. In other\nworks, he dealt very clearly and precisely with equivalence relations,\npartition sets, homomorphisms, and automorphisms (on the history of\nequivalence relations, see Asghari \u200e2018). Thus, many of the usual\nset-theoretic procedures of twentieth-century mathematics go back to\nhis work. Several years later (in 1888), Dedekind would publish a\npresentation of the basic elements of set theory, making only a bit\nmore explicit the operations on sets and mappings he had been using\nsince 1871.\n\nThe following year, Dedekind published a paper [1872] in which he\nprovided an axiomatic analysis of the structure of the set\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of real numbers. He defined it as an ordered field\nthat is also complete (in the sense that all Dedekind-cuts on\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) correspond to an element in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\));\ncompleteness in that sense has the Archimedean axiom as a consequence.\nCantor too provided a definition of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) in 1872,\nemploying Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, which was an elegant\nsimplification of the definition offered by Carl Weierstrass in his\nlectures. The form of completeness axiom that Weierstrass preferred\nwas Bolzano\u2019s principle that a sequence of nested closed\nintervals in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) (a sequence such that\n\\([a_{m+1},b_{m+1}] \\subset [a_{m},b_{m}]\\)) \u201ccontains\u201d at\nleast one real number (or, as we would say, has a non-empty\nintersection).\n\nThe Cantor and Dedekind definitions of the real numbers relied\nimplicitly on set theory, and can be seen in retrospect to involve the\nassumption of a Power Set principle. Both took as given the set of\nrational numbers, and for the definition of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) they relied\non a certain totality of infinite sets of rational numbers (either the\ntotality of Cauchy sequences, or of all Dedekind cuts). With this,\ntoo, constructivistic criticism of set theory began to emerge, as\nLeopold Kronecker started to make objections to such infinitary\nprocedures. Simultaneously, there began a study of the topology of\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\), in particular in the work of Weierstrass, Dedekind,\nand Cantor. The set-theoretic approach was also exploited by several\nauthors in the fields of real analysis and complex analysis (e.g.,\nHankel, du Bois-Reymond, H.J.S. Smith, U. Dini) and by Dedekind in\njoint work with Weber (1882), pioneering algebraic geometry.\n\nCantor\u2019s derived sets are of particular interest (for the\ncontext of this idea in real analysis, see e.g., Dauben 1979, Hallett\n1984, Lavine 1994, Kanamori 1996, Ferreir\u00f3s 1999). Cantor took\nas given the \u201cconceptual sphere\u201d of the real numbers, and\nhe considered arbitrary subsets \\(P\\), which he called\n\u2018point sets\u2019. A real number \\(r\\) is called a\nlimit point of \\(P\\), when all neighbourhoods of \\(r\\)\ncontain points of \\(P\\). This can only happen if \\(P\\) is\ninfinite. With that concept, due to Weierstrass, Cantor went on to\ndefine the derived set \\(P'\\) of \\(P\\), as the set of\nall the limit points of \\(P\\). In general \\(P'\\) may be infinite\nand have its own limit points (see Cantor\u2019s paper in Ewald\n[1996, vol. 2, 840ff], esp. p. 848). Thus one can iterate the\noperation and obtain further derived sets \\(P''\\), \\(P'''\\)\u2026\n\\(P^{(n)}\\) \u2026 It is easy to give examples of a set \\(P\\) that\nwill give rise to non-empty derived sets \\(P^{(n)}\\) for all finite\n\\(n\\). (A rather trivial example is \\(P = \\mathbf{Q}_{[0,1]}\\), the\nset of rational numbers in the unit interval; in this case \\(P' =\n[0,1] = P''\\).) Thus one can define \\(P^{(\\infty)}\\) as the\nintersection of all \\(P^{(n)}\\) for finite \\(n\\). This was\nCantor\u2019s first encounter with transfinite iterations.\n\nThen, in late 1873, came a surprising discovery that fully opened the\nrealm of the transfinite. In correspondence with Dedekind (see Ewald\n1996, vol. 2), Cantor asked the question whether the infinite sets\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of the natural numbers and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of\nreal numbers can be placed in one-to-one correspondence. In reply,\nDedekind offered a surprising proof that the set \\(A\\) of all\nalgebraic numbers is denumerable (i.e., there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence with \\(\\mathbf{N}\\)). A few days later, Cantor was\nable to prove that the assumption that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is\ndenumerable leads to a contradiction. To this end, he employed the\nBolzano-Weierstrass principle of completeness mentioned above. Thus he\nhad shown that there are more elements in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) than in\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) or \\(A\\), in the precise\nsense that the cardinality of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is strictly greater\nthan that of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n",
