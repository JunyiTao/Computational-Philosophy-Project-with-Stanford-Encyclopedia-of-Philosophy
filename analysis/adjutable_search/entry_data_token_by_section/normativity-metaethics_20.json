First, where\nK is a functional kind, a good K is one that\nperforms the function well. A good toaster does well at toasting\nbread. A good printer is one that prints well. And the criteria for\nperforming well are naturalistically specifiable in line with the\npurpose of the relevant kind of thing. Second, where K is a\nbiological kind, the things needed by Ks in order to flourish\nare good for Ks. Water and sunlight are good for oak trees,\nfor example. And for a K to flourish is for it to do well at\nliving the kind of life for which it is suited. It is good for a\ncheetah to be able to run fast. It is good for an oak tree to produce\nabundant acorns. These ideas have been used and extended by several\nphilosophers, including Philippa Foot (2001) and Judith Thomson (2008)\nin developing theories of normativity.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward of these theories is Foot\u2019s\nproposal that the virtues of human beings are the general\npsychological properties needed by humans to thrive in living the kind\nof life that we do. Just as it is good for a wolf to be able to fit\ninto the pack, it is good for a human to be sociable \u2013 to be\ncharitable, honest, trustworthy, and so on. For Foot, the virtues are\ngrounded in the distinctive kind of life human beings have, which is\nnot to say they are grounded in our species membership. Any agent that\nlived this kind of life would have the same virtues, regardless of the\nagent\u2019s species. So, for Foot, human goodness is merely\nanalogous to the good for the wolf and the cheetah. For Paul\nBloomfield, however, there is more than merely an analogy. He develops\na theory that is similar to Foot\u2019s, but one that rests on the\nnature of our species and on what members of the species need in order\nto achieve their natural function (2001, 2014, forthcoming).\n\nViews of this kind are examples of mind-independent normative realism\nand of reductive normative naturalism. They can be seen as\nneo-Aristotelian, and they have been developed chiefly, although not\nexclusively, in tandem with virtue theories. For discussion, see\nFitzpatrick 2014 as well as entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology \n and\n virtue ethics.\n\nThere are things to worry about in theories of this kind. If a person\nis thriving even though she does not have the psychological properties\nthat are generally needed in order to thrive, one might think\nshe need have no reason to change. If a person is not living in\ntypical conditions for a human, it is not clear that it would be good\nfor her to have the psychological properties that are\ngenerally needed in order to thrive. This might actually be\nbad for her.\n",
