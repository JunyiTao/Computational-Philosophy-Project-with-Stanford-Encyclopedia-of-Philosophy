    "main_text": "Practical Reason:  Intentions, Rules, and Normativity || The Logic of Intentions\n7.1 The Logic of Intentions\nEpistemology tries to make intelligible the acquisition, growth,\nand change of belief.  It thus tends to focus on the input to and\ninternal interactions of our cognitive states.  Action theory, in\ncontrast, focuses on the output side, accounting for the\nintelligibility of action.  Sellars has a sophisticated and systematic\napproach to action theory, metaethics, and normativity that has not been widely\nappreciated. \nThe central problem is understanding the relation between belief and action.  Normative judgments, e.g., judgments about what\u2019s good or what\u2019s right, are supposed to bridge the apparent gap between what one believes is the case and what one does to transform the world.  Normative judgments thus need to interface smoothly with our beliefs, because we often seem to reason to our normative judgments and use them in reasoning further to our decisions to act. They must also, however, motivate action in a way that mere belief cannot.  In mid-20th century philosophy, cognitivists emphasized practical reasoning, while non-cognitivists focused rather on the practical, that is, the motivational aspect of norms. According to the cognitivists, normative and especially ethical claims are truth-evaluable and participate in the same kinds of logical relations as other truth-evaluable claims.  Cognitivists were thus in a position to attack the problem of how ethical and other normative claims function in our practical reasoning, but they had difficulty saying how normative beliefs are any more deeply connected to action than other beliefs.  Non-cognitivists, in contrast, denied that ethical and normative claims are, in general, truth-evaluable.  Their role, instead, is to motivate, either encouraging or discouraging particular actions.  That role does not require truth-evaluability.  One of Sellars\u2019 teachers was C. L. Stevenson, who proposed that ethical judgments are actually expressions of pro or con attitudes towards actions, a position that came to be known as emotivism.  Sellars also paid close attention to the metaethics of R. M. Hare, who proposed that normative statements be analyzed as imperatives, commanding or forbidding an action. But Sellars believed that there is no logic of imperatives, so Hare\u2019s analysis could not capture the role norms play in our practical reasoning.  \nInstead, Sellars proposes an analysis of norms in which the central role is played by the notion of an intention.  An\nintention is a thought that motivates one to realize its content.\n\u2018I shall eat a light dinner later\u2019 can be a mere\nprediction (suppose, e.g., that I know my cupboards are bare), but it\ncan also express my intention, in which case it has motivational force\nwithin my behavioral control system.  A volition is an intention that\nhas come to fruition: it has an intentional content but also causally affects my behavior: \u2018I shall eat a light\ndinner now\u2019 expresses my volition and is usually\naccompanied by at least the first stirrings of activity. \nExpressing an intention or volition is not the same as\n(self-)ascribing, an intention or volition, nor are such expressions\ndescriptions of intentions or predictions of action.  Expressions of\nintention are always first-personal in form and essentially tied to\nmotivational force.  Sellars reserves \u2018shall\u2019 to serve as\nan operator-like marker of intention expressions, and this convention\nwill be observed here as well.  Sellars recognizes two forms of\n\u2018shall\u2019-statements: \u2018I shall do A\u2019 and\n\u2018It shall be the case that p\u2019.  \u2018Shall\nbe\u2019s\u2019 must ultimately imply \u2018shall\u2019s with\ndirect implications for action, even if they are highly conditioned on\nother circumstances. \nSellars wrote extensively on the logic of intentions, for \u201cAn\nideally rational being would intend the implications of his\nintentions, just as he would believe the implications of his\nbeliefs\u201d (SM VII \u00a716: 183). The major principle governing intentions is \nPLI: \u2018Shall (A)\u2019 implies \u2018Shall\n(B)\u2019 iff \u2018A\u2019 implies\n\u2018B\u2019.\nThis principle, note, is in the metalanguage in which we talk about intentions, not in the object language in which we express intentions. Sellars also stipulates that logical connectives and operators can\noccur inside the scope of a \u2018shall\u2019 operator, but not\noutside it.  This is because \u2018shall\u2019 statements are\nconstrued as expressions of intentions.  \nShall [I will not do A]\nexpresses a negative intention \u2014 the intention to refrain\nfrom doing A.  But there is no expression of the lack of an\nintention to do A, so\nNot shall [I will do A] \nis ruled out as nonsensical, though, of course, one\ncan describe oneself as lacking the intention to do A.  A\ndescription of an intention, however, is different from an expression\nof it. For Sellars, \u201cThe implications pertaining to matters of fact concern only the content of intentions and not their status as intentions\u201d (ORAV \u00b652: 86), so the practical reasoning involving intentions must focus on the content of those intentions.  \nSellars invokes a principle that governs how the facts of the world\nare to be taken up into our practical reasoning.  He calls it\n\u201cSo-be-it\u201d:\nSo-be-it: \u201cShall be [\u03c6]\u201d and\n\u201cp\u201d imply \u201cShall be [\u03c6\nand p]\u201d where \u2018\u03c6\u2019 is a formula which may\nor may not be logically complex (ORAV \u00b666: 88).\nSellars needs a principle like this, since logical connectives (by his stipulation) cannot show up outside the scope of a \u2018shall,\u2019 implications can be drawn only within the scope of a \u2018shall,\u2019 so practical reasoning is viewed in terms of the compounding and simplification of the contents of one\u2019s intentions. \nTo use \u201cSo-be-it\u201d properly, one must be able to\ndistinguish between what is \u201cup to one\u201d, symbolized by \u2018[\u03c6]\u2019, and what is not, captured in the symbolism by \u2018p\u2019.\nA fairly straightforward picture of practical reasoning emerges.\n\n94. Thus C[onjunction] I[ntroduction] together with\nSo-be-it, takes our separate purposes and relevant beliefs and puts\nthem together into encompassing alternatives:\n\nShall be [I do A at t, which means that \u2026]?\nShall be [I do B at t, which means that \u2026]?\nShall be [I do C at t, which means that \u2026]?\n\nThe successive steps are\n\nelaboration by CI and So-be-it, and the drawing of\nimplications\nchoice, e.g. (2), or, continuing indecision\nsimplification. Shall be [I do B at t]\nintention to act. Shall [I do B at t]\n\nwhich, when time t comes (and I do not change my mind), generates\na doing (or an attempt to do) B.\n95. This picture is one according to which practical reasoning is\nessentially the process of elaborating alternative scenarios for a\nchoice (ORAV \u00b694: 91).\n\nClearly, the elaboration of alternatives is a rational process.  Is\nmaking the ultimate choice among these alternatives also a matter of\nreason?  In what sense is the choice among fully elaborated\nalternatives anything other than an arbitrary, personal choice?  For\nanswers, we need to look at Sellars\u2019s views on the nature of\noughts and the normativity they express.\n",
