What Is Intrinsic Value?\n\nThe concept of intrinsic value has been characterized above in terms\nof the value that something has \u201cin itself,\u201d or \u201cfor\nits own sake,\u201d or \u201cas such,\u201d or \u201cin its own\nright.\u201d The custom has been not to distinguish between the\nmeanings of these terms, but we will see that there is reason to think\nthat there may in fact be more than one concept at issue here. For the\nmoment, though, let us ignore this complication and focus on what it\nmeans to say that something is valuable for its own sake as\nopposed to being valuable for the sake of something else to\nwhich it is related in some way. Perhaps it is easiest to grasp this\ndistinction by way of illustration.\n\nSuppose that someone were to ask you whether it is good to help others\nin time of need. Unless you suspected some sort of trick, you would\nanswer, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d If this person were to go on to\nask you why acting in this way is good, you might say that it is good\nto help others in time of need simply because it is good that their\nneeds be satisfied. If you were then asked why it is good that\npeople\u2019s needs be satisfied, you might be puzzled. You might be\ninclined to say, \u201cIt just is.\u201d Or you might accept the\nlegitimacy of the question and say that it is good that people\u2019s\nneeds be satisfied because this brings them pleasure. But then, of\ncourse, your interlocutor could ask once again, \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngood about that?\u201d Perhaps at this point you would answer,\n\u201cIt just is good that people be pleased,\u201d and thus put an\nend to this line of questioning. Or perhaps you would again seek to\nexplain the fact that it is good that people be pleased in terms of\nsomething else that you take to be good. At some point, though, you\nwould have to put an end to the questions, not because you would have\ngrown tired of them (though that is a distinct possibility), but\nbecause you would be forced to recognize that, if one thing derives\nits goodness from some other thing, which derives its goodness from\nyet a third thing, and so on, there must come a point at which you\nreach something whose goodness is not derivative in this way,\nsomething that \u201cjust is\u201d good in its own right, something\nwhose goodness is the source of, and thus explains, the goodness to be\nfound in all the other things that precede it on the list. It is at\nthis point that you will have arrived at intrinsic goodness (cf.\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1094a). That which is\nintrinsically good is nonderivatively good; it is good for its\nown sake. That which is not intrinsically good but\nextrinsically good is derivatively good; it is good, not (insofar as\nits extrinsic value is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake\nof something else that is good and to which it is related in some way.\nIntrinsic value thus has a certain priority over extrinsic value. The\nlatter is derivative from or reflective of the former and is to be\nexplained in terms of the former. It is for this reason that\nphilosophers have tended to focus on intrinsic value in\nparticular.\n\nThe account just given of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value is rough, but it should do as a start. Certain\ncomplications must be immediately acknowledged, though. First, there\nis the possibility, mentioned above, that the terms traditionally used\nto refer to intrinsic value in fact refer to more than one concept;\nagain, this will be addressed later (in this section and the next).\nAnother complication is that it may not in fact be accurate to say\nthat whatever is intrinsically good is nonderivatively good; some\nintrinsic value may be derivative. This issue will be taken up (in\nSection 5) when the computation of intrinsic value is discussed; it\nmay be safely ignored for now. Still another complication is this. It\nis almost universally acknowledged among philosophers that all value\nis \u201csupervenient\u201d or \u201cgrounded in\u201d on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value. Roughly, what this\nmeans is that, if something has value, it will have this value in\nvirtue of certain nonevaluative features that it has; its value can be\nattributed to these features.  For example, the value of helping\nothers in time of need might be attributed to the fact that such\nbehavior has the feature of being causally related to certain pleasant\nexperiences induced in those who receive the help. Suppose we accept\nthis and accept also that the experiences in question are\nintrinsically good. In saying this, we are (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) taking the value of the experiences to\nbe nonderivative. Nonetheless, we may well take this value, like all\nvalue, to be supervenient on, or grounded in, something. In this case,\nwe would probably simply attribute the value of the experiences to\ntheir having the feature of being pleasant. This brings out the subtle\nbut important point that the question whether some value is derivative\nis distinct from the question whether it is supervenient. Even\nnonderivative value (value that something has in its own right; value\nthat is, in some way, not attributable to the value of\nanything else) is usually understood to be supervenient on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value (and thus to be\nattributable, in a different way, to these features).\n\nTo repeat: whatever is intrinsically good is (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) nonderivatively good. It would be a\nmistake, however, to affirm the converse of this and say that whatever\nis nonderivatively good is intrinsically good. As \u201cintrinsic\nvalue\u201d is traditionally understood, it refers to a\nparticular way of being nonderivatively good; there are other\nways in which something might be nonderivatively good. For example,\nsuppose that your interlocutor were to ask you whether it is good to\neat and drink in moderation and to exercise regularly. Again, you\nwould say, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d If asked why, you would say\nthat this is because such behavior promotes health. If asked what is\ngood about being healthy, you might cite something else whose goodness\nwould explain the value of health, or you might simply say,\n\u201cBeing healthy just is a good way to be.\u201d If the latter\nwere your response, you would be indicating that you took health to be\nnonderivatively good in some way. In what way, though? Well, perhaps\nyou would be thinking of health as intrinsically good. But perhaps\nnot. Suppose that what you meant was that being healthy just is\n\u201cgood for\u201d the person who is healthy (in the sense that it\nis in each person\u2019s interest to be healthy), so that\nJohn\u2019s being healthy is good for John, Jane\u2019s being\nhealthy is good for Jane, and so on. You would thereby be attributing\na type of nonderivative interest-value to John\u2019s being healthy,\nand yet it would be perfectly consistent for you to deny that\nJohn\u2019s being healthy is intrinsically good. If John\nwere a villain, you might well deny this. Indeed, you might want to\ninsist that, in light of his villainy, his being healthy is\nintrinsically bad, even though you recognize that his being\nhealthy is good for him. If you did say this, you would be\nindicating that you subscribe to the common view that intrinsic value\nis nonderivative value of some peculiarly moral\n sort.[2]\n\nLet us now see whether this still rough account of intrinsic value can\nbe made more precise. One of the first writers to concern himself with\nthe question of what exactly is at issue when we ascribe intrinsic\nvalue to something was G. E. Moore [1873\u20131958]. In his book\nPrincipia Ethica, Moore asks whether the concept of intrinsic\nvalue (or, more particularly, the concept of intrinsic goodness, upon\nwhich he tended to focus) is analyzable. In raising this question, he\nhas a particular type of analysis in mind, one which consists in\n\u201cbreaking down\u201d a concept into simpler component concepts.\n(One example of an analysis of this sort is the analysis of the\nconcept of being a vixen in terms of the concepts of being a fox and\nbeing female.) His own answer to the question is that the concept of\nintrinsic goodness is not amenable to such analysis (Moore\n1903, ch. 1). In place of analysis, Moore proposes a certain kind of\nthought-experiment in order both to come to understand the concept\nbetter and to reach a decision about what is intrinsically good. He\nadvises us to consider what things are such that, if they existed by\nthemselves \u201cin absolute isolation,\u201d we would judge their\nexistence to be good; in this way, we will be better able to see what\nreally accounts for the value that there is in our world. For example,\nif such a thought-experiment led you to conclude that all and only\npleasure would be good in isolation, and all and only pain bad, you\nwould be a\n hedonist.[3]\n Moore himself deems it incredible that anyone, thinking clearly,\nwould reach this conclusion. He says that it involves our saying that\na world in which only pleasure existed\u2014a world without any\nknowledge, love, enjoyment of beauty, or moral qualities\u2014is\nbetter than a world that contained all these things but in which there\nexisted slightly less pleasure (Moore 1912, p. 102). Such a view he\nfinds absurd.\n\nRegardless of the merits of this isolation test, it remains unclear\nexactly why Moore finds the concept of intrinsic goodness to be\nunanalyzable. At one point he attacks the view that it can be analyzed\nwholly in terms of \u201cnatural\u201d concepts\u2014the view, that\nis, that we can break down the concept of being intrinsically good\ninto the simpler concepts of being A, being B, being\nC\u2026, where these component concepts are all purely\ndescriptive rather than evaluative. (One candidate that Moore\ndiscusses is this: for something to be intrinsically good is for it to\nbe something that we desire to desire.) He argues that any such\nanalysis is to be rejected, since it will always be intelligible to\nask whether (and, presumably, to deny that) it is good that something\nbe A, B, C,\u2026, which would not be the\ncase if the analysis were accurate (Moore 1903, pp. 15\u201316). Even\nif this argument is successful (a complicated matter about which there\nis considerable disagreement), it of course does not establish the\nmore general claim that the concept of intrinsic goodness is not\nanalyzable at all, since it leaves open the possibility that this\nconcept is analyzable in terms of other concepts, some or all of which\nare not \u201cnatural\u201d but evaluative. Moore apparently thinks\nthat his objection works just as well where one or more of the\ncomponent concepts A, B, C,\u2026, is\nevaluative; but, again, many dispute the cogency of his argument.\nIndeed, several philosophers have proposed analyses of just this sort.\nFor example, Roderick Chisholm [1916\u20131999] has argued that\nMoore\u2019s own isolation test in fact provides the basis for an\nanalysis of the concept of intrinsic value. He formulates a view\naccording to which (to put matters roughly) to say that a state of\naffairs is intrinsically good or bad is to say that it is possible\nthat its goodness or badness constitutes all the goodness or badness\nthat there is in the world (Chisholm 1978). \n\nEva Bodanszky and Earl Conee have attacked Chisholm\u2019s proposal,\nshowing that it is, in its details, unacceptable (Bodanszky and Conee\n1981). However, the general idea that an intrinsically valuable state\nis one that could somehow account for all the value in the world is\nsuggestive and promising; if it could be adequately formulated, it\nwould reveal an important feature of intrinsic value that would help\nus better understand the concept. We will return to this point in\nSection 5. Rather than pursue such a line of thought, Chisholm himself\nresponded (Chisholm 1981) in a different way to Bodanszky and Conee.\nHe shifted from what may be called an ontological version of\nMoore\u2019s isolation test\u2014the attempt to understand the\nintrinsic value of a state in terms of the value that there would be\nif it were the only valuable state in existence\u2014to an\nintentional version of that test\u2014the attempt to\nunderstand the intrinsic value of a state in terms of the kind of\nattitude it would be fitting to have if one were to\ncontemplate the valuable state as such, without reference to\ncircumstances or consequences.\n\nThis new analysis in fact reflects a general idea that has a rich\nhistory. Franz Brentano [1838\u20131917], C. D. Broad\n[1887\u20131971], W. D. Ross [1877\u20131971], and A. C. Ewing\n[1899\u20131973], among others, have claimed, in a more or less\nqualified way, that the concept of intrinsic goodness is analyzable in\nterms of the fittingness of some \u201cpro\u201d (i.e., positive)\nattitude (Brentano 1969, p. 18; Broad 1930, p. 283; Ross 1939, pp.\n275\u201376; Ewing 1948, p. 152). Such an analysis, which has come to\nbe called \u201cthe fitting attitude analysis\u201d of value, is\nsupported by the mundane observation that, instead of saying that\nsomething is good, we often say that it is valuable, which\nitself just means that it is fitting to value the thing in question.\nIt would thus seem very natural to suppose that for something to be\nintrinsically good is simply for it to be such that it is fitting to\nvalue it for its own sake. (\u201cFitting\u201d here is often\nunderstood to signify a particular kind of moral fittingness, in\nkeeping with the idea that intrinsic value is a particular kind of\nmoral value. The underlying point is that those who value for its own\nsake that which is intrinsically good thereby evince a kind of\nmoral sensitivity.)\n\nThough undoubtedly attractive, this analysis can be and has been\nchallenged. Brand Blanshard [1892\u20131987], for example, argues\nthat the analysis is to be rejected because, if we ask why\nsomething is such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake, the\nanswer is that this is the case precisely because the thing\nin question is intrinsically good; this answer indicates that the\nconcept of intrinsic goodness is more fundamental than that of the\nfittingness of some pro attitude, which is inconsistent with analyzing\nthe former in terms of the latter (Blanshard 1961, pp. 284\u201386).\nEwing and others have resisted Blanshard\u2019s argument, maintaining\nthat what grounds and explains something\u2019s being valuable is not\nits being good but rather its having whatever non-value property it is\nupon which its goodness supervenes; they claim that it is because of\nthis underlying property that the thing in question is\n\u201cboth\u201d good and valuable (Ewing 1948, pp. 157 and 172. Cf.\nLemos 1994, p. 19). Thomas Scanlon calls such an account of the\nrelation between valuableness, goodness, and underlying properties a\nbuck-passing account, since it \u201cpasses the buck\u201d of\nexplaining why something is such that it is fitting to value it from\nits goodness to some property that underlies its goodness (Scanlon\n1998, pp. 95 ff.). Whether such an account is acceptable has recently\nbeen the subject of intense debate. Many, like Scanlon, endorse\npassing the buck; some, like Blanshard, object to doing so. If such an\naccount is acceptable, then Ewing\u2019s analysis survives\nBlanshard\u2019s challenge; but otherwise not. (Note that one might\nendorse passing the buck and yet reject Ewing\u2019s analysis for\nsome other reason. Hence a buck-passer may, but need not, accept the\nanalysis. Indeed, there is reason to think that Moore himself is a\nbuck-passer, even though he takes the concept of intrinsic goodness to\nbe unanalyzable; cf. Olson 2006).\n\nEven if Blanshard\u2019s argument succeeds and intrinsic goodness is\nnot to be analyzed in terms of the fittingness of some pro\nattitude, it could still be that there is a strict\ncorrelation between something\u2019s being intrinsically good\nand its being such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake;\nthat is, it could still be both that (a) it is necessarily true that\nwhatever is intrinsically good is such that it is fitting to value it\nfor its own sake, and that (b) it is necessarily true that whatever it\nis fitting to value for its own sake is intrinsically good. If this\nwere the case, it would reveal an important feature of intrinsic\nvalue, recognition of which would help us to improve our understanding\nof the concept. However, this thesis has also been challenged.\n\nKrister Bykvist has argued that what he calls solitary goods may\nconstitute a counterexample to part (a) of the thesis (Bykvist 2009,\npp. 4 ff.). Such (alleged) goods consist in states of affairs that\nentail that there is no one in a position to value them. Suppose, for\nexample, that happiness is intrinsically good, and good in such a way\nthat it is fitting to welcome it. Then, more particularly, the state\nof affairs of there being happy egrets is intrinsically good; so too,\npresumably, is the more complex state of affairs of there being happy\negrets but no welcomers. The simpler state of affairs would appear to\npose no problem for part (a) of the thesis, but the more complex state\nof affairs, which is an example of a solitary good, may pose a\nproblem. For if to welcome a state of affairs entails that that state\nof affairs obtains, then welcoming the more complex state of affairs\nis logically impossible. Furthermore, if to welcome a state of affairs\nentails that one believes that that state of affairs obtains, then the\npertinent belief regarding the more complex state of affairs would be\nnecessarily false. In neither case would it seem plausible to say that\nwelcoming the state of affairs is nonetheless fitting. Thus, unless\nthis challenge can somehow be met, a proponent of the thesis must\nrestrict the thesis to pro attitudes that are neither truth- nor\nbelief-entailing, a restriction that might itself prove unwelcome,\nsince it excludes a number of favorable responses to what is good\n(such as promoting what is good, or taking pleasure in what is good)\nto which proponents of the thesis have often appealed.\n\nAs to part (b) of the thesis: some philosophers have argued that it\ncan be fitting to value something for its own sake even if that thing\nis not intrinsically good. A relatively early version of this argument\nwas again provided by Blanshard (1961, pp. 287 ff. Cf. Lemos 1994, p.\n18). Recently the issue has been brought into stark relief by the\nfollowing sort of thought-experiment. Imagine that an evil demon wants\nyou to value him for his own sake and threatens to cause you severe\nsuffering unless you do. It seems that you have good reason to do what\nhe wants\u2014it is appropriate or fitting to comply with his demand\nand value him for his own sake\u2014even though he is clearly not\nintrinsically good (Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004, pp.\n402 ff.). This issue, which has come to be known as \u201cthe wrong\nkind of reason problem,\u201d has attracted a great deal of\nattention. Some have been persuaded that the challenge succeeds, while\nothers have sought to undermine it.\n\nOne final cautionary note. It is apparent that some philosophers use\nthe term \u201cintrinsic value\u201d and similar terms to express\nsome concept other than the one just discussed. In particular,\nImmanuel Kant [1724\u20131804] is famous for saying that the only\nthing that is \u201cgood without qualification\u201d is a good will,\nwhich is good not because of what it effects or accomplishes but\n\u201cin itself\u201d (Kant 1785, Ak. 1\u20133). This may seem to\nsuggest that Kant ascribes (positive) intrinsic value only to a good\nwill, declaring the value that anything else may possess merely\nextrinsic, in the senses of \u201cintrinsic value\u201d and\n\u201cextrinsic value\u201d discussed above. This suggestion is, if\nanything, reinforced when Kant immediately adds that a good will\n\u201cis to be esteemed beyond comparison as far higher than anything\nit could ever bring about,\u201d that it \u201cshine[s] like a jewel\nfor its own sake,\u201d and that its \u201cusefulness\u2026can\nneither add to, nor subtract from, [its] value.\u201d For here Kant\nmay seem not only to be invoking the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value but also to be in agreement with Brentano et\nal. regarding the characterization of the former in terms of the\nfittingness of some attitude, namely, esteem. (The term\n\u201crespect\u201d is often used in place of \u201cesteem\u201d\nin such contexts.) Nonetheless, it becomes clear on further inspection\nthat Kant is in fact discussing a concept quite different from that\nwith which this article is concerned. A little later on he says that\nall rational beings, even those that lack a good will, have\n\u201cabsolute value\u201d; such beings are \u201cends in\nthemselves\u201d that have a \u201cdignity\u201d or\n\u201cintrinsic value\u201d that is \u201cabove all price\u201d\n(Kant 1785, Ak. 64 and 77). Such talk indicates that Kant believes\nthat the sort of value that he ascribes to rational beings is one that\nthey possess to an infinite degree. But then, if this were understood\nas a thesis about intrinsic value as we have been understanding this\nconcept, the implication would seem to be that, since it contains\nrational beings, ours is the best of all possible\n worlds.[4]\n Yet this is a thesis that Kant, along with many others, explicitly\nrejects elsewhere (Kant, Lectures in Ethics). It seems best\nto understand Kant, and other philosophers who have since written in\nthe same vein (cf. Anderson 1993), as being concerned not with the\nquestion of what intrinsic value rational beings have\u2014in the\nsense of \u201cintrinsic value\u201d discussed above\u2014but with\nthe quite different question of how we ought to behave toward such\ncreatures (cf. Bradley 2006).\n",
