The Reaction Against Positivism.\n\nThe revolt against Positivism in Chile was led by Enrique Molina\n(1871\u20131964), a graduate of the Positivist-inspired Pedagogical\nInstitute at the University of Chile. Molina found the study of\nphilosophy stagnant, and considered the emphasis on science stifling.\nHe initially shared the school\u2019s emphasis on a scientific\napproach to the teaching of several disciplines, including philosophy.\nHowever, after encountering the work of William James and, especially,\nHenri Bergson, Molina launched a philosophical campaign to establish\nmetaphysics as the most important field within the discipline. In his\nview, the positivist concept of \u201cprogress\u201d had come to\nmean material, and specifically technological, progress. In his most\nimportant philosophical work, De lo espiritual en la vida\nhumana (1937), Molina argued that science and technology had done\nlittle to advance human happiness. Therefore, an emphasis on the life\nof the spirit (though not in a religious sense) deserved to become the\ncentral endeavor of the discipline as well as its main contribution to\nsociety. He developed a hierarchy of values where those of a spiritual\nnature reigned over crass materialistic concerns.\n\nMolina\u2019s argument was by no means devoid of a political edge. He\nargued that after Positivism Marxism had become the main conduit for\nthe spread of materialistic concerns. In the Chile of the middle\ndecades of the twentieth century, Marxism had indeed made major\ninroads into the country, and Molina was part of a generation of\nphilosophers who were alarmed by the threat represented by Marxist\nideology. His response was the advancement of philosophical views that\nplaced metaphysics at the top of a hierarchy of fields. He then set\nout to reorient the study of philosophy in the country through his\nwritings and institutional activities, including the rectorship of the\nUniversity of Concepci\u00f3n, which he founded in 1919.\n\nIn disciplinary terms, Molina\u2019s arguments found resonance among\nCatholic thinkers like Clarence Finlayson (1913\u20131954), and the\nmore secularly inclined Jorge Millas (1917\u20131982), whose Idea\nde la individualidad (1943) was entirely free of any ties to\nPositivism, emphasizing instead individual liberty as the principal\nconcern of the discipline. Although Millas retained a high level of\npolitical engagement throughout his career, he viewed individual\nliberty as a higher stage of human existence beyond the externalities\nof society and politics.\n\nThe institutional expression of such views was a succession of changes\nin the philosophy curriculum that incorporated new authors and new\nschools of thought such as phenomenology, existentialism, and\nneo-Thomism. In 1929, Pedro Le\u00f3n Loyola created a Center for\nPhilosophical Studies at the University of Chile, and in 1931 a major\nuniversity reform placed the Pedagogical Institute, the home of\nphilosophical studies, at the more academically oriented Faculty of\nPhilosophy. Philosophy was also taught at the Universidad de\nConcepci\u00f3n and at the Catholic University of Chile (founded in\n1888). The latter institution created an Academy of Philosophy in\n1923, and a Pedagogical School in 1943 where courses on ontology,\ntheodicy and ethics were offered. By 1950, it added courses on\nepistemology, metaphysics and aesthetics. Increased philosophical\nactivity translated into the creation of the Chilean Society of\nPhilosophy (Sociedad Chilena de Filosof\u00eda) in 1948,\nand the launching of the Revista de Filosof\u00eda the next\nyear. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War\nmeant that several philosophers arrived in Chile as refugees in the\n1940s, adding to the increased variety of philosophical concerns.\n\nDespite the diversity, the main consensus among Chilean philosophers\nwas that the discipline was autonomous, especially from politics.\nIndividual philosophers could and did have political commitments, but\nthey all agreed that the field was a highly specialized academic\nendeavor. They entered the phase that Argentine philosopher Francisco\nRomero named \u201cphilosophical normalcy\u201d, which was\ncharacterized by university-level positions, publications in\nspecialized journals, international conferences, teaching stints in\nforeign institutions and, above all, a strong divide separating\nacademic philosophical activity from social and political\nconcerns.\n",
