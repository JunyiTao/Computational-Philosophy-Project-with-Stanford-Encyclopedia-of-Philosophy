    "main_text": "The Logic of Relatives\n2. The Logic of Relatives\nIn Charles Peirce's \u2018Logic of Relatives\u2019 (1883), we see a\nmove towards an understanding of terms as functions. One problem with\ntraditional term logic is that it lacks the ability to deal with\nrelations. Peirce's logic of relatives is meant to remedy that.  He\nadds terms to Boolean algebra that represent relations, and gives an\nextensional interpretation of them. They are not propositional\nfunctions in the full sense. Peirce's relatives are \u2018common\nnames\u2019 that represent classes of pairs of objects (1883, 328).\nThus, the logic of relatives represents a generalization of\ntraditional logic rather than a departure from it.\nPeirce extends the algebra of terms to deal with particular\nfeatures of relations. Like other terms, we can have conjunctive,\ndisjunctive, and negative terms. Where\nf and g are relatives, then fg represents\nthe class of pairs (I,J) such that I bears both\nf and g to J. Similarly, the disjunctive\nrelative, f+g is such that it represent\n(I,J) if I bears either\nf or g to J and f\u2032\u2014the negation of the\nterm f\u2014represents the class of pairs (I,J) such that\nf does not hold between them. Peirce also has a composition\noperator, ; , such that\nf;g names (I,J) if there is some\nentity K such that f names (I,K)\nand\ng names (K,J).\nIn \u2018The Critic of Arguments\u2019 (1892), Peirce adopts a\nnotion that is even closer to that of a propositional function. There\nhe develops the concept of the \u2018rhema\u2019. He says the rhema\nis like a relative term, but it is not a term. It contains a copula,\nthat is, when joined to the correct number of arguments it produces\nan assertion. For example, \u2018__ is bought by __ from __ for __\u2019 is a\nfour-place rhema. Applying it to four objects\na, b, c, and d produces the assertion that \na is bought by b from c for d (ibid. 420). \nOne especially interesting point about Peirce's rhema is that he\nuses the same chemical analogy as Frege does when they discuss the\nrelation between relations and their arguments. They both compare\nrelations (and properties) to \u2018atoms or radicals with\nunsaturated bonds\u2019. What exactly this analogy says of relations\nor properties, either in Frege or Peirce is somewhat unclear.\n\nSee the entry on Peirce's logic, for\na more complete exposition of his work. \n",
