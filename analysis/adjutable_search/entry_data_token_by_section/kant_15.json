    "main_text": "Morality and freedom || The categorical imperative\n5.4 The categorical imperative\n\nIn both the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the\nCritique of Practical Reason, Kant also gives a more detailed\nargument for the conclusion that morality and freedom reciprocally\nimply one another, which is sometimes called the reciprocity thesis\n(Allison 1990). On this view, to act morally is to exercise freedom,\nand the only way to fully exercise freedom is to act morally.\nKant\u2019s arguments for this view differ in these texts, but the\ngeneral structure of his argument in the Critique of Practical\nReason may be summarized as follows.\n\nFirst, it follows from the basic idea of having a will that to act at\nall is to act on some principle, or what Kant calls a maxim. A maxim\nis a subjective rule or policy of action: it says what you are doing\nand why. Kant gives as examples the maxims \u201cto let no insult\npass unavenged\u201d and \u201cto increase my wealth by every safe\nmeans\u201d (5:19, 27). We may be unaware of our maxims, we may not\nact consistently on the same maxims, and our maxims may not be\nconsistent with one another. But Kant holds that since we are rational\nbeings our actions always aim at some sort of end or goal, which our\nmaxim expresses. The goal of an action may be something as basic as\ngratifying a desire, or it may be something more complex such as\nbecoming a doctor or a lawyer. In any case, the causes of our actions\nare never our desires or impulses, on Kant\u2019s view. If I act to\ngratify some desire, then I choose to act on a maxim that specifies\nthe gratification of that desire as the goal of my action. For\nexample, if I desire some coffee, then I may act on the maxim to go to\na cafe and buy some coffee in order to gratify that desire.\n\nSecond, Kant distinguishes between two basic kinds of principles or\nrules that we can act on: what he calls material and formal\nprinciples. To act in order to satisfy some desire, as when I act on\nthe maxim to go for coffee at a cafe, is to act on a material\nprinciple (5:21ff.). Here the desire (for coffee) fixes the goal,\nwhich Kant calls the object or matter of the action, and the principle\nsays how to achieve that goal (go to a cafe). Corresponding to\nmaterial principles, on Kant\u2019s view, are what he calls\nhypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is a principle of\nrationality that says I should act in a certain way if I choose to\nsatisfy some desire. If maxims in general are rules that describe how\none does act, then imperatives in general prescribe how one should\nact. An imperative is hypothetical if it says how I should act only if\nI choose to pursue some goal in order to gratify a desire (5:20).\nThis, for example, is a hypothetical imperative: if you want coffee,\nthen go to the cafe. This hypothetical imperative applies to you only\nif you desire coffee and choose to gratify that desire.\n\nIn contrast to material principles, formal principles describe how one\nacts without making reference to any desires. This is easiest to\nunderstand through the corresponding kind of imperative, which Kant\ncalls a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative commands\nunconditionally that I should act in some way. So while hypothetical\nimperatives apply to me only on the condition that I have and set the\ngoal of satisfying the desires that they tell me how to satisfy,\ncategorical imperatives apply to me no matter what my goals and\ndesires may be. Kant regards moral laws as categorical imperatives,\nwhich apply to everyone unconditionally. For example, the moral\nrequirement to help others in need does not apply to me only if I\ndesire to help others in need, and the duty not to steal is not\nsuspended if I have some desire that I could satisfy by stealing.\nMoral laws do not have such conditions but rather apply\nunconditionally. That is why they apply to everyone in the same\nway.\n\nThird, insofar as I act only on material principles or hypothetical\nimperatives, I do not act freely, but rather I act only to satisfy\nsome desire(s) that I have, and what I desire is not ultimately within\nmy control. To some limited extent we are capable of rationally\nshaping our desires, but insofar as we choose to act in order to\nsatisfy desires we are choosing to let nature govern us rather than\ngoverning ourselves (5:118). We are always free in the sense that we\nalways have the capacity to govern ourselves rationally instead of\nletting our desires set our ends for us. But we may (freely) fail to\nexercise that capacity. Moreover, since Kant holds that desires never\ncause us to act, but rather we always choose to act on a maxim even\nwhen that maxim specifies the satisfaction of a desire as the goal of\nour action, it also follows that we are always free in the sense that\nwe freely choose our maxims. Nevertheless, our actions are not free in\nthe sense of being autonomous if we choose to act only on material\nprinciples, because in that case we do not give the law to ourselves,\nbut instead we choose to allow nature in us (our desires) to determine\nthe law for our actions. \n\nFinally, the only way to act freely in the full sense of exercising\nautonomy is therefore to act on formal principles or categorical\nimperatives, which is also to act morally. Kant does not mean that\nacting autonomously requires that we take no account of our desires,\nwhich would be impossible (5:25, 61). Rather, he holds that we\ntypically formulate maxims with a view to satisfying our desires, but\nthat \u201cas soon as we draw up maxims of the will for\nourselves\u201d we become immediately conscious of the moral law\n(5:29). This immediate consciousness of the moral law takes the\nfollowing form:\n\nI have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by every\nsafe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has\ndied and left no record of it. This is, naturally, a case for my\nmaxim. Now I want only to know whether that maxim could also hold as a\nuniversal practical law. I therefore apply the maxim to the present\ncase and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and\nconsequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give\nsuch a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can\nprove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as\na law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that\nthere would be no deposits at all. (5:27)\n\n\nIn other words, to assess the moral permissibility of my maxim, I ask\nwhether everyone could act on it, or whether it could be willed as a\nuniversal law. The issue is not whether it would be good if everyone\nacted on my maxim, or whether I would like it, but only whether it\nwould be possible for my maxim to be willed as a universal law. This\ngets at the form, not the matter or content, of the maxim. A maxim has\nmorally permissible form, for Kant, only if it could be willed as a\nuniversal law. If my maxim fails this test, as this one does, then it\nis morally impermissible for me to act on it.\n\nIf my maxim passes the universal law test, then it is morally\npermissible for me to act on it, but I fully exercise my autonomy only\nif my fundamental reason for acting on this maxim is that it is\nmorally permissible or required that I do so. Imagine that I am moved\nby a feeling of sympathy to formulate the maxim to help someone in\nneed. In this case, my original reason for formulating this maxim is\nthat a certain feeling moved me. Such feelings are not entirely within\nmy control and may not be present when someone actually needs my help.\nBut this maxim passes Kant\u2019s test: it could be willed as a\nuniversal law that everyone help others in need from motives of\nsympathy. So it would not be wrong to act on this maxim when the\nfeeling of sympathy so moves me. But helping others in need would not\nfully exercise my autonomy unless my fundamental reason for doing so\nis not that I have some feeling or desire, but rather that it would be\nright or at least permissible to do so. Only when such a purely formal\nprinciple supplies the fundamental motive for my action do I act\nautonomously.\n\nSo the moral law is a law of autonomy in the sense that \u201cfreedom\nand unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each another\u201d\n(5:29). Even when my maxims are originally suggested by my feelings\nand desires, if I act only on morally permissible (or required) maxims\nbecause they are morally permissible (or required), then my actions\nwill be autonomous. And the reverse is true as well: for Kant this is\nthe only way to act\n autonomously.[22]\n",
