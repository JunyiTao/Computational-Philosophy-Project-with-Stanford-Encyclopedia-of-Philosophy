    "main_text": "Outweighing Goods and Inductive Inferences || Representative Goods\n2.2 Representative Goods\n\nSkeptical theists have critiqued the inference from\nNKG to NaaG (see Alston 1991 [1996],\n1996; Christlieb 1992: 48\u201354; Sennett 1993; Bergmann 2001). Once\nagain, the critique can usefully be divided into two parts\u2014an\nepistemological principle and some claims in philosophy of\nreligion.\n\nSkeptical theists have spent less time developing the epistemic\nprinciple used in this critique. But they assume a principle something\nlike this: an inference from a sample of a group to the group\nvis-\u00e0-vis some property is reasonable only if one is\nin a position to reasonably believe that the sample is representative\nof the group vis-\u00e0-vis that property. (See Alston\n1996: 326\u20137; Howard-Snyder 1996b: 297\u20139; Tucker 2014:\n49ff.) for worries about how best to formulate such a principle.)\nAgain, this principle can be intuitively supported by cases. If I\nplant in my garden only one kind of pepper\u2014say,\nhabaneros\u2014then it would be unreasonable and irresponsible for me\nto generalize to all kinds of hot peppers.\n\nSkeptical theists then apply something like that principle to the\ninference from NKG to NaaG. It is\nreasonable to infer NaaG from NKG\nonly if it is reasonable for us to believe that the outweighing goods\nwe know of are representative of all potential outweighing goods when\nit comes to the property of justifying God\u2019s permission of\nevil.\n\nBut skeptical theists argue that it is not reasonable for us\nto believe that. Some skeptical theists reason by analogy. Sometimes,\nit is reasonable to believe our sample size is representative because\nit is sufficiently large and chosen at random. Other times, we have\nalready \u201ccharted\u201d the relevant group and we know what\nproportion our sample is from that group. But these are not the case\nhere. The outweighing goods we know of aren\u2019t picked at random.\nNor have we \u201ccharted\u201d the relevant group of all possible\nGod-justifying outweighing goods. The standard techniques for\ngenerating representative samples don\u2019t seem to apply to\nNKG.\n\nBergmann summarizes these ideas in a more careful statement as follows\n(2001: 279; cf. 2009: 376):\n\nST1\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the possible goods we\nknow of are representative of the possible goods there are.\nST2\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the possible evils we\nknow of are representative of the possible evils there are.\nST3\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the entailment relations\nwe know of between possible goods and the permission of possible evils\nare representative of the entailment relations there are between\npossible goods and the permission of possible evils.\n\n\nNotice that these theses do not claim that we have good\nreason for thinking they are not representative. They are\nmore skeptical than that. Bergmann sees these claims as independently\nplausible, so that both theists and non-theists should endorse them,\nwriting: \u201cit just doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that our\nunderstanding of the realm of value falls miserably short of capturing\nall that is true about that realm. One can recognize this even if one\nis not a theist.\u201d (2001: 279).\n\nThus, given a relevant epistemic principle, the inference from\nNKG to NaaG is reasonable only if it\nis reasonable to believe that the outweighing goods we know of are\nrepresentative of all outweighing goods when it comes to justifying\nGod\u2019s permission of evil. But, skeptical theists argue, that is\nnot reasonable for us to believe. So the inference from\nNKG to NaaG is not reasonable. Thus,\nthis representation-based inductive argument for\nN-O1.2 also fails.\n",
