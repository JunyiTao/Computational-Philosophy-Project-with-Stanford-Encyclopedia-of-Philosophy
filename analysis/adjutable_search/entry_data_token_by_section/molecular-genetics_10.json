DNA consists of\n\u201ccoding\u201d regions that are transcribed into RNA, different\nkinds of regulatory regions, and in higher organisms, a number of\nregions whose functions are less clear and perhaps in cases\nnon-existent. Skepticism about genes is based in part on the idea that\nthe term is sometimes applied to only parts of a coding region,\nsometimes to an entire coding region, sometimes to parts of a coding\nregion and to regions that regulate that coding region, and sometimes\nto an entire coding region and regulatory regions affecting or\npotentially affecting the transcription of the coding region.\nSkeptics (e.g., Burian 1986, Portin 1993, and Kitcher 1992) have\nconcluded, as Kitcher succinctly puts it: \u201ca gene is whatever a\ncompetent biologist chooses to call a gene\u201d (Kitcher 1992,\np. 131).\n\n\nBiological textbooks contain definitions of gene and it is\ninstructive to consider one in order to show that the conceptual\nsituation is indeed unsettling. The most prevalent contemporary\ndefinition is that a gene is the fundamental unit that codes for a\npolypeptide. One problem with this definition is that it\nexcludes many segments that are typically referred to as genes. Some\nDNA segments code for functional RNA molecules that are never\ntranslated into polypeptides. Such RNA molecules include transfer RNA,\nribosomal RNA, and RNA molecules that play regulatory and catalytic\nroles. Hence, this definition is too narrow.\n\n\nAnother problem with this common definition is that it is based on\nan overly simplistic account of DNA expression. According to this\nsimple account, a gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is\ntranscribed into a sequence of nucleotides making up a messenger RNA\nmolecule that is in turn translated into sequence of amino acids that\nforms a polypeptide. (Biologists talk as if genes \u201cproduce the\npolypeptide molecules\u201d or  \u201cprovide the information\nfor the polypeptide\u201d.) The real situation of DNA expression,\nhowever, is often far more complex. For example, in plants and\nanimals, many mRNA molecules are processed before they are translated\ninto polypeptides. In these cases, portions of the RNA molecule,\ncalled introns, are snipped out and the remaining segments,\ncalled exons, are spliced together before the RNA molecule\nleaves the cellular nucleus. Sometimes biologists call the entire DNA\nregion, that is the region that corresponds to both introns and exons,\nthe gene.  Other times, they call only the portions of the DNA segment\ncorresponding to the exons the gene. (This means that some DNA\nsegments that geneticists call genes are not continuous segments of\nDNA; they are collections of discontinuous exons. Geneticists call\nthese split genes.)  Further complications arise because\nthe splicing of exons in some cases is executed differentially in\ndifferent tissue types and at different developmental stages. (This\nmeans that there are overlapping genes.) The problem with the\ncommon definition that genes are DNA segments that \u201ccode for\npolypeptides\u201d is that the notion of \u201ccoding for a\npolypeptide\u201d is ambiguous when it comes to actual complications\nof DNA expression. Gene skeptics argue that it is hopelessly ambiguous\n(Burian 1986, Fogle 1990 and 2000, Kitcher 1992, and Portin 1993).\n\n\nClearly, this definition, which is the most common and prominent\ntextbook definition, is too narrow to be applied to the range of\nsegments that geneticists commonly call genes and too ambiguous to\nprovide a single, precise partition of DNA into separate\ngenes. Textbooks include many definitions of the gene.  In fact,\nphilosophers have often been frustrated by the tendency of biologists\nto define and use the term gene in a number of contradictory\nways in one and the same textbook. After subjecting the alternative\ndefinitions to philosophical scrutiny, gene skeptics have concluded\nthat the problem isn't simply a lack of analytical rigor. The\nproblem is that there simply is no such thing as a gene at the\nmolecular level. That is, there is no single, uniform, and unambiguous\nway to divide a DNA molecule into different genes. Gene skeptics have\noften argued that biologists should couch their science in terms of\nDNA segments such exon, intron, promotor region, and so on, and\ndispense with the term gene altogether (most forcefully\nargued by Fogle 2000).\n",
