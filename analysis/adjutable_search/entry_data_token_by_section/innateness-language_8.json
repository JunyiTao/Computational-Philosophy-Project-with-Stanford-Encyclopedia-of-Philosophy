    "main_text": "Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist? || Language Evolution\n3.4 Language Evolution\n\n\nThis brings us to the question of language evolution: if knowledge of\nlanguage (say, of the principles of UG) really is inborn in the human\nlanguage faculty, how did such inborn knowledge evolve? For many \nyears, Chomsky himself refused to speculate about this matter, \nstating that \u201c[e]volutionary theory\u2026has little to say, \nas of now, about questions of this nature\u201d (1988:167). Other \ntheorists have not been so reticent, and a large literature has grown\nup in which the selective advantages of having a language are \nadumbrated. It's good for communicating with, for instance, when \ntrying to figure out what conspecifics are up to (Pinker and Bloom, \n1990; Dunbar 1996). It's a mechanism of group cohesion, analogous to\nprimate grooming (Dunbar 1996). It's a non-genetic mechanism of \nphenotypical plasticity, allowing organisms to adapt to their \nenvironment in non-evolutionary time (Brandon and Hornstein 1986; \nSterelny 2003). It's a mechanism by which we can bend others to our \nwill (Dawkins and Krebs 1979; Catania 1990), or make social \ncontracts (Skyrms 1996). Language makes us smarter, perhaps by being\ninternalized and functioning as a \u2018language of thought\u2019 \n(Bickerton 1995, 2000). And so on.\n\n\nThe ability to speak and understand a language no doubt provided and \ncontinues to provide us with many of these benefits. Consequently \n(and assuming that the costs were not too great \u2014 as patently \nthey weren't), one can be sure that whatever it is about human beings\nthat enables them to learn and use language would have been subjected\nto strong positive selection pressure once it began to emerge in our \nspecies.\n\n\nBut none of this speaks directly to the issue of linguistic nativism.\nThe fact that Mother Nature would have favored individuals or groups \npossessing linguistic abilities tells us nothing about the \nmeans she chose to get the linguistic phenotype built. That \nis, it tells us nothing about the sorts of psychological mechanisms \nthat were recruited to enable human beings to learn, and subsequently\nuse, a natural language.\n\n\nNativism is, of course, one possibility. Natural selection might have\nbuilt a specialized language faculty, containing inborn knowledge \nabout language (e.g., knowledge of UG), which subsequently was \nselected for because it helped human children to acquire linguistic \ncompetence, and having linguistic competence enhanced our ancestors' \nfitness. A problem with this hypothesis, however, is that it is \nunclear how a language faculty containing innate representations of \nUG might have arisen in the human mind. One view is that the language\nfaculty was built up piecemeal by natural selection. This approach \nunderlies Pinker and Bloom's (1990) and Jackendoff's (1999) proposals\nas to the adaptive functions of various grammatical features and \ndevices. Other nativists, however, reject the adaptationist \nframework. For instance, Berwick 1998, has argued that efforts to \nexplain the piecemeal development of knowledge of linguistic \nuniversals in our species may be unnecessary in light of the new, \nMinimalist conception of syntax (see Chomsky 1995). On this view, \nall parametric constraints and rules of syntax are consequences of a \nfundamental syntactic process called Merge: once Merge was in place, \nBerwick argues, the rest of UG automatically followed. Chomsky, \ntaking another tack, has suggested that language is a \n\u2018spandrel,\u2019 a byproduct of other non-linguistically \ndirected selective processes, such as \u201cthe increase in brain \nsize and complexity\u201d (1982:23). And finally Bickerton 1998, on \nyet another tack, posits a massive saltative episode in which large \nchunks of syntax emerged all at once, although this posit is \nimplicitly withdrawn in Calvin and Bickerton 2000.\n\n\nThe literature on language evolution is too large to survey in this \narticle (but see Botha 2003 for an excellent overview and critique).\nSuffice it to note that as yet, no consensus has emerged as to how\n innate knowledge of UG might have evolved from \nwhatever preadaptations existed in our ancestors. Of course, this is \nnot in itself a problem for linguistic nativists: formulating and \ntesting hypotheses about human cognitive evolution is a massively \ndifficult enterprise, due largely to the difficulty of finding \nevidence bearing on one's hypothesis. (See Lewontin 1998 and Sterelny\n2003:95-116.)\n\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that linguistic nativism is just one \npossibility for how Nature got language up and running. Just as it \nmay be that a language faculty embodying knowledge of UG was somehow \nencoded in the human genome, it's also possible that that our ability\nto learn a language is based on a congeries of pre-existing \ncompetences, none of which is (or was initially \u2014 see below) \nspecialized for language learning. Tomasello's theory of language \nacquisition, discussed above (\u00a72.2.1.b), invites this \nalternative evolutionary perspective. On his view, the fundamental \nskills with which linguistic competence is acquired are skills that \noriginally served, and still continue to serve, quite different, \nnon-linguistic functions. For example, he argues that children's \nearly word and phrase learning rest in part on their ability to share\nattention with others, to discern others' communicative intentions, \nand to imitate aspects of their behavior. There is reason to think \nthat these abilities evolved independently of language, at least \ninitially: imitation learning enabled the fast and high-fidelity \ntransfer of learned skills between generations (see Tomasello 1999, \n2000) and the ability to form beliefs about the mental states of \nothers (\u2018mind-reading\u2019 or \u2018theory of mind\u2019) \nenabled highly intelligent animals, such as our hominid ancestors, to\nnegotiate a complex social environment made up of similarly \nintelligent conspecifics. (See, e.g., Sterelny 2003.) On this sort \nof view, the ability to learn language piggy-backed on other \ncapacities, which originally evolved for other reasons and which \ncontinue to serve other functions in addition to their linguistic \nones.\n\n\nYou might wonder, however, whether this latter kind of account really\ndiffers substantively from that of a nativist. Assuming that she does\nnot reject adaptationism altogether, the nativist will presumably be \ncommitted to the idea that the innate language organ, or faculty \nembodying knowledge of UG, was derived from pre-existing structures \nthat were either functionless or had non-linguistic functions. These \nstructures subsequently acquired linguistic functions through being \nselected for that reason: they became adaptations for language. But \nso too would the various capacities postulated by Tomasello. As soon \nas they started being used for language learning, that's to say, they\nwould have been selected for that function (in addition to any other \nfunctions they might serve, and always assuming that linguistic \nabilities were on balance beneficial). Hence they too will over time \nbecome adaptations for language. On both Tomasello's and the \nnativist's view, in other words, the inborn structures responsible \nfor language acquisition will have acquired the biological function \nof enabling language acquisition: they will be specialized for that \npurpose. Is Tomasello, then, a nativist?\n\n\nNo. First, even though the psychological abilities and mechanisms \nthat Tomasello posits have been selected for linguistic functions, \nthese abilities and mechanisms have continued to be used (and, \nplausibly, selected) for non-linguistic purposes, such as face \nrecognition, theory of mind, non-linguistic perception, etc. So, \nwhereas a central tenet of linguistic nativism is its insistence that\nthe structures responsible for language learning are \ntask-specific, Tomasello sees those structures as being much\nmore general-purpose. In addition, and this is a second reason not to\ncount Tomasello as a nativist, the inborn structures he posits are \nnot plausibly interpreted as containing any kind of language specific\ninformation or representations. Yet a commitment to the role of \ninborn, language-specific information (such as knowledge of UG) is \nanother hallmark of linguistic nativism.\n\n\nSeveral theorists (e.g., Clark 1996, Tomasello 1999, and Sterelny, \n2003) have stressed that in addition to working on human linguistic \nabilities directly, via changes to the parts of the genome coding for\nthose abilities, natural selection can also bring about such changes \nindirectly, by making sure that our minds are embedded in certain \nkinds of environments. All sorts of animals create environments for \nthemselves: this is called \u2018niche construction.\u2019 (The \nterm is due to Odling-Smee, Laland and Feldman 1996.) Many animals \nalso (or thereby) create environments for their offspring as well. \nAnd as Odling-Smee et al. 1996, Avital and Jablonka 2000, and \nSterelny 2003 stress, animals' dispositions to modify the \nenvironments of both themselves and their offspring in certain ways \nare just as much potential objects of selection as are other of their\ntraits.\n\n\nTo see this, suppose that an organism O has a genetically encoded \ndisposition N to build a special kind of nest; suppose further that \nbeing raised in this kind of nest causes O-type offspring to have \ncharacteristic C; and suppose finally, that Os with C enjoy greater \nreproductive success than those without. Then, assuming that there is\nvariation in N in the population, natural selection can operate so as\nto increase the proportion of Os with N \u2014 and hence also those \nwith characteristic C \u2014 in the population. Down the track, Os \nwill have C not by virtue of acquiring a special, genetically-encoded\ndisposition-for-C. Rather, they will have C because their parents \nhave the genetically-encoded disposition N, and Os whose parents have\nN \u2018automatically\u2019 develop C.\n\n\nThis toy example illustrates a further route by which language might \nhave evolved in human beings. In addition to creating inborn \nlanguage-learning mechanisms in individuals, natural selection may \nalso have created dispositions to construct particular kinds of \nlinguistic learning environments in their parents. \nFor example, as Clark (1996) and Sterelny (2003) both speculate, \nMother Nature might have worked on our dispositions to use \n\u2018Motherese\u2019 to our children, and/or on our tendency to \ntalk about things that are current objects of the child's perceptual \nattention, in order to create learning environments conducive to the \nacquisition of language.\n\n\nIn principle, the existence of this sort of \u2018niche\nconstruction\u2019 can be accepted by all parties to the nativism\ncontroversy. That is, both Tomasello and Chomsky could agree that\ndispositions to construct \u2018linguistic niches\u2019 \u2014\nenvironments in which languages are easy for human offspring to learn\n\u2014 may have been selected for in our species. Nevertheless, the\nnotion of niche construction militates against the nativist,\nparticularly when one takes into account the related notion of\n\u2018cumulative downstream niche construction.\u2019\n\n\nCases of what Sterelny (2003: 149ff) calls \u2018cumulative \ndownstream niche construction\u2019 occur when a generation of \nanimals modifies an environment that has already been modified by \nearlier generations. A mountain thornbill's nest is an instance of \ndownstream niche construction (since its offspring are affected by \nthe thornbill's efforts). However, the construction is not \ncumulative, since the nest is built anew each year. By contrast, a \nrabbit warren extended and elaborated over several generations is an \ninstance of cumulative construction: successive generations of \noffspring inherit an ever-more-complex niche and their other \nbehaviors are tuned accordingly in ever-more-complex ways. Tomasello,\n1999 and Sterelny 2003 stress that niche construction, including \ndownstream niche construction, is not limited to the physical world: \nanimals make changes to their social and epistemic worlds as well. \nFor instance, chimpanzees live in groups (= construction of a social \nniche) and dogs mark their territory (= a change in their epistemic \nniche, relieving them of the necessity of remembering where the \nboundaries of their territory are). Humans, says Sterelny, echoing a \ntheme of Tomasello 1999, are niche constructors \u201cwith a \nvengeance\u201d (2003:149) and many of the changes they make to \ntheir physical, social and epistemic environments accumulate over \nmany generations (think of a city, a democracy, modern science, a \nnatural language). Such cumulative modifications allow for what \nTomasello calls a \u201cratchet effect\u201d: a \u201ccycle in \nwhich an improvement is made, becomes standard for the group, and \nthen becomes a basis for further innovation.\u201d (Sterelny 2003: \n150-1)\n\n\nThe idea of cumulative niche construction has obvious application to \nthe case of language. If parents shape the linguistic environment of \ntheir offspring, and if we all shape the linguistic environments of \nour conspecifics (merely by talking to them!) then the possibility of\na \u2018linguistic ratchet effect\u2019 is clearly open. Small \nchanges made to the language of the group by one generation \u2014 \nchanges which perhaps make it easier to learn, or easier to \nunderstand or produce \u2014 will be transmitted to later \ngenerations, who may in turn make further changes geared to \nincreasing language learnability and ease of use. This scenario \nraises the possibility, already mentioned at the end of the last \nsection, that language may have evolved so as to be learnable and \nusable by us, in addition to the converse scenario (stressed in much \nwork on the evolution of language) that we had to change in \nmany and complex ways in order to learn and use a language. Thus, we \nmight speculate, languages' phonetic systems evolved so as to be \ncongenial to our animal ears; their expressive resources (in \nparticular, their vocabularies) evolved so as to fit our \ncommunicative needs; and perhaps, as Clark 1997 has suggested and as \nTomasello 2003 implicitly takes for granted, natural language syntax\nevolved so as to suit our pre-existing cognitive and processing \ncapacities. To be sure, the languages we have coded in our heads look\ncomplex and weird to linguists and psychologists and philosophers who\nare trying to put together theories about them. But, if languages and\nhuman minds have evolved in tandem, as surely they have, then \nlanguages may not look weird at all from the point of view of the \nbrains that implement and use them.\n\n\nAll of these processes have likely played a role in the evolution of\nour capacities to learn and use a natural language.  Pre-existing\npsychological, perceptual and motor capacities would have been\nrecruited for the task of language learning and use. These capacities\nwould have been honed and specialized further by natural selection for\nthe performance of linguistic tasks. The functions of some of them,\nperhaps, would have become so specialized for language-related tasks\nthat they cease to perform any non-linguistic functions at all \u2014\nand to this extent, perhaps, linguistic nativism would be\nvindicated. At the same time, however, language itself would have been\nevolving so as the better to suit our cognitive and perceptual\ncapacities, and our communicative needs.  Given the fact that many\ndifferent perceptual, motor and cognitive systems are implicated in\nlanguage use and learning, and given the co-evolution of our minds and\nour languages, the truth about language evolution, when it emerges, is\nunlikely to be a simple. For this reason, it is unlikely to\nvindicate the nativist's notion that a specialized and monolithic\n\u2018language organ\u2019 or \u2018faculty\u2019 is at the root\nof our linguistic capacities.\n\n\nBefore leaving the question of language evolution, it is necessary to\nmention a recent paper by Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002 on this \ntopic. First, they distinguish (2002:1571) what they call the \n\u2018faculty of language in the narrow sense,\u2019 or \n\u2018FLN,\u2019 from the \u2018faculty of language in the broad \nsense,\u2019 or \u2018FLB.\u2019 The FLN is the \u201cabstract \nlinguistic computational system alone\u2026which generates internal\nrepresentations and maps them into the sensory-motor interface by the\nphonological system, and into the conceptual-intentional interface by\nthe (formal) semantic system.\u201d (Ibid.) The FLB \nincludes the FLN plus all the other systems (motor systems, \nconceptual systems, perceptual systems, and learning skills) which \ncontribute to language acquisition and use.\n\n\nNext, Hauser et al. speculate that the only thing that's really \nspecial about the human FLB is the FLN. That is, with the exception \nonly of the FLN, FLB comprises systems that are shared with (or only \nslight modifications of) systems in other animals. Consequently, \nthere is no mystery (or no more mystery than usual) about how these \nlanguage-related abilities evolved. FLN, on the other hand, is \ndistinctive to humans and what is special about it is its power of \nrecursion, that is, its ability to categorize linguistic \nobjects into hierarchically organized classes, and (on the behavioral\nside) for the generation of infinitely many sentences out of finitely\nmany words. According to Hauser et al., the only real evolutionary \nmystery about language is how this capacity for recursion evolved \n\u2014 and this question, argue Hauser et al, is eminently \naddressable by normal biological methods (e.g., comparative studies \nto determine possible precursor mechanisms, etc.).\n\n\nHowever, there are two difficulties with this scenario. First, there \nis evidence that the power of recursion posited by Hauser et al. as \nbeing distinctive of the human FLN is in fact not distinctive to \nhumans, because it is not species specific. (See Esser, et al. 1997\nand McGonigle, Chalmers and Dickinson, 2003.) Second, \nrecursiveness is not language specific either, but is a feature of \nother domains of human cognition and endeavor as well. Our conceptual\nspace, for instance, appears to be hierarchically ordered (poodles \nare a kind of dog, which are a kind of quadruped, which are a kind of\nanimal, etc.). Similarly, the planning and execution of \nnon-linguistic actions seems often to involve the sequencing and \ncombining of smaller behavioral units into larger wholes. Recursion \nmight well be an important part of the human language faculty, but \nit's apparently not specific either to us or to that faculty. Or, to \nput the point more bluntly: if it's Chomsky's view that recursiveness\nis the pivotal feature of the language faculty, and if recursiveness \nis a feature of human cognition and action more generally, then it's \nnot clear that Chomsky remains a linguistic \n nativist.[26]\n\n",
