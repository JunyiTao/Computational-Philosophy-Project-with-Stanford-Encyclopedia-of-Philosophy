    "main_text": "Socrates and Athenian Paiderastia\n2. Socrates and Athenian Paiderastia\n\nAs a man who loves boys in an idiosyncratic, because elenctic, way,\nSocrates is placed in potential conflict with the norms of a peculiar\nAthenian social institution, that of paiderastia\u2014the\nsocially regulated intercourse between an older Athenian male\n(erast\u00eas) and a teenage boy (er\u00f4menos,\npais), through which the latter was supposed to learn virtue.\nAnd this potential, as we know, was realized with tragic\nconsequences\u2014in 399 BC Socrates was found guilty of corrupting\nthe young men of Athens and condemned to death. The effect on Plato is\npalpable in his works, turning very many of them into\ndefenses\u2014not always uncritical\u2014of Socrates, and of what he\nrepresented for the young men he encountered. His account in the\nSymposium of one such relationship\u2014that with the\nbrilliant and beautiful Alcibiades\u2014is an illuminating case in\npoint.\n\nAlcibiades was so in love with Socrates\u2014\u201cit was\nobvious,\u201d the Symposium (222c1\u20132) tells\nus\u2014that when asked to speak of love, he speaks of his beloved.\nNo general theories of love for him, just the vividly remembered story\nof the times he spent with a man so extraordinary there has never been\nanyone like him\u2014a man so powerfully erotic he turned the\nconventional world of love upside down by \u201cseeming to be a lover\n(erast\u00eas) while really establishing himself as a\nbeloved boy (pais) instead\u201d (222b3\u20134).\n\nThe stories of all the other symposiasts, too, are stories of their\nparticular loves masquerading as stories of love itself, stories about\nwhat they find beautiful masquerading as stories about what\nis beautiful. For Phaedrus and Pausanius, the canonical image\nof true love\u2014the quintessential love story\u2014features the\nright sort of older male lover and the right sort of beloved boy. For\nEryximachus the image of true love is painted in the languages of his\nown beloved medicine and of all the other crafts and sciences. For\nAristophanes it is painted in the language of comedy. For Agathon, in\nthe loftier tones of tragedy. In ways that these men are unaware of,\nthen, but that Plato knows, their love stories are themselves\nmanifestations of their loves and of the inversions or perversions\nexpressed in them. They think their stories are the truth about love,\nbut they are really love\u2019s delusions\u2014\u201cimages,\u201d\nas Diotima will later call them. As such, however, they are essential\nparts of that truth. For the power of love to engender delusive images\nof the beautiful is as much a part of the truth about it as its power\nto lead to the beautiful itself. Later, we shall learn why.\n\nLove stories, however inadequate as theories of love, are nonetheless\nstories, logoi, items that admit of analysis. But because\nthey are manifestations of our loves, not mere cool bits of\ntheorizing, we\u2014our deepest feelings\u2014are invested in them.\nThey are therefore tailor-made, in one way at least, to satisfy the\nSocratic sincerity condition, the demand that you say what you believe\n(Crito 49c11-d2, Protagoras 331c4-d1). Under the\ncool gaze of the elenctic eye, they are tested for consistency with\nother beliefs that lie just outside love\u2019s controlling and often\ndistorting ambit. Under such testing, a lover may be forced to say\nwith Agathon, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was talking about in\nthat story\u201d (201b11\u201312). The love that expressed itself in\nhis love story meets then another love: his rational desire for\nconsistency and intelligibility; his desire to be able to tell and\nlive a coherent story; his desire\u2014to put it the other way\naround\u2014not to be endlessly frustrated and conflicted, because he\nis repetitively trying to live out an incoherent love story.\n\nIn Alcibiades\u2019 love story, in particular, these two desires are\nself-consciously in play: \u201cSocrates is the only man in the world\nwho has made me feel shame\u2026 I know perfectly well that I\ncan\u2019t prove he\u2019s wrong when he tells me what I should do:\nyet, the moment I leave his side, I go back to my old ways: I cave in\nto my desire to please the crowd\u201d (216b1\u20135). Even such\nawareness of conflict as is manifested here, however, is no guarantee\nof a satisfactory resolution. For the new love\u2014the one that\nseems to offer coherence, satisfaction, and release from\nshame\u2014may turn out to be just the old frustrating one in\ndisguise.\n\nAlcibiades\u2019 famous failed attempt to seduce Socrates shows that\nthis is so in his case too (218b8-e5). For Alcibiades doesn\u2019t\ntry to win Socrates\u2019 love by undertaking the difficult task of\nself-transformation required to become a more virtuous, and so more\ntruly beautiful and lovable, person. Instead, he takes the easy,\nfamiliar path of offering the physical attractions he already\nhas\u2014the ones that have earned him the approval of the crowd.\nWhen these fail him, it is to the crowd (in the form of the Bacchic\nrevelers we meet at the end of the Symposium) he will\nregressively return, having never really succeeded in turning\naway.\n\nThat he has never turned away is made yet more vivid in one of the\nmost intriguing passages in the Symposium. Socrates,\nAlcibiades says, is \u201cironical eir\u00f4neuomenos) and\nspends his whole life playing with people. Yet, I don\u2019t know\nwhether anyone else has seen the figures within (ta entos\nagalmata) when he is serious and opened up, but I saw them once,\nand I thought that they were so divine and golden, so marvelously\nbeautiful, that I just had to do whatever Socrates told me\u201d\n(216e4\u2013217a2). Imagine seeing Socrates without his ironic mask\nof mock modesty. What we wouldn\u2019t give to see that. As is so\noften the case with love, however, it is fantasy we are dealing with.\nWhat Alcibiades thinks he sees in Socrates are embryonic virtues,\nwhich\u2014like spermatazoa in the embryology the Symposium\nimplicitly embraces when it speaks of the lover as pregnant\nand as seeking a beautiful boy in which to beget an\noffspring\u2014need only be ejaculated into the right receptacle in\norder to grow into their mature forms (209a5-c2). Sex can lead to\nvirtue, in other words, without the need for hard work. As soon as the\nillusion is enjoyed, therefore, it gives birth not to a realistic\nattempt to acquire virtue, but to the sexual seduction fantasy\nmentioned earlier.\n\nThe origins of this fantasy\u2014though, no doubt, partly\npersonal\u2014are predominantly social. It is the complex ideology of\nAthenian paiderasteia that has shaped Alcibiades\u2019 own\ndesires. For, according to it, love is really \u201ctwo\nthings\u201d: good Uranian love, whose object is the soul, and whose\naim is to instill virtue in the younger male; and bad Pandemotic love,\nwhose object is the body and whose aim is sexual pleasure for the\nolder lover (180c1-d7). What causes the split is the need Pandemotic\nlove has to mask itself as Uranian love in order to preserve the\nillusion that the young man\u2019s participation in it is compatible\nwith his status as a future male citizen. It cannot, then, be\nmotivated by a reprehensible desire to adopt a passive, slavish,\nfemale pleasure-seeking role. Instead, another motive must be invented\nfor it\u2014a willingness to accept \u201cslavery for the sake of\nvirtue\u201d (184c2\u20133).\n\nA major cost of preserving this split, however, is that the older\nmale\u2019s body-focused, sexual intercourse must itself be masked as\nintercourse of a more respectable sort. Alcibiades\u2019 later\nre-description of Socrates\u2019 inner figures shows him succumbing\nto the double-vision that inevitably results:\n\nIf you were to listen to his arguments, at first they\u2019d strike\nyou as totally ridiculous; they\u2019re clothed in words as coarse as\nthe hides worn by the most vulgar satyrs. He\u2019s always going on\nabout pack asses, or blacksmiths, or cobblers, or tanners\u2026 But\nif the arguments are opened and one sees them from the inside, he will\nfind first that they are the only arguments with any sense in them,\nand next that they contain within themselves utterly divine and\nmultitudinous figures of virtue (agalmat\u2019\naret\u00eas). (221e1\u2013222a4)\n\nFor Alcibiades, then, Socrates\u2019 body is identical to his words;\nthe virtues that are in him are in them; talking philosophy is having\nsexual intercourse, and vice versa.\n",
