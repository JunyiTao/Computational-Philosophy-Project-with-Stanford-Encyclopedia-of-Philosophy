    "main_text": "Semantics || Empty Names and Negative Existentials\n2.9 Empty Names and Negative Existentials\n\nA direct argument for the claim that a name\u2019s meaning is the\ncluster condition determining its reference comes from a consideration\nof claims of nonexistence (or \u201cnegative\nexistentials\u201d):\n\n\nConsider this example. If one says \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d,\nthis may mean various things. It may mean: the Israelites did not have\na single leader when they withdrew from Egypt\u2014or: their\nleader was not called Moses\u2014or: there cannot have been anyone\nwho accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses\u2014or etc.,\netc. (Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79)\n\n\nThere is something compelling about Wittgenstein\u2019s observation.\nThe three alternatives he outlines (while being clear they are not\nexhaustive) describe different kinds of situation in which we might\nwell agree that Moses did not exist. While one could claim that the\nsentence is ambiguous, with an interpretation analyzed in each of\nthese ways at least, this is not what Wittgenstein has in mind. This\nis a good thing, since \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d cannot\nliterally mean that the Israelites did not have a single\nleader, as it is certainly conceivable that Moses existed but did not\nlead the Israelites (Kripke 1980: 66\u201367). Instead, we must treat\nhis alternatives in the manner already suggested for the components of\na cluster theory: as conditions that are neither strictly necessary\nnor inevitably sufficient, but which instead count as factors in favor\nof the nonexistence claim, interacting with an open-ended set of other\nfactors both for and against. Perhaps, indeed, Wittgenstein himself\nheld this view in an inchoate way:\n\n\nHas the name \u201cMoses\u201d got a fixed and unequivocal use for\nme in all possible cases?\u2014Is it not the case that I have, so to\nspeak, a whole series of props in readiness, and am ready to lean on\none if another should be taken from under me, and vice versa?\n(Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79)\n\n\nIntuitions aside, negative existentials pose a serious challenge to\nthe view that names have no meaning. The difficulty is most acute on\nthe view that names only contribute their referent to the truth\ncondition of an utterance (but see Kripke 2013; Braun 1993; the papers\nin Everett & Hofweber 2000); there is a way out, sketched below,\nfor one willing to treat nonreferring names as still contributing a\nsense (which, as you will recall from\n Section 2.2,\n is consistent with the claim that names have no linguistic\nmeaning).\n\nGenerally speaking, the point of a singular negative existential\ncannot be to make a (false) claim about a certain individual, referred\nto by the singular term in the subject position, to the effect that\nthat individual does not exist. In this way, singular negative\nexistentials differ from run-of-the-mill utterances, such as:\n\n(6)Socrates drank\nhemlock.\n\n\nLet C(\u201cSocrates\u201d) stand for the (putative) cluster\ncondition that determines the referent of \u201cSocrates\u201d. We\nare able to state the condition under which (6) is true as:\n\n(7)\n\n   \\( \\exists x. C( \\textrm{\u2018Socrates\u2019})(x) \\wedge\n    \\textsf{drank.hemlock}(x) \\)\n\n\n\nWhile (7) is an accurate statement of the truth condition of (6), it\nmay not be the truth condition we get when we put together the\nsemantic contributions of the parts. (Once again, following Kripke,\nBurge and others, we must maintain a distinction between the semantic\ncontribution\u2014or semantic value\u2014of\nan uttered expression, and that expression\u2019s linguistic\nmeaning.) In particular, if we think that \u201cSocrates\u201d\ncontributes its referent (and only its referent) to the compositional\ntruth condition of a sentence, then we will prefer the following\nstatement (where s is an individual constant denoting\nSocrates):\n\n(8)\n\\(\\textsf{drank.hemlock}(s)\\)\n\n\nIf a name does not refer (take a name such as Urbain Le\nVerrier\u2019s \u201cVulcan\u201d or Algernon\u2019s\n\u201cBunbury\u201d\u2014from Wilde\u2019s play, The\nImportance of Being Earnest), then we obviously lack the option\nof expressing a truth condition that cites its referent. If a claim\ninvolving an empty name has a truth condition at all, it would have to\nbe a condition that, like (7), incorporates the condition that\ndetermines reference, rather than one that, like (8), incorporates the\nreferent itself.\n\nWe might not require a truth condition for statements like\n\u201cBunbury drank hemlock\u201d or \u201cThis is a fine red\none\u201d where nothing is demonstrated (cf. Strawson 1950: 333).\nThose sentences aren\u2019t true, and perhaps don\u2019t make\ntruth-evaluable claims at all. But Wittgenstein has drawn our\nattention to negative existentials, and we do have a grip on the sort\nof situations in which they would turn out to be true. If\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d) represents the cluster condition that\nsingles out Moses in all those situations in which we would say he did\nexist, then the truth condition for (9a) could be represented as (9b),\nbut not as (9c).\n\n(9)\n\n\na.\nMoses did not exist.\nb.\n\\(\\neg\\exists\nx.C(\\textrm{\u201cMoses\u201d})(x)\n\\wedge \\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x))\\)\nc.\n\\(\\neg\\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(m))\\)\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose, for a moment, we agree with Davidson (1967) that (i) when\nwe state the truth condition of a sentence in the right way, we give\nits semantic value. If the truth condition of (9a) cannot be stated as\n(9c), then that leaves (9b) as the remaining candidate for the\nsemantic value of the sentence. And (ii) if the semantic value of a\nsentence is determined by the semantic values of its parts, then\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d) must be the contribution of\n\u201cMoses\u201d (or possibly some larger constituent including\n\u201cMoses\u201d). Since we distinguish meaning and semantic value,\nit doesn\u2019t follow directly that C(\u201cMoses\u201d) is\nthe meaning of \u201cMoses\u201d. However, we cannot, according to\nthis argument, think of C(\u201cMoses\u201d) as a mere\nmetasemantic condition (perhaps derived from use), because\nmetasemantic conditions determine the semantic values of expressions,\nrather than vice versa.\n\nEither premise (i)\u2013(ii) in this argument could be challenged.\nSo, one could distinguish the (compositional) semantic value of a\nsentence from its truth condition. It would then be possible to say\nthat a name that does not refer makes no contribution to the semantic\nvalue of a sentence, and even that a sentence containing an empty name\ndoes not have a semantic value, while still maintaining that (9b)\ngives the correct truth condition for \u201cMoses does not\nexist\u201d. This is the approach of Donnellan (1974: 25), for whom\nthe compositional semantic value of an uttered sentence is the\nproposition that it expresses\u2014not quite its truth condition.\nWhile the utterance is true if that proposition holds and false if it\nfails to hold, Donnellan also thinks it may be true or false even if\nno proposition is generated. In particular, he proposes a rule that\nwould make a nonexistence statement true if generation fails in\nparticular way: specifically, if the historical explanation of its\nsingular subject\u2019s use does not serve to identify any\nappropriate individual.\n\nA different approach would replace\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d)\u2014which is just shorthand for a\ncluster condition\u2014with a truly metalinguistic condition, one\nthat includes the reference relation itself. Note that (10) entails\n(9b), given that C(\u201cMoses\u201d) is the condition that\ndetermines the referent of \u201cMoses\u201d.\n\n(10)\n  \\(\\neg\\exists\nx.\\textsf{refers}(\\textrm{\u201cMoses\u201d})(x) \\wedge\n  \\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x)) \\) \n\n\nMetalinguistic analyses of nonexistence statements face certain\nobjections. One is that \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d and its\ntranslation into French have different semantic values, since they say\nof different words that they don\u2019t refer to someone who once\nlived. This particular problem could be addressed if there was a\ncommon sense\u2014associated with at most one\nreferent\u2014expressed by English speakers uttering\n\u201cMoses\u201d and French speakers uttering its translation\n\u201cMo\u00efse\u201d (see Cumming 2013 for a proposal). The truth\ncondition could then replace parochial reference to language with\nreference to sense. If we let \\(\\delta\\) denote the sense expressed by\n\u201cMoses\u201d, then the truth condition would be:\n\n(11)\n\\( \\neg\\exists x.\\textsf{refers}(\\delta)(x) \\wedge\n\\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x)) \\) \n\n\nA further advantage of (11) is that we can give a compositional\nsemantics on which \u201cMoses\u201d contributes its sense,\n\\(\\delta\\), while the predicate contributes the existential\nquantification over the variable x as well as the relation\nconnecting the sense of an expression to its referent (glossed simply\nas refers in (11)). Musan (1997) and others\nhave given empirical arguments that a large class of predicates (those\nthat are not \u201cexistence independent\u201d in her terminology)\nhave such an existential component to their meaning. It is eminently\nreasonable to place \u201cexists\u201d in their company.\n\nA parallel compositional treatment of (10) would have\n\u201cMoses\u201d contributing itself (as though it occurred in a\nquotation). It perhaps seems more plausible, should we opt for (10),\nto carve the truth condition up differently, so that we assign\n\u201cMoses\u201d the metalinguistic meaning the individual\nreferred to by \u201cMoses\u201d. We will now turn to a\nconsideration of such a metalinguistic account of the meaning of\nnames.\n2.10 Metalinguistic Theories\n\nThe nominal phrase N in a definite description \u201cthe\nN\u201d contributes a condition that should be sufficient to\ndiscriminate the referent of the description from its local\ndistractors. If I felicitously utter \u201cthe red one\u201d, then\nyou should be able to successfully identify the referent I have in\nmind on the basis of its being red. In this case, the condition that\nserves for identification in context is not specific enough to\ndetermine the referent outright\u2014there are of course many red\nthings in existence other than the one I refer to.\n\nAs referring expressions, names can be seen to work in a similar way\n(compare Gray 2014: 216). In a felicitous utterance of\n\u201cAlice\u201d, some one individual is identified to the\naudience. In the case of names, the discriminating condition is\nmetalinguistic: the referent of the utterance is distinguished from\ndistractors by her feature of being called\n\u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis parallel suggests that a syntactic constituent of the\nname\u2014the proper nominal phrase\u2014contributes this\nmetalinguistic property; and the (generic) name \u201cAlice\u201d,\nas a whole, means the individual called\n\u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis compositional theory of a name\u2019s import is corroborated by\nseveral pieces of circumstantial evidence. First, many names,\nincluding certain names of places and things in English and of people\nin Greek and other languages, actually incorporate a definite\ndeterminer (\u201cthe\u201d in English). This suggests that names\nmight have a compositional semantics just like that of a definite\ndescription, where the determiner meaning combines with a property\ncontributed by the nominal complement to generate the meaning of the\noverall phrase.\n\nSecond, when a proper nominal occurs with other kinds of overt\ndeterminer, it often takes on a metalinguistic meaning (Sloat 1969;\nBurge 1973):\n\n(12) There are two\nAlices in my son\u2019s class.\n\n\nThe (proper) nominal \u201cAlice\u201d in (12) has a meaning one\nmight parse as being called \u201cAlice\u201d; or, even\nmore specifically, since (12) is a written sentence, as having a\nname spelled A-l-i-c-e (Gray 2015).\n\nOn the other hand, the metalinguistic property attributed to the\nproper nominal appears superfluous in accounting for the way a name\nidentifies its referent to the audience. The fact that the referent of\nthe speaker\u2019s use of \u201cAlice\u201d is called\n\u201cAlice\u201d is something that can reasonably be inferred from\nthe form of the referring expression alone, and doesn\u2019t require\naccess to its meaning. It is a familiar point that we should think\ntwice before attributing to meaning an inference that requires nothing\nmore than common sense (Grice 1975). Indeed, it is not clear that such\nan interpretation could belong to a conventional meaning, since a\nconvention requires a possible alternative, and there is no\nalternative to taking an utterance of \u201cAlice\u201d to narrow\nthe field to those individuals who are called \u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis brings us to a circularity objection brought against the\nmetalinguistic view (Strawson 1950: 340; Kripke 1980: 68\u201370).\nOne way of explicating having a name spelled A-l-i-c-e is to\nsay that there is a linguistic item\u2014a specific name with that\nspelling\u2014referring to one. Thus (12) says in effect that there\nare two individuals in the class referred to by such a name. This\nwould be consistent with an account on which specific names (unlike\nproper nominals occupying contexts like (12)) do not have a meaning,\ntheir reference being determined by use instead. More generally, this\nexplication treats the reference of specific names as the more basic\nnotion, defining the predicate meaning of the proper nominal in terms\nof such reference.\n\nTo think of names (not nominals) as having a metalinguistic meaning\nwhich then (partially) determines their reference, reverses this\npicture. Instead of the metalinguistic meaning being explicated in\nterms of the reference of specific names (satisfying a certain\nproperty), the reference of names would be explained with the help of\nthe metalinguistic meaning. To avoid a theory in which the explanation\ngoes in a circle, the metalinguistic predicate having a name\nspelled A-l-i-c-e must be explicated without appeal to the\nreference of names.\n\nFortunately, we already have the materials to attempt such an\nexplication. Back in\n Section 2.7,\n we distinguished the act of attributing a name to someone (previously\nidentified) from that of referring to someone with a name. It would be\nquite natural to interpret a metalinguistic predicate as applying to\nsomeone on the basis of a pattern of attribution, rather than a\npattern of reference. Indeed, the ordinary sense of \u201ccalling\nsomeone Alice\u201d is a reasonable gloss of the technical notion of\nattributing the name Alice to them (Evans in fact employs this\nterminology\u2014see his 1982: 383). So, for instance, I could not\nhave mistakenly called someone Alice without identifying them\nindependently, and people I refer to with a name but can\u2019t\nidentify independently\u2014for instance people whose names I am\nreading off a roll\u2014have not, intuitively speaking, been\ncalled that name by me.\n\nEven if name attribution is not the right way to ground metalinguistic\npredicates, any use theory, in attempting to explain the reference of\na name in terms of (distinct) features of its use, will have to employ\nsomething in its stead. Use theories and metalinguistic theories are\nin the same boat. While what ends up working for one won\u2019t\nnecessarily work for the other, it does not seem that the\nmetalinguistic theory is uniquely afflicted by a circularity\nobjection. Rather, both theories stand in need of a suitable reductive\nbase (for related discussion, see Burge 1973: 428; Geurts 1997:\n326\u2013327; Bach 2002: 83; Fara 2011; Gray 2014; Rami 2014: 858;\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2017: 25).\n\nThe decision whether to grant a metalinguistic meaning to names\nappears to come down to what is basic and what is generated in the\nsemantic theory. If the meaning of a name is generated from the\nmetalinguistic meaning of the constituent proper nominal, then names\nwill accordingly have a metalinguistic meaning (most likely in the\nform of a rule of use). If instead names are treated as basic by the\nsemantics, then there is less motivation to assign them such a meaning\n(we shouldn\u2019t simply do so by default, as already discussed in\n Section 2.5).\n\nTo treat both names and metalinguistically interpreted nominal\npredicates as semantically basic is generally thought to be inferior\ntheoretical economy (Gray 2017: 436\u2013437). But this is surely too\nquick; a nominal predicate, though semantically basic, would still\ncount as a natural expression of the metalinguistic property\nit denotes (see Johnson 2018), and the naturalness of the choice could\nexplain the prevalence of the convention across languages and its ease\nof uptake. In any event, a parallel attempt is made on the\nanti-metalinguistic side to generate the metalinguistic\ninterpretations of proper nominals from existing resources\n(Bo\u00ebr 1975: 395; Leckie 2013; Jeshion 2015: 381; Gray 2017).\nHowever, unless those basic resources include the references of names\n(and Gray 2017 argues that this is hardly a promising route), the\nmetalinguistic theory can help itself to the same thrift.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the metalinguistic account that says the\nmetalinguistic predicates are themselves basic, just that they are\nmore basic than the meanings of names constructed out of them.\n\nDialectically speaking, then, the crucial issue appears to be the\ncompositional derivation of the name\u2019s meaning. I will go over a\nlittle of the linguistic data that has appeared so far in the debate.\nMuch of this data would appear, out of context, as the sheerest\nminutia. But the fate of what has recently been regarded as the best\nprospect for assigning a meaning to a proper name comes down to the\ninterpretation of these details.\n\nFirstly, a problem arises for the metalinguistic account when the name\nincludes an overt determiner (Cumming 2007: 22). \u201cThe\nBronx\u201d consists of the determiner \u201cthe\u201d and the\nproper nominal \u201cBronx\u201d. According to a compositional\naccount of its meaning, it should refer to the most salient entity\ncalled \u201cBronx\u201d. However, the northernmost borough of New\nYork City is not called \u201cBronx\u201d; it is called \u201cthe\nBronx\u201d. Furthermore, despite the fact that this borough is\ncalled the Bronx, we do not refer to it using an expression that\ncombines a phrase that expresses this metalinguistic property with a\ndefinite determiner, as the compositional theory would predict. We\ndon\u2019t use \u201cthe the Bronx\u201d, which might be seen as\nsuch a combination (with \u201cthe Bronx\u201d expressing the\nproperty of being called the Bronx). Nor is it plausible that\n\u201cthe Bronx\u201d sports a covert definite determiner, as the\novert \u201cthe\u201d is not fused with \u201cBronx\u201d into a\nproper nominal phrase, but is dropped in such expressions as \u201ca\nBronx resident\u201d.\n\nThis drawback of the metalinguistic theory is concealed when we\nrestrict our consideration to proper names that can\noccur\u2014optionally or obligatorily\u2014without an article, names\nsuch as \u201cAlice\u201d or \u201c(the) George Washington\nBridge\u201d. The George Washington Bridge also happens to be called\nGeorge Washington Bridge\u2014in the sense that people also refer to\nit this way (and attribute the name sans article to it). But this\nappears an accident of naming, rather than a vindication of the\ncompositional view. There are many names that fit the formula of\n\u201cthe Bronx\u201d instead. The World Cup is not, properly\nspeaking, called (just) World Cup; the Eiffel Tower is not called\nEiffel Tower (the way Sears Tower is); the Mona Lisa is not called\nMona Lisa (though its subject, Lisa del Giocondo, was; and\ninterestingly, we would say that the painting is titled Mona\nLisa).\n\nThe situation is different if we confine our attention to personal\nnames. As mentioned earlier, in many languages outside English,\npersonal names come with a (definite) determiner. Matushansky (2008:\n580\u2013581) provides evidence for a cross-linguistic pattern of\ndropping the determiner on personal names in naming environments like\n\u201cis called\u201d, just as the compositional account would\npredict.\n\nA problem remains even for a curtailed version of the metalinguistic\nview on which it applies only to personal names. It can be brought out\nwith data from English. It was originally claimed that \u201cthe\nAlice\u201d (with neutral stress on \u201cthe\u201d) was\nungrammatical, and hence that \u201cAlice\u201d accompanied by a\nnull determiner with the same meaning as \u201cthe\u201d filled its\nslot in the paradigm (Sloat 1969). However, \u201cthe Alice\u201d is\nnot ungrammatical, merely unusual. It is used when the possession of\nthe relevant metalinguistic property is particularly prominent. For\ninstance, when sorting people into groups based on their names, or\ncollecting examples of people with a particular name (Jeshion 2017:\n235; Gray 2017: 452).\n\nCritics of the metalinguistic view have noted subtle differences in\ninterpretation that prevent us from treating \u201cAlice\u201d as\nequivalent to the more clearly metalinguistic phrase \u201cthe\nAlice\u201d. In each pair below, the (b) member allows the individual\nwho counts as the Alice to vary with the occasion, while the (a)\nmember doesn\u2019t (Hawthorne & Manley 2012: 236\u2013237; Fara\n2015c; Schoubye 2016).\n\n(13)\n\na.\nIn every race, Alice won.\nb.\nIn every race, the Alice won.\n\n(14)\n\na.\nAlice always cheats.\nb.\nThe Alice always cheats.\n\n\n\nAnother difference is that \u201cthe Alice\u201d licenses subsequent\none-anaphora, while \u201cAlice\u201d does not (King 2006; Jeshion\n2017: 238):\n\n(15)\n\na. You\u2019re too late. The Alice just left\n    \u2026but maybe another one will show up.\nb. You\u2019re too late. Alice just left \u2026but\n    maybe another one will show up.\n\n\n\nA natural explanation of these differences is that a compositional\nsemantics on which the proper nominal contribute a metalinguistic\nproperty is correct for \u201cthe Alice\u201d, but not for\n\u201cAlice\u201d.",
