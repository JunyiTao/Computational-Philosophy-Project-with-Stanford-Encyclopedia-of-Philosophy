    "main_text": "Independence and Nationhood: The Formative Years\n2. Independence and Nationhood: The Formative Years\n\nPhilosophers in the immediate post-independence period, and up to the\narrival of Positivism in the 1860s, had to confront the complexities\nof the changing relations between Church and State. The independence\nstruggle which pitted Chileans against Chileans had been a struggle\nagainst arbitrary and unstable colonial rule, not against the Catholic\nChurch. On the contrary, the Church was seen as an indispensable ally\nin the building of new republican institutions. Hence, all Chilean\nconstitutional documents in the nineteenth century proclaimed\nCatholicism as the official religion of the State. As a result, public\ninstitutions, including educational institutions, had to conform to\nCatholic doctrine. Because most philosophers were believers this\nlimitation did not necessarily mean a problem. But as philosophers\nthey were compelled to examine doctrines and schools that were secular\nor even antagonistic to Catholicism. In such cases they discussed the\ndoctrines but suppressed that which could be seen as beyond the pale\nof the Catholic Church. As a result, a thinker like David Hume could\nbe commented upon but in the end heavily criticized because of his\nskepticism. A school such a French Id\u00e9ologie could be\ndiscussed, but again deprived of its most materialistic edges. The\noutlet for philosophical production was by and large the secondary\nschool textbook, which had to be approved by the appropriate\ngovernmental mechanisms, and this usually meant applying Catholic\nChurch criteria for the philosophically permissible and the\ntheologically acceptable. There was no room for openly anti-Catholic\ntracts such as Francisco Bilbao\u2019s Sociabilidad chilena\n(1844, collected in 1866), which ended up burnt for blasphemy and\nimmorality.\n\nPhilosophers still found ways to be true to their discipline, and yet\nrecognize the constraints imposed by Catholicism as the official\nreligion of the State. Perhaps the best example is the work of\nAndr\u00e9s Bello (1781\u20131865), who explored a wide range of\nphilosophical sources, especially those of the Scottish Enlightenment.\nHowever, he never questioned the importance of religion in general,\nand Catholicism in particular. His Filosof\u00eda del\nentendimiento was published posthumously in 1881, but substantial\nparts of this work appeared in the 1840s.\n\nBello\u2019s Filosof\u00eda shows an important\nacquaintance, and much agreement, with the work of Thomas Reid, Thomas\nBrown, and Dugald Stewart. Bello\u2019s main emphasis in this work\nwas the acquisition of ideas, which he considered the central endeavor\nof the discipline. His work was divided in two parts, namely,\npsychology and logic. For Bello, philosophy\u2019s task was the\nappropriate understanding of the origin of ideas, and the guiding of\nhuman actions. In the process, Bello engaged the thought of John Locke\nand George Berkeley seriously, although by no means uncritically. The\nimpact of Bello\u2019s philosophical work was limited at first, but\nit spread rapidly to other countries in the region in the twentieth\ncentury, and became one of the few works by a Latin American\nphilosopher to be fully translated into English (1984).\n\nAnd yet, perhaps the most important, in the sense of the most widely\nused philosophical text in Chile was the Curso de filosof\u00eda\nmoderna by Ram\u00f3n Brise\u00f1o (1814\u20131910),\npublished in two volumes in 1845\u201346. Compared to Bello\u2019s\ncontribution, Brise\u00f1o\u2019s work was far more partial to\nCatholicism, and thus had an easy entry into the curricula of public\nand private schools. Multiple editions appeared during the remainder\nof the nineteenth century. Brise\u00f1o\u2019s partiality to an\nidea of philosophy closely linked to religion is evident in his\ncoverage of ethics and natural law, where he argued that the practice\nof religion was the most important duty of a human being, and\nconcluded that \u201cany philosophy that does not lead to the\nconclusions of Christianity is dangerous and false\u201d (1846: 216).\nWhile Andr\u00e9s Bello did not entirely disagree with the religious\nemphasis of the work, he objected to the poor coverage of logic, which\nin Brise\u00f1o\u2019s treatment was limited to deductive logic.\nHence it can be observed that the larger polemic concerning the role\nof religion was manifest in the choice of subfields for the teaching\nof the discipline.\n\nAlthough philosophy developed in an academic context in the post\nindependence period, and helped define the mission of the University\nof Chile when it was founded in 1842 (Andr\u00e9s Bello crafted the\nstatutes of the institution and became its Rector for the next 23\nyears), other philosophers brought the discipline closer to political\naction. The most important example is Jos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria\n(1817\u20131888) who advocated the elimination of the colonial\nlegacies still embedded in the Church, and in authoritarian practices\nthat prevented free individual initiative and expression. Be it\nthrough his congressional seat, his role as founder of the Liberal\nParty (1849), or his copious writings, Lastarria promoted the main\ntenets of liberalism and articulated a coherent philosophy of history\nfirmly based on Enlightenment thought. Other thinkers who contributed\nto the development of liberal views in Chile included the Argentine\nexiles Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (1811\u20131888) and Juan Bautista\nAlberdi (1819\u20131884), who presented their ideas in various widely\ncirculated writings, some of them of a philosophical nature, and\nthrough vigorous polemics in the press.\n",
