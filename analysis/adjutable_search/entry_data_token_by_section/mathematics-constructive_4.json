    "main_text": "Varieties of Constructive Mathematics || Recursive Constructive Mathematics\n3.2 Recursive Constructive Mathematics\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the\ndevelopment of an alternative form of constructive mathematics,\nRUSS, which is, essentially,\n recursive function\n theory with intuitionistic logic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In\nthis variety the objects are defined by means of\nG\u00f6del-numberings, and the procedures are all recursive; the main\ndistinction between RUSS and the classical recursive analysis\ndeveloped after the work of Turing, Church, and others in 1936\nclarified the nature of computable processes is that the logic used in\nRUSS is intuitionistic.\n\nOne obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips\nwith RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion\ntheory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of\nKushner\u2019s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for\nwondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be\ntempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on\nclassical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one\ncan get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman\n[1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]).\n\nFirst, we define a set \\(S\\) to be countable if there is a\nmapping from a detachable subset of \\(\\bN\\) onto \\(S\\). With\nintuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every subset of \\(\\bN\\) is\ndetachable (the reader is invited to provide a Brouwerian example to\ndemonstrate this). Countable subsets of \\(\\bN\\) in Richman\u2019s\naxiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively enumerable sets\nin the normal development of RUSS.\n\nBy a partial function on \\(\\bN\\) we mean a mapping whose\ndomain is a subset of \\(\\bN\\); if the domain is \\(\\bN\\) itself, then\nwe call the function a total function on \\(\\bN\\).\nRichman\u2019s approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and\na single axiom of computable partial functions\n(CPF):\n\nThere is an enumeration \\(\\phi_0 ,\\phi_1,\\ldots\\) of the set of all\npartial functions from \\(\\bN\\) to \\(\\bN\\) with countable domains.\n\nIt is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this\nprinciple. For example, we can prove the following result, which\nalmost immediately shows that LLPO, and hence LPO, are\nfalse in the recursive setting. \n\nThere is a total function \\(f : \\bN \\times \\bN \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\)\nsuch that\n\n\nfor each \\(m\\) there exists at most one \\(n\\) such that \\(f(m,n) =\n1\\); and\nfor each total function \\(f : \\bN \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\), there\nexist \\(m,k\\) in \\(\\bN\\) such that \\(f(m,2k+f(m)) = 1\\).\n\n\n\nOf more interest, however, are results such as the following within\nRUSS. \n\nSpecker\u2019s Theorem (Specker [1949]): There exists a\nstrictly increasing sequence \\((r_1 ,r_2,\\ldots)\\) of rational numbers\nin the closed interval \\([0,1]\\) such that for each \\(x \\in \\bR\\)\nthere exist \\(N \\in \\bN\\) and \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\abs{x -\nr_n} \\ge \\delta\\) for all \\(n \\ge N\\).\n For each \\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\), there exists a sequence \\((I_1\n,I_2,\\ldots)\\), of bounded open intervals in \\(\\bR\\) such that \\(\\bR\n\\subseteq \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n\\) and \\(\\sum_{n=1}^N \\abs{I_n}\n\\lt \\varepsilon\\) for each N. (Such a sequence of intervals is called\nan \\(\\varepsilon\\)-singular cover of \\(\\bR\\).) \nThere exists a pointwise continuous function \\(f : [0,1]\n\\rightarrow \\bR\\) that is not uniformly continuous.\nThere exists a positive-valued uniformly continuous function \\(f :\n[0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) whose infimum is 0.\n\n\nFrom a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one\nrealises that words such as \u201cfunction\u201d and \u201creal\nnumber\u201d should be interpreted as \u201crecursive\nfunction\u201d and \u201crecursive real number\u201d respectively.\nNote that the second of the above four recursive theorems is a strong\nrecursive counterexample to the open-cover compactness property of the\n(recursive) real line; and the fourth is a recursive counterexample to\nthe classical theorem that every uniformly continuous mapping of a\ncompact set into \\(\\bR\\) attains its infimum.\n",
