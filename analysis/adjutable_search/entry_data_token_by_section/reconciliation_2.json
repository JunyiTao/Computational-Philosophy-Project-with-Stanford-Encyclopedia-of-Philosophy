    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation\n3. Processes of Reconciliation\n\nProcesses of reconciliation are designed to contribute to the\nimprovement of relationships damaged as a result of wrongdoing. A wide\nrange of such processes is examined in the literature. One that is\nbrought up, more often in the context of objections to reconciliation\nrather than defenses, is forgetting (Hughes 2001, Bhargava 2012).\nSince the past cannot be changed, wrongdoing cannot be undone.\nTherefore, one might argue, the only way to overcome a painful past is\nto suppress the memory of it. Policies of forgetting in the name of\nreconciliation have been pursued by some states, including Cambodia,\nwhose prime minister advised his fellow citizens in 1999 \u201cto dig\na hole and bury the past,\u201d while granting amnesty from\nprosecution to Khmer Rouge leaders (Chandler 2003, 310).\n\nHowever, those theorists who defend the political and moral value of\nreconciliation more often reject the claim that reconciliation\nrequires forgetting. Instead, these defenders generally claim that\nknowledge and acknowledgement of wrongdoing, as well as recognition of\nthe victims, are crucial to successful reconciliation. Especially in\npolitical contexts, knowledge of basic facts is critical because often\nvictims and the broader political community do not know who was\nresponsible for the wrong suffered, nor the extent of violations\ncommitted. Acknowledgement refers to the official, public recognition\nof what happened. This is often needed to counter official denial of\nwrongdoing or responsibility for wrongdoing (Weschler 1998). The\nunspoken, Freudian assumption is that suppressed traumas will\ninevitably reemerge in destructive ways. The more explicit arguments\nare that the acknowledgement of wrongs and of victims helps heal\npsychic wounds (van Ness and Strong 2002), enable trust (Gibson 2004),\nreestablish normative standards for behavior (Walker 2006), and\nreassert that the victims are indeed members of the moral or political\ncommunity (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, du Toit 2000).\n\nAs will be discussed below, while there is wide agreement that the\nprocesses of reconciliation must acknowledge the wrongs of the past\nand the proper standing of victims, theorists debate precisely how\nsuch acknowledgements are best communicated, so that they will be\nsufficiently credible and effective in improving future relations.\nMore broadly, theorists debate how effective past processes of\nreconciliation have proven to be, and how to measure effectiveness\n(Bates et al. 2020)\n\nThere is also ongoing debate in the political realm about which wrongs\nmust be acknowledged and redressed. Violations of civil and political\nrights have historically been the focus of both theory and practice,\nbut scholars also argue for the importance of addressing violations of\neconomic and cultural rights (Mamdani 2000, Arbour 2007, Sharp 2015).\nTheorists also disagree about what else, besides acknowledgement, must\nbe achieved in order for reconciliation to be either likely or\nwarranted. Must material forms of harm be redressed? Must retributive\njustice be achieved? Must the parties forgive? Disagreements about\nidentifying necessary or appropriate processes are typically connected\nto the issue of the last section: disagreements about what degree of\nimprovement in relations can reasonably be pursued in the aftermath of\nwrongdoing. Finally, there is debate about who should decide which\nprocess of reconciliation is adopted in a given context. In the\npolitical context, this is in response to calls for greater local\nagency and decision-making (McEvoy 2007).\n",
