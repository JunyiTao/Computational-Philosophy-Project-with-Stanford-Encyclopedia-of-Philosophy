    "main_text": "Language and Being || Ontology\n3.2 Ontology\nSellars often described his realistic naturalism as\n\u2018nominalistic,\u2019 but the point is not so much to deny that\nthere are abstracta as to tell us what language that uses abstract\nsingular terms is doing for us and how differently it functions from\nlanguage using concrete singular terms. If we understand how abstract\nsingular terms function, the claims of the Platonist metaphysician\nseem an elaborate (and perhaps misleading) way to make a simpler, more\npragmatic point.  First, Sellars argues that the then-prevalent\nstandard of ontological commitment \u2014being the value of a\nvariable of quantification\u2014 is mistaken (GE, NAO).  Such a\ncriterion makes the indeterminate reference of quantified variables\nmore primitive than any form of determinate reference. This is\nincompatible with Sellars\u2019s understanding of naturalism, and he\nclaims it also gets the grammar of existence claims wrong.  (Sellars\nconstrues quantification substitutionally; see Lance 1996.)  Sellars\nproposes a different standard: we are committed to the kinds of things\nwe can explicitly name and classify in the ground-level, empirical,\nobject-language statements we take to be true.\nIn ordinary language we often talk about meanings, properties,\npropositions, etc., thus apparently committing ourselves to the\nexistence of such abstracta.  Sellars interprets such talk as material\nmode metalinguistic speech about the functional roles of\nexpression-kinds.  Thus, a sentence such as\n\nEuclidean triangularity entails having angles that sum to two right angles\n\n\nconveys information about the function of the \u2022triangle\u2022,\nnamely, that its use (in Euclidean contexts)entitles one to a\n\u2022has angles summing to two right angles\u2022.  Similarly,\nSellars interprets fact-talk as material mode metalinguistic speech\nabout truths.  The only things to which we are ontologically committed\nby the use of abstract singular terms are linguistic items:\nspecifically, expression-tokens that participate in complex causal\nsystems which involve, inter alia, normatively assessable interactions\nbetween language users and the world.  In Sellars\u2019s\nreconstruction of it, talk of abstract entities does not have\nexplanatory force, but is involved in making explicit certain\nlinguistic norms.\nPlatonic realists are often moved by the belief that the most basic\nlinguistic structure, predication itself, involves a commitment to\nabstracta, for common explications of predication make essential\nmention of properties, relations, and such.  Sellars argues that this\ngets the order of explication exactly wrong: apparently purely\ndescriptive claims about property instantiation are, in fact,\nmisleading ways of communicating norms of linguistic\ncorrectness. Sellars offers a different explication of predication,\naccording to which the focus is not on any relation between an object\nand some abstract entity, but qualifying and arranging names to suit\nthem for certain linguistic purposes. So understood, the Platonist\u2019s\ntreatment of predication seems, again, to be an elaborate and\nmisleading way to make a simpler, more pragmatic point. At the most\nbasic, atomic level, predication is a matter of endowing names\nwith counterpart characteristics of the objects they purport to name,\nenabling some true atomic sentences to \u2018map\u2019 or\n\u2018picture\u2019 objects in the world. Predication thus commits\none only to natural objects potentially correlated with each other.\nNAO, chapter 3, contains the most complete statement of this view. \nSellars gives a unified treatment of the alethic, causal, and\ndeontic modalities as (once again) material mode metalinguistic speech\nexpressing the inferential commitments and priorities embedded in the\nlanguage.  Thus, using modal language in talking about the world and\nour agency in the world does not commit us to recognizing\nindependent, metaphysically real necessary connections or the existence of moral\nfacts independent of moral agents.  It does commit us to prescribing\nand proscribing certain linguistic or conceptual transitions, including\nlanguage-exit transitions that emerge in action.  As Robert Kraut\ndescribes it, \u201cmetaphysical claims that initially appear to\nstate language-world connections\u2014claims about the relation\nbetween predicates and properties, for example\u2014are, on\nSellars\u2019s theory, construed as normative claims about\nappropriate linguistic usage\u201d (Kraut 2010: 601).\n",
