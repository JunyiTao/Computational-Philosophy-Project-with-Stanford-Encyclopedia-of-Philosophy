    "main_text": "The Demands of Democratic Participation || The Problem of Democratic Participation\n4.1 The Problem of Democratic Participation\n\nA vexing problem of democratic theory has been to determine whether\nordinary citizens are up to the task of governing a large and complex\nsociety. There are three distinct problems here:\n\n1. First, Plato argued that some people are more intelligent and\ninformed about political matters than others and have a superior moral\ncharacter, and that those persons ought to rule (The\nRepublic, Book VI)\n2. Second, others have argued that a society must have a division\nof labor. If everyone were engaged in the complex and difficult task\nof politics, little time or energy would be left for the other\nessential tasks of a society. Conversely, if we expect most people to\nengage in other difficult and complex tasks, how can we expect them to\nhave the time and resources sufficient to devote themselves\nintelligently to politics?\n3. Third, since individuals have so little impact on the outcomes\nof political decision making in large societies, they have little\nsense of responsibility for the outcomes. Some have argued that it is\nnot rational to vote since the chances that an individual\u2019s vote\nwill a decide the outcome of an election (i.e., will determine whether\na candidate gets elected or not) are nearly indistinguishable from\nzero. For example, one widely accepted estimate puts the odds of an\nindividual casting the deciding vote in a United States presidential\nelection at 1 in 100 million. Many estimates put the odds much lower.\nWorse still, Anthony Downs has argued that almost all of those who do\nvote have little reason to become informed about how best to vote\n(Downs 1957: ch.13). On the assumption that citizens reason and behave\nroughly according to the Downsian model, either the society must in\nfact be run by a relatively small group of people with minimal input\nfrom the rest or it will be very poorly run. As we can see these\ncriticisms are echoes of the sorts of criticisms Plato and Hobbes\nmade.\n\n\nThese observations pose challenges for any robustly egalitarian or\ndeliberative conception of democracy. Without the ability to\nparticipate intelligently in politics one cannot use one\u2019s votes\nto advance one\u2019s aims nor can one be said to participate in a\nprocess of reasoned deliberation among equals. So, either equality of\npolitical power implies a kind of self-defeating equal participation\nof citizens in politics or a reasonable division of labor seems to\nundermine equality of power. And either substantial participation of\ncitizens in public deliberation entails the relative neglect of other\ntasks or the proper functioning of the other sectors of the society\nrequires that most people do not participate intelligently in public\ndeliberation.\n",
