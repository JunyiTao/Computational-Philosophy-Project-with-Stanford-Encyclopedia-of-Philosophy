    "main_text": "The aggregation of judgments || Probabilistic opinion pooling\n5.5 Probabilistic opinion pooling\n\nA distinct and framework-transcendent way of avoiding the\nimpossibility results of judgment aggregation is to give up the binary\n(\u2018Yes\u2019/\u2018No\u2019,\n\u2018True\u2019/\u2018False\u2019) format of judgments and to\nassume that they take the form of subjective probabilities or\ncredences. The resulting aggregation problem is that of\nprobabilistic opinion pooling (Stone 1961; Acze\u0301l and\nWagner 1980; Lehrer and Wagner 1981; McConway 1981; Genest and Zidek\n1986; and Mongin 1995). Some key works on it predate the contemporary\nliterature on \u2018binary\u2019 judgment aggregation, but the\nproblem has recently received renewed attention.\n\nIn this probabilistic rather than binary setting, each individual \\(i\n\\in N\\) has an opinion function \\(Pr_i\\) on a given agenda\n\\(X\\) (which is here typically an algebra of propositions), where, for\neach \\(p \\in X\\), \\(Pr_i(p)\\) is the subjective probability or degree\nof belief (a real number in the interval [0,1]) that individual \\(i\\)\nassigns to \\(p\\). The function \\(Pr_i\\) is normally assumed to be\nprobabilistically\n coherent.[15]\n The aim is to find an opinion pooling rule, again denoted\n\\(F\\), which assigns to each admissible profile \\(\\langle Pr_1,\nPr_2,\\ldots, Pr_n\\rangle\\) of individual opinion functions a\ncollective opinion function \\(Pr\\), which should ideally also be\nprobabilistically coherent. For each \\(p \\in X, Pr(p)\\) is interpreted\nas the subjective probability or degree of belief that is collectively\nassigned to \\(p\\). A structurally similar aggregation problem can be\nfound in the literature on peer disagreement, where an individual\nepistemic agent seeks to reconcile several potentially conflicting\nassignments of probabilities to some propositions\u2014typically the\nagent\u2019s own probability assignment and those of some epistemic\npeers\u2014so as to\u00a0arrive at an all-things-considered\nprobability assignment (for an overview, see, e.g., Christensen and\nLackey 2013).\n\nA classic result shows that, in this probabilistic framework,\nconditions similar to those leading to an impossibility in the binary\ncase can now be non-trivially satisfied. These conditions are:\n\n\nUniversal domain: The domain of \\(F\\) is the set of all\nlogically possible profiles of probabilistically coherent opinion\nfunctions on \\(X\\).\n\nCollective coherence: For any profile \\(\\langle Pr_1,\nPr_2,\\ldots, Pr_n\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(F\\), the collectively\nassigned opinion function \\(Pr\\) on \\(X\\) is probabilistically\ncoherent.\n\nZero preservation: For any profile \\(\\langle Pr_1,\nPr_2,\\ldots, Pr_n\\rangle\\) and proposition \\(p \\in X\\), if \\(Pr_i(p) =\n0\\) for all \\(i \\in N\\), then the collectively assigned probability is\n\\(Pr(p) = 0\\).\n\nIndependence: For any two profiles \\(\\langle Pr_1,\nPr_2,\\ldots, Pr_n\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle Pr^*_1, Pr^*_2, \\ldots\n,Pr^*_n\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(F\\) and any \\(p \\in X\\), if for\nall \\(i \\in N\\) \\(Pr_i(p) = Pr^*_i(p)\\), then \\(Pr(p) = Pr^*(p)\\).\n\n\nThe following holds:\n\n\nTheorem (Acze\u0301l and Wagner 1980; McConway 1981): Suppose\n\\(X\\) is an algebra containing more than two contingent,\nnon-equivalent proposition-negation pairs. Then a probabilistic\nopinion pooling rule satisfies universal domain, collective coherence,\nzero preservation, and independence if and only if it is a linear\npooling rule.\n\n\nSuch a rule is defined as follows. Let \\(w_1, w_2 , \\ldots ,w_n \\ge\n0\\) be an assignment of weights to the \\(n\\) individuals with\n\\(w_{1\u00a0}+ w_{2\u00a0}+ \\ldots_{\u00a0}+ w_n = 1\\). Then the\ncorresponding linear pooling rule assigns to each profile\n\\(\\langle Pr_1, Pr_2,\\ldots, Pr_n\\rangle\\) of probabilistically\ncoherent opinion functions the collective opinion function \\(Pr = w_1\nPr_1 + w_2 Pr_2 + \\ldots + w_n Pr_n.\\) Thus the collective probability\nassigned to each proposition \\(p \\in X\\) is a weighted linear average\nof the individual probabilities assigned to \\(p\\). Linear pooling\nrules range from ones with perfectly equal weights (which thereby\nsatisfy anonymity) to ones that concentrate all weight on one\nindividual (i.e., dictatorships). A noteworthy lesson is that\nessentially the same conditions that characterize the class of\ndictatorial aggregation rules in the case of binary judgment\naggregation now characterize the class of linear pooling rules.\n\nAt first sight, one might think that probabilistic opinion pooling is\nfree from any troubling impossibility results. However, linear\npooling, and thus any opinion pooling rule satisfying the above-stated\nconditions, has some defects. The first is this. Suppose we require\nthat whenever all individuals consider two propositions \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\) probabilistically independent (perhaps conditional on a third\nproposition \\(r)\\), this probabilistic independence judgment be\npreserved in the collective probability assignments. A rationale for\nrequiring this is that judgments of probabilistic independence may\nencode insights about which propositions (or events described by them)\nare causally relevant or irrelevant to which others. Unfortunately,\nhowever, linear pooling (except in its degenerate dictatorial form)\ndoes not generally preserve unanimously held conditional independence\njudgments (Genest and Wagner 1987), and so we would again get an\nimpossibility result if we added this preservation requirement to our\nlist of earlier conditions, together with non-dictatorship. \u00a0\n\nThe second defect is the following. Suppose the individuals in \\(N\\)\nlearn some new information that prompts them to revise their opinions\non the propositions in \\(X\\), where revision takes the form of\nBayesian conditionalization or some generalization of it. It is\nplausible to require that if we aggregate their post-revision\nprobability assignments, the result will be the same as the one we\nwould have got if we had first aggregated the pre-revision probability\nassignments and then revised the resulting collective probability\nassignments on the basis of the learnt information. More formally\nexpressed, suppose \\(L\\) is the learnt information, and suppose \\(Pr_1\n|L, Pr_2 |L, \\ldots ,Pr_n|L\\) are the results of conditionalizing the\n\\(n\\) individuals\u2019 opinion functions on the new\n information.[16]\n Then, assuming that all the profiles involved are in the domain of\nour opinion pooling rule, we require that aggregation (via \\(F)\\) and\nrevision (via |) commute, i.e.,\n\n\n\\(F(Pr_1 |L, Pr_2 |L,\\ldots, Pr_n|L) = F(Pr_1, Pr_2,\\ldots,\nPr_n)|L\\).\n\n\nAgain, linear pooling (except in its degenerate dictatorial form) does\nnot generally satisfy this requirement (often called \u2018external\nBayesianity\u2019), and so we would also get an impossibility result\nif we added it to our list of conditions, together with\nnon-dictatorship (Madansky 1964). Subsequent work has shown that if we\naggregate probabilities by geometric rather than linear averaging, we\ncan make aggregation and revision commute (Genest 1984; Genest et al.\n1986), though we must then lift the independence requirement on the\nopinion pooling rule. This finding has been picked up in more recent\nwork and has sparked a small but growing philosophical literature on\nBayesian group beliefs (e.g., Dietrich 2010, 2019; Russell, Hawthorne,\nand Buchak 2015; and Baccelli and Stewart 2020). The key question here\nis this: under what conditions can a group whose opinions are given by\naggregating its members\u2019 opinions constitute a rational Bayesian\nagent?\n\nOther work has considered probabilistic opinion pooling with general\n(i.e., non-algebra) agendas (Dietrich and List 2017) and with\nimprecise probabilities (Stewart and Ojea Quintana 2018), as well as\nmore general forms of attitude aggregation, which subsume binary\njudgment aggregation, probability/credence aggregation, and Arrovian\npreference aggregation as special cases (e.g., Dietrich and List\n2010b; Dokow and Holzman 2010c).\n",
