He added a dedication\nto Pope Paul III (r. 1534\u20131549), probably for political reasons,\nin which he expressed his hesitancy about publishing the work and the\nreasons he finally decided to publish it. He gave credit to\nSch\u00f6nberg and Giese for encouraging him to publish and omitted\nmention of Rheticus, but it would have been insulting to the pope\nduring the tense period of the Reformation to give credit to a\nProtestant\n minister.[11]\n He dismissed critics who might have claimed that it was against the\nBible by giving the example of the fourth-century Christian apologist\nLactantius, who had rejected the spherical shape of the earth, and by\nasserting, \u201cAstronomy is written for astronomers\u201d\n(Revolutions,\n 5).[12]\n In other words, theologians should not meddle with it. He pointed to\nthe difficulty of calendar reform because the motions of the heavenly\nbodies were inadequately known. And he called attention to the fact\nthat \u201cif the motions of the other planets are correlated with\nthe orbiting of the earth, and are computed for the revolution of each\nplanet, not only do their phenomena follow therefrom but also the\norder and size of all the planets and spheres, and heaven itself is so\nlinked together that in no portion of it can anything be shifted\nwithout disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a\nwhole\u201d (Revolutions, 5).\n\nRheticus returned to Wittenberg in 1541 and the following year\nreceived another leave of absence, at which time he took the\nmanuscript of the Revolutions to Petreius for publishing in\nNuremberg. Rheticus oversaw the printing of most of the text. However,\nRheticus was forced to leave Nuremberg later that year because he was\nappointed professor of mathematics at the University of Leipzig. He\nleft the rest of the management of printing the Revolutions\nto Andrew Osiander (1498\u20131552), a Lutheran minister who was also\ninterested in mathematics and astronomy. Though he saw the project\nthrough, Osiander appended an anonymous preface to the work. In it he\nclaimed that Copernicus was offering a hypothesis, not a true account\nof the working of the heavens: \u201cSince he [the astronomer] cannot\nin any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever\nsuppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly from the\nprinciples of geometry for the future as well as for the past\n\u2026these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable\u201d\n(Revolutions, xvi). This clearly contradicted the body of the\nwork. Both Rheticus and Giese protested, and Rheticus crossed it out\nin his copy.\n",
