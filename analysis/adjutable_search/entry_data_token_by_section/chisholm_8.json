Metaphysics V \u2014 \u201cChisholm\u2019s Paradox\u201d\n\nChisholm\u2019s paper \u201cIdentity through Possible Worlds: Some\nQuestions\u201d (1967b) was the lead article in the first issue the\nnew journal No\u00fbs in 1967. In that article, Chisholm\npresented an argument that provoked a remarkable amount of discussion\nand debate. A variant of the argument was subsequently presented in\nChisholm\u2019s \u201cParts as Essential to Their Wholes\u201d,\nwhich was Chisholm\u2019s Presidential Address at the Metaphysical\nSociety of America in 1973. This essay corresponds closely to Appendix\nB of [P&O]. The puzzles presented in those papers have come to be\nknown as versions of \u201cChisholm\u2019s Paradox\u201d (though it\nmust be pointed out that the term \u2018Chisholm\u2019s\nParadox\u2019 is also widely taken to refer to the problem about\ncontrary to duty imperatives that is discussed below in Section\n11).\n\nChisholm\u2019s target in the 1967b paper was a popular collection of\nviews about the metaphysics of modality. Many philosophers \u2014\ngoing back perhaps to Leibniz \u2014 seem to presuppose these views\nin their discussions of necessity and possibility. The central\ndoctrine is that there are many possible worlds. The actual world is\njust one among them, distinguished by the fact that what happens here\nis what actually happens. To say that a statement is true is\njust to say that it is true at the actual world. To say that\na statement is possible is just to say that it is true at\nsome possible world. To say that a statement is necessary is just\nto say that it is true at every possible world. Thus we have\nan account of de dicto modality.\n\nOn one typical construal, it is assumed that an individual who exists\nhere at the actual world also exists at many other possible worlds.\nWhen we say that a certain individual actually has a certain\nproperty, we mean that he has that property at the actual world. To\nsay that he possibly has that property is just to say that he\nhas that property at some possible world. To say that he\nnecessarily has that property is just to say that he has that\nproperty at every possible world where he exists at all. This\ngives us an account of de re modality. But it also generates\nquestions.\n\nChisholm imagines that Adam and Noah exist here in the actual world,\nw1, and that each of them has his own collection\nof properties. He assumes (following Genesis 5) that Adam\nactually lives to the age of 930 years, whereas Noah lives to the age\nof 950 years. Chisholm asks us to imagine a nearby possible world in\nwhich Adam lives one more year, dying at age 931 instead of 930, and\nin which Noah lives one year less, dying at age 949 instead of 950. By\nimagining further similar one year alterations in life-span, we\nfinally reach a possible world in which Adam lives to the age of 950\nand Noah lives to the age of 930. Thus, in that world Adam and Noah\nhave \u201cswapped ages\u201d. In that world Adam has the age that\nNoah has in w1, and Noah has the age that Adam has\nin w1.\n\nChisholm then continues by imagining a series of worlds in which Adam\nand Noah gradually swap letters in their names. This series ends with\na world in which they have \u201cswapped names\u201d altogether. In\nthat world, Adam is called \u2018Noah\u2019, and Noah is called\n \u2018Adam\u2019.[5]\n Going still further, Chisholm imagines a world,\nwn, in which Adam and Noah have swapped\nall their qualitative properties, so that in\nwn Adam has all the properties that Noah\nhas in w1, and Noah has all the properties that\nAdam has in w1. Then Chisholm asks a series of\ntough questions:\n\nShould we say of the Adam of wn that he\nis identical with the Noah of w1 and should we say\nof the Noah of wn that he is identical\nwith the Adam of w1? In other words, is there an\nx such that x is Adam in w1 and\nx is Noah in wn, and is there a\ny such that y is Noah in w1 and\ny is Adam in wn? And how are we\nto decide? \u2026 aren\u2019t the two Adams, the two Noahs, and the\ntwo worlds indiscernible? Could God possibly have had a sufficient\nreason for creating w1 instead of\nwn? (3\u20134)\n\nChisholm extends the example. He points out that what has happened to\nAdam and Noah could happen to anyone. Let us say that a person\u2019s\n\u201crole\u201d in a world is defined by the set of qualitative\nproperties he has there. We can say that a possible world,\nws, is a \u201crole swapping\nworld\u201d of the actual world, w1, just in case\nthe roles being played in ws are\nprecisely the same as the roles being played in\nw1, but at least some of those roles are being\nplayed in ws by someone other than the\nperson who plays the role in w1. Role swapping\nworlds will therefore be indiscernible from each other and from the\nactual world except for the bare identities of the individuals playing\nthe roles. Chisholm says:\n\n\u2026 there may be good ground for the existentialist\u2019s\nangst; since, it would seem, God could have had no sufficient\nreason for choosing the world in which you play your present role\ninstead of one in which you play mine. (4)\n\n\nChisholm\u2019s remarks strongly suggest that he takes these\nquestions to indicate that there is something deeply problematic about\nthe notion that the same individual can exist in different worlds with\ndifferent qualitative properties. Once we accept this notion, we seem\nto be on a path that will eventually lead us to the conclusion that\nthere are indefinitely many worlds each of which is qualitatively\nindiscernible from the real world, but differing from it only in the\nidentities of the individuals playing the various roles. Such a\nplurality of worlds seems undetectable and pointless.\n\nIn \u201cParts as Essential to Their Wholes\u201d (1973), Chisholm\npresents a structurally similar argument for a similar point. In this\ncase, however, Chisholm\u2019s target is a doctrine that he calls\n\u2018complete, unbridled mereological inessentialism\u2019. This is\nthe view that nothing has its parts essentially \u2014 anything\nthat\u2019s made of parts could have been made of different\nparts.\n\nChisholm starts his argument by sketching some outlandish examples,\nbut then he turns to a familiar case. He asks us to consider a pair of\ntables, x and y. Each table is made of smaller\nparts. Just as he did in the case of Adam and Noah, Chisholm imagines\na series of small changes. Instead of gradual changes of properties,\nhe here imagines gradual changes of parts. First, he describes a\npossible in world in which x and y have exchanged\none small part. Then he describes further possible worlds in which\nmore small parts are exchanged. At last we reach a possible world in\nwhich x and y have exchanged all their parts:\neverything that is actually a part of x has now become a part\nof y; and everything that is actually a part of y\nhas now become a part of x.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why Chisholm finds this example perplexing.\nFor we have arrived at a world at which the table that is identified\nas x is composed of all and only the parts that in fact\ncompose y; and the table that is identified as y is\ncomposed of all and only the parts that in fact compose x. Is\nthis world in fact distinct from the actual world? What possible basis\nis there for saying that the table composed of the x parts is\ny? Why isn\u2019t that table x? It is partwise\nindiscernible from the actual x.\n\nChisholm concludes this discussion by saying that \u201cthese\nreflections, on the consequences of extreme mereological\ninessentialism, may suggest to us that some version of\nmereological essentialism must be true\u2026\u201d (586). In the\nremaining pages of the paper Chisholm presents a view according to\nwhich extreme mereological essentialism is true \u2014 but only for\nwhat he calls \u201cprimary objects\u201d. Ordinary or\n\u201cvulgar\u201d objects such as tables and ships are not primary\nobjects. Each such vulgar object may be understood to be a gradually\nevolving sequence of primary objects. The vulgar object is constituted\nby different primary objects at different times. Vulgar objects can\ngain and lose parts across times and possible worlds. Mereological\nessentialism is not true for them.\n\nChisholm strongly suggests that he thinks that vulgar objects occupy a\ndecidedly lower rung on the ontological ladder. In a discussion of an\nexample involving a statue and a hunk of metal that temporarily\nconstitutes it, he suggests that we might be content to say that the\nhunk of metal is a primary object and that this hunk of metal\ntemporarily has the property of being statuesque. In the\nstrict and philosophical sense, it would be acceptable to say that\nthere really is no such thing as \u201cthe statue\u201d. Yet another\npossible view would maintain that the statue is merely a mode of the\nhunk of metal. This too would diminish the ontological status of the\nstatue, though it would not banish the statue entirely. This latter\n\u201cmodal\u201d view is explicitly defended in Chisholm\u2019s\n1986 \u201cSelf-Profile\u201d in [RMCp].\n\nChisholm discussed these problems in a number of papers and chapters.\nHe did not always defend precisely the same combination of views, but\ncertain elements seemed to persist. He steadily maintained a\ncommitment to mereological essentialism for ontologically fundamental\nphysical objects; he tried in various ways to account for facts about\npersistence, enumeration, and reidentification of ordinary objects by\nappeal to what he took to be ontologically more fundamental facts\nabout real \u201csubstances\u201d. Chisholm\u2019s work on these\ntopics was remarkably provocative. Some have suggested that David\nLewis\u2019s development of counterpart theory was intended (among\nother things) to provide a metaphysical account of the structure of\npossible worlds that would avoid the strange implications that\nChisholm described.\n",
