    "main_text": "Art as Imaginative Creation\n3. Art as Imaginative Creation\n\nTo conceive art as the craft of emotional stimulation or\narousal\u2014whether for the sake of amusement or magic\u2014is to\nregard the material work of art as the intended means towards a\npreconceived end. The falsity of that conception\u2014assuming that\nart is essentially the expression of emotion\u2014shows that the work\nof art as not an artifact at all (so artworks are not\nartifacts; Collingwood was aware that language sometimes suggests\ntheoretical mistakes). Instead, the artistic process is a specialized\ntype of making that Collingwood calls creation: to create\nsomething is to make it non-technically, but \u2018consciously and\nvoluntarily\u2019 (128), and hence intentionally. The creator\n\u2018need not be acting in order to achieve any ulterior end; he not\nbe following a preconceived plan; and he is certainly not transforming\nanything that can be properly be called a raw material\u2019\n(129).\n\nNow take for example a lecture given on a scientific topic. There are,\nin Collingwood\u2019s view, actually at least two things: The lecture\nas a created thing, and the lecture as a particular sound-event. The\nformer may be complete in advance of, or indeed without ever, being\nuttered or written down: the actual speech-event, as a sequence of\nnoise, enables a suitably equipped listener to reconstruct the created\nthing is his own mind, therefore to grasp its scientific content, but\nis inessential to it. And so it is with works of art. A tune, for\nexample, needn\u2019t be sung, played or written down in order to\nexist. Thus Collingwood:\n\nI have already said that a thing which \u2018exists in a\nperson\u2019s head\u2019 and nowhere else is alternatively called an\nimaginary thing. The actual making of the tune is therefore\nalternatively called the making of an imaginary tune. This is a case\nof creation \u2026 Hence the making a tune is an instance of\nimaginative creation. The same applies to the making of a poem, or a\npicture, or any other work of art. (134)\n\n\nCollingwood is not supposing that every work of art could in point of\nfact exist only people\u2019s minds; of music, for example, he writes\n\u2018[P]erhaps no one can do that [possess himself of the music]\nunless he does hear the noises\u2019 (140; of course there are some\nprima facie counterexamples to this; later Beethoven, for\nexample). The human imagination is typically too weak; in most cases\nwe have to depend on the \u2018bodily\u2019 work of art for sensory\nhelps. But in principle, the \u2018total imaginative\nexperience\u2019 that constitutes the proper work of art must be\nconceived as only contingently related to the bodily work.\n\nWhat precisely is the motivation for this move, the conception of the\nwork of art as imagined or ideal object? Leave aside the special cases\nof music and poetry, which Richard Wollheim notes have the special\nfeature that they can be written down (see Wollheim 1972). Why not\nconceive painting, for example, as the creation of certain painted\nobjects? This would be consistent with the thesis that painting is a\nnot craft. The answer given by Collingwood is clear, but leads to\ntrouble when we consider the question of interpretation. An experience\nof a painting involves a great deal that no one would say is \u2018in\nthe painting\u2019, which is, after all, a nearly flat canvas with\npaint on it. Not only do we see things that are not really present,\nbut for example we have impressions of space and mass, perhaps by\nmeans of what Berenson called \u2018ideated\nsensations\u2019\u2014those which involve imaginary motor or\nkinaesthetic sensations. These phenomena are not literally features of\nthe canvas, but they are in some sense features of the work. So\nCollingwood, in brief, includes within the work of art proper all that\nwould normally be ascribed to the (correct) interpretation\u2014the\n(correct) experience\u2014of the artwork. But there is no reason to\naccept this, any more we should include all the relational\nfacts\u2014sowing, fertilization, watering and so on\u2014that\ncontribute to a growing plant to the plant itself. On contrary, the\nposition makes it impossible for two spectators to disagree on the\ninterpretation of a work. Irrespective of the concern with the privacy\nof the experience, if they attribute different properties to the\nobject\u2014that is, they find different properties in their\nrespective total imaginative experiences\u2014they are simply\nconcerned with different objects, and their verdicts are compatible.\nWe could set the artist\u2019s own experience as a criterion of\nunderstanding the work, but that would make his death significant in\nway that we do not actually recognize, and would run against the grain\nof Collingwood\u2019s antipathy to aesthetic individualism and the\n\u2018cult of genius\u2019, discussed below. As a matter of\nspeculation, Collingwood perhaps thought that aesthetically relevant\nproperties\u2014expressive properties\u2014have to be intrinsic\nproperties of the work of art; in that case, perhaps his conclusion\ndoes follow. But it is much more satisfactory to hold that what we are\narguing over when we disagree over the expressive properties of a work\nof art is the same object.\n",
