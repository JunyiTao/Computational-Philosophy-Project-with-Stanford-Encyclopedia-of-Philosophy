    "main_text": "Skolem: Quantifier Elimination and Decidability\n10. Skolem: Quantifier Elimination and Decidability\n\nSkolem was strongly influenced by Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Algebra der\nLogik, starting with his PhD Thesis. Later he took a particular\ninterest in the quest for an Elimination Theorem in the calculus of\nclasses. In his 1919 paper he established some results for lattices,\nin particular, he showed that one could decide the validity of\nuniversal Horn sentences (i.e., universal sentences with a matrix that\nis a disjunction of negated and unnegated atoms, with at most one\npositive atom) by a procedure that we now recognize to be a polynomial\ntime algorithm. This algorithm was based on finding a least fixed\npoint of a finite partial lattice under production rules derived from\nuniversal Horn sentences. Although this result, which is equivalent to\nthe uniform word problem for lattices, was in the same paper as\nSkolem\u2019s famous contribution to L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s Theorem, it was\nforgotten until a chance rediscovery in the early 1990s. (Whitman\n(1941) gave a different solution to the more limited equational\ndecision problem for lattices; it became widely known as the solution\nto the word problem in lattices.)\n\nSkolem (1920) gave an elegant solution to the Elimination Problem\nposed by Schr\u00f6der for the calculus of classes by showing that if\none added predicates to express \u201chas at least \\(n\\)\nelements\u201d, for each \\(n = 1, 2, \\ldots\\), then there was a\nsimple (but often lengthy) procedure to convert a first-order formula\nabout classes into a quantifier-free formula. In particular this\nshowed that the first-order theory of the calculus of classes was\ndecidable. This quantifier-elimination result was used by Mostowski\n(1952) to analyze first-order properties of direct powers and direct\nsums of single structures, and then by Feferman and Vaught (1959) to\ndo the same for general direct sums and direct products of\nstructures.\n\nThe elimination of quantifiers became a main method in mathematical\nlogic to prove decidability, and proving decidability was stated as\nthe main problem of mathematical logic in Hilbert and Ackermann\n(1928)\u2014this goal was dropped in subsequent editions because of\nthe famous undecidability result of Church and Turing.\n",
