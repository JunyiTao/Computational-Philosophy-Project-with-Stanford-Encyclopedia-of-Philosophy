    "main_text": "Reconstituting the History of Philosophy || The Revelations of Contextualization\n5.3 Questioning \u2018modernity\u2019 itself\n\nLucius Outlaw characterizes modern European philosophers as sharing\na commitment to a \u201cproject of modernity\u201d that aimed to put\nall human activity \u201cunder the aegis of\n\u2018reason\u2019\u201d (1996, 147; see also Kirkland 2018; Yancy\n2020; Dussel 1995, 2013, 2018; McCarthy 2009; Mehta 1999). Despite a\ndiversity of approaches and disagreements, the modern Europeans shared\na distinctive philosophy of history that defined progress as the\nexpansion of freedom and rationality. Social institutions and cultures\ncould then be compared and ranked in regard to this singular metric of\nuniversal development. It was useful for Empire, as Outlaw argues, to\nreframe the wide expanse of alterity among human beings and cultures as\ndevelopmental differences. The possibilities of a true pluralism was\nthen foreclosed by norms of modernity. The unfortunate result still\nwith us is that the impetus to study current social and cultural\ndifferences in thought, or the variety of philosophical writings, is\ndiminished on the grounds that these constitute inessential and\naccidental aspects of the human condition, irrelevant to the\nformulation or discernment of freedom and reason. Eurocentrism in\nphilosophical curricula is then no accident, Outlaw concludes, nor is\nit viewed as a deficiency since the modern European canon is assumed to\nprovide sufficient elaboration and debate over the universal principles\nof freedom and reason.\n\nThus, this project of modernity gave birth to a\n\u201cfalse universalism that blocks the appreciation of racial and\nethnic differences\u2026and contributed to deceptions that masked\nvarious forms of domination that were\nrationalized\u2026\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 150). Critical social theory\nworthy of the name needs to embrace a pluralism of philosophical\nprojects, concepts, and frameworks that have arisen from differently\nsituated thinkers from diverse regions or group experiences who are\naddressing, at least in some cases, dissimilar puzzles and challenges.\nA pluralist approach to philosophical projects can then engage in\ncritical dialogue across these differences. The point of noting real\nphilosophical alterities for Outlaw is not to counsel empty tolerance\nbut to avoid presumptive judgments based on putative universals crafted\nby only one side.\n\nQuestioning European projects of modernity has been productively\ndisruptive of the staid problematics that have dominated numerous\nsub-fields, from political philosophy to aesthetics to epistemology\n(Narayan and Harding 2000; Dotson 2012, 2014; Taylor 2016). Previously,\nthe focal points that dominated these sub-fields, such as skepticism,\nideal forms of justice, the universal nature of aesthetic value, and so\non, came exclusively from modern European or ancient Greek\nphilosophers. The recent critical work is challenging the hegemony of\nthe traditional canon in setting out the agenda for philosophy. To be\nsure, previous movements in philosophy have also made progress in\nexpanding the problematics, such as pragmatism, post-structuralism,\nsocial epistemology, feminist philosophy, and others. New questions\nhave made it to the table, and old questions have had new\nformulations.\n\nParticularly important has been the transformation of political\nproblematics, reaching well beyond the debates over liberalism,\nconservatism, and Marxism (McGary 1999; Cohen 1999, Gooding-Williams\n2009; Shelby 2018; Lugones 2003; Corlett 2003 and 2010; Darby and Rury\n2018; Hanchard 2018). The move from ideal to non-ideal approaches has\nplayed a particularly productive role in opening up the field of\npolitical philosophy to engage with racial injustice and inequality\n(Mills 2005). Non-ideal approaches have cast new light on ideal\nconceptions of normative, optimally functional behavior. Shelby,\nGooding-Williams, and Cathy Cohen have all, in different ways, turned\nto the project of investigating \u201chow [so-called] deviant\npractices can be transformed into political challenges to the power\nthat the state exercises over the ghetto poor through the promotion and\nenforcement of [illegitimate] norms\u201d (Gooding-Williams 2009,\n251). Gooding-Williams indicts Du Bois\u2019s adoption of mainstream\nnorms of respectability in his account of the Philadelphia ghettos and\nsuggests that we look instead to Frederick Douglas as the better\npolitical philosopher for emancipation (see also James 1997). The\nproject of civilizing Black people was a strategy that would only\nensure their subjection. Douglas envisioned a subaltern black\ncounterpublic that might have its own distinct ideas about the optimal\nnorms of communal life and what constituted civilized behavior (see\nDawson 2011).\n\nThese new problematics in political philosophy often draw from\nneglected historical sources, including Douglass and Du Bois as well as\nMartin Delaney, Anna Julia Cooper, Simon Bolivar, Kwame Nkrumah,\nAmilcar Cabral, Walter Rodney, Haya de la Torre, Jose Mart\u00ed,\nAim\u00e9 and Suzanne Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, and many others.\nRelated to these new non-European sources has been an altered map of\nthe European sources of greatest interest, to include more of\nMontaigne, Las Casas, Condorcet, Rousseau, Gramsci, Marcuse, and\nothers.\n\nTo be sure, many Critical Philosophers of Race decline to follow\nOutlaw in believing that there is a \u2018black counterpublic\u2019\nthat represents a racially cohesive formation. To the extent there is\ncohesion, it is based more on opposition to white supremacy, some\nargue, than an expression of shared sensibilities and orientations. And\nso the debate ensues. As this entry has shown, strong differences\nabound among CPR scholars over the history of Negritude and\nmetissage, the implications of intersectionality, the meaning\nand future of racial concepts, and the weighty role of capitalism as a\ncausal factor. A newly interpreted, reorganized and expanded history of\nphilosophy is reformulating our central questions in many sub-fields,\ninvigorating new lines of argumentation, more relevant for current\nchallenges.\n",
