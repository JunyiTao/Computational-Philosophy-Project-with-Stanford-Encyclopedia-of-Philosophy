    "main_text": "The Open Question Argument and its Aftermath: Moore\u2019s Influence on Russell\n1. The Open Question Argument and its Aftermath: Moore\u2019s Influence on Russell\n\nRussell\u2019s destiny as an ethical thinker was dominated by one\nbook\u2014G.E. Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica (1903). Before 1903,\nRussell devoted some of the energy that he could spare from German\nSocial Democracy, the foundations of mathematics and the philosophy of\nLeibniz to working out a meta-ethic of his own. After 1903, he became\nan enthusiastic but critical convert to the doctrines of Principia\nEthica (though there is some evidence that the conversion process\nmay have begun as early as 1897). Moore is famous for the claim, which\nhe professes to prove by means of what has come to be known as the\nOpen Question Argument, that there is a \u201cnon-natural\u201d\nproperty of goodness, not identical with or reducible to any\nother property or assemblage of properties, and that what we ought to\ndo is to maximize the good and minimize the bad. Russell subscribed to\nthis thesis\u2014with certain important reservations\u2014until\n1913. Thereafter he continued to believe that if judgments about\ngood and bad are to be objectively true, non-natural properties\nof goodness and badness are required to make them true. It is just\nthat he ceased to believe that there are any such properties. Does\nthis mean that judgments about good and evil are all false?\nNot necessarily (though Russell did subscribe to that view for a brief\nperiod during 1922). An alternative theory is that moral judgments are\nneither true nor false, since their role is not to\nstate facts or to describe the way the world is, but to express\nemotions, desires or even commands. This (despite some waverings) was\nRussell\u2019s dominant view for the rest of his life, though it took him\ntwenty-two years to develop a well worked-out version of the theory.\nHe tended to call it subjectivism or \u201cthe subjectivity of moral\nvalues\u201d though it is nowadays known as non-cognitivism,\nexpressivism or emotivism. He came to think that, despite their\nindicative appearance, moral judgments\u2014at least judgments about\nwhat is good or bad in itself\u2014are really in the optative mood.\n(A sentence is in the optative mood if it expresses a wish or a\ndesire.) What \u201cX is good\u201d means is \u201cWould\nthat everyone desired X!\u201d. It therefore expresses, but\ndoes not describe, the speaker\u2019s state of mind, specifically his or\nher desires, and as such can be neither truth nor false, anymore than\n\u201cOh to be in England now that April\u2019s here!\u201d. If I say\n\u201cOh to be in England now that April\u2019s here!\u201d, you can\ninfer that I desire to be in England now that April\u2019s here (since\nabsent an intention to mislead, it is not the sort of thing I would\nsay unless I desired to be in England and thought\nthat April was here). But I am not stating that I desire to\nbe in England, since I am not stating anything at all (except perhaps\nthat April is here). (See RoE: 131\u2013144/Religion and\nScience: ch. 9.) Although this was Russell\u2019s dominant view from\n1913 until his death, he did not care for it very much.\n\n\nI cannot see how to refute the arguments for the subjectivity of\nethical values, but I find myself incapable of believing that all that\nis wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don\u2019t like it. (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 310\u201311)\n\n\nIt is not entirely clear what Russell took these overwhelming\narguments to be. But one of them seems to have proceeded from a\nMoorean premise. Russell took Moore to have refuted\nnaturalism, the view that although there are moral truths,\nnothing metaphysically out of the ordinary is required to\nmake them true. Conversely Russell took Moore to have proved\nthat if there were to be moral truths about which things were\ngood or bad as ends rather than means, the truths in question would\nrequire spooky non-natural properties of goodness, badness\netc\u2014quite unlike the \u201cnatural\u201d properties posited by\nscience and commonsense\u2014to make them true. In the\nsupposed absence of such properties, he was driven to the conclusion\nthat moral judgments (at least judgments about goodness and badness)\nwere either all false or neither true nor\nfalse. Thus Russell remained a renegade Moorean even after he had\nceased to believe in the Moorean good. But if Moore was a decisive\ninfluence on Russell, it seems that Russell was an important influence\non Moore. For Moore may have been driven to invent his most famous\nargument for a non-natural property of goodness\u2014the\nOpen Question Argument\u2014by the need to deal with a naturalistic\ntheory of Russell\u2019s.\n",
