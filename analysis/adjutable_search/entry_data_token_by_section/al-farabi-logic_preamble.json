Several of\nhis major writings are lost in whole or part. But many of his books\nexplaining Aristotle\u2019s Organon (the collection of\nAristotle\u2019s writings on logic and related subjects) have\nsurvived, and the number of them available in Western translations is\nincreasing steadily. For general information on\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b see the entry on\n Al-Farabi.\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b studies the various roles of language in\nhuman life and society. He emphasises the use of language to convey\ninformation, to ask questions and resolve disagreements, and to\ndescribe distinctions and classifications. He believes that language\nin some sense copies meanings, and that mismatches between language\nand meanings need to be avoided. He presents Aristotle\u2019s logic\nas a collection of methods for exercising persuasion, regulating\ndebate, discovering truth and achieving certainty. He also explores\nits applications in poetry. Along the way he makes many acute\nobservations on issues ranging from the sources of metaphysical\nquestions to the temporal structure of events and the relationship\nbetween poetry and music.\n",
