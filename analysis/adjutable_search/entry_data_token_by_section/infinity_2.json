    "main_text": "Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview || The method of exhaustion\n2.1 The method of exhaustion\n\nWe have already mentioned that the potential infinite occurs in Greek\nmathematics from the outset, most obviously in the natural number\nseries and in the geometrical operations of addition and division of\nsegments and other geometrical magnitudes. The Greek mathematicians,\nstarting with Eudoxus, developed a technique for measuring plane and\nsolid figures that avoided recourse to the infinite even where an\ninfinite \u201climit\u201d process would seem to be forced by the\nsituation. This technique, known today as the method of\nexhaustion (the expression was coined in the 17th century by\nGregory of Saint Vincent), is found in Euclid\u2019s\nElements, book XII, and then in some of the most spectacular\nresults by Archimedes (3rd century BCE). The idea is to replace an\ninfinite approximation by a double reductio ad absurdum. That means\nthat one shows the equality in area or volume of two figures, say a\ncircle \\(C\\) and an associated triangle \\(T\\), by noting that \\(C \\lt\nT, C \\gt T\\) or \\(C = T\\) and then showing that the assumptions \\(C\n\\lt T\\) and \\(C \\gt T\\) both lead to a contradiction. (Here\n\u2018\\(C\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(T\\)\u2019 refer with systematic\nambiguity to the figures and their areas/volumes.) Further discussion\ncan be found in the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles.\n\nGreek mathematics generally avoids any recourse to the actual\ninfinite, and scholars have spoken of a \u201chorror of\ninfinity\u201d typical of Greek mathematics. This is in general\ncorrect with respect to the way mathematical results are presented in\ntheir final and public presentation. However, one should keep in mind\nthat no such \u201chorror of infinity\u201d is to be found when one\nlooks at the heuristic strategies pursued by Greek mathematicians. In\nthe case of Archimedes, this was made evident by the fortunate\nrediscovery of his method (found in 1906; see Netz and Noel 2007)\nwhere we see him using infinitary and mechanical considerations as\ntools he exploited for the discovery of geometrical theorems (see\nKnorr 1982, 1986 and Jullien 2015). For instance, in his description\nof the method for finding the proportion between the area of a\nparabolic segment and that of a related triangle, Archimedes thinks of\ngeometric figures (the parabolic segment and the related triangle, in\nthis case) as composed of infinitely many one-dimensional segments and\nthen exploits the law of the lever to gain the determination of the\nrelation between the areas in question. In a portion of the text of\nthe method that has only recently become available (a section of\nproposition XIV, see Netz and Noel 2007), Archimedes explicitly\noperates with infinite collections.\n",
