    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\nGrosseteste\u2019s large and rich body of writings includes scientific\nworks, commentaries on and translations of Aristotle\u2019s writings and\nworks of Greek theology, commentaries on books of the Bible, works in\nphilosophy and speculative and pastoral theology, collections of\nsermons and letters, and a large collection of short theological\nwritings known as the Dicta. Grosseteste also composed some\nAnglo-Norman poetry.  His works of philosophical interest may be\nclassified, in modern terms, as follows: \n\nCommentaries on Aristotle. Many years before Grosseteste\ncomposed his translations of the Nicomachean Ethics and\nDe caelo, he had been deeply engaged in the study of\nAristotle\u2019s views on scientific knowledge and natural philosophy, and\nhad composed a commentary on the Posterior Analytics and\ncommenced and made substantial progress on a commentary on the\nPhysics. These are the earliest surviving commentaries on\nthese works known to have been composed in the Latin West.  Extant\nmanuscripts also contain and attribute to Grosseteste a paraphrase of\nthe Prior Analytics, which may well be genuine, as well as a\ncommentary on the  Sophistici Elenchi and another commentary\non the Physics, both of which appear to be inauthentic. The\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics appears to have been\nwritten in the 1220s and is an important source for Grosseteste\u2019s\nepistemological views. The authentic commentary on the \nPhysics appears to have been assembled by a later editor or\neditors from notes Grosseteste had written in his copy of the\nPhysics as the basis of a commentary along the lines of the\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics.  Though incomplete,\nthese notes comprise a substantial and coherent work, the bulk of\nwhich was also probably written in the 1220s, though what appear to be\nsome additions to the body of the work in which Averroes\u2019s long commentary on the Physics is\nused probably date from the 1230s (see Lewis 2003).  This work is an\nimportant source for Grosseteste\u2019s views on numerous topics in natural\nphilosophy.\nPhilosophical works.  Grosseteste composed a number of short\nphilosophical works. On Light (De luce) his minor\nmasterpiece, develops his so-called light metaphysics; it appears to\nbe the object of cross-references in his commentaries on Aristotle and\nthus written prior to them. Closely related to On Light is a\nshort work On Bodily Movement and Light (De motu\ncorporali et luce). Other short philosophical works are On\nPotency and Act (De potentia et actu), On the Halt\nof Causes (De statu causarum), On the Subsistence of\na Thing (De subsistentia rei), and On the Truth of\nthe Proposition (De veritate propositionis).  On the\nFinitude of Movement and Time (De finitate motus et\ntemporis) (a longer version of which is appended to the\ncommentary on the Physics) attacks Aristotle\u2019s arguments for\nthe infinitude of past time and movement; it was probably written in the\n1230s\nPhilosophical-theological works. The most important and\nsubstantial of these works is On Free Decision (De libero\narbitrio), a relatively long work in two versions that is\nconcerned with arguments against the existence of free decision\n(liberum arbitrium)\u2014especially those based on God\u2019s\nforeknowledge\u2014and with the nature of free decision itself. Closely\nrelated are the shorter works On Truth (De veritate)\nand On God\u2019s Knowledge (De scientia Dei). These\nworks all appear to date from after ca. 1225, and more probably from the late 1220s or\nbeginning of the 1230s. A short work, On the Order of the\nEmanation of Caused Things from God (De ordine emamandi\ncausatorum a Deo), attacks the argument that an eternal being can\nonly create eternal creatures. A long letter to Adam Rufus (= Adam of Exeter), the first\nin Grosseteste\u2019s letter collection, explains how God is form of all\nthings and investigates the relation of body and soul and the location\nof angels. In the manuscripts this letter is often divided into two\ndistinct works, On the Unique Form of all Things (De\nunica forma omnium) and On the Intelligences (De\nintelligentiis).\nScientific works.  Grosseteste\u2019s scientific writings include\nwhat appear to be his earliest works, which possibly were written\nduring the first two decades of the thirteenth century: On the Liberal\nArts (De artibus liberalibus), On the Generation of\nSounds (De generatione sonorum), and On the\nSphere (De sphaera), an outline of astronomy.  Later in the\nthirteenth century, Grosseteste wrote a number of short\nscientific works including On Comets (De cometis), On Lines, Angles and Figures (De\nlineis, angulis et figuris), On the Nature of Places\n(De natura locorum), On the Rainbow (De\niride), On Color, (De colore), On Local\nDifferences (De diferentiis localibus), and On the Movement of the Supercelestial Bodies (De motu supercaelestium). (For an outline of the\ncontent of many of these works see Dales 1961 and Panti 2001. The works On the Heat of the Sun (De calore solis), On the Tides (De fluxu et refluxu maris), On the Generation of the Stars (De generatione stellarum), and On the Impressions of the Air (De impressionibus aeris), first edited in Baur 1912, are probably inauthentic. In the most recent discussion of the dating of Grosseteste\u2019s scientific works, Panti 2013 argues that the first two of these works were probably written by Adam of Exeter, the addressee of Grosseteste\u2019s first letter.).\nTheological works containing some material of philosophical\ninterest. Though not as expressly philosophical as the works\nnoted above, On the Cessation of the Ceremonial Laws (De\ncessatione legalium), On the Ten Commandments (De\ndecem mandatis) and the Hexa\u00e6meron, all\nsubstantial works written in the 1230s, contain some material of\ninterest to the philosopher. On the Cessation of the Ceremonial\nLaws argues that the Incarnation would have occurred even without\nthe fall, and touches on the nature of human happiness and natural\nlaw. On the Ten Commandents provides some insight into\nGrosseteste\u2019s thinking about ethics, while the \nHexa\u00e6meron, his theological masterpiece, considers in\ndetail the problem of the eternity of the world. Material of\nphilosophical interest is also to be found in the Dicta, some\nof Grosseteste\u2019s later sermons (notably the sermon Ecclesia sancta\ncelebrat where he outlines an account of human nature) and his\ncommentaries on the Pseudo-Dionysius.\n\n In the present article the focus is on Grosseteste\u2019s thought in\nworks from the first three categories.\n",
