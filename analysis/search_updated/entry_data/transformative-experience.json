    "preamble": "\n\nTransformative experiences are experiences that radically change the\nexperiencer in both an epistemic and personal way (see Paul 2014).\nWhen a person transforms epistemically, they gain knowledge\nof \u201cwhat the experience is like\u201d that they could not have\nhad without the experience. For instance, falling in love for the\nfirst time\u2014be it with a romantic partner, child, friend, or\npet\u2014is the only way to truly know what it\u2019s like to fall\nin love and allows one to better understand human bonds and\nrelationships. A person might also transform personally, or\nsuch that key agential features\u2014like their core preferences,\nlife goals, and way they maneuver through the world\u2014change. For\ninstance, falling in love has a tendency to radically reshape the\npeople and activities one prefers, change one\u2019s major future\nplans, and alter the way one moves through the world. While these\npersonal transformations might be caused epistemic ones, they also\njust could arise alongside the epistemic transformation as a result of\nthe new experience. Experiences like falling in love that transform\npeople both epistemically and personally are transformative\nexperiences.\n\nThough the concept of transformative experience sketched above comes\nfrom Paul (2014), elements of her account can be traced back to\nearlier work. For instance, antecedents include Lewis\u2019s (1988\n[1990]) discussion of what experience teaches with respect to the\nphenomenal character of the experience, as well as\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s (2006) work that highlights how making big\ndecisions isn\u2019t subject to rationality precisely because these\ndecisions tend to involve personal transformation. However,\nPaul\u2019s work has brought a resurgence of attention to the topic.\nTransformative experiences give us a way to understand the richness of\nour experiences, and also raise important questions in diverse areas\nof philosophy. Thus, this topic permeates both our lives and\nphilosophical conversations. This entry discusses the different\ncontexts in which transformative experiences may arise and the wide\nset of philosophical questions that surround transformative\nexperience.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Varieties of Transformative Experience\n\nTransformative experiences permeate our everyday lives\u2014at least\nif we\u2019re to believe the growing literature that has sprung up\naround this topic. To fully appreciate its significance, this section\noffers a brief, non-exhaustive sampling of various purported cases of\ntransformative experience. It\u2019s up to the reader to determine\nwhether these examples qualify as transformative in the sense of the\nstrict definition offered above. But perhaps more important than\nwhether each of these qualifies, is the fact that considering whether\nthey do raises important issues that help us better understand the\nmyriad dimensions of our own lives.\n1.1 Parenthood\n\nParenthood is Paul\u2019s paradigm case of transformation (2014,\n2015a). Prior to having a child, one cannot anticipate what it will be\nlike to become a parent. Further, having a child changes the parent in\na personally transformative way. Core preferences and life goals are\noften reshaped around a new priority: the child. The way the new\nparent sees the world and perceives terror and joy shifts. Zadie Smith\n(2013 [2018]) eloquently puts the previously unknown complexity of\nhaving a child thusly:\n\n\nOccasionally the child, too, is a pleasure, though mostly she is a\njoy, which means in fact she gives us not much pleasure at all but\nrather that strange admixture of terror, pain, and delight that I have\ncome to recognize as joy and now must find some way to live with\ndaily. This is a new problem. (Smith 2013 [2018, 331])\n\n\nAnd of course, the transformation associated with parenthood is not\nrestricted to one\u2019s first biological child. It extends to\nadopted children, and even can extend beyond humans to feline, canine,\nand other beings who depend on us and with whom we can bond.\n1.2 Sense Modality and Sensory Experiences\n\nChildren who grow up in the United States rather than Australia\ngenerally don\u2019t experience the distinctive taste of vegemite.\nPeople born with color blindness don\u2019t see certain colors.\nTasting vegemite and seeing color for the first time are radically new\nsensory experiences with distinctive phenomenal characters, and\nprobably only involve epistemic transformation. Some people experience\neven more radical changes when they gain or lose a sense modality.\nSomeone who has always been sighted or hearing cannot appreciate what\nit is like to be blind or deaf. Likewise, people who have always been\nblind or deaf cannot appreciate what it is like to be sighted or\nhearing. In addition to not knowing what gaining or losing a sense\nmodality might be like, one cannot anticipate how that gain or loss\nmight personally change them and the way they navigate the world. The\nfact that most of society is structured to accommodate sighted and\nhearing people increases the difference between a change in sense\nmodality. And of course, appreciating the transformative nature of\ngaining a sense modality carries practical implications since many\npeople are in a position to decide for themselves or others whether to\ngain a sense modality via surgical interventions.\n1.3 Love and Relationships\n\nLove has the power to transform us little by little. In fact, this\nincremental change is one of the fascinating features of love when put\nin the context of transformative experience (see Paul 2014). Smiling\nat a new acquaintance is not transformative, nor is grabbing coffee\nwith them. Once you\u2019ve had coffee, eating dinner together is not\ntransformative either. On and on each step goes. Yet, by the end of\nthings, when you look back at a relationship that\u2019s decades\nlong, you realize that you could not have imagined what it would be\nlike to bond with another person in such an intimate way. The way you\napproached life, the preferences and life projects you developed, and\nthe way love\u2019s rose-tinted glasses filtered the way you see the\nworld have radically changed you. On the flip side, ending this sort\nof relationship is also wildly transformative, especially if\nyou\u2019ve formed a sense of identity that revolves around your\nbeloved. Furthermore, because it\u2019s not clear that reason ever\nrequires that you love someone in a romantic way, it\u2019s difficult\nto explain how choosing love or rejecting it could be done rationally.\nThus, opening oneself up to love or boldly ending it invites\ntransformation and raises questions about whether doing so could ever\nbe defended rationally.\n1.4 Social Identity\n\nAll of us inhabit a place in society that\u2019s determined in part\nby race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, religion, country of\norigin, education, socioeconomic status, political affiliation, and\nmuch more. Due to contingent but very real injustices, our place in\nsociety shapes our experiences. Sometimes, it\u2019s possible to\nchange our place in society (McKinnon 2015 discusses gender\ntransitions and Barnes 2015 offers the fictional case of Pip from\nGreat Expectations), and when we do so, that change is\ntransformative. But the way in which these social changes are\ntransformative underlines some troubling features these social divides\nhave created. First, just as, for instance, Pip, cannot explain to his\npast self what social elevation is like, it is generally extremely\ndifficult for people in one social group to communicate what it is\nlike to be a member of that group to someone who is outside of it.\nThis partially explains the phenomenon of situated knowledge and also\ngives rise to the possibility of testimonial epistemic injustice (see,\ne.g., Fricker 2007). Hermeneutical issues also arise. People\u2019s\nself-conceptions aren\u2019t developed in a vacuum, and shared norms\nand concepts contribute to the way in which one\u2019s\nself-conception can develop, thus influencing the ways in which one\ncan transform. For instance, \u201cbrave inspiration\u201d is a\nreadily available self-conception for disabled people while\n\u201cthriving person in an unconventional body\u201d is\nnot\u2014and this is an unjust state of affairs (Barnes 2015). Social\nidentities and structures contribute an ethically rich dimension to\nthe conversation on transformative experience.\n1.5 Tragedy\n\nUnfortunately, life also contains tragedies. The trauma of war leaves\nveterans and civilians physically and emotionally scarred in ways that\ncan change their outlook on life forever. We aren\u2019t morally\nperfect, and often fail in extremely regrettable ways. To top it all\noff, people die, sometimes after extended periods of pain and\nsuffering. Experiences of negative valence are often epistemically\nsurprising. There\u2019s no way to predict what the death of a close\nloved one will feel like, even if the death is anticipated.\nLife\u2019s tragedies also have the capacity to change who we are.\nSometimes, this change can happen for the better. Cashman and Cushman\n(2020) suggest that although we don\u2019t want to intentionally\nmorally fail, moral failure can often teach incredibly valuable\nlessons and change how we act for the better. When it comes to death,\ndying creates a chasm of understanding between those who are dying and\nthose who are not. Chung (2017\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n a philosopher who wrote about his impending death, tells of the chasm\nthat death opens up between those who are dying and those who are not.\nTruly acknowledging that one is dying changes your priorities and the\nway you experience the world in a way that can\u2019t be explained to\nsomeone who isn\u2019t dying. The same holds for someone forced to\nwitness their beloved slowly fade away. Thompson (2020) offers an\ninsightful meta-point, arguing that dying is an \u201cultimate\u201d\ntransformation because it forces us to adopt a perspective of our life\nas a whole that allows us to reconsider which of our prior experiences\ntruly were transformative.\n1.6 Ideology\n\nOur beliefs shape who we are, and changes to our core beliefs have the\npotential to transform us. For instance, De Cruz (2018) and Chan\n(2016, 2019) argue that religious conversions are transformative. The\nmission statements of universities appear to acknowledge and strive\nfor transformation among students (Paul & Quiggin 2020).\nSchwenkler (2020) and Stump (2020) both investigate the nuances of\nopening oneself up to ideological conversion in light of the potential\nfor doxastic and philosophical transformation, respectively.\nCrucially, when ideological difference are too great, people lose the\nability to adopt the perspective of others. This applies both\nintrapersonally, such as when we look back at our past selves and\nmarvel at how we believed in Santa Claus, and interpersonally, which\nleads to the sort of breakdown we see in hyper-polarized political\ncontexts. Speaking of politics, holding office or participating in\npolitics in some deep way might also be transformative, both because\nthey involve encountering people with different perspectives and also\nbecause they require representing them in a meaningful way (see Allen\n2017). It\u2019s tempting to think that changes in belief are merely\nepistemically transformative since they clearly change our epistemic\nstates. But in the New Testament (Acts 9), Saul\u2019s conversion on\nthe road to Damascus into the Apostle Paul isn\u2019t just a change\nin beliefs, it\u2019s a deeper change that completely alters the way\nhe lives his life. The scales falling off his eyes does not merely\nsignify seeing the truth; it also represents a change to who he\nis.\n1.7 Art and Fiction\n\nPaul (2014) opens Transformative Experience with thought\nexperiment about transforming into glamorous, slightly murderous,\ncreatures of the night: vampires. Obviously, none of us actually face\nthis choice. However, rhetorically, thinking about turning into a\nfictional creature helps motivate the idea that doing so would be both\nepistemically and personally transformative. After all, who can say\nfor sure what becoming a vampire would really be like or how it would\nchange a person? Furthermore, this case reveals something further\nabout the connection between fiction, art, and transformative\nexperience. It could be that art is transformative\u2014or at least\nquasi-transformative\u2014because it helps us understand things that\nwe have not (or cannot) experience (Aumann 2022). Furthermore, art and\nfiction might be transformative from the perspective of the creator as\nwell as the audience. For instance, the expression of oneself through\nart may be a transformative experience (Riggle 2020). Finally, art\nclearly involves our imaginations, and imagination may provide a way\nto gain knowledge about what a transformative is like prior to\nexperiencing it. (More on this in\n \u00a72.)\n2. Epistemology: Can We Know What It\u2019s Like?\n\nEpistemically transformative experiences are experiences where one\ncannot know what they are like before having them. In the paradigm\ncase of parenthood, the experience of becoming a parent for the first\ntime has \u201can epistemically unique phenomenal character\u201d\n(Paul 2015a, 157). One cannot know what these are experiences are like\nprior to having them.\n\nPrior work, such as Jackson (1986), provides support for this\nepistemic claim. Jackson\u2019s \u201cWhat Mary Didn\u2019t\nKnow\u201d invites us to engage in a thought experiment about Mary, a\nperson who has lived in a black and white room her entire life. Prior\nto encountering color, can Mary know what it is like to see the color\nred? Does it matter whether Mary is a color scientist who has studied\nthe physics of color and read extensive testimonies about what the\ncolor red is like? Jackson\u2019s objective\u2014to show that\nphysicalism is false because it cannot give us knowledge of\nqualia\u2014applies to transformative experience as well. In general,\nexperiential, or \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d, knowledge cannot\nbe obtained prior to experience. Thus, what transformative experiences\nare like cannot be known without having the relevant experience.\n\nMany philosophers reject the claim that one cannot know what\ntransformative experiences are like prior to having them. These\nrejections tend to center upon one of two strategies. First, one might\nturn to paradigm cases such parenthood and offer reasons to believe\nthat one can in fact know quite a lot about what it\u2019s like to be\na parent prior to becoming one. For instance, Harman (2015) argues\nthat caring for a significantly younger sibling in a quasi-paternal\nway or witnessing a close friend or family member become a parent\nprovides at least some evidence regarding what becoming a\nparent is like. Krishnamurthy (2015, 180) offers a similar suggestion,\narguing that \u201cwe can on the basis of experiences of similar\ntypes know what it is like to have a child\u201d. For instance,\nbabysitting or raising a cat shares common elements with parenting.\nKnowing what these elements are like allows one to know something\nabout what being a parent is like.\n\nSharadin (2015) offers a variation of this type of strategy that\nfocuses on non-phenomenal elements of parenthood. For instance,\nbecoming a parent typically involves things like financial and sleep\ndeprivation, and we can know that becoming a parent typically\ninvolves these things. Plausibly, there is a supervenience relation\nbetween these non-phenomenal elements and an agent\u2019s phenomenal\nexperience of them. Further, many people, such as philosophy graduate\nstudents, are intimately familiar with the phenomenal experience of\nfinancial and sleep deprivation. By building upon the non-phenomenal\nelements that parenthood shares with other experiences a person has\nhad, that person can develop an idea of what parenthood is like prior\nto actually experiencing parenthood.\n\nSome empirical research work focusing on how people model uncertainty\nsuggests that people do in fact attempt to use this first strategy of\nbuilding on what one knows to figure out what one does not know.\nZimmerman and Ullman (2020, 73) model epistemic uncertainty and\npurportedly demonstrate that \u201cpeople can make informed decisions\nabout trying unfamiliar things\u201d. For instance, suppose that\nsomeone encounters an unfamiliar yellow grape. Though they\nwouldn\u2019t know what the yellow grape is like, they might appeal\nto their knowledge of what green and red grapes are like to form a\njudgment about what the yellow grape might be like. At the very least,\nit seems like they are justified in believing that the yellow grape\nwill not wildly diverge from their other grape experiences. Based on\nthis information, they can rationally choose to try the yellow grape.\nEven if they are completely unfamiliar with grapes, they might use\ntheir knowledge of other fruits to form an informed decision. In\ngeneral, novel experiences fall into a taxonomy of the types of\nexperiences one might have, and agents can use the next closest\nexperiences to project what the novel one might be like.\n\nEven if this strategy is successful, it\u2019s unclear that it shows\nthat we can know what transformative experiences are like prior to\nhaving them. Recall that transformative experiences are supposed to\nhave \u201cunique phenomenal character\u201d (Paul 2015a, 157). If one\nknows enough about what the experience is like, then it\u2019s not in\nfact transformative. For instance, Paul (2015b) responds to\nHarman\u2019s case by suggesting that through having similar enough\nexperiences, Harman might in fact have known what becoming a parent is\nlike. Thus, becoming a parent for the first time would not have been\ntransformative because the relevant transformative experience already\noccurred earlier. Whether a type of experience is transformative may\nbe agent-relative. Furthermore, while this strategy is promising, some\ncases may still elude it. For instance, when it comes to gaining or\nlosing a sense modality, it really does seem that the pre-transformed\nperson cannot have any relevantly similar experiences.\n\nThe second strategy does not deny that we often don\u2019t know what\ntransformative experiences are like. Rather, it locates our\nexperiential ignorance in a lack of imagination rather than an in\nprinciple difference in types of knowledge (i.e., propositional and\nexperiential knowledge). Kind (2020), for instance, argues that the\ndifference between projecting what transformative and\nnon-transformative experiences amounts to a difference of degree\nrather than kind. Plausibly, it\u2019s possible to imagine what\nit\u2019s like to babysit for the first time. Further, imagining what\nit\u2019s like to be a first-time babysitter might be easier than\nimagining what it\u2019s like to become first-time parent. For\nsomeone with a sufficiently good imagination\u2014and our imaginative\nabilities do also come in degrees\u2014one can gradually scale up\nfrom the babysitting experience to the experience of becoming a\nparent. It may even be that we can augment our imaginations through\naids such as art and thus approximate what foreign experiences are\nlike (see Aumann 2022). The effectiveness of artistic aids as well as\nthe understanding gained from them also plausibly admit of degrees.\nThus, the imagination strategy can explain why it\u2019s easier to\nfigure out what some experiences are like than others, and why this\ncan vary from individual to individual. Since paradigm transformative\nexperiences tend to be among the most difficult to imagine, positing\ndistinct \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge is tempting.\nHowever, the difficulty in imagining what paradigm transformative\nexperiences are like merely generates the appearance of a\ndistinct kind of knowledge. The upshot is that in principle, we can\nknow what a transformative experience is like prior to experiencing\nit.\n\nArpaly (2020) offers a wrinkle on the imagination strategy, blaming\nour \u201ccrappy\u201d imaginations for our inability to project\nwhat transformative experiences are like. Sometimes, what an\nexperience is like is opaque because the \u201cdevilish\ndetails\u201d of the experience simply haven\u2019t occurred to us.\nFor example, most people have not considered that if a giraffe were to\ndrink coffee, the coffee would cold by the time it reaches the\ngiraffe\u2019s stomach. Other times, we overestimate our ability to\nimagine things, and our overconfidence prevents us from accepting\ntestimony or other evidence that would be illuminating. These cases\ncan be tragic, such as when a depressed person\u2019s family\ndoesn\u2019t believe their reports of depression. The failure to\ncorrectly imagine what things would be like thus causes it to\nappear as if our lack of experience is the problem, since\nexperience would quickly correct this misimpression. Crucially, there\nis nothing special about the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\nquality of these experiences. Though we are ignorant, we are not in\nprinciple ignorant and could theoretically figure out what the\ntransformative experience would be like.\n\nLike the first strategy, this second one is most vulnerable when it\ncomes to extreme transformations in experience such as gaining or\nlosing a sense modality. One might also wonder whether the second\nstrategy significantly undermines the core epistemic claim: that one\ncannot know what transformative experiences are like prior to having\nthem. Even if there is no in principle difference propositional and\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge, it does seem like\nimagination-based responses do acknowledge that some experiences elude\nour imaginative abilities.\n\nFinally, Moss (2018) offers an interestingly different defense of the\nclaim that we cannot know what a transformative experience is like\nprior to having it. Moss argues that we often have\n\u201cprobabilistic knowledge\u201d. For instance, suppose that 50%\nof the people who experience childbirth report that the experience is\nmiraculous. Based on that, it seems reasonable to conclude that there\nis a 50% chance that experiencing childbirth is miraculous. While an\nindividual can\u2019t know that the experience will be miraculous for\nthem, it does seem that they can know that there\u2019s a 50% chance\nthat the experience will be miraculous for them. But crucially, before\none knows that probabilistic claim, one must know that they\naren\u2019t exceptional. For instance, suppose it turns out that of\nthe people who decline epidurals, only 10% of them report that the\nchildbirth experience is miraculous. If one is going to decline an\nepidural, then they do not know that there\u2019s a 50% chance the\nexperience will be miraculous since they are part of a\ngroup\u2014what Moss (2018, 173) calls \u201can alternative reference\nclass\u201d\u2014for whom the probability does not apply.\nFurthermore, those who can\u2019t rule out that they are in the\nalternative reference class (in this case, perhaps those who are\nunsure of whether they will have an epidural) also lack probabilistic\nknowledge. Plausibly in the case of parenthood and other\ntransformative experiences, probabilistic claims can be formed based\non testimony gathered from those who have had the experience. However,\nit could be that among those giving the testimony, there is\nsignificant variance that\u2019s based on whether individuals belong\nto an alternative reference class. Given the nature of transformative\nexperience, it may be unobvious whether a particular individual has a\ntrait that places them into an alternative reference class. Thus, even\nif there\u2019s ample data regarding how likely it is to have a\nparticular parenting experience, that won\u2019t result in\nprobabilistic knowledge of what it\u2019s like to be a parent. This\ndefense also works even if it turns out that there isn\u2019t a\ndistinctive \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge and our\nimaginations can sometimes help us understand what foreign experiences\nare like.\n3. Metaphysics: Can I Become Someone New?\n\nPersonally transformative experiences are ones that change who an\nagent is. Certainly, there are epistemic elements associated with\npersonal transformation: agents may not know how an\nexperience will personally transform them and they won\u2019t know\nwhat it\u2019s like to be transformed. There might also be\nde se knowledge, or self-locating knowledge of the kind that\noccurs when one knows who or where one is within a world (see Lewis\n1979). Significantly for the context of transformative experience,\nde se knowledge can apply to a temporal part of a person, so\nit\u2019s possible that someone who undergoes a transformative\nexperience will \u201clocate\u201d themselves as being the person\nwho results from the transformation, while their earlier self would\nhave lacked this de se knowledge since they may not have\ntaken the future, radically transformed person to be themselves. In\nany case, many of the considerations in the previous section apply to\nthese epistemic elements. However, personal transformation also\nintroduces interesting metaphysical issues, and this section focuses\nupon those.\n\nPaul describes the situation as being one that \u201cradically\nchanges what it is like to be you, perhaps by replacing your core\npreferences with very different ones\u201d (Paul 2015a, 156). Life goals,\ncore preferences, or the way one experiences the world may constitute\npart of the change that occurs. Ullmann-Margalit (2006, 159) adds that\nbecause our beliefs and desires shape the core of who we are, changes\nto them turn us into a \u201cdifferent person\u201d. There\u2019s\nalso a terrifying sense of finality since these personal\ntransformations are \u201cirrevocable\u201d (Ullman-Margalit 2006, 160) or at least potentially\nirrevocable. This picture painted by Paul and Ullmann-Margalit is\nsometimes characterized as a \u201cReplacement Model\u201d (see\nLambert & Schwenkler 2020b, \u00a7 5) because the agent contemplating\nundergoing transformation ends up \u201creplaced\u201d by the\ntransformed person. There\u2019s supposed to be a literal sense in\nwhich the pre-transformation agent ceases to exist.\n\nSpelling out the sense in which the agent no longer exists is tricky.\nFocusing on core features is one natural way to explain the difference\nbetween the pre-transformed agent and future transformed person.\nPerhaps when enough core features are lost, the pre-transformed agent\nceases to exist. (In essentialist language, perhaps some of these core\nfeatures are essential, or such that the agent cannot survive the loss\nof them.) There\u2019s an open question regarding which of our\nfeatures count as core in this way, and some empirical studies suggest\nthat we at least do regard some our features as being essential in\nthis way. Molouki, Chen, Urminsky, and Bartels (2020) have done\nempirical work to see whether people exhibit semi-uniform views about\nwhich features are central to their selves. Their findings support\nearlier work by Strohminger and Nichols (2014) suggesting that\nfeatures concerning morality (e.g., character traits) and personality\nare taken to be most central. Changes that are perceived as most\ndrastic involve morality and personality, as well as features that are\ntaken to be causally central. For instance, if someone takes\n\u201cbeing a philosopher\u201d to be causally central to how they\nnavigate the world, then they tend to regard losing that feature as a\ndrastic change. Valence and desires also matter: people take negative\nand undesired change to be more drastic. The explanation for\nasymmetric valence and desire perceptions rests upon the fact that\npeople project their future selves to undergo positive development, so\nnegative and undesired changes lie outside their self-conception.\nThese finding cohere with many of the sorts of personal\ntransformations that constitute personal transformations.\n\nA second sort of claim that\u2019s frequently made is that the\npre-transformed agent cannot identify first-personally with the future\ntransformed person, and vice versa. For instance, Velleman (1996)\ndraws a distinction between imagining what Napoleon saw when looking\nout at Austerlitz and imagining oneself as Napoleon looking out at\nAusterlitz. The latter removes all first-personal traces of the\nimaginer (and is likely impossible to do). Paul (2017) makes a similar\nclaim when distinguishing between affective and cognitive empathy. The\nformer involves projecting our current selves into potential future\nscenarios, like if I imagine what it will be for me (a childless\nperson) to have a child. It\u2019s akin to the way we empathize with\nothers. The latter is much richer, and it involves experiencing the\npotential future from the perspective of the future, rather than\ncurrent self. To cognitively empathize with my future self who has a\nchild, I would have to put myself into the first-personal experience\nof that person who now has the preferences and perspective of a\nparent. According to Paul, I lack the ability to cognitively empathize\nwith my future parent self because that self is too unrelated to my\ncurrent self. In general, we are not able to empathize with our\ndistant future selves, even if those selves haven\u2019t undergone a\ndramatic transformation. If Velleman and Paul are right, then the\nsevering of the first-personal perspective and empathy that occurs\nafter transformation is one way in which the pre-transformed agent\nceases to exist.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s helpful to take a step back and consider the ways\nin which the future-transformed person is a different person. Suppose\nthat losing central features and a disconnect in first-personal\nperspective are sufficient for replacing the pre-transformed agent\nwith a new person. How do we explain the connection between the future\nand past person? On the replacement theory, transformative change\nresults in a new person. Can we coherently say that the\npre-transformed person has become the new person? Or does\ntransformation annihilate and replace them?\n\nThe trick to explaining how one can become someone new without being\nannihilated involves articulating two different senses of\n\u201csameness\u201d: one in which the past and future persons are\nthe same and one in which they are not. For instance, Glazier (2020)\nnotes that the type of explanation demanded mirrors a debate about\nwhether contingentism is a coherent view. On contingentism,\nit\u2019s possible that I (or anyone else) could be someone else.\nPhilosophers who champion the necessity of identity tend to reject\nthis claim as straightforwardly absurd. To explain how their account\nis coherent, the contingentist must identify two senses in which\nidentity claims are necessary. Glazier\u2019s suggestion rests on the\nclaim that that no one\u2019s perspective is impossible. Roughly,\nthere\u2019s a proprial, or perspectival, sense in which a\nclaim like \u201cI am Fred\u201d is necessary. It\u2019s necessary\nfrom \u201cI\u2019s\u201d perspective that they are Fred because\nfrom their perspective the world is centered upon both the\n\u201cI\u201d and \u201cFred\u201d. However, it\u2019s possible\nthat the world could have centered on someone else, say Georgia. In\nthat case, there\u2019s a non-proprial sense in which \u201cI\u201d\nshould have been Georgia. This latter, non-proprial sense in which\n\u201cI should have been Georgia\u201d generates the contingency of\nidentity.\n\nChan (2019) offers a different account on which the past and future\npersons might be the same metaphysically speaking, but\ndifferent in terms of their practical identities. These\npractical identities are characterized by the traits that are changed\nin personal transformation: core preferences, life goals, ways of\nnavigating the world, continuity of first-personal identity, and the\nlike. Importantly, these traits form the person\u2019s self, or at\nleast the self that\u2019s relevant for considerations of\nself-interest. This explains why ordinary decision-making procedures\nhave difficulty when it comes to transformative experiences. (More on\nthis in the next section.) Furthermore, distinguishing between\nmetaphysical and practical senses of sameness explains the (practical)\nsense in which the person becomes someone new and the (metaphysical)\nsense in which they endure and are not annihilated.\n4. Decision Theory: Is It Rational to Choose Transformative Experiences?\n\nTransformative experiences present several challenges for traditional\nmodels of decision theory. First, the epistemically transformative\ncomponent of the transformative experience involves a lack of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge. Purportedly, this in\nturn involves a type of uncertainty that is different from the type of\nuncertainty decision theory is designed to handle. Second, the\npersonally transformative component means that the post-transformation\nperson may be extremely different from the pre-transformed person.\nTheir preferences may radically change in unpredictable ways, and\ndecision procedures must find a way to accommodate these changing\npreferences. Third, the personal transformation may be so extreme that\nthe pre-transformed person considering whether to undergo the\ntransformative experience can\u2019t make the decision in the\nstraightforwardly self-interested way that\u2019s presupposed in\nstandard decision-making models. Any of these challenges make using\ndecision-making procedures impossible in the case of transformative\nexperience. And if that\u2019s the case, then it looks like one\ncan\u2019t rationally choose to undergo a transformative\nexperience\u2014the choice is either arational or irrational. Given\nthat so many of our momentous choices in life involve potentially\ntransformative outcomes, it would be disturbing if we discovered that\nthese choices could not be made rationally.\n4.1 \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d Uncertainty\n\nStandard decision models take probabilities and values as inputs and\nproduce expected values as outputs. For instance, suppose ESPN\u2019s\noutcome predictor projects the Kansas City Chiefs as having a 50%\nchance to win the Super Bowl, yet the moneyline, which is based on\nbetting activity, is +105 (meaning that if you bet $100 on them and\nthey win, you receive $105 in winning plus your initial $100 wager).\nBy weighting the possible outcomes with their corresponding\nprobabilities, we can calculate the expected value of betting $100 on\nthe Chiefs: \n\\[ .5(105) + .5 (-100) = 2.5 \\]\n\n\nIf one uses a decision procedure where one maximizes expected value,\nit\u2019s rational to bet on the Chiefs since betting $100 has an\nexpected value of $2.50 while not betting has an expected value of 0\nsince there are no gains or losses. There are other decision\nprocedures one might use as well. For instance, one might prefer a\nmaximin procedure, in which one chooses the option with the\nbest worst outcome. Since the worst outcome of betting on the Chiefs\nis losing money and the worst outcome of not betting is neither\ngaining nor losing money, not betting is the best worst outcome. Thus,\na maximin procedure would recommend not betting. Crucially for our\npurposes, it doesn\u2019t matter which decision procedure\none utilizes. Rather, what matters is that values and probabilities\n(or at least possibilities) are required for any decision procedure to\noperate.\n\nOn the first challenge for decision theory, transformative experiences\nare epistemically transformative, and agents do not know what the\nexperience will be like. What an experience is like determines the\nvalue associated with the experience. At the most basic level, part of\nwhat an experience is like involves the pain or pleasure of the\nexperience. Pain detracts from the value of the experience while\npleasure enhances it. More complex components of what the experience\nis like also affect the value of the experience. While some other\nfactors\u2014such as moral or social ones\u2014may affect the value\nof the experience, what the experience itself is like clearly plays a\nlarge role in determining value. Without knowing what the experience\nis like, agents can\u2019t reliably project its value. If the value\nof the experience is not known, then the value of any outcome\ninvolving transformative experiences also remains unknown. Thus, an\nagent choosing between options that may involve transformative\nexperience cannot use standard decision procedures since those\nprocedures require values as inputs.\n\nThis purported challenge is highly contested. Recall from\n \u00a72\n that many philosopher reject the claim that experiences like\nparenthood are epistemically transformative (e.g., Harman,\nKrishnamurthy, etc.). Denying that the experiences are epistemically\ntransformative means that agents can know something about\nwhat the experiences are like prior to having them. For instance, the\ntestimony of parents or the non-phenomenal elements of the experience\nmight provide some sense of what becoming a parent is like. If\nthat\u2019s right, then perhaps at least rough values can be used in\na decision procedure.\n\nAlternatively, one might grant that we can\u2019t know anything about\nwhat transformative experiences are like. Nevertheless, one might\nstill be able to use standard decision procedures since we may know\nabout the values associated with the experience even if we don\u2019t\nknow what the experience is like. For instance, Dougherty, Horowitz,\nand Sliwa (2015) invite us to consider a mystery box. Everyone who\nlooks into the mystery box has a positive experience, though they\ncannot describe what the experience is like. On the basis of this\ninformation\u2014that the value associated with the box is always\npositive\u2014one can rationally choose to look in the box without\nknowing what that will be like.\n\nSimilarly, knowing the valence of outcomes can often provide rational\ngrounds on which to make a decision even if what the outcome is like\nis unknown. Pascal\u2019s Wager offers one such scenario: the\ninfinite positive value of eternal happiness swamps any finite value.\nThus, one is rationally justified\u2014or perhaps even\nrequired!\u2014to try to believe in God. McKinnon (2015) offers the\nopposite sort of case by inviting us to consider an individual\nconsidering transitioning. Prior to transitioning, many trans people\nsuffer from severe depression and are at risk of suicide. Even if they\ndo not know exactly what it will be like to transition, the\nalternative is sufficiently horrible, and thus the decision to\ntransition can be rational.\n\nPaul (2015b) suggests that all these responses miss the mark. First,\npeople who choose transformative experience purely on the basis of\nvalues without knowing what the experience will be like are not\nchoosing on the basis of what the experience is like. Of course, it\ncan often be appropriate to make choices without considering what the\noutcomes will be like\u2014cases involving moral stakes are one such\nscenario. However, in many paradigm cases such as parenthood, agents\noften do envision what their future lives will be like and base their\ndecisions, at least partially, on that vision. Second, Paul emphasizes\nthe importance of the values being subjective, or assigned by\nthe agent. Because decisions involving transformative experience are\npersonally significant, agents need to make the choice\nauthentically. On Paul\u2019s account, authenticity requires\nthat the agents themselves ascribe value to the experience. (More on\nauthenticity in\n \u00a75.)\n Thus, testimony from others about the values they\u2019ve ascribed\nto an experience won\u2019t help an agent choose authentically for\nthemselves.\n4.2 Future Preference Uncertainty\n\nSuppose that the approximate values of associated with outcomes can be\nknown. The second challenge for standard decision theory procedures\narises from the fact that transformative experiences have the\npotential to be personally transformative. Since personal\ntransformation can involve extreme preference changes, the way\noutcomes are valued might not remain stable from before and after the\ntransformation. For instance, a prospective parent might not value\nsleep, but once they become a parent confronted with a screaming\ninfant that needs to be fed every few hours throughout the night, the\nway they value sleep may drastically shift. The values of outcomes\nused as inputs typically correspond to the preferences of the\npre-transformed agent making the decision. If those preferences will\nshift unpredictably post-transformation, then knowing the values\nassociated with the outcomes still may not be enough to allow an agent\nto make a rational decision.\n\nIn some sense, the challenge of changing preferences blends two\nfamiliar problems. First, preferences change over time. For instance,\npeople with the means to save for retirement must balance their\ncurrent preferences with what they believe will be their future ones.\nAn extreme saver\u2019s later self may look back and wish their\nearlier self had spent more on vacations. Transformative experiences\nadd a further wrinkle by making the future preferences unknown.\nSecond, changing preferences present a diachronic problem in which\npast, present, and future preferences must be balanced against each\nother. Presumably, this balancing involves aggregating all of these\npreferences, as well as deciding how to weigh them. For instance, many\npeople are near-biased, and tend to weigh the preferences of their\ncurrent and near-future selves far heavier than the preferences of\ntheir distant-future selves. The preferences of past selves rarely\nreceive any attention at all. (Parfit [1984] has a series of thought\nexperiments generating the intuition that it\u2019s better for pain\nto be in the past, even if past pain is more severe than future pain.\nSullivan [2018] and Boonin [2019] offer uncommonly held dissenting\nviews: the former argues for temporal neutrality, or not engaging in\nany temporal discounting of the past or distant future, while the\nlatter argues that the past preferences\u2014even those belonging to\npeople who are no longer alive\u2014matter.)\n\nPettigrew (2019) offers a sophisticated account that has two\ncomponents aimed at tackling both of these problems. The first, aimed\nat the uncertainty surrounding what the future preferences\nwill be, bears similarity to responses to the challenge of assigning\nvalues given the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d uncertainty.\nBasically, just as we can gather information about how people value\ntransformative experiences, we can gather information about how\npeople\u2019s preferences change after undergoing transformative\nexperiences. In an oversimplified example, if it turned out that 95%\nof new parents would prefer to be childless again, then given that one\nchooses to have a child, there would be a 95% chance that their future\nself would have the childless preference while there\u2019d be a 5%\nchance that their future self would have a child-full preference.\nThen, just as decision procedures weigh the values of potential\noutcomes by their likelihood when we make decisions, they could\ninclude weighted preferences.\n\nThe second component, aimed at tackling the diachronic aspect of\nchanging preferences, introduces a weighted general value function\nthat aggregates the \u201clocal\u201d value functions that\ncorrespond to the past, present, and future selves that make up the\nentire life of the agent. Further, the way in which the local value\nfunctions are aggregated can incorporate differences in the ways in\nwhich local selves handle probability assignments, decision\nprocedures, and the weighing of, e.g., past versus future preferences.\nAggregating the local value functions thus begins to resemble a social\nchoice problem. Agents faced with choosing for changing selves ought\nto maximize the general value function, which aggregates the local\nvalue functions accounting for each temporally located local self.\n\nPaul (2022) points out that Pettigrew\u2019s account is vulnerable in\ntwo ways. First, the type of solution proposed by Pettigrew likens\nfuture selves to third parties. As noted, the weighted general value\nfunction closely resembles functions that aggregate individual\npreferences to group ones in social contexts. But it seems\ninappropriate to treat our future selves as third persons instead of\nfully integrated selves\u2014and this is precisely the thrust of the\nproblem that transformative experience presents! Second, it assumes\nthat meaningful intrapersonal comparisons can be made. There\u2019s\nsome empirical work, especially regarding how people with disabilities\njudge their own welfare, that suggests these comparisons are difficult\nto make. Pettigrew (2019, \u00a7 8.6) attempts to address this issue with his\n\u201cmatching intervals solution\u201d, which attempts to scale\nthe different utility functions to each other. Briggs (2015) offers a\nprudence-inspired alternative that rests on privileging a\nperson\u2019s actual preferences (as opposed to their counterfactual\npreferences) without privileging their present preferences (as opposed\nto privileging present over future ones). Though success of any of\nthese intrapersonal comparisons is an open question, there is\nwidespread agreement that they are necessary to explain how future\npreferences can matter.\n4.3 Self Uncertainty\n\nFinally, the personally transformative aspect of transformative\nexperiences creates the possibility of future selves who are so\ndifferent from their pre-transformed selves that neither the earlier\nnor later selves regards the other as being \u201cthe same\u201d\nperson. As Ullmann-Margalit (2006, 158) puts it, \u201cbig\u201d\ndecisions are \u201ccore-affecting\u201d and \u201ctransform one\u2019s\nfuture self in a significant way\u201d such that one emerges from the\nsituation a different person. As we saw in\n \u00a73,\n spelling out the exact sense of in which one can become a different\nperson is tricky. However, examples illustrate how one might regard a\ntemporally related self as a different person, and shed light on the\nexact nature of the problem for standard decision-making\nprocedures.\n\nParfit (1984, 326) tells the story of a young Russian who holds his\nsocialist ideals close to his heart. The young Russian also happens\ndescend from the aristocracy, and stands to inherit a fortune when his\nrelatives die. He realizes that when this happens, he may lose his\nsocialist ideals. His instructions to his wife\u2014\u201cif I lose\nthese ideals, I want you to think that I cease to\nexist\u201d\u2014reveals that he regards that potential future self\nas a different person. This type of example reinforces Paul\u2019s\n(2017) claim that we cannot first-personally project into futures that\nare too distant or different. Agents who fully appreciate the\npersonally transformative element of transformative experiences\nrealize that these experiences may potentially transform them into\nsomeone different. Thus, from the perspective of the agent deciding\nwhether to undergo a transformative experience, they must treat\noutcomes involving transformation as ones in which they may no longer\nexist.\n\nThe possibility of non-existence (or something regarded as equivalent\nto non-existence) means that even if an agent knows all the fact about\nvalue and future preferences, they cannot use standard decision-making\nprocedures in a straightforward way\u2014at least not if\nthey\u2019re self-interested. After all, even if a future transformed\nself would be incredibly happy and live a good, meaningful life, that\ndoesn\u2019t help the agent contemplating transformation if that\nfuture transformed self is not them in the relevant sense. Chan (2019)\nmakes exactly this point in the context of Pascal\u2019s Wager. The\ninfinite happiness of the believer doesn\u2019t benefit the\nnon-believer precisely because becoming transformed by faith would\nchange them into a different person (which in turn undermines the\nWager\u2019s appeal to self-interest). This point is closely related\nto the challenge raised by Paul for Pettigrew\u2019s view in the\nprevious subsection\n (\u00a74.2).\n The future self is alien, and though there might be some decision\nprocedure by which to make a rational decision to bring about that\nfuture self, that procedure is not the one related to the sense of\nself-interested that is under discussion.\n\nA response to this challenge requires choosing in a way that bridges\nthe gap between the pre-transformed agent and the future transformed\nself. Given the nature of transformative experience, it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how this could occur precisely since the\npre-transformed agent lacks the ability to connect in the right way to\nthe future transformed self. That connection goes beyond knowing the\nrelevant values, probabilities, and value functions. It gets at the\nagent\u2019s ability to choose authentically, to which\n \u00a75\n turns.\n4.4 Reasonable, Not Rational\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth considering the possibility that rational\nchoice is simply not possible when it comes to transformative\nexperience. Ullmann-Margalit and Morgenbesser (1977) discuss\n\u201cpicking,\u201d which is characterized by indifference between\nalternatives, such as when one pick's between cans of the same flavor\nof Cambell's soup. By stipulation, picking can't appeal to values,\npreferences, or the sense of rationality discussed above\u2014those\nthings undertermine which alternative is optimal, which gives rise to\nthe indifference in the first place. Importantly for Ullmann-Margalit\nand Morgenbesser, picking extends beyond trivial \u201cCambell's soup\u201d\nchoices to bigger ones, including transformative experiences. Even our\nvalues and preferences  themselves (assuming we have control over\nthem) may be subject to picking, since it's would be circular\nto appeal to them in order to explain why we hold them. Thus,\nmany of our major life decisions, including potentially transformative\nones, are subject to picking, rather than rational choice.\n\nContinuing this line of thought, Ullmann-Margalit (2006) suggests that\nrather than focusing on acting rational in the sense of\n\u201coptimizing\u201d (as one does with standard\ndecision-procedures), one ought to focus on \u201cacting\nreasonably\u201d. For instance, transformation involves both\ndiscontinuity in one\u2019s life as well as a point of no return. A\nreasonable way of navigating choices that involve these two\nfeatures involves attempting to minimize those features. For instance,\na person contemplating a transformative decision like marriage might\ntry to ease into it by first moving in with their potential spouse.\nDoing so minimizes the discontinuity and gives them an out, which\nmakes the decision revocable. If Ullmann-Margalit is correct in\nsuggesting that one might be able to build up to a transformative\nexperience little by little, this raises an extremely interesting\nquestion for transformations that unfold gradually over time. Is it\npossible that each incremental step can be made rationally while a\ngiant leap to transformation cannot be made rationally?\n5. Existentialism: Choosing Authentically\n\nInvestigating decisions involving transformative experiences magnifies\nan existential problem as well. Recall from\n \u00a74\n that many of the strategies for making rational transformative\ndecisions fail to also preserve authenticity. When transformation is\non the table, who we are is at stake. And the choice of who we are is\nmore fundamental than the other types of decisions we make. Who we are\nprovides the framework from which we make other choices, so a choice\nthat could change who we are is a choice between frameworks that\nitself lacks a framework from which to deliberate. As Ullmann-Margalit\nputs it:\n\n\nAt bottom, we make our most fundamental choices of the canons of\nmorality, logic and rationality in total freedom and without appeal to\nreasons. They embody acts that this literature variously describes as\nnihilist, absurd, or leaps (of faith). (2006: 172)\n\n\nOn the flip side, what \u201cthis literature\u201d does permit is\nauthentic choice. For instance, deciding to transform without\nappealing to reason (perhaps because one cannot appeal to reason)\ncoheres well to the Sartrean idea that persons do not antecedently\nhave a particular telos. Rather, we are free to be our\nauthentic selves precisely because are unconstrained and can choose\nwho we want to be.\n\nOn this existentialist gloss, authenticity stands in tension with\nrationality when it comes to transformative experiences. On the one\nhand, we want to be able to rationally defend our big decisions to\nhave a child, marry a particular person, or commit to a vocation. But\non the other, these are the types of decisions that we also want to\nmake authentically, and that doesn\u2019t seem possible if\nwe\u2019re merely following what a decision procedure recommends. In\nfact, empirical research suggests that people do care deeply about\nauthenticity. Furthermore, people approach decisions perceived to\ninvolve authenticity differently from more ordinary ones. Oktar and\nLombrozo (2022) gave subjects vignettes in which deciding based on\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d (which was akin to standard decision\nmaking) conflicted with deciding based on intuition. For instance, one\nscenario involved picking between two people with whom to pursue a\nromantic relationship. One person is a better \u201con paper\u201d\nmatch, and it\u2019s stipulated that you believe the method that\ndetermines them as such is accurate. The other person is one with whom\nyou vibe with better in that sort of intangible, gut-feeling sort of\nway. Subjects leaned strongly toward pursuing a relationship with the\nlatter person (the \u201cintuition\u201d choice) instead of the\nformer (the \u201cdeliberation\u201d choice). They also perceived\nthis case as one that involves authenticity. In fact, when a choice\nwas perceived to involve authenticity, subjects favored\nintuition-based decisions over deliberation-based ones. The preference\nof for intuition over deliberation raises the question of whether\nthere are non-deliberative (in the sense of standard decision-making)\nprocedures that can help us choose in transformative decisions in a\nway that preserves authenticity.\n\nIn fact, there are accounts that purport to preserve authenticity\nwhile also preserving rationality. Paul (2014) favors\nchoosing on the basis of revelation. According to Paul, the decision\nshould be reframed as one that asks whether the agent wants to\ndiscover what life will be like and who the agent will become,\npost-transformation. Essentially, the agent chooses transformation for\nits own sake. In doing so, the agent chooses rationally by choosing in\naccordance with the preference for discovery. The agent also chooses\nauthentically by choosing based on the desire to know what the\nexperience will be like for them and who they will\nbecome once transformed. The problem is that choosing based on\nrevelation does not always seem appropriate given the import of many\ntransformative experience. For instance, many transformative\nexperiences involve other people, such as becoming a parent or\nmarrying someone. Choosing these experiences on the basis of\nrevelation fails to capture concern for the resulting child or the\nfuture spouse. Paul might respond that this objection to revelation is\na moral one, and that a similar objection could be levied if the\nchoice were made on the basis of self-interest. Thus, the objection\nmight not count specifically against revelation. However,\nthere\u2019s a second worry, which is that revelation doesn\u2019t\nhelp in cases where the decision lies between two transformative\noutcomes as opposed to a decision between the status quo and one\ntransformative outcome.\n\nCallard (2018) picks up on this last worry and points out that\nrevelation for its own sake lacks a mechanism for valuing different\nrevelations differently. Instead, Callard favors an account based on\naspiration and proleptic reasons. For Callard,\nproleptic reasons are provisional ones aimed at a good to which one\naspires but may only have an \u201cinchoate, anticipatory, and\nindirect grasp\u201d. For instance, someone who aspires to be a wine\nconnoisseur initially lacks any conception of what they are trying to\nappreciate or experience when they take a sip of wine. Importantly,\nproleptic reasons allow the aspirant to act rationally when they start\nthe process even though they lack knowledge of what the end goal is\nlike. Interestingly, these types of cases typically lack the sharp\ndiscontinuity that are associated with paradigm transformative\nexperiences like parenthood. In fact, Callard suggests that parenthood\nis not as discontinuous as assumed because potential parents often\ndedicate a lot of mental energy to the decision and learning all they\ncan about parenthood. What appears to be a climactic\n\u201clet\u2019s go for it\u201d is \u201cembedded in a longer\ntransformative journey\u201d (Callard 2018, 63). Putting all of this together,\ntransformative decisions can be made rationally via proleptic reasons\nand are authentic since they result from intentional deliberation\nabout who the agent hopes to become.\n\nChang (2015) offers an interestingly different way of approaching\ntransformative decision making. Chang starts by distinguishing between\nevent-based and choice-based transformations. The\nformer are the type that fit how transformative experiences are\ntypically described. They involve experiences that are downstream from\nthe choice\u2014like becoming a parent\u2014that transform the\nagent. The latter is where Chang\u2019s interest lies. Choice-based\ntransformation is one in which \u201cthe making of the choice itself\ntransforms you\u201d (Chang 2015, 240). Here, Chang has in mind cases in which one\ninvokes voluntarist reasons when making a decision. Voluntarist\nreasons are reasons generated by the will that\u2014on Chang\u2019s\naccount\u2014are appropriate when all other existing reasons\nunderdetermine what an agent ought to do. (Chang favors an account in\nwhich the will strengthens an existing reasons, but there are other\nvoluntarists like Korsgaard (1996) who hold that the will can create\nreasons ex nihilo.) Crucially, in willing a voluntarist\nreason, one simultaneously reveals themself to be the type of person\nfor whom that choice is rational. This type of account also appears to\npreserve authenticity (since what could be more authentic than\none\u2019s own will) and rationality (since adding the voluntarist\nreason to the mix tips the scales in favor of the choice that\u2019s\nbeen made). Of course, voluntarist accounts are somewhat\ncontroversial, so Chang\u2019s account of how to make transformative\nchoices would inherit all the worries that voluntarism does.\n\nAlhough these accounts\u2014Paul\u2019s, Callard\u2019s, or\nChang\u2019s\u2014all face worries, it is worth noting that\nif any of them work, then there is a way to preserve both authenticity\nand rationality even while respecting the original challenge of\ntransformative experience to standard decision making procedures.\nNone require knowing what the experience will be like or who will come\nout the other end. Nevertheless, one can still rationally and\nauthentically plunge into the unknown.\n6. Applied Ethics: In Light of Transformation, How Should We Treat Others?\n\nTransformative experiences also demand that we revisit how we treat\nothers in light of the fact that they potentially may undergo\ntransformative experiences. As seen in\n \u00a71,\n transformation may arise in many contexts, far too many to attempt to\ntackle here. Instead, this section will focus on three types of\ncontexts in which the issue of how we should treat others given the\npossibility of transformation might arise: when we choose for others,\nwhen we make long-term decisions involving others, and when we create\nenvironments that (dis)favor transformation.\n6.1 Choosing for Others\n\nPlausibly, it\u2019s wrong to interfere with the autonomy of others,\nespecially when it comes to important personal decisions. As Akhlaghi\n(2022, 7) points out, interference is even less defensible when\nothers are choosing to undergo transformative experiences because\nthere is a\n\n\nmoral duty not to interfere with the autonomous self-making of others,\nthrough their choosing to undergo transformative experience to\ndiscover who they will become.\n\n\nHowever, people often find themselves in situations in which they need\nto make decisions on behalf of others that may lead to transformative\nexperiences. In fact, those who take the leap and become parents then\nfind themselves in a position to make transformative decisions on\nbehalf of their children. For instance, some parents of deaf children\nmust decide whether to get cochlear implants for their child. Ideally,\nchildren receive these implants when they are extremely young, usually\nbefore the age of three. The early age at which the decision must be\nmade forces parents to choose on behalf of their children. In addition\nto being a choice that affects how their children will perceive and\nnavigate the world, the choice carries incredibly significant social\nconsequences. Deaf communities offer distinctive goods that hearing\ncommunities cannot, and vice versa. Furthermore, as disability\nadvocates point out, the difference between being deaf and non-deaf is\n\u201cmere-difference\u201d rather than \u201cbad-difference\u201d\n(see, e.g., Barnes 2014). This offers a further reason to believe that\nthe decision to give a child a cochlear implant is a transformative\none that must be made on the basis of the child\u2019s future\nexperiences as deaf or hearing as opposed to on the basis of\nvalue.\n\nPut this way, parental choices, especially significant ones like\ndeciding whether to get a child a cochlear implant, also resemble the\nnon-identity problem. Parfit (1984) raises the non-identity problem as\na puzzle for decisions that affect who will exist in the\nfuture. For instance, suppose a potential parent is choosing between\nimplanting one of two embryos, and chooses one that has a genetic\ndefect that causes monthly migraines that the other embryo lacks.\nGiven that there are no other relevant differences between the two\nembryos, it appears that the parent has done something wrong by\nbringing into existence a person who will have a lower level of\nwelfare than the other person who could have existed instead. However,\nit\u2019s not obvious who the potential parent has harmed.\nAssuming the migraine-inflicted person prefers existing to never\nhaving existed, they have not been harmed since the alternative is\nnon-existence. If that\u2019s right, then perhaps the parents have\ndone nothing wrong since no one has been harmed.\n\nSimilarly, the personally transformative aspect of transformative\nexperiences affects who exists after undergoing the experience.\nReceiving a cochlear implant and growing up in a hearing community\nwill transform the child into a radically different person from who\nthe child would be if they did not receive an implant and grew up in a\ndeaf community. The person who develops won\u2019t have grounds to\ncomplain since wishing their parents had chosen otherwise would be\nlike wishing they did not exist. But even if one does not believe that\nthe cochlear implant is an existence-affecting decision point, the\nfact that the two potential futures are so foreign to each other means\nthat a person situated in one of those futures cannot project what it\nwould be like to have had the other life. If the earlier points about\nprojecting value are correct, the person who has grown up in the deaf\ncommunity cannot assign a subjective value to the alternate life in\nwhich they had the cochlear implant, and vice versa. Without those\nvalue assignments, it doesn\u2019t appear that either person can\nclaim that they would have been better off in the alternate scenario.\nThus, whether the person receives the cochlear implant or not,\narticulating how that transformation harmed them will be challenging.\nPerhaps the parent can choose either option without harming or\nwronging anyone. The situation is also similar from the perspective of\nthe parents and their preferences, for they will have grown to love\ntheir child and the particular person into whom they have\ndeveloped.\n\nPhilosophers diverge on how parents should choose in these cases.\n(See, e.g., Harman (2015) for an interesting discussion on when\n\u201cI\u2019ll be glad I did it\u201d reasoning is appropriate.)\nHowever, there\u2019s a more interesting lesson to be drawn from\nthese types of cases. Recall from\n \u00a74.1\n and\n \u00a74.2\n that Paul objects to certain types of decision-making strategies\nbecause they treat future selves as if they were third persons rather\nthan integrated parts of the same self. These cases show that even in\nthe third person case, standard decision-making procedures are not\nparticularly helpful. Transformative experiences still create major\nchallenges for decision-making.\n\nAt the other end of life, decisions must sometimes be made for people\npost-transformation. People suffering from dementia or\nAlzheimer\u2019s transform in myriad ways, and their preferences\noften diverge from the preferences of their earlier selves. Sometimes,\nthese preferences regard end of life care. Since the person with\ndementia or Alzheimer\u2019s is not considered legally competent to\nchange their advanced directives, others must make important medical\ndecisions on their behalf. These people must decide whether to respect\nthe preferences of the past self, or the current one. In some ways,\nthis a questions about the weight that ought to be assigned to past\npreferences, and we might resolve in the way Pettigrew (2019) suggests\nby constructing a general value function that aggregates the past and\ncurrent preferences. However, if the personal transformation is taken\nseriously, the current self is a different person. Binding them to the\npreferences of the past self is akin to binding them to the\npreferences of another person.\n6.2 Long Term Decisions\n\nIn addition to transforming in the early and late stages of life,\npeople transform throughout their lives, either via momentous\n\u201cbig\u201d changes or via an accumulation of\n\u201csmall\u201d changes. Long-term decisions must factor the\npotential for transformative change into account. For instance, Lackey\n(2020) and Chan (2020) independently address this issue in the context\nof punishment. Lackey\u2019s argument demands that those with the\npower to issue long-term punishments, like judges, must consider the\npossibility of transformative change. Plausibly, punishment should be\nsensitive to the relevant evidence available at that time. We know\nthat people change, often in transformative ways, and imprisonment\nseems like exactly the type of experience that would be\ntransformative. Issuing strict, long-term prison sentences\u2014such\nas life sentences without the possibility of parole\u2014screens off\nthe possibility of taking relevant future evidence into account. Thus,\nrecognizing the possibility of transformation offers a powerful\nargument for sentencing reform.\n\nExtended partnerships also provide another context in which\ntransformative changes need to be accounted for when making long term\ndecisions. For instance, marriage vows typically involve some type of\nlife-long pledge. And, as anyone familiar with married people knows,\npeople change in ways that disrupt the marriage. In a way, identifying\nthese changes as transformative makes sense of an already common\nphenomenon. But it also raises a further question: how can one\nfelicitously make a life-long promise to someone knowing that both\nthey and their partner may transform in a way involving a radical\nshift of preferences and life goals? The centrality of transformation\nto this decision is doubled because the marriage itself is often\ntransformative. It\u2019s true that transformations connected with\nrelationships tend to involve incremental changes because the\nrelationship develops incrementally. But these incremental changes can\nlead people away from each other and won\u2019t be noticeable until\nthe larger schism develops due to their incremental nature.\n\nThese long-term decisions involving others suggest that the normative\nquestions transformative experiences raise go beyond self-interested\ndecision making. Furthermore, some of the proposed ways of making\ntransformative decisions have interesting implications for these types\nof cases. For instance, Ullmann-Margalit suggests that there simply is\nnot a rational way to make transformative decisions. Applying that to\nthese cases gives the radical result that decision to marry or\nsentence someone to prison cannot be made rationally!\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s further suggestion that perhaps these\ndecisions can be made reasonably also has interesting implications.\nShe suggests that minimizing the discontinuity of a big decision and\nbacking off the point of no return might help, and includes moving in\nbefore marriage as one such way to ease reasonably into a big decision\nlike marriage. The application for the prison case is even more\ninteresting, for it suggests that life in prison should not be such a\nradical departure from life outside of it, and that there must be\nmeaningful short term possibilities for parole.\n6.3 Transformative Environments\n\nFinally, special attention must be paid to our social environments\nsince they shape the way in which members of society may transform.\nEducation provides the most obvious instance of this. Fights over\nparental rights to control their children\u2019s educations are so\ncontentious precisely because early experiences shape who children\ngrow up to become. Even higher education is taken to have a\ntransformative goal (see Paul & Quiggin 2020). College students\nare typically in their early twenties\u2014the last age at which\npeople tend to undergo radical change before developing fairly stable\npreferences and goals that tend to endure through most of adulthood.\nIn addition, the transformative environment of education shapes more\nthan the individual students who experience it. Students go on to\nbecome members of society who in turn create an environment that will\nshape those who come after them. Morton (2021) points out that this\ntends to have a self-reinforcing effect because elite institutions\nlike the Ivy League schools disproportionately influence social\npolicy. Even if students enter these institutions without the goal of\nmaintaining the status quo of the elite, by the time they graduate,\nthey can be transformed into members of the elite who are now invested\nin safeguarding the interests of their newfound group. This, in turn,\nshapes social policies that reinforce which transformative experiences\nare most readily available to members of society.\n\nThis idea that social policies can shape individual choices and\npreferences creates both an opportunity and a responsibility to\nreconsider which policies ought to be adopted in light of the\npotential for transformative experience. For instance, Pettigrew\n(2023) examines the concept of nudging introduced by Thaler\nand Sunstein (2008). In a nutshell, nudging is a sort of intervention\nthat pushes people toward making a particular choice while leaving\nopen the possibility that they choose otherwise. Opt-out retirement\nprograms offer a paradigm case of nudging since they increase the\nlikelihood that people will put money away for retirement while still\nallowing people the ability to opt-out. Thaler and Sunstein label\nnudging policies as \u201clibertarian paternalism\u201d because\nwhile these interventions look paternalistic, they purportedly help\npeople make the decision that their future idealized selves will deem\nto be best \u201cas judged by themselves\u201d (Thaler and Sunstein 2008, 4). Of course, if the\ndecisions are transformative, or incremental parts of multiple\ndecisions that become transformative, simply looking at the judgment\nof the future self does not seem appropriate at all! (And Pettigrew\nmakes precisely this argument before proposing a modification to the\n\u201cas judged by themselves\u201d test that\u2019s based on his\nweighted general value function.)\n\nThere are at least two bigger-picture issues that come out of this\ndiscussion of nudging people, potentially toward transformation.\nFirst, the norms regarding nudging people toward potential\ntransformation requires further examination. Most policies, nudging or\notherwise, exhibit some degree of interventionism. In addition to\nwhich transformations might be preferable for society as a whole,\nthere\u2019s also the question of whether we should adopt policies\nthat maximize individual autonomy. Second, we might wonder why nudging\nworks in the first place, and if it really does work for\ntransformative experiences. Recall that part of the nature of\ntransformative experiences is that one cannot know what they will be\nlike or how they will change prior to having the experience. Nudging,\non the other hand, only works if these things are somewhat\npredictable. Of course, unpredictability with respect to an individual\nis compatible with predictability with respect to overall social\ntrends. But, if nudging really works, it does lend credence to the\nidea certain elements of transformative experience are predictable and\nperhaps strengthens the case of those from\n \u00a74\n who believe that one can make rational choices with respect to\ntransformative experiences.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve structured our society in many unfortunate ways.\nThis goes beyond the discrimination that people suffer on the basis of\nrace, sex, ability, socioeconomic status, and the like. More subtle\nconceptual structures shape and limit the way we form our\nself-identities. These injustices are obviously bad in themselves, and\nthey also interact with transformative experience in a way that\nfurthers the injustice. Barnes (2015) argues that one\u2019s\n\u201cself-conception and self-identity aren\u2019t developed in\ncultural isolation\u201d and that \u201csocial norms and structures\nmake certain ways of interpreting or thinking about ourselves readily\navailable\u201d (185). For example, society makes it easy for women\nto \u201cre-shape their self-conception to cohere with the image of a\ndutiful, submissive wife\u201d (186). Similarly, \u201cbrave\ninspiration\u201d is a readily available self-conception for disabled\npeople while \u201cthriving person in an unconventional body\u201d\nis not (185\u2013186). These states of affairs are bad for women and\ndisabled people.  Since personal transformation involves changes to\none\u2019s self-conception, society plays an outsized role in the\ntypes of transformations that are available to us.\n",
