    "main_text": "Applications || Bioethics\n7.2 Bioethics\n\n\nBioethics is another area of applied philosophy where feminist\nthinking, while making its mark, at least initially occluded\ndisability perspectives. Feminist bioethicists most often have aligned\nwith the principle that women are owed control of their own bodies.\nWhile this idea may appear compatible with the value of\nself-determination promoted by much disability philosophy, some\nbioethicists, including some who are feminists, have adopted\nmedicalized views of disability and, in doing so, have argued that the\nprospect of bearing a disabled child justifies, or even obligates,\ntermination of the pregnancy (Purdy 1995; see also McMahan 1998 and\nMcMahan 2005). A related but not identical position challenges\n\u201cBaby Doe\u201d laws that prohibit hospitals from denying\nneonates with disabilities effective life-saving treatment, arguing\nthat parents should be free to decide whether their child's life will\nbe worth living (Paris et al. 2005). \n\n\nFeminist bioethicist Adrienne Asch has carefully distinguished between\na woman's right to terminate her pregnancy and the moral constraints\non her terminating the life of her new-born child.  Disability does\nnot diminish the claims of neonates, nor of other individuals with\ndisabilities, to the necessities of life (Asch 1990 2002; Asch and\nGeller 1996; Asch, Gostin and Johnson 2003; Kittay 2005). Disability\nscholars generally have objected to the unfounded presumption that\nbeing disabled makes life not worth living, or at least makes the\nlives of people with disabilities less gratifying and valuable than\nthose of nondisabled people. The social isolation to which disabled\nindividuals often are condemned results in nondisabled people being\nmisinformed about their potential for satisfying lives. Terminating a\npregnancy because the resulting child may have an impairment reduces\nthe individual to the disability, but people with disabilities are as\nmuch a sum of many different strengths and flaws as nondisabled people\nare (Parens and Asch 1999). Like Asch, Carlson urges feminists to be\nwary of women's being induced to accept social roles in which they\ndevalue individuals who are disabled. She notes that feminist programs\nfor the availability of birth control often invoked fears of\nperpetuating feeblemindedness to support their case. Carlson warns\nthat genetic counseling, which also is work done primarily by women,\nmay function in a similar gatekeeping role (Carlson 2010).\n\n\nThe objectionable presumptive devaluing of life with a disability is\nnot compatible with a full and equitable commitment to reproductive\nliberty. Philosophers as well as policy makers have invoked the\nsupposed inescapable suffering of disabled people as a reason for\nbarring deaf women and women with dwarfism from using reproductive\ntechnology (for example, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis) to bear\nchildren like themselves, narrowing these women's reproductive\nchoices. An additional consistency challenge emerges in regard to\nthe influence that the prospect of a sad or bad life should have on the\nreproductive liberty to bear children who may or will have\ndisabilities. Feminists condemn the practice of aborting female fetuses\nand of female infanticide, even where women lead inescapably miserable\nlives. It is difficult to see what, other than the influence of\nthe prevailing social biases against disability, would lead those who\nregard the termination of females this way from extending their\nobjection to the termination of other devalued kinds of people\n(Asch 1999; Asch and Geller 1996).\n",
