    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle is properly recognized as the originator of the scientific\nstudy of life. This is true despite the fact that many earlier Greek\nnatural philosophers occasionally speculated on the origins of living\nthings and much of the Hippocratic medical corpus, which was written\nbefore or during Aristotle\u2019s lifetime, displays a serious\ninterest in human anatomy, physiology and pathology. And Plato has\nTimaeus, in the eponymous dialogue, devote a considerable part of his\nspeech to the human body and its functions (and malfunctions).\nNevertheless, before Aristotle, only a few of the Hippocratic\ntreatises are both systematic and empirical, and their focus is almost\nexclusively on human health and disease.\n\nBy contrast, Aristotle considered the investigation of living things,\nand especially animals, central to the theoretical study of nature.\nConstituting roughly 25% of the extant corpus, his zoological writings\nprovide a theoretical defense of the proper method for\nbiological investigation; and they provide a record of the first\nsystematic and comprehensive study of animals. There was nothing of\nsimilar scope and sophistication again until the 16th\ncentury. In the nineteenth century the great anatomist Richard Owen\nintroduced a two lecture survey of Aristotle\u2019s zoological\nstudies by declaring that \u201cZoological Science sprang from his\n[Aristotle\u2019s] labours, we may almost say, like Minerva from the\nHead of Jove, in a state of noble and splendid maturity\u201d (Owen\n1992, 91). Before examining this remarkable achievement, a few words\nabout its creator are in\n order.[1].\n",
