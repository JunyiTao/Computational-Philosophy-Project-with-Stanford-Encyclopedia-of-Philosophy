When can a would-be time machine be held responsible for the emergence of CTCs?\n\n\nThe most obvious move is to construe \u201cresponsible for\u201d in\nthe sense of causal determinism. But in the present setting this move\nquickly runs into a dead end. For if CTCs exist to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) they are not causally determined by the state on \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) since the time travel region \\(V\\), if it is\nnon-null, lies outside the future domain of dependence \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) of \\(\\Sigma_0\\), \nthe portion of spacetime where the field equations of relativistic \nphysics uniquely determine the state of things from the state on \n \\(\\Sigma_0\\).[12]\n The point is illustrated by the toy model of \n Figure 1.\n The surface labeled \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is \ncalled the future Cauchy horizon of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). It \nis the future boundary of \n \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\),[13]\n and it separates the portion of spacetime where conditions are \ncausally determined by the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) from the \nportion where conditions are not so determined. And, as advertised, \nthe CTCs in the model of \n Figure 1\n lie beyond \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\).\n\n\nFigure 2.\nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime\n\n\n\nThus, if the operation of a Thornian time machine is to be a live \npossibility, some condition weaker than causal determinism must be \nused to capture the sense in which the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \ncan be deemed to be responsible for the subsequent development of \nCTCs. Given the failure of causal determinism, it seems the next best\nthing to demand that the region \\(V\\) is \u201cadjacent\u201d \nto the future domain of dependence \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\). Here is an initial stab \nat such an adjacency condition. Consider causal curves which have a \nfuture endpoint in the time travel region \\(V\\) and no past \nendpoint. Such a curve may never leave \\(V\\); but if it does, \nrequire that it intersects \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But this requirement \nis too strong because it rules out Thornian time machines altogether.\nFor a curve of the type in question to reach \\(\\Sigma_0\\) it \nmust intersect \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), but once \nit reaches \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) it can be \ncontinued endlessly into the past without meeting \\(\\Sigma_0\\)\nbecause the generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\)\nare past endless null geodesics that never meet \n \\(\\Sigma_0\\).[14]\n This difficulty can be overcome by weakening the requirement at issue\nby rephrasing it in terms of timelike curves rather than causal \ncurves. Now the set of candidate time machine spacetimes satisfying \nthe weakened requirement is non-empty\u2014as illustrated, once \nagain, by the spacetime of \n Figure 1.\n But the weakened requirement is too weak, as illustrated by the \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional version of Deutsch-Politzer \n spacetime[15]\n (see \n Figure 2),\n which is constructed from two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by \ndeleting the points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) and then gluing \ntogether the strips as shown. Every past endless timelike curve that \nemerges from the time travel region \\(V\\) of Deutsch-Politzer \nspacetime does meet \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But this spacetime is not a \nplausible candidate for a time machine spacetime. Up to and including\nthe time \\(\\Sigma_0\\) (which can be placed as close to \n\\(V\\) as desired) this spacetime is identical with empty \nMinkowski spacetime. If the state of the corresponding portion of \nMinkowski spacetime is not responsible for the development of \nCTCs\u2014and it certainly is not since there are no CTCs in \nMinkowski spacetime\u2014how can the state on the portion of \nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime up to and including the time \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) be held responsible for the CTCs that appear in \nthe future?\n\n\nThe deletion of the points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) means that the \nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime is singular in the sense that it is \ngeodesically \n incomplete.[16]\n It would be too drastic to require of a time-machine hosting \nspacetime that it be geodesically complete. And in any case the \noffending feature of Deutsch-Politzer can be gotten rid of by the \nfollowing trick. Multiplying the flat Lorentzian metric \n\\(\\eta_{ab}\\) of Deutsch-Politzer spacetime by a scalar\nfunction \\(j(x, t) \\gt\\) produces a new \nmetric \\(\\eta '_{ab} :=\\) j \n\\(\\eta_{ab}\\) which is conformal to the original metric \nand, thus, has exactly the same causal features as the original \nmetric. But if the conformal factor \\(j\\) is chosen to \n\u201cblow up\u201d as the missing points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) are approached, \nthe resulting spacetime is geodesically complete\u2014intuitively, \nthe singularities have been pushed off to infinity.\n\n\nA more subtle way to exclude Deutsch-Politzer spacetime focuses on \nthe generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\). The \nstipulations laid down so far for Thornian time machines imply that \nthe generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) cannot \nintersect \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But in addition it can be required \nthat these generators do not \u201cemerge from a singularity\u201d \nand do not \u201ccome from infinity,\u201d and this would suffice \nto rule out Deutsch-Politzer spacetime and its conformal cousins as \nlegitimate candidates for time machine spacetimes. More precisely, we\ncan impose what Stephen Hawking (1992a,b) calls the requirement that \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) be compactly \ngenerated; namely, the past endless null geodesics that generate\n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) must, if extended far \nenough into past, fall into and remain in a compact subset of \nspacetime. Obviously the spacetime of \n Figure 1\n fulfills Hawking\u2019s requirement\u2014since in this case \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is itself \ncompact\u2014but just as obviously the spacetime of \n Figure 2\n (conformally doctored or not) does not.\n\n\nImposing the requirement of a compactly generated future Cauchy \nhorizon has not only the negative virtue of excluding some unsuited \ncandidate time machine spacetimes but a positive virtue as well. It \nis easily proved that if \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \nis compactly generated then the condition of strong \ncausality is violated on \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), which means, \nintuitively, there are almost closed causal curves near \n \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\).[17]\n This violation can be taken as an indication that the seeds of CTCs \nhave been planted on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) and that by the time \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is reached they are ready\nto bloom.\n\n\nHowever, we still have no guarantee that if CTCs do bloom to the \nfuture of \\(\\Sigma_0\\), then the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \nis responsible for the blooming. Of course, we have already learned \nthat we cannot have the iron clad guarantee of causal determinism \nthat the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for the actual \nblooming in all of its particularity. But we might hope for a \nguarantee that the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for \nthe blooming of some CTCs\u2014the actual ones or others. \nThe difference takes a bit of explaining. The failure of causal \ndeterminism is aptly pictured by the image of a future \n\u201cbranching\u201d of world histories, with the different \nbranches representing different alternative possible futures of (the \ndomain of dependence of) \\(\\Sigma_0\\) that are compatible with\nthe actual past and the laws of physics. And so it is in the present \nsetting: if \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0) \\ne \\varnothing\\), then there will \ngenerally be different ways to extend \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), all compatible with the \nlaws of general relativistic physics. But if CTCs are present in all \nof these extensions, even through the details of the CTCs may vary \nfrom one extension to another, then the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \ncan rightly be deemed to be responsible for the fact that \nsubsequently CTCs did develop.\n\n\nA theorem due to Krasnikov (2002, 2003 [Other Internet Resources],\n2014a) might seem to demonstrate that no relativistic spacetime can\ncount as embodying a Thornian time machine so understood. Following\nKrasnikov, let us say that a spacetime condition \\(C\\)\nis local just in case, for any open covering\n\\(\\{V_{\\alpha}\\}\\) of an arbitrary spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab}),\nC\\) holds in \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) iff it holds in \\((V_{\\alpha},\ng_{ab}|_{V_{\\alpha}})\\) for all \\(\\alpha\\). Examples of local\nconditions one might want to impose on physically reasonable\nspacetimes are Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations and\nso-called energy conditions that restrict the form of the\nstress-energy tensor \\(T_{ab}\\). An example of the latter that will\ncome into play below is the weak energy condition that says\nthat the energy density is non-negative.[18] Einstein\u2019s field equations (sans\ncosmological constant) require that \\(T_{ab}\\) is proportional to the\nEinstein tensor which is a functional of the metric and its\nderivatives. Call a \\(C\\)-spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\) a\n\\(C\\)-extension of a \\(C\\)-spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) spacetime if the latter is isometric to an open proper\nsubset of the former; and call \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\nC\\)-extensible if it admits a \\(C\\)-extension and\n\\(C\\)-maximal otherwise. (Of course, \\(C\\) might be the empty\ncondition.) Krasnikov\u2019s theorem shows that every \\(C\\)-spacetime\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) admits a \\(C\\)-maximal extension\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^{max}, g^{max}_{ab})\\) such that all CTCs in\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^{max}, g^{max}_{ab})\\) are to the chronological past of\nthe image of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) in \\((\\mathcal{M}^{max},\ng^{max}_{ab})\\). So start with some candidate spacetime\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) for a Thornian time machine, and apply the\ntheorem to \\((D^+ (\\Sigma_0), g_{ab}|_{D^+ (\\Sigma_0)})\\).  Conclude\nthat no matter what local conditions the candidate spacetime is\nrequired to satisfy, \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) has extensions that also\nsatisfies said local conditions but does not contain CTCs to the\nfuture of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). Thus, the candidate spacetime fails to exhibit\nthe crucial feature identified above necessary for underwriting the\ncontention that the conditions on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) are responsible for the\ndevelopment of CTCs.  Hence, it appears as if Krasnikov\u2019s\ntheorem effectively prohibits time machines. \n\n\nThe would-be time machine operator need not capitulate in the face of\nKrasnikov\u2019s theorem. Recall that the main difficulty in\nspecifying the conditions for the successful operation of Thornian\ntime machines traces to the fact that the standard form of causal\ndeterminism does not apply to the production of CTCs. But causal\ndeterminism can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with CTCs or\nother acausal features of relativistic spacetimes, and it seems only\nfair to ensure that these modes of failure have been removed before\nproceeding to discuss the prospects for time machines. To zero in on\nthe modes of failure at issue, consider vacuum solutions \\((T_{ab}\n\\equiv 0)\\) to Einstein\u2019s field equations. Let \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\) be two such solutions, and\nlet \\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) and \\(\\Sigma ' \\subset\n\\mathcal{M}'\\) be spacelike hypersurfaces of their respective\nspacetimes. Suppose that there is an isometry \\(\\Psi\\) from some\nneighborhood \\(N(\\Sigma)\\) of \\(\\Sigma\\) onto a neighborhood\n\\(N'(\\Sigma ')\\) of \\(\\Sigma '\\).  Does it follow, as we would want\ndeterminism to guarantee, that \\(\\Psi\\) is extendible to an isometry\nfrom \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\) onto \\(D^+ (\\Sigma ')\\)? To see why the answer\nis negative, start with any solution \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) of the\nvacuum Einstein equations, and cut out a closed set of points lying to\nthe future of \\(N(\\Sigma)\\) and in \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\).  Denote the\nsurgically altered manifold by \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and the restriction\nof \\(g_{ab}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) by \\(g^*_{ab}\\). Then\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^*, g^*_{ab})\\) is also a solution of the vacuum\nEinstein equations. But obviously the pair of solutions\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}^*, g^*_{ab})\\) violates\nthe condition that determinism was supposed to guarantee as \\(\\Psi\\)\nis not extendible to an isometry from \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\) onto \\(D^+\n(\\Sigma^*)\\). It might seem that the requirement, contemplated above,\nthat the spacetimes under consideration be maximal, already rules out\nspacetimes that have \u201choles\u201d in them. But while maximality\ndoes rule out the surgically mutilated spacetime just constructed, it\ndoes not guarantee hole freeness in the sense needed to make sure that\ndeterminism does not stumble before it gets to the starting gate.\nThat \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) is hole free in the relevant sense\nrequires that if \\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) is a spacelike\nhypersurface, there does not exist a spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}',\ng'_{ab})\\) and an isometric embedding \\(\\Phi\\) of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\)\ninto \\(\\mathcal{M}'\\) such that \\(\\Phi(D^+ (\\Sigma))\\) is a proper\nsubset of \\(D^+ (\\Phi(\\Sigma))\\). A theorem due to Robert Geroch\n(1977, 87), who is responsible for this definition, asserts that if\n\\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) and \\(\\Sigma ' \\subset \\mathcal{M}'\\)\nare spacelike hypersurfaces in hole-free spacetimes \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\), respectively, and if there\nexists an isometry \\(\\Psi : \\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}'\\),\nthen \\(\\Psi\\) is indeed extendible to an isometry between \\(D^+\n(\\Sigma)\\) and \\(D^+ (\\Sigma ')\\). Thus, hole freeness precludes an\nimportant mode of failure of determinism which we wish to exclude in\nour discussion of time machines. It can be shown that hole freeness is\nnot entailed by maximality.[19] And it is just this gap that gives the\nwould-be time machine operator some hope, for the maximal CTC-free\nextensions produced by Krasnikov\u2019s construction are not always\nhole free (Manchak 2009b). But Krasnikov (2009) has shown that the\nGeroch (1977) definition is too strong: Minkowski spacetime fails to\nsatisfy it! For this reason, alternative formulations of the\nhole-freeness definition have been constructed which are more\nappropriate (Manchak 2009a, Minguzzi 2012).\n\n\n\nThus, we propose that one clear sense of what it would mean for a\nThornian time machine to operate in the setting of general relativity\ntheory is given by the following assertion: the laws of general\nrelativistic physics allow solutions containing a partial Cauchy\nsurface \\(\\Sigma_0\\) such that no CTCs lie to the past of\n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) but every extension of\n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) satisfying ________\ncontains CTCs (where the blank is filled with some \u201cno\nhole\u201d condition). Correspondingly, a proof of the physical\nimpossibility of time machines would take the form of showing that\nthis assertion is false for the actual laws of physics, consisting,\npresumably, of Einstein\u2019s field equations plus energy conditions and,\nperhaps, some additional restrictions as well. And a proof of the\nemptiness of the associated concept of a Thornian time machine would\ntake the form of showing that the assertion is false independently of\nthe details of the laws of physics, as long as they take the form of\nlocal conditions on \\(T_{ab}\\) and \\(g_{ab}\\).\n\n\nAre there \"no hole\" conditions which show the proposed concept of a time machine is not empty? Let \\(J^+(p)\\) designate the causal future of \\(p\\), defined as the set of all points in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) which can be reached from \\(p\\) by a future-directed causal curve in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The causal past \\(J^-(p)\\) is defined analogously. Now, we say a spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) is J closed if, for each \\(p\\) in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), the sets \\(J^+(p)\\) and \\(J^-(p)\\) are topologically closed. One can verify that J closedness fails in many artificially mutilated examples (e.g. Minkowski spacetime with one point removed from the manifold). For some time, it was thought that a time machine existed under this no-hole condition (Manchak 2011a). But this turns out to be incorrect; indeed a recent result shows that any J closed spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) of three dimensions or more with chronology violating region \\(V \\neq \\mathcal{M}\\) must be strongly causal and therefore fail to have CTCs (Hounnonkpe and Minguzzi 2019). Stepping back, perhaps there are other no-hole conditions which can be used instead to show that the proposed concept of a time machine is not empty. But even if such a project were successful, Manchak (2014a, 2019) has shown that the time machine existence results can be\nnaturally reinterpreted as \u201chole machine\u201d existence results if one is so inclined. Instead of assuming that spacetime is\nfree of holes and then showing that certain initial conditions are\nresponsible for the production of CTCs, one could just as well start\nwith the assumption of no CTCs and then show that certain initial\nconditions are responsible for the production of holes. Given the\nimportance of these no hole assumptions to the time machine advocate,\nmuch recent work has focused on whether such assumptions are\nphysically reasonable in some sense (Manchak 2011b,\n2014b). This is still an open question.\n\n\nAnother open question is whether physically more realistic spacetimes\nthan Misner also permit the operation of time machines and how generic\ntime-machine spacetimes are in particular spacetime theories, such as\ngeneral relativity. If time-machine spacetimes turn out to be highly\nnon-generic, the fan of time machines can retreat to a weaker concept\nof Thornian time machine by taking a page from probabilistic accounts\nof causation, the idea being that a time machine can be seen to be at\nwork if its operation increases the probability of the appearance of\nCTCs. Since general relativity theory itself is innocent of\nprobabilities, they have to be introduced by hand, either by inserting\nthem into the models of the theory, i.e., by modifying the theory at\nthe level of the object-language, or by defining measures on sets of\nmodels, i.e., by modifying the theory at the level of the\nmeta-language. Since the former would change the character of the\ntheory, only the latter will be considered. The project for making\nsense of the notion that a time machine as a probabilistic cause of\nthe appearance of CTCs would then take the following form. First\ndefine a normalized measure on the set of models having a partial\nCauchy surface to the past of which there are no CTCs. Then show that\nthe subset of models that have CTCs to the future of the partial\nCauchy surface has non-zero measure. Next, identify a range of\nconditions on or near the partial Cauchy surface that are naturally\nconstrued as settings of a device that is a would-be probabilistic\ncause of CTCs, and show that the subset of models satisfying these\nconditions has non-zero measure. Finally, show that conditionalizing\non the latter subset increases the measure of the former\nsubset. Assuming that this formal exercise can be successfully carried\nout, there remains the task of justifying these as measures of\nobjective chance. This task is especially daunting in the cosmological\nsetting since neither of the leading interpretations of objective\nchance seems applicable. The frequency interpretation is strained\nsince the development of CTCs may be a non-repeated phenomenon; and\nthe propensity interpretation is equally strained since, barring\njust-so stories about the Creator throwing darts at the Cosmic Dart\nBoard, there is no chance mechanism for producing cosmological\nmodels.\n\n\nWe conclude that, even apart from general doubts about a \nprobabilistic account of causation, the resort to a probabilistic \nconception of time machines is a desperate stretch, at least in the \ncontext of classical general relativity theory. In a quantum theory \nof gravity, a probabilistic conception of time machines may be \nappropriate if the theory itself provides the transition \nprobabilities between the relevant states. But an evaluation of this \nprospect must wait until the theory of quantum gravity is available.\n",
