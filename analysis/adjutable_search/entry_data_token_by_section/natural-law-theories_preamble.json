    "main_text": "\n\n\nThis entry considers natural law theories only as theories of\nlaw. That is not to say that legal theory can be adequately identified\nand pursued independently of moral and political theory. Nor is it to\ndeny that there are worthwhile natural law theories much more\nconcerned with foundational issues in ethics and political theory than\nwith law or legal theory. A sample of such wider and more foundational\ntheories is the entry \n  Aquinas\u2019 moral, political, and legal philosophy.\nIn the present entry, \u201cnatural law theory\u201d\nis to be taken as shorthand for natural law theories just insofar as\nthey bear on law and are theories of or about it. This focus has the\nimportant incidental effect that many historically important\ndifferences between natural law theorists can be omitted, differences\nwhich pertain more to the foundations of normativity than to the\nnature and functions (\u201cthe concept\u201d) of positive\nlaw.\n\n\nLegal theorists who present or understand their theories as\n\u201cpositivist\u201d, or as instances of \u201clegal\npositivism\u201d, take their theories to be opposed to, or at least\nclearly distinct from, natural law theory. Natural law theorists, on\nthe other hand, did not conceive their theories in opposition to, or\neven as distinct from, legal positivism (contra Soper 1992 at\n2395). The term \u201cpositive law\u201d was put into wide\nphilosophical circulation first by Aquinas, and natural law theories\nof his kind share, or at least make no effort to deny, many or virtually\nall \u201cpositivist\u201d theses\u2014except of course the bare\nthesis that natural law theories are mistaken, or the thesis that a norm is the content of an act of will. Natural law theory\naccepts that law can be considered and spoken of both as a\nsheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of\nreasons for action that can be and often are sound as reasons and\ntherefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them. This dual\ncharacter of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan\n\u201cUnjust laws are not laws.\u201d Properly understood, that\nslogan indicates why\u2014unless based upon some skeptical denial\nthat there are any sound reasons for action (a denial which can be set\naside because defending it is self-refuting)\u2014positivist\nopposition to natural law theories is pointless, that is redundant:\nwhat positivists characteristically see as realities to be affirmed\nare already affirmed by natural law theory, and what they\ncharacteristically see as illusions to be dispelled are no part of\nnatural law theory. But because legal theories conceived of by their\nauthors as positivist are, by and large, dominant in the milieux of\nthose likely to be reading this entry, it seems appropriate to refer\nto those theories along the way, in the hope of overcoming\nmisunderstandings that (while stimulating certain clarifications and\nimprovements of natural law theorizing) have generated some needless\ndebate.\n\n\nThe point made in the preceding paragraph is made in another way by\nOrrego (Orrego 2007). When the accounts of adjudication and\njudicial reasoning proposed by contemporary mainstream legal theories\nare added to those theories\u2019 accounts of (the concept of) law, it\nbecomes clear that, at the level of propositions (as distinct from\nnames, words and formulations), those theories share (though not\nalways without self-contradiction) the principal theses about law\nwhich are proposed by classic natural law theorists such as Aquinas:\n(i) that law establishes reasons for action, (ii) that its rules can\nand presumptively (defeasibly) do create moral obligations that did\nnot as such exist prior to the positing of the rules, (iii) that that\nkind of legal-moral obligation is defeated by a posited rule\u2019s serious\nimmorality (injustice), and (iv) that judicial and other\nparadigmatically legal deliberation, reasoning and judgment includes,\nconcurrently, both natural (moral) law and (purely) positive\nlaw. Orrego\u2019s point seems to be confirmed by, e.g., the adjacent entry\non Legal Positivism (Green and Adams 2019).  Contemporary\n\u201cpositivist\u201d theories are, it seems, natural law theories,\ndistinguished from the main body of natural law theory (a) by their\ndenial that the theory of law (as distinct from the theory or\ntheories of adjudication, judicial duty, citizens\u2019 allegiance, etc.)\nnecessarily or most appropriately tackles the related matters just\nlisted, and accordingly (b) by the incompleteness of their theories of\nlaw, that is, the absence from them (and usually, though not always,\nfrom their accounts of those related matters) of systematic critical\nattention to the foundations of the moral and other normative claims\nthat they make or presuppose.\n\n\nIn short: a natural law theory of (the nature of) law seeks both to\ngive an account of the facticity of law and to answer questions that\nremain central to understanding law. As listed by Green 2019 (having\nobserved that \u201cNo legal philosopher can be only a legal\npositivist\u201d), these further questions (which \u201clegal positivism\ndoes not aspire to answer\u201d) are: What kinds of things could\npossibly count as the merits of law? What role should law play in\nadjudication?  What claim has law on our obedience?  What laws should\nwe have?  And should we have law at all?  All these questions, though\norganized and articulated a little differently, are under\nconsideration in the present entry.\n",
