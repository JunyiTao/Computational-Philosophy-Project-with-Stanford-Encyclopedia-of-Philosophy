    "main_text": "Needs and Capabilities\n6. Needs and Capabilities\n\n\nNeeds have long played a role as guides to public policy, not only\ndomestically but also internationally, where the so-called Basic Needs\nApproach to global poverty and international development became\ndominant in the 1970s and early 1980s. More recently, however, it has\nbeen displaced by the \u2018capabilities approach\u2019 developed\nespecially by Amartya Sen and implemented in policy instruments such\nas the UN\u2019s Human Development Index. Sen (1984) argued that the\nbasic needs approach was too narrow for these purposes, as well as\nbeing defective for a number of other reasons, and should therefore be\nsubsumed within his capabilities approach. In this section we review\nthe arguments for and against replacing needs with capabilities as a\ntool of policy evaluation (see also Reader 2006). For a much fuller\ndiscussion of capabilities themselves,\n see the entry on\n the capability approach.\n \n\n\nThe capability approach provides a way of measuring a person\u2019s\nlevel of well-being. It combines two elements:\n\u2018functionings\u2019, that is the various activities that a\nperson performs or states that they achieve, and\n\u2018capabilities\u2019, that is the option of realizing\nfunctionings if one so chooses. Thus \u2018being adequately\nnourished\u2019 and \u2018working as a computer programmer\u2019\nare examples of functionings, whereas \u2018having the choice to be\nadequately nourished\u2019 and \u2018having the option to work as a\ncomputer programmer\u2019 are examples of capabilities. The approach\nplaces most emphasis on capabilities out of a concern for freedom of\nchoice. A concern for functionings alone, it is argued, might justify\nforcing people to behave in certain ways (eat healthy food, for\nexample). A person\u2019s well-being is then measured by the size of\nher capability set: the more capabilities she has, the better off she\nis judged to be.\n\n\nAs will immediately be clear, capabilities capture many more aspects\nof human well-being than do needs, and this is claimed to be an\nadvantage of the approach. But it comes with a corresponding\ndisadvantage, namely that capabilities lack the normative force that\nneeds possess. Some capabilities (like the option of being adequately\nnourished) are morally important, while others (like the option to buy\na fancy sports car) are trivial. So whereas a person\u2019s being in\nneed always counts as a strong pro tanto reason to aid them,\na person\u2019s lacking a capability may be of no moral concern at\nall.\n\n\nIn response to this problem, Sen has introduced the idea of\n\u2018basic capabilities\u2019, understood as \u2018the ability to\nsatisfy certain elementary and crucially important functionings up to\ncertain levels\u2019 (Sen 1992, 45), for use in definitions of global\npoverty. In this case the basic needs approach and the capabilities\napproach will converge, since identifying these \u2018crucially\nimportant functionings\u2019 will involve the same exercise as\nidentifying universal human needs, namely establishing what is\nnecessary for human beings to enjoy a minimally decent life.  It is a\nmistake, therefore, to imagine that by switching from needs to\ncapabilities one can avoid the difficult semi-empirical task of\nestablishing what conditions are essential to human beings if they are\nto avoid being harmed.\n\n\nCapability theorists, including Sen, have levelled a number of\ncriticisms against the basic needs approach. One is that the approach\nis excessively commodity-focused. However, this criticism does not\nseem to be appropriate if we look at either the original or subsequent\ndefenders of needs as a policy tool for international development\n(though perhaps the complaint has more traction if targeted at the\nimplementation priorities of the time). The original defenders often\nincluded non-material needs, such as employment (Streeten 1981;\nStewart 1985). More generally, there is no reason to assume that only\ncommodities are relevant need satisfiers, and this is obvious when we\nlook at how needs theorists develop their accounts (see further Reader\n2006). Consider Braybrooke (1987) as one prominent example: his list\nincludes such important items as the need for a life-supporting\nrelation to the environment, for social acceptance and recognition,\nfor freedom from harassment, and for companionship. Indeed, reflecting\non the whole list, we notice that while commodities might be relevant\nto satisfying some of these needs, they are not relevant to (or only a\nvery small part of) fulfilling most of the items on his list.\n\n\nA second charge levelled by Sen is that \u2018a concentration on just\nthe minimum requirements may lead to a softening of the opposition to\ninequality in general\u2019 (Sen 1984, 515). This draws attention to\nthe fact that needs define a standard of sufficiency (see Frankfurt\n2015) and cannot be appealed to directly to determine how any\navailable surplus resources above that line should be allocated.\nHowever the point should not be overstated. In today\u2019s world,\nreducing inequality by redistribution from rich to poor may be a\nnecessary precondition for meeting everyone\u2019s basic needs.\nMoreover if we widen the focus to consider needs that arise in\nparticular societies, we will often find that needs and inequality\ninteract, since what is essential for a minimally decent life will\ndepend in part on the general standard of living in the society in\nquestion. It is for this reason that poverty is often defined in\nrelative terms, as having an income below a certain percentage of the\nsocial median.\n\n\nFinally, the most prominent claim made on behalf of the capability\napproach is that, unlike a needs-based approach, it puts front and\ncenter the values of choice and participation (Alkire 2002 and\n2005). There are several responses available to this objection. First,\nthe charge assumes that the recipients of needs-meeting policy will\nnot have their choices respected and, more generally, will not\nparticipate in activities aimed at meeting their needs. However we\nmight think that providing options for enabling people to meet their\nneeds, while leaving final choices to them as to whether they avail\nthemselves of those options, is all that plausible needs-directed\npolicy requires. There is plenty of scope for respecting choices \nconsistently with providing such options. Second, capability\ntheorists can be accused of a kind of \u201cfreedom fetishism\u201d\nby overstating the importance of freedom of choice in many cases. Here\nwe might draw attention to the important problem of adaptive\npreferences which might lead people to fail to seize opportunities\nthat would otherwise allow them to meet their needs. In these\ncircumstances, less weight should be attached to people\u2019s\nchoices or their expressed views about these choices. Indeed\ncapability theorists themselves recognize the force of this point\ninsofar as they include achieved functionings alongside capabilities\nin their overall metric of personal well-being. In some cases it is\nthe functioning itself, rather than the capability, that matters: if\nour task is to supply drinkable water to a village that up to now has\nlacked it, there is no reason to leave the old polluted well open so\nthat the villagers have the capacity to choose between clean and\nunclean water. Providing clean water is all that should concern\nus.\n",
