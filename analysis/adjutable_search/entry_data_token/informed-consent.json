The requirement of informed consent\n\nIn English, \u201cconsent\u201d has several meanings. In the\nrelevant sense, consent transactions have a distinct structure: agent\nA consents to B\u2019s \u03c6\u00ad-ing on\nA, under a certain description of \u03c6\u00ad-ing,\nwhether or not the offer was initiated by B. For example, a\nman may consent to a physician\u2019s touching the man\u2019s\ntesticles as part of a testicular cancer exam upon the\nphysician\u2019s suggestion (compare Kleinig 2010, 6\u20137).\n\nInformed consent is shorthand for informed, voluntary, and\n decisionally-capacitated\n consent. Consent is considered fully informed when a capacitated (or\n\u201ccompetent\u201d) patient or research participant to whom full\ndisclosures have been made and who understands fully all that has been\ndisclosed consents voluntarily to treatment or participation on this\nbasis.\n\nIn its most important role in bioethics, informed consent is a\nlegitimacy requirement for certain actions. Inadequately informed\nconsent makes certain intrusions impermissible. Roughly, when a\nsufficiently capacitated adult does not give sufficiently informed and\nvoluntary consent to intervention in her body or her private sphere,\nthen, at least when the intervention is substantial, not trivial, and\nabsent severe jeopardy for third parties, the intervention is\nimpermissible\u2014even when it seeks to assist her, physicians\nrecommend it, third parties would benefit from it, and the patient\nherself had repeatedly consented to it before expressing a change of\nmind. When the antecedent is inapplicable\u2014for instance, when the\npatient lacks decision-making capacity\u2014similarly spirited rules\napply, such as rules delegating consent \u201cauthority\u201d to the\npatient\u2019s\n advance directive\n or proxy.\n\nWhile consent and informed consent are relevant to medical torts, to\ndistributive and proprietary medical claims, and to ideal (as opposed\nto merely legitimate) doctor-patient relationships, this entry focuses\non informed consent in its central role as a legitimacy requirement\nfor medical intervention. Contemporary medical culture and central\nhuman rights documents support something like this requirement. In the\nU.S., where regulatory commitment to informed consent is especially\nstrong, federal funding for research usually requires review of\ninformed consent procedures, and the constitutional right to privacy\nbinds government to honor patients\u2019 refusal of care. Lack of\ninformed consent can be used to establish negligence (and hence\nmalpractice and torts), or battery and assault.\n\nSince the 1970s, extensive bioethics writing focuses on how to define\nand achieve \u201cvalid\u201d consent\u2014sufficiently\ncapacitated, informed, and voluntary consent\u2014and the conditions,\nespecially in medical research, have become increasingly demanding.\nThe contrast between these post-informed consent expectations and an\nearlier medical ethos is vivid in an excerpt of the Hippocratic Oath\n(fifth century B.C.E.): \u201cConceal most things from the\npatient\u2026 Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and\nserenity\u2026 revealing nothing of the patient\u2019s future or\npresent condition.\u201d Present-day physicians like to think that\nthey treat their patients differently.\n\nSection 2 discusses the potential justifications for the requirement\nof informed consent. Sections 3\u20135 delineate its content with\ngreater detail. Sections 6\u20137 note potential waivers and\nexceptions to the requirement. Sections 8\u20139 review its status\nand its relations to consent requirements in other normative fields.\nSection 10 concludes.\n2. Why informed consent?\n\nPlato attacks political democracy by drawing an analogy to the medical\narena: \u201cWhen a man is ill\u2026 to the physician he must go,\nand he who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern\u201d\n(Plato Republic, VI 489B\u2013C, 180). Nowadays it is common\nto reject both Plato\u2019s anti-democratic politics and his medical\nethics. A central defense of political democracy against Plato\u2019s\nattack rests on the\n Condorcet jury theorem,\n which underwrites the \u201cwisdom of the masses.\u201d But why\nreject Plato\u2019s medical ethics? In the medical arena there are no\nmasses, and yet the informed consent requirement gives a single\nnon-expert\u2014the patient or the research participant\u2014veto\npower over some interventions, even against the will of many expert\nphysicians. Why not take Plato\u2019s, or\nHippocrates\u2019s, approach in the medical arena? Why require\ninformed consent, disallowing even a mass of medical experts to make\nthe final decision on matters that fall within their fields of\nexpertise\u2014medical treatment and medical investigation? The main\narguments for informed consent revolve around:\n\n\nprotection,\nautonomy,\nprevention of abusive conduct,\ntrust,\nself-ownership,\nnon-domination, and\npersonal integrity.\n\n\n2.1 Protection\n\nThe simplest rationale for the informed consent requirement is that it\nprotects study participants\u2019 and patients\u2019 health and\nwelfare. It protects participants from investigators\u2019\noverzealous attempts to promote science and personal careers, even on\nparticipants\u2019 backs, and it also protects regular patients from\nneglectful clinicians or from overconfident, but often wrong,\n paternalistic\n ones. While many moral doctrines oppose harming study participants or\npatients, bioethicists\u2019 expositions of this instrumental\nrationale typically echo utilitarian philosopher\n John Stuart Mill,\n for whom \u201cOver himself, over his own body and mind, the\nindividual is sovereign\u201d (Mill 1990, 135; see also ch. 3). They\nexplain that patients and research participants are typically the best\njudges of their own good and mind it far more than the doctor does,\neven when the doctor is convinced that he or she acts in their best\ninterests (compare Mill 1990, e.g. 215). They add that doctors\u2019\ntraining scarcely prepares them to know patients\u2019 distinctive\nnon-medical interests.\n\nHowever, insofar as the goal is to protect patients and trial\nparticipants from harm, why honor informed consent requirements when\nmany physicians and patients\u2014a Condorcet\n\u201cjury\u201d\u2014are fairly certain that a particular patient\nor participant is not making a decision that furthers her own medical\ninterests? In clinical care, for example, patients\u2019 biases and\nignorance about medicine arguably tend to exceed those of physicians;\nsometimes, patients refuse interventions that everyone\nconsiders best for them\u2014even family, friends, and these patients\nthemselves, before a change of heart. In the future, patients may\nrefuse interventions that highly-reliable algorithms predict patients\nlike them to be glad to have undergone. Indeed, some patients\nknowingly jeopardize their own health in the name of religious or\nmoral commitments. This being the case, why is it important\u2014as\nit seems to many of us and as is enshrined in law\u2014to honor the\nrequirement of informed consent? For example, why honor the\nrequirement when a fully capacitated Jehovah\u2019s Witness refuses a\nblood transfusion on religious grounds? Why honor it when health is\nnot at stake, for example, in experiments on stored tissue? Finally,\nspecifically from a utilitarian standpoint, why honor the requirement\non occasions when it seems to set back collective health, for example,\nwhen we cannot develop a new drug that would help many, because no one\nis altruistic enough to consent to participate in its risky study?\n2.2 Autonomy\n\nThe 1970s saw the ascent of a second rationale,\n autonomy,\n as the predominant justification of informed consent, through\ninfluential work by Ruth Faden, Tom Beauchamp, James Childress, and a\nU.S. President\u2019s Commission (Faden and Beauchamp 1986, 8;\nNational Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical\nand Behavioral Research 1979, section b (1), 282\u20133; Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, ch. 4; Beauchamp 2010; see also President\u2019s\nCommission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and\nBiomedical and Behavioral Research 1982, 27; Feinberg 1986; Dworkin\n1988, 111, 113; Buchanan and Brock 1989, 36ff.; Brock 1994,\n31\u20132).\n\nPhilosophers of action usually understand autonomy as governance over\none\u2019s own agency\u2014acting according to a law that one sets\nfor oneself. Likewise, for bioethicists Beauchamp and Childress,\n\u201cThe autonomous individual acts freely in accordance with a\nself-chosen plan, analogous to the way an independent government\nmanages its territories and establishes its policies\u201d (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 99\u2013100). As the authors emphasize (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 100\u20131), autonomy so understood differs from\nautonomy as having the will that one wants to have (Frankfurt 1988).\nIt also differs from many other uses of \u201cautonomy\u201d in\nbioethics and biolaw (Dworkin 1988, 101ff.)\u2014so many as to prompt\nsome to question the force of autonomy-based justifications\n(O\u2019Neill 2003). However, initially, autonomy seems like a\npromising ground for informed consent requirements. The rationale for\nnot transfusing a protesting, decisionally-capacitated Jehovah\u2019s\nWitness even when forced transfusion would save the witness\u2019s\nlife is clearly not protection of her health. Instead, it may seem to\ndo with maintaining her self-rule on such momentous issues: a matter\nof respect for an autonomous decision maker\u2019s refusal. And fully\ninformed consent usually assumes freedom from controlling interference\nand from an inadequate understanding of the basic risks of the\nintervention, components of fully autonomous choice as well (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 100\u20131).\n\nWhile occasionally, the need for autonomous authorization of medical\nintervention is considered \u201caxiomatic\u201d (Beauchamp 2010,\n58), it is commonplace to defend autonomy on independent grounds. A\ncomplete autonomy-based justification for the informed consent\nrequirement would explain both why personal autonomy, under a\nplausible explication, matters\u2014why it has high value or status,\nat least in the health arena; and how honoring the informed consent\nrequirement engages with its value or status correctly.\n\nSome attempt to justify autonomy on merely instrumental grounds,\nsuggesting, for example, that concordance between our care and our\nvalues is often key to our continued satisfaction and cooperation with\nassigned medical teams. Others add that autonomy is inherently good\nfor us. First, self-rule is central to a good life, perhaps because it\nmakes us less self-alienated and more worthy of praise for our\nvirtuous decisions. Second, autonomous choices promote our ultimate\ngoals, on the non-controversial assumption that medicine affects\nnon-technical and controversial matters of value and faith on which\nphysicians are not experts (say, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019s\nfaith), and the controversial assumption that these goals define how\nwell our lives go (President\u2019s Commission for the Study of\nEthical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research\n1982; Dworkin 1988, 113).\n\nHowever, these links between informed consent, autonomy, and the good\nlife are more tenuous than informed consent requirements are usually\nassumed to be. In the Jehovah\u2019s Witness case, any medical good\nthat might come from promoting the patient\u2019s future cooperation\nwith assigned medical teams is irrelevant once refusal to accept\ntransfusion makes the patient\u2019s future life an impossibility. In\naddition, according to the beliefs of some Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses,\nwhat their religion says is that they must refuse transfusion, not\nthat undergoing forced transfusion would land them in hell or breach\ntheir personal integrity. To impose transfusion on Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses of that particular persuasion might not blight their lives,\nyet it remains a clear breach of informed consent requirements.\n\nFully autonomous decision-making seems to be bad for us sometimes in\nat least certain respects, say, when it involves tortuous\ndeliberations, makes us more accountable for embarrassing mistakes, or\ninvites social pressure to make certain choices (Dworkin 1988, ch. 5).\nThe cost of ensuring that a single decision is absolutely autonomous\nmay be a severe, permanent, or fatal health problem. This health\nproblem will usually affect well-being more than a small marginal\ndecrease of autonomy would\u2014yet some informed consent\nrequirements apply. Indeed, on no theory of\n well-being\u2014neither\n desire satisfaction, hedonic state, nor objective list\u2014does it\nseem to follow that either informed consent or autonomous choice\ninvariably makes a patient\u2019s life better (Buchanan and Brock\n1989, ch. 1 \u00a74, esp. p. 40). And if they did, then it would be\nabsurd to claim, as proponents of the autonomy rationale do (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, e.g. pp. 12, 14), that informed consent and the\nprinciple of autonomy are distinct from, sometimes conflict with, and\noften supersede, the principle of beneficence.\n\nA different version of the autonomy rationale states, in the spirit of\n Immanuel Kant\u2019s\n ethics, that autonomy should command our awe and reverence, whether\nor not it is good for us (Hill 1991, 43). The literature on informed\nconsent regularly cites Kant\u2019s Formula of Humanity (Kant 1996,\n80 [4:429]) to establish that duties of\n respect\n for autonomy bind physicians (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 63, 103;\nDworkin 1988, 110; Levine 1988, 96\u20137; Pellegrino and Thomasma\n1993, 128). Alan Donagan\u2019s defense of the requirement of\ninformed consent illustrates this Kantian approach: \u201cRecognition\nof every human being as having a unique dignity as human, and as\ntherefore being an end in every relation in which others may morally\nstand to him, entails that no human being may legitimately be\ninterfered with in pursuing his conception of his happiness in\nwhatever way seems best to him\u201d (Donagan 1977, 31).\n\nThis version of the autonomy rationale is criticizeable as well. Kant\nassociated respect for persons with treating them only in ways that\nthey could possibly or rationally consent to, not with treating them\nin ways that they have actually consented to\u2014rationally,\nvoluntarily, or otherwise (Wertheimer 2014, 149). The notion of\nautonomy as bioethicists understand it hardly resembles Kant\u2019s\nnotion of autonomy (O\u2019Neill 2003). And while some contemporary\nKantians interpret autonomy as \u201cour authority to determine our\nown actions\u201d (Buss 2016), many gross violations of informed\nconsent do not directly transgress that alleged authority. A surgeon\nwho exploits a patient\u2019s surgical anesthesia to force an\nexperimental intervention grossly violates informed consent by\naffecting heavily the incognizant patient\u2019s body and life, but\nless directly if at all by thwarting the patient\u2019s determination\nof what actions to perform. During the violation, the anesthetized\npatient was not performing any action. Likewise, informed consent\nfinds some interventions far more reprehensible than others, although\ntheir impacts on our autonomous action and pursuits are similar.\nPerforming a testicular cancer exam without the patient\u2019s\ninformed consent is very problematic, and transgresses core informed\nconsent requirements. It is far harder to justify than looking\ncarefully at a skin mole on a patient\u2019s cheek from across a\nclinic desk, in order to detect cancer, without the patient\u2019s\ninformed consent. Non-consensual facial scrutiny might not even\nviolate informed consent. The main difference seems to be in whether a\nsensitive area of the patient\u2019s body is being touched and\nscrutinized without the patient\u2019s consent, which can constitute\nextreme battery; and not in the patient\u2019s exercise of agency,\nsay, in the number or nature of the patient\u2019s actions and plans\nthat are thereby blocked. It may be true that extreme battery\nsymbolizes extreme contempt towards the patient as a sovereign agent,\nbut here, at least, it does not involve greater interference with his\nautonomy as characterized above.\n\nRegardless of either the exact meaning of autonomy or the extent to\nwhich autonomy is good for us, grounding informed consent in autonomy\nturns out to be difficult. First, autonomous decision making over\nall matters that heavily affect one\u2019s health is not\nsomething to which any patient has a right. Organ waitlists, for\ninstance, can be perfectly legitimate even when some patients demand\nin full voluntariness the next available organ and autonomously refuse\nto wait in line. Just because receiving the organ would serve their\nautonomous wills does not make it their right to obtain organs\ndesignated to others ahead of them on the list without interference.\nAdmittedly, the autonomy rationale may here be conjoined with a\nclarification as to which matters concerning patients\u2019 health\nthey have a right to determine. But for some that right would then be\nthe reason why their consent is required, when it is required\n(McConnell 2018), potentially making any further reference to autonomy\nredundant.\n\nA second challenge to grounding informed consent requirements in\nautonomy is that violating informed consent requirements can have\npositive impact on autonomy. One example is when closing off an\noption, in violation of informed consent, enables more important\nfreedoms. For instance, closing off patients\u2019 options for\nvoluntary euthanasia was said to increase their autonomy by freeing\nthem, as well as similar patients, from family pressure to use that\noption (Velleman 1992); surely it may do so even when accomplished\nthrough forced injection of an antidote or other violations of\ninformed consent.\n\nA third challenge is that not all acts that are generally assumed to\nviolate informed consent seem contrary to autonomous decision-making.\nSuppose that a sufficiently capacitated adult patient refuses a safe,\nbeneficial, and time-sensitive surgery to prevent a moderate\ndisability, due to a simple misunderstanding of medical facts. There\nis no time to convince him of his mistake. Being uninformed, his\ndecision cannot count as autonomous. But present medical practices\nsurrounding informed consent continue to forbid, possibly for good\nreasons, forcing care on such a patient\u2014for example, strapping\nhim to the bed to deliver an operation. In such instances, the problem\nwith forced care cannot be simply violation of autonomy. Some have\nargued in somewhat similar cases that forced care is legitimate,\nbecause it would contravene \u201cmere desire\u201d not\n\u201crational desire\u201d (Savulescu 1994), and because \u201cthe\nstate has the right to prevent self-regarding harmful\nconduct\u2026when\u2026 that conduct is substantially\nnonvoluntary\u2026\u201d (Feinberg 1986, 12). A different possible\nconclusion is that present informed consent practices are sound, they\njust rest on justifications other than respect for personal autonomy;\nsurely a \u201cNo\u201d to an intervention in the body is often a\n\u201cNo\u201d even when the patient lacks the capacity or the\ninformation to authorize an autonomous \u201cYes\u201d (compare\nEstlund 2007, 121\u20135; Gunderson 1990). A third possible\nconclusion is that while what is wrong with forced care in this\nsetting is the violation of autonomy, what \u201cautonomy\u201d\nmeans here is simply a domain over which one should remain sovereign\nand have the final say, even if uninformed, incapacitated, and so\nforth (Enoch 2017, 31\u201332). This, however, is not how\n\u201cautonomy\u201d is used in bioethics.\n\nAs a final challenge to grounding informed consent in autonomy,\nconsider a patient who has been treated fairly and offered a simple\nexplanation of her treatment and the alternatives, which she could\ncomprehend if she tried; her failure to comprehend it and to choose\nautonomously is the fruit of her own neglect. Can the physician or the\ninvestigator really be blamed for the patient\u2019s consequent\nnon-autonomous choice (Sreenivasan 2003; Miller and Wertheimer 2010,\n85, 95; Millum and Bromwich 2013)? In many areas of life in which\nconsent seems necessary, what matters is not so much the\n\u201cquality of choice,\u201d say, how autonomous it is, but\nwhether the person had been given the opportunity to make a choice of\nthat quality (Scanlon 1988). Advocates of the autonomy rationale may\nrespond in one of two ways. First, they may insist that when an\ninvestigator did due diligence to help candidate participants\nunderstand the significant risks of a study yet sees that they have\nnot been understood, she has a reason to explain again, or recruit\nother candidates, precisely because the autonomy of study\nparticipation matters; alternatively, they may insist that having been\ngiven real opportunity to decide autonomously already counts as having\nbeen given autonomy over the matter.\n2.3 Preventing abusive conduct\n\nAn alternate rationale defends informed consent requirements as a\nbulwark against such deontological offenses as assault, deceit,\ncoercion, and exploitation (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 75f.), or\nfraud (Millum and Bromwich 2013). From this viewpoint, informed\nconsent requirements are instrumental against certain abusive acts,\nnot (only) against setbacks to health and welfare.\n\nThe abuse-prevention rationale may be unable to account for the full\nextent of clinicians\u2019 informed consent duties. We have already\nmentioned that physicians should make some effort to explain\ninformation again if they discover that their patients misunderstand\ncrucial risks. Intuitively, this is so even if the patient was given\nan excellent explanation, one that worked with similar patients and\nwhich would rule out reasonable suspicion of deceit, exploitation, or\nfraud, their patients misunderstand crucial risks should make some\neffort to explain again. Given that abuse has already been ruled out,\nthe abuse-prevention rationale fails to account for this duty\n(Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 118; compare Manson and O\u2019Neill\n2007, 82\u20133). That said, the abuse-prevention rationale in no way\nrules out an account of that duty based on complementary rationales\nfor informed consent (Millum and Bromwich 2013, 218).\n\nAnother challenge for the abuse-prevention rationale is that it is\ndifficult to ground in the deontological morality that has been\ninvoked to motivate it. Typically understood as\n agent relative\n and moment relative, deontological morality may be unable to provide\nstrong reasons for preventing future deontological offenses,\nespecially by others. A truly deontological abuse-prevention rationale\nwould therefore leave little room for strong reasons to enforce\ninformed consent requirements on others, yet some informed consent\nrights are surely legally enforceable by third parties later. It would\nalso hardly leave room for strong reasons against coercive medical\nintervention when third parties perform the coercion; for example,\nagainst extracting a live kidney from a consenting patient who\nconsents only due to her family\u2019s coercion, yet such reasons are\nwidely recognized. Any consequentialist variant on the\nabuse-prevention rationale would usually need to focus on all bad\nconsequences, not just on abusive conduct and its downstream\nconsequences, and serious harm to someone\u2019s health would often\ncount as a worse consequence than someone\u2019s having been\ndeceived. \n2.4 Trust\n\nIn recent years, a number of philosophers have argued that\n\u201cInformed consent\u2026 is generally important [in part]\nbecause it can make a distinctive contribution to the restoration of\ntrust\u201d (O\u2019Neill 2002, 145; see also Bok 1999, 11,\n26\u20137, 63; Jackson 1994, 491; Kass et al 1996; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\n1999, 24). Their trust rationale is future-looking. It points out the\nimportance of ongoing societal trust in caretakers and medical\ninstitutions, for example, as a precondition of ongoing compliance\nwith medical advice, registration for organ donor cards, and\nparticipation in medical research. Since violations of informed\nconsent would jeopardize that trust, they are something to be avoided.\nThis rationale has the advantage of potentially demanding informed\nconsent even to certain low-risk and low-impact interventions. For\nexample, forced testicular exam may be medically \u201csafe\u201d,\nbut, if discovered, could profoundly shake public trust in providers.\nThe rationale also addresses the special wrongness of outright lying\nto patients (perhaps worse than non-lying deceit: Jackson 1991,\n7\u20139)), say, to realize beneficial placebo effects. If\ndiscovered, lying and battery could easily undermine public trust in\nphysicians.\n\nThe trust rationale is most plausible as a partial rationale. It faces\nserious objections if it is taken as a comprehensive justification of\ninformed consent (Eyal 2014). For one thing, being forward-looking,\nthis rationale is vulnerable to the objection that, intuitively,\ninformed consent can remain necessary even when the public could never\nfind out that a core violation of the requirement took place. While\nthe requirement of informed consent might not obtain across the board,\nit seems inappropriate to determine whether it obtains in a given\ncontext based on e.g. how chemically traceable is the medication whose\nforced administration is being considered, although that would affect\nhow much this act would jeopardize future public trust in physicians.\nAnother challenge to this version of the trust rationale is that\ninvasive interventions without a person\u2019s informed consent are\nusually thought to wrong that person, not to wrong only the potential\nfuture victims of a decline in public trust. A possible response would\nbe that the (only) reason why we consider informed consent to be the\nimmediate patient\u2019s right is that what is likeliest to inspire\npublic trust is unconditional commitment to one\u2019s immediate\npatient\u2019s alleged consent rights.\n\nA quite different version of trust rationale is backward-looking. This\nversion defends informed consent as an intrinsically important way to\nhonor the trust that the patient has placed in the physician, and as\npart of the fiduciary role that the physician has undertaken (Joffe\nand Truog 2010, 352ff.), perhaps a matter of virtuous trustworthiness\n(Pellegrino and Thomasma 1993, 65\u201378). However, the\nbackward-looking version of the trust rationale has difficulty\nexplaining the need for informed consent outside pre-existing\ncaretaker-patient relationships. Forced bodily trespass, for example,\nseems (not much less) wrong when it comes from complete strangers.\n2.5 Self-ownership\n\nAnother rationale surrounds self-ownership: we are presumed to hold\nproprietary rights over ourselves and our bodies, perhaps in line with\nJohn Locke\u2019s idea that \u201cevery Man has a\n Property\n in his own Person\u201d (Locke 1988, V. 27, 305).\nNaturally, once an owner\u2019s consent is given, the alleged\nproprietary prohibition on access and on direct impact is removed.\nThis rationale may better explain why we must normally grant our\npermission, even for medical intervention that is safe, low-impact,\nand clearly beneficial, and requires no agency on our part. Trespass\ninto a private sphere can be forbidden even when it involves mere\ntouching, and the owner is foolish or selfish to reject it (Archard\n2008, 27f; Thomson 1990, ch. 8; Nozick 1986).\n\nBut an account based on self-ownership raises more questions than it\nsettles. Self-ownership may just mean that the individual\nshould be the final arbiter in the relevant sphere, and that seems\nlike a part of what informed consent requires\u2014hardly an edifying\nrationalization for requiring informed consent (compare Cohen 1995,\nchs. 9\u201310). Alternatively, self-ownership may designate a more\ncircumscribed list of rights (Fried 2005; Archard 2008, 29\u201330),\nbut this list would also stand in need of a defense, and cannot by\nitself count as adequate justification. A further challenge is that\nthe self-ownership rationale fails to clarify why touching sensitive\nareas of the body without consent seems worse than touching less\nsensitive areas without consent. Property violation is not usually a\nmatter of degree (compare Archard 2008, 30\u20131). Finally, the\nself-ownership rationale fails to clarify why physicians must disclose\nand ensure our comprehension of information prior to intervention,\nsomething which proprietary rights seldom require. Indeed, the notion\nof self-ownership could be used against coercing doctors to\ngive patients that information\u2014because such coercion may violate\nthese physicians\u2019 self-ownership rights to interact as they\nwill.\n2.6 Non-domination\n\nBioethicists rarely explore the value of\n non-domination\n as a rationale for informed consent, although this rationale is used\nextensively in sexual ethics and political philosophy. The idea here\nwould be that no one should be under the arbitrary control of another\nand that informed consent requirements help to prevent such arbitrary\ncontrol. One would argue that medicine is rife with potential to\nbecome hierarchical, given the utter dependency of patients and\nresearch participants on physicians (Levine 1988, 121\u20132), as\nwell as the knowledge gaps between them, especially in the\ninvestigational context. Therefore, it is important to ensure that\npatients and research participants retain a high degree of control\nover what happens to them, and informed consent helps with this. This\nrationale may shed light on the special importance of informed consent\nto research participation\u2014where the knowledge gap is greater,\nand where there is a specific informed consent right to withdraw from\nresearch at any point. Even if one has autonomously waived protection,\narbitrary control by others, without the protection of a consent\nrequirement, remains intolerable.\n\nThe non-domination rationale has difficulty explaining why physicians\nand investigators who are closely monitored and cannot afford to\nmistreat patients would also be obligated to let patients decide.\nArguably, some existing systems have ample institutional mechanisms in\nplace to prevent physicians and investigators from exercising\narbitrary control, even without informed consent requirements, and yet\ncommonsense recognizes such requirements.\n2.7 Personal integrity\n\nA final rationale for informed consent requirements is the need to\nprotect patients\u2019 sense of personal integrity. One reason\noffered for keeping surrogate pregnancy contracts non-enforceable is\nthe need to maintain surrogate carriers\u2019 sense of personhood by\nnever coercively taking babies away (Radin 1983, e.g., 960). A similar\nrationale may be thought to justify informed consent in general, and\nto reflect our special relation to our bodies. As Gerald Dworkin put a\nslightly different point, \u201cone\u2019s body is irreplaceable and\ninescapable. If my architect doesn\u2019t listen to me and this\nresults in a house I do not like, I can always move. I cannot move\nfrom my body.\u201d (Dworkin 1988, 113). By one interpretation,\npersonal integrity underlies self-ownership norms. What it requires\nis, in Ronald Dworkin\u2019s words, \u201ca prophylactic line that\ncomes close to making the body inviolate\u201d (Dworkin 1983, 39).\nHowever, personal integrity may instead give rise to a normative\ncontinuum, on which the outer line of the body is only one stop.\nTouching someone\u2019s cheek without his informed consent is hardly\nas bad as touching more sensitive areas of his body without his\ninformed consent. The continuum may also extend outside the body. As\nJudith Thomson points out, it is a greater transgression to touch an\nunwilling person\u2019s body than to touch his shoes, yet a small\ntransgression exists, even when he is not wearing them (Thomson 1990,\n207\u20138). It also matters how and why these areas are touched.\nSuch continua may be thought to track the typical degree of injury to\npersonal integrity.\n\nAn account in terms of personal integrity would require more\nspecification. For example, what is the relation between this account\nand the offense of battery? Would this account condemn the use of a\nmagic wand to treat an unwilling patient\u2019s ailments without\ncutting his skin and so, perhaps without battery (Brock 1999, 529f)?\nWould it also condemn threat of fines that coerces patients to move\ntheir bodies in certain ways, even without touching them? Is the\naccount ultimately grounded in an a priori argument, in\nevolutionary psychology (Wertheimer 2003, 113f.), in the typical\nmaterial harms from violations of bodily integrity, or in still other\nconsiderations?\n3. The idea of consent\n\nLet us now review the different elements of fully free and informed\nconsent in some detail, starting with the notion of consent itself.\nEnglish admits of both psychological and behavioral senses of consent.\nPsychologically, consent can designate \u201ca state of mind of\nacquiescence\u201d (Westen 2003, 5), and \u201can act of\nwill\u2014a subjective mental state\u2026\u201d (Hurd 1996, 121).\nBut the medical requirement of informed consent seems to include at\nleast some behavioral expression of consent (Kleinig 2010,\n9\u201310), ranging from a patient\u2019s signature, to her\nnot protesting when a nurse approaches with a syringe\n(so-called implicit or tacit consent). That said, the need for some\ncomprehension and voluntariness means that mental states also affect\nwhen consent legitimizes medical intervention, perhaps supporting a\nhybrid view of one sort (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 84) or another\n(Alexander 2014).\n\nWhen emergency intervention is needed but normal consent cannot be\nobtained, say, because the patient is unconscious and neither she nor\nher family\u2019s specific preferences can be identified in time,\nproponents of informed consent often justify intervention by invoking\na potentially different form of consent. They say that presumed\nconsent obtains, even if actual and express consent does not.\nPresumed consent is also often invoked in order to legitimize a\ngeneral policy of harvesting organs from healthy deceased persons to\nuse in transplantation unless they explicitly indicated their\nopposition, and a similar general policy of testing all incoming\npatients for HIV except those who explicitly request not to be tested.\nSuch policies reverse the usual default assumptions about what is\npermissible and place the onus on any individual who has reservations,\nto \u201copt out.\u201d The underlying thought is that when opting\nout remains easy, so-called presumed consent is perfectly consonant\nwith patient sovereignty (Sunstein and Thaler 2008).\n\nSome authors oppose the terminology of presumed consent as a contrived\n\u201cmyth\u201d or \u201cfiction\u201d of actual consent (Harmon\n1990; Brownsword 2004, 232\u20133; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 107;\nDworkin 1988, 117). They concede that when a nurse approaches a\npatient with a syringe, the patient\u2019s failure to protest\nconstitutes actual, albeit tacit, consent per convention. But they add\nthat it is fraudulent to presume consent when consent is not\nexplicitly given and no relevant convention specifies that silence\nexpresses consent.\n\nThis opposition seems to interpret \u201cpresumed consent\u201d\nascriptions as meaning: Presumably, the patient has given actual\n(albeit tacit) consent. The opponents seem right on point: it\ngoes too far to assume that, just because a patient fails to carry in\nher pocket a directive forbidding care or organ harvesting in the\nevent of an emergency or death, she is consenting. However, on a\ndifferent interpretation, presumed consent ascriptions mean:\nPresumably, the patient would have consented to the intervention\nif, under the current circumstances, she were\ndecisionally-capacitated. A possible ground for such\ncounterfactual ascriptions is that there is no special information\nthat indicates that the patient would not consent, and most people\nwould consent. This interpretation seems to sidestep the\ndifficulty.\n\nOf course, if opt-out organ procurement policies are justified, it is\nnot necessary that one justify them in terms of consent (presumed or\notherwise) as long as one is prepared to argue that sometimes, certain\nvalues defeat individuals\u2019 consent rights. In the case of organs\nfrom the deceased, the primary pull for making consent not refusal\ninto the default may well be the huge benefit to the organ recipient\nand the far lower harm to the deceased. Together, these factors may\nmake high-quality informed consent less urgent.\n4. Informed consent\n\nClinical trials are commonly anticipated by a formalized process in\nwhich participants receive explanations of the purpose, methods,\nrisks, benefits, and alternatives to study participation, as well as\nother matters, before they sign informed consent forms (Beauchamp and\nChildress 2008, 129). Fairly similar processes exist in invasive care.\nBut what is the point of these processes? One of Plato\u2019s\ncharacters mocks doctors who set aside time to keep sick patients\ninformed: \u201cFoolish fellow, \u2026 you are not healing the sick\nman, but you are educating him; and he does not want to be made a\ndoctor, but to get well\u201d (Plato Laws, IV.720a\u2013c,\np. 413). Let us discuss two forms of transgression of the information\nrequirement: (1) lies, deceit, and merely-partial disclosure, and (2)\nthe patient\u2019s failure to comprehend well-presented information.\nWe shall then discuss (3) the content and (4) the cogency of the\ninformation requirement.\n4.1 Lies, deceit, and partial disclosure\n\nLies about pertinent matters are broadly assumed to violate the\ninformed consent requirement. So does non-lying deceit that\nintentionally prompts a false impression, for example, complete\nconcealment of a potentially despairing prognosis, or its statement in\nobscure Latin terms that the patient cannot understand, in order to\nmaintain the patient\u2019s hope and medical adherence. So does\nnon-lying deceit that is voluntary but unintentional, say an\nexplanation in obscure Latin terms meant only to impress the patient\nbut foreseen to hamper comprehension (Jackson 1991, 6). Interestingly,\nignorance of side effects that results purely from the early stage of\nscientific inquiry into them is taken to permit informed consent and\nautonomous decisionmaking (Millum and Bromwich 2013). A recent\nquestion is how much certain mild forms of intentional\nmanipulation\u2014for example, placing the hopeful news both at the\nbeginning and at the end of a prognostic report so as to make its\naffect more hopeful\u2014invalidate informed consent (Eyal 2016).\n\nThe intentional use of the placebo effect in clinical care, commonly a\ndeceitful means to help a patient feel better, is condemned by\nprominent bioethicists in the name of informed consent (Bok 1999,\n61ff.; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 125). Other seeming breaches of\nthe information component of informed consent are somewhat more\npopular with bioethicists. First, the well-established\n\u201cnocebo\u201d effect is when the patient\u2019s expectation of\na negative outcome as a possibility generates corresponding symptoms\nor exacerbates them. When a severe, unavoidable nocebo effect from\ndisclosure is predictable, most philosophical observers support\nwithholding certain information (Cohen 2014). In some cultures,\npatients are averse to hearing about risks because they falsely\nbelieve that the mention of remote risks makes those risks likelier to\nmaterialize. While the expectation is false, it means that full\ndisclosure of these risks would meet with aversion, potential anxiety,\nand fewer clinic visits, and many bioethicists permit partial\ndisclosure in such settings (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 106).\nFinally, so-called deceptive studies can begin while the participant\nis waiting in the corridor for what she believes is an altogether\ndifferent experiment, precisely because full disclosure would foil the\ninvestigation. Their deceitful nature notwithstanding, such studies\nare ubiquitous in psychology and some bioethicists find forms of them\nacceptable (but see condemnation in Bok 1995).\n4.2 Comprehension problems\n\nWhat is the point of the disclosure process? The Nuremberg Code can be\nunderstood to answer that one point is that a research participant\nshould \u201chave sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the\nelements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an\nunderstanding and enlightened decision.\u201d Clearly, mere\ndisclosure does not ensure that. Even when information is given in\nplain terms in the participant\u2019s language, many participants\nfail to appreciate statistical information about risks, or the fact\nthat in placebo controlled trials, they might not receive the\ntreatment under investigation, or the fact that trials aim to further\nscientific knowledge and not necessarily their own medical good. The\nresult is that participants tend to overestimate the benefits of trial\nparticipation and downplay its risks, part of a phenomenon called the\n\u201ctherapeutic misconception\u201d (Candilis and Lidz 2010;\nMiller 2010, 382ff.; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 129).\n\nMany contemporary writers therefore emphasize that truly informed\nconsent requires much more than mere disclosure, and that the point of\ndisclosure, rather, is the comprehension potentially gained through\neffective communication (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 127ff; Manson\nand O\u2019Neill 2007, e.g., 184\u20135). Psychologists and health\nliteracy experts seek effective ways to improve comprehension among\npatients and candidate study participants (Candilis and Lidz 2010).\nAnd when a patient or a candidate participant is known to understand\nthe relevant information anyhow because she is a physician\nspecializing in the field, intuitively disclosure is unnecessary,\nevidence that its point is comprehension and hence, perhaps,\nautonomous decision-making (Beauchamp 2010, 57).\n\n\u201cHowever, a challenge arises in cases where disclosing all of the\nvery serious risks to candidates, results in forms that are so long as\nto inhibit comprehension. When this happens, a preference for adequate\ncomprehension over adequate disclosure may suggest that we should\nneglect to mention at least some major risks. If that seems misplaced,\nthere might be some point to adequate disclosure beyond its potential\ncontribution to the patient\u2019s or the study candidate\u2019s\nadequate comprehension, such as greater transparency and\naccountability.\n\nWhen comprehension remains poor despite repeated efforts to elicit\ncomprehension, what should investigators do? Is enlistment in a trial\nillegitimate, because no autonomous authorization took place (Faden\nand Beauchamp 1986; Candilis and Lidz 2010)? Some philosophers respond\nthat it remains legitimate, because by giving candidates the\nopportunity to issue autonomous authorization, investigators\ndo their parts (Sreenivasan 2003), avoid any potential fraud (Millum\nand Bromwich 2013), and treat the candidates fairly (Miller and\nWertheimer 2010), conditions that they find sufficient for valid\nconsent. Indeed, even the permissibility of skipping disclosure when\nthe patient is a medical expert might be taken to indicate that part\nof the point of informed consent is to prevent fraud, which is\nimpossible when the patient is easily capable of detecting fraud, and\nnot necessarily autonomous authorization.\n4.3 Content\n\nWhat information should be disclosed or comprehended? It is common to\nemphasize that patients cannot possibly be \u201cfully\ninformed\u201d if that would include all facts, or all facts that are\nmaterial to physicians\u2019 decisions. For example, research\nparticipants, who need to know the main risks of participation, do not\nneed to know much about the history of the disease. But how are we to\ndetermine which facts patients and trial participants should be\ninformed about? Three legal standards exist: the professional\nstandard, the reasonable person standard, and the individual standard.\n\n\nThe professional standard mandates informing patients and\nparticipants of those details that it is conventional for\nprofessionals in the field to mention. Once predominant, this standard\nhas lost much of its traction with U.S. courts. Indeed, no\nprofessional convention exists on this issue, and courts have opined\nthat patients should decide which information is pertinent to them.\nThe reasonable person standard mandates disclosing whatever\ndetails a reasonable patient would find pertinent. Finally, the\nindividual standard mandates informing the patient or\nparticipant of those details that she, as a determinate individual, in\nkeeping with her potentially unreasonable conception of the good,\nwould find pertinent if she were otherwise reasonable (Beauchamp and\nChildress 2008, 122f.; Levine 1988, 104\u20135; Berg et al. 2001,\n46\u201352). An argument against requiring the disclosure of\nany risk is that neither advance disclosure nor risk\ncomprehension are necessary for the restoration of trust and for\ndeterring abuse of patients and trial participants; what is necessary\nis only ready patient and trial participant access to the relevant\ninformation in the event that abuse is suspected (Manson and\nO\u2019Neill 2007, 179ff.).\n\nAs with many other \u201cstandards\u201d in medical ethics, the\nquestion arises as to whether they are mere recommended procedures for\ndoctors, judges, and professional educators, or exhibit fundamental\nmoral principles.\n4.4 Cogency\n\nWhether being informed is cashed out in terms of disclosure or of\ncomprehension, and whichever standard is used, asking that patients or\nstudy participants be even adequately informed is sometimes asking too\nmuch. U.S. federal regulations waive the information requirement in\nresearch for some studies that involve no more than a minimal risk. In\nclinical care, many patients would rather not think about risks and\nprognoses that would turn their stomachs and that they can do little\nabout. In some such contexts it seems cogent not to demand informing\nin any form (see sections 6, 7 below). However, outright lies surely\nremain forbidden even in such circumstances. A possible conclusion is\nthat informed consent encompasses several layers of requirement that\ndiffer in their stringency.\n5. Voluntary consent\n\nWhen is consent sufficiently voluntary? Let us discuss three potential\nbarriers to voluntariness: (1) literal coercion, (2) \u201cundue\ninducement\u201d, and (3) \u201cno choice\u201d situations.\n5.1 Coercion\n\nVoluntary consent is usually thought incompatible with\n coercion,\n which philosophers define, roughly, as a threat to make someone\nseriously worse off than she is or should be, unless she consents\n(Wertheimer 1987). Nonetheless, the prevailing medical ethos tends to\ntreat more cases as cases of coercion than this philosophical\ndefinition would suggest. A threat to cause even slight pain unless a\npatient acquiesces would be taken to invalidate her consent. It would\ndo so even if the patient and the physician have common knowledge that\nit would not make her seriously worse off and so, that it would not\namount to coercion. A threat to deny preventative intervention that is\nnot otherwise owed\u2014which therefore rarely amounts to a threat to\nmake the patient worse off than she is or should be\u2014unless the\npatient consents to an intervention would also be frowned upon.\n\nHow much do \u201cimplicit threats\u201d count as threats? Imagine a\npractitioner who asks her own patient to participate in a study that\nthe practitioner runs, and the patient fears that care would suffer if\nhe declines, without the practitioner actually saying so. When the\npatient\u2019s fear is well-founded, or even intentionally instilled\nby the practitioner, the norm has been to consider consent invalid.\nThis clearly makes sense if what makes coercion problematic is\n(unjust) curtailment of options. However, even when the fear is\nunfounded and unintended, the hierarchy and the power inequality of\nthe physician-patient relationship are often still thought to make\nsuch consent involuntary. The thought is that someone\u2019s options\ncount in this context as curtailed even when what curtails them is\nuncertainty and the patient\u2019s own pessimism.\n5.2 Undue inducement\n\nAnother category often said to undermine voluntariness is undue\ninducement, a term of art meaning that something is being offered that\nis alluring to the point that it clouds rational judgment, for\ninstance cash in hand or airline tickets in return for kidney donation\nor risky study participation. Attention is fixated on the benefit,\ndisallowing proper consideration of risks. The thought here is not\nthat the offer is too good to decline rationally, but that, as in\ndeceit and hypnosis, proper reasoning and decision-making about it\nbecomes impossible, at least for some patient populations (Wilkinson\n2003, 117\u2013118). A common worry among bioethics practitioners,\nundue inducement is less concerning to philosophers who have tried to\nmake sense of the notion (e.g. Wertheimer 2010).\n5.3 \u201cNo choice\u201d situations\n\nIn some areas of practical ethics, the lack of decent alternatives to\naccepting a bad offer, a so-called \u201cNo choice\u201d situation\n(Wertheimer 1987, e.g., p. 13), is said to make us forced or compelled\nto choose the offer (Cohen 1979), or to undermine voluntariness\notherwise. While in such cases, indecent alternatives remain in\nprinciple open to us\u2014the offer is not physically imposed on\nus\u2014the same could be said of most literal coercion. In\n\u201cyour money or your life\u201d situations, the option of dying\nremains open in principle. Consider then a poor person who knows that\nhis only way to gain access to an expensive life-saving drug is to\nparticipate in a risky or very unpleasant study where the drug is\nprovided free of charge. He is not, strictly speaking, coerced\n(Hawkins 2008, 24\u20135), but some believe that his consent is\ninvoluntary and the trial is unethical. None of the options available\nto him are decent.\n\nThere is a problem with this claim. Its logic suggests that whenever a\nsick, rich person has no decent alternative to taking a badly\nunpleasant life-saving drug, there is no voluntary consent, and drug\ndelivery is illegitimate. Even when the nasty side effects remain far\nbetter for her than her only alternative\u2014to die of the\ndisease\u2014she is not providing voluntary consent to take the drug,\nand it is unethical to give it to her. Since the latter reasoning is\nsurely flawed, the former reasoning may be flawed as well.\n\nSome have responded that the poor man\u2019s inability to give\nvoluntary consent to trial participation stems from injustice, not\nnatural disease, and that this makes a big difference. But surely\nmedical aid that saves consenting victims from the horrible results of\ninjustice and carries unpleasant side effects can remain\nfully permissible. For example, following the 2010 earthquake in\nHaiti, it was fully permissible for the U.S. military and its\nphysicians to perform consensual life-saving leg amputations. It was\npermissible whether earthquake injuries were purely natural, partly\nthe result of non-U.S. injustice (local contractors\u2019 independent\nneglect of safety rules), or partly the result of U.S.-perpetrated\ninjustice (long-standing U.S. meddling in Haitian politics at the\nexpense of accountability, including accountability for neglectful\nconstruction projects).\n\nAnother way out is to say that consent is insufficiently voluntary\nwhen the patient\u2019s options are unfairly curtailed by the offer\nitself (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 92, 97). \u201cYour money or your\nlife\u201d offers diminish our options, and that is why these offers\ncompromise our voluntariness. By contrast, the above-mentioned offers\nto the poor trial candidate and to the rich patient do not curtail\noptions and they maintain voluntariness. However, imagine impoverished\npotential study participants who lack alternative ways to obtain\nlife-saving drugs. Imagine further that the investigators offer them\nthese drugs whether or not they consent to participate, free of\ncharge. The intuition is that this free, unconditional offer increases\nthe voluntariness of these potential participants\u2019 decisions on\nwhether to participate, and it makes their invitation to participate\nin the trial easier to defend ethically. The free offer keeps their\noptions open and thereby, commonsense suggests, renders their consent\nmore genuinely voluntary. Note, however, that the options that the\noffer opens for them are not ones that the invitation to\nparticipate would otherwise have curtailed.\n6. Own-waivers of informed consent\n\nWhen, if ever, is a person authorized to waive her informed consent\nrights? Should participants who donate blood in a medical trial be\npermitted to authorize its use in any future trial, without their\nspecific consent for each token (as U.S. federal regulations allow\nthem, since 2018, to do)? What about a patient or a candidate study\nparticipant who asks to be spared tedious descriptions of her\ndifferent options, and would rather entrust the medical team, or her\nvillage elder, with key decisions? What about someone who asks her\nphysician to lie to her, if he is willing, should her prognosis be\ndespairing? And what about a woman who would like to sell pregnancy\nservices with a fully enforceable contract to hand over the baby even\nif she develops strong maternal feelings toward him or her and seeks\nto revoke her consent?\n\nIn democratic politics, we delegate many decisions to representatives.\nBut we keep ourselves barred from signing away others, including the\ndecision to waive our voting rights altogether. The question as to\nwhich decisions our institutions should allow patients to delegate to\nthird parties is complex and under-explored. Bioethicists usually\nfrown upon letting patients grant so-called carte blanche, or\ngeneral consent, to whatever the physician considers appropriate for\nthem (Dworkin 1988, e.g., 125\u20136). Instead, patients are usually\nencouraged or compelled to make decisions on a more ongoing\nbasis\u2014to give so-called specific consent (Kleinig 2010,\n18)\u2014although there are logical limits to how specific consent\ncan be (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 12).\n\nThe requirement of informed consent is often attacked on the ground\nthat many patients would rather have physicians make certain decisions\nfor them, and that such delegation often seems acceptable (Schneider\n1998). One answer to the attack argues that informed consent is a\npatient\u2019s right, not her duty (Beauchamp and Childress 2008,\n105, 107), and that, since informed consent serves autonomy, it ought\nto be autonomously waiveable (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 106).\nIndeed, autonomously signed advance directives that bind one\u2019s\nfuture self can be perfectly consensual and autonomous. What we may\ncall \u201cwaiveable waivers\u201d of informed consent rights\n(\u201cPlease spare me the full disclosure or decide in my name\nunless I ask to resume full disclosure or active control\u201d) seem\nrelatively easy to accept and fairly consistent with autonomy.\nHowever, we do impose some rights, which we consider inalienable, on\nunwilling rights holders. The right not to become a slave is\ninalienable, and the same may apply to some informed consent rights,\nsuch as the right not to become a participant of a clinical trial that\none cannot exit.\n\nAn alternative answer to the attack is therefore that some informed\nconsent rights are waiveable (perhaps including many disclosure\nrights), and others are non-waiveable (perhaps including the right to\nrevoke prior consent to bodily intrusion). Theory is needed in order\nto tell which informed consent rights are waiveable and which are not.\n(Is the alleged second-order right to waive informed consent\nrights alienable?) Theory should also explore whether non-waiveable\nconsent requirements are consistent with patient autonomy, say,\nbecause what such requirements impose is autonomous decision-making\n(potentially out of paternalistic concern with protecting the\npatient\u2019s autonomy).\n7. Exceptions to informed consent\n\nEven absent own-waivers, and despite absolutist statements of the\ninformed consent requirement, such as the Nuremberg Code, many\ncontemporary theorists agree that there are cases where informed\nconsent procedures are not necessary. The law, and many bioethicists,\nrecognize exceptions to informed consent requirements, such as lack of\ndecision-making capacity, or emergency circumstances where the\npatient\u2019s wishes are unknown (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1999; Emanuel,\nWendler, and Grady 2000). That said, these exceptions serve the spirit\nof informed consent; they can be plausibly woven into full statements\nof the requirement (as proposed, for instance, in Dworkin 1988, 117),\nand they question only its crudest, most absolutist statements. Other\nexceptions seem harder to reconcile with full-blown commitment to\ninformed consent and its central justifications. Let us discuss,\nspecifically, the extent to which informed consent is needed in (1)\nbenign care and benign experiments, (2) certain risky experiments, and\n(3) public health policy. We shall then present the general question,\n(4) When is informed consent needed?\n7.1 Benign interventions\n\nThe reality is that informed consent procedures are not legally\nmandated for the lion\u2019s share of medical care, e.g. standard\nblood draws, in contrast to more invasive interventions like surgery.\nIndeed, form filling, mandatory disclosures, and so forth are\nintuitively unnecessary for the former (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007,\n81f). In medical research, United States federal regulations authorize\nreview boards to omit informed consent requirements on many occasions\nwhen \u201cresearch involves no more than minimal risk to the\nparticipants\u201d, a provision expanded in 2018. Again, this seems\nto make sense in many cases. A relatively safe and low-impact study\ncomparing two widely used drugs to ascertain which is best seems\nmorally permissible, even without a full-fledged informed consent\nprocess (Truog et al. 1999).\n\nSome authors have used such examples to downplay the need for informed\nconsent, criticizing what they call bioethicists\u2019\n\u201cfixation\u201d with informed consent (O\u2019Neill 2002,\n47\u20138; Brownsword 2004, 224). In response, some proponents of\ninformed consent insist that, in many of the alleged counter-examples,\nsomething in the way of informed consent remains vital. In blood\ndraws, in particular, when the patient is shown the needle and\nsilently stretches her arm forward, she is said to give tacit or\nnon-verbal consent (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 107; and see also\nManson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 11). This particular response may be\ninsufficient. For example, when a busy nurse with many patients in\nline realizes that a patient is very ignorant about a blood draw, such\nthat her tacit consent is uninformed, intuitively the nurse does\nnot owe the patient a long explanation of the risks from a\nsanitized needle prick, which are remote and minor. \n\nTo some, this may suggest that fully-fledged informed consent\nrequirements simply do not apply to highly benign interventions.\nSurely the need to protect health and welfare, at least, through\ninformed consent procedures is lesser when that risk is negligible in\nthe first place. Interestingly, similar logic suggests that when an\nintervention is not benign yet informed consent cannot improve upon\nother protections, informed consent may be unnecessary. A possible\ncase in point is observational studies of anonymized electronic health\nrecords, where the main risk comes from breach of data security and\nconfidentiality\u2014a serious yet technical matter that few\nindividual patients could assess reliably\u2014and thus informed\nconsent (on top of expert input and democratic decision making) might\nbe an ineffective, unhelpful protection.\n\nStill, some elements of the requirement of informed consent must\nremain in place, even in standard blood draws and other benign\ninterventions (Dickert et al. forthcoming). Physical duress against a\nrefusing patient and the intentional exploitation of a patient\u2019s\nignorance about blood draws both usually remain wrong. This may\nsuggest that informed consent bundles together several requirements\nwith different levels of stringency. Some are necessary in more\ncontexts than others. It may also be thought to substantiate other\ntheories on the ground for informed consent. For example, above we\nmentioned the view that informed consent is necessary as a\npreventative bulwark against coercive or fraudulent practices. But on\nthat view, any exception for benign interventions might be impossible,\nsince these interventions would be just as coercive or fraudulent as\ninvasive ones. Thus, if sometimes it is correct for benign studies not\nto require informed consent, this calls this view into question. \n7.2 Some risky experiments\n\nAdvancing the field of emergency medicine requires medical\nexperimentation, including trials that compare different interventions\nand that only sometimes serve the best interests of trial\nparticipants. But, in emergency circumstances, it is often impossible\nto obtain consent from the patient or her family in time. Many\nphysicians believe that, because the field of emergency medicine\nsimply cannot progress absent experimentation, there should be an\nexception to informed consent requirements even for such risky trials,\nand substitutes for informed consent should be sought (Fost 1998;\nDickert et al. forthcoming). Some elements of informed consent, such\nas retrospective debriefing, remain relevant though (Dickert et al.\nforthcoming), again suggesting a \u201cbundled\u201d\nrequirement.\n7.3 Some public health policies\n\nIt is interesting that for public health interventions, whose impact\non human health can exceed that of clinical interventions, usually\nlittle, if any, informed consent is mandated. Exposure to ads and\n\u201cnudges\u201d that promote populations\u2019 health seems\nlegitimate to most of us even when the authority executing the\ninterventions discloses very little about these interventions, their\nrisks, their alternatives, and any real opportunities to avert them.\nChanges to traffic regulations that affect accident rates on a grand\nscale are not thought to demand the consent of each individual\ncitizen. Nor are such changes considered necessary when they are\nexperimental (despite Richter et al. 2001)--health policy trials may\nrequire a very different approach to consent than clinical trials.\n\n\nDifferently put, even in the absence of public health emergencies\n(which can warrant transgressions like forcing individuals to enter\nquarantine), the widely accepted standard in public health seems more\nintrusive than the one in clinical care. As further illustration, many\nwould agree that it is legitimate to implement smoke-free bar laws\nthat somewhat increase anti-smoking stigma, partly in order to goad\nsmokers to quit (and not only as measures to protect third parties\nfrom second-hand smoke). But most would condemn a clinician who\ndeliberately boosts stigma to goad an individual patient to quit\nsmoking (e.g. mocking the stink), and might explain that such pressure\nundermines the patient\u2019s freedom to decide whether to quit. Is\none of these arguably different approaches to informed consent right\nand the other one, wrong? Or is informed consent morally required for\nsome interventions and not for others?\n7.4 Informed consent\u2014when?\n\nAn emerging picture is that the need for informed consent depends on\nmany variables. Just like being informed, the voluntariness of choices\ncomes in degrees (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 101). Threats, for\nexample, control us to different degrees, depending on the degree of\nharm being threatened (Beauchamp 2010, 70\u20131). The level of\nvoluntariness necessary for valid consent to medical intervention may\nvary according to the type of intervention offered. So does the level\nof decision-making capacity necessary for valid consent (Buchanan and\nBrock 1989, ch. 1; Beauchamp 2010, 71). Robust informed consent that\nrequires a great deal of information, voluntariness, and decisional\ncapacity and is formalized and relatively non-waiveable, is necessary\nsometimes, but not always. Roughly speaking, robust informed consent\n(Joffe and Truog 2010, 358; Miller 2010, 391; Beauchamp and Childress\n2008, 101; Beauchamp 2010, 70\u20131) tends to be necessary the more\nrisky the intervention, the more it is a high-impact (e.g. a\ndefinitive \u201ccritical life choice\u201d: Archard 2008), the more\nit is value-laden and controversial, the more private the area of the\nbody that the intervention directly affects, and the more conflicted\nand unsupervised the practitioner. On other occasions, the need for\nvery robust informed consent, and indeed, for consent of any form, is\nlesser (Miller 2010, 393). On those occasions, high financial or other\ncosts of robust consent procedures easily override that need.\n\nDoes the need for informed consent depend, among other variables, on\nwhether the consent is for research or for care? Currently, consent\nprocedures for research tend to be more demanding and more regulated\nthan consent procedures for equally intrusive treatment (Levine 1988,\n127\u201330; Miller 2010, 381). Why? A standard account is that the\nproper goal of research is to gather generalizable knowledge, and not\nto help the individual, and that this different goal enhances the need\nfor protections like informed consent (Fried 1974). However, actual\ngoals often differ from proper goals. In reality, many researchers are\nhighly committed to promoting participants\u2019 health, and many\nclinicians seek primarily financial gain, sometimes at patients\u2019\nexpense. In addition, studies are reviewed independently for their\nsafety, making some so safe that (with or without consent) they impose\nless risk than similar clinical care. Another rationale for the fewer\nconsent requirements in care is that the relationship between the\nclinician and the patient is typically a fiduciary one whereas the\nrelationship between the investigator and the study participant is\nscarcely fiduciary (Joffe and Truog 2010, 364). But this rationale\ncould easily work the other way around: assuming that the fiduciary\nrelationship is a ground for informed consent (Joffe and Truog 2010,\n352ff.), the more fiduciary clinical relationship should demand more,\nnot less, by way of informed consent.\n\nLet us return to the general picture of scalar need for informed\nconsent, which depends on many variables and generates different\nrequirements on different occasions. It also raises interesting\npractical questions. First, who should decide when fully informed\nconsent is necessary (Joffe and Truog 2010, 361)? Might a crude,\none-size-fits-all requirement of informed consent serve most practical\npurposes (Wertheimer 2014)? Perhaps a fair compromise is to use an\n\u201cintervention ladder\u201d that defines broad categories of\nintervention as more or less intrusive, then specifies broad\ncategories of circumstance that require especially robust consent in\nsome cases and only minimal consent in others (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2007, 41\u20133)? What seems, in any event, to emerge is\nthat the need for informed consent would be misrepresented as\nfundamentally a single constraint or threshold. In this area, at\nleast, commonsense morality acknowledges that prescriptions\u2019\nstrengths and characters vary, with multiple determinants.\n8. The status of informed consent\n\nWhen informed consent is required, what kind of requirement does it\nrepresent? In particular, does it correlate to a natural right, to a\nlegal right, or to something else?\n\nBioethicists and human rights lawyers tend to assume that informed\nconsent is a natural right that generates a correlative objective\nmoral duty and, downstream, legal and institutional duties. Many\ncontemporary philosophers assume that consent has moral\n\u201cmagic\u201d that turns what would have been a wrongful action\ninto a right one, in an objective, moral sense (Hurd 1996). But some\nof the aforementioned justifications for informed consent better\nsupport other assumptions.\n\nFor example, the forward-looking trust rationale mentioned earlier can\nbe understood to mean that, morally, we should enshrine and then honor\nlegal (and cultural) informed consent requirements as a bulwark for\ntrust in medical practitioners. On that view, violating informed\nconsent requirements toward a patient does not necessarily violate\nthat patient\u2019s natural moral rights, only what are and\nmorally should remain everyone\u2019s legally protected\ninterests. \n\nIn a further model, the uniform requirement of informed consent across\ncircumstances reflects our sheer epistemological problem telling in\nadvance the typical circumstances when it objectively applies from\nrelative exceptions on which it does not (Wertheimer 2014, about the\nrequirement in intervention research; see also Alexander 2014). In a\nstill further model, the informed consent requirement only appears to\napply homogeneously across circumstances in the eyes of agents who\nhave cultivated, as morally they should, a fruitful yet false belief\nin the requirement\u2019s objectively homogeneous application (Eyal\n2015). In a final model, the justified legal standing of informed\nconsent bolsters its moral standing (Miller and Wertheimer 2010,\n82\u20133). \n\nOne reason to take non-naturalistic approaches to the status of\ninformed consent seriously is that not all natural rights are legally\nenforceable. Therefore, a moral informed consent right that is legally\nenforceable (as that right is usually taken to be in at least some\ninstitutional settings) may stand in need of additional moral\njustification, even if a natural right has been established. That\nadditional, inescapable moral justification may then turn out to\njustify informed consent regulations even absent natural informed\nconsent rights, say as trust-building measures. In particular, recall\nthat many bioethicists ground informed consent in duties to treat\nrational, autonomous persons respectfully. Some such duties are\nclearly non-enforceable. For example, the moral duty not to lie to\npersons in breach of their autonomous decision-making is seldom\nlegitimately enforceable. It is not the business of third parties to\nprevent me from disrespectfully and immorally lying to my friends.\nThus, additional justification would be needed, beyond simple appeal\nto respect for autonomy, in order to establish an enforceable informed\nconsent requirement. That inescapable additional moral justification\nmay turn out, if successful, to justify informed consent regulations\nand the surrounding ethos in full. It may do so even if the project of\ngrounding informed consent in autonomy, and all other attempts to\njustify natural informed consent rights, founder.\n9. Consent in other domains\n\nFor decades, bioethicists have discussed medical informed consent in\nrelative isolation from consent in political philosophy, contract\ntheory, and sexual ethics, where notions of consent are also pivotal.\nThis is finally changing, and it raises new technical and\nphilosophical questions about how to put these different discourses in\ndialogue with each other. For instance, is what bioethicists call\n\u201cpresumed consent\u201d the same thing as what political\nphilosophers call \u201chypothetical consent\u201d? Is what\nbioethicists call \u201cproxy consent\u201d one with what lawyers\ncall \u201cimpersonal consent\u201d? What bioethicists dub\n\u201cinvalid consent\u201d would often be described by contract law\nexperts as \u201clack of consent\u201d (Beauchamp 2010, 56; Kleinig\n2010, 13, 15).\n\nThis new development also raises substantive normative questions. For\nexample, imagine that the same basic principle underlies legitimate\npolitical regimes and legitimate medical experimentation. It may\nfollow that either tacit consent to a political regime, which\n Lockean contract theorists\n often cite, cannot successfully legitimize political regimes; or that\ntacit consent successfully legitimizes medical experimentation,\nrendering long consent forms unnecessary. Likewise, imagine that the\nsame basic principle underlies the legitimate procurement of income\nand that of organs for transplantation. Then perhaps either income\ntax\u2014without tax-payers\u2019 consent\u2014is illegitimate\n(Nozick 1986), or a \u201ckidney tax\u201d could be perfectly\nlegitimate (Fabre 2008, chs. 4\u20135). Either way, existing practice\nin one of these domains would be misguided.\n\nOn a different approach, fundamentally different right-making\nprinciples and rationales regarding consent apply in domains like\nmedicine, sex, and the marketplace, as might be indicated by the\nvariety of approaches to consent between these domains. For example,\nin most commercial transactions, unlike in the medical sphere, there\nare no legal requirements to disclose all relevant information and to\nverify that it is understood (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 80; Joffe\nand Truog 2010, 351), perhaps indicating that fairness matters there\nmore than autonomous decision-making. Likewise, whereas once we\nconsent to sell a car or to support a political candidate (by signing\na contract or casting a vote) our consent is not retractable, invasive\nmedical intervention is usually considered illegitimate once a\npreviously consenting patient or research participant expresses a\nchange of mind\u2014as though the point of consent in the medical\narena were not simply autonomous authorization but ongoing control\n(compare Pateman 1990, 79 on the wrongness of forcing sexual\ninteraction even within otherwise consensual marital relations).\nFinally, if A mishears B\u2019s consent to sex as refusal yet\nproceeds with sexual advances, a third party who understands the full\npicture has strong reasons to stop A\u2019s advances (pace\nAlexander 2014, 105). But if a physician mishears a patient\u2019s\nconsent to medically beneficial treatment as refusal yet proceeds to\nit, it is far less clear that a third party who understands the full\npicture should thwart the treatment. The point of medical care is,\nafter all, not defeated by discordance of attitudes in quite the same\nway that the point of sex is. One possible conclusion from this\nvariety is that the very point of requiring informed consent, and\nhence what is fundamentally required and when, vary between\ndomains.\n10. Conclusion: the core of informed consent\n\nThe turn of the 21st century has seen doubts surfacing about informed\nconsent, but that just makes the resilience of other parts of the\nrequirement all the more striking. Even purported critics usually\nrevise only the requirement\u2019s prevalent justifications and\ninterpretations in borderline areas, and leave a certain\n\u201ccore\u201d intact. Given how much philosophers usually\ndisagree, it is remarkable that, when a medical intervention is risky,\nvalue-laden, high-impact, physically invasive, and/or medically\ncontroversial, especially when a patient of sound mind explicitly\nrefuses the intervention, most of us would feel that only the most\ndire costs would justify imposition of care. The grudging nature of\nrelative skeptics\u2019 acceptance of this core part of the\nrequirement only attests to its philosophical resilience.\n\nIn seeking justification for the requirement of informed consent, we\nmay therefore not have one task, but many. We need to justify this\npowerful, relatively non-controversial core, as well as a weaker and\nmore questionable rim. It is possible that the core stems directly\nfrom natural right, whereas the rim is merely instrumental or\nconventional. It is also possible that they both rely on the same\nground, say, the value of autonomy, but touch on it in different\nmeasures. Even if the core of the requirement of informed consent\ncommands high priority, other parts may turn out to be easily\noverridable by competing values, including the value of advancing\nscientific research.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Archard, David, 2008.
