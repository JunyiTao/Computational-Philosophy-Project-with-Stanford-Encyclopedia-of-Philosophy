    "preamble": "\n\n\n\u00c9milie le Tonnelier de Breteuil, marquise Du\nCh\u00e2telet-Lomont\u2014or simply \u00c9milie Du \nCh\u00e2telet\u2014was born in Paris on 17 December 1706 to baron Louis Nicholas\nle Tonnelier de Breteuil and Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de\nBreteuil. She married Marquis Florent-Claude de Ch\u00e2telet-Lomont\nin 1725. Together they had three children, a daughter and two sons\n(the second died the year after his birth). In 1733, she met Voltaire\nwho became her lover and life-long intellectual companion. They\nretired to Du Ch\u00e2telet's husband's\nestate\u2014Cirey\u2014which was remodeled to include a laboratory\nwith several instruments for their on-going scientific experiments. In\n1748, she became pregnant at the age of 42 with the child of her then\nlover, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert. She bore her fourth\nchild, a daughter, on 4 September 1749 and died on 10 September\n1749.\n\n\nIn her intellectual work, Du Ch\u00e2telet focused on natural\nphilosophy, particularly that of Newton, Leibniz and Christian Wolff.\nShe knew, corresponded with, or was tutored by Pierre Louis de\nMaupertuis, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, Samuel Koenig, and several members\nof the Bernoulli family, and her advanced abilities in physics and\nmathematics made her especially able to write capably about\nNewton's physics. She thus contributed to the shift in France\naway from an acceptance of Cartesian physics and toward the embrace of\nNewtonian physics. Nonetheless, she was more than just an expositor of\nothers' works, and she was not interested in physics alone.\nIndeed, still squarely in the tradition of natural philosophy, Du\nCh\u00e2telet sought a metaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics\nshe embraced upon rejecting Cartesianism.\n\n\nVoltaire implicitly acknowledged her significant\ncontribution\u2014especially on more technical material\u2014to his\n1738 El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton. For many\nyears, it was believed that there was one surviving chapter from an\notherwise lost work written by Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2014her\n\u201cEssai sur l'optique\u201d (ca. 1736). This chapter is housed\namong Voltaire's papers in Russia's National Library in\nSt. Petersberg. Judging from that chapter on color formation this\nearlier essay seems to have been a more developed version of the\nchapter on optics in Voltaire's book, thus indicating her significant\ncontribution to Voltaire's work. As a fascinating side note on how\ndynamic Du Ch\u00e2telet studies are, in recent years fully three\ncomplete copies of her Essai have been found, one in\nBernoulli's papers in Basel (Nagel 2012) and two that have been\nacquired recently by the Mus\u00e9e des lettres et manuscrits in\nParis. In 1737 Du Ch\u00e2telet entered a competition to explain the\nnature of fire, conducting her experiments in secret while Voltaire\nalso conducted experiments for his entry to the competition. Both Du\nCh\u00e2telet's and Voltaire's entries aimed to disprove the theory\nthat fire is a material substance, and both were published along with\nthe three winners (including the essay essay by Leonhard Euler, which\ntook the top prize). Du Ch\u00e2telet returned to this project a\nnumber of times thereafter, making significant revisions to the\noriginal text as her ideas on the nature of fire matured and\nchanged.\n\n\nIn 1738, she published \u201cLettre sur les\n\u2018El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de\nNewton\u2019\u201d in the Journal des savants in which\nshe argued against those who accepted a Cartesian account of\nattraction. In 1740 she published her Institutions de\nphysique (The Foundations of Physics) ostensibly a\ntextbook in physics for her son, but in reality a highly original work\nin natural philosophy (a second edition was published in 1742 under\nthe slightly altered title Institutions physique). It was in\nthis text\u2014her magnum opus\u2014that she supplied the\nmetaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics she had long\naccepted. This metaphysics was Leibnizian and Wolffian in flavor. Her\ninclusion of a defense of force vive (she thus sided with\nLeibniz on this question) led to her subsequent dispute on the issue\nwith Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan. Sometime in the early 1740s she\nbegan work on her two-volume translation of and commentary on Newton's\nPrincipia. She died shortly after she completed this work,\nwhich remained unpublished until 1759. It is still the leading French\ntranslation of Newton's book.\n\n\nWhile Du Ch\u00e2telet's primary interest was in natural\nphilosophy, she also had interests in ethics (translating of portions\nof Mandeville's Fable of the Bees), theology and the\nBible (writing a book titled Examens de la\nBible), and the source of human happiness\n(writing a semi-autobiographical book, Discours sur le\nbonheur). Her non-scientific work occasionally touched on the\nsubject of women's social roles and their education.\n\n\nThis entry focuses on Du Ch\u00e2telet's natural philosophy,\nwhich occupied the bulk of her intellectual efforts. More specifically,\nit focuses on that aspect of her thought as found in her own clearly\narticulated version of natural philosophy\u2014her masterwork of\n1740, The Foundations of Physics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Du Ch\u00e2telet's Magnum Opus on Natural Philosophy: The Foundations of Physics: Introduction to the text\n\n\nIt is likely that Du Ch\u00e2telet's interest in writing a\ntext on Newtonian physics began to form around 1736 when Voltaire was\nworking through his own ideas for a text on Newton, eventually\npublished in 1738 (El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de\nNewton). Du Ch\u00e2telet's distinct advantage over\nVoltaire on this project was her superior mathematical training, given\nthat she sought out and benefitted from the tutelage of several of\nEurope's leading mathematicians. One such engagement was to have\nsignificant impact on both her own text on natural philosophy and on\nthe fate of her reputation as an original and innovative thinker. This was her\nengagement with Samuel Koenig, who arrived at Cirey in 1739 to tutor Du\nCh\u00e2telet in mathematics shortly after Du Ch\u00e2telet\nbenefitted from similar tutelage under Maupertuis (Zinsser 2006,\n162).\n\n\nThe significant\u2014and positive\u2014impact upon her text on\nnatural philosophy followed from the fact that Koenig brought with him\nto France, and to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the Leibnizian-inspired ideas of\nChristian Wolff. This may have contributed to a critical change in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's project, for Newtonian physics alone no longer seemed\nto her to be the correct way of explaining various features of the\nnatural world. Still, it is quite possible that Koenig's influence on\nDu Ch\u00e2telet has been over-estimated, for when Du\nCh\u00e2telet's earliest version of the Institutions de\nphysique (hereafter Foundations) was approved by the\ncensor Pitot\u2014before Du Ch\u00e2telet's tutoring sessions with\nKoenig\u2014Pitot mentioned that the text already contained ideas\nfrom\n Leibniz.[1]\n Nonetheless, in her later, published version of the\nFoundations, it is possible that she came to see more\nforcefully the need for metaphysical foundations for the phenomena\nthat Newton so powerfully describes in mathematical terms (e.g. Janik\n1982, 93 and 102). And so, in 1738, Du Ch\u00e2telet withdrew her\nFoundations from imminent publication in order to massively\nredraft it. The final product, published in 1740, would include an\nIntroduction followed by ten chapters on topics of metaphysics\ntouching on issues such as the principles of knowledge (chapter 1),\nGod (2), space and time (5 and 6) and four chapters on matter and\nbodies (7 through 10). Only then does the text deal with physics of an\nessentially Newtonian character.\n\n\nThe significant\u2014and negative\u2014impact upon her reputation as\nan original and innovative thinker followed from Koenig's accusation,\nupon the publication of Du Ch\u00e2telet's Foundations, that\nshe had plagiarized his ideas within the text, though given the point\nmade above, that Leibnizian ideas were already present in the text she\nwrote before Koenig's arrival, his charge seems\nmisplaced. Nonetheless, this stain upon the originality and power of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's intellect remained in some form or another until\nthe mid-twentieth century when William Barber concluded that her\nthought was \u201cessentially derivative\u201d of a number of her\nmale contemporaries, particularly Voltaire (Barber 1967). Others have\nargued for the originality of her views, and (Barber aside), this\ninterpretation has been the dominant one since Ira O. Wade presented\nhis careful case for her intellectual independence\u2014again,\nparticularly from Voltaire (Wade 1947). In what follows, more evidence\nis provided in favor of the growing belief that Du Ch\u00e2telet is\nnot a mere parrot of her more famous male contemporaries' views.\n\n\nOne way of characterizing Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nFoundations is to show that it is a reaction against Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and in favor of Newtonian physics. In the main, this\nis correct. Indeed, by the time Du Ch\u00e2telet turned her attention\nto the project of the Foundations, the popularity of Cartesian\nnatural philosophy was on the wane in France, the popularity of\nNewtonain physics was on the rise, and Du Ch\u00e2telet was in the\nthick of these movements. Still, two facts should give us pause when\nmaking the general claim just articulated. The first is that Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and Newtonian physics have\ndifferent scopes, with the former presenting a unified system of\nmetaphysics grounding and constraining the physics that follows from\nthe metaphysics. Indeed, Du Ch\u00e2telet's commitment to\ndeveloping a natural philosophy (rather than writing simply about\nphysics) required that she find an appropriate metaphysics to ground\nNewtonain physics, thus presenting a unified system to replace the (in\nher and others' view) defunct system of Descartes.\n\n\nThe second fact that ought to give us pause is that Du\nCh\u00e2telet was remarkably even handed and open minded about her\nreaction to various thinkers. She seems to have been swayed neither by\nnational prejudice nor by the authority of whatever great men were most\nfavored in France in her time. She prescribed being guided by truth in\none's philosophical decisions about what to adopt and what to\nreject from the various metaphysicians and physicists whose work was\nanimating intellectual circles in her time (IP Avant-Propos\nVII, X and XI). She herself was remarkably in line with this principled\napproach. So while it is true that, in the main, she rejects Cartesian\nnatural philosophy, she is still appreciative of Descartes'\nadvances in, for example, geometry, dioptrics and method (IP\nAvant-Propos V, p.\n 118).[2]\n\n\nOne interesting element of what could be characterized as her\nadmiration of Descartes' method is that the Foundations\nfairly closely tracks the structure of Descartes' project in his\nPrinciples of Philosophy. Both texts start with indubitable\nprinciples of knowledge, which, in the first instance, lead to\nconclusions about the metaphysics of God. These conclusions allow one\nto gain knowledge of the metaphysical structure of the world, which in\nturn grounds physical laws that allow the observer to make scientific\nsense of the world (Lascano 2011, 742\u20133; c.f. Zinsser 2006,\n173). This underscores at least that the two thinkers had a shared\ninterest in developing a unified natural philosophy with a well-worked\nout, and fairly robust, metaphysics detailed first. Another highly\nplausible reading of Du Ch\u00e2telet's mimicking of Descartes'\nmature work is that she sees herself offering a new natural philosophy\nto replace the largely rejected Cartesian system, just as Descartes\nbefore her aimed to replace the old Scholastic natural philosophy with\nhis Principles of Philosophy. This interpretation is born out\nby a comparison of the two texts, for there are important divergences\nbetween them, not just on the details in the metaphysics, but also on\nthe range of topics addressed. For Descartes' forays into what we\nwould now call \u201cscience\u201d included not only astronomy and\nphysics, but planned sections on living bodies and on the human being,\nincluding its soul, thus promising to touch on topics such as human\nhealth and morals (in keeping with his metaphor of the tree of\nphilosophy offered in the preface to the Principles). In\ncontrast, Du Ch\u00e2telet's text deals exclusively with physics,\nleaving the broader array of natural philosophical topics and moral\nphilosophy left untouched. Still, the overall similarity in structure\nbetween the two texts indicates her affinity, at least with respect to\nher overall project, with Descartes. Here, we examine a few crucial\nmoments in her Foundations, underscoring how she and\nDescartes compare and contrast on these points, with an eye to showing\nsome central aspects of her own brand of natural philosophy, and some\nof the ways in which Du Ch\u00e2telet fit (and did not fit) into the\nFrench Enlightenment (especially with regard to Newtonianism and\nscientific methodology).\n2. First Principles of Knowledge\n\n\nDescartes famously writes in the preface to the Principles\nthat \u201cthe whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other special sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics, and morals\u201d (AT\nVIIIa, 14; CSM 1, 186). Metaphysics is his starting point, but\nwhat Descartes means by metaphysics, and what falls under the\nrubric of metaphysics for him, is crucial to understanding his project,\nand for understanding Du Ch\u00e2telet's conceptual relation to\nhim. One of the central innovations Descartes makes in the field of\nmetaphysics is to include metaphysical claims about the mind of the\nknowing subject (Hatfield 1990, 11\u201317). This element of metaphysics\nleads Descartes very quickly into a discussion of first principles of\nknowledge, such as his belief that the knowing subject is capable of\nrationally intuiting further metaphysical principles because God has\nimplanted innate ideas about them within human souls.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's starting point\u2014her first chapter\nof the Foundations\u2014is also a consideration of first\nprinciples, but she starts immediately with first principles of\nknowledge, and hers are very different from Descartes'. Indeed,\nher first principles are distinctively Leibnizian and Wolffian, and\nnumber exactly two; they are the principle of contradiction (hereafter\nPC) and the principle of sufficient reason (hereafter PSR). In what\nfollows, we present some general ideas that are helpful to bear in\nmind when thinking about Du Ch\u00e2telet's use of the PC and\nPSR. We then draw some important conclusions regarding these principles\nas they are found in Wolff, noting points on which Wolff departs from\nLeibniz with regard to first principles of knowledge. And finally, we\nturn to a consideration of how Du Ch\u00e2telet employs these\nprinciples in her work.\n\n\nThere are a number of different ways of articulating the PC,\nincluding the\n following.[3]\n\nA is A, and cannot be ~A.\nFor any proposition P, it is not the case that P is\nboth true and false.\nFor any proposition P, P is either true or\nfalse.\nFor any proposition P, if P is false, then ~P\nis true.\nFor any proposition P, if P implies a contradiction,\nthen P is false.\nFor any proposition P, if P is or is reducible to an\nidentical proposition, then P is true.\n\n\n\n(1) equates the PC with the Principle of Identity. (3) through (5)\nbring together the Law of Non-Contradiction (hereafter LNC) and the Law\nof the Excluded Middle (hereafter LEM) within the PC. These versions of\nthe PC rely upon opposition based in contradictories. That is,\nP and ~P are mutually inconsistent and cannot be both true (LNC), and\nthey are mutually exhaustive (LEM). (6) relies upon the LNC only, and\nnot the LEM. This formulation of the PC, that is, relies upon\nopposition based in contraries. For example, \u201cP is\nhappy\u201d, and \u201cP is sad\u201d are contraries and thus\nmutually inconsistent and cannot both be true (LNC). But they are not\nmutually exhaustive, because they both can be false (and thus,\nthe LEM does not hold in these cases). The PC can be intended as a\nlogical, ontological or psychological principle. As a logical\nprinciple, the PC is about opposite assertions. As an ontological\nprinciple, the PC is about properties in a subject.\nAs a psychological principle, the PC is about what is possible and,\nespecially, impossible to believe. Finally, the PC can operate in\ndifferent realms. For example, it can operate in the realm of\nmodality, perhaps serving to pick out necessary truths.\nAlternatively, it can operate in the realm of standard areas of\nhuman inquiry, perhaps serving as the foundation of mathematics\n(but perhaps not in metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines).\n\n\nAs with the PC, there are different ways of articulating the PSR,\nincluding the\n following.[4]\n\nThere is nothing that is without a reason why it is, and is not\notherwise. (Also: For any fact or event that obtains or exists, there\nis some reason why it obtains or exists, and is not otherwise.)\nThere is no effect without a cause. (Also: any existing thing\nmust have something, either within its nature or outside of itself, as\nits cause.)\nFor any proposition P that is true, there is an explanation for\nits truth.\nIt is impossible to fail to account for something if you have\nenough information (even though humans often do not have\nenough information).\nThere are no brute facts.\n\n\n\nThe PSR embodies the position that everything is explainable and\nthus intelligible. The PSR can also be used to explain a number of\ndifferent things, including the coherence of a thing's\nessence, that essences have a cause, and the\nexistence of things. These points can also be captured by the\ndepiction of the PSR as the principle which accounts both for the\npossibility of things (i.e. due to the coherence of their\nessences), and for the actualization of essences (i.e. there\nis a cause of their actualization which thus brings them into\nexistence). Sometimes the PSR is taken to have a very wide\ndomain (e.g. all truths and all events), while sometimes the PSR is\ntaken to have a narrower domain. For example, the domain of the PSR is\nsometimes only events, but not truths, even while some truths (but not\nmathematical truths) can be translated into events. Or, as another\nexample, sometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be only the domain\nof contingent truths but not necessary truths.\nSometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be all truths,\nwith the sufficient reason for the truth of necessary truths being that\ntheir negation violates the PC. There are different ways of thinking of\nthe relation between the PC and the PSR, the two most prominent being,\nfirst, that the PC and the PSR are equally fundamental, and, second,\nthat only the PC is fundamental, with the PSR either playing a role of\nsecondary importance or being derived from or proven by the PC.\nFinally, as with the PC, the PSR can operate in different realms. For\nexample, it can operate in the realm of modality, perhaps\nserving to explain contingent truths. Alternatively, it can operate in\nthe realm of standard areas of human inquiry, perhaps serving\nas the foundation of metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines (but not mathematics).\n\n\nAs should be clear from the above, there is no single and settled\nversion of either the PC or the PSR, different thinkers employ them\ndifferently, and sometimes a single thinker employs them differently in\ndifferent periods of their thought or in different texts and contexts.\nIn what follows, we sketch one respectable interpretation of\nWolff's use of these principles\u2014together with notes on\nwhere he departs from Leibniz's (admittedly multi-faceted) use of\nthe principles\u2014at least in part because Wolff's approach\ndoes seem to be fairly close to Du Ch\u00e2telet's own.\n\n\nFor Wolff,[5] the\nPC is fundamental, and it is an innate first\nprinciple. Methodologically, Wolff starts with the psychological\nimpossibility of believing or judging that something both is and is\nnot. Wolff thus accepts version number 2 above of the PC, and he\nstarts with the first person awareness of one's psychological\ninability to not accept the PC so presented. This psychological\nawareness further reveals the logical impossibility of any proposition\nthat asserts that something is both true and false at the same time,\nand the logical impossibility of a proposition that asserts contraries\nfurther reveals the ontological fact that something cannot have\ncontrary properties.  The PC first and primary job, then, for Wolff is\nto divide impossible concepts and things\u2014concepts and things\nthat embody a contradiction\u2014from possible concepts and\nthings\u2014concepts and things that do not embody a\ncontradiction. Possible concepts for Wolff include both necessary\ntruths and contingent truths.  Thus, the fundamental and first job of\nthe PC for Wolff includes the work of dividing both necessary and\ncontingent truths from impossible truths. As result, in the realm of\nmodality, the PC serves to identify not only necessary truths, but\nalso contingent truths, pace Leibniz for whom, in the realm\nof modality, the PC serves to identify necessary truths. Once\nimpossible concepts and things are isolated from the rest, the PSR\nenters to further explain aspects of possible things.  It does so in\ntwo ways. First, the PSR acts as a \u201cprinciple of being\u201d in\nthe sense that there is a sufficient reason to explain the essence of\nany possible being; there is a sufficient reason why a being's essence\nis as it is. This role for the PSR is relevant in the case of both\nnecessary beings and contingent beings, and on this point, Wolff once\nagain divergences from Leibniz in that the latter often (though not\nalways) restricts the role of the PSR to that of providing an\nexplanation for why contingent beings, though not necessary beings,\nare as they are. For Leibniz (usually), the PC explains why necessary\nbeings (and truths) are as they are. Still, the divide between Wolff\nand Leibniz on this point may be narrower than it seems, because for\nWolff, the sufficient reason why a necessary being is as it is just is\nthat the PC establishes this. The second way in which the PSR enters\nthe picture to further explain aspects of possible things for Wolff is\nthat it acts as a \u201cprinciple of becoming\u201d. In this role,\nthe PSR gives the causes or grounds for why a possible being becomes\nactual as opposed to remaining possible but non-actual.\n\n\nWith this general background on our two great principles in place,\ntogether with how these principles operate in Wolff (sometimes in\ncontrast with how they operate in Leibniz),  we now turn to a\nconsideration of how these principles operate in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's opening chapter of the Foundations.\nWhile we cannot here do full justice to Du Ch\u00e2telet's\naccount of the first principles of knowledge, we  provide some essential\nbackground to these principles in order to set the stage for an\nevaluation of other central aspects of her natural philosophy as\npresented in the Foundations.\n\n\nAs with Leibniz and Wolff, Du Ch\u00e2telet's two primary first\nprinciples of knowledge are the PC\u2014\u2018the basic axiom upon\nwhich all truths are founded\u2019, which is consequently the\nfoundation of all certainty (\u00a74)\u2014and the PSR (\u00a78).\nThese two principles operate not by opening up a category of\nmetaphysical truths that are innate to our minds. Rather, they operate\nby giving universal (perhaps one would want to call these\ninnate)[6]\nprocedures for delineating what is possible from what is\nimpossible, and then for determining what is necessary and what is\nactual (as opposed to non-actual) from among the range of\npossibilities. Du Ch\u00e2telet's first use of the PC, then, is\ndecidedly Wolffian for its task is to separate the impossible from the\npossible.\n\n\nThe PC is foundational in all our thinking. At its most basic, this\nprinciple seems to be, for Du Ch\u00e2telet, the principle that: for\nany proposition P, if P implies a contradiction, then P is false (5\nabove): \u2018For, if one once granted that something may exist and\nnot exist at the same time, there would no longer be any\ntruth\u2026\u2019 (IP \u00a74). According to Du Ch\u00e2telet once\nthis principle as stated is acknowledged, one can divide claims into\nthe impossible and the possible: \u2018It follows from this\n[principle] that the impossible is that which implies contradiction,\nand the possible does not imply it at all\u2019 (IP \u00a75). The\npossibles include the possibilities from among which God created the\nworld.\n\n\nBut the PC does more work for Du Ch\u00e2telet than just separating\nout the possible from the impossible, and on this point, she leans more\ntoward Leibniz's use of this principle than toward Wolff's\nuse of it, for the PC secondarily divides the category of the possible\ninto truths that are necessary from those that are contingent. At this\nsecond stage, she seems to be employing a new conception of the PC. To\nshow this, we examine her way of distinguishing between necessary and\ncontingent truths. Necessary truths are \u2018truths which can only be\ndetermined in a single way, for this is what is meant by the term\nnecessary\u2019 (IP \u00a77). Immediately after this\n(admittedly odd) definition she contrasts necessary truths with\ncontingent truths, \u2018that is to say, when a thing can exist in\nvarious ways\u2019 (IP \u00a77), indicating that necessary truths are\nclaims about things that can exist in only one way. To use her own\nexamples to further clarify (IP \u00a78), geometrical truths are\nnecessary because, for example, a triangle (generally conceived) can\nexist in only one way, i.e., it is a figure whose three angles added\ntogether are equal to the sum of two right angles. We cannot conceive\nof it in any other way. Conversely, truths about the posture Du\nCh\u00e2telet finds herself in are contingent because she can exist in\nmany ways, i.e., standing, sitting, lying down and so forth. Implicit\nhere is a version of the PC which states that for any proposition P if\nP is or is reducible to an identical proposition, then P\nis necessarily true (6 above, with the modality of necessity\nadded). For \u2018triangle\u2019 and \u2018a figure whose three\nangles added together are equal to the sum of two right angles\u2019\ncan be reduced to an identity statement (triangles can exist only in\nthat one way) while \u2018Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019 and \u2018sitting\ndown\u2019 cannot be reduced to an identity statement (Du\nCh\u00e2telet can exist in many other\nways).[7] A\ncrucial lesson to be drawn from her approach just outlined is that she\ntakes the human's everyday experience\u2014including our\npsychological inability to imagine, for example, necessary geometrical\ntruths differently than how they are\u2014as telling us something\nmetaphysically true about the world itself. That is, like Wolff, she\nstarts with a psychological rendition of the PC, but draws ontological\nconclusions from this starting point.\n\n\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the PSR is \u2018[t]he principle on\nwhich all contingent truths depend\u2026\u2019 (IP \u00a78). Given\nwhat follows, the most consistent way to interpret Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nclaim here is not to assume that the PSR picks out all\ncontingent truths, for this is clearly the work of the PC (when that\nlatter principle is used to identify necessary truths, with the\nleftovers therefore being contingent). Rather, Du Ch\u00e2telet seems\nquite clearly to mean that the PSR explains why the contingent truths\nthat actually obtain in the world do obtain. Thus, she seems\nto accept the second of Wolff's ways in which the PSR further explains\naspects of possible things: the PSR acts as a \u201cprinciple of\nbecoming\u201d. It also acts as a \u201cprinciple of being\u201d in\nso far as it explains essences, but it explains the essences of\ncontingent things, while the essences of necessary things are\nexplained by the PC for her (pace Wolff, but in keeping with\nLeibniz's usual approach). So, immediately after her definition of the\nPSR given above, she writes that:\n\n\nWhen asking someone to account for his actions, we persist with our\nown question until we obtain a reason that satisfies us, and in all\ncases we feel that we cannot force our mind to accept something without\na sufficient reason, that is to say, without a reason that makes us\nunderstand why the thing is what it is, rather than something\ncompletely different. (IP\u00a78, emphasis added)\n\n\nAccording to this interpretation of the PSR, it is the principle\nthat explains why some contingent truths actually obtain while others\ndo not (there is no sufficient reason for these others to obtain). The\nPSR is also the reason that led God to actualize this world from among the\nvarious possibilities (IP \u00a79); that is, to reiterate the\ninterpretation offered here, it is the principle that explains why our\ncontingent universe exists rather than any number of other such\npossible, but not necessary, universes. The PSR serves as (a) the principle of\nbecoming (b) of contingent beings only.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet indicates what the PSR requires of us as\ninvestigators of nature. In the closing sections of her chapter on the\nnature of body (\u00a7162\u20134), she makes clear that since full\nknowledge of contingent truths is too complex for humans to grasp\nthrough rational intuition (IP \u00a79), we need to turn to some other\nway of learning them. But because God is bound by the PSR, we cannot\nappeal directly to his will as the \u2018explanation\u2019 of these\ntruths, and so we must turn to proximate causes rather than the\nultimate cause for explanation. We must investigate nature in order to\ntry to discern causes of effects\u2014that is, in order to discern\nthe sufficient reason why effects obtain. Empirical observations that\nwe have of how bodies actually do operate in the actual world will\nlead the investigator to beliefs about features of bodies. These\nfeatures, however, are not taken to be certainly true as a result of\ntheir being supposedly known by introspection into our innate ideas\n(as they are for Descartes). It may be, therefore, that we are unable\nto know the sufficient reason for why actuals exist as they do exist,\nthough we surely know that there is a reason, for our\nexperience tells us that actual beings were chosen to exist rather\nthan not to exist.  But God knows the sufficient reason, and it is the\nreason why he actualized the beings that he did: \u201cWithout the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, one would no longer be able to say\nthat this universe, whose parts are so interconnected, could only be\nproduced by a supreme wisdom, for if there can be effects without\nsufficient reason, all might have been produced by accident, that is\nto say, by nothing\u201d (IP \u00a78, p. 129).\n\n\nTwo important aspects of Du Ch\u00e2telet's broader philosophy are\ncaptured by this passage just quoted. The first is that she takes the\nnatural world to be a whole whose parts are systematically\ninterconnected. This natural systematicity is crucial to her\nscientific method, it sets her apart from many of her French\nEnlightenment peers, but there are nonetheless important limits to her\nwillingness to call upon systematicity in her approach to\ninvestigations of the natural world.  We address these points in\n\u00a75 and \u00a76 below. The second important point implicit in the\nabove-cited passage is that she clearly sides with what we would now\ncall the intellectualist side of the voluntarist-intellectualist\ndebate. Crudely, the debate centers around whether God's will or God's\nintellect takes precedence in his actions with respect to the created\nworld, including the act of creation itself. A voluntarist would say\nthat God's will takes precedence, and God could will anything to be\nthe case. Whatever he wills just would be true and\ngood because he willed it. Thus, God could have willed 2+2=5\nto be true, and it would thereby be true. Conversely, an\nintellectualist would say that God's intellect takes precedence in his\nactions with respect to creation, including creation itself. He first\nunderstands what is true and good, and then he wills that certain\nthings should attain\nbecause his intellect understands the truth and goodness of\nthem (and his benevolence guides his choice). Earlier, Du\nCh\u00e2telet wavered on how to interpret the relation between God's\nwill and intellect, but by the time she wrote the\nFoundations, she had clearly settled for the intellectualist\nside, and the PSR guides God in his choices no less than it guides\nhumans. On this point, she is squarely in opposition to Voltaire who\nsuggests that we should not search for, in his words,\n\u201csufficient causes\u201d in nature for natural phenomena;\nrather we should bear in mind that the first cause of nature's\nactivities is to be referred to God's will and\n power.[8] \nIt is enough to appeal\nto this as the source of phenomena, and then leave it at that. Du\nCh\u00e2telet dissents from this approach, and not just because it\nmistakes, in her view, God's nature. Rather, it is an appeal we ought\nnot to make as scientists (IP \u00a7162), for it is an\nutterly unscientific approach to a natural problem, putting the cause\nof the phenomena wholly beyond our ability to investigate \n it.[9] \nWe return to this point in \u00a75 below.\n\n\nTwo further points are of particular importance in Du Ch\u00e2telet's\ndiscussion of first principle of knowledge. The first is her noting\nthat the term \u201cprinciple\u201d \u201chas been much\nabused\u201d, especially by \u201cthe Scholastics, who could\ndemonstrate nothing [and who] chose unintelligible words for their\nprinciples\u201d (IP \u00a71, p. 125). The PSR, she later tells us,\nbanishes these unintelligible principles such as \u201cplastic\nnatures, vegetative souls\u201d (IP \u00a710, p. 131). Without\ndetailing how the PSR might banish such other principles, we focus on\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's own conception of the sort of intelligible\nmetaphysical principle identified by the PSR, for she favors\nthe mechanical philosophy over, for example, plastic natures and\nvegetative souls. According to Du Ch\u00e2telet, one must explain how\na mechanism can produce a plant relying, for example, upon an\nexplanation of how each particle of matter is able to produce the\neffect that it does (IP \u00a710 and \u00a712, p. 131\u20132) through\nsimple motion. Accounting for natural change by appeal to bits of\nmatter interacting through lawful motion and contact\u2014but not by\nappeal to plastic natures and vegetative souls\u2014is consistent\nwith the PSR.\n\n\nThe second point of particular importance in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's discussion of first principles of knowledge is\nwhat may be taken as her moderate form of nativism, in contrast with\nDescartes' much stronger form. Du Ch\u00e2telet does not have the\nsort of first principles of knowledge, together with a commitment to\nvoluntarism, that lead to the doctrine of innate ideas, as we see in\nDescartes. That is, Descartes has been characterized as a voluntarist\nwho believes that God created the eternal truths through an act of\nwill; God did not understand, through an act of the intellect, that the\neternal truths just are true independently of any will, his own\nincluded. Fine details on Descartes' position with respect to the\nvoluntarist-intellectual debate aside, it is true that he does believe\nGod endowed all rational creatures with innate ideas of the eternal\ntruths such that we might all come to know their certain truth despite\nthe fact that they could have been otherwise. Du Ch\u00e2telet does\nnot endorse this kind of nativism. But it is true that, unlike Locke\nfor\n example,[10]\nshe does think there are some\nuniversally held principles such as the belief that something cannot be\nand not be at the same time (PC), and to this degree, she does seem\ncommitted to some sort of nativism. But because of her requirement that\none demonstrate a contradiction (in the case of the PC) or\nthat one demonstrate the reasons one has for one's\nactions (in the case of the PSR, e.g. IP \u00a78, p. 128\u20139) in\nemploying these universally-held first principles of knowledge, her\nnativism is of a different and weaker form than is Descartes'\nnativism. Hers describes innate rules of reasoning that (as we shall\nsee) can then be used to develop a metaphysics, while Descartes'\nnativism directly delivers robust metaphysical information about the\nworld. Once again, we see shall the impact of this characteristic of Du\nCh\u00e2telet's starting point upon her methodology as well as\nher understanding of the relation between physics and metaphysics.\n\n3. God\n\n\nOne of Descartes' first metaphysical first principles that he\nproves is the existence and nature (as benevolent) of God. His primary\nreason for this is to call upon a benevolent God as a guarantor of the\ntruth of his clear and distinct ideas. Immediately after her\ndiscussion of her first principles of knowledge, Du Ch\u00e2telet\nalso turns to metaphysical first principles that can be derived from\nthe epistemology, and she too turns to a proof for the existence and\nnature of God. But her reasons for doing so are different from\nDescartes' immediate reasons as just articulated. For Du\nCh\u00e2telet, as Marcy Lascano has rightly argued, \u201cwanted to\nprovide a ground for physics that would explain the rational basis of\nthe workings of the universe. Proving that an eternal, good and\nrational being created the universe would provide such a ground\u201d\n(Lascano 2011, 743). In Du Ch\u00e2telet's words, \u201c[t]he study\nof nature elevates us to the knowledge of the supreme being; this\ngreat truth is even more necessary, if possible, to good physics than\nto morality, and it ought to be the foundation and conclusion of all\nthe research we make in this science\u201d (IP \u00a718, p. 138). As\nshown above, Du Ch\u00e2telet believes in the interconnectedness and\nsystematicity of the natural world as a whole, and she believes that\nthis is a crucial general reason why God has chosen to actualize this\nworld. And so, it seems humans do have cognitive access to\nthis sufficient reason for why God chose this world as opposed to any\nother world. In fact, Du Ch\u00e2telet links the interconnectedness\nand systematicity of the natural world as a whole with perfection\n(\u00a726), thus indicating that God's sufficient reason for his\nchoice of this world over any other possible worlds in a further\nprinciple, namely, the Principle of the Best. Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nbelief in the interconnectedness and systematicity of the natural\nworld as a whole is the key to her method and physics, even though\n(as shown below) there are limits to the role that can be played in\nphysics by these metaphysical features of the world. Nonetheless,\nestablishing the existence of God as one who would choose to actualize\nsuch a world is Du Ch\u00e2telet's next crucial step.\n\n\nWe shall not go into the details of her argument for the existence and\nnature of God (see Lascano 2011). We simply note here that hers is a\ncosmological argument for the existence of God, specifically one\nstarting from the existence in the world of contingent beings. Thus,\nher distinction between necessity and contingency as developed in her\nmaterial on the PC and the PSR, together with further use of the PSR\nin her chapter on God, lead to her particular proof for God's\nexistence.  She argues:\n All that exists has a sufficient reason for its\nexistence. The sufficient reason for the existence of a being must be\nwithin it, or outside it. Now the reason for the existence of a\ncontingent being cannot be within it, for if it carried the sufficient\nreason for its own existence, it would be impossible for it not to\nexist, which is contradictory to the definition of a contingent\nbeing. So the sufficient reason for the existence of a contingent\nbeing must necessarily be outside it\u2026. This sufficient reason\ncannot be found in another contingent being, nor in a succession of\nsuch beings, since the same question will always arise at the end of\nthis chain, however it may be extended. So it must come from a\nnecessary Being that contains the sufficient reason for the existence\nof all contingent beings, and for his own existence, and this being is\nGod. (IP \u00a719.5\u20136, p. 139, translation altered)\n\n\nLascano has noted the influence of both Leibniz and Locke on Du\nCh\u00e2telet's cosmological proof (Lascano 2011,\npassim). She also notes that Du Ch\u00e2telet makes a similar\nmistake to one Aquinas makes in his Five Ways, in assuming that an\ninfinite chain of causes cannot simply extend into the past with no\nneed of a supermundane cause (Lascano 2011, 756). It is a shame that Du\nCh\u00e2telet's acquaintance with the ideas of Samuel Clarke\n(Hutton 2012) did not extend as far as his cosmological proof from\ncontingency to necessity for the existence of God, for if it had, then\nperhaps she would have sidestepped this error. Nonetheless, again as\nLascano points out, her proof is a notable improvement on\nLocke's, and the key point to be drawn from her discussion of\nGod is that articulated above, namely the importance to Du\nCh\u00e2telet's scientific endeavors of God and the nature of\nthe world he creates.\n4. Metaphysics\n\n\nIn the preface to the Foundations, Du Ch\u00e2telet writes:\n\u201cIt is certain that there are a number of points in metaphysics\nwhich lend themselves to demonstrations just as rigorous as the\ndemonstrations of geometry, even if they are different in kind\u201d\n(Avant-propos, XII). Du Ch\u00e2telet's first\nepistemological principles thus help to establish what she takes to be\nthe certain truth of some metaphysical claims. At least two of these\nclaims, she believes, are necessarily true (see below for the kind of\nnecessity at work here). So, for example, and echoing Leibniz, because\nof the infinite divisibility of extension, and because atoms are\nextended, atoms cannot be the ultimate beings of nature; simple\nsubstances (or monads) must be such beings, and the PC establishes\nthis necessary (in Du Ch\u00e2telet's mind) metaphysical\nfact (IP \u00a7121). The argument for this runs as follows. Atoms,\ndefined as indivisible, extended particles of matter are\nactually divisible, and thus their very definition, taken\ntogether with the fact of their divisibility, implies a contradiction.\nSo atoms cannot be the necessary beings out of which matter is\ncomposed; indeed, they are by definition impossible. How does Du\nCh\u00e2telet justify the claim to atoms' divisibility? She justifies\nthis claim based upon the PC: \u2018there is no contradiction in the\ndivisibility of extended things,\u2019 and atoms are extended thing\n(IP \u00a7121). Notice here, she must be relying upon a conceptual\ndivisibility rather than a physical divisibility (for atoms are\ndefined as physically indivisible), though one could bolster\nthis argument by claiming that if an atom is conceptually divisible by\nus, then it is physically divisible by an omnipotence God, and\ntherefore is in neither way indivisible. Indeed, the divisibility of\nanything\u2014atoms or something else\u2014that is extended\nindicates that extension is composed and not simple; it is\ncomposed out of the parts into which it can be divided (IP\n\u00a7120). So nothing extended\u2014neither atoms nor any other\npiece of extension\u2014can serve as the simple beings out of which\ncomposed beings are made. Only things that are unextended can serve as\nthose simple beings (IP \u00a7122). Since this conclusion follows from\nthe PC, it is a conclusion about the necessary constitution\nof the simple beings of our universe.\n\n\nThis introduces a further feature of Du Ch\u00e2telet's PC in\naddition to those identified above. The PC, in the case of simple\nbeings, establishes both the necessary existence and\nnature of simple beings. That is, simple beings are\nnecessarily unextended (their nature), and they necessarily must exist\nso as to explain the fact of existing composed, extended\nbeings\u2014a fact established by our experience that such composed\nbeings do indeed exist. But this is what we might call a\nhypothetical necessity (as opposed to what we might call an\nabsolute necessity). That is, these necessary facts about the\nsimple beings of our world obtain only on the hypothesis that our\nworld actually does exist. God could have not created our world, and\nhad he so chosen to not create any world, then simple beings which\nactually exist (with the nature of being unextended) need not have\nexisted at all.\n\n\nThis discussion of Du Ch\u00e2telet's understanding of the (hypothetically) \nnecessary metaphysical constitution of the world further underscores a\npoint about her first principles of knowledge mentioned above. While\nthe fundamental metaphysical truth that only unextended beings can\nserve as the simple beings of the created world\u2014simple beings\nout of which complex beings are made\u2014may be repugnant to sense\nand imagination, reason (as captured by her PC in this case) demands we\nbelieve it (IP \u00a7135). But this indicates that Du \nCh\u00e2telet\u2014like Wolff\u2014may start with a psychological conception of\nthe PC, but (again like Wolff), she takes this psychological conception\nof the principle to indicate that there are underlying logical and\nontological truths which are the source of our psychological response\nto contradictions. So one of Du Ch\u00e2telet's first\nprinciples, in this case, gives us knowledge of metaphysical essences.\nImportantly, Du Ch\u00e2telet takes her conclusion that substances\nmust be simple in the way just characterized to be necessarily\ntrue on the hypothesis that God chooses to actualize our world.\n\n\nMoreover, she even uses her PSR to establish other claims about\nmaterial substance, claims that she also takes to be necessary in the\nsame sense of necessity that applies to simple beings (i.e. what we\nmay call \"hypothetical necessity\" above). In using the PSR, we observe the\nphenomenal facts of our actual world, and we can then posit hypotheses\nabout what must further be true of substance in order to make those\nfacts \n possible.[11]\n We see this method at work in several\nsections of the Institutions; for example, monads are active,\nshe concludes, because this would explain the brute fact of motion in\nthe phenomenal world, and she goes so far as to claim that force is\nalso necessary to the nature of matter (IP \u00a7139). At the same\ntime, precisely because things do not always move in the natural\nworld, this force must be of two kinds: active force\u2014the source\nof motion\u2014and passive force, or inertia\u2014the source of rest\n(IP \u00a7142). From her letter to Maupertuis of 30 April 1738 (#122),\nwe know that she was familiar with Leibniz's work on dynamics and\nmetaphysics, having sought out his articles on the\ntopics\u2014articles such as \u201cThe Brief Demonstration of the\nError of Descartes\u201d and \u201cA Specimen of Dynamics\u201d. So\nagain, phenomena of our actual world that Leibniz details in those\npapers lead Du Ch\u00e2telet to the same conclusions regarding the\nmetaphysics of substance that Leibniz reaches\u2014namely, that the\nunextended simple substances are also internally active, as well as\nconstrained in their activity, through their possession of active and\npassive force, as this claim helps explain the phenomena of the\nnatural\n world.[12]\n\n\nPrecisely because the elements of matter are simple, unextended active\nmonads, what we see around us as extended must be merely phenomenal,\nand she does endorse this \n Leibnizian-Wolffian[13]\nconclusion.\nThroughout her seventh chapter \u201cOn the Elements of Body\u201d,\nshe follows the Leibnizian tradition in concluding that metaphysical\nreality must consist in unextended monads. Consequently, what we see\nin nature as extended must be mere phenomena and not real in the\nfullest metaphysical sense. She concludes, for example, that\nphenomena, known best through sense, result from the confusion of\nsimple beings (IP \u00a7152\u20135), and that just as monads are\ncharacterized by active and passive force (now termed primitive\nforce), so too are phenomenal bodies to be thought of as possessing\nforce\u2014both derivative active and passive force (IP\n\u00a7158\u20139). Thus, suppositions such as Newton's that the\nnatural world can be described with reference to inelastic, invisible,\nextended atoms must be suppositions not about ground floor metaphysics\nbut about the derivative physical world which is merely\nphenomenal in a broadly Leibnizian sense. This has led Linda\nJanik to helpfully characterize Du Ch\u00e2telet's account of the\ncreated world as a three-tier account (Janik 1982, 106): the basic\nmetaphysical tier of unextended monads, the subvisible physical tier\nof (for Du Ch\u00e2telet) extended matter which is also imbued with\nderivative force, and the visible physical tier of bodies in motion\nand at rest. Without working through the details of her picture,\nincluding the coherence or difficulties with it, what this three-tier\naccount permits is significant separation between metaphysics and\nphysics. We see this when we consider the following. We can know\nthat there is a systematic interconnection among all elements\nof the created world\u2014the PSR, together with what we can derive\nof God's nature seem to establish this for Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2014we\ncannot always know all the details of that systematicity. Moreover, we\ncan expect that this systematicity occurs most fundamentally at the\nlevel of ground floor metaphysics\u2014that is, among unextended\nmonads. But Du Ch\u00e2telet does not spell out in detail how exactly\nthe metaphysical tier and physical tiers are related to each other\n(Iltis 1977, 36\u20137). And so, while the systematic\ninterconnectedness we experience at the level of phenomena\u2014the\nrealm of physics, that is\u2014surely has some grounding in\nmetaphysics, crucially, we cannot know many details of the connection\namong realms. While it is certainly true that there is some connection\nbetween the metaphysics and physics\u2014for example, the force,\nwhich belongs to monads explains the brute phenomena of motion and\nrest in the physical world\u2014physics does enjoy significant\nautonomy from metaphysics (Janik 1982, 106; Barber 1967, \n 209).[14] \nWe see the impact of\nthis on her physics in \u00a76 below.\n5. Scientific Methodology\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet herself spent time running extensive experiments to\ngain understanding of various natural phenomena. She set up a lab at\nher estate Cirey in which she and Voltaire both undertook experiments\n(e.g. Walters 1967). Her descriptions of experiments undertaken to\ndetermine the nature and propagation of fire in her Dissertation\non the Nature and Propagation of Fire attest to this fact. She\nwas also well educated on scientific advancements of her day, most\nespecially in astronomy and physics. Her comments in the\nFoundations on scientific methodology focus primarily on her\nanalysis of the method of great astronomers and physicists. Here, we\nfocus on her explicit theorizing on the role of hypotheses in science,\nfor her views on this topic place her clearly at the start of the\nhypothetico-deductive tradition in scientific methodology.\n\n\nAt the close of her chapter on hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\n writes: [15]\n\n\nAnd so good hypotheses will always be the product of the greatest\nmen. Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Descartes, Leibniz, and even Newton\nhimself, have all devised useful hypotheses to explain complicated and\ndifficult phenomena. The example of these great men, and of their\nsuccesses, should make us see that those who wish to ban hypotheses\nfrom philosophy, intend harm to the interests of science\u201d\n(IP\n \u00a771).[16]\n\n\n\nIn this declaration, Du Ch\u00e2telet establishes how out of \nstep\u2014though not necessarily entirely to her detriment\u2014she was\nwith her own milieu. Members of the Royal Society in Britain and\nAcademie Royale in France in the 18th century tended to\neschew the use of hypotheses, preferring what they took to be a\nscientific focus on empirical\n facts.[17]\nMoreover, Newton was seen by\nmany of his admiring contemporaries to have captured the value of the\nSocieties\u2019 approach in his scientific practice and in his famous\n motto hypotheses non\n fingo.[18]\nAmong the most vocal\nspokespersons in eighteenth century France for this approach was none\nother than Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s housemate during her years spent\ndrafting the Foundations, Voltaire who, in his Elements of\nNewton\u2019s Philosophy, contrasts Descartes and Newton along\nexactly these\n lines.[19]\nIn siding with the use of\nhypotheses, in once again lauding Descartes for this aspect of\nhis\n method,[20]\nand in suggesting that\nNewton himself makes use of hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet establishes\nherself as no mere mimic of \u2018greater\u2019 men of her time. The\nfact that this highly innovative chapter survives her massive rewrites\nafter her tutelage under Koenig also throws into question the doubt\ncast upon her originality by Koenig's charge of\nplagiarism. Indeed, close examination of the manuscript of what\nremains of Du Ch\u00e2telet's earliest version of the\nFoundations in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France\ndiscloses that her chapter on hypothesis is much more well-worked out\nthan surrounding chapters, many of which have two significantly edited\ndrafts. This indicates that she may have fairly clear ideas on this\nchapter, even while her thoughts on the rest of the first half of the\nbook are in considerable\n flux.[21]\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet distinguishes those who use hypotheses well from\nthose who use them badly, and she recognizes a third \ngroup\u2014those who eschew the use of hypotheses altogether largely due to\nperceived misuse of them among their predecessors and contemporaries.\nAmong those who use hypotheses poorly are those working in the\nCartesian tradition and those in \u201cthe Schools\u201d who are\nespecially guilty of spouting unintelligible jargon (IP\nAvant-Propos VIII, \u00a755). The key downfalls of those who\nmake bad use of hypotheses are the mistakes of taking them as truth (IP\n\u00a762\u201363), and of building theories and systems upon them that\nresemble \u201cfables\u201d and \u201cdreams\u201d (IP \u00a755)\nmore than they resemble a science of nature firmly rooted in empirical\nknowledge of nature. As a consequence of previous abuse of hypotheses,\nDu Ch\u00e2telet notes that many in her own century have entirely\nshied away from their use\u2014or at least claim to have done \nso\u2014which they regard as (quoting Newton) the \u201cpoison of\nreason and the plague of philosophy\u201d (IP \u00a755). Du\nCh\u00e2telet stresses that it is a mistake, however, to believe that\nhypotheses are useless in physics just because they have been abused in\nthe past (IP \u00a763), and she suggests that hypothetical thinking is\nnot only useful, but indeed necessary; without hypotheses, almost no progress\nwould have been made in astronomy (IP Avant-Propos VIII,\n\u00a757), and they are also valuable in physics (IP \u00a755). She\neven goes so far as to claim \u201cwithout hypotheses\u2026 there\nwould be no astronomy now\u201d (IP \u00a757). To bolster her case,\nshe details a few recent successes in astronomy which relied pivotally\non the use of hypotheses with theories of Copernicus (IP \u00a757 and\n\u00a767), Kepler (IP \u00a758) and Huygens (IP \u00a757 and \u00a767)\nfeatured as evidence. Those who refuse to include hypothetical thinking\nin their scientific method are guilty of retarding the progress of\nscience no less than are those who include such thinking but do so\nbadly (IP \u00a754).\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet believes that hypotheses are necessary\nbecause not all phenomena can be explained through reliance upon first\nprinciples alone\u2014there is a gap between first principles and\nobserved phenomena in the world in the sense that the scientist cannot\ndeduce the cause of those phenomena directly or through chains of\ndeduction from the first principles. Neither can experiment directly\ntease out such a cause. \u201cHypotheses are\u2026 sometimes very\nnecessary\u2026 in all cases when we cannot discover the true reason\nfor a phenomenon and the attendant circumstances, neither a\npriori, by means of truths [identified as principles in \u00a753]\nthat we already know, nor a posteriori, with the help of\nexperiments\u201d (IP \u00a760). And: \u201c[P]hilosophers frame\nhypotheses to explain the phenomena, the cause of which cannot be\ndiscovered either by experiment or by demonstration\u201d (IP\n\u00a756).\n\n\nRecall that for Du Ch\u00e2telet, these first principles include\nepistemological principles\u2014the principles of contradiction and\nsufficient reason (IP \u00a74 and \u00a78). Du Ch\u00e2telet writes\nthat \u201ca hypothesis\u2026 [must] not be in contradiction with\nthe principle of sufficient reason, nor with any principles that are\nthe foundation of our knowledge\u201d (IP \u00a761). But, presumably,\nthe principles constraining the sorts of hypotheses the scientist can\nposit also include metaphysical principles which can be derived\ndirectly from foundational principles of knowledge. For Du\nCh\u00e2telet, as shown above, these include the three-tier\nmetaphysical account she develops, the nature of matter, and so\nforth.\n\n\nIn her opening comments on hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet writes:\n\u201cThe true causes of natural effects and of the phenomena\nwe observe are often so far from the principles on which we can rely\nand the experiments we can make that one is obliged to be content with\nprobable reasons [hypotheses] to explain them\u201d (IP \u00a753\nemphasis added; c.f. \u00a756). She anticipates that these probable\nreasons aim at truth about the causal structure of the world and not\njust at an accurate description and prediction of phenomena. This is\ninteresting because this situates Du Ch\u00e2telet squarely within one\nparticular tradition with respect to hypotheses. Historically, there\nhave been two key directions in which thinking about hypotheses\ndeveloped, indeed from Ancient times, and certainly throughout the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries as well. According to one \napproach\u2014typified by Ptolemy in pre-modern thought and sometimes\nassociated with \u201csave the phenomena\u201d type \nexplanations\u2014hypotheses are posited merely because they are useful\ninstruments, mere mathematical calculating devices especially useful\nfor prediction and scientific practice. The aim with hypotheses,\naccording to this approach, is not to propose a true account\nof the nature of things since reaching true conclusions about the world\nis not necessarily relevant when formulating hypotheses according to\nthis tradition which focuses more pointedly on prediction. According to\nthe second approach\u2014typified by Aristotle in pre-modern thought\nand sometimes associated with causal explanations\u2014hypotheses\nare posited in order to provide an explanation of how experienced\neffects might have come about. The aim is to give a true\naccount of the nature of things, especially the causal nature\nof\n things.[22]\nIn starting off her chapter\non hypotheses with a mention of \u201cthe true causes of natural\neffects\u201d, Du Ch\u00e2telet indicates her commitment to the\nAristotelian tradition vis \u00e0 viz hypotheses, a point\nwhich becomes abundantly clear as her chapter on hypotheses\nproceeds.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet thinks hypotheses are useful (in addition to their\nproviding a necessary step in scientific method) because \u201cwhen a\nhypothesis is once posed, experiments are often done to ascertain if it\nis a good one, experiments which would never have been thought of\nwithout it\u201d (IP \u00a758). They are useful, that is, for\nsuggesting innovative experiments. Such experiments can add\nplausibility to a hypothesis if the results of them indicate that the\nhypothesis captures the truth, but a single experiment which falsifies\na hypothesis is enough to require the scientist to reject it, or at\nleast, to reject whatever part of the hypothesis is deemed faulty, for\na hypothesis \u201ccan be true in one of its parts and false in\nanother\u201d (IP \u00a765). As an example to explain how this might\nbe the case, she cites Descartes\u2019 hypothesis of a vortex of fluid\nmatter being the cause of the gravitational pull of bodies to the\nearth. As an example of her remarkable open-mindedness, she rejects the\nspecifics of Descartes\u2019 hypothesis in light of Huygen\u2019s\ndemonstrations that it does not square with observed facts, while also\nallowing that \u201cit cannot be legitimately concluded that a vortex,\nor several vortices, conceived of in a different way, cannot be the\ncause of these movements\u201d (IP \u00a765). In this case, then,\nfalsifying data requires that we invalidate only part of\nDescartes\u2019 hypothesis.\n\n\nSo Du Ch\u00e2telet takes an extremely friendly view of the role of\nhypothesis in scientific reasoning. Still, wary of those who make bad\nuse of hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet puts strict limits on their use. A\nhypothesis must \u201cnot only [explain] the phenomenon that one had\nproposed to explain with it, but also that all the consequences drawn\nfrom it agree with the observations\u201d (IP \u00a758). Herein, we\nhave the idea that a good hypothesis will explain a plethora of effects\nincluding many not originally under investigation. Du Ch\u00e2telet\nbelieves that the more such effects that can be explained (as well as the more\nexperiments performed which turn out as predicted by the hypothesis),\nthe more probable the hypothesis is. Indeed, Du Ch\u00e2telet makes\nthe very strong claim that \u201chypotheses finally become truths when\ntheir probability increases to such a point that one can morally\npresent them as certain\u201d (IP \u00a767), though the\npsychological context of the passage (\u201cas a very great\ndegree of probability gains our assent, and has on us almost the same\neffect as certainty\u201d) indicates that a highly probable hypothesis\nis merely highly probable and not strictly true, and \nthat Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s considered position\nis \u201cthat hypotheses become the poison of philosophy when they are\nmade to pass for the truth\u201d (IP, Avant-Propos\n VIII)[23].\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, part of the scientist\u2019s job is to\n\u201chave certain knowledge of the facts that are within our reach,\nand to know all the circumstances attendant upon the phenomena we want\nto explain\u2026 for he who would hazard a hypothesis without this\nprecaution would run the risk of seeing his explanation overthrown by\nnew facts that he had neglected to find out about\u201d (IP \u00a761).\nSo the scientist must become acquainted with many empirical facts so as\nto ensure that she is not ignorant of potentially falsifying data (IP\n\u00a764).\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s belief that hypotheses gain strength the\nmore phenomena they explain indicates a commitment to the idea of\nsimplicity and systematicity of causes, and the orderly\ninterconnectedness of cause and effects in the created world. These\nfeatures, to recall the discussion above of her PSR, are explicitly\nassociated with the PSR, and that principle\u2019s\nmetaphysical\n dimension.[24]\nFor not only is the PSR a\nprinciple which guides our own search for knowledge, it is a principle\nwhich guided God in his choices when creating the world (IP \u00a723)\nwhich, as the best possible world, is \u201cthe one where the greatest\nvariety exists with the greatest order, and where the largest number of\neffects is produced by the simplest laws\u201d (IP \u00a728). So the\nability of hypotheses to explain a plethora of phenomena is a direct\nresult for Du Ch\u00e2telet of the real systematicity of the\nworld\u2019s causal structure\n itself.[25]\nThis point drives home the\nsuggestion made above that Du Ch\u00e2telet is squarely in the\nAristotelian tradition with respect to hypotheses; hypotheses are meant\nto capture the true causal structure of our systematically\ninterconnected world, and are not only calculating or predictive\ndevices by which the scientist merely gives an accurate description of\nthe phenomena. At the same time, and we shall see this in the next section,\nthe fairly significant degree of separation between metaphysics and \nphysics mentioned at the close of the previous section will put \nstrict limits on how much the scientist can appeal to systematic\ninterconnectedness in \n physics.[26]\n\n\nTo conclude, let me turn to Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s definition of\na useful hypothesis:\n\n\nSo hypotheses are only probable propositions, which have a greater\nor lesser degree of probability according to whether they satisfy a\nlarger or fewer number of the circumstances that accompany the\nphenomena that we want to explain by means of the hypotheses. And since\na very high degree of probability encourages our agreement so as to\nhave nearly the effect upon us as certainty, hypotheses eventually\nbecome truths for us if their probability increases to such a point\nthat this probability can morally pass for certainty\u2026. In\ncontrast, an hypothesis becomes improbable in proportion to the number\nof circumstances found for which the hypothesis does not give a reason.\nAnd finally, it becomes false when it is found to contradict a\nwell-established observation. (IP \u00a767)\n\n\nAt the start of this section, we mentioned that Du Ch\u00e2telet is at\nthe forefront of the emergence of the embrace of the\nhypothetico-deductive in scientific explorations. Some have attributed\nsuch a method to Descartes (e.g. Lauden 1981) while others have\ndisputed this, due to his refusal to devise testing experiments and to\ntake falsifying data seriously (McMullin 1990, 44; McMullin 2008, 98;\nand Sakellariadis 1982, passim). On both points, Du\nCh\u00e2telet departs notably from Descartes due to her very\nfriendliness to this sort of engagement with the empirical.\nNonetheless, as also mentioned above, she is somewhat out of step with\nher own time precisely because of her unabashed endorsement of the\nneed for hypotheses. Moreover, her endorsement of the Aristotelian\nidea of hypotheses, and her belief in the systematic unity of the\nnatural world, shows that she also embraces there being a relation\nbetween metaphysics and physics, even while she also believes that\nthere are limits to what we can know about that relation. This is no\nsurprise given our characterization of her above as a natural\nphilosopher, a pre-modern stance despite her standing on the cusp of\nmodern conceptions of hypotheses and scientific methodology. She is\ntruly standing between two worlds, the old world of natural philosophy\nand the soon to emerge new world of modern science as we now know\nit.\n6. Newtonian Attraction\n\n\nThe first ten chapters of the Foundations provide the\nepistemology, metaphysics and theorizing on scientific methodology\nthat is meant to provide the foundations for the remaining chapters on\nNewtonian physics. An evaluation of the success of that seemingly\nparadoxical project must await a much more sustained treatment than\ncan be given here.  Rather, in this final section of this survey of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's natural philosophy, we focus on one chapter of that\nlater material both to show ways in which the earlier chapters affect\nthose that follow, and to show the limits to the characterization of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet as a metaphysical\n systematizer.[27]\n This chapter is chapter 16: On Newtonian Attraction.\n\n\nIn this chapter, she argues against some of Newton's followers\nwho aimed to universalize Newton's attraction. While Du\nCh\u00e2telet argues that Newton's theory of attraction is\nbetter than Descartes' vortices at explaining the effects of\ngravity, and that Newton's theory of attraction can\nsatisfactorily explain a wide range of other phenomena such as tidal\nmovements, the rotation of the earth, and irregularities in the\nmovement of the moon, she criticizes Newton's disciplines for\nextending Newton's theory of attraction too far. In one\nespecially interesting section, she focuses on the Newtonian theories\n(IP \u00a7389\u201392) of John Freind (1675/76\u20131728) and John Keill\n(1671\u20131721).\n\n\nIn \u00a7391, titled \u201cThe usage that Mss. Freind and Keill have\nmade of the principle of attraction\u201d (notably, she discusses only\nKeill therein), she writes:\n\n\n\nAt the end of his Introductio ad veram Astronomiam\n(Introduction to the True Astronomy), Mr. Keill set several\npropositions, through which he maintains we can deduce geometrically\nthe majority of phenomena by means of this attraction, if it is\npowerful in contact.\n\n\nAccording to these propositions, not only are cohesion and chemical\neffects the result of attraction, but so too are the spring of bodies\nand the phenomena of electricity\u2026.\n\n\nWe find the source of all these applications of attraction in the\nquestions that Mr. Newton posed at the end of his\n Optics.[28]\nThe disciples of this great\nman believed that his doubts might serve even as a basis for their\nhypotheses: but it must be admitted that some of these hypotheses\nare a bit forced and that there is a great difference in accuracy\nbetween the applications of attraction to celestial phenomena and the\nuse one makes of it in the other effects just mentioned. Also this\nuse of attraction is not as universally received by the same\nNewtonians, as the use of it when one is in fact explaining\nastronomical phenomena. (IP \u00a7391; emphasis\n added)[29]\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, what Du Ch\u00e2telet disputes in Keill's\nuniversalization of Newton's theory of attraction is his use of\nit to explain, among other phenomena, the cohesion of bodies and their\nspring, or elasticity. To make these claims, which focus\nspecifically on features intrinsic to bodies rather than on relational\nfeatures that bodies bear, Du Ch\u00e2telet believes these thinkers\nmust claim that attraction is a property of matter itself\n(IP\n \u00a7389\u201392).[30]\nHer mention in this passage\nof his \u201cforced\u201d hypotheses alerts us to the fact that she\nbelieves Keill is using hypotheses in forwarding this claim about\nmatter. As the previous section showed, she can have no quibble\nwith the fact that he uses hypotheses, yet she clearly dissents from his\nhypotheses with respect to the nature of matter and the phenomena he\nwishes to explain through this matter theory.\n\n\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the PSR positively rules out extending\nattraction to account for the nature of matter. How so? The argument\nseems to be that if attraction (as some sort of active\nprinciple or force) were to be inherent in bodies, then bodies would\nalways move, and yet bodies always moving is contrary to our\nexperience of the physical world. There is no sufficient\nreason\u2014an inherent passive principle within bodies, for\nexample, to counteract the active force\u2014to account for the brute\nfact that bodies are also sometimes at rest. So attraction cannot be\nan inherent property of matter (c.f.  IP Avant-propos\nVII). Yet for attraction to explain the cohesion of bodies, it would\nneed to be an inherent property. So attraction cannot be employed as\nthe cause of the cohesion of bodies.\n\n\nThree crucial points for a consideration of Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nscientific method and her position between pre-modern and modern\nconceptions of natural philosophy and then science emerge from this\ndiscussion of Newtonian attraction. First, the role played by\nexperience of the world is crucial for her. If our experience (in this\ncase, the brute fact that bodies are sometimes at rest) falsifies an\nhypothesis (namely, that attraction belongs to matter), then the\nhypothesis must be rejected.  Second, while Du Ch\u00e2telet accepts\nthe systematic interconnection of the created world as a feature of\nit, and as a sort of heuristic in our scientific practice, she puts\nstrict limits on the scientist's appeal to a systematic account of\nphenomena, especially in light of falsifying experience. So, while the\nuniversalizing of Newton's theory of attraction to account for a\nplethora of phenomena would represent a more interconnected physical\nsystem, this systematicity must be rejected in light of our\nexperiences of nature. Finally, while it is true that Du\nCh\u00e2telet thinks a full scientific account must try to give the\ncauses of phenomena we experience\u2014whether those be causes in the\nbasic metaphysical tier or causes in the derivative, subvisible\nphysical tier\u2014when scientists are unable to give a causal\naccount without violating the empirical facts of nature, then they\nought not to give such an account. So while it is true that\nDu Ch\u00e2telet invokes hypotheses in her approach to natural\nphilosophy, and while it is true that in doing so, she departs\nradically from those who believe that the aim of science is to merely\ndescribe (ideally in mathematical terms) the phenomena without appeal\nto metaphysical systems underlying those phenomena, the\nparticular\u2014indeed, very modern\u2014flavor of her theory of\nhypotheses puts strict limits on that metaphysics. This underscores\nthe point made at the close of \u00a74 above: there is a connection\nbetween metaphysics and physics in Du Ch\u00e2telet's view, but we\nare not always able to ascertain that connection, and so, the\nscientist cannot claim systematic unity in physics when doing so runs\nroughshod over empirical data or either of her two foundational\nprinciples. While still a natural philosopher, she has taken a\ndecisive step toward modern science in her masterwork, Foundations\nof Physics.\n",
