    "main_text": "Religion and ethics\n4. Religion and ethics\n\nFinally, what of the Buddhist religion? While Dharmak\u012brti has\nsometimes been depicted as a dry practitioner of an essentially\nsecular philosophy, this seems hardly defensible. Technical logical\nand epistemological discussions on sources of knowledge were not just\npursued for their own sake. They were also used to establish Buddhist\nreligious doctrines, like the Four Noble Truths, the proofs of the\nBuddha being an authoritative/reliable person\n(pram\u0101\u1e47apuru\u1e63a, Tibetan tshad ma\u2019i skyes\nbu), the law of retribution of acts (karman),\nreincarnation, compassion, omniscience, the innate Buddha-nature,\nabsence of real personal identity,\n etc.[53]\n All these topics are treated in extenso in the second\nchapter of Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, and some form the\nsubject of independent treatises by later Epistemologists. There is\nalso a concern with direct perception of religious truths and the\nmethods leading to that extraordinary type of knowledge. In the third\nchapter of Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika and in the\nperception chapters of the Ny\u0101yabindu and\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya, for example,\nDharmak\u012brti seeks to explain and rationalize the perception of a\nyogin (yogipratyak\u1e63a). He advocates a quite remarkable\nmethod of meditation\u2014more literally \u201ccultivation\u201d\n(bh\u0101van\u0101; abhy\u0101sa)\u2014in which\nphilosophical analysis plays an indispensable role (see e.g., Taber\n2009; see Tillemans 2016, chapter 10, on Dharmak\u012brti-style\nmeditation, its epistemological challenges and the contrast with Chan\nBuddhist approaches).\n\nThe whys and wherefores of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy of religion\nare no doubt partly explained by the historical context in which he\nlived, one in which Buddhist institutions and power were confronted\nwith forceful challenges of a reinvigorated\n Brahmanism.[54]\n Indeed, not just on matters of Buddhist doctrine but also on many\nmetaphysical issues was there a religious dimension to his arguments.\nIn the latter half of the first chapter of\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, Dharmak\u012brti proceeds to\na detailed attack on the authority of the Vedas, the Brahmins that\nexpound them, the Brahmanical ideas about the efficacy of mantras, and\nthe system of caste (see Eltschinger 2000). It is noteworthy that a\nfrequent Sanskrit term for \u201cuniversal\u201d,\n\u201ckind\u201d, i.e., j\u0101ti, is also the term for\n\u201ccaste.\u201d As Eltschinger (2000) shows, the discussions on\nthe unreality of universals and the unreality of caste were related\nfor Dharmak\u012brti and were explicitly taken to be related by\ncommentators like \u015a\u0101kyabuddhi and Kar\u1e47akagomin. Castes\nwere natural kinds explainable through universals for non-Buddhists,\nand they were not arbitrary or man-made customary distinctions. An\nobvious pay-off of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s nominalism, then, was that\nBuddhists could further distance themselves from Brahmanical\nprinciples of social organization and ethics by attacking the\nmetaphysical foundations of caste.\n\nThe debate with Brahmanical schools on specific doctrinal questions\nnaturally moved to long and involved discussions on issues of\nscriptural authority, such as the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka school\u2019s\njustification of the Vedas as being eternal, uncreated by\nhumans (apauru\u1e63eya) and hence authoritative because\nfree from any human influence. (The Buddhist retort is essentially\nthat if per impossibile scriptures were uncreated, they would\nbe incomprehensible, for there would be no speakers\u2019 intentions to\nmean one thing rather than another in using a specific\nword.) On the role of scripture Dharmak\u012brti actually had a\nnuanced position. In Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nI.213\u2013217 et sq. and in IV.48\u2013108 he maintains that\nscripture shouldn\u2019t be used on factual or rationally decidable\nmatters; perception and logical reasoning trump the scriptures of\none\u2019s own school; one is not to be faulted for rejecting one\u2019s\nschool\u2019s scriptures when reason dictates it; on rationally undecidable\nmatters, however, that is on so-called \u201cradically inaccessible\nthings\u201d (atyantaparok\u1e63a), like the specific\ndetails of the law of karman (exactly what actions in past\nlives lead to what results in the future?), scriptural accounts need\nto be relied upon because of the absence of any other means\n(agaty\u0101) (I.216). Scripture, if it passes certain\nconditions, can be designated as being an inferential source of\nknowledge, but is always fallible and not to be considered a\nfull-fledged source of knowledge, as \u201cit has no claim to\ncertainty\u201d (n\u0101to ni\u015bcaya\u1e25), unlike bona\nfide inferences (Svav\u1e5btti ad I.318). The eighth century\ncommentator \u015a\u0101kyabuddhi summarizes things interestingly in\nhis commentary to I.216: scripture is simply needed by (indeed,\nindispensable to) those who wish to set out upon the spiritual path\n(prav\u1e5bttik\u0101ma), but it is not grounded in any\nobjective facts (vastutas) (Tillemans 1999, ch. 2).\n\nThis is a surprisingly fallibilist and pragmatic position for a deeply\nreligious thinker. Taken further, it would have major consequences for\nBuddhist ethics. The use of appeals to \u201cradically\ninaccessible\u201d facts to justify ethical positions was recognized\nby Dharmak\u012brti to be flawed in public debate. Indeed he seems to\nhave been quite aware that invoking such purely scriptural positions\nwould fall flat outside the context of convinced\n Buddhists.[55]\n The lesson could have been that Buddhists should genuinely privilege\nrational considerations debatable by all, rather than heavily\nweighting \u201cproofs\u201d that were for the faithful.\nUnfortunately, however, over history the later Indo-Tibetan Buddhist\nscholastic apologists transformed the Dharmak\u012brtian view on\nscripture, indeed all of his religious philosophy, into an\nincreasingly rigid\n edifice.[56]\n Dharmak\u012brti became the defender of the Buddhist\nfaith\u2014the \u201clord of reasoning\u201d (Tib. rigs pa\u2019i\ndbang phyug). It is regrettable that much of the thought of this\nhighly inquisitive and subtle philosopher often became, in later\nIndian and Tibetan Buddhism, a series of unquestioned formulae to\nsecure Buddhist fundamentalism.\n",
