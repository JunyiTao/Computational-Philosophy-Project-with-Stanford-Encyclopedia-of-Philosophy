    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nJeremy Bentham was born on 15 February 1748 and died on 6 June 1832 in\nLondon. He was the elder son of an attorney, Jeremiah Bentham\n(1712\u201392) and his first wife, Alicia Whitehorn (d. 1759), and\nbrother to Samuel (1757\u20131831), a naval architect and diplomat.\nBentham\u2019s later interest in educational reform was rooted in his\nunhappy experiences at Westminster School (1755\u201360) and\nQueen\u2019s College, Oxford (BA 1763, MA 1766). He described\nWestminster as \u201ca wretched place for instruction\u201d\n(1838\u201343, X, 30), while his three years at Queen\u2019s, which\nhe entered at the age of twelve, were no more stimulating. He viewed\nthe Oxbridge colleges as seats of privilege, prejudice and idleness.\nHis Oxford experience left him with a deep distrust of oaths and\nsparked a general antipathy toward the Anglican establishment (2011,\n35\u201340). In the early 1770s, he jotted down notes for a critical\nwork on \u201cSubscriptions [to articles of faith]\u201d (UC v,\n1\u201332; xcvi, 263\u2013341), and returned to the same theme in\nthe controversial tract Swear Not at All (1817).\n\nFollowing Oxford Bentham attended the Court of King\u2019s Bench,\nWestminster Hall as part of his preparation for a law career. There he\nheard cases argued before Lord Mansfield, including the proceedings\nagainst the radical journalist and politician John Wilkes. He returned\nbriefly to Oxford in 1763\u201364 to attend lectures given by William\nBlackstone, the first Vinerian Professor of English Law, which were\npublished in four celebrated volumes as Commentaries on the Laws\nof England (1765\u201369). Bentham was not impressed, detecting\nglaring fallacies in Blackstone\u2019s natural law reasoning. In the\nyears following other aspects of Blackstone\u2019s theory received\nhis critical attention, notably his defence of England\u2019s\n\u201cmixed and balanced\u201d government and English common law.\nThereafter Blackstone was associated in Bentham\u2019s mind with the\n\u201cevery-thing-as-it-should-be\u201d school of legal and\npolitical apologetics.\n\nBentham was called to the Bar in 1769, but his legal career lasted\nonly one brief. In that year he discovered the utility principle and\nrelated ideas in the writings of Hume, Helv\u00e9tius and Beccaria\nand chose instead a career dedicated to analytic jurisprudence, law\nreform, and social and political improvement. Unaware of\nHutcheson\u2019s version of the utilitarian formula in An Inquiry\ninto the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1729),\nBentham was occasionally deceived by faulty memory into thinking he\nhad discovered it in Priestley\u2019s Essay on the First\nPrinciples of Government (1768). More plausible, however, are his\nclaims to have found it in Beccaria\u2019s Dei Delitti e delle\nPene (1764), where the Italian law reformer announced that the\nonly valid criterion for evaluating the merits of a law is \u201cla\nmessima felicit\u00e0 divisa nel maggior numero\u201d\u2014the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number. In reading Hume\u2019s\nTreatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340)\u2014which declared\nthat all social inquiry should be based on the \u201cexperimental\nMethod of Reasoning\u201d\u2014Bentham found virtue equated with\nutility, at which he \u201cfelt as if scales had fallen from my\neyes\u201d (1776 [1977, 440n]). Having borrowed the nomenclature of\nutility from Hume, Bentham then turned to De\nl\u2019esprit (1758), in which Helv\u00e9tius\ndelineated the potential for utility to act as a guide to human\nconduct by making a connection \u201cbetween the idea attached to the\nword \u2026 \u2018happiness\u2019 \u2026 and the ideas attached\nto the words \u2018pleasure\u2019 and \u2018pain\u2019\u201d.\nThis meant, as he recalled in the \u201cArticle on\nUtilitarianism\u201d (1829), that \u201cattached to the words\n\u2018utility\u2019 and \u2018principle of utility\u2019 were now\nideas in abundance\u201d, from which \u201ca commencement was made\nof the application of the principle of utility to practical\nuses\u201d (1983a, 290).\n\nBentham\u2019s writings present distinct challenges for the historian\nof ideas: the dates of publication are not always consistent with the\ntime of composition, in some instances with many intervening years; a\ngood number were published posthumously, and some have still to appear\nin authoritative editions; many were produced, edited or translated by\nother hands from original manuscripts with little authorial\ncontrol.\n\nBentham launched his career as a legal theorist in 1776 with the\nanonymously published A Fragment on Government. This slim\nvolume is an offshoot of a larger critique of Blackstone that was not\npublished until the twentieth century, and is now known as A\nComment on the Commentaries. In the Fragment Bentham\nstated the \u201cfundamental axiom\u201d that \u201cit is the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right\nand wrong\u201d, and \u201cthe obligation to minister to general\nhappiness, was an obligation paramount to and inclusive of every\nother\u201d (1776 [1977, 393, 440n]). In An Introduction to the\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation (IPML), his major\nwork of this early period, he described utility as \u201cthat\nproperty in any object\u201d which \u201ctends to produce benefit,\nadvantage, good or happiness\u201d (all commensurate terms in\nBentham\u2019s moral vocabulary), and the utility principle as\n\u201cthat principle which approves or disapproves of every action\nwhatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to\naugment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in\nquestion\u201d (1789 [1970, 12]). Bentham would give these basic\npostulates exposition, argumentative support, and further refinement\nin the decades following, but it was the operationalization of the\nutility principle that absorbed most of his energy and time during a\nlong and highly productive working life.\n\nIn 1781, Bentham\u2014who delighted in inventing new terminology to\ndescribe philosophical concepts\u2014coined the name\n\u201cutilitarian\u201d in recording a dream he had while a guest at\nthe country estate of his patron, the Whig politician William Petty,\n2nd Earl of Shelburne (1737\u20131805). In this dream he\nimagined himself \u201ca founder of a sect; of course a personage of\ngreat sanctity and importance. It was called the sect of the\nutilitarians\u201d (text of the dream in Crimmins 1990,\n314). It was through Shelburne that he became acquainted with the\nGenevan exile \u00c9tienne Dumont (1759\u20131829), who was to play\na critical role in making Bentham\u2019s name and philosophy known in\ncontinental Europe and elsewhere through the publication of a number\nof translations and redactions of his early writings (1829\u201330;\nsee Blamires 2008). The most important of these were the three volumes\nof Trait\u00e9s de l\u00e9gislation civil et\np\u00e9nale (1802) assembled from early manuscript drafts,\nparts of IPML and other works. The first two volumes on civil\nand penal law were later re-translated into English by the American\nutilitarian Richard Hildreth and published as The Theory of\nLegislation (1840 [1864]), a text that remained at the centre of\nutilitarian studies in the English-speaking world through to the\nmiddle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1786\u201387 Bentham visited Russia, where his brother Samuel was\nin the pay of Prince Potemkin, the favourite of Empress Catherine.\nThere he wrote A Defence of Usury (1787), his first\ncontribution to economic affairs, in which he rejected Adam\nSmith\u2019s defence of a legal maximum for interest rates. Bentham\nargued that Smith\u2019s position was inconsistent with his general\nadvocacy of freedom of trade and would restrict economic growth and\nnational prosperity by deterring investment and innovation. The volume\nlater received high praise from J.S. Mill, who thought it \u201cthe\nbest extant writing on the subject\u201d (1963\u201391, II, 923). It\nreceived its widest audience in America, where it was reprinted on\nmany occasions and frequently cited in the debates over the usury laws\n(Crimmins 2022, 53\u201354, 75, 209\u201311). It was in Russia, too,\nthat Bentham took an idea of Samuel\u2019s and developed it into the\n\u201cpanopticon\u201d, the full dimensions of which he explained in\nPanopticon; Or, The Inspection House (1791). The panopticon\nis a building of circular design intended for any institutional\narrangement where the \u201cinmates\u201d required constant\nsupervision\u2014such as hospitals, schools, workhouses and poor\nhouses\u2014but the panopticon became most well-known as a prison for\n\u201cgrinding rogues honest and idle men industrious\u201d\n(1838\u201343, IV, 342). Appalled by the inefficiency and inhumane\nconditions in Britain\u2019s penal regime, Bentham developed the idea\nof the panopticon penitentiary as a substitute penal system, in which\nconvicted criminals would be subject to a disciplinary regime based on\nthe maxim (penned in relation to his poor law writings of 1797, but\nnot then published) that \u201cthe more strictly we are watched, the\nbetter we behave\u201d (2001, 277). In achieving the ends of\npunishment it represented a significant advance on the dilapidated\ncondition of England\u2019s gaols, the rat-infested hulks anchored in\nthe Thames and the practice of transporting convicts into penal\nservitude in the colonies. In the years following, Bentham used this\ncritique as a platform to expand upon his general disdain for\ncolonies, first enunciated in Emancipate Your Colonies! in\n1793 (2002, 289\u2013313), to argue for a free, self-governing\ncommunity of settlers in southern Australia in \u201cColonization\nCompany Proposal\u201d (1831 [2022]; see also Causer, Finn and\nSchofield 2022).\n\nUpon his return from Russia, Bentham was encouraged by Shelburne to\nturn his attentions to foreign policy and international law. The term\n\u201cinternational\u201d was coined by Bentham. He drafted short\npapers on several topics that were later published under the general\ntitle Principles of International Law. This work included, as\nwas then the philosophical vogue, \u201cA Plan for Perpetual\nPeace\u201d and, uniquely, a proposal for an international court of\narbitration (1838\u201343, II, 535\u201371). Sympathetic to both\nRussia and France at this time, in 1789 he issued a critique of Prime\nMinister William Pitt\u2019s war-like stance towards these countries\nin a series of letters in the Public Advertiser under the\nnom-de-plume \u201cAnti-Machiavel\u201d (1838\u201343, X,\n201\u201311).\n\nThe political upheaval in France provided Bentham with an opportunity\nto put certain of his ideas into practice and also the context in\nwhich he first developed the utilitarian logic of democracy based on\nthe identification of interests between the ruler and the ruled. He\nnevertheless stopped short of publicly advocating parliamentary reform\nin Britain and at this stage was very far from the republicanism he\nadopted in later life (Dinwiddy 1975; Crimmins 1994; Schofield 2006).\nWith Dumont\u2019s assistance, in 1788 Bentham began sending\npamphlets of suggestions to the Comte de Mirabeau. In 1790 he wrote a\nDraught of a New Plan for the Organisation of a Judicial\nEstablishment in France which, together with Dumont\u2019s\ntranslation of parts of Panopticon and parts of An Essay\non Political Tactics dealing with the organisation of\nlegislative proceedings, was also placed before the French National\nAssembly. The bloody excesses of the Terror reinforced his criticism\nof the abstract and slippery nature of natural and imprescriptible\nrights, which he famously dismissed as \u201cnonsense on\nstilts\u201d (1795 [2002, 330])\u2014a disposition formed while\nlistening to Blackstone\u2019s lectures and which shaped his\ncontribution to John Lind\u2019s An Answer to the Declaration [of\nIndependence] of the American Congress (1776). Nevertheless,\nBentham\u2019s efforts to stimulate reform in France were recognised\nin the granting of honorary citizenship in September 1792.\n\nWhen war broke out between England and revolutionary France,\nPitt\u2019s security measures made it precarious to engage in reform\nactivities at home, but Bentham\u2019s caution also stemmed from the\nneed to curry favour in official circles for the panopticon\npenitentiary (Semple 1993, 187\u201390). The building of a new prison\nin London had been authorised by the Penitentiary Act 1794 and\nBentham\u2019s plan initially received the support of the Pitt\nadministration. Over the years he devoted considerable sums of his own\nmoney to the project, and published further material comparing the\nmerits of the panopticon with the disadvantages of the transportation\nsystem (2022). In 1802, however, he admitted defeat, and in 1812 the\ngovernment officially closed the books on the whole sorry affair,\npaying Bentham \u00a323,000 in compensation.\n\nIn the intervening years Bentham turned his attentions to poor law\nreform, the reform of policing, economic and financial questions,\njudicial administration and the rules of evidence\u2014the last of\nthese being a product of his critique of the archaisms and confusions\nof common law and the arbitrary character of \u201cjudge-made\nlaw\u201d (Postema 1989).\n\nThe essays on poor law reform from 1796\u201398 (2001, 2010a) were\npartly stimulated by rising food prices and the resultant debate about\nthe treatment of the poor. The essays contained a plan for a system of\n\u201cindustry houses\u201d run by a joint-stock company (named the\nNational Charity Company) to house the indigent, provide them with\nemployment, and provide welfare services for the working poor, the\nshort-term unemployed and disabled or unwell (Bahmueller 1981). On\npolice reform, Bentham was in advance of the age in advocating\npreventive policing and evidence-based crime analysis (see the essays\nin Jacques and Schofield 2021). Bentham\u2019s writings on political\neconomy include A Manual of Political Economy\n(1790\u201395), A Protest Against Law Taxes (1795),\nSupply without Burthen; or Escheat Vice Taxation (1795),\n\u201cCirculating Annuities\u201d (1799\u20131800), \u201cPaper\nMischief\u201d (1800\u20131), The True Alarm\n(1801), Institute of Political Economy (1800\u20134), and\nDefence of a Maximum (1801). Few of these were published\nduring Bentham\u2019s lifetime, and some only became known in the\nmid-twentieth century (Stark 1952\u201354), which explains their\nrelative neglect compared to the attention given the writings of other\npolitical economists of the period. New editions are now in progress\n(two volumes so far, 2016a, 2019, with more to come) which will\nprovide abundant material for a reassessment of Bentham\u2019s\ncontributions to this field. The writings on monetary matters, in\nparticular, contain original and innovative solutions to practical\nfinancial and currency difficulties. While many of the economic\npolicies recommended and defended in these writings derive from\nBentham\u2019s reading of Adam Smith\u2014with the notable exception\nof the prescriptions contained in Defence of a\nMaximum\u2014they are also expressly based on the subordinate\nends of his theory of civil law (Kelly 1989), as were his ideas for\npoor law reform (Quinn 2008).\n\nAfter ruminating on the subject for several years, Bentham took up the\nreform of judicial administration in Scotch Reform (1808),\nwhile the voluminous manuscripts on evidence from this time were later\nedited and published by J.S. Mill as Rationale of Judicial\nEvidence (1827). In the latter, Bentham laid down practical\nguidelines on the forms and admissibility of evidence, favouring\n\u201cnatural\u201d over \u201ctechnical\u201d procedures as most\napt to produce truth in court proceedings and to rid the system of\nvexation, expense, and delay, which he attributed to the vested\ninterest of lawyers in maintaining an arrangement designed to maximize\nlegal fees. In courts open to the public, judges were to be charged\nwith following basic principles that would allow for the most complete\nand accurate testimony available (Twining 1985, 42, 70; Schofield\n2006, 119\u201331; Resnick 2011). Adjudication in Bentham\u2019s\nreformed courts would require the strict application of the\nutilitarian codes of law. The overriding consideration was the\nsubordination of the judge to the lawmaker, though the judge may (if\nempowered) suspend the execution of the law where utility demanded,\npending a final decision by the legislature (Dinwiddy 1989a).\n\nDespite these wide and varied interests, the government\u2019s\nbetrayal over the panopticon continued to anger Bentham for many\nyears, generating a deep-seated scepticism of the motives of those in\npositions of power and influence. Added to his own first-hand\nexperience of the maneuvers of aristocratic landowners determined to\nprevent the erection of a panopticon in the vicinity of their London\nestates, there was also a suggestion that the King himself, outraged\nby Bentham\u2019s \u201cAnti-Machiavel\u201d letters and disturbed\nby rumours of his Jacobinism, may have directly intervened to thwart\nthe project (1830\u201331 [1838\u201343, XI, 96\u2013105]). In\nBentham\u2019s mind such actions were representative of the\n\u201csinister interests\u201d typically ranged against beneficial\nschemes of reform. This insight served to draw Bentham into an open\nengagement with parliamentary reform. A further catalyst came from his\nassociation with James Mill, whom he met in late 1808, and who for\nmany years thereafter acted as his philosophical and political\naide-de-camp.\n\nWith Mill\u2019s encouragement, Bentham returned to his earlier\nmanuscripts on political reform and refined and significantly expanded\nhis critique to encompass the forms of \u201cinfluence\u201d at work\nin British political institutions. The drafts he wrote in\n1809\u201310 provided the outlines for his first public statement in\nsupport of representative democracy in Plan of Parliamentary\nReform in the Form of a Catechism with Reasons for Each Article\n(1817). Based on the arithmetic of interests, aimed at limiting the\nsinister interests of those in positions of power while promoting the\ninterests of those without power, Bentham advocated a comprehensive\nset of reforms. These included: the elimination of royal patronage, a\nsubstantial extension of the franchise, annual elections by secret\nballot, the election of intellectually qualified and independent\nmembers of parliament with a system of fines to ensure regular\nattendance, and the accurate and regular publication of parliamentary\ndebates. Without these reforms Bentham believed Britain risked\nrevolution. From this point on, he became widely recognised as the\nforemost philosophical voice of political radicalism.\n\nOther political writings from this time include Defence of Economy\nagainst the Right Honourable Edmund Burke and Defence of\nEconomy against the Right Honourable George Rose, both written in\n1810 but not published until 1817 (1993, 39\u2013155). These essays\nattacked waste and corruption in government and were later reissued,\nwith other previously published essays, in Official Aptitude\nMaximized, Expense Minimized (1830), the overall aim of which was\nto optimize the competence of public servants while reducing\ngovernment expenditure. In 1824, Bentham\u2019s Book of\nFallacies appeared, in which he employed a humorous vein of barbs\nto lay bare the fallacious reasoning frequently used to bolster\nsinister interests and stymie proposals for reform (2015).\n\nBentham\u2019s position on female suffrage at this time was nuanced\n(Boralevi 1984, Ch.2): he objected to the exclusion of women from the\nvote in James Mill\u2019s 1820 essay \u201cOn Government\u201d (UC\nxxxiv, 303), an exclusion he had long ago condemned as founded on\nnothing but prejudice (2002, 247; 1838\u201343, III, 463),\nNevertheless, in public he argued that women were to be excluded until\nsuch time as universal male suffrage had been achieved (1838\u201343,\nIX, 108).\n\nClosely related to Bentham\u2019s critique of the political\nestablishment were his substantial criticisms of religious\ninstitutions, practices and beliefs in\nChurch\u2013of\u2013Englandism and its Catechism Examined\n(1818), An Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the\nTemporal Happiness of Mankind (1822), and Not Paul, but\nJesus (1823). In these works he brought to bear with telling\nscepticism his reasoning on logic, language and ontology from the same\nperiod (1838\u201343, VIII, 193\u2013338; Crimmins 1990). At about\nthe same time, he also wrote at length on private ethics in\nDeontology, published posthumously in two volumes in 1834.\nEducation was another topic that occupied Bentham in these years. In\nChurch\u2013of\u2013Englandism he was highly critical of\nthe education offered in the schools run by the National Society for\nPromoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the\nEstablished Church. When Mill, Francis Place and others became\ninvolved in a scheme to establish a non-sectarian school in London,\nBentham busied himself with ideas for its curriculum, stressing\nscience and vocational subjects over the classics, the first part of\nwhich (printed in 1815) appeared in 1816 in Chrestomathia\n(meaning \u201cconducive to useful learning\u201d) and a second part\nin 1817 (Itzkin 1978). While the Chrestomathic school was never built,\nin 1826 the same reformers, with support from a number of Evangelicals\nand Nonconformists, formed the nucleus of a group that succeeded in\nfounding University College London, England\u2019s first secular\nuniversity. An important supplement to Bentham\u2019s educational\ntheorizing is contained in a long appendix to the\nChrestomathia on logic and classification, later translated\nand edited by his nephew George Bentham and published as Essai sur\nla nomenclature et la classification des principles branches\nd\u2019art-et-science (1823).\n\nIn his final years Bentham revisited aspects of his utilitarian\nphilosophy and sought to define his place in the utilitarian tradition\nin the \u201cArticle on Utilitarianism\u201d. However, more often\nthan not his thoughts were focused on constitutional questions,\nincluding the administrative structures and the formal and informal\narrangements of a viable representative democracy\u2014in short, the\nways and means of limiting and controlling political authority or, as\nBentham termed them, \u201csecurities against misrule\u201d.\nCodification Proposal, Addressed \u2026 to all Nations\nProfessing Liberal Opinions (1822) was intended to advertise his\ncredentials as a codifier of law to politicians and statesmen around\nthe world, first by setting down the utilitarian principles of an\n\u201call-comprehensive\u201d code, and second by providing\ntestimonials to his aptitude for the task of codification (1998,\n241\u2013384; see also Lieberman 2011). The testimonials came from\nfar and wide in the years 1814\u201322, in the form of extracts from\nspeeches, requests for information, and letters of support, from the\nlikes of Francis Burdett and Henry Brougham in England, government\nministers and representatives of the Cortes in Spain and Portugal,\nItalian and French liberals, state governors and other political\nrepresentatives in the \u201cAnglo-American States\u201d, the\nRussian Emperor Alexander, and the influential Polish statesman Prince\nCzartoriski. In the years following, Bentham produced draft upon draft\nof elements of the Constitutional Code, only the first of\nthree volumes of which was published during his lifetime. In these\nwritings he unequivocally pinned his colours to the republican cause,\nbut also demonstrated an acute sense of the growing importance of the\nadministrative functions of the modern state (Rosenblum 1978; Hume\n1981; Rosen 1983).\n\nIn old age Bentham liked to style himself \u201cthe hermit of\nQueen\u2019s Square Place\u201d (the location of his home in\nLondon), but he was anything but a hermit. In December 1823 he\nprovided funds to start the Westminster Review, a periodical\ndedicated to radical views. He also assumed a leadership role in the\nmovement for law reform and political reform, maintained regular\ncontact with similarly inclined reformers, publishers and\nintellectuals at home and abroad, and was surrounded by disciples who\nacted as secretaries, collaborators, and editorial assistants. The\nMills, Place, George Grote, Richard Smith, Peregrine Bingham, Thomas\nSouthwood Smith, Edwin Chadwick, and John Bowring all worked with\nBentham in this way. Together with others, such as Thomas Perronet\nThompson, Charles Buller, John Roebuck and Joseph Hume, these later\ncame to be known as the \u201cphilosophic radicals\u201d (a coinage\nof J.S. Mill\u2019s), though in reality the group was far less\ncohesive than is sometimes thought (Thomas 1979). Bentham had a\ntelling influence on the Irish socialist utilitarian William Thompson\nand for a time he maintained close ties with the Irish\n\u201cLiberator\u201d Daniel O\u2019Connell, whom he sought to\nbind, with limited success, to the radical cause in parliament\n(Crimmins 2013, Ch.7). Burdett and Brougham were also treasured\nacquaintances, though this did not prevent Bentham from expressing\nscepticism about the dedication to radical reform of the former, or\nfrom criticising the latter\u2019s proposals to reform the Chancery\nCourt in Lord Brougham Displayed (1832 [1838\u201343, V,\n549\u2013612).\n\nBentham never married, and died in the company of friends on the eve\nof the signing of the Great Reform Act. Convinced that even the dead\nshould serve a utilitarian purpose, in his last will he directed that\nhis body be publicly \u201canatomised\u201d in order to publicize\nthe benefits of donating bodies for medical research (Richardson\n1986). The sanitary reformer and physician Thomas Southwood Smith\n(1832) delivered the eulogy over Bentham\u2019s dissected remains. In\npreparation for this final act, in an unpublished pamphlet written in\nthe year before his death, Auto-Icon; or Farther Uses of the Dead\nto the Living (printed 1842, but not then published), he proposed\nthe display of auto-iconized bodies and heads as a means to public\ninstruction. He requested that his own mummified head and skeleton,\ndressed in his habitual garments, be displayed, and it can still be\nviewed today at University College London. Bentham\u2019s (admittedly\neccentric and somewhat humorous) ideas about\n\u201cauto-iconism\u201d can also be understood as an attempt to\nfind a secular substitute for the rituals and practices of\nconventional religion.\n",
