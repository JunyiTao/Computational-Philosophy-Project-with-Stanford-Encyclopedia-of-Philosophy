    "main_text": "Climate Data || Station-Based Datasets\n3.1 Station-Based Datasets\n\nThe weather and climate conditions that matter most immediately to\npeople are those near the earth\u2019s surface, where they live.\nCoordinated networks of land-based observing stations\u2014measuring\nnear-surface temperature, pressure, precipitation, humidity and\nsometimes other variables\u2014began to emerge in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury and expanded rapidly in the twentieth century (Fleming 1998:\nCh.3). Today, there are thousands of stations around the world making\ndaily observations of these conditions, often overseen by national\nmeteorological services. In recent decades, there have been major\nefforts to bring together records of past surface observations in\norder to produce long-term global datasets that are useful for climate\nchange research (e.g., Menne et al. 2012; Rennie et al. 2014). These\nongoing efforts involve international cooperation as well as\nsignificant \u201cdata rescue\u201d activities, including imaging\nand digitizing of paper records, in some cases with the help of the\npublic.\n\nObtaining digitized station data, however, is just the first step. As\nEdwards (2010: 321) emphasizes, \u201c\u2026if you want global\ndata, you have to make them\u201d. To construct global temperature\ndatasets that are useful for climate research, thousands of station\nrecords, amounting to millions of individual observational records,\nare merged, subjected to quality control, homogenized and transformed\nto a grid. Records come from multiple sources, and merging\naims to avoid redundancies while maximizing comprehensiveness in\nstation coverage (Rennie et al. 2014). Procedures for quality\ncontrol seek to identify and remove erroneous data. For example,\nproduction of the Global Historical Climate Network\u2014Daily\n(GCHN-Daily) database involves 19 automated quality assurance tests\ndesigned to detect duplicate data, climatological outliers and\nspatial, temporal and internal inconsistencies (Durre et al. 2010).\nHomogenization attempts to remove jumps and trends in station\ntime series that are due to non-climatic factors, e.g., because an\ninstrument is replaced with a new one, a building is constructed\nnearby, or the timing of observations changes. Homogenization methods\nrely on station metadata, when it is available, as well as physical\nunderstanding and statistical techniques, such as change-point\nanalysis (Costa & Soares 2009). Finally, for many purposes, it is\nuseful to have datasets that are gridded, providing\ntemperature values at points on a grid, where each point is associated\nwith a spatial region (e.g., 2\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 2\u00b0\nlongitude). Transforming from a collection of stations to a grid\ninvolves further methodological choices: which stations should\ninfluence the value assigned to a given grid point, what to do if the\nassociated region contains no reporting stations over a period, etc.\nIn practice, scientific groups make different methodological choices\n(Hartmann et al. 2013).\n\nGridded station-based datasets for temperature, precipitation and\nother variables have been developed (e.g., Harris et al. 2014).\nSurface temperature datasets have attracted particular attention,\nbecause of their role in efforts to quantify the extent of recent\nglobal warming. Three prominent sources for such temperature datasets\nare NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the\nUniversity of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and the\nU.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).\nPeriodically, these groups develop new versions of their datasets\nreflecting both the acquisition of additional data as well as\nmethodological innovation, e.g., addressing additional sources of\ninhomogeneity (see Hansen et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2012; Lawrimore et\nal. 2011). Despite the many different methodological choices involved\nin producing these datasets, there is good agreement among analyses of\ntwentieth century global land surface temperature changes derived from\nthem, especially for the second half of the twentieth century.\nNevertheless, climate contrarians have expressed concern that these\nanalyses exaggerate late twentieth-century warming. This recently\nmotivated a fourth, independent analysis by the non-governmental\norganization Berkeley Earth; drawing on a much larger set of station\nrecords and using a quite different geostatistical methodology for\nhandling inhomogeneities, their analysis confirmed the twentieth\ncentury global warming seen in other datasets (Rohde et al. 2013).\n",
