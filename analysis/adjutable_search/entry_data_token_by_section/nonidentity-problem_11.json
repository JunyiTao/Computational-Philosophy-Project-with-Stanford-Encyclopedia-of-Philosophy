Such\nexpectations can be violated \u2013 and future people wronged \u2013\neven in cases where those people have not been made worse off, or\nharmed, by what the agent has done. What is important is not the\noutcome for the person but rather the \u201cculpable failure\u201d\non the part of the agent, including the failure to respect a future\nperson\u2019s \u201cvalue as capable of rational\nself-governance\u201d by way of failing to take\n\u201crisk-managing\u201d measures (including, e.g, pre-conceptual\ngenetic testing) on behalf of that future person (Kumar 2003,\n104\u2013114; Kumar 2018). An issue that immediately arises is\nwhether a measure that makes it the case that the person who will suffer can never\nexist at all is genuinely risk-managing in respect of that\nperson. Drawing from Scanlon 1998, Kumar describes an alternative\nposition that focuses, not on how acts may affect particular people,\nbut rather on types of persons, or standpoints, and,\nspecifically, \u201cthe reasons that persons in certain circumstances\n\u2026 typically have for caring about or wanting certain\nthings.\u201d Principles reflected in such reasons \u2013 principles\n\u201cno one can reasonably reject\u201d \u2013 include preferences\nagainst the risk of living a life that is seriously compromised.\nFailing to take such reasons into account (depending on other facts)\nis counted as a wrong against (though not a harm to)\nany particular person who eventually exists and, as a result of the\nact under scrutiny, suffers. Kumar 2018. Left unclear is how to\nreconcile the standpoint against the personal risk.\nA future standpoint may include the \u201cgeneric\u201d preference\nnot to suffer the side effects of a particular infertility treatment.\nBut if that treatment is necessary for the person ever to exist at\nall, it is unclear that the treatment itself wrongs that person. \n\nFinneron-Burns offers an alternative account of how Scanlon\u2019s\ncontractualism can be applied to solve the nonidentity problem. That\naccount avoids phrasing the debate in terms of types or standpoints\nthat need not be tied to any particular individual and instead argues\nthat we can think about future people \u2013 people who will in fact\none day exist \u2013 in the same terms we think about existing people\n(Finneron-Burns 2016, 1151\u20131153; 1160\u20131162). At the same time, on this\nview \u201cpossible people are not included in the scope of those to\nwhom we owe justification\u201d (Finneron-Burns 2016, 1163). The\nview, accordingly, will face the same hurdles as will any other view\nthat claims that existing and future people have a special moral\nstatus that the merely possible lack. See part 4 below. \n3.6.2 Act\u2019s agent fails to have appropriate concern for future person\u2019s plight\n\nA second approach that shifts the analysis of wrongdoing away from\nwhat has been done to the future person and toward the situation of\nthe agent focuses on the agent\u2019s reasons for making one choice\nrather than another. On this approach, attitudes themselves can be\n\u201cmorally defective\u201d (Kahane 2008, p. 203). Whether the\nagent\u2019s act wrongs the future person will depend on whether the\nagent is motivated by an appropriate level of concern for the needs\nand interests of (among others) the future person. Is the agent\nappropriately sensitive both to the degree of suffering that person\ncan be expected to endure and to the various aspects of that\nperson\u2019s life that can be expected to render that life (on\nbalance) worth living (Wasserman 2006, 146)? The parent may have a\nprincipled objection against pre-implantation genetic diagnosis but\nalso have an appropriate level of concern for the child\u2019s\nplight. In that case, the parent\u2019s producing the impaired child\nin place of the better-off but nonidentical child does not wrong the\nimpaired child. On the other hand, if a parent fails to undergo\ngenetic testing out of laziness and never considers the challenges\nthat the child might face as a result of being born impaired, then\nwhat the parent has done is wrong. Thus, on this view, the act\u2019s\npermissibility is a function not of the expected good for the child in\nfact being counterbalanced by the expected bad but rather of the\nparent\u2019s careful determination of how the one balances against\nthe other (Wasserman 2006, 146\u2013151). An implication of this view\nis that there need be nothing wrong in choosing to have a less happy\nrather than a happier child.\n\nChoices by policymakers (in, e.g., the context of the depletion\nexample) can be similarly evaluated. The parent\u2019s and the\npolicymaker\u2019s roles may differ in respect of the future people\ntheir choices will cause to exist but agents in both roles can\nplausibly be held to a role-appropriate standard of concern (Wasserman\n2009).\n",
