    "main_text": "Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress || Spencer\n3.1 Spencer\n\nThe project of attempting to derive normative conclusions from the\nfacts of evolutionary biology is most commonly associated with Herbert\nSpencer and his \u201cSocial Darwinist\u201d admirers. Spencer was,\nby all accounts, a more gifted and subtle thinker than he is typically\ngiven credit for today. (See the entry on\n Spencer.)\n Still, we may treat his views briefly here, as his arguments\nconcerning evolutionary biology and ethics were based on deep\nmisunderstandings of evolution. This is not to deny the historical\ninterest of his views. It may be surprising to learn, for example,\nthat Spencer himself gave a central place to harmony and mutual\naid in the \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d he viewed\nas the pinnacle of evolution in its \u201chighest\nphase\u201d\u2014something one does not typically associate with\n\u201cSocial Darwinism\u201d, but which comes directly from\nSpencer\u2019s (largely non-Darwinian) conception of evolution.\n\nSpencer (1879) conceived of evolution as a teleological process,\ndirected toward the production of progressively \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d (in the sense of \u201csuperior\u201d) forms\nmanifesting a greater \u201ctotality of life\u201d, i.e., a greater\nrichness of thought, feeling and action, as well as greater length of\nlife. Human behavior is \u201cmore evolved\u201d than the behavior\nof other animals, and the harmonious and mutually supportive behavior\nof people in \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d (where\n\u201cself-maintenance and race-maintenance\u201d is pursued without\nhindering others in the same pursuit) is \u201cmore evolved\u201d\nthan the behavior of savages or of members of less harmonious\nsocieties; that is, the former is the \u201chighest form of\nconduct\u201d because it subserves the greatest \u201ctotality of\nlife\u201d embodied by harmonious and happy human social life, where\nthe latter is taken to be the final end of evolution.\n\nAll of this, of course, is inconsistent with Darwinism, which denies\nthat evolution is a teleological or end-directed process, gives no\nmeaning to Spencer\u2019s notions of \u201cmore evolved\u201d forms\nor conduct (whereby human beings, for example, are \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than other species, or ethical conduct is \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than unethical conduct), and focuses on reproductive\nfitness rather than on Spencer\u2019s notion of the \u201cgreatest\ntotality of life in self, in offspring and in fellow man,\u201d among\nother fundamental differences (Rachels 1990). Spencer\u2019s views on\nmorality and evolution may therefore be set aside as historically\ninteresting but unhelpful to contemporary discussions based on a\nbetter understanding of evolutionary biology.\n",
