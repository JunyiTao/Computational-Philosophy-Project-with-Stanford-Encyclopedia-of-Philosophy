    "main_text": "The Critique of Morality || Critique of the Descriptive Component of MPS\n1.2 Critique of the Descriptive Component of MPS\n\nMPS for Nietzsche depends for its intelligible application to human\nagents on three descriptive theses about human agency (cf. BGE 32; GM\nI:13; TI VI; EH III:5; EH IV:8):\n\n\n(1) Human agents possess a will capable of free choice (\u201cFree\nWill Thesis\u201d).\n\n(2) The self is sufficiently transparent that agents\u2019 actions\ncan be distinguished on the basis of their respective motives\n(\u201cTransparency of the Self Thesis\u201d).\n\n(3) Human agents are sufficiently similar that one moral code is\nappropriate for (because in the interests of) all (\u201cSimilarity\nThesis\u201d).\n\n\nThese three theses must be true in order for the normative judgments\nof MPS to be intelligible because the normative judgments of MPS are\nmarked for Nietzsche by three corresponding traits; namely, that\nthey:\n\n\n(1\u2032) Hold agents responsible for their actions.\n\n(2\u2032) Evaluate and \u201crank\u201d the motives for which\nagents act.\n\n(3\u2032) Presuppose that \u201cmorality\u201d has universal\napplicability (MPS \u201csays stubbornly and inexorably, \u2018I am\nmorality itself, and nothing besides is morality\u2019\u201d [BGE\n202]).\n\n\nThus, the falsity of the picture of human beings would affect the\nintelligibility of moral judgments in the following three ways:\n\n\n(1\u2033) If agents lacked \u201cfree will\u201d they could not be\nheld responsible for their actions.\n\n(2\u2033) If agent motives could not be distinguished then no\nevaluative distinctions could be drawn among acts in terms of their\nmotives.\n\n(3\u2033) If humans were, in fact, different in some overlooked but\nrelevant respect, then it would, at least, not be prima facie\napparent that one morality should have universal application.\n\n\nIt is the burden, then, of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of the\nDescriptive Component of MPS to show that, in fact, none of these\nlatter theses about the nature of agency hold. A brief review of these\narguments follows (a more detailed treatment is in Leiter 2002: 81\u2013112\nand Leiter 2019: 115\u2013146)\n\nAgainst the Free Will Thesis, Nietzsche argues against both the modern\nattempts to vindicate free will and moral responsibility. On\nlibertarian views, a free agent (that is, one sufficiently free to be\nmorally responsible) would have to be causa sui (i.e.,\nself-caused, or the cause of itself); but since we are not causa\nsui, no one can be a free agent. Nietzsche often takes for\ngranted \u2014 not implausibly \u2014 that our moral and religious\ntraditions are incompatibilist at their core: causally determined\nwills are not free wills. But Nietzsche also argues against\ncompatibilist views of free will and moral responsibility according to\nwhich (1) we are free and morally responsible as long as we do what we\ndesire or we \u201cidentify\u201d with the desires on which we act;\nor (2) we are free and morally responsible as long as we are\nresponsive to relevant reasons for acting. (Rutherford 2011 suggests\nNietzsche has more in common with the Stoics and Spinoza when it comes\nto \u201cfree will\u201d: free actions are just ones arising from\nour real inner nature, but we can not choose to be the type of person\nwhose actions arise from their real nature, since that too is a matter\nof fate.)\n\nNietzsche offers two kinds of arguments to show that we are not\ncausa sui: that it is logically impossible to be causa\nsui; and that human beings are not self-caused in a sense\nsufficient to underwrite ascriptions of moral responsibility. (I owe\nthe point that there are two different arguments at issue here to Eric\nVogelstein.) He says relatively little about the first point, other\nthan claiming that \u201cthe concept of a causa sui is\nsomething fundamentally absurd\u201d (BGE 15), and that it is\n\u201cthe best self-contradiction that has been conceived so\nfar\u2026a sort of rape and perversion of logic\u201d (BGE 21),\nsuch that this,\n\ndesire for \u201cfreedom of the will\u201d in the superlative\nmetaphysical sense\u2026the desire to bear the entire and ultimate\nresponsibility for one\u2019s actions oneself, and to absolve God,\nthe world, ancestors, chance, and society involves nothing less than\nto be precisely this causa sui and\u2026to pull oneself up\ninto existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness. (BGE 21)\n\n\nBut we cannot, needless to say, pull ourselves up \u201cout of the\nswamps of nothingness,\u201d and so we cannot have ultimate\nresponsibility for our actions.\n\nNietzsche quickly moves from the claim that being causa sui\ninvolves a contradiction, however, to an argument that depends on his\npicture of human agency. Nietzsche accepts what we may call a\n\u201cDoctrine of Types\u201d (Leiter 1998), according to which,\n\nEach person has a fixed psycho-physical constitution, which defines\nhim as a particular type of person.\n\n\nCall the relevant psycho-physical facts here \u201ctype-facts.\u201d\nType-facts, for Nietzsche, are either physiological facts\nabout the person, or facts about the person\u2019s unconscious drives\nor affects. The claim, then, is that each person has certain largely\nimmutable physiological and psychic traits that constitute the\n\u201ctype\u201d of person he or she is.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche himself does not use this exact terminology, the\nconcept figures centrally in all his mature writings. A typical\nNietzschean form of argument, for example, runs as follows: a\nperson\u2019s theoretical beliefs are best explained in terms of his\nmoral beliefs; and his moral beliefs are best explained in terms of\nnatural facts about the type of person he is (i.e., in terms of\ntype-facts). So Nietzsche says, \u201cevery great philosophy so far\nhas been\u2026the personal confession of its author and a kind of\ninvoluntary and unconscious memoir\u201d; thus, to really grasp this\nphilosophy, one must ask \u201cat what morality does all this (does\nhe) aim\u201d (BGE 6)? But the \u201cmorality\u201d that a\nphilosopher embraces simply bears \u201cdecisive witness to who\nhe is\u201d \u2014 i.e., who he essentially is \u2014\nthat is, to the \u201cinnermost drives of his nature\u201d (BGE\n6).\n\nThis explanation of a person\u2019s moral beliefs in terms of\npsycho-physical facts about the person is a recurring theme in\nNietzsche. \u201c[M]oralities are\u2026merely a sign language of\nthe affects\u201d (BGE 187), he says. \u201cAnswers to the questions\nabout the value of existence\u2026may always be considered\nfirst of all as the symptoms of certain bodies\u201d (GS P:2).\n\u201cMoral judgments,\u201d he says are, \u201csymptoms and sign\nlanguages which betray the process of physiological prosperity or\nfailure\u201d (WP 258). \u201c[O]ur moral judgments and\nevaluations\u2026are only images and fantasies based on a\nphysiological process unknown to us\u201d (D 119), so that \u201cit\nis always necessary to draw forth\u2026the physiological\nphenomenon behind the moral predispositions and prejudices\u201d (D\n542). A \u201cmorality of sympathy,\u201d he claims is \u201cjust\nanother expression of \u2026 physiological overexcitability\u201d\n(TI IX:37). Ressentiment \u2014 and the morality that grows\nout of it \u2014 he attributes to an \u201cactual physiological\ncause [Ursache]\u201d (GM I:15).\n\nNietzsche sums up the idea well in the preface to On the Genealogy\nof Morality (hereafter simply \u201cGenealogy\u201d or\n\u201cGM\u201d): \u201cour thoughts, values, every\n\u2018yes,\u2019 \u2018no,\u2019 \u2018if\u2019 and\n\u2018but\u2019 grow from us with the same inevitability as fruits\nborne on the tree \u2014 all related and each with an affinity to\neach, and evidence of one will, one health, one earth, one sun\u201d\n(GM P:2). Nietzsche seeks to understand in naturalistic terms the\ntype of \u201cperson\u201d who would necessarily bear such\nideas and values, just as one might come to understand things about a\ntype of tree by knowing its fruits. And just as natural facts\nabout the tree explain the fruit it bears, so too type-facts about a\nperson will explain his values and actions. \n\nWe typically locate the \u201cwill,\u201d as the seat of action, in\nvarious conscious states: for example, our beliefs and desires.\nAccording to Nietzsche, however, the \u201cwill\u201d so conceived\nis nothing but the effect of type-facts about the person. This means\nthat the real story of the genesis of an action begins with the\ntype-facts, which explain both consciousness and a\nperson\u2019s actions. Here is how Nietzsche puts it, after\nsuggesting that the \u201cwill\u201d is related to, but conceptually\nprior to, the concepts of \u201cconsciousness\u201d and\n\u201cego\u201d:\n\nThe \u201cinner world\u201d is full of phantoms\u2026: the will is\none of them. The will no longer moves anything, hence does not explain\nanything either \u2014 it merely accompanies events; it can also be\nabsent. The so-called motive: another error. Merely a surface\nphenomenon of consciousness \u2014 something alongside the deed that\nis more likely to cover up the antecedents of the deeds than to\nrepresent them\u2026.\n\n\nWhat follows from this? There are no mental [geistigen]\ncauses at all. (TI VI:3)\n\n\nIn the last line, Nietzsche must mean only that there are no\nconscious mental causes. Indeed, in other passages, he is\nexplicit that the target of this critique is the picture of conscious\nmotives as adequate to account for action. (For competing views of the\nscope of Nietzsche\u2019s epiphenomenalism about consciousness, see,\non the one hand, Katsafanas 2005 and, on the other, Riccardi 2019,\nFowles 2019 and Leiter 2019: 135\u2013139; more generally, on how Nietzsche\nviews consciousness, see Abel 2001 and Welshon 2014). As he writes in\nDaybreak, \u201cwe are accustomed to exclude all [the]\nunconscious processes from the accounting and to reflect on the\npreparation for an act only to the extent that it is conscious\u201d\n(D 129), a view which Nietzsche plainly regards as mistaken, both here\nand in the passage quoted above. Indeed, the theme of the\n\u201cridiculous overestimation and misunderstanding of\nconsciousness\u201d (GS 11) is a recurring one in Nietzsche.\n\u201c[B]y far the greatest part of our spirit\u2019s\nactivity,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cremains unconscious and\nunfelt\u201d (GS 333; cf. GS 354).\n\nApart from the general evidence on behalf of the Doctrine of Types,\nNietzsche\u2019s strongest targeted argument for the epiphenomenality\nof consciousness depends on a piece of phenomenology, namely,\n\u201cthat a thought comes when \u2018it\u2019 wishes, and not when\n\u2018I\u2019 wish\u201d (BGE 17). If that is right and if actions\nare apparently \u201ccaused\u201d by thoughts (by particular beliefs\nand desires), then it follows that actions are not caused solely by\nour conscious mental states, but rather by whatever it is (i.e.,\ntype-facts) that determines the thoughts that enter consciousness.\nThus, it is the (autonomous) causal power of our conscious mental life\nthat Nietzsche must be attacking. Given, then, that Nietzsche claims\nconsciousness is epiphenomenal, and given our identification of the\n\u201cwill\u201d with our conscious life, Nietzsche would have us\ndispense with the idea of the will as causal altogether. (This gives\nNietzsche a novel argument against hierarchical accounts of free will\nfavored by some compatibilists: see Leiter 2002: 93\u201396. It also\nundermines more recent forms of compatibilism based on\nreasons-responsiveness: if deliberation, or conscious reasoning,, is\nepiphenomenal, then why should an antecedent but non-causal\ncorrelation between antecedently consciously experienced reasons and a\nsubsequent action ground responsibility? Barometers drop before\nstorms, after all, but they do not cause them and are not blameworthy\nfor them. See Leiter 2019: 144\u2013146). Since the conscious will is not\ncausal, the Free Will Thesis is false.\n\nAgainst the Transparency of the Self Thesis, Nietzsche claims that\n\u201cevery action is unknowable\u201d (GS 335; cf. WP 291, 294); as\nhe writes in Daybreak:\n\nThe primeval delusion still lives on that one knows, and knows quite\nprecisely in every case, how human action is brought\nabout\u2026. \u201cI know what I want, what I have done, I am\nfree and responsible for it, I hold others responsible, I can call by\nits name every moral possibility and every inner motion which precedes\naction; you may act as you will \u2014 in this matter I understand\nmyself and understand you all!\u201d \u2014 that is\nhow\u2026almost everyone still thinks\u2026.[But] [a]ctions are\nnever what they appear to us to be! We have expended so much\nlabor on learning that external things are not as they appear to us to\nbe \u2014 very well! the case is the same with the inner world! Moral\nactions are in reality \u201csomething other than that\u201d \u2014\nmore we cannot say: and all actions are essentially unknown. (D 116)\n\n\nActions are unknown because \u201cnothing\u2026can be more\nincomplete than [one\u2019s] image of the totality of drives\nwhich constitute [a man\u2019s] being\u201d (D 119). One \u201ccan\nscarcely name even the cruder ones: their number and strength, their\nebb and flow, their play and counterplay among one another, and above\nall the laws of their nutriment remain wholly unknown\u201d\n(D 119). But as Nietzsche argues elsewhere (e.g., D 109), the self is\nmerely the arena in which the struggle of drives plays itself out, and\none\u2019s actions are the outcomes of the struggle (see Leiter 2002:\n99\u2013104; cf. Riccardi 2015b; for a general account of\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophical psychology of drives, see Katsafanas\n2013a).\n\nAgainst the Similarity Thesis, Nietzsche once again deploys his\nDoctrine of Types. Nietzsche holds that agents are essentially\ndissimilar, insofar as they are constituted by different\ntype-facts. Since Nietzsche also holds that these natural type-facts\nfix the different conditions under which particular agents will\nflourish, it follows that one morality cannot be good for all.\n\u201cMorality in Europe today is herd animal\nmorality,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cin other\nwords\u2026merely one type of human morality beside which,\nbefore which, and after which many other types, above all\nhigher moralities, are, or ought to be, possible\u201d (BGE\n202). Nietzsche illustrates the general point with his discussion of\nthe case of the Italian writer Cornaro in Twilight of the\nIdols (VI:1). Cornaro, says Nietzsche, wrote a book mistakenly\nrecommending \u201chis slender diet as a recipe for a long and happy\nlife.\u201d But why was this a mistake? Nietzsche explains:\n\nThe worthy Italian thought his diet was the cause of his long\nlife, whereas the precondition for a long life, the extraordinary\nslowness of his metabolism, the consumption of so little, was the\ncause of his slender diet. He was not free to eat little or\nmuch; his frugality was not a matter of \u201cfree will\u201d: he\nbecame sick when he ate more. But whoever is not a carp not only does\nwell to eat properly, but needs to.\n\n\nThere exists, then, type-facts about Cornaro that explain why a\nslender diet is good for him: namely, \u201cthe extraordinary\nslowness of his metabolism.\u201d These natural facts, in turn,\nconstrain what Cornaro can do, delivering him \u201cfeedback\u201d\nabout the conditions under which he will and won\u2019t flourish:\ngiven his slow metabolism, if Cornaro ate more \u201che became\nsick\u201d; conversely, when he stuck to his slender diet, he did\nwell. In sum, \u201c[h]e was not free to eat little or\nmuch.\u201d Cornaro\u2019s mistake consists, in effect, in his\nabsolutism: he thought the \u201cgood\u201d diet was good for\neveryone, when in fact it was only good for certain types of bodies\n(namely, those with slow metabolisms). As with diets, so too with\nmoralities, according to Nietzsche. Agents are not similar in\ntype-facts, and so one moral \u201cdiet\u201d cannot be \u201cgood\nfor all.\u201d As he writes:\n\n[T]he question is always who he is, and who the\nother person is\u2026Every unegoistic morality that takes\nitself for unconditional and addresses itself to all does not only sin\nagainst taste: it is a provocation to sins of omission, one\nmore seduction under the mask of philanthropy \u2014 and\nprecisely a seduction and injury for the higher, rarer, privileged.\n(BGE 221)\n\n\nThis point sets the stage for his core critique of morality.\n\n",
