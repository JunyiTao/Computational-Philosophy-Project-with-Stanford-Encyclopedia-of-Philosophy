    "main_text": "\n\nThe tradition of Chinese ethical thought is centrally concerned with\nquestions about how one ought to live: what goes into a worthwhile\nlife, how to weigh duties toward family versus duties toward\nstrangers, whether human nature is predisposed to be morally good or\nbad, how one ought to relate to the non-human world, the extent to\nwhich one ought to become involved in reforming the larger social and\npolitical structures of one\u2019s society, and how one ought to\nconduct oneself when in a position of influence or power. The\npersonal, social, and political are often intertwined in Chinese\napproaches to the subject. Anyone who wants to draw from the range of\nimportant traditions of thought on this subject needs to look\nseriously at the Chinese tradition. The canonical texts of that\ntradition have been memorized by schoolchildren in Asian societies for\nhundreds of years, and at the same time have served as objects of\nsophisticated and rigorous analysis by scholars and theoreticians\nrooted in widely variant traditions and approaches. This article will\nintroduce ethical issues raised by some of the most influential texts\nin Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, Legalism, and Chinese Buddhism, with\nthe most attention directed at the first four, which are indigenous to\nChina and arose during the classical period (about the middle of\nthe 6th to the end of the 3rd century BCE) of Chinese philosophy.\n",
