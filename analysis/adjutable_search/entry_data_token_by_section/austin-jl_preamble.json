    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Langshaw Austin (1911\u20131960) was White\u2019s Professor of\nMoral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He made a number of\ncontributions in various areas of philosophy, including important work\non knowledge, perception, action, freedom, truth, language, and the\nuse of language in speech acts. Distinctions that Austin draws in his\nwork on speech acts\u2014in particular his distinction between\nlocutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts\u2014have assumed\nsomething like canonical status in more recent work. His work on\nknowledge and perception places him in a broad tradition of\n\u201cOxford Realism\u201d, running from Cook Wilson and Harold\nArthur Prichard through to J.M. Hinton, M.G.F. Martin, John McDowell,\nPaul Snowdon, Charles Travis, and Timothy Williamson. His work on\ntruth has played an important role in recent discussions of the extent\nto which sentence meaning can be accounted for in terms of\ntruth-conditions.\n",
