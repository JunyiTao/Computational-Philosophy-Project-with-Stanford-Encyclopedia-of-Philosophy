    "main_text": "The System of Necessity\n1. The System of Necessity\n\nReid\u2019s moral philosophy, according to the gloss offered thus\nfar, is an agency-centered intuitionist position, which also blends\ntogether both rationalist and sentimentalist influences. Given its\nsynthetic character, it is natural to ask how best to enter into\nReid\u2019s thought. A promising avenue is to note a pattern of\nthought present in Reid\u2019s work. In his work in epistemology and\nphilosophy of mind, which is found primarily in An Inquiry into\nthe Human Mind (IHM) and Essays on the Intellectual Powers of\nMan (EIP), Reid frames his project as a response to a general\nposition that he calls the Way of Ideas. This position, which Reid\nsays unites philosophers as diverse as Aristotle, Locke, Berkeley, and\nHume, holds that we are never acquainted with the external world but\nonly with \u201cimages\u201d or sense data in the mind. What Reid\nsays positively about our perception of the external world is couched\nas a response to this view. Although it is rarely noted, Reid\u2019s\nwork in ethics in Essays on the Active Powers of Man (EAP) is\nalso framed as a response to a general position, which he claims is\nadopted by philosophers as diverse as Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hume. This\nposition Reid ordinarily calls the System of Necessity. Reid\u2019s\nown positive views about the nature of agency and the moral domain are\nbest viewed as a response to the System of Necessity. Let us, then,\nenter Reid\u2019s moral philosophy by having before us the rudiments\nof the System of Necessity.\n\nSuppose you have fallen asleep in your bed after a long day of work.\nYou briefly wake during the night, noting that someone has left a\nkitchen light on. You do not want, however, to get out of bed at this\nhour. Still, after pondering the issue for a moment, you know that you\nshould do so. So, you drag yourself out of bed and turn the light off.\nHow should we describe your behavior?\n\nAccording to advocates of the System of Necessity, there is a sense in\nwhich the performance of this action is up to you. No one forced you\nto get up out of bed. There is also a sense in which you did it\nbecause you believed you should. It is this belief, coupled with a\ndesire\u2014perhaps to do what is right\u2014that moved you to get\nout of bed. Finally, there is a sense in which there is an explanation\nof your action that is perfectly law-like. Because your desire (let us\nsuppose) to do what is right was stronger than your desire to stay in\nbed, it won out. Under the supposition that stronger motivations win,\nwe have a perfectly general, law-like explanation of why you acted as\nyou did.\n\nIn Reid\u2019s view, then, proponents of the System of Necessity\naffirm these three claims:\n\nEvery human action has a sufficient cause.\nProvided normal background conditions obtain, the sufficient cause\nof a human action is its motive, which is a mental state of an\nagent.\nEvery human action is subsumable under a law, which specifies that\nfor any agent S, set of motives M, and action\nA at t, necessarily, if S performs\nA, then there is some member of M that is\nS\u2019s strongest motive, which causes S to\nperform A at t.\n\n\nViewed from on angle, these claims appear not to fit tightly together.\nOne could accept any one and reject the others. Viewed from another\nangle, however, they express a unified picture of human action, one\naccording to which human action is a natural phenomenon that is\nsubsumable under laws in much the same way that other ordinary natural\nevents are. If one is attracted to this broadly naturalistic position,\nas Reid claims that figures such as Spinoza, Hume, Priestley, and\nKames were, then these claims form a natural package (see Cuneo\n2011a).\n\nReid, however, believed that this package of claims provides a deeply\ndistorted picture of human action. Why did he believe this? In large\npart because he could not see how it could account for genuinely\nautonomous human agency in at least two senses of this multivalent\nterm. In the first place, autonomous actions are ones that can be\nproperly ascribed to an agent. But if the System of Necessity were\ntrue, Reid claimed, there is no proper sense in which actions that\nappear to be performed by an agent could justly be attributed to that\nagent\u2014the human agent being simply a theater in which various\ndrives and impulses vie for dominance. One could, if the System of\nNecessity were right, attribute actions to mental states such as\ndesires. And this might be adequate to describe the behavior of\nanimals and addicts. But, Reid claims, it is not adequate to describe\npurposeful human action. For human action, in Reid\u2019s view, must\nbe attributable to the person as a whole, not some force working in or\non her (see Korsgaard 2009, xii).\n\nSecondly, autonomous agency is such that an agent can exercise a\ncertain type of control over the various impulses that present\nthemselves when deliberating. Suppose, to return to our earlier case,\nthat you briefly wake during the night, noting that someone has left a\nkitchen light on. You want not to get out of bed at this hour. Must\nyou capitulate to your strongest desire? Not if you are autonomous.\nFor genuinely autonomous agents, according to Reid, are reflective.\nAny desire is such that an autonomous agent can direct his attention\nnot only to its object, but also to the desire itself, asking: Should\nI act on it? That is, any such agent can ask these two questions:\nFirst, would acting on this desire contribute to my genuine\nwell-being? And, second, is there a sufficient moral reason or\nobligation for acting on or ignoring it? These two questions advert to\nwhat Reid calls the rational principles of action (see EAP,\nIII.iii.i). The first principle Reid calls the principle with\n\u201cregard to our good on the whole,\u201d the second the\n\u201cprinciple of duty.\u201d The fact that you needn\u2019t\ncapitulate to your desire to stay in bed but can step back and\ncritically assess it with reference to these two rational principles\nof action, in Reid\u2019s estimation, is what separates normal,\nmature human beings from the rest of the natural order.\n\nThis point was important enough to Reid that he highlights it in the\nIntroduction to Essays on the Active Powers and\nelsewhere:\n\n\nThe brutes are stimulated to various actions by their instincts, by\ntheir appetites, by their passions: but they seem to be necessarily\ndetermined by the strongest impulse, without any capacity of\nself-government\u2026. They may be trained up by discipline, but\ncannot be governed by law. There is no evidence that they have the\nconception of a law, or of its obligation.\n\nMan is capable of acting from motives of a higher nature. He perceives\na dignity and worth in one course of conduct, a demerit and turpitude\nin another, which brutes have not the capacity to discern\u2026.\n\n[Men] judge what ends are most worthy to be pursued, how far every\nappetite and passion may be indulged, and when it ought to be\nresisted\u2026. In them [the brutes] we may observe one passion\ncombating another, and the strongest prevailing; but we perceive no\ncalm principle in their constitution that is superior to every\npassion, and able to give law to it. (EAP, 5 and II.ii: 57)\n\n\nWhen Reid talks about our capacity to be governed by law he has in\nmind our capacity to regulate our behavior by assessing it in terms of\nthe two rational principles of action. Reid, then, champions what we\nmight call a regulation account of autonomy. We are\nautonomous, rational agents, in Reid\u2019s estimation, in virtue of\nthe fact that we can regulate or govern our behavior by stepping back\nfrom our various impulses, desires, instincts, and assess prospective\nactions in light of the two rational principles of action. It is this\ndimension of human action, according to Reid, that is missing\naltogether from the description of agency offered by advocates of the\nSystem of Necessity.\n",
