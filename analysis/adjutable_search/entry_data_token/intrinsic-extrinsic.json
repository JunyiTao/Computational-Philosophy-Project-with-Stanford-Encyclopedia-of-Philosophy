Introduction\n\nThe standard way to introduce the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties is by the use of a few orientating\ncharacterisations. David Lewis provides the following list:\n\n\nA sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic\nproperties to something is entirely about that thing; whereas an\nascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about\nthat thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which\nincludes that thing as part. (Lewis 1983a: 197)\n\nA thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way that thing\nitself, and nothing else, is. Not so for extrinsic properties, though\na thing may well have these in virtue of the way some larger whole is\n\u2026 (Lewis 1983a: 197)\n\nIf something has an intrinsic property, then so does any perfect\nduplicate of that thing; whereas duplicates situated in different\nsurroundings will differ in their extrinsic properties. (Lewis 1983a:\n197)\n\n\nThe other way to introduce the subject matter is by providing examples\nof paradigmatic intrinsic and extrinsic properties. One half of this\ntask is easy: everyone agrees that being an uncle is extrinsic, as is\nbeing six metres from a rhododendron. The other half is more\nchallenging, since there is much less agreement about which properties\nare intrinsic. Lewis (1983a, 1986a, 1988), for example, has insisted\nthat shape properties are intrinsic, but one could hold that an\nobject\u2019s shape depends on the curvature of the space in which it\nis located at, and this might not even be intrinsic to that space\n(Nerlich 1979), let alone the object (Bricker 1993, McDaniel 2007, and\nSkow 2007). Lewis also mentions charge and internal structure as being\nexamples of intrinsic properties. (For ease of exposition, we will\nassume below that shape properties are intrinsic. We will also assume\nthat properties like being made of tin, and having a mass of 500kg are\nintrinsic.)\n1.1 Philosophical Importance\n\nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties plays an\nessential role in stating several interesting philosophical problems.\nHistorically, the most prominent of these has to do with notions of\nintrinsic value. G. E. Moore (1903: \u00a718) noted that we can make a\ndistinction between things that are good in themselves, or possess\nintrinsic value, and those that are good as a means to other things.\nTo this day there is still much debate over whether this distinction\ncan be sustained (Feldman 1998, Kagan 1998), and, if it can, which\nkinds of things possess intrinsic value (Krebs 1999). In particular,\none of the central topics in contemporary environmental ethics is the\nquestion of which kinds of things (intelligent beings, conscious\nbeings, living things, species, etc) might have intrinsic value. While\nthis is the oldest (and still most common) use of the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction in philosophy, it has not played much\nrole in the discussions of the distinction in metaphysics, to which we\nnow turn.\n\nAs P. T. Geach (1969) noted, the fact that some object \\(a\\) is not\n\\(F\\) before an event occurs but is \\(F\\) after that event occurs does\nnot mean that the event constitutes, in any deep sense, a change in\n\\(a\\). To use a well-worn example, at the time of Socrates\u2019s\ndeath Xanthippe became a widow; that is, she was not a widow before\nthe event of her husband\u2019s death, but she was a widow when it\nended. Still, though that event constituted (or perhaps was\nconstituted by) a change in Socrates, it did not in itself constitute\na change in Xanthippe. Geach noted that we can distinguish between\nreal changes, such as what occurs in Socrates when he dies, from mere\nchanges in which predicates one satisfies, such as what occurs in\nXanthippe when Socrates dies. The latter he termed \u2018mere\nCambridge\u2019 change. There is something of a consensus that an\nobject undergoes real change in an event iff there is some\nintrinsic property it instantiated before the event\nbut not afterwards.\n\nDavid Lewis (1986a, 1988) built on this point of Geach\u2019s to\nmount an attack on endurantism, the theory that\nobjects persist by being wholly located at different times, and that\nthere can be strict identity between an object existing at one time\nand one existing at another time. Lewis argues that this is\ninconsistent with the idea that objects undergo real change. If the\nvery same object can be both \\(F\\) (at one time) and not \\(F\\) (at\nanother), this means that \\(F\\)-ness must be a relation to a time, but\nthis means that it is not an intrinsic property. So any property that\nan object can change must be extrinsic, so nothing undergoes real\nchange. Lewis says that this argument supports the rival theory of\nperdurantism, which says that objects persist by\nhaving different temporal parts at different times. While this\nargument is controversial (see Haslanger (1989), Johnston (1987) and\nLowe (1988) for some responses), it does show how considerations about\nintrinsicality can resonate within quite different areas of\nmetaphysics.\n\nA third major area where the concept of intrinsicality has been put to\nwork is in stating various supervenience theses. Frank Jackson (1998)\ndefines physicalism in terms of duplication and physical duplication,\nwhich are in turn defined in terms of intrinsic properties. Similarly,\nJaegwon Kim (1982) defines a mind/body supervenience thesis in terms\nof intrinsic properties. As Theodore Sider (1993) notes, the simplest\nway to define the individualist theory of mental\ncontent that Tyler Burge (1979) attacks is as the claim that the\ncontent of a thinker\u2019s propositional attitudes supervenes on the\nintrinsic properties of the thinker. And many\ninternalist theories in epistemology are based around\nthe intuition that whether a thinker is justified in believing some\nproposition supervenes on the intrinsic properties of the thinker.\n\nA fourth area where the concept of intrinsically has been employed is\nto state recombination principles intended to describe what possible\nstates of the world there are. (See Lewis 1986a.) An initial attempt\nto state such a principle might be (R1), where \\(x\\) is wholly\ndistinct from \\(y\\) iff \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no parts in common. (As\nis standard in philosophical usage, each thing is counted as a part of\nitself. Hence, things are not wholly distinct from themselves.)\n\n(R1)\nFor any properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) , it is possible that there are\ntwo wholly distinct things, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), such that \\(x\\) has \\(p\\)\nand \\(y\\) has \\(q\\). \n\n\nGiven an abundant theory of properties according to which each\n(non-defective) predicate expresses a property, however, (R1) clearly\nfails, since it isn\u2019t possible for there to be an \\(x\\) and a\n\\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) has the property of being made of gold, and\n\\(y\\) has the property of being such that nothing is made of gold.\nThis defect with (R1) can be fixed by replacing (R1) with (R2).\n\n(R2)\nFor any intrinsic properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), it is\npossible that there are two wholly distinct things, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nsuch that \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) and \\(y\\) has \\(q\\). \n\n\nWhile being made of gold and being such that nothing is made of gold\nrefute (R1), they don\u2019t refute (R2), since being such that\nnothing is made of gold is clearly non-intrinsic.\n\nIn addition to the above four applications of the distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic properties, the distinction has also been\nemployed for many other purposes. For example, it has been used to\nformulate principles of universalizability for moral principles and\nmoral laws (Rabinowicz 1979), formulate a requirement on an\nexplanation being a good explanation, namely that it be an intrinsic\nexplanation (Field 1980, Maya 2014), and formulate a non-trivial\nversion of Mill\u2019s principle of the uniformity of nature\n(Schlesinger 1990). The distinction (or distinctions definable in\nterms of it) has also been used to argue against the magical ersatz\ntheory of possible worlds (Lewis 1986a, Sect. 3.4), defend the\ntransitivity of causation (Hall 2000, Hall 2004), defend the modal\ntheory of essence (Denby 2014), argue for the immanent theory of\nproperties (Audi 2019), and argue against the thesis that determinable\nfacts are always soley grounded by determinate facts (Shumener\n2022).\n\nMost of the philosophical applications of intrinsicality are\nindependent of its precise analysis. Work on its analysis, however,\nhas helped clarify these applications by allowing us to distinguish\nbetween different notions of intrinsicality and different notions in\nthe vicinity of intrinsicality, and by giving us a greater\nunderstanding of these various notions and of what properties satisfy\nthem. A good example of the latter kind of advance is Theodore\nSider\u2019s (2003) observation that most of the properties in folk\ntheory are \u2018maximal\u2019 and hence not intrinsic properties.\nThis observation provides a strong argument against various theories\nthat appeal to the intuitive intrinsicality of some everyday\nproperty.\n1.2 Global and Local\n\nIn addition to the \u201cglobal\u201d concept of a property being\nintrinsic, there is a \u201clocal\u201d concept of something having\na property in an intrinsic fashion (see Humberstone 1996, p. 206). For\neach of Lewis\u2019s characterisations concerning the concept of an\nintrinsic property quoted in section\n 1.1,\n there is a corresponding characterisation for the concept of a thing\nhaving a property in an intrinsic fashion. These are:\n\n\\(x\\) has \\(F\\) in an intrinsic fashion iff a sentence ascribing\n\\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is entirely about that thing.\n\\(x\\) has \\(F\\) in an intrinsic fashion iff \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) in\nvirtue of how \\(x\\) itself, and nothing else, is.\n\\(x\\) has \\(F\\) in an intrinsic fashion iff every duplicate of\n\\(x\\) has \\(F\\).\n\n\nIt follows from at least the third of these characterisations that\nsomething can have an extrinsic property in an intrinsic fashion. For\nexample, since every duplicate of a piece of tin has the property of\nbeing made of tin, every duplicate of a piece of tin also has the\nextrinsic property of being either made of tin or married. As a\nresult, it follows from the third characterisation that each piece of\ntin has the property of being either made of tin or married in an\nintrinsic fashion, despite this property being extrinsic.\n\nTwo plausible principles linking the local and global concepts of\nintrinsicality are (GTL) and (LTG) (see Humberstone 1996, p. 228).\n\n(GTL)\n If \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property, then it is necessary that\nevery \\(x\\) that has \\(F\\) has \\(F\\) in an intrinsic fashion \n(LTG)\n If it is necessary that every \\(x\\) that has \\(F\\) has \\(F\\) in\nan intrinsic fashion, then \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property \n\n\nIn addition to the two-place predicate \u2018has \u2026 in an\nintrinsic fashion\u2019, we can introduce a modifier\n\u2018intrinsically\u2019, where, adapting one of the\ncharacterisations above, \\(x\\) is intrinsically \\(F\\) iff \\(x\\) is\n\\(F\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) itself, and nothing else, is. (cf.\nHumberstone 1996, p. 228). This modifier takes predicates as arguments\nrather than names of properties or variables ranging over properties.\nNominalists, who don\u2019t believe in properties, might attempt to\nuse this modifier to capture the intuitive distinctions associated\nwith intrinsicality without committing themselves to properties. For\nexample, a nominalist might claim that a table is intrinsically\nrectangular, while claiming to consistently hold that there is no\nproperty of being rectangular. (For simplicity, we will assume in the\nfollowing that nominalism is false and that there are abundantly many\nproperties and relations, some of which are intrinsic and some of\nwhich are extrinsic.)\n\nThere might be further reasons to employ either the two place\npredicate \u2018has \u2026 in an intrinsic fashion\u2019, or the\nmodifier \u2018intrinsically\u2019, rather than the one-place\npredicate \u2018is intrinsic\u2019. For example, one might think\nthat at least one of the former two notions is more fundamental than\nthe latter notion, or that the latter notion is misguided in some way\nthat at least one of the former notions isn\u2019t. (See, for\nexample, Figdor 2008.)\n1.3 Relations\n\nWhile this article focuses on the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic one-place properties, it is important to recognize that the\ndistinction between intrinsic and extrinsic also applies to multiple\nplace relations. As in the case of one-place properties, the\ndistinction between intrinsic and extrinsic multiple place relations\ncan be introduced by characterisations and examples. One\ncharacterisation is the following:\n\nAn \\(n\\)-place intrinsic relation is an \\(n\\)-place relation that\n\\(n\\) things stand in in virtue of how they are and how they are\nrelated to each other, and not in virtue of anything else; whereas,\nthis is not the case for extrinsic \\(n\\)-place relations.\n\n\nExamples of extrinsic two-place relations include being as popular\nas, and having the same cousin as. Possible examples of\nintrinsic two-place relations include being 1 m away from and\nbeing made of the same type of metal as. (The claim that\ndistance relations like being 1 m away from are intrinsic\nwill be denied by philosophers who deny that shape properties are\nintrinsic.)\n\nAs well as the global notion of an \\(n\\)-place relation being\nintrinsic, there is the local notion of \\(n\\) things standing in a\nrelation in an intrinsic fashion. A characterisation of this local\nnotion is:\n\n\\(n\\) things stand in a relation \\(R\\) in an intrinsic fashion iff the\n\\(n\\) things stand in \\(R\\) in virtue of how they are and how they are\nrelated to each other, and not in virtue of anything else.\n\n2. Notions of Intrinsicality\n\nA number of different distinctions have been called the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction. As J. Michael Dunn (1990) notes, some\nauthors have used \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nto mean \u2018essential\u2019 and \u2018accidental\u2019. Dunn is\nsurely right in saying that this is a misuse of the terms. A more\ninteresting distinction is noted by Brian Ellis (1991; discussed in\nHumberstone 1996: 206). (See also Figdor 2008 and Figdor 2014 for a\ndiscussion of a related notion of intrinsicality.) Ellis suggests we\nshould distinguish between properties that objects have independently\nof any outside forces acting on them (what we will call the\nEllis-intrinsic properties), and those that they have in virtue of\nthose outside forces (the Ellis-extrinsic properties). For many\nobjects (such as, say, a stretched rubber band) their shape will be\ndependent on the outside forces acting on them, so their shape will be\nEllis-extrinsic. If one is committed to the idea that shapes are\nintrinsic, one should think this means that the distinction between\nthe Ellis-intrinsic and Ellis-extrinsic properties is not the same as\nthe intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. Such a judgement may seem a\nlittle hasty, but in any case we will turn now to distinctions that\nhave received more attention in the philosophical literature.\n2.1 Relational vs. Non-Relational Properties\n\nMany writers, especially in the literature on intrinsic value, use\n\u2018relational\u2019 for the opposite of intrinsic. This seems to\nbe a mistake since many properties seem to be both be relational and\nintrinsic. For example, most people have the property having\nlonger legs than arms, and indeed seem to have this property in\nan intrinsic fashion, even though the property consists in a certain\nrelation being satisfied. Maybe the property is not intrinsic if\nwhether or not something is an arm or a leg is extrinsic, so perhaps\nthis isn\u2019t a conclusive example, but it seems troubling. And, in\nany case, there are other examples that can\u2019t be responded to in\nthis way. For example, the property of having a proper part is surely\nintrinsic, but it also appears to be a relational property.\n\nAs Humberstone 1996 notes, some might respond by suggesting that a\nrelational property is one such that if an object has it, then it\nbears some relation to a non-part of it. But this won\u2019t do\neither. Not being within a mile of a rhododendron is clearly\nrelational, but does not consist in bearing a relation to any\nnon-part, as we can see by the fact that a non-rhododendron all alone\nin a world can satisfy it.\n\nA further response might be to say that a relational property should\nbe a property that involves a relation that can only relate wholly\ndistinct things, and that, given this construal of a relational\nproperty, non-intrinsic properties are relational properties. However,\nthis response faces difficulties also. For example, this account would\npresumably classify the property of being such that there is a cube as\nbeing intrinsic. This property, however, is not intrinsic.\n\nWhile the notion of a relational property should be distinguished from\nthe notion of a non-intrinsic property, it might be that the notion of\nintrinsic properties can be given an account in terms of\nrelationality. One such account due to Francesscotti is discussed in\nthe supplement:\n\nThe Relational Account of Intrinsicality.\n \n2.2 Local vs. Non-Local Properties\n\nWe now turn to the notion of intrinsicality characterised by the\ncharacterisations listed in section\n 1.\n Or perhaps better, we now turn to the notions of\nintrinsicality characterised by these characterisations, since, while\nLewis thought that each of these characterisations characterise a\nsingle notion of intrinsically, it is plausible that they characterise\ndifferent notions. In this subsection, we will discuss the notion\ncharacterised by the first characterisation which involves aboutness.\nIn the next two subsections, we will discuss the notions characterised\nby the other two characterisations.\n\nLewis\u2019s first characterisation is:\n\nA sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic\nproperties to something is entirely about that thing; whereas an\nascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about\nthat thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which\nincludes that thing as part. (Lewis 1983a: 111\u20132)\n\n\nThe notion of aboutness employed in this characterisation is plausibly\nthat of intrinsic aboutness, where intrinsic aboutness can be\nintuitively characterised by (1).\n\n(1)\n A state of affairs\n\\(s\\) is intrinsically about a thing \\(x\\) iff \\(s\\) (either truly or\nfalsely) describes how \\(x\\) and its parts are and how they are\nrelated to each other, as opposed to how \\(x\\) and its parts are\nrelated to other things and how other things are. \n\n\nUsing the notion of intrinsic aboutness, Lewis\u2019s first\ncharacterisation can be more precisely stated by the schema (2).\n\n(2)\nThe property of being \\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for\nany \\(x\\), the state of affairs of \\(x\\) being \\(F\\) is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\).\n\n\nFor any predicate \\(F\\) expressing a property \\(p\\), and any name\n\\(n\\) referring to an \\(x\\), define the ascription of \\(p\\) to \\(x\\)\nto be the state of affairs expressed by \\(\\ulcorner Fn\\urcorner\\).\nUsing this definition, we can replace the schema (2) with the sentence\n(3).\n\n(3)\n For any property\n\\(p, p\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), the ascription\nof \\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\).\n\n\n(3) plausibly classifies being a cube as intrinsic, since,\nfor any \\(x\\), the state of affairs of \\(x\\) being a cube plausibly\ndescribes how \\(x\\) and its parts are and how they are related to each\nother, as opposed to how they are related to other things and how\nother things are. In contrast, (3) plausibly classifies being an\nuncle as non-intrinsic, since its ascription to a thing is not\nonly about how it and its parts are and how they are related to each\nother, but also about how it is related to things outside of it. (3)\nalso plausibly classifies being Obama as non-intrinsic since the\nascription of being Obama to Clinton, namely the state of affairs of\nObama being identical to Clinton, is not wholly about Clinton, but is\nalso about Obama. Finally, (3) also appears to classify being such\nthat there is a number as non-intrinsic, even if it is necessary that\nthere are numbers. This is because the ascription of this property to\nClinton, namely the state of affairs that Clinton is such that there\nis a number, appears to be not wholly about how Clinton is, but is\nalso about how things wholly distinct from Clinton are. (We will\nassume that the intuition underlying this judgement is correct.\nHowever, this is not uncontroversial. See Sider 1996 for a rejection\nof a closely related intuition and Eddon 2011 for a reply to this\nrejection.)\n\nIn the following, we will call the properties classified as intrinsic\nby (3) local properties, and call the properties classified\nby (3) as not intrinsic non-local properties. (This notion of\na local property needs to be distinguished from the local conception\nof something having a property in an intrinsic fashion discussed in\nsection\n 1.2.)\n2.3 Interior vs. Exterior Properties\n\nThe second characterisation listed in the quote by Lewis in section\n 1\n was \u201cA thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way\nthat thing itself, and nothing else, is\u201d. This\ncharacterisation can be stated more precisely by schema (4), where\n\u2018how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 abbreviates \u2018how \\(x\\)\nand its parts are and how they are related to each other, as opposed\nto how \\(x\\) and its parts are related to other things and how other\nthings are\u2019.\n\n\n(4)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically. \n\n\nCall the properties that are classified as intrinsic by (4)\ninterior properties, and call the properties that are\nclassified as non-intrinsic by (4) exterior properties. An\nimportant question is what meaning \u2018in virtue\u2019 is meant to\nhave in (4). One possible answer is that it is meant to have a reading\ncorresponding to metaphysical grounding, where metaphysical grounding\nis the relation that stands to metaphysical explanation as causation\nstands to causal explanation. Under such a reading of \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019, (5) is necessarily true.\n\n(5)\n \u2018\\(\\varphi\\)\nin virtue of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 is true iff the\nstate of affairs expressed by \\(\\phi\\) metaphysically grounds the\nstate of affairs expressed by \\(\\varphi\\). \n\n\nWhile it might be initially appealing to think that \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019 in (4) expresses metaphysical grounding, Marshall 2015\nhas given an argument that (4) fails to characterise a notion of\nintrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019 has this reading. The\nargument relies on (6) being necessarily true and (7) being true on\nany notion of intrinsicality.\n\n(6)\n \u2018\\(\\varphi\\)\nin virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 is true iff there is a\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) that expresses an obtaining state of affairs that is\nintrinsically about \\(x\\) such that \u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it\nbeing the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 is true. \n\n\n(7)\n It is possible for\nthere to be a sentence \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019, where \\(F\\)\nexpresses an intrinsic property and \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019\nexpresses a foundational fact in the sense of being a fact that is not\nmetaphysically grounded by any other fact. \n\n\nThe argument is the following. Suppose, for reductio, that (4)\ncharacterises a notion of intrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019\nexpresses metaphysical grounding. It follows from this, and the\nnecessity of (5) and (6), that (8) is necessarily true.\n\n(8)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\nthere is an obtaining state of affairs \\(s\\) that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) such that \\(s\\) metaphysically grounds \\(x\\) being \\(F\\).\n\n\n\nBy (7), it is possible for a sentence \\(\\ulcorner a\\) is\n\\(F\\urcorner\\) to express a foundational fact, where \\(F\\) expresses\nan intrinsic property. Hence, it follows from (7) and the necessity of\n(8) that (9) is possibly true.\n\n(9)\n \\(a\\) being \\(F\\)\nis a foundational fact and there is an obtaining state of affairs\n\\(s\\) that is intrinsically about \\(a\\) such that \\(s\\) metaphysically\ngrounds \\(a\\) being \\(F\\). \n\n\nHowever, (9) is necessarily false, since foundational facts cannot be\nmetaphysically grounded by any facts. Hence, the assumption that (4)\ncharacterises a notion of intrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019\nexpresses metaphysical grounding is false.\n\nGiven \u2018in virtue\u2019 doesn\u2019t express metaphysical\ngrounding in (4) on its intended use, what does it express? One\nattractive option is to think that \u2018in virtue\u2019 in (4) is\nmeant to be understood as having the same effect as \u2018is a matter\nof\u2019 and that, on this reading, it expresses the identity\nrelation. On this reading, \u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being\nthe case that \\(\\psi\\)\u2019 is true iff the state of affairs\nexpressed by \\(\\phi\\) is identical to the state of affairs expressed\nby \\(\\varphi\\). Since it follows from (6) that, on this reading\n\u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 is\ntrue iff there is a sentence \\(\\phi\\) that expresses an obtaining\nstate of affairs that is intrinsically about \\(x\\), (10) follows from\n(4) on this reading of \u2018in virtue\u2019.\n\n(10)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then the\nstate of affairs of \\(x\\) being \\(F\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\).\n\n\n\nAn alternative option, which is investigated in Marshall 2016a, is to\nhold that \u2018in virtue\u2019 may express a number of different\nreflexive determination, or entailment, relations in (4), and that\neach of these relations determines a different notion of\nintrinsicality. In addition to identity, such entailment relations\nmight include metaphysical necessitation, nomic necessitation, and\nweak metaphysical grounding, where \\(p\\) weakly metaphysically grounds\n\\(q\\) iff either \\(p=q\\) or \\(p\\) metaphysically grounds \\(q\\). Given\nthese relations determine different notions of intrinsicality for each\nrelation \\(R\\), we may call the notion of interiority corresponding to\n\\(R\\) \u2018\\(R\\) interiority\u2019. So, for example, the notion of\nintrinsicality obtained from (4) by interpreting \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019 as expressing the identity relation might be called\nidentity interiority, while the notion of interiority obtained from\nmetaphysical necessitation might be called metaphysical necessitation\ninteriority, and the notion of interiority obtained from nomic\nnecessitation might be called nomic necessitation interiority. \n\nIf \u2018in virtue\u2019 expresses the relation \\(R\\), then\n\u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019\nis true iff the state of affairs of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\nstands in \\(R\\) to the state of affairs of it being the case the\n\\(\\varphi\\). It follows from this, (4) and (6) that the \\(R\\) interior\nproperties satisfy (11).\n\n(11)\n Being \\(F\\) is\n\\(R\\) interior iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\nthere is an obtaining state of affairs \\(s\\) that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) such that \\(s\\) stands in \\(R\\) to the state of affairs of\nit being the case that \\(x\\) is \\(F\\). \n\n\nJust as being cubical is intuitively a local property, while being an\nuncle and being such that there is a number are intuitively non-local\nproperties, the former property is intuitively an identity interiority\nproperty, while the latter properties are both intuitively not\nidentity interior. (Those that claim that being such that there is a\nnumber is a local property, however, are likely to also claim that\nthis property is identity interior. See, for example, Sider (1993a),\nEddon (2011), Vallentyne (1997), Hoffman-Kolls (2014) and Francescotti\n(2014) for the relevant debate.) The identity interior properties,\nhowever, plausibly do not coincide with the local properties, since,\nwhile being identical to Obama is not a local property, it is\nplausibly an identity interior property. This is because, necessarily,\nfor any \\(x\\) that is identical to Obama, the state of affairs of\n\\(x\\) being identical to Obama is plausibly about how \\(x\\) and its\nparts are and how they are related to each other, as opposed to how\nthey are related to other things and how other things are.\n\nSince each identity interior property is also an \\(R\\) interior\nproperty, for each reflexive relation \\(R\\), the \\(R\\) interior\nproperties also do not coincide with the local properties for each\n\\(R\\). The \\(R\\) interior properties also differ from the identity\ninterior properties for at least some \\(R\\). For example, the\nmetaphysical necessitation interior properties plausibly differ from\nthe identity interior properties since, while being such that there is\na number is plausibly not identity interior, it is metaphysical\nnecessitation interior. This is because, given the assumption that\nnumbers necessarily exist, any \\(x\\) is such that how it is\nintrinsically necessitates that \\(x\\) is such that there is a\nnumber.\n2.4 Duplication Preserving vs. Duplication Non-Preserving Properties\n\nThe third characterisation Lewis lists when isolating the concept of\nintrinsicality is that duplicates never differ with respect to their\nintrinsic properties. Lewis holds a further principle that may not be\nobvious from the above quote: that any property with respect to which\nduplicates never differ is intrinsic. Adding this further principle to\nthe characterisation gives us (12).\n\n(12)\n \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff \\(F\\) never differs between duplicates. \n\n\n(12), however, has the following problem. Assume that no man has a\nmass of 500 kg (although it is possible for a man to have a mass of\n500 kg). Since nothing has the property of being a popular man who is\n500 kg, given this assumption, no two duplicates differ in whether\nthey have this property. (12) therefore falsely classifies being a\npopular man who is 500 kg as intrinsic.\n\nDavid Lewis doesn\u2019t face this problem due to his concretist\ntheory of possible worlds. Lewis holds that, in addition to the world\nwe live in, there are many other concrete worlds of the same kind as\nthe world we live in. Moreover, he holds that contained in some of\nthese worlds are 500 kg duplicate men, some of whom are popular, and\nsome of whom are not. Given Lewis\u2019s concretist theory of\npossible worlds, then, being a popular man who is 500 kg is classified\nas extrinsic by (12).\n\nPhilosophers who instead endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can\u2019t accept (12). According to\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds, possible worlds\ndo not contain concrete entities such as 500 kg men as parts.\nAccording to standard abstractionists, then, there are no 500 kg men,\nthere are only possible worlds that represent that there are 500 kg\nmen. Philosophers who endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can replace (12) with (13) (see Moore 1922\nand Francescotti 1999). (Or at least, they can replace (12) with (13)\ngiven they hold that there are things that exist according to\nnon-actual possible worlds that don\u2019t exist according to the\nactual world. Abstractionists who deny this will have to further\nmodify (13).)\n\n(13)\n \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and for any possible worlds\n\\(u\\) and \\(v\\) such that \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at\n\\(v, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(v\\) \n\n\nGiven a standard abstractionist theory of possible worlds, there is a\npossible world \\(u\\) that represents there being a popular 500 kg man\n\\(x\\), and there is another possible world \\(v\\) that represents there\nbeing an unpopular 500 kg man \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) has the same\nintrinsic properties as \\(y\\) at \\(v\\), and hence \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v\\). Given this, (13) classifies being a\npopular man who is 500 kg as extrinsic.\n\nPutting aside for the moment the question of whether (13) correctly\ncharacterises a genuine notion of intrinsicality, let us call the\nnotion it does characterise duplication preservation. (13), understood\nas a characterisation of duplication preservation has two important\nconsequences. First, it has the consequence that identity properties,\nsuch as being Obama, aren\u2019t duplication preserving. The reason\nfor this is that, since Obama could have had a duplicate distinct from\nhimself, there is a possible world at which Obama has a duplicate who\nis not Obama, and hence there is a possible world at which something\nhaving the property of being Obama has a duplicate which lacks this\nproperty.\n\nA more general consequence can be stated using the distinction between\nqualitative and non-qualitative properties, where a qualitative\nproperty is intuitively a property that doesn\u2019t concern any\nparticular entities, while a non-qualitative property is a property\nthat does concern one or more particular entities. Examples of\nqualitative properties include the property of being cubical and the\nproperty of being next to a tin, while examples of non-qualitative\nproperties include the property of being Obama and the property of\nbeing next to Clinton. It plausibly follows from (13), understood as a\ncharacterisation of duplication preservation, that any non-qualitative\nproperty that is possibly instantiated is not a duplication preserving\nproperty.\n\nSay that a property is indiscriminately necessary iff it is\nnecessarily had by everything. The second consequence of (13),\nunderstood as a characterisation of duplication preservation, is that\nany two properties that are indiscriminately necessary are duplication\npreserving. Consider, for example, the indiscriminately necessary\nproperty of being such that there is a number (where we are assuming\nthat numbers necessarily exist). Since all things at all possible\nworlds have this property, it is a duplication preserving\nproperty.\n\nSince being such that there is a number is neither a local property or\nan identity interior property, but is a duplication preserving\nproperty (given numbers necessarily exist), the duplication preserving\nproperties do not coincide with either the local properties or the\nidentity interior properties. Since being Obama is a metaphysical\nnecessitation interior property, but is not a duplication preserving\nproperty, the duplication preserving properties don\u2019t coincide\nwith the metaphysical necessitation interior properties either. (Moore\n(1922) and Dunn (1990), in effect, both distinguish duplication\npreservation from interiority on these grounds.) Hence, we have at\nleast four distinct kinds of properties that are characterised by\nLewis\u2019s three characterisations: local properties, identity\ninterior properties, metaphysical necessitation interior properties,\nand duplication preserving properties.\n\nIf Lewis\u2019s three characterisations concerning intrinsicality\ncharacterise different notions, the three characterisations described\nin section\n 1.2\n concerning having a property in an intrinsic fashion also\ncharacterise different notions. In order to distinguish these notions,\nwe may employ these characterisations to define having a property in a\nduplication preserving fashion, having a property in an interior\nfashion (relative to different entailment relations), and having a\nproperty in a local fashion.\n2.5 Which is the real distinction?\n\nIn the last three subsections, we distinguished a number of distinct\nnotions that are characterised by Lewis\u2019s three\ncharacterisation: locality, duplication preservation, and several\ndifferent kinds of interiority. We now need to address the question of\nwhether there is a single notion of intrinsicality, and, if there is,\nwhich of these notions is it? More precisely, we need to determine\nwhether there is a single notion that philosophers typically use\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express, and, if so, which notion is\nit.\n\nOne might attempt to answer this question by first noting that it is\nmuch more common for philosophers to use Lewis\u2019s second\n\u201cin virtue\u201d characterisation (or some variant of it), than\neither of the other two characterisations when explaining what they\nmean by \u2018intrinsic\u2019. (For example, as far as we know,\nLewis uses the \u201cin virtue\u201d characterisation whenever he\nexplains what he means by \u2018intrinsic\u2019, but only uses the\nother characterisations once.) This suggests that philosophers\ntypically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express a notion of\ninteriority rather than either of the notions of locality or\nduplication preservation.\n\nGiven philosophers typically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express\nsome notion of interiority, there are several reasons to think that\nthe notion of interiority they typically express is that of identity\ninteriority. First, identity interiority is more fundamental, or\nsimpler, than the other notions of interiority, and philosophers are\noften interested in employing more fundamental notions than less\nfundamental notions. Second, the intrinsic properties of a thing\nshould be the properties that thing has \u201cin itself\u201d,\nrather than merely the properties that are metaphysically\nnecessitated, or nomically necessitated, or metaphysically explained,\nby the properties the thing has \u201cin itself\u201d. But this\nsuggests that the intrinsic properties should be the identity interior\nproperties, rather than the metaphysical necessitation interior\nproperties, or the nomic necessitation interior properties, or the\nweak grounding interior properties. Finally, while the identity\ninteriority of necessarily coextensive properties can intuitively\ndiffer, this is not true for at least some of the other notions of\ninteriority, such as metaphysical necessitation interiority and nomic\nnecessitation interiority. (Properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are necessarily\ncoextensive iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) iff \\(x\\)\nhas \\(q\\).) Since it is a widespread intuition that necessarily\ncoextensive properties can differ in whether they are intrinsic, this\nsuggests these other notions of interiority aren\u2019t what\nphilosophers typically express by \u2018intrinsic\u2019. (This last\nreason also provides a further reason to think that duplication\npreservation isn\u2019t the notion of intrinsicality philosophers\ntypically employ, since it also does not differ among necessarily\nequivalent properties.)\n\nThere are therefore reasons to think that the notion philosophers\ntypically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express is identity\ninteriority. These reasons, however, are not decisive. First,\nphilosophers often take intrinsic properties to be qualitative, and\nuse \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to distinguish only among qualitative\nproperties. (See Sider 1996.) Since each local property and each\nduplication preserving property is qualitative, but this is not true\nfor interior properties, this possibly suggests that at least some\nphilosophers at least some of the time use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to\nexpress either locality or duplication preservation. Secondly, while\nidentity interiority can do much of the theoretical work\nintrinsicality is meant to do, it arguably cannot do all of it, with\nsome of this work being better done by some of the other notions of\nintrinsicality described above. For example, Sider (1996) has argued\nthat duplication preservation is better able to be used to define\nindividualism about mental states than identity interiority. Finally,\nthe failure of many philosophers to clearly distinguish which notion\nof intrinsicality they are employing provides at least some reason to\nsuspect that those philosophers have often used\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 indeterminately to express a multiplicity of\nnotions of intrinsicality.\n\nAn alternative view has been put forward by Plate 2018, who has argued\nthat there is a single notion of intrinsicality and that none of the\nnotions discussed above correspond to it. Plate points out that, on\neach of the alleged notions of intrinsicality discussed above, either\nthe property of having Paris as a part is classified as non-intrinsic\nor the uninstantiable property of being such that Socrates is\nnon-self-identical is classified as intrinsic. Plate then argues that,\nsince having Paris as a part is intrinsic while being such that\nSocrates is non-self-identical is non-intrinsic, it follows that none\nof the above notions is intrinsicality. A response to Plate\u2019s\nargument is given by Marshall 2021, who argues that there is no notion\nof intrinsicality on which these properties are respectively intrinsic\nand non-intrinsic. Instead, according to this response, there are only\nnotions of intrinsicality on which either both are intrinsic or both\nare non-intrinsic.\n\nIn the next section, we will consider a number of attempts to analyse\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019. Unless otherwise made clear, we will use\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express identity interiority, and we will\nassume that identity interiority is the most dominant notion of\nintrinsicality employed by philosophers. As we will see, however, a\nnumber of these attempts are most charitably seen as attempts to\nanalyse notions of intrinsicality other than identity interiority.\n3. Attempts at Analysis\n\nOne reason to attempt an analysis of intrinsicality is that the\norientating characterisations of intrinsicality discussed in section\n 1\n and sections\n 2.2\n \u2013\n 2.4\n are all to some degree circular. (Cf Lewis 1983a and Yablo 1999.) For\nexample, a property \\(p\\) whose ascription to a thing \\(x\\) is about\n\\(x\\) is intrinsic only if it is about how \\(x\\) is\nintrinsically; \\(p\\) is not intrinsic if the ascription of\n\\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is about how \\(x\\) is extrinsically.\nSimilarly, a property \\(p\\) that is had by \\(x\\) in virtue of how\n\\(x\\) is is intrinsic only if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\)\nis intrinsically; \\(p\\) need not be intrinsic if\n\\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is extrinsically.\n\nSome of the following attempts to analyse intrinsicality are best seen\nas attempts to analyse the distinction between duplication preserving\nproperties and properties that aren\u2019t duplication preserving,\nwhile other attempts are best seen as attempts to analyse the\ndistinction between interior and exterior properties, or between local\nand non-local properties. For a discussion of whether we can give, or\nneed to give, a reductive analysis of intrinsicality, see Skiles 2014\nand Hoffman-Kolss 2018.)\n\nIn addition to the metaphysical project of determining what it is for\na property to be intrinsic, there is an epistemological project of\ndetermining how we can come to know with respect to particular\nproperties whether they are intrinsic, and whether such knowledge is\npossible. To some extent, the metaphysical project of determining what\nit is to be intrinsic can help with this epistemological project. For\nexample, if it can be shown that being intrinsic can be analysed as\nthe possession of such and such features, and we have knowledge of\nwhich properties have such and such features, then we can use this\nanalysis to explain how we can know of particular properties that they\nare intrinsic. In addition to employing such analyses of\nintrinsicality, however, we might hope to develop and describe further\nmethods for obtaining justified beliefs regarding what properties are\nintrinsic. For further discussion that bears on this issue, see\nMcQueen and van Woudenberg 2016.\n3.1 Broadly Logical Theories\n\nIt would be good if we could analyse intrinsicality using only broadly\nlogical notions, where broadly logical notions are exhausted by the\nnarrowly logical notions of conjunction, negation and existential\nquantification, the modal notion of metaphysical possibility, the\nmereological notion of parthood, and the basic notions associated with\nproperty theory and set theory, such as the notions expressed by\n\u2018state of affairs\u2019, \u2018property\u2019,\n\u2018relation\u2019, \u2018possible world\u2019,\n\u2018instantiates\u2019, \u2018is a member of\u2019 and\n\u2018set\u2019. (The locution \u2018state of affairs\u2019 is\nused differently by different philosophers. Here it is being used to\nrefer to the zero-place analogues of one-place properties and multiple\nplace relations. Just as a property is a way of a thing is or fails to\nbe, a state of affairs, under our usage, is a way things are or fail\nto be.)\n\nIt is at least initially appealing to think that, if an object has a\nproperty in an intrinsic fashion, then it has it independently of the\nway the rest of the world is. The rest of the world could disappear,\nand the object might still have that property. Hence a lonely\nobject, an object that doesn\u2019t coexist with any contingent\nobjects wholly distinct from it, could have the property. Many\nextrinsic properties, on the other hand, cannot be possessed by lonely\nobjects \u2013 no lonely object has the property of being six metres\nfrom a rhododendron, for example. This suggests an analysis of\nintrinsicality: \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff it is possible for\na lonely object to be \\(F\\). This analysis is usually attributed to\nKim (1982) (e.g. in Lewis 1983a and Sider 1993), though Humberstone\n(1996) dissents from this interpretation. If this analysis is\nsuccessful then it would constitute a broadly logical analysis, since\nthe expressions on the right hand side of the account can each be\ndefined using only broadly logical vocabulary.\n\nThe major problem with this analysis is that the \u2018if\u2019\ndirection of the biconditional is clearly false. As Lewis (1983)\npointed out, it is possible for a lonely object to have the property\nof being lonely, but the property of being lonely is not\nintrinsic.\n\nOne might try to deal with this problem by adding extra modal\nconditions to the above account. Say that a property \\(F\\) is\nindependent of accompaniment iff the following four\nconditions (taken from Langton and Lewis 1998) are met:\n\nPossibly, there exists a lonely \\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists a lonely non-\\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists an accompanied (i.e. not lonely) \\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists an accompanied non-\\(F\\)\n\n\nAt first glance, if \\(F\\) is intrinsic, then whether or not an object\nhas \\(F\\) should not depend on whether it is lonely. If this is right,\nthen all four of these conditions should be satisfied. We might\ntherefore try to give the following broadly logical analysis: \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff \\(F\\) is independent of accompaniment.\n\nAs Langton and Lewis (1998) point out, however, this strengthened\nanalysis still fails (see also Lewis 1983a). Given intrinsic\nproperties, such as being a cube, are independent of accompaniment,\nthe extrinsic property of being either a lonely cube or an accompanied\nnon-cube is also independent of accompaniment. Hence, provided the\nstrengthened analysis correctly classifies being a cube as\nintrinsic, it will falsely classify being either a lonely cube or\nan accompanied non-cube as intrinsic.\n\nIn the face of this failure, we might still hope that a yet more\nsophisticated broadly logical analysis might succeed. An argument due\nto Marshall 2009 and Parsons 2001, however, shows that, given standard\nviews about what is possible, and given the absence of special\nassumptions about the abundance and structure of properties, no such\nanalysis can be given. This argument considers the intrinsic property\nof being an electron and the extrinsic property of being either an\naccompanied electron or a lonely positron. It then shows that, given\ncertain common views about properties and possibility, these\nproperties have the same pattern of instantiation through logical,\nmereological and set-theoretic space. Since formulas containing only\nbroadly logical expressions cannot distinguish between properties\nhaving the same such pattern, it then follows that no broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsically is possible.\n\nTo give more of an idea of how this argument works, suppose for\nsimplicity that there are only three possible worlds, \\(w_1\\), \\(w_2\\)\nand \\(w_3\\), and only four possible individuals \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\),\n\\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\). Suppose further that: \n\nAt \\(w_1\\), \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are the only things that exist,\n\\(x_1\\) is an electron and \\(x_2\\) is a positron \n\nAt \\(w_2\\), \\(x_3\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_3\\) is an\nelectron \n\nAt \\(w_3\\), \\(x_4\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_4\\) is a\npositron. \n\nNow assume a possible worlds theory of properties, according to which\nthe property of being \\(F = \\{\\langle x, w\\rangle \\mid x \\text{ is } F\n\\text{ at } w\\}\\). Given this theory of properties:\n\n\\(q_1\\) = Being an electron = \\(\\{\\langle x_1, w_1 \\rangle, \\langle\nx_3, w_2\\rangle\\}.\\) \n\n\\(q_2\\) = Being either an accompanied electron or a lonely positron =\n\\(\\{\\langle x_1, w_1\\rangle, \\langle x_4, w_3\\rangle\\}.\\) \n\nSuppose, for reductio, that the notion of an intrinsic property can be\nanalysed in terms of broadly logical notions. Then, since analyses\nmust be necessary, there is a formula \\(\\varphi(p)\\) such that (A) is\nnecessarily true, where \\(\\varphi\\) contains only broadly logical\nvocabulary, such as variables, brackets, \u2018&\u2019,\n\u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019, \u2018is a\npossible world\u2019, \u2018at\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\in\\)\u2019.\n\n(A)\n \\(p\\) is intrinsic iff \\(\\varphi(p)\\). \n\n\nSince \\(q_1\\) is necessarily intrinsic, while \\(q_2\\) is necessarily\nnot intrinsic, it follows from the necessity of (A) that\n\\(\\varphi(q_1)\\) is necessarily true, while \\(\\varphi(q_2)\\) is\nnecessarily false. In other words, if there is a broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsicality, then there is a formula \\(\\varphi\\)\ncontaining only broadly logical vocabulary that necessarily applies to\n\\(q_1\\), and necessarily does not apply to \\(q_2\\). However, it can be\nproved that there is no such formula. For example, while\n\n\\[\\text{\u2018}\\exists w_1 \\exists w_2 \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\exists x_3(p =\n\\{\\langle w_1, x_1\\rangle , \\langle w_2, x_3\\rangle \\})\\text{\u2019}\\]\n\n\napplies to \\(q_1\\), it also applies to \\(q_2\\). Hence, the reductio\nassumption is false, and there is no broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality. This argument can easily be adapted to show that there\nis no broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality given more realistic\nassumptions about what possible worlds there are.\n\nIt is important to note that, despite the existence of the above\nargument, one might still be able to analyse intrinsicality in terms\nof broadly logical notions if one is prepared to make special (and\ncontroversial) assumptions about properties. As an illustration of\nthis, suppose one assumes that all intrinsic properties have no proper\nparts while all extrinsic properties do have proper parts. Then one\nmight give a broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality by giving\naccount (14).\n\n(14)\n \\(p\\) is an intrinsic property iff \\(p\\) is a property that has\nno proper parts.\n\n \nEven if an analysis like this one is true, however, its utility will\nbe limited. For example, unless we already know somehow which\nproperties have proper parts and which properties do not have proper\nparts, (14) will be useless in helping us to determine which\nproperties are intrinsic and which properties are non-intrinsic.\n\nTwo more sophisticated attempts to give a broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality are Yablo\u2019s contractionist account discussed in\nsection\n 3.4,\n and Francescotti\u2019s relational account, which is discussed in\nthe supplementary document:\n\nThe Relational Account of Intrinsicality.\n \n\nBoth these accounts rely on controversial assumptions about properties\nor related entities such as possible worlds. The most sophisticated\nattempt to give a purely broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality\nthat has yet been proposed is that of Plate 2018. A response to\nPlate\u2019s account is given in Marshall forthcoming.\n\nGiven that we cannot give a satisfactory account of intrinsicality\nusing only broadly logical notions, it is natural to investigate\nwhether we can give a satisfactory account using a larger set of\nnotions. In the next four subsections, we will consider whether\nintrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the notions of perfect\nnaturalness, non-disjunctivity, possible world contractions, or\nmetaphysical grounding.\n3.2 Perfect Naturalness Theories\n\nThe most influential attempt to analyse intrinsicality over the last\n30 years has arguably been Lewis\u2019s 1986a account of\nintrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness. \n\nThe perfectly natural properties and relations are the fundamental\nproperties and relations. Lewis wrote:\n\n\nSharing of [the perfectly natural properties] makes for qualitative\nsimilarity, they carve at the joints, they are intrinsic, they are\nhighly specific, the set of their instances are ipso facto not\nentirely miscellaneous, there are only just enough of them to\ncharacterise things completely and without redundancy. Physics has its\nshort list of \u2018fundamental physical properties\u2019: the\ncharges and masses of particles, also their is so-called\n\u2018spins\u2019 and \u2018colours\u2019 and\n\u2018flavours\u2019, and maybe a few more that have yet to be\ndiscovered. (Lewis 1986b, p. 60, author\u2019s emphasis)]\n\n\nThe notion of a perfectly natural, or fundamental, property or\nrelation suggests an appealing approach to analysing intrinsicality.\nConsider the non-intrinsic property of being an uncle. It is appealing\nto think that the reason this property fails to be intrinsic is that\nit can be analysed in terms of more fundamental relations, such as\nbeing a sibling of and being a child of, in a manner that reveals how\nsomething being an uncle is at least partially a matter of how it is\nrelated to things that aren\u2019t part of it. In particular, it is\nplausible to think that the reason being an uncle is non-intrinsic is\nthat for \\(x\\) to be an uncle is for \\(x\\) to have a sibling that has\na child, where this child fails to be part of \\(x\\). More generally,\nit is plausible that, if being \\(F\\) is a non-intrinsic property, then\nthe fact that it is non-intrinsic can be revealed by analysing being\n\\(F\\) in terms of more fundamental properties and relations in a\nmanner that reveals how something being \\(F\\) may partly be a matter\nof being related to a non-part or may be partly a matter of how\nnon-parts are. If this is true, then it has the following two\nconsequences. First, it follows that every fundamental property is\nintrinsic, since it being non-intrinsic cannot be revealed by analysis\nin terms of more fundamental properties and relations. Secondly, and\neven more importantly, it follows that whether a property is intrinsic\nshould be analysable in terms of how that property can be analysed in\nterms of the fundamental properties and relations.\n\nLewis in effect adopts the above approach to analysing intrinsicality\nby analysing intrinsicality in terms of a particular kind of\nsupervenience on the fundamental properties and relations.\nLewis\u2019s 1986 account (formulated so as to be compatible with\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds) consists of (15)\nand (16).\n\n(15)\n \\(p\\) is an\nintrinsic property iff (i) \\(p\\) is a property, and (ii) for any \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), and for any worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that \\(x\\) at\n\\(w_1\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(w_2\\), \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) at \\(w_1\\)\niff \\(y\\) has \\(p\\) at \\(w_2\\).\n\n\n(16)\n \\(x\\) at \\(w_1\\)\nis a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(w_2\\) iff there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence \\(f\\) between \\(x\\)\u2019s parts at \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(y\\)\u2019s parts at \\(w_2\\) such that, for any perfectly natural\nproperty or relation \\(R\\), for any \\(x_1, x_2,\\ldots\\) that are part\nof \\(x\\) at \\(w_1\\): \\(x_1, x_2\\ldots\\) stand in \\(R\\) at \\(w_1\\) iff\n\\(f(x_1), f(x_2)\\ldots\\) stand in \\(R\\) at \\(w_2\\). \n\n\nLewis\u2019s account, which I will call perfect naturalness account\n1, is best seen as an attempt at analysing duplication preservation,\nrather than as analysing identity interiority which we argued in\nsection\n 2.5\n is the dominant notion of intrinsicality in philosophy. This account\nrests heavily on the claim that all perfectly natural properties are\nintrinsic, and, implicitly, that the perfectly natural properties and\nrelations are sufficient to characterise the world completely. The\nlast assumption is needed because the theory rules out the possibility\nthat there are two things that share all their perfectly natural\nproperties and lack proper parts, but differ with respect to some of\ntheir intrinsic properties.\n\nThe first assumption that all perfectly natural properties are\nintrinsic has been rejected by Weatherson (2006). (See also Yablo 1999\nwho holds that, even if every perfectly natural property is intrinsic,\nthis fact is at best a lucky accident and that this renders\nLewis\u2019s account unsuccessful as a philosophical account of\nintrinsicality.) Weatherson claims that it is metaphysically possible\nfor the instantiated perfectly natural properties to be vector\nproperties. He then argues that, since vector properties must be\nextrinsic, it follows that at least some perfectly natural properties\nfail to be intrinsic, namely the perfectly natural properties\ninstantiated at such worlds. The claim that vector properties need to\nbe extrinsic, however, is highly contentious. It is natural to\nunderstand a vector property to be a property that is usefully\nrepresented for theoretical purposes by a certain kind of mathematical\nobject, namely a vector. Given this construal, however, there is no\nreason to think that vector properties cannot be intrinsic. For\nexample, due to the similarity relationships between colours\nrepresented by the colour solid it might be useful to represent\ncolours by vectors. However, doing this is compatible with\nmetaphysical theories of colour on which colours are intrinsic. There\nmight be other conceptions of being a vector property on which vector\nproperties cannot be intrinsic. However, it is unclear whether there\nan conception of vector properties on which they cannot be intrinsic\nbut can be fundamental. (See Busse (2009) and Marshall (2016b) for\nmore discussion.)\n\nThe second assumption, that the perfectly natural properties and\nrelations are sufficient to characterise each possible world, has been\nrejected by Sider (1995) and Schaffer (2004). Both claim that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be endless sequences of more and\nmore natural properties, without any set of perfectly natural\nproperties out of which all the other properties can be defined. In\nresponse to this problem, Sider (1993b) has proposed a modification of\nLewis\u2019s account which he claims is consistent with there being\nsuch endless sequences of more and more natural properties. Sider\n(2011) and Marshall (2016b) have recently argued in favour of the\nsecond assumption, with Sider\u2019s argument appealing to his Humean\ntheory of metaphysical possibility.\n\nAs noted above, Lewis\u2019s account fails to provide an account of\nidentity interiority, which is the most standard notion of\nintrinsicality, and at best provides an analysis of duplication\npreservation. Marshall 2016b has recently provided an account in terms\nof perfect naturalness that, if successful, does provide an analysis\nof identity interiority. If this account works, it can also be\nmodified to provide analyses of the other notions of intrinsicality\ndescribed in section\n 2.4.\n\nThe basic idea behind this alternative account of intrinsicality,\nwhich I will call perfect naturalness account 2, is that the\nascription of a property to a thing is intrinsically about that thing\niff the ascription can be expressed in fundamental terms while only\nreferring to, and quantifying over, the parts of \\(x\\). (A similar\naccount is briefly sketched in Skow 2007, p. 112.) In more detail,\nperfect naturalness account 2 first analyses intrinsicality in terms\nof intrinsic aboutness by (3).\n\n(3)\n \\(p\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), the\nascription of \\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\). \n\n\nIt then provides an account of intrinsic aboutness in terms of perfect\nnaturalness and qualitivity by (17), where qualitivity is analysed by\n(Q). (In (17) and (Q), perfectly natural operators and quantifiers are\nfundamental operators and quantifiers.)\n\n(17)\n \\(s\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\) iff \\(s\\) is a non-qualitative\nstate of affairs that can be expressed by a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\ncontaining at most brackets, commas, lambda abstractors, names\nreferring to parts of \\(x\\), predicates expressing perfectly natural\nproperties and relations, operator expressions expressing perfectly\nnatural operators, and quantifier expressions that express perfectly\nnatural quantifiers and whose occurrences in \\(\\phi\\) quantify only\nover parts of \\(x\\). \n\n\n(Q)\n \\(p\\) is a\nqualitative property iff \\(p\\) is a property, and \\(p\\) can be\nexpressed by a predicate containing at most brackets, commas,\nvariables, lambda abstractors, predicates expressing perfectly natural\nrelations, quantifier expressions expressing perfectly natural\nquantifiers, and operator expressions expressing perfectly natural\noperators. \n\n\n(17) entails that any state of affairs that is intrinsically about\nsomething is non-qualitative. This consequence of (17) can be\njustified by noting that, if \\(s\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\), then\nthere must be at least one particular thing that it is about, and\nhence it cannot be a qualitative state of affairs.\n\n(17), as it stands, fails to provide a completely specified account of\nintrinsic aboutness, since it contains the locution \u2018quantifies\nonly over parts of \\(x\\)\u2019 which needs to be defined, and giving\nthe needed definition is not straightforward. The account of\n\u2018quantifying over parts of \\(x\\)\u2019 given by perfect\nnaturalness account 2 can be simplified if we assume that\n\u2018some\u2019 expresses the only perfectly natural quantifier.\nSay that a property \\(p\\) necessitates a property \\(q\\) iff,\nnecessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) then \\(x\\) has \\(q\\).\nIf \\(\\Phi\\) is a set of formulas, let \\(\\bigvee\\Phi\\) be the\ndisjunction of the formulas in \\(\\Phi\\). (So \\(\\bigvee\\{\\phi_1 ,\n\\phi_2,\\ldots\\}\\) = \\(\\ulcorner\\phi_1 \\vee \\phi_2\n\\vee\\ldots\\urcorner\\).) Given these definitions and the above\nsimplifying assumption, perfect naturalness account 2 endorses (18),\nwhere \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are predicates expressing properties and\n\u2018\\(\\leq\\)\u2019 symbolises \u2018is part of\u2019.\n\n(18)\n The initial occurrence of \u2018Some\u2019 in \\(\\ulcorner\n[\\text{Some } v|Fv]Gv\\urcorner\\) quantifies only over parts of \\(x\\)\niff, for any set \\(\\Pi \\) of names of all the parts of \\(x\\), the\nproperty expressed by \\(F\\) necessitates the property expressed by\n\\(\\ulcorner\\lambda v\\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq a\\urcorner \\mid\na\\in\\Pi\\}\\urcorner\\). \n\n\nFor example, according to this account, if \\(d\\) has exactly three\nproper parts (which are \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)), then\n\u2018some\u2019 in \u2018[Some \\(v \\mid Fv](Gv)\\)\u2019\nquantifies only over parts of \\(d\\) iff the property of being \\(F\\)\nnecessitates the property of being part of either \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\)\nor \\(d\\) (that is, iff, necessarily, any thing that is \\(F\\) is part\nof either \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) or \\(d\\)). More generally, this account\nendorses (19).\n\n(19)\n For any formulas\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\), the initial occurrence of \u2018Some\u2019 in\n\\(\\ulcorner [\\text{Some }v\\mid \\phi]\\psi\\urcorner\\) quantifies only\nover parts of \\(x\\) iff, for any set \\(\\Pi\\) of names of all the parts\nof \\(x\\), under any assignment \\(g\\) to the free variables in \\(\\phi\\)\nthat are not \\(v\\), the property expressed by \\(\\ulcorner\\lambda\nv\\phi\\urcorner\\) necessitates the property expressed by\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ulcorner\\lambda v\\big( \\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq u \\urcorner \\mid u&\n\\text{ is a free variable in } \\phi \\text{ that is not } v\\} \\\\\n &\\vee \\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq a\\urcorner \\mid a\\in\\Pi\\}\\urcorner.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nGiven the simplifying assumption that \u2018some\u2019 is the only\nperfectly natural quantifier expression, (3), (17), (Q) and (19)\nprovide the complete account of what it is for a property to be\nintrinsic according to perfect naturalness account 2.\n\nAs with perfect naturalness account 1, perfect naturalness account 2\nassumes that each perfectly natural property is intrinsic and that the\nperfectly natural properties, relations, operators and quantifiers are\nable to completely describe every possible world. If someone rejects\nthese assumptions, they will therefore be unable to endorse this\naccount.\n3.3 Non-Disjunctivity Theories\n\nInstead of analysing intrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness,\none might try to analyse it in terms of non-disjunctivity, where\nnon-disjunctivity is regarded as an objective metaphysical feature of\nproperties rather than merely a syntactical feature of predicates. The\nmost prominent attempt to do this is the account of Langton and Lewis\n1998. (A similar theory is in an appendix to Zimmerman 1997.)\n\nLangton and Lewis\u2019s account involves the following three steps.\nFirst, they analyse the non-disjunctive properties as follows:\n\n[T]he disjunctive properties [are] those properties that can\nbe expressed by a disjunction of (conjunctions of) natural properties;\nbut that are not themselves natural properties. (Or, if naturalness\nadmits of degrees, they are much less natural than the disjuncts in\nterms of which they can be expressed.) (Langton and Lewis 1998: 61,\nauthor\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nSecondly, they say a property is basic intrinsic iff it is\nnon-disjunctive, is not the negation of a disjunctive property, and is\nindependent of accompaniment. Finally, they say that (i) two objects\nare duplicates iff they share the same basic intrinsic properties, and\n(ii) \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff two duplicates never differ\nwith respect to it.\n\nThe last step of their account is in a form that requires\nLewis\u2019s concretist theory of possible worlds. The last step in a\nform suitable for a typical abstractionist theory of possible worlds\nis instead:\n\n\\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v\\) iff, for any basic\nintrinsic property \\(P, x\\) has \\(P\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(P\\) at\n\\(v\\); and\n\\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and for any\npossible worlds \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) such that \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(F\\)\nat \\(v\\).\n\n\nNote that (ii) is just the abstractionist version of the duplication\ncharacterisation for intrinsicality given by (13) in section\n 2.4.\n\nLangton and Lewis claim their account works given a variety of ways of\nunderstanding \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018more natural\nthan\u2019 in their analysis of \u2018non-disjunctive\u2019. In\nparticular, they hold that the account will work if\n\u2018natural\u2019 is understood to express the notion of perfect\nnaturalness, or fundamentality, in the Lewis (1986a) account, and\n\u2018more natural than\u2019 is understood to mean \u2018is more\nfundamental than\u2019. They also claim that the account will work if\nthe natural properties are those taken to correspond to Armstrongian\nuniversals, or the properties expressed by the predicates in canonical\nformulations of physics, or the properties expressed by the predicates\nin canonical formulations of common-sense. Langton and Lewis say that\nit should not matter how we draw the distinction between natural and\nnon-natural properties for present purposes, as long as we have it,\nand properties like being lonely and round or accompanied and\ncubical are not natural. As a result of this, Langton and Lewis\nthink that their account is more neutral than Lewis\u2019s earlier\naccount and should therefore should appeal to a larger range of\nphilosophers than the earlier account.\n\nLangton and Lewis put forward their account as only an analysis of\nqualitative intrinsic properties, rather than intrinsic properties in\ngeneral. Their account, however, arguably fails as an account of\nqualitative identity interior properties since, given numbers\nnecessarily exist, it classifies being such that there is a number as\nintrinsic. Therefore, like the Lewis 1986a account, the Langton and\nLewis account is arguably most charitably interpreted as an account of\nduplication preservation, or perhaps of qualitative metaphysical\nnecessitation interiority.\n\nIn addition to failing to give an account of the standard account of\nintrinsicality, there are reasons to think that Langton and Lewis\ncannot be as neutral as they claim to be regarding what account of\nnaturalness is combined with their account. As noted above, Langton\nand Lewis claim that their account of intrinsicality is compatible\nwith any construal of naturalness on which the natural properties are\nthose that play a special role in our thinking. On one such conception\nof naturalness, the natural properties include those properties for\nwhich we have simple words or concepts, which do not strike us as\nstrange or odd, and on which we have relied in past inductions (Sider\n2001: 362). Given this conception of naturalness, the property of\nbeing a rock is a natural property, and hence is classified as\nintrinsic on the Langton and Lewis account. However, as Sider 2001\nargues, being a rock is plausibly not an intrinsic property. Just as\nan object that is qualitatively intrinsically the same as a house and\nis a large part of a house is not itself a house, an object that is\nqualitatively intrinsically the same as a rock and is a large part of\na rock is not itself a rock. Hence, whether something is a rock is\npartly a matter of what is the case outside of it. Hence, contra the\ncombination of the Langton and Lewis account with the above conception\nof naturalness, being a rock is not intrinsic.\n\nAnother objection to the Langton and Lewis account is that there\nappear to be counterexamples to the account, even given Lewis\u2019s\nfavoured conception of naturalness. On this conception, the perfectly\nnatural properties and relations are the fundamental properties and\nrelations, and a property \\(p\\) is more natural than a property \\(q\\)\niff the shortest definition of \\(p\\) in terms of the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations is shorter than the shortest definition of\n\\(q\\) in terms of the perfectly natural properties and relations. (See\n(Lewis 1986: 61).) As Marshall and Parsons 2001 argue, given this\nconstrual of naturalness, the property of being such that there is a\ncube appears to be neither a disjunctive property nor the negation of a\ndisjunctive property according to Langton and Lewis\u2019s account of\ndisjunctivity. If this is the case, however, then, since being such\nthat there is a cube is independent of accompaniment, the Langton and\nLewis account classifies this property as a basic intrinsic property,\nand hence classifies it as an intrinsic property. This property,\nhowever, is clearly not intrinsic.\n\nLangton and Lewis 2001 have responded to this objection by claiming\nthat being such that there is a cube is less natural than both being a\ncube and being accompanied by a cube, since (I) being such that there\nis a cube can be expressed as the disjunction \u2018being either a\ncube or accompanied by a cube\u2019, (II) disjoining unrelated\nproperties always reduces naturalness, and (III) being a cube and\nbeing accompanied by a cube are unrelated properties. One problem with\nthis response is that it is not obvious why (II) is meant to be true\ngiven Lewis\u2019s favoured conception of naturalness above, or what\nother notion of naturalness it might be true of. A second problem with\nthe response is that, even granting (II) is true, it is not clear what\nit is for two properties to be unrelated in the sense that is at issue\nin (II), and hence it is not clear why being a cube and being\naccompanied by a cube are meant to be unrelated. For further\ndiscussion of attempts to analyse intrinsicality in terms of\nnon-disjunctivity, see the supplementary document:\n\nMore on Non-Disjunctive Theories.\n \n3.4 Contractionist Theories\n\nOne attractive idea is that a thing\u2019s intrinsic properties are\nthose properties it would have if it were alone in the world. An\nelegant theory of intrinsicality that develops this idea is that of\nPeter Vallentyne (1997).\n\nVallentyne defines a contraction of a world as \u201ca world\n\u2018obtainable\u2019 from the original one solely by\n\u2018removing\u2019 objects from it.\u201d (211) As a special case\nof this, an \\(x-t\\) contraction, where \\(x\\) is an object and \\(t\\) a\ntime, is \u201ca world \u2018obtainable\u2019 from the original one\nby, to the greatest extent possible, \u2018removing\u2019 all\nobjects wholly distinct from \\(x\\), all spatial locations not occupied\nby \\(x\\), and all times (temporal states of the world) except \\(t\\),\nfrom the world\u201d, as well as all laws of nature from the world.\n(211) Vallentyne claims that \\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, for any thing\n\\(x\\), for any time \\(t\\), and for any worlds \\(u\\) and \\(w\\) such\nthat \\(u\\) is an \\(x-t\\) contraction of \\(w, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at\n\\(u\\) iff \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at \\(w\\). In short, a property is\nintrinsic to an object iff removing the rest of the world\ndoesn\u2019t change whether the object has the property.\nVallentyne\u2019s account classifies identity properties, like being\nObama, as intrinsic. It is therefore best seen as an account of\ninteriority. The account also classifies all indiscriminately\nnecessary properties as intrinsic. It is therefore arguably most\ncharitably interpreted as an account of metaphysical necessitation\ninteriority\n\nAs Vallentyne notes, this definition will not be very enlightening\nunless we understand the idea of a contraction. This seems related to\nthe objection Langton and Lewis (1998) urge against Vallentyne. They\nsay that Vallentyne\u2019s account reduces to the claim that a\nproperty is intrinsic iff possession of it never differs between an\nobject and its lonely duplicates, a claim they think is true but too\ntrivial to count as an analysis. Their position is that we cannot\nunderstand contractions without understanding duplication, but if we\nunderstand duplication then intrinsicality can be easily defined, so\nVallentyne\u2019s theory is no advance.\n\nThis criticism might be too quick. Stephen Yablo (1999) has argued\nthat Vallentyne should best be understood as working within a very\ndifferent metaphysical framework than Lewis. For Lewis, no (ordinary)\nobject exists at more than one world, so Vallentyne\u2019s\ncontractions, being separate worlds, must contain separate objects.\nHence \\(x-t\\) contractions can be nothing other than lonely\nduplicates, and the theory is trivial. Yablo suggests that the theory\nbecomes substantive relative to a metaphysical background in which the\nvery same object can appear in different worlds. If this is the case\nthen we can get a grip on contractions without thinking about\nduplications \u2014 the \\(x-t\\) contraction of a world is the world\nthat contains \\(x\\) itself, and as few other things as possible.\n\nThere are, however, problems with Yablo\u2019s defense of\nVallentyne\u2019s contractionist approach to intrinsicality. One\nproblem, discussed in Parsons 2007 and Marshall 2014, is that, on\nYablo\u2019s version of contractionism, we need to be able to make\nsense of sentences like \u2018In \\(w\\), Prince Philip is not a\nhusband\u2019, where \\(w\\) is the world consisting of just Prince\nPhilip. Making sense of such sentences, however, is difficult without\nappealing to the distinction between intrinsic and non-intrinsic\nproperties. Appealing to this distinction when interpreting\nYablo\u2019s account, however, would render it circular. \n3.5 Grounding Theories\n\nOver the last few years, there have been a number of attempts to\nanalyse intrinsicality in terms of metaphysical grounding, a prominent\ninstance of which is that of Rosen (2010). Other accounts of\nintrinsicality in terms of grounding include those of Witmer, Butchard\nand Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013), and Witmer (2014).\nFor a discussion of the first two of these accounts, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nMore on Grounding Theories of Intrinsicality.\n \n\nThe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(A\\) is grounded by\nthe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(B\\) iff \\(A\\) in\nvirtue of it being the case that \\(B\\), where the relevant notion of\n\u201cin virtue\u201d is meant to be a metaphysically explanatory\none. Grounding is supposed to be a metaphysical analogue of causation:\njust as causation is what connects the explanans of an explanation\nwith its explanandum in causal explanation, grounding is meant to be\nwhat connects the explanans of an explanation with its explanandum in\nmetaphysical explanation. An example of a metaphysical explanation\nwould be an explanation of why a certain type of act is wrong in terms\nof more fundamental moral facts.\n\nRosen\u2019s account presupposes Russellianism about facts, according\nto which facts are structured out of things, properties and operators\nin the same kind of way sentences are built up out of names,\npredicates and operator expressions. Given this background,\nRosen\u2019s analysis can be stated as follows:\n\n\\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\): (i) if\nthe ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact with\nconstituent \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) is part of \\(x\\); and (ii) if the\nnegation of the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact\nwith constituent \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) is part of \\(x\\)\n\n\nGiven the negation of the ascription of being Obama to Clinton is\ngrounded by the negation of the ascription of identity to Obama and\nClinton (a claim plausibly required by Rosen\u2019s account) the\naccount classifies being Obama as non-intrinsic since Obama is not\npart of Clinton. The analysis also classifies intuitively\nnon-intrinsic indiscriminately necessary properties, such as the\nproperty of being such that there is a number, as non-intrinsic. Being\nsuch that there is a number is classified as non-intrinsic by the\naccount since, for example, its ascription to Obama is grounded by the\nfact that 2 is a number, which has a constituent, namely the number 2,\nthat is not part of Obama. These consequences of the account suggest\nthat it is best thought of as an account of the distinction between\nlocal and non-local properties.\n\nMarshall (2015) has given the following objection to Rosen\u2019s\naccount. (The objection is meant to generalise to all attempts to\nanalyse intrinsically in terms of grounding, including the attempts of\nWitmer, Butchard and Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013) and\nWitmer (2014). For an objection that is meant to apply to\nRosen\u2019s account, but not Bader\u2019s account, see Bader\n2013:fn. 53.) According to the objection: a) there is nothing\nincoherent in supposing that a state of affairs that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) might ground a state of affairs that is intrinsically\nabout something that is wholly distinct from \\(x\\), and b) on a number\nof popular metaphysical theories, there are such grounding\nrelationships. If there are such grounding relationships, however,\nRosen\u2019s account fails.\n\nTo consider an example of such a grounding relationship, let us assume\nthat standard set theory is necessarily true, and that existence is a\nlocal property. (If one thinks that existence is not a local property,\nperhaps because one thinks that existence is the non-local\nquantificational property of being such that, among all the things\nthere are, there is something that is identical to one, replace\nexistence with the property of being such that, among all the parts of\none, there is something identical to one, which is intuitively local.)\nLet us also assume the common (though not universal) view that members\nof sets are not literally parts of those sets. (See Lewis (1986a) for\nan example of a prominent theory of sets that denies members of sets\nare parts of those sets.) Given these assumptions, it is plausible\nthat the fact that \\(\\{Obama\\}\\) exists is grounded by the fact that\nObama exists. However, if this is correct, then, since the fact that\nObama exists has a constituent that is not part of \\(\\{Obama\\}\\), it\nfollows that Rosen\u2019s account falsely classifies existence as a\nnon-local property.\n\nBorrowing from the recent account of Witmer (2014) (which is similar\nto Rosen\u2019s account), we might attempt to fix Rosen\u2019s\naccount by replacing parthood in the account with ontological\ndependence, where the relation of ontological dependence is defined by\n(20).\n\n(20)\n \\(x\\) ontologically depends on \\(y\\) iff the fact that \\(y\\)\nexists at least partly grounds the fact that \\(x\\) exists.\n\n\nApplying this modification to Rosen\u2019s account results in\n(21).\n\n(21)\n \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\):\n(i) if the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact with\nconstituent \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) ontologically depends on \\(y\\); and (ii)\nif the negation of the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a\nfact with constituent \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) ontologically depends on\n\\(y\\).\n\n\nThis modified version of Rosen\u2019s account appears to correctly\nclassify existence as a local property given the above metaphysical\ntheses. Given these metaphysical theses, however, it arguably ends up\nclassifying too many properties as local. For example, given the above\ntheses, it appears to classify the property of having a member as a\nlocal property. It does this, since, given the above metaphysical\ntheses, necessarily, if \\(x\\) has a member, then the fact that \\(x\\)\nhas a member is plausibly grounded by the fact that \\(y\\) is a member\nof \\(x\\), where \\(y\\) is some member of \\(x\\), and where \\(x\\) is\nontologically dependent on \\(y\\). Provided members of sets\naren\u2019t parts of those sets, however, the property of having a\nmember appears to be just as non-local as the property of having\nsomething be two meters away from one. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Audi, Paul, 2019, \u201cPartial Resemblance and Property\nImmanence\u201d, <em>No\u00fbs</em> 53 (4): 884\u2013903.", "Bader, Ralf, 2013, \u201cTowards a Hyperintensional Theory of\nIntrinsicality\u201d, <em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 110:\n525\u2013563.", "Barwise, Jon and John Perry, 1983, <em>Situations and\nAttitudes</em>, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.", "Bricker, Phillip, 1993, \u201cThe Fabric of Space: Intrinsic Vs.\nExtrinsic Distance Relations\u201d, in P.
