    "main_text": "Structure in Chemistry || The Chemical Bond\n4.2 The Chemical Bond\n\nAs structural theory gained widespread acceptance at the end of the\n19th century, chemists began focusing their attention on\nwhat connects the atoms together, constraining the spatial\nrelationships between these atoms. In other words, they began\ninvestigating the chemical bond. Modern theoretical accounts of\nchemical bonding are quantum mechanical, but even contemporary\nconceptions of bonds owe a huge amount to the classical conception of\nbonds developed by G.N. Lewis at the very beginning of the\n20th century.\nThe Classical Chemical Bond\n\nG.N. Lewis (1875\u20131946) was responsible for the first influential\ntheory of the chemical bond (Lewis 1923; see Kohler 1971, 1975 for\nbackground). His theory said that chemical bonds are pairs of\nelectrons shared between atoms. Lewis also distinguished between what\ncame to be called ionic and covalent compounds,\nwhich has proved to be remarkably resilient in modern chemistry.\n\nIonic compounds are composed of electrically charged ions, usually\narranged in a neutral crystal lattice. Neutrality is achieved when the\npositively charged ions (cations) are of exactly the right number to\nbalance the negatively charged ions (anions). Crystals of common salt,\nfor example, comprise as many sodium cations (Na+) as there\nare chlorine anions (Cl\u2212). Compared to the isolated\natoms, the sodium cation has lost an electron and the chlorine anion\nhas gained an electron.\n\nCovalent compounds, on the other hand, are either individual molecules\nor indefinitely repeating structures. In either case, Lewis thought\nthat they are formed from atoms bound together by shared pairs of\nelectrons. Hydrogen gas is said to consist of molecules composed of\ntwo hydrogen atoms held together by a single, covalent bond; oxygen\ngas, of molecules composed of two oxygen atoms and a double bond;\nmethane, of molecules composed of four equivalent carbon-hydrogen\nsingle bonds, and silicon dioxide (sand) crystals of indefinitely\nrepeating covalently bonded arrays of SiO2 units.\n\nAn important part of Lewis\u2019 account of molecular structure concerns\ndirectionality of bonding. In ionic compounds, bonding is\nelectrostatic and therefore radially symmetrical. Hence an individual\nion bears no special relationship to any one of its neighbors. On the\nother hand, in covalent or non-polar bonding, bonds have a definite\ndirection; they are located between atomic centers.\n\nThe nature of the covalent bond has been the subject of considerable\ndiscussion in the recent philosophy of chemistry literature (Berson\n2008; Hendry 2008; Weisberg 2008). While the chemical bond plays a\ncentral role in chemical predictions, interventions, and explanations,\nit is a difficult concept to define precisely. Fundamental\ndisagreements exist between classical and quantum mechanical\nconceptions of the chemical bond, and even between different quantum\nmechanical models. Once one moves beyond introductory textbooks to\nadvanced treatments, one finds many theoretical approaches to bonding,\nbut few if any definitions or direct characterizations of the bond\nitself. While some might attribute this lack of definitional clarity\nto common background knowledge shared among all chemists, we believe\nthis reflects uncertainty or maybe even ambivalence about the status\nof the chemical bond itself.\n",
