    "main_text": "Tackling the First Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma || The combinatorial approach\n3.5 The combinatorial approach\n\nAn alternative attempt to use probabilistic reasoning to produce an\na priori justification for inductive inferences is the\nso-called \u201ccombinatorial\u201d solution. This was first put\nforward by Donald C. Williams (1947) and later developed by David\nStove (1986).\n\nLike the Bayes-Laplace argument, the solution relies heavily on the\nidea that straightforward a priori calculations can be done\nin a \u201cdirect inference\u201d from population to sample. As we\nhave seen, given a certain population frequency, the probability of\ngetting different frequencies in a sample can be calculated\nstraightforwardly based on the rules of the probability calculus. The\nBayes-Laplace argument relied on inverting the probability\ndistribution using Bayes\u2019 rule to get from the sampling\ndistribution to the posterior distribution. Williams instead proposes\nthat the inverse inference may be based on a certain logical\nsyllogism: the proportional (or statistical) syllogism.\n\nThe proportional, or statistical syllogism, is the following:\n\nOf all the things that are M, \\(m/n\\) are\nP.\na is an M\n\n\nTherefore, a is P, with probability \\(m/n\\).\n\nFor example, if 90% of rabbits in a population are white and we\nobserve a rabbit a, then the proportional syllogism says that\nwe infer that a is white with a probability of 90%. Williams\nargues that the proportional syllogism is a non-deductive logical\nsyllogism, which effectively interpolates between the syllogism for\nentailment\n\nAll Ms are P\na is an M\n\n\nTherefore, a is P.\n\nAnd the syllogism for contradiction\n\nNo M is P\na is M\n\n\nTherefore, a is not P.\n\nThis syllogism can be combined with an observation about the behavior\nof increasingly large samples. From calculations of the sampling\ndistribution, it can be shown that as the sample size increases, the\nprobability that the sample frequency is in a range which closely\napproximates the population frequency also increases. In fact,\nBernoulli\u2019s law of large numbers states that the probability\nthat the sample frequency approximates the population frequency tends\nto one as the sample size goes to infinity. Williams argues that such\nresults support a \u201cgeneral over-all premise, common to all\ninductions, that samples \u2018match\u2019 their populations\u201d\n(Williams 1947: 78).\n\nWe can then apply the proportional syllogism to samples from a\npopulation, to get the following argument:\n\nMost samples match their population\nS is a sample.\n\n\nTherefore, S matches its population, with high\nprobability.\n\nThis is an instance of the proportional syllogism, and it uses the\ngeneral result about samples matching populations as the first major\npremise.\n\nThe next step is to argue that if we observe that the sample contains\na proportion of \\(m/n\\) Fs, then we can conclude that since\nthis sample with high probability matches its population, the\npopulation, with high probability, has a population frequency that\napproximates the sample frequency \\(m/n\\). Both Williams and Stove\nclaim that this amounts to a logical a priori solution to the\nproblem of induction.\n\nA number of authors have expressed the view that the Williams-Stove\nargument is only valid if the sample S is drawn randomly from\nthe population of possible samples\u2014i.e., that any sample is as\nlikely to be drawn as any other (Brown 1987; Will 1948; Giaquinto\n1987). Sometimes this is presented as an objection to the application\nof the proportional syllogism. The claim is that the proportional\nsyllogism is only valid if a is drawn randomly from the\npopulation of Ms. However, the response has been that there\nis no need to know that the sample is randomly drawn in order to apply\nthe syllogism (Maher 1996; Campbell 2001; Campbell & Franklin\n2004). Certainly if you have reason to think that your sampling\nprocedure is more likely to draw certain individuals than\nothers\u2014for example, if you know that you are in a certain\nlocation where there are more of a certain type\u2014then you should\nnot apply the proportional syllogism. But if you have no such reasons,\nthe defenders claim, it is quite rational to apply it. Certainly it is\nalways possible that you draw an unrepresentative sample\u2014meaning\none of the few samples in which the sample frequency does not match\nthe population frequency\u2014but this is why the conclusion is only\nprobable and not certain.\n\nThe more problematic step in the argument is the final step, which\ntakes us from the claim that samples match their populations with high\nprobability to the claim that having seen a particular sample\nfrequency, the population from which the sample is drawn has frequency\nclose to the sample frequency with high probability. The problem here\nis a subtle shift in what is meant by \u201chigh probability\u201d,\nwhich has formed the basis of a common misreading of\nBernouilli\u2019s theorem. Hacking (1975: 156\u201359) puts the\npoint in the following terms. Bernouilli\u2019s theorem licenses the\nclaim that much more often than not, a small interval around the\nsample frequency will include the true population frequency. In other\nwords, it is highly probable in the sense of \u201cusually\nright\u201d to say that the sample matches its population. But this\ndoes not imply that the proposition that a small interval around the\nsample will contain the true population frequency is highly probable\nin the sense of \u201ccredible on each occasion of use\u201d. This\nwould mean that for any given sample, it is highly credible that the\nsample matches its population. It is quite compatible with the claim\nthat it is \u201cusually right\u201d that the sample matches its\npopulation to say that there are some samples which do not match their\npopulations at all. Thus one cannot conclude from Bernouilli\u2019s\ntheorem that for any given sample frequency, we should assign high\nprobability to the proposition that a small interval around the sample\nfrequency will contain the true population frequency. But this is\nexactly the slide that Williams makes in the final step of his\nargument. Maher (1996) argues in a similar fashion that the last step\nof the Williams-Stove argument is fallacious. In fact, if one wants to\ndraw conclusions about the probability of the population frequency\ngiven the sample frequency, the proper way to do so is by using the\nBayesian method described in the previous section. But, as we there\nsaw, this requires the assignment of prior probabilities, and this\nexplains why many people have thought that the combinatorial solution\nsomehow illicitly presupposed an assumption like the principle of\nindifference. The Williams-Stove argument does not in fact give us an\nalternative way of inverting the probabilities which somehow bypasses\nall the issues that Bayesians have faced.\n",
