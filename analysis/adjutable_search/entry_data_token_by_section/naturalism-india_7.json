Methodological Naturalism: Ny\u0101ya Epistemology\n\nMethodological naturalism is the view that regards science and\nphilosophy as continuous. \u2018Methodological naturalists\u2019,\nwrites Papineau (2007), \u2018see philosophy and science as engaged\nin essentially the same enterprise, pursuing similar ends and using\nsimilar methods.\u2019 In classical Indian philosophical systems, we\nfind instances of method continuity as well as result continuity. In\nthis context, we shall discuss mainly the Ny\u0101ya view, for the\nNy\u0101ya methodology of scientific and epistemic investigation was\nadopted by other philosophical schools too.\n\nIn the West, the relation between science and philosophy has been\nalmost symbiotic. Sciences separated from philosophy only after\nattaining maturity, developed to their full capacity, proliferated\ninto different branches and, when the circle was complete, all the\noff-springs started coming closer to the parent disciplines to form an\ninter-disciplinary consortium. But even when sciences went their own\nway, a special branch of philosophy, traditional epistemology,\ncontinued to guard their foundation and police their frontiers with\nthe help of its unique method. Thus, in a second moment of fission,\nscience and philosophy were found to differ in contents as well as in\nmethods. In India, however, the fission did not occur so emphatically\nand the borders of different disciplines were never hermetically\nsealed. Consequently, there is science in philosophy and also\ntrans-empirical philosophy in empirical sciences. Different\nphilosophical systems combine the metaphysics of the transcendent with\nthe logic of the mundane and the rules of individual and social\nmorality. We find these systems supplying us with ratiocinative\nprinciples that form the core of a scientific methodology while\nsimultaneously facilitating the process of self-realisation\nculminating in liberation or mok\u1e63a through discourses on the\nnature of reality. Thus with a view to unraveling the real nature of\nexistents (tattvadar\u015bana), philosophical systems indulge in\nquasi-scientific discussions of cosmology, physics, chemistry,\npsychology, biology, and so on. That is why B.N. Seal (1958) has\ncalled these philosophical systems \u2018positive sciences\u2019.\nThus in both method and content philosophy and theoretical sciences\ncoincided to a large extent. Applied (phalita) sciences like alchemy\nand medicine did diverge from philosophy, but there too the influence\nof fundamental philosophical concepts like accredited means of\nknowledge, causality, ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, etc., was conspicuous\non patterns of observation and experimental design.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas are a part of this tradition. One of their most\nsignificant contributions is formulation of a method which forms the\ncore of inquiry in general and so also of scientific inquiry. The\nmethod has four main steps. The first step is to provide an\nenumeration (udde\u015ba) of the divisions of the subject matter. The\nsecond step is to supply a definition (lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) of the\nsubject under consideration, in the form of a distinguishing mark of\nit. The third step is an examination (par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101) of the\ndefinition, and the fourth verification (nir\u1e47aya). Enumeration\nsometimes includes classification (vibh\u0101ga); however, in general,\nclassification comes after definition. Any truth reached by this\nprocedure is raised to the status of an established theory\n(siddh\u0101nta). \u2018Pram\u0101\u1e47as [methods of\nknowledge-acquisition] are operations subsidiary to the ascertainment\nof truth. The methods of special sciences are ancillary to these\npram\u0101\u1e47as\u2019 (P. C. Ray, 1956). It is evident that\nmethodologically there is no difference between science and\nphilosophy, particularly epistemology. In Ny\u0101ya epistemology,\ncommon sense, science, logic and scriptures are all considered to be\ncontinuous with one another.\n\nNaturalized epistemology defines itself in contrast with analytic\nepistemology, which is also often described as\n\u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018mainstream\u2019 epistemology.\nAnalytic epistemology is justification-centric. The\nepistemologists\u2019 preoccupation with the formulation of\nprinciples of epistemic appraisal are geared to meet sceptical\nchallenges. They adopt three main strategies:\n\nThey grant autonomy\nto epistemology, which is meant to provide the basis for all human\nscientific endeavours. Epistemology supposedly possesses an\nArchimedean standpoint or a view from nowhere, something that warrants\nthe objectivity of the sciences. This presupposition led to the\ndissociation between epistemology and psychology.\nThey declare\nthat all epistemic norms of justification are a priori in nature. They\nfurther maintain that providing causal explanation is no part of\nepistemology (Chisholm, 1992). Causal questions and matter of\njustification are to be kept strictly separate. So, according to\ntraditional epistemologists, to judge whether a person\u2019s belief\nthat p counts as knowledge that p, it is sufficient\nto find out if p is connected in the right way to other\npropositions, the rightness of the connection to be determined by\nlogic (Kitcher, 1983). That is, the evidential story and the causal\nstory should be kept strictly separate because the former is\nnecessarily normative, while the latter is descriptive; in providing\nan epistemic justification of a piece of knowledge, it is not\nnecessary to probe the question of its origins.\nAs a follow-up of\nthe Cartesian programme, analytic epistemologists try to ground\nknowledge of the external world on the subject\u2019s knowledge of\ninner experience. Justification thus becomes internalist and knowing\nthat p entails knowing that knowing that p. If this\ncondition is not satisfied, no one can be a responsible knower. (4)\nMost traditional epistemologists also subscribe to the realist\nconception of truth and one determinate theory of reality. (5) They\nare also committed to the No Accident Thesis, which says that beliefs\nexpressed by true sentences are better guides to action than those\nexpressed by false sentences; it is no accident that well-confirmed\nsentences tend to be true.\n\n\nNaturalised epistemologists form a heterogeneous group and not all of\nthem contest all the above features. However, in general\nepistemological naturalists question the first three traits. (a) They\ngive up the privileged autonomous position of epistemology and uphold\nthat epistemology must be continuous with science. (b) Causal\nquestions must form part of epistemology, epistemologists should take\nstock of psychological conditions of cognition. (c) The traditional\ninternalist model of justification being unacceptable, either\nepistemology should give up the task of justification altogether or\nlook for alternative means of justification. Radical naturalists like\nthe early Quine want to replace epistemology by psychology and give up\nthe justification task entirely. Later Quine and more moderate\nnaturalists, on the other hand, re-instate justification but of a\ndifferent kind: some consider justification offered in terms of\ncausally reliable process of belief generation to be adequate, some\nothers admit epistemic justification but retain naturalism by making\nit supervenient on natural facts.\n\nThe most general arguments in favour of the claim that Indian\nepistemic systems are naturalistic are as follows. Each develops its\nrespective theory of veridical cognition and/or knowledge (the term\npram\u0101 is ambiguous) in response to sceptical threats. In spite of\nhaving different metaphysics, most attempt to explain cognition with\nreference to psycho-causal chain. As far as knowledge of the empirical\nworld is concerned, all admit the primacy of perception and thus\nprovide the systems of epistemology with a strong empirical\nfoundation. Indian traditions, in general, as we have seen, sustain a\nmethodological continuity between science and philosophy. Indian\nphilosophers did not feel any need for the a priori/ a posteriori\ndistinction, nor does their theory depend on necessity/possibility or\nanalytic/synthetic distinctions. As a result, they could easily\ncommute between the realm of the normative and that of the\ndescriptive. All these are considerations in favour of a moderate\nmethodological naturalism; however, in the absence of any special\nscientific domain, they do not lend support to the conjecture that\nIndian theory sustains a radical replacement naturalism.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya response to sceptical objections occurs at two levels,\nat the first level enumerating a set of virtuous processes by which\ntrue beliefs are acquired, and the second level dealing with the\nratification of those reliable or virtuous processes of\nbelief-acquisition. Naiy\u0101yikas admit four kinds of\ncognition\u2014perceptual (pratyak\u1e63a) inferential (anumiti),\nthat which arises from comparison (upamiti) and verbal\n(\u015b\u0101bda), and four accredited means of acquiring veridical\ncognition (pram\u0101\u1e47a), viz., perception (pratyak\u1e63a),\ninference (anum\u0101na), comparison (upam\u0101na) and authority\n(\u015babda). They decide the number of the accredited means by\nempirically observing the effectiveness and reliability of the\nrespective means in generating true beliefs. According to them, these\nprocesses generate true beliefs only when accompanied by genuine\nexcellence or epistemic virtue (gu\u1e47a). The virtue that makes a\ngenerating process meritorious differs in each type of true belief. In\ncase of perception the relation of the sense organ with the object\ncharacterised by the property which figures as the qualifier in the\nperceptual cognition is said to be the virtue. For example, when one\nperceives a white shell as white, our sense organ stands in\nappropriate relation with the object of perception, a shell in this\ncase, and apprehends the property whiteness which characterizes the\nshell in question and thus gives rise to a veridical perception. In a\nveridical inferential cognition the mark, which is invariably\nconcomitant with the thing to be inferred, must be known to be present\nin the locus of the inference. For instance, when someone correctly\ninfers fire on a distant hill, it is known to him that smoke, which is\ninvariably concomitant with fire, is present on the hill. In case of\nknowledge by comparison, knowledge of similarity is the excellence,\ne.g., someone rightly identifies an unknown animal as a bison on\nseeing its similarity with a cow which he came to know from an\nexpert\u2019s utterance to the effect that a bison is similar to a\ncow. Finally, in case of verbal knowledge, the speaker\u2019s\nveridical cognition of the state of affairs described by the sentence\nuttered is the excellence, e.g., when an umpire declares a batsman out\nin a cricket match on the basis of his expertise and veridical\ncognition of the state of affairs. A false belief results from the\npresence of some defect (do\u1e63a), and not merely from absence of\nthe required virtue. Someone may perceive a white shell as yellow\nbecause he is suffering from jaundice or because of the yellow tinted\nlight in the room or due to some other defective condition. These\ndefects differ in each instance of false belief. The Naiy\u0101yikas\ntherefore maintain that a false belief is caused by a defect and a\ntrue belief is caused by a virtue. This principle holds in all cases\nand all types of belief\u2014be it commonsensical, scientific, or\nphilosophical.\n\nThe topic of epistemic luck is an important one in this theory. For,\nalthough a defective process usually generates a false belief and a\nmeritorious process generates a true belief, yet some beliefs may be\ntrue by fluke, in spite of being produced by a defective process.\nSuppose someone wrongly perceives mist as smoke and argues, \u2018The\nhill has fire, as it has smoke on it\u2019. Unbeknownst to him, the\nhill actually possesses fire. So this argument yields a veridical\nconclusion though the ground is defective. Or consider the following\nexample (Chakrabarti, 1994): \u2018Suppose that on a Tuesday a cheat\nmistakenly believing it to be Monday says, \u201cToday is\nTuesday\u201d. If the listener does not suspect him to be a cheat, he\nwould \u201cunderstand\u201d that today is a Tuesday. What he would\nunderstand surely would agree with facts.\u2019 Here also the\nresultant cognition is veridical even though it is produced by a\ndefective process. That is why the Naiy\u0101yikas hold the following\nprinciple: if there is a false belief then there must be a defect in\nthe generating process, but not its converse, i.e., if there is a\ndefect in the generating process, then it produces a false belief\n(defects are necessary but not sufficient for error). The problem of\nepistemic luck has led scholars like Sibajiban Bhattacharyya to\ndeclare that the Naiy\u0101yikas did not mean by veridical cognition\n(pram\u0101) a justified true belief. Others, including J.N. Mohanty\n(Mohanty 1992, 2001) contest this view. They rather reconstruct the\nnotion of pram\u0101 as a justified true belief and include the two\nexamples mentioned above in the list of the Gettier-type\ncounter-examples, thereby attempting to accommodate pram\u0101\u1e47a\ntheories within the framework of traditional epistemology.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas beginning with V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra\nsuccinctly uphold that since a belief cannot reveal its own truth, nor\ncan it be grasped in after-perception, it must be apprehended by a\nsubsequent inference following from volition leading to successful\nactivity. An example from the Ny\u0101ya literature will make the\npoint clear. Suppose a thirsty traveller perceives a lake at a\ndistance. Suppose further that all the propitious conditions for a\nveridical perception are present in this case, e.g., the\ntraveller\u2019s vision is not defective, there is adequate light,\nand so on. Yet, if he were ever eluded by a mirage, he might doubt his\nvision. The only way to allay his doubts is, says the Naiy\u0101yika,\nto approach the lake, take a dip in it and drink the water. If he\nfeels cool and his thirst is quenched, he can be sure about the truth\nof his perceptual belief. It is significant that the Naiy\u0101yika\ncalls the volition leading to successful behaviour \u2018samv\u0101di\nprav\u1e5btti\u2019, literally meaning coherent volition.\nOne\u2019s volition is realised into action and he gets his desired\nobject. Thus there is coherence between the object of volition and the\nobject of perception. One\u2019s perceptual belief that there is a\nlake at a distance is true, if and only if, there is a lake at a\ndistance. However, to establish it, he needs further corroboration.\nHis perceptual belief about the lake must cohere with his other\nbeliefs about water, e.g., it quenches thirst, wets a thing, and\ndouses fire, etc., which motivates him to act positively or negatively\nin a particular situation. I think the model of ratification here is\nsimilar to that of the crossword puzzle, which combines moderate\nfoundationalism with coherentism. A belief to be true must have a\ncontent-to-world fit. Yet, until such a belief, produced by an\naccredited means, matches other beliefs in the existing network, the\nbelief cannot be known / believed to be true nor the means of\ngeneration can be warranted. The same theory applies to scientific\nknowledge. They specifically mention the case of \u0100yurveda or the\nscience of medicine. \u0100yurveda is considered a science because\nAyurvedic prescriptions lead to successful action. When a sick man is\ncured by following the prescription of his doctor, he infers the truth\nof the utterance of his doctor and gradually gains confidence in\n\u0100yurveda as a science.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas address the question of ratification in the\ncontext of scriptural injunctions. No knowledge is, according to them,\nself-justified, and scriptural prescriptions are no exception, but\nthey are also not empirically testable. V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra\nsuggests that scriptural injunctions can be verified by trading on\ntheir similarity with medicinal prescriptions: like medicinal\nprescriptions, scriptural prescriptions are also acceptable, since\nboth are uttered by an infallible speaker. It is interesting to note\nin this context that one of the premises of the argument that God is\ninfallible ultimately rests on another accredited belief-generating\nprocess, viz., reliable testimony or authority. And again, when the\nauthority as a means of valid cognition is questioned, there is a fall\nback on inference. Many a times we see the Naiy\u0101yikas paying\nscant attention to obviously circular reasoning. This cannot be due to\ntheir inadvertence or ignorance. Rather, like true naturalists, they\nfavour repairing their boat while still floating. And significantly,\nat no stage in their rebuttal of scepticism do they resort to an\ninternalist mode of justification.\n\nThe naturalism of the Naiy\u0101yikas can be thrown into relief by\ntheir dispute with M\u0101dhyamika Buddhists. The M\u0101dhyamikas\nplay the role of sceptic against the metaphysical realism of\nNy\u0101ya. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna points out that a Naiy\u0101yika\ncannot establish the pram\u0101\u1e47a-hood of a pram\u0101\u1e47a\nby means of another pram\u0101\u1e47a for that will lead to an\ninfinite regress. Nor can the Naiy\u0101yika establish it by pointing\nout its reliable character because that will lead to circularity (a\npiece of cognition is said to be pram\u0101 when it is produced by a\nreliable pram\u0101\u1e47a; to establish the reliability of a\npram\u0101\u1e47a by referring to the fact that it has always been\nsufficient for generating a pram\u0101 is obviously circular). This\nobjection would have been irrefutable if the Naiy\u0101yikas had only\none kind of pram\u0101 and one kind of pram\u0101\u1e47a in their\nepistemic repertoire. But as the Naiy\u0101yikas admit four different\npram\u0101\u1e47as for four different types of pram\u0101, they can\nalways fall back on other pram\u0101\u1e47as when the reliability of\none is questioned: to justify perception, one might take recourse to\ninference, and again to justify inference one can rely on verbal\ncognition. As to establishing the reliability of the verbal cognition,\nthey appeal to inference. As Quine once said, \u2018Such scruples\nagainst circularity have little points once we have stopped dreaming\nof deducing sciences from observation. If we are simply to understand\nthe link between observation and science, we are well advised to use\nany available information, including that provided by the very science\nwhose link with observation we are seeking to understand.\u2019 A\nnaturalist need not be afraid of circularity.\n",
