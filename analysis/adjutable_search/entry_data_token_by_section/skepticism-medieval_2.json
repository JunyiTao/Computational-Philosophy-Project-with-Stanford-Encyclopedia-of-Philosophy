    "main_text": "Ancient and Hellenistic Sources || Academic Skepticism\n1.2 Academic Skepticism\n\nAcademic Skepticism, so-called because of its birth among scholars\nworking in Plato\u2019s Academy, was the type most known to the\nmedievals. Academic skepticism was presented through the sympathetic\nworks of Cicero (De Natura Deorum and Academica,\nprimarily), and especially through many of Augustine\u2019s\nanti-skeptical arguments, such as those found in his Contra\nAcademicos. In fact, for most of the Middle Ages\u2014at least\nup through the 1430s\u2014the term scepticus wasn\u2019t\nused in the Latin tradition; academicus was the most common\nterm for the skeptic. Further complicating matters, the medievals\nfailed to recognize the distinction between Academic and Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism. See Floridi (2002) and Schmitt (1972).\n\nSchmitt\u2019s (1972) study of the textual transmission of\nCicero\u2019s skeptical works brings out many interesting aspects of\nits history. As was the case with Sextus, there were few manuscripts\nof Cicero\u2019s Academica extant in the Middle Ages. In\naddition, there were two versions of it in circulation, and the\nmedievals had only parts of each. And yet another problem for those\nwho had access to the texts was that Cicero\u2019s position was often\nconfused with that of one of his interlocutors in the work,\nLucullus.\n\nHenry of Ghent (late 13th C.) is the first medieval philosopher both\nto have obvious knowledge of the Academica, and to have made\na serious philosophical attempt to come to grips with the views\nexpressed there. When John Duns Scotus critiques Henry\u2019s\nepistemology, he shows no evidence of knowing Cicero\u2019s text. And\nfor the most part, later medievals were equally ignorant of it. Their\ndiscussions of skepticism seem not to have been based on an\nexamination of or engagement with skepticism as presented by ancient\nauthors; it was a skepticism of its own sort, as will be detailed\nbelow.\n",
