This entry\nexamines the development of Western philosophy of music from Greek\nAntiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. Subsequent\ndevelopments are covered by the entry on\n history of western philosophy of music: since 1800.\n\nAesthetic concerns remain in the background of Western philosophical\nthinking on music until the early modern period. Plato and Aristotle\nare interested in music chiefly because of its educational and\npolitical implications, and medieval thinkers typically relate music\nto metaphysical speculations. This relative neglect of music as an art\nmay be surprising, but it is in line with the late emergence of\naesthetics as a branch of philosophy.\n\nToward the end of the Middle Ages, music theorists begin to pay more\nattention to the sensuous dimension of music. Subsequent shifts in\nmusical taste prompt questions regarding the origin and value of\nmusic\u2019s capacity to express and arouse the emotions.\n\nThe eighteenth century develops a system of the arts as the imitation\nof nature. This raises the issue of how music may fit into such a\nsystem. As the instrumental repertoire increases in magnitude and\nrefinement, it becomes clear that an account of music\u2019s position\namong the arts will require an explanation of pure instrumental\nmusic\u2019s meaning and value.\n\nFor book-length introductions to the history of Western philosophy of\nmusic, see: Fubini 1991; Lippman 1992; Bowman 1998; Martinelli 2012\n[2019]; Young forthcoming.

Antiquity\n\nLippman (1992: chapter 1) observes that Greek Antiquity is responsible\nfor two ideas that shaped Western musical thought until at least the\nseventeenth century. The first amounts to a metaphysical\nclaim. While details vary greatly, this is the claim that the laws and\nstructure of music correspond to those of the universe. This view is\nat times supplemented with the additional thought that celestial\nbodies themselves produce music as they follow their orbits. The\nPythagorean concept of cosmic harmony, or harmony of the spheres, is\nthe first known example of the metaphysical conception of music. The\nsecond idea is an ethical view, sometimes referred to as\nethos theory. According to this view, music has the capacity to alter\nmood and mold personality, and thus may contribute to moral education\n(see Lippman 1964: chapter 2).\n\nSome authors, especially those of Pythagorean persuasions, explicitly\nlink the ethical view to the metaphysical one: if the whole universe\nis musical, so is the human soul, hence music\u2019s power over it.\nIn other authors, such as Aristotle, the ethical and educational value\nof music is construed as depending mainly on its capacity to imitate\nor arouse emotions.\n1.1 The Universe as Harmony: Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans\n\nNo writings survive that are directly attributable to Pythagoras (c.\n570\u2013c. 490 BCE). His view of music must therefore be\nreconstructed from the works of other Pythagoreans, or from more or\nless sympathetic accounts provided by other authors (a useful\ncollection of texts is found in Barker 1990: chapter 1). Central to\nPythagorean philosophy is the notion of harmony as the unity of\nvarious parts. In this sense, the concept has a much broader\napplication than to music, for harmony regulates the motion of\ncelestial bodies as well as the human soul (on the concept of harmony\nin ancient Greek philosophical thought, see Lippman 1964: chapter 1).\nIn the Pythagorean tradition, mathematics is the discipline that\ninvestigates harmony. Musical harmony is no exception to this, as the\ninterval of the octave may be expressed as a numerical ratio (2:1).\nThe octave may in turn be considered as the sum of a fifth (3:2) and a\nfourth (4:3). Pythagoras was generally credited with the discovery of\nthe relations between these intervals. These are best illustrated\nusing a monochord, an instrument constituted by a single string, the\nvibrating sections of which are determined by the position of a\nmovable bridge. However, it is unclear whether the monochord was in\nfact used by Pythagoras (Barker 2014: 186), and it is also plausible\nto assume that instrument makers had some understanding of these\nrelations before they became the object of intellectual\nspeculation.\n\nThe series of numbers involved in these ratios (1 to 4, thus adding up\nto 10) was considered sacred by the Pythagoreans, who named it\ntetraktys. This metaphysical view of music as a reflection of\ncosmic order proved to be enormously influential in Western musical\nthought. As the harmony found in music is essentially the same\nprinciple as the one that regulates both the cosmos and the human\nsoul, at least some Pythagoreans thought that their view could explain\nthe effects of music on the listener\u2019s mood and character.\n\nThe most notable opponent of the Pythagorean notion of celestial\nharmony was Aristotle. He offers two main reasons to reject this idea.\nFirst, he argues that physical bodies could not be composed of\nnumbers, for the latter have no weight, whereas the former do\n(Metaphysics, 14.3). Second, he observes that loud sounds\nshatter glass and produce a physical effect upon us. The movement of\nplanets in space, Aristotle argues, would produce an even greater\neffect on us, the absence of which is proof that celestial bodies\nproduce no sound (On the Heavens, 2.9). In addition to\nrejecting the idea of a celestial harmony, Aristotle also rejects the\nrelated notion that the human soul is a kind of harmony (On the\nSoul, 1.4).\n1.2 Mathematical and Empirical Harmonics\n\n\u2018Harmonics\u2019 is the Ancient Greek discipline that studied\nmusical entities, from intervals to scalar systems (Barker 1990: 3).\nThe Pythagorean tradition marked the start of an influential approach\nto harmonics, focused on the definition of musical entities in\nmathematical terms. Early contributors to this approach were Philolaus\nof Croton (c. 470\u2013c. 385 BCE) and especially Archytas of\nTarentum, a contemporary of Plato (Huffman 1993, 2005).\n\nA mathematical treatment of harmonics informed by Pythagorean\nprinciples is also given in the Sectio Canonis, a treatise of\ndebated authorship, but often attributed to Euclid. Nicomachus (fl. c.\n100 CE) wrote an influential introduction to harmonics from the\nPythagorean standpoint (source texts with commentary are collected in\nBarker 1990; Barker 2007 reconstructs the development of Pythagorean\nharmonics.)\n\nParallel to the Pythagorean tradition, an alternative approach sought\nto ground the laws of music in the way it appears to a competent\nlistener, rather than in explanations from other domains of knowledge.\nThis tradition attempted to provide descriptions of music in\nautonomously musical terms, and valued accordance with musical\npractice. This empirical approach to harmonics is in contrast\nto the mathematical approach adopted by the Pythagorean\nschool (on the differences between the two schools, see Barker 2007\nand Barker 1990: 3\u20138). The contrast between these two schools is\nof philosophical interest, insofar as it concerns the appropriate\nlevel of explanation for aesthetic phenomena. Additionally,\nmathematical harmonics often were taken to support the metaphysical\nworldview associated with the Pythagorean doctrine, whereas empirical\nharmonics tended to follow from an Aristotelian framework (see Barker\n2007: chapter 4; Mathiesen 1999: 303).\n\nBy far the most important figure in the empirical tradition is that of\nAristoxenus (see\n \u00a71.4),\n although he relied on the work of previous theorists (Barker 2007:\nchapter 2). The mathematical and empirical traditions are often\nreferred to as Pythagorean and Aristoxenian, respectively.\n\nTheophrastus (c. 371\u2013287 BCE), who followed Aristotle as the\nhead of the Lyceum, is critical of the Pythagorean approach. He\nobserves that we may find quantitative regularities in things other\nthan musical intervals, yet we still consider these things as\ndifferent from musical entities. This, he argues, must be due to the\nfact that intervals and melodies are essentially something other than\nnumbers (Barker 1990: 111\u2013114; Lippman 1964: 157\u2013160;\nBarker 2007: chapter 15).\n\nIt is important to stress that the contrast between empirical and\nmathematical approaches was already evident to ancient theorists and\ncommentators, who often passionately took sides. Ptolemais of Cyrene\n(fl. between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE), the only\nknown Greek woman music theorist, distinguishes between\nmousikoi and kanonikoi, a distinction that matches\nthe one between Aristoxenians and Pythagoreans (Barker 2014: 185).\n\nSome theorists developed hybrid views. Ptolemy (c. 100\u2014c. 170\nCE) is a case in point, as he explicitly faults both Pythagorean and\nAristoxenian approaches (Harmonics, book I, 2). His\nphilosophical outlook is clearly Pythagorean. For instance, he defends\nat length the notion of cosmic harmony, tracing parallels between\nmusical and cosmological entities (Harmonics, book III, 9).\nHowever, he attempts to develop mathematical constructs that are\nbetter adherent to musical practice than the ones proposed by\nPythagoreans, thus addressing a concern characteristic of the\nAristoxenian approach.\n\nAristides Quintilianus (3rd\u20134th century CE), an author known\nuniquely for his treatise De Musica, also attempts a fusion\nof Aristoxenian and Pythagorean elements. While his view of harmonics\nis indebted to Aristoxenus, his philosophy of music bears a strong\nPythagorean influence. Book III of his De Musica illustrates\nparallels between musical elements and the most disparate parts of\nreality, from the senses, to virtues, all the way to celestial bodies.\nAristides Quintilianus defends the ethical value of music, and in\ndoing so he explicitly refers to Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nviews on the issue. He argues that music imitates moral actions in a\nway that is superior to that of the other arts, because it achieves\nmimesis in more than one way, that is, through words and\nmelodic movement (De Musica, book II, chapter 4). Aristides\nQuintilianus also classifies musical elements, from modes to\ninstruments, as masculine, feminine, or a mixture of the two (modes\nare scales that divide up the octave in different sequences of tones\nand semitones; though the names of Greek modes are identical to the\nlater Church modes, they name different scales). This classification\nis supposed to help in determining the ethos of musical pieces and\ninstruments, feminine elements being associated with smoothness, and\nmasculine ones with roughness (De Musica, book II, chapter\n12).\n1.3 Music, Emotions, and Society: Plato and Aristotle\n\nA central concern in ancient Greek philosophy of music is the\nconnection between music\u2019s capacity to imitate emotions and its\nsocial value. Plato (427/28\u2013347 BCE) and Aristotle\n(384\u2013322 BCE) both develop an account of this relation, and are\nparticularly interested in the pedagogical consequences of their\ntheories.\n\nWhen they talk about \u2018music\u2019 (mousik\u0113),\nPlato and his contemporaries often have in mind a broader set of art\nforms than the ones we associate with music today. In this broad\nsense, mousik\u0113 denoted \u201ca seamless complex of\ninstrumental music, poetic word, and co-ordinated physical\nmovement\u201d (Murray & Wilson 2004: 7). Plato sometimes also\nuses the term in a narrower sense to indicate melodic and rhythmic\nelements that we would consider today as properly musical (for a brief\ndiscussion of the broad and narrow sense of mousik\u0113 in\nPlato, see Schofield 2010: 230\u2013231).\n\nPlato believes that music may contribute to the education of the\nyouth, and more generally to the correct functioning of society, but\nalso holds that it may pose dangers. Underlying Plato\u2019s concerns\nabout the musical education of citizens is the wider assumption that\nchanges in musical taste must be avoided or at least closely\nscrutinized, as they will produce changes in society\n(Republic, 4.424b\u2013d, Laws 2.660a-b). In the\nLaws, Plato goes so far as to describe the changes in musical\ntaste that followed the Persian wars as the trigger for subsequent\nrejection of authority and societal unrest (Laws,\n700a-701b).\n\nAccording to Plato, the sensible world is an imperfect copy of perfect\nand immutable ideas. Plato\u2019s general view of the arts, including\nmusic, is that they are an imitation (mimesis) of objects\nfound in the sensible world. This leads to his famous condemnation of\nart in Book X of his Republic. For, if our world is already a\ncopy, then the arts provide us with copies of a copy. Thus,\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics motivates his dismissive view of art\u2019s\nepistemic value.\n\nHowever, Plato also holds that the musical imitation of some human\nemotions may be ethically beneficial, especially at the stage when\nchildren are too young to be responsive to ethical education that\nrelies on a discursive and rational basis. Plato first describes the\nemotions in question indirectly, one as the emotion of a person who is\nsteadfast and resolute in misfortune or while fighting, the other as\nthe state of \u201csomeone engaged in a peaceful, unforced, voluntary\naction\u201d (Republic, 3.399b). Plato holds that these\nemotions, which he then refers to explicitly as courage and\nmoderation, are best imitated through the Dorian and Phrygian modes,\nwhich\n\n\nimitate the violent or voluntary tones of voice of those who are\nmoderate and courageous, whether in good fortune or in bad.\n(Republic, 3.399c)\n\n\nThus, Plato construes musical imitation of emotions as grounded on the\nresemblance of music to human expressive behavior, particularly vocal.\nAt least on one occasion, he also seems to hold that music imitates\nthe bodily movements associated with emotions (Laws,\n2.654e-655a). This could be considered the first defense of the idea\nthat musical expressiveness is due to the music\u2019s resemblance to\nhuman expressive behavior, a position that remains popular to this day\n(see the entry on \nhref=\"../hist-westphilmusicsince-1800/#AnalPhilMusi\" history of\nwestern philosophy of music: since 1800, section 2.6).\n\nHow does the musical imitation of courage and moderation achieve its\neducational purpose? At least some passages suggest that Plato thought\nmusic to be capable of influencing human character in virtue of the\ncommon harmonic nature shared by the soul, music, and the universe.\nFor instance, in the Republic, Socrates tells Glaucon\nthat\n\n\nrhythm and harmony permeate the inner part of the soul more than\nanything else, affecting it most strongly and bringing it grace, so\nthat if someone is properly educated in music and poetry, it makes him\ngraceful, but if not, then the opposite. (Republic, 3.401d;\nsee also Republic, 3.412a, Timaeus, 47d-e, and\nLaches, 188d)\n\n\nYoung (forthcoming) observes that Plato seems elsewhere to reject the\nPythagorean view of the soul as harmony (Phaedo,\n89\u201395). On this basis, Young holds that Plato\u2019s view of\nthe ethical benefits of music is best interpreted as simply relying on\nthe music\u2019s imitative capacity. Regardless of what one makes of\nPlato\u2019s view of the soul as harmony, it is clear that he was\ninfluenced by the Pythagorean view of the universe as governed by\nharmony, especially in the Timaeus.\n\nOn the surface, Aristotle\u2019s view may appear close to\nPlato\u2019s. Both philosophers hold music\u2019s value to reside in\nits imitation of emotions. However, Aristotle\u2019s view is\nconsiderably more nuanced.\n\nIn the Poetics (1447a), Aristotle makes clear that all the\narts are imitative, although they differ in the means, object, and\nmanner of imitation. Aristotle has a more positive view of imitation\nthan Plato, observing that humans are prone to it since childhood, and\ngranting that we may learn through imitation. This cognitive value of\nimitations also explains why we feel pleasure when engaging with them,\neven when they imitate things we would find ugly or repulsive in real\nlife (Poetics, 1448b 5\u201320).\n\nDiscussing the object of musical imitations, Aristotle introduces an\ninteresting distinction between mere indications or signs\n(s\u0113meia) of emotional states and the states themselves.\nSigns of emotional states are the observable behavior that accompanies\nthe occurrence of such states. Aristotle holds that the visual arts\nmerely imitate signs of emotions. For instance, a painter may\nrepresent a man weeping or smiling. However, music is able to imitate\nthe emotional states themselves. A plausible reading of\nAristotle\u2019s view is that he regarded music as capable of\narousing the emotions it imitates, and that this capacity ultimately\nexplains how music may imitate emotional states themselves, as opposed\nto their manifestations. On this analysis, the object of musical\nimitation cannot be specified separately from the emotional response\nthe music arouses in the listener (Halliwell (2002: 248) stresses this\npoint; S\u00f6rbom 1994 offers an alternative interpretation).\n\nTo understand the relation between Aristotle\u2019s view of musical\nimitation and its educational role, it is useful to examine this\npassage:\n\n\nBesides, when men hear imitations, even apart from the rhythms and\ntunes themselves, their feelings move in sympathy. Since then music is\na pleasure, and excellence consists in rejoicing and loving and hating\nrightly, there is clearly nothing which we are so much concerned to\nacquire and to cultivate as the power of forming right judgments, and\nof taking delight in good dispositions and noble actions.\n(Politics, 1340a)\n\n\nHere Aristotle seems to be arguing the following: music imitates\ncharacter, that is, various dispositions and emotional states; the\nmusical imitation of such states generates pleasure in the listener;\nso, if we restrict musical imitations to those of morally praiseworthy\nstates, listeners will be pleased at such states in real life.\nAristotle is relying on the assumption that the pleasure accompanying\nour engagement with an imitation will extend to the experience of the\nimitated object in real life. As he expresses it:\n\n\nThe habit of feeling pleasure or pain at mere representations is not\nfar removed from the same feeling about realities. (Politics,\n1340a)\n\n\nTherefore, the moral value of musical education depends on the\ncapacity of mimetic representations to induce pleasure in those who\nappreciate them. While this capacity may be shared by both music and\nthe visual arts, it is only music, according to Aristotle, that is\nable represent states of character, as opposed to merely representing\ntheir manifestations.\n\nAn additional function of music, according to Aristotle, is catharsis.\nMusic may help individuals who are in states of extreme enthusiasm,\npity, or fear return to a more balanced state (Politics,\n1342a). The details of this process are hard to reconstruct, because\nthey are tied to the debated concept of catharsis, introduced by\nAristotle in his definition of tragedy (Poetics, 1449b). It\nseems clear that Aristotle thought of the cathartic process as\nrequiring music expressive of emotions akin to the ones to be purged.\nFor example, a state of uncontrolled religious frenzy could be subdued\nby means of frenzied music.\n\nPlato and Aristotle come apart also with regard to the role of the\npleasure we take in listening to music. Plato\u2019s approach is a\npragmatic one. The aspects of music he values are all and only those\nthat contribute to its ethical role. Such a principle governs\nPlato\u2019s observations on musical pleasure. He does not deny that\nmusic may be able to induce pleasure. However, this pleasure is only\nvaluable insofar as it attracts listeners to music that is good for\ntheir moral education (Laws, 2.668a-b).\n\nPlato also notes that pleasurable responses may become associated with\nmusic of the morally questionable sort, as such responses depend also\non habituation (Laws, 7.802c-d). From this he concludes that\nit is of great importance to control children\u2019s musical\nenvironment.\n\nAristotle\u2019s view of musical pleasure is far more positive. It is\nclear from the above that pleasure plays a role in Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of music\u2019s educational value. But Aristotle also thinks\nthat pleasure generated by music is valuable for two other reasons.\nFirst, music may provide relaxation to those that are tired from work.\nIn this sense, the pleasure it produces is similar to that produced by\neating or sleeping (Politics, 1339a-b). Second, and perhaps\nmore interestingly, Aristotle holds that the pleasure of music should\nbe part of a cultivated life (Politics, 1339b; for a\ndiscussion of the functions of music in Aristotle, see Lippman 1964:\n130\u2013131.)\n\nBoth Plato and Aristotle comment on the value of instrumental music.\nPlato\u2019s pragmatic attitude grounds his injunction against\ncomplexity and subtlety in music (Republic, 3.399c-e). He\nholds that music should have a vocal part, and argues that the musical\nelements should conform to the emotional state described by the\npiece\u2019s lyrical content (Republic, 3.400d). This\nconcern with clear and unequivocal musical imitation also motivates\nPlato\u2019s stance on the value of instrumental music. While it is\nclear that Plato holds the purely musical elements of melody and\nrhythm to have an imitative potential, he attributes little value to\ninstrumental music, presumably because he believes that it is unable\nto provide an unequivocal imitation of courage and moderation\n(Laws 2.669 d-e).\n\nAristotle is again more nuanced. According to him, both vocal and\ninstrumental music produce pleasure (Politics, 1339b). In\ngeneral, despite his reservations concerning the aulos (an\ninstrument comprising two, linked, reed pipes) (Politics,\n1341a), Aristotle\u2019s attitude toward instrumental music is far\nless critical than Plato\u2019s. For example, Aristotle is clear in\nconceding that even purely instrumental music can arouse distinct\nemotions, due to both its melodic and rhythmic elements\n(Politics, 1340a-b).\n1.4 Aristotelian Empirical Harmonics: Aristoxenus\n\nA disciple of Aristotle, Aristoxenus (fl. 4th century BCE) argues that\nharmonics should not be concerned with an explanation of musical\nphenomena in mathematical terms, but rather describe musical\nstructures through the analysis of musical elements as objects of\nperception. For example, Aristoxenus distinguishes between the\nspeaking and singing voice, the former being characterized by a\ncontinuous movement across pitch space, the latter by intervallic\nmovement from one pitch to another (Elementa Harmonica, book\nI, 9\u201310). On the basis of this distinction, he provides a\ndefinition of note (phthongos) as any pitch on which the\nvoice rests and that has a position in a given melodic line\n(Elementa Harmonica, book I, 9\u201310; for a detailed\ndiscussion of Aristoxenus as a music theorist, see Mathiesen 1999:\n294\u2013344).\n\nAnother striking element in Aristoxenus\u2019 conception is his view\nof musical understanding, which he thinks involves the faculties of\nperception and memory,\n\n\nfor we have to perceive what is coming to be and remember what has\ncome to be. There is no other way of following the contents of music.\n(Elementa Harmonica, book II, 38\u201339)\n\n\nNote that perception is not described as the mere awareness of what is\npresent to our senses at a given time, but includes an anticipation of\n\u201cwhat is coming to be\u201d. Here, Aristoxenus seems to\nanticipate an account of musical understanding similar to the one\nrecently defended by Jerrold Levinson (1997).\n\nAristoxenus\u2019 view of the moral effects of music is harder to\nreconstruct. While it is clear that he thought music to be a proper\nobject of ethical evaluation, he likely had a less dogmatic conception\nof the link between given modes and their moral value than Aristotle\n(see Rocconi 2012 and Barker 2007: 245 ff.).\n1.5 Music and Moral Education: Skeptical Views\n\nSome ancient philosophers reject the view that music is valuable\nbeyond the pleasurable experience it affords. In doing so, they\nquestion the educational value of music.\n\nIn his De Musica, the epicurean Philodemus (c. 110\u2013c.\n30 BCE) rejects the widespread view that music may imitate the\npassions, claiming that music is no better able to represent\npsychological states than the art of cooking (see Wilkinson 1938).\nPhilodemus appeals to Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BCE), but\nevidence regarding the latter\u2019s views is scant. While it is\nclear that Democritus held music to stand lower than other arts in\nterms of utility, it is probably not true that he thought this\ndeprived it of educational value (see Brancacci 2007:\n193\u201395).\n\nSextus Empiricus (fl. 3rd century CE), in Against the\nMusicians, also denies that music could have any positive\neducational role. While he concedes that we may enjoy music, he denies\nthat the study of music could contribute to such enjoyment. In support\nof this, he also compares music to cookery, arguing that in both cases\nenjoyment is independent of our understanding of the thing enjoyed\n(Against the Musicians, 24\u201325).\n2. Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages\n\nDespite spanning about one thousand years, the period that goes from\nlate Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages brought little new to\nWestern philosophy of music.\n\nA prominent feature of this period is the emergence of the Christian\nworldview. Christian thinking on music adapts some of the views it had\ninherited from Greek Antiquity, chief among them the Pythagorean\nharmony of the spheres and the idea that music may influence\ncharacter.\n\nThe medieval approach to music is biased toward the point of view of\nthe theoretician. Music is typically grouped together with scientific\ndisciplines. The sensory pleasure of the listener is rarely remarked\nupon, and at times considered with suspicion. The individuality and\ncreativity of the composer is also neglected, and the role of\nperforming musicians almost entirely ignored or dismissed (Schuller\n1988, and Young forthcoming (chapter 2) are extensive introductions to\nmedieval musical aesthetics).\n2.1 Early Christian Views of Music: Augustine and Boethius\n\nSaint Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430), philosopher and Father of\nthe Church, devoted to music his treatise De Musica. Although\nmostly technical in character, the book is an early statement of the\nmedieval view of music as first and foremost a science, rather than a\npractical occupation. Augustine defines music as \u201cthe science of\nmensurating well\u201d (scientia bene modulandi\u2014this\nlast word is at times rendered as \u2018modulation\u2019), that is,\nthe discipline concerned with the attainment of measure and proportion\n(De Musica, book I, 2).\n\nAn almost identical definition of music is found in Cassiodorus\n(485\u2013c. 585) who states that \u201cMusic indeed is the\nknowledge of apt modulation\u201d (Institutiones, 5), as\nwell as in Isidore of Seville\u2019s (560\u2013636)\nEtymologiarum:\n\n\nMusic is an art of modulation consisting of tone and song called music\nby derivation from the Muses. (Etymologiarum, book III,\n15)\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s attitude toward the sensory pleasure derived from\nmusic was conflicted. On the one hand, he recognizes music\u2019s\npower in worship. On the other hand, he is aware that this could also\nlead the faithful to stray away from the religious content of the\nexperience (Confessions, II).\n\nThe philosopher Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (c.\n480\u2013525/26), normally referred to simply as Boethius, had a\nfundamental role in shaping medieval musical thinking. Through\ncommentated translations of Greek authors and original expositions of\ntheir views, Boethius allowed classical Greek philosophical ideas to\nsurvive into the Middle Ages. He did so in the field of music by\nwriting De Institutione Musica. In this work, Boethius\nsummarizes music theory as found in the Greek treatises he knew. The\nbook also distinguishes between three types of music: musica\nmundana, humana, and instrumentalis. Musica\nmundana is the harmony of the cosmos, a Pythagorean concept that\nfound widespread acceptance over the course of the Middle Ages, though\nit was recast in Christian terms. Musica humana is described\nonly briefly by Boethius, though it is clear that it is the harmony\nbetween the various elements that compose the human body. Some modern\naccounts of Boethius\u2019s thought identify musica humana\nwith singing, but this is incorrect, though it is true that later\nmedieval thinkers used the term in such a way (see Dyer 2007: 59; 64;\n69). Finally, musica instrumentalis is sounding music, vocal\nand instrumental. While this is undoubtedly regarded today as the core\nof music, Boethius considers it as music only in a derivative sense.\nBoethius\u2019s tripartite division is repeated and accepted by\nnumerous medieval writers on music.\n\nBoethius also takes from Greek Antiquity the Platonic view that music\nmay arouse emotions and influence human character. He observes that\nthis sets music apart from other mathematical disciplines (De\nInstitutione Musica, book I, 1).\n2.2 Christian Thought and Music\n\nThe impact of Christianity on medieval musical thinking is evident in\nthe religious interpretation given of two philosophical views from\nAntiquity, the harmony of the spheres and the ethos theory, according\nto which music may shape the listener\u2019s character. Both of these\nideas were held by Boethius (see the preceding section) and found\nwidespread acceptance among medieval writers.\n\nThe Christian take on the harmony of the spheres consists in the claim\nthat such harmony was imposed on the universe by the Creator. The\nbeauty of music, including sounding music, is thus traced back to\nmusic\u2019s partaking in that divine harmony. John Scottus Eriugena\n(c. 800\u2013c. 877) expresses such a view in his\nPeriphyseon, as evident from his very definition of\nmusic:\n\n\nMusic is the art which by the light of reason studies the harmony of\nall things that are in motion that is knowable by natural proportions.\n(Periphyseon, 475B)\n\n\nThat the harmony of the spheres could be interpreted in Christian\nterms did not prevent philosophers from rejecting it, especially once\nAristotle\u2019s works had become available. Albert the Great\n(Albertus Magnus) (c. 1200\u20131280) is an example of a prominent\nphilosopher who rejects the idea of a celestial harmony. Appealing to\narguments based on the structure of the cosmos, he discards the idea\nthat the movement of celestial bodies could produce harmonious sounds\n(Liber de Causis Proprietatum Elementorum, book II, 2.1; on\nthe harmony of the spheres in the thirteenth century, see Mews\n2011).\n\nThe idea that music may influence character was widely accepted over\nthe course of the Middle Ages. It was supported by the exaggerated\naccounts of music\u2019s powers that had survived from Antiquity. The\nmedieval Christian version of the ethos theory normally stresses the\ndevotional potential of music.\n2.3 Music among the Liberal Arts\n\nFollowing Martianus Capella\u2019s (fl. c. 410) The Marriage of\nPhilology and Mercury, medieval thinkers classified music as one\nof the liberal arts. These were divided into the arts of the\ntrivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and the\nquadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music). The\narts of the trivium were referred to as artes\nsermocinales, because they are related to discourse and language.\nThe arts of the quadrivium were instead the artes\nreales, studying the mathematical and physical constitution of\nthe universe. The classification of music as one of the artes\nreales is unsurprising in light of the Pythagorean-Boethian view\nof music as primarily concerned with proportions and harmony.\n\nWhile this classification remained mostly unchallenged, there were\nsome important dissenting voices (for an overview, see Dyer 2007).\nThese disputes regarding the proper classification of music are\nimportant because they reflect underlying concerns with music\u2019s\nnature and purposes. From the thirteenth century onwards, theorists\nand philosophers became more concerned with the practical and acoustic\nsides of music-making, and less with its theological implications. For\ninstance, the English grammarian John of Garland (1195\u20131272)\ndistinguishes between plainsong, mensural music, and instrumental\nmusic, and does so on the bases of historical and musicological\ndifferences between such repertoires (see Fubini 1991: 94).\n\nThe progressive assimilation of Aristotle\u2019s work in medieval\nthought meant that the physical, sounding aspects of music began to be\nconsidered as important as its mathematical ones. Evidence of this is\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s classification of music as one of the\nscientie medie, that is, disciplines that apply mathematics\nto the study of natural objects (see Dyer 2007: 67\u201368).\n2.4 Islamic Philosophy of Music: Al-Kindi, al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina\n\nAs observed by Young (forthcoming: chapter 2), it is appropriate to\ninclude medieval Islamic philosophy in a survey of Western musical\nthinking, as Islamic philosophers relied largely on the same Greek\nauthors that were central to the European tradition. In fact,\ntranslations of Greek works were more widely available in the Islamic\nworld. Partly because of their earlier contact with Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy, Islamic philosophers are more inclined to value the\nsensory character of music and to accept it as an object of aesthetic\nappreciation.\n\nThe philosopher al-Kindi (c. 800\u2013870) holds a broadly\nPythagorean view of music (see Shehadi 1995: chapter 1, and Adamson\n2007: 172\u2013180). According to him, a relationship of affinity\nholds between musical elements and parts of the cosmos. This affinity\nallows Kindi to trace correspondences between musical elements and the\nextra-musical world. Kindi\u2019s acceptance of Pythagorean views is\nalso exemplified by his claim that music exercises a power of the\nhuman body in virtue of the affinity between its constitution and that\nof various musical instruments.\n\nAl-Farabi (872\u2013950) is a notable representative of the\nAristotelian current in medieval Islamic philosophy of music (see\nShehadi 1995: chapter 3). Farabi rejects the harmony of the spheres.\nRather than speculating about music\u2019s origin in the structure of\nthe cosmos, he attempts to understand it as a human phenomenon,\nsuggesting that vocal music may have developed out of necessities such\nas the expression of pleasant and unpleasant states. Farabi also\ndistinguishes three types of melody, according to the effect it\nproduces in the listener. Some melodies are pleasing to the ear,\nothers evoke images, and yet others express psychological states. It\nis possible for a melody to do more than one of these things, and in\nfact Farabi holds that the best melodies tend to have all three such\neffects.\n\nIbn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna (980\u20131037) describes\nmusic as a mathematical science, but argues that a theory of music\nshould be primarily concerned with the explanation of music as heard.\nThis emphasis on the appropriate level of explanation is reminiscent\nof Aristoxenus (see\n \u00a71.4),\n who exercised a clear influence on Islamic philosophy of music. Ibn\nSina also revives the Aristotelian view that music may imitate human\ncharacter and psychological states (on Ibn Sina\u2019s philosophy of\nmusic, see Shehadi 1995: chapter 4).\n3. Early Modern Period\n3.1 Music and Sensory Pleasure: Tinctoris and Zarlino\n\nFrom the fifteenth century, writers on music begin to elaborate on the\naesthetic aspects of musical experience. The theorist and composer\nJohannes Tinctoris (c. 1435\u20131511) exemplifies various aspects of\nthis new outlook on music. He defines harmony and consonance in terms\nof their appearance to the listener, rather than through mathematical\nnotions. Harmony is thus described as the pleasing effect produced by\nsounds, whereas consonance and dissonance are respectively\ncharacterized as combinations of sounds that bring sweetness to the\near or hurt it (Liber de arte contrapuncti, chapter 2). In\nhis Complexus effectuum musices, Tinctoris lists prominent\neffects of music, most of which involve emotional arousal, while the\ndedication of his Proportionale Musices refers back to\nAntiquity and the alleged emotional potency of its music.\n\nTinctoris thus prefigures two tendencies typical of early modern\nthinking about music: first, the focus on the subjective experience of\nmusic, and on the feelings of pleasure and displeasure that accompany\nit; second, the value attributed to music\u2019s expressive power,\nand the related idea that ancient music\u2019s capacity to arouse\nemotions was greater than that of the music of their time.\n\nThe first of these tendencies is also embodied in the work of Gioseffo\nZarlino (1517\u20131590). A towering figure in Western music theory,\nZarlino is normally considered as the theorist who initiated the move\naway from medieval modality and toward tonal harmony. According to\nZarlino, rules of composition are good insofar as they produce\nbeautiful music, whose purpose is to \u201cimprove\u201d and\n\u201cdelight\u201d (Zarlino 1558: book III, 71). However, Zarlino\ndoes not reject the role of rationality, and especially of\nmathematics, because its laws ultimately underlie the senses of sight\nand hearing (Zarlino 1588: 34\u201336).\n3.2 Melody and Expression: The Florentine Camerata\n\nIn Book II of his Dodecachordon (1547), the humanist Heinrich\nGlarean (also known as Glareanus) (1488\u20131563) argues that\ncomposers of polyphonic music are inferior to those who set a single\nmelodic line to a text. He speculates that the latter was the way\nGreeks, Romans, and early Christian communities composed music. Monody\nis superior on the grounds that it requires an exercise in invention,\nwhereas the polyphonist merely borrows a melodic line and then carries\nout a task that is predominantly intellectual. According to Glareanus,\nmonody has a natural character and an expressive immediacy that is\nlost in subsequent development. Less than half a century later, both\nthe reference to a classical model and the vindication of monody\nbecame crucially important in Italian musical thinking and practice.\nToward the end of the sixteenth century, a group of Florentine\nintellectuals and musicians gathered around the figure of Giovanni\nde\u2019 Bardi, a nobleman and amateur musician. This group is\nnormally referred to as the Florentine Camerata, or Camerata de\u2019\nBardi. Its goal was to recover the expressive potential of music, as\ndescribed in ancient Greek and Roman sources. Music\u2019s power to\narouse emotions was thought to have been lost during the Middle Ages,\nas polyphony developed. The envisaged solution was a return to monody,\nand more precisely to a melodic line that would follow and emphasize\nthe prosodic features of impassioned speech (Palisca 2006: chapter 7;\nPalisca 1989 is an influential collection of source readings). Thus,\nthe main goal of the Camerata seems to have been expression, to be\nintended here as the arousal of emotion, while the imitation of speech\nprosody was considered a means to that end. This is philosophically\nsignificant in that it indicates a revival of the classical Greek idea\nthat music is expressive in virtue of its resemblance to the way human\nbeings express their emotions (see\n \u00a71.3).\n\nThis resulted in the birth of the so-called stile\nrappresentativo, the vocal style characteristic of early opera,\nof which Claudio Monteverdi\u2019s (1567\u20131643)\nL\u2019Orfeo (1607) is considered the first masterpiece.\nGiulio Caccini (1550\u20131618) and Jacopo Peri (1561\u20131633)\nwere active members of the Camerata, and have both left explicit\ndiscussion of the theories that informed their musical style (relevant\ntextual excerpts are collected in Strunk 1950: 370\u2013392).\n\nWhile Monteverdi may be considered the most representative musician\nassociated with this turn to melody and expression, the\nCamerata\u2019s most significant theoretical figure was Vincenzo\nGalilei (c. 1520\u20131591), an accomplished composer and lutenist,\nfather of the astronomer Galileo. In his Dialogue of Ancient and\nModern Music (1581), Galilei takes issue with contemporary\npractices, particularly with counterpoint. He concedes that the\npolyphonic music of his time is a source of aural pleasure, but faults\nit for its incapacity to move the listener,\n\n\n[f]or its sole aim is to delight the ear, while that of ancient music\nis to induce in another the same passion that one feels oneself.\n(Galilei 1581 [1950: 317])\n\n\nBoth Monteverdi and Galilei faced the reaction of more conservative\nfigures. Giovanni Maria Artusi (c. 1540\u20131613), in\nL\u2019Artusi or Of the Imperfections of Modern Music\n(1600), attacks the work of an unnamed composer, though it is apparent\nthat he has in mind composers such as Monteverdi and Carlo Gesualdo\n(1566\u20131613). Artusi concedes that the newly developed monodic\nstyle is expressive, but denies that expression is worth the sacrifice\nof compositional rules that are dictated by reason. The dispute\nbetween Artusi and Monteverdi crystallized the clash between the\nso-called prima and seconda prattica, the former\nindicating the old polyphonic style, the latter the new preference for\naccompanied monody.\n\nGalilei faced criticism from his former teacher Zarlino. In his\nSopplimenti musicali (1588), Zarlino argues that the\nimitation of impassioned speech belongs to the art of rhetoric or to\ndeclaimed poetry, not music. Musicians should confine themselves to\nthe imitation of the text\u2019s content, rather than to its possible\ndelivery, and they should do so through the choice of appropriate\nharmonies (Zarlino 1588: 316\u2013318). Zarlino\u2019s reservations\nabout expressive melody are of particular importance, as they may be\nseen as the first manifestation of a recurring contrast between two\nopposite tendencies, epitomized by the clash between Rousseau and\nRameau (see\n \u00a73.5).\n Whereas one strand locates music\u2019s chief source of expression\nin melody, the other defends the primacy of harmony, often downplaying\nthe role of possible resemblances between melodic contour and human\nexpressive behavior (Young, forthcoming, names the two tendencies\nempiricism and rationalism, respectively, following\ntheir development and occasional overlap).\n\nDespite their disagreements, both approaches valued expression in\nmusic set to a text. A full vindication of the expressive power of\ninstrumental music was not among the programmatic goals of either the\nCamerata or of those who, like Zarlino, stress the importance of\nharmonic elements. Caccini is critical of music that obscures the\ntext, because\n\n\nsuch music and musicians gave no other delight than what harmony could\ngive the ear, for, unless the words were understood, they could not\nmove the understanding. (Caccini 1600 [1950: 378])\n\n\nZarlino, following Plato, claims that melody and harmony should be\nsuitable to the text, and cashes out this suitability in terms of\nsimilarity:\n\n\nwe must also make a choice of a harmony and a rhythm similar to the\nnature of the matters contained in the speech in order that from the\ncombination of these things, put together with proportion, may result\na melody suited to the purpose. (Zarlino 1558: book IV, 32 [1950:\n256])\n\n\nMoreover, these authors unanimously hold that it is the music that has\nto be adapted to a text, rather than the other way around. In the\nforeword to Monteverdi\u2019s Scherzi Musicali (1607), his\nbrother Giulio Cesare claims that Claudio\u2019s goal was \u201cto\nmake the words the mistress of the harmony and not the servant\u201d\n(Monteverdi 1607 [1950: 406]).\n\nWhile this stress on the priority of the text was the product of a\nrenewed interest in emotional expression in vocal music, Church\nauthorities also became concerned with the confused polyphonic styles\nand the way they obfuscated liturgical content, and thus they also\npromoted textural clarity in polyphonic music (see Fellerer 1953).\n3.3 Sense and Rationality: Mersenne, Descartes, Leibniz\n\nWhile it is important to note that the early modern period mitigated\nthe medieval insistence on a mathematical treatment of music with an\napproach that paid greater attention to its sensory appearance, it\nwould be incorrect to say that the search for mathematical\nregularities was altogether abandoned. On the one hand, the budding\nscientific outlook favored the extension of the experimental method to\nthe realm of sound, an operation that obviously included mathematical\nmodeling. Thus, rather than giving up on mathematical descriptions of\nmusic altogether, early modern theorists abandoned the abstract\nframework in which these descriptions had been formulated. On the\nother hand, accounts of music in mathematical terms continued to\nsurvive in the metaphysical speculations of music theorists and\nphilosophers.\n\nExemplary of these tendencies is the French mathematician Marin\nMersenne (1588\u20131648), who was interested in a number of\nquestions connected to the mathematical nature of music. While he\nunderstood the importance of empirical verification, Mersenne was also\nconvinced of a fundamental harmony between the mathematical order of\nmusic and that of the whole cosmos, as evident from the title of his\nmost important work, Harmonie Universelle (1636).\n\nA particularly interesting theme in this sprawling treatise is the\ncontrast between the rational structure of music and its sensuous\nappearance, best illustrated through Mersenne\u2019s discussion of\nconsonance. Having defined consonance in terms of coincidence in air\nvibrations, Mersenne had to explain why consonance and sensory\nagreeableness do not always go hand in hand. For instance, the major\nthird is more agreeable than the fourth, although this is more\nconsonant. Mersenne had an interesting correspondence with Descartes\non the matter, in which the former manifests his wish to provide a\ndefinition of agreeableness that is as objective as that of\nconsonance, while the latter expresses skepticism about the project,\nand claims that agreeableness is dependent on variation in taste, as\nwell as in musical context (see Jorgensen 2012).\n\nEarly in his life, Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) devoted a\ntreatise to music, the Compendium Musicae (written in 1618\nand published posthumously in 1650). This work is dominated by\nscientific concerns rather than philosophical ones, but the very start\nof the treatise is characteristic of its age, as Descartes states that\nmusic\u2019s goal is \u201cto please and to arouse various\nAffections in us\u201d (Descartes 1650). But Descartes\u2019s most\nimportant impact on philosophy of music is actually due to his\ntreatise on emotions, The Passions of the Soul (1649). In\nthis work, Descartes defines emotions as the result of the action\nproduced by external objects on the animal spirits, a thin air-like\nsubstance that stirs our passions whenever it is set in motion.\nDescartes also distinguishes six basic emotions: wonder, love, hatred,\ndesire, joy, and sadness.\n\nThis taxonomy of emotions and the mechanistic description of their\nfunctioning will prove important to the so-called\nAffektenlehre, or doctrine of the affections, the eighteenth\ncentury view that a piece of music should arouse a specific emotion in\nthe listener. Affektenlehre theorists believed that this goal\ncould be achieved through the use of specific musical devices, each\nassociated with a given emotion. The German composer Johann Mattheson\nmay be considered the most prominent representative of this tradition.\nHe explicitly endorses Descartes\u2019 theory of emotions in his\ntreatise Der vollkommene Capellmeister (Mattheson 1739: I,\niii, \u00a751).\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), philosopher and\nmathematician, devoted to music only scattered observations. Yet, his\nview of music\u2019s value is of particular interest, as it is\nindicative of the attempt to reconcile rational and sensuous elements\nin our appreciation of music (see Fubini 1991: 149). Leibniz accepts\nthat the main goal of music is to move us. In fact, he notes that,\nwhile music is obviously so apt to do so, \u201cthis main purpose is\nnot usually sufficiently noticed or sought after\u201d (Leibniz,\nOn Wisdom). However, Leibniz also specifies that this\nsensuous pleasure is the result of the automatic and unconscious\napprehension through music of the rational structure of the universe.\nHe writes:\n\n\nMusic charms us, although its beauty consists only in the agreement of\nnumbers and in the counting, which we do not perceive but which the\nsoul nevertheless continues to carry out, of the beats or vibrations\nof sounding bodies which coincide at certain intervals. (Leibniz 1714:\n614)\n\n3.4 Imitation and Expression in the Eighteenth Century\n\nTwo related questions may be asked with regard to imitation in music.\nThe first is whether music may imitate extra-musical objects, and what\nvalue this imitation may have. The second concerns the role of such\nimitation in the musical expression of emotions. Over the course of\nthe eighteenth century, answers to both questions were characterized\nby a growing skepticism toward imitation (see Lippman 1992: chapter\n6). The gradual rise of instrumental music was certainly partly\nresponsible for this change in attitude. Its increasing formal,\nmelodic, and harmonic complexity made it less plausible to argue that\nit imitated the speaking voice, and yet this complexity only\nheightened music\u2019s power to express and arouse the emotions.\n\nA natural way out of this impasse is to explicitly define expression\nin terms of emotional arousal, distinguishing it from the mere musical\ndepiction of worldly objects, including the external manifestations of\nhuman emotions. This is the option taken by Charles Avison\n(1709\u20131770) in his Essay on Musical Expression, first\npublished in 1752. Avison distinguishes between music resembling\nextra-musical objects, including manifestations of emotions, such as\nlaughter, and music that is able to provoke an emotional response in\nthe listener. The former case is musical \u2018imitation\u2019,\nwhich Avison claims produces \u201ca reflex act of the\nunderstanding\u201d (Avison 1775: 50), while the latter is\n\u2018expression\u2019. Avison argues that the goal of music is to\npursue expression, which is achieved by the competent use of melody\nand harmony. While the idea that music is valuable because it moves\nthe listener was not new, Avison\u2019s clarity in decoupling it from\nimitation is noteworthy.\n\nHowever, other theorists were not as explicit and careful as Avison\nwith their terminology, nor as ready to jettison imitation, which the\neighteenth century considered essential to the fine arts. Moreover, it\nhad been customary since the Camerata\u2019s time to construe\nexpression as dependent on imitation (see Palisca 2006: chapter 10).\nThus, a number of authors adopted conservative positions, defending a\nqualified concept of musical imitation, or simply accepting that\nmusic\u2019s imitative capacities are limited. In the second half of\nthe century, imitation gradually took on a more peripheral role, and\nphilosophers started to focus on alternative sources of value for\nmusic as an art, from formal structure to emotional arousal.\n\nThis gradual rejection of the idea of music as an imitative art is\nperhaps best manifested in France. This might seem puzzling, as the\neighteenth century view of imitation as the hallmark of fine arts\nfound its most famous expression in The Fine Arts Reduced to a\nSingle Principle (1746), by Charles Batteux (1713\u20131780). In\nthis work, Batteux defines art as the imitation of beautiful nature\n(belle nature). Different arts imitate different parts of\nnature. Music imitates the human expression of emotions. It is\ninteresting to note that Batteux repeatedly states that music\nexpresses the emotions, as opposed to imitating them,\nalthough the discrepancy seems to be merely terminological. Batteux\ncan conceive of music that fails to be imitative, but does not\nconsider it valuable:\n\n\nIt would be like a chromatic harpsichord that offers us colours and\nseries of colours. It would amuse the eyes, perhaps, but bore the\nmind. (Batteux 1746: part III, section III, chapter 2)\n\n\nEarlier than Batteux, Jean-Baptiste Du Bos (1670\u20131742) had\nsimilarly construed music as an imitative art in his Critical\nReflections on Poetry and Painting (1719). Du Bos attempts to\nshow that, in vocal music, melody, harmony, and rhythm all contribute\nto the imitation of impassioned speech. Instrumental music imitates\nnatural sounds instead. While he recognizes that music may charm the\nsenses, Du Bos thinks that the only valuable response to music is the\none that comes from its appreciation as an imitation. Music may still\nplease without imitating, but it is only when it imitates that it\nreally moves. Consequently, Du Bos condemns music that fails to be\nimitative.\n\nThe Encyclopedists Jean Le Rond D\u2019Alembert (1717\u20131783) and\nDidier Diderot (1713\u20131784) also hold onto the idea that music is\nessentially imitative. D\u2019Alembert states that\n\n\n[t]he composers of instrumental music will make nothing but an empty\nnoise as long as they do not have in their heads [\u2026] an action\nor an expression to be represented. (D\u2019Alembert 1759:\nXXXVIII)\n\n\nIn the dialogue Rameau\u2019s Nephew (1760), Diderot claims\nthat\n\n\n[s]ong is an imitation of physical noises or of the accents of the\npassions, through the sounds of a scale invented by art or inspired by\nnature, whichever you please, either with the voice or with an\ninstrument. (Diderot 1760: 104ndash;5)\n\n\nMusical imitation is also defended by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but in an\nimportantly qualified version (see the following section).\n\nFrom the 1770s onwards, the view of music as an imitative art appears\nincreasingly untenable, and the idea that music is expressive of the\nemotions because it imitates human expressive behavior also comes\nunder attack. This new trend is evident in works such as Andr\u00e9\nMorellet\u2019s (1727\u20131819) Of Expression in Music and\nImitation in the Arts (1771), as well as Musical Expression\nPlaced Among the Chimeras (1779). This latter work was written by\nBoy\u00e9, whose biographical details are unknown.\nBoy\u00e9\u2019s treatise pairs the rejection of imitation with the\nclaim that melody and harmony are worthy of appreciation in\nthemselves:\n\n\nThe principal object of music is to please us physically, without the\nmind putting itself to the trouble of searching for useless\ncomparisons to it. (quoted in Lippman 1992: 95)\n\n\nThe composer and theorist Michel-Paul Guy de Chabanon\n(1730\u20131792) is arguably the most representative and radical\nexample of the new skeptical mentality. In his Observations on\nMusic and Principally on the Metaphysics of Art (1779), Chabanon\noffers a variety of arguments against the idea that the musical\nexpression of emotions depends on the imitation of their vocal\nmanifestations. Children respond emotionally to music, he observes,\nyet they cannot appreciate musical imitation. The same is true of\nindividuals who are unfamiliar with the Western musical tradition.\nMoreover, imitation is insufficient for expression. For example,\nlaughter is naturally associated with gaiety, but a musical imitation\nof laughter would fail to result in gay music. Thus, music may express\nemotions without imitating their external manifestations. Conversely,\nChabanon observes that music may express emotions that do not have any\ntypical manifestation:\n\n\nMany of our passions have no particular cry associated with them, and\nyet music may express them. (Chabanon 1779: VIII)\n\n\nIn addition to the already mentioned Avison, other English writers\nquestioned the role of imitation in music (see Schueller 1948).\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694\u20131746), in An Inquiry concerning\nBeauty, Order, Harmony, Design (1725), distinguishes between\noriginal and comparative beauty, the former being judged independently\nof any comparison, with the latter depending instead on imitation.\nAccording to Hutcheson, music is an example of original beauty,\nalthough its melodic element also allows for comparative beauty, in\nthat it may resemble impassioned speech. In detecting this\nresemblance,\n\n\nwe shall be touched by it in a very sensible manner, and have\nmelancholy, joy, gravity, thoughtfulness excited in us by a sort of\nsympathy or contagion. (Hutcheson 1725: section VI,\nXII)\n\n\nThis passage is significant because it gives a clear account of how\nmusic may express an emotion (through the imitation of its\ncharacteristic vocal expression), while at the same time arousing it\nin the listener.\n\nIn his Observations on the Correspondence between Poetry and\nMusic (1769), the Irish writer Daniel Webb (1719\u20131798)\nexplains the emotional effects of music by appealing to a\nphysiological theory of emotions similar to Descartes\u2019s.\nAccording to this view, music may give us impressions, that\nis, it may put us in a state of mind, which may be further specified\nby accompanying words. In comparing music with painting and sculpture,\nWebb notes that the latter may act on our emotions only through their\nimitations, that is, their represented content, whereas music may do\nso through both imitations and impressions (Webb 1769: 28). In this\nway, Webb acknowledges that the expressive potential of music is\ngreater than that of the visual arts, and that this privileged\nposition is not due to imitation.\n\nJames Beattie (1735\u20131803), a Scottish philosopher, voices\nconcerns similar to those of Chabanon when he observes that there are\nemotions that music may express, that do not have a typical vocal\nmanifestation. On the basis of this, he rejects the view that music is\nof necessity imitative, though he concedes that it may be. More\nsignificantly, Beattie claims that there is a crucial difference\nbetween music and the paradigmatically imitative art of painting.\nWhile good paintings are of necessity good imitations, and bad\npaintings are necessarily bad ones, good and bad works of music may be\neither good or bad imitations (Beattie 1779: part I, chapter VI,\nsection 1).\n\nThe Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid (1710\u20131796) argues that\nperception presents us with sensations, which function as signs of\nobjective qualities. Some sensations are artificial signs,\ninstituted by human agreement. Such are words\u2014the connection\nbetween \u2018cat\u2019 and the animal sitting on my lap being\narbitrary. Other sensations are natural signs, and function\nindependently of human agency\u2014for instance, the connection\nbetween smoke and fire. Natural signs typically require us to learn\ntheir connection to the signified objective quality, as in the case of\nsmoke and fire. However, in some cases a natural sign signifies\nwithout requiring prior experience\u2014a child can detect the anger\nin an angry face and responds to it immediately. Musical expression is\nexplicitly described by Reid as an example of this category:\n\n\nOne kind of music inspires grief, another love, another rage or fury.\nThese are all material representations of some affection of the mind.\nNone of these are gained by experience. (Lectures on the Fine\nArts, \u201cMind and Body\u201d)\n\n\nThus, musical expression \u201cis nothing but the fitness of certain\nsounds to produce certain sentiments in our minds\u201d (Lectures\non the Fine Arts, \u201cTaste and the Fine Arts\u201d). As for\nthe imitation of birdsong, battles, and the like, Reid maintains that\nthese only marginally contribute to the beauty of music. The\nimportance of Reid\u2019s view resides in his philosophically\ngrounded view of expression, which does not involve imitation at\nall.\n\nThe economist and philosopher Adam Smith (1723\u201390) traces a\nsharp distinction between vocal and instrumental music. He holds that\nthe greater the disparity between medium and imitated object, the more\npleasure an imitative art will occasion (Of the Nature of that\nImitation that Takes Place in what are called The Imitative Arts,\npart I, 6\u20137). Vocal music may thus only slightly resemble\nimpassioned speech, but precisely because of this it will delight us\nwhen it successfully imitates it (Of the Nature of that\nImitation, part II, 12). Instrumental music, however, lacking a\ntext and deprived of vocal articulation, cannot imitate any object\nsuccessfully, as we can hardly ever recognize anything in it unless\nprompted by a description (Of the Nature of that Imitation,\npart II, 17). Smith develops an alternative view of musical\nexpression, which he illustrates with an interesting parallel. Just as\na natural landscape may be gloomy without imitating anything, so may\nmusic. In both cases the description \u2018gloomy\u2019 ascribes a\ndispositional property, that is, it refers to the capacity the\nlandscape and piece of music have of making us gloomy (Of the\nNature of that Imitation, part II, 23). Once more, expression and\nimitation go separate ways.\n\nAlthough perhaps less radically than their French or English\ncounterparts, German intellectuals also increasingly questioned the\nrole of imitation in music.\n\nThe philosopher and scientist Johann Georg Sulzer (1720\u20131779)\nstill adheres to a rather orthodox view of imitation in music, holding\nthat music imitates impassioned speech (Sulzer 1774,\n\u201cMelody\u201d [1792: III, 370\u2013371; 1995: 91\u201392]).\nHe also extends this account to instrumental music, and holds that\nmusic that fails to express emotions is worthless (Sulzer 1774,\n\u201cInstrumental music\u201d [1792: II, 677\u2013679; 1995:\n95\u201397]).\n\nJohann Mattheson (1681\u20131764), the chief Affektenlehre\ntheorist, embraces a Cartesian, physiological explanation of musical\nexpression as the arousal of emotion produced by music\u2019s action\non the animal spirits (this is the standard view of Mattheson\u2019s\ntheory\u2014see Lippman 1992: 115\u2013116; for an alternative\ninterpretation, see Kivy 1984). Thus, the musician who wishes to\ncompose music expressive of an emotion will have to conform to the\nmovements of the animal spirits associated with that emotion. This\nview alters the connection between emotional expression and imitation,\nas expression is no longer dependent on the imitation of impassioned\nspeech.\n\nJohann Gottfried von Herder (1744\u20131803) retains the idea that\nmusic is an imitative art, whose subjects are\n\n\nall such things and incidents as are most eminently characterized by\nmotion and sound; these include all species of motions, sounds,\nvoices, passions expressed through sounds, and so on. (Herder 1769: I,\n19)\n\n\nThis follows from the nature of music: whereas painting is the art of\nspatial coexistence, music is that of succession. It is by respecting\nthese natural boundaries that the arts may achieve their effects.\nThus,\n\n\nmusic, which works wholly through the succession of time, must never\nmake the depiction of objects in space its main object, as\ninexperienced bunglers do. (Herder 1769: I, 16)\n\n\nThere are similarities between Herder\u2019s philosophy of music and\nRousseau\u2019s. Herder also proposes that today\u2019s music and\nlanguage may have a common ancestor, the main function of which was\nexpressive (Herder 1772: part I, section III, 1; Herder 1769: IV,\n8).\n\nHerder is skeptical with regard to the role of mathematical or\nphysical explanations in musical aesthetics, as these fail to explain\nour first-person hedonic and emotional responses. Much like Rousseau,\nhe finds fault in Rameau on these grounds (Herder 1769: IV, 6).\nHowever, Herder does not abandon scientific explanations altogether,\nand in fact appeals to physiology to advance his own hypothesis\n(Herder 1769: IV, 6). While the details of this proposed explanation\nmight be uninteresting, it is noteworthy that, by appealing to a\ncausal explanation, Herder is weakening the link between expression\nand imitation.\n3.5 The Primacy of Melody: Rousseau\n\nMusic was a lifelong concern for Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712\u20131778), whose musical writings touch on an impressive\nvariety of topics, from music notation and theory to core\nphilosophical concerns such as musical value and expressiveness.\nRousseau was also the author of a remarkably successful opera, Le\nDevin du Village (1752), performed around four hundred times over\nthe course of the fifty years following its premiere.\n\nA contributor to Diderot and D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\nEncyclop\u00e9die (1751), Rousseau embarked on a systematic\nrejection of the views defended by Jean-Philippe Rameau\n(1683\u20131764), the leading music theorist at the time.\nRousseau\u2019s rejection of Rameau was not simply a rejection of his\nmusic theory, but rather of the entire musical practice it was\nsupposed to justify, that is, French music of the time.\n\nRousseau\u2019s Letter on French Music (1753) may be seen as\nan episode in the so-called querelle des bouffons, a dispute\nconcerning the relative merits of Italian and French opera that was\nprompted by the 1752 Paris performance of Giovanni Battista\nPergolesi\u2019s La serva padrona. In the Letter,\nRousseau takes the side of Italian music, holding that its superiority\nover French music is ultimately due to the Italian language, which is\nmore melodious and better articulated than French. French music\nattempts to address the shortcoming of its language by adopting\ncomplex harmonic structures, but Rousseau believes that this only\nfurther hinders its expressive potential. He observes how Italian\nmusic is more moving not in spite of its use of chords that are not\ncompletely filled out, but precisely because of this feature. In the\nLetter, Rousseau also develops the principle of \u201cunity\nof melody\u201d (unit\u00e9 de m\u00e9lodie), according\nto which music ought to present the listener with one single salient\nmelody at any time, the other voices playing a subsidiary and\nsupportive role. It is from this melodic unity that music derives its\ncapacity to move the listener, and in this resides music\u2019s\nvalue. The concept of unity of melody is further elaborated in a\ndedicated entry of Rousseau\u2019s Dictionary of Music\n(1768), where he also states that his Devin du Village was an\nattempt to put that principle into practice (Rousseau 1768,\n\u201cUnity of Melody\u201d; on unity of melody, see Riley 2004:\nchapter 2, and Waeber 2009).\n\nRousseau\u2019s polemical view of harmony as a hindrance to melodic\ndevelopment, as well as the consequent condemnation of French music,\nfound a natural target in Rameau, who defended himself on various\noccasions (Rameau\u2019s responses are collected in Scott 1998; on\nthe debate, see Verba 2016: chapters 2 and 3). In his\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie (1722), Rameau had already\nstated that melody is merely a part of harmony, and in his subsequent\nNouveau syst\u00e8me de musique th\u00e9orique, he had\nattempted to ground the tonal system in the phenomenon of upper\npartial harmonics, the faint overtones that are produced whenever any\nnote is struck. This means that there is strictly speaking no pure\nmelody, as no note is ever heard in isolation from the harmonics it\ngenerates. The ascending series of upper harmonics, Rameau argues,\ncontains the key to tonal harmony. In his Encyclop\u00e9die\narticle \u201cDissonance\u201d, Rousseau accepts that harmony may be\npartly grounded in the structure of the harmonic series, but presses\nRameau on the origin of the minor third, an interval that is as\ncrucial to tonal harmony as it is absent from the series. More\nimportant than these technical qualms is Rousseau\u2019s fundamental\nmethodological difference from Rameau. While Rameau\u2019s musical\naesthetics depends on a theory of music including mathematical and\nphysical constructs inaccessible from the mere experience of\nlistening, Rousseau considers such experience the ultimate judge of\nmusical value, and holds that it points to melody as the part of music\nthat is responsible for its emotional impact on the listener (see\nO\u2019Dea 1995: 19\u201320). Insofar as it concerns the appropriate\nlevel of explanation of musical phenomena, the contrast between\nRousseau and Rameau is not unlike the one between Aristoxenian and\nPythagorean approaches to harmonics (see\n \u00a71.2).\n\nRousseau\u2019s views on the expressive power of music are further\nelaborated in his Essay on the Origin of Languages (1781), in\nwhich he argues that music and natural languages developed out of a\ncommon source, a language used for the expression of feelings\n(Rousseau 1781: chapter XII, \u201cOrigin of music\u201d; see Thomas\n1995: chapter 5). Following this common origin, both language and\nmusic underwent a process of decay. Languages developed in order to\ncommunicate increasingly complex thoughts, but lost expressive power,\nespecially after the emergence of writing (Rousseau 1781: chapters\nV\u2013VI). Thus, Plato\u2019s Greece, Rousseau states, had no\nshortage of philosophers, but lacked musicians (Rousseau 1781: chapter\nXIX). Regarding this remark, Martinelli (2012 [2019: 62])\nobserves:\n\n\nAnticipating the line of reasoning that would later be adopted by\nNietzsche, Rousseau openly contrasted music and philosophy, strongly\nundermining the tradition that saw them as sisters.\n\n\nAccording to Rousseau, music degenerated along with language and\ngradually lost its original expressive power. This happened as free\nmelodic phrases progressively turned into regimented musical systems,\nin which harmony and counterpoint were introduced in order to\ncompensate for the loss of natural melody (Rousseau 1781: chapter\nXIX).\n\nIt is tempting, though perhaps imprecise, to see in Rousseau\u2019s\nview a precursor of the musilanguage hypothesis, recently proposed by\nSteven Brown (1999; on this, see Waeber 2013; Mithen 2005 advances a\nview similar to Brown\u2019s).\n\nAs is apparent from his hypothesis concerning the origins of music,\nRousseau thinks that the expression of emotions is music\u2019s main\nfunction. A qualified notion of imitation plays a crucial role in\nthis. While Rousseau accepts the eighteenth century view of art as\nimitation (Rousseau 1768, \u201cImitation\u201d), he is also clear\nin stating that musical imitation is different from the kinds we find\nin other art forms. Music does not imitate the human passions or other\nobjects by presenting us with their sonic equivalent, but rather by\narousing in the listener the emotions that the object would give rise\nto. In Rousseau\u2019s words,\n\n\nIt will not represent these things directly, but will arouse the same\nmovements in the soul that are experienced in seeing them. (Rousseau\n1768, \u201cImitation\u201d)\n\n\nIt is because of this that musical imitation is not confined to one\nsense modality. If painting may represent only objects of sight,\n\n\n[m]usic would seem to have the same limits with respect to hearing;\nnevertheless, it portrays everything, even objects which are only\nvisible: by an almost inconceivable magic trick it seems to put the\neye in the ear, and the greatest marvel of an Art that acts only by\nmotion is to be able to form even the image of rest. Night, sleep,\nsolitude, and silence are counted among Music\u2019s great portraits.\n(Rousseau 1768, \u201cImitation\u201d; similar claims on musical\nimitation are made elsewhere in Rousseau\u2019s oeuvre, see Rousseau\n1768, \u201cOpera\u201d, and Rousseau 1781: chapter XVI)\n\n\nEffectively, the imitation that Rousseau considers central to music is\nthe arousal of an emotion that is specific enough to be associated\nwith a given object. Thus, while Rousseau is not skeptical with regard\nto music\u2019s capacity to imitate worldly objects, he is able to\ndefend this view because he redefines imitation in terms of emotional\narousal. In this sense, he is still representative of a progressive\nshift away from a view of music as imitation.\n\nDespite its charm, Rousseau\u2019s view of musical imitation does not\nseem to withstand critical scrutiny. It is unconvincing as an\nexplanation of the musical imitation of emotions. It may be though\nthat an emotion we perceive always corresponds to another emotion we\nfeel, and thus that we could depict the former by arousing the latter.\nBut in fact, we may respond to, e.g., rage with a variety of emotions,\nfrom more rage, to fear, disappointment, schadenfreude, etc. The\ntheory is only more implausible when it comes to the depiction of\nobjects other than emotions, as the same object may arouse very\ndifferent emotions, depending on the subject\u2019s disposition and\nbeliefs about it.\n3.6 Music between Form and Content: Kant\n\nWhile his comments on music are at times disparaged as lacking\nartistic sensitivity, Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is arguably the\nfirst major modern philosopher to discuss instrumental music in the\ncontext of a systematic account of the arts. His influence on\nsubsequent musical thinking, and particularly on the formalist strand,\nis undeniable (see the entry on\n history of western philosophy of music: since 1800, section 1.6),\n but more controversial is whether he himself defends a variety of\nformalism. Kant\u2019s main discussion of music is contained in the\nfirst section of the Critique of the Power of Judgment\n(1790), but some remarks are also found in his Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View (1798).\n\nKant\u2019s views on music follow from an account of beauty that must\nbe briefly reconstructed. Kant contrasts the beautiful, which\naspires to universality, with the agreeable, which is\nsubjective and idiosyncratic. According to Kant, when we ascribe\nbeauty to objects we are making judgments of taste. These are\nsubjective judgments, and include a feeling of pleasure. In this\nsense, judgments of taste are quite like judgments of agreeableness.\nThe beautiful, however, is different from the agreeable in that it\nrequires disinterested pleasure (interessenloses\nWohlgefallen), that is, pleasure that does not presuppose the\nexistence of its object. For example, I may find beautiful an imagined\ntune or painting, but I can\u2019t find a refreshing drink agreeable\nif I merely think about it (Kant 1790: \u00a72).\n\nAs they do not depend on concepts, and essentially include a\nsubjective element of pleasure, judgments of taste are non-cognitive,\nand cannot therefore aspire to the same general validity as, say,\nmathematical proofs. However, judgments of taste are universal. When\none judges an object to be beautiful, one is also at the same time\nasserting that anyone ought to find it beautiful (Kant 1790:\n\u00a76\u20137). This again stands in contrast with the agreeable.\nWhen I judge the taste of calvados to be pleasant, I am not requiring\ngeneral assent; in contrast, the pleasure associated with a work of\nmusic is one I expect anyone to feel\u2014it is a beautiful piece of\nmusic.\n\nThe non-conceptual universality of judgments of taste is grounded in\nwhat Kant calls \u201cthe free play of the imagination and the\nunderstanding\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a79). Ordinary perceptual and\ncognitive activities require the cooperation of imagination and\nunderstanding (here it is important to keep in mind that Kant\nconsiders imagination to be involved in perception) but in these cases\nimagination is guided by concepts. In the free play required by\njudgments of taste, imagination and understanding interact\nunconstrained by concepts, but in a way that is common to all human\nbeings (Kant 1790: \u00a720 ff.).\n\nKant distinguishes between agreeable and beautiful arts. While both\ninvolve pleasure, agreeable arts merely aim at arousing enjoyment,\nwhereas beautiful arts involve cognition (Kant 1790: \u00a744). The\napparent ambiguity in Kant\u2019s remarks on music runs so deep that\nhe may seem to contradict himself even on the status of music as a\nbeautiful art. He lists Tafelmusik (light music composed to\nbe a background accompaniment to dining) alongside the art of telling\namusing stories and jokes as an example of agreeable art, and adds\nthat this kind of music is supposed to encourage conversation\n\u201cwithout anyone paying the least attention to its\ncomposition\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a744). In the \u201cRemark\u201d\nthat concludes the first section of the Critique, Kant once\nmore lists music alongside the joke as an agreeable art. However,\nelsewhere in the same work Kant clearly counts music a beautiful art,\nranking it alongside poetry and painting (\u00a744, 191). More\nimportantly, Kant discusses music in \u00a751, where he introduces his\ndivision of the beautiful arts. Samantha Matherne (2014:\n135\u2013138) has argued that Kant\u2019s apparent hesitation is\nactually grounded in a different attitude we may take to music. If we\nattend to the bodily effect of the piece, music will be merely\nagreeable, whereas a focus on the formal structure of the work will\nmake possible a judgment of taste, and thus music may be found\nbeautiful.\n\nA final point on musical beauty is worthy of mention. Kant\ndistinguishes between free and adherent (anh\u00e4ngend)\nbeauty. Adherent beauty presupposes a concept of the object\u2019s\npurpose. Thus, a work of architecture is judged beautiful or not\naccording to its success or otherwise in housing people, institutions,\nor businesses. The resulting judgment of taste is characterized by\nKant as impure. Free beauty does not presuppose any concept. As\nexamples of free beauty, Kant mentions abstract patterns, and\ninstrumental music, \u201cindeed all music without a text\u201d\n(Kant 1790: \u00a716). In general, when Kant discusses music he has\npure instrumental music in mind. If one considers that previous\nthinkers devoted almost exclusive attention to vocal music, this is a\nsignificant shift in focus, and one that will be confirmed by the\nphilosophy of music following Kant.\n\nA further ambiguity is represented by Kant\u2019s apparent commitment\nboth to a variety of musical formalism, according to which musical\nbeauty uniquely resides in the relationship between its component\nparts, and to the idea that music is expressive of emotions. This is a\nmanifestation of a general tension in Kant\u2019s aesthetics (see\nGuyer 1977). A formalist tendency is evident when Kant claims that the\nproper object of the pure judgment of taste in music is composition,\nby which he means the arrangement of tones (Kant 1790: \u00a714).\nLater on, Kant states that music \u201cmerely plays with\nsensations\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a753), offering this in support of\nhis claims regarding music\u2019s low rank among the arts.\n\nDespite these apparent professions of formalism, Kant also stresses\nmusic\u2019s connection to the sphere of emotions. Particularly, he\nseems to accept a version of the Affektenlehre, according to\nwhich works of music may arouse specific emotions in the listener. In\n\u00a753, Kant affirms that music may convey an emotion because of its\nanalogy with the tone of voice typical of impassioned speech (see also\nKant 1798: \u00a718).\n\nIn the face of these textual ambiguities, an option is to adopt a\nformalist interpretation and hold that Kant was merely paying lip\nservice to the Affektenlehre (Kivy 2009: 50 ff.; Schueller\n1955: 224\u201325). However, other scholars deny that Kant was a\nformalist. Young (2020) attributes to him an imitation theory of\nexpressiveness: music imitates the tones characteristic of impassioned\nspeech. Matherne (2014) attempts to reconcile formalist and\nexpressivist elements in Kant\u2019s thought. Crucial to her\ninterpretation is the concept of an aesthetic idea, which Kant defines\nas\n\n\nthat representation of the imagination that occasions much thinking\nthough without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e.,\nconcept, to be adequate to it. (Kant 1790: \u00a749)\n\n\nAesthetic ideas are imaginative representations that cannot be\nexhausted by any given concept\u2014think of an abstract painting and\nof the multitude of things it could look like or symbolize. Aesthetic\nideas are crucially involved in our experience of the beautiful, and\nKant goes as far as to define beauty as the expression of aesthetic\nideas (Kant 1790: \u00a751). In his discussion of music, Kant states\nthat the form of a composition\u2014he explicitly mentions\n\u201charmony and melody\u201d\u2014expresses\n\n\nthe aesthetic ideas of a coherent whole of an unutterable fullness of\nthought, corresponding to a certain theme, which constitutes the\ndominant affect in the piece. (Kant 1790: \u00a753)\n\n\nHere the expression of a piece\u2019s overarching emotional\ncharacter, a central concern for the Affektenlehre, is\nexplicitly linked to the piece\u2019s formal structure. Matherne\n(2014: 134) concludes that Kant is defending what she terms\n\u201cexpressive formalism\u201d, a view according to which music is\nable to express aesthetic ideas pertaining to the realm of emotions,\nand does so by means of its formal structure.\n\nKant\u2019s view of music\u2019s relative value as an art has also\nbeen an object of critical attention (Weatherston 1996; Parret 1998).\nKant ranks the arts according to two distinct criteria. When it comes\nto \u201ccharm and movement of the mind\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a753),\nmusic is first among all of the arts, as it arouses emotions more\ndeeply than any other art form. It is clear that Kant does not\nconsider this criterion particularly important to artistic value.\nAdditionally, music occupies the bottom of the hierarchy when one\nranks the arts according to the second criterion, that is, \u201cin\nterms of the culture that they provide for the mind\u201d (Kant 1790:\n\u00a753). To provide culture for the mind is described by Kant as to\ncontribute to the enlargement of the faculties of imagination and\nunderstanding\u2014think again of an abstract painting, and how it\nmay enrich our capacity to give visible form to some ideas.\n\nWhile they may raise various difficult interpretive issues,\nKant\u2019s views on music have more than a purely historical\ninterest. Some contemporary commentators and philosophers of music\nhave suggested that they might be brought to bear on current debates\n(see Bicknell 2002; Ginsborg 2011: 337; Matherne 2014:\n139\u2013140).\n\nRegardless of whether Kant\u2019s formalism is or not a nineteenth\ncentury construction, his awareness of music\u2019s purely formal\naspect signals a change in Western philosophy of music. Vocal music is\nno longer the center of theoretical speculation.
