It is typically\ntaken to exclude philosophy produced in non-Iberian former colonies,\nwith the occasional exception of former French colonies in the\nCaribbean. Other names have also been used to refer to the whole or\npart of Latin American philosophy, including Spanish American, Hispanic\nAmerican, Iberoamerican, and Latino/a philosophy. The first two refer\nspecifically to the philosophy of former Spanish colonies, the third to\nthat of former Iberian colonies, and the fourth to the philosophy\nproduced in the United States by descendants of Latin Americans.\n\n\nLatin American philosophy is usually taken to have originated around\n1550, when Spanish conquerors founded the first schools in Latin\nAmerica and began to teach and publish philosophical treatises.\nRecently, there has been an effort on the part of historians to\ninclude pre-Columbian thought in Latin American philosophy, although\nthe pre-Columbian texts cited are often fragmentary and religious in\ntone and intention. In terms of traditions, style, and influence,\npost-Columbian Latin American philosophy is part of the Western\nphilosophical tradition. Indeed, philosophical discussions in Latin\nAmerica have and continue to be dominated by European philosophical\ninfluences. Even those Latin American philosophers who have endeavored\nto develop original theories have frequently framed their own\ncontributions in the terms of European thinkers. Partly in response to\nthis phenomenon, there has arisen a large body of literature concerned\nwith the identity, authenticity, and originality of Latin American\nphilosophy.\n\n\nLatin American philosophy has been both original and derivative. Much\nof its history involves work that is derivative of European\nphilosophical figures and movements. At the same, time Latin American\nphilosophy has produced important philosophers, original approaches to\nold philosophical problems, and formulations of new problems not\nalready within the European philosophical tradition. Moreover,\nvirtually all historical European philosophical traditions have been\npresent in Latin America, as are most contemporary movements in the\nUnited States and Europe. Finally, there has been a significant\ninterest in social concerns among Latin American philosophers, partly\nas a reaction to the social and economic circumstances of Latin\nAmerica. This has led Latin American philosophical work to be\ncomparatively more concerned with social issues than philosophy in,\nfor example, the United States.\n\n\nThe influence of Latin American philosophy outside of Latin America\nhas thus far been relatively small. Although the situation has been\nimproving, very few Latin American philosophers are currently read\noutside of Latin America. This situation is made worse by the paucity\nof English-language translations of Latin American philosophical\nworks. Moreover, internal to Latin America, philosophers read and\nrespond to each other with less frequency than one might expect or\nwish. However, the philosophy of liberation has had some impact both\nin North America and in developing countries in Africa, and Latinos/as\nhave participated actively in the discussion of a variety of topics,\nespecially those having to do with race, ethnicity, and social\nidentities in the United States. In the past few years, some of these\nphilosophers have occupied positions of leadership in the\nphilosophical establishment and their work has been the subject of\ndiscussion by prominent non-Latino/a philosophers.\n\n\nThis article is divided into three main parts: history, the\ncontemporary period, and problems and topics.

History\n\nThe history of Latin American philosophy is usefully divided into five\nperiods: Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independentist, Nationalist, and\nContemporary (that is, the twentieth century to the present). Most\nperiods are characterized by the dominance of a particular tradition:\nthe Pre-Columbian by Amerindian religious cosmologies, the Colonial by\nscholasticism, the Independentist by Early Modern philosophy and\nEnlightenment thought, and the Nationalist by positivism. However, the\ncontemporary situation is more complex and varied. For that reason, it\nis discussed in a separate and subsequent section, apart from the\nother historical periods that are the focus of this section.\n\nThere is good evidence that in at least the major pre-Columbian\ncivilizations there were attempts to explore questions about the nature\nof reality, the limits of knowledge, and the basis of right action.\nMoreover, such work persisted in various forms for some time after the\nConquest (Restrepo 2010; Maffie 2014). Whether this body of work is rightly\ncharacterized as philosophy or something else is a disputed matter,\nwith scholars disagreeing about how best to characterize it (see\nNuccetelli, 2001, ch. 3; Mignolo, 2003). It is clear that the\nreflective and speculative work of pre-Columbian Amerindian peoples was\nundertaken without any familiarity with the Western philosophical\ntradition. Those inquiries were also generally undertaken within the\nreligious frameworks of their places and times and the literary or\npresentational modes in which such questions were entertained were\ntypically removed from traditional forms of European philosophical\nproduction.\n\nDespite these differences with European philosophy, and despite the\noften fragmentary and frequently second-hand information that survives\nconcerning pre-Columbian thought, extant works have nevertheless\nsupported a variety of intriguing and subtle accounts of those\nphilosophical or proto-philosophical\n reflections.[1]\nStill, the conventional view about the pre-Columbian\nperiod is that its reflections had little to no impact on the\nindisputably philosophical intellectual production in the period that\nimmediately followed the\n Conquest.[2]\n\nEuropean-derived philosophy began in Latin America in the sixteenth\ncentury. Among the most notable figures of this period is\nBartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas (1484\u20131566), whose work on the\nrights of conquered Amerindians has had a particularly important and\nlong-lasting legacy. Scholasticism, introduced by the Spanish and\nPortuguese clergy that arrived with the conquistadores, was\nthe dominant philosophical perspective. Most of the work produced\nduring the first two centuries in the colonies was cast in the\nframework used in the Iberian peninsula. It was particularly indebted\nto the thought of both sixteenth-century Iberians and their medieval\npredecessors. Important figures included Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n(1548\u20131617) and Francisco de Vitoria (1492\u20131546), and\nearlier medieval philosopher-theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u20131274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6\u20131308). Most of\nthese authors were born in the Iberian peninsula, but many of them had\nsettled in the colonies. Among the most important, apart from Las\nCasas, are Alonso de la Vera Cruz (ca.  1504\u201384), who composed\nthe first fully philosophical treatises in Latin America, Tom\u00e1s\nde Mercado (ca. 1530\u20131575), and Antonio Rubio\n(1548\u20131615). Some of the works of these authors, such as Rubio\u2019s\nLogica mexicana, were known and used in Europe.\n\nHumanism also had some influence, as is clear from the work of Juan\nde Zum\u00e1rraga (ca.1468\u20131548) and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz\n(1651\u20131695), among others. Sor Juana has the distinction of being the\nfirst Latin American thinker to raise questions concerning the status\nof women in Latin American society. She is also retrospectively\nregarded as the first Latin American feminist writer and philosopher\n(see also the section on feminist philosophy, below.)\n\nThe eighteenth century, under the influence of modern philosophy and\nthe Enlightenment, helped prepare the way for the revolutionary wars of\nindependence. Philosophical discussions of the time were dominated by\npolitical thought. Even so, scholasticism continued to influence\nthe intellectual class and stoked an ongoing interest in traditional\nmetaphysical questions. Authors such as Juan Benito D\u00edaz de\nGamarra y D\u00e1valos (1745\u20131783) and Francisco Javier Clavijero\n(1731\u20131787), both from Mexico, were influenced by early modern\nphilosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650). However, the\nwave of independentist thought found its greatest inspiration in\nEnlightenment political philosophy. In particular, liberal political\nideals based on the thought of the French philosophes helped\nto consolidate independentist views throughout Latin America. Among the\nsignificant Latin American inheritors of that tradition were\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (1783\u20131830) in Venezuela and Colombia,\nMiguel Hidalgo (1753\u20131811) and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\n(1765\u20131815) in Mexico, and much later, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed\n(1854\u20131895) in Cuba.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many Latin American countries secured\nindependence from European colonial powers. In the wake of\nindependence, the newly liberated peoples faced the challenge of\nforming stable, enduring nations out of the remnants of the Spanish\nand Portuguese empires. The predominant political concerns of that era\nincluded the organization and consolidation of the new nations, along\nwith aspirations for social stability, national integration of largely\ndiverse peoples. The overarching ambition in many nations was to\nachieve the same economic and social progress enjoyed by other nations\nin Europe and North America.\n\nIn this context, the ideology of choice was a version of positivism. The positivist\nmotto, \u201corder and progress,\u201d which graces the Brazilian\nflag, suggests why positivism was especially appealing in the context\nof nation building. Positivism\u2019s emphasis on both empirical\nscience and pragmatic solutions appeared to provide a practical\nfoundation for attaining the diverse ends of the new nations. Indeed,\npositivism became so influential and widely accepted by intellectuals\nthat it became the official state philosophy of several nations. It was\neven used to justify dictatorial regimes, as in the case of Mexico.\n\nPositivism of the Latin American variety was derived from a peculiar\nmix of European ideas primarily originating in the thought of Auguste\nComte (1798\u20131857), Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903), and Ernst Haeckel\n(1834\u20131919). The period of positivist hegemony, in which it was the\ndominant philosophical perspective in Latin America, extended roughly\nfrom the middle of the nineteenth century to the first decade of the\ntwentieth. Among the most famous positivists were Gabino Barreda\n(1818\u20131881) and Justo Sierra (1848\u20131912) in Mexico, Jos\u00e9\nVictorino Lastarria (1817\u20131888) in Chile, and Domingo Faustino\nSarmiento (1811\u20131888) in Argentina. Andr\u00e9s Bello (1781\u20131865),\nfrom both Venezuela and Chile, and Juan Bautista Alberdi (1810\u20131884)\nand Esteban Echevarr\u00eda (1805\u20131851), from Argentina, were\ntransitional figures between independentist liberal thought and\npositivism. Later, Jos\u00e9 Ingenieros (1877\u20131925), from Argentina,\nand Enrique Jos\u00e9 Varona (1849\u20131933), from Cuba, prepared the way\nfor the revolt against positivism, although their thought arose in a\npositivist context and maintained an alliance with positivist\nideas. \n2. The Contemporary Period\n\nContemporary Latin American philosophy begins in the twentieth\ncentury, around 1910, coinciding with the decline of positivism. By\n1930, the remaining positivists in Latin America were usually regarded\nas museum pieces rather than proponents of a viable philosophy meriting\nserious attention. The contemporary, post-positivist period can be\ndivided into three distinct sub-periods. The\nfirst\u2014rebellion\u2014is characterized by the backlash\nagainst positivism and the subsequent development of foundations for\nfuture philosophical movements (ca.1910\u20131940). The\nsecond\u2014normalcy\u2014is characterized by the\nachievement of a degree of institutionalization and normalization in\nthe philosophical profession (1940\u20131960). The third\nperiod\u2014maturity (ca. 1960 to the present)\u2014is\ndistinguished by the degree of professional and philosophical maturity\nattained by Latin American philosophers.\n2.1 Rebellion and the Generation of Founders (1910\u20131940)\n\nThe anti-positivist rebellion constitutes the first phase of\ncontemporary Latin American thought. It was brought about by a\ngeneration of philosophers born around 1910, all of whom were trained\nas positivists, before breaking with it. The principal members of this\ngeneration\u2014called \u201cthe generation of founders\u201d by\nFrancisco Romero, and dubbed \u201cthe generation of\npatriarchs\u201d by Francisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada\u2014are well\nknown: Alejandro Korn (1860\u20131936) in Argentina, Alejandro\nOctavio De\u00fastua (1849\u20131945) in Peru, Jos\u00e9\nVasconcelos (1882\u20131959) and Antonio Caso (1883\u20131946) in\nMexico, Enrique Jos\u00e9 Molina (1871\u20131956) in Chile, Carlos\nVaz Ferreira (1872\u20131958) in Uruguay, and Raimundo de Farias\nBrito (1862\u20131917) in Brazil.\n\nThe adoption of ideas from France, and later from Germany, was\ninstrumental in formulating the basis for rejecting positivism. It\nbegan with the influence of Emile Boutroux (1845\u20131921), Henri\nBergson (1859\u20131941), and French vitalism and intuitionism. It\nwas cemented when the Spaniard Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset visited\nLatin America in 1916 and introduced the thought of Max Scheler\n(1874\u20131928), Nicolai Hartmann (1882\u20131950), and other\nGerman philosophers. Ortega y Gasset and the German philosophy of the\nspirit had substantial influence on the generation that followed that\nof the founders, called by Mir\u00f3 Quesada \u201cthe generation\nof forgers.\u201d Samuel Ramos (1897\u20131959), from Mexico,\nFrancisco Romero (1891\u20131962), from Argentina, Alceu Amoroso Lima\n(1893\u20131982), from Brazil, and Jos\u00e9 Carlos\nMari\u00e1tegui (1894\u20131930), from Peru, among others, followed\nthe founders\u2019 course, attacking positivist ideas and favoring in some\ninstances a rather poetic philosophical style that contrasts with the\nscientistic emphasis of positivism. They completed the process\ninitiated by the founders and laid the foundations of future\ndevelopments.\n\nOne of the main preoccupations of the founders and the generation that\nfollowed them was the absorption of European ideas; they wanted to be\nphilosophically up to date. In contrast with the objectives of the\nphilosophers that preceded them, which were for the most part\nreligious (during the colonial period), political (during the period\nof independence), or economic (during the nationalist period), the\nconcern of these thinkers was more systematically philosophical in\nmotivation.  This was a significant change in Latin American\nphilosophy, insofar as scholasticism, Enlightenment liberalism, and\npositivism were typically undertaken (at least in Latin American) for\npurposes frequently disconnected from a conception of philosophy in\nwhich the discipline was pursued for its own sake. For scholastics,\nthe primary objective was the apologetic defense of the faith; for\nliberals, the end was political emancipation; and for positivists, the\ngoal was national integration and economic and social progress. In all\nthree cases, European ideas were typically adopted with\npre-established ends in mind. As a consequence, philosophical\nmovements were not obviously the products of philosophical concerns as\nsuch. \n\nIn contrast to prior generations, the founders and those who followed\nthem did not tend to adopt European ideas with a view to the defense of\na body of doctrine, or in order to achieve certain practical ends of\npolitical liberation or of national unity and economic and social\nprogress. Their ideas arose from philosophical dissatisfactions with\npositivism. Thus, we find in the writings of Caso, De\u00fastua, and\nthe other founders who rebelled against positivism, purely\nphilosophical criticisms of that perspective. They were concerned, for\nexample, with freedom and the fact that determinism, which they\nconsidered undesirable, was a necessary corollary of\npositivism.  Still, their attitude toward the ideas\nthey adopted was seldom critical. They saw the defects of positivism,\nbut too often they still accepted uncritically the solutions they\nborrowed from non-positivist European philosophers to fight it.\n\nAlthough the founders and some of their immediate successors had\nattained some emancipation in the philosophical enterprise, full\nmaturity remained elusive. Still, the sophistication of some\nthinkers, such as Korn, was considerable and planted the critical seeds\nthat germinated in the following period.\n2.2 Normalcy and the Generation of 1910 (1940\u20131960)\n\nIt is not until the generation born around 1910 reached maturity in\nthe 1940s that a self-critical spirit clearly entered Latin American\nphilosophy. A state of normalcy became established in most countries\nof Latin America, and what might be called Latin-Americanism\ngrew significantly. The limitations on originality characteristic of\nprevious generations were in part the result of the lack of\nself-criticism and the practical difficulties involved in pursuing a\nphilosophical career in Latin America. The contribution of those\ngenerations was largely restricted to the importation of foreign\nthought; originality in substantive doctrine was rarely achieved, or\neven an ambition.\n\nThere were exceptions, of course. Romero, for example, in his\nTheory of Man (1952), developed an original\nphilosophical anthropology. However, philosophers and philosophical\npractice was not \u201cnormalized,\u201d as Romero put it, until the emergence\nof the subsequent generation philosophers. That group included Risieri\nFrondizi (1910\u20131985), Eduardo Garc\u00eda Maynez\n(1908\u20131993), Miguel Reale (1910\u20132006), Francisco\nMir\u00f3 Quesada (1918\u2013), Leopoldo Zea (1912\u20132004), and\nJuan Llamb\u00edas de Azevedo (1907\u20131972).\n\nThis group was the first generation of Latin American philosophers to\nbenefit from formal education in philosophy. Previous philosophers had\nbeen mostly self-taught, typically trained in another profession,\nbut taking up philosophy out of personal interest. The\nstructural changes in the academy introduced by the Founders and the\ngeneration that followed made it possible for an entire generation to\nbe trained by philosophers at the university.\n\nAnother important general feature of this period of Latin American\nphilosophy was that the incipient Latin-Americanism of the previous\ngeneration developed and flourished. This change became evident with\nthe philosophers born around 1910 and those who followed them. Several\nphilosophers of this generation readily traveled throughout Latin\nAmerica and establishing dialogue with other Latin Americans. This is\nnot to say that Latin-Americanism in philosophy was very robust. Even\ntoday, lack of region-wide philosophical dialogue remains more common\nthan not, and communities of discourse tend to be more local or\nnational than international. Still, philosophical communication within\nLatin America markedly increased during this period.\n\nOne of the factors that helped the development of philosophy was the\nincreasing consciousness of a distinctly Latin American philosophical\nidentity, of a sense that there was something different or distinctive\nabout Latin American philosophy. In part, this was a result of growing\nconsciousness of the increasing importance of Latin America in the\nworld and, on the philosophical side, of the introduction in Latin\nAmerica of Ortega\u2019s perspectivism. By the time of Samuel Ramos and\nLeopoldo Zea, the Founders\u2019 preoccupation with the existence of an\nautochthonous Latin American philosophy gave rise to a controversy\nabout whether and how it existed. This debate was one in which\npractically all important philosophers of the period participated. In\nturn, this debate provided impetus to the study and dissemination of\nthe philosophical work of Latin American thinkers throughout the\nregion.\n\nNotable work in this vein includes An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\nReulet\u2019s (1910\u20131997) groundbreaking work, published\nin Tierra Firme in 1936 and entitled \u201cPanorama de las\nideas filos\u00f3ficas en Hispanoam\u00e9rica.\u201d Subsequent\nwork by Zea on positivism in Mexico, written in the early 1940s, as\nwell as Ramos\u2019 historical study of Mexican philosophy took up the\nthread, as did Ram\u00f3n Insua Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s history of\nphilosophy in Hispanic America and Guillermo Francovich\u2019s account of\nphilosophy in Bolivia. In the eight decades since the publication of\nS\u00e1nchez Reulet\u2019s essay, there has been a remarkable\nproliferation of work concerned with the identity of Latin American\nphilosophy. In addition, anthologies, specialized works, and critical\neditions of Latin American philosophical classics have been\npublished. The very controversy concerning the existence and\npossibility of an autochthonous Latin American philosophy that drew so\nmuch attention in the second quarter of the twentieth century (and,\nfor that matter, still continues), has helped to promote and spread\nthe knowledge of Latin American thought and the philosophical dialogue\namong Latin American philosophers.[3]\n\nA second factor that contributed to philosophical growth and\nLatin-Americanism was political oppression and the periodic repression\nof intellectual freedom in Latin America. This was not a phenomenon\nlimited to any one period of Latin American philosophy. The colonial\nregime was without a doubt paradigmatic of intellectual oppression and\ncontrol, but the fact of oppression and intellectual constraints\nbecame more profound after independence. In the nineteenth century,\npositivists used philosophy as an instrument for specific political\nand social agendas, and it was used as a basis for suppressing\ndissent. In the twentieth century this oppressive pattern was not\nlimited to a specific intellectual orientation; philosophical\nsuppression became institutionalized in regimes of the right and the\nleft.  The result has always been the same: intellectual abuse, the\nviolation of rights indispensable for the pursuit of philosophical\nideas and their investigation, the lack of freedom of expression, and\nthe manipulation of pedagogic institutions and scientific\ninvestigation for political and ideological ends. Latin American\nintellectuals subject to these pressures have regularly been forced to\ngo into exile, a state of affairs that has become almost customary and\nis prevalent to this day in some countries. Frondizi\u2019s life is\nparadigmatic of the situation: his many trips throughout Latin America\nwere the result of the periodic political upheavals and oppression in\nArgentina. An indirect but unexpectedly beneficial result of this\nrecurring situation was that the philosophical peripatetism of Latin\nAmerican philosophers contributed to inter-American philosophical\ndialogue.\n\nPhilosophy in Latin America was also transformed by the arrival of\nSpanish \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Among the most influential were:\nJoaquin Xirau (1895\u20131946), Eduardo Nicol (1907\u20131990),\nJos\u00e9 Ferrater Mora (1912\u20131991), Jos\u00e9 Gaos\n(1900\u20131969), Luis Recas\u00e9ns Siches (1903\u20131977), Juan\nD. Garc\u00eda Bacca (1901\u20131992), Jos\u00e9 Medina\nEchevarr\u00eda (1903\u20131977), Maria Zambrano (1904\u2013191),\nand almost fifty others (see Abell\u00e1n, 1967). There were diverse\neffects of the arrival of this group. First, their migrations\nthroughout Latin America helped break down some of the national\nbarriers between philosophical communities in Latin America. The\nconception of hispanidad that they inherited from Miguel de\nUnamuno and from Ortega, and the need to establish themselves in Latin\nAmerica, helped the process; they went from country to country,\nspreading ideas and contributing to the increase in philosophical\ndialogue. Second, many of them helped implement changes in university\ncurricula across Latin America, frequently establishing lasting\nprograms in philosophy. The effects of their work became evident when\nthe generation born around 1910 reached maturity. It was at that point\nthat Latin American philosophers began to think and act\nphilosophically in pan-Latin American terms, traveling, exchanging\nideas, and cooperating in projects of common interest.\n\nThe period that goes from 1940 to 1960 does not reveal drastic changes\nin philosophical orientation. The generation of the Founders used\nFrench vitalism as an instrument to reject positivism, and the\nfollowing generation, with Ortega\u2019s help, took charge of the process,\nincorporating German philosophy and the new ideas introduced by\nphenomenology and existentialism. At this time, Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976) and Jean\u2013Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980)\nconstituted the dominant philosophical force in Latin\nAmerica. Simultaneously, scholasticism experienced renewed\nimpetus. The number of sympathizers of philosophical analysis and\nMarxism continued to grow, but Thomism, phenomenology, existentialism,\nand various versions of nationalist and culturalist philosophy were\nthe dominant approaches throughout Latin America. Those working\noutside the dominant currents had little institutional power.\n2.3 Maturity (1960\u2013present)\n\nBy the 1960s, philosophy in Latin America had indisputably reached a\nlevel of philosophical maturity. The work had markedly increased in\noriginality and depth, and some of it achieved international\nvisibility. This period of maturity continues to the present. To\nappreciate the distinctiveness of this new situation, it helps to\nrecall that the period of normalcy was characterized by (1) critical\ninteraction with the philosophical ideas coming from outside Latin\nAmerica, (2) an increase in dialogue within Latin America, and (3) the\ninstitutionalization of philosophy. In the period of maturity, these\nfeatures became stable and the general caliber of philosophical work\ncontinued to improve accordingly.\n\nIf one measures philosophical activity by the number of new journals\nfounded, or by the number of important congresses that occur, one might\nmistakenly conclude that philosophical activity actually diminished\nafter the 1960s. However, many of the journals founded in the preceding\ntwenty years continued publication, so there was actually a net\nincrease in fora for philosophical work. Moreover, more than a dozen\nimportant congresses and philosophical meetings took place between 1960\nand 1980. In short, the activity related to publications and\nprofessional meetings had reached a healthy level of\nstability. \n\nFour philosophical currents deserve special attention at this period\nbecause of their growing influence and the new ideas and approaches\nthey introduced in Latin American philosophy: socialist and Marxist\nthought (broadly conceived), philosophical analysis, the philosophy of\nliberation, and the history of philosophy. \n\nLatin America has had a long and notable history of receptivity to\nsocialist thought. Its introduction goes back to the nineteenth\ncentury. The impact of the socialist ideas of Claude Henri de\nSaint-Simon (1790\u20131825) and Charles Fourier (1772\u20131873) are clearly\nvisible in the treatise Dogma socialista of Esteban\nEchevarr\u00eda (1805\u20131851). In the twentieth century, Emilio Frugoni\n(1880\u20131969) in Uruguay and Mari\u00e1tegui in Peru, among others,\ndeveloped Marxist accounts, although frequently in heterodox terms.\nFor example, Mari\u00e1tegui allowed that there is no essential\nconflict between religious thought and Marxism, departing from the\nstandard materialist, atheist commitments of orthodox Marxism. He also\nheld that the conception of economic stages in Marx, modeled on Europe,\ndid not apply to Peru. Although bourgeois liberal\ncapitalism had not materialized in Peru, he held that the only way to\nmove forward was to transition to socialism.\n\nLatin American Marxism has been diverse in its philosophical\nparticulars, and is subject to ongoing development. Even so, many\nforms of Latin American Marxism commitments to the following: (1) an\nend to imperialism, neo-colonialism and class oppression through\nsocialist democratic change and/or revolution; (2) a form of socialist\nhumanism based on (a) ending the capitalist exploitation of human\nbeing by human being, and (b) upholding a model of dignity based on\neconomic and social equality; (3) a conception of philosophy as\ncommitted to understanding the world in all its dynamic and\ninterrelated aspects, theorizing the meanings of capitalism and\nsocialism, and shedding light on acting accordingly.  Class\nconsciousness of workers, the proletariat, or the people is typically\nregarded as an important engine of social change. Apart from these\nshared commitments, Antonio Gramsci\u2019s (1891\u20131937) influential\nmodel of \u201corganic intellectuals\u201d\u2014intellectuals who\nsupport social revolution with critical perspectives\u2014also\nresonated with a range of leftist intellectuals who lent their support\nto Marxist revolutionary movements in Cuba, Nicaragua, and\nelsewhere.[4]\n\nDespite a long-standing openness to various strands of socialist\nthought, it was only after 1960 that Marxism gained notable academic\nstanding throughout Latin America. Indeed, Harold Davis claimed,\nplausibly enough, that Marxism became the most common ideological\nconviction among professionals in the decades following the\n1960s. Mari\u00e1tegui continues to loom large in characterizations\nof a distinctively Latin American form of Marxism. However, other\nimportant figures in academic Marxism emerged in the contemporary\nperiod, including Adolfo S\u00e1nchez V\u00e1zquez\n(1915\u20132011), of Spanish origin but working in Mexico, and the\nBrazilian Caio Prado Junior (1907\u20131990).\n\nThe popularity of the Marxism has made possible its\nwidespread institutionalization and its impact on virtually\nall active philosophical approaches in Latin America. To be sure, it is\nnot without its critics, many of whom charge that a philosophy that\naims to change the world is not philosophy at all, or that its scope is\nentirely too limited for an entire discipline. Nevertheless, it is not\nmuch of an exaggeration to say that, broadly speaking, Marxist themes\nare widely present in Latin American philosophy, even if philosophers\npursuing an explicitly Marxist philosophical research program remain in\nthe minority.\n\nCompared to Marxism, analytic philosophy was a late arrival to Latin\nAmerica. Owing to its technical and academic character, analytic\nphilosophy\u2019s initial influence was small.  Its historical connection\nwith Logical Positivism caused many to reject it because of its\nperceived commonality with nineteenth century positivism. However, in\na relatively short period of time, analytic philosophy became one of\nthe most forceful philosophical currents in Latin America. The\npublication of the journals Cr\u00edtica in Mexico,\nAn\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico in Argentina, and\nManuscrito in Brazil, the foundation of the Society of\nPhilosophical Analysis (SADAF) in Argentina, and the growth of\npublications of an analytic bent in journals of neutral philosophical\norientation, testify to the fact that philosophical analysis is now\nwell established in Latin\n America.[5]\n\nAn important dimension of this was the international uptake of some of\nthis work. Some analytic philosophers from Latin America attracted the\nattention of philosophers in Europe (particularly in England and\nGermany), the United States, and Canada. In addition, Latin American\nphilosophers who emigrated or made extended visits to these countries\nproduced important work. Three areas of contributions stand out: the\nphilosophy of human rights, legal theory, and logic. Eduardo Rabossi\n(1930\u20132005) work on human rights in Latin America attracted the\nattention of major English and American philosophers. Carlos Nino\u2019s\n(1943\u20131993) work in the philosophy of law, such as his\nconsensual theory of punishment, has been widely recognized as an\noriginal contribution to philosophy and jurisprudence (see Navarro in\nNuccetelli et. al., 2010). Finally, Latin American work in logic has\nbeen particularly fecund. Newton C. A. da Costa (b. 1929) has done\nconsiderable work on paraconsistent logic that has been the subject of\ninternational attention (see da Costa & Bueno 2010). Carlos Eduardo\nAlchourr\u00f3n\u2019s (1985) contributions to the AGM model of belief\nchange (named after Alchourr\u00f3n and his collaborators, Peter\nG\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson) has also been\ninfluential. Although its underpinnings were initially developed from\nAlchourr\u00f3n and Makinson\u2019s efforts at modeling changes in legal\ncodes, it is now the dominant formal framework for modeling belief\nrevision.\n\nThe growing influence of analytic philosophy in Latin America has not\ngone without criticism. It is not uncommon to hear that analytic\nphilosophers lack sensitivity to the pressing problems affecting Latin\nAmerica. Although this concern is hardly unique to analytic\nphilosophy, it is also sometimes merited. However, it is also true\nthat the rigorous argumentation, analysis of language, and use of\nsymbolic logic often constitute obstacles for outsiders to this\nmethodology. Nevertheless, Latin American analytic philosophers have\noften been involved in socially pertinent issues.  Indeed, both\nRabossi and Nino were involved in the politics of Argentina, serving\nin the government of President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn. Da Costa\nand Alchourr\u00f3n both applied their logical theories to law and a\nvariety of arguably \u201cpractical\u201d problems. Moreover, a variety of Latin\nAmerican analytic philosophers have been centrally preoccupied with\nethical and political questions. In the wake of the 1994 Zapatista\nrebellion, a number of prominent Mexican philosophers (including\nFernando Salmer\u00f3n and Luis Villoro) became involved in public\nand academic efforts at addressing the concerns of the Zapatistas.\n\nA third contemporary approach that merits special attention is the\nphilosophy of liberation . This autochthonous philosophical perspective\nstarted in the early 1970s with a group of Argentinian philosophers,\nmost notably Arturo Andr\u00e9s Roig (1922\u20132012), Horacio\nCerutti-Guldberg (b. 1950), and Enrique Dussel (b. 1934), with Dussel\nbeing primarily responsible for spreading the philosophy of liberation\noutside of Latin America. This philosophy shares some of its\nintellectual touchstones with the theology of liberation\u2014in\nparticular, indebtedness to dependency theory, as well as Catholic and\nMarxist ideas. Some of the most significant features of the various\nstrands of the movement include the aspiration for Latin American\nintellectual independence, an emphasis on economic autonomy as opposed\nto economic dependence, an emphasis on political regimes that are\nresponsive to the interest of the poor and indigenous populations, and\nin general, a concern to put Third World realities at the center of\nphilosophical concerns.\n\nThe international visibility of the philosophy of liberation was in\npart an unanticipated consequence of military repression in 1976\u201383 in\nArgentina. The founding figures of the philosophy of liberation went\ninto exile in various countries in Latin America. Although this early\ndiaspora created permanent splits in the\nmovement\u2014Cerutti-Guldberg urges that one speak of\n\u201cphilosophies of liberation\u201d\u2014its ideas spread\nthroughout the region.\n\nThe goal of intellectual independence, important to many varieties of\nthe philosophy of liberation, was not new with the philosophy of\nliberation. Strands of it can be found in the work of Ramos and others\nin the early parts of the 20th century. Other forerunners\ninclude the culturalist and historicist views of Leopoldo Zea, which\nemphasize the distinctiveness of Latin America and its history.\nMoreover, Augusto Salazar Bondy\u2019s (1925\u20131974) concern for\nintellectual authenticity, informed by dependency theory, paved the way\nfor important developments in the philosophy of liberation. However,\nthe distinctive feature of the philosophy of liberation is the degree\nto which it has developed the theme of liberation into a\nfar-reaching and systematic critique of European (and later, United\nStates) dominance in intellectual, economic, and social worlds. In\nparticular, philosophers of liberation charge that the intellectual and\neconomic frameworks of Europe and the United States are distinguished\n(currently and historically) by a disregard for or hostility to the\nconcerns of those outside the systems of power central to Europe and\nthe United States.\n\nThe philosophy of liberation has been subject to varied criticisms.\nThere is a rich tradition of disagreements internal to the movement\n(Cerutti-Guldberg 1983), and even those sympathetic with aspects of it\nhave charged that its proponents have failed to adequately accommodate\nconcerns about gender and sexuality (Schutte 1993), that it is\ninsufficiently attentive to the way identity categories work (Alcoff\n2000), and that despite its condemnation of Eurocentrism, it too is\nEurocentric (Vargas 2005).\n\nAlthough analytic philosophers (whether in Latin America or abroad)\nhave generally ignored the philosophy of liberation (or else dismissed\nit as unrigorous or unphilosophical), this philosophical perspective\nhas arguably had more impact outside of Latin America than any other\nLatin American philosophical development. In particular, Dussel has\nbeen in dialogue with a variety of philosophers in Europe (including\nApel, Ricoeur, and Habermas), and with Continental-influenced\nphilosophers in the United States and elsewhere (e.g., Rorty, Taylor,\nAlcoff, and\n Mendieta).[6]\n\nThe fourth philosophical current in the Latin American contemporary\nscene worth noting is not properly an orientation but a field of study:\nthe history of philosophy. Philosophical productivity in this area is\nworthy of note because its impact has been considerably among\nphilosophers of diverse persuasions. Before 1960, both the quantity and\nthe quality of studies on the history of philosophy published in Latin\nAmerica were often deplorable. Most works amounted to panegyrics, or\nmere paraphrases of texts not available in Spanish translation.\nMoreover, complete periods of the history of philosophy remained\noutside the scope of those studies. Since 1960, the situation has\nchanged substantially. There are now works that deal with practically\nevery period of the history of Western philosophy, and even Eastern\nphilosophy. Moreover, a good proportion of those studies are serious,\nrevealing knowledge of the pertinent languages and primary sources and\nadding a critical element without which the history of philosophy\nbecomes merely a gloss.\n\nA development that should be noted in this regard is the appearance of\njournals specializing in the history and thought of some historical\nperiods. For example, the last decade saw the appearance of journals\ndevoted to the study of the Middle Ages. Although not all these\njournals are strictly speaking philosophical, their publication is\nimportant, because it indicates the existence of the technical\nbackground doubtlessly necessary for serious historical research. It\nalso reveals the dedication of Latin American intellectual groups to\nwhat might be called \u201cpure research\u201d\u2014the search for\nknowledge for its own sake without consideration of its immediate\npractical applications.\n\nCollectively, these facts demonstrate a thematic dexterity in handling\nphilosophical ideas and arguments, a fact that led Mir\u00f3 Quesada\nto characterize the generations of Latin American philosophers in the\nperiod of maturity as \u2018technical\u2019. Philosophy has become a\nspecialized and professional discipline in Latin America. Indeed, since\n1960, Latin American philosophy has achieved a degree of maturity that\ncompares well with the state of the profession in Europe and the United\nStates.\n\nA final recent development in the United States merits mention in\nconnection with Latin American philosophy. There are now several\ngenerations of distinguished philosophers of Hispanic or Latin\nAmerican descent have worked in the United States and Canada,\ncontributing to traditional philosophical fields such as metaphysics,\nepistemology, and the history of philosophy. Among these are George\nSantayana (1863\u20131952), H\u00e9ctor-Neri Cata\u00f1eda\n(1924\u20131991), Mario Bunge (b. 1919), Ernesto Sosa (b. 1940),\nJorge J. E. Gracia (b. 1942), and Linda M. Alcoff, among others.\n\nIn the last two or three decades a new sense of Latino/a\nidentity in philosophy has grown among a group of philosophers who have\nundertaken work in areas related to Hispanic/Latino issues and have\nidentified themselves as Hispanics or Latinos/as. Among senior\nphilosophers who have been more clearly identified with this movement\nare two from the mentioned group (Alcoff and Gracia), as well as\nothers, such as J. Angelo Corlett, Susana Nuccetelli, Eduardo Mendieta,\nand Ofelia Schutte. These philosophers have contributed in particular\nto the discourse on issues of race, ethnicity, nationality, and\nfeminism, particularly through an analysis of ethnic, racial, and\ngender identity. One striking feature of much of this work is the\nremarkable degree to which it is explicitly informed by, or engaged\nwith, Latin American philosophy and its history.\n3. Problems and Topics\n\nThe third section of this entry focuses on topics that have been of\nparticular concern to Latin American and Latino/a philosophers and\nthat have interest today. These topics offer a general picture of the\nway these philosophers have approached philosophical problems.\nNevertheless, the issues canvassed here are, necessarily, an\ninadequate representation of the diverse issues and approaches taken\nup in Latin American \nphilosophy.[7]\n3.1 The Rights of Amerindians\n\nPerhaps the oldest distinctive philosophical problem of\npost-Columbian Latin American philosophy concerns the rights of\nindigenous populations in the Americas, and the duties of those\ngovernments that claimed jurisdiction over them. In the mid-sixteenth\ncentury, there were serious reservations on the part of a number of\nphilosophers, theologians, and legal theorists concerning the validity\nof the Spanish wars of conquest. Francisco Vitoria\u2019s developments\nof just war theory were among the earliest and most lasting\nphilosophical contributions to the topic. One of the most significant\nissues for sixteenth century thinkers in Spain was whether the\nindigenous populations were natural slaves or not. Whether the Spanish\nCrown could \u201cpacify\u201d the indigenous populations through\nviolence\u2014or whether more peaceful means of persuasion and\npolitical control were necessary\u2014was perceived to turn on whether\nthe indigenous populations were natural slaves. Relatedly, the outcome\nof this dispute had implications for the duties of the Spanish Crown to\nthe indigenous population, and correspondingly, the manner in which the\nindigenous populations ought to be treated (Cante\u00f1s 2010).\n\nThe issue reached its apex in a debate between Juan Gin\u00e9s\nSep\u00falveda, who defended the Spanish Crown\u2019s right to forcibly\nimpose its legal and religious practices on the indigenous populations\nof the Americas, and Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a Dominican friar\nand the first Bishop of Chiapas. Las Casas argued for a nuanced\nreading of the idea of natural slavery, while insisting on the full\nrationality of the indigenous populations, the need for peaceful\nevangelization of those populations, and for strict limits on the\nmeans used on behalf of Spanish interest in the Americas.  The results\nof the debate were inclusive\u2014Sep\u00falveda\u2019s work was\nsuppressed for a time, but Las Casas\u2019 position on the limits of\nSpanish use of force never became officially adopted by the Spanish\nCrown. Nevertheless, Las Casas continued to play a prominent role in\nthe Spanish Imperial court, tirelessly arguing on behalf of the native\npopulations. \n\nBetween the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, perhaps the dominant\nview of Latin American philosophers (a predominantly upper class group,\ngenerally of European ancestry) tended to regard indigenous populations\nas a \u201cproblem\u201d that needed to be overcome. By the late\nnineteenth century, amidst the considerable influence of Huxley and\nSocial Darwinism, several nations had policies of encouraging\nassimilation and \u201ccivilizing\u201d of the indigenous\npopulations, oftentimes in conjunction with encouraging more\nimmigration from Europe. For philosophers and policy-makers alike,\nconcern for preserving indigenous cultural practices, language, and\npolitical autonomy was typically negligible.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the concerns and nature of indigenous\npopulations received more varied evaluations from philosophers. For\nexample, Mari\u00e1tegui (1971) argued that indigenous Peruvians were\ncollectivists, \u201cnatural\u201d communists whose economic\ndifficulties were due in large part to the ownership, distribution and\nuse of lands in Peru. In the work of Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos\n(Vasconcelos/Gamio, 1926; Vasconcelos, 1997), indigenous populations in\nthe Americas were something to be assimilated along the way towards the\nformation of a \u201ccosmic\u201d race of mixed-people. That future\npopulation, a mixed-race people, would adapt the best cultural\npractices from around the world. In the work of Enrique Dussel (1995),\nthe encounter with the Amerindian populations are philosophically\nimportant for a variety of reasons, including the formation of Europe\nas an important conceptual category, the creation of modernity, and\nwhat the interactions between conquerors and conquered reveal about the\ndifficulty of understanding the interests and concerns of other\npeoples.\n\nIn the decade leading up to 1992 (the quincentenary of the Conquest)\nintellectual discussion of indigenous peoples and their interests grew\nconsiderably. By the 1990s, there was a flourishing of philosophical\nwork, especially but not exclusively in Mexico, on issues of ethnic\nidentity and political representation of indigenous populations. Luis\nVilloro, Fernando Salmer\u00f3n, and Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9 were\namong the prominent contributors to those discussions.\n\nIn the first part of the twenty first century, philosophical work on\naspects of a distinctly Latin American problematic concerning race and\npolitics\n proliferated.[8]\nFor more\non some of these matters, see the section below on the Identity of\nthe People.\n3.2 The Identity of the People\n\nOne of the most enduring challenges that the peoples of Latin\nAmerica have encountered in their history concerns the definition of\ntheir identity as a people. When Iberians arrived at the Americas,\nAmerindians were scattered throughout an enormous territory, divided by\nsubstantially different cultures, including numerous languages.\nIberians imposed a colonial unity on them, but the question of their\nidentity became critical, particularly after Africans were brought in\nto make up a labor deficit in the Caribbean and the East coast of South\nAmerica. How do all these peoples fit together as a people or a nation,\nand how are they to be conceived? The question of identity first\nsurfaced in the discussions about the rights of Amerindians, and later\nof African slaves, but extended to Iberian born versus American born\nEuropeans. \n\nThe issue became critical during the period of independence, when those\nwho fought against the Spanish domination in particular faced the task\nof forming nations of a population that was diverse in race, culture,\nand origin. Liberators such as Bol\u00edvar and Mart\u00ed\nunderstood well the challenge and rejected race in particular as a\ndivide among the different populations from which they sought to forge\nunified nations (see Aguilar Rivera and Schutte in Gracia, 2011). They\nproposed notions of national unity based on a mixed population under\nideals of political self-determination.\n\nThis emphasis changed after independence, in response to the pressing\nneeds for national development and progress. Positivist philosophers,\nsuch as Sarmiento, frequently advocated national policies that favored\nEuropean immigration as a way of undermining the racial and ethnic\ndifferences that divided the population (see Burke and Humphrey in\nGracia, 2011). These policies were often based on a negative view of\nboth Amerindians and Africans. Moreover, these policies failed to\nachieve the goals their proponents sought. The failure of positivist\nideas to help define the identity of the populations of the various\nnations gave rise to a reaction, most evident in the Mexican\nRevolution, to turn back to the Amerindian past as a way to find a\nunity that would make nations of the diverse population. Notions of\nboth national and Latin American unity were proposed on various grounds\nat this time. For some, as is the case with Vasconcelos, the unity is\nracial, a result of the mixing of the various races that constitute the\nLatin American populations (see von Vacano in Gracia, 2011). For\nothers\u2014such as Zea\u2014the cultural unity of these populations\nprovided the basis of national or Latin American identity (see Oliver\nin Gracia, 2011).\n\nThe efforts to find an effective way to define the identity of Latin\nAmericans has continued unabated in Latin America, and has found\nfertile ground in the work of Latino/a philosophers working in the\nUnited States. Efforts to define the racial, ethnic and national\nboundaries of the identity of Latin Americans and of Latinos/as in the\nUnited States have been pursued by such authors as Alcoff, Corlett, and\nGracia (see Mill\u00e1n and Vel\u00e1squez in Gracia, 2011).\n3.3 Philosophical Anthropology\nA corner stone of Latin American positivism was a scientific\nconception of human beings that was cashed out in psychological terms\nin order to solve the mind-body problem. Antipositivists attacked this\nconception of personhood, and set out to develop a philosophical\nanthropology that would provide an appealing alternative to the\npositivist conception of persons. Practically every established\nphilosopher engaged in this project. Three major approaches emerged: a\nvitalistic anthropology, an anthropology of the spirit, and various\nexistentialist/Marxist alternatives.\nThe group of philosophers who adopted some form of vitalism were\nstrongly influenced by Bergson. On early versions of this approach, a\npositivist anthropology was rejected on grounds that it has no place\nfor freedom. Among the most important early proponents of this view\nwere Vaz Ferreira (Uruguay), Alejandro De\u00fastua (Peru), Antonio\nCaso (Mexico), Enrique Molina (Chile) and Alejandro Korn\n(Argentina). In the work of both Caso and Vaconcelos, the distinctive\ncharacter of human beings is consciousness of a sort that is\npurportedly at odds with deterministic or mechanistic views of the\nworld.\nThe work of these authors and the visit of the popular Spanish\nphilosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, opened Latin American\nphilosophical anthropology to the influence of a new wave of European\nphilosophers. In particular, Husserl, Dilthey, Scheler, and Hartman\ngave rise to a different approach within philosophical anthropology:\nthe anthropology of the spirit. Among the most important proponents of\nthis view were Samuel Ramos (Mexico), Francisco Romero Argentina),\nRisieri Frondizi (Argentina), Francisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada (Peru),\nand Leopoldo Zea (Mexico). For Ramos, feeling, not reason, is the\ncentral feature of humanity. For Romero, the characteristic that\nidentifies humans is duality; for Mir\u00f3 Quesada, the fundamental\nquestion is metaphysical, namely, \u201cWhat is human?\u201d Doubts\nabout the possibility of finding an adequate theory tended to turn the\nchallenge into an epistemic rather than metaphysical matter.\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Existentialism gained a foothold\namong philosophers in Latin American. Among the most important Latin\nAmerican existentialists/Marxists are Carlos Astrada (Argentina) and\nVicente Ferreira da Silva (Brazil), who were particularly influenced\nby Heidegger. Both were concerned with whether there is such a thing\nas a human essence. Astrada argues that there is not: Humans do not\nhave a determinate essence, and that constitutes their fundamental\nproblem. In Mexico, a variety of prominent philosophers--members of\nthe Hyperion Group--briefly took up existentialist themes, abandoning\nthem with a few short years (S\u00e1nchez 2016).\n3.4 Latin America\u2019s Philosophical Identity\n\nThe notion of Latin American philosophy has been a subject of heated\ncontroversy for most of the twentieth century. The controversy has\nseveral foci. Five of the most hotly debated ones are existence,\nidentity, characteristics, originality, and authenticity. Is there such\na thing as Latin American philosophy? In what does its identity\nconsist? Does it have any distinguishing marks? Is it original? And is\nit authentic?\n\nThe disagreements in the answers given to these questions are deep.\nThere are at least four ways of looking at them depending on the\napproach used: universalist, culturalist, critical, and ethnic. The\nuniversalist views philosophy as a universal discipline akin to\nscience. Consequently, the fundamental issue for universalists turns on\nwhether Latin Americans have been able to produce the kind of universal\ndiscipline that one expects when one has science as a model. Its\nproblems are common to all humans, its method is also common, and its\nconclusions are supposed to be true, regardless of particular\ncircumstances. Most universalists, such as Frondizi, see Latin\nAmerican philosophy as largely a failure in this respect.\n\nThe culturalist thinks that truth is always perspectival, dependent on\na point of view. The method to acquire truth is always dependent\non a cultural context. Philosophy is a historical, non-scientific\nenterprise concerned with the elaboration of a general point of view\nfrom a certain personal or cultural perspective. Accordingly, the\nculturalist can allow for the existence of Latin American philosophy\ninsofar as Latin Americans have engaged in developing views from their\nperspective as individuals or as Latin Americans, and using whatever\nmeans they have found appropriate to do so. Whether they are original\nor authentic, or have produced a kind of scientific philosophy, are\nirrelevant matters. This is Leopoldo Zea\u2019s position (see Zea in\nGracia 1988\u201389).\n\nThe critical approach considers philosophy a result of social\nconditions, and closely related to those conditions. Some conditions\nare conducive to the production of philosophy, or what is sometimes\ncalled authentic philosophy, whereas others are not. Unfortunately,\nproponents of this position (e.g., Salazar Bondy, 1969) have typically\nseen Latin American philosophy as a failure in this respect because of\nthe conditions operative in the region. According to them, Latin\nAmerican philosophy is, and will continue to be, inauthentic and\ntherefore not true philosophy, as long as Latin American philosophers\ncontinue to emulate the views of philosophers from the developed\nworld. \n\nThe ethnic approach argues that Latin American philosophy needs to be\nunderstood as the philosophy produced by the Latin American people. The\nnotion of Latin Americans as a people is the key to understanding both\nhow Latin American philosophy has unity in diversity. It is one because\nan ethnic group has produced it, but it differs from place to place and\nacross time because different historical circumstances prompt the\npeople that produce it to address different problems and to adopt\ndifferent perspectives and methods. This approach seeks to understand\nhow Latin American philosophy can be universal, particular, and\nauthentic, (see Gracia, 2008, ch 7).\n\nQuestions concerning the notion of Latin American philosophy were first\nraised in Latin America in the nineteenth century. However, it was not\nuntil the end of the first half of the twentieth century that they were\nseriously explored, in particular, by Zea and Frondizi. Since then,\nthis topic has been a constant source of discussion and controversy.\nIndeed, it is perhaps the most discussed subject matter within Latin\nAmerican philosophy.\n3.4 Feminist Philosophy\n\nSince at least the 19th century, feminist academic work in Latin\nAmerica has had a complicated and generally ambivalent relationship\nwith academic and philosophical work more generally (Fornet-Bentacourt,\n2009). For example, after Independence, women were granted greater\naccess to education but recognizably feminist concerns tended to be\nmostly peripheral to academic and philosophical discussion. This\nhistory has led some to argue that feminist philosophy should be\ncentered not in philosophy but in a diverse collection of academic\nfields and (often activist) social practices. For example, Ofelia\nSchutte (2011) has maintained that feminist philosophy requires a home\nin a broader Latin American feminist theory and not in the\ndiscipline of philosophy in Latin America because \u201cfeminism is\ntoo new there to be able to effectively transform centuries of\nmasculine intellectual dominance in philosophy\u201d (p. 784).\n\nDespite feminist philosophy\u2019s ongoing ambivalent relationship\nwith academic philosophy in Latin America, there has nevertheless been\na recurring strand of academic philosophical work in an identifiable\nfeminist vein since the end of the 19th century (Oliver 2007, p. 32).\nFor example, Uruguayan philosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreria (1871\u20131958) gave\na series of lectures in 1917 on feminism, which were later published in\n1935 under the title Sobre feminismo [On\nFeminism]. Mexican philosopher Graciela Hierro (1928\u20132003)\npublished extensively on feminist ethics and the role of feminism in\npublic and academic spaces. Moreover, starting in the 1980s there has\nbeen considerable growth in the field, with important work by such\nfigures Mar\u00eda P\u00eda Lara, Mar\u00eda Luisa\nFemen\u00edas, and Ofelia Schutte. A good deal of recent feminist\nphilosophy has been transnational in its sources, explicitly drawing on\nacademic philosophy in the Americas and Continental Europe, but also\ndrawing from the history of feminist activism in Latin America, social\nscience research, and personal narratives.\n\nThe diversity of interests and positions of Latin American feminists\nmakes it difficult to provide a simple but accurate characterization of\nthe field. It is sometimes held that, in comparison to U.S. forms of\nfeminist thought, Latin American feminism has had a somewhat greater\ninterest in the critical analysis of families, class, and ethnicity\n(Schutte and Femen\u00edas 2010, p. 407\u20139). Consistent with the wider\nLatin American philosophical tradition\u2019s impulse to self-critical\nreflexiveness about its tradition, it is perhaps fair to say that Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy has been particularly reflexive or\nself-critical about what it means to pursue feminist philosophy in\nLatin America. For example, feminist philosophers have emphasized the\nneed to recognize that academic philosophers, wherever they live, enjoy\na cultural privilege that may put them at some distance from the living\nconditions of most women in Latin America (Femen\u00edas and Oliver,\n2007, p. xi). Given such a model of \u201cepistemic privilege\u201d\nwhere, as a matter of actual social practices, the experiences and\ncategories of some tend to be valued over others, a number of feminist\nphilosophers have thought feminist philosophers have a special reason\nto consider the ways in which feminist goals are conceptualized and\nrepresented in popular and academic discourse (Schutte 2011, p.\n785).\n\nAlthough the future of feminist philosophy in Latin America remains\nunclear, it seems rather likely that a range of its prominent\nconcerns\u2014including activist philosophy, concerns for epistemic\nand cultural privilege, and reliance on interdisciplinary interpretive\nframeworks will survive in the interests of a range of academic\ncontexts. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abell\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Luis, 1967, <em>Filosof\u00eda\nEspa\u00f1ola en Am\u00e9rica</em>, Madrid: Guadarrama.", "Alchourr\u00f3n, C.E., P.
