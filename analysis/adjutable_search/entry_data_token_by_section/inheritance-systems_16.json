    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || Scaffolding\n4.2 Scaffolding\n\nWilliam Wimsatt and James Griesemer (2007) discuss multi-channel\ninheritance using the notion of scaffolding from\ndevelopmental psychology. Scaffolding refers to structures and\nfunctional processes that provide a supporting framework for\ndevelopment (see Caporael et al. 2013). Traits inherited through one\ninheritance system can provide scaffolding for other inheritance\nsystems. Wimsatt and Griesemer suggest that if the flow of information\nmust be scaffolded in such a way that carriers develop in appropriate\nconditions in order to assimilate, use, and carry the information,\nthen the scaffolding must propagate or persist alongside the\ninformation in the channel \u2014 leading to multi-channel\ninheritance (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007: 286). They suggest that\nthis applies to any information that is sufficiently complex. As a\nconsequence it applies essentially to all biological and cultural\nphenomena.\n\nA related notion is suggested by Peter Godfrey-Smith, who defines\nscaffolded reproducers as \u201centities which get\nreproduced as part of the reproduction of some larger unit (a simple\nreproducer), or that are reproduced by some other entity\u201d\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 88). This notion is more restricted than\nWimsatt\u2019s and Griesemer\u2019s appeal to scaffolding, as it\nonly refers to scaffolding of reproduction. Godfrey-Smith classifies\ngenes as scaffolded reproducers since they rely on cellular machinery\nfor their reproduction (p. 130).\n",
