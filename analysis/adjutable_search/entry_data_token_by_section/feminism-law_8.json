Marriage, Reproductive Rights, and Commodification of the Body\n\nNowhere than in marriage is the legal bias towards the status quo more\napparent. Yet in many jurisdictions across the globe, same sex\nmarriage is now legally recognized. The U.S. Supreme Court held in\n Obergefell v. Hodges\n that prohibitions of same sex marriage violate constitutional\nguarantees of due process and equal protection (576 U.S. ___ (2015)).\nLiberal feminists and many others have hailed this decision as a\nsignificant victory. Nonetheless, concerns remain about the\ndecision\u2019s scope. In many jurisdictions, a couple\u2019s\nmarriage may be protected but they will not be protected against\ndecisions of their employer to fire them or of their landlord to evict\nthem. It is also unclear whether people will be able to refuse them\nservices on religious grounds; the Supreme Court will decide this\nissue during its 2017-2018 term.\n\nStill further critics argue that extension of marriage to same sex\ncouples merely entrenches a fundamentally inegalitarian relationship.\nThe view that equality requires extending the institution of marriage\nto same-sex partners, if it is to be available to opposite-sex\npartners, is a liberal view. In the eyes of critics of liberal\nmarriage, marriage itself must be rethought, if gendered inequalities\nare to be overcome (Brake 2014). Valorizing marriage also potentially\nharms those whose relationships take other, less valued forms, such as\nasexual relationships, polyamorous relationships, or care networks\n(Brake 2014). To the extent that marriage institutionalizes\nproblematic forms of dominance, it would seem a mistake to extend it\nat all\u2014or at least to extend it without significant substantive\nchanges in the institution (Kim 2010). Assimilationist paradigms both\nrecognize the pain of exclusion but fail to problematize the role\nmarriage plays in institutionalizing inequality (Robson 2002).\n\nReproductive autonomy is another particularly telling example of the\nongoing force of gender norms. Feminists plausibly contend that women\ncannot be free and equal citizens if they do not control their own\nbodies. Much feminist research has detailed the history and debated\nthe implications of current laws and policies that have allowed or\nconstrained women\u2019s reproductive freedom (see, e.g., Peach 2002;\nRhode 1997). Paternalistic attitudes towards women have been\nidentified as shaping the structure of the Supreme Court\u2019s\n Roe v. Wade\n (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) decision and subsequent efforts by states to\nregulate or restrict abortion in the name of protecting women\u2019s\nhealth (Appleton 2011; Laufer-Ukeles 2011). Even feminists who\npersonally oppose abortion, or who are critical of some abortions\n(e.g., those evidencing disability discrimination) typically argue\nthat abortion should still be legal. Some argue that controlling\none\u2019s own body is a necessary condition for any other freedom\n(see, e.g., Peach 2002; Estrich 2001; Rhode 1997; Olsen 1993). Yet\ntogether with paternalistic attitudes about the need to protect women\nfrom their emotionality and irrationality in the reproductive process,\ntraditional views of women\u2019s reproductive roles have shaped law\nand policy. Laws permitting abortion remain under attack; many U.S.\njurisdictions now have laws targeting abortion providers (TRAP laws),\nalthough in\n Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt\n (579 U.S. ___ (2016)) the U.S. Supreme Court struck down\nTexas\u2019s TRAP laws as impermissibly burdening women\u2019s\nrights without providing corresponding benefit for women\u2019s\nhealth. Feminists point out that analyses of whether such statutes\nplace undue burdens on women\u2019s rights in terms of formal legal\nbarriers manifest legal formalism that conceals the reality of ongoing\noppression or inequality of opportunity. The Hellerstedt\ndecision rejected such formalism in favor of an analysis of the actual\nbenefits and burdens of the Texas laws by a slim 5\u20133 majority\nafter Justice Scalia\u2019s death, but with the addition of Justice\nGorsuch one further appointment to the Court could tip this\nbalance.\n\nThe abortion issue also raises questions about how law should deal\nwith issues of deep moral disagreement within society. In the United\nStates, the protection of women\u2019s reproductive freedom from\nrestriction by government was initially based on the right to privacy\nand is now understood in terms of liberty. First applied to\nreproduction in the 1965 case of\n Griswold v. Connecticut\n (381 US 479 (1965)), the constitutional right to privacy was\nunderstood to protect individuals from state interference with certain\ndecisions affecting their private lives, particularly decisions about\nmarriage, family, sexual intimacy, and procreation. Griswold\nwas jurisprudentially controversial because the right to privacy is\nnot explicitly stated in the Constitution. Feminists have argued that\noriginalist approaches to constitutional interpretation that would\nrestrict constitutional meaning to the understandings in place at the\ntime constitutional provisions were adopted are jurisprudentially\nproblematic in their entrenchment of the norms of the patriarchy of\nthe day (e.g. Case 2014) More recent decisions about abortion rights\nhave been framed in terms of fundamental liberties that may not be\nunduly burdened (e.g.,\n Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\n (505 U.S. 833 (1992))).\n\nOn the other side of the abortion debate from women\u2019s\nreproductive liberty is the question of the fetus. Roe v.\nWade\u2019s extension of the right to privacy to a woman\u2019s\ndecision to terminate a pregnancy by elective abortion set off a\nfirestorm of protest and debate that remains robust over forty years\nlater. Even the language used to state the issues is contested.\nLabeling the fetus a \u201cpre-born infant\u201d or a\n\u201cperson\u201d\u2014as some of the attempts to pass so-called\npersonhood amendments have tried to do\u2014begs exactly the question\nof what if any moral claims the fetus might have (e.g. Francis, ed.\n2017, part IV). Many feminists hold nuanced views on these questions.\nFor example, disability rights feminists may argue that while abortion\nrights should be protected, abortion decisions that are based on\ninadequate or biased information about disabilities are problematic.\nBlack feminists may interrogate whether abortion policies or support\nfor women and families are racially biased, implicitly or even\nexplicitly. Many feminists also agree that the state has an interest\nin protecting the fetus to the extent that it will be born\nalive\u2014that is, that the state has an interest in protecting\ncontinuing pregnancies against fetal harm, including harm inflicted by\nthe pregnant woman herself\u2014although feminists also recognize\nthat this interest must not be seen to legitimize problematic coercive\nor paternalistic interferences with pregnant women\u2019s\nliberty.\n\nIn its more recent cases the US Supreme Court has held that the state\ninterest in protecting potential life may begin at the moment of\nconception even though the mother\u2019s interest outweighs it\n (Planned Parenthood v. Casey,\n 505 US 833 (1992)). The Court\u2019s continuing jurisprudence bears\nout initial feminist concerns that saw this formulation as the tip of\na wedge (e.g. Peach 2002). For example, the 2007 decision of\n Gonzales v. Carhart\n (550 U.S. 124 (2007)) upheld the constitutionality of the Partial\nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The Act bans what it terms partial\nbirth abortion\u2014language freighted with the imagery of a\nlive-born person\u2014except when necessary to save the life of the\nmother. In the decision, the Court weighed substantial state interests\nin protecting the health of the mother and in preserving fetal life as\ninterests present all along during pregnancy against the burden placed\non the woman\u2019s right of reproductive liberty. Opponents of the\nAct claimed that its partial birth label concealed the extent of its\nrestriction on pre-viability abortion choices. The decision has\nspurred state efforts to enact the TRAP laws described above. These\nstate statutes have placed increasing burdens on abortion providers;\nmany have closed and abortion is practically unavailable for women in\nmany areas of the United States despite the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. \n\nFeminists also criticize the US Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in\nsupport of the state interest in protecting potential life. One\nconcern is the scope of the supposed interest, such as whether it\nextends to the sale or distribution of contraceptive devices that\nprevent implantation after fertilization, or that even are claimed to\ndo so in rare cases. Another concern is how any interest in protecting\nfetal life from the moment of conception can be supported in a\nsecular, liberal state. If the answer is that there is some special\nstatus accorded to the human embryo or fertilized egg that requires\nits protection from the moment it is fertilized, feminists argue, this\nis best characterized as a religious view. If so, religious beliefs\nare being imported into state laws and the US Constitution that have a\ndisproportionate impact upon women. The vague references to protecting\npotential life, so central to all the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions\non this complex issue, obscure these critical implications and are\nproblematic on many grounds. Even in a modern, secular, liberal state\nthat is explicitly committed to individual freedom, women\u2019s\nfundamental liberties can be obscured and mystified by language and\naction that uphold and impose longstanding restrictive modes of\nthought and custom that may not always be recognized as religious in\norigin but that have no other plausible explanation. Such restrictions\nare often expressed in and defended by the use of religious language\n(such as sacred-ness or sanctity) that is applied to controversial\nreligious doctrines as though they were settled, basic and\nuncontroversial. \n\nSome societies explicitly incorporate religious law into their legal\nsystems, operate dual systems, or are expressly theocratic. Others are\nsecular but faced with strong customary elements. To some extent all\nsocieties face the problem of customary resistance to reform, as\nillustrated by the abortion debates in the United States. In nations\nwith strong religious or customary influences on law, feminists may\nface difficult issues of how to interpret religious law into language\nmore favorable to women\u2019s freedom, how to call upon\ninternational human rights norms, and/or how to interpret the language\nof customary law in a way that enables it to absorb feminist reforms\nover time (Quriashi 2011). This is a special case of the general\nproblem of entrenchment. It may involve several different ways of\nchallenging the religious establishment on matters of interpretation\nthat are (traditionally) considered settled or fundamental. Some\ncustomary doctrines arguably have no particular basis in religious\ntexts, although they are treated as though they do (e.g., when life\nbegins). Furthermore, some doctrines have a very general religious\nbasis (e.g., women should be modest) but are interpreted to require\nfar more severe or detailed customs (e.g., women must be entirely\ncovered whenever they are in public). A further strategy points out\nthat all religious interpretation is selective, so it must be\ndetermined whether a passage of text should be considered basic and\neternal, or whether it was simply a reflection of particular customs\nor attitudes relevant to a particular time in history (e.g., adultery\nand blasphemy are capital offenses). Some innovative work has been\ndone on these issues, for example, by exploring the distinction\nbetween shari\u2019a (eternal) law and fiqh (custom\nor jurisprudence) in Islam, and by considering the interplay of dual\nsystems (Quriashi 2011; Mir-Hosseini 2005; Reed & Pollitt 2002;\nJeffrey & Basu 1998). These approaches emphasize interpretive\nmethods; a further approach calls on the separation between law and\nmorality endorsed by legal positivism to disentangle traditionalist\nmoral beliefs from the requirements of law.\n\nSince the adoption under the Affordable Care Act of the requirement\nthat contraception methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration be included in group health plans without cost-sharing,\nmany have voiced religious objections to providing this coverage.\nFeminists argue that contraceptive use declines with costs and that\nready access to contraception is an important part of women\u2019s\nability to control their bodies. They also point out how the burdens\nof contraception and contraceptive failure fall on women rather than\nmen. Objectors contend that contraception should be a matter of\nprivate choice rather than a government requirement, that at least\nsome contraceptives are problematic as abortifacients (although this\ncontention is contested for contraceptive methods such as the\nintrauterine device), and that rights of conscientious objection\nshould be respected. Here, too, philosophy of law considers the role\nof law in resolving these disputes.\n\nCommodification of the body especially in reproduction is a topic of\nextensive discussion among feminist philosophers of law. As\nreproductive technologies have become increasingly sophisticated,\npressures for women to sell their oocytes or to be paid to bear\nchildren for others have mounted. Some liberal theorists urge that if\npaid sex, paid surrogacy, paid gamete donation, and the like can be\nachieved voluntarily, these are legitimate forms of economic\nopportunity. To prohibit them is to deprive some\npeople\u2014primarily women\u2014of opportunities that might be of\nvalue to them and to deprive the biologically and the socially\ninfertile of the ability to form families. Indeed, if all forms of\nsexuality, including marriage, were viewed on the model of economic\nrelationships, some argue, equality for women would be furthered \n(Ertman 2001).  Feminists critical of this liberal position argue\nthat commodification may misperceive the nature of the body in human\nlife by understanding it as the subject of property\u2014despite the\nall-too-apparent reality that alternatives to commodification may be\nworse (Radin 1996). Relatedly, some contend that commodification of\nthe body in practices such as paid surrogacy is inherently\nexploitative (Dickenson 2007).\n\nMany liberal feminists, too, are opposed to a variety of\ncommodification practices. Some argue that abolition of even voluntary\nprostitution is necessary to protect victims of sex trafficking, as\nlegalized prostitution may mask continued flourishing of trafficking\nin its shadow (Dempsey 2010). Others are concerned about the\npossibility of genuinely voluntary consent in circumstances of poverty\nor limited opportunities for many women. Several countries that have\nlegalized prostitution, such as the Netherlands and Germany, have\nengaged in vigorous debates about whether legal prostitution is a\nvoluntarily chosen occupation for many, whether legalization has\nbettered the circumstances for prostitutes, and whether legalization\nhas been coupled with enhanced enforcement of laws against sex\ntrafficking or other sex crimes. Other countries, such as Sweden, have\nbanned prostitution altogether, spurred by feminist critique of the\npractice. \n\nRelated to the concerns about commodification of the body are\ncriticisms of what are seen as questionable technological imperatives,\neven apart from the economic incentives that may be driving them. Some\nfeminists contend that practices such as pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis, transplants of mitochondrial DNA, or gene editing are far\nriskier both physiologically and ethically than proponents admit (e.g.\nDe Melo-Martin 2016). These feminists point out that long-term\nevidence of safety is lacking and that there may be unanticipated\ndeleterious consequences of these techniques. These practices may\nportend far-reaching changes in our understanding of individual\nidentity and what it is to be human. Whether law in the form of\nprohibitions or regulations should be imposed on these practices, or\nwhether they are a matter for individuals to decide for themselves, is\ndeeply contested. Some liberal feminists, for example, argue that\nindividual\u2019s choices about the reproductive risks they are\nwilling to take should be respected, especially when they are striving\nto avoid disease in their potential offspring.\n\nAn ongoing theme in all these debates about marriage, reproduction,\nand the body has been the extent to which these issues should be\nunderstood in terms of protecting liberty, and how much they should be\nunderstood in terms of achieving equality. For liberal feminists, the\nextent to which women may exercise uncoerced choice over their bodies\nand their private lives is key. If women choose marriages in which\nthey are dependent economically, make choices about how many children\nthey will have, and elect to spend their lives in uncompensated\ndomestic labor, those decisions should be respected as long as they\nare not coerced. For other feminists, what is critical is the extent\nto which even apparently free choices are exercised against a backdrop\nof economic inequality or patriarchal dominance. For these feminists,\neconomic dependency and norms of dominance call into question the\npossibility of genuinely free choice.\n",
