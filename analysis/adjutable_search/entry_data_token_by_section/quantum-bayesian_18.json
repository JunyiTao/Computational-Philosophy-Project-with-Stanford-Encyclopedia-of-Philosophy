    "main_text": "Pragmatist Views || Healey\n4.3 Healey\n\nIn recent work, Healey (2012a,b, 2017a,b, 2020) has also taken what he\ncalls a pragmatist approach to quantum theory. He contrasts this with\ninterpretations that attempt to say what the world would (or could) be\nlike if quantum theory were true of it. On his approach quantum states\nare objective, though a true quantum state assignment does not\ndescribe or represent the condition or behavior of a physical system.\nBut quantum states are relational: Different agents may correctly and\nconsistently assign different quantum states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances\u2014not because these represent their subjective\npersonal beliefs, but because each agent has access to different\nobjective information backing these (superficially conflicting) state\nassignments. Each such assignment may be said to correctly represent\nobjective probabilistic relations between its backing conditions and\nclaims about values of magnitudes.\n\nOn this approach, quantum theory is not about agents or their states\nof belief: and nor does it (directly) describe the physical world. It\nis a source of objectively good advice about how to describe\nthe world and what to believe about it as so described. This advice is\ntailored to meet the needs of physically situated, and hence\ninformationally-deprived, agents like us. It is good because the\nphysical world manifests regular statistical patterns the right Born\nprobabilities help a situated agent to predict and explain. But the\nadvice is available even with no agents in a position to benefit from\nit: there are quantum states and Born probabilities in possible worlds\nwith no agents.\n\nBorn probabilities are neither credences nor frequencies. They are\nobjective because they are authoritative. Setting credences equal to\nBorn probabilities derived from the correct quantum state for one in\nthat physical situation is a wise epistemic policy for any agent in a\nworld like ours. Born probabilities are equally objective even when\nthey differ more radically from Lewis\u2019s (1986) chances because\nthey are based on more (physically) limited information.\n\nHealey\u2019s approach is pragmatist in several respects. It\nprioritizes use over representation in its general approach to quantum\ntheory; its account of probability and causation is pragmatist, in\nquantum theory and elsewhere; and it rests on a theory of content that\nBrandom (2000) calls inferentialist pragmatism. While not endorsing\nany pragmatist identification of truth with \u201cwhat works\u201d,\nin its deflationary approach to truth and representation it follows\nthe contemporary pragmatist Huw Price (2003, 2011). Healey (2020)\nargues for a conception of realism according to which this pragmatist\napproach is realist rather than anti-realist.\n4.3.1 Contrasts with QBism\n\nIndependently of similar suggestions by Bacciagaluppi (2014) and\nStairs (2011), Healey co-opts some QBist strategies for dissolving the\nmeasurement problem and removing worries about non-locality, while\nrejecting the accompanying subjectivism about quantum states, Born\nprobabilities, and measurement outcomes.\n\nWhile QBists take quantum state assignments to be subject only to the\ndemand that an agent\u2019s degrees of belief be coherent and conform\nto Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), Healey takes these to be answerable to\nthe statistics of objective events, including (but not restricted to)\noutcomes of quantum measurements. This makes the objective existence\nof quantum states independent of that of agents even though their main\nfunction is as a source of good advice to any agents there happen to\nbe. And it makes quantum states relative, not to the epistemic\nsituation of actual agents, but to the physical situation of actual\nand merely hypothetical agents.\n\nWhile QBists follow de Finetti in taking all probabilities to be\ncredences of actual agents, Healey\u2019s pragmatist takes\nprobabilities to exist independently of the existence of agents but\nnot to be physical propensities or frequencies, nor even to supervene\non Lewis\u2019s Humean mosaic (see entry on\n David Lewis\n \u00a75). There are probabilities insofar as probability statements\nare objectively true, which they may be when sensitive to though not\ndetermined by physical facts.\n\nThere is no measurement problem since reassignment of quantum state on\nmeasurement is not a physical process but corresponds to\nrelativization of that state to a different physical situation from\nwhich additional information has become physically accessible to a\nhypothetical agent so situated.\n\nThere is no instantaneous action at a distance in a quantum world,\ndespite the probabilistic counterfactual dependencies between\nspace-like separated events such as (macroscopic) outcomes of\nmeasurements confirming violation of Bell inequalities. On a\npragmatist approach, these dependencies admit no conceptual\npossibility of intervention on one outcome that would alter (any\nrelevant probability of) the other. So there is no instantaneous\nnon-local influence, in conformity to Einstein\u2019s principle of\nlocal action.\n4.3.2 Decoherence and Content\n\nOn Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach, an application of the Born rule\ndirectly specifies probabilities for claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes (dynamical variables of classical physics as well\nas new variables such as strangeness and color): it does not\nexplicitly specify probabilities for measurement outcomes. But the\nBorn rule is legitimately applied only to claims with sufficiently\nwell-defined content. The content of a claim about the value of a\nphysical magnitude on a system depends on how the system interacts\nwith its environment. Quantum theory may be used to model such\ninteraction. Only if a system\u2019s quantum state is then stably\ndecohered in some basis (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics)\n do claims about the value of the associated \u201cpointer\nmagnitude\u201d acquire a sufficiently well-defined content to\nlicense application of the Born rule to them. Because of this\nrestriction on its legitimate application, the Born rule may be\nconsistently applied to claims of this form (not just to claims about\nthe outcomes of measurements) without running afoul of no-go results\nsuch as that of Kochen and Specker (see entry on\n the Kochen-Specker theorem).\n\nWhat endows a claim (e.g., about the value of a magnitude) with\ncontent is the web of inferences in which it is located. Such a claim\nhas a well-defined content if many reliable inferences link it to\nother claims with well-defined content. It is the nature of a\nsystem\u2019s interaction with its environment that determines which\ninferences to and from a magnitude claim about it are reliable.\nQuantum decoherence and inferentialist pragmatism work together here\nto make objective sense of the Born rule with no need to mention\nmeasurement: Though of course at some stage all actual measurements do\ninvolve interactions with an environment well modeled by quantum\ndecoherence.\n\nContra to Mermin\u2019s view (see\n \u00a71.6),\n concepts are not invented by each of us to make his or her experience\nmore intelligible. They acquire content from the social practice of\nlinguistic communication about a physical world that perception\nrepresents (to humans as well as organisms with no capacity for\nlanguage) as independently existing.\n4.3.3 Objections and Replies\n\nJansson (2020) challenges the claim of Healey\u2019s pragmatist\napproach to offer objective explanations of phenomena, while\nacknowledging the attractions of a position that seeks to occupy the\nmiddle ground between explanation seeking realism and prediction\nfocused instrumentalism. She concludes (2020: 165) that\n\n\nMany explanations according to this approach to quantum theory seem to\nat least partially black-box crucial information about the physical\nground for the appropriate assignment of quantum states or\napplications of the Born rule. \u2026neither quantum states nor the\nBorn rule can act as initial explanatory input. While this is a\nserious cost, it is not clear that a pragmatist approach to quantum\ntheory has to resist this conclusion.\n\n\nOne taking Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach to quantum theory could\nreply as follows (see Healey 2020, \u00a77.7). The primary target of\nan explanatory application of quantum theory is not a collection of\nevents but a probabilistic phenomenon they manifest. A probabilistic\nphenomenon is a probabilistic data model of a statistical regularity.\nOne explains the phenomenon by demonstrating how the probabilities of\nthe model are a consequence of the Born rule, as applied to events\nthat manifest the regularity. Since the explanandum is not\nitself a physical condition, it is inappropriate to demand a physical\nexplanans (such as a physically real quantum state). But the\ndemonstration is explanatory only if each event manifesting the\nregularity itself depended on whatever physical conditions obtained,\nincluding whatever conditions backed assignment of the quantum state\ninput to the Born rule. One can have good evidence for such backing\nconditions while unable to specify exactly what they are. The more\ncomplete the description of the physical conditions on which each\nevent manifesting the regularity depended, the better the explanation\nof the probabilistic phenomenon they manifest.\n\nLewis (2020) raises concerns about Healey\u2019s application of\ninferentialist pragmatism to the content of claims in quantum theory\nand its applications. His first worry concerns the distinction between\nthe prescriptive content of quantum claims (about the quantum state,\nfor example) and descriptive non-quantum claims about magnitudes like\nposition and energy.\n\nBut, as he notes, a claim\u2019s having a distinctive prescriptive\nfunction does not show that it has no representational content. A\npragmatist could reply that a quantum state represents something other\nthan an \u201celement of physical reality\u201d while functioning to\nprescribe credences about such elements: Healey (2017a) suggests that\na quantum state represents probabilistic relations between them.\n\nLewis\u2019s second worry is that Healey\u2019s position fails to\nadequately take into account the role of conditional or counterfactual\ninferences in conferring content both on quantum, and on non-quantum\nmagnitude, claims. Through its prescriptive role in applications of\nthe Born rule, Lewis maintains, a claim about a quantum state or a\nmagnitude implies many counterfactual probabilistic claims about\nmagnitudes. For an inferentialist then, quantum claims and magnitude\nclaims derive content from the corresponding inferences.\n\nOn Healey\u2019s (2017, pp. 208\u2013210) pragmatist approach, a\nclaim assigning a quantum state does derive much of its content from\ninferences involving counterfactuals. The inference is to a\ncounterfactual whose antecedent is (or supervenes on) a claim about\nmagnitudes, and whose consequent specifies a probability as great as\n1 for a different magnitude claim that is meaningful\nin these counterfactual circumstances. Healey could argue that the\nmagnitude claims Lewis considers do not derive content from his\ncorresponding counterfactuals, on the grounds that they do not\nmaterially imply those counterfactuals and so in quantum theory an\ninference from the claim to the counterfactual is not reliable.\nAccording to Healey\u2019s inferentialist pragmatism, only reliable\nmaterial inferences confer content. Magnitude claims about the\ntrajectory of a molecule might be meaningful and true according to an\nalternative theory such as\n Bohmian mechanics.\n But in Healey\u2019s pragmatist view (2012b, pp. 1547\u20138), even\nan imprecise claim about the location and velocity of a molecule is\ntrue only in a situation that can be modeled by decoherence of a kind\nthat would block the inference to the counterfactual.\n\nLewis\u2019s final worry is that this application of inferentialist\npragmatism renders the content of a claim highly sensitive to the\nphysical environment of the system concerned. He correctly notes that,\non this pragmatist approach, quantum theory requires acknowledgement\nof radical changes to physical concepts that do not flow from other\napplications of pragmatism.\n\nOne taking Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach might respond to this\nworry by noting that these conceptual changes are a straightforward\nconsequence of the application of inferentialist pragmatism to quantum\ntheory. For an inferentialist pragmatist, a material inference can\ncontribute to the content of a claim only if it is reliable, but in\nthe quantum domain physical inferences of a sort we all make in\neveryday life fail dramatically. The sensitivity of physical concepts\nto a system\u2019s physical environment is arguably the natural\nresult of reconfiguring our physical concepts to restore the\nreliability of inferences involving them.\n",
