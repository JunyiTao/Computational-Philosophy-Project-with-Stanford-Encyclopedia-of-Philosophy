    "main_text": "Mendelssohn, Winckelmann, and Lessing: Mixed Emotions || Lessing\n4.3 Lessing\n\nThis description of the Laoco\u00f6n has been of great interest to\nrecent interpreters, but it was Winckelmann\u2019s earlier account that\ninspired the criticism of Lessing, whose Laoco\u00f6n: An Essay on\nthe Limits of Painting and Poetry, although not published until\n1766, was clearly begun and largely written before the appearance of\nWinckelmann\u2019s History in 1764. Lessing\u2019s work was thus a\nresponse to the earlier essay (only in chapter 26, almost at the end\nof the book, does Lessing say that Winckelmann\u2019s History\n\u201chas appeared, and I shall not venture another step until I have\nread it\u201d). Lessing\u2019s book, although part of the larger\neighteenth-century debate about the comparative merits of literature\nand the visual arts that builds upon the division of the arts by his\nfriend Mendelssohn, first argues against Winckelmann that the beauty\nof the Laoco\u00f6n statue comes not from the special nobility of the\nGreek soul but from the particular demands of its visual rather than\nliterary medium.\n\n\nLessing published his Laoco\u00f6n at the midpoint of his varied\nliterary and intellectual career. Lessing, like Mendelssohn born in\n1729, was the oldest of thirteen children of a Saxon pastor, and at\ntwelve he entered the monastic school at Meissen; at seventeen he went\nto Leipzig to study theology, then changed to medicine, and then to\nthe university at Wittenberg. But at twenty, he left the university\nand went to Berlin to make a career as a writer. There he quickly met\namong others Voltaire, at that time employed by Frederick the Great,\nas well as Mendelssohn. In 1755, Lessing had his great success with\nthe bourgeois tragedy Miss Sara Sampson, which initiated a\nnew direction in the German theater. In 1758, he started collaborating\nwith Mendelssohn and Friedrich Nicolai on the Letters concerning\nthe newest literature. From 1760 to 1765 Lessing worked as\nsecretary to the governor of Silesia in Breslau, during which time he\nwrote Laoco\u00f6n as well as the comedy Minna von\nBarnhelm. He returned to Berlin again in 1765, but, disappointed\nin his hopes for the position of Royal Librarian, went to Hamburg in\n1767 as director of the National Theater. The program notes he wrote\nin that capacity became his Hamburg Dramaturgy, his most\nextended critical work. In 1770 Lessing finally found a secure post as\nlibrarian for the great collection of the Dukes of Brunswick in\nWolffenb\u00fcttel, where he remained until his death in 1781. There he\nwrote the tragedy Emilia Galotti and his famous plea for\nreligious tolerance in the form of Nathan the Wise, a play\ninspired by Mendelssohn. In addition to various theological polemics,\nhe also published his Education of the Human Race the year\nbefore his death.\n\n\nThe thesis of Laoco\u00f6n, as already suggested, is that the\ncharacter of the famous statue is due not to the nobility of the Greek\nmind but to the imperatives of its visual medium.  Lessing begins his\nwork by quoting the passage from Winckelmann\u2019s essay \u201cOn\nthe Imitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks\u201d quoted above (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, p. 7). He then argues\nthat the Greek, like anyone else, \u201cfelt and feared, and he\nexpressed his pain and grief,\u201d and that this was not thought to\nbe incompatible with nobility of soul; he appeals to examples from\nHomer\u2019s Iliad to prove this point. So he concludes that\nif, according to the ancient Greek, crying aloud\nwhen in physical pain is compatible with nobility of soul, then the\ndesire to express such nobility could not have prevented the artist\nfrom representing the scream in his marble, There must be another\nreason why he differs on this point from his rival the\npoet. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 9\u201311)\n\n\nThe reason, Lessing claims, is\nthat among the ancients beauty was the supreme law\nof the visual arts. Once this has been established, it necessarily\nfollows that whatever else these arts may include must give way\ncompletely if not compatible with beauty, and, if compatible, must at\nleast be subordinate to it.\n\n\nIn the case of the story of Laoco\u00f6n, since\nThe demands of beauty could not be reconciled with\n[his] pain in all its disfiguring violence, so it had to be\nreduced. The scream had to be softened to a sigh, not because\nscreaming betrays an ignoble soul, but because it distorts the\nfeatures in a disgusting manner. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 15,\n17)\n\n\nIndeed, in a later discussion of the demands of\nreligion on visual art, Lessing adds that\n\nI should prefer that only those be called works of art in which the\nartist had occasion to show himself as such and in which beauty was\nhis first and ultimate aim. None of the others, which betray too\nobvious traces of religious conventions, deserves this name because in\ntheir case the artist did not create for art\u2019s sake [weil die\nKunst hier nicht um ihren selbst willen gearbeitet, literally\n\u201cbecause here art did not work for its own sake\u201d], but his\nart was merely a handmaid of religion, which stressed meaning more\nthan beauty in the material subjects it allotted to art for execution.\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 15, 17)\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d is often thought to be a\nnineteenth-century invention, but here Lessing clearly anticipates it,\nmeaning that at least in the visual arts all other considerations must\nbe subordinated to the creation of beauty.\n\n\nLessing does not appeal to any philosophical theory to back up this\ninsistence. But his next step is to buttress his argument by borrowing\nMendelssohn\u2019s idea that since the visual arts present objects in a\nsingle moment, they must choose that moment carefully, and in\nparticular they must choose a moment that gives \u201cfree\nrein\u201d to the imagination. Even if it were to be conceded that\n\u201cTruth and expression are art\u2019s first law,\u201d which Lessing\nis not actually willing to concede, this would still hold. Thus\npaintings and sculptures must not represent the moment of the\nculmination of an action, which leaves nothing further to the\nimagination, but a moment of anticipation which leaves the imagination\nfree to play with further possibilities (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 3,\np. 19). The artist of the Laoco\u00f6n did not represent his subject at the\nmoment of his greatest pain and full scream because that would have\nforeclosed the free play of the imagination of the audience for the\nwork. Here Lessing at least tacitly invokes the new theory that the\nplay of our mental powers rather than the representation of some form\nof truth is the fundamental aim of art, or at least visual art.\n\n\nLessing continues his argument by turning to the other half of\nMendelssohn\u2019s theory, the claim that poetry is an art that\ncan represent a succession of events over time rather than one moment\nin time. \u201cAccordingly, bodies with their visible properties are\nthe true subjects of painting,\u201d while, since actions take place\nover time, \u201cactions are the true subjects of poetry.\u201d\nThus, \u201cpainting too can imitate actions, but only by suggestion\nthrough bodies,\u201d and again \u201ccan use only a single moment\nof an action in its coexisting compositions and must therefore choose\nthe one that is most suggestive.\u201d Conversely, in order to\nrepresent a body poetry can only describe an action in which the body\nis made, used, or otherwise involved (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 16,\npp. 78\u20139). This leads Lessing to a memorable analysis of some\nexamples from Homer: \u201cIf Homer wants to show us Juno\u2019s chariot,\nhe shows Hebe putting it together piece by piece\u201d; when he\n\u201cwants to show us how Agamemnon was dressed, he has the king put\non his garments, one by one,\u201d and, most famously, when he wants\nto show us Achilles\u2019s shield, he does not describe it \u201cas\nfinished and complete, but as a shield that is being made\u201d\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 16, p. 80; chapter 18, p. 95).\n\n\nSo far, Lessing has merely rejected Winckelmann\u2019s analysis of the\nLaoco\u00f6n statue on the basis of his own insistence that beauty is the\nprimary aim of visual art as well as on Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction\nbetween arts that can represent one moment and arts that can represent\na succession of moments. But he broadens his target when he says, in a\npassing discussion of the fact that both Homer and Milton were blind,\nthat \u201cif the range of my physical sight must be the measure of\nmy inner vision, I should value the loss of the former in order to\ngain freedom from the limitations on the latter\u201d\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 14, p. 74). Here his implication is that\nsight actually constrains the imagination, while non-visual\nmedia\u2014in other words, poetry\u2014free the imagination for a\nwider play with both ideas and emotions. This point could also be\nthought to depend on one of Mendelssohn\u2019s ideas, namely his contrast\nbetween natural and arbitrary or conventional signs. Lessing touches\nupon this in passing, arguing that although \u201cthe symbols of\nspeech are arbitrary,\u201d the poet actually wants to overcome our\nawareness of that fact:\nHe wants rather to make the ideas he awakens in us\nso vivid that at the moment we believe that we feel the real\nimpressions which the objects of these ideas would produce in us. In\nthis moment of illusion we should cease to be conscious of the means\nwhich the poet uses for this purpose, that is, his\nwords. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 17, p. 85)\n\n\n\nBut while emphasizing that the poet aims to create a vivid response in\nus, in particular a vivid emotional response, Lessing fails to mention\nMendelssohn\u2019s point that we also need to retain some awareness of the\nartificiality rather than reality of the artistic depiction of persons\nand actions in order to maintain the distance necessary to allow us to\nenjoy the emotions evoked by art rather than being overwhelmed by them\ninto actual suffering. He does not need to mention this, perhaps, in\nthe case of the visual arts, since he holds that the visual artist\nleaves the audience some freedom of imagination by not depicting the\nmoment of the greatest suffering of his subject, and this freedom may\nafford the necessary distance, but he might have done well to mention\nit in the case of poetry.\n\n\nLessing thus touches upon the new idea that aesthetic response is\nbased on the free play of our mental powers stimulated by an object,\nin his case always by a work of art, and he exploits several of\nMendelssohn\u2019s theoretical tools. He should nevertheless be seen as a\npracticing critic using theoretical developments for his own purposes\nrather than as a theorist in his own right. However, his criticism\nimmediately triggered more philosophical aesthetics in response. In\nthe next section, we shall see how Johann Gottfried Herder reasserted\nyet refined an aesthetics of truth beginning with a response to\nLessing, while Johann Georg Sulzer attempted to combine an aesthetics\nof truth with an aesthetics of play. Sulzer\u2019s combination of the\naesthetics of truth and play would in turn prepare the way for Kant,\nwhile Herder\u2019s final work, more than twenty years after he completed\nhis main work in aesthetics, would be a critique of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics. This section will also include a discussion of the\naesthetic theory of Marcus Herz, who was first a student of Kant and\nthen a friend of Mendelssohn, but who developed an aesthetic theory\nthat is in interesting ways independent of both.\n",
