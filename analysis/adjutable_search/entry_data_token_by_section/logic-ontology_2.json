    "main_text": "Logic || Different conceptions of logic\n2.1 Different conceptions of logic\n\nOn the one hand, logic is the study of certain mathematical properties\nof artificial, formal languages. It is concerned with such languages\nas the first or second order predicate calculus, modal logics, the\nlambda calculus, categorial grammars, and so forth. The mathematical\nproperties of these languages are studied in such subdisciplines of\nlogic as proof theory or model theory. Much of the work done in this\narea these days is mathematically difficult, and it might not be\nimmediately obvious why this is considered a part of philosophy.\nHowever, logic in this sense arose from within philosophy and the\nfoundations of mathematics, and it is often seen as being of\nphilosophical relevance, in particular in the philosophy of\nmathematics, and in its application to natural languages.\n\nA second discipline, also called \u2018logic\u2019, deals with\ncertain valid inferences and good reasoning connected to them. The\nidea here is that there are certain patterns of valid inferences which\nare both an object of study in itself as well as connected to certain\npatterns of good reasoning. How this connection between inference and\nreasoning is to be understood more precisely and to what extent it\nobtains is controversial, and beyond the scope of this survey.\nHowever, see Christensen 2005 for more. In any case, logic does not\ncapture good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of\nrationality. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be\ntraced back to the formal features of the representations that are\ninvolved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other\nrepresentations. Some patterns of inference can be seen as valid by\nmerely looking at the form of the representations that are involved in\nthis inference. Such a conception of logic thus distinguishes validity\nfrom formal validity. An inference is valid just in case the\ntruth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, or\nalternatively if the premises are true then the conclusion has to be\ntrue as well, or again alternatively, if it can\u2019t be that the\npremises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\nValidity so understood is simply a modal notion, a notion about what\nhas to be the case. Others might think of validity as involving a more\nfine grained hyperintensional notion, but in any case, validity so\nunderstood is not what logic is concerned with. Logic is concerned\nwith formal validity, which can be understood as follows. In\na system of representations, for example a language, it can be that\nsome inferences are always valid as long as the representational or\nsemantic features of certain parts of the representations are kept\nfixed, even if we abstract from or ignore the representational\nfeatures of the other parts of the representations. So, for example,\nas long as we stick to English, and we keep the meanings of certain\nwords like \u201csome\u201d and \u201call\u201d fixed, certain\npatterns of inference, like some of Aristotle\u2019s syllogisms, are\nvalid no matter what the meaning of the other words in the\n syllogism.[1]\n To call an inference formally valid is to assume that certain words\nhave their meaning fixed, that we are within a fixed set of\nrepresentations, and that we can ignore the meaning of the other\nwords. The words that are kept fixed are the logical vocabulary, or\nlogical constants, the others are the non-logical vocabulary. And when\nan inference is formally valid then the conclusion logically follows\nfrom the premises. This could be generalized for representations that\nare not linguistic, like graphic representations, though it would\nrequire a bit more work to do so. Logic is the study of such\ninferences, and certain related concepts and topics, like formal\ninvalidity, proof, consistency, and so on. The central notion of logic\nin this sense is the notion of logical consequence. How this notion\nshould be understood more precisely is presently widely debated, and a\nsurvey of these debates can be found in the entry on\n logical consequence.\n\nA third conception of logic takes logic to be the study of special\ntruths, or facts: the logical truths, or facts. In this sense logic\ncould be understood as a science that aims to describe certain truths\nor facts, just as other sciences aim to describe other truths. The\nlogical truths could be understood as the most general truths, ones\nthat are contained in any other body of truths that any other science\naims to describe. In this sense logic is different from biology, since\nit is more general, but it is also similar to biology in that it is a\nscience that aims to capture a certain body of truths. This way of\nlooking at logic is often associated with Frege.\n\nThis conception of logic can, however, be closely associated with the\none that takes logic to be fundamentally about certain kinds of\ninferences and about logical consequence. A logical truth, on such an\nunderstanding, is simply one that is expressed by a representation\nwhich logically follows from no assumptions, i.e. which logically\nfollows from an empty set of premises. Alternatively, a logical truth\nis one whose truth is guaranteed as long as the meaning of the logical\nconstants is fixed, no matter what the meanings of the other parts in\na representation are.\n\nAnd there are other notions of \u2018logic\u2019 as well. One of\nthem is historically prominent, but not very widely represented in the\ncontemporary debate. We will briefly discuss it here nonetheless.\nAccording to this conception of logic, it is the study of the most\ngeneral features of thoughts or judgments, or the form of thoughts or\njudgments. Logic thus understood will for example be concerned with\nthe occurrence of subject and predicate structure that many judgments\nexhibit, and with other such general features of judgments. It will\nmostly be concerned with thoughts, and not directly with linguistic\nrepresentations, though, of course, a proponent of this conception can\nclaim that there is a very close connection between them. To talk\nabout the form of a judgment will involve a subtly different notion of\n\u2018form\u2019 than to talk about the form of a linguistic\nrepresentation. The form of a linguistic representation, basically,\nwas what was left once we abstract from or ignore the representational\nfeatures of everything except what we keep fixed, the logical\nconstants. The form of a thought, on the other hand, is often\nunderstood as what is left over once we abstract from its content,\nthat is, what it is about. We will briefly pursue the question below\nhow these notions of form are related to each other. This conception\nof logic is associated with Kant. Kant distinguished different notions\nof logic (for example transcendental logic, general logic, etc.), but\nwe won\u2019t be able to discuss these here. See the entry on\n Immanuel Kant\n for more.\n\nOne important philosophical aspect of logic, at least in the senses\nthat deal with logical consequence and the forms of judgements, is its\nnormativity. Logic seems to give us a guide how we ought to reason,\nand how we ought to draw inferences from one representation to\nanother. But it is not at all clear what guide it gives us, and how we\nshould understand more precisely what norms logic puts on our\nreasoning. For example, logic does not put us under the norm \u201cIf\nyou believe \\(A\\) and you believe if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\), then you ought\nto believe \\(B\\).\u201d After all, it might be that I should not\nbelieve \\(A\\) and if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\) in the first place. So, in\nparticular I shouldn\u2019t believe \\(B\\). A reductio ad absurdum is\na form of argument that illustrates this. If I believe A and if A then\n\\(0=1\\), then this should lead me to abandon my belief in A, not lead\nto a belief that \\(0=1\\). The consequences of my beliefs can lead me\nto abandon them. Still, if I have some reasons for my beliefs then I\nhave at least some prima facie, but not necessarily conclusive, reason\nto hold the consequences of those beliefs. Logic might thus tell us at\nleast this much, though: whenever I have some reason to believe \\(A\\)\nand if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\), then I have a prima facie reason to believe\n\\(B\\). See Harman 1986 for the view that logic has no distinctive\nnormative role, and Field 2009 for a nice critical discussion of\nHarman\u2019s view and an argument why logic should be tied to norms\nof rationality. A survey of this an related issues can be found in the\nentry on\n the normativity of logic.\n\nAnd, of course, logic does not tell us how we ought to reason or infer\nin all particular cases. Logic does not deal with the particular\ncases, but only with the most generally valid forms of reasoning or\ninference, ones that are valid no matter what one reasons about. In\nthis sense logic is often seen to be topic neutral. It applies no\nmatter what one is thinking or reasoning about. And this neutrality,\nor complete generality of logic, together with its normativity, is\noften put as \u201clogic is about how we ought to think if we are to\nthink at all\u201d or \u201clogic is the science of the laws that we\nought to follow in our thinking no matter what we think about\u201d.\nThere are well known philosophical puzzles about normativity, and\nthese apply to logic as well if it is normative. One is why it is that\nthinkers are under such norms. After all, why shouldn\u2019t I think\nthe way I prefer to think, without there being some norm that governs\nmy thinking, whether I like it or not? Why is there an\n\u201cought\u201d that comes with thinking as such, even if I\ndon\u2019t want to think that way? One idea to answer this is to\nemploy the notion of a \u2018constitutive aim of belief\u2019, the\nidea that belief as such aims at something: the truth. If so then\nmaybe one could argue that by having beliefs I am under the norm that\nI ought to have true ones. And if one holds that one of the crucial\nfeatures of logically valid inferences is that they preserve truth\nthen one could argue that the logical laws are norms that apply to\nthose who have beliefs. See Velleman 2000 for more on the aim of\nbelief. The normativity of logic will not be central for our\ndiscussion to follow, but the topic neutrality and generality will\n be.[2]\n\nOverall, we can thus distinguish four notions of logic:\n\n(L1)\n the study of artificial formal languages\n(L2)\n the study of\nformally valid inferences and logical consequence\n(L3)\n the study of logical truths\n(L4)\n the study of the general features, or form, of judgements\n\n\nThere is, of course, a question how these different conceptions of\nlogic relate to each other. The details of their relationship invite\nmany hard questions, but we should briefly look at this\nnonetheless.\n",
