    "main_text": "Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist? || Linguistic Universals\n3.1 Linguistic Universals\n\n\nChomsky and others (e.g., Chomsky 1988:46-7; Pinker 1994:237-8) \nhave pointed to the existence of \u2018linguistic universals\u2019 \nas supporting the idea that language is the product of a distinct \nfaculty of mind. Universals are features thought to be common to all \nnatural languages, such as the existence of constraints on the \nmovement of elements during a derivation or, less controversially, \nthe existence of a syntactic distinction between nouns and verbs. But\nnot only is the existence of true universals a contested matter (see \ne.g., Maratsos 1989:111), it is unclear what the correct explanation\nof them \u2014 assuming they exist \u2014 is would be.\n\n\nOne explanation is certainly the Chomskyan one that they are \nconsequences of speakers' innate knowledge of UG. Another is that \nthey derive from other, non-linguistically-specific features of \ncognition, such as memory or processing constraints (e.g., Berwick \nand Weinberg 1983 trace certain constraints on movement to \nlimitations on parsing imposed by the structure of human memory). Yet\nanother is that they derive from universal demands of the \ncommunication situation (e.g., Sapir 1921, argued that the \ndistinction between nouns and verbs arises from the fact that \nlanguage is used to communicate propositions, hence needs a way to \nbring an object subject to mind and a way to say something about it).\nFinally, as Putnam 1971 speculated, universals might be relics of an\nancestral Ur-language from which all other languages evolved. This \nlast hypothesis has generally been rejected as lacking in empirical \nsupport. However, recent findings in genetics and historical \nlinguistics are converging to suggest that all human populations \nevolved from a small group migrating from Africa in the fairly recent\npast, and that all human languages have probably evolved from the \nlanguage spoken by that group. (Cavalli-Sforza 1997.)\n\n\nThe Ur-language hypothesis is not, of course, inconsistent with \nlinguistic nativism. However, if true, it does weaken any \nargument from the existence of universals to the innateness \nof linguistic knowledge. For if languages have a common ancestor, \nthen it is possible to explain universals \u2014 even ones that seem\nstrange from a functional point of view \u2014 as being the result \nof our ancestors' having adopted a certain solution to a linguistic \ncoordination problem. Like driving on the right side of the road, a \nsolution once established may become entrenched, because the benefits\nof everyone's conforming to the same rule outweigh the costs of \nchanging to a different rule, and this may be so even if the new rule\nwere in some sense more \u2018reasonable.\u2019 Thus, even \narbitrary or odd features of language can be explained historically, \nwithout positing either compelling functional considerations or \ninborn linguistic \n constraints.[18]\n\n\n\nIf, by contrast, language emerged independently in a number of areas,\nthe existence of universals would be a strong argument for nativism, \nFor in that case, it would be implausible to maintain that each \nancestral group \u2018just happened\u2019 to select the same \nsolutions to the various coordination problems they encountered. More\nplausible would be the supposition that the different groups' choice \nof the rule was driven by something internal to speakers, \nsuch as, perhaps, an innate representation of UG. In short: if \nlanguages have a common ancestor, then common descent from originally\narbitrary linguistic conventions is a possible explanation of \nlinguistic universals, including the \u2018odd\u2019 or \n\u2018arbitrary\u2019 ones that don't seem to have any real \nfunctional significance. If they don't, then such universals \nseemingly could only be explained in terms of features internal to \nspeakers.\n",
