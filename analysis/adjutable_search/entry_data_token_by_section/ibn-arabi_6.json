    "main_text": "Ontology || Wahdat al-Wuj\u00fbd\n3.1 Wahdat al-Wuj\u00fbd\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee has typically been called the founder of the\ndoctrine of wahdat al-wuj\u00fbd, the Oneness of Being or\nthe Unity of Existence, but this is misleading, for he never uses the\nexpression. Passages in his writings that approximate it have no\nspecial significance, nor are they out of place in the general trend\nof contemporary philosophy and theology, both of which affirmed the\nunity of the Necessary Being. Why wahdat al-wuj\u00fbd was\nsingled out to typify Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s position is not\nclear. Part of the reason is that he highlights tawh\u00eed\nas his guiding principle and gives wuj\u00fbd a special\nprominence in his vocabulary. It was utterly obvious to him that there\nis no Real Being but God and that everything other than God is unreal\nbeing; this is another way of saying what Avicenna says, that all\nthings are possible or contingent save the Necessary Being. In short,\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee, and even more so his followers like\nQ\u00fbnaw\u00ee, focused on the Real Wuj\u00fbd as the\none, unique reality from which all other reality derives. On the rare\noccasions when his immediate followers used the expression wahdat\nal-wuj\u00fbd, they did not give it a technical sense. The first\nauthor to say that Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee believed in wahdat\nal-wuj\u00fbd seems to have been the Hanbalite polemicist Ibn\nTaymiyya (d. 1328), who called it worse than unbelief. According to\nhim, it means that no distinction can be drawn between God and the\nworld. His attack set in motion a long controversy over the term,\noften with little or no attempt to define it. At least seven different\nmeanings were ascribed to it in the later literature, and Orientalists\nfollowed suit, declaring that Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee invented the\ndoctrine, and then interpreting it negatively (\u00e0 la Ibn\nTaymiyya) or, less commonly, positively (\u00e0 la \u2018Abd\nal-Rahm\u00e2n J\u00e2m\u00ee [d. 1492], the first of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s defenders to embrace the expression)\n(Chittick, 1994b).\n",
