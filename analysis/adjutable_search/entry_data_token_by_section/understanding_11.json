    "main_text": "Humanistic Understanding\n5. Humanistic Understanding\n\nTo this point we have mainly focused on what it takes to understand\nphenomena in the natural world, such as rusting metal bars, or the\nrising and falling of the tides, or the behavior of gases. A\nlongstanding question, however, especially in the Continental\ntradition of philosophy and especially in the philosophy of the social\nsciences, is whether understanding human beings and their artifacts\nrequires something different and distinctive from an epistemic point\nof view\u2014perhaps, for example, a distinctive set of abilities or\nmethodologies, tied to the distinctive objects (or, importantly,\nsubjects!) we are trying to understand.\n\nMoreover, a long string of influential thinkers\u2014starting roughly\nwith Giambattista Vico and continuing through figures such Wilhelm\nDilthey and R. G. Collingwood\u2014answer this question\naffirmatively. Distinctive abilities and perhaps methodologies\ndo come on the scene when we try to understand human beings,\nat least when we try to understand them in a particular way. In broad\nstrokes, the idea is that there is a kind of understanding of other\nhuman beings that we can only acquire by reconstructing their\nperspectives\u2014in some sense, \u201cfrom within\u201d those\nperspectives and according to their own terms (cf. Ismael 2018).\n\nSometimes this approach has been referred to as \u201cthe\nverstehen tradition\u201d\u2014in honor of its special\nroots in the German tradition, and leaving untranslated the German\nword for understanding (Martin 2000; Feest 2010). Alternative labels\nfor this approach include \u201cthe interpretative tradition\u201d,\n\u201cthe historicist tradition\u201d, \u201cthe hermeneutic\ntradition\u201d, and \u201cthe humanistic tradition\u201d (for\noverviews, see Hiley et al. 1992; Stueber 2012). For convenience, we\nwill refer to this as \u201cthe humanistic tradition\u201d.\nIt is not an essential part of this tradition that human beings can\nonly be understood by reconstructing their perspectives, but\nthe tradition does characteristically claim that there is special\nvalue in trying to do so. It also typically claims that taking up\nperspectives \u201cfrom within\u201d requires distinctive cognitive\nresources and perhaps distinctive methods\u2014resources and methods\nthat are not clearly needed when we attempt to understand natural\nphenomena.\n\nGiambattista Vico (1668\u20131744) was among the first to try to\narticulate how exactly understanding human beings differs from\nunderstanding the natural world (see especially Vico 1725 [2002].)\nAccording to Vico, just as we have a special scienza\n(knowledge or understanding) of things we have made or produced\nourselves, so too we can have special insight into things that other\nhuman beings have made or produced\u2014where the things made or\nproduced included not just physical artifacts but also human actions.\nVico further postulated a special ability\u2014fantasia, or\nreconstructive imagination\u2014by which we can enter into the minds\nof others and see the world through their eyes and in terms of their\ncategories of thought (Miller 1993: ch. 5).\n\nFurther north in Europe, Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803)\nheld that because human nature is not static, or fixed irrespective of\ntime and place, understanding alien cultures requires a process of\nEinf\u00fchlung\u2014a \u201cfeeling one\u2019s way\ninto\u201d\u2014the culture in question, in all its specificity and\nperhaps with an eye to its particular genius. In Herder\u2019s hands,\nhowever, Einf\u00fchlung was not a quasi-mystical or\nirrational attempt to leap into the minds of others. Instead, it was\noften a slow, methodical process that needed to be aided by careful\nhistorical-philological inquiry (Forster 2002: xvii). (For central\ntexts, see Herder 2002.)\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911) became the most celebrated advocate of the idea that\nthe human sciences\u2014in German, the\nGeisteswissenschaften, such as history\u2014had a different\nfocus than the natural sciences, and centered on the idea of inner or\nlived experience. (See Dilthey 1883 [1989] for a\ncharacteristic work.) Someone\u2019s lived experience, moreover, was\nconstituted not only by their beliefs or attitudes, but also by their\nemotions and volitions. For Dilthey, as Frederick Beiser puts the\nidea,\n\n\nWe understand an episode in a person\u2019s life only when we see how\nit plays a role in realizing his basic values, his conception of what\nmakes life worth living. (Beiser 2011: 334)\n\n\nIn England, the humanistic approach was championed especially by R. G.\nCollingwood (1889\u20131943). According to Collingwood, what\ndistinguishes human history from, say, geological history, is that\nhuman history is suffused with thought\u2014i.e., it is a record of\nhuman aspirations, goals, beliefs, frustrations, and so on. We can,\nmoreover, have two possible stances towards these thoughts. We can try\nto map them from a third person point of view, and identify the\nvarious ways the thoughts depend upon and relate to one another. But\nwe can also try to \u201cre-enact\u201d or \u201crethink\u201d\nthem (D\u2019Oro 2000, 2004). Thus Collingwood held that,\n\n\nThe events of history are never mere phenomena, never mere spectacles\nfor contemplation, but things which the historian looks, not at, but\nthrough, to discern the thought within them. (Collingwood 1946 [1993:\n214])\n\n",
