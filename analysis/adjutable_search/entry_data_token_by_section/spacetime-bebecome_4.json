    "main_text": "Newtonian Spacetime || How (and How Not) To Think About Passage\n2.3 How (and How Not) To Think About Passage\n\nIf McTaggart\u2019s argument that passage is conceptually absurd or\nself-contradictory fails, philosophers mindful of modern physics are\nstill left with Einstein\u2019s concern that passage and the now,\nwhile deeply embedded in human experience, seem to find no place in\nphysics. One may agree with Carnap above that \u201call that occurs\nobjectively can be described in science\u201d and then argue that\npassage reflects something perspectival or subjective and so is\nrightly omitted by physics.\n\nThe most popular version of this view holds that now is a\ntoken-reflexive or indexical term, like here (Smart 1963,\nchapter VII; Mellor 1981, 1998). Physics is not felt to be incomplete\nbecause it fails to treat hereness. Why should its\nindifference to nowness be of any greater concern?\n\nEarly proponents of this view often claimed that \u2018\\(S\\)\nis now \\(F\\)\u2019 meant \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019s\nbeing \\(F\\) is simultaneous\nwith this utterance,\u2019 a quite implausible claim. A more\nsophisticated version of the view is that the truth-conditions of\nsentences like \u2018\\(S\\) is now \\(F\\)\u2019\ncan be given solely in terms of the\n(tenseless) facts that exist or events that occur at the time of the\nutterance or inscription of the given sentence. One can treat\npast and future in a similar fashion. (Dyke,\n2013)\n\nSmart claimed that excessive attention to the tensed notions of\nnow, past, and future serve to project a \u201csort\nof anthropocentric idea on the universe at large.\u201d(1963, 132)\nBut even if the tensed temporal locutions are anthropocentric and do\nlocate us in the universe, it may still be asked whether\nthese temporal locations are in a static structure, \u201ca\nfour-dimensional continuum of spacetime entities,\u201d (132) or in\nan unfolding or dynamic universe. Smart dismisses this latter view\nbecause, in his view, it involves the obscure or mistaken idea that\nevents \u201cbecome\u201d or \u201ccome into existence.\u201d\nBecoming and passage are mistakes, in his view, and harmful ones at\nthat. Smart writes: \u201cOur notion of time as flowing, the\ntransitory aspect of time as Broad has called it, is an illusion which\nprevents us seeing the world as it really is\u201d (132).\n\nIt will be useful to untangle a couple of ideas that are confounded in\nthese quotes from Smart, with the help of some arguments of (mostly)\nBroad\u2019s (1938, section 1.22 of Chapter 35). First is the idea\nthat time \u201cflows\u201d or, more generally, that passage is\nsomehow to be thought of as like motion. Perhaps time itself somehow\nmoves. Or perhaps, as Broad wrote in a famous passage (1923, 59):\n\nWe are naturally tempted to regard the history of the world as\nexisting eternally in a certain order of events. Along this, and in a\nfixed direction, we imagine the characteristic of presentness moving,\nsomewhat like the spot of light from a policeman\u2019s\nbull\u2019s-eye traversing the fronts of the houses in a street. What\nis illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past,\nand what has not yet been illuminated is the future.\n\n\nThis picture of passage has come to be called the moving\nspotlight view, or just the moving\n NOW.[3]\n\nMotion is one sort of change, change of spatial position with respect\nto time. The motion of time, then, must be change of time with respect\nto \u2026 What? If the answer, by analogy with motion, is\n\u201ctime\u201d, one might be rightly puzzled as to how time (or\nanything else, for that matter) can change with respect to\nitself. Furthermore, if it is just time again, then the ratio of\nthese two quantities expressing the supposed rate of change is a pure\nor dimensionless number if the dimensions of the quantities in this\nratio cancel. (See Price 1996, p. 13.) A pure number is not a rate of\nchange, although it may represent various rates of change (for\ninstance, 30 meters/second or 30 miles/hour). As Price remarks,\n\u201cWe might just as well say that the ratio of the circumference\nof a circle to its diameter flows at \\(\\pi\\) seconds per\nsecond!\u201d\n\nTim Maudlin (2007) has replied to Price that the rate of one second\nper second is a perfectly fine rate. Consider, he says, a fair\nexchange rate (based, say, on purchasing power parity) for currencies.\nThe fair exchange rate for the British pound might, at some time, be\n1.52 US dollars per pound. Similarly, Maudlin observes that the fair\nexchange rate for the US dollar with respect to itself must be 1 US\ndollar per US dollar. \u201cIf you think that this answer is\nmeaningless,\u201d Maudlin writes, \u201cimagine your reaction to an\noffer of exchange at any other rate\u201d (2007, 112).\n\nPrice (2011) has replied to Maudlin by abandoning the claim that the\nunits in \u201cone second per second\u201d cancel, leaving a pure\nnumber. He now insists, rather, that a ratio of a quantity to itself\ncan not be a rate at all. Maudlin\u2019s example only seems to evade\nthis point by supposing a ratio of dollars offered to\ndollars returned. That ratio differs, as he sees it, in an\nessential way from the ratio of one second to one second or, for that\nmatter, from the ratio of one mile to one mile, which are both ratios\nof quantities to themselves. Neither in his view can be a rate, and\nthe former ratio is no more characteristic of time than the latter\nratio is of space. (See also Markosian (1993), Olson (2009), Raven\n(2010), Skow (2012), and Arthur (2019, 134\u201335).)\n\nIf (in order to avoid the apparent collapse of a ratio or rate into a\npure number) the time in the denominator of the ratio expressing the\nrate of time\u2019s motion is held to be a different temporal\ndimension from the one in the numerator, then for it to be a genuine\ntime there will have to be passage in it, requiring yet a third\ntemporal dimension. One can see that we are at the beginning of an\ninfinite regress, unless the third temporal dimension is identified\nwith the first (as in Schlesinger 1980, Chapter II), leaving us still\nin the uncomfortable position of having two temporal dimensions. It\nseems at best heroic, at worst hopeless, to try to understand passage\nas a kind of motion.\n\nBroad thought that trying to explain or represent passage in terms of\nqualitative change was \u201cdoomed to failure.\u201d A thing or\nsubstance, \\(S\\), can change in terms of a quality or\nproperty if property \\(P_1\\) and property \\(P_2\\) are determinates\nunder a given determinable and \\(S\\) is \\(P_1\\) at\n\\(t_1\\) but \\(P_2\\) at \\(t_2\\). The passage of time, then, is to be\nthought of as an event\u2019s having (say) the property of\npresentness and then immediately losing that property but gaining (and\nlosing in turn) a long and possibly endless series of properties of\nthe increasing degrees of pastness.\n\nIn order for a thing to change from having \\(P_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) to\nhaving \\(P_2\\) at \\(t_2\\) it must evidently persist at least from\n\\(t_1\\) to \\(t_2\\), but the events usually supposed in discussions of\npassage are instantaneous events, which have no duration at all. They\ncan not undergo qualitative change. It is sometimes argued that the\nproperties that make up the A-series (and so change of which\nrepresents passage) are special properties, which even instantaneous\nevents can gain and lose, but this is special pleading. As noted\nabove, physics has so far no need of such special properties and such\nspecial change and so is unlikely to be sympathetic to this special\npleading.\n\nFinally, Broad notes that (assuming one wishes to think of passage as\nlike qualitative change) the acquisition and loss of (say) presentness\nby an event would itself be an event, a second-order event, in the\nhistory of a first-order event. Since the first-order events are, by\nhypothesis, durationless, it is tempting to suppose that this history\ntakes place in a second temporal dimension. We find ourselves again\nlaunched on what looks to be an infinite regress of temporal\ndimensions.\n\nThese are strong arguments against two perennially tempting ways to\nconstrue temporal becoming\u2014as like motion or qualitative change.\nThey are strong arguments against the existence of temporal becoming\nif there is no other way to understand it. Broad thought, however,\nthat he had a third way. Having pointed out the superficial\ngrammatical similarity between \u2018\\(E\\) became\nlouder\u2019 and \u2018\\(E\\) became present\u2019,\nBroad said that our understanding of these two kinds of assertions\nneed not be dictated by it. He wrote (1938, p. 280\u20131):\n\nAgain, any subject of which we can significantly say that it\n\u201cbecame louder\u201d must be a more or less prolonged\nnoise-process, which divides into an earlier phase of less loudness\nadjoined to a later phase of greater loudness. But a literally\ninstantaneous event-particle can significantly be said to\n\u201cbecome present\u201d; and, indeed, in the strict sense of\n\u201cpresent\u201d only instantaneous event-particles can\nbe said to \u201cbecome present\u201d. To \u201cbecome\npresent\u201d is, in fact, just to \u201cbecome\u201d, in an\nabsolute sense; i.e., to \u201ccome to pass\u201d in the Biblical\nphraseology, or, most simply, to \u201chappen\u201d. Sentences like\n\u201cThis water became hot\u201d or \u201cThis noise became\nlouder\u201d record facts of qualitative change. Sentences\nlike \u201cThis event became present\u201d record facts of\nabsolute becoming.\n\n\nThe terminology may be pretentious, but the idea is simple. Absolute\nbecoming is just the happening of events. The raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre, the very being or existence of events, is in\ntheir happening (at some place and time). If one is willing to embrace\nthis category of entity at all, then one has the tools for a\nminimalist understanding of passage. Given the geometric richness of\nNewtonian spacetime, we can say that some events occur at the same\ntime and so form a class of simultaneous events. These classes can be\nordered by their times, so we can say that some events occur before or\nafter others. The passage of time is then just the successive\nhappening of (simultaneity sets of)\n events.[4]\n It may be this picture of passage that the great logician Kurt\nG\u00f6del had in mind when he wrote (1949, p. 558): \u201cThe\nexistence of an objective lapse of time \u2026 means (or, at least,\nis equivalent to the fact) that reality consists of an infinity of\nlayers of \u2018now\u2019 which come into existence\nsuccessively.\u201d\n\nThere is an ambiguity in this last quote, however, that we must note.\nDid G\u00f6del think that the layers of now come into existence (as\nwhat is to be becomes what is now) and then immediately cease to exist\n(as what is now becomes what once was), which is the presentist\nmetaphysics of time? Or did he think that the layers of now come into\nexistence and forever stay in existence, as the possibilist picture\nmaintains? If one\u2019s basic ontology consists of the sort of\nevents characterized above and often invoked in discussions of time,\n(idealized) instantaneous happenings, then the presentist picture\nseems inevitable.\n\nThe metaphysics of time is, however, one of the cross-roads of\nphilosophy where issues intersect. If one thinks of a basic ontology\nconsisting not of events but of substances or continuants, then one is\napt to wonder what it is that makes sentences marking episodes in the\nhistories of such substances\u2014sentences like \u2018\\(S\\)\nis \\(\\Phi\\) at \\(t\\)\u2019\u2014true.\nOne frequent suggestion is that\nthe \u201ctruth-makers\u201d of such sentences are facts, the fact\nthat at \\(t\\), \\(S\\) is\n\\(\\Phi\\). Then one might further note that in the current year, 2021,\nwe can say:\n\nIt is a fact that Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington in\n1980.\nIt is a fact that Justin Trudeau is now Prime Minister of\nCanada.\nIt is a fact that there will be a total eclipse of the sun in the\nUnited States in 2045.\n\n\nThese facts, when compared to evanescent events, seem to have great\nstability, the first one lasting (since it is a fact\n\u2026) at least from 1980 till the present. The third one is,\nhowever, a special sort of fact, clearly not dependent on human will\nor choice and almost certainly not dependent upon any quantum\nmeasurements either. Future facts that do depend upon human choice or\nquantum measurement, should they be facts now, would seem to constrain\nhuman choice or quantum measurement in ways that many philosophers\nfind undesirable. It is easy to convince oneself, then, that future\nfacts of those two sorts can not really be part of the existing.\nPerhaps, then, facts like fact 3 above can be argued away as well. The\nresult of this (lightly sketched) train of thought is, of course, the\npossibilist picture of time.\n\nIt seems unlikely that a simple argument will decide between these two\nmetaphysical pictures of time, presentism and possiblism. Showing that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument is flawed, because it relies on an\nambiguity in the copula \u2018is\u2019, and that there is a way to\nconstrue passage that side-steps the traditional objections, moreover,\ndoes not show that eternalism is false but only that it is optional.\nIn Newtonian spacetime it may appear implausible, but it may fare\nbetter when we turn to Minkowski spacetime.\n",
