Anti-determinism, Tychism, and Evolutionism\n\n\nAgainst powerful currents of determinism that derived from the\nEnlightenment philosophy of the eighteenth century, Peirce urged that\nthere was not the slightest scientific evidence for determinism and\nthat in fact there was considerable scientific evidence against\nit. Always by the words \u201cscience\u201d and\n\u201cscientific\u201d Peirce understood reference to actual\npractice by scientists in the laboratory and the field, and not\nreference to entries in scientific textbooks. In attacking\ndeterminism, therefore, Peirce appealed to the evidence of the actual\nphenomena in laboratories and fields. Here, what is obtained as the\nactual observations (e.g. measurements) does not fit neatly into some\none point or simple function. If we take, for example, a thousand\nmeasurements of some physical quantity, even a simple one such as\nlength or thickness, no matter how carefully we may do so, we will not\nobtain the same result a thousand times. Rather, what we get is a\ndistribution (often, but not always and certainly not necessarily,\nsomething akin to a normal or Gaussian distribution) of hundreds of\ndifferent results. Again, if we measure the value of some variable\nthat we assume to depend on some given parameter, and if we let the\nparameter vary while we take successive measurements, the result in\ngeneral will not be a smooth function (for example, a straight line or\nan ellipse); rather, it will typically be a \u201cjagged\u201d\nresult, to which we can at best fit a smooth function by\nusing some clever method (for example, fitting a regression line by\nthe method of least-squares). Naively, we might imagine that the\nvariation and relative inexactness of our measurements will become\nless pronounced and obtrusive the more refined and microscopic are our\nmeasurement tools and procedures. Peirce, the practicing scientist,\nknew better. What actually happens, if anything, is that our\nvariations get relatively greater the finer is our instrumentation and\nthe more delicate our procedures.  (Obviously, Peirce would not have\nbeen the least surprised by the results obtained from measurements at\nthe quantum level.)\n\n\nWhat the directly measured facts of scientific practice seem to tell\nus, then, is that, although the universe displays varying degrees of\nhabit (that is to say, of partial, varying, approximate, and\nstatistical regularity), the universe does not display deterministic\nlaw. It does not directly show anything like total, exact,\nnon-statistical regularity. Moreover, the habits that nature does\ndisplay always appear in varying degrees of entrenchment or\n\u201ccongealing.\u201d At one end of the spectrum, we have the nearly law-like\nbehavior of larger physical objects like boulders and planets; but at\nthe other end of the spectrum, we see in human processes of\nimagination and thought an almost pure freedom and spontaneity; and in\nthe quantum world of the very small we see the results of almost pure\nchance.\n\n\nThe immediate, \u201craw\u201d result, then, of scientific\nobservation through measurement is that not everything is exactly\nfixed by exact law (even if everything should be constrained to some\ndegree by habit). In his earliest thinking about the significance of\nthis fact, Peirce opined that natural law pervaded the world but that\ncertain facets of reality were just outside the reach or grasp of\nlaw. In his later thinking, however, Peirce came to understand this\nfact as meaning that reality in its entirety was lawless and that pure\nspontaneity had an objective status in the phaneron. Peirce called his\ndoctrine that chance has an objective status in the universe\n\u201ctychism,\u201d a word taken from the Greek word for\n\u201cchance\u201d or \u201cluck\u201d or \u201cwhat the gods\nhappen to choose to lay on one.\u201d Tychism is a fundamental\ndoctrinal part of Peirce\u2019s mature view, and reference to his tychism\nprovides an added reason for Peirce\u2019s insisting on the irreducible\nfallibilism of inquiry. For nature is not a static world of unswerving\nlaw but rather a dynamic and dicey world of evolved and continually\nevolving habits that directly exhibit considerable\nspontaneity. (Peirce would have embraced quantum indeterminacy.)\n\n\nOne possible path along which nature evolves and acquires its habits\nwas explored by Peirce using statistical analysis in situations of \nexperimental trials in which the probabilities of outcomes in later trials \nare not independent of actual outcomes in earlier trials, situations of \nso-called \u201cnon-Bernoullian trials.\u201d \nPeirce showed that, if we posit a certain primal habit\nin nature, viz. the tendency however slight to take on habits however\ntiny, then the result in the long run is often a high degree of\nregularity and great macroscopic exactness.  For this reason, Peirce\nsuggested that in the remote past nature was considerably more\nspontaneous than it has now become, and that in general and as a whole\nall the habits that nature has come to exhibit have evolved. Just \nas ideas, geological formations, and biological species have evolved, \nnatural habit has evolved.\n\n\nIn this evolutionary notion of nature and natural law we have an added\nsupport of Peirce\u2019s insistence on the inherent fallibilism of\nscientific inquiry. Nature may simply change, even in its most\nentrenched fundamentals. Thus, even if scientists were at one point in\ntime to have conceptions and hypotheses about nature that survived\nevery attempt to falsify them, this fact alone would not ensure that\nat some later point in time these same conceptions and hypotheses\nwould remain accurate or even pertinent.\n\n\nAn especially intriguing and curious twist in Peirce\u2019s evolutionism is\nthat in Peirce\u2019s view evolution involves what he calls its\n\u201cagapeism.\u201d Peirce speaks of evolutionary love.  According\nto Peirce, the most fundamental engine of the evolutionary process is\nnot struggle, strife, greed, or competition. Rather it is nurturing\nlove, in which an entity is prepared to sacrifice its own perfection\nfor the sake of the wellbeing of its neighbor. This doctrine had a\nsocial significance for Peirce, who apparently had the intention of\narguing against the morally repugnant but extremely popular\nsocio-economic Darwinism of the late nineteenth century.  The doctrine\nalso had for Peirce a cosmic significance, which Peirce associated\nwith the doctrine of the Gospel of John and with the mystical ideas of\nSwedenborg and Henry James. In Part IV of the third of Peirce\u2019s six\npapers in Popular Science Monthly, entitled \u201cThe\nDoctrine of Chances,\u201d Peirce even argued that simply being\nlogical presupposes the ethics of self-sacrifice: \u201cHe who would\nnot sacrifice his own soul to save the whole world, is, as it seems to\nme, illogical in all his inferences, collectively.\u201d To social\nDarwinism, and to the related sort of thinking that constituted for\nHerbert Spencer and others a supposed justification for the more\nrapacious practices of unbridled capitalism, Peirce referred in\ndisgust as \u201cThe Gospel of Greed.\u201d\n",
