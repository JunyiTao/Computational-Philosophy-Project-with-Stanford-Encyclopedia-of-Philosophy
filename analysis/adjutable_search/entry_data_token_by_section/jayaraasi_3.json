Until the publication of the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha, Jayar\u0101\u015bi was considered a\ntypical representative of the materialist school. It all changed when\nthe publication of the work in 1940 made the text available to\nscholars. The publication revealed that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s view are\nfar from what one considered \u00a0\u2018standard\u2019 or\n\u2018orthodox\u2019 materialism and hardly compatible with what we\nso far knew about the schools of the C\u0101rv\u0101kas /\nLok\u0101yatas. As a result, a wide range of conflicting\ninterpretations abound as to how to classify\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s philosophy.\n\nSukhl\u0101lj\u012b Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b and Rasikl\u0101l C.\nP\u0101r\u012bkh (1940: xi-xii) take the text as \u2018a work of the\nLok\u0101yata or C\u0101rv\u0101ka school, or to be more precise\n\u2013 of a particular division of that school\u2019, emphasising\nthat Jayar\u0101\u015bi \u2018is developing the doctrine of the\northodox (!) Lok\u0101yata\u2019 \u00a0with a \u2018critical\nmethod\u2019 (p. xii). The tradition of ascribing the view to\nSa\u1e41ghav\u012b and P\u0101r\u012bkh that the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha is \u2018a genuine C\u0101rv\u0101ka\nwork\u2019 relies rather on the misreading of what both the authors\nsay: they are well aware that Jayar\u0101\u015bi develops an original\nand independent school within what he himself considered a materialist\ntradition. This view, adopted also by Ruben (1958), is somewhat\nmodified by Franco (1987: 4\u20138), who speaks of a \u2018radical\nchange from a rather primitive materialism to a highly sophisticated\nform of scepticism\u2019, and also recently by Ethan Mills (2018),\nwho claims that Jayar\u0101\u015bi developed \u2018materialist\nstrains\u2019 and represented \u2018skepticism about\nphilosophy\u2019, or \u2018skepticism about epistemology\u2019\n(Mills (2015), (2018)).\n\nThus, a group of other researchers (e.g., Koller (1977), Matilal\n(1985: 482), Matilal (1986: 27), Solomon (2010: xvi), Jha (2013: vii),\nGokhale (2015: 156\u2013157), Mills (2018)) classify\nJayar\u0101\u015bi as a sceptic, either loosely affiliated to the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition or not at all, even as an\nanti-religious sceptic (Matilal (1985: 482)), a radical sceptic\n(Franco (1987: 3\u20138)), \u2018the full-fledged form of Indian\nSkepticism\u2019 (Solomon (2010: xvi)), an extreme sceptic who\nrepresents \u2018a kind of anarchism in the realm of values\u2019\n(Gokhale (2015: 180, 155)), sometimes also as an agnostic (Ruben\n(1958); Matilal (1985: 483, n. 10)), or a combination of both, being\nan author of \u2018a work in defence of scepticism, or at best,\nagnosticism\u2019 (Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya\u2019s\n\u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d to\nChattopadhyaya\u2013Gangopadhyaya (1990: xiv)). A rather unusual\nstance on Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s affiliation is represented by\nK.K. Dixit (1962: 103) / (1990: 529), who claims that he was both a\nmaterialist and\u2026 \u2018a worshipper of illogic\u2019\n(sic!).\n\nStill another line of researchers disagree that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\nbelonged to the materialist tradition at all, typical proponents of\nthis opinion being Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya (1959), (1989) and Karel\nWerner (1995). Chattopadhyaya (1989) argues that since\nJayar\u0101\u015bi criticises all philosophical views and schools, he\ncannot be reckoned as an adherent of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata tradition, because one can either be a materialist or\nsceptic; and clearly Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s philosophical views do not\nfit into the typical materialist framework. Karel Werner (1995) seems\nto support such an approach, although with some reservations, but\nwithout any solid rational argument, except for an subjective\nimpression. Recently, also Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2009: 51, 76 n.\n43) follows this line of interpretations and argues that\n\u2018Jayar\u0101\u015bi was not a\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka/Lok\u0101yata\u2019, suggesting that he was not a\nsceptic but represented \u2018a fundamental idealist (solipsist)\nposition\u2019. To this group belong also both A.K. Warder (1956:\n52), who accepts that he was neither a materialist nor sceptic but a\npositivist instead, and K.N. Jayatilleke (1963: 82), who interprets\nhim as \u2018not a sceptic but an absolute nihilist in his\nmetaphysics\u2019 and \u2018a pragmatic materialist\u2019 and\n\u2018a logical sceptic\u2019 (p. 91).\n\nThere could hardly be a better source of information on the true\naffiliation of Jayar\u0101\u015bi than the author himself. He nowhere\nstates in his work that he is a C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata, in\nwhich he does not differ from all other Indian authors who nowhere\nmention their philosophical affiliations in the form: \u2018The\nauthor of the present work is Buddhist\u2019 or \u2018I am a\nfollower of the Ny\u0101ya school\u2019. In most cases, such\naffiliations are communicated through the opening sections, e.g. in\nthe introductory verses (ma\u1e45gal\u00e2cara\u1e47a), or in the\ncolophons, but usually an indirect manner, e.g. by paying homage to\nthe Awakened One (buddha) or to a guru or Mah\u00ea\u015bvara, or\nthrough some other hint, but it is hardly ever done directly, in an\nunequivocal manner. Unfortunately, the preserved text of\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha does not contain any introductory\nverses (probably there were none). The only concealed information in\nthe opening section of the work could be found the first verse that\noccurs in the very beginning which says: \u2018The worldly path\n(laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25) should be followed\u2026/ With respect\nto everyday practice of the world (loka-vyavah\u0101ra), the fool and\nthe wise are similar\u2019 (TUS, p.1.9\u201310 = Franco (1987:\n68\u20136\u20137) \u00a0= Solomon (2010: 1\u20132) = Jha (2013: 2)),\nquoted from some other source, taken as authoritative by\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. The expression \u2018the worldly path\u2019\n(laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25) often occurs as a reference to the\nLok\u0101yata (\u2018the followers of the worldly [practice]\u2019),\ne.g. by Haribhadra in his \u015aVS1.64. Most importantly, however,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi on several occasions quotes verses of\nB\u1e5bhaspati in order to either support his own opinion or to show\nthat there is no disagreement between the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha and the tradition of B\u1e5bhaspati\n\u00a0(cf. Franco (1987: 5)). Further, he explicitly mentions the\nmaterialist teacher by name and refers to him with reverence\n\u2018Honourable B\u1e5bhaspati\u2019 (bhagav\u0101n\nb\u1e5bhaspati\u1e25, TUS, p.45.10\u201311 = Franco (1987: 228.10)\n\u00a0= Solomon (2010: 229) = Jha (2013:\n 187)),[1]\n the reverential term occurring only once in the whole work. This is\nrather unique, for Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not seem to follow any\nauthorities or to quote passages and opinions which he unreservedly\nviews in favourable light. There can hardly be any doubt, that\nJayar\u0101\u015bi placed himself within that tradition and apparently\nacknowledged that he was originally trained within it.\n\nIn the colophon of the treatise (TUP, p. 125.13\u201318 = Franco\n(1987: 7) = Solomon (2010: 98) = Jha (2013: 463\u2013464)),\nJayar\u0101\u015bi explicitly pays homage to B\u1e5bhaspati, here\nreferred to by his traditional epithet \u2018preceptor of gods\u2019\n(sura-guru; cf. Bhattacharya (2009: 25, 51, 76)), and so does the\nauthor refers to himself as \u2018preceptor of deities (gods)\u2019\n(deva-guru):\n\n\n\u2018Even [all] such unshakeable reductio arguments (vikalpa) that\nescaped the attention of the\u00a0 preceptor of gods (i.e.\nB\u1e5bhaspati) find their way into this lucid [treatise] that\ncrushes the conceit of charlatans. This [lucid treatise], titled\n\u201cThe Lion [Destroying] the Delusion of Categories\u201d, which\ncontributes to great advantage and will gain excellent reputation, has\nbeen composed by [me], the preceptor of deities (gods) [known as]\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da \u015ar\u012b\n Jayar\u0101\u015bi.[2]\n [These] reductio arguments of Jayar\u0101\u015bi [found] in this\n[treatise] are efficacious in annihilating the charlatans, are\nelaborated by [Jayar\u0101\u015bi who is] the ocean of knowledge, [and\nare meant to] vanquish disputants.\u2019\n\n\nThe idea which Jayar\u0101\u015bi here expresses is clear: he follows\nthe footsteps of his own preceptor, B\u1e5bhaspati (both\n\u2018preceptor of gods\u2019), developing the latter\u2019s\narguments and augmenting them with his own, more sophisticated.\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi criticises basically all philosophical schools with\ntwo exceptions: the Advaita Ved\u0101nta of \u015aa\u1e45kara and the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school. The reason for being silent\non the tradition of \u015aa\u1e45kara was that the latter was either\ncontemporaneous or posterior to Jayar\u0101\u015bi, but there would\nhave been no reason not to formulate any criticism against the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school, if that had not been\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s own tradition. Further, even though\nJayar\u0101\u015bi is generally very cautious not to express his own\npositive views and theories, there are several exceptions, which\nclearly reveal his materialistic outlook (see \n Section 2.3 Positive Views below).\n\nThere is also some external evidence corroborating to a certain degree\nthe thesis about C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata affiliation of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. Vidy\u0101nanda who first mentions\nJayar\u0101\u015bi brings some interesting details to light (alluded\nto above). In his A\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bat\u012b (A\u1e63S\n29.20\u201336.7), he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers\nwho reject a number of vital principles and claim that \u2018There is\nno [reliable] omniscient authority (t\u012brtha-k\u0101ra), there is\nno [reliable] cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a), there is no\n[reliable] authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any\nkind of [reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each\nother,\u2019 and he quotes a popular verse: \u2018Reasoning is not\nestablished, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a\ncognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral\nlaw (dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available).\nThe [proper] path is that taken by the majority of\n people\u2019[3].\n Whether the verse comes from an unidentified Lok\u0101yata source,\nwhich is not impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayar\u0101\u015bi in\nthe above mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the\nexpression \u2018the worldly path\u2019 (laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25).\nInterestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The\ncategory of such \u2018nihilists\u2019 includes (1) the followers of\nthe Lok\u0101yata school (lauk\u0101yatika, A\u1e63S 29.26), also\nknown as the C\u0101rv\u0101ka (A\u1e63S 30.25), who are associated\nwith the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e.\nperception, and (2) the category of \u2018those who propound the\ndissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din, A\u1e63S 31.2). Vidy\u0101nanda\n(A\u1e63S 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: \u2018Some who are\nthose who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all\nthe categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2)\nall the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not\nestablished)\u2019. Throughout his text, Vidy\u0101nanda keeps these\ntwo traditions \u2013 the Lok\u0101yata and the Tattv\u00f4paplava \u2014\nseparate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically\nrelated, the main difference between them being whether one recognises\nat least one cognitive criterion (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata)\nor none (Jayar\u0101\u015bi). Further on, Vidy\u0101nanda begins the\nexposition of materialism (A\u1e63S, p. 35.22 ff.) which is\ndesignated with a generic term \u2018cognitive criteria-free\nassumption\u2019 (apram\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101 \u2026\ni\u1e63\u1e6di), among which the first variety represents standard\nmaterialists who accept perception as the only cognitive criterion\n(A\u1e63S, p. 35.19\u201337.9), and the second variety concerns\n\u2018those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din) who do not accept any cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) (A\u1e63S, p. 37.10 ff.). Also\nAnantav\u012brya explicitly classifies Jayar\u0101\u015bi as a\nmaterialist by making a pun the the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka: \u2018The\nauthor of \u201c[The Lion Destroying] the Delusion of\nCategories\u2019\u201d says what is charmingly chastised by the\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas\u2019 (SVi\u1e6c, p. 277.19:\ntattv\u00f4paplava-k\u1e5bd \u0101ha \u2013\nc\u0101rv\u0101kai\u015b c\u0101ru carcitam\u2026).\n\nA typical charge against Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s affiliation to\nmaterialists (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata), known for two main\nclaims \u2013 that there is only one cognitive criterion\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception, and the four elements compose\nall the universe, including consciousness \u2013 would the apparent\nparadox: Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to acknowledge neither. This led\nBhattacharya (2017: 353\u2013354) to dispute, on philologically\nimplausible grounds, that Jayar\u0101\u015bi refers to B\u1e5bhaspati\nand the B\u1e5bhaspati-s\u016btra as his own tradition. However, the\nearliest external recipients of Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s ideas, the\nJaina thinkers Vidy\u0101nanda and Anantav\u012brya, importantly\nascribe to Jayar\u0101\u015bi or to his immediate materialist\ntradition a saying that \u2018B\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s aphorisms are\nprimarily meant to refute the opponents with respect to all\n [issues].\u2019[4]\n This serves as an external evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi did\nacknowledge the authority of\u00a0 B\u1e5bhaspati and his aphorisms\nbut interpreted them in the spirit of his own methodological\nscepticism.\n\nThat there must have been some strain among the materialists prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi which both admitted that the world is composed of\nthe four elements and at the same time apparently doubted that there\nis any cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a) is reflected by\nAkala\u1e45ka, who points to the following paradox such a materialist\nwould have to face: \u2018As a result of the absence of cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) [the materialist] cannot ascertain that\nperception, and nothing else, is the only one [cognitive criterion],\nor [ascertain] the essence of cognoscible objects. Since, when other\ncognitive criteria are negated, a [proper] definition of perception\nbecomes inexplicable, what [cognoscible objects] by what [cognitive\ncriteria] could be established or negated, on account of which [one\ncould maintain that] the world is composed of the four\nelements?\u2019 (SVi 4.12, p. 272.3\u20135).\n\nOf significance is that Vidy\u0101nanda puts Jayar\u0101\u015bi on par\nwith the Buddhist doctrine of Emptiness (\u015b\u016bnya-v\u0101da),\nas represented by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and with Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists (brahma-v\u0101da), as three kinds of self-refuting theories\n(T\u015aVA 80.22\u201381.14; 195.14\u201316). This might\ntheoretically be taken as evidence that all three represented\nscepticism. However, since there is no hint that Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists were sceptics at all at that\n time,[5]\n and we have strong evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was not a\nsceptic, what Mills (2018) takes to be the three pillars of skepticism\nin classical India, namely N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Jayar\u0101\u015bi and\n\u015arihar\u1e63a, represented here by a forerunner, cannot be\nclassified as sceptics, despite their commonalities, as noticed by\nVidy\u0101nanda.\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi can be therefore taken as a genuine representative\nof an offshoot of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition,\nprimarily because he himself thought he was a follower of\nB\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s materialist tradition, and probably because he had\noriginally been trained in the materialist system. It also seems very\nlikely that the representatives of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata system occasionally had sceptical inclinations prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, which helped him to abandon typically materialist\nclaims and undertake his sceptical project. However, neither he nor\nhis work can be taken as typical representatives of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school or a first-hand source of\ninformation about that tradition. Despite this, the work remains the\nonly authentic, albeit not \u2018orthodox\u2019 treatise of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition that has come down to\nus.\n",
