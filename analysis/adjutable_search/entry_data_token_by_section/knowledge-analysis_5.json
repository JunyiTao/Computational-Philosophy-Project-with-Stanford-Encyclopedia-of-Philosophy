    "main_text": "The Gettier Problem\n3. The Gettier Problem\n\nFew contemporary epistemologists accept the adequacy of the JTB\nanalysis. Although most agree that each element of the tripartite\ntheory is necessary for knowledge, they do not seem\ncollectively to be sufficient. There seem to be cases of\njustified true belief that still fall short of knowledge. Here is one\nkind of example:\n\n\nImagine that we are seeking water on a hot day. We suddenly see water,\nor so we think. In fact, we are not seeing water but a mirage, but\nwhen we reach the spot, we are lucky and find water right there under\na rock. Can we say that we had genuine knowledge of water? The answer\nseems to be negative, for we were just lucky. (quoted from Dreyfus\n1997: 292)\n\n\nThis example comes from the Indian philosopher Dharmottara, c. 770 CE.\nThe 14th-century Italian philosopher Peter of Mantua\npresented a similar case:\n\n\nLet it be assumed that Plato is next to you and you know him to be\nrunning, but you mistakenly believe that he is Socrates, so that you\nfirmly believe that Socrates is running. However, let it be so that\nSocrates is in fact running in Rome; however, you do not know this.\n(from Peter of Mantua\u2019s De scire et dubitare, given in\nBoh 1985: 95)\n\n\nCases like these, in which justified true belief seems in some\nimportant sense disconnected from the fact, were made famous in Edmund\nGettier\u2019s 1963 paper, \u201cIs Justified True Belief\nKnowledge?\u201d. Gettier presented two cases in which a true belief\nis inferred from a justified false belief. He observed that,\nintuitively, such beliefs cannot be knowledge; it is merely lucky that\nthey are true.\n\nIn honour of his contribution to the literature, cases like these have\ncome to be known as \u201cGettier cases\u201d. Since they appear to\nrefute the JTB analysis, many epistemologists have undertaken to\nrepair it: how must the analysis of knowledge be modified to\naccommodate Gettier cases? This is what is commonly referred to as the\n\u201cGettier problem\u201d.\n\nAbove, we noted that one role of the justification is to rule out\nlucky guesses as cases of knowledge. A lesson of the Gettier problem\nis that it appears that even true beliefs that are justified can\nnevertheless be epistemically lucky in a way inconsistent with\nknowledge.\n\nEpistemologists who think that the JTB approach is basically on the\nright track must choose between two different strategies for solving\nthe Gettier problem. The first is to strengthen the justification\ncondition to rule out Gettier cases as cases of justified belief. This\nwas attempted by Roderick\n Chisholm;[11]\n we will refer to this strategy again in\n \u00a77\n below. The other is to amend the JTB analysis with a suitable fourth\ncondition, a condition that succeeds in preventing justified true\nbelief from being \u201cgettiered\u201d. Thus amended, the JTB\nanalysis becomes a JTB+X account of knowledge, where the\n\u201cX\u201d stands for the needed fourth condition.\n\nLet us consider an instance of this attempt to articulate a\n\u201cdegettiering\u201d condition.\n",
