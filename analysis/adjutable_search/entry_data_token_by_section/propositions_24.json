    "main_text": "Sparse and Abundant Conceptions of Propositions\n10.1 Expressivism and Moral Propositions\n\nOne motivation for accepting a sparse conception of propositions is\nexpressivism in metaethics. \u201cOld-fashioned\u201d expressivists\n(e.g., Ayer and Stevenson) claimed that moral sentences are\nnon-cognitive. We cannot believe that lying in politics is wrong, nor\ncan we have any broadly cognitive attitudes (e.g., disbelief) of the\nform \u2018\\(A\\)-ing that \\(p\\)\u2019 where \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019\ncontains moral terms. If we cannot have such attitudes, then\npresumably there are no moral propositions. (If there were such\npropositions, why wouldn\u2019t there be possible cognitive attitudes\nhaving them as contents?). And if there are no moral propositions,\nthen moral sentences do not express propositions, and so lack\ntruth-value.\n\nWe certainly talk and think as if we have moral beliefs, as if we\nbelieve moral propositions. For the old-fashioned expressivist, then,\nmany of our apparently sincere ordinary claims will have to be\nrejected. Endorsing such a sparse conception of propositions thus\nleads to the surprising consequence all moral sentences lack\ntruth-value.\n\nSome contemporary expressivists (Blackburn 1998, Horwich 1993, Stoljar\n1993) are less averse to moral propositions, moral properties and\nmoral facts. But they take these commitments as\n shallow.[13]\n They accept an abundant conception of propositions, properties, etc.,\nbut combine it with a generous dose of deflationism. There are moral\npropositions, but they are mere shadows of moral declarative\nsentences. (Even if they are shadows of our sentences in some sense,\nthey are not shadows in another sense, at least if the Easy Arguments\nfor mind-independence and abstractness are successful: what is\nmind-independent and abstract is, in a clear sense, not merely a\nshadow of sentences.)\n\nAt least three important questions can be asked about the combination\nof expressivism and deflationism about moral propositions. First, if\nthe expressivist accepts moral propositions, what is the difference\nbetween expressivism and realism? Second, by accepting deflationary\nmoral propositions, can the expressivist avoid the familiar problems\nfor moral realism (and cognitivism) which helped motivate expressivism\nin the first place? Third, can the realist avoid these familiar\nproblems equally well by accepting deflationary moral\npropositions?\n\nThe first question is examined in the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs non-cognitivism.\n We will briefly discuss the other two.\n\nConsider, for example, the Humean argument facing realism, a crude\nversion of which is as follows. If there are moral propositions, then\nmoral judgments are beliefs in moral propositions. But moral judgments\nare intrinsically motivational states, whereas beliefs are not. So,\nthere are no moral propositions. Of course, this argument may be\ncriticized as relying on an overly strong internalism, or a\nsimple-minded speculative psychology. But even when improved, it is\nnot immediately clear how accepting deflationism about moral\npropositions will help the expressivist solve the problem. The moral\npropositions exist, and so why can\u2019t they be believed\nindependently of having any intrinsically motivating states? How can\ntheir deflationary character help defuse this question? Moreover,\nsuppose that deflationism did help the expressivist cope with this\nproblem. Why couldn\u2019t the realist follow suit with her own\nappeal to deflationism?\n\nBlackburn\u2019s supervenience argument is a second argument against\nrealism. Blackburn formulated the argument in terms of moral\nproperties, as follows. If there are moral properties, then they\nsupervene on non-moral properties as a matter of conceptual necessity.\nThat is, in every conceptually possible world, if two things share all\nnon-moral properties, they share all moral properties. But if there\nare moral properties, the pattern of supervenience is not itself\nconceptually necessary. So, even if all \\(P\\)s are \\(M\\)s in fact,\nthere is some conceptually possible world in which there is a \\(P\\)\nwhich isn\u2019t an \\(M\\). Blackburn\u2019s question is this: if\nmoral properties can come apart from non-moral properties\nacross worlds, why can\u2019t they come apart from them\nwithin worlds? That is: what explains the \u201cban on mixed\nworlds\u201d? A similar problem can be formulated for truth as a\nfeature of moral propositions. What explains the ban on conceptually\npossible worlds in which one moral proposition \\(\\ltb x\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\)\nis true, while another moral proposition \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\) is\nfalse, but in which all relevant non-moral propositions \\(\\ltb x\\) is\n\\(P\\gtb\\) and \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(P\\gtb\\) are alike in truth-value? What\nis not immediately clear is, first, how deflationary moral\npropositions will prove useful to the expressivist in answering this\nquestion, and second, how, supposing they do prove useful, why they\nwon\u2019t prove equally useful to the realist.\n\nWhat the expressivist seeks is a conception of propositions (and of\ntruths, facts, and beliefs) substantive enough to explain and validate\nour ordinary realist-seeming discourse but deflationary enough to\navoid the traditional problems for realism. Whether it is possible to\nnavigate the two is the subject of intense scrutiny in contemporary\nmetaethics.\n",
