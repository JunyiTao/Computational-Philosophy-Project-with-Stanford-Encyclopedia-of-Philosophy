Introduction\n\nThe goal of this essay is to survey and analyze the literature on\nstyle in history and philosophy of mathematics. In particular, the\nproblem of how one can philosophically approach the notion of\n\u2018style\u2019 in mathematics will be addressed towards the\nend. Although this is not one of the canonical topics in philosophy of\nmathematics, the presentation will avail itself of relevant\ndiscussions on style in the history and philosophy of science.\n\nSpeaking about mathematics in terms of style is a common enough\nphenomenon. One encounters such appeals to stylistic features in\nmathematics already early in the seventeenth century. Bonaventura\nCavalieri, for instance, as early as 1635 contrasts his indivisibilist\ntechniques with the Archimedean style:\n\nI know in fact that all the things mentioned above [Cavalieri\u2019s\nown theorems obtained by indivisibilist proofs] can be reduced to\nArchimedean style. (In the original Latin: \u201cScio autem\npraefata omnia ad stylum Archimedeum reduci posse.\u201d\n(Cavalieri 1635, 235)).\n\n\nLater in the century it is easier to find examples. For instance\nLeibniz (1701, 270\u201371) writes: \u201cAnalysis does not differ\nfrom Archimedes\u2019 style except for the expressions that are more\ndirect and more appropriate to the art of discovery\u201d (French:\n\u201cL\u2019analyse ne diff\u00e8re du style\nd\u2019Archim\u00e8de que dans les expressions, qui sont plus\ndirectes et plus conformes \u00e0 l\u2019art\nd\u2019inventer\u201d). It is an interesting fact that such\noccurrences predate the generalized use of the notion of style in\npainting, which only dates from the 1660s (sporadic occurrences, as\npointed out in Sauerl\u00e4nder 1983, are also found in the sixteenth\ncentury). Earlier in the seventeenth century the word of choice in\npainting was \u201cmani\u00e8re\u201d (see Panofsky 1924;\nEnglish translation (1968, 240)). Here are a couple of additional\nexamples from the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Chasles in\nhis Aper\u00e7u historique (1837) speaking about Monge\nsays:\n\nHe initiated a new way of writing and talking about this science.\nStyle, in fact, is so intimately welded to the spirit of a methodology\nthat it must advance in step with it; likewise, if it has anticipated\nit, style must of necessity play a powerful influence over it and over\nthe general progress of science. (Chasles, 1837, \u00a718, 207)\n\n\nAnother example comes from Edward\u2019s evaluation of\nDedekind\u2019s approach to mathematics:\n\nKronecker\u2019s brilliance cannot be doubted. Had he had a tenth of\nDedekind\u2019s ability to formulate and express his ideas clearly,\nhis contribution to mathematics might have been even greater than\nDedekind\u2019s. As it is however, his brilliance, for the most part,\ndied with him. Dedekind\u2019s legacy, on the other hand, consisted\nnot only of important theorems, examples, and concepts, but of a whole\nstyle of mathematics that has been an inspiration to each successive\ngeneration. (Edwards 1980, 20)\n\n\nObviously, one could pile up quotations of the same kind (see, among\nothers, Cohen 1992, de Gandt 1986, Dhombres 1993, Epple 1997,\nFerreir\u00f3s and Reck 2020, Fleckenstein 1955, Granger 2003,\nH\u00f8yrup 2005, Laugwitz 1993, Novy 1981, Reck 2009, Tappenden\n2005, Weiss 1939, Wisan 1981) but that would not be very\ninteresting. Even in mathematics style ranges from \u2018individual\nstyles\u2019 to \u2018national styles\u2019 to \u2018epistemic\nstyles\u2019, among others. What is needed is first of all an\nunderstanding of the major contexts in which appeal to\n\u2018style\u2019 in mathematics occurs, although this essay will\nnot contain much discussion of \u2018individual styles\u2019\n(examples of such would include, to follow a suggestion by Enrico\nBombieri, the \u201cvery personal\u201d styles of Euler,\nRamanujan, Riemann, Serre and A. Weil).\n\nIn many cases the appeal to the notion of style is conceived as\nborrowed from the fine arts and some cases will be discussed\nforthwith. Harwood 1993 claims that \u201cthe concept of style was\ndevised in order to classify cultural patterns observed in the study\nof fine arts\u201d. Wessely 1991 talks about \u201ctransferring that\nconcept [of style] to the history of science\u201d (265). While this\nmight perhaps be true for the twentieth century (see also Kwa 2012),\none should keep in mind, as was pointed out above, that this claim\nmust be qualified for the seventeenth century.\n2. Style as a central concept in comparative cultural histories\n\nNotwithstanding the previous caveats, it is a fact that some major\ntwentieth century appeals to the category of style in mathematics have\ndone so in reference to the arts. This is especially true of those\nauthors who were motivated by accounting in a unified way for the\ncultural production of mankind and who saw thus a uniformity in the\nprocesses of scientific and artistic production. It was in such\ncontext that Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West\n(1919, 1921) attempted a morphology of world history and claimed that\nthe history of mathematics was characterized by different stylistic\nepochs which depended on the culture that produced it:\n\nThe Style of any mathematics which comes into being, depends wholly on\nthe Culture in which it is rooted, the sort of mankind it is that\nponders it. The soul can bring its inherent possibilities to\nscientific development, can manage them practically, can attain the\nhighest levels in its treatment of them\u2014but is quite impotent to\nalter them. The idea of the Euclidean geometry is actualized in the\nearliest forms of Classical ornament, and that of the Infinitesimal\nCalculus in the earliest forms of Gothic architecture, centuries\nbefore the first learned mathematicians of the respective Cultures\nwere born. (Spengler 1919, 59)\n\n\nNot only are there parallels between mathematics and other artistic\nproductions of a culture. Relying on Goethe\u2019s statement that the\ncomplete mathematician \u201cfeels within himself the beauty of the\ntrue\u201d and on Weierstrass\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cwho\nis not at the same time a bit of a poet will never be a true\nmathematician\u201d, Spengler went on to characterize mathematics\nitself as an art:\n\nMathematics, then, is an art. As such it has its styles and style\nperiods. It is not, as the layman and the philosopher (who is in this\nmatter a layman too) imagine, substantially unalterable, but subject\nlike every art to unnoticed changes from epoch to epoch. (Spengler\n1919, 62)\n\n\nThe most extensive treatment that builds on the parallel between art\nand mathematics and exploits the notion of style as a central category\nfor an analysis of the history of mathematics is that of Max Bense. In\na book appropriately entitled Konturen einer Geistesgeschichte der\nMathematik (1946), Bense devoted a whole chapter (ch. 2) to\narticulating how the notion of style applies to mathematics. For Bense\nstyle is form:\n\nFor style is form, essential form, and we designate this form as the\n\u201cAesthetic\u201d, if it controls categorially the sensible, a\nmaterial. (Bense 1946, 118)\n\n\nBense saw the history of art and the history of mathematics as aspects\nof the history of mind [Geistesgeschichte]. In fact\n\u201cstyle is given wherever the human imagination and the capacity\nof expression arrive to creation\u201d. Bense was certainly prone to\ndraw parallels between styles in the history of art and styles in\nmathematics (he especially treated the baroque and the romantic styles\nin his book) but he kept, in opposition to Spengler, the nature of art\nand mathematics separate. Indeed he recognized that a stylistic\nhistory of mathematics could not be reduced \u201cto a coincidence\nbetween certain mathematical formal tendencies and the great\nartistic-worldviews-spiritual styles of single epochs such as the\nRenaissance, Classicism, the Baroque or Romanticism\u201d (p.132; see\nFleckenstein 1955 and Wisan 1981 for more recent parallels between the\nbaroque in art and the mathematics of the seventeenth century). He\nreferred to Felix Klein\u2019s \u201cElementarmathematik vom\nh\u00f6heren Standpunkte aus\u201d to point out that certain\nlines of development characterized by Klein could be seen as pointing\nto styles in the history of the development of mathematics (see Klein\n1924, 91).\n\nAttempts such as Spengler\u2019s and Bense\u2019s appeal certainly\nto those theoreticians who would like to use the category of style as\na tool for describing, and perhaps accounting for, cultural patterns.\nHowever, they leave the reader who is knowledgeable in mathematics\nand/or history of art skeptical on account of the usually far-fetched\nparallels that are supposed to provide evidence for the account. Of\ncourse, this is not to reject ultimately the approach or the\nusefulness of the appropriateness of the category of style in\nmathematics but one would like its use to be more directly related to\naspects of mathematical practice. A recent attempt at connecting the notions of style in literature and in mathematics is van Bengedem and van Kerkhove 2014.\n\nIn general, one can distinguish two types of theorizing that can be\nassociated with such attempts. The first is purely descriptive, or\ntaxonomic, and satisfies itself with showing certain common patterns\nbetween a certain area of thought, such as mathematics, and other\ncultural products of a certain society. The second approach\npresupposes the first but also enquires after the causes that account\nfor the presence of a certain style of thought or production and\nnormally tries to ascribe it to psychological or sociological factors.\nIn Spengler and Bense there are elements of both although the emphasis\nis more on the parallels than on the causes underlying or explaining\nthe parallels.\n\nAttempts to extend the use of the concept of style in art to other\ndomains of human endeavors abound in the early twentieth century. A\nwell-known case is Mannheim\u2019s sociological attempt to\ncharacterize styles of thought within different social groups\n(Mannheim 1928). While Mannheim had not excluded scientific thought\nfrom the realm of sociological analysis of knowledge, he did not\nactively pursue such an analysis. By contrast, Ludwik Fleck practiced\na sociological analysis of science in which \u201cstyles of\nthought\u201d played a central role. Fleck focused however on\nmedicine (Fleck 1935).\n\nHere it is important to point out that the notion of thought style has\nreceived, by and large, two different developments in contemporary\nresearch, which also affect mathematics. First, there is the notion\nencountered in Fleck. Depending on how generous one wants to be in\ndrawing connections, one could see this approach to styles of thought\nto be related to the later work by Kuhn, Foucault and Hacking (see\nbelow for a discussion of Hacking). There is however a different way\nof thinking about styles of thought, which usually goes under the name\nof cognitive styles. This is an area of interest to cognitive\npsychologists and mathematical educators (for an overview of the\npsychological research in this area see Riding 2000 and Stenberg and\nGrigorenko 2001). Here the focus is on the psychological make up of\nthe individual who displays preference for a certain cognitive style\neither in learning, understanding or thinking about mathematics (i.e.,\nprocessing and organizing mathematical information). The old\ndistinction between visual and analytic mathematicians emphasized by\nPoincar\u00e9 (see Poincar\u00e9 1905) is still part of the\npicture although there are a great variety of models and\nclassifications. For an historical overview and a theoretical proposal\ncentered on mathematics see Borromeo Ferri 2005.\n\nIn the area of history and philosophy of mathematics there are no book\nlength accounts of mathematical styles that explain the emergence of a\ncertain style with sociological or psychological categories (although\nNetz 1999 has been of interest to theoreticians of style as an attempt\nat a cognitive history of an important segment of Greek mathematics).\nThis is in contrast to books in history of the natural sciences such\nas Harwood 1993, whose goal is to explain the emergence of the thought\nstyle of the German genetics community through sociological arguments.\nThe closest one comes to such an account is Bieberbach\u2019s\nconception of style in mathematics as dependent on psychological and\nracial factors. He will be discussed in the next section on national\nstyles.\n3. National styles in mathematics\n\nSomething less ambitious than the previous attempts at a general\nhistory of human cultural productions or far-reaching parallels\nbetween art and mathematics consists in a use of the notion of style\nas an historiographical category in the history of mathematics without\nparticular reference to art or other human cultural activities. If one\ngoes back to the beginning of the twentieth century, one finds that\n\u201cnational styles\u201d were often referred to for categorizing\ncertain features characterizing mathematical production that seemed to\nfall squarely within national lines. In the history of science such\ncases of \u201cnational styles\u201d have often been studied. One\nshould recall here J. Harwood\u2019s book Styles of Scientific\nThought (1993) and the contributions Nye 1986, Maienschein 1991,\nand Elwick 2007. A case of interest for mathematics is the opposition\nbetween French and German style in mathematics studied by Herbert\nMehrtens.\n\nMehrtens (1990a, 1990b, 1996) describes, in terms of styles, the\nconflict in mathematics between \u201cformalists\u201d and\n\u201clogicists\u201d on the one hand and\n\u201cintuitionists\u201d on the other hand as a battle between two\nconceptions of mathematics (see also Gray 2008 for a critical take on\nof Mehrtens\u2019s approach while emphasizing the\n\u201cmodernist\u201d transformation of mathematics). Hilbert and\nPoincar\u00e9 are used as paradigms for the sources of the\nopposition that later led to the Hilbert-Brouwer foundational debate\nin the 1920s (on the history of the Brouwer-Hilbert debate see Mancosu\n1998). Mehrtens also points out that this opposition did not\nnecessarily run along national lines as, for instance, Klein could be\nseen as close to Poincar\u00e9. Indeed, a certain internationalism\nin mathematics was dominant at the end of the nineteenth century and\nthe early part of the twentieth century. However, WWI was to change\nthe situation and gave rise to strong nationalistic conflicts. A\ncentral player in \u2018nationalizing\u2019 the opposition was\nPierre Duhem who opposed the esprit de finesse of the French\nto the esprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie of the Germans:\n\nTo start from clear principles\u2026then to make progress step by\nstep, patiently, painstakingly, at a pace that the rules of deductive\nlogic discipline with extreme severity: this is what German genius\nexcels at; the German esprit is essentially esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie\u2026The Germans are geometers, they\nare not subtle [fin]; the Germans completely lack esprit\nde finesse. (Duhem 1915, 31\u201332)\n\n\nDuhem intended his model to apply to the natural sciences but also to\nmathematics. Kleinert 1978 showed that Duhem\u2019s book was only\npart of a reaction by French scientists to the 1914 declaration\n\u201cAufruf an die Kulturwelt\u201d signed by 93 prominent\nGerman intellectuals. This led to the so called \u201cKrieg der\nGeister\u201d in which the polarization between Germany and\nFrance reached the point not only of criticizing the specific ways of\nmaking use of science (say practicing science with military aims) but\nalso led to a characterization of scientific knowledge as essentially\ndetermined by national characteristics. In fact this strategy was\nbasically used by the French in criticizing \u201cLa Science\nAllemande\u201d but it will, twenty years later, be used by the\nGermans with the replacement of \u201cnational\u201d by\n\u201crassisch\u201d. The best known case is that of\n\u201cDeutsche Physik\u201d but here the focus will be on\n\u201cDeutsche Mathematik\u201d (see also Segal 2003 and\nPeckhaus 2005).\n\nThe most extreme form of this ideological confrontation, which\nironically reversed the role of Germans and French in the comparison\nused by Duhem, is found in the writings of Ludwig Bieberbach, the\nfounder of the so-called \u201cDeutsche Mathematik\u201d.\nTaking his start from the dismissal of Landau from the mathematical\nFaculty in G\u00f6ttingen, Bieberbach tried to rationalize why the\nstudents had forced Landau\u2019s dismissal. In a\nKurzreferat for his talk he summarized his aims as\nfollows:\n\nMy considerations aim at describing the influence for my own science,\nmathematics, of the people [Volkstum], of blood and race, on\nthe style of creation by using several examples. For a\nnational-socialist this requires of course no proof at all. It is\nrather an insight of great obviousness. For all our actions and\nthoughts are rooted in blood and race and receives from them their\nspecificity. That there are such styles is also familiar to every\nmathematician. (Bieberbach, 1934a, 235)\n\n\nIn his two papers 1934b and 1934c, he claimed that the mathematics\npracticed by Landau was foreign to the German spirit. He compared\nErhard Schmidt and Landau and claimed that in the first case\n\nThe system is directed towards the objects, the construction is\norganic. By contrast, Landau\u2019s style is foreign to reality,\nantagonistic to life, inorganic. The style of Erhard Schmidt is\nconcrete, intuitive and at the same time it satisfies all the logical\ndemands. (Bieberbach 1934b, 237)\n\n\nOther important oppositions brought forward by Bieberbach as\n\u201cevidence\u201d for his claims were Gauss vs. Cauchy-Goursat on\ncomplex numbers; Poincar\u00e9 vs. Maxwell in mathematical physics;\nLandau vs. Schmidt; and Jacobi vs. Klein.\n\nBy relying on the psychology of types by the notorious Marburg\npsychologist Jaensch he then went on to oppose Jewish/Latin and German\npsychological types. The fault line, so to speak, was between a\nmathematics driven by intuition, typical of German mathematics, and\nthe formalism allegedly espoused by the Jewish/Latin mathematicians.\nObviously, Bieberbach was forced to do a lot of gerrymandering to make\nsure that important German mathematicians did not end up on the wrong\nside of the equation (see what he says of Weierstrass, Euler and\nHilbert). The basis of these mathematical differences was to be found\nin racial characteristics:\n\nIn my considerations I have tried to show that in mathematical\nactivity there are issues of style and that therefore blood and race\nare influential in the way of mathematical creation. (Bieberbach\n1934c, 358\u2013359)\n\n\nThe reason for discussing Bieberbach in this context is that his case\nexemplifies an attempt at rooting the notion of style in something\nmore fundamental, such as national characteristics interpreted in\nterms of psychology and racial features. Moreover, his case is also of\ninterest as his approach to style shows how such theorizing can be put\nin the service of a twisted political program.\n\nFortunately, talk of national styles in mathematics does not have to\ncarry with it all the implications that were found in Bieberbach.\nIndeed, when historians today refer to national styles they do so\nwithout the nationalism that motivated the older contributions.\nRather, they are concerned with describing how \u201clocal\u201d\ncultures play a role in the constitution of knowledge (see also Larvor\n2016). While increased mobility and email communications make it\nharder for national styles to thrive, special political conditions\nmight also favor the persistence of such a style. This is the case,\nfor instance, of the Russian style in algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. As Robert MacPherson has pointed out to the\nauthor, this case of national style would deserve a more extensive\ninvestigation and it would be interesting to study how the fall of the\nSoviet Union impacted this style. By contrast, an instance of a\nnational style that has been extensively studied is that of Italian\nstyle algebraic geometry. This case has been studied with care by a\nnumber of historians of mathematics and in particular by Aldo\nBrigaglia (see also Casnati et al. 2016). For instance in a recent\narticle, Brigaglia writes:\n\nMoreover, the Italian school was not strictly a national\n\u2018school,\u2019 but rather a working style and a methodology,\nprincipally based in Italy, but with representatives to be found\nelsewhere in the world. (Brigaglia 2001, 189)\n\n\nThe scare quotes highlight the problem of trying to grasp the\ndifference between \u2018schools\u2019, \u2018styles\u2019,\n\u2018methodologies\u2019 etc. (see Rowe 2003) There has been no\nattempt to discuss analytically the notion of \u2018national\nstyle\u2019 for the history of mathematics\u2014in any case, nothing\ncomparable to what Harwood 1993 does in the first chapter of his book.\nThe situation is also complicated by the fact that different authors\nuse different terminologies while perhaps referring to the same issue.\nFor instance, there has been much talk recently of \u2018images of\nmathematics\u2019 (Corry 2004a, 2004b, Bottazzini and Dahan\nDalmedico, 2001). In the last section, we shall return to reflect on\nthese different usages of style in the historiographical literature on\nmathematics and how they compare with those in the natural\nsciences.\n4. Mathematicians on style\n\nSo far the discussion has focused on style as a tool for philosophers\nof culture and for historians of mathematics. But do mathematicians\nrecognize the existence of styles in mathematics? Once again, it would\nnot be difficult to give isolated quotes where mathematicians might\ntalk about the style of the ancients or the abstract algebraic style\nor categorial style. In logical work one finds occurrences of style in\nsuch denominations as \u2018Bishop-style constructive\nmathematics\u2019. What are difficult to find are systematic\ndiscussions by mathematicians of the notion of style. The case of\nBieberbach was mentioned above but no detailed discussion of the\nexamples he adduced as evidence of differences in style was given\nthere, partly because they are so twisted by his desire to provide\nsupport for his ideological point of view that there are reasons to\ndoubt that one would gain much by way of an analysis of his case\nstudies.\n\nAn interesting contribution is an article by Claude Chevalley from\n1935 titled \u201cVariations du style\nmath\u00e9matique\u201d. Chevalley takes the existence of\nstyle for granted. He begins as follows:\n\nMathematical style, just like literary style, is subject to important\nfluctuations in passing from one historical age to another. Without\ndoubt, every author possesses an individual style; but one can also\nnotice in each historical age a general tendency that is quite well\nrecognizable. This style, under the influence of powerful mathematical\npersonalities, is subject every once in a while to revolutions that\ninflect writing, and thus thought, for the following periods.\n(Chevalley 1935, 375)\n\n\nHowever, Chevalley did not try to reflect on the notion of style here\ninvolved. Rather he was concerned to show by means of an important\nexample the features of the transition between two styles of doing\nmathematics that had characterized the passage from nineteenth century\nmathematics to twentieth century approaches. The first style described\nby Chevalley is the Weierstrassian style, \u2018the style of\n\u03b5\u2019. It finds its \u2018raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre\u2019 in the need to rigorize the calculus\nmoving away from the unclarities related to such notions as\n\u201cinfinitely small quantity\u201d etc. The development of\nanalysis in the nineteenth century (analytic functions, Fourier\nseries, Gauss\u2019 theories of surfaces, Lagrangian equations in\nmechanics etc.) led to a critical analysis\n\nof the algebraic-analytical framework in front of which they found\nthemselves; and it is from this critical examination that a completely\nnew mathematical style was to emerge. (Chevalley 1935, 377)\n\n\nChevalley went on to single out the discovery of a continuous nowhere\ndifferentiable function, due to Weierstrass, as the most important\nelement of this revolution. As Weierstrass\u2019 function can be\ngiven in terms of a Fourier expansion with a quite normal appearance,\nit became obvious that many demonstrations in mathematics assumed\nclosure condition that needed to be rigorously established. The\nconcept of limit, as defined by Weierstrass, was the powerful tool\nthat allowed such investigations. The reconstruction of analysis\npursued by Weierstrass and his followers turned out to be not only\nfoundationally successful but also mathematically fruitful. Here is\nhow close Chevalley comes to characterizing this style:\n\nThe use on the part of the mathematicians of this school of the\ndefinition of limit due to Weierstrass can be noticed in the external\nappearance of their writings. First of all, in the intensive, and at\ntimes immoderate, usage of the \u201c\u03b5\u201d equipped with\nvarious indexes (this is the reason why we have spoken above of a\nstyle of the \u201c\u03b5\u201ds). Secondly, in the progressive\nreplacement of equality for inequality in the demonstrations as well\nas in the results (approximation theorems; upper bound theorems;\ntheory of increase, etc.). This last aspect will occupy us for it will\nmake us understand the reasons that forced the overcoming of the\nWeierstrassian style of thinking. Indeed, while equality is a relation\nthat is meaningful for mathematical beings whatsoever, inequality can\nonly be applied to objects equipped with an order relation,\npractically only on the real numbers. In this way one was led, in\norder to embrace all of analysis, to reconstruct it entirely from the\nreal numbers and from functions of real numbers. (Chevalley 1935,\n378\u2013379)\n\n\nOut of this approach one could also build the system of complex\nnumbers as pair of reals and the points of spaces in n\ndimensions as n-tuples of reals. This gave the impression\nthat mathematics could be unified by means of constructive definitions\nstarting from the real numbers. However, things went differently and\nChevalley tries to account for the reasons that led one to give up\nthis \u201cconstructive\u201d approach in favor of an axiomatic\napproach. Various algebraic theories, such as group theory gave rise\nto relationships that could not be constructed starting from the real\nnumbers. Moreover, the constructive definition of complex numbers was\nequivalent to fixing an arbitrary reference system and thus endowing\nthese objects with properties that hid their real nature. On the other\nhand one was familiar with Hilbert\u2019s axiomatization of geometry\nwhich, although rigorous, did not have the character of artificiality\nof the constructive theories. In this case the entities are not\nconstructed but rather defined through the axioms. This approach\ndeveloped to influence analysis itself. Chevalley mentioned the theory\nof Lebesgue integral that was obtained by first setting down what\nproperties the integral had to satisfy and then showing that a domain\nof objects satisfying those properties existed. The same idea was used\nby Frechet by setting down the properties that were to characterize\nthe operation of limit thereby arriving at a general theory of\ntopological spaces. Another example mentioned by Chevalley is the\naxiomatization of field theory given by Steinitz in 1910. Chevalley\nconcluded that\n\nThe axiomatization of theories has modified very deeply the style of\ncontemporary mathematical writings. First of all, for every result\nobtained, one always needs to find out which ones are the strictly\nindispensable properties needed to establish it. One will seriously\naddress the problem of giving a minimal demonstration of such result\nand to that effect one will need to delimit exactly in which domain of\nmathematics one is operating in such a way as to reject methods that\nare foreign to this domain since the latter are likely to bring about\nthe introduction of useless hypotheses. (Chevalley 1935, 382)\n\n\nMoreover, the constitution of domains that are perfectly suited to\ncertain operations allows one to establish general theorems on the\nobjects under consideration. In this way one can characterize the\noperations of infinitesimal analysis algebraically but without any of\nthe na\u00efvet\u00e9 which had characterized the previous algebraic\napproaches.\n\nChevalley\u2019s article is a precious source from a contemporary\nmathematician on the topic of style. He forcefully shows the\ndifference between the late nineteenth century arithmetization of\nanalysis and the early twentieth century axiomatic-algebraic approach.\nHowever, it has its limitations. The notion of style is not thematized\nas such and it is not clear that the features adduced to explain the\nparticular historical events might provide the general tools for\nanalyzing other transitions in mathematical style. But perhaps that\nshould, if anything, be the task of a philosopher of mathematics (for\na detailed analysis of Chevalley\u2019s approach to style see Rabouin\n2017; for further developments, focused on Bourbaki style, see Marquis 2021).\n5. The locus of style\n\nIn a book entitled \u201cIntroducci\u00f3n al estilo\nmatematico\u201d (1971) the Spanish philosopher Javier de Lorenzo\nattempted to write a history of mathematics (admittedly partial) in\nterms of style. Although by 1971 Granger\u2019s work, to be discussed\nin section 5, had already appeared, de Lorenzo was not aware of it and\nthe only source on style he uses is Chevalley\u2019s article. Indeed\nthis book is merely an extension of Chevalley\u2019s study to include\nmany more \u2018styles\u2019 that have appeared in the history of\nmathematics. The list of mathematical styles studied by de Lorenzo is\nthe following:\n\nGeometric style;\nPoetic style;\nCossic style;\nCartesian-algebraic style;\nThe style of indivisibles;\nOperational style;\nEpsilon style;\nSynthetic vs analytical styles in geometry;\nAxiomatic style;\nFormal style.\n\n\nThe general set up reminds one much of Chevalley\u2019s approach and\none would look in vain in de Lorenzo\u2019s book for a satisfactory\naccount of what style is. It is true that there are some interesting\nobservations about the role of language in determining a style but a\ngeneral philosophical analysis is missing. There is however an\nimportant point to be emphasized concerning the treatment given by\nChevalley and de Lorenzo, which seems to point to an important feature\nof the use of \u2018style\u2019 in mathematics.\n\nIn his paper \u201cDe la cat\u00e9gorie de style en histoire\ndes sciences\u201d (Gayon 1996), and in the later Gayon 1999,\nJean Gayon presents the different usages of \u2018style\u2019 in the\nhistoriography of science as falling between two camps (in a way he\nfollows Hacking 1992 here). First, there is the usage of\n\u2018scientific style\u2019 on the part of those who pursue a\n\u2018local history of science\u2019. Usually this type of analysis\nfocuses on \u2018local groups or schools\u2019 or on\n\u2018nations\u2019. For instance, this type of history deemphasizes\nthe universal component of knowledge and stresses the difficulties\ninvolved in translating experiments from one setting to another. Such\ndifficulties are shown to depend on the \u2018local\u2019\ntraditions, which include specific technical and theoretical know-how\nwhich is \u201cfundamental to setting-up, realizing, and analyzing\nthe outcome of those experiments\u201d (Corry 2004b) Secondly, there\nis the use of \u2018scientific style\u2019 exemplified in works such\nas Crombie\u2019s 1994 \u2018Styles of Scientific Thinking in the\nEuropean Tradition\u2019. Crombie enumerates the following scientific\nstyles:\n\npostulation in the axiomatic mathematical sciences\nexperimental exploration and measurement of complex detectable\nrelations\nhypothetical modelling\nordering a variety by comparison and taxonomy\nstatistical analysis of populations, and\nhistorical derivation of genetic development (quoted from Hacking\n1996, 65)\n\n\nGayon remarks that this latter notion of \u2018style\u2019 could be\nreplaced by \u2018method\u2019 and that \u2018the styles discussed\nhere have nothing to do with local styles\u2019. He also remarks that\nwhen it comes to local styles the groups that act as sociological\nsupport for such analyses are either \u2018research groups\u2019 or\n\u2018nations\u2019. There has been much emphasis in recent history\nof the experimental sciences on such local factors (see, for instance,\nGavroglu 1990 for the \u2018styles of reasoning\u2019 of two low\ntemperature laboratories, that of Dewar (London) and that of\nKamerlingh Onnes (Leiden)).\n\nHistorians of mathematics are now attempting to apply such\nhistoriographical approaches also to pure mathematics. A recent\nattempt in this direction is the work of Epple in terms of\n\u2018epistemic configurations\u2019 such as his recent article on\nAlexander and Reidemeister\u2019s early work in knot theory (Epple\n2004; but see also Rowe 2003 and 2004, and Epple 2011). The support\ngroups for such investigations are not referred to as\n\u2018schools\u2019 but rather as \u2018mathematical\ntraditions\u2019 or \u2018mathematical cultures\u2019.\n\nWhat about the \u2018methodological\u2019 notion of style \u00e0\nla Crombie? Have historians of mathematics made much use of this?\nApart from numerous treatments of the first style (axiomatic method),\nthere is not much in this area but an interesting historical\ncontribution is Goldstein\u2019s work on Frenicle de Bessy (2001).\nShe argues that the pure mathematics as practiced by Frenicle de Bessy\nhad much in common with the Baconian style of experimental science.\nPerhaps one should mention here that experimental mathematics is now a\nblossoming field which might soon find its historian (see Baker 2008\nfor a philosophical account of experimental mathematics and\nS\u00f8rensen 2016 for an analysis in terms of mathematical\ncultures). This tends to be a topic of high interest for philosophers,\nas it impinges on issues of mathematical method. The problem can be\nsimply put as follows: in addition to what Crombie lists as\nmethodological style (a) [axiomatic], what other styles are pursued in\nmathematical practice? Corfield 2003 touches upon the problem in the\nintroduction to his book \u201cTowards a philosophy of\n\u2018real\u2019 mathematics\u201d when he, referring to the\nCrombie list above, says:\n\nHacking applauds Crombie\u2019s inclusion of (a) as \u2018restoring\nmathematics to the sciences\u2019 (Hacking 1996) after the logical\npositivists\u2019 separation, and extends the number of its styles to\ntwo by admitting the algorithmic style of Indian and Arabic\nmathematics. I am happy with this line of argument, especially if it\nprevents mathematics been seen as an activity totally unlike any\nother. Indeed, mathematicians also engage in styles (b) (see chapter\n3), (c) and (d) [7] and along the lines of (e) mathematicians are\ncurrently analyzing the statistics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta\nfunction. (Corfield 2003, 19)\n\n\nIn note 7 Corfield mentions John Thompson\u2019s comment to the\neffect that the classification of finite simple groups is an exercise\nin taxonomy.\n\nIt is not the goal of this essay to address squarely the vast set of\nissues that emerge from the previous quotes. But it should be pointed\nout that these issues represent a fresh and stimulating territory for\na descriptive epistemology of mathematics and that some work has\nalready been carried out in this direction (see Etcheverr\u00eda\n1996; van Bendegem 1998; Baker 2008).\n\nFinally, how to put together the \u2018local\u2019 and\n\u2018methodological\u2019 styles with what is found in Chevalley\nand de Lorenzo? In the case of mathematics there is good evidence that\nthe most natural locus for \u2018styles\u2019 falls, so to speak, in\nbetween these two categories. Indeed, by and large, mathematical\nstyles go beyond any local community defined in simpler sociological\nterms (nationality, direct membership in a school etc.) and are such\nthat the support group can only be characterized by the specific\nmethod of enquiry pursued. On the other hand, the method is not so\nuniversal as to be identifiable as one of the six methods described by\nCrombie or in the extended list given by Hacking. Here are some\npossible examples, where the names attached to each position should\nnot mislead the reader into thinking that one is merely dealing with\n\u2018individual\u2019 styles.\n\nDirect vs. indirect techniques in geometry (Cavalieri and\nTorricelli vs. Archimedes)\nAlgebraic vs. geometrical approaches in analysis in the\nseventeenth and the eighteenth century (Euler vs. McLaurin)\nGeometrical vs. analytical approaches in complex analysis in the\nnineteenth century (Riemann vs. Weierstrass)\nConceptual vs. computational approaches in algebraic number theory\n(Dedekind vs. Kronecker)\nstructural vs intuitive styles in algebraic geometry (German\nschool vs. Italian school)\n\n\nOf course, it might just be the case that also in history and\nphilosophy of science there are \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels of\nstyle such as the ones being described here (one example that comes to\nmind is \u2018Newtonian style\u2019 in mathematical physics) but the\nfact that Jean Gayon did not detect them as central seems to point to\nthe fact that the situation in history and philosophy of mathematics\nis quite different, as these \u2018intermediate\u2019 styles are\nthose that have been more thoroughly discussed and that correspond to\nthe styles analyzed by Chevalley and de Lorenzo. Moreover, discussions\nof local mathematical cultures tend to do without the concept of\nstyle.\n6. Towards an epistemology of style\n\nThe problem of an epistemology of style can perhaps be roughly put as\nfollows. Are the stylistic elements present in mathematical discourse\ndevoid of cognitive value and so only part of the coloring of\nmathematical discourse or can they be seen as more intimately related\nto its cognitive content? The notion of coloring here comes from Frege\nwho distinguished in \u201cThe thought\u201d between the truth\ncondition of a statement and those aspects of the statement which\nmight provide information about the state of mind of the speaker or\nhearer but do not contribute to its truth conditions. In natural\nlanguage, typical elements of coloring are expressions of regret such\nas \u201cunfortunately\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s\nsnowing\u201d has the same truth conditions as \u201cit\u2019s\nsnowing\u201d and \u201cunfortunately\u201d, in the first sentence,\nis only part of the coloring. Jacques and Monique Dubucs have\ngeneralized this distinction to proofs in \u201cLa couleur des\npreuves\u201d (Dubucs and Dubucs 1994) where they deal with the\nproblem of a \u2018rhetoric of mathematics\u2019, a problem quite\nclose to that of an analysis of style. Dubbing traditional rhetoric as\n\u2018residualist\u2019, for it takes into account only phenomena of\nnon-cognitive significance such as ornamentation etc. of the\nmathematical text but leaves the object (such as the content of a\ndemonstration) untouched, they explored the options for a more\nambitious \u201crhetoric of mathematics\u201d.\n\nOne can thus begin to articulate the first position that can be\ndefended with respect to the epistemological significance of style. It\nis a position that denies style any essential cognitive role and\nreduces it to a phenomenon of subjective coloring. According to this\nposition, stylistic variations would only reveal superficial\ndifferences of expression that leave the content of discourse\nuntouched.\n\nTwo more ambitious positions have been defended in the literature\nconcerning the cognitive content of style. The first seems to be\ncompatible with a form of Platonism or realism in mathematics whereas\nthe second is definitely opposed to it. What is being alluded to are\nthe two main proposals available in the literature, namely those of\nGranger 1968 and Hacking 1992, which will now be briefly\ndescribed.\n\nGranger\u2019s Essay of a philosophy of style (Essai\nd\u2019une philosophie du style 1968) is the most systematic and\nworked-out effort to develop a theory of style for mathematics.\nGranger\u2019s program is so ambitious and rich that a thorough\ndiscussion of the structure of his book and of his detailed analyses\nwould need a paper by itself (see also Benis-Sinaceur 2010). Due to\nlimitation of space, the aim here is to give just a rough idea of what\nthe project consists in and to show that the epistemological role of\nstyle defended by Ganger is compatible with a realism about\nmathematical entities or structures.\n\n\nGranger\u2019s aim is to provide an analysis of \u2018scientific\npractice\u2019. He defines practice as \u201can activity considered\nwith its complex context, and in particular the social conditions\nwhich give it meaning in a world effectively experienced\n(v\u00e9cu)\u201d (1968, 6). Science he defines as\n\u201cconstruction of abstract models, consistent and effective, of\nthe phenomena\u201d (13). Thus, a scientific practice has both\n\u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019 components and\n\u2018individual\u2019 components. The analysis of scientific\npractice requires at least three types of investigations:\n\nThere are many ways of structuring, by means of models, a certain\nphenomenon; and the same models can be applied to different phenomena.\nMoreover, scientific constructions, including mathematical ones,\nreveal a certain \u201cstructural unity\u201d. Both of these aspects\nwill be the theme of a stylistic analysis.\nThe second investigation concerns a \u2018scientific\ncharacteriology\u2019, aimed a studying the psychological components\nwhich are relevant in the individuation of scientific practice;\nThe third investigation concerns the study of the\n\u2018contingency\u2019 of scientific creation, always located in\nspace and time.\n\n\nAll three aspects would be necessary for an analysis of\n\u2018scientific practice\u2019 but in his book Granger only focuses\non 1. Where do style and mathematics come in? Mathematics comes in as\none of the areas of investigation that can be subjected to a stylistic\nanalysis of science (Granger\u2019s book provides applications not\nonly to mathematics but also to linguistics and the social sciences).\nWhat about style? Every social practice, according to Granger, can be\nstudied from the point of view of style. This includes political\naction, artistic creation and scientific activity. There is thus a\ngeneral stylistics that will try to capture the most general stylistic\nfeatures of such activities and then more \u2018local\u2019\nstylistic analyses such as the one provided by Granger for scientific\nactivities. Obviously, the concept of style here invoked must be one\nthat is much more encompassing than the one usually associated with\nthis term and indeed one that would make application to such areas as\npolitical activity or scientific activity not just metaphorical but\nrather \u2018connaturate\u2019 to such activities.\n\nGranger\u2019s analysis of mathematical style takes up chapters 2, 3,\nand 4 of his book. Chapter 2 deals with Euclidean style and the notion\nof magnitude; chapter 3 with the opposition between \u2018Cartesian\nstyle and Desarguian style\u2019 (on the Cartesian style see also\nRabouin 2017); finally, chapter 4 concerns the \u2018birth of\nvectorial style\u2019. All of these analyses center around the\nconcept of \u201cgeometrical magnitude\u201d.\n\nOne gets a good sense of what Granger is after by simply looking at an\nexample that he describes in his preface. This is an example\nconcerning the complex numbers.\n\nStyle, according to Granger, is a way of imposing structure to an\nexperience. Experience must be taken here to go beyond empirical\nexperience. In general the kind of experience the mathematician\nappeals to is not empirical. From this experience come the\n\u201cintuitive\u201d components that are structured in mathematical\nactivity. But one should not think that there is an\n\u201cintuition\u201d to which, as it were externally, one then\napplies a form. The mathematical activity gives rise at the same time\nto form and content within the background of a certain experience.\n\nStyle appears to us here on the one hand as a way of introducing the\nconcepts of a theory, of connecting them, of unifying them; and on the\nother hand, as a way of delimiting the what intuition contributes to\nthe determination of these concepts. (Granger 1968, 20)\n\n\nAs an example Granger gives three ways of introducing the complex\nnumbers; all three ways account for the structural properties which\ncharacterize the algebraic structure in question. The first way\nintroduces the complex numbers by trigonometric representation using\nangles and directions. The second introduces them as operators applied\nto vectors. In the first case, one defines a complex number as a pair\nof real numbers and the additive properties are then immediate. By\ncontrast, in the second case, it is the multiplicative properties that\nare immediately seized. But, and this is the third way, one can also\nintroduce complex numbers by regular square matrices. This leads to\nseeing the complex numbers as a system of polynomials in x\nmodulo x2+1.\n\nThese different ways of grasping a concept, of integrating it in an\noperative system and of associating to it some intuitive\nimplications\u2014of which one will have to delimit the exact\nextent\u2014constitute what we call aspects of style. It is evident\nthat the structural content of the notion is not here affected, that\nthe concept qua mathematical object subsists identically through these\neffects of style. It is however not always so and we will encounter\nstylistic positions which demand true conceptual variations. What\nchanges always, in any case, is the orientation of the concept towards\nthis or that usage, this or that extension. Thus, style plays a role\nthat is perhaps essential both with respect to the dialectic of the\ninternal development of mathematics and to that of its relation to\nworlds of more concrete objects. (Granger 1968, 21).\n\n\nThus, in Granger\u2019s theory mathematical styles are modes of\npresentation, or modes of grasping the mathematical structures. At\nleast in some cases these effects of style leave the mathematical\nobjects or structures unaffected although they will affect the\ncognitive mode in which they are apprehended, therefore affecting how\nthey might be subjected to extension, applied in various areas etc.\nEven though Granger might have sympathized with a Kantianism without a\ntranscendental subject, and thus think of style as constitutive, it\nseems that his position is at least compatible with a form of realism\nabout mathematical entities. This does not seem to be the case for the\nthird and final epistemological position to be discussed, which is due\nto Ian Hacking.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, Hacking, following Crombie, has proposed\ninvestigating the notion of style as a \u201cnew analytical\ntool\u201d for history and philosophy of science. His preference is\nto speak of styles of reasoning (see also Mancosu 2005) as opposed to\nFleck\u2019s thought styles or Crombie\u2019s styles of thinking\n(his most recent preference is to speak of \u2018Styles of scientific\nthinking & doing\u2019; for the most recent discussion of\nHacking\u2019s program at the time of writing see Kusch 2010 and the\nspecial issue of Studies in History and Philosophy of Science\n(issue 43, 2012), including Hacking 2012 and several other\ncontributions). The reason is that Hacking wants to move away from the\npsychological level of reasoning and work with the more\n\u2018objective\u2019 level of arguments. He explicitly defines his\nproject as a continuation of Kant\u2019s project aimed at explaining\nhow objectivity is possible. And indeed, Hacking\u2019s position\nrejects realism and embraces a strongly constitutive role for style.\nAccording to Hacking, styles are defined by a set of necessary\nconditions (he does not attempt, wisely, to provide sufficient\nconditions):\n\nThere are neither sentences that are candidates for truth, nor\nindependently identified objects to be correct about, prior to the\ndevelopment of a style of reasoning. Every style of reasoning\nintroduces a great many novelties including new types of: Objects;\nevidence; sentences, new ways of being a candidate for truth or\nfalsehood; laws, or at any rate modalities; possibilities. One should\nalso notice, on occasion, new types of classification and new types of\nexplanation. (Hacking 1992, 11)\n\n\nIt should be clear that this notion of style, just like\nGranger\u2019s, attributes a very important role to style as\ngrounding the objectivity of an entire area of scientific activity but\nthat, unlike Granger\u2019s, it is committed ontologically to a\nrejection of realism. Styles are essential in the constitution of\nmathematical objects and the latter do not have a form of existence\nindependent of them. Hacking has not extensively discussed case\nstudies from the history of mathematics although one of his papers\n(Hacking 1995) deals with four constructionalist images of mathematics\n(the word \u201cconstructionalism\u201d is borrowed from Nelson\nGoodman) and shows how well they fit with his picture of \u2018styles\nof thinking\u2019. By implication, it is also clear that more\nrobustly committed realistic positions will not fit well with\nHacking\u2019s account of reasoning styles.\n\nThus, three possible models for explicating the epistemological role\nof \u2018styles\u2019 in mathematics have been considered. There are\nsurely many more possible positions waiting to be articulated but so\nfar this is all that can be found in the literature.\n7. Conclusion\n\nAs pointed out at the outset, the topic of mathematical style is not\none of the canonical areas of investigation in philosophy of\nmathematics. Indeed, this entry is the first attempt to encompass in a\nsingle paper the multifarious contributions to this topic.\nNonetheless, it should be clear by now that reflection on mathematical\nstyle is present in contemporary philosophical activity and deserves\nto be taken seriously. But the work is just beginning. One needs many\nmore case studies of mathematical styles and a clearer articulation of\nthe epistemological and ontological consequences yielded by different\nconceptualizations of style. In addition, one would like to see a\nbetter integration of all this work with the work on cognitive styles\nthat is found in cognitive psychology and mathematical education.\nFinally, standard philosophical chestnuts, such as the relationship of\nform and content to style, and the relation of style to normativity\nand intentionality would also have to be addressed (for a very good\ndiscussion of such topics in aesthetics see Meskin 2005).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Baker, A., 2008, \u201cExperimental mathematics\u201d,\n<em>Erkenntnis</em>, 68: 331\u2013344.", "Benis-Sinaceur, H., 2010, \u201cStyle et contenu formel chez\nGilles-Gaston Granger\u201d, in A.
