Pragmatics and Semantics\n\nAs our examples make clear, semantics, conceived as the study\nof the meaning of words and sentences, does not exhaust the study of\nmeaning. The study of speaker meaning and implicature is included in\npragmatics, which covers the broad range of speech acts\nperformed by using words and sentences. Applied pragmatics\narose from the recognition that second language learners cannot become\nfully proficient without mastering more than grammar and literal\nmeaning (Kasper 2003; Zufferey et al 2019: Ch. 9). Forensic\npragmatics studies the use of pragmatics in law enforcement\nand the courts (Solan & Tiersma 2005; Zufferey et al.\n2019: \u00a74.4). Clinical pragmatics studies\ncommunication disorders that arise from failure to master pragmatic\nrules (Cummings 2009, 2014; Graci 2023). Formal pragmatics\nuses formal models of utterances, contexts, and discourse to state\nprecise rules specifying the interpretation of an utterance in a\ncontext, including what is both said and implicated (Roberts 2006;\nRothschild 2013).\n\nThe phenomenon of Gricean conventional implicature\n (\u00a72)\n shows further that standard truth-conditional semantics does not\nexhaust semantics (Barker 2003). For example, Ravel, a Spaniard,\nwrote Spanish-style music and Ravel was a Spaniard and wrote\nSpanish-style music have the same entailments. Yet they differ in\nmeaning in such a way that the former but not the latter is\ninfelicitous and improper because Ravel was French.\n\u201cFalse\u201d clearly applies to the latter but not clearly to\nthe former.\n\nImplicature is important even in truth-conditional semantics. For\nexample, logicians customarily take sentences of the form\n\u201cp or q\u201d to be true provided\n\u201cp\u201d or \u201cq\u201d or both\nare true. Thus \u201cIt is not the case that cats meow or purr\u201d\nwould be counted as false. But there are also cases in which speakers\nuse \u201cp or q\u201d to mean that\n\u201cp\u201d or \u201cq\u201d is true but\nnot both. This would be the natural way to interpret someone who\nsaid \u201cJohn is going to invite Mary or Jane to the prom\u201d.\nSome maintain that \u201cor\u201d is ambiguous in English,\nwith an inclusive and an exclusive sense. But another possibility is\nthat the exclusive interpretation is a generalized conversational\nimplicature. One piece of evidence supporting the implicature\nhypothesis is that the exclusive interpretation seems cancelable. Thus\n\u201cJane will visit France or Germany this summer; indeed, she will\ndrive through both on her way to Poland\u201d has no contradictory\ninterpretation. Some evidence against the implicature hypothesis is\nthat after \u201cp or q,\u201d or both does not seem any more\nredundant than but not both.  A methodological issue is\nto describe the evidence necessary to decide whether a particular\ninterpretation is a sense or a generalized conversational implicature.\nA foundational issue to is describe exactly what the difference\nconsists in.\n\nImplicature continues to be invoked in this way to defend\ncontroversial semantic claims:\n\nKnowledge. The standard of justification necessary to\nclaim knowledge varies from context to context depending on what is at\nstake and salient. On contextualist theories, sentences of the form\n\u201cS knows p\u201d are indexical, with\ndifferent truth conditions in different contexts (S. Cohen 1986, Lewis\n1996, DeRose 2009). An alternative theory is that \u201cS\nknows p\u201d has a strict invariant semantics, but is used\nloosely to implicate that S is close enough to knowing for\nthe purposes of the context (W. Davis 2007b). Another is that\n\u201cS knows p\u201d has a weak invariant\nsemantics but its negation is used to implicate that contextually\nrelevant alternatives cannot be ruled out (Rysiew 2001; Brown 2006;\nHazlett 2007).  Others argue that implicatures cannot account for\nthe data (Blome-Tillman 2013b; Dinges 2018;\n 2021).[26]\nNames. The Millian theory that the meaning of a name is\nits referent entails that coreferential names are synonymous, and that\nnames without a referent are meaningless. This seems untenable in\nlight of names like \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cClark\nKent\u201d. Millians have proposed that the source of these\nlinguistic intuitions is a difference in implicature (Salmon 1986;\nSoames 1989). One hypothesis invokes metalinguistic implicature,\nnoting that \u201cClark Kent can fly\u201d implicates that a man\ncalled \u201cClark Kent\u201d can fly (McKay 1981; Berg 1988, 2012).\nOne problem is its implication that the Chinese translation of\n\u201cLois Lane believes Superman can fly\u201d should seem as false\nas \u201cLois Lane believes Clark Kent can fly\u201d.\nNegation. On the regular interpretation of (9) below,\n\u201csome\u201d is equivalent to \u201cany\u201d, and the whole\nsentence is contradictory:\n\n\n(9)  The boy\ndid not eat some of the cookies, he ate all the cookies.\n\n\nBut there is another interpretation, marked \nby\n intonation[27]\n and other features, on which the negation in (9) denies the\n\u201cnot all\u201d implicature of \u201cThe boy ate some of the\ncookies\u201d, and is thus consistent. The question is how to account\nfor the two different interpretations of negations given that the word\n\u201cnot\u201d seems unambiguous (Geurts 1998). Horn (1989:\n362\u20134; 370\u20135) and Burton-Roberts (1989) propose that the\nmarked interpretation of (9) is an implicature. W. Davis (2016: Ch. 6)\nargues that it is an idiom that plausibly evolved from a generalized\nconversational implicature.  Soria-Ruiz (2023) proposes a\nneo-Stalnakerian account.\n\n\nImplicature plays a well-attested diachronic role in\ngrammaticalization and the origin of new meanings and\n idioms.[28]\n For example, metaphors have a typical life cycle: beginning as\nsomething a speaker means on a particular occasion; being picked up by\nothers; catching on, which means becoming self-perpetuating and\nspreading through the population; and finally, dying and becoming a\nnew lexical meaning or idiom. When dead, what used to be indirectly\nexpressed is directly expressed. The term virus as applied to\ncomputers went through this evolution in the last few decades,\noriginally denoting a biological organism that spreads from host to\nhost, now having another meaning on which it denotes computer programs\nthat spread from computer to computer in a similar fashion. When a\ndead metaphor has syntactic structure like go viral, it is an\nidiom. When metaphors become widespread and\nself-perpetuating, but are not yet idioms, they generate generalized\nconversational\n implicatures.[29]\n",
