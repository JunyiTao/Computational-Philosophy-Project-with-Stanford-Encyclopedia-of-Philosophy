    "main_text": "\n\nRelational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) is the most recent among the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics which are most discussed today.\nIt was introduced in 1996, with quantum gravity as a remote motivation\n(Rovelli 1996); interests in it has slowly but steadily grown only in\nthe last decades. RQM is essentially a refinement of the textbook\n\u201cCopenhagen\u201d interpretation, where the role of the\nCopenhagen observer is not limited to the classical world, but can\ninstead be assumed by any physical system. RQM rejects an ontic\nconstrual of the wave function (more in general, of the quantum\nstate): the wave function or the quantum state play only an auxiliary\nrole, akin to the Hamilton-Jacobi function of classical mechanics.\nThis does not imply the rejection of an ontological commitment: RQM is\nbased on an ontology given by physical systems described by physical\nvariables, as in classical mechanics. The difference with classical\nmechanics is that (a) variables take value only at\ninteractions and (b) the values they take are only\nrelative to the (other) system affected by the interaction.\nHere \u201crelative\u201d is in the same sense in which velocity is\na property of a system relative to another system in\nclassical mechanics. The world is therefore described by RQM as an\nevolving network of sparse relative events, described by\npunctual relative values of physical variables.\n\nThe physical assumption at the basis of RQM is the following\npostulate: The probability distribution for (future) values of\nvariables relative to \\(S'\\) depend on (past) values of variables\nrelative to \\(S'\\) but not on (past) values of variables relative to\nanother system \\(S''.\\)\n\nThe interpretation does not require to assume the existence of a\nclassical world to be formulated, nor special observer systems; it\ndoes not give any special role to measurement. Instead, it assumes\nthat any physical system can play the role of the Copenhagen\u2019s\nobserver and any interaction counts as a measurement. This is possible\nwithout changing the predictions of quantum theory thanks to the\npostulate above, because the interference observed by a system \\(S'\\)\nis not erased by the actualisation of variables relative to a\ndifferent system \\(S''\\) (it can of course be suppressed by\ndecoherence). In this way, RQM can make sense of a fully quantum world\nwithout requiring hidden variables, many worlds, physical collapse\nmechanisms, or a special role for mind, consciousness, subjectivity,\nagents, or similar.\n\nThe price to pay for this parsimony is a weakening of the conventional\n(\u201cstrong\u201d) realism of classical mechanics where physical\nvariables are assumed to have values which are non-relational and\nexist at every time. The fact that variables take value only at\ninteractions gives a sparse event (or \u201cflash\u201d) ontology;\nthe fact that they are labeled by the system to which they refer, adds\na level of indexicality to the representation of the world.\n\nRQM is metaphysically neutral, but it has a strong relational stance\nthat questions strong realism (Laudisa 2019), in a sense detailed\nbelow. Because of this tingling with realism, RQM has been framed, in\nturn, in the context of various philosophical perspectives, including\nconstructive empiricism (van Fraassen 2010), neo-Kantism (Bitbol 2007\n [Other Internet Resources/OIR],\n Bitbol 2010), more recently anti-monism (Dorato 2016) and structural\nrealism (Candiotto 2017). (See also Brown 2009, Wood 2010\n [OIR].)\n The interpretation has aspects in common with QBism (Fuchs 2001, 2002\n [OIR]),\n with Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach (Healey 1989) and especially\nwith the view of quantum theory discussed by Zeilinger and Bruckner\n(Zeilinger 1999, Brukner & Zeilinger 2003).\n",
