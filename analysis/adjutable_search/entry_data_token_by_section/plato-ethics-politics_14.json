    "main_text": "Politics, Part Two: Defective Constitutions\n6. Conclusions about the Ethics and Politics of Plato\u2019s Republic\n\n\nThe Republic is a sprawling work with dazzling details and \nan enormously wide-ranging influence. But what, in the end, does the \nwork say to us, insofar as we are trying to live well or help our \nsociety live well, and what does it say to us, insofar as we are \ntrying to understand how to think about how to live well?\n\n\nIn ethics, the Republic\u2019s main practical lesson is that one\nshould, if one can, pursue wisdom and that if one cannot, one should\nfollow the wisest guides one can find. This lesson is familiar from\nPlato\u2019s Socratic dialogues: the philosophical life is best, and if one\nlacks knowledge, one should prefer to learn from an expert. But\nthe Republic characterizes philosophy differently. First, it\ngoes much further than the Socratic dialogues in respecting the power\nof passions and desires. Wisdom still requires being able to survive\nSocratic examination (534b\u2013c), but it also explicitly requires careful\nand extensive habituation of spirited and appetitive\nattitudes (485a\u2013486b, 519a8\u2013b1), sublimation of\npsychological energy from spirited and appetitive desires to\nphilosophical desire (cf. 485d), and continued attention to and\nmaintenance of the desires that arise from the non-calculating parts\nof one\u2019s soul (571d\u2013572b, 589a\u2013b, cf. 416e\u2013417b). Second, as opposed\nto the Socrates of the Socratic dialogues, who avows ignorance and\nis content with the belief that the world is well-ordered, the Socrates of\nthe Republic insists that wisdom requires understanding how\nthe world is, which involves apprehending the basic mathematical and\nteleological structure of things. Third, although the Socrates of the\nSocratic dialogues practices philosophy instead of living an\nordinarily engaged political life, he insists that his life is closer\nto what the political art demands than the ordinarily engaged life\nis. According to the Republic, by contrast, the philosopher\nprefers to be entirely apart from politics, especially in ordinary\ncircumstances (496c\u2013e, 592a, cf. 520a\u2013b).\n\n\nOne facet of this advice that deserves emphasizing is the importance \nit places on the influence of others. Plato plainly believes that \none\u2019s living well depends upon one\u2019s fellows and the larger culture. \nThis is most obvious in the case of those who cannot pursue wisdom \nfor themselves. They will live as well as those who lead them allow. \nBut even those who can pursue wisdom must first be raised well and \nmust later meet with tolerance, which philosophers do not often \nreceive. \n\n\nThe ethical theory the Republic offers is best characterized\nas eudaimonist, according to which a person should act for the sake of\nhis or her own success or happiness (eudaimonia). Socrates\ndoes not argue for this as opposed to other approaches to\nethics. Rather, he simply assumes that a person\u2019s success gives him or\nher conclusive reasons to act, and he argues that success requires\nacting virtuously. This eudaimonism is widely thought to be an\negoistic kind of consequentialism: one should act so as to bring about\nstates of affairs in which one is happy or successful. But there is no\nreason to suppose that the\nRepublic rejects the identity of eudaimonia and \ngood activity (eu prattein, eupragia) which \nSocrates often assumes in Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues \n(Charmides 171e\u2013172a, Crito 48b, \nEuthydemus 278e\u2013282d, Gorgias 507c). If\nthe Republic takes this identity seriously, as the function\nargument of Book One does (354a), it says that virtuous activity is\ngood not because it brings about success, but because it\nis success. This is also the explicit view of Aristotle and the\nStoics, who had considered Plato\u2019s work carefully.\n\n\nMetaethically, the Republic presupposes that there are\nobjective facts concerning how one should live. Much of its account of\nthese facts sounds naturalist. After all, Socrates uses the careful\nstudy of human psychology to reveal how our souls function well or\nill, and he grounds the account of what a person should do in his\nunderstanding of good psychological functioning. Socrates\u2019 particular\ndeployment of this general strategy suggests that good actions are\nthose that sustain the virtuous soul (443e) and that the virtuous soul\nis the one with a maximally unified set of commitments (443d\u2013e,\ncf. 534b\u2013c). Whether this is plausible depends upon what careful study\nof human psychology in fact shows. It depends in particular on\nwhether, as a matter of fact, the actions that we would\npre-theoretically deem good sustain a coherent set of psychological\ncommitments and those that we would pre-theoretically deem bad are\ninconsistent with a coherent set of psychological commitments. Ethical\nnaturalism such as this still awaits support from psychology, but it\nhas not been falsified, either.\n\n\nAlthough this naturalist reading of the Republic is not\nanachronistic\u2014Aristotle and the Stoics develop related\nnaturalist approaches, and Plato had naturalist contemporaries in a\nhedonist tradition\u2014Plato himself would not be content to ground\nhis account of good actions on empirical facts of human psychology.\nOn his view, actions are good because of their relation to good\nagents, and agents are good because of their relation to goodness\nitself. But goodness itself, the Good, transcends the natural world;\nit is a supernatural property. This commits Plato to a non-naturalist\nversion of ethical realism, which modernity\u2019s creeping tide of\nnaturalism threatens to wash away. But non-naturalism in ethics will\nretain some appeal insofar as the other ways of trying to explain our\nexperiences of the moral life fail to answer the serious objections\nthey face.\n\n\nThe take-home lessons of the Republic\u2019s politics are subject\nto special controversy. In the sections above, I take what Socrates \nsays about the ideal and defective cities at face value, but many \nreaders believe that this is a mistake. Some think that Plato does \nnot intend the Republic as a serious contribution to \npolitical thought, because its political musings are projections to \nclarify psychological claims crucial to the ethical theory that Plato\ndoes seriously intend (Annas 1999, Annas 2000). Others think that Plato intends \npolitical lessons strikingly different from what is suggested by the \nface value of Socrates\u2019 words. \n\n\nOne can concede that the Republic\u2019s politics are a \nreflection of its moral psychology without thinking that they are \nmerely that. In antiquity, starting with Aristotle, Plato\u2019s \nRepublic was recognized as part of a large genre of \npolitically serious works, many of them inspired by Sparta (Menn 2005), and \nSocrates\u2019 explicit claims about the ideal and defective constitutions\nwere taken seriously as political proposals.\n\n\nMoreover, one can concede that the Republic calls into \nquestion many of its political proposals without thinking that Plato \nmeans to cancel them or suggest other, radically different political \nadvice (cf. Clay 1988). It is striking that Socrates is ready to show that it is \nbetter to be just than unjust before he has even said that \nthe just and wise person must be a philosopher and that the just city\nmust be ruled by philosophers (444e\u2013445a). It is also striking that \nAdeimantus enthusiastically endorses the idea of \u201cholding the women \nand children in common\u201d (424a) and then later asks Socrates to \nexplain it (449c\u2013450a). And it is striking that Socrates recognizes \nthat Greeks would ridicule his proposal that women take up the arts \nof war (452a). But Plato might signal for his readers to examine and \nre-examine what Socrates says without thereby suggesting that he \nhimself finds fault with what Socrates says. \n\n\nBut still some readers, especially Leo Strauss (see Strauss 1964) and his followers (e.g., Bloom 1968 and Bloom 1977), want to \ndistance the Republic\u2019s take-home political message from \nKallipolis. They typically appeal to three considerations that are \nsupposed to indicate Plato\u2019s awareness that the political ideal is \nimpossible or ruinous. First, they note that the philosophers have to\nbe compelled to rule the ideal city. But this involves no \nimpossibility. The founders of the ideal city would have to make a \nlaw compelling those educated as philosophers to rule (cf. \n section 2.3\n above), but founders could make such a law. If philosophers have to \nbe compelled to sustain the maximally happy city, one might wonder \nwhy anyone would found such a city. But one might wonder why anyone \nwas inspired to compose the Oresteia, as well. People sometimes\ndo remarkable things. Second, Straussian readers appeal to the ideal \ncity\u2019s predicted demise, and they assert that the rulers\u2019 eventual \ninability to calculate \u201cthe marriage number\u201d (546a\u2013547a) shows an \nineliminable conflict between the eros in human nature and the \nmathematical perfection of a political ideal. But it is also possible\nto blame the anticipated degeneration on sense-perception (see \n546b2\u20133), not calculation, and to see in Kallipolis\u2019 demise a common \nfact of life for perceptible entities (546a2). After all, Socrates does\nnot say that eros makes the creation or maintenance of Kallipolis \nimpossible. Finally, the Straussians note that Kallipolis is not \nsketched as an ideal in a political treatise, exactly, but proposed \nby Socrates in a long dramatic conversation, which includes twists \nand turns that come after he stops discussing Kallipolis. \nThis is true, and it renders difficult inferences from what is said \nin the Republic to what Plato thinks. But it does not \nprovide any reason for thinking that Plato rejects the ideal\nthat Socrates constructs in the Republic.\n\n\nIn fact, Socrates expresses several central political theses in the \nRepublic that appear in other Platonic dialogues, as well, \nespecially in the Gorgias, Statesman, and \nLaws. First, the best rulers are wise. Second, the best\nrulers rule for the benefit of the ruled, and not for their own\nsake. Third, a city is highly unlikely to have the best rulers, in\npart because there is a gulf between the values of most people and the\nvalues of the wise. Fourth, the greatest harm to a city is\ndisagreement about who should rule, since competing factions create\ncivil strife.  So, fifth, a central goal of politics is harmony or agreement\namong the citizens about who should rule. Last, harmony requires that\nthe city cultivate virtue and the rule of law. The consistency of\nthese messages across several Platonic dialogues might well make us so\nbold as to think that they are the take-home message of\nthe Republic\u2019s politics. \n",
