Huntington: Axiomatic Investigations of the Algebra of Logic\n\nAt the turn of the 19th Century, David Hilbert\n(1862\u20131943) presented, in his Grundlagen der Geometrie,\nEuclidean geometry as an axiomatic subject that did not depend on\ndiagrams for its proofs (Hilbert 1899). This led to a wave of interest\nin studying axiom systems in mathematics; in particular one wanted to\nknow if the axioms were independent, and which primitives led to the\nmost elegant systems. Edward Vermilye Huntington (1874\u20131952) was\none of the first to examine this issue for the algebra of logic. He\ngave three axiomatizations of the algebra of logic, showed each set of\naxioms was independent, and that they were equivalent (see Huntington\n1904). In 1933 he returned to this topic with three new sets of\naxioms, one of which contained the following three equations (1933:\n280): \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} a + b &= b + a \\\\ (a + b) + c &= a + (b + c)\n\\\\ (a' + b')' + (a' + b)' &= a. \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nShortly after this, Herbert Robbins (1915\u20132001) conjectured that\nthe third equation could be replaced by the slightly simpler\n\n\\[ [(a + b)' + (a + b')']' = a. \\]\n\n\nNeither Huntington nor Robbins could prove this, and later it\nwithstood the efforts of many others, including even Tarski and his\ntalented school at Berkeley. Building on partial results of Winker,\nthe automated theorem prover EQP, designed by William McCune of the\nArgonne National Laboratory, found a proof of the Robbins Conjecture\nin 1996. This accomplishment was popularized in Kolata 2010.\n\nAccording to Huntington (1933: 278), the term \u201cBoolean\nalgebra\u201d was introduced by Henry M. Sheffer (1882\u20131964) in\nthe paper where he showed that one could give a five-equation\naxiomatization of Boolean algebra using the single fundamental\noperation of joint exclusion, now known as the Sheffer stroke (see\nSheffer 1913). Whitehead and Russell claimed in the preface to the\nsecond edition of Principia that the Sheffer stroke was the\ngreatest advance in logic since the publication of Principia.\n(Hilbert and Ackermann (1928), by contrast, stated that the Sheffer\nstroke was just a curiosity.) Neither realized that decades earlier\nSchr\u00f6der had discovered that the dual of the Sheffer stroke was\nalso such an operation\u2014Schr\u00f6der\u2019s symbol for his operation\nwas that of a double-edged sword.\n\nIn the 1930s Garrett Birkhoff (1911\u20131996) established the\nfundamental results of equational logic, namely (1) equational classes\nof algebras are precisely the classes closed under homomorphisms,\nsubalgebras and direct products, and (2) equational logic is based on\nfive rules: reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, replacement, and\nsubstitution. In the 1940s, Tarski joined in this development of\nequational logic; the subject progressed rapidly from the 1950s till\nthe present time.\n",
