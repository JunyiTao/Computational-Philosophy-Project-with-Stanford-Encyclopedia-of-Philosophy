    "main_text": "CA and Philosophy || CA as Models of Reality\n3.4 CA as Models of Reality \n\nWhen discussing CA as models of reality we need to carefully\ndistinguish the different meanings of modelling.\n (CA1)\n above\n (section 1.2)\n discussed CA as \u201cmodels of computation\u201d: CA model\nparallel computations in the rather trivial sense that they\nperform them; for that is what their cells do: they associate\ninputs to outputs by implementing algorithmic functions, together with\ntheir mates. In other words, they model computation as Turing machines\ndo (but, of course, with different underlying ideas). \n\n(CA2)\n introduced a different sense of modelling for CA, i.e., the\nidea that CA are fruitfully used in current scientific practices to\nstudy an incredible variety of phenomena: chemical systems (e.g.,\nKier, Seybold, & Cheng 2005), urban growth (e.g., Aburas et al.\n2016), traffic flow (e.g., L\u00e1rragaa et al. 2005), even warfare\n(e.g., Ilachinski 2004). According to the characterization of\nBarberousse, Franceschelli, and Imbert 2007\n (Other Internet Resources),\n a common technique is the \u201cphenomenological\u201d modelling.\nPhenomenological modelling happens when one models in a direct way,\nthat is, without making use of a previous explanatory theory: one\nlooks at how traffic flows and tries to build a CA that reproduces a\nsufficiently similar behaviour and allows to make useful predictions.\nThe key question for modellers here is, \n\n\nAre there well established correspondence rules that I can use to\ntranslate features of the system I want to model into specifications\nfor an adequate cellular automaton model of it? (Toffoli &\nMargolus 1990: 244) \n\n\nIn this sense, CA modelling is a special case of \u201cagent-based\nmodelling\u201d (Miller & Page 2007): the modeller starts with\nmicro-rules to explore macro-behavior: e.g. in social sciences, see\nthe classic Schelling 1978, in decision theory see Grim et al. 1997,\nin political theory Grim et al. 2005. \n\nStarting from\n (CA2),\n it is natural to ask whether it is possible to push the boundaries\neven further, i.e., using CA to model more \u201cfundamental\u201d\nparts of reality. For example Toffoli 1984 conjectures that CA may\nallow us to replace physical modelling with differential\nequations (and related notions of real variables, continuity, etc.).\nComputations with differential equations, Toffoli claims, are:\n\n\nat least three levels removed from the physical world that they try to\nrepresent. That is, first (a) we stylize physics into differential\nequations, then (b) we force these equations into the mold of discrete\nspace and time and truncate the resulting power series, so as to\narrive at finite difference equations, and finally, in order to commit\nthe latter to algorithms, (c) we project real-valued variables onto\nfinite computer words (\u201cround-off\u201d). At the end of the\nchain we find the computer \u2013 again a physical system;\nisn\u2019t there a less roundabout way to make nature model itself?\n(Toffoli 1984: 121)\n\n\nSuch a less roundabout way can be provided, so the proposal goes, by\nCA. We see here a path, from the view that CA are useful as a\nphenomenological heuristic to predict the behaviour of some aspects of\nreality, to the claim that CA modelling may, in a sense, be closer to\nthe underlying physics than any non-discrete alternative, as\nanticipated in\n (CA4)\n above. \n\nWe are now ready to move to the final step, taking us into speculative\nmetaphysics of physics. In the last fifty years various scientists\n(see Zuse 1982; Fredkin 1993; Wolfram 2002) have advanced a bold\nconjecture: that the physical universe is, fundamentally, a\ndiscrete computational structure. Everything in our\nworld\u2014quarks, trees, human beings, remote galaxies\u2014is just\na pattern in a CA, much like a glider in Life. \n\nOne may dispute the very meaningfulness of claims of this kind,\nconcerning the world as a whole: something that, to speak Kantian, is\nnever given to us in experience. Floridi 2009 has argued against such\ndigital ontology, not by defending a continuous picture of reality,\nbut by arguing that the world is not the right kind of thing to which\nsuch notions as discreteness and continuity can meaningfully apply.\nThese concern rather, in Kantian fashion, our ways of modelling\nreality, or \u201cmodes of presentation of being\u201d. If one, on\nthe contrary, thinks that there must be a fact of the matter about the\ndiscrete vs. continuous nature of the world (as argued in Berto &\nTagliabue 2014, on the basis of considerations from cardinality and\ngeneral mereology [see entry on\n mereology]),\n then the next issue is: what does (the philosophy of) fundamental\nphysics have to say about this? It is fair to claim that the issue is\nopen. Scholars such as Nobel prize winner \u2019t Hooft (1997)\nseriously explore discretist views, and approaches based on so-called\ncausal set theory (see Dowker 2003; Malament 2006) take the geometry\nof real-world spacetime as such that at the Planck length\n(\\(10^{-33}\\) cm) it is discrete. Cognate strategies take spacetime as\nmade of polysimplexes, usually polydimensional counterparts of\ntetrahedra (see Ambjorn et al. 2004) ; adding the claim that such\npolysimplexes compute functions takes us already in the vicinity of\nCA. Other scholars, instead, are against the idea of a digital world.\nDeutsch (2005) and Hardy (2005) reject the view that quantum\nprobabilities and quantum computing vindicate a discrete structure of\nspace-time, and claim that quantum mechanics complies with the idea\nthat the world is continuous even more than classical physics. While\nwe are, thus, in the realm of speculation, we can nevertheless single\nout two main reasons to investigate the provocative claim that the\nworld is a discrete CA. First, the arguments put forward to support\nthe view may be philosophically interesting in themselves. Second, the\nontological structure of a CA-world can be fruitfully compared to\nexisting metaphysical accounts. Let us take each point in turn. \n\nThe picture of nature as a CA is supported by an epistemological\ndesideratum, i.e., having exact computational models of the\nphysical world (see for instance the discussion of ontic\npancomputationalism in the entry on\n computation in physical systems).\n While this is certainly one of the arguments involved, it is not the\nonly one and probably not the strongest. As Piccinini points out, even\nsomeone who shares that desire \u201cmay well question why we should\nexpect nature to fulfill it\u201d (Piccinini 2010: Section 3.4). \n\nIlachinski proposes a different \u201cargument from\nepistemology\u201d (Ilachinski 2001: 661\u20132). Let us consider\nagain the space-time diagram of Rule 110: \n\n\n\nFig. 7\n\n\nLet us imagine we ignore its being generated by the iteration of a\nsimple local rule, or even that it is an automaton. Then, says\nIlachinski: \n\n\nNoticing that the figure consists of certain particle-like objects\nsprinkled on a more-or-less static background, the simplest (most\nnatural?) thing for you to do (\u2026) is to begin cataloging the\nvarious \u201cparticles\u201d and their \u201cinteractions.\u201d\n(\u2026) What you almost assuredly will not have, is any idea that\nthe underlying physics really consists of a single\u2014very\nsimple\u2014local deterministic rule(\u2026). How different is\nthis alien two-dimensional world from our own? (Ilachinski 2001:\n662).\n\n\nThis highlights how CA may generate situations that we view as\nphysically realistic. But one may consider this as a mere suggestion:\nthat we cannot rule out a priori our universe\u2019s being,\nat its bottom level, a CA does not entail that it actually is\na CA. \n\nA firmer ground to explore the hypothesis comes from some independent\nreasons of theoretical dissatisfaction with contemporary physics. We\nwill limit ourselves to what we may call conceptual\ncomplaints, as opposed to ones more closely related to scientific\npractice, such as the failure of reductions of quantum mechanics and\nrelativity to a Theory of Everything. We will examine the\nfollowing three: (i) the problem of infinity, (ii)\nthe need for a transparent ontology, (iii) the physical role\nof information.  \n\nAs for complaint (i): while infinite and infinitesimal\nquantities provide us with powerful tools to model and advance\npredictions on the physical world, it remains controversial what\nontological conclusions should be drawn from this fact. Since the\ndiscovery of\n Zeno\u2019s Paradox (see entry),\n the continuity of space-time, as well as other fundamental physical\nvariables, have puzzled philosophers and scientists alike. In the\nwords of the physicist Richard Feynman: \n\n\nIt bothers me that, according to the laws as we understand them today,\nit takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations\nto figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space,\nand no matter how tiny a region of time. How can all that be going on\nin that tiny space? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to\nfigure out what a tiny piece of space-time is going to do? So I have\noften made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a\nmathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed\nand the laws will turn out to be simple, like the checker board with\nall its apparent complexities. (Feynman 1965)\n\n\nOne way theoretical physicists have approached the problem is to\nconjecture a fundamental layer of reality along the lines of Edward\nFredkin\u2019s \u201cFinite Nature Hypothesis\u201d: \n\n\nFinite Nature is a hypothesis that ultimately every quantity of\nphysics, including space and time, will turn out to be discrete and\nfinite; that the amount of information in any small volume of\nspace-time will be finite and equal to one of a small number of\npossibilities. (\u2026) We take the position that Finite Nature\nimplies that the basic substrate of physics operates in a manner\nsimilar to the workings of certain specialized computers called\ncellular automata. (Fredkin 1993: 116)\n\n\nIf a cellular automaton is a model satisfying this hypothesis, then\n\u201cunderneath the laws of physics as we know them today it could\nbe that there lies a simple program from which all the known laws\n(\u2026) emerge\u201d (Wolfram 2002: 434). If, as we have seen\nabove, currently there is no agreement on the issue whether physical\nreality is fundamentally continuous or discrete, at least the Finite\nNature Hypothesis seems to be a no less falsifiable prediction (see\nFredkin 1990) than many speculative metaphysical pictures.\nUnfortunately, although we have attempts to recapture field theory\nwithin CA theory (see, e.g., Svozil 1987, Lee 1986), there is no\nagreed-upon derivation of today\u2019s continuous physics within a CA\nframework; it is therefore safe to say that no party has a clear\nadvantage here.\n\nAs for complaint (ii): one reason to adopt the view of CA as\nmodels of a fundamentally discrete world is the desire for a\ntransparent ontology. Take a materialist philosopher for whom the task\nof physics is to provide an ultimate description of reality on the\nbasis of a handful of basic physical properties and relations. As\nargued in Beraldo-de-Ara\u00fajo & Baravalle forthcoming, a\ndigital ontology may take different models of computation at its\nfoundation: by analyzing the ontological commitments of CA (vs.\ntraditional Turing machines), they conclude that CA are very close to\nsupporting a traditional form of physicalism. In this perspective, a\nCA-based physics may provide a neat and elegant ontological picture:\none that would be describable in a first-order formal theory including\nthe axioms of standard\n mereology (see entry)\n (even of mereotopology, as presented, e.g., in Casati, Varzi 1999),\nand whose theorems would be computable in finite time (see Berto,\nRossi, Tagliabue 2010: 73\u201387). Besides, CA make easier to\nreconcile prima facie contradictory properties of different physical\nlaws, such as the reversibility of micro-laws and the\nirreversibility of the Second Law of Thermodynamics (see for\nexample Wolfram 2002: 441\u2013457; Berto, Rossi, Tagliabue 2010:\n43\u201346). There is no agreement on whether the Second Law gives us\na fundamental feature of physical reality, or it is a spin-off of\nunderlying principles which are time-reversal invariant and act on an\ninitial state of the universe at low entropy (see Albert 2000). If the\nworld is discrete and temporal reversibility is fundamental,\nreversible CA like, e.g., that of Berto, Rossi, Tagliabue (2016) may\nbe more than mere computational tools achieving some degree of\ncomputational efficiency via their reversibility. \n\nAs for point (iii), concerning the physical role of\ninformation: CA can accommodate a speculative hypothesis entertained\nby a number of scientists (Wheeler 1990, Ilachinski 2001) and\nphilosophers (Chalmers 1996), namely that information is not just one\naspect of the physical world, but, in a sense, the most fundamental.\nFor instance, Fredkin\u2019s Finite Nature Hypothesis not only\nstresses the importance of the informational aspects of physics, but\n\u201cit insists that the informational aspects are all there is to\nphysics at the most microscopic level\u201d (see Fredkin 1993). \n\nOne way in which this idea has been developed is the so-called\n\u201cit from bit\u201d theory (see again Wheeler 1990). In\nDavid Chalmers\u2019 words, this approach \u201cstems from the\nobservation that in physical theories, fundamental physical states are\nindividuated as informational states\u201d (Chalmers 1996:\n302). Physics is silent on what accomplishes the specified functional\nroles, so \u201cany realization of these information states will\nserve as well for the purpose of a physical theory\u201d (Chalmers\n1996: 302). The \u201cit from bit\u201d approach is particularly\nappealing to Chalmers as a philosopher of mind committed to\nqualia being intrinsic, non-reducible properties, because it\nallows for a simple unification: we need intrinsic properties to make\nsense of conscious experience, and we need intrinsic properties to\nground the informational states that make up the world\u2019s\nphysics. If we claim that all the informational states are grounded in\nphenomenal or proto-phenomenal properties, we \u201cget away with a\ncheap and elegant ontology, and solve two problems in a single\nblow\u201d (Chalmers 1996: 305). The cell states in a CA fit the\nbill: if we interpret them as proto-phenomenal properties, we obtain\nthe intrinsic structure of some sort of computational neutral monism\n(for an historical introduction, see the entry on\n neutral monism).\n\nAlbeit individually controversial, taken together the three points\nsupport a simple and elegant metaphysical picture which is not\nevidently false or incoherent. \n\nSupposing that the actual physical world is a giant, discrete\nautomaton, are there philosophically interesting conclusions to be\ndrawn? A first one has already been partially explored in connection\nwith Life: if nature is a CA, it has to be a\nuniversal CA, given that universal computers (e.g., the one\non which you are probably reading this entry) uncontroversially exist\nin the physical world. Then its evolution is algorithmically\nirreducible, given the Halting Problem. Notwithstanding the\nopportunity of devising approximate forecast tools, we are left with a\nuniverse whose evolution is unpredictable for a reason quite different\nfrom the ones commonly adduced by resorting to standard physics, such\nas quantum effects or random fluctuations: it is unpredictable just\nbecause of its computational complexity. \n\nA second philosophical topic is the connection between a CA-world and\none of the most famous and controversial contemporary metaphysical\ntheses, namely David Lewis\u2019 Humean Supervenience (HS).\nUsing Ned Hall\u2019s characterization (see section on\n Humean supervenience in the entry on David Lewis\u2019s metaphysics),\n we can state HS as the collection of these four claims about the\nstructure of our world:\n\n(HS1)\nThere are particulars (space-time points).\n(HS2)\nThey are, or are wholly composed of, simples\u2014particulars\nthat have no other particulars as parts.\n(HS3)\n These simples have various perfectly natural monadic properties.\n\n(HS4)\nThey stand in various spatiotemporal relations to one\nanother.\n\n\nIf we substitute \u201cspace-time points\u201d with\n\u201ccells\u201d, HS gets very close to a CA ontology: cells are\narranged in a lattice, have various spatiotemporal relations to one\nanother (e.g., being a neighborhood of), and have monadic\nproperties (states) which can be considered perfectly\nnatural, i.e., the basic properties out of which any other can be\nconstrued. A CA universe is thus a prima facie abstract model\nof Lewis\u2019 HS and can be fruitfully used to illustrate\nLewis\u2019 original point, which was a reductionist one: \n\n\nThe point of defending Humean Supervenience is not to support\nreactionary physics, but rather to resist philosophical arguments that\nthere are more things in heaven and earth than physics has dreamt of.\n(Lewis 1994: 474).\n\n\nThere are, however, two differences between the ontology naturally\nsuggested by CA theories and Lewis\u2019 view. First, for Lewis\nspace-time is an essentially continuous, four-dimensional manifold,\neternalistically conceived (see the section on eternalism in the entry\non\n time\n and the discussion on four-dimensionalism in the entry on\n temporal parts\n for an introduction), while in a standard CA-driven ontology, it is\nnot. Second, Lewis reduces laws of nature to particulars while, as we\nhave seen in Section 2 above, CA rules are always included as a\nfurther specification of the model.\n\nThe first disagreement may not be very substantial. A CA-world is\ncompatible, for instance, with an eternalist conception. The idea that\nthe world\u2019s next state is computed at any time step can be seen\nas a merely heuristic device, a \u201cshortcut\u201d for a more\nproper eternalist description in which the cell\u2019s states are\nonce and for all \u201cstuck\u201d in their space-time position (we\ndid this ourselves when describing the first picture in this section\nas the complete space-time evolution of a micro-universe). \n\nThe second disagreement concerning the laws of nature may instead be a\nthorny issue. According to Lewis 1973, laws of nature are the true\ngeneralizations found in the deductive system that best describes our\nworld (where \u201cbest\u201d basically refers to the optimal\ntrade-off between strength and simplicity; see the entry on\n laws of nature\n for an introduction to, and further details on, this debate): laws of\nnature supervene on the four-dimensional arrangement of particulars\nand their properties. To the contrary, the standard description of a\nCA does not take the space-time evolution for granted: it takes the\nautomaton\u2019s initial conditions as given, and generates the\nsystem evolution over time via the CA transition function. Particulars\ndepend on laws, not vice versa. A CA world is not laid out in\nadvance, but it grows as long as the laws are applied to particulars\n(a similar point is also made in Wolfram 2002: 484\u2013486).\n\nOn the other hand, one may tentatively interpret, in Lewisian fashion,\nthe laws of a CA as the generalizations contained within the deductive\nsystem that best describes the CA behavior. Let us consider one last\ntime our micro-universe from Rule 110: \n\n\n\nFig. 7\n\n\nA suitable deductive system for this space-time diagram may be\nobtained with just two axioms, one stating the initial conditions of\nthe system, the other phrased as a conditional expressing the CA\ntransition rule. If this conditional is a true generalization embedded\nin the deductive system that best describes our toy universe, then\nRule 110 can count as a Lewisian law of nature in this\nuniverse, as expected.\n",
