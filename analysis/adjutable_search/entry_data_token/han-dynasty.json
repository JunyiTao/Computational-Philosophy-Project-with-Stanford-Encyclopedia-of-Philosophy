These were the\nyears of the Han Dynasty, in its two parts, the Western Han (206\nBCE\u20139 CE) and Eastern Han (25\u2013220 CE). Some of the main\ntrends, ideas, and thinkers of the more than 400 years of the Han\nperiod are discussed in this article. Some of the particularly\nprominent features of Han philosophy in comparison with that of\nearlier periods are: increased focus on metaphysics , the prominence\nof syncretism, new views on language, the rise of naturalism, and\ndebates about methodology. In addition, many of the ideas we associate\nwith Pre-Qin philosophy were developed most fully in the Han.\nRetrospective interpretation in later years, including during the Han\nitself, led to our association of some of these ideas with earlier\ntexts and traditions. Many of the \u201cearly\u201d, pre-Han Chinese\ntexts were actually compiled or created during the Han (see Hunter\n2018; Klein 2010). Even the \u201cschool\u201d categories that we\noften use to classify texts and thinkers from periods prior to the\nHan, such as \u201cConfucianism\u201d (rujia\n\u5112\u5bb6), \u201cDaoism\u201d (daojia\n\u9053\u5bb6), Legalism (fajia \u6cd5\u5bb6), and so\non, were actually Han period creations.

Background\n\nMuch of the most prominent philosophy in the Han period in China was\nclosely associated with the state. Philosophical discussions and texts\nwere commissioned by state or imperial representatives and\norganizations, to help resolve problems or guide political action. By\nthe Han, there had long been a tradition of philosophy associated with\nadvisors to the state. Many of the most well-known philosophers in\nearlier periods had been political advisors, with some notable\nexceptions such as the \u201cDao-tradition\u201d figures represented\nin texts such as the late Warring States Period (475\u2013221 BCE)\ntext Zhuangzi. While prior to the Han, we find a variety of\nphilosophical \u201cschools\u201d associated with different states\nand individuals (as there was no imperial structure), many (but not\nall) of the surviving philosophical texts from the Han are associated\nin some way with the Han state. Some well-known examples of philosophy\nclosely linked to Han imperial concerns and issues are the treatises\nof the early Han advisors Lu Jia (240\u2013170 BCE) and Jia Yi\n(200\u2013169 BCE), the Huainanzi, commissioned by Liu An\n(179\u2013122 BCE), the vassal ruler of the Huainan state and uncle\nof Emperor Wu of Han (156\u201387 BCE), the Yantielun\n(\u201cSalt and Iron Discourses\u201d), the account by Huan Kuan of\na series of discussions organized by Emperor Zhao of Han concerning\nstate production of goods, and the Baihutong, recounting a\nsimilar group of imperially sanctioned discussions. It is not quite\nright, however, to say that in the Han, philosophy becomes the purview\nof the state. Religion, divination, medicine, and other areas of\nthought all contained a great deal of philosophical content. And as we\nwill see, philosophical discussions in the later part of the Han were\nincreasingly independent of the state.\n\nIn the Han we also find the origins of the commentarial tradition on\nphilosophical texts. There was already an established commentarial\ntradition by the time of the Han on the historical and ritual texts\nknown as the Five Classics. The commentarial tradition on the\nancient historical text Chunqiu, in particular, became\ncentral in the early Han. A new commentarial tradition developed in\nthe Han, however, connected to philosophical texts such as the\nAnalects, Daodejing, Zhuangzi, and others.\nThe commentarial tradition surrounding these texts became a major\nsource of philosophical development throughout the rest of the history\nof philosophy in China (see Makeham 2003).\n\nAn additional important feature of Han philosophy is what we might\ncall the \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d. Scientific developments in\nthe Han, particularly in astronomy and medicine, linked philosophical\nconcerns to those of areas that were newly developing at the time and\nmore empirical in nature (see entries on\n Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine\n and on\n science and Chinese philosophy).\n2. Western Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE)\n2.1 Political Thought: Lu Jia and Jia Yi\n\nPolitical philosophy was central to the Han Dynasty from its very\nbeginning. In the Han Shu (Book of the Han), we read that the\nfirst Han emperor, Gaozu (formerly Liu Bang, 256\u2013195 BCE),\ncommissioned a number of scholars to construct texts on subjects\nvaluable for the operation of empire. Lu Jia (d. 170 BCE), one of\nGaozu\u2019s ministers, wrote the Xinyu (\u201cNew\nDiscussions\u201d), the earliest extant treatise on political\nphilosophy and practical government of the Han period. The\norganization of the text follows a pattern that would become common in\npolitical texts throughout the period and into later Chinese history.\nIt begins with theoretical foundations discussing the connection of\npolitical concerns to broader metaphysical concerns, then expands on\nthis to show how the practical application of political ideas\nfollows.\n\nThe first chapter of the Xinyu discusses the foundation of\nthe political project (and the human project more generally) in\nnature, or \u201cheaven\u201d (tian \u5929), borrowing a\nwell-known and contentious concept from earlier Chinese philosophical\ndiscourse. The dao \u9053 (way) of proper action and\ngovernance here is associated with understanding the patterns\n(li \u7406) of heaven and earth. Lu Jia offers a\n\u201crealist\u201d conception of political and ethical principles\n(which early Chinese thinkers see as continuous for the most part).\nThese principles are based in the mind-independent world, rather than\ndependent on human construction. Of course, the distinction between\nmind and world is not heavily stressed in early China. Although early\nChinese philosophers did draw a distinction between mind and body\n(Slingerland 2019; McLeod 2021), we do not find the strong distinction\nbetween mind-dependence and independence that ground conceptions of\nantirealism and realism in contemporary Western philosophical\ndiscourse. The construction of dao (as political and ethical\nprinciples) is dependent on the nature of the world, including facts\nabout patterns (li) as they exist within and determine human\nactivity. Both \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d, that is,\nare responsible for the dao. This is expressed in the\nXinyu as a matter of the ancient sages\u2019 expression of\nwhat they discern in the cosmos/heaven (tian). Lu Jia gives\nus a succinct explanation of this:\n\n\nIn order to determine the Way (dao) of human beings, the\nfirst sage looked up to observe Heaven\u2019s pattern, looked down to\nexamine the configuration of the ground, and then delineated the\nhexagrams Qian and Kun. The people began to become aware, understood\nthe affection between father and son, right conduct between ruler and\nminister, separation between men and women, and proper order of senior\nand junior. Thereupon the numerous offices were established and the\nKingly Way was born. (Xinyu 1.6, Goldin and Sabattini [trans]\n2020: 23)\n\n\nAfter this initial establishment of the Way based on understanding the\npatterns inherent in the world and human nature, more conventional\nnorms still proved necessary. All of the particular manifestations of\nculture were then created by various sages, including the well-known\nConfucian concepts li \u79ae (ritual) and yi\n\u7fa9 (appropriateness). The first stage of construction of the Way\nrequired the coordination of the sage and the patterns of the\nworld\u2014the sage had to make known and usable these patterns.\nAfter this, a more \u201cantirealist\u201d conception was\noffered\u2014more conventional moral and political norms still had to\nbe created from this more basic and abstract conception of the Way.\nThe sages thus established ritual (li \u79ae) and\nappropriateness (yi \u7fa9). Through the sages\u2019\nconstruction of institutions and social systems, as well as their\nmoral and political instruction, they helped people to follow the\nWay.\n\nLu Jia did not treat ethics and politics as distinct from one another\nor from human culture (wen \u6587) more generally. The\nhuman dao includes elements we might distinguish as\npolitical, ethical, aesthetic, etc. Thus, music and dress are\ndiscussed in terms of \u201cproper\u201d and \u201cimproper\u201d,\nalongside considerations of respect for elders and superiors, and\nother principles that we would consider political and ethical. Neglect\nof one of them would inevitably lead to decay in the others.\n\nFollowing the example or direction of the sage is continually\nnecessary because of the human tendency to diverge from the\ndao, according to Lu Jia (Xinyu 1). Seemingly\ninfluenced by the Xunzi and legalist texts such as\nHanfeizi and Shangjunshu, Lu Jia held that having\nthe right structure between ruler and ministers was key to maintaining\norder of the state and moral action. Most importantly, the ministers\nwho serve under a ruler must be morally upright. The ideal ruler,\nfollowing earlier Daoist and Confucian ideas, should be\n\u201cnon-active\u201d (wu wei \u7121\u70ba), employing\nthe right people with the proper motivations and abilities, to ensure\nthe commitment of the rest of society to moral activity. The ministers\nwork in this way as exemplars and influences on those below in\nsociety.\n\nJia Yi (200\u2013168 BCE) was a Han official who served as tutor to a\nnumber of vassal kings associated with the Han\u2014first to the\nruler of the distant southern region of Changsha, and later to the\nruler of the region of Liang (more on this system of government below\nin discussion of the Huainanzi). His political thought is\npresented in the text Xinshu (\u201cNew Writings\u201d).\nDespite debates as to whether the Xinshu was written by Jia\nor later authors in his name, we can take it as representative of an\nimportant strain of Han political thought (Sanft 2005: 6).\n\nThe most famous section of the Xinshu is Jia Yi\u2019s\ncriticism of the Qin, the first imperial dynasty of China which\nunified the \u201cWarring States\u201d in 221 BCE. Jia\u2019s\ncriticism stresses the Qin state\u2019s failure to treat the people\n(min \u6c11) with sufficient consideration. The Qin\u2019s\nharsh treatment of people led to the loss of the obedience required to\nmaintain order in a state. Jia Yi stressed that successful rule was\nonly possible with the consent and obedience of the people\u2014a\nposition referred to as \u201ctaking the people as root\u201d\n(min ben \u6c11\u672c). Jia wrote about the Qin\nrulers:\n\n\n[They] made penalties many and punishments severe. The officers\u2019\nhandling of cases was harsh to an extreme. Rewards and punishments\nwere not appropriate and taxation lacked proper measure. (translated\nin Sanft 2016: 54)\n\n\nTo ensure successful rule, a ruler must govern with\n\u201chumanenness\u201d (ren \u4ec1), a concern for the\nwellbeing of the people that was a major topic of discussion in\nPre-Han Confucian texts. Unlike these earlier Confucians, however, Jia\nYi\u2019s interest in humaneness was mainly with its practical\nbenefits for ensuring the stability of the ruler\u2019s position.\nEarlier Confucians were more concerned with the issue of moral\ndevelopment and the role of humaneness in the development of the\nperson. Jia Yi\u2019s concern with humaneness was about political\nexpediency. Lacking humaneness, as he claims the Qin rulers did, will\ninevitably lead to the collapse of one\u2019s rule. Securing the\ncooperation and support of the people is necessary to maintain a\nstate, and thus the good ruler must attend to this. (Sanft 2005:\n35\u20136) While concern for the people is necessary, Jia does not\ntake the assent of the people to being governed as the ground or\njustification for the ruler\u2019s authority. This authority,\naccording to Jia, is independent of the people. The \u201cpeople as\nroot\u201d position developed in the Xinshu is fully based\nin pragmatic considerations of rulership. In this way, Jia Yi links\nthe ideas developed in early Confucian texts with the pragmatic\n\u201camoralism\u201d of Legalists like Han Feizi who argued for the\nappropriateness of political strategies on the basis of their success\nin maintaining the power of the ruler, rather than on the basis of\nmoral considerations. Jia\u2019s political thought thus represents a\nnew trend in the Han period, one that forms the basis for the ideology\nof what Dingxin Zhao calls \u201cthe Confucian-Legalist state\u201d\n(Zhao 2015). The origins of the political philosophy that would guide\nChinese dynasties through much of the rest of Chinese history are\nfound in the Han.\n2.2 Correlative Metaphysics: Chunqiu Fanlu\n\nThe Chunqiu Fanlu is one of the earliest and most prominent\nHan examples of so-called \u201ccorrelative cosmology\u201d. The\ntext has been traditionally associated with the well-known Han court\nscholar Dong Zhongshu (b. ~195 BCE), an advocate of the tradition\nbased on the Gongyang commentary on the classic history\nChunqiu, a text believed to be essential for understanding\nphilosophy. Three major commentaries on the text, Gongyang,\nZuo, and Guliang, offered different interpretations\nand explanations of the Chunqiu, itself a very sparse and\ndirect text. Different scholastic traditions developed around these\ncommentaries, as groups accepted one or the other of the commentaries\nas authoritative. In early China, particularly in the Han period,\nintellectual \u201cschools\u201d are better understood in terms of\ncommitments to the centrality of certain texts rather than\ncommitment to certain concepts or theories.\n\nIn the Chunqiu Fanlu we also find the development of two\nimportant categories\u2014the \u201cfive phases\u201d (wu\nxing \u4e94\u884c) and yin-yang\n\u9670\u967d\u2014as well as discussion of their connection to\nthe concept of qi \u6c23. The ethical and political content\nof the Chunqiu Fanlu does not differ considerably from the\nstandard \u201cConfucian\u201d views of the time as found in texts\nsuch as those of Lu Jia and Jia Yi, so I here focus on the metaphysics\nof the Chunqiu Fanlu, where we find its most original\ncontribution.\n\nIn what we can call a \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d in Han thought,\nwhich began in the earlier texts of the late Warring States period\nsuch as the Xunzi, we see a move toward the development of\ncorrelative cosmology and new uses of concepts such as qi\n(vital energy) to explain human behavior and guide ethical and\npolitical activity.\n\nDeveloping an older distinction, the Chunqiu Fanlu uses the\ncontrast of yin and yang, the qualities associated\nwith each, and their transformations, to make sense of properties of\nthe world and humans. One of the key features of this naturalistic\nshift of the Han is the view that \u201cheaven/nature and humanity\nare as one\u201d (tian ren yi ye\n\u5929\u4eba\u4e00\u4e5f, CQFL 49.1). The principles and\npatterns that explain the operation of the natural world, such as\nyin-yang and the five phases, also explain human\ncharacteristics, society, and conduct. There is some debate as to\nwhether yin and yang are something like properties\nof their own that belong to objects and events, or whether they are\nqualities or types of qi. In some parts of the text,\nyin and yang are discussed as if they are particular\nand concrete elements of the world, and in other parts of the text\nyin and yang are discussed as features of\nqi. The Chunqiu Fanlu, unlike earlier Daoist texts,\ntakes a partisan stance here, arguing that we should value\nyang over yin. Yang is associated with\npositive features such as virtue, humanity, and life, while\nyin is understood as absence, and associated with the\nopposing features of vice, violence, and death. This contrasts with\nearlier \u201cDaoist\u201d texts, which generally take yin\nand yang to be mutually valuable principles of change, which\nshould be followed as situations call for. The Chunqiu Fanlu\nargues instead that we should \u201chonor yang and denigrate\nyin\u201d (CQFL 43.1), and that \u201cyang is\nlofty, yin is lowly.\u201d (CQFL 43, Queen & Major 2016:\n393)\n\nEverything from the change of seasons to the movement of planets and\nalternation of emotions can be understood in terms of yin and\nyang. The pair gives us a way to make sense of the\nconstructive and deconstructive aspects involved in any change. We can\nunderstand any change or any state as involving contrastive elements\nthat alternate with one another during change. These two complementary\nand oppositional principles of yin and yang (not\nforces or substances but something more like causally efficacious\nqualities or categories) explain the movement and change of things in\nthe world. In most early Chinese texts, yin and yang\nare given a balanced priority. They are equally responsible for the\nemergence of things, each governs half of the year, the day, and\ngrowth. The Chunqiu Fanlu makes the unusual move of elevating\nthe position of yang, making it responsible for a greater\namount, of more potency, and thus ultimately higher value.\n\nIn addition to yin and yang, the Chunqiu\nFanlu also uses the concept of the \u201cfive phases\u201d\n(wu xing) to understand change. The five phases are at the\ncenter of what is known as correlative cosmology\u2014the\nexplanation of things in the world by reference to their correlative\nassociations with other things. A thing is associated with a\nparticular phase or element, with principles of change built into the\nphases or elements, as each has a transformational principle\ndetermined by the phase into which it changes. Xing \u884c\nis in this context generally translated as \u201cphase\u201d because\nof this focus on change. A phase describes not only the nature of a\nthing in its current state, but more importantly the future states of\nthis thing, that into which it transforms. In this sense, the phases\nhad value as predictive features of things. The five phases\nsituate things with respect to their relationships with other\nthings\u2014in terms of their becoming other things, their location,\nroles, and coordinating activities. Chapter 42 of the Chunqiu\nFanlu explains this use of the phases. After explaining the\nordering of the five phases: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, the\nchapter then discusses their relationships, in terms of\ntransformation, location, reciprocal activity, and reliance.\n\n\nMetal gives birth to fire; fire gives birth to earth; earth gives\nbirth to metal; metal gives birth to water; water gives birth to wood.\nThis is their father-son relationship. Wood dwells on the left; metal\ndwells on the right; fire dwells in the front; water dwells in the\nrear; earth dwells in the center. This is their father-son sequence.\nThe phases receive from and distribute to one another. [\u2026] To\nconstantly rely on the father to direct the son is the Way of Heaven.\nTherefore once wood is born, fire nurtures it; once metal dies, water\nburies it. Fire delights in wood and nourishes it with yang, water\novercomes metal and nourishes it with yin. Earth\u2019s managing of\nthe affairs of fire fully expresses its loyalty. Thus the five phases\nexemplify the conduct of the filial son and loyal minister. (Queen\n& Major [trans] 2016: 367\u20138).\n\n\nWe see here that Chunqiu Fanlu combines the five phases\nexplanation of change and interaction with yin and\nyang principles. Yin and yang operate\nwithin the five phases, and are properties of the phases explaining\ntheir relationships to one another. It is in the Chunqiu\nFanlu that we find the fusion of these two previously distinct\ncorrelative systems in an overarching correlative synthesis (even\nthough the synthesis is not perfect\u2014the systems are still very\nmuch treated separately in particular areas of the text, likely due to\nthe composite nature of the text).\n\nThe five phase makes possible both explanation and prediction. When we\nunderstand the interaction of the five phases, it becomes possible to\nunderstand how things will change, which gives us the ability to make\nuse of them. The phases govern activity as well, including human\nactivity. Through understanding the phases we come to understand which\nkinds of activity will be most effective at performing certain kinds\nof tasks, attaining certain kinds of ends. This is all relevant for\nthose in government, particularly the ruler (such people are the\ntext\u2019s primary audience), as understanding of the phases will\nallow the ruler to properly evaluate and appraise others, knowing who\nto elevate to particular positions, based on their abilities as\ndetermined by the phases.\n2.3 Knowledge and Method: The Syncretism of the Huainanzi\n\nOne of the major developments of the Han was the formation of what is\ncommonly known as \u201cHan Syncretism\u201d, associated by some\nwith \u201cschools\u201d such as Huang-Lao and texts such as the\nHuainanzi. The development and nature of Huang-Lao are topics\nstill debated by scholars (see Graham 1991; Major 1993: 10; Chen &\nSung 2015). While the syncretic or synthetic tendency, its ascent, and\nits pinnacle was reached during the Han, such thinking actually had\nits origins much earlier in Chinese history. In Warring States texts\nsuch the Guanzi and Lushi Chunqiu, we find the first\ndevelopments of syncretism. It is in the Han that this trend really\ntakes off, and the Huainanzi represents its high-water\nmark.\n\nEarlier forms of syncretism involved the intentional combination of\naspects of different schools and textual traditions, such as\nConfucianism, Daoism, and Legalism. While we see this to some extent\nin texts like the Chunqiu Fanlu, these forms of syncretism\nwere often not explicit. The Huainanzi, on the other hand,\nopenly discusses its synthesis of ideas from across previously\nopposing schools and traditions. In the Huainanzi, we find a\nspecific methodology for and justification of synthesis built from a\nframework using ideas primarily from the Zhuangzi and\nDaodejing, but involving Confucian, Legalist, and even Mohist\nideas as well. Numerous scholars have debated the ultimate purpose of\nthe Huainanzi\u2019s syncretism (see Goldin 1999;\nVankeerberghen 2001). Clearly there is a political aim of the overall\nproject. Liu An (179\u2013122 BCE), the vassal ruler of the territory\nof Huainan, brought together the scholars who constructed the text.\nLiu was concerned with the ideology of empire. His primary aim was the\ndevelopment of a system synthesizing the numerous and diverse peoples,\ncultures, systems, languages, and ways of life throughout the still\nrelatively new Han empire. The ways of governance and social\nideologies of the past, Liu recognized, may have been acceptable in\nthe smaller-scale societies in which they developed. But these\nsocieties were already unified by language, culture, and social norms.\nImposing the norms and ideology of a single people on others simply\nwould not work in a territory as large and diverse as that controlled\nby the Han. What was needed was a political, ethical, and metaphysical\nsystem that unified the variety of peoples in a single social project\nwhile at the same time allowing for the independence and individuality\nof their local approaches. What resulted from this reflection by the\ncommittee of scholars at Liu An\u2019s court was one of the most\ncomprehensive and powerful syntheses in the history of human thought.\nLiu An\u2019s scholars almost seamlessly combined all of the known\nphilosophical, political, scientific, and religious systems of their\nday into one overarching explanation of the cosmos.\n\nOstensibly the purpose of this, according to Liu An, was to instruct\nhis nephew, Emperor Wu of Han, in the proper ways to maintain the\nempire, unifying the people while allowing for their differences,\nwhich would prove much more effective than attempting to eliminate\nthese differences or impose norms. There was likely another more\npersonal purpose behind the text as well. In the mid to late second\ncentury BCE, the central Han government began moving away from an\nolder model of imperial control in which vassal rulers were given\nindependent control of distant states. These vassal kingdoms were\ngenerally handed out to family or those otherwise demonstratively\nloyal to the Han, such as Liu An, who was the uncle of the Emperor Wu.\nIn the early days of the Han empire, such a political structure was\nnecessary because of the inexperience of the Han court (or any\npolitical entity for that matter) in administering a vast and diverse\nempire. By the time of the Huainanzi\u2019s construction,\nhowever, the Han had developed the experience, organizational\nstructure, and centralized power to more directly administer the\nvarious regions. The central Han government began to take direct\ncontrol of these regions, moving away from the older system of vassal\nrulership. Liu An, as one of these vassal rulers in the dying years of\nthe practice, wanted to secure the practice in order to keep his\nposition and lands. Thus the pluralistic argument of the\nHuainanzi was to a large extent also an argument to Emperor\nWu for why he should leave the vassal kingdoms intact, rather than\nbringing them under the direct control of the Han.\n\nA number of new themes in early Chinese thought are discussed in the\nHuainanzi. The methodology of philosophy is a central concern\nof the text, as discussed in the first two chapters and the final\nchapter in particular. Using a framework that seems to borrow most\nfrom Daoism (Roth 2015: 342), the text aims to create a synthesis of\nnot only other existing intellectual schools, but a variety of other\nmultiplicities. The first two chapters of the text, as well as the\nfinal \u201coverview\u201d chapter offer the main structure for the\nsynthesis of the text, which is explored in specifics in the other\nchapters (Murray 2004). The two main images used are the distinction\nbetween root (ben \u672c) and branches (mo\n\u672b), and the appeal to a unifying \u201cpattern\u201d\n(li \u7406). The Huainanzi argues that the\nunification of all things is explained by the origination of all\nthings in \u201cthe one\u201d (yi \u4e00), which it\nassociated with dao. Things emerge from dao in\nparticular patterns, following yin and yang change.\nWe gain understanding and mastery over ourselves and nature by\nfollowing the myriad things (wan wu \u842c\u7269) as they\ndevelop and change, and their patterns. To do this, we must follow the\nway of tian \u5929 (heaven) rather than that of the human.\nFollowing earlier views of texts such as the Zhuangzi, the\ndistinction drawn between tian and the human (ren\n\u4eba) in the Huainanzi is one of wide vs. narrow focus.\nIt seems to parallel a kind of distinction between the natural and the\nhuman that takes what is associated with the human to be modifying\nnature, with nature as the untouched and separate. The nature/human\ndistinction in the Huainanzi is not total\u2014humanity is\nultimately seen as originating in the same source as the rest of\nnature, somehow operating on the stuff of nature\u2014which later\nchapters (such as ch. 3) understand in terms of the human\n\u201ccompletion\u201d (cheng \u6210) of nature. In\nchapter one, however, a valuation seems to be made, contrasting the\nhuman as the narrow and flawed with the natural as the broad and pure.\nA key passage in Chapter One reads:\n\n\nwhat we call nature is pure and untainted, unadorned and plain, and\nhas never begun to be tainted with impurities. What we call human is\naskew because of wisdom and precedent. It is what looks back to past\ngenerations and interacts with the vulgar. (Huainanzi 1.10,\nMajor, Queen, et al. [trans] 2010: 37)\n\n\nThe human is associated here with desire, intention, artifice, and\nagency, and contrasted with the non-agentive and\n\u201cspontaneous\u201d activity of tian. We have the\nability to act as tian acts by following along with\ntian. This idea is developed in the Zhuangzi and a\nnumber of earlier texts, in which tian and dao are\nsometimes used interchangeably. The Huainanzi, like Daoist\ntexts, locates the problem of human failure, in terms of individual\nthriving, skill and achievement, knowledge, or political organization,\nin the existence of specifically human agency. Like texts\nsuch as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi, the\nHuainanzi presents action in concert with nature\n(tian) and undermining of the specifically human activity\nguided by intention as the keys to ensuring success in all of the\nabove measures. In order to act in this way, however, we must have an\nunderstanding of the patterns of nature, so as to align ourselves with\nthem.\n\nThe Huainanzi has a difficult balancing act to maintain here,\nhowever. While it accepts the Daoist view outlined above concerning\nthe efficacy of following nature and the corrosive nature of\nspecifically human activity, artifice, and tools such as ritual, moral\nnorms, and righteousness (Huainanzi 2.3), it also endorses\nthe Confucian view of the value and necessity of ritual and other such\nhuman inventions. This is partially explained by the account of human\ndevelopment given in Chapter 2. The ancients, according to the text,\nwere able to act in accordance with nature, and thus did not require\nthe artifice of ritual, humanity, and righteousness. In later ages,\nthere was a decline such that ritual and the tools of humanity became\nnecessary. The key to using these artifacts well is to use them\nconsistently with the dao.\n\nThe main argument for synthesis of the Huainanzi is that the\nknowledge to be gained about the world that ultimately allows one to\nattain success can be best attained through understanding what is\ncorrect in all schools and perspectives. The assumption here is that\neach of the competing schools had something right, and was\nproperly responding to some aspect of the world or human life. The\nmistake the various schools made was in their commitment to\npartiality, and the idea that the aspects of the world they\nhad uncovered were the only ones to uncover. When we move beyond this\npartiality, we recognize that each of the myriad schools, teachings,\ncustoms, etc. have some value, if we understand the perspectives from\nwhich they are useful and the aspects of the world they illuminate. A\nkey passage in Chapter Two reads:\n\n\nThe Hundred Schools have different theories, and each has its own\norigins. For example, the relationship of Mozi, Yang Zhu, Shen Buhai,\nand Lord Shang to the Way of Governing is like that of an individual\numbrella rib to the whole canopy and like that of an individual spoke\nto the whole chariot wheel. If you have any one of them, you can\ncomplete the number; if you are missing any one of them, it will not\naffect the utility of the whole. Each one thought that he alone had a\nmonopoly on true governing; he did not understand the genuine\ndisposition of Heaven and Earth. (Huainanzi 2.10, Major,\nQueen, et al. [trans] 2010: 93\u201394 [modified])\n\n\nThe solution the Huainanzi offers to the partiality of the\nmyriad schools is to take the entirety of them, understand how they\nare individually useful, and use them in the right ways. The\nHuainanzi takes this same approach to all areas of human\nknowledge, people, customs, rituals, and things in the world. The sage\naims to understand all of these myriad ways and to thus make\nuse of them, through organizing them in the proper ways. This opens up\na problem, however. How can one possibly understand all\nschools, traditions, peoples, customs, etc? There is far too much\ndiversity and material in the world for any given person to know. The\nHuainanzi\u2019s bold claim is that one can and should\nstrive to attain a summative awareness of all human knowledge. How is\nthis possible?\n\nThe Huainanzi offers a number of ways out of this difficulty,\nbut the most developed one is the use of the distinction between\nroot (ben \u672c) and branch (mo\n\u672b) as applied to areas of knowledge. Each of the various\nschools, areas of human knowledge, and things in the world can be\nconsidered a \u201cbranch\u201d, where the branches are connected to\none another via their grounding in the same \u201croot\u201d. This\nroot can be understood as the pattern (li) of nature\nthat links the branches. The image of the umbrella and rib above shows\nus one example of this, and there are many others in the text. A\npassage in Ch. 2 reads:\n\n\nWhen the myriad things differentiate and branch off, when the hundred\naffairs proliferate and diverge, all have their foundation in a single\nroot, despite their ten million branchings. (Huainanzi 2.11,\nMajor, Queen, et al. [trans] 2010: 94)\n\n\nThe key to understanding (and thus also knowing how to employ) all\nforms of human knowledge is to understand the nature and pattern of\nthe root in which these myriad ways are grounded. The same patterns\nare manifest not only in different areas of human knowledge, subjects,\npeople, customs, languages, etc., but also in the rest of the world.\nOne of the key features of Han syncretic thought and\n\u201ccorrelative cosmology\u201d is the linking of the general\nstructure of humanity and the cosmos (tian), such that the\nvery same patterns govern both. This insight is behind much of what I\nhave called the \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d of the Han, and the\norigins of much of early Chinese science in the Han period. Some\nexamples of this are the development of the medical tradition, found\nin early texts such as the Huangdi Neijing, and the\nsystematization of astronomy, geography, calendrics, and mathematics.\nThe earliest texts in these areas date to the Han period, and we find\ngeneral discussions of these areas in texts such as Huainanzi\nthat attempt to organize all human knowledge. Thus we have chapters on\nastronomy (Tianwen, ch. 3), calendrics and seasons\n(Shize, ch. 5), and other areas of natural science.\n\nThe application of this understanding of the root, according to the\nLiu An\u2019s scholars, is in managerial acumen. The ruler who\nunderstands the root will also understand the value and role of the\nvariety of different regions, people, customs, languages, disciplines,\nschools, and other things that make up the vast collection of things\nin the empire. Only a ruler with such vast understanding could hope to\nbe successful in maintaining order in an empire as broad and diverse\nas the Han. Thus, the art of learning the root underlying all human\nknowledge is part of the art of rulership, which is the central\nconcern of the Huainanzi. As many noticed, however (and was\nsurely intended), this general framework is applicable beyond the case\nof the ruler. The individual reader can benefit from the\nHuainanzi\u2019s model of learning and understanding, for\ntheir own purposes.\n\nOne interesting feature of the Huainanzi is its position on\nthe role of humanity in completing (cheng \u6210) the\ncosmos, through such activity as measurement (ch.3), naming (ch. 1),\nand construction of customs (ch. 11). The Huainanzi focuses\non the role of the human in both understanding the patterns inherent\nin nature, and also in shaping and completing things on the basis of\nthese patterns. In comparison in particular with accounts of agency\nand free will emerging in philosophical contexts of the post-Abrahamic\nWest, the Huainanzi, and Han philosophy in general, has a far\neasier time squaring human activity and that of the extra-human\nworld.\n\nThe Huainanzi represents the most sophisticated expression of\nthe tendency toward synthesis popular in the early Han period, as well\nas the high-water mark of the trend, before it began to recede in the\nyears after the Han political consolidation of vassal states. Despite\nthis, a strong current of the kind of syncretism found in the\nHuainanzi would continue to thrive in Chinese thought,\nultimately facilitating the construction of the unique kinds of\nBuddhist thought that emerged in China in later centuries, which\nheavily borrowed from both Daoist and Confucian ideas.\n2.4 Human Nature: Yang Xiong\n\nYang Xiong (53 BCE\u201318 CE) was one of the last major\nphilosophical figures before the end of the Western Han Dynasty, whose\nlife spanned into the short-lived \u201cinterregnum\u201d period of\nWang Mang\u2019s Xin Dynasty (9\u201323 CE). Yang\u2019s\nlate work represents a crucial pivot point toward the new kind of\nphilosophical thought that would come to dominate in the Eastern Han\nperiod. Though the naturalism of the early Han remained, later Han\nthought moved back toward the kind of metaphysically sparse realism of\nthe pre-Han period, away from the elaborate correlative systems of the\nearlier Han. Yang Xiong\u2019s Fayan (\u201cModel\nSayings\u201d) returns to the style and ideas of early texts such as\nthe Analects.\n\nWhile Yang\u2019s early scholarly reputation was based on his\nfu poems (a genre of polemic poetry generally aimed at\ninfluencing political policy during this time), his best known work\ntoday is his philosophical work, produced later in his life. The\nearlier of these texts, the Taixuanjing (\u201cClassic of\nSupreme Mystery\u201d) is a very much continuous with the correlative\nmetaphysical trends of earlier Han philosophy. The text is an\ndivinatory and philosophical manual in the style of the early\ndivination classic Yijing, and develops a similar correlative\nmetaphysics to ones found in earlier texts such as Chunqiu\nFanlu and Huainanzi. Fayan, perhaps his most\nfamous work, was one of his later works, written during period of Wang\nMang\u2019s Xin Dynasty. While this work is innovative in its return\nto an older style of presentation as well as its presentation of new\ntheories of xing \u6027 (human nature/inborn\ncharacteristics), moral cultivation, and political organization,\nit\u2019s legacy led to the sidelining of Yang Xiong in the later\nChinese tradition. Song Dynasty Neo-Confucians such as Zhu Xi\n(1130\u20131200 CE) criticized Yang on the basis of what they saw as\nthe presumptuousness of his use of the style of the Analects\nfor the construction of Fayan. Because of this, Yang\u2019s\nwork was not included as one of the essential Confucian texts by these\nlater scholars, and this led to the neglect of Yang\u2019s work from\nthis time, given the influence of the Neo-Confucians (Nylan 2014:\n2).\n\nThe correlative model of the Taixuanjing, as it follows in\ngeneral the kind of \u201cFive Phases\u201d thought found in earlier\nworks, is presented in the style of the Yijing, as short\ndescriptions of divinatory tetragrams. It is a notoriously difficult\ntext, written in the same terse, poetic, and suggestive way as the\nYijing itself, and its main focus is divinatory, although\nYang develops some philosophical positions in the text as well.\n\nArguably the most well-known of Yang\u2019s philosophical positions\nis his view of xing \u6027 (human nature/inborn\ncharacteristics), a view later criticized by Neo-Confucians in the\nSong Dynasty because of its inconsistency with Mengzi\u2019s view,\nwhich had by that time become the \u201corthodox\u201d Confucian\nposition. Contrary to the earlier Confucian philosophers Mengzi and\nXunzi, Yang held that human inborn characteristics contain both good\nand evil, and that moral development is a matter of cultivating the\ngood aspects of it, while allowing the evil elements to wither. The\nfact that a particular characteristic is inborn or part of our nature,\naccording to Yang, does not necessitate that we act according to it.\nHumans have the ability (through ritual and other tools) to shape our\ndispositions. Agreeing with earlier Confucians, Yang argues that what\nis contained in our nature must be developed in order to become either\nvirtue or vice. The contents of our nature can be called good or evil,\nbut an individual only becomes virtuous or vicious in connection with\nthese characteristics once they are developed. The key passage in\nFayan reads:\n\n\nHuman xing is a mixture of good and evil. If one cultivates\nthe good aspects one becomes good, while if one cultivates the evil\naspects one becomes evil. As for qi\u2014is it not the horse\nthat carries one to either good or evil? (Fayan 3.2,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n3. Eastern Han (25\u2013220CE)\n3.1 The Development of Late Han Naturalism: Huan Tan\n\nAlthough Huan Tan (43 BCE\u201328 CE) was a contemporary of Yang\nXiong (with whom he interacted), he can be considered the first of the\nphilosophers of the Eastern Han. Like Yang Xiong, Huan was associated\nwith the Xin court of Wang Mang, and was for this reason criticized by\na number of later figures, but unlike Yang, Huan\u2019s life and work\nstretched a few years into the Eastern Han, and Huan\u2019s\nreputation was salvaged to some extent by his continued service as an\nofficial in the second Han Dynasty.\n\nHuan Tan receives a special section here, unlike other of his\ncontemporaries such as Liu Xin, because of his influence on the\nphilosophy of the rest of the Eastern Han, both in argumentative style\nand in content. In Huan\u2019s major philosophical work,\nXinlun (\u201cNew Discourses\u201d), which only exists\ntoday in fragmentary form, he offered a naturalistic and physicalistic\nview of mind/spirit (jingshen \u7cbe\u795e), arguing that\nthe spirit is dependent on and linked to the body, and that it thus\ndies with the death of the body. In this way, Huan criticizes what he\ntakes to be superstitious views accepting the existence of ghosts or\ndisembodied spirits. He also objected to the popular practices of the\ntime of seeking of immortality through alchemy, physical techniques,\nor intellectual cultivation. We cannot, Huan argued, forestall the\nnatural decline and ultimate death of the human organism. This\ncritical spirit taking aim at earlier non-physicalistic views comes to\nmark a number of thinkers in the Eastern Han, most prominently Wang\nChong. Huan describes the connection between the conscious spirit\n(jingshen) and the body (xing) thus, in discussing\nwhat he takes to be the wrongheadedness of the life-extension\ntechniques of esoteric Daoists:\n\n\nThe conscious spirit inhabits the body as a flame does a candle. If\nthe candle is properly tended and turned so that it follows the flame\nneed not be extinguished until the candle is all used up. Of course,\nif the candle has no flame, it cannot become active in the void, nor\ncan its ashes be lighted later. (fragment from Hongming Ji\n5.18, Pokora [trans.] 1975: 76\u201377).\n\n\nWhile the literature of criticism had long been a part of Chinese\nintellectual culture, in Huan\u2019s work we begin to see more direct\nand incisive criticism, rather than the carefully expressed, indirect,\nand suggestive criticism we see earlier in the Western Han, when\nfu poetry was a dominant form of presentation of critique and\nliterary subtlety and indirectness were prized. Such indirect\ncriticism through fu poetry was still practiced in the\nEastern Han, by masters of the art such as Cai Yong, but the more\ndirect critical literature of scholars like Huan Tan came to play a\nlarger role in this period. Huan\u2019s critical stance undermined\nmany earlier traditional practices, such as divination, and he does\nnot, unlike many previous thinkers, rely on historical precedent and\nappeals to the figures of the past. This aligns him to some extent\nwith the realist pragmatism of the Legalists, although it is incorrect\nto see Huan in terms of this older school designation that had no\ncache in the Han. His thought is representative of the critical,\nrationalist, and more insistently naturalist mode of thinking that\nbecame more prominent in the Eastern Han. Huan and others criticized\nwhat they saw as the excesses of the metaphysics of correlative\ncosmology of the Western Han, and its tendency to proliferate entities\nin its ontology, many of which Huan thought were imaginary.\nHuan\u2019s critical style is clearly echoed in later thinkers of the\nEastern Han such as Wang Fu and Wang Chong. Particularly in his\napproach to the classical texts, we find influence on later thinkers\nsuch as Wang Chong. Huan advocated a piecemeal approach rather than\nacceptance or rejection of a text as a whole. We should accept what is\ntrue and reject what is false in the writings of the past.\n\n\nAlthough there are unfounded and outrageous passages in\u2026those\nother books, we must use what is best in them. How dare we talk of\nrejecting them completely? (Xinlun, Pokora [trans.] 1975:\nxvi, 2)\n\n\nHuan\u2019s political and ethical program followed this critical and\npiecemeal approach. While he did not, as early Legalists such as Han\nFeizi, completely reject the way of the sages of the past as a guide\nfor current political practice, he did follow the Legalists in holding\nthat the features of current situations should ultimately determine\npractice, and that at least some of the models of the past should be\nrejected.\n3.2 New Methods in Epistemology and Metaphysics: Wang Chong\n\nWhile the critical and naturalistic thought of Huan Tan is only today\nknown through fragments, we have far more material from Wang Chong\n(27\u2013100 CE), a somewhat similar thinker of the Eastern Han whose\nwork was likely influenced by Huan. While Wang Chong was a somewhat\nmarginal figure in his time (a situation about which he complains in\nhis work), his thought became influential indirectly in later years,\nparticularly in the leadup to the Xuanxue movement in the\nWei-Jin period. Wang\u2019s writing was not only voluminous, but\ncontained a wealth of historical references, quotes, and citations of\nearlier thinkers. Wang apparently studied a wide range of texts, and\nwrote about many of them. Thus, his work survived mainly due to being\ncollected and used as a kind of encyclopedia by figures in the late\nHan and Wei-Jin periods. A number of these figures became prominent in\nthe \u201cQingtan\u201d (pure talk) discussion movement\nthat preceded Xuanxue, and Wang\u2019s ideas influenced the\nmovement via this direction (see McLeod 2020).\n\nWang\u2019s most original contributions were his views on methodology\nand criticism, truth and knowledge, and human nature and agency. A\nnumber of scholars have written in recent years on Wang\u2019s views\non these topics (including Klein & Klein 2016; McLeod 2018; and\nSong 2020).\n\nWang developed a critical method he referred to as wen nan\n\u554f\u96e3 (\u201cquestioning and challenging\u201d), built of\ntwo parts (Lunheng 28). According to Wang, to discern the\ntruth in the texts of the sages of the past, we begin with an\ninvestigation of their words, subjecting them to questioning so as to\nclarify them. The statements or teachings (yan \u8a00)\nfound in texts that are unclear or interpretively ambiguous, Wang\nclaims, should be subjected to clarifying questioning. This\nquestioning aims to remove any lack of clarity and derive a position\nthat can be evaluated on its merits. Once we have clear and evaluable\nstatements, we can then apply the method of \u201cchallenging\u201d,\nwhich more directly evaluates statements by presenting them with\ncounterexamples, looking for cases in which they do not hold, testing\ntheir plausibility, considering their practicability, etc. Wang offers\na general statement of the need for this method in his chapter\n\u201cQuestioning Confucius\u201d, in which he criticizes his\ncontemporaries for their unwillingness to challenge the words of sages\nof the past:\n\n\nWhen the worthies and sages wrote their works, they used their\nthoughts to make a detailed investigation of things. We cannot say\nthat they completely attained the truth (about everything) even then.\nGiven this, how could it possibly be that their everyday and idle\nstatements are completely true? These statements cannot all be true,\nbut the people of today don\u2019t know how to challenge them. Or if\nsome of these statements are true and the ideas imparted are unclear\nand hard to make out, the people of today do not know how to question\nthem. (Lunheng 28.1, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nAccording to Wang, this inability is in part explained by the\nunwillingness of scholars to innovate and to break with the sages. In\nthe chapter Duizuo (Replies on Creation), Wang confronts the\ncommonly held view, expressed in the Analects of Confucius,\nthat it is best to transmit the teachings of the ancient sages rather\nthan to create or innovate. \u201cCreation\u201d (zuo\n\u4f5c) as such was looked at in a negative way in the Han, despite\na wealth of innovation in this period. Using his proposed method, Wang\naimed to distinguish true (shi \u5be6) statements from\nfalse (xu \u865b) statements. Wang understood false\nstatements as ones that tend to have a grip on us for a variety of\nreasons. Wang was not concerned with falsehoods that we have no\ninclination to believe, but rather with ones that have an intrinsic\nattractiveness. He argued that \u201cflowery\u201d (hua\n\u82b1) words have this feature, attracting us due to their style,\nrather than their veridicality. A whole host of human biases\ncontributes to making certain kinds of falsehoods attractive to us. In\naddition to having a preference for flowery words, we are also\ninclined toward those statements and teachings that present us in a\ngood light, feeding our sense of superiority, our vanity, or advancing\nour personal interests. It is this category of statement for which\nWang reserves the category of \u201cfalse\u201d (xu), using\na term that also has the sense of \u201cempty\u201d. Xu\nstatements are attractive statements that lack the important features\nthat make statements true. What makes a statement true (shi)\nis that it has the features we generally seek in evaluating\nstatements, rather than only in particular cases with certain options\nattractive to us. These features will be different depending on the\nkind of statement we are evaluating. A true moral statement will have\ndifferent truth-making features than a statement of medicine or\ngeology.\n\nAnother important issue dealt with in Wang\u2019s work is that of\nhuman nature or inborn characteristics (xing \u6027), which\nis intertwined with a number of concepts, including agency and\nallotment (ming \u547d). Wang develops an account of human\nagency that is remarkably innovative for his time, drawing a contrast\nbetween agency and \u201cspontaneity\u201d or self-action\n(ziran \u81ea\u7136). Wang is concerned with the ways in\nwhich the kind of moral cultivation discussed in earlier texts such as\nthose of the Confucians can make a difference in human behaviors and\nin the outcomes resulting from these behaviors. Can we, through the\nkinds of practices the Confucians enjoin, rectify and change our\nbehavior so as to produce different effects than those that otherwise\nwould have resulted? To accept that human activity can make such a\ndifference in the world seems to conflict with another idea of\nantiquity, that all of us are bound by our allotment (ming),\nwhich is governed by the world. Wang attempts to square these two\nconflicting ideas in numerous chapters of the Lunheng.\n\nAccording to Wang, human inborn characteristics (xing) are\ndetermined by the allotment (ming) provided to humans by\nnature. This process is one absent of agency of any kind, and happens\n\u201cspontaneously\u201d (ziran). Wang uses the image of\ngeneration in nature to describe such spontaneous or non-agentive\nactivity. The act of human procreation, for example, displays both\nagentive and non-agentive features. While individuals decide to engage\nin the procreative act, the generation of the embryo that becomes a\nchild happens spontaneously (ziran), without effort and\nintention. Wang seems to go even further than this toward determinism,\nhowever. He writes that even human behavior is ultimately determined\nby non-agentive features of the world, even bypassing the inborn\ncharacteristics generally taken to explain our behavior, and itself\ndetermined by non-agentive features of the world. Wang writes, in the\nZhiqi (Periods of Government) chapter of\nLunheng:\n\n\nWhen grain is sufficient and there is enough to eat, adherence to\nritual and righteousness are born in the heart. When ritual flourishes\nand righteousness is abundant, the foundations of peace are\nestablished. Therefore in the spring of a year of famine, one does not\neven feed one\u2019s relatives, whereas in the autumn of a year of\nabundance, one calls together one\u2019s neighbors from the four\ndirections to feast. Not to feed relatives is evil conduct, while to\ncall together neighbors from the four directions is good, righteous\nconduct. The formation of good or bad conduct is not a matter of the\nsubstantive character of the person (zhi xing\n\u8cea\u6027), but is rather a matter of the collection of grains.\n(Lunheng 53.6, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nWhile attributing human behavior to such non-agentive external\ncircumstances, Wang also makes room for inborn characteristics\n(xing). These characteristics, which differ by individual on\nthe basis of that individual\u2019s allotment (ming) from\nnature, determine the moral quality of a person\u2019s actions. Wang\nwrites:\n\n\n\u2026in the natural characteristics of persons there is good and\nbad, just like concerning the talents of persons there is high and\nlow\u2026..Natural characteristics and the receipt of one\u2019s\nallotment (ming) are one in the same. Allotment determines\nwhether one is wealthy or impoverished, natural characteristics\nwhether one is virtuous or vicious. (Lunheng 13.19,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nIn linking inborn characteristics concerning the moral quality of\nbehavior to naturally allotted features such as certain kinds of\ntalent, Wang attempts to explain the origins of character in terms of\nultimately spontaneous, non-agentive aspects of the world. Despite a\nseemingly deterministic view of human activity, however, Wang attempts\nto make room for agency and the efficacy of human activity in altering\npatterns. Wang argues that moral education can play a role in\ntransforming human behavior, through transforming one\u2019s\ncharacter, and this involves concerted effort (agentive effort) on the\npart of the individual (Lunheng 5). Wang recognizes that on\nthe face this view seems to conflict with his statements of\ndeterminism elsewhere. To attempt to solve this problem, he relies on\na distinction between three types of allotment (ming). In\nsome earlier texts, ming is understood in a more clearly\ndeterministic way, which is why we commonly see the term translated as\n\u201cdestiny\u201d or \u201cfate\u201d. Wang abandons this strict\ndeterminism here. Human agency can play a role in certain types of\nallotment and not others. Wang writes:\n\n\nTradition says that there are three types of allotment: natural\nallotment, consequent allotment, and incidental allotment. Natural\nallotment is said to be when good outcome issues from the original\nconstitution of itself. Based on natural characteristics in themselves\nthe bones are healthy, therefore one does not have to move away from\nand transform one\u2019s conduct to seek good fortune, but a good\noutcome is achieved from one\u2019s own characteristics. This is why\nit is called natural allotment. Those with consequent allotment exert\neffort to control their conduct and through this achieve good fortune\nand outcome. If they were to allow free rein to their emotions and\ndesires they would come upon misfortune. This is why it is called\nconsequent allotment. As far as those with incidental allotment, their\nconduct is good but they obtain evil, and they are without any hope\nfor help. Meeting with incident externally, they obtain misfortune.\nThis is why it is called incidental allotment. (Lunheng 6.4,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nThe role of agency is emphasized in the second of these three types of\nallotment, consequent allotment (sui ming \u96a8\u547d.\nWe begin with a natural allotment (zheng ming\n\u6b63\u547d) such that particular features of our lives are\ndetermined. This allotment can be altered either by human effort\n(which gives us consequent allotment) or meeting with accidents in the\nworld\u2014incidental allotment (zao ming \u906d\u547d).\nWhile human agency can alter our allotment and thus the outcomes of\nour lives and behaviors, the scope and effect of this activity is\nstill limited by our natural allotment. Indeed, Wang argues that this\nexternal limitation is key to understanding the value and effect of\nmoral instruction and cultivation. This is the case for both\nindividual moral self-cultivation and for the moral instruction of the\npeople by the state and the ruler. Wang writes, in his discussion on\ngovernment in the chapter Zhiqi (Periods of Government):\n\n\nA good doctor is able to use needles and medicines and is successful\nin his arts when he meets with a person who has not yet died who has\nan illness that does not lead to death. If the person\u2019s illness\nis terminal, the doctor can do nothing, even if he is a master. The\nallotment connected to a serious illness is such that it cannot be\ncured, just as disorder among the people cannot be undone. Medicine\ncures illness just as instruction guides and pacifies the people. They\nare both a matter of allotment (ming) and the times, and\ncannot be attained by ordering or using force. (Lunheng 53.3,\nauthor\u2019s translation).\n\n3.3 Ban Zhao and the Scholarship of Women\n\nBan Zhao (c. 45\u2013116 CE) is an interesting figure in early\nChinese history for a number of reasons. The younger sister of the Han\ncourt historian Ban Gu and the grandniece of the famous concubine\nknown as Ban Jieyu (jieyu being a rank title) noted for her\nscholarship, Ban Zhao had an unusually scholarly upbringing for a\nwoman of the era. She became an important scholar of the period,\ncomposing numerous works on ethics, politics, history, and astronomy.\nHer most well-known works are the N\u00fcjie (Instructions\nfor Women), a guide to norms concerning virtue and conduct for women,\nand her completion of the official court history of the Western Han,\nthe Han Shu, after her brother Ban Gu died in prison in 92 CE\nbefore its completion.\n\nThe N\u00fcjie is a compendium of norms for women, social and\nmoral, in line with traditional Confucian views. One of these views\nwas that virtue was relative to role and position in society. Not only\nwould a virtuous ruler and a virtuous servant look different because\nof their different ways of manifesting particular kinds of virtue, but\nthe virtues exemplified by the virtuous ruler and servant were\ndifferent. There was a heavy focus in early Confucianism on roles\nconnected to relationships, with the central relationships in human\nlife being seen as those between parent and child, ruler and servant,\nand husband and wife\u2014part of the so-called \u201cFive\nRelationships\u201d (wu lun \u4e94\u502b). Ban\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie focused specifically on the virtues proper to the\nwoman as wife, that is, mainly in relationship to her\nhusband, and to a lesser extent toward her children. As with\ndiscussions of role norms for other individuals in Confucian texts,\nthe focus in the N\u00fcjie is very much on the\nresponsibilities of the wife toward the husband. The earlier Western\nHan author Liu Xiang\u2019s Lien\u00fc Zhuan\n(\u201cBiographies of Exemplary Women\u201d) contained many examples\nof virtuous women, including Ban Zhao\u2019s ancestor Ban Jieyu. It\nseems that despite the focus on presenting women as ideally\nsubordinate in key ways to men, particularly with respect to a\nhusband, there was no strict regulation against women engaging in\nscholarship. Indeed, Ban\u2019s description of her own situation and\nher motivation for writing the N\u00fcjie gives us a window\nonto the lives and expectations of women in the Eastern Han\nperiod:\n\n\n\u2026at the age of fourteen I was in charge of the work of dustpan\nand broom in the Cao family. Now, more than forty some years have\npassed; during these years, trembling with fear, I was constantly\nafraid that I may be dismissed or humiliated. Such an incident, if it\nhappened, would have brought disgrace upon my parents and burdened\nmembers of my husband\u2019s family, as well as my natal family.\n[\u2026] It grieves me to see you, my daughters, who have just\nreached the age of marriage, to not have been gradually taught more\nnor have you learned proper rituals of being a married woman.\n[\u2026] For this reason, I have composed the seven chapters of the\nN\u00fcjie. (Preface to N\u00fcjie, Pang-White\n[trans.] 2018: 41)\n\n\nWhile it is interesting and unique in the history of this period to\nsee women associated with scholarship as these two famous women of the\nBan family, the virtues of women according to these texts were very\ndifferent than those of men in most roles, with perhaps the exception\nof the role of subordinate to ruler. It is also important to note\nthat, while the responsibilities of women, according to texts like the\nNujie, tends to be other-directed in nature, most of the\nresponsibilities of men share these features as well. One has the\nresponsibility to subordinate oneself to people such as parents,\nsuperiors in society, and the ruler, whether man or woman. The end\ngoal of this is both social harmony and a good name, in terms of\ncontribution to overall harmony (N\u00fcjie 7, Pang-White\n[trans.] 2018: 64).\n\nAccording to Ban, humility is one of the main virtues women should aim\nto cultivate. Humility here is understood as \u201cputting others\nbefore oneself\u201d (xian ren hou ji\n\u5148\u4eba\u5f8c\u5df1). This seems to be an extension of\nthe view expressed in the Analects of Confucius (12.1), that\n\u201crestraining the self and returning to ritual\u201d is the key\nto developing virtue. Despite Ban\u2019s following of traditional\nnorms throughout the N\u00fcjie, there are certain passages\nwhere we see criticism of common practices of her society, including\nthe neglect of education of women and girls. She writes:\n\n\n\u2026only to educate men and not to educate women\u2014are they\nnot being partial in their treatment of the two sides? According to\nthe Liji, at the age of eight, children should begin\nreceiving instruction on the classics. At the age of fifteen, they\nshould receive an adult education. Why is women\u2019s education\nalone not following this as a principle? (N\u00fcjie 2,\nPang-White [trans.] 2018: 48)\n\n3.4 Politics of Reclusion: Wang Fu\n\nThe work of Wang Fu (82\u2013167 CE) represents one of the strains of\nConfucian thought that began to gain new ground in the Eastern Han as\nthe dynasty went into decline leading toward the series of\ncatastrophes that would end with the collapse of the Han in the late\nsecond and early third centuries CE. The tradition of social criticism\nhad long been part of Confucian scholarship, but Wang Fu\u2019s work\nQianfulun (Discourses of a Hermit) revived the theme of\nConfucian reclusion, a controversial idea, though one suggested in\ntexts such as the Analects itself. Perhaps the most famous\nexample of such reclusion (in Wang\u2019s time and our own) was that\nof the Warring States Period scholar Qu Yuan (c. 340\u2013278 BCE),\nthe subject and purported author of the poems of the Han period\ncompilation Chuci (Songs of Chu). Qu Yuan, faced with the\ndecline of society past the point of reformation, went into exile in\nthe distant wilds, composing his laments including the famous poem\nLi Sao (compiled in the Chuci), and eventually\ncommitting suicide by drowning himself in the river as a final act of\nrighteous protest (see Berkowitz 1992; Schneider 1980).\n\nWang Fu\u2019s Qianfulun is in part a revival of the\napproach of Confucian disengagement, offering a solution to the\ntension between social concern and personal virtue. Early Confucians,\nhundreds of years before Wang Fu\u2019s time, stressed the importance\nof strong commitment to the development and moral rectification of\nsociety as a whole. The morally developed person, according to these\nthinkers, has a commitment to the community that is not contingent on\nthe goodness of the community. This must be the case for all of the\ncommunities that one is part of and that make up vital facts about who\none is\u2014the state, the village, the family. One cannot abandon or\nturn one\u2019s back on a corrupt or vicious family, but instead must\nput their effort into trying to rectify this community. To do less\nthan this would be a failure of one\u2019s humanity. We find many\npassages in the early texts committing to such a view (for example\nAnalects 4.18). At the same time, we find an alternative\nresponse developed in these same texts, including the\nAnalects (8.13; 15.6) and Xunzi (32.7). The\ncommitted and morally developed person has a responsibility to take an\nactive role in the community when the times (shi \u6642)\nare such that either the moral way prevails or it is possible that one\ncan bring it about. But when the times are such that the moral way is\nabandoned and it is impossible to bring it about, the morally\ndeveloped person should stay away from taking an active role, lest\nthey become morally soiled.\n\nIn the late Han, the theme of disengagement and reclusion due to\nmorally corrupted government, which had been popular in the Warring\nStates but had declined through the years of the earlier Western and\nEastern Han, was revived, with thinkers like Wang Fu at the forefront\nof this movement. Wang Fu\u2019s advocacy of retreat from society is,\nlike those of the Confucian recluses of the past, ultimately aimed at\nrestoring virtue to society. Wang recognized that when a community\npasses a certain threshold of viciousness and disorder, it is not\npossible for the individual to transform it. The only possible outcome\nin such a case, if the individual engages with the society, is for the\nindividual to be transformed, to become vicious and disordered like\nthe community. Despite the loftiest intentions and the most developed\ncharacter, one cannot withstand the transformative power of the\ncommunity. Thus, remaining within a corrupt community with the\nintention of changing it would lead only to the corruption of the\nindividual rather than the moral salvation of the community.\n\nWang Fu\u2019s response is to advocate continuation of the work of\nattempting to morally rectify the community, from the outside, through\nsuch activity as scholarship and writing. Even if this is for the\nbenefit of future generations rather than one\u2019s own, one\u2019s\nresponsibility to the community and commitment to it should not\ndiminish even when one is forced to withdraw from society due to its\nviciousness. While the theme of Confucian reclusion is perhaps the\nmost important aspect of Wang Fu\u2019s work, we find a number of\nother standard Confucian ideas developed in the Qianfulun,\nincluding views on rulership, virtues, learning, ritual, and even some\nfurther development of the correlative metaphysics of the earlier\nHan.\n3.5 Philosophy of Language: Xu Gan on Name and Actuality\n\nXu Gan (170\u2013217 CE) might be considered the last major\nphilosophical figure of the Han period. He was one of a group of\nscholars active in during the Jian An reign period\n(196\u2013220 CE) in the late Han, during which the Han emperor was a\nmere puppet and figurehead, and the region was torn in warfare between\ncompeting warlords such as the famous Cao Cao (whose son would\nestablish the Wei state in 220 CE), Liu Bei (who established a new\nstate also named Han, today referred to as Shu Han, in the same year),\nand Sun Quan (who founded the state of Wu). Known as the \u201cThree\nKingdoms\u201d, these states would vie for supremacy for almost a\ncentury, until the reunification by the Jin Dynasty in 280 CE. This\nwas one of the most famous periods of Chinese history, immortalized by\nthe fourteenth century CE writer Luo Guanzhong\u2019s classic novel\nSanguo Yanyi (\u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d).\nXu Gan was one of the scholars known as the \u201cSeven Masters of\nJian An\u201d. Five of the seven died in the plague of 217 CE,\nincluding Xu Gan, only 47 years old at the time.\n\nWhile he was concerned with many of the standard Confucian issues,\nsuch as the efficacy of ritual, the need for moral self-cultivation,\nand creating proper moral motivation (among others), his most unique\ncontribution was in the area of language, particularly in the\nconsideration of the connection between language, reality, and moral\nbehavior. Xu followed the kind of critical evaluative methodology\ndeveloped by philosophers such as Huan Tan and Wang Chong. A number of\nthe essays of his major work, Zhonglun (Discourses Hitting\nthe Mark), focus on criticisms of common views and practices Xu saw as\nultimately harmful to the individual and society, such as\n\u201cdisputing\u201d without aiming at truth. In a passage\nreminiscent of Wang Chong, in his chapter Hebian (\u201cAn\nExamination of Disputation\u201d), Xu writes:\n\n\nWhat the vulgar person calls \u201cdisputation\u201d is not\ndisputation at all. That he should call it disputation, though it is\nnot, is probably because he has heard the name\n\u201cdisputation\u201d but does not know its actuality.\nAccordingly, we regard this as preposterous. The person who is\ncommonly referred to as \u201cdisputer\u201d is, in fact, a glib\nperson. The glib person readily embellishes the tone of his voice and\nmultiplies his retorts, just like the onset of a gale, or the downpour\nof a rainstorm. Disregarding the inherent rights and wrongs of a\nsituation, and not understanding the principles of truth and\ndistortion, he fixes it so that he is never at a loss for words and\nworks at securing certain victory. [\u2026] Disputation is about\npersuading people in their hearts; it is not about verbal submission.\nHence disputation is to articulate distinctions, and also to separate\nand distinguish different categories of affairs skillfully, so as to\narrange them clearly. Disputation does not mean being quick-witted in\none\u2019s words and speech to talk over people\u2019s heads.\n(Zhonglun 8.1, Makeham [trans] 2002: xxiv\u2013xxv)\n\n\nXu\u2019s theory of the connection between names (ming) and\nactualities (shi) drew on but further developed earlier views\nof the efficacy of language in moral development. Names, or terms,\nshould be applied to things in particular ways that suggest proper\nuses. We can improperly apply names when we apply them not with the\naim of communal harmony or individual moral instruction, but with the\naim of advancing our own reputations or selfish interest. When we use\nnames in these unsatisfactory ways, this reduces their efficacy in\ncreating the kinds of motivational effect that is the fundamental use\nof names. The key in using names correctly is to ensure that names are\ntied to the actualities with which these names are associated. Xu\ndescribes the connection between name and actuality:\n\n\nA name is that which is used to name an actuality. When an actuality\nhas been established, its name follows after it; it is not the case\nthat a name is established and then its actuality follows after it.\nThus if a long shape is established, then it will be named\n\u201clong\u201d, and if a short shape is established, it will be\nnamed \u201cshort\u201d. It is not the case that the names\n\u201clong\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d are first established and\nthen the long and short shapes follow after them. That which Confucius\nvalued were those \u201cnames\u201d which truly name actualities. In\nso valuing names, he thereby valued actualities. Names are tied to\nactualities just as plants are tied to the seasons. In the spring,\nplants blossom into flower; in summer, they are covered in leaves; in\nautumn, their foliage withers and falls; and in winter, they bear\nfruit. This is not acting for a specific purpose and yet the plant\ncompletes itself. If a plant is forced, its natural tendencies will be\nharmed. It is the same with names. Hence, false name makers are all\nthose who would harm names. People are aware only of the good that is\ndone by names and are ignorant of the bad that is done by false name\nmakers. (Zhonglun 11.5, Makeham [trans.] 2002:\n149\u2013150)\n\n\nActualities (shi \u5be6), for Xu Gan, are independent of\nhuman activity and \u201cestablished\u201d (li \u7acb) by\nthe world itself. John Makeham defines Xu Gan\u2019s conception of\nactuality as\n\n\na state of development peculiar to an entity or state of affairs by\nvirtue of which that entity or state of affairs is what it is.\n(Makeham 1994: 27)\n\n\nA name or term is attached naturally to this\u2014while our language\nis in some sense conventional, actualities are described by particular\nnames independently of the way we accord these names to objects.\nXu\u2019s example in the above passage of \u201clong\u201d\ndemonstrates this. When we describe a particular object as\n\u201clong\u201d, we use an already existent term, with an\nindependent meaning, to describe a particular actuality. The\nconnection between this name and the actuality of an object is\ndetermined independently of our determination. We can choose to\ncorrectly use the term \u201clong\u201d to describe the object or\nincorrectly use the term \u201cshort\u201d, but the latter term does\nnot match the actuality of the long object (setting aside here the\nissue of the issue of the conventional or comparison-relative nature\nof concepts such as long and short). A name, according to Xu, follows\nor it attached naturally to a particular actuality, and to improperly\nuse a name (to call the long thing \u201cshort\u201d, for example)\nis to damage the nature (xing \u6027) of that name. Its\nnature is damaged due to improper associations based on incorrect use.\nWhen we use the term \u201cshort\u201d to describe things that are\nlong, this throws people into confusion concerning the term\n\u201cshort\u201d as well as the term \u201clong\u201d. We can no\nlonger clearly describe the actualities of things, because of the\nobfuscation of associations. Using the term \u201cshort\u201d will\nafter time become unable to express the actuality, as its application\nto things without the actuality corresponding to the name will become\npart of the accepted or expected usage of the name, and the name will\nlose its proper meaning. \u201cShort\u201d will come to mean\n\u201clong\u201d to some, \u201cshort\u201d to others, and\n\u201can open question as to long or short\u201d to many as\nwell.\n\nFor Xu, as for Confucians more generally, creating confusion\nconcerning names is most harmful because it impedes the process of\nmoral cultivation and maintenance of social harmony. One important\nsource of incorrect use of names is disputation by those seeking to\ngain a name for themselves rather than seeking the truth. When\none\u2019s goal is simply to look better than others in disputation,\nrespecting the connection between names and actualities is not\nimportant. Those whose focus is on disputation for this reason are\ndangerous. Proper disputation, according to Xu, aims to attain truth\nso as to achieve individual and social moral development. Xu\nwrites:\n\n\nThe glib person readily embellishes the tone of his voice and\nmultiplies his retorts, just like the onset of a gale, or the downpour\nof a rainstorm. Disregarding the inherent rights and wrongs of a\nsituation, and not understanding the principles of truth and\ndistortion, he fixes it so that he is never at a loss for words and\nworks at securing certain victory. [\u2026] The words used in\ndisputation should be terse and to the point, unconvoluted and\ninformative. The tempo of their delivery needs to be modulated so that\nthey do not transgress the ritual teachings and their import should\nserve as a worthy complement to those teachings. (Zhonglun\n8,1. Makeham [trans] 2002: 99\u2013100)\n\n\nInstead of looking to further one\u2019s reputation by means of\nduplicitous application of names and thus reducing the efficacy and\nmeaning of names, one should strive to cultivate virtue (de\n\u5fb7), which is the actuality of the exemplary person\n(junzi \u541b\u5b50). With the elevation of one\u2019s\nactuality, both reputation and authority will increase naturally (as\nmoral influence is gained with name and fame).\n\nAs with previous Confucian thinkers, Xu recognizes that those who are\nauthentically virtuous are not always successful. Indeed, he thinks\nthat the situation in the Eastern Han is such that those with the\nhighest positions are far from virtuous. He explains this in the\nstandard Confucian way by explaining that the times (shi)\nmake a difference, and that even the most virtuous scholar will not\nmeet with fortune if encountering the wrong time. What constitutes the\ntime (shi) is a matter of communal habits, beliefs, quality\nof rulership, and natural state. If one is born into a time of decay\nin a state, with weak and unvirtuous leadership, disasters like\ndrought, and communal apathy, then one will likely not advance to a\nhigh state of reputation, even with the highest virtue. This is a\nsituation that Confucians from the earliest times worried about, and\nwe see it discussed in all of the thinkers mentioned here from the\nEastern Han as well. Echoing Wang Fu, however, Xu Gan holds that if\nthe times are such that the virtuous person cannot thrive in society,\none should abandon society and focus on developing his own qualities\n(Makeham 1994: xii).\n\nXu Gan uses the structure of ben-mo \u672c\u672b (roots\nand branches) developed in earlier Han texts such as the Huainanzi to\nexplain the relationship between virtue (de \u5fb7) and\nhuman arts (yi \u85dd). He reverses what we see in thought\nof Jia Yi, who takes virtue to be an adornment and guide for\ngoverning. Xu argues that the arts (including ritual and even\npresumably governing) cannot be perfected without virtue. At the same\ntime, he asserts that virtue also cannot be completed (cheng\n\u6210) without the arts. The two are interdependent\n(Zhonglun 7.1).\n\nOne aspect of Xu Gan\u2019s thought which have led some to declare\nhim (and some similar Han thinkers) as a \u201cLegalist\u201d\n(fajia \u6cd5\u5bb6) philosopher is his endorsement of\nthe view that timely and consistent reward and punishment are\nessential tools for governing, shared by Warring States legalist\nthinkers such as Han Feizi, Shang Yang, and Shen Buhai (Makeham 1994:\n264, Zhonglun 19). While, as I mention above, school\ncategories are of limited use in categorizing Eastern Han thinkers, Xu\ncertainly has much more in common with early Confucians than with\nWarring States Legalists, even though it becomes more popular in the\nEastern Han to adopt the Legalist position concerning reward and\npunishment.\n4. The Transition to Three Kingdoms and Wei-Jin\n\nToward the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty and into the fractious\n\u201cThree Kingdoms\u201d period, a commentarial and collective\nscholarly literature surrounding Confucius (rather than later\nexponents of the tradition such as Mengzi or Xunzi) became popular. A\nnumber of volumes emerged that collected (and added) stories about\nConfucius and extant sayings purported to be of Confucius, from a\nnumber of earlier sources. Two of these volumes, the Kongzi\nJiayu (Discussions of the Confucius School) and Kong\nCongzi (Collected Sayings of Confucius) were compiled just after\nthe end of the Han Dynasty, during the revolts of the Three Kingdoms\nperiod, by the Cao Wei court scholar Wang Su (195\u2013256 CE). This\ncompilation was part of a general concern with and debate surrounding\ncommentaries on the classics. It became common in the modern period to\ndismiss Wang Su\u2019s collections as \u201cforgeries\u201d, but\nthis makes little sense, given that Wang\u2019s compilations drew\ntogether passages from a host of other well-known sources. The\ncommentarial tradition on such texts as the Analects and\nLaozi took hold in the Han, with one of the most famous\ncommentarial collections, the Lunyu Jijie (\u201cCollected\nExplanations of the Analects\u201d) produced by a team of\nCao Wei scholars associated with He Yan, who played a major role in\nthe development of the Xuanxue (Neo-Daoist) movement in the\nWei-Jin period.\n\nA number of other important texts dealing with philosophically\nimportant topics were written or compiled in the Han as well. The\netymological dictionary Shuowen Jiezi of Xu Shen\n(58\u2013147 CE) had a major influence on later understandings of\nimportant philosophical terms, despite its sometimes fanciful and\nquestionable etymologies, and is still consulted today. The\nBaihutong Delun, an account of an important council held in\n58 CE, was compiled by Ban Gu, brother of Ban Zhao and the primary\nauthor of the Han Shu (Book of the Han). In addition, it is\nin the Eastern Han that we see the first references to Buddhism, a\nreligious and philosophical tradition that would come to play an\nenormous role throughout the rest of Chinese history. Though knowledge\nof Buddhist teachings seems to have been relatively limited at the\ntime, we find references to the Buddha as a seemingly Daoist-like\nfigure. In the minister Xiang Kai\u2019s (d. 184 CE) memorial to\nEmperor Huan in 166 CE, recorded in the Hou Han Shu, we find\none of the earliest references to Buddhism. Discussing an image of the\nBuddha found in the palace, Xiang gives a brief account of Buddhist\nviews and links them with the Huang-Lao teachings, focusing on\nemptiness, eliminating desires, and \u201cnon-forced action\u201d\n(wu wei \u7121\u70ba).\n\nMoving into the Three Kingdoms and the Wei and Jin periods, we see the\nrise of Buddhist thought (and philosophy) in China and the development\nof \u201creligious Daoism\u201d, as personal and individual concerns\nstart to take central stage, over the communal and political concerns\nthat had been central to earlier periods of Chinese history. The\nreasons for this shift are not altogether clear, but one plausible\nstory is that the breakdown of Han government and the roots of the\nshift to the internal with its roots in Eastern Han withdrawal and\nculminating in Xuanxue thought of figures like Guo Xiang\n(252\u2013312 CE) and Wang Bi (226\u2013249 CE) are partly\nresponsible for this shift (Holcombe 1994: 87\u201390). Many of the\nconcerns and themes of Eastern Han endure throughout the history of\nChinese thought. Particularly, the conflict between individual\nretirement from worldly concerns (in either Confucian or Buddhist\nmode) and the duty to engage in the social project, as well as\neremeticism as a form of protest, remain major features of Chinese\nintellectual life down to the current day.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Texts Cited", "Further Readings on Han Philosophy", "Works Cited"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Texts Cited": "</h3>\n<p>\nAll citations of Chinese texts follow the Chinese Text Project (CTP)\n (<a href=\"https://ctext.org/\" target=\"other\">https://ctext.org/</a>)\n numbering.
