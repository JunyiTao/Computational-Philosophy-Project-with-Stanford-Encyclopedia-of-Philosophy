    "main_text": "J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha || Contributions\n7.2 Contributions\n\nLike all the M\u0101dhyamika thinkers who came before him,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha regards it vitally important to have a clear\nunderstanding of two kinds of truth, the conventional and\ntransactional truth of everyday life, and the truth that liberates one\nfrom attachment, aversion and delusion, this liberation being the\nultimate goal (param\u0101rtha) of Buddhism. In talking about\nthese two truths, J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha draws liberally from the\nwork of Dharmak\u012brti, who had in turn built upon the\nepistemological foundations laid by Dign\u0101ga. Dharmak\u012brti had\nsaid that successful action is preceded by correct cognitions; what\none deems to be truthful is any cognition that motivates action that\nleads to expected results. A true belief, then, is one that does not\ndeceive one by promising to lead to a desired goal and then failing\nsomehow to lead to that goal. A more positive way of expressing this,\nrather than saying a true belief is non-deceptive, is to say that a\ntrue belief is one that enables the realization of a goal\n(artha-kriy\u0101-samartha). It turns out, said\nDharmak\u012brti, that correct reasoning is instrumental in helping\none form beliefs that motivate successful action. Therefore, one can\nsay that conceptual thinking, when done carefully, can be of great\nvalue. Even when one\u2019s goal is to achieve nirvana by having a\ndirect experience of a still and peaceful awareness that is not\nconceptual and therefore beyond the range of language, one can arrive\nat that goal by learning to think carefully and clearly. Clear and\ncareful thinking has the capacity to identify which of the ideas that\narise in consciousness are ungrounded and delusional and therefore\nunlikely to motivate successful action. Clear and careful thinking\nabout what one hears others say enables one to discard teachings that,\nif acted upon, are unlikely to produce expected results and to follow\nteachings that, if acted upon, will lead one to a desired goal, even\nthe goal of the stillness of a mind that is not dealing in narratives\nand concepts. Without much modification, J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha takes\nup Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s terminology and the convictions that go\nwith it. So J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, like Bh\u0101vaviveka, sees value\nin conceptual thinking and in careful thinking and speaking and sees\nless of a need than Candrak\u012brti and \u015a\u0101ntideva saw in\nfinding a way to eliminate all conceptual thinking and theorizing.\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s indebtedness to the epistemological\ntradition notwithstanding, he is still very much a M\u0101dhyamika in\nthat much of his approach consists in showing the absurdities that\nlurk menacingly inside all constructed theories. His notion of the\nultimate goal, like Candrak\u012brti\u2019s, is a wordless and\nconcept-free lucid awareness, but he sees it as possible to reach that\ngoal by using words and thoughts intelligently. Moreover, he agrees\nwith other M\u0101dhyamikas in his conviction that all thinking, even\nthat which can be called verdical because it leads to expected\nresults, is based on a presupposition that things have inherent\nnatures\u2014it is, after all, almost impossible to talk without at\nleast an implicit nod in the direction of inherent natures and\nessences\u2014and that that presupposition is demonstrably false. So\naccording to J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha rational thinking is\nsimultaneously veridical, in that it leads to expected results, and\nfalse, in that it is based upon the demonstrably false presupposition\nthat things that can be named are namable because they have inherent\nnatures. While language operates within an ontology of causes and\neffects and various other kinds of relationship, such as temporal and\nspatial relationships, it can be shown that those relationships are\nall untenable if one thinks about them carefully and investigates them\ndeeply enough.\n\nAt the heart of J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s argument against the\ntenability of causality is his argument that none of the possible ways\nof looking at the relation of conditions and their effects are\nworkable. There are four possibilities. Either many conditions produce\na single effect, or many conditions produce many effects, or a single\ncondition produces many effects, or a single condition produces a\nsingle effect. His presentation of an explanation for why each of\nthese possibilities is untenable is in places terse and difficult to\ndecipher. A single thing, such as vision, cannot be the effect of many\nconditions, such as the eye, visible color, an attentive mind and so\nforth, he says, because the effect has the feature of being one, while\nthe causes are many, but there is nothing to account for what causes\nthe reduction of many things to one. Without some coherent account of\nhow a manifold can be reduced to a singularity, this hypothesis ends\nup being merely an assertion. If one imagines that a manifold set of\ncauses produces a complex multiplicity of effects, then one is saying\nin effect that each component of the complex cause is producing one\ncomponent of the complex effect, and this amounts to saying that there\nare many instances of one cause producing one effect. On the other\nhand, if one thinks that each aspect of the complex effect is a single\neffect of the totality of features within the complex cause, then one\nis saying that a single effect has many conditions, which has already\nbeen ruled out. Moreover, one faces the problem of explaining how the\nsame totality of causes can have many distinct effects, each of which\nis a feature of the complex effect putatively arising from the causal\ncomplex. If one imagines that a multiplicity, such as the manifold\nuniverse, arises out of a single cause, such as God or Brahman or\nconsciousness, then one must provide a coherent account of what causes\nthe differentiation among the many effects. What one would expect is\nthat some auxiliary condition combines with the single cause to\nproduce different effects; but if that is the case, then a single\ncause plus an auxiliary condition is not really just a single cause.\nFinally, one might imagine that a single cause produces a single\neffect, such as when one momentary phenomenon perishes and in the act\nof perishing gives rise to a subsequent momentary phenomenon of the\nsame kind. That, however, is impossible, since the putative cause must\ngo entirely out of existence before its successor can takes its place,\nand once the preceding phenomenon has ceased to exist, there is\nnothing to cause its successor to arise. Since none of the possible\nways of explaining causality turns out to survive close analysis, one\ncan only conclude that the very ideas of causality, and of arising and\nperishing, and of unity and multiplicity cannot correspond to reality.\nCausality and arising and perishing and all the various relations that\nfurnish the framework of conventional truth may be indispensable to\nconventional truth, but they cannot be features of reality.\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, like the M\u0101dhyamikas who came before\nhim, sees conventional truth as a kind of screen or obstacle to the\nreality that becomes apparent only to an awareness that is\nunencumbered by concepts and narratives.\n",
