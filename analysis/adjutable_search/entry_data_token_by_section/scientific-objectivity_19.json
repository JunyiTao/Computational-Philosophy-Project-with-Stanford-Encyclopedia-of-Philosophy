(Guyatt et al. 1992: 2420)\n\n\nTo call the new movement \u201cevidence-based\u201d is a misnomer\nstrictly speaking, as intuition, clinical experience and\npathophysiological rationale can certainly constitute evidence. But\nproponents of evidence-based practices have a much narrower concept of\nevidence in mind: analyses of the results of randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs). This movement is now very strong in biomedical\nresearch, development economics and a number of areas of social\nscience, especially psychology, education and social policy, and\nespecially in the English speaking world.\n\nThe goal is to replace subjective (biased, error-prone, idiosyncratic)\njudgments by mechanically objective methods. But, as in other areas,\nattempting to mechanize inquiry can lead to reduced accuracy and\nutility of the results.\n\nCausal relations in the social and biomedical sciences hold on account\nof highly complex arrangements of factors and conditions. Whether for\ninstance a substance is toxic depends on details of the metabolic\nsystem of the population ingesting it, and whether an educational\npolicy is effective on the constellation of factors that affect the\nstudents\u2019 learning progress. If an RCT was conducted\nsuccessfully, the conclusion about the effectiveness of the treatment\n(or toxicity of a substance) under test is certain for the particular\narrangement of factors and conditions of the trial (Cartwright 2007).\nBut unlike the RCT itself, many of whose aspects can be (relatively)\nmechanically implemented, applying the result to a new setting\n(recommending a treatment to a patient, for instance) always involves\nsubjective judgments of the kind proponents of evidence-based\npractices seek to avoid\u2014such as judgments about the similarity\nof the test to the target or policy population.\n\nOn the other hand, RCTs can be regarded as \u201cdebiasing\nprocedure\u201d because they prevent researchers from allocating\ntreatments to patients according to their personal interests, so that\nthe healthiest (or smartest or\u2026) subjects get the\nresearcher\u2019s favorite therapy. While unbalanced allocations can\ncertainly happen by chance, randomization still provides some warrant\nthat the allocation was not done on purpose with a view to\npromoting somebody\u2019s interests. A priori, the\nexperimental procedure is thus more impartial with respect to the\ninterests at stake. It has thus been argued that RCTs in medicine,\nwhile no guarantor of the best outcomes, were adopted by the U.S. Food\nand Drugs Administration (FDA) to different degrees during the 1960s\nand 1970s in order to regain public trust in its decisions about\ntreatments, which it had lost due to the thalidomide and other\nscandals (Teira and Reiss 2013; Teira 2010). It is important to\nnotice, however, that randomization is at best effective with respect\nto one kind of bias, viz. selection bias. Important other epistemic\nconcerns are not addressed by the procedure but should not be ignored\n(Worrall 2002).\n",
