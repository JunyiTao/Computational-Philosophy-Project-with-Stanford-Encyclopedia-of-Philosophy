    "main_text": "Preference, Judgement and Reasons\n3. Preference, Judgement and Reasons\n\nAs well as studies designed to elicit preferences, there are\nempirically motivated theories that purport to explain them. Among the\nearliest is Wundt\u2019s (1874) suggestion that we judge a form\npleasing to the extent that the eye finds it easy to follow the\ncontour. Recent work generalises this thought: there is said to be a\ntendency for stimuli to be experienced positively when our perceptual\nor cognitive grasp on them comes easily (Reber, Schwarz, &\nWinkielman 2004). This idea of processing fluency is not\nlimited to the aesthetic domain; we generally find a proposition more\nbelievable, apparently, if it is expressed in rhyme or in an easy to\nread font and this is said to be because these things increase fluency\n(Reber & Schwarz 1999; McGlone & Tofighbakhsh 2000). So\naesthetic and fluent phenomena are not coextensive, and no reduction\nof the one to the other is possible. The most that can be said (and\nthis is not insignificant) is that certain kinds of fluency underpin\nexperiences of aesthetic pleasure and displeasure, symmetry offering a\nplausible example; for comments on the significance of such research\ninto underlying mechanisms see\n Section 4\n below.\n\nOne concern about an approach to the aesthetic by way of fluency is\nthat fluency apparently encourages a less careful examination of the\nstimulus (Song & Schwarz 2008), a suggestion at odds with the\naesthetic ideal of a finely discriminating attitude to art. Another is\nthat fluency-based likings for stimuli seem to have very limited\napplication in aesthetics beyond the domain of simple shape\npreferences. Pictures which are visually complex are often widely\nadmired and not merely by the art-world elite (see for example\nFrith\u2019s busy genre paintings). It is said that the pleasure\nderived from fluency is relative to expectation: pleasure taken in a\nBach fugue depends on it being more fluent than one expects (Reber\n2012: 228, citing Hansen, Dech\u00eane, & W\u00e4nke 2008). But\nwhy must lovers of Bach have unrealistic expectations about the\nfluency of his music? Finally (a theme we will return to) citing\nfluency would not be a reason for admiring the picture or fugue in\nquestion; this approach seems to focus on pleasure and leave notions\nof reason and judgement out of account. (For criticism of the fluency\nprogram in aesthetics see Cochrane 2021a, Section 2.3.)\n\nAnother aspect of fluency is said to be the mere exposure effect: our\ntendency to find a statement more believable if we have heard it\noften, repeated hearings leading to progressively more fluent\nprocessing (Begg, Anas, & Farinacci 1992). Cutting (2003)\ninvestigated an aesthetic variant of the idea: liking for a picture is\nincreased by repeated exposure to it. This, it is suggested, may\nexplain the stability of the artistic canon: works canonical at\nt are more available to be seen, and the mere exposure effect\nraises the likelihood of their being canonical at t + 1.\nCutting does not claim that exposure is the only factor contributing\nto aesthetic judgement, so accepting this view does not make one an\nerror theorist about aesthetic value. It does, however suggest that\nthe critical robustness of canonical judgements has been\noverestimated, since one\u2019s exposure to a picture is not a reason\nfor thinking it good. However, Meskin, Phelan, and colleagues (2013)\ncompared the effect of mere exposure to (what critics have widely\njudged to be) good and bad art, finding that there was increased\nliking for good art but decreased liking for bad art, the implication\nbeing that increased exposure makes observers more aware of the\nobjective qualities of the work (see also Delplanque et al. 2015). In\nthat case significant exposure to a work, while not a reason why it is\ngood or bad, is a reason why one\u2019s judgement of it is reliable\nand so may be said to belong to the space of aesthetic reasons.\nCutting (2017), while offering some methodological reservations,\nexpresses broad agreement with the Meskin et al. study.\n\nRecently the link between aesthetic effects and pervasive features of\nperception and cognition has been highlighted again by the theory of\npredictive processing: the idea that the fundamental activity\nof the brain is to make predictions and test and revise them against\nincoming information from the senses, the goal being the reduction in\npredictive errors or what is also called reduction in uncertainty (for\na survey of philosophical applications of this idea see Hohwy . It is\nsuggested that positive affect is the product of such reductions,\nwhile negative affect results when uncertainty is increased. Works of\nart are said to provide the brain with exercises, sometimes\nchallenging ones, in error reduction (van de Cruys & Wagemans\n2011). But why should we seek more exercises in prediction error\nreduction than the many that the world throws at us continually? What\nis to say that the eventual reduction in error outweighs the initial\nincrease posed by a work of art?\n\nWe see, then, that there are a number of suggestions for how empirical\nwork may shed light on our aesthetic preferences and their aetiology,\nwhile doubts remain about the capacity of this work to illuminate the\nnormative structure of aesthetic judgement, which is said to be\nreason-focused and involve Kantian features such as disinterestedness\n(though see Meskin, Phelan, et al. 2013: 140\u20131). A second and\nfamiliar objection is the Wittgensteinian thought that merely\nexplaining the origins of a phenomenon doesn\u2019t give us the kind\nof explanation which philosophers are concerned with (Vrahimis 2020).\nHowever, the idea of reasons in aesthetics itself deserves critical\ninterrogation, given the evidence that the reasons people give seem\noften to be confabulations and that focusing on reasons while making a\njudgement can make you a worse judge rather than a better one (see\nIrvin 2014 and Lopes 2014, mentioned above,\n Section 1).\n Nor is the problem here confined to the aesthetic domain: Hugo\nMercier and Dan Sperber (2017) argue that, quite generally, reasoning\nworks well as an instrument of public debate but poorly as a guide to\npersonal judgement and decision.\n",
