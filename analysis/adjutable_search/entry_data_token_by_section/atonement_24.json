    "main_text": "Collective Atonement\n6. Collective Atonement\n\nIn everyday speech we sometimes talk of collectives (or groups)\noffering atonement or being the recipients of atonement. For example,\npeople discuss whether Germany has sufficiently atoned for its Nazi\npast (M. Smith 2019\n [Other Internet Resources])\n and how the Canadian government has atoned for its mistreatment of\nindigenous populations (Skylstad 2021\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n and Roman Catholic popes have apologized for the role of the Church\nin the sexual abuse scandal and in harm to native people during the\nconquest of the Americas (Cunningham\n 2022).[46]\n There is considerable dispute about how to understand these\nattributions of responsibility to collectives and the moral action of\nthe collectives (see the entry on\n collective responsibility\n for details). Some take them at face value and accept a realm of\ncollective responsibility that is distinct from the individual\nresponsibility born by members of the collective (e.g., Isaacs 2011).\nOthers object that only individuals can be responsible for actions and\nthat groups can be regarded as responsible in only a metaphorical\nsense (e.g., H. D. Lewis 1948; Narveson 2002).\n\nBoth approaches have a range of important moral phenomena to explain.\nThese include: apology for a collective and how in some cases victims\nfeel that an apology from a group is more needed than an apology from\nindividual members of the group; collective responsibility for\nhistorical injustices when no currently existing member of the group\ncommitted or aided anyone in committing any of the injustices; the\nsense of guilt or shame at being a member of a collective that has\nwronged people; morally acceptable collective punishment; that\nindividuals in a guilty group can have varying degrees of\nresponsibility connected to the action for which the group is guilty.\n(See French & Wettstein 2006, 2014; Isaacs & Vernon 2011; and\nMay & Hoffman 1991 for important collections of essays on these\nand other related issues.)\n\nCollective atonement is one of these phenomena. Insofar as groups can\nbe responsible for actions or states of affairs in the world, they can\nalso be responsible for atoning for the same. Since atonement aims at\nreconciliation, collective atonement would aim at reconciling one\ngroup with another individual or group. Roy Brooks, for example,\nargues that \u201cracial reconciliation should be the primary purpose\nof racial redress\u201d (2004: 141). He thus presents what he calls\nan atonement model for black reparations, according to which\nreconciliation is the goal, which is to be achieved through government\napology and reparation. Reparations are needed not only because of the\nextent of the harm done but because they are \u201cessential to\natonement\u201d, as they \u201cmake apologies believable\u201d\n(2004: 142). Even if there are no agents literally collectively\nresponsible for anything, there are bad social facts and relations\nthat can cause and result from wrongdoing\u2014these are sometimes\ncalled social evils or social sins (John Paul II 1984). Sometimes\nadequate atonement will require making reparations for social\nevils.\n\nSome reflections on the Christian doctrine of atonement make use of\nnotions of collectivity. The version of the\n divinization/healing motif\n that highlights Christ\u2019s role as a second Adam and as the Head\nof humanity (or the Church) posits that Christ\u2019s acting as a\nrepresentative for a collective entity is part of how he atones for\nhuman sin. The Hebrew scriptures contain a clear notion of collective\nresponsibility, illustrated most clearly in the Day of Atonement\nrituals (Milgrom 1991) and this notion may influence the New Testament\nconception of Christ as a priest offering the sacrifice of himself.\nSome argue that Anselm regards, or is committed to regarding, Christ\nas atoning for collective sin (D. Brown 2004; Thurow 2017b; for a\ndifferent reading see Rogers 2012). Drawing on these sources, Thurow\n2015 develops a theory of atonement on which Christ atones primarily\nfor the collective sins of humanity and secondarily for the sins of\nindividual humans who join themselves to Christ in faith and\nrepentance.\n",
