Can there be \u2018local\u2019 quantum theories?\n\n\nThe focus of this entry has been on exploring the nature of the\nnon-local influences in the quantum realm as depicted by quantum\ntheories that violate factorizability, i.e., theories in which the\njoint probability of the distant outcomes in the EPR/B experiment do\nnot factorize into the product of the single probabilities of these\noutcomes. The motivation for this focus was that, granted plausible\nassumptions, factorizability must fail (see section 2), and its\nfailure implies some type of non-locality (see sections 2-8). But if\nany of these plausible assumptions failed, it may be possible to\naccount for the EPR/B experiment (and more generally for all other\nquantum phenomena) without postulating any non-local influences. Let\nus then consider the main arguments for the view that quantum\nphenomena need not involve non-locality.\n\n In arguments for the failure of factorizability, it is presupposed\nthat the distant measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are real\nphysical events. Recall (section 5.3.3) that in Albert and Loewer's\n(1988) many-minds interpretation this is not the case. In this\ninterpretation, definite measurement outcomes are (typically) not\nphysical events. In particular, the pointers of the measurement\napparatuses in the EPR/B experiment do not display any definite\noutcomes. Measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment exist only as\n(non-physical) mental states in observers' minds (which are\npostulated to be non-physical entities). So sacrificing some of our\nmost fundamental presuppositions about the physical reality and\nassuming a controversial mind-body dualism, the many-minds\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics does not postulate any action at a\ndistance or superluminal causation between the distant wings of the\nEPR/B experiment. Yet, as quantum-mechanical states of systems are\nassumed to reflect their physical states, the many-minds theory does\npostulate some type of non-locality, namely state non-separability and\nproperty and relational holism.\n\n Another way to get around Bell's argument for non-locality in the\nEPR/B experiment is to construct a model of this experiment that\nsatisfies factorizability but violates \u03bb-independence (i.e.,\nthe assumption that the distribution of all the possible pairs' states\nin the EPR/B experiment is independent of the measured quantities). In\nsection 2, we mentioned two possible causal explanations for the\nfailure of \u03bb-independence. The first is to postulate that\npairs' states and apparatus settings share a common cause, which\ncorrelates certain types of pairs' states with certain types of\nsettings (e.g. states of type \u03bb1 are correlated with\nsettings of type l and r, whereas states of type\n\u03bb2 are correlated with settings of type\nl\u2032 and r\u2032, etc.). As we noted, thinking\nabout all the various ways one can measure properties, this\nexplanation seems conspiratorial. Furthermore, it runs counter to one\nof the most fundamental presuppositions of empirical science, namely\nthat in experiments preparations of sources and settings of\nmeasurement apparatuses are typically independent of each other. The\nsecond possible explanation is to postulate causation from the\nmeasurement events backward to the source at the emission time. (For\nadvocates of this way out of non-locality, see Costa de Beauregard\n1977, 1979, 1985, Sutherland 1983, 1998, 2006 and Price 1984, 1994,\n1996, chapters 3, 8 and 9.) Maudlin (1994, p. 197-201) argues that\ntheories that postulate such causal mechanism are\ninconsistent. Berkovitz (2002, section 5) argues that Maudlin's line\nof reasoning is based on unwarranted premises. Yet, as we shall see in\nsection 10.3, this way out of non-locality faces some\nchallenges. Furthermore, while a violation of \u03bb-independence\nprovides a way out of Bell's theorem, it does not necessarily imply\nlocality; for the violation of \u03bb-independence is compatible\nwith the failure of factorizability. \n\n\nA third way around non-locality is to \u2018exploit\u2019 the\ninefficiency of measurement devices or (more generally) measurement\nset-ups. In any actual EPR/B experiment, many of the particle pairs\nemitted from the source fail to be detected, so that only a sample of\nthe particle pairs is observed. Assuming that the observed samples are\nnot biased, it is now generally agreed that the statistical\npredictions of orthodox quantum mechanics have been vindicated (for a\nreview of these experiments, see Redhead 1987, section 4.5). But if\nthis assumption is abandoned, there are perfectly local causal\nexplanations for the actual experimental results (Clauser and Horne\n1974, Fine 1982b, 1989a). Many believe that this way out of\nnon-locality is ad hoc, at least in light of our current\nknowledge. Moreover, this strategy would fail if the efficiency of\nmeasurement devices exceeded a certain threshold (for more details,\nsee Fine 1989a, Maudlin 1994, chapter 6, Larsson and Semitecolos 2000\nand Larsson 2002). \n\n\nFinally, there are those who question the assumption that\nfactorizability is a locality condition (Fine 1981, 1986, pp. 59-60,\n1989b, Cartwright 1989, chaps. 3 and 6, Chang and Cartwright 1993).\nAccordingly, they deny that non-factorizability implies non-locality.\nThe main thrust of this line of reasoning is that the principle of the\ncommon cause is not generally valid. Some, notably Cartwright (1989)\nand Chang and Cartwright (1993), challenge the assumption that common\ncauses always screen off the correlation between their effects, and\naccordingly they question the idea that non-factorizability implies\nnon-locality. Others, notably Fine, deny that correlations must have\ncausal explanation. \n\n\nWhile these arguments challenge the view that the quantum realm as\ndepicted by non-factorizable models for the EPR/B experiment\nmust involve non-locality, they do not show that viable\nlocal, non-factorizable models of the EPR/B experiment (i.e., viable\nmodels which do not postulate any non-locality) are possible. Indeed,\nso far none of the attempts to construct local, non-factorisable\nmodels for EPR/B experiments has been successful. \n",
