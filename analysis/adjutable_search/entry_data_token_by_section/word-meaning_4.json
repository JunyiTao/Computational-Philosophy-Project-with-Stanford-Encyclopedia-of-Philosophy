    "main_text": "Historical Background || Classical Traditions\n2.1 Classical Traditions\n\nThe prototypical example of speculative etymology is perhaps the\nCratylus (383a-d), where Plato presents his well-known\nnaturalist thesis about word meaning. According to Plato, natural kind\nterms express the essence of the objects they denote and words are\nappropriate to their referents insofar as they implicitly describe the\nproperties of their referents (see the entry on\n Plato\u2019s Cratylus).\n For example, the Greek word \u2018anthr\u00f4pos\u2019\ncan be broken down into anathr\u00f4n ha op\u00f4pe, which\ntranslates as \u201cone who reflects on what he has seen\u201d: the\nword used to denote humans reflects their being the only animal\nspecies which possesses the combination of vision and intelligence.\nFor speculative etymology, there is a natural or non-arbitrary\nrelation between words and their meaning, and the task of the theorist\nis to make this relation explicit through an analysis of the\ndescriptive, often phonoiconic mechanisms underlying the genesis of\nwords. More on speculative etymology in Malkiel (1993), Fumaroli\n(1999), and Del Bello (2007).\n\nThe primary aim of the rhetorical tradition was the study of\nfigures of speech. Some of these concern sentence-level variables such\nas the linear order of the words occurring in a sentence (e.g.,\nparallelism, climax, anastrophe); others are lexical in nature and\ndepend on using words in a way not intended by their normal or literal\nmeaning (e.g., metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche). Although originated\nfor stylistic and literary purposes, the identification of regular\npatterns in the figurative use of words initiated by the rhetorical\ntradition provided a first organized framework to investigate the\nsemantic flexibility of words, and laid the groundwork for further\ninquiry into our ability to use lexical expressions beyond the\nboundaries of their literal meaning. More on the rhetorical tradition\nin Kennedy (1994), Herrick (2004), and Toye (2013).\n\nFinally, classical lexicography and the practice of writing\ndictionaries played an important role in systematizing the descriptive\ndata on which later inquiry would rely to illuminate the relationship\nbetween words and their meaning. Putnam\u2019s (1970) claim that it\nwas the phenomenon of writing (and needing) dictionaries that gave\nrise to the idea of a semantic theory is probably an overstatement.\nBut the inception of lexicography certainly had an impact on the\ndevelopment of modern theories of word meaning. The practice of\nseparating dictionary entries via lemmatization and defining them\nthrough a combination of semantically simpler elements provided a\nstylistic and methodological paradigm for much subsequent research on\nlexical phenomena, such as decompositional theories of word meaning.\nMore on classical lexicography in B\u00e9joint (2000), Jackson\n(2002), and Hanks (2013).\n",
