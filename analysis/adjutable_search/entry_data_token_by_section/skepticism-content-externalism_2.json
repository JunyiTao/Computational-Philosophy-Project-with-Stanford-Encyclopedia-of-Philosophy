    "main_text": "The Disjunctive Argument\n3. The Disjunctive Argument\n\nVarious authors have noted that additional information is needed to\nderive Putnam\u2019s desired conclusion (\u2018I am not a brain in a\nvat\u2019). One of the earliest and most important of these\nreconstructions was suggested by Anthony Brueckner (1986). He proposed\nthat Putnam\u2019s argument could reasonably be construed as an\ninstance of disjunction elimination (\\(p \\lor q\\), \\(p \\rightarrow\nr\\), \\(q \\rightarrow r \\vdash r\\)) as follows:\n\n(B)  (1)\nEither I am a BIV (speaking vat-English) or I am\na non-BIV (speaking English). [Premise] \n  \n(2)  If\nI am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then my\nutterances of \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 are true iff I have sense\nimpressions as of being a BIV. [Premise] \n  \n(3) \nIf I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then I do not\nhave sense impressions as of being a BIV. [Premise]\n\n  \n\u2234 (4) \nIf I am a BIV (speaking vat English), then my\nutterances of \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 are false. [By (2), (3)]\n\n  \n(5)  If\nI am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my\nutterances of \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 are true iff I am a BIV.\n[Premise] \n  \n\u2234 (6) \nIf I am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my\nutterances of \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 are false. [By (5)]\n\n  \n\u2234 (7) \nMy utterances of \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 are\nfalse. [By (1), (4), (6)] \n\n\nIt is important to note, as Brueckner does, that (7) is not\nPutnam\u2019s desired conclusion (\u2018I am not a BIV\u2019), nor\ndoes it alone imply this conclusion, since (7) is consistent with the\nspeaker\u2019s being a BIV, in the English sense of\n\u2018BIV\u2019.\n\nTo reach Putnam\u2019s conclusion, Brueckner considers use of the\nfollowing disquotation principle:\n\n(T) My utterances of\n\u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 are true iff I am not a BIV.\n\n\nNote that (7) implies\n\n(8) My utterances of\n\u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 are true, \n\n\nAnd (8) together with (T) apparently yield the desired anti-skeptical\nconclusion: I am not a BIV.\n\nBut Brueckner persuasively argues (1986: 164\u2013165) that using the\ndisquotational principle (T) in this context is illegitimate. In\neffect, (T) as used in this context is ambiguous (see Folina\n2016: 159). Depending on whether the speaker is or is not a BIV, (T)\nwill provide different truth conditions for the speaker\u2019s\nutterances of \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019. If the speaker is not a\nBIV and thus is speaking English in uttering (T), then the truth\ncondition for \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 is just the condition that\nthe speaker is not a BIV. But if the speaker is a BIV, then the truth\ncondition expressed by \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 is the condition\nthat the speaker is not a BIV*, where \u2018BIV*\u2019 has the\nvat-English meaning of \u2018BIV\u2019, whatever it is (perhaps one\nof the three meanings that Putnam suggests). Note that on this\ninterpretation, the argument\u2019s conclusion (that the speaker is\nnot a BIV*) is simply irrelevant, since Putnam\u2019s\ndesired conclusion is \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 in its\nEnglish sense.\n\nOn the other hand, if the speaker is assumed to be speaking English in\nusing (T), then (T) together with (8) does imply the desired\nanti-skeptical result \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 in its English\nsense. But, as Brueckner puts it in some later articles (1992, 2016),\nthis use of (T) just begs the question, since for the conclusion\n(\u2018I am not a BIV\u2019) to be true in English, the speaker must\nbe speaking English in uttering the premise (T), and so must be a\nnon-BIV, which is of course the conclusion to be shown. As Brueckner\nsays, the argument \n\n\n\u2026 is epistemically circular in William Alston\u2019s\nsense: knowledge of one of its premises\u2014(T)\u2014requires\nknowledge of its conclusion [Alston 1989]. (Brueckner 2016: 4)\n\n\nAnother way to see that the argument based on the English sense of (T)\nwould be question-begging is to ask whether a speaker would have\nwarrant to believe (T) in its English sense, if the speaker did not\nalready have warrant to believe that she was a non-BIV\nspeaking English. Note that if the speaker were a BIV speaking\nvat-English, the speaker would not even understand (T) in its\nEnglish sense, let alone have warrant to believe it in that sense. So\nit surely seems that the speaker could not have warrant to believe (T)\nin its English sense unless she already had warrant to\nbelieve the argument\u2019s conclusion, that is, had warrant to\nbelieve \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019 in its English sense. (See\nBrueckner 1986: 164\u2013165 and 2016: 4. The type of\nquestion-begging just described, as well as the type described by\nAlston (1986 [1989]) would seem to be the same as the type identified\nby Crispin Wright and that he describes as failure of warrant to\ntransmit from premise to conclusion. See Wright 1985: 436; 2000:\n141\u2013143; see also Davies 2000: 397\u2013399.)\n\nThe proper conclusion to draw from Brueckner\u2019s seminal\ndiscussion would thus seem to be that either the argument (B) plus (T)\nhas an irrelevant conclusion (if the speaker is assumed to be a BIV\nspeaking vat-English), or the argument begs the question (if the\nspeaker is assumed to be a non-BIV speaking English).\n\nIn later work Brueckner 1992 and 2003 seems to raise a problem for the\nquestion-begging charge, when he points out that one can know that a\ngiven disquotational principle expresses a truth whether one is a\nnon-BIV speaker of English or a BIV speaker of vat-English. We will\ndiscuss this issue below in section 6.\n",
