    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Metaethics || The Senses\n1.1 The Senses\n\nIn the Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions,\nHutcheson defines his sentimentalism in the following terms: \n\n\n\u201cObjects, Actions, or Events obtain the Name of Good,\nor Evil, according as they are Causes, or Occasions,\nmediately, or immediately, of a grateful, or ungrateful\nPerception to some sensitive Nature\u201d. To understand\ntherefore the several Kinds of Good, or Evil, we\nmust apprehend the several Senses natural to us.\n(Essay, 15) \n\n\nThis passage reveals a number of features of Hutcheson\u2019s\nsentimentalism. First, he admits of a wide variety of what might be\ncalled evaluative modes: there are several kinds of good or\nevil, according to Hutcheson, which arise given the \u201cgrateful or\nungrateful\u201d perceptions in people, or other \u201csensitive\nNatures\u201d. These evaluative modes will correspond to the various\nsenses that are apt to receive such perceptions.\n\nBut what, for Hutcheson, is a \u201csense\u201d? (For a very\nthorough introduction, see Schmitter 2016.) In the Essay, he\ndefines this notion as follows: \n\n\nevery Determination of our Minds to receive Ideas independently on\nour Will, and to have Perceptions of Pleasure and Pain.\n(Essay, 17) \n\n\nNow, this account of the nature of senses permits of a fairly broad\nrange\u2014any \u201cdetermination\u201d of our mind to receive\nideas involuntarily is to be understood as a sense. And, indeed,\nHutcheson takes this breadth seriously. He recognizes not just the\n\u201cfive senses\u201d\u2014which he dubs \u201cexternal\u201d\nsenses (Inquiry, I.X; Essay I.1)\u2014but a broad\nrange of \u201cinternal\u201d senses. Hutcheson writes: \n\n\nIn Musick we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct\nSense from the External one of Hearing, and call it a good Ear; and\nthe like distinction we should probably acknowledge in other Objects,\nhad we also got distinct Names to denote these Powers of Perception\nby. (Inquiry, I.X) \n\n\nFor Hutcheson, the ideas, and pleasures, received via the\n\u201cgood ear\u201d\u2014as opposed to the simple external sense\nof hearing\u2014are the products of an internal sense.\n\nIndeed, in Hutcheson\u2019s psychology, we get a very wide array of\ninternal \u201csenses\u201d. While this is not an exhaustive list,\nhe lists or at least suggests senses of:\n\n\n Imagination (Essay, 17) or \u201cBeauty and\nHarmony\u201d (Inquiry, 23) (\u201cthe Pleasant\nPerceptions arising from regular, harmonious, uniform\nObjects; as also from Grandeur and Novelty\u201d;\nEssay, 17).\n the \u201cPublick Sense\u201d (\u201cour Determination to be\npleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at\ntheir Misery\u201d; Essay, 17).\n The Moral Sense (\u201cby which we perceive Virtue, or\nVice in our selves, or others\u201d; Essay,\n17).\n The \u201cSense of Honour\u201d (\u201cwhich makes the\nApprobation or Gratitude of others, for any good\nActions we have done, the necessary occasion of Pleasure; and their\nDislike, Condemnation, or Resentment of\nInjuries done by us, the occasion of that uneasy Sensation called\nShame, even when we fear no further evil from them\u201d;\nEssay, 18).\n The sense of \u201cdecency or dignity\u201d (by which we take\npleasure in actions or activities that are specifically adapted to\nhuman nature; System, 27\u201330; Essay, 18).\n\n\n\nIn Hutcheson\u2019s psychology there is a key difference between the\nexternal and internal senses. According to Hutcheson, the external\nsenses have the power to perceive simple ideas\u2014notes,\ncolors, sounds, tastes, etc. (Inquiry, 23). But the\ninternal senses are those, according to Hutcheson, that arise\n\u201conly upon some previous Idea, or Assemblage,\nor Comparison of Ideas\u201d (Essay, 15\u201316).\nThe internal senses, then, will proliferate under Hutcheson\u2019s\ngeneral account\u2014any capacity to generate pleasure or pain\ninvoluntarily given the comparison of ideas will, on Hutcheson\u2019s\nview, be a sense. And hence it should not at all be surprising that\nHutcheson gives the diverse accounting of senses that he does.\n\nHowever, despite there being a difference, in Hutcheson, between the\nexternal and internal senses concerning their operation on simple or\ncomplex ideas, they are nevertheless justly grouped together\nas senses:\n\n\nSince then there are such different Powers of Perception, where what\nare commonly called the External Senses are the same; since the most\naccurate Knowledge of what the External Senses discover, often does\nnot give the Pleasure of Beauty or Harmony, which yet one of a good\nTaste will enjoy at once without much Knowledge; we may justly use\nanother Name of these higher, and more delightful Perceptions of\nBeauty and Harmony, and call the power of receiving such Impressions,\nan Internal Sense\u2026This superior Power of Perception is justly\ncalled a Sense, because of its Affinity to other Senses in this, that\nthe Pleasure does not arise from any Knowledge of Principles,\nProportions, Causes or of the Usefulness of the Object; but strikes us\nat first with the Idea of Beauty: nor does the most accurate Knowledge\nincrease this Pleasure of Beauty, however it may super-add a distinct\nrational Pleasure from prospects of Advantage, or from the Increase of\nKnowledge. (Inquiry, 24\u201325)\n\n\nHere Hutcheson appears to be defending his use of the term\n\u201csense\u201d to describe the internal senses as well as the\nexternal. According to Hutcheson, the fundamental similarity is the\ngeneration of pleasures and ideas immediately, without\nintervening cognitive work\u2014the sense of taste \u201cstrikes us\nat first with the Idea of Beauty\u201d, along with its accompanying\npleasure.\n",
