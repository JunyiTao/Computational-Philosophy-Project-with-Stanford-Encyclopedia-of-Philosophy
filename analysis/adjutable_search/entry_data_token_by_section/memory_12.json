On the one hand, we sometimes remember but\ndo so in a way that is in some sense inadequate; in such cases, we\nnaturally say that we are \u201conly\nimagining\u201d. The question\ncan thus be taken to concern the distinction between cases in which\nthe subject remembers successfully and cases in which he remembers\nunsuccessfully. On the other hand, we sometimes think about\nthe past in a way that does not amount to remembering at all; in such\ncases, too, we naturally say that we are\n\u201conly imagining\u201d.\nA criterion of mnemicity must therefore distinguish both between\nsuccessful and unsuccessful remembering and and between remembering,\nwhether successful or unsuccessful, and mere imagining.\n4.1.1 Unsuccessful remembering\n\nDistinguishing between successful and unsuccessful remembering\nrequires identifying the difference between cases in which the memory\nprocess results in a genuine memory and cases in which it instead\nresults a memory error such as confabulation (Hirstein 2009).\nThe question of how to distinguish successful remembering from\nunsuccessful remembering resulting in memory errors is central to the\ntheories of remembering discussed below, but philosophers have also\nbegun to investigate memory errors in their own right. Some have\nconsidered the relationship between mnemonic confabulation and other\nforms of confabulation (Bortolotti & Cox 2009; Hirstein 2005).\nOthers have asked whether confabulation and other memory errors might\nnot, counterintuitively, have beneficial effects. Fern\u00e1ndez\n(2015b), for example, has argued that even wholly confabulated\nmemories may sometimes have adaptive benefits (but see Otgaar, Howe,\nClark, Wang, & Merckelbach 2015), while Michaelian (2013) has\nargued that the misinformation effect, in which inaccurate information\nconcerning an experienced event is incorporated into the\nsubject\u2019s memory of the event (Loftus 1996), can, under certain\ncircumstances, have epistemic benefits (but see Shanton (2011)). And\nothers have attempted to understand the relationships among memory\nerrors of different types. Robins (2016a, a), for example, has\nexplored the relationships among successful remembering,\nconfabulating, and misremembering, characterizing remembering\nas involving both an accurate representation of an event and retention\nof information from experience of the event, confabulating as\ninvolving an inaccurate representation and no retention of\ninformation, and misremembering as involving an inaccurate\nrepresentation and retention of information. Robins\u2019\naccount is discussed in more detail below.\n4.1.2 Mere imagining\n\nDistinguishing between remembering and mere imagining requires\nidentifying one or more memory markers, where a memory marker\nis a factor that discriminates between remembering, whether successful\nor unsuccessful, and mere imagining. The concept of a memory marker is\nitself importantly ambiguous. On the one hand, memory markers might be\nunderstood as factors that the rememberer himself can employ, from the\nfirst-person perspective, to discriminate between remembering\nand imagining. On the other hand, they might be understood as factors\nto which the theorist of memory can appeal, from a\nthird-person perspective, to discriminate between remembering\nand imagining.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no guarantee of any\ncorrespondence between first-person and third-person memory markers.\nMany factors which might plausibly be held to shape the\nrememberer\u2019s subjective judgements about whether he is\nremembering or merely imagining\u2014such as the vividness of an\napparent memory\u2014are such that they do not track the objective\nboundary between memory and imagination. And many factors which might\nplausibly be held to track that boundary\u2014such as the existence\nof a causal connection between an apparent memory of an event and the\nsubject\u2019s original experience of\nit\u2014are such that they are\ninaccessible to the rememberer and therefore ineligible to serve as\nfirst-person markers. Criticisms of proposed memory markers that\ndisregard the distinction between first-person and third-person\nmarkers may miss their target. Bernecker (2008), for example, objects\nto the source monitoring framework in psychology (Johnson (1997); see\nbelow), along with similar earlier approaches in philosophy (Smith\n2013), on the ground that the markers identified by the framework\ndiscriminate between memory and imagination only imperfectly. If these\napproaches are understood as pertaining to third-person markers, then\nBernecker\u2019s criticism is telling. If, however, they are\nunderstood as pertaining to first-person markers, then it is not:\nsince subjects\u2019 judgements about whether they are remembering or\nimagining are sometimes mistaken, an account of first-person memory\nmarkers should not identify markers that discriminate perfectly\nbetween memory and imagination.\n\nFirst-person memory markers play a vital role in enabling rememberers\nto cope with two problems posed by the interaction between memory and\nimagination. The source problem, arises\nbecause subjects remember not only information deriving from\nexperience but also information deriving from a variety of other\nsources, including imagination. For example, one might imagine an\nevent and later remember the imagined event. Hence, when one\nremembers, one is faced with the problem of determining whether the\ninformation that one remembers derives from experience or, rather,\nfrom another source. Subjects appear to cope with this problem by\nrelying on a form of metamemory known as \u201csource\nmonitoring\u201d (Johnson 1997), in which they employ a variety of\ncontent-based markers to determine whether or not they are remembering\non the basis of experience. For example, memories deriving from\nexperience tend to be more detailed and to include no information\nabout the cognitive operations that produced them, whereas memories\nderiving from imagination tend to be less detailed and to include\ninformation about the cognitive operations that produced them.\n\nThe process problem, in contrast, arises because subjects\nengage not only in episodic remembering but also in episodic future\nthinking and episodic counterfactual thinking and because (as we will\nsee) these forms of episodic imagining closely resemble remembering.\nFor example, one might imagine a future event or a counterfactual\nevent by drawing on information deriving from similar past events.\nHence, when one engages in episodic thought, one is faced with the\nproblem of determining whether one is remembering a past event or\nimagining a future or counterfactual event. Subjects may cope with\nthis problem by relying on a form of metamemory which might be called\n\u201cprocess monitoring\u201d; whereas source\nmonitoring relies primarily on content-based markers, process\nmonitoring may rely additionally on phenomenological markers, such as\nthe feelings of familiarity and pastness discussed above, and formal\nmarkers, such as the subject\u2019s intention to remember or imagine\n(Hoerl 2014; Urmson 1967).\n4.2 Theories of remembering\n\nA full theory of remembering will thus include an account of\nfirst-person memory markers, but the theories of remembering described\nhere are concerned primarily with third-person markers. These theories\ncan be positioned with respect to two general\u2014and arguably\nincompatible\u2014conceptions of memory. The conceptions in question\nhave been described in a number of different ways. Koriat and\nGoldsmith (1996), oppose storehouse conceptions to\ncorrespondence conceptions, while Robins (2016a) opposes\narchival conceptions to constructive conceptions.\nBorrowing some terminology from \n  epistemology, \nthe conceptions in\nquestion can also be described as preservationist and\ngenerationist. Preservationism takes remembering to be\nessentially a matter of encoding, storing, and retrieving information.\nIn philosophy, preservationism is reflected in\ncomparisons\u2014beginning with Plato\u2019s wax tablet\nmetaphor\u2014of memory to a variety of information storage\ntechnologies (Depper 2016; Draaisma 2000). In psychology, it is\nmanifested in Ebbinghaus\u2019s ([1885] 1913) foundational\nexperimental work on memory for lists of nonsense syllables.\nEbbinghaus\u2019s legacy is carried on in a productive research\ntradition, but the accent in contemporary psychology is on generative\nconceptions of memory. Generationism takes remembering to be an active\nprocess in which the subject constructs a more or less adequate\nrepresentation of the past. In psychology, generationism is manifested\nin Bartlett\u2019s ([1932] 1995; Wagoner 2017) pioneering work on the\nways in which memories are created and recreated by the remembering\nsubject. In philosophy, many researchers continue to operate with a\npreservative conception of memory, but, beginning with a growing\ninterest in false and recovered memories (S. Campbell 2003, 2014;\nHacking 1995; Hamilton 1998), generationism has become increasingly\ninfluential.\n\nSufficiently moderate versions of preservationism and generationism\nmay not be incompatible. In order to account for deviations from\nperfect storage, preservationists may acknowledge the active,\nconstructive character of remembering. And, since stored information\nprovides the raw materials out of which the subject constructs\nrepresentations of the past, generationists need not deny that\nremembering involves storage of information. Less moderate versions of\npreservationism and generationism, however, may be incompatible. Some\npreservationists deny that genuine remembering is consistent with the\ninclusion in the retrieved memory representation of content that goes\nbeyond the content that was included in the subject\u2019s original\nexperience of the event (e.g., Bernecker (2010)). Some generationists,\nmeanwhile, grant that remembering involves the preservation of\ninformation originating in experience but deny that genuine\nremembering requires the inclusion in the retrieved memory\nrepresentation of any content that was included in the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience of the event (e.g., Michaelian 2016c). It is\ndifficult to see how these more extreme preservationist and\ngenerationist conceptions might be reconciled with each other.\n\nThe preservationist conception is reflected in the empiricist\ntheory, which was influential in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury and is thus the natural starting point for a review of\ntheories of remembering. The most influential theories in the second\nhalf of the twentieth century were the epistemic theory and\nthe causal theory, which likewise reflect the preservationist\nconception, with the causal theory gradually eclipsing the epistemic\ntheory. In the early years of the twenty-first century, the causal\ntheory has been challenged by new simulation theories, which\nadopt a thoroughly generationist conception of memory. The remainder\nof this section reviews each of these theories in turn.\n4.2.1 The empiricist theory\n\nEmpiricists see both memory and imagination as drawing on preserved\nsense impressions. Identifying a marker for the distinction between\nmemory and mere imagination is therefore central to the empiricist\ntheory of remembering, and Hume ([1739] 2011) suggested two such\nmarkers. First, he suggested that memory and imagination may be\ndistinguished by the latter\u2019s higher degree of flexibility:\nmemory respects the order and form of the subject\u2019s original\nimpressions, whereas imagination does not. This suggestion appears to\nbe unworkable. Hume himself acknowledged that degree of flexibility\ncannot be employed as a first-person memory marker, since the subject\nhas no means of comparing a current apparent memory to an earlier\nsense impression. And degree of flexibility fares no better as a\nthird-person memory marker, unless a very extreme form of\npreservationism is assumed. Generationists, who conceive of\nremembering as an active, constructive process, are bound to reject a\nview of memory on which it is characterized by inflexibility. Moderate\npreservationists likewise acknowledge that remembering is often highly\nflexible; for example, they may acknowledge that one can remember the\nelements of an event in an order other than that in which one\nexperienced them (Bernecker 2008).\n\nSecond, Hume suggested that memory and imagination may be\ndistinguished by the former\u2019s higher degree of\nvivacity. As Pears (1990) points out, Hume\u2019s\nnotion of vivacity is ambiguous. It sometimes seems to refer to a\nproperty of the representation produced by the apparent memory\nprocess; the idea here would be that representations produced\nby remembering are more detailed than representations\nproduced by imagining. But it sometimes seems to refer\nto a property of the apparent memory process itself; the idea here\nwould be that remembering imposes itself on the subject in a more\nspontaneous manner than does imagining. On either interpretation,\nvivacity may have merit as a first-person memory marker, but it is\nunworkable as a third-person marker. The representations produced by\nremembering may be more detailed on average than the representations\nproduced by imagining, but only on average: imagination sometimes\nproduces representations containing a great deal of detail, and memory\nsometimes produces representations containing very little detail.\nSimilarly, the process of remembering may on average occur\nspontaneously more often than the process of imagining, but only on\naverage: we sometimes remember deliberately, and we\nsometimes\u2014as in the familiar phenomenon\nof mind-wandering (Dorsch 2015)\u2014imagine\nspontaneously.\n\nDue to these and other problems\u2014see Holland (1954) for a\ndetailed discussion of the empiricist theory, versions of which he\nattributes to Russell (1921) and Broad (1925), in addition to\nHume\u2014the empiricist theory has few contemporary defenders. One\nexception is Byrne (2010), who endorses a neoempiricist\ntheory which sees the content of memory and the content of imagination\nas degraded and transformed versions of the content of perception. The\nneoempiricist theory distinguishes between memory and imagination by\nclaiming that memory necessarily preserves cognitive contact with the\noriginal event, whereas imagination may involve cognitive contact but\ndoes not preserve it. Both aspects of this claim are problematic. The\nclaim that memory necessarily preserves cognitive contact may be\nundermined by the generative character of remembering, at least if an\nextreme form of generationism is assumed. And the claim that\nimagination does not preserve cognitive contact is difficult to\nreconcile with the fact that imagining draws on stored information.\nLike the classical empiricist theory, moreover, the neoempiricist\ntheory fails to deal with both aspects of mnemicity, focusing\nexclusively on the distinction between remembering and mere imagining\nand saying little about the distinction between successful and\nunsuccessful remembering. It may therefore not have a significant\nadvantage over the classical empiricist theory.\n4.2.2 The epistemic theory\n\nEpistemic theorists (e.g., Ayer 1956; Annis 1980; A. Holland 1974; D.\nLocke 1971; Munsat 1967; Naylor 1971; Ryle [1949] 2009; Zemach 1968)\nsee remembering something as being a matter of having known it\ncontinuously since once first learned\n it.[1]\n The epistemic theory of remembering may capture important features of\nour ordinary use of the verb\n\u201cto remember\u201d (Moon 2013),\nand it has found a number of contemporary advocates (e.g., T.\nWilliamson 2000; Adams 2011; Audi 2002), but it also faces a number of\nserious problems. One problem is that, because the epistemic theory is\ncouched in terms of propositional knowledge, it applies to episodic\nremembering only if we take episodic representations to be\npropositional in character. Even if the theory is entertained as a\ntheory of semantic remembering, moreover, it remains problematic.\nSemantic memory may correspond roughly to propositional memory, but\nthis correspondence is only rough: on most accounts, semantic memory\nincludes nonpropositional representations of various kinds. Thus the\ntheory applies at best to a subset of semantic memories.\n\nAnother problem is that, since knowledge requires truth,\njustification, and belief, the epistemic theorist must claim that\nmemory requires truth, justification, and belief, and each of these\nclaims has been persuasively challenged. As we will see in\nsection 6, there appear to be cases of memory without\ntruth. There are likewise arguably cases of belief without justification\n(Audi 1995; Bernecker 2011). Lackey (2005), for example, describes a\ncase in which, after initially forming a belief, the subject acquires\ndefeaters which undermine his justification for it. And there are arguably\ncases of memory without belief. Martin and Deutscher (1966) illustrate one\nkind of nonbelieved memory by means of the hypothetical case of a painter\nwho paints a scene that he takes to be imaginary but that turns out to\ncorrespond exactly to a scene that he witnessed as a child;\nintuitively, this is an instance of remembering without believing.\nSince the subject lacks the phenomenology characteristic of\nremembering, the epistemic theorist might in principle deny that this\nparticular case is an instance of remembering. But, in the kind of\nnonbelieved memory studied by psychologists (Otgaar, Scoboria,\n& Mazzoni 2014), the subject fails to form a belief\ncorresponding to his memory despite having the phenomenology\ncharacteristic of remembering; the existence of nonbelieved memories of\nthis kind is well-established.\n\nA further problem is that the theory appears either to collapse into\nthe causal theory or to make remembering into something quite\nmysterious. As Deutscher (1989) points out, there would seem to be no\nplausible story about what it is to retain knowledge that does not\nappeal to the sort of causal connection posited by the causal theory.\nThus, if the epistemic theorist explicates retention of knowledge in\nterms of causal connection, then his theory collapses into the causal\ntheory, and, if the epistemic theorist refuses to explicate retention\nof knowledge in terms of causal connection, then his theory fails to\nprovide any real insight into the nature of remembering.\n4.2.3 The causal theory\n\nCausal theorists see remembering as being characterized by the\nexistence of an appropriate causal connection between an apparent\nmemory and the subject\u2019s original experience of the remembered\nevent. The idea that a causal connection is essential to remembering\nwas unpopular when Martin and Deutscher published their influential\n(1966) paper, but, despite early opposition (e.g., Squires 1969; Shope\n1973; Zemach 1983), it has now largely eclipsed the epistemic theory.\nBernecker\u2014who cites von Leyden (1961), Goldman (1967), Shoemaker\n(1970), Anscombe (1981), and Armstrong (1987) as predecessors, in\naddition to Martin and Deutscher\u2014has recently developed and\ndefended it at length (Bernecker 2008, 2010). Not all contemporary\nphilosophers of memory explicitly endorse the causal theory, and some\nsuggest amendments or additions to it, but there are few who\nexplicitly reject the theory (Debus 2017). The idea that remembering\nis characterized by an appropriate causal connection has thus taken on\nthe status of philosophical common sense.\n\nThe core of the causal theory is the claim that an appropriate causal\nconnection between the subject\u2019s apparent memory and his\noriginal experience is both necessary and, along with relatively\nuncontroversial additional conditions, sufficient for remembering.\nThere are two aspects to this claim. First, the claim that remembering\nrequires a causal connection already classifies certain cases\nof apparent memory as merely apparent. For example, Martin and\nDeutscher describe a case in which a subject experiences an event,\nforgets it entirely, and later is coincidentally implanted with a\n\u201cmemory\u201d exactly\nmatching his original experience. The requirement of a causal\nconnection rules this case out as a case of\ngenuine memory. Second, the claim that remembering requires an\nappropriate causal connection classifies certain further\ncases of apparent memory as merely apparent. Martin and Deutscher\ndescribe a case in which a subject experiences an event, describes it\nto someone, forgets it entirely, is told about it by the person to\nwhom he described it, forgets being told, and then seems to remember\nthe event on the basis of what he was told. Here, there is a causal\nconnection, but intuitively it is of the wrong sort to sustain\nremembering. Martin and Deutscher\u2019s suggestion\nis that what is missing is a memory trace: simplifying somewhat,\nthe idea is that the subject\u2019s experience must\ngive rise to a stored representation which exists continuously in the\ninterval between experiencing and remembering and which contributes to\nthe production of the retrieved representation. The requirement of an\nappropriate causal connection, where an appropriate causal connection is\none that goes continuously via a memory trace in this manner, rules this\ncase out as a case of genuine memory.\n\nWhile the causal theory has been and continues to be enormously\ninfluential, both the necessity and the sufficiency of the appropriate\ncausation condition have been questioned. Challenges to the\nsufficiency of the condition have been more popular. One such\nchallenge appeals to the epistemic relevance of memory. Debus\n(2010) argues that genuine memories are necessarily epistemically\nrelevant to the remembering subject, in the sense that he is disposed\nto take them into account when forming judgements about the past. In\nthe most straightforward case, the subject remembers a given event and\ntherefore forms a belief that the event occurred. In less\nstraightforward cases, the subject may refrain from forming a belief\nthat the event occurred but nonetheless be disposed to do so. Because\nit does not treat epistemic relevance as necessary for remembering,\nDebus argues, the causal theory is bound to classify certain cases as\ninstances of genuine memory when in fact they are instances of merely\napparent memory. For example, in the case of the painter described\nabove, the painter disregards his apparent memory when forming\njudgements about the past, and therefore it should not be classified\nas a genuine memory; but the apparent memory is, we may assume,\nappropriately caused by the painter\u2019s past experience, and\ntherefore the causal theory is bound to classify it as a genuine\nmemory. Given that epistemic relevance is necessary for genuine\nmemory, this argument suggests that the appropriate causation\ncondition must be supplemented with a condition explicitly requiring\nepistemic relevance. The view that epistemic relevance is necessary\nfor genuine memory, however, may conflate mnemicity and episodicity:\none natural take on the case of the painter is that the painter is\nremembering but, because he lacks autonoetic consciousness, not\nremembering episodically.\n\nAnother challenge appeals to the nature of memory traces. Traces are\ndiscussed in more detail below, but two main conceptions of traces are\navailable in the literature, with some theorists understanding traces\nas local, individually stored entities with explicit content,\nwhile others understand them as distributed,\nsuperpositionally stored entities with implicit content. The local\nconception, adopted by Martin and Deutscher (1966), is more\nstraightforward, but the distributed conception, inspired by\nconnectionist approaches to memory\n(McClelland & Rumelhart 1986)\nand developed in detail by Sutton (1998), has gradually become the\ndominant view (Robins 2017). If the distributed conception is right,\nthen individual experiences do not, strictly speaking, result in\nenduring individual traces but, instead, modify connection weights in\nnetworks of event features. Robins (2016b) has argued that, for this\nreason, a causal theory relying on distributed representations lacks\nany means of singling an individual event out as the one that is\nremembered. This would be an unfortunate implication, but the\ndistributed conception may be able to avoid it. On standard\ndistributed connectionist approaches (O\u2019Brien 1991),\ntransient activation patterns are discrete explicit representations, even\nthough they are generated from information stored only holistically in\nconnection weights: thus at retrieval, there can be a distinct\nrepresentation of an individual remembered event.\n\nAlternatively, the causal theorist might retreat to a local conception\nof traces, but doing so might not enable him to avoid this difficulty.\nAny causal theorist who acknowledges the constructive character of\nremembering must acknowledge that, when one remembers, while some of\nthe content of the retrieved representation presumably originates in\none\u2019s experience of the remembered event, the\nremainder may originate in one\u2019s experience of\nother events. This implies that one may satisfy the appropriate causation\ncondition with respect not only to the remembered event but also with\nrespect to the other events in question. Given that one does not remember\nthe other events, satisfaction of the appropriate causation condition cannot\nbe sufficient for remembering. Overall, it is unclear whether the\nappropriate causation condition is sufficient for remembering,\nregardless of whether a distributed conception or a local conception\nof traces is adopted.\n\nIf the appropriate causation condition merely fails to be sufficient\nfor remembering, an adequate theory of remembering might in principle\nbe produced by supplementing it with additional conditions, producing\na variant of the classical causal theory. If the condition fails to be\nnecessary, however, the causal theory will have to be rejected\noutright, and, while challenges to the sufficiency of the condition\nhave been more popular, the necessity of the condition has also been\nchallenged. Such challenges are motivated by a tension between the\ncausal theory and the constructive character of remembering. The\nclassical version of the causal theory treats the content of a\nretrieved memory representation as deriving entirely from the\nsubject\u2019s original experience of the remembered event. Causal\ntheorists do not require that the content of a retrieved\nrepresentation exactly match that of the corresponding experience. In\nparticular, they do not require that the retrieved representation\ninherit all of the content of the experience. But most do\nrequire that the retrieved representation not incorporate content\nnot included in the original experience. Research on\nconstructive memory, however, demonstrates that the content\nof the retrieved representation routinely differs from that of the\nexperience not only in that it does not include some information that\nthe latter does include but also in that it does include some\ninformation that the latter does not include. For example, in cases of\nboundary extension, the subject sees part of a scene but remembers\nportions of it that were beyond his field of view (Hubbard, Hutchison,\n& Courtney 2010). In general, remembering is not a reproductive\nbut a reconstructive process, in which components of previous\nexperiences are extracted and recombined in a flexible manner, often\nresulting in representations that include content not included in the\ncorresponding experiences (Schacter & Addis 2007).\n\nThe constructive character of remembering poses a problem for the\nsufficiency of the appropriate causation condition, as we have seen,\nbut it also poses a problem for its necessity. In an attempt to render\nthe causal theory compatible with the findings of constructive memory\nresearch, Michaelian (2011a) suggests modifying it so that it permits\nthe content of the retrieved representation to go beyond that of the\noriginal experience, as long as two conditions are met: first, the\ncontent of the retrieved representation must not go \u201ctoo\nfar\u201d beyond that of the experience; second, the memory\nsystem must function reliably when it generates the new content. The first of\nthese conditions is problematically vague. Moreover, there appears to\nbe no way of drawing a meaningful boundary between cases in which the\ncontent of the representation does not go too far beyond that of the\nexperience and cases in which it does. In some cases, a majority of\nthe content may derive from the experience. In some cases, only a\nminority of the content may derive from the experience. As long as\npart of the content was included in the experience, the causal\ntheorist can in principle classify the representation as a genuine\nmemory. In some cases, however, none of the content at all may derive\nfrom the experience. Once the fraction of the content that was\nincluded in the experience drops to zero, the causal theorist is bound\nto classify the representation as a merely apparent memory. Given the\nreconstructive character of remembering, however, such cases are bound\nto occur, and it is not clear why the mere preservation of some\ncontent, no matter how little, should make a qualitative difference\nbetween genuine and merely apparent memory.\n\nThe second condition is likewise problematic. James (forthcoming)\nargues that the introduction of a reliability condition tacitly turns\nthe causal theory into a causal-epistemic theory. The thought here is\nthat the only apparent motivation for imposing the condition is the\nintuition that memory is a source of knowledge. This is unpersuasive,\nas there is a clear difference, independent of any epistemological\nconsiderations, between reliable and unreliable memory processes.\nConfabulation, in particular, may be characterized by its\nunreliability (Hirstein 2005). James also argues, however, that, once\na suitable epistemic condition\u2014such as the reliability\ncondition\u2014is added to the causal theory, the causal condition\nitself becomes redundant. The thought here is that, if the reliability\ncondition is satisfied, then it should not matter whether the causal\ncondition is also satisfied. This is more persuasive, especially in\nconjunction with the claim that there is no way of drawing a\nmeaningful boundary between cases in which the content does not go too\nfar beyond that of the experience and cases in which it does. Overall,\nthen, the modified version of the causal theory appears to be an\nunstable halfway-point between the classical causal theory and a\ntheory which rejects the causal condition outright, replacing it with\na reliability condition. The simulation theory can, at least in some\nversions, be understood as such a theory.\n4.2.4 The simulation theory\n\nThe idea that remembering the past is linked to imagining the future\nmay go back as far as Augustine (Manning, Cassel, &\nCassel 2013), but it has until recently played little role in the philosophy\nof memory. It has, however, come to play an important role in the\npsychology of memory, as psychologists have moved away from a\nconception of episodic memory as what-where-when memory and towards a\nconception of episodic remembering as a form of constructive mental\ntime travel. Reinforced by impressive brain imaging evidence and\nextensive research on representational and phenomenological overlap\nbetween remembering the past and imagining the future (Klein 2013;\nSchacter et al. 2012; Szpunar 2010), this new conception emphasizes\nthe similarities between episodic memory, episodic future\nthought (in which the subject imagines possible future events),\nand, increasingly, processes such as episodic counterfactual\nthought (in which the subject imagines alternatives to past\nevents). Taking the new conception to its logical conclusion, many\nhave suggested that, rather than distinct capacities for episodic\nmemory and episodic imagination, humans in fact have a single general\ncapacity for mental time travel (Suddendorf &\nCorballis 2007). In psychology, this new conception has led to theoretical\nframeworks such as the constructive episodic simulation approach\n(Schacter, Addis, & Buckner 2008) and the scene\nconstruction approach (Mullally & Maguire 2014), both\nof which emphasize the simulational character of remembering. In philosophy,\nit has led to simulation theories of remembering (Shanton &\nGoldman 2010), which see remembering as a process of imagining past events,\na process in which a causal connection to the remembered event is at best\nincidental.\n\nBuilding on work on episodic future thought, Michaelian (2016c) treats\nepisodic memory and episodic future thought as processes carried out\nby a common episodic construction system. Both processes draw on\nstored information originating in experience of past\nevents\u2014that is, on memory\ntraces\u2014in order to construct representations of\nevents. Episodic future thought obviously cannot draw on traces\noriginating in experience of represented events, simply because the\nrelevant events have not yet occurred. Similarly, episodic memory does\nnot necessarily draw on traces originating in experience of\nrepresented events: in some cases, it may do so, but the episodic\nconstruction system, because it is supports both episodic memory and\nepisodic future thought, is not designed in such a manner that it\nalways does so. Michaelian\u2019s version of the\nsimulation theory, then, implies that an appropriate causal connection\nis not a prerequisite for remembering. Building work on episodic counterfactual\nthought, De Brigard (2014a) treats episodic memory as one function of\na system devoted to the construction of possible past\nevents\u2014not only events that actually occurred but\nalso events that might have occurred but did not. De\nBrigard\u2019s version of the simulation\ntheory, too, would seem to imply that episodic memory may in some\ncases draw on traces originating in experience of represented events\nbut that it does not always do so.\n\nIf the simulation theory is right, both of the aspects of mnemicity\nidentified above may require rethinking. Regarding the first aspect,\nRobins (2016a) has argued that, whereas the causal theory can appeal\nto the existence of an appropriate causal connection in order to\ndistinguish among successful remembering, confabulating, and\nmisremembering, the simulation theory may not be able to accommodate\nthese distinctions, since it views both successful and unsuccessful\nremembering as resulting from the same imaginative process. The\nsimulation theory can, however, appeal to the reliability of the\nimaginative process in question, characterizing successful remembering\nas involving reliable imagination resulting in an accurate\nrepresentation of the event, confabulation as involving unreliable\nimagination resulting in an inaccurate representation, and\nmisremembering as involving reliable imagination resulting in an\ninaccurate representation (Michaelian 2016b). This approach to memory\nerrors has the advantage of making room for veridical\nconfabulation, which can be characterized as involving unreliable\nimagination resulting in an accurate representation,\n\nRegarding the second aspect of mnemicity, the simulation theory\nimplies that the difference between memory and imagination is much\nless dramatic than the traditional view takes it to be. Hopkins\n(forthcoming) has described memory as imagination controlled by the\npast. If the simulation theory is right, memory is indeed imagination,\nbut it need not be controlled by the past. One may merely imagine a\npast event by imagining a counterfactual past event. But if one\nimagines an actual past event, and if one\u2019s\nimagination is reliable, then one is simply remembering it. There is, if the\nsimulation theory is right, no difference in kind between cases in\nwhich one reliably imagines an actual past event at least in part on\nthe basis of one\u2019s experience of the event and cases\nin which one reliably imagines an actual past event on another basis; in cases\nof both sorts, as long as one\u2019s representation of the\nevent is accurate, one has a genuine memory of the event.\n\nPhilosophers committed to the traditional view of the difference\nbetween memory and imagination are likely to object not only to this\nimplication of the simulation theory but also to the idea of mental\ntime travel itself. Research on mental time travel, as we have seen,\nsuggests that there is no qualitative difference between episodic\nmemory and episodic future thought. Adopting Perrin\u2019s (2016)\nterminology, continuists argue explicitly that any difference\nbetween them is merely quantitative, while discontinuists\ngrant that there are quantitative similarities between episodic memory\nand episodic future thought but maintain that there are a variety of\nqualitative differences between them. Discontinuism is the traditional\nview. Debus (2014), for example, has drawn on relationalist accounts\nof the objects of episodic memory (J. Campbell 2001; Debus 2008; see\nsection 5 below) to argue that, when one remembers\na past event, the remembered event itself may, due to\none\u2019s previous causal contact with it,\nconstitute part of the content of one\u2019s mental state,\nwhereas, when one imagines a future event, the imagined event cannot constitute\npart of the content of one\u2019s mental state, because one\nhas had no causal contact with it. Perrin (2016), meanwhile, has argued that,\nwhen one imagines a future event, one effectively stipulates the\nidentity of the subject whose experience one is imagining, so that\nepisodic future thought is immune to error through misidentification,\nwhereas, when one remembers a past event, the identity of the subject\nis determined by one\u2019s causal relationship to\none\u2019s past experience, so that episodic memory\nis not immune to error through misidentification. Others have argued\nthat episodic memory is itself immune to error through misidentification\n(Hamilton 2009, 2013), but a more serious problem for these discontinuist\narguments is that they presuppose the causal theory of memory: since the\ncausal theory itself presupposes that there is a qualitative difference\nbetween remembering and imagining, the arguments appear to beg the question\nagainst the continuist view of mental time travel (Michaelian 2016a).\n\nIn addition to challenging the traditional view that there is a\nqualitative metaphysical difference between memory and imagination,\nthe simulation theory challenges the view that there is a qualitative\nepistemological difference between them. Philosophers have tended to\nbe dismiss the possibility of episodic knowledge of future events,\nthat is, of knowledge produced by imagining the future, as opposed to\nthe sort of semantic knowledge produced by prediction (Kneale 1971;\nSwinburne 1966). The simulation theory, however, suggests that our\nepisodic knowledge of future events may be on a par with our episodic\nknowledge of past events. This view is surprising, but it chimes with\nrecent work on imagination as a source of knowledge (Balcerak Jackson\nforthcoming; Kind forthcoming).\n5. Representation\n\nDespite the disagreements among partisans of the theories of\nremembering discussed in section 4,\nthey are, for the most part, in agreement on the point that\nremembering involves representations of past events. The role of\nrepresentations in remembering, however, raises a number of difficult\nquestions of its own. One such question concerns the implications of\nmental content externalism\nfor memory content in particular.[2]\nExternalism, which has become the dominant view of the nature of\nmental content, holds that the content of a subject\u2019s mental\nrepresentations depends not only on his own internal states but also\non his relationships to things in his external environment. For\nexample, what one thinks when one thinks the thought that one would\nexpress by saying \u201cwater is wet\u201d\nis determined in part by the chemical composition of the substance that fills the\nlakes and rivers and falls from the sky in the environment in which one learned\nto use the word \u201cwater\u201d, namely,\nH2O; had one learned to use the word\n\u201cwater\u201d in an environment in which\nsomething other than H2O fills the lakes and rivers and\nfalls from the sky, then one\u2019s thought would have been that\nthat other substance is wet, not that H2O is wet (Putnam 1975).\nThis much is common ground among externalists. But a subject might\nmove from one environment to another, and externalists disagree about\nthe contents of memories formed before such moves and retrieved after\nthem. Pastist externalists (e.g., Boghossian 1989; Burge\n1998) maintain that the past environment alone is relevant.\nPresentist externalists (e.g., Ludlow 1995; Tye 1998)\nmaintain that the past and the present environments are both relevant.\nAnd futurist externalists (e.g., Stoneham 2003; Jackman 2005)\nmaintain that the past, the present, and any future environments are\nall relevant. Since the arguments for and against these views have had\nlittle contact with mainstream philosophy of memory, they will not be\nreviewed here; for further discussion, see Bernecker (2010).\n\nTwo further questions concerning the role of representations in\nremembering have been at the heart of mainstream philosophy of memory.\nThese questions are sometimes run together, but they raise distinct\nissues. The first, concerning retrieved representations, is the\nquestion of the nature of the objects of memory. The second,\nconcerning stored representations, is the question of the existence\nand role of memory traces.\n5.1 The objects of memory\n\nThe direct objects of memory are those to which the subject is\nrelated, in the first instance, when he\nremembers.[3]\nHistorically, there have been two main competing views on the nature\nof the objects of memory: direct realism and\nindirect (or representative) realism.\n5.1.1 Direct realism\n\nDirect realism (defended by Reid ([1764] 1997) and, more recently, by\nLaird (1920)) claims that, when one remembers, one is in the first\ninstance related to past events themselves; it is thus perhaps the\nmost intuitively appealing view of the nature of the objects of\nmemory. The primary motivations for direct realism about the objects\nof memory parallel the motivations for direct realism about the\nobjects of perception. One motivation is the thought that positing\nrepresentations that stand as intermediaries between the remembering\nsubject and the remembered object may have sceptical implications for\nour ability to know the past. Another motivation is the thought that\nremembering is phenomenologically direct, that is, that, in\nremembering, we attend to past events, not to internal representations\nof past events. The work on metamemory discussed in\nsection 4 suggests that remembering may in fact\noften be phenomenologically indirect rather than phenomenologically\ndirect. But there are more serious problems for direct realism, and\nit is these that provide the primary motivation for indirect realism.\n5.1.2 Indirect realism\n\nIndirect realism (defended by J. Locke ([1689] 1998), Hume ([1739]\n2011), and, more recently, B. Russell (1921)) claims that, when one\nremembers, one is in the first instance related to internal\nrepresentations of past events. Here, again, the dialectic parallels\nthat of the debate between direct and indirect realists about the\nobjects of perception. In the domain of perception,\nthe argument from\nhallucination takes the possibility of the occurrence of hallucinations\nindistinguishable from successful perceptions to suggest that\nhallucination and successful perception have something in common,\nnamely, an internal representation of a scene, and that it is to this\nthat the subject is related in the first instance in both cases. In\nthe domain of memory, the argument from memory\nhallucination\u2014or,\nas it would more aptly be called, the argument from\nconfabulation\u2014appeals to the possibility of\nthe occurrence of confabulations indistinguishable from successful\nmemories to suggest that confabulation and successful memory have in\ncommon an internal representation of a past event and that it is to\nthis that the subject is related in the first instance in both cases.\nDenying that representations are the direct objects of the relevant\nmental states, moreover, leads to disjunctivism, according to which\nperception or memory, on the one hand, and hallucination or\nconfabulation, on the other hand, are states of fundamentally\ndifferent kinds. Some have been prepared to defend disjunctivism about\nmemory (Debus 2008), but the cognitive processes at work in memory and\nconfabulation are highly similar, making disjunctive an unattractive\noption from any broadly naturalistic standpoint.\n5.1.3 Compromise and hybrid views\n\nDirect realism nevertheless retains its intuitive appeal, and some\nhave therefore advocated a compromise between it and indirect realism.\nBernecker (2008), for example, argues for the compatibility of the\ncausal theory of memory\u2014most versions of which\ntreat memory as involving representations\u2014and\ndirect realism about the objects of memory on the ground that\nremembering a past event may require having a suitable representation\nof the event without requiring that one be aware of the representation.\nA compromise view of this sort may provide a response to the argument\nfrom confabulation, since it acknowledges a role for representations\nin both successful memory and confabulation. But it does not by\nitself provide a response to a distinct problem, the\ncotemporality problem. The cotemporality problem arises\nbecause, while direct realism claims that the direct object of a\npresent memory is a past event, there is no obvious sense in which a\nsubject now might be directly related to a past event. Bernecker\n(2008) argues that the cotemporality problem can be avoided if we\nassume that past events continue to exist even after they have\noccurred. This may, however, be a high metaphysical price to\npay simply in order to respect direct realist intuitions.\n\nEven if concerns about the metaphysical price of\nBernecker\u2019s view are set aside,\nthere remain concerns about whether the view achieves a genuine\ncompromise between direct and indirect realism.\nSince the view acknowledges that representations play an indispensable\nrole in remembering, it remains, at bottom, representationalist in\ncharacter. The recent philosophy of perception literature, however,\nsuggests the possibility of a view of the objects of memory which\nincorporates elements of both representationalism and relationalism.\nIn that literature, the focus is on the character of perceptual\nexperience, with relationalists arguing that what determines a\nsubject\u2019s perceptual experience is an external\nscene, while representationalists argue that what determines it is an\ninternal representation. This focus on perceptual experience opens up the\npossibility of hybrid views, according to which perceptual experience\nis partly determined by external scenes and partly determined by\ninternal representations (e.g., Schellenberg 2014). At present, the\nprospects for hybrid views of memory remain unexplored.\n5.2 Memory traces\n\nIn addition to retrieved representations, most theories see\nremembering as involving stored traces. Both the existence\nand the precise role of traces have, however, been matters of\ncontroversy.\n5.2.1 The existence of traces\n\nOpposition to including references to traces in a philosophical theory\nof remembering often stems from particular conceptions of the nature\nof philosophical, as opposed to scientific, theories. Thus some have\nargued that philosophical theories of remembering should not posit\ntraces on the ground that philosophical theories are or should be\nconcerned with the nature of remembering as such, or perhaps with the\nconcept of memory, whereas traces pertain to the mechanisms that, as a\nmatter of contingent fact, underwrite the process of remembering (D.\nLocke 1971). One response to this argument maintains that the nature\nof remembering cannot be understood without understanding the\nmechanisms that underwrite the process of remembering (Sutton 1998).\nAnother response maintains, more strongly, that traces may be part of\nthe very concept of remembering (De Brigard 2014b; C.B.\nMartin & Deutscher 1966).\n\nOthers have argued that philosophical theories of remembering should\nnot posit memory traces on the ground that philosophical theories\nought not to dictate to scientific theories and that traces belong to\nthe province of the latter (Zemach 1983). One response to this\nargument advocates a retreat to a purely logical conception of memory\ntraces, devoid of any empirical detail (Heil 1978; D.A. Rosen 1975).\nAnother response advocates the development of a conception of traces\nbased on current scientific theories of remembering (Sutton 1998).\nThis response, in turn, motivates the distributed conception of traces\nintroduced in section 4. As we have seen, the\ndistributed conception is not without its disadvantages; in particular,\nit may have troubling implications for the causal theory. But it has\nadvantages as well; in particular, it may ground a response to\nWittgensteinian (1980; see also Malcolm [1963] 1975)\nantirepresentationalist arguments, which often presuppose a local\nconception of traces (Sutton 2015).\n5.2.2 The role of traces\n\nAssuming that the existence of traces is granted, a full account of\nremembering will have to describe the relationship between traces, the\nrepresentations produced by retrieval, and the representations\ninvolved in perceptual experience.\n\nDe Brigard (2014b) reviews several positions that have historically\nbeen defended regarding the relationship between traces and perceptual\nrepresentations. Semidirect representationalism holds that\nperception is indirect and that traces are the same as the\nrepresentations involved in perception. Indirect\nrepresentationalism holds that perception is indirect and that\ntraces are distinct from the representations involved in perception.\nAs De Brigard emphasizes, what ultimately matters here is\nrelationships among contents rather than vehicles. He thus\ndistinguishes between content invariantism, which holds that\nthe content of the trace is the same as that of the perceptual\nrepresentation, and content variantism, which holds that the\ncontent of the trace may differ from that of the perceptual\nrepresentation. In practice, since the invariantist/variantist\ndistinction cuts across the semidirect/indirect distinction, which\nconcerns relationships among vehicles rather than contents, semidirect\nand indirect representationalism can often be grouped together.\nDirect representationalism holds that perception is direct\nand that traces are created after perception occurs. Extending De\nBrigard\u2019s nomenclature, direct relationalism\nwould hold that perception is direct and that remembering does not involve\ntraces.\n\nDe Brigard\u2019s approach does not explicitly take the\nrelationship between traces and retrieved representations into account, and\ntaking this relationship into account expands the range of possible\npositions. As before, perception might be held either to be direct or\nto be indirect. If perception is direct, storage might be held either\nnot to involve traces or to involve traces. If storage does not\ninvolve traces, retrieval might be held to be either direct or\nindirect. The former possibility corresponds to a straightforward\nversion of direct relationalism. The latter possibility, on which\nneither perception nor storage involves representations but on which\nretrieval does involve representations, would be difficult to\nmotivate, as it is difficult to see from where the content of\nretrieved representations might come if it is not supplied by memory\ntraces. If storage does involve traces, retrieval might, again, be\nheld to be either direct or indirect. The former possibility, on which\nneither perception nor retrieval involves representations but on which\nstorage does involve representations, would be difficult to motivate,\nas it is difficult to see what role traces might play given that they\ndo not contribute to retrieval. The latter possibility is the natural\nway of understanding direct representationalism.\n\nIf perception is indirect, storage might be held either not to involve\ntraces or to involve traces. If storage does not involve traces,\nretrieval might be held to be either direct or indirect. The former\npossibility, on which perception involves representations but neither\nstorage nor retrieval involves representations, would be difficult to\nmotivate, as the considerations that motivate relationalism about\nmemory likewise motivate relationalism about perception. The latter\npossibility, on which perception and retrieval involve representations\nbut storage does not, corresponds roughly to a view advocated by\nVosgerau (2010); on this view, storage may in a sense involve traces,\nbut stored traces, due to their inactive character, cannot be said to\nhave content. If storage does involve traces, retrieval might be held\nto be either direct or indirect. The former possibility, on which\nperception and storage involve representations but retrieval does not,\nwould be difficult to motivate, as, again, the considerations that\nmotivate relationalism about memory likewise motivate relationalism\nabout perception. The latter possibility is the natural way of\nunderstanding both semidirect representationalism and indirect\nrepresentationalism.\n\nTaking the relationship between traces and retrieved representations\ninto account also complicates the distinction between content\ninvariantism and content variantism. De Brigard applies the\ndistinction to the relationship between the contents of perceptual\nrepresentations and the contents of traces. It may also be applied to\nthe relationship between the contents of traces and the contents of\nretrieved representations. But what ultimately matters here is the\nrelationship between the contents of perceptual representations and\nthe contents of retrieved representations. One is a content\ninvariantist with respect to this relationship if one holds that the\ncontent of the retrieved representation is the same as the content of\nthe perceptual representation, and one is a content variantist if one\nholds that the content of the retrieved representation may differ from\nthe content of the perceptual representation. Any view on which both\nperception and retrieval involve\nrepresentations\u2014including semidirect\nrepresentationalism, indirect representationalism, and something like\nVosgerau\u2019s view\u2014may be\ncombined with either content invariantism or content variantism.\n\nPhilosophers have often treated remembering as a basically\npreservative process, but this should not be taken to suggest that\ncontent invariantism is the standard view in philosophy. While there\nhave been attempts to identify purely preservative forms of memory\n(Dokic 2001), most philosophical theories of remembering allow for two\nkinds of variance between the content of retrieved representations and\nthe content of perceptual representations. First, all theories allow\nfor the subtraction of content through forgetting. Second, many\ntheories allow for the addition of self-reflexive, second-order\ncontent of the sort described in section 3. Thus\ncontent variantism is in fact the standard view. Note, however,\nthat the standard form of content variantism permits the addition of\nsecond-order content concerning the subject\u2019s\nrelationship to the remembered event but forbids the addition of\nfirst-order content concerning the event itself. Most theories of\nremembering thus remain preservationist in spirit. Another possible\nform of content variantism permits the addition of both second-order\ncontent and first-order content. Generationist theories of remembering\nentail this more radical form of content variantism.\n6. Accuracy\n\nGenerationist forms of content variantism raise the question of\naccuracy in memory in an especially vivid way: if the content of the\nretrieved representation can differ from that of the trace, which can\nin turn differ from that of the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014or if,\nas the simulation theory claims, there need be no trace linking the\nretrieved representation and the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014there\nwould seem to be no guarantee that memory provides us with accurate\nrepresentations of past events. Generationist forms of content\nvariantism do not, however, guarantee inaccuracy, and preservationist\nforms of content variantism do not guarantee accuracy, for the\naccuracy of memory has two distinct dimensions.\n6.1 Truth and authenticity\n\nAdopting Bernecker\u2019s (2010) terminology,\nauthenticity refers to the correspondence between the\nmemory representation and the subject\u2019s\nexperience of the past event, while truth\nrefers to the correspondence between the memory representation and the\npast event itself. Crucially, neither sort of accuracy entails the\nother. A retrieved representation may be authentic, but, if the\nsubject misperceived the relevant event, it may nevertheless not be\ntrue. A retrieved representation may be true, but, if the subject\nmisperceived the relevant event, or if he accurately perceived an\naspect of it other than what is given to him by the retrieved\nrepresentation, it may nevertheless not be authentic.\n\nThus, while preservative forms of content variantism imply that\ngenuine memories are always authentic, such memories are not always\ntrue. Authenticity implies truth only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience itself was accurate with respect to the\nexperienced event. Cases of misperception, again, illustrate the\npossibility of authenticity without truth. Preservationists who wish\nto hold that genuine memories are always true must therefore impose\nthis as an additional requirement, above and beyond what is required\nby the core of their theory. By the same token, while generative forms\nof content variantism allow that genuine memories are sometimes\ninauthentic, such memories are not always false. Inauthenticity\nimplies falsity only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience was both accurate and complete. Cases of boundary\nextension (discussed above) or field-observer perspective switching\n(Debus 2007b; McCarroll 2017; Sutton 2010b) illustrate the possibility of\ninauthenticity without falsity. In cases of perspective switching, the\nsubject perceives an event from one perspective (field perspective)\nbut remembers it from another, perhaps even seeing himself in the\nscene (observer perspective); while many or most observer memories are\ninauthentic (since they fail to correspond to the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience), they are not necessarily false (since they may\ncorrespond to what an observer would have seen). For these reasons,\ngenerationists do not hold that genuine memories are always authentic.\nBut those who wish to hold that genuine memories are always true can\nimpose this as an additional requirement\n6.2 Factivity\n\nTo impose this additional requirement is to claim that memory is\nfactive, in the sense that genuine memories are necessarily\ntrue, that is, that apparent memories that are not true are\nmerely apparent. In philosophy, the view that memory is\nfactive has been common. The standard arguments for the factivity of\nmemory are linguistic, appealing to the apparent incoherence of\nasserting both that one remembers an event and that the event did not\noccur (Bernecker 2017; cf.\nMoore\u2019s paradox).\n Assessing these arguments is beyond the scope of this entry, but note\nthat they are controversial even among those who give linguistic\narguments a great deal of weight (De Brigard 2017; Hazlett 2010).\nAmong naturalists, who often give linguistic arguments less weight,\nthey are more controversial still. From a naturalistic point of view,\nthe goal of a theory of remembering ought to be to describe the\nprocess of remembering itself, regardless of whether we are\nintuitively inclined to classify its results as genuine or merely\napparent memories. If the same process may be responsible both for\nproducing true memories and for producing false memories, then an\nadequate theory of remembering will not require that genuine memories\nare always true\u2014in the terms introduced in\nsection 2, the relevant natural kind may include both\ntrue and false memories, regardless of whether our ordinary linguistic\npractice permits us to group them together.\n\nIn psychology, the view that memory is factive has been much less\ncommon. This is not very surprising, given that much psychological\nresearch on remembering focuses on unsuccessful remembering:\nunderstanding how unsuccessful remembering occurs provides important\ninsights into the mechanisms responsible for successful remembering,\njust as understanding how perceptual illusions and hallucinations\noccur provides important insights into the mechanisms response for\nsuccessful perception. What is more surprising is that psychologists\nhave sometimes gone too far in the opposite direction, assuming that,\nbecause remembering is constructive, it is bound to be false (Ost\n& Costall 2002). This is in effect to treat memory as\ncounterfactive. The distinction between authenticity and\ntruth enables us to see that constructive, generative remembering need\nnot be characterized by falsity. The generative character of\nremembering does, however, point to the need for a more sophisticated\ncriterion of truth (S. Campbell 2014). While the fact that remembering\nis generative does not imply that memories are bound to be outright\nfalse, it does suggest that they are frequently false in some\nrespects. This, in turn, suggests that remembering need not be fully\naccurate in order to be fully adequate, thus pointing towards a need\nfor a criterion that acknowledges that truth in memory comes in\ndegrees.\n7. The Self\n\nThe question of truth in memory derives much of its importance from\nthe role played by memory in relation to the self. It is something of\na clich\u00e9 to observe that memory makes us who\nwe are, but memory is indeed intimately linked to the self.\n7.1 Personal identity\n\nLocke ([1689] 1998)\u2014who was perhaps anticipated in this by\nSpinoza (Lin 2005)\u2014discussed the idea that what makes a person\nat a given time count as the same person as a person at an earlier\ntime is that he remembers the earlier person\u2019s experiences. This\nmemory theory of personal identity\n has been much discussed since Locke (Mathews, Bok, & Rabins\n2009), and there are well-known substantive and methodological\nproblems for it. The primary substantive problem is that the memory\ncriterion for personal identity appears to be uninformative, because\none can by definition remember only one\u2019s own experiences, not\nthose of anyone else\u2014if memory thus presupposes personal\nidentity, it is unenlightening to say that personal identity\npresupposes memory. There have been attempts to meet this objection by\nintroducing the notion of quasi-memory, which is meant to be\nlike the notion of memory without the implication of personal identity\n(Buford 2009; Parfit 1984; Roache 2006; Shoemaker 1970). While the\nnotion of quasi-memory may enable us to disentangle memory from\npersonal identity, it remains to be seen whether it is empirically\ndefensible (Northoff 2000).\n\nThe primary methodological problem is that arguments for and against\nthe memory criterion tend to rely on thought experiments involving\nmemory swapping and other such cases. Moving away from these far-out\ncases, some philosophers have preferred to consider the implications\nof real memory disorders. Craver (2012; cf. Craver, Kwan, Steindam,\n& Rosenbaum 2014), for example, has argued on\nthe basis of cases of episodic amnesia such as that of the well known\npatient KC (Rosenbaum et al. 2005) that memory is not a presupposition of\nselfhood. Others have preferred to build on cognitive psychological\ntheories of autobiographical memory. Schechtman (1994, 2011), for\nexample, has argued that memory does not and need not provide simple\nconnections between discrete past and present moments of\nconsciousness, maintaining that what matters, as far as the sense of\npersonal identity is concerned, is the way in which autobiographical\nmemory summarizes, constructs, interprets, and condenses distinct\nmoments from the personal past to produce a coherent overall narrative\n(cf. Goldie 2012). Approaches such as Schechtman\u2019s appear to\ninvolve a change of subject, from personal identity as such\nto the subject\u2019s sense of personal identity. This shift\nis explicit in Klein and Nichols\u2019 (2012) examination of the role\nof autonoesis in underwriting the sense of personal identity\u2014the\nsense that one now is the same person as someone at an earlier time.\nRoache (2016) has questioned Klein and Nichols\u2019 interpretation\nof the clinical case on which their argument depends, and the debate\nover the relationship between autonoesis and the sense of personal\nidentity is ongoing (Fern\u00e1ndez forthcoming; Klein 2016b).\n7.2 Autobiographical memory\n\nSuch approaches also appear to involve a second change of subject,\nfrom episodic memory to autobiographical memory. The\nextent to which this actually constitutes a change of subject is\ndebatable, for the relationship between episodic and autobiographical\nmemory is itself a matter of debate. Some philosophers have held that\nall episodic memories are autobiographical (Hoerl 1999). In\ndevelopmental psychology, however, episodic memory, understood as a\ncapacity to remember particular events, is often treated as emerging\nbefore autobiographical memory, which requires a capacity to organize\nindividual events into coherent narratives. Thus, autobiographical\nmemory is usually understood as including more than episodic memory.\nConway and Pleydell-Pearce\u2019s (2000; cf. Conway 2005)\ninfluential view, for example, sees autobiographical memory as emerging from what\nthey refer to as the self-memory system, including an\nautobiographical knowledge base containing information about specific\nevents, general events, and broader life periods. Accounts of\npersonal semantic memory go further, describing a form of\nmemory for one\u2019s past that is distinct from both episodic and\nsemantic memory (Renoult, Davidson, Palombo, Moscovitch, & Levine\n2012). Views emphasizing narrativity are also influential\n(Hutto 2017); rather than seeing autobiographical memory in terms of\nstored information, Brockmeier (2015), for example, sees\nautobiographical remembering as a process in which autobiographical\nmemories themselves emerge through the subject\u2019s active\nconstruction of a life narrative. Interestingly, Cosentino (2011) has\nargued that the linguistic capacity at work in the construction of\nlife narratives itself depends on the capacity for mental time travel,\nincluding episodic memory.\n7.2.1 Rilkean memory\n\nThere is thus a need for work devoted to clarifying the concept of\nautobiographical memory. In addition to clarifying the relationship\nbetween autobiographical memory and episodic memory, such work might\nalso take more exotic forms of autobiographical memory into account.\nRowlands (2015, 2016), for example, has recently introduced the\nconcept of Rilkean memory. Rilkean memory, as Rowlands\ndefines it, is a type of autobiographical memory that is neither\nepisodic nor semantic. Episodic and semantic memories have content,\nbut Rowlands maintains that these are sometimes transformed into\nsomething else which, while lacking content, is nevertheless\nrecognizable as a form of autobiographical memory. These Rilkean\nmemories can be either embodied or affective. Embodied Rilkean\nmemories manifest themselves in the form of bodily and behavioural\ndispositions, such as when a runner adopts a certain posture due to\npast injuries. Affective Rilkean memories manifest themselves when one\nhas certain feelings or moods in response to certain stimuli due to\ncertain past experiences, without being able to bring any information\nabout those experiences to mind.\n7.2.2 Memory and emotion\n\nThough Rilkean memory clearly bears some relationship to recognized\nforms of memory, it is, as Rowlands himself acknowledges, not entirely\nclear whether it ultimately merits the name\n\u201cmemory\u201d. The\nconcept of Rilkean memory does, however, foreground the role of\naffect, including emotion, in autobiographical remembering. The\nrelationship between memory and emotion is complex and multifaceted\n(see de Sousa 2017), but two issues in particular stand out. First, we\nroutinely experience emotions when we remember. These emotions may be\nunderstood as themselves being memories, namely, memories of past\nemotions, or they may be understood as being present emotions directed\nat past events. Debus (2007a) argues for the latter possibility, but,\neven if she is right, we do presumably sometimes have memories of past\nemotions. This, in turn, raises the question of whether remembered\nemotions are themselves emotions, as well as the question of how we\nare to understand present emotions directed at remembered past\nemotions.\n\nSecond, certain emotions, such as nostalgia, are necessarily\npast-directed. Such intrinsically past-directed emotions raise\ninteresting questions. Howard (2012), for example, argues that\nnostalgia can arise in connection with memories that are known to the\nrememberer to be nonveridical. This implies that a version of\nthe paradox of fiction\u2014the\nchallenge of explaining how an audience can feel something in\nrelation to an event they know to be fictional\u2014arises for\nmemory. It also raises the question of whether nostalgia felt in\nconnection with memories that are known to the rememberer to be\nnonveridical is necessarily inappropriate or whether it can under some\ncircumstances be appropriate.\n8. Beyond Individual Memory\n\nWhile most research on the metaphysics of memory has assumed that\nremembering is something done by individuals on their own, this\nassumption has recently been challenged, as researchers have drawn on\naccounts of cognition as distributed or extended to interrogate the\nrole of external memory and on ideas from the burgeoning\ninterdisciplinary field of memory studies to investigate the\npossibility of more or less robustly collective forms of\nmemory.\n8.1 External memory\n\nA distinction is sometimes drawn between distributed and\nextended accounts of cognition, with the former referring to\na line of research in cognitive science that focuses on cognition in\ncomplex sociotechnical systems consisting of multiple human and\ntechnological components (Hutchins 1995) and the latter to a current\nin philosophy of mind that focuses on cognition in systems centred on\nhuman subjects augmented by technological or sometimes social\nresources (Clark & Chalmers 1998). Accounts of\nboth sorts are committed to the rejection of traditional\n\u201cintracranialist\u201d\nviews of cognition and their replacement with the\n\u201cextracranialist\u201d\nview that cognition sometimes exceeds the bounds of the individual brain,\nand the difference between them may thus be merely one of emphasis, as\ndistributed cognition theorists emphasize remembering in sociotechnical\nsystems, while extended cognition theorists emphasize remembering in\ntechnologically-augmented individuals. Thus Hutchins (1995) considers\nhow a cockpit\u2014or rather the system consisting of the pilots of\nan airliner plus various instruments\u2014remembers its speeds, while\nClark and Chalmers focus on the case of Otto, a (hypothetical)\nAlzheimer\u2019s patient who relies on a notebook to supplement his\nunreliable memory. While both accounts are in agreement on the point\nthat external resources may count as memory stores only in the context\nof larger systems, both confront us with the role of various forms of\nexternal memory in human remembering.\n8.1.1 The concept of external memory\n\nOne question about external memory concerns the concept of external\nmemory itself. Clark and Chalmers\u2019 argument appeals to apparent\nfunctional analogies between Otto\u2019s notebook and internal memory\nin non-memory-impaired individuals, suggesting that, in virtue of\nthese analogies, appropriate external resources may, when certain\nconditions are met, qualify as literal external memory stores.\nOpposition to their argument has thus been driven by a variety of\napparent functional disanalogies between internal and external memory\n(Adams & Aizawa 2008; Rupert 2009). External\nmemory, which tends to be designed to provide highly stable storage,\ndoes not, for example, duplicate the constructive character of\ninternal memory. One response to these disanalogies is to retreat to a\nmore moderate alternative to extended cognition, such as embedded\n(Rupert 2009), scaffolded (Arango-Mu\u00f1oz 2013; Sterelny 2010),\nor situated (Sutton 2009) cognition, on which external resources may\nplay a vital role in remembering without themselves literally taking\npart in the memory process. Another response is to move away from\nparity-based arguments for extended cognition of the sort\noffered by Clark and Chalmers to the complementarity-based\narguments advanced by Clark in subsequent work (e.g., Clark 2003).\nWhile the former appeal to functional analogies between internal and\nexternal memory, the latter appeal to functional disanalogies,\nsuggesting that external memory comes to play a role in remembering\nprecisely because it does not mimic internal memory (Sutton 2010a).\nGiven the constructive character of internal memory, for example,\nstable forms of external memory may make a distinct and valuable\ncontribution to remembering.\n8.1.2 Cognitive consequences of new forms of external memory\n\nAnother question concerns the cognitive consequences of our growing\nreliance on novel forms of external memory. Regardless of whether\nexternal memory literally takes part in the memory process, our\nreliance on such forms of external memory, particularly when they are\ninternet-connected, may have important cognitive consequences (Smart\n2012). Some have worried that these are purely negative, with external\nmemory diminishing internal memory in one way or another (e.g., Carr\n2010), but whether this in fact occurs is an empirical question. There\nis some research suggesting that, when we know that information will\nbe available online, we tend to remember how to find that information,\nrather than remembering the information itself (Sparrow, Liu,\n& Wegner 2011). The consequences of our use of\nweb-connected forms of external memory have, however, only begun to be\nstudied, and it may be instructive here to recall that Plato already\nvoiced the worry that an older external memory technology, namely,\nwriting itself, would have a negative impact on our ability to remember,\na worry that most today would dismiss without a second thought.\n8.2 Collective memory\n\nIn addition to the growing literature on the ways in which\ntechnological resources contribute to remembering, there is a large\nand dynamic literature on the ways in which groups remember together.\nOr rather there are two distinct literatures here, one concerning\nsmall-scale groups, the other concerning large-scale\ngroups. The former has been investigated primarily in psychology,\nexemplified by studies of remembering in married couples (Harris,\nBarnier, Sutton, & Keil 2014) or in mother-child dyads\n(Reese, Haden, & Fivush 1993). The latter has been\ninvestigated primarily in the social sciences and history, where, in what\nhas been termed a \u201cmemory boom\u201d\n(Blight 2009), an enormous amount of work on\nhow nations and similar entities remember their pasts has appeared in\nrecent years. One question of philosophical interest in this general\narea is the relationship between memory in small-scale groups and\nmemory in large-scale groups. There is increasing interaction between\nthe two literatures (Bietti & Sutton 2015; Fagin,\nYamashiro, & Hirst 2013; Roediger\n& Abel 2015), and it may turn out that\nsimilar processes of remembering unfold in both small-scale and\nlarge-scale groups. But small-scale and large-scale collective memory,\nas we will see, do appear to raise somewhat different issues, and it\nmay turn out not to be a contingent matter that they have for the most\npart been studied in different disciplines.\n8.2.1 Memory in small-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in small-scale groups is\nperhaps whether such groups manifest emergent, robustly\ncollective forms of memory. A range of views on this question are\navailable (Barnier, Sutton, Harris, & Wilson 2008;\nWilson 2005), but the conservative view is certainly that, while remembering\nmay be affected by the social context in which it occurs, it is itself always\na strictly individual-level process. The conservative view is the\nnatural starting point, but there is a surprisingly good case to be\nmade for the radical view that remembering is sometimes a group-level\nprocess. A promising place to look for robustly collective forms of\nmemory is in transactive memory systems (Wegner 1987):\nstable, ongoing groups characterized by a division of responsibility\nfor remembering and a shared metacognitive awareness of that division\n(Kirchhoff 2016; Theiner, Allen, & Goldstone 2010;\nTollefsen, Dale, & Paxton 2013). Drawing on\nWimsatt\u2019s (1986) notion of\nemergence, for example, Theiner (2013) has provided a rigorous\nargument for the view that transactive memory systems manifest a form\nof emergent memory, in the sense that the group has a memory capacity\nof its own, over and above those of its individual members. Drawing on\na somewhat different theoretical framework, Huebner (2013, 2016) has\ndeveloped a complementary approach. Thus, while the question remains\nopen, the conservative view may no longer be the obvious starting\npoint.\n8.2.2 Memory in large-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in large-scale groups is\nwhether such groups are capable of remembering in anything like the\nsense in which individuals are capable of remembering. Applying\nconcepts developed in the domain of individual memory to the domain of\nsmall-scale collective memory may already be problematic; applying\nthem to the domain of large-scale collective memory may be more\nproblematic still. Anastasio et al. (2012), for example, have argued\nthat the concept of consolidation (referring to the process\nthrough which unstable, short-term memory representations are\ntransformed into stable, long-term memory representations) applies\nboth at the level of individuals and at the level of societies, but\nthis argument may overlook the disanalogies between internal and\nexternal memory noted above. Similarly, Tanesini (forthcoming) has\nargued that the concept of amnesia (referring to the\ninability of an agent to retrieve memories that would normally be\nretrievable) applies both at the level of individuals and at the level\nof societies, but there is little evidence that patterns of\nremembering and forgetting at the social level correspond particularly\nclosely to patterns at the individual level. Along the same general\nlines, Szpunar and Szpunar (2016; cf. Merck, Topcu, &\nHirst (2016)) have argued that the concept of episodic future\nthought (introduced above) applies both at the level of\nindividuals and at the level of societies, but it is unclear whether\nsocieties are able to imagine their futures in ways analogous to those\nin which individuals imagine their futures.\n\nGeneral concepts and theories developed in other areas of social\nontology have the potential to shed further light on collective\nmemory. For example, the literature on\ncollective intentionality\n(Tollefsen 2006), may clarify the activity of joint reminiscing, which\nmight be understood as a form of joint attention to the past (Hoerl\n& McCormack 2005; Seemann forthcoming).\nBy providing a novel test case, collective memory also\nhas the potential to shed light on general concepts and theories in\nsocial ontology. For example, Smith (2014) has pointed out that,\nwhereas many social objects (institutions, contracts, and the like)\nare continuants, in the sense that they endure over time, the speech\nacts which, on many accounts, ground their existence, are events and\nhence exist only at a given moment in time. It is unclear how events\nmight ground the existence of continuants, and one potential solution\nto this problem is to ground the existence of social objects not in\nspeech acts but rather in forms of external memory, which are\nthemselves continuants (Ferraris [2010] 2013, 2015).\n9. The Epistemology of Memory\n\nIn addition to their implications for the metaphysics of memory,\nexternal and collective memory may have novel implications for\nepistemology (Carter & Kallestrup 2016; Clark 2015;\nMichaelian & Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\nforthcoming). Most research on the epistemology of memory, however,\nreflects the traditional concerns of individual epistemology, including\nthe viability with respect to memory knowledge of broad families of\nepistemological theories, such as internalism and externalism (Madison 2017),\nand of particular theories within those families, such as foundationalism\n(Senor 1993), coherentism (Olsson & Shogenji 2004),\nand reliabilism and virtue epistemology (Shanton 2011), as well as the\nrelevance to memory of issues such as scepticism (Baldwin 2001; Moon 2017)\nand epistemic circularity (Alston 1986). Other research on the epistemology of\nmemory tackles concerns specific to memory. As Frise (2015, Other\nInternet Resources) points out, there are unresolved debates over the\nproblem of forgotten evidence (Harman 1986), the problem of forgotten\ndefeat (A.I. Goldman 1999), and the problem of stored beliefs (Moon\n2012). There are also ongoing debates over the alleged analogy between\ntestimony and memory (Barnett 2015; Dummett 1994)\nand the question whether memory is a generative or a merely\npreservative source of knowledge (Frise forthcoming; Lackey 2005;\nMatthen 2010; Salvaggio forthcoming). Issues in the\nepistemology of memory, of course, interact with issues in the\nmetaphysics of memory, but, as there is\na separate entry on the epistemology\nof memory, these interactions will not be explored here in any detail.\n10. The Ethics of Memory\n\nThe ethics of memory is a relatively new area, but research in this\narea already concerns a number of distinct questions.\n10.1 Memory and moral responsibility\n\nThe research on remembering as mental time travel introduced above\nemphasizes the relationship between episodic memory and its\nfuture-oriented counterpart, episodic future thought, and there are\npotential links between mental time travel and moral\nresponsibility. Levy (2014; cf. Vierra 2016), for example, has\nargued that deficits in episodic memory and episodic future thought in\npsychopathy (Kennett & Matthews 2009; McIlwain 2010)\nimply that psychopaths cannot genuinely intend to harm others and that they\ntherefore may not have full moral responsibility for their actions.\nCraver et al. (2016), however, argue that subjects with deficits in\nepisodic memory and episodic future thought make moral judgements\nsimilar to those made by normal subjects, suggesting that more work\nneeds to be done to establish a definitive link between mental time\ntravel and moral responsibility.\n10.2 The duty to remember\n\nSome researchers have argued that we may have a moral duty to\nremember. Margalit (2002), for example, argues that we have a\nduty to remember the victims of radical evil. Such an\nobligation\u2014which, as Blustein (2008) points out,\nmight hold either at the individual or the collective\nlevel\u2014would be consistent with the spirit behind\ntruth and reconciliation commissions and similar institutions (Neumann\n& Thompson 2015). But the existence of a duty to\nremember is controversial, with some maintaining that there is no general\nduty to remember the past and even that there may in some cases be a duty\nto forget (Rieff 2016).\n10.3 The right to be forgotten\n\nOur increasing reliance on novel forms of external memory, may have\nsurprising ethical ramifications. The default for human memory is to\nforget, and most of the information that we encounter never makes its\nway into long-term memory. The default for computer memory, in\ncontrast, is to remember, and researchers are beginning to explore the\nethical implications of moving from a state of affairs in which\nforgetting is the norm, in the sense that one\u2019s\nwords and deeds would in general leave few permanent traces, to one in which\nremembering is the norm, in the sense that many of our words and deeds\nleave behind more or less permanent digital traces\n(Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009). When remembering is the norm, people\nmay, in particular, be deprived of any opportunity for a fresh start\nafter engaging in inappropriate behaviours, leading some to argue for\na right to be forgotten (Ghezzi, Pereira, &\nVesnic-Alujevic 2014; J. Rosen 2012). From a legal and technological\npoint of view, such a right is likely to be difficult to implement.\nFrom a moral point of view, a right to be forgotten may imply a duty\nto forget, and it is unclear whether we can plausibly be held to have\nsuch a duty (Matheson 2013).\n10.4 The ethics of external memory\n\nNovel external memory technologies may ultimately reshape the norms\ngoverning individual remembering (Burkell 2016; O\u2019Hara 2013),\nbut even in the short term there are pressing ethical questions\nrelated to the impact of external memory technologies on\ncognition and the self. Regarding cognition, some have, as noted in\nsection 8, voiced unease about the cognitive impact of increasingly\nprevalent use of such technologies (Carr 2010). Others, however, are more\noptimistic (Bell & Gemmell 2009), and assessing the empirical\nevidence for optimistic and pessimistic claims about the cognitive\nimpact of external memory technologies is no easy matter (Heersmink\n2016; Loh & Kanai 2016). Regarding the self, Heersmink (2015,\nforthcoming) has argued that an extended mind perspective implies that there are\nstrict ethical constraints against interfering with individuals\u2019\nexternal memories (cf. N. Levy 2007). Clowes (2013, 2015), however,\nhas raised the possibility that the fact that internet-connected forms\nof external memory are often strongly influenced by agents other than\nthe individuals to whom they belong means that they do not count as\nparts of the relevant individuals\u2019 minds.\n10.5 The ethics of memory modification and enhancement\n\nWith the emergence of new techniques for altering the functioning of\nmemory systems\u2014for example, retrieval of a stored memory results\nin a period of reconsolidation during which the retrieved memory is\nlabile and susceptible to modification, potentially allowing\ninterventions to alter traumatic memories (Spiers & Bendor\n2014)\u2014ethical questions concerning various forms of memory\nmodification have become more pressing (Erler 2011; Hui &\nFisher 2015; N. Levy 2012; Liao & Wasserman 2007). Liao and\nSandberg (2008) identify a number of questions raised by memory\nmodification technologies; in light of the close relationship between\nmemory and the self noted above, it is no surprise that many of these\nconcern the effects of memory modification on the self. Modifying\nsomeone\u2019s memories may, for example, limit his self-knowledge by\ndepriving him of opportunities to learn about his own actions or erode\nhis sense of agency by depriving him of the possibility of viewing\nhimself as an agent with respect to events in which he was involved.\nNevertheless, Liao and Sandberg argue that, in certain cases, the\nbenefits of memory modification may outweigh its costs, so that there\nneed be no general ethical barrier to the use of emerging memory\nmodification technologies. Much of the debate so far has focussed on\nthe suppression of traumatic or otherwise undesirable memories, but\nparallel questions are raised by the use of novel methods for the\nenhancement of memory abilities by pharmaceutical and other\nmeans (Bostrom & Sandberg 2009). Critics of the memory\nenhancement debate, however, have argued that the evidence for the efficacy of\nthe relevant methods is mixed (Zohny 2015) or that the debate often\noverlooks important differences among kinds of memory (Fox, Fitz,\n& Reiner forthcoming).",
