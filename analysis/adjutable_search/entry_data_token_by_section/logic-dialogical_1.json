The Standard Dialogical Framework of the Lorenzen and Lorenz Tradition\n\nAs hinted by its name, the dialogical framework studies dialogues; but\nit also takes the form of dialogues. In a dialogue, two parties\n(players) argue on a thesis (a certain statement that is the subject\nof the whole argument) and follow certain fixed rules in their\nargument. The player who states the thesis is the proponent, called\nP, and his rival, the player who challenges the\nthesis, is the opponent, called O. In challenging the\nproponent\u2019s thesis, the opponent is requiring that the proponent\ndefends his statement.\n\nThe two players are thus rivals during the play, they have opposing\ngoals, but the opposition does not necessarily have to go any further.\nIndeed, as spelled out by Marion (2006; 2009; 2010) and Keiff (2007),\nthe dialogues are a kind of \u201cgame of giving and asking for\nreasons\u201d (Brandom 1994, see also Sellars 1997), and this kind of\ngame can be for a common goal (e.g., figuring out the truth). There\ndoes not seem to be a consensus on whether the framework does allow\ncooperation or not. Some, like Dutilh Novaes (2015; 2020), have argued that\nthe original dialogical framework is only adversarial and does not\nconsider cooperation games. However, others have argued on the\ncontrary that even the original framework is actually not entirely\nadversarial: Hodges (2001), for example, considers that some attacks\nin these games actually amount to helping the adversary.\n\nActions in a dialogue are called moves; they are often understood as\nspeech-acts involving declarative utterances (statements) and\ninterrogative utterances (requests). The rules for dialogues thus\nnever deal with expressions isolated from the act of uttering them; by\ndefining the appropriate interactions in a dialogue, these rules\ndefine the meaning of the expressions. Such an approach to meaning\nfinds its roots in Wittgenstein\u2019s observation that in language,\nthere is no exterior perspective that would allow one to determine the\nmeaning of something and how it links to syntax. In other words,\nlanguage is unavoidable, one cannot go beyond it (this is\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u201cUnhintergehbarkeit der\nSprache\u201d). Accordingly, language is studied with and\nthrough language-games; these language-games need to acknowledge the\nfact that they are part of their object of study. In this respect, all\nthe speech-acts pertaining to the meaning and \u201cformation\u201d\nof an expression are made explicit in the dialogical framework. We are\nthus far from the metalinguistic perspective constitutive of the\nmodel-theoretic conceptions of meaning (see Lorenz 1970: 109; Sundholm\n1997; 2001).\n",
