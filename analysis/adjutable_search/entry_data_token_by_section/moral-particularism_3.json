    "main_text": "Problems for Absolute Principles\n4. Problems for Absolute Principles\n\n\nThe previous section tried to lay out the main aspects of the\nparticularist conception of moral thought, and of the way in which\nactions get to be right and wrong. Particularists do not, however,\nrestrict themselves to expounding their own view. Of course, they are\nlikely to say that their view is at least possible, and that\ngeneralism tends merely to assume otherwise and then to carry on\nblithely. The mere possibility that particularism should be true is of\nsome importance in the dialectic. But there are also reasons for\ndoubting whether any form of generalism can really be true. Some of\nthese have already emerged; these involved the attempt to establish a\nbroad holism of reasons, by appeal to examples. There are replies to\nsuch attempts, which we will consider in  \n Section 8 (below); \n the replies amount to the claim that, despite appearances, holism\nmust be false.\n\n\nIn the present section we consider reasons for thinking that morality\ncannot be a system of absolute principles.\n\n\nThe first reason is that absolute principles cannot conflict, and that\nif they cannot conflict a vital aspect of our moral lives (that is,\nconflict) has been left out of account altogether by any theory that\nsupposes that morality is entirely governed by absolute\nprinciples.\n\n\nIf two supposed absolute principles conflict in a single case, one of\nthem must be abandoned. Suppose, for instance that one principle says\nthat all actions of type A are wrong and another says that\nall actions of type B are right. Suppose also that no action\ncan be both overall wrong and overall right, and that it is possible\nfor an action to be of both types, A and B. Things\nare all right so far, but if there were an action of both types, one\nor other of the principles would have to have abandoned. But this\nmeans that we have no room for conflict.  What is meant by moral\nconflict here is not conflict between two individuals, but conflict\nbetween reasons for and against in a given case. There cannot\nbe that sort of conflict, if all reasons are specified in absolute\nprinciples, because if the reasons conflicted the principles\nspecifying them would conflict, and this would just show that one of\nthe principles was a fraud. Conflict would, then, never be more than a\nproduct of our own misconceptions. There would be no real\nconflict.\n\n\nWhat this criticism amounts to is the complaint that we need to be\nable to make sense of cases in which there are moral reasons on both\nsides, for and against. But we cannot do this effectively if all moral\nreasons are specified in absolute principles. Morality cannot,\ntherefore, be just a system of absolute principles. The only way in\nwhich we could continue to think of morality as governed by absolute\nprinciples is to suppose that there is only one such principle, so\nthat there is no possibility of conflict between principles, or to\narrange things in some other way so that the principles are incapable\nof conflict. (Even then, of course, there would be the worry that\nconflict is real, and that to arrange things so that conflict is\nmerely apparent is to erase something important.) We know of one\nposition that offers only one principle: classical utilitarianism. The\nargument against this \u2018monistic\u2019 position is rather\ndifferent. The argument is the direct claim that monism is false;\nthere is more than one sort of relevant property, or more than one way\nin which features can get to be morally relevant. So a position with\nonly one absolute principle is false, and one with more than one such\nprinciple cannot make proper sense of conflict.\n",
