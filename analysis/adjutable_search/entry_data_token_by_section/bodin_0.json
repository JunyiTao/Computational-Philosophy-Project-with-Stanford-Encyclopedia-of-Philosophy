    "main_text": "Bodin\u2019s Life in Politics and Religion: Concord or Tolerance?\n1. Bodin\u2019s Life in Politics and Religion: Concord or Tolerance?\nJean Bodin was born near Angers between June 1529 and June 1530 to\nGuillaume Bodin, a wealthy \u201cmaster tailor,\u201d and Catherine\nDutertre. Bodin studied in his hometown and while still young, took\nthe habit of the Carmelites and lived in the monastery of\nNotre-Dames-des-Carmes. In 1545 he traveled to Paris with some of his\nreligious brothers to study philosophy under the tutelage of the\nCarmelite Guillaume Pr\u00e9vost. The two years Bodin spent in\ncapital city were rich in intellectual and spiritual\nexperiences. In 1550 he\nstudied at the respected law faculty of the University of Toulouse\nunder the direction of Arnaud du Ferrier. \nAt the end of his studies in Toulouse, Bodin became the scientific\neditor for the Latin translation (Oppiani De venatione, 1555)\nfrom the Greek of Oppian of Apamea\u2019s third-century treatise on\nhunting.  In this work Bodin included a warm dedication to his\nprotector, Gabriel Bouvery, Bishop of Angers. In 1559, he published in Latin an\nAddress to the Senate and People of Toulouse on the Education of\nYouth in the Commonwealth (Oratio de instituenda in republica\njuventute ad senatum populumque Tolosatem, 1559).  Here Bodin\npraises humanism and calls for it to be taught in the public schools.\nAccording to Bodin, if humanism were included in the cultural\neducation the youth received, the political and religious harmony of\nthe State would be strengthened (Oratio 25):\n\n I maintain that there may be no law so sacred and divine that could\nbetter reinforce the social ties of the city than a common and\nidentical education for all children. Even in spiritual matters, it\nenables the realization of the most perfect harmony of convictions\nbetween all citizens (summa conspiratione civium). However,\nif the role of ecclesiastical leaders is to ensure that the true\nreligion (religo vera) is not stained by superstition or\nimpiety, it is also the role of the magistrates, who hold the reins of\nthe State, to ensure that the youth do not forsake the one, unchanging\nreligion to follow other, diverse beliefs (ab una et eadem\nreligione in varias distrahatur). In this manner we may conserve\nthe semblance of a State. [trans. by the \n author][1]\n\n\n One education for all citizens and one religion for all the faithful\nwere Bodin\u2019s conditions for civil agreement and cooperation within a\nState. Cultural and religious diversity were to be avoided. These\nideas remained important themes throughout his life.\nIn 1560 Bodin returned to Paris where he was received by the\nParlement as \u201cCounsel to the king.\u201d In 1562 he signed the\noath of Catholicity that was required by the Chapter of Notre Dame of\nParis as of November 15, 1561. At the beginning of the civil wars,\nBodin wrote a letter to Jean Bautru of Matras, a counselor in the\nParlement of Paris who was also attracted to evangelical ideas. In the\nletter, Bodin believed that the \u201ctrue faith\u201d was the cause of the\ncivil conflict that afflicted France. Nevertheless he added that there\nwas no better proof of Christianity\u2019s truth than that \u201chuman\nforces conspire against it. If religion can be considered as the\ngrounds and cause of wars, then those wars may be like a caring doctor\nwho cannot heal a deep-seated disease without causing great pain or\nprovoking much moaning from the patient.\u201d Thus, Constantine\nstruggled against the tyrants for the \u201cChristian\nreligion,\u201d and before him Moses and Judas Macchabee fought\nagainst superstition (Lettre Bautru, [Ro] 79\u201380).  Bodin\u2019s\nopinion on this subject is contained in a brief document in which he\nis less concerned to discuss the causes of the current war than he is\nto describe the distinguishing characteristics of his faith.  The\nsages of antiquity and the Christian era, he recalls, all\ndistinguished themselves through their high morals and piety.\nIn 1566 Bodin published Method for the Easy Comprehension\nof History (Methodus).  In this work Bodin developed\nhis conception of universal, historical knowledge.  Not only did\nhistorical and juridical knowledge enable the proper management and\ngovernment of the State, but also rendered the State\u2019s forms and\nchanges (conversiones) intelligible.\nBodin continually surprises readers with the wide range of his\nknowledge. For example in his Response to the Paradoxes of\nMonsieur de Malestroit (Response, 1568), he explains\nhis views on economic and financial matters. His theses on free trade,\nthe benefits of exportation, and the error of establishing the value\nof money through royal decree regardless of the laws of the market,\nwere unexpected by his contemporaries. His reputation grew along with\nhis interest in public life and the problems of the realm. Also in\n1568, he attended the Estates of Narbonne, possibly as an envoy for\nthe central government. In 1570, he became the gruyer and\nprosecutor for the king in a commission for the forests of\nNormandy. During a debate on the ancient, royal right to collect\ntithes on the sale of forests, Bodin opposed the tithes and the\nsale. He considered both as forms of alienation; the king was only a\ncommon user of forests that actually belonged to the people. King\nCharles IX ignored Bodin\u2019s objections and issued an edict in 1571\nalienating his rights. Regardless of this tension with the king, Bodin\nbecame the \u201cmaster of petitions\u201d and counselor to the\nking\u2019s youngest brother, Fran\u00e7ois-Hercule, who was then the\nDuke of Alen\u00e7on. On August 8, 1573, Bodin was in Metz as a\nmember of the delegation that received the ambassadors of Poland, who\ncame to offer their country\u2019s crown to the king\u2019s brother Henry, Duke\nof Anjou. The Bishop and Duke of Langres, Charles des Cars, welcomed\nthe ambassadors in a speech delivered in Latin. Bodin immediately\ntranslated the speech into French (La Harangue, 1573). On\nthis occasion, Bodin contacted the negotiators who favored Henry\u2019s\nelection to the Polish throne, including the Bishop of Valence, Jean\nde Monluc, and the State Counselor, Guy Du Faur de Pibrac.  Bodin had\nknown de Pibrac for many years, and Bodin later dedicated his\nCommonwealth to him. These contacts favored Bodin\u2019s entry\ninto the court of Henry, King of Poland, who also became King of\nFrance in 1574. In the meantime, Bodin\u2019s social situation improved\nthanks to his marriage to Fran\u00e7oise Trouilliart on February 25,\n1576. After the marriage, he succeeded his recently deceased\nbrother-in-law, Nicolas Trouilliart to the position of the king\u2019s\nprosecutor at the pr\u00e9sidial of Laon. \n\n The year 1576 was central in Bodin\u2019s life; in that year he published\nhis Six Books of the Commonwealth\n(R\u00e9publique). In this monumental work Bodin tries to\nrestore the institutional bases of the French kingdom, which the\non-going war threatened to undermine on account of, among other\nthings, the Reformers\u2019 doctrine concerning tyranny and tyrannicide.\nFor example, Bodin writes (R\u00e9publique I, 8)\nabout certain authors of slander and treatises:\n\n\n\u2026those who have written on the duties of\n magistrates[2] \n  and other similar\n books[3] \n are wrong to support the idea that the Estates of the People [Estates\nGeneral] are more important than the prince. Such ideas make obedient\nsubjects revolt when they should obey their sovereign prince\n[\u2026] These notions are absurd (absurdes) and incompatible\n(incompatibles). [trans. by the author; cf.[Mc] 95]  \n\n\n\n  In describing these doctrines as \u201cabsurd and\nincompatible,\u201d Bodin levels a harsh critique and lays the basis\nfor his response in his Six Books of the Commonwealth. Bodin\nsupported the right of resistance in general, but he opposed the right\n\u201cto take up arms.\u201d Armed resistance was a tactic that the\n\u201cHuguenots\u201d claimed as a right, especially after the\nravages of the St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day Massacre. But 1576 was equally\nimportant in the history of France: after the king issued the Edict of\nBeaulieu (Paix de Monsieur) on May 6 and convened the Estates General\nin Blois, the wars of religion briefly subsided. In the royal edict,\nnext to the words \u201cthose followers of the so-called Reformed\nReligion,\u201d a distinction is made between \u201cUnited\u201d\nCatholics or the \u201cUnion of Catholics,\u201d and the\n\u201cassociated\u201d Catholics. The associated Catholics comprised\nthe Duke of Montmorency and other supporters of\nFran\u00e7ois-Hercule, the current Duke of Anjou and Alen\u00e7on,\nas well as the Catholics who had signed the Act of\nAssociation in 1575 with a party of moderate\n Huguenots.[4] \n The United Catholics was an association of Catholic nobles that allied\nwith Duke Henry of Guise, advocated the reunification of the faith,\nand strove towards religious concord in\nFrance.[5] Leagues\nand associations formed on both sides of the religious and political\nspectrum until France became more and more divided.\nAt the same time, Bodin\u2019s authority as an expert in affairs of\nState was growing. By the end of November 1576, he was received at\ncourt and sometimes dined with the king in order to discuss the most\ncurrent events. Elected as the deputy of Vermandois, Bodin was sent\nofficially to the Estates General of Blois. He recorded the\nproceedings of the meeting in his journal (Recueil, 1577).\nAfter attaining the presidency of the deputies of the Third Estate,\nBodin revealed his unbending support for the interests of the\n\u201cpeople.\u201d Beginning with the meetings held in the middle\nof February 1577 in Blois, he refused to compromise with the clergy\nand nobility who desired to review the Cahiers des\n\u00c9tats in order to render the Third Estate the\nminority. Bodin\u2019s haughty remarks jeopardized his position in the eyes\nof the king. Moreover he was firmly opposed to two royal petitions for\nsubsidies as well as the perpetual alienation of crown territory,\nwhich he considered the \u201cproperty of the people.\u201d This\nresistance to royal power in matters of financial politics went hand\nin hand with his resistance in matters of religious politics. Bodin\nwanted to see an end to the religious wars. Totally convinced of the\nneed for religious concord in order to facilitate political\nunification, he was willing to accept temporary measures of toleration\nuntil religious reunification could be achieved through the meeting of\n\u201ca national or general council to resolve matters of\nreligion\u201d which was slated to be held \u201ctwo years\nlater.\u201d In opposition to propositions made by Versoris (Pierre\nLe Tourneur), a fierce member of the League who supported violent\nmeans, Bodin was in agreement with the majority of the Third Estate\nwhose deputies concluded that \u201cthe majority of voices will\nimplore the king by written request, to unite his subjects in a\nCatholic, apostolic, and Roman religion by all holy and legitimate\nmeans without war.\u201d Here, in two lines, was the essence of\nBodin\u2019s program of concord\u2014not permanent religious\ntolerance. In the meantime, on January 6, 1577, Henry III had revoked\nthe recent Edict of Beaulieu, and declared that he would no longer\ntolerate the \u201cso-called Reformed religion\u201d in his realm.\nInstead he would allow only the Catholic religion in France. At the\nsame time, he took charge of the League or the Catholic Union.\nThe tensions with the sovereign did not advance Bodin\u2019s career. He\nhad to content himself for the time being as the royal prosecutor at\nthe pr\u00e9sidial of Laon, where he planned to retire. His\nstudies and intellectual work increased and in 1578 he published\nExposition of Universal Law (Juris), a small\nmethodic textbook in which his theory of universal rights completes\nhis vision of universal history that he had developed earlier in the\nMethod. His work on judicial and historical research received\nnot only praise, but also criticism, often harsh, which malicious\nreaders heaped on him. For example, Michel of La Serre published a\nRemonstrance au Roi sur les pernicieux discours contenus au livre\nde la R\u00e9publique de Bodin in 1579 that accused Bodin of\nattempting to diminish the sovereignty of the king and of defending,\nwithout being explicit, the Huguenots. This was exactly the opposite\nof what Bodin was trying to accomplish in his published works. On the\nother hand, the second accusation\u2014the secretive membership in\nthe Reformed religion\u2014has found favor today amongst some modern\nbiographers who attribute this membership to Bodin as a badge of\nhonor.  Bodin, knowing well that these two accusations were unfounded\ndid not deem it necessary to respond to his slanderer, le sieur de\nLa Serre, who in the meantime had been imprisoned on orders of\nthe king. But serious and reasoned opposition to Bodin\u2019s work was also\nnot lacking. Professor Andreas Franckenberger did not accept the\narguments that Bodin leveled against the ideas of Sleidan and\nMelanchthon concerning the Old Testament book of \nDaniel.[6] \nThey had posited that\naccording to Daniel\u2019s theory of the \u201cfour monarchies\u201d the\nmonarchy following Holy Roman Empire was destined to rule the\nworld. Pierre de l\u2019Hostal disputed Bodin\u2019s effort to reduce, through\nmathematic formulae, the number of government \ntypes.[7] \nAs for Bodin\u2019s friend,\nthe medical doctor Augier Ferrier of Toulouse, he also challenged the\nnumerology with which Bodin attempted to forecast governmental\nchange.[8] In\nresponse to Ferrier and other detractors, Bodin took up the pen not\nonly to defend himself but also to attack his critics in his work\nDefense of Jean Bodin by Ren\u00e9 Herpin\n(Apologie, 1581).\n\nBodin\u2019s critics became more serious and dangerous with regard to\nhis On the Demon-mania of Witches that was published in 1581\n(D\u00e9monomanie). In his letter of dedication (December\n20, 1579) to Christophle de Thou, the first president of the Parlement\nof Paris, Bodin explains why he write the work and the meaning of its\ntitle. First, he hoped to denounce the mania, the spiritual errors,\nand distraction, as well as the \u201cfury\u201d that sorcerers\npossess as they \u201cchase after the devil.\u201d He wrote this\ntreaty with two purposes in mind: on the one hand, \u201cto use it as\na warning to all who will see him [the devil],\u201d and on the other\nhand, \u201cto alert readers that there is no crime that could be\nmore atrocious or deserve more serious punishment.\u201d Bodin wished\nto speak out against those who \u201ctry by all means to rescue the\nsorcerers through printed books.\u201d He reminded all that\n\u201cSatan has men in his grasp who write, publish, and speak\nclaiming that nothing that is said about sorcerers is true.\u201d It\nwas essential to provide the tools to magistrates and judges, who were\nconfronted by the accused sorcerers, in order to face this formidable\nproblem. The work was bold and perilous for its author. Many wondered\nif Bodin, so curious about this topic, such an expert, so convinced of\nthe devil\u2019s existence, may not himself have been involved with\nwitchcraft. These suspicions alarmed the authorities, and on June 3,\n1587, the general prosecutor to the Parlement of Paris ordered the\ngeneral lieutenant of the baillage of Laon to proceed with a search of\nBodin\u2019s home, on suspicion of witchcraft. This inspection brought no\nresults due to the intervention of eight prominent citizens and two\npriests who registered their support of Bodin.\nIn the 1580s, Bodin\u2019s diplomatic responsibilities were reduced at\nthe same time that the prestige of the Duke of Alen\u00e7on and\nAnjou, whom Bodin had accompanied on a voyage to England and Flanders,\ndiminished. After the Duke\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to seize Antwerp,\nBodin wrote to his brother-in-law, Nicolaus Trouilliart, on January\n22, 1583 and explained his useless efforts to dissuade the duke from\nsuch an undertaking. The death of Duke Fran\u00e7ois-Hercule, the\nyoungest brother of the king, raised dynastic problems: the\npresumptive heir, Henry of Navarre, was the leader of the Huguenots,\nand he was related to Henri III to the 22nd degree. Facing\nthe eventuality of a \u201cheretic\u201d king, the League took the\nupper hand, and the Catholics strengthened their Holy Union. The\n\u201cperpetual and irrevocable\u201d Edict of Paris (called the\nPeace of Nemour) on July 7, 1585 prohibited the exercise of the\nreformed cult, and effectively revoked the Edict of Poitiers of the\nSeptember 17, 1577 (also \u201cperpetual and irrevocable\u201d),\nwhich had conceded a slight, provisory measure of tolerance. The edict\nof 1585 was confirmed by the Edict of Rouen of July 1588 and was\nmoreover defined as the \u201cinviolable and fundamental law.\u201d\nIn other words, religious concord, in this case \u201cforced\u201d\nconcord, represented the highest priority for the lawmakers. There are\ntwo sorts of religious edicts that alternate during the wars: edicts\nof pacification and provisional tolerance, and edicts of concord and\nunion.  In the \u201cedicts of pacification,\u201d which Bodin\nbelieved were the best means to avoid war, temporary tolerance takes\nprecedence while final peace is delayed until a time when \u201cGod\nwill grant us the grace to unite the nation in the same fold.\u201d\n\u201cEdicts of Union\u201d or \u201cUniformity\u201d (this was\nthe word preferred by the Kings of England in their Acts of\nUniformity) imposed peace through force and thereby implied that\nwar could begin again. The Estates General of Blois sanctioned, on\nOctober 18, 1588, The Edict of Rouen as \u201cthe fundamental and\nirrevocable law of this kingdom.\u201d The crisis reached its peak\nduring a quick succession of events that shook the kingdom.  First, on\nDecember 23 and 24, 1588, the leader of the Catholics, Henry of\nLorraine [third Duke of Guise], and his younger brother, Louis de\nLorraine, Cardinal of Guise and Archbishop of Reims, were assassinated\non the orders Henry III. Second, in January 1589, the Parlement of\nParis denounced this \u201cmassacre,\u201d and the theology faculty\nof the Sorbonne freed subjects from their oath of faithfulness and\nobedience to the king.  Finally on August 1, 1589, Jacques\nCl\u00e9ment, believing that he was killing a tyrant, assassinated\nthe king. On August 4, 1589, Henry of Navarre claimed that he was\nwilling to \u201cbe instructed\u201d in order to return to the\nCatholic faith. The reality was such that, while the parties fought to\nclaim the throne, the kingdom was without a king and the royalist\nparty, which included Bodin, without a leader. During this period,\nBodin, as a public figure, as the man responsible for the city of\nLaon, as a well-known authority on constitutional rights, and as a\nprivate citizen, was obligated to define publicly his political\npositions.\nThe Letter by Jean Bodin in which he discuss the reasons why he\nbecame a member of the League (Lettre Bodin), of January\n20, 1590, published in Paris, Lyons, Toulouse, and Brussels, is\nclearly a masterpiece of political analysis once it is properly framed\nwithin its historical context. The work continues to be discussed and\ndisparaged by historians and biographers of Bodin. Bodin explains why\n\u201cthe inhabitants or most of them\u201d of Laon, including\nhimself, became members of the \u201cLeague.\u201d Three factors\nplayed a role: first, article 9 of the 1588 Edict of the Union order\nall subjects to \u201cjoin the current union\u201d under the threat\nof being judged guilty of\nl\u00e8se majest\u00e9; second was the fear that\n\u201ca regiment of Captain Bourg\u201d would loot the town; third,\nassassination attempts had been launched against him [Bodin], from\nwhich he had barely escaped.  Some would say that Bodin was forced to\nchange his political position, but this is not the case; rather, great\nchanges had occurred in the historical reality.  Many, but not\nall, of the royalists (\u201cregalists\u201d) found themselves\nwithout a king or a party, turned toward the League as the group with\nthe most similar agenda\u2014the program of concord. In effect, the\nroyalists and the League had had similar views regarding concord, the\nsurvival of political institutions, and the Gallic State. They\ndisagreed however about the means to achieve their objectives, most\nnotably how quickly to go to war against the Huguenots, the excessive\npower of the Duke de Guise (which diminished the authority of the\nking) and the interference of the pope and Spain. On these points\nBodin, as a loyal officer of the king, kept his distance from the\nLeague. At that time the changes were so distressing that Bodin\nbelieved it was necessary to explain publicly the new circumstances in\nwhich France and the French found themselves. Only with these new\ncircumstances in mind should Bodin\u2019s response be evaluated. He himself\ndid not question the changes because all that mattered for him was\nthat he continued to serve the people whose well-being was \u201cthe\nsupreme law.\u201d Bodin\u2019s continuing loyal service reveals his\nposition. He had considered all of the matters carefully because he\nbelieved he would face \u201cthe judgment of God,\u201d concerning\nhis own actions as well as those of France. If the town should fall\n\u201cinto the hands of enemy [clearly the Huguenots],\u201d Bodin\nwrote that he would worry neither for his life nor his goods,\n\u201cas long as I [he] could serve the public.\u201d \nExamining the general situation of the warring factions, Bodin\nexpresses himself frankly.  He knew how to judge one of the most\ncomplex moments in French history clearly and without partisanship. By\nanalyzing how he reaches his opinions, we can better understand his\nideas. The prospects for a peace agreement were small because\n\u201cthe leaders and the partisans were, whether in the State or the\nChurch, at odds in their morals, behavior, and inclinations. They\nabsolutely cannot agree by speaking together.\u201d Besides, the two\nparties were powerful internally and externally.  The Mar\u00e9chaux\nof France, the main officers of the crown, the second estate of the\nnobility all of the Huguenots, \u201cpolitiques\u201d and atheists\nand nearly all of the princes of the blood belonged to the party of\nthe King of Navarre. Thus, in Bodin\u2019s view, the \u201cpolitiques and\natheists\u201d were linked to the reformed, which he considered the\nenemy. Outside of the kingdom, they were even more powerful and\ncounted in their alliance: England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, the\nfour Swiss cantons, and the Protestant princes of Germany. Addressing\nthe party of the Holy Union, Bodin eulogized its leader, the Duke of\nMayenne [Charles of Lorraine, the third son of Duke Fran\u00e7ois de\nGuise and brother of the deceased Duke Henry], \u201cwhom it seems\nthat God has appointed to be the Protector of Religion and the\nState.\u201d In this circumstance, \u201cthis good leader, in\naddition to the public interest, can rightly pursue vengeance for his\ntwo brothers.  Unfortunately he received bad advice from those who\ntoday carry arms and who belong to the opposing party.\u201d This\nclause reveals much about Bodin\u2019s opinion regarding the assassination\nof the Guises by Henry III, whom, Bodin believed, had been ill advised\nby the Huguenots. The Catholic party was strong in France, having on\nits side all of the clergy, all of the capital cities (except for\nBordeaux), nearly all of the provinces, and 150 \u201cgood\ntowns.\u201d Abroad, the Catholics could call on the assistance of\nthe \u201cPope and the Holy See, Chief of the Union,\u201d the\nemperor and Catholic King \u201cwhom we can call, without flattery,\nthe greatest prince carrying the title of king in Christendom over the\npast 150 years.\u201d This list does not count other Catholic powers\nincluding the Dukes of Savoy, Florence, Ferrara, and Mantua, the\nCatholic Princes of Germany, and the three Elector Archbishops. As far\nas the right of succession, according to his calculations, forecasts,\nthe study of numbers, and degrees of relationship (to the thirteenth\ndegree for the Cardinal of Bourbon, Charles, brother of Antoine of\nBourbon\u2014King of Navarre, father of Henry\u2014and to the\nfourteenth degree for the present King of Navarre, Henry) Bodin had no\ndoubt that the Cardinal of Bourbon had a better claim than the King of\nNavarre.  \u201cTherefore, the King of Navarre, however good and\nclever the advice he may have, is, in my judgment, ill-advised when he\ndoes not recognize Monseigneur the Cardinal of Bourbon as king.\u201d\nHad he been better advised, Henry should have freed his uncle, whom he\nwas keeping in captivity, and allowed him to govern until succeeding\nhim.  Therefore, \u201che should stop this belligerence and contract\nan alliance with the House of Lorraine, by freeing the innocent Duke\nof Guise, [Charles of Lorraine, fourth Duke of Guise and eldest son of\nthe deceased] and the Duke of Elbeuf, [Charles of Lorraine, count of\nHarcourt] who is being punished unjustly.\u201d Bodin demonstrates\nhis political acumen here not so much concerning the forecasts he\nmakes based on numerology ( he repeats \u201cI foresee,\u201d three\nor four times) but for the recommendations he makes to the King of\nNavarre before ascending the throne. First he writes that the King of\nNavarre should be reconciled with the Catholic Church, which Navarre\nhad already announced. Second, he should give the throne to his uncle,\nCharles de Bourbon, which given that Charles was sixty-seven at the\ntime and died in May 1590, would have been a temporary arrangement.\nHenry did not do this.  Third, he should have sought an agreement\nbetween the Lorraines or the Guises and the other Catholic princes.\nNavarre does this before and after he is crowned Henry IV. These\nrecommendations prove Bodin\u2019s clear political judgment. \nHere we see a relatively little-known side to Bodin which\nnevertheless is consistent with the principles he had outlined in his\nSix Books of the Commonwealth. His advice is perceptive and\nobjective; however, historians have glossed over this fact in order to\ndepict Bodin as a man who should have been ashamed of joining the Holy\nUnion. Yet Bodin was secure in his judgment, when he wrote \n(Lettre Bodin):\n\n\n You now see, sir, that the Union\u2019s case is better founded than you\nthought [\u2026] I see that everywhere men are making great efforts\nto assist it. I beg God to give you grace. ([Ro] 92\u201393; trans. by the author).\n \n The victory of the Union would assure religious concord and the\nre-establishment of the institutions of the kingdom. This was Bodin\u2019s\nwish and this is precisely what the Catholic and \u201cvery Christian\nKing,\u201d Henry IV, later brought to fruition through the Edict of\nNantes of 1598. Nowadays, the generally accepted opinion that regards\nthe Edict of Nantes as a \u201cperpetual and irrevocable\u201d law\nof permanent tolerance (or coexistence of two religions) is erroneous.\nThis judicial measure was intended to restore the social and political\ncohesion of the realm in the short term.  In the long term it was\naimed at religious reunification in the one sole faith\u2014that of\nthe king.  That is why the Edict was defined as a \u201claw of\nconcord,\u201d through temporary tolerance. This was the\nauthoritative judgment of Pierre de Beloy, the sole contemporary\njurist and commentator of the\n Edict.[9]\n Bodin did not live to see it. He died of the plague between June and\nSeptember 1596, after having declared in his testament that he wished\nto be buried in the church of the Franciscans of Laon.\nIn his last years, Bodin occupied himself with two projects. The\nfirst, Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the Sublime,\nconcerned the essence of religion.  If indeed it was from Bodin\u2019s hand\n(and its attribution to him has as many partisans as it has its\ncritics, as we shall see), it would have been written in these final\nyears of his life. The work would be published long after his death\n(Heptaplomeres, 1683). The other, Theater of Universal\nNature (Theatrum, 1596), dealt with natural philosophy.\nHe had just enough time to add a dedicatory letter to Jacques Mitte,\nCount of Miolins on March 1, 1596. \n",
