    "main_text": "Varieties of Content || Multiple Contents\n3.5 Multiple Contents\n\nIf experiences have at most only one kind of content, then there will\nbe a substantive debate about whether experience contents are\nRussellian, unstructured, Fregean, or versions of these modified to\ntake account of indexicality. Three sorts of considerations are\ntypically invoked to decide between these: (i) which best reflect\nintuitions about veridicality of experiences; (ii) which best reflect\ndistinctions to which experiences are sensitive; (iii) which contents\nbest reflect the phenomenology of experience.\n\nSome philosophers have proposed that there are different explanatory\npurposes for contents to serve, and one kind of content cannot serve\nall of them. (On the general strategy of dividing contents in this way\nsee Fodor 1987 and White 1991.) Such philosophers think experiences\nhave multiple contents. One example of such a position holds that\nexperiences have contents that are both conceptual and\nnon-conceptual (for more on this distinction, see\n Section 6.2\n below. This kind of duality is explored by Reiland and Lyons 2015,\nand defended by by Lyons 2005a, 2005b and Bengson, Grube and Korman\n2011). Another holds that experiences have both \u2018gappy\u2019\ncontents (somewhat akin to open sentences), but have object-involving\ncontents as well when the experience stands in the right causal\nrelations to environment (e.g., Burge 1991 and Schellenberg 2010; for\ndiscussion, see Martin 2003). Here the idea is that the gappy content\nreflects the phenomenology of the experience and the commonality in\ncontent between indistinguishable hallucinations and\nnon-hallucinations, whereas the object-involving contents reflect\nintuitions about accuracy conditions for experiences that are\nadequately connected to the environment. A related idea is that\ncontents of experience include both general and object-involving\ncontents (Siegel 2010b).\n\nAnother example of a view positing multiple contents for multiple\nexplanatory purposes is Shoemaker\u2019s theory of color experience,\naccording to which experience represents both color properties, partly\nin virtue of representing associated \u2018appearance\nproperties\u2019 (see\n Section 4.1\n for discussion). The representation of appearance properties is\nsupposed to explain the phenomenal sameness of certain\nexperiences with inverted qualia; whereas the representation of color\nproperties is supposed to underlie intuitions about the veridicality\nof the experiences. (This is explained more fully in\n Section 4.1).\n A somewhat similar rationale is given for a form of\n\u2018two-dimensionalism\u2019 about experience contents, which\nholds that experiences have both indexical Fregean contents, and\nnon-Fregean contents (either Russellian or unstructured) determined by\nthe Fregean contents in conjunction with select facts about the\nenvironment in which the experience is had (Chalmers 2004, Thompson\n2003). The indexical Fregean contents are supposed to reflect the\ninferential role and phenomenology of experience, while the\nnon-Fregean contents are supposed to reflect the properties that we\ntake experiences to attribute to objects. A related two-dimensionalist\nposition (Chalmers 2006) adds a third kind of Russellian content to\nexperience, \u2018Edenic\u2019 content, involving special\nnon-instantiated \u2018Edenic\u2019 properties, which are supposed\nto reflect phenomenology perfectly\u2014unlike indexical Fregean\ncontent, which is supposed to reflect it only imperfectly.\n",
