    "main_text": "The Emergence of Ecological Rationality || Brunswik\u2019s Lens Model\n3.2 Brunswik\u2019s Lens Model\n\nEgon Brunswik was among the first to apply probability and statistics\nto the study of human perception, and was ahead of his time in\nemphasizing the role ecology plays in the generalizability of\npsychological findings. Brunswik thought psychology ought to aim for\nstatistical descriptions of adaptive behavior (Brunswik 1943). Instead\nof isolating a small number of independent variables to manipulate\nsystematically to observe the effects on a dependent\nvariable, psychological experiments ought instead to assess how an\norganism adapts to its environment. So, not only should experimental\nsubjects be representative of the population, as one would presume,\nbut the experimental situations they are subjected to ought to be\nrepresentative of the environment that the subjects inhabit (Brunswik\n1955). Thus, Brunswik maintained, psychological experiments ought to\nemploy a representative design to preserve the causal\nstructure of an organism\u2019s natural environment. For a review of\nthe development of representative design and its use in the study of\njudgment and decision-making, see Dhami, Hertwig, & Hoffrage\n2004.\n\nBrunswik\u2019s lens model is formulated around his ideas\nabout how behavioral and environmental conditions bear on organisms\nperceiving proximal cues to draw inferences about some distal feature\nof its \u201cnatural-cultural habitat\u201d (Brunswik 1955: 198). To\nillustrate, an organism may detect the color markings (distal object)\nof a potential mate through contrasts in light frequencies reflecting\nacross its retina (proximal cues). Some proximal cues will be more\ninformative about the distal objects of interest than others, which\nBrunswik understood as a difference in the \u201cobjective\u201d\ncorrelations between proximal cues and the target distal objective.\nThe ecological validity of proximal cues thus refers to their\ncapacity for providing the organism useful information about some\ndistal object within a particular environment. Assessments of\nperformance for an organism then amount to a comparison of the\norganism\u2019s actual use of cue information to the cue\u2019s\ninformation capacity.\n\nKenneth Hammond and colleagues (K. Hammond, Hursch, & Todd 1964)\nformulated Brunswik\u2019s lens model as a system of linear bivariate\ncorrelations, as depicted in\n Figure 2\n (Hogarth & Karelaia 2007). Informally,\n Figure 2\n says that the accuracy of a subject\u2019s judgment (response),\n\\(Y_s\\), about a numerical target criterion, \\(Y_e\\), given some\ninformative cues (features) \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), is determined by the\ncorrelation between the subject\u2019s response and the target. More\nspecifically, the linear lens model imagines two large linear systems,\none for the environment, e, and another for the subject,\ns, which both share a set of cues, \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Note\nthat cues may be associated with one another, i.e., it is possible\nthat \\(\\rho(X_i,X_j) \\neq 0\\) for indices \\(i\\neq j\\) from 1 to\nn.\n\nThe accuracy of the subject\u2019s judgment \\(Y_s\\) about the target\ncriterion value \\(Y_e\\) is measured by an achievement index,\n\\(r_a\\), which is computed by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient\n\\(\\rho\\) of \\(Y_e\\) and \\(Y_s\\). The subject\u2019s predicted\nresponse \\(\\hat{Y}_s\\) to the cues is determined by the weights\n\\(\\beta_{s_i}\\) the subject assigns to each cue \\(X_i\\), and the\nlinearity of the subject\u2019s response, \\(R_s\\), measures the noise\nin the system, \\(\\epsilon_s\\). Thus, the subject\u2019s response is\nconceived to be a weighted linear sum of subject-weighted cues plus\nnoise. The analogue of response linearity in the environment\nis environmental predictability, \\(R_e\\). The environment, on\nthis model, is thought to be probabilistic\u2014or\n\u201cchancy\u201d as some say. Finally, the environment-weighted\nsum of cues, \\(\\hat{Y}_e\\), is compared to the subject-weighted sum of\ncues, \\(\\hat{Y}_s\\), by a matching index, G.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:\n Brunswik\u2019s Lens Model\n[An extended description of this figure is in the supplement.]\n\n\n\nIn light of this formulation of the lens model, return to\nSimon\u2019s remarks concerning the classification of environmental\naffordance versus behavioral constraint. The conception of the lens\nmodel as a linear model is indebted to signal detection theory, which\nwas developed to improve the accuracy of early radar systems. Thus,\nthe model inherits from engineering a clean division between subject\nand environment. However, suppose for a moment that both the\nenvironmental mechanism producing the criterion value and the\nsubject\u2019s predicted response are linear. Now consider the\nerror-term, \\(\\epsilon_s\\). That term may refer to biological\nconstraints that are responses to adaptive pressures on the whole\norganism. If so, ought \\(\\epsilon_s\\) be classified as an\nenvironmental constraint rather than a behavioral constraint? The\nanswer will depend on what follows from the reclassification, which\nwill depend on the model and the goal of inquiry\n (section 8).\n If we were using the lens model to understand the ecological validity\nof an organism\u2019s judgment, then reclassifying \\(\\epsilon_s\\) as\nan environmental constraint would only introduce confusion; If instead\nour focus was to distinguish between behavior that is subject to\nchoice and behavior that is precluded from choice, then the proposed\nreclassification may herald clarity\u2014but then we would surely\nabandon the lens model for something else, or in any case would no\nlonger be referring to the parameter \\(\\epsilon_s\\) in\n Figure 2.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the lens model, like nearly all\nlinear models used to represent human judgment and decision-making,\ndoes not scale well as a descriptive model. In multi-cue\ndecision-making tasks involving more than three cues, people often\nturn to simplifying heuristics due to the complications involved in\nperforming the necessary calculations\n (section 2.1;\n see also\n section 4).\n More generally, as we remarked in\n section 2.3,\n linear models involve calculating trade-offs that are difficult for\npeople to perform. Lastly, the supposition that the environment is\nlinear is a strong modeling assumption. Quite apart from the\ndifficulties that arise for humans to execute the necessary\ncomputations, it becomes theoretically more difficult to justify model\nselection decisions as the number of features increases. The matching\nindex G is a goodness-of-fit measure, but goodness-of-fit tests\nand residual analysis begin to lead to misleading conclusions for\nmodels with as five or more dimensions. Modern machine learning\ntechniques for supervised learning get around this limitation by\nfocusing on analogues of the achievement index, construct predictive\nhypotheses purely instrumentally, and dispense with matching\naltogether (Wheeler 2017).\n",
