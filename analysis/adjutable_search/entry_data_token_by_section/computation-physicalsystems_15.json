If what counts as\nyielding the values of a function is left unspecified, any of the\nsystems discussed in Section 4.1, such as genuinely random processes\nand systems that manipulate arbitrary real-valued quantities, would\ncount as hypercomputers. But in discussing Bold Physical CTT, we saw\nthat yielding the values of a function that is Turing-uncomputable,\nwithout further constraints, is not enough for genuine physical\ncomputation.\n\nBy analogy with the distinction between Bold Physical CTT and Modest\nPhysical CTT, let us distinguish between a weak and a strong notion of\nhypercomputation by distinguishing usable hypercomputers from unusable\nhypercomputational processes.\n\nAn unusable hypercomputational process is a physical process\nthat fails to satisfy at least one of the first four constraints on\nphysical computation. Examples include processes whose inputs or\noutputs are arbitrary real-valued quantities (which cannot be read\nwith infinite precision) and genuine random processes (which have no\nrule characterizing the inputs and outputs independently of the\nprocess and are neither repeatable nor settable). These processes are\nnot usable because an observer cannot obtain from them arbitrary\nvalues of an independently defined function on a chosen input, as\nordinary computing systems can (given enough time and space). Since\nthey are not usable, unusable hypercomputational processes are\nirrelevant to Modest Physical CTT.\n\nA usable hypercomputer is a physical system that satisfies at\nleast the first four constraints on physical computation. It has\nreadable inputs and outputs, there is a rule characterizing its\ninput-output properties that may be defined independently of the\nprocess itself, and its processes are repeatable and settable. If a\nsystem does not satisfy one of these conditions, it does not count as\ncomputing in the sense relevant to Modest Physical CTT.\n\nA system that satisfies these conditions\u2014a usable\nhypercomputer\u2014may be purely notional. For instance, infinitely\naccelerating TMs (Copeland 2002) are TMs that perform each\ncomputational operation in half the time as their previous operation.\nAs a consequence, infinitely accelerating TMs complete an infinite\nnumber of operations (a supertask) within twice the time it\ntakes them to perform their first operation. This allows infinitely\naccelerating TMs to compute functions, such as the halting function,\nthat are Turing-uncomputable. But infinitely accelerating TMs are\nusually discussed as notional entities, without evidence that they can\nbe constructed. Purely notional systems, of course, do not falsify\nModest Physical CTT. To do that, a system must satisfy at least the\nfifth and sixth constraints on physical computation: it must be\nphysically constructible, and it must operate reliably.\n\nOne way to construct something like an infinitely accelerating TM\nwould be to make a computing machine that, after performing some\ncomputational operations, builds a smaller and faster copy of itself\n(Davies 2001). The smaller and faster copy will also perform some\noperations and then build a faster and smaller copy, and so on. Given\nappropriate assumptions, the resulting series of infinitely shrinking\nmachines will be able to complete an infinite number of computational\noperations within a finite time, thereby surpassing the power of TMs.\nWhile infinitely shrinking machines appear to be consistent with\nNewtonian mechanics, Davies (2001, 672) points out that the atomic and\nquantum mechanical nature of matter in our universe makes infinitely\nshrinking machines physically impossible.\n\nNeural networks have sometimes been discussed as computing systems\nthat may go beyond Turing-computability (e.g., Smolensky 1988). If we\nrestrict our attention to classes of neural networks that contain all\nsystems with current or foreseeable practical applications, this\nopinion is unwarranted. There is now a considerable literature on the\ncomputational and complexity properties of large classes of neural\nnetworks. The most relevant systems have digital inputs and outputs\n(so as to satisfy our first constraint on physical computation) but\nmay have, and typically do have, non-digital internal processes (i.e.,\ntheir internal processes are not discrete step-by-step manipulations\nof strings of digits). The main results are the following: (i)\nfeedforward networks with finitely many processing units are\ncomputationally equivalent to Boolean circuits with finitely many\ngates; (ii) recurrent networks with finitely many units are equivalent\nto finite state automata; (iii) networks with unbounded tapes or an\nunbounded number of units are equivalent to TMs (\u0160\u00edma\n& Orponen 2003).\n\nNeural networks more powerful than TMs may be defined, however, by\nexploiting once again the expressive power of real numbers. The best\nknown networks of this kind are Analog Recurrent Neural Networks\n(ARNNs) (Siegelmann 1999). ARNNs should not be confused with analog\ncomputers in the traditional sense (Pour-El 1974, Rubel 1993, Mills\n2008). Whereas analog computers manipulate real variables without\nrelying on the exact value of arbitrary real-valued quantities, ARNNs\nmanipulate strings of digits by (possibly) relying on the exact value\nof arbitrary real-valued quantities. Specifically, the weights\nconnecting individual processing units within ARNNs can take exact\nvalues of arbitrary real numbers, including values that are\nTuring-uncomputable, and such exact values are exploited in the\ncomputation. When their weights are Turing-uncomputable, ARNNs can go\nbeyond the power of Turing-machines: they compute any function over\nbinary strings. ARNNs more powerful than TMs cannot operated reliably,\nbecause they require unboundedly precise weights. In addition, the\nrequired weights are Turing-uncomputable, so constructing ARRNs more\npowerful than TMs requires already possessing the ability to perform\nhypercomputations (Davis 2004, Schonbein 2005, Siegelmann 1999,\n148).\n\nPerhaps the best-known proposal for a hypercomputer is due to Mark\nHogarth (1994, 2004), who developed an idea of Itamar Pitowsky (1990).\nRelativistic hypercomputers exploit the properties of a special kind\nof spacetime called Malament-Hogarth spacetime, which is physically\npossible in the sense of constituting a solution to Einstein\u2019s field\nequations for General Relativity. Malament-Hogarth spacetimes contain\nregions with an infinite time-like trajectory \u03bb that can be\ncircumvented by a finite time-like trajectory \u03b3. In other words,\n\u03bb and \u03b3 have a common origin, and there is a spacetime\npoint p on \u03b3 such that \u03bb, even though it is\ninfinite, lies entirely in p\u2019s chronological past. If an\nobserver launches a TM along \u03bb and then travels along \u03b3\nshe may, within finite time, find herself in the future of an\ninfinitely long computation performed by the TM. If the TM is able to\nsend signals to the observer, the observer would be able to know the\noutcome of a potentially infinitely long computation, thereby having\ncomputational means more powerful than (ordinary) TMs. For instance,\nan observer may be able to obtain the results of an arbitrary instance\nof the halting function for TMs.\n\nConstructing and using a relativistic hypercomputer is challenging.\nThe first question is whether our spacetime is Malament-Hogarth. The\nanswer is currently unknown. Even if our spacetime is not\nMalament-Hogarth globally, it might still contain regions that have\nthe Malament-Hogarth property locally. An example of such a region is\na huge, rotating black hole; there is evidence that our universe\ncontains such black holes (Etesi and N\u00e9meti 2002). But even if\nthere are Malament-Hogarth regions in our universe, there remain\nconsiderable obstacles. For starters, (i) the huge, rotating black\nhole that is closest to us is probably out of our reach as well as our\ndescendants\u2019 reach, (ii) completing an infinite computation requires\nan unbounded memory, which might require an unbounded amount of\nmatter, and (iii) a machine that requires an unbounded amount of\nmatter running for an infinite amount of time will malfunction with\nprobability 1, rendering it useless (Button, 2009, 779). The latter\nchallenge might be addressable by employing multiple self-reproducing\nand self-correcting machines that check one another\u2019s\ncomputations instead of a single machine (Andr\u00e9ka et al. 2018),\nalthough that seems to exacerbate the need for unbounded resources\n(see also N\u00e9meti and D\u00e1vid 2006, Andr\u00e9ka,\nN\u00e9meti, and N\u00e9meti 2009).\n\nQuantum computing has also been invoked as a possible source of\nhypercomputation. Quantum computing is the manipulation of qubits (and\nmore generally, qudits) in accordance with the laws of quantum\nmechanics. Qubits are variables that, like bits, can be prepared or\nmeasured in one or two states, 0 and 1. Unlike bits, qubits can (i)\ntake states that are a superposition of 0 and 1 and (ii) become\nentangled with each other during a computation. A surprising feature\nof quantum computing is that it allows computing certain functions\nmuch faster than any known classical computation (Shor 1994). But\nwhile mainstream quantum computing may be more efficient than\nclassical computing, it does not allow computing any functions beyond\nthose computable by TMs.\n\nSome authors have questioned whether the mainstream quantum computing\nparadigm is general enough and, if not, whether some aspects of\nquantum mechanics may be exploited to design a quantum hypercomputer\n(Nielsen 1997, Calude and Pavlov 2002). The most prominent proposal\nfor a quantum hypercomputer is due to Tien Kieu (2002, 2003, 2004,\n2005). He argues that an appropriately constructed quantum system can\ndecide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has an integral\nsolution\u2014a problem which is known to be unsolvable by TMs.\nKieu\u2019s method involves encoding a specific instance of the problem in\nan appropriate Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of a\nquantum system. Kieu shows that such a system can dynamically evolve\nover time into an energy ground state that encodes the desired\nsolution. Unfortunately, Kieu\u2019s scheme does not appear to be workable.\nFor one thing, it requires infinite precision in setting up and\nmaintaining the system (Hodges 2005). For another, Kieu does not\nprovide a successful criterion for knowing when the system has\nevolved into the solution state, and the problem of determining when\nthe solution state is reached is Turing-uncomputable (Smith 2006b,\nHagar and Korolev 2007). Thus, operating Kieu\u2019s proposed hypercomputer\nwould require already possessing hypercomputational powers.\n\nIn conclusion, the candidate hypercomputers proposed so far have not\nbeen shown to be physically constructible and reliable. For the time\nbeing, Modest Physical CTT remains plausible. It may well be that, for\nall practical purposes, any function that is physically computable is\nTuring-computable.\n",
