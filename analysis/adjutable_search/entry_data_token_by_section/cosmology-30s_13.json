At almost the same time,\nde Sitter took on Milne in serious fashion (de Sitter 1934).\nResponding to Milne\u2019s methodological challenge, he showed that,\nindeed, it is possible to formulate relativistic cosmology in\naxiomatic fashion, just as Milne had formulated kinematic relativity\n\u201cfrom concepts.\u201d But de Sitter explicitly rejected\nMilne\u2019s philosophical use of the cosmological principle,\n\u201cwhich asserts that statistically the world pictures of two\ndifferent observers must be the same.\u201d His objection is founded\non the matter-of-fact that \u201cwe have, however, no means of\ncommunicating with other observers, situated on faraway stars, or\nmoving with excessive velocities\u201d (de Sitter 1934 p. 598). So\nmuch for rational principles as hypotheses!\n\nThe year in cosmology ended almost as confused as it had begun, with\none exception: Milne had gotten much clearer about his philosophical\nviews, and was applying them to an exhaustive presentation of his\ncosmology, theory and philosophy. His book Relativity, Gravitation\nand World Structure (Milne 1935) would be published in just a few\nmonths.\n",
