    "main_text": "Testing and Standards of Evidence || Testing adaptationism\n3.1 Testing adaptationism\n\n\n Orzack and Sober (1994a, 1994b, 1996,\n2001) (see also Orzack 2008) proposed an approach for testing\nempirical adaptationism. In their view, the truth of empirical\nadaptationism is a possible outcome of testing of optimality models, as\nopposed to being something that is decided a priori.\n\n\n Their proposal, the \u201cAdaptationism Project\u201d, involves\nassembling specific kinds of analyses of traits in order to assess the\nrelative frequency and importance of natural selection across the\nbiological realm. In order to contribute to the ensemble test, an\nanalysis must include an assessment of the quantitative fit of the\noptimality model and of the within-population heterogeneity of fit to\nthe predictions (see below and Orzack and Sober 1994a for why these\nassessments are required). At present, there are very few trait\nanalyses that contain these elements; after an extensive literature\nreview, Orzack and Sober identified only Brockmann and Dawkins (1979),\nBrockmann et al. (1979), Orzack and Parker (1990), and\nOrzack et al. (1991) as analyses that contain the required\nassessments.\n\n\n Of course, to conduct an ensemble test,\nimportant methodological difficulties must be confronted, including how\nto choose populations and species to analyze, and how many cases are\nnecessary to provide an adequate test. The name \u201cAdaptationism\nProject\u201d is an acknowledgement of a parallel to the \u201cHuman\nGenome Project\u201d; both are carried out by a consortium of\ninvestigators and require advance organization of the process by which\nknowledge is gathered (instead of just occurring willy-nilly).\nThis is an ambitious project but one that is achievable, cf., the\n\u201cGenome 10K\u201d project, which is also an effort to create an\nunprecedented data ensemble (Genome 10K 2009).\n\n\n Ensemble tests have a long\nprecedent in biology and evolutionary biology, although none appear to\nhave been prospectively organized. For example, we have the ensemble\nconclusion that \u201calmost all\u201d speciation occurs via\ngeographical isolation (Mayr 1963) or that the genetic code is\n\u201cnearly\u201d universal (Crick 1968). Either or both of these\nclaims could be true but the present empirical knowledge that generated\neither one is not even remotely close to being based on a sample of\norganisms that could be taken to be representative of all species.\n\n\n Empirical adaptationism is both\na claim about the relative frequency of natural selection across\nevolutionary histories and about the power of natural selection to\novercome constraints and contingency. Orzack and Sober's\n(1994a,b) ensemble test of the truth of empirical adaptationism is\nstructured in the following way for any given trait, T. In order to\ncontribute to the ensemble test, the analysis of the trait must allow\nthe investigator to confirm one of the following hypotheses about the\npower of natural selection:\n\n(U) Natural selection played some role in the evolution of T. (U\ndenotes ubiquitous since\nthis proposition applies to most traits.)\n\n\n(I) Natural selection was an important cause of the evolution of T.\n(I denotes important.)\n\n\n(O) Natural selection is a sufficient explanation of the evolution\nof T, and T is locally \noptimal. (O denotes optimal.)\n\n\n\n Orzack and Sober claimed that\nempirical adaptationism is a generalization of (O), namely that natural\nselection is a sufficient explanation for most (nonmolecular) traits\nand those traits are locally optimal.\n\n\n Orzack and Sober provided a specific\nprotocol to assess whether O is true for a particular trait. It\ninvolves comparing the predictive accuracy of a \u201ccensored\u201d\nevolutionary model, one that invokes only natural selection, and an\nalternative \u201cuncensored\u201d model that invokes additional\nevolutionary influences such as genetic drift (random trait change\ncaused by population number being finite), or constraints caused by the\nway the trait is determined genetically or developmentally. If\nthe censored model is quantitatively accurate and there is no\nwithin-population heterogeneity of fit to predictions and the\nuncensored model fails in either regard, then one can infer that\nnatural selection is a sufficient explanation for trait T.\nOptimality models embody proposition (O) in that natural selection is\nassumed to be the only important influence on the focal trait's\nevolution; the result is assumed to be the evolution of a trait that\nmaximizes individual fitness. Of course, an optimality model, like any\nevolutionary model, must include background assumptions and constraints\nthat anchor the \u201clocal\u201d analysis of the focal trait.\nHowever, given these assumptions, natural selection is assumed to act\nwithout constraint on the trait.\n\n\n There is some controversy over the\nprotocol for testing whether natural selection is a sufficient\nexplanation of a trait. Brandon and Rausher (1996) objected that\nlocal optimality is a distinct claim and so tests for the importance of\nnatural selection should not use optimality models, whose use they\nequate to \u201ctheft\u201d, which they believe means that such\nmodels are generically incompatible with universal aspects of the\nbiology of organisms. They also take issue with how the\npredictive accuracy of censored and uncensored models should be\nassessed. Godfrey-Smith (2001) makes the observation that the\ncensored and uncensored test models typically have different\ncomplexity. More complex models usually fit the data better, but\nrisk obscuring the underlying trend or comprising predictive\naccuracy\u2014there may be a problem of over-fitting lurking here\n(see, e.g., Gauch 2003 for an overview of the curve-fitting\nproblem).\n\n\n Extending this framework to molecular\ntraits, where completely neutral evolution is a plausible explanation,\nrequires expanding the set of hypotheses about natural selection.\nIt now should include:\n\n\n(N) Natural selection played no role in evolution of T. (N\ndenotes neutral.)\n\n\n\n\nSome argue that N is rarely, if ever, true (e.g., Gillespie 1991),\nwhereas others argue otherwise (e.g., Kimura 1983, Lynch 2007a).\nAn ensemble test involving molecular traits would help resolve this\ncontroversy. In addition, the notion of optimality at the\nmolecular level must be made precise. A molecular trait needs to have\nan identified phenotypic consequence. The endeavor to identify such a\nconsequence will likely always involve a combination of very detailed\nmolecular, biochemical, and phenotypic analyses. However, despite the\ndifficulty of the needed analyses, there are claims as to the\noptimality of various molecular traits. A canonical example is the\nclaim that triosephosphate isomerase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis\nin animals, fungi, plants, and some bacteria, is catalytically\n\u201cperfect\u201d (Albery and Knowles 1976); this is a claim that\nhypothesis O is true. For molecular traits, the assessment of the\ninfluence of natural selection, i.e., distinguishing between hypothesis\nN and hypotheses U and I, is facilitated by the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code and the existence of non-coding regions in the genome. We\nexpect heterogeneity of the realized influence of natural selection\namong sites in the genome, and differences in evolutionary rates\nbetween sites where a DNA base change alters the protein sequence and\nthose sites that it does not (see examples in Graur and Li 2000,\nKreitman and Akashi 1995, Nielsen 2005, and Yang 2006).\n",
