    "main_text": "Speculative Physics\n3. Speculative Physics\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s RSS may be taken as representative of Oxford\nCalculators\u2019 speculative/mathematical physics. It links\ninterests in logic, mathematics, and physics. As Curtis Wilson says:\n\u201cHeytesbury employs the concept of \u201climit\u201d and\n\u201cinfinite aggregate\u201d with considerable precision and\nsubtlety; and in treating of variable physics quantities, he\napproaches the ideal of a purely mathematical description\u201d\n(Wilson 1960: 3). Not only does Heytesbury analyze physical and\nmathematical problems by means of the techniques of the logica\nmoderna, but he also employs physical and mathematical rules in\nthe analyses of logical or semantic problems of denomination.\nHeytesbury is mostly interested in the problem of determining under\nwhat conditions a subject can be denominated such-and-such, e.g.,\n\u201cwhite\u201d or \u201crunning\u201d. The issue of\ndenomination arises because the attributes of subjects vary in degrees\nof intensity or completeness. He establishes sets of rules of everyday\nspeech, determining how we denominate a subject under all imaginable\ncircumstances of change. For example, in the sophism Omnis homo\nqui est albus currit, he concludes that a man is called to be\n\u201cwhite\u201d if and only if the external surface of the upper\nhalf of him is white (in everyday speech, a man is white if the skin\non his face is white) (Wilson 1960: 22\u201323).\n\nLike one of the founders of the School of Oxford\nCalculators\u2014Richard Kilvington\u2013 Heytesbury takes\nOckham\u2019s nominalist position and affirms that the real physical\nworld consists only of res absolutae, i.e., substances and\nqualities. They both acknowledge that terms such as\n\u201cpoint\u201d, \u201cline\u201d, \u201clatitude\u201d, and\n\u201cdegree\u201d do not have any representation in reality, but\nare useful for describing different types of change. They also hold\nthat time is not real since time is not distinguished\nrealiter from the motion of celestial spheres, and motion is\nnot distinguished realiter from the body which moves. Thus,\nthey both contrast things that are really distinct with things\ndistinguishable only in reason, i.e., in the imagination. Heytesbury\nfollows Kilvington\u2019s frequent use of the phrase secundum\nimaginationem to describe hypothetical situations in which the\nelements of the description, and not the situation itself, are of\nprimary concern. The only requirement for an imaginable case is that\nit should not involve a formal logical contradiction; whether it is\nphysically possible or not is a matter of indifference. As Wilson\nsays,\n\n\na distinction is drawn between realiter or\nnaturaliter or physice loquendo and logice\nor sophistice loquendo: physice we follow experience\nand the principles laid down in the natural philosophy of Aristotle;\nlogice or sophistice we are free to introduce\nwhatever distinctions and cases are convenient and imaginable. (Wilson\n1960: 25)\n\n\nHeytesbury, however, remains in the framework of Aristotelian\nphilosophy of nature, and the problems he discusses are to be found in\nAristotle\u2019s Physica and De caelo.\nNevertheless, Heytesbury is captivated by the mathematical approach es\nthe earlier Oxford Calculators. Like Thomas Bradwardine and Richard\nKilvington, he examines physical problems using mathematical\napparatus. In Chapters 4\u20136 of the Regulae, Heytesbury\ndevelops measurement by limit, i.e., by the first and last instants of\nbeginning and ending, and by the intrinsic and extrinsic limits of\npassive and active capacities. Although these types of\n\u201cmeasuring\u201d do not appear to be straightforwardly\nmathematical, they provide the basis for mathematical considerations\nand give excellent results in analyses of the instantaneous motion, as\nwell as continua. As Wilson states:\n\n\nHeytesbury admits \u201caccording to the common mode of speech\u201d\nthat everything which is, whether time or motion or instant, is in an\ninstant, in the sense that it is instantaneously measured by an\ninstant [\u2026] the instant in time and the instantaneous position\nin movement are always to be regarded as \u201climits\u201d. (Wilson\n1960: 41)\n\n\nThe second type of measurement employs a new calculus of compounding\nratios. The third type of measurement, by latitude of forms, describes\nmotion, in which an accidental form, such as speed, is intensified or\ndiminished. Heytesbury focuses on establishing the rules for the\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d of speed in every type of the continuous\nchanges enumerated by Aristotle, i.e., in local motion, in\naugmentation, and in alteration.\n",
