    "main_text": "Issues || Probability\n5. Impact\n\nIn 1967 John Passmore reported that: \u201cLogical positivism, then,\nis dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes.\u201d\n(1967, 57) Earlier in the same article he had equated logical\npositivism with logical empiricism, so presumably that was dead too.\nAt that time few would have disagreed with Passmore, even though\nCarnap was still alive and active. But in speaking of this movement\nPassmore was referring not to a movement but to specific doctrines,\nand his interpretation of them was much influenced by Ayer. Even so,\nPassmore conceded that the movement had left a legacy and that\n\u201cthe spirit which inspired the Vienna circle\u201d persisted.\nIt still does.\n\nPart of the movement\u2019s legacy lies in contemporary philosophy of\nscience. In the US nearly all philosophers of science can trace their\nacademic lineages to Reichenbach. Most were either his students or\nstudents of his students and so on. His scientific realism inspired a\ngeneration of philosophers, even those clearly outside the movement.\nEven the reaction against various forms of realism that have appeared\nin recent decades have roots in the logical empiricist movement.\nMoreover, philosophers of science are expected to know a great deal of\nthe science about which they philosophize and to be cautious in\ntelling practicing scientists what concepts they may or may not use.\nIn these respects and others contemporary philosophers promote a kind\nof naturalism, and by so doing they follow both the precept and the\nexample of the logical empiricists.\n\nThere are other issues where the legacy of logical empiricism is still\nvisible. Two different approaches to probability are still under\ndiscussion. One of them explores the objective chances of external\nevents; this investigation follows in the tradition of the frequency\ntheory of Reichenbach and von Mises. The second approach has an\nepistemic conception of probability as exemplified by Carnap. S.L.\nZabell summarizes the current situation as follows:\n\nBut although the technical contributions of Carnap and his school\nremain of considerable interest today, Carnap\u2019s most lasting\ninfluence was more subtle but also more important: he largely shaped\nthe way current philosophy views the nature and role of probability,\nin particular its widespread acceptance of the Bayesian paradigm (as,\nfor example, in Earman, 1992; Howson and Urbach, 1993; and Jeffrey,\n2004). (Zabell 2007, 294)\n\n\nThere is also a continuing concern for how the various sciences fit\ntogether. Some have scouted theoretical unification and others a more\npluralistic model, just as the logical empiricists did. There was for\na while a vogue for the disunity of science. Some even said that their\nconception of the disunity of science is just what Neurath meant by\nthe unity of science. Parts of the discussion were intended as\nchallenges to logical empiricism, but often the arguments used were\npioneered by the logical empiricists themselves.\n\nFor the 30 years after Passmore\u2019s report metaphysics became ever\nmore visible in philosophy. It was a diverse development, but in the\nself-conceptions of many of its most prominent practitioners there was\nno attempt to shun science or logic or to think that metaphysics had\naccess to facts that were deeper than or beyond those that a proper\nscience could reach. So the metaphysics that blossomed was not\nnecessarily of the sort that Carnap, Neurath, Reichenbach, and others\ncombated. Finally, in contemporary meta-philosophy variously logical\nempiricist ideas on ontology (Blatti and Lapointe 2016), explication\n(Kitcher 2008, and Carus 2007), and philosophy as conceptual\nengineering (Creath 1990, Chalmers 2020, and Haslanger 2000) continue\nto be of interest.\n\nEven in its heyday many philosophers who on either doctrinal or\nsociological grounds can be grouped with the logical empiricists did\nnot see themselves that way. We should not expect philosophers today\nto identify with the movement either. Each generation finds its place\nby emphasizing its differences from what has gone before. But the\nspirit of the movement still has its adherents. There are many who\nvalue clarity and who want to understand the methodology of science,\nits structure, and its prospects. There are many who want to find a\nnatural home within a broad conception of science for conceptual\ninnovation, for logic and mathematics, and for their own study of\nmethodology. And importantly there are those who see in science a\nprospect for intellectual and social reform and who see in their own\nstudy of science some hope for freeing us all from the merely habitual\nways of thinking \u201cby which we are now possessed\u201d (Kuhn\n1962, 1). These are the motives that define the movement called\nlogical empiricism. As Twain might have said, the reports of its death\nare greatly exaggerated.\n",
