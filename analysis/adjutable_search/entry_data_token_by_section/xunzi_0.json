    "main_text": "Xunzi and Xunzi\n1. Xunzi and Xunzi\n\nThe name Xunzi means Master Xun and refers to Xun Kuang\n\u8340\u6cc1, who was renowned in his day as \u201cthe most\nrevered of teachers\u201d (zui wei laoshi\n\u6700\u7232\u8001\u5e2b). His precise dates are unknown, and\nextant sources contradict one another: in particular, there is\ndisagreement as to whether he journeyed to the philosophical center of\nQi \u9f4a at the age of fifteen sui \u6b72 (i.e. thirteen\nor fourteen years of age) or fifty sui (forty-eight or\nforty-nine). The former figure is more plausible (Goldin 1999:\n110n.13; Knoblock 1982\u201383: 33\u201334), and would indicate a\nyear of birth sometime around 310 BCE All we can surmise of his death\nis that it must have been after 238 BCE, because he was alive when his\npatron, Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, was assassinated in\nthat year. Virtually all available information about his life comes\neither from internal references in Xunzi, the posthumously\nedited collection of his works, or from his biography in Records\nof the Historian \u53f2\u8a18, by Sima Qian\n\u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (145?\u201386? BCE), which is known to\ncontain serious distortions, especially in its treatment of famous\nphilosophers (Kern 2015). Hence modern attempts to piece together Xun\nKuang\u2019s life (such as Knoblock 1988\u201394: I, 3\u201335; and\nLiao Mingchun 2005: 535\u201346) are necessarily tentative.\n\nSima Qian relates that Xunzi polished his voluminous writings in his\nold age, but they do not survive in his own recension. All extant\neditions of Xunzi derive from a compilation by Liu Xiang\n\u5289\u5411 (79\u20138 BCE), a palace librarian who located 322\nbamboo bundles of text (pian \u7bc7) that he confidently\nattributed to Xunzi, of which he eliminated 290 as duplicates. These\nhigh numbers suggest that Xunzi\u2019s essays had been circulating\nindependently for about two centuries (Sato 2003: 27\u201336). The\ngeneral consensus today is that Xunzi is a collection of\npredominantly authentic essays, but certainly not organized in a\nmanner that Xun Kuang himself had authorized (e.g., Knoblock\n1988\u201394: I, 105\u201328). One indication of the diversity of\nLiu Xiang\u2019s sources is that a few chapters (notably \u201cA\nDebate about Warfare\u201d [\u201cYibing\u201d \u8b70\u5175])\nrefer to Xunzi as Sun Qingzi \u5b6b\u537f\u5b50, \u201cMaster\nChamberlain Sun\u201d, a title that he himself would not have\n used.[1]\n The chapter divisions, in particular, seem unreliable: whereas some\nchapters read like self-standing essays, others do not. In\n\u201cRefutation of Physiognomy\u201d (\u201cFeixiang\u201d\n\u975e\u76f8), for example, only the opening lines deal with\nphysiognomy; the rest of the chapter seems to consist of stray\npassages that Liu Xiang did not quite know where to insert. There are\nalso some chapters with generic instructional material, as well as\npoems and rhymed riddles that are rarely studied (Knechtges 1989). One\nof the consequences of this arrangement is that reconstructing\nXunzi\u2019s arguments requires reading across chapter boundaries:\ntaken as a whole, the book conveys a distinctive philosophical\nposition, but individual chapters are inadequate, indeed sometimes\nincoherent, on their own (Kern 2016; Hutton 2014:\nxviii\u2013xxiii).\n",
