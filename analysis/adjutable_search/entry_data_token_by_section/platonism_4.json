    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Mathematical Objects\n4.1 Mathematical Objects\n\nPlatonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems of our\nmathematical theories \u2014 sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019\n(a theorem of arithmetic) and \u2018There are infinitely many\ntransfinite cardinal numbers\u2019 (a theorem of set theory) \u2014\nare literally true and that the only plausible view of such sentences\nis that they are about abstract objects (i.e., that their singular\nterms denote abstract objects and their existential quantifiers range\nover abstract objects). This general stance toward mathematics goes\nback to Plato, but the first clear statement of the argument in this\nform was given by Frege (1884); other advocates include Quine (see his\n1948 and 1951, though he doesn't explicitly state the argument there),\nG\u00f6del (1964), Parsons (1965, 1971, 1994), Putnam (1971), Steiner\n(1975), Resnik (1981, 1997), Zalta (1983, 1999), Wright (1983),\nBurgess (1983), Hale (1987), Shapiro (1989, 1997), the early Maddy\n (1990),[4]\n Katz (1998), Colyvan (2001), McEvoy (2005, 2012), and Marcus\n(2015).\n\nLet's begin our discussion of the platonists' argument here by\nconsidering their reasons for thinking that we have to take sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 to be about abstract objects rather than\nmental or physical objects of some kind. And let's start with a\ndiscussion of the psychologistic view that mathematics is about mental\nobjects.\n\nFrege (1884, introduction and section 27; 1893\u20131903,\nintroduction; 1894; and 1919) gave several compelling arguments\nagainst psychologism. First, it seems that psychologism is incapable\nof accounting for the truth of sentences that are about all\nnatural numbers, because there are infinitely many natural numbers and\nclearly, there could not be infinitely many number-ideas in human\nminds. Second, psychologism seems to entail that sentences about very\nlarge numbers (in particular, numbers that no one has ever had a\nthought about) are not true; for if none of us has ever had a thought\nabout some very large number, then psychologism entails that there is\nno such number and, hence, that no sentence about that number could be\ntrue. Third, psychologism turns mathematics into a branch of\npsychology, and it makes mathematical truths contingent upon\npsychological truths, so that, for instance, if we all died, \u20184\nis greater than 2\u2019 would suddenly become untrue. But this seems\nwrong: it seems that mathematics is true independently of us; that is,\nit seems that the question of whether 4 is greater than 2 has nothing\nat all to do with the question of how many humans are alive. Fourth\nand finally, psychologism suggests that the proper methodology for\nmathematics is that of empirical psychology; that is, it seems that if\npsychologism were true, then the proper way to discover whether, say,\nthere is a prime number between 10,000,000 and 10,000,020, would be to\ndo an empirical study of humans and ascertain whether there is, in\nfact, an idea of such a number in one of our heads; but of course,\nthis is not the proper methodology for mathematics. As Frege says\n(1884, section 27), \u201cWeird and wonderful\u2026are the results\nof taking seriously the suggestion that number is an idea.\u201d\n\nPlatonists do not deny that we have ideas of mathematical objects.\nWhat they deny is that our mathematical sentences are about\nthese ideas. Thus, the dispute between platonism and psychologism is\nprimarily a semantic one. Advocates of psychologism agree with\nplatonists that in the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019,\n\u20183\u2019 functions as a singular term (i.e., as a denoting\nexpression). But they disagree about the referent of this expression.\nThey think that \u20183\u2019 refers to a mental object, in\nparticular, an idea in our heads. It is this semantic thesis\nthat platonists reject and that the above Fregean arguments are\nsupposed to refute. More specifically, they're supposed to show that\nthe psychologistic semantics of mathematical discourse is not correct\nbecause it has consequences that fly in the face of the actual usage\nof mathematical language.\n\nAnother argument for the superiority of the platonist semantics of\nmathematical discourse over the psychologist semantics is based on the\nfact that in ordinary usage, one way to say that something doesn't\nexist is to say that \u201cit exists only in your\n head\u201d.[5]\n To say that mathematical objects exist only in our heads, it seems,\nis just to say that they don't exist. For to say that they (as opposed\nto our ideas of them) exist is to say that they exist independently of\nus and our thinking. Quine put this point in a very compelling way in\nconnection with a conceptualistic view of mythical objects like\nPegasus. He writes (1948, p. 2):\n\nMcX [who maintains that Pegasus exists and is an idea in our heads]\nnever confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon-idea. The Parthenon is\nphysical; the Parthenon-idea is mental\u2026We cannot easily imagine\ntwo things more unlike\u2026But when we shift from the Parthenon to\nPegasus, the confusion sets in \u2014 for no other reason than that\nMcX would sooner be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant\ncounterfeit than grant the nonbeing of Pegasus.\n\n\nThe same argument can be run against the psychologistic conflation of\n3-ideas with 3: you might doubt that there really is such a thing as\nthe number 3, existing objectively and independently of us, but you\nshould not for that reason claim that your idea of 3 is 3,\nfor that is just a confusion \u2014 it is like saying that your idea\nof Pegasus is Pegasus, or that your idea of the Parthenon is\nthe Parthenon.\n\nLet us move on now to immanent-realist, or physicalist, views of\nmathematics, and let us concentrate first on views like Mill's (1843,\nbook II, chapters 5 and 6), i.e., views that maintain that sentences\nabout numbers are really just general claims about bunches of ordinary\nobjects. On this view, the sentence \u20182 + 1 = 3\u2019, for\ninstance, isn't really about specific objects (the numbers 1, 2, and\n3). Rather, it says that whenever we add one object to a pile of two\nobjects, we will get a pile of three objects. Now, in order to account\nfor contemporary mathematics in this way, a contemporary Millian would\nhave to take set theory to be about ordinary objects as well. This,\nhowever, is untenable. One argument here is that set theory could not\nbe about bunches of ordinary objects, or piles of physical stuff,\nbecause corresponding to every physical pile, there are many, many\nsets. Corresponding to a ball, for instance, is the set containing the\nball, the set containing its molecules, the set containing its atoms,\nand so on. (And we know that these are different sets, because they\nhave different members, and it follows from set theory that if set\nA and set B have different members, then A\nis not identical to B.) Indeed, the principles of set theory\nentail that corresponding to every physical object, there is a huge\ninfinity of sets. Corresponding to our ball, for instance, there is\nthe set containing the ball, the set containing that set, the set\ncontaining that set, and so on; and there is the set\ncontaining the ball and the set containing the set containing the\nball; and so on and on and on. Clearly, these sets are not just piles\nof physical stuff, because (a) there are infinitely many of them\n(again, this follows from the principles of set theory) and (b) all of\nthese infinitely many sets share the same physical base. Thus, it\nseems that claims about sets are not claims about bunches of ordinary\nobjects, or even generalized claims about such bunches. They are\nclaims about sets, which are objects of a different kind.\n\nAnother problem with physicalistic views along the lines of Mill's is\nthat they seem incapable of accounting for the sheer size of the\ninfinities involved in set theory. Standard set theory entails not\njust that there are infinitely large sets, but that there are\ninfinitely many sizes of infinity, which get larger and larger with no\nend, and that there actually exist sets of all of these different\nsizes of infinity. There is simply no plausible way to take this\ntheory to be about physical stuff.\n\n(These arguments do not refute the kind of immanent realism defended\nby the early Maddy (1990). On Maddy's view, sets of physical objects\nare located in spacetime, right where their members are. Thus, if you\nhave two eggs in your hand, then you also have the set containing\nthose eggs in your hand. Maddy's view has no problem accounting for\nthe massive infinities in mathematics, for on her view, corresponding\nto every physical object, there is a huge infinity of sets that exist\nin space and time, right where the given physical object exists. Given\nthis, it should be clear that while Maddy's view says that sets exist\nin spacetime, it cannot be thought of as saying that sets are physical\nobjects. So Maddy's view is not a physicalist view in the sense that's\nrelevant here (as was pointed out above, it is better thought of as a\nnon-standard version of platonism). Thus, in the present context\n(i.e., the context in which platonists are trying to undermine views\nthat take mathematical objects to be physical objects), platonists do\nnot need to argue against Maddy's view. Of course, in the end, if they\nwant to motivate the standard version of platonism, then they'll have\nto give reasons for preferring their view to Maddy's non-standard\nversion of platonism, and this might prove hard to do. For some\narguments against Maddy's early view, see, e.g., Lavine (1992),\nDieterle and Shapiro (1993), Balaguer (1998a), Milne (1994), Riskin\n(1994), Carson (1996), and the later Maddy (1997).)\n\nIf arguments like the ones we've been discussing here are cogent, then\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are not about physical or\nmental objects, and therefore, psychologism and immanent realism are\nnot tenable views of mathematics. But that is not the end of the\nsingular term argument for the existence of abstract mathematical\nobjects, for we still need to consider nominalistic views of sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019. In order for platonists to establish\ntheir view, they need to refute these nominalistic views as well as\npsychologistic and physicalistic views. And it should be noted that\nthis is the hard part. There is a good deal of agreement among\nphilosophers of mathematics that psychologism and immanent realism are\nuntenable; that is, most philosophers of mathematics are either\nplatonists or nominalists; but there is very little agreement as to\nwhether platonism or nominalism is correct.\n\nHow can nominalists proceed in developing an account of sentences like\n\u20183 is prime\u2019? One strategy is to reject premise (1) and\nthe standard criterion of ontological commitment discussed above. The\nmost obvious way to do this is to endorse the following view: (a)\nsimple mathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 should be\nread as being of the form \u2018a is F' and as\nbeing about abstract objects (e.g., \u20183\u2019 should be taken as\ndenoting the number 3, which could only be an abstract object, and\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 should be taken as being a claim about that\nobject); and (b) abstract objects \u2014 in particular, mathematical\nobjects like the number 3 \u2014 don\u2019t exist (and the claim\nhere is that they don\u2019t have any sort of being whatsoever, so\nthis is not a Meinongian view); but (c) sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 are still literally true. Thus, on this view, a claim\nabout an object a can be true even if that object\ndoesn\u2019t exist at all. Let\u2019s call this view\nthin-truth-ism. Views of this general kind have been endorsed\nby Azzouni (1994, 2004), Salmon (1998), and Bueno (2005). \n\nThin-truth-ists endorse a similar view of existence claims. For\ninstance, on their view, the sentence \u2018There are infinitely many\nprime numbers\u2019 is literally true, even though there are no such\nthings as numbers. This might look like a contradiction, but it's not,\nbecause according to thin-truth-ism, existential expressions (or\nquantifiers) like 'there is' are ambiguous.\n\nMost philosophers find this view extremely hard to believe. Indeed, a\nlot of philosophers would say that it is simply confused, or\nincoherent. But, in fact, thin-truth-ism is not incoherent. A better\nway to formulate the problem with the view is as follows: in giving up\non the standard criterion of ontological commitment, thin-truth-ists\nseem to be using \u2018true\u2019 in a non-standard way. Most of us\nwould say that if there is no such thing as the number 3, and if\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 is read at face value (i.e., as being about\nthe number 3), then it follows trivially that \u20183 is prime\u2019\ncould not be true. Or more generally, most of us would say that if\nthere is no such thing as the object a, then sentences of the\nform \u2018a is F\u2019 cannot be literally true.\nThis, of course, is just to say that most of us accept the standard\ncriterion of ontological commitment discussed above, but the point\nhere is that this criterion seems to be built into the standard\nmeaning of words like \u2018true\u2019. Indeed, this explains why\nthe standard criterion of ontological commitment is so widely\naccepted.\n\nAnother worry one might raise about thin-truth-ism is that it only\ndiffers from fictionalism in a merely verbal way. Let\n\u2018thin-true\u2019 express the kind of truth that thin-truth-ists\nhave in mind, and let \u2018thick-true\u2019 express the kind of\ntruth that everyone else in the debate has in mind (i.e., platonists,\nfictionalists, paraphrase nominalists, and so on). Given this,\nfictionalists and thin-truth-ists will both endorse all of the\nfollowing claims: (a) platonists are right that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 is a claim about the number 3; and (b) there is no such\nthing as the number 3; so (c) \u20183 is prime\u2019 isn\u2019t\nthick-true; but despite this, (d) \u20183 is prime\u2019 is\nthin-true. Now, of course, thin-truth-ists and fictionalists will\ndisagree about whether \u20183 is prime\u2019 is true, but\nthis will collapse into a disagreement about whether thin-truth or\nthick-truth is real truth, and this is just a disagreement\nabout what the word \u2018true\u2019 means in ordinary folk English,\nand it\u2019s hard to see why an empirical question about how the\nfolk happen to use some word is relevant to the debate about the\nexistence of mathematical objects.\n\nIn any event, if we reject thin-truth-ism \u2014 i.e., if we accept\npremise (1) and the standard criterion of ontological commitment\n\u2014 then there are two general strategies that nominalists can\nadopt in giving a view of mathematical sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019. First, they can endorse a paraphrase view, and second,\nthey can endorse a fictionalist view. Those who endorse paraphrase\nviews claim that while sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are\ntrue, they should not be read as platonists read them, because we can\nparaphrase these sentences with other sentences that do not commit us\nto the existence of abstract objects. One view of this sort, known as\nif-thenism, holds that \u20183 is prime\u2019 can be\nparaphrased by \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would be\nprime\u2019 (for an early version of this sort of view, see the early\nHilbert (1899 and his letters to Frege in Frege (1980)); for later\nversions, see Putnam (1967a and 1967b) and Hellman (1989)). A second\nversion of the paraphrase strategy, which we can call\nmetamathematical formalism (see Curry (1951)), is that\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 can be paraphrased by \u201c\u20183 is\nprime\u2019 follows from the axioms of\n arithmetic\u201d.[6]\n A third version, developed by Chihara (1990), is that mathematical\nsentences that seem to make claims about what mathematical objects\nexist \u2014 e.g., \u2018There is a prime number between 2 and\n4\u2019 \u2014 can be paraphrased into sentences about what it's\npossible for us to do (in particular, what it's possible for us to\nwrite down). Others to endorse paraphrase views include Hofweber\n(2005), Rayo (2008), Moltmann (2013), and Yi (2002).\n\nOne problem with the various paraphrase views (not to put too fine a\npoint on it) is that none of the paraphrases seems very good. That is,\nthe paraphrases seem to misrepresent what we actually mean when we say\nthings like \u20183 is prime\u2019 (and by \u2018we\u2019, I mean\nboth mathematicians and ordinary folk). What we mean, it seems, is\nthat 3 is prime \u2014 not that if there were numbers, then 3 would\nbe prime, or that the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019 follows from\nthe axioms of arithmetic, or any such thing. And notice how the\nsituation here differs from cases where we do seem to have good\nparaphrases. For instance, one might try to claim that if we endorse\nthe sentence\n\n(A1) The average accountant has two children,\n\n\nthen we are ontologically committed to the existence of the average\naccountant; but it is plausible to suppose that, in fact, we are not\nso committed, because (A1) can be paraphrased by the sentence\n\n(A2) On average, accountants have two children.\n\n\nMoreover, it seems plausible to maintain that this is a good\nparaphrase of (A1), because it seems clear that when people say things\nlike (A1), what they really mean are things like (A2). But in\nthe present case, this seems wrong: it does not seem plausible to\nsuppose that when people say \u20183 is prime\u2019, what they\nreally mean is \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would be\nprime\u2019. Again, it seems that what we mean here is, very simply,\nthat 3 is prime. In short, when people say things like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019, they do not usually have any intention to be saying\nanything other than what these sentences seem to say; and\nbecause of this, it seems that the platonist's face-value semantics\nfor mathematical discourse is correct.\n\nSome paraphrase nominalists (e.g., Chihara 1990, 2004) maintain that\nit doesn't matter what we really mean, that paraphrase\nnominalists aren't committed to the thesis that their paraphrases\ncapture the real ordinary-language meanings of our mathematical\nsentences. But this is false. If paraphrase nominalists admit that\nplatonists are right about the ordinary-language meanings of\nmathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019, then their view\nwill collapse into a fictionalist view, according to which sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 are not literally true. For since\nparaphrase nominalists don't believe in the existence of mathematical\nobjects, if they admit that ordinary utterances of \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 are best interpreted as being about mathematical objects,\nor purporting to be about such objects, then they will have to admit\nthat such sentences are literally untrue, as fictionalists maintain.\nThus, if the paraphrase nominalist view is going to be a genuine\nalternative to fictionalism, it has to involve the thesis that the\nparaphrases that nominalists are offering capture the real meanings of\nordinary mathematical sentences.\n\nOn the other hand, paraphrase nominalists might try to argue that they\nare right about the ordinary-language meanings of sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019, even though this is not obvious or\ntransparent to ordinary speakers. This stance, however, would be\nextremely controversial and difficult to motivate.\n\nOne paraphrase view that has become somewhat popular recently holds\nthat sentences that seem to be about numbers are best read as being\nabout plurals. For instance, we might read \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 as\nreally saying something like this: two and two are four (or\ntwo objects and two (more) objects are four objects, or some\nsuch thing). Views of this general kind have been endorsed or defended\nby, e.g., Yi (2002, forthcoming), Hofweber (2005), and Moltmann\n(2013). This view fits better with ordinary usage than some of the\nother paraphrase-nominalist views, and for sentences like \u20182 + 2\n= 4\u2019 they can seem plausible. But when we switch to sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 \u2014 and, even worse, \u2018There\nare infinitely many primes\u2019 \u2014 they can start to seem\ncumbersome and less plausible.\n\n(For a good in-depth discussion and critique of some of the\nparaphrase-nominalist views, see Burgess and Rosen (1997).)\n\nLet's move on now to a discussion of fictionalism, which is the last\noption for nominalists. Unlike paraphrase nominalists, fictionalists\nadmit that the platonist's face-value semantics for mathematical\ndiscourse is correct; but because fictionalists don't believe in\nabstract objects, they think that mathematical sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 are not true. In other words, fictionalists maintain\nthat (a) platonists are right that sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 do purport to be about abstract objects, but (b) there\nare no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) these sentences\n\u2014 and, indeed, our mathematical theories \u2014 are untrue.\nThus, on this view, just as Alice in Wonderland is not true\nbecause there are no such things as talking rabbits, hookah-smoking\ncaterpillars, and so on, so too our mathematical theories are not true\nbecause there are no such things as numbers and sets and so\n on.[7].\n (Fictionalism has been developed by Field (1980, 1989, 1998),\nBalaguer (1998a, 2009), Rosen (2001), and Leng (2005a, 2005b, 2010).\nOne might also interpret Melia (2000), Yablo (2002a, 2002b, 2005), and\nBueno (2009) as fictionalists. Finally, Hoffman (2004) endorses a kind\nof fictionalism, but her view is very different from the one under\ndiscussion here; for a bit more on her view, see the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nThere are a few different ways that platonists might try to argue\nagainst fictionalism. The most famous and widely discussed argument\nagainst fictionalism is the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument (see Quine (1948, 1951), Putnam (1971, 2012), and\nColyvan (2001)). This argument (or at any rate, one version of it)\nproceeds as follows: it cannot be that mathematics is untrue, as\nfictionalists suggest, because (a) mathematics is an indispensable\npart of our physical theories (e.g., quantum mechanics, general\nrelativity theory, evolutionary theory, and so on) and so (b) if we\nwant to maintain that our physical theories are true (and surely we do\n\u2014 we don't want our disbelief in abstract objects to force us to\nbe anti-realists about natural science), then we have to maintain that\nour mathematical theories are true.\n\nFictionalists have developed two different responses to the\nQuine-Putnam argument. The first, developed by Field (1980) and\nBalaguer (1998a), is based on the claim that mathematics is, in fact,\nnot indispensable to empirical science \u2014 i.e., that our\nempirical theories can be nominalized, or reformulated in a\nway that avoids reference to abstract objects. The second response,\ndeveloped by Balaguer (1998a), Rosen (2001), Yablo (2005), Bueno\n(2009), Leng (2010), and perhaps Melia (2000), is to grant the\nindispensability of mathematics to empirical science and to simply\naccount for the relevant applications from a fictionalist point of\nview. (A counterresponse to this second response has been given by\nColyvan (2002) and Baker (2005, 2009), who argue that fictionalists\ncan\u2019t account for the explanatory role that mathematics\nplays in science; responses to the explanatory version of the\nindispensability argument have been given by Melia (2002), Leng\n(2005b), Bangu (2008), and Daly and Langford (2009).)\n\nThere is no consensus on whether the fictionalist responses to the\nQuine-Putnam argument are successful. But even if they are, there are\nother objections that platonists might raise against fictionalism. For\ninstance, one might argue that fictionalists cannot account for the\nobjectivity of mathematics (for responses to this, see Field\n(1980, 1989, 1998) and Balaguer (2009)). Or, second, one might argue\nthat fictionalism is not a nominalistically acceptable view because\nformulations of it invariably involve tacit reference to various kinds\nof abstract objects, such as sentence types, or stories, or possible\nworlds (for responses to this, see Field (1989), Balaguer (1998a), and\nRosen (2001)). For other objections to fictionalism, see, e.g.,\nMalament (1982), Shapiro (1983a), Resnik (1985), Chihara (1990,\nchapter 8, section 5), Horwich (1991), O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1997),\nBurgess and Rosen (1997), Katz (1998), Thomas (2000, 2002), Stanley\n(2002), Bueno (2003), Szabo (2003), Hoffman (2004), and Burgess\n(2004). For responses to these objections, see the various\nfictionalist works cited above, as well as Daly (2008) and Liggins\n(2010). And for a discussion of all these objections, as well as\nfictionalist responses to them, see the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nIn the end, it's not obvious whether platonists can successfully\nrefute fictionalism, and more generally, it's not obvious whether the\nversion of the singular term argument rehearsed in this subsection\nprovides a good reason for believing in abstract mathematical\nobjects.\n",
