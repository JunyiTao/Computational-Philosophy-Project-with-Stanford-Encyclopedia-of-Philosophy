    "main_text": "The \u201cscience\u201d of pseudoscience\n2. The \u201cscience\u201d of pseudoscience\n\nThe Latin word \u201cpseudoscientia\u201d was used already in the\nfirst half of the 17th century in discussions about the relationship\nbetween religion and empirical investigations (Guldentops 2020,\n288n). The oldest known use of the English word\n\u201cpseudoscience\u201d dates from 1796, when the historian James\nPettit Andrew referred to alchemy as a \u201cfantastical\npseudo-science\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary). The word has been\nin frequent use since the 1880s (Thurs and Numbers 2013). Throughout\nits history the word has had a clearly defamatory meaning (Laudan\n1983, 119; Dolby 1987, 204). It would be as strange for someone to\nproudly describe her own activities as pseudoscience as to boast that\nthey are bad science. Since the derogatory connotation is an essential\ncharacteristic of the word \u201cpseudoscience\u201d, an attempt to\nextricate a value-free definition of the term would not be\nmeaningful. An essentially value-laden term has to be defined in\nvalue-laden terms. This is often difficult since the specification of\nthe value component tends to be controversial.\n\nThis problem is not specific to pseudoscience, but follows directly\nfrom a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous problem with the concept\nof science. The common usage of the term \u201cscience\u201d can be\ndescribed as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity is\nrecognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it\nhas a positive role in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand,\nthe concept of science has been formed through a historical process,\nand many contingencies influence what we call and do not call\nscience. Whether we call a claim, doctrine, or discipline\n\u201cscientific\u201d depends both on its subject area and its\nepistemic qualities. The former part of the delimitation is largely\nconventional, whereas the latter is highly normative, and closely\nconnected with fundamental epistemological and metaphysical\nissues.\n\nAgainst this background, in order not to be unduly complex a\ndefinition of science has to go in either of two directions. It can\nfocus on the descriptive contents, and specify how the term is\nactually used. Alternatively, it can focus on the normative element,\nand clarify the more fundamental meaning of the term. The latter\napproach has been the choice of most philosophers writing on the\nsubject, and will be at focus here. It involves, of necessity, some\ndegree of idealization in relation to common usage of the term\n\u201cscience\u201d, in particular concerning the delimitation of\nthe subject-area of science.\n\nThe English word \u201cscience\u201d is primarily used about the\nnatural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to\nbe similar to them. Hence, political economy and sociology are counted\nas sciences, whereas studies of literature and history are usually\nnot. The corresponding German word, \u201cWissenschaft\u201d, has a\nmuch broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties,\nincluding the humanities. The German term has the advantage of more\nadequately delimiting the type of systematic knowledge that is at\nstake in the conflict between science and pseudoscience. The\nmisrepresentations of history presented by Holocaust deniers and other\npseudo-historians are very similar in nature to the misrepresentations\nof natural science promoted by creationists and homeopaths.\n\nMore importantly, the natural and social sciences and the humanities\nare all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic and\ncritical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible\nunderstanding of the workings of nature, people, and human society.\nThe disciplines that form this community of knowledge\ndisciplines are increasingly interdependent. Since\nthe second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such as\nastrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum\nchemistry, the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at\ndramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously\nunconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections have also\nlinked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be\nseen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on\nadvanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings.\n\nThe conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood with\nthis extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict we find\nthe community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural and\nsocial sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a wide\nvariety of movements and doctrines, such as creationism, astrology,\nhomeopathy, and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict with results\nand methods that are generally accepted in the community of knowledge\ndisciplines.\n\nAnother way to express this is that the demarcation problem has a\ndeeper concern than that of demarcating the selection of human\nactivities that we have for various reasons chosen to call\n\u201csciences\u201d. The ultimate issue is \u201chow to determine\nwhich beliefs are epistemically warranted\u201d (Fuller 1985,\n331). In a wider approach, the sciences are fact-finding\npractices, i.e., human practices aimed at finding out, as far as\npossible, how things really are (Hansson 2018). Other examples of\nfact-finding practices in modern societies are journalism, criminal\ninvestigations, and the methods used by mechanics to search for the\ndefect in a malfunctioning machine. Fact-finding practices are also\nprevalent in indigenous societies, for instance in the forms of\ntraditional agricultural experimentation and the methods used for\ntracking animal prey (Liebenberg 2013). In this perspective, the\ndemarcation of science is a special case of the delimitation of\naccurate fact-finding practices. The delimitation between science and\npseudoscience has much in common with other delimitations, such as\nthat between accurate and inaccurate journalism and between properly\nand improperly performed criminal investigations (Hansson 2018).\n",
