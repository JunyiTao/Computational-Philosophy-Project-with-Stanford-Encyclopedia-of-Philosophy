    "main_text": "Branching time temporal logics\n5. Branching time temporal logics\n\nMuch of Prior\u2019s work on Tense Logic was initially motivated by\nthe problems concerning the relationship between time and modality\nraised by the Master Argument of Diodorus Chronus and its fatalistic\nconclusion. Prior held a genuine interest in themes like indeterminism\nand the open future. One of his major concerns here was to allow for\nhuman freedom. In order to capture the notion of historical necessity\nunderlying Diodorus\u2019 argument, he opted for a branching\nrepresentation of the interrelation of time and modality, which was\nfirst suggested to him in a letter by Kripke in 1958 (see Ploug and\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2012). The Diodorean conception of modality as\nquantification over linear time was abandoned and replaced by the\npicture of a tree, whose branches depict alternative possibilities for\nthe future. Prior (1967, Chapter 7) considered two different versions\nof branching time temporal logic, which he associated with the\nhistorical views of Peirce and Ockham, respectively. An early formal\ntreatment of these ideas is provided in Thomason (1970; 1984) and\nBurgess (1978). Many technical results and further developments have\nbeen proposed since then, and we mention the most important ones\nbelow. For Prior\u2019s motivational views on indeterminism and human\nfreedom, see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995, Chapters 2.6 and\n3.2) and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2019). A detailed discussion of the\nphilosophical aspects of the theory of branching time is contained in\ne.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and Correia and Iacona (2013).\n",
