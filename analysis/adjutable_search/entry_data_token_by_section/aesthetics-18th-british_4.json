    "main_text": "Imagination Theories || Addison\n2.1 Addison\n\nJoseph Addison\u2019s theory of taste resides principally in the work\nAddison refers to as his \u201cessay on the pleasures of the\nimagination\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, nos. 409 and 421). It\ncomprises eleven papers\u2014nos. 411 through 421\u2014appearing in\nthe journal The Spectator on successive days during the\nsummer of 1712. The timing of the essay\u2019s publication raises\nquestions about its relation to Shaftesbury\u2019s\nCharacteristics, which had appeared one year earlier. But it\nis difficult to detect even a hint of Shaftesbury\u2019s theory of\ntaste in Addison\u2019s. That the two theories deeply oppose one\nanother might suggest that Addison\u2019s is a reaction against\nShaftesbury\u2019s. But Addison does not engage Shaftesbury: rather\nhe tends simply to assume what Shaftesbury simply denies and\nvice-versa. Moreover Addison understood himself to be undertaking\nsomething \u201centirely new\u201d in advancing a theory of taste\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). It seems best to conclude,\ntherefore, that there are two original British theories of taste.\nWhile it would be hard to say which was more influential, it is easy\nto say that each was greatly so: every subsequent British theory of\ntaste, at least until the close of the Eighteenth Century, shows the\nstrong influence of one, the other, or both.\n\nAddison\u2019s fundamental idea is that the pleasures of taste are\npleasures of the imagination. This should not be taken to imply that\nAddison identifies taste with the imagination. Taste is a faculty of\njudgment: it discerns the perfections of an author with pleasure\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). Imagination is a faculty of\nrepresentation: it represents things in images; it is the faculty of\nvisual representation (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 411). Hence\nAddison\u2019s fundamental idea comes to this, apparently: taste\njudges what the imagination represents; the perfections that taste\ndiscerns with pleasure are perfections that things have as objects of\nvisual representation. But if objects of taste are objects of visual\nrepresentation, then objects of taste are first and foremost material\nobjects: mountain ranges, waterfalls, sexually attractive bodies are\namong the paradigms Addison offers (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412).\nIt is here that the contrast with Shaftesbury becomes plain. It will\nbe recalled that Shaftesbury holds objects of taste to be first and\nforemost objects of intellect, and that the fundamental difficulty\nthat his theory must overcome is to explain our intuition that\nmaterial objects are also capable of beauty. With Addison it is just\nthe reverse.\n\nAddison distinguishes two classes of pleasures of the imagination:\nprimary pleasures, which derive from images of objects currently\npresent to sight; and secondary pleasures, which derive from images of\nobjects currently absent from sight and so called up before the mind\nin some other way. He then divides primary pleasures into three\nclasses: those proceeding from the sight of what is great (or\nsublime); those proceeding from the sight of what is novel; and those\nproceeding from the sight of what is beautiful. A great object is one\nso large as to strain the imagination\u2019s capacity to render it:\nits apprehension flings the mind into a \u201cpleasing\nastonishment\u201d and a \u201cdelightful stillness and\namazement\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). A novel object is\none new or strange to their viewer; its apprehension \u201cfills the\nsoul with an agreeable surprise\u201d and \u201cgratifies its\ncuriosity\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). A beautiful\nobject is either an object of sexual attraction or one possessing a\n\u201cgaiety or variety of colors\u201d or \u201ca symmetry or\nproportion of parts\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412); the\napprehension of beautiful objects strikes the mind with a\n\u201csecret [i.e., inexplicable] satisfaction and complacency\u201d\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412).\n\nAddison\u2019s chief interest in secondary pleasures owes to their\ncomprising the pleasures of artistic representation: representational\nartworks, he maintains, function centrally to call up mental images of\nobjects that are great, novel, or beautiful. So Homer excels in the\nrepresentation of great things, Virgil in the representation of\nbeautiful things, Ovid in the representation of novel things, and\nMilton in the representation of all three (Addison and Steele 1879,\nno. 417). But Addison acknowledges that this account of the pleasures\nof artistic representation is so far incomplete; indeed he devotes a\ngood portion the latter part of the essay to its supplementation.\n\nIt seems clear, for starters, that our interest in artistic\nrepresentations is not exhausted by our interest in what they\nrepresent: we take pleasure in the representations themselves as\nrepresentations. To supply this deficiency Addison proposes a \u201ca\nnew principle of pleasure, which is nothing else but the action of the\nmind, which compares the ideas that arise from [the representation],\nwith the ideas that arise from the objects themselves\u201d (Addison\nand Steele 1879, no. 418). The description of a beautiful scene\npleases us, according to this proposal, both for the beauty of the\nscene and for \u201cthe aptness of the description to excite its\nimage\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no 418). But Addison himself\nseems less than fully convinced by this proposal, since there is no\nreason to think of a pleasure arising from an act of comparison as a\npleasure of the imagination; such a pleasure, he concedes, \u201cmay\nbe more properly called the pleasure of the understanding\u201d\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 418).\n\nA second deficiency concerns our interest in the artistic\nrepresentations of things positively disagreeable, such as our\ninterest in the performances of tragedies. The difficulty is that it\nseems we ought always to prefer representations of the agreeable,\nsince they alone are capable of pleasing according to both principles\nso far advanced. Hence Addison recruits a third principle of pleasure:\nrepresentations of the disagreeable please us by the contrast they\npresent between the disagreeable scene they represent and the\ncomparatively agreeable situation in which we find ourselves:\n\nWhen we look on such hideous objects, we are not a little pleased to\nthink that we are in no danger of them. We consider them at the same\ntime, as dreadful and harmless; so that the more frightful appearance\nthey make, the greater is the pleasure we receive from the sense of\nour own safety. (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 418)\n\n\nA third perceived deficiency derives from the common intuition that\nsome pleasures of artistic representation derive from the\nrepresentation of purely intellectual objects, such as abstract moral,\ncritical, or scientific truths. Addison concedes the truth of this\nintuition, but maintains that pleasures derived from the\nrepresentation of such intellectual objects are pleasures of taste\nonly insofar as the objects are represented metaphorically as having\nmaterial form:\n\na truth in the understanding is as it were reflected by the\nimagination; we are able to see something like color and shape in a\nnotion, and to discover a scheme of thoughts traced upon matter.\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 421)\n\n\nThe materialist basis of Addison\u2019s theory disposes it to a\nrelativism and so to an anti-realism with respect to the perfections\nof taste, much as the intellectualist basis of the theories of\nShaftesbury and Reid disposes them to an absolutism and so to a\nrealism. Because the pleasures of taste are pleasures taken merely in\nthe visual representation of material objects, there is no reason to\nthink any creature capable of visual representation incapable of such\npleasures. But there is also no reason to think all creatures capable\nof such pleasures capable of all the same pleasures from all the same\nobjects. Indeed there is every reason to think that\n\nevery different species of sensible creatures has its different\nnotions of beauty, and \u2026 each of them is most affected with the\nbeauties of its own kind. (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412)\n\n\nHence Addison concludes that \u201c[t]here is not perhaps any real\nbeauty \u2026 more in one piece of matter than another\u201d and\nthat beauty\u2014and also greatness and novelty,\npresumably\u2014exists in the mind merely merely (Addison and Steele\n1879, nos. 412 and 413).\n",
