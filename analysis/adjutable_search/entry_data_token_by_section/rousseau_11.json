    "main_text": "Education\n6. Place in the history of philosophy\n\nIn the course of his work, Rousseau engaged intellectually with a wide\nrange of predecessors and contemporaries, and was deeply influenced by\nancient writers, perhaps especially Plato. The most immediate\ninfluences on his political philosophy include Montesquieu, Hobbes,\nLocke, Mandeville and Diderot. Hobbes\u2019s conception of sovereign\npower, duly transmuted by Rousseau\u2019s rejection of the notion of\nrepresentative sovereignty, clearly marks the Social\nContract, and Rousseau sometimes claimed that all he was doing\nwas to restate Locke, though this has often been read with some\nperplexity (Brooke 2009). Among the contemporary philosophers who\nengaged closely with Rousseau\u2019s work was Adam Smith, who\nfamously reviewed the Discourse on Inequality for the\nEdinburgh Review (Griswold 2018). Rousseau\u2019s thinking\nhas had a profound influence on later philosophers and political\ntheorists, although the tensions and ambiguities in his work have\nmeant that his ideas have been developed in radically incompatible and\ndivergent ways. In modern political philosophy, for example, it is\npossible to detect Rousseau as a source of inspiration for liberal\ntheories, communitarian ideas, civic republicanism, and in theories of\ndeliberative and participatory democracy. Hostile writers have\nportrayed Rousseau as a source of inspiration for the more\nauthoritarian aspects of the French revolution and thence for aspects\nof fascism and communism.\n\nRousseau\u2019s most important philosophical impact was on Immanuel\nKant. A portrait of Rousseau was the only image on display in\nKant\u2019s house, and legend has it that the only time that Kant\nforgot to take his daily walk was when reading Emile.\nInstances of direct influence include Kant\u2019s idea of the\ncategorical imperative, the third formulation of which in the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals (the so-called formula\nof the kingdom of ends) recalls Rousseau\u2019s discussion of the\ngeneral will in The Social Contract. Ironically, Kant\u2019s\ndetachment of the idea of universal legislation from its context in\nthe particularity of single society reverses Rousseau\u2019s own\napproach, since Rousseau had, in preparatory work for The Social\nContract rejected the idea of a general will of the human race as\nthat notion appeared in Diderot\u2019s article \u201cNatural\nRight\u201d in the Encyclop\u00e9die. Rousseau\u2019s\ninfluence can also be seen in Kant\u2019s moral psychology,\nespecially in work such as Religion Within the Limits of Reason\nAlone, in Kant\u2019s own thinking about conjectural history,\nand in his writings on international justice which draw on\nRousseau\u2019s engagement with the work of the Abb\u00e9 St.\nPierre.\n\nThe cases of Hegel and Marx are more complex. Hegel\u2019s direct\nreferences to Rousseau are often uncomplimentary. In the\nPhilosophy of Right, while praising Rousseau for the idea\nthat will is the basis of the state, he misrepresents the idea of the\ngeneral will as being merely the idea of the overlap between the\ncontingent wills of private individuals. In the Encyclopedia\nLogic he demonstrates an awareness that this was not\nRousseau\u2019s view. Hegel\u2019s discussion of the master-slave\ndialectic and the problem of recognition in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit also draws on Rousseau, in this case on the notion of\namour propre and the ways in which attempts to exact respect\nand recognition from others can be self-defeating. Karl Marx\u2019s\nconcerns with alienation and exploitation have also been thought to\nbear some kind of relationship to Rousseau\u2019s thinking on related\ntopics. Here the evidence is more indirect, since the references to\nRousseau in Marx\u2019s work are few and insubstantial.\n\nIn contemporary political philosophy, it is clear that the thinking of\nJohn Rawls, especially in A Theory of Justice reflects the\ninfluence of Rousseau and Rawls himself referred to his two principles\nof justice as an effort to \u201cspell out the content of the general\nwill\u201d (Cohen 2010, p.2; Brooke 2015). A good example of\nRousseau\u2019s influence is the way in which Rawls uses the device\nof the \u201coriginal position\u201d to put self-interested choice\nat the service of the determination of the principles of justice. This\nexactly parallels Rousseau\u2019s argument that citizens will be\ndrawn to select just laws as if from an impartial perspective, because\nthe universality and generality of the law means that when considering\ntheir own interests they will select the measure that best reflects\ntheir own interests. Echoes of Rousseau\u2019s contractualism are\nalso found in the work of the later Frankfurt School, most notably in\nHabermas and Honneth.\n",
