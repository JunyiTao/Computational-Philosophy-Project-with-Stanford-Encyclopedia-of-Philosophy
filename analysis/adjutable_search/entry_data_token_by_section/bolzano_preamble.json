    "main_text": "\n\nBernard Bolzano (1781\u20131848) was a Catholic priest, a professor\nof the doctrine of Catholic religion at the Philosophical Faculty of\nthe University of Prague, an outstanding mathematician and one of the\ngreatest logicians or even (as some would have it) the\ngreatest logician who lived in the long stretch of time between\nLeibniz and Frege. As far as logic is concerned, Bolzano anticipated\nalmost exactly 100 years before Tarski and Carnap their semantic\ndefinitions of logical truth and logical consequence; and in\nmathematics he is not only known for his famous Paradoxes of the\nInfinite, but also for certain results that have become and still\nare standard in textbooks of mathematics such as the\nBolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Bolzano also made important contributions\nto other fields of knowledge in and outside of philosophy. Due to the\nversatility of his talents and the various fields to which he made\nsubstantial contributions he became one of the last great polymaths in\nthe history of ideas.\n\nThe presentation of Bolzano\u2019s personality that is given here\nwould still be incomplete unless it were added that Bolzano was also a\ngreat philanthropist. This becomes evident not only by Bolzano\u2019s\nwritings in ethics and political philosophy, but it also manifests\nitself in practice by his activities for the benefit of the poor,\nsubjugated, discriminated and disadvantaged people. Together with his\nfriends and pupils he supported activities in favor of such things as\npoorhouses, homes for the blind, loan banks for the working-class, and\nlibraries and elementary schools in the countryside. \n\nThe first section of the article deals with Bolzano\u2019s biography,\nand the second section presents a survey of Bolzano\u2019s main\nwritings; the following sections (3 to 12) are devoted to the\ndifferent branches of philosophy to which Bolzano made contributions.\nIn the final section (13) Bolzano\u2019s influence on the development\nof the sciences and on the intellectual life in Bohemia is\nconsidered.\n",
