    "main_text": "Religion || Law\n6.2 Law\n\nThe Decisive Treatise argues forcefully that philosophy\nshould have a prominent place in religious reflection, and\nspecifically in Islamic law (shar\u012b\u02bfa). This stance,\nalongside his devotion to Aristotelian demonstration (see \u00a72),\nmight raise the question of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\n\u201crationalism\u201d: Does he regard philosophy as having some\nkind of priority in religious contexts? But this question is not Ibn\nRushd\u2019s, inasmuch as he establishes no hierarchy between\nphilosophy and true religion. The law can serve as a kind of preamble\nto philosophy, addressed to a much wider audience and containing clues\nto guide the philosopher in theoretical matters. But there is no\nquestion of priority. As he famously writes, in a passage that\n(perhaps tellingly) echoes Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics\nI.32, \u201cSince the law is true, \u2026 we, the Muslim community,\nknow firmly that demonstrative reasoning does not lead to disagreement\nwith what the law sets down. For truth does not oppose truth, but\nrather agrees with and bears witness to it\u201d (Decisive\nTreatise 12; see Taylor 2000).\n\nThe implicit target of the Decisive Treatise is\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s notorious fatwa against metaphysics. By\ncharacterizing philosophy in narrowly metaphysical terms, as a science\nthat leads from artifacts back to the Artisan through demonstrative\nmethods, Ibn Rushd means to show that God cannot be demonstrably known\nwithout these methods. To prohibit this path to knowledge from those\nwho are capable of it is an injustice both to God and to these\nscholars. In his Long Commentary on the Metaphysics (I.2\n{10}), he goes so far as to distinguish between two types of\nshar\u012b\u02bfa, one general for everyone or most people,\nand the other \u201cspecific\u201d to the philosophers. This might\nsuggest that philosophy, for those capable of it, transcends the\nteachings of Islamic law (Taylor 2012), but it is not at all clear\nthat Ibn Rushd ever commits himself to such a claim. Here in\nLongMeta, he may be speaking of shar\u012b\u02bfa\nonly loosely, as a \u201cway\u201d or \u201cmethod.\u201d And even\nif he does mean that philosophy is literally a\nshar\u012b\u02bfa, it does not follow that it is a law that\ncompetes against religion. After all, the specific stands to the\ngeneral as something that is complementary, not conflicting.\n\nTo be sure, the general shar\u012b\u02bfa of Islam is\npartially subject to the interpretation of philosophers, since they\nare the only ones who have the arsenal, namely demonstration, to bring\nout its hidden meanings, allegories, signs, and symbols. In the end,\nhowever, this serves shar\u012b\u02bfa itself, and cannot do otherwise\nsince, as Ibn Rushd never tires of declaring, Islamic Law is true and\nit calls on everyone, including philosophers, to follow its\nprescriptions (e.g., Incoherence II.4; Decisive\nTreatise 11). Philosophers pursue one path to this\ntruth\u2014the most exalted path available to human beings\u2014but\nthere are other paths, such as the rhetorical and dialectical, that\nalso arrive at this truth.\n\nFor all of Ibn Rushd\u2019s involvement in esoteric questions of\nAristotelianism, he was, at the same time, a practicing judge, deeply\nconcerned with jurisprudential theory. Ibn Rushd\u2019s principal\nwork in this domain is the Distinguished Jurist\u2019s\nPrimer, a lengthy handbook on the causes of the jurists\u2019\ndisputes and a comparison between the rationales for decision-making\nby different Sunni schools of jurisprudence. Its originality lies in\nthe rational mechanisms that Ibn Rushd employs to establish general\nrules for understanding agreements and disagreements among jurists. He\nwrites that \u201cour intention in these matters is only the rules\ngoverning the law, not an enumeration of the branches, which would\nhave no end\u201d (Jurist\u2019s Primer 26.241 {ii.202}).\nSo rather than focus on counting the differences that exist between\njurists and schools of jurisprudence, Ibn Rushd attempts to explain\nthese differences by referring them to their principles, rules, and\nthe causes that regulate them. By following the points of disagreement\nbetween the jurists and deducing the causes of this disagreement, and\nthen bringing them back to the general principles and rules equivalent\nto a general maxim rooted in his soul (Jurist\u2019s Primer\n24.179, 220\u20131 {ii.148, 184-5}), the assiduous jurist\n(al-mujtahid) becomes capable of deciding about the unknown\nsituations he will face.\n\nWhat makes these general rules so important is the imitative and\nrepetitive style of jurisprudence in Ibn Rushd\u2019s day, which had\nbeen overwhelmed by a focus on individual cases and the endless\nbranching of views. Thus, either the jurist works according to a rule\nthat distinguishes similar cases from others, or he works according to\nordinary common sense to produce controversial answers. This is what\nthe writings of the Malikites suffered from in his time. Ibn Rushd\ninsists on establishing jurisprudential maxims that make\nunderstandable the disagreement among schools of jurisprudence and\njurists and provide the diligent jurist with basic mechanism for\nmaking decisions regarding emerging problems and cases.\n",
