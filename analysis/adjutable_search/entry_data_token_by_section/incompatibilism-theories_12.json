    "main_text": "Agent-Causal Theories || Causation by a Substance\n4. The Evidence\n\nOur discussion of incompatibilist theories of free will has focused so\nfar on whether they provide an adequate account of what free will\nwould be if it exists. However, even if one or another of these views\nis theoretically satisfactory in this regard, the question remains\nwhether there is any evidence that what the theory says is required\nfor free will actually exists.\n\nIncompatibilist accounts require, first, that determinism be false.\nBut more than this, they require that there be indeterminism of a\ncertain sort (e.g., with some events entirely uncaused, or\nnondeterministically caused, or caused by agents and not\ndeterministically caused by events) and that this indeterminism be\nlocated in specific places (generally, at the time of the occurrence\nof decisions and other basic actions). What is our evidence that these\nrequirements are satisfied?\n\nThe scientific evidence for quantum mechanics is sometimes said to\nshow that determinism is false. Quantum theory is indeed very well\nconfirmed. However, there is nothing approaching a consensus on how to\ninterpret it. Indeterministic as well as deterministic interpretations\nhave been developed, but it is far from clear whether any of the\nexisting interpretations is correct. (For a more in depth discussion\nof rival interpretations of quantum mechanics see section 4.4 of the\nDeterminism entry.) Perhaps the best that can be said here is that\nthere is currently no good evidence that determinism is true.\n\nThe scientific evidence is even less decisive with respect to whether\nthere is the kind of indeterminism located in exactly the places\nrequired by typical incompatibilists. Unless there is a complete\nindependence of mental events from physical events, then even for free\ndecisions there has to be indeterminism of a specific sort at specific\njunctures in certain brain processes. There are some interesting\nspeculations in the works of some incompatibilists about how this\nmight be so (see, e.g., Kane 1996b: 128\u201330, 137\u201342, and\nthe sources cited there), but our current understanding of the brain\ngives us little evidence one way or the other about whether it is in\nfact so.\n\nSome noncausal theories of free will maintain that for us to act\nfreely our actions must be uncaused. However, we seem to have little\nevidence that this (alleged) requirement is ever met. We do, however,\nhave evidence that it often isn\u2019t met, as a compelling case can\nbe made that many of our everyday actions have causes (Capes 2017).\nConsider an ordinary, everyday action: Tony goes to the store to buy\nsome chocolate cake. Why did he do so? In part because his wife asked\nhim to, and the \u2018because\u2019 here is arguably causal. That\nthe request is a cause of Tony\u2019s action is suggested by the\npresence of several causal markers, things that indicate a causal\nconnection between two states or events. For instance, effects often\n(though not always) counterfactually depend on their causes,\nand Tony\u2019s action counterfactually depends on his\nwife\u2019s request; had she not asked him to go to the store and get\ncake, he wouldn\u2019t have done so. Tony\u2019s action also\ncounterfactually varies with the content of his wife\u2019s\nrequest; had she asked for carrot cake instead of chocolate, he would\nhave gotten carrot cake instead. His wife\u2019s request raised\nthe probability (even if it didn\u2019t ensure) that he would go\nto the store and buy some cake, it helps explain why he went\nto the store and got what he got, and it was a means to the\nend of getting Tony to go to the store. The joint presence of\nthese causal markers strongly suggests that Tony\u2019s wife\u2019s\nrequest that he go to the store and get some cake is a cause of his\ndoing so. Note, moreover, that Tony\u2019s action isn\u2019t special\nin this regard. Similar claims can be made about many of our everday\nbehaviors. If so, and if an action must be uncaused in order to be\nfree, then we have reason to suppose that we rarely, if ever, act\nfreely.\n\nWhat about agent causation? It is sometimes argued that agent\ncausation must be anomic, not subject to any laws of nature, and that\non our best evidence this requirement is not met (Pereboom 2001: ch. 3\nand 2014: 65\u201369). However, the claim that free will requires such\nlawlessness is contested (Clarke 2010).\n\nSome incompatibilists (e.g., Campbell 1957: 168\u201370 and\nO\u2019Connor 1995: 196\u201397) claim that our experience when we\nmake decisions and act constitutes evidence that there is\nindeterminism of the required sort in the required place. There are\nvarious ways to develop this claim. A strong version has it that our\nexperience of our own agency represents our actions as being produced\nin just the way that one or another incompatibilist account says they\nmust be if we are to have free will. (For an objection to this claim,\nsee Mele 1995: 135\u201337). A weaker version of the claim is that we\nexperience some of our actions as free (even if that experience\ndoesn\u2019t represent our actions as being uncaused or\nnon-deterministically caused or agent caused) and then infer from this\nexperience, together with the assumption that free will requires\nindeterminism of the relevant sort, that the right sort of\nindeterminism obtains. However, both versions of the claim are open to\nthe following objection. If things are to be the way they are said to\nbe by some incompatibilist account, then the laws of nature\u2014laws\nof physics, chemistry, and biology\u2014must be a certain way. (This\nis so for overt, bodily actions regardless of the relation between\nmind and body, and it is so for decisions and other mental actions\nbarring a complete independence of mental events from physical,\nchemical, and biological events.) And many find it incredible that how\nthings seem to us when we act gives us insight into the laws of\nnature.\n\nWhether they should, though, is a matter of controversy. Suppose one\nexperiences oneself falling. Surely this imposes some limits on how\nthe laws of nature could be. Perhaps there must be something like a\nlaw of gravity in order for this experience to be veridical. Or, more\nminimally, one can at least infer from the experience of falling that\nthe laws of nature don\u2019t preclude falling. So, there is no\ngeneral problem with inferring facts about the laws of nature from\none\u2019s own experiences. The question, then, is whether there is\nsome special problem with inferring from our experience of our own\nagency that the incompatibilist requirements are met.\n\nSome incompatibilists (e.g., van Inwagen 1983: 204\u201313) hold\nthat, although we lack good empirical or experiential evidence that we\nhave free will, we nevertheless have good moral reason to believe that\nwe have it. The claim is that we have good reason to believe that we\nare sometimes morally responsible for our behavior and that moral\nresponsibility requires free will. Together, these claims give us good\nreason to suppose that we sometimes have free will. However, absent\nsolid evidence for the indeterminism that incompatibilists say is\nrequired for free will, if we justifiably believe that responsibility\nrequires free will and that free will requires indeterminism, it seems\nto some that, rather than concluding that we have free will, we should\ninstead withhold judgment on whether we are ever morally responsible\nfor anything.\n\nIf an incompatibilist theory of free will is correct, it thus appears\nto be an open question whether the requirements for free will\nspecified by the theory are ever satisfied, and thus an open question\nas well whether anyone ever has free will.\n",
