    "main_text": "Voltaire\u2019s Life: The Philosopher as Critic and Public Activist || Voltaire\u2019s Early Years (1694\u20131726)\n1.1 Voltaire\u2019s Early Years (1694\u20131726)\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie d\u2019Arouet was born in 1694, the fourth of five children, to a well-to-do public official and his well bred aristocratic wife. In its fusion of traditional French aristocratic pedigree with the new wealth and power of royal bureaucratic administration, the d\u2019Arouet family was representative of elite society in France during the reign of Louis XIV. The young Fran\u00e7ois-Marie acquired from his parents the benefits of prosperity and political favor, and from the Jesuits at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand in Paris he also acquired a first-class education. Fran\u00e7ois-Marie also acquired an introduction to modern letters from his father who was active in the literary culture of the period both in Paris and at the royal court of Versailles. Fran\u00e7ois senior appears to have enjoyed the company of men of letters, yet his frustration with his son\u2019s ambition to become a writer is notorious. From early in his youth, Voltaire aspired to emulate his idols Moli\u00e8re, Racine, and Corneille and become a playwright, yet Voltaire\u2019s father strenuously opposed the idea, hoping to install his son instead in a position of public authority. First as a law student, then as a lawyer\u2019s apprentice, and finally as a secretary to a French diplomat, Voltaire attempted to fulfill his father\u2019s wishes. But in each case, he ended up abandoning his posts, sometimes amidst scandal.\nEscaping from the burdens of these public obligations, Voltaire would retreat into the libertine sociability of Paris. It was here in the 1720s, during the culturally vibrant period of the Regency government between the reigns of Louis XIV and XV (1715\u20131723), that Voltaire established one dimension of his identity. His wit and congeniality were legendary even as a youth, so he had few difficulties establishing himself as a popular figure in Regency literary circles. He also learned how to play the patronage game so important to those with writerly ambitions. Thanks, therefore, to some artfully composed writings, a couple of well-made contacts, more than a few bon mots, and a little successful investing, especially during John Law\u2019s Mississippi Bubble fiasco, Voltaire was able to establish himself as an independent man of letters in Paris. His literary debut occurred in 1718 with the publication of his Oedipe, a reworking of the ancient tragedy that evoked the French classicism of Racine and Corneille. The play was first performed at the home of the Duchesse du Maine at Sceaux, a sign of Voltaire\u2019s quick ascent to the very pinnacle of elite literary society. Its published title page also announced the new pen name that Voltaire would ever after deploy.\nDuring the Regency, Voltaire circulated widely in elite circles such as those that congregated at Sceaux, but he also cultivated more illicit and libertine sociability as well. This pairing was not at all uncommon during this time, and Voltaire\u2019s intellectual work in the 1720s\u2014a mix of poems and plays that shifted between playful libertinism and serious classicism seemingly without pause\u2014illustrated perfectly the values of pleasure, honn\u00eatet\u00e9, and good taste that were the watchwords of this cultural milieu. Philosophy was also a part of this mix, and during the Regency the young Voltaire was especially shaped by his contacts with the English aristocrat, freethinker,and Jacobite Lord Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke lived in exile in France during the Regency period, and Voltaire was a frequent visitor to La Source, the Englishman\u2019s estate near Orl\u00e9ans. The chateau served as a reunion point for a wide range of intellectuals, and many believe that Voltaire was first introduced to natural philosophy generally, and to the work of Locke and the English Newtonians specifically, at Bolingbroke\u2019s estate. It was certainly true that these ideas, especially in their more deistic and libertine configurations, were at the heart of Bolingbroke\u2019s identity.\n",
