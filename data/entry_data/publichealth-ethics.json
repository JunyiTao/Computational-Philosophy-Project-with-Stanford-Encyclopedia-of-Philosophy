    "preamble": "\n\nAt its core, public health is concerned with promoting and protecting\nthe health of\n populations,[1]\n broadly understood. Promoting and protecting the health of\npopulations often involves or requires coordinated action on the part\nof governments. In the United States, for example, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Protection Agency\nare, at least in part, public health agencies. All nations and most\nstates or provinces and municipalities have health departments whose\nfunctions include everything from the inspection of commercial food\nservice to the collection and use of epidemiological data for\npopulation surveillance of disease. Collective action to promote and\nprotect population health also occurs at the global level, as\nexemplified by the activities of the World Health Organization.\n\nThis entry provides a general lay of the land of the central ethical\nissues and challenges that arise in public health policies and\npractices and that drive the literature in public health ethics. Some\nissues are conceptual: what is the public, and in what sense can a\npublic be healthy? Other questions concern the moral foundations of\nthe enterprise: what sort of value does public health have, and what\nmorally justifies efforts to promote public health?\n\nThe literature in public health ethics often falls into two big\ncategories. The first category focuses on the goals, targets and\npriorities of public health policies and programs from the standpoint\nof justice. Many of the issues engage familiar debates between\nutilitarian and various egalitarian approaches to the allocation of\nresources and the distribution of benefits and burdens (see also the\nentry on\n justice);\n in health policy circles these issues often play out as tensions\nbetween efficiency and equity. The justice literature in public health\nethics also addresses broader concerns about structural injustice,\nfairness and power. Health and threats to health often vary\nsignificantly between different social groups or subpopulations within\na defined public. Because these differences frequently co-travel with\nindices of disadvantage and power, and because health is viewed by\nmany as a core dimension of human welfare or flourishing, some frame\nthe foundation or justification of public health in terms of fairness\nand justice \u2013 much in the way that significant disparities in\nresources or liberties are generally framed. Although questions of\njustice in public health regularly occur within the same nation-state,\nthese same questions also arise between countries and regions of the\nworld. For instance, the life expectancy of individuals in many\ncountries in the global south is far lower than in wealthier nations.\nTo some, this is a clear injustice, one that should be front and\ncenter in debates about public health.\n\nThe second category in the public health ethics literature also\nfocuses on the goals and targets of public health policies and\nprograms but from the standpoint of the legitimacy or authority of the\nState to implement measures that promote or protect public health.\n(See also the entry on\n political legitimacy.)\n The normative perspective of legitimacy is particularly relevant in\npublic health ethics because public health interventions are typically\nundertaken by government, and many maintain that various government\ninterventions stand in special need of moral justification. Familiar\ndebates about the tension between individual liberty and the common\ngood or the moral permissibility of paternalistic interventions have\ntraditionally animated this discussion. Others frame the challenges of\nstate legitimacy or authority slightly differently in terms of what\ngovernments should do when citizens disagree about values, such as the\nimportance of health \u2013 individual or public. Still others object\nto the framing of the foundations or justifications of public health\nfrom the standpoint of legitimacy in the liberal tradition.\n\nMany real-world challenges in public health ethics require both the\njustice and the legitimacy standpoints in order to provide an adequate\nanalysis of what is morally at stake. For instance, one way to\ninterpret challenges to New York\u2019s soda tax is that the state\nlacked the right to interfere with individual choice by imposing a\ntax, or that such a tax was objectionable because it rested on a\ncontentious view about the disvalue of soft drinks. However, that\nframing is ethically incomplete without also addressing whether the\nregressive character of the tax meant that the costs of its attendant\npublic health benefits would be borne disproportionately by subgroups\nin the population who are already disadvantaged in ways that cannot be\njustified.\n\nMany writers in public health ethics are concerned to integrate both\nstandpoints in their analyses of specific issues in public health\npolicy that, like the soda tax example, importantly engage them both.\nHowever, because many debates within public health ethics are located\nin one standpoint or the other, we distinguish them in this\nentry. Before taking up these different debates, Section 1 articulates\ntwo distinctive features of public health that give shape to public\nhealth ethics and help to distinguish it from other areas of inquiry\nin bioethics, especially the ethics of clinical practice. The first\nand perhaps most defining of these two features is that public health\nis committed to advancing the health of collectives, and not the\nhealth of individuals. Much of Section 1 is taken up with several\nconceptual and ethics questions that emerge from this feature. The\nsecond distinctive feature of public health introduced in Section 1 is\nthe prominent role that government action and government power play in\nthe promotion of public health.\n\nSection 2 discusses issues in public health ethics that are\n(primarily) animated by the perspective of justice. Some of these\nissues flow directly from public health\u2019s focus on population\nhealth and the resultant need to aggregate goals and outcomes, as well\nas public health\u2019s special connection to prevention which is\nalso directly connected to its population-level focus. Section 3\ndiscusses issues in public health ethics that are (primarily) animated\nby the perspective of legitimacy. These issues flow from the heavy\nreliance of public health on government action and government\npower.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What Makes Public Health, And Therefore Public Health Ethics, Distinctive?\n\nThere is no standard way of organizing the ethics of clinical\npractice, public health, and biomedical science. These different\nfields are often presented as discrete areas of inquiry that fall\nunder the broader, umbrella term of bioethics, but sometimes bioethics\nis presented as the equivalent of medical ethics or in contrast to\npublic health or population-level bioethics. Whichever approach is\npreferred, a key question remains: what distinguishes public health\nethics from these other fields, and especially from the ethics of\nclinical care? The answer lies in two characteristics of public health\nthat make it distinctive and that mark morally relevant differences\nbetween public health and clinical care- first, public health\u2019s\nfocus on the health of populations and second, the large role that\ngovernment plays in this pursuit.\n1.1 Population Focus\n\nThe first and perhaps most defining characteristic of public health is\nthat it is committed to advancing health at the level of populations.\nBy contrast, in clinical practice, the focus is on the health of each\npatient, as an individual. While health is primarily understood as a\nprivate good in clinical care, in public health, health is a good of a\ngroup or collective that, in some sense, constitutes the public.\n\nPublic health\u2019s population focus necessitates that it deals only\nwith aggregated health concerns when setting goals and assessing\noutcomes. This need in public health to aggregate \u2013 and\ntherefore obscure individual or even sub-group \u2013 interests in\nhealth is, in turn, one of the reasons why so much of the literature\nin public health ethics engages questions of justice. We take up some\nof these questions in Section 2.\n\nPublic health\u2019s population focus also positions it well to lead\non the prevention of disease and injury (Rose 1985, Rose et al. 2008;\nChildress et al. 2002; Faden, Shebaya, and Siegel 2019). Although\nclinicians often incorporate preventive interventions in their\npractice with patients, no other social institution is generally\nrecognized as so clearly having a prevention remit. Many public health\nagencies, including in the US the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention and the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition\nare designed to prevent illness and injury at the population level.\nPublic health\u2019s commitment to prevention carries with it particular\nmoral challenges. Eliminating or mitigating harm that already exists\nis sometimes viewed as being of greater moral importance \u2013 or\nsimply as more immediately motivating action \u2013 than long-term\nstrategies to prevent harm from materializing. Whether it is ethically\njustifiable to privilege the interests of the currently ill, who are\noften known and identifiable, over those of future people who cannot\nnow be identified is a paradigmatic challenge of justice in public\nhealth ethics addressed briefly in Section 2.\n1.1.1 Who is the Public in Public Health?\n\nWhile many of the moral challenges that arise from public\nhealth\u2019s population health focus are primarily questions of\njustice, in this Section and in Section 1.1.2 we consider some\nchallenges, including some conceptual challenges, that are not.\n\nThat the object of moral concern in public health is the public rather\nthan individuals (Rose 1985; Rose et al. 2008; Coggon 2012) raises a\nconceptual question: what or who is the public? While interesting in\nits own right, this question is also important because it informs\njustificatory challenges that public health ethics has to address: who\nis public health good for? Whose health are we concerned with, and\nwhat sacrifices is it acceptable to ask of individuals in order to\nachieve it? And why is public health a good worth promoting?\n\nIn attempting to answer these questions, it is worth beginning by\nquerying whether, as has been used so far, the terms\n\u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cpopulation\u201d are interchangeable\nto designate the entity whose health is the object of public health\nconcern. Is there a significant conceptual difference, a difference in\nmoral valence, or a difference in attitude and orientation between\npublic health ethics on the one hand, and population-level health\nethics on the other? The literature presents three general ways of\ndenoting the object of public health: the community, the public, and\npopulations. In one sense, the most morally laden manner of\ndesignating those who are subject to, and benefit from, public health\nmeasures, is to think about them as a community (Beauchamp and\nSteinbock 1999). Reference to \u201ccommunity\u201d implies a\ncohesive group, usually with a shared language, culture, history, and\ngeographical location. Characterizing the concern of public health as\nbeing the health of the community renders more natural (and possibly\nmore plausible) appeal to the common good as a way of justifying\npublic health interventions.\n\nReference to \u201cthe public\u201d shares some of those same\nfeatures but tends to be less morally laden. This is in part because\n\u201cthe public\u201d is somewhat more anonymous than \u201cthe\ncommunity\u201d and does not necessarily signal a tight cultural\nconnection. Rather, it connotes a relatively discrete unit with some\ncommon institutions and usually a shared political life. References to\nthe public as well as to the community may encourage the perception\nthat the good we are seeking to advance is that of a geographically\nbounded unit, with community connoting stronger cultural associations,\nand public connoting some kind of official political unit such as a\nstate or a country with geographically defined boundaries. One reason\nto be hesitant to accept this characterization is its problematic fit\nwith some threats to health. Communicable diseases, for example, have\na way of ignoring national boundaries, and preventive measures in one\ncountry may be futile if other countries do not follow\n suit.[2]\n\nCharacterizing the health we are trying to advance as that of\npopulations, by contrast, may minimize the implication that special\nshared features or characteristics are needed in order for a group of\nindividuals to constitute a collective unit whose health can be of\nconcern. Because of that, it may lend itself more readily to an\ninternationalist, less inward-looking orientation: any population,\nregardless of nationality or geographic location, has health interests\nthat ought to be attended to and advanced (Wikler & Brock 2007).\nPopulations can be more local or more global than a community or the\npublic. This way of speaking also may dilute the emphasis on national\nborders as a way of delineating the scope of concern and provides more\nflexibility in the object of concern for public health. In much the\nsame way, discussion of global health, as opposed to international\nhealth, is seen as helpful in emphasizing a focus on the health needs\nof all, as opposed to a focus on international cooperation and the\nhealth needs of peoples in countries other than one\u2019s own. This is\nnot, of course, to say that those who prefer the term \u201cpublic\nhealth\u201d to \u201cpopulation health\u201d do not share a global\norientation. Indeed, the World Health Organization is generally\nreferred to as a global public health institution, and those who work\nto promote health transnationally are referred to as public health and\nnot population health professionals. Indeed, although some see a\nsubstantive conceptual divergence in ways of thinking about whose\nhealth is to be protected and promoted, others see no conflict, at\nleast between the concepts of public health and population health. For\nexample, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics uses the term\n\u201cpopulation health\u201d to refer to the collective state of\nhealth of members of a population and the term \u201cpublic\nhealth\u201d to refer to efforts made to improve the political,\nregulatory and economic environments that affect prospects for health.\nSo understood, the object of public health is the improvement of\npopulation health (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, p. XV).\n\nDepending on the particular health challenge we are concerned with,\nthe public in question can be more local or more global than a single\ncountry\u2019s population. National boundaries are relevant because\nindividual countries usually set policies and regulations, which vary\nfrom country to country. They are also relevant for reasons having to\ndo with government control: countries report their data about\ncommunicable disease outbreaks, the burdens of disease, and other\nhealth indicators to global institutions such as the WHO on a\nvoluntary basis. Although International Health Regulations to which\n196 countries (WHO 2014) are signatories provide an international\nstructure for global public health, as with much international law and\nregulation, enforcement mechanisms are weak. The moral implications of\nthese practical limitations for public health are profound. The\nstructure of the problem is similar to environmental challenges such\nas climate change, which, as we note in 1.3, is itself increasingly\nbeing framed as a public health crisis. Some of the determinants of\nill health are not restricted by national boundaries, nor can they be\neffectively addressed by any nation on its own.\n1.1.2 What is the Health in Public Health?\n\nRegardless of how one specifies the contours of the public \u2013 as\na population, as a public, or as a more local community \u2013 a\ndistinct set of conceptual challenges central to public health ethics\nconcerns how to think about the nature of the health of the group and\nhow this differs from the health of individuals.\n\nThere are significant debates about how to conceptualize health; is it\nthe absence of disease, or does it involve more than that? Can health\nbe defined without reference to normative concepts? Other debates\nconcern the value of health, and whether health is good as an end,\ngood as a means or both or neither; whether the attitudes towards a\ngiven condition of those who have it affect whether it counts as\nhealthy or unhealthy; and a variety of other questions. (Ananth 2008;\nBoorse 1975; Coggon 2012; Hoffman 2010; Holland 2007; see the entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n We will not rehearse these debates here. Even if we put these\nquestions about the concept of health to the side, however, there are\nother questions that concern the nature of public health. Can the\nhealth of the public meaningfully be understood only as an aggregation\nof the health of each person that comprises the public, or is it\nsomething more than that? Is the health of the public something of\nvalue in its own right?\n\nThese questions are important because they have implications for\nparticular views on the ethics of public health. Some theorists of\npublic health treat the health of the public as something that cannot\nbe reduced to healthy individuals \u2013 what we will call\n\u2018anti-reductionist\u2019 views. Anti-reductionist views often\nconstrue the public as a community or political entity rather than a\npopulation. (Coggon 2012; Jennings 2007). If one endorses\nanti-reductionism, then various values might seem especially central\nto theorizing about public health. For instance, some argue that\ncommunal values, such as solidarity, are integral to understanding the\nvalue of public health. (Dawson and Jennings 2012; Jennings and Dawson\n2015). These views typically call for an extensive role for government\ninterventions aimed at promoting public health, although this is not a\nconceptually necessary feature of such views.\n\nReductionists, by contrast, think that the health of a public is\nreducible to an aggregation of the health of individuals. This claim\nabout reduction, however, need not signal an aversion to an extensive\nrole for government in protecting or promoting public health. That is,\nsome might deny that there is an entity, \u2018the public,\u2019\nthat matters morally in a way that cannot be reducible to individual\ninterests or values but agree with anti-reductionists about policy\nmeasures. For example, it is possible that focusing on measures that\nreduce the incidence of disease in a population will be better at\nproducing more value for individuals than a focus on treating or\npreventing disease for individuals. (Rose 1985; Rose et al. 2008)\nPresumably, various anti-reductionists would argue for a similar\nconclusion, although they would invoke other values to reach it.\n\nA third class of views is also reductionist but calls for a more\ncircumscribed range of public health interventions. For instance,\nclassical liberals often argue that it is morally impermissible for\ngovernment actors to intervene in ways that produce aggregate value\nwhen doing so infringes on individual liberty. More will be said about\nliberalism and public health in Section 3.2. Although these writers\nendorse a more restrictive view of the mandate of public health, some\nwould nevertheless endorse governments producing health-related public\ngoods, such as herd immunity (Anomaly 2011, 2012; Brennan 2018; Dees\n2018; Epstein 2004; Flanigan 2014b, 2017; Horne 2019).\n\nIn the economic sense of the term, public goods are non-rivalrous,\nwhich means that one person\u2019s enjoyment or consumption of the\ngood does not reduce the ability of others to enjoy that good. Public\ngoods are also non-excludable, which means it is very difficult to\nprevent others from enjoying the public good. (See the entry on\n the free-rider problem.)\n Paradigmatic public goods in public health include herd immunity,\nsanitation, and clean air. Not all the goods of public health are\npublic goods in this sense, however.\n\nConsider two concepts that are often invoked in debates about the\njustification for public health interventions- the \u2018common\ngood\u2019 and the \u2018public good.\u2019 These terms are\npolysemous, and this sometimes leads to confusion. Some uses of these\nterms are associated with political values as, for example, when\n\u2018the common good\u2019 refers to values shared or pursued\ncollectively by all members of a community. Many anti-reductionists\nwill invoke \u2018the common good,\u2019 so understood, to justify\npublic health interventions and policies. For instance, some argue\nthat all members of the same community, qua members of the same\ncommunity, have an interest in living in a social grouping in which\nall enjoy a high degree of health. Economists, by contrast, use\n\u2018common good\u2019 to refer to a pooled resource that is\nrivalrous (one person\u2019s usage diminishes the ability of others\nto use it) but non-excludable (it is quite difficult to exclude others\nfrom using it). In some public health contexts, safe water, food and\ndrugs can be understood as common goods in this sense.\n1.2 Government Intervention\n\nThe second distinctive feature of public health with significant\nimplications for public health ethics is the large role that\ngovernment intervention and government power play in public health. So\nmuch of what is undertaken to advance public health requires the\napparatus and power of the state to be effective. Some go as far as to\nclaim that what makes public health \u2018public\u2019 is, at least\npartly, that public health is the business of the public, as\ncontrasted with private individuals. To these theorists, the\ndistinction between public and private health is not to be found\nmerely in the collective rather than the individual-level focus.\nInstead, who or what is promoting the health of the populace is\nrelevant (see Coggon 2012; Jennings 2007; Verweij and Dawson 2007;\nDawson and Verweij 2008). For instance, in The Future of Public Health,\nthe Institute of Medicine includes the following definition:\n\u201cPublic health is what we, as a society, do collectively to\nassure the conditions in which people can be healthy\u201d (Institute\nof Medicine 1988, p. 1, emphasis added). If we assume that in a\nfunctional democracy action by the government is action by us,\ncollectively, then we arrive at yet another way to understand the\nespecially close connection between government action and public\nhealth. If one goes further and claims that an action is a public\nhealth action only if it is taken by the collective and that an action\nis performed by us, collectively, only if it is performed by\ngovernment, then an intervention is a public health intervention only\nif a government is the relevant actor.\n\nThis conclusion will strike many in public health as unduly narrow,\nhowever. Private non-profit actors, especially charitable foundations\nand other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), frequently undertake\nmeasures that would be hard to characterize as anything other than\npublic health interventions in their character and in the outcomes\nthey\n secure.[3]\n For instance, vaccine research and development is often supported by\nNGOs, and vaccines are often delivered in epidemic contexts by NGOs.\nSimilarly, NGOs often mount health promotion campaigns and provide\nresources to communities to improve local public health\ninfrastructure. It seems contrived, at best, to conclude that because\nNGOs operate in the private sector, their activities do not constitute\nefforts to advance public health. Perhaps a more natural description\nis that NGOs as private entities undertake interventions to directly\nimprove public health without themselves being governmental public\nhealth entities (Coggon 2012). Of course, one could argue that NGOs\nlack the standing to engage in public health activities because they\nare not accountable to citizens and do not act in their name. This is\na legitimacy-based concern that has been levied against the\ndevelopment interventions of large-scale philanthropies generally.\n(Reich 2018) The core of the concern is that these large scale NGOs\nhave the power to set agendas and priorities in ways that sidestep or\nusurp what should otherwise be the prerogative of functional\nnation-states to determine. In other contexts, this concern may have\nlittle purchase, however. Consider, for example, when global NGOs\nundertake activities with the robust cooperation of or at the\ninvitation of the state, or in failed or otherwise problematic\nnational contexts that lack the resources or the will to protect the\nhealth of all or some of the populations that live within their\nborders. Also, global, pan-national organizations, most notably the\nWorld Health Organization, play a critical role in advancing public\nhealth. It would be bizarre to conclude that policies and guidance of\nthe WHO, or interventions that WHO leads, are not public health\npolicies or interventions because the WHO is not a state actor and\ndoes not have the enforcement or police powers of a state.\n\nAlthough collective action in the form of government intervention is\nthus not a necessary condition of public health, government\nintervention is still central to public health. Achieving good public\nhealth outcomes frequently requires extensive coordination on the part\nof many actors. To secure coordination, incentive structures for\nindividuals often need to be changed, and it is most often governments\nthat have the authority to make these changes. Because of this\nauthority, governments are especially well-suited to overcome\ncharacteristic challenges in promoting or realizing public health.\nConsider, for example, a paradigmatic challenge in deploying vaccines\nto combat infectious disease. If enough people are not willing to be\nvaccinated, then herd immunity is undermined. A central though\ncontested function of government is to disincentivize going\nunvaccinated by implementing policies that penalize those who refuse\nvaccination.\n\nThis point about governments being especially well-suited to changing\nthe incentive structure of individuals is significant for public\nhealth ethics insofar as many public health measures are coercive or\nare otherwise backed by the force of law. In this, as in all other\nareas of official state action, those concerned with the ethics of\npublic health have to address tensions among justice, security, and\nthe scope of legal restrictions and regulations. These tensions add to\nthe peculiarity of the justificatory questions surrounding public\nhealth: the exercise of public authority and the imposition of public\nsanctions and penalties in an area as deeply personal as an\nindividual\u2019s health choices require strong justification. The same\nquestions about trade-offs between personal freedom and collective\nbenefits that arise in the political arena generally thus also arise\nfor public health. It is in this context that concerns about the\nlegitimacy of public health interventions and paternalism typically\nemerge \u2013 concerns we return to in Section 3.\n1.3 Concluding Remarks\n\nCommon to both features of public health is the question of how\nbroadly or narrowly to understand what public health entails (Powers\nand Faden 2006; Coggon 2012; Anomaly 2011; Dees 2018). In many\nnational contexts, there is no sharp divide between what some consider\nthe traditional functions of public health, such as ensuring that the\nwater and food supply are safe, protecting the public from infectious\ndisease, and health promotion, and the organization and financing of\npersonal medical care services. This is especially the case when the\nprovision or financing of personal medical care is solely or primarily\na state function. In the bioethics literature, the ethics of health\ncare policy is sometimes distinguished from the ethics of public\nhealth. As we will see in Section 2, much of the literature on justice\nand health has focused on medical care and the criteria that should be\nused to determine coverage decisions about specific personal medical\ncare interventions that are delivered to individual patients in\nclinical facilities. One way to think about this is to conceptualize\nthe ethics of health care policy as an intersecting territory between\npublic health ethics and the ethics of clinical practice. Although we\nhave focused in this section on two features of public health that\ndistinguish it from clinical care, it is worth noting that there are\nthese intersecting territories and that they have implications for\npublic health ethics. For example, in the many contexts where\ngovernment agencies have ultimate authority over what medical care\nservices patients can receive, the ethics of coverage decisions must\ntake account of their impact on the ethics of the doctor-patient\nrelationship in addition to efficiency and other considerations of\njustice that public health allocation decisions standardly engage.\n\n\nThere are also intersecting territories between public health and\nbiomedical science, again with implications for public health ethics.\nFor example, advances in AI-assisted big data analysis, genomic\ndatabase, and gene editing offer potentially unprecedented\nopportunities for public health to better predict and respond to\nhealth threats. (Geller et al., 2014) Questions are emerging about\nwhether the use of these scientific advances in service of public\nhealth adds anything new or different from the ways in which the\nlegitimacy issues discussed in Section 3 should be evaluated.\n\nThat there are overlapping territories between public health, clinical\ncare and biomedical science is, of course, to be expected as these\nenterprises are all committed to advancing human health. The major\nchallenge is to answer the question of how broadly or narrowly to\nunderstand what public health entails. Given a wide understanding of\nhealth and the factors affecting prospects for population health,\npublic health can be viewed as being so expansive as to have no\nmeaningful institutional, disciplinary, or social boundaries.\nEverything from crime, war, and natural disasters; to population\ngenetics, environmental hazards, marketing and other corporate\npractices; to political oppression, income inequality, and individual\nbehavior has been claimed under the rubric of public health. Although\nall of these threats to human well-being affect health, it would be\nhard to conceptualize public health as encompassing all of the\nsocietal resources that these threats demand for their mitigation. For\nexample, while reducing violence is critical to population health,\nthat does not mean that law enforcement, the criminal justice system,\ndiplomacy and international relations should be considered tools of\npublic health.\n\nWhether or under what conditions it is ethically appropriate to frame\nor re-frame a social problem in public health terms is morally\ncomplex. For example, taking a public health rather than criminal\njustice orientation to gun violence or substance abuse can sometimes\ncontribute to defusing tensions, decreasing negative impacts on racial\nor other minority groups, and leading to better overall outcomes\n(Dorfman and Wallack 2009). At the same time, however, interventions\ngenerally outside the purview of public health institutions and\nprofessionals such as early childhood education, income supports,\nliteracy initiatives for girls, and safe housing programs all can be\neffective in preventing illness and injury. In some cases, such\ninterventions may be more effective and efficient in achieving health\ngains than paradigmatic public health programs.\n\nMorally responsible public health policy requires attentiveness to the\nmultiple determinants of health. This requirement does not signal that\npublic health has no boundaries. Rather, public health has a unique\nrelationship of stewardship to health, and to the particular\ndeterminants that have a special strategic significance for health.\nSome of those determinants are the classic focus of public health,\nsuch as infectious disease control and the securing of safe food,\nwater, and essential medications. However, exercising that stewardship\nrequires responsiveness to the best available evidence about all the\ndeterminants, across the landscape of an interconnected social\nstructure, that have a special strategic relation to health. These\ndeterminants often lie outside the conventional remits of public\nhealth agencies and authorities. Policies governing education, foreign\nassistance, agriculture, and the environment can all have a\nsignificant impact on health, just as health policies can impact\ninternational relations and national and global economies. \n\nOne worry raised by this interconnectedness across spheres of social\nlife and policy is that classifying something as a public health\nmatter could be an effective way of taking it out of the realm of\nlegitimate discussion. (Anomaly 2011; Coggon 2012) If the goal of\nprotecting public health is seen as clearly good, government actions\naimed at securing health may be less scrutinized than actions aimed at\nmore controversial ends, leaving public health officials with too much\npower and too little democratic accountability. As a practical matter,\nhowever, these concerns may not be realistic. Consider the recent\nexample of climate change. Early in 2020, the American Medical\nAssociation and 23 other health and medical organizations sent a\nletter to the President of the United States calling climate change a\npublic health emergency and declaring that \u201cthere is no single\nstep that will do more for the health of all Americans than remaining\nin and meeting our obligations to the Paris Climate Agreement.\u201d\n(Robeznieks 2020) It seems unlikely that framing climate change as a\npublic health crisis risks taking climate policy out of the realm of\nlegitimate discussion. Indeed, although data on this point are hard to\ncome by, it is likely that the reverse is true: public health agencies\nand workers are more likely to have insufficient political power,\nauthority, and resources at their disposal to achieve important and\npressing goals than to wield too much. It is not usually individuals\u2019\ncivil rights to which public health interventions stand in opposition,\nbut rather private, corporate economic interests such as the tobacco\nindustry, the meat and dairy industry, and so on. Nonetheless, it is\nworth raising these worries at least to keep them in view as a\npossible issue for public health ethics to address. And even if the\nworry that expanding the classification of something as a public\nhealth matter in some way threatens civil liberties is nothing more\nthan fear-mongering, the breadth of what falls under public health may\nraise concerns about legitimacy, concerns taken up Section 3. But\nfirst, we turn to questions about justice in public health of the sort\npresaged in our discussion of the first distinctive characteristic of\npublic health, its focus on the health of populations, not\nindividuals.\n2. Justice and Public Health\n\nMany familiar debates between utilitarian and various egalitarian\napproaches to distributional questions play themselves out in public\nhealth. Public health professionals and policymakers are typically\ncommitted to bringing about as much health as possible with the\nresources available. This interpretation of the remit and\nresponsibility of public health is understandable, and in many\nrespects, laudable. There is no context in public health in which\nresources are unlimited, or even sufficient to bring about all the\nhealth that might be secured. Efficiency in the use of constrained\nresources, especially public resources, is clearly morally important,\nif not imperative. And from the perspective of some utilitarian\naccounts, maximizing the amount of net good, in this case, health,\nthat can be secured is also the only just way to deploy resources.\n(See, for instance, the entry on\n justice.)\n\nPublic health professionals and policymakers are well aware, however,\nof concerns that the health maximizing approach to public health can\noften perpetuate and even exacerbate existing injustices in health and\nhuman well-being. At least since the 1990s, ethics scholars have\nchallenged public health to look beyond efficiency to address other,\ngenerally egalitarian concerns of justice. Activists concerned about\nracial, gender and other social group injustices also frequently call\non public health institutions to pursue health equity, particularly by\nreducing what are viewed as unjust health disparities.\n\nTensions between efficiency and egalitarian commitments arise in two\nstage-setting public health functions: the establishing of goals and\npriorities, for example, when the US Department of Health and Human\nServices sets goals and objectives to improve the health and\nwell-being of people in the United States in its Healthy People\nInitiative, and the allocating of resources that have been budgeted to\nsecure the goals that have been identified, for example, how to\ndistribute the funds that are allocated to the goal of reducing\ncardiovascular deaths. As important as setting goals and allocating\nresources are, there are other questions in public health ethics that\nalso engage considerations of justice but that are not centrally\nstructured around tensions between efficiency and equity. These\ninclude the moral value of prevention, the moral responsibility of\nindividuals for their health, and stigma in public health programming.\nPublic health also affects other things that matter morally to people,\nlike respectful treatment, personal security or personal relations.\nDepending on how one understands what social or structural justice\nentails, these other considerations may be matters of justice, or even\nin some cases of state legitimacy, but they are not typical of matters\ntaken up in either literatures.\n\nSection 2.1 begins with a review of different reasons that have been\nput forward for why health matters morally, and thus why health is or\nmight be a matter of justice. Section 2.2 discusses general problems\nof aggregation, goal setting and resource allocation. Sections 2.3\ntakes on distinctive moral issues that arise due to public\nhealth\u2019s emphasis on prevention, and sections 2.4 and 2.5 take\non individual responsibility and stigma, respectively, as well as some\nother examples where public health\u2019s engagement with justice\ngoes to impacts that are not primarily health. (For instance, stigma\ncan be conceptualized as a concern about social disrespect). Section\n2.6 concludes with a brief review of global justice considerations.\n\n2.1 The Value of Health: Why Health Matters Morally\n\nTheories of justice relevant to public health ethics operate with\naccounts of the value of health that often mark key differences\nbetween\n them.[4]\n In the case of utilitarian theorists, the value of health is often\nunderstood implicitly in terms of the contribution that health makes\nto utility or welfare. All health benefits are seen as contributing to\nwelfare and all harms to health as diminishing welfare. How health\nbenefits and harms should be conceptualized and therefore measured is\na matter of debate, as is the case with the parent categories of\nutility and welfare, more generally. We will briefly review some of\nthe health-specific debates in Section 2.2.\n\nEgalitarian theories of justice, including those most relevant to\npublic health ethics, continue to be profoundly influenced by Rawls.\n(See Rawls 1971, and the entry on\n John Rawls.)\n Health does not figure prominently in Rawls\u2019 celebrated theory\nand is not included by him as a social primary good. (Rawls 1971, 62)\nOther theorists have, however, pursued what they understand to be the\nimplications of Rawls\u2019s theory for health policy and public\nhealth. The most sustained and notable development of Rawlsian thought\ncomes from Norman Daniels. Daniels argues that the value of health as\nit matters to justice can be found in its critical connection to\nRawls\u2019 principle of \u201cfair equality of opportunity,\u201d\nwhich for Rawls centers on social offices and positions. Daniels\nmaintains that health is of special importance to this principle. On\nthis view, enjoying health up to some threshold is integral for each\nto have a \u2018normal opportunity range,\u2019 or the array of life\nplans reasonable persons are likely to develop for themselves within a\nparticular society (Daniels 2008, p. 43). Thus, Daniels attempts to\naccount for the moral significance of health, including public health,\nin terms of its connection to opportunities rather than to welfare\n(Daniels 1985; 2001; 2008). In other words, on this sort of view,\nhealth is a matter of justice because of its integral role in allowing\nus or, in the case of ill health, preventing us from pursuing what we,\nas a matter of justice, should be able to pursue.\n\nIn part in response to Rawls, Amartya Sen pioneered an alternative\napproach to justice, which has as its central focus the ability and\npower of individuals \u2013 their capabilities \u2013 to reach\nstates of valuable functioning or well-being. Capability theory is\nconcerned with the freedom of individuals to pursue these states; the\njustice of social systems is to be judged by the extent to which this\nfreedom to be and do is promoted for all, a distinctly egalitarian\ncommitment. (See the entry on\n the capability approach.)\n The most prominent capability approach to justice, and one with\ndirect relevance to public health, is that of Martha Nussbaum.\nNussbaum identifies ten central human capabilities that a just society\nshould make available to its citizens. Bodily health is included\nwithin the ten, as is life, which she defines as \u201cbeing able to\nlive to the end of a human life of normal length; not dying\nprematurely, or before one\u2019s life is so reduced as to be not\nworth living\u201d (Nussbaum 2006, 76). Health is understood as\nnecessary or partly constitutive of human dignity or a flourishing\nhuman life. For Nussbaum and other capability theorists, the\ncapability for health is thus of direct importance to justice, and not\nas it is for Daniels, for whom health is of strategic importance to\nfair opportunity.\n\nPowers and Faden have developed a different theory of structural\njustice that, like Nussbaum\u2019s capability theory, also sees\nhealth as a direct matter of justice. However, while Nussbaum focuses\non health capabilities, Powers and Faden focus on health itself. Their\ntheory is anchored in an account of human well-being in which health\nis one of six core elements. Each element is defended because it is\ncharacteristically present in a decent human life and because it\nrequires an appropriate social structure for its secure realization\nand cannot be experienced by individuals relying solely on their own\nefforts. Powers\u2019 and Faden\u2019s egalitarian commitments are\nevidenced in their view that structural justice entails ensuring that\nall individuals, globally, experience these six well-being elements\nand the human rights that are grounded in them, commensurate with a\ndecent human life. They are also reflected in the theory\u2019s focal\nconcern with unfair relations of power and advantage as well as with\nhuman rights and with the intimate relationship between unfairness,\nwell-being and human rights. (Powers and Faden 2019) Much of their\ntheory is taken up with interconnections between these moving parts of\nstructural injustice. Their view that a deprivation in one core\nelement of well-being like health is likely both a cause and a\nconsequence of deprivations in other elements of well-being has direct\nimplications for public health policy. So, too, does their view that\nunfair patterns of disadvantage and unfair power relations are a\npowerful driver of deprivations and human rights violations, which in\nturn usher in and exacerbate these forms of structural unfairness.\n\nEach of these different ways of explicating why health is a matter of\njustice \u2013 because health contributes to overall utility or\nwelfare, because of its strategic importance to fair opportunity,\nbecause it is a central human capability, or because health is a core\nelement of human well-being \u2013 provide reasons why national and\nglobal policy-setting structures should place a priority on\nhealth. Each provides justifications, some overlapping and some\ndistinctive, for extensive collective investment in public health\nservices and practices. They also have different implications for\npublic health policy. For example, arguments from fair opportunity\nunderscore the importance of, and arguably prioritize, interventions\nthat will protect or restore aspects of health that relate to normal\nopportunity ranges and societal prospects. Theories that focus on\ncapabilities for health and those that focus on securing health may\nhave different implications for how public health institutions should\nset targets and priorities, and certainly for how health policies\nshould be evaluated.  And theories that advocate for the\ninterconnectedness of health with other valued human states suggest a\nwider range of relevant outcomes for public health and public health\nethics than theories that focus only on health. And each is open, in\none way or another, to the familiar criticisms of utilitarian,\nRawlsian, capability and well-being theories.\n\nYet another approach to articulating the value of health, and thus of\npublic health, is found in the health and human rights literature\n(see Mann et al. 1994; Mann 1996; Beyrer et al. 2007; Beyrer and Pizer\n2007; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015a; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015b; Gostin and\nFriedman 2013). In the early 1990s, Jonathan Mann pioneered an\napproach to public health that explicitly framed health as a human\nrights issue, and human rights violations as public health issues.\nSubsequent work in the health and human rights tradition has been\ndominated by scholars and advocates in health law and public health\npractice, with strong links to activist and humanitarian\norganizations. (Gostin 2008, 2010) As a general matter, the health and\nhuman rights tradition relies on international declarations of human\nrights and human rights law as its foundation and does not probe the\nphilosophical underpinnings of human rights or their connection to\ntheories of justice. This is not because philosophical accounts of\nhuman rights are not congenial to the inclusion of health as a basic\nhuman right, however. Quite the opposite. Multiple rival candidates\nfor the justification of human rights, from interest-based theories\n(Powers and Faden 2019; Raz 1988; Griffin 2008; Beitz 2015) to\ncontrol-based theories (Darwall 2006; Hart 1982) to dignity-based\ntheories (Kamm 2007; Tasioulas 2015), can be interpreted to support\nthe inclusion of health as a human right. (See the entry on\n human rights.)\n Regardless of one\u2019s explanation of the grounds of human rights,\nby claiming that individuals have a human right to health, health is\nmade a matter of justice, since each individual has an entitlement to\nhealth. Moreover, framing health as a human right is appealing in the\ncontext of discussions of public health ethics because this framing\nprovides a basis for making states, as the first guarantors of human\nrights, responsible for promoting and protecting the health of\nindividuals residing within their jurisdictions. However, just as\napproaching the value of health from the standpoint of different\ntheories of justice is open to the general criticisms associated with\neach theory, so accounting for health in terms of human rights is open\nto the broad challenges that apply to accounts of human rights more\ngenerally (Buchanan 2012; Sreenivasan 2012)\n2.2 Aggregation, Goal Setting and Resource Allocation\n\nAs we noted in Section 1.1, a defining characteristic of public health\nis that it is committed to advancing health at the level of\npopulations. Public health relies on aggregated measures of health to\nidentify health deficits, set health policy priorities, assess the\nimpact of interventions, and allocate resources. It is this reliance\non aggregation that sets the stage for numerous questions of justice\nin public health, including perhaps most prominently tensions between\negalitarian approaches to justice and efficiency-oriented utilitarian\napproaches.\n2.2.1 Justice and Natural Units Measures of Population Health\n\nAlthough many challenges in aggregation taken up in the justice and\npublic health literature relate to or are compounded by the way\nsummary measures of health are constructed and deployed, even the\nsimplest of health measures, once aggregated, raise justice concerns.\nTraditionally in public health, and still today, health outcomes are\noften measured in what are sometimes called natural units; examples\ninclude life expectancy, mortality, five-year survival, and\nimmunization rates. These natural units are typically expressed in\nterms of averages, as in average life expectancy of American men,\nalthough sometimes medians or other ways of presenting the data are\nused. The problem is that, aggregated over a population, any of these\nnatural measures can obscure differences within the population that\nare morally relevant. To continue with the example of average life\nexpectancy of American men, focusing only on that measure obscures\ndifferences between white men and men of color, rural and urban men,\nand poorly and well-educated men that many view as mattering morally,\nand as potential injustices. Reliance on average summary measures of\nthings like income or education can also have implications for public\nhealth ethics. To take a classic example, averaged national income\ndata have been used as the basis for determining which countries are\neligible for international philanthropic assistance in accessing\nlifesaving vaccines. Because this approach resulted in the withholding\nof global vaccine aid from middle-income countries, it was criticized\nas perpetuating injustices. In middle-income countries with large\nincome inequalities, average income data obscured truly disadvantaged\nsub-populations who were not likely to receive the vaccine without\nglobal assistance. (Shebaya, Sutherland, Levine, and Faden 2010) One\njob of public health ethics is to stay attuned to the risk that\naveraged outcome measures and statistics can mask differences between\nsubgroups within a population that point to unjust inequalities in\nneed of redress.\n\nAt the same time, whether or how much group differences in aggregated\nnatural measures of health matter morally is not necessarily obvious\nand may depend on the account of justice under\n consideration.[5]\n Any sub-group difference in a natural measure of health suggests that\nit may be possible to secure more health for more people than is\ncurrently the case, a goal underscored by the public health\u2019s\nutilitarian commitments. However, whether any group difference is also\nunjust from an egalitarian perspective cannot be read off of the\nexistence or even the size of a between-group disparity. Theories of\njustice, or more directly accounts of injustice, are needed to fill in\nthe gap between observing an inequality in health between groups and\ndeciding whether or how egregiously the inequality constitutes an\ninjustice. (Powers and Faden 2006, pp. 95\u201399)\n2.2.2 Justice and Summary Measures of Population Health\n\nFrom the standpoint of public health policymaking, there are several\nother problems with natural measures of population health, like life\nexpectancy or infant survival rates. These measures cannot provide a\nsummary picture of the overall state of health or burden of ill health\nof a population, nor do they allow for comparison of the value or\nimpact of alternative investments in different health priorities. The\nlatter is a particular problem for allocating health budgets and\nsetting priorities for funding. Although classic cost-benefit analysis\nprovides a solution that admits of comparisons across diverse health\nareas and outcomes, reducing all the benefits and risks at issue in\npublic health to their monetary value is widely viewed as\nunsatisfactory. In response, a series of summary measures of\npopulation health have been developed that seek to reduce into one\nfungible metric both life expectancy and considerations of impact of\ndisease and of medical interventions on function and disability.\nOperating out of the preference-satisfaction tradition, well-known\nsummary metrics include Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs),\nDisability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Disability-Adjusted Life\nExpectancy (DALE) and Healthy Life Year (HeaLY). Summary measures have\nbeen subject to extensive ethics critique. (See the entry on\n disability and health care rationing.)\n Some of these criticisms reflect difficulties with conceptualizing\nand operationalizing utility accounts of welfare. For example, these\nmeasures sometimes rely on assessments of what may be only vague\nindividual preferences for trade-offs between different states of\nhealth or different kinds of benefits, or trade-offs made by samples\nof persons that are viewed as too narrow. These summary measures have\nalso been critiqued to the extent that they rely on average trade-off\nassessments that may mask wide disagreement about the disvalue of a\ncompromised health state.\n\nOther criticisms focus on different, egalitarian-oriented justice\nconcerns about morally contentious assumptions embedded in the\nmeasures, including whether to differentially value years saved in\ndifferent stages of life and how to disvalue specific disabilities.\nDepending on how these and other assumptions are determined and\nspecified, summary health measures have been criticized as being\nageist or not ageist enough, as discriminating unfairly against people\nwith disabilities, as failing to capture the moral uniqueness of\nlifesaving, and as treating as commensurable qualitatively different\nlosses and benefits. (Brock 2002, 2006; Daniels 2008; Kappel and\nSandoe 1992; Nord 2005; Powers and Faden 2006; Ubel 1999; Williams\n2001; Whitehead and Ali 2010; Soares 2012; Pettit et al. 2016;\nSchroeder 2017).\n\nA particularly influential deployment of the DALY summary measure of\npopulation health is the Burden of Disease Project. Supported by the\nWorld Health Organization, national burden of disease studies are\nconducted in many nations and are widely relied on to help\ncharacterize the state of ill health globally as well as within\ncountries. Ethical concerns about DALYs and global disease studies,\noften discussed in the public health literature under the heading of\nsocial issues, include whether DALYs should be age-weighted or\ntime-discounted. Because the results of global burden of disease\nstudies can be influential in the setting of health priorities, they\nillustrate well the importance of the ethics of summary measures in\npublic health practice. \n2.2.3 Efficiency vs. Equity\n\nMuch of the literature in public health ethics that has addressed\nsummary measures has looked at their role in cost-utility\n analysis.[6]\n In cost-utility analysis, a summary measure is used to identify how\nto secure the most health for the resources available. The goal is to\nestablish comparative value for money, with an eye to ensuring\nefficiency in resource allocation. In addition to ethical concerns\nabout the construction of summary measures and the assumptions on\nwhich they are built, cost-utility analysis raises additional concerns\nof justice because it, like cost-benefit analysis and utilitarian\ntheorizing more generally, is indifferent to questions of\ndistribution. As a contingent matter, it is often the case that public\nhealth interventions that are good value-for-money advance the health\nof disadvantaged groups relative to their powerful counterparts. This\nis because a little money can often go a long way towards improving\nthe health of those who have relatively little and whose health\nprospects are bleak. Consider, for example, investing in childhood\nimmunizations and vitamin supplementation in low- and middle-income\ncountries. That said, the worry remains that when public health policy\nrests on cost-utility analyses, the resultant priorities or\nallocations may entail injustices of various sorts. For example,\npolicymaking that is mainly or largely driven by cost-utility findings\nmay perpetuate or even exacerbate existing unjust health disparities\nwhen health gains are more efficiently secured for those who are\nbetter off or fail to treat fairly the needs of persons with rare\ndiseases, diseases with poor outcomes, and diseases that are very\nexpensive to prevent or treat.\n\nIn large part in response to these difficulties with cost-benefit\nanalysis and treating maximization as the relevant principle, scholars\nin public health ethics have defended alternative principles of\ndistribution. These principles mirror familiar debates in the\nliterature on distributive justice. Although some theorists argue for\nsome form of equality in the distribution of health-related resources\n(Marmot 2005; Wilkinson 2005), including equality of opportunities\n(Daniels 2004, 2008), much of the literature is taken up with debates\nbetween prioritarianism and sufficientarianism. Defenders of\nprioritarianism claim that while the overall goal of distribution\nshould be the promotion of the health of the population, extra\nweighting or priority should be placed on the distributing resources\nin ways that promote the health needs of those who are worst-off\n(Parfit 1997; Ottersen et al. 2008; Ottersen, M\u00e6stad, and\nNorheim, 2014). How to conceptualize who the worst-off are for\npurposes of public health policymaking remains contested territory. By\ncontrast, those defending sufficientarianism maintain that a\npreferable distributional principle for health resources is helping to\nensure that all persons experience or can achieve a certain threshold\nof health or health capabilities (see Nussbaum 2006; Powers and Faden\n2006; Fourie and Rid 2017). On this view, a world in which everyone\nreaches a threshold for health capabilities or health states is more\njust than a world in which average population health exceeds that\nthreshold but some subgroups do not reach it. A challenge here is\nconceptualizing and then operationalizing how much health or health\ncapability counts as sufficient.\n\nThe challenges posed by the efficiency vs. equity tension in public\nhealth cannot be overstated (Daniels 2019). For example, in the United\nStates, infant mortality rates are higher than in many other wealthy\nnations, and they are higher still among poor and minority children.\nSome state public health authorities have made reducing racial\ndisparities in infant mortality a top priority, accepting the view\nthat redressing this unjust inequality is an urgent moral concern.\nOther states have chosen the goal of improving infant survival\nstatistics overall, on the grounds that the same resources will\nproduce greater aggregate health outcomes while at the same time\npointing to the special place that all children should hold in public\nhealth policy (HRSA 2014 in Other Internet Resources). It is not clear\nthat theorizing about just distribution in health does or could\nprovide definitive guidance as to which policy is more just.\n\nEquity and efficiency frequently sit side by side in public health\npolicymaking. Countries often explicitly include a range of diverse\nhealth equity objectives in national public health goals (Krubiner and\nFaden 2017). Several approaches have been put forward to assist\npolicymakers who do not want to lose sight of these objectives as they\nalso aim to be efficient in the use of the limited resources available\nfor population health. One major concern is that cost-utility and\ncost-effectiveness can have an outsized influence on policymaking\nbecause the quantitative character of their results convey a kind of\npseudo-scientific certainty or otherwise seem to provide an\nevidence-based grounding for what policymakers should do. To combat\nthis concern, which of course is a risk in policymaking generally,\nsome have argued the importance of treating CEA and CUA findings only\nas aids to decision-making that policymakers should take into account,\nbut always in concert with other sources of relevant information,\nincluding explicit ethics analysis.\n\nSeveral ethics frameworks directed at assisting policymakers in taking\nthis broader perspective attempt to incorporate both value-for-money\nand other justice-based commitments in one guidance document (see\nOttersen et al. 2014). Relatedly, there is increasing interest in\nmulti-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in public health, a formalized\nmethodology in the operations research tradition that allows for\nsystematic attention to a range of considerations inclusive of both\nefficiency and equity criteria. There is also continuing interest in\nincorporating equity- based concerns directly into formal economic\nmethods, sometimes referred to as cost-value analysis. (Distefano and\nLevin 2019) Each of these different strategies to blunting the\ninfluence of cost-utility analysis in the service of more just\npolicymaking is subject to different criticisms. For example,\nstrategies that emphasize underscoring to policymakers that they\nbroaden their scope of relevant inputs, including with the aid of\npurpose-built ethics frameworks, are challenged for failing to\nappreciate how numbers-oriented policymaking actually is. Conversely,\nstrategies that incorporate empiricized versions of ethical\nconsiderations into economic methods and some quantitative MCDA\napproaches are open to critiques about making commensurable that which\nis not, and also obscuring from political and public view what is\nmorally at stake, including where there are moral disagreements that\nbear on the policy decision.\n2.2.4 Absolute Scarcity\n\nAs we have already noted, financial resources are always limited in\npublic health. There is never enough money in the public health sector\nto pursue all the policies and practices that could advance population\nhealth. Although arguably a redistribution of resources among\ncompeting public sectors, for example from a country\u2019s defense\nbudget to its health budget, may be ethically warranted and could\nrelieve some of the more pressing constraints, tough priority setting\nand allocation decisions are a constant feature of policymaking in\npublic health and are likely ineliminable. There are also occasions in\npublic health, however, when money is not the primary constraint and\nquestions of just distribution can take on somewhat different\nfeatures. Sometimes referred to as cases of absolute scarcity or of\nextreme rationing, an urgently needed intervention is in short supply,\nand the supply problem cannot be fixed in real-time simply by\nallocating more money to the\n problem.[7]\n A classic example is countermeasures for epidemic diseases, where\nproduction of the countermeasure, typically a vaccine, lags behind the\nneed. In these cases, standard debates between efficiency and various\nalternative distributive principles can take on new twists or are\naugmented by appeals to somewhat different principles. For example,\nwhen epidemic vaccines are in short supply many judge that health\nprofessionals and other first responders should enjoy high priority\nfor receiving a vaccine. The rationale for this position appeals to a\nmix of utilitarian and non-utilitarian reasons. Some see the relevant\ndistributive principle to be a combination of contribution and\nreciprocity; because these people are putting themselves at increased\nrisk of acquiring the infection, literally putting their lives on the\nline for others, first responders are entitled to special\nconsideration in access to preventive interventions. At the same time,\nthe argument is also made that the public health system needs these\nexperts to be both willing and able to perform their duties and thus\nthat it is important to use guaranteed access to a scarce vaccine to\nboth incentivize first responders to work on the public\u2019s behalf\nand to keep them healthy.\n\nMany cases of absolute scarcity lie at the intersection of public\nhealth and clinical ethics and, depending on the national health\nsystem, maybe more or less under public health authorities to resolve.\nThese include the deployment of antivirals and ICU beds during an\ninfluenza pandemic but also the allocation of solid organs or of\ncancer drugs that are in short supply because of production challenges\n(Unguru et al. 2014). Consider the case of solid organs. Simple\nnotions of fairness might suggest that scarce life-saving organs be\ndistributed randomly among a pool of those in need or on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis (Arras 2005; Broome 1984; Silverman and Chalmers\n2001). However, if, for example, either of these principles resulted\nin an 85-year-old being selected over a ten-year-old, objections could\nbe mounted from a utilitarian, QALY or DALY perspective. Objections\ncould also be mounted from what is sometimes called the \u201cfair\ninnings\u201d perspective in which a priority is placed on ensuring\nthat people survive to experience the later stages of life before\nanyone who has already experienced those stages is assisted. Competing\nconcepts of fair chances and just outcomes have dominated this\nliterature, and complex national systems have developed to allocate\nsolid organs that generally rely on a mix of distributive principles.\nThe Complete Lives System is one attempt to integrate several\nprinciples in one general strategy for allocating scarce resources\n(Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009), while other integrated,\nmulti-principle strategies have been proposed for the allocation of\nparticular kinds of scarce resources like ventilators in the context\nof pandemic influenza (Daugherty Biddison et al. 2018).\n2.2.5 Distribution of Health Burdens\n\nThus far, we have focused on questions of justice in priority setting\nand allocation of resources intended to improve health. The\ninterventions the resources support often carry with them harms or\nrisks, but these generally fall on the persons and groups who benefit\nfrom them. However, there are also contexts in public health where the\nbenefits and harms do not fall on the same groups, raising somewhat\ndifferent questions of justice. One example is Japan\u2019s seasonal\ninfluenza immunization policy between 1962 and 1994, where children\nwere immunized against influenza explicitly in order to protect the\nelderly, for whom contracting seasonal flu is more likely to be fatal,\nand immunization more likely to be burdensome (Reichert et al. 2001;\nSugaya 2014). Another example of public health interventions that\nappear to be guided by this reasoning is rubella vaccination. Rubella\nis a disease that causes only mild illness except if contracted by\npregnant women, where rubella can result in miscarriage or serious\nbirth defects. In many countries in the world, children are routinely\nimmunized for the sake of pregnant women and their fetuses (Miller et\nal. 1997; ACIP 2010 in Other Internet Resources). The question raised\nhere is whether it is ethically acceptable for some groups within the\npopulation to be asked or required to take on risks, even minimal\nones, in order to assist other groups in the population who cannot be\ndirectly protected. One argument appeals to reciprocity. In the case\nof rubella immunization, the children vaccinated today were spared the\nrisks of in utero exposure to rubella because children before them\nwere similarly vaccinated. (Of course, this rationale does not apply\nto the very first cohort of children who received the rubella\nvaccine.) Another argument is that the imposition of risk on some in\norder to protect the health of others is justified in order to make\nthe overall distribution of disease burden in the population more\nequitable. This more general argument can explain why individuals are\nsometimes asked to bear public health burdens that do not directly\nbenefit them. However, as with the case of taxes, the question of how\nfar we can go in redistributing health-related burdens will likely\ncontinue to plague any proponent of this justificatory strategy.\nMoreover, questions about the plausibility of viewing health-related\nburdens as subject to distribution in this manner may also arise.\n2.3 Public Health, Prevention, and Justice\n\nA distinct set of questions of justice arises because promoting public\nhealth involves a significant commitment to the prevention of disease\nand injury. This commitment to prevention is often seen as a defining\nfeature of public health institutions, even though public health\nagencies and services also engage in diagnosing and treating\nillnesses, with all the attendant clinical services that those\nactivities\n require.[8]\n Indeed, national health systems are increasingly understood to\ninclude both preventive functions and the delivery of personal medical\nservices. Often these functions and services are integrated under a\ncommon political or administrative structure. Depending on the\nspecific context in which population health is to be promoted,\nseparating population health services and functions from personal\nmedical care services and functions may or may not make sense. That\nsaid, policies and programs whose aim is to prevent illness and injury\nare paradigmatically the territory of public health. Certainly, no\nother social institution is recognized as so clearly having this\nremit.\n\nPerhaps the foundational moral question at issue in public\nhealth\u2019s commitment to prevention is whether preventing disease\nand injury is more important, as important or less important than\ntreating disease and injury. If prevention and treatment are morally\nequivalent, such that preventing heart disease in one person is the\nmoral equivalent of treating heart disease in one person, then because\nit is generally cheaper to prevent disease than to treat it,\nprevention would, at least from an ethics standpoint, have a leg up in\nutilitarian accounts of what justice in public health requires.\nHowever, in practice, investments in treatment more often than not\nswamp investments in prevention. We have already noted the ethically\ncomplicated convention in economic analyses of discounting health\nbenefits and costs accrued in the future relative to current health\nbenefits and costs, paralleling the convention of discounting future\nfinancial costs and benefits. But it is not only in economic analyses\nthat this bias exists. Although in recent years there is arguably more\nemphasis on prevention in health policy, preventive public health\ninterventions continue to receive less funding and public support than\nmedical treatments. For example, despite the increasing focus on\nwellness in public policy and the workplace, both policymakers and the\npublic still tend to place a higher priority on ensuring that heart\npatients have access to surgery and medications than on programs to\nprevent heart disease through diet and\n exercise.[9]\n Is this privileging of treatment morally justified?\n\nAnswers to this question typically appeal to several related and\nsometimes conceptually unclear distinctions that are thought to be\nmorally relevant. These include the aforementioned distinction between\nfuture and current costs and benefits, the distinction between\nidentified and unidentified or statistical lives, and the distinction\nbetween currently existing and future persons. The impact of\npreventive interventions is more likely to be experienced in the\nfuture, while the impact of treatment interventions is typically\nexperienced in the near term. Whether people should disvalue future\nbenefits to themselves, relative to current benefits, is not clear.\nBecause current beneficiaries are often identifiable and future\nbeneficiaries typically are not, the differential valuing by\ntemporality is often associated with the distinction between\nidentified and statistical persons. The identified victim effect is\nthe term given to the widely observed psychological phenomenon in\nwhich people have a greater inclination to assist (and avoid harming)\npersons and groups who are known by name or are otherwise identifiable\nthan to assist (and avoid harming) persons and groups who will suffer\n(or already suffer) similar harm but are not (as yet) identifiable to\nthem in any socially meaningful way. These unidentified persons are\nthus \u201cmerely\u201d statistics or statistical lives (pp.1\u20132;\nEyal et al. 2015; Jenni and Lowenstein 1997; Jonsen 1986; McKie and\nRichardson 2003; Small 2015).\n\nThe identified victim effect has clear implications for prevention vs.\ntreatment. Although resources for both treatment and prevention are\nboth generally allocated at the aggregate, population level, treatment\ninterventions are typically delivered to identifiable patients whose\nexperience of benefit will be witnessed by others, including the\nhealth professionals who care for them. By contrast, while prevention\ninterventions may be delivered to identifiable people, as in\nimmunization campaigns, they need not be. Consider, for example,\ninterventions like cigarette taxes that reduce tobacco consumption\namong large numbers of faceless and nameless people. Moreover, even\nwhen the people receiving the prevention intervention are\nidentifiable, as in vaccine campaigns, the identities of the sub-set\nof people who will benefit from the intervention remain unknowable;\nthey are statistical persons.\n\nDiverse moral defenses have been put forward for prioritizing the\nwell-being of identified persons over statistical persons (Hare 2015;\nSlote 2015; Verweij\n 2015),[10]\n and for the closely connected \u201crule of rescue,\u201d a claim\nthat there is a moral imperative to prioritize helping those currently\nin dire\n need.[11]\n These defenses include the moral relevance of saving people from\nimminent death or disability, relieving suffering, and the role\nresponsibilities of clinicians. A distinctive consequentialist\nargument is also made that the welfare of all is enhanced when\neveryone knows that societal resources will be expended to rescue them\nif they are ever so imperiled (McKie and Richardson 2003).\n\nThose who find the identified victim effect ethically as well as\npsychologically compelling and who support the rule of rescue\ngenerally defend the view that public health policy decisions about\nallocation and priority setting should build in a bias in favor of\ntreatment. Others, on the other hand, maintain that we should reject\nthe rule of rescue and should not prioritize or assign greater value\nto identified than to statistical persons (Brock and Wikler, 2006,\n2009; Hope 2001, 2004; Otsuka 2015). For instance, some argue that the\nconsiderations that appear to count in favor of prioritizing\nidentified persons reduce to other moral considerations that apply\nequally to statistical persons \u2013 so prioritizing identified\npersons is, all else equal, unjustified (Brock 2015; Eyal 2015; Jecker\n2013). If this is correct, then the identified victim effect should be\noverlooked when allocating resources or setting priorities. If\nanything, we should worry that to prioritize the health of identified,\ncurrent persons over statistical, future persons fails to treat the\nlatter as moral equals (Jecker 2013,\n 2015).[12]\n\n\nSo far, we have restricted our discussion to already existing persons.\nWhether the benefits accrue in the present or the future, and to\nidentified or statistical persons, the beneficiaries all currently\nexist. A further complication arises when we consider preventive\nmeasures that primarily benefit future persons (Parfit 1987; see also\nthe entry on the\n non-identity problem).\n For instance, the eradication of polio or smallpox provides little\nbenefit to those who have already acquired immunity (either due to\nvaccination or contracting the disease). The primary beneficiaries of\nthese disease eradication programs are both vulnerable existing\npersons and future persons who will be born into a world without these\ndiseases. Indeed, arguments in favor of eradication efforts often\nappeal to the interests of future persons and intergenerational\njustice (Emerson 2010; 2014). Here, familiar questions re-emerge.\nShould we prioritize currently existing (identified or statistical)\npersons over future persons? If so, there are difficult additional\nquestions about how much more weight existing persons should\nreceive.\n\nA somewhat different set of issues emerge when public health efforts\nthat aim to benefit the future require the participation of those who\nare currently suffering from unjust unmet health needs. When, for\nexample, individuals and groups in lower and middle-income countries\nargue that there are more urgent health priorities than eliminating\nvarious diseases, is this just a variant of the failure to properly\nprioritize resources to reduce unjust health inequalities, or is there\nsomething distinctive about the resource allocation going to benefit\nfuture persons or about the involvement of the currently disadvantaged\nin the intervention designed to benefit future persons? (Rubincam and\nNaysmith 2009)\n\nSome but not all of the issues we have thus far reviewed are addressed\nin an influential analysis of questions of justice, prevention and\npublic health by Geoffrey Rose (1985; Rose et al. 2008). Rose\u2019s\nanalysis focuses on the complex relationship between two by now\nfamiliar distinctions (prevention vs. cure or treatment and\nidentifiable vs. statistical beneficiaries), the amount of benefit an\nintervention confers, and on whom, and the cost of the intervention.\nRoss also examines two different approaches to prevention \u2013 the\n\u201chigh-risk strategy\u201d and the \u201cpopulation\napproach.\u201d The high-risk strategy involves identifying\nparticular individuals at heightened risk for some condition, such as\nheart attacks or strokes, and then intervening with various preventive\ntherapies such as statins to lower cholesterol. The population\napproach involves implementing prevention interventions that affect an\nentire population, and not just individuals identified as high risk.\nConsider soda taxes or regulations restricting the use of trans fats\nin processed foods. Rose articulates what he calls the\n\u2018prevention paradox\u2019: when compared to high-risk strategy\ninterventions, population-wide interventions often afford relatively\nsmall benefits to each individual. However, although these\ninterventions only slightly decrease each individual\u2019s risk,\naggregating this small benefit for each member of a very large\npopulation adds up to a very large benefit to population health that\nis sometimes larger and more efficiently secured than with an\nalternative, high-risk strategy (Rose 1985, 1993; Rose et al. 2008).\nThe extent to which we should prioritize the population approach will\ndepend on how one answers the questions discussed in this section\n\u2013 about statistical versus identified lives, the rule of rescue,\nand the standing of future persons.\n2.4 The Relevance, Or Not, of Individual Responsibility\n\nAs we have already noted, not all issues of justice in public health\nare captured by challenges in the setting of priorities or the\nallocation of resources. One persistent issue concerns the extent to\nwhich individuals should be held responsible for their health. For\ninstance, various luck egalitarians argue that people should be\ncompensated for brute luck or various factors outside of their control\nbut should not be compensated for the choices within their control\n(Albertsen 2015; see also the entry on\n justice and bad luck).\n One apparent implication of (unsophisticated) forms of luck\negalitarianism, then, is that individuals are not entitled to the\nresources needed to prevent or treat ill health that is the result of\ntheir own behavior. Instead, when the bad health of some or all of the\npublic is due to an aggregation of self-harming and irresponsible\nchoices, it could be argued that any related public health efforts are\nbetter understood as a matter of beneficence rather than justice, and\nthat justice does not require public health attend to various health\nconditions caused by irresponsible choice. Of course, many luck\negalitarians argue that their view does not yield this implication\n(see Albertsen 2015; Knight 2015; Segall 2010). Nonetheless, this\nobjection to unsophisticated forms of luck egalitarianism is\ninformative, insofar as it reflects a general tension between notions\nof individual responsibility and the appropriate role of public\nhealth.\n\nFraming public health interventions as a matter of beneficence and not\njustice is but one response to self-imposed risks to health. Some go\nfurther and argue that because individuals who engage in self-harming\nbehavior impose costs on the rest of us, as a matter of justice, the\nindividuals who make such choices ought to have to pay to offset these\nextra costs. The kinds of costs of concern include imposing burdens on\npublic health resources that distract from other, more worthy health\nneeds, draining emergency medical services, and increasing medical\ncare costs and health insurance premiums. Cigarette smoking is one\narena where this debate has played itself out. It has been argued, for\nexample, that smokers should pay for the costs they impose on others\nthrough taxes on cigarettes pegged to defray these costs. Another\ntwist on the justice-implications of self-imposed risks focuses on\nrestrictions that can be imposed on risk-takers. For example, some\nproponents of motorcycle helmet laws note that cyclists who ride\nwithout a helmet are more likely to have a serious injury that\nrequires the immediate attention of emergency medical personnel and,\nas a consequence, these experts are not free to provide care to other\nmore prudent patients who are also acutely ill (Bayer and Jones 2007).\nOn this view, mandatory helmet laws, as well as cigarette taxes, are a\nmatter of justice insofar as these policies are aimed at preventing or\noffsetting the costs imposed on the rest of us by those who take\ndiscretionary risks with their health.\n\nMany, however, object to these lines of argument. Some grant that\nindividuals are responsible for their risky health decisions but deny\nthat this licenses the conclusion that justice requires the sorts of\npolicies just described. These critics articulate alternative ways for\npeople to bear the costs of their decisions, including, for example,\nallowing people who engage in risky behaviors to self-insure in some\nway (Flanigan 2014b). A different line of argument, specific to the\nfinancing of health care services, is that the whole purpose of\ncommunity or public support of medical care through health insurance\nschemes or government health care programs is to spread the costs of\nhealth care across the population. These costs should include those\nthat flow from the full range of negative externalities, including\nthose that have their source in what some consider irresponsible,\nrisky behaviors. One way of putting this point is that the entitlement\nto medical care includes medical costs that are incurred by engaging\nin all kinds of behavior, such as working very long hours (Wikler\n1987, 2002). Once the myriad ways in which we impose costs on one\nanother is recognized, this line of argument continues, the focus on\ncertain behaviors is undermotivated or even discriminatory. Indeed, if\nwe look at various behaviors that are often condemned as irresponsible\nhealth decisions in public health policymaking, they are often\nbehaviors associated with disadvantaged or marginalized groups (Wikler\n1987, 2002). For instance, the sugary beverage tax in New York applied\nto soda but not to more expensive but very sugary beverages, such as\nfrappuccinos.\n\nA different concern with arguments that aim to hold individuals\nresponsible for unhealthy choices focuses on the concept of\n\u2018responsibility\u2019 at play, and whether attributions of\nresponsibility are fitting. (Dworkin 1981) Whether, to what extent,\nand in what sense individuals are responsible for risky behaviors is\ncontested at every turn, in part because of both conceptual and\nempirical debates about notions like addiction and voluntariness. For\nyears, scientists and humanists have argued over the concept of\naddiction, and how that concept should play into our views about\nbehaviors like smoking, drinking and the use of drugs. Also thrown\ninto the mix are contested views about the impact on the public of the\nfull force of marketing tools available to industries who peddle\nunhealthy products, and the related imbalance in power and influence\nbetween these industries and the public health institutions that try\nto level the information and influence playing fields.\n\nBut perhaps most fundamental is the mounting epidemiological evidence\nthat unhealthy behaviors are frequently disproportionately represented\nin disadvantaged subgroups of the population. There are many\nstructural explanations why, for example, poor people are more likely\nthan those who are better off to eat poorly, smoke more, exercise less\nand become dependent on drugs and alcohol. As we have already noted,\nmany theorists and activists in public health place a priority,\ngrounded in accounts of the demands of justice, on reducing\ndisparities in health between groups that differ in social and\neconomic advantage and power (Powers and Faden 2006; Venkatapuram\n2019). Indeed, many claim that a central mission of public health is\nto correct for unjust health inequalities (Powers and Faden 2006).\nWhen the root causes of certain unhealthy behaviors are background\ninjustices, responding by imposing additional costs on individuals in\nthose unjust circumstances is perverse and at odds with this central\nmission. (Buchanan 2019,\n Resnik,\u00a02013;\n Arno et\n al.,\u00a01996;\n Hoffman and\n Tan,\u00a02015;\n Nestle and\n Bittman,\u00a02015;\n Pomeranz,\u00a02012.) From this perspective, to penalize\nindividuals who make unhealthy choices due to injustice is to add\ninsult to injury and constitutes victim-blaming.\n\nAs this discussion suggests, much of the work addressing public health\ntakes as its starting point that health-related burdens are often\ncaused by injustices, a point that Margaret-Chen, then\ndirector-general of the WHO, captured well with the following remark:\n\u201cThe social conditions in which people are born, live, and work\nare the single most important determinant of good health or ill\nhealth, of a long and productive life, or a short and miserable\none.\u201d (2008). Inequalities in health frequently exist between\nsocially dominant and socially disadvantaged groups, and they\nfrequently occur in conjunction with other injustices and compound\nthem (Wolff and de-Shalit 2007; Powers and Faden 2006). In many\ncontexts, poverty co-travels with the systematic disadvantage\nassociated with racism, sexism, and other forms of denigrated group\nmembership. However, even when it does not, the dramatic differential\nin material resources, social influence, and social status that is the\nhallmark of severe poverty brings with it systematic patterns of\ndisadvantage that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\nescape. Even when these patterns are lessened, the life prospects of\npersons living in severe poverty or in dominated groups often continue\nto be far below that of others. In light of the connection between\nother forms of injustice and public health inequalities, in\nparticular, some argue that a critical moral function of public health\nis to vigilantly monitor the health of systematically disadvantaged\ngroups and intervene to reduce the inequalities so-identified as\naggressively as possible. Keeping obligations to such groups at the\nforefront of public health thinking can result in significant changes\nin public health policy.\n\nThe final difficulties for trying to formulate policy that compensates\npeople for bad luck but not for irresponsible decisions are epistemic\nand practical. Even if one grants that there are cases where\nindividuals should be held responsible for engaging in unhealthy\nbehaviors by holding them to book for the costs of their behavior or\ndenying them certain interventions, the fact that many health\nconditions are multi-factorial in their causal origins poses\nsignificant epistemic challenges for formulating responsive public\npolicies. Take lung cancer, for example. There are many people who\nsmoke who do not develop lung cancer and many who have never smoked\nthat do. It is daunting to envision determining for an individual\nperson, let alone groups of people, what causal role risky behavior\nplayed in their becoming ill. Moreover, even if this epistemic\ndifficulty could be resolved, it remains the case that public health\npolicy, like all public policy, is a blunt instrument. We should worry\nthat public health policies that try to ensure that individuals pay\nfor their own irresponsible choices will often fail to penalize\nirresponsible behavior, or, more worrisomely, penalize individuals who\nshould not be held responsible for their ill health. \n2.5 Justice and Stigma\n\nAs we noted in sections 2.3 and 2.4, not all issues of justice in\npublic health are captured by challenges in the setting of priorities\nor the allocation of resources. What to do about individual\nresponsibility is one such issue; another is whether some public\nhealth interventions unfairly stigmatize certain groups. There are\nlots of ways to think about stigmatization, but at its core to\nstigmatize is to deem some characteristic or behavior of others as\nfalling short of communal norms of desirability (see Courtwright 2011;\nBayer 2008; Burris 2008; Link and Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, and Link\n2013). Typically, stigmatization has a distinctive set of negative\nconsequences, especially loss of social status and social\nisolation. Many claim that to stigmatize someone is morally wrong\nbecause of the harms stigmatization causes. Depending on your account\nof justice, stigmatization can also be unjust, particularly when the\nstigmatizing actor is the state or some other powerful institutions or\nagents.  Stigmatizing by powerful actors can reinforce structural\npatterns of disadvantage and unfair power relations, and it can also\nfail to treat members of stigmatized groups as moral equals (Powers\nand Faden 2019, 35\u201336).\n\nConcerns about stigmatization in public health can emerge in a range\nof public health policies, including when some groups are identified\nas \u201cat increased risk\u201d for diseases that have socially\ncontentious associations and are themselves stigmatizing. For example,\nalthough itself unfair, in some contexts, people with mental illness\nand AIDs continue to be shunned and worse. Being labeled as at\nincreased risk for these illnesses carries with it the potential for\nstigmatizing effects. Questions about targeting public health\ninterventions become all the more complex when the stigmatizing\neffects would be borne by already disadvantaged groups. On the one\nhand, tailoring a public health program to those who are poor or\nmembers of disadvantaged gender or racial groups can sometimes serve\nequity concerns and be efficient if, for example, the health problem\nthe intervention targets occurs disproportionately in these groups. On\nthe other hand, however, if the health problem is itself associated\nwith stigma or shame, targeting these already disadvantaged groups may\nreinforce existing invidious stereotypes, thereby undermining other\ncritical concerns of justice, such as equality of social respect\n(Powers and Faden 2008). Thus, in cases where interventions will\nincidentally stigmatize already disadvantaged groups, public health\nauthorities face a different kind of efficiency vs. equity challenge\nfrom those already mentioned. They may need to decide whether a\ncommitment to justice requires foregoing a more efficient, targeted\nprogram in favor of a relatively inefficient, universal program that\nmay produce not only less improvement in health for the population as\na whole but also less improvement in health for the disadvantaged\ngroups (thus failing to narrow unjust inequalities) in order to avoid\nexacerbating existing disrespectful social attitudes (Faden, Kass, and\nPowers 1991).\n\nAnother context in which stigma concerns emerge is in public health\neducation campaigns. The methodology for these campaigns often entails\nnot only informing the public about the health risks or benefits of\nparticular behaviors but also changing public attitudes in ways that\ndispose the public to feel more negatively about those who engage or\nfail to engage in them. One way of interpreting what is going on is\nthat an aim of the public health campaign is to shift public values\ntowards the stigmatizing of unhealthy behaviors or ways of life. Some\ncontributors to the public health ethics literature endorse measures\nthat are intended to stigmatize certain unhealthy conduct such as\ncondomless sex, smoking, or various unhealthy eating habits\n(Courtwright 2011; Kim and Shanahan 2003; Brown-Johnson and Prochaska\n2015) or even certain conditions, such as obesity (Callahan 2013). The\nargument in defense of public health implementing interventions that\nintentionally stigmatize turns on several assumptions, including that\nthe public health problem of concern (e.g. obesity) constitutes an\ninjustice and that intentional stigmatization will be very if not\nuniquely effective in reducing the problem and its associated unjust\neffects.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sort of argument is extremely controversial and\nhas led to heated debates. Some object on empirical grounds; for\nexample, that there is insufficient evidence that intentional\nstigmatization is effective at reducing the prevalence of health\nproblems (Goldberg and Puhl 2013) or that there is some evidence to\nsuggest that stigmatization can actually increase the prevalence of a\nconcerning behavior (Goldberg and Puhl 2013; Burris 2008.). Still\nothers object because of the psychological or social harm that is\ncaused to individuals who have the relevant condition or engage in the\nconcerning behavior (Burris 2008; Goldberg and Puhl 2013) or that any\nuse of stigmatization is dehumanizing and morally unacceptable for\nthat reason (Burris 2008). A related objection is that stigmatization\nis reductive; it treats someone as nothing more than a particular\n\u2018spoiled social identity\u2019 \u2013 those who smoke\ncigarettes are thought of as smokers; individuals with obesity are\njust viewed as obese (Burris 2008; Nussbaum 2004).\n\nYet another line of objection engages victim-blaming concerns similar\nto those raised against policies that would penalize those who engage\nin unhealthy behaviors. This objection challenges the arguments in\ndefense of stigma as a public health tool by highlighting that the\nindividuals and groups to be stigmatized are the ones subject to the\ninjustice. In particular, there are significant concerns about whether\nstigmatization involves victim-blaming, encourages a culture of\nvictim-blaming, punishes individuals who are unhealthy because they\nare unjustly socially disadvantaged or for other reasons that are\ncompletely outside their control. As with the debate about individual\nresponsibility, there are often discussions about the underlying\ncauses of the relevant behavior that public health interventions aim\nto prevent. For example, if unjust social structures are a root cause\nof obesity in some group, then encouraging the use of stigmatizing\nmessaging or changing social norms to encourage feelings of shame in\nthose who are or might become obese amounts to shaming people for\nbeing subject to other injustices (Goldberg and Puhl 2013). Similarly,\nto the extent that genetic or metabolic considerations are a root\ncause of obesity in some people, then stigmatizing interventions are\nalso unjust.\n\nAlthough some continue to defend stigmatization in public health\ndespite these objections (Callahan 2013), others have provided more\nmoderate defenses of various stigmatizing measures by emphasizing that\nthere can be morally important differences between different targets\nof stigmatization. So, for instance, campaigns aimed at stigmatizing\ncondom-less sex seem from a justice perspective to be relatively\nunproblematic. This kind of campaign targets a wide range of people\nand groups and does not tightly track social disadvantage. Nor does it\ndehumanize people who have certain illnesses or lifestyles or reduce\nthem to some single feature or condition. Stigmatizing obesity, on the\nother hand, does engage important concerns about justice. Obesity is a\nmedical condition and a bodily characteristic of people rather than a\nbehavior, and even if effective, stigmatizing obesity causes\nsignificant harm to people who are already stigmatized for their size\nin many social contexts (Courtwright 2013).\n2.6 Public Health, Global Concerns, and Global Justice\n\nIt is commonplace and yet correct to say that threats to health know\nno borders and that the promotion of public health requires attention\nbeyond national boundaries. Three types of reasons can be advanced in\nfavor of viewing public health as transcending nation-states:\nself-interest (2.5.1); humanitarian considerations (2.5.2); and\njustice, rights, and duties (2.5.3) (Wolff 2012). Of note, the first\ntwo of these reasons do not originate from the standpoint of justice,\nthough, as we shall see, they engage important questions of justice in\ntheir pursuit. The third set of reasons engages all the issues\ndiscussed thus far in Section 2, and also encounters general debates\nabout the meaning, reach and plausibility of global justice generally\n(Powers and Faden 2019, 145\u2013186; Brock 2013; Miller 2007; see also the\nentries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n global justice).\n2.6.1 Self-Interest and Global Justice\n\nThe paradigmatic example of national self-interest is the motivation\nevery country has to prevent and contain emerging and re-emerging\ninfectious diseases. Outbreaks of these diseases typically occur in\nlow- and middle-income countries, but many have the potential to\nbecome threats to health in other parts of the world. It is in the\ninterests of wealthier nations to provide financial and technical\nsupport to poorer countries to build up their surveillance and rapid\nresponse capabilities, and to provide emergency assistance when\noutbreaks strike. Preventing and containing infectious diseases as\nthey emerge in the global south is an important way for wealthy\ncountries to reduce the likelihood of negative consequences in their\nown backyards.\n\nIt is also in the interests of all nations, but arguably especially\nwealthy nations, to participate in the global sharing of surveillance\ndata about and biosamples of suspect pathogens through mechanisms\nmaintained by the WHO. As we noted in Section 1.1.1, nearly 200\ncountries are signatories to International Health Regulations, which,\namong other things, obligate them to do so. However, it is here that\nserious clashes between self-interest and global justice can emerge.\nShared bio-samples are used to develop vaccines, diagnostics, and\ntreatments that, depending on the context, may be made available first\nor only affordable in higher income countries where these counter\nmeasures will likely be financed and developed. The fairness of this\nstate of affairs was challenged dramatically by Indonesia in January\n2007, when it refused to hand over viral samples during an outbreak of\nH5N1 influenza (bird flu) in that country. Although Indonesia cited\nwhat it viewed as multiple ethical breaches, Indonesia\u2019s main\nobjection was a complaint of injustice that samples provided freely by\nlow- and middle-income countries were used by companies in wealthy\nnations to develop vaccines and other products that developing\ncountries cannot afford (Sedyaningsih et al. 2008). An interesting\ntwist on the justice issues was whether, because the viral samples\nthat would be used by wealthy country companies to develop and produce\nvaccine would be of Indonesian origin, Indonesia had any greater claim\nto the vaccine than other low- and middle-income countries who also\ncould be seriously threatened by H5N1 but had the \u201cbad\nluck\u201d to not be among the first countries to supply viral\nsamples.\n\nSeveral steps have since been taken to address Indonesia\u2019s and\nrelated complaints, including a 2011 WHO framework for the sharing of\ninfluenza viruses and access to vaccines and other counter-measures\n(see World Health Organization 2012 in Other Internet Resources).\nHowever, associated challenges in justice around global biosamples and\nepidemic preparedness and response continue. In 2019, a somewhat\nsimilar claim of exploitation and injustice arose when it was reported\nthat blood samples from patients with Ebola in several West African\ncountries had made their way to laboratories in the US, UK and other\nwealthy nations under conditions that some in West Africa and\nelsewhere considered unfair, exploitative and disrespectful\n(Freudenthal 2019).\n\nIn the context of emerging infections, there is yet another, related\nway in which national self-interest and justice can collide. When the\nburdens of a public health intervention fall heavily on those who are\nalready disadvantaged, the justificatory hurdle is particularly high.\nThis problem regularly emerges in global epidemic preparedness and is\nat the heart of many global justice questions, including most notably\nin environmental justice controversies, such as the locating of\nhazardous waste facilities and hazardous industries in low-income\ncountries, typically in the poorest communities within those\ncountries. (Powers and Faden 2019, 204\u2013206). Because infectious\ndisease threats so often emerge first in poorer countries, global\nefforts to prevent and contain pandemic influenzas can place\nsignificant burdens on the world\u2019s poor and, as we have already noted,\nnot always with sufficient or guaranteed offsetting benefit. For\nexample, a principal strategy employed to prevent avian influenza H5N1\nfrom becoming a human pandemic in the mid-2000s was the destruction\nof infected birds and the banning of household poultry in urban\nsettings in affected countries. This policy was most burdensome for\npoor women and their families who relied on backyard poultry as their\nonly source of disposable income. Because there was often no or little\ncompensation for the losses, they were economically devastated as a\nconsequence (Bellagio Working Group 2007 in Other Internet Resources;\nFaden and Karron 2009; Uscher-Pines, Duggan, Garoon, Karron, and Faden\n2007).\n\nPerhaps most foundationally, the self-interest reason for nations to\nengage globally in public health cannot be separated from questions of\nglobal structural injustice in international relations more broadly.\nMany threats to public health, including the threats from climate\nchange, cannot be effectively addressed absent collective global\naction. However, in today\u2019s global order in which nations differ\ngreatly in wealth and other forms of power, the likelihood that\nagreements and coordinated action will fairly represent and fairly\nprotect the interests of people living in poorer nations is not good.\nIn the case of climate change, although the hottest, poorest, most\nagriculturally dependent countries have contributed the least to\ngreenhouse gas emissions, they are being hurt \u201cfirst and\nworst\u201d by global warming (Powers and Faden 2019, 172\u2013178). And\nyet enforceable requirements to reduce emissions continue to be\nblocked by high emission countries. In infectious disease as well, it\nis typically the poorest countries and the poorest people who are hit\nhardest in outbreaks and epidemics, but their power to influence\nglobal preparedness and response does not match their outsized\nvulnerability.\n2.6.2 Humanitarian Considerations and Global Justice\n\nHumanitarian interventions are among the most visible examples of\nglobal public health in action. These interventions are implemented\nand organized by diverse actors, including NGOs, philanthropies, and\nmultinational organizations like the UN and WHO, often with support\nfrom health and military agencies from diverse countries. One way to\nconceptualize humanitarian interventions is as the public health\nresponse to the general moral position that it is wrong to stand by\nand allow others to suffer in a crisis when we have the resources to\nhelp. Under this framework, we have humanitarian duties or duties of\nbeneficence to help those in desperate circumstances, and those duties\ntranscend national borders. Public health services, material, and\npersonnel are often among the most important responses in humanitarian\ncrises, not only in outbreaks and epidemics but also in natural\ndisasters, wars and violent conflict, displaced populations and mass\nmigrations, famines, and droughts.\n\nCommitments to global humanitarian assistance in public health do not\nentail a commitment to a robust understanding of global justice. Even\ntheorists who are strong statists acknowledge that there are\nobligations of humanitarian assistance to those in dire need in other\ncountries (see, e.g., Cohen and Sabel 2006; the entry on\n international distributive justice).\n This is not to say, however, that there are no moral controversies or\nissues of justice in humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian health\norganizations and health workers are regularly confronted with ethical\nchallenges that include, for example, tensions between humanitarian\nprinciples of impartiality and neutrality and ethical commitments to\nthe just distribution of limited health resources (Broussard et al.\n2019). Looming large over the entirety of humanitarian assistance is\nthe question of whether individuals and especially nations have\nadequately fulfilled their obligations of global humanitarian\nassistance. It is unclear what that question might mean if\nhumanitarian assistance is understood as falling under obligations of\nbeneficence rather than obligations of justice, since obligations of\nbeneficence are less determinate than obligations of justice. Some\naccounts of justice might be interpreted as including duties of\ninternational humanitarian assistance, for example, if these duties\nare considered to fall under minimal global obligations to fulfill\nhuman rights or the threshold in sufficientarian approaches to global\n justice.[13]\n However, these accounts do not provide guidance on what is arguably\nan important global justice question \u2013 whether countries are\ndoing their fair share in humanitarian aid.\n2.6.3 Public Health, Global Justice, Rights, and Duties\n\nAs important as humanitarian assistance is in global public health, it\ncannot even begin to address the central global justice challenge in\npublic health \u2013 the stark differences in health between\npopulations living in wealthy countries and populations living in low\nand some middle-income countries, especially the poorest in these\ncountries. The global justice challenge in health cannot, of course,\nbe separated from the global justice challenge in well-being,\ngenerally. And all the debates in justice theory between strong\nstatists and theorists who defend accounts of utilitarian and\negalitarian transnational obligation are relevant as well. Still,\nthere are some reasons to think that public health, and therefore\npublic health ethics, hold a special and very interesting location\nvis-\u00e0-vis discussions of global justice and our duties to the\ndistant poor (Holland 2007). If nothing else, questions about whether\nthere are duties of justice across national borders occur way too\nfrequently in public health for them to be ignored. Consider just a\nfew.\n\nEven when vaccines are not developed using biosamples sourced from\nlow-income countries, is it just for wealthy countries to produce and\nstockpile only the amount of vaccine needed to protect their own\npopulations when low- and middle-income countries do not have a\ncomparable capacity? While outbreaks rage in poor countries and deaths\nmount, should wealthy countries continue to reserve their entire\nvaccine supply for their own population?\n\nIntellectual property regimes and international trade agreements\nprovide tremendous protections for pharmaceutical companies in wealthy\ncountries, with the result that many drugs and biologics are priced\nwell beyond what low-income countries can afford. To take what some\nconsider the most egregious case, should restrictions on the\nproduction and distribution of generics be upheld even when they\nhinder the containment of easily treatable diseases in poor countries\n(Pogge 2002; Grover, Citro, Mankad and Lander 2012)?\n\nOnly wealthy countries have the financial and human resources to make\nsizable investments in biomedical research. Do these countries have\nobligations in justice to allocate resources to address the major\nhealth problems of the world\u2019s poor? And finally, public health\ninfrastructures in low-income countries struggle from shortages of\nhealth professionals, in part because of migration of professionals to\nwealthy countries. Is this a problem that health authorities in\nwealthy countries should work to contain, even as the health of their\nown populations benefit?\n\nOne response to these specific challenges is to frame them all as\njustifiable claims of justice against the world\u2019s wealthy countries\nand persons. On one of the most compelling arguments for this view,\nwealthy countries and their citizens are responsible for transnational\ninstitutional structures that contribute to and exacerbate unjust\nglobal inequalities, including global health inequalities. The\ncontinuing beneficiaries of these structures have a duty not only to\nreform these structures but also to ensure that the effects of\nresultant unjust inequalities are mitigated. In public health, this\nincludes providing resources to meet the needs generated in health\ncrises and also helping to build effective public health\ninfrastructures in impoverished countries so that crises can be\naverted in the future. So understood, failing to do so is an injustice\nand not merely a failure to act charitably or in accordance with\nhumanitarian\n obligations.[14]\n Ultimately, that is why we cannot escape responsibility for\nintervening when something like an Ebola outbreak occurs and not\nmerely because of concerns about self-interest or humanitarian\nsentiments (Powers and Faden 2019).\n\nThose who make the case for viewing global health inequalities as\nunjust often appeal to health as a fundamental human right, drawing on\nthe field of health and human rights. As we have already noted, many\nin public health accept that health is a fundamental right, as\ncodified in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nor otherwise (General Assembly 1948). As is true for all human rights,\ndifficult questions immediately emerge about the assignment of\nresponsibility for protecting, promoting, and fulfilling the right to\nhealth and the specification of the content of the right (Millum and\nEmanuel 2012; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015a; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015b).\nAt least as long as the global order is organized as it is, there are\ngood reasons to view the nation-state as having first line\nresponsibility for the health and other human rights of those living\nwithin its borders. However, this does not absolve nation-states of\nobligations to at least forebear from undermining the ability of other\ncountries to meet their own human rights obligations. Arguably,\nnation-states have an obligation in justice to address impediments to\nhuman rights fulfillment that flow from unjust differentials of\ninterstate and global institutional power (Powers and Faden 2019,\n146). Also, acknowledging that nation-states are the first line of\ndefense in human rights fulfillment does not address who is\nresponsible for the human rights of people living in countries who\ncannot or will not protect their interests, including the human right\nto health (Powers and Faden 2019, 146\u2013177).\n\nIf we view inequalities between people living in wealthy nations and\nthose living in the rest of the world as a matter of justice rather\nthan as a humanitarian concern, then those who view public health ethics\nthrough the perspective of justice have plenty to think about. To\nthese theorists, the extraordinary disparities in life expectancy,\nchild survival, and health that distinguish those who live in rich and\npoor countries constitute a profound injustice that it is the duty of\nthe global community to redress. The necessary steps to ameliorate\nthese injustices go beyond simple medical care and classical public\nhealth interventions. Improving the health of the world\u2019s poor is\nindelibly tied to economic, social, educational, and environmental\nimprovements as well, and health-related justice claims are not easily\nseparable from justice claims that arise in those other contexts.\n\nThe fact that there are people who live in such poverty and\ndeprivation that they and their children die of starvation and the\nsimplest infection should be a sufficient indicator that these global\ninstitutional schemes are seriously\n unjust.[15]\n3. Political legitimacy and Public Health\n\nAs we noted in section 1.2, a distinctive feature of public health is the\nlarge role that government policy and government power play in its\npromotion. Although private non-profit actors, as well as pan-national\norganizations, make major contributions to advancing public\n health,[16]\n much of the work of public health occurs within nation-states and is\nbacked by governmental enforcement and the exercise of police powers.\nA substantial literature in public health ethics focuses on the\nlegitimacy of these state actions.\n\nChallenges to the authority of public health institutions and the\nlegitimacy of public health policies occur in a wide range of\npolitical contexts. In countries with distinctly illiberal political\ninstitutions, questions of state legitimacy are cashed out quite\ndifferently than in the liberal tradition. The public health ethics\nliterature has focused largely on the latter, relying on the liberal\ntradition as the touchstone for most writing on political legitimacy\nin public health. In Section 3, we address the major themes in this\nliterature. Section 3.1 considers how appeals to overall benefit, the\nnecessity of collective action, and efficiency are used to justify the\ngeneral mandate of public health agencies. Section 3.2 takes up the\nmajor strands of argument from within the liberal tradition that are\nused to assess the permissibility of particular policies or\n intervention.[17]\n After an overview of an influential heuristic developed to help map\nthe relative impact of various types of public health interventions on\nindividual\n liberty,[18]\n we turn to four different responses to concerns about the\nintrusiveness and legitimacy of public health policies and practices:\npaternalism (3.2.1); the harm principle, as attributed to John Stuart\nMill (3.2.2), the \u201cliberty tradition\u201d (3.2.3) and\nlibertarian paternalism (3.2.4)\n\nIn 3.3, we consider a different set of legitimacy-related concerns\nalso associated with liberalism that focus on the problem of how to\nrespect values disagreements among individuals affected by a public\nhealth policy. Here we take up two responses, an appeal to public\nreasons (3.3.1) and an appeal to authoritative decision-procedures\n(3.3.2). We then move in 3.4 to the civic republicanism view in public\nhealth ethics, which denies altogether the liberal presumption against\ninterfering with free and equal persons.\n3.1 Legitimacy, Efficiency, and Overall Benefit\n\nSome argue that public health institutions are legitimate in virtue of\nthe particular kinds of benefits they produce. Specifically, these are\nbenefits that are experienced by each of us as individuals but that we\ncannot secure for ourselves on our own. Moreover, these benefits are\nso important that successfully producing them overcomes the\npresumption against interfering with free and equal persons. For\nexample, we all want to be protected from infectious diseases and\nunsafe or ineffective medication. However, these kinds of benefits\ncannot be secured absent regulatory agencies such as the Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) which have the expertise and authority to respond\nto a potential epidemic or permit only safe and effective drugs to be\nmarketed to the public. According to this line of reasoning, public\nhealth policies made by experts and enforced by the state are better\nfor us overall, even if particular decisions may not directly benefit\nall of us all of the time.\n\nAccording to this rationale, the task of public health ethics is not\nnecessarily to justify each particular decision or intervention\ndirectly. Rather, as long as it stays within certain pre-established\nparameters, public health public health in general can be justified in\nthe same way a market economy, the laws of private property, or other\nsimilarly broad and useful institutions that involve some interference\nwith free and equal persons but also enable individuals to access\ngreater benefits can be justified: when properly regulated and\nmanaged, their existence is by and large better than their absence for\neveryone. So structured, the justification for particular public\nhealth interventions, requirements, or restrictions is derivative of\nor parasitic on a higher-level rationale.\n\nA closely related justification emphasizes that the pursuit of health\nis not possible without ground rules for coordinated action and\nnear-universal participation. Thus, public health is viewed as having\nthe structure of a coordination or collective efficiency problem. If\none person (or at least, a sufficient number of such persons) decides\nto go when the traffic light is red and stop when the traffic light is\ngreen, it does not matter that everyone else is following the rules:\nthis person will disrupt the smooth functioning of the system, with\npotentially dangerous results. Similarly, if one person (or a\nsufficient critical mass of such persons) decides not to abide by a\npublic health regulation because the regulation does not directly\nbenefit her or she otherwise objects, the ramifications will likely be\nfelt by others in her environment and\n beyond.[19]\n Almost everybody has to participate because, failing their\ninvolvement, neither they nor anyone else is likely to be as healthy\nas they might otherwise be, and none can fully reap the benefit of a\nhealthy society.\n\nIn many public health contexts, the only feasible or acceptably\nefficient way to implement a policy affects the entire population,\nleaving no or only very burdensome options open to individual\nnon-cooperation. Perhaps the most celebrated such example is water\nfluoridation, but all safety regulations affecting the food and drug\nsupply and consumer products share this character, as do many\nenvironmental and occupational health standards. Here collective\nefficiency considerations loom large. Although we want healthy\nenvironments and products, individuals are simply not positioned on\ntheir own to ensure that the air is safe to breathe, nor can they make\nmeaningful decisions about the safety of the hundreds of thousands of\nfood and other products available in the modern marketplace. According\nto this rationale, ceding this function to government institutions\nstaffed with health experts is justified in the same way as ceding\nprotection of our interests in personal physical security to\ngovernment institutions staffed with law enforcement and national\ndefense experts (Mill 1859).\n\nCollective efficiency arguments rely on claims about the sheer number\nand technical complexity of the decisions that need to be made to\nprotect health in the environment and in the marketplace, as well as\nthe indivisible character of responses to some health threats. These\narguments are buttressed by claims about the cognitive limitations and\nbounded rationality of individual human decision-makers and by the\ndisproportionate political power of corporate interests and the\npractices they use to manipulate and exploit our cognitive weaknesses\nagainst our health interests (Ubel 2009).\n\nThe appeal to overall benefit or collective efficiency has\nconsiderable attractiveness, particularly as a way of justifying the\nexistence of regulatory government agencies such as the EPA, FDA, or\nCDC. However, it is ultimately insufficient on its own and needs to be\nsupplemented by other kinds of ethical arguments, since it does not\nprovide the basis for the parameters within which such agencies should\noperate, or for ethical oversight or scrutiny with regards to the\nparticular decisions such agencies\n take.[20]\n3.2 Individual Liberty, Legitimacy, and Public Health\n\nDifferent kinds of interventions raise different issues for assessing\nquestions of legitimacy. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics has\nprovided an influential \u201cintervention ladder\u201d (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2007), which effectively rank orders various\ntypes of interventions on a continuum that is meant to function as a\nguide to the acceptability and justification of public health\npolicies. The ladder is anchored at one end by what is presented as\nthe least intrusive option, doing nothing, and at the other end by\nwhat is presented as the most intrusive option, eliminating choice\naltogether (as in compulsory isolation). The Council makes plain that\nall rungs on the ladder, including doing nothing, require\njustification and that the ladder is to be taken only as a tool in the\nmoral analysis of public health policies.\n\n\n\nMeasure\nExamples \n\nEliminate Choice\nquarantining individuals infected with Ebola \n\nRestrict Choice\ntrans fat ban; seatbelt and helmet laws; vaccine mandates;\nwater fluoridation \n\nGuide Choice by Disincentives\nsoda tax; cigarette tax; efforts to engender social norms\nagainst soda consumption \n\nGuide Choice by Incentives\ntax breaks for those who bike to work; pharmacy coupons in\nexchange for getting vaccinated against seasonal influenza \n\nGuide Choice by Changing the Default (also known as\n\u2018nudging\u2019)\nmaking salads the default side whereas fries have to be\nrequested; requiring that sugary foods be placed further back in\ngrocery stores \n\nEnable Choice\noffer free smoking cessation classes; ensure access to clean\nwater \n\nProvide Information\neducational campaigns; requirements for food labels\n\n\nDo nothing\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n\nTable. Intervention Ladder\n(Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Policy Process and Practice, 2007)\n\n\nWhile useful, the Nuffield ladder has at least three problems. First,\nthe ladder does not canvas all of the paradigmatic interventions of\npublic health. Surveillance, for instance, does not fit under any of\nthe types of measures that appear on the ladder. Yet public health\nagencies engage in surveillance extensively; it is integral to\npromoting and protecting public health. And surveillance activities,\ntoo, raise difficult justificatory questions about citizen\u2019s\nrights against intrusions by the state (Lee 2019; Taylor 2019;\nFairchild and Bayer 2004).\n\nSecond, continua like the Nuffield Ladder oversimplify the complex\nimpact of interventions on choice and liberty and on relations between\ncitizens and the state. When public health authorities do nothing, it\ndoes not follow that choice and liberty are necessarily the winners.\nFor example, with no government intervention to serve as a counter\nballast, private sector actors in the pharmaceutical, food, and energy\nsectors may undermine both individual choice and health through\nmisinformation, manipulative advertising, or anti-competitive\npractices. Similarly, incentives are not always less restrictive of\nchoice than disincentives, and some object to both because they are\nmanipulative and autonomy-undermining (Quong 2011). Nudges and health\npromotion campaigns also raise concerns about unwarranted state\nintrusion, depending on the context. For example, ad campaigns that\nare transparently sponsored by public health agencies, such as those\nto prevent transmission of influenza by promoting personal infection\ncontrol practices or reduce obesity by encouraging exercise and\nhealthy eating, do not raise the same moral issues as the embedding of\nanti-drug or food messages in the storylines of entertainment\ntelevision programming by these same authorities (FCC 2000; Forbes\n2000 (Other Internet Resources); Goodman 2006; Krauthammer 2000; Kurtz\nand Waxman 2000). Much like corporate advertising, these embedded\nmessages, as well as some nudges, may succeed in shaping\npeople\u2019s preferences without their awareness. These undetected\neffects lead to questions about whether such interventions constitute\ninsidious manipulation by government and, as a consequence whether\nthey are really less objectionable than more overt interventions like\ntaxing or restricting liberty.\n\nThird, the Nuffield Ladder ranks types of public health measures on\nonly one set of considerations that is relevant to justifying the\nimpact of that measure on choice and liberty. Justifications of\npolicies must also include an assessment of the benefit produced by\nthe intervention as discussed in Section 3.1, as well as\nconsiderations of who benefits and who is harmed by alternative\ngovernment responses (including doing nothing) in ways that are\nsensitive to the range of worries about justice raised in section\n2.\n\nThe Nuffield Ladder is ultimately motivated by concerns about the\nappropriate scope of state activity, and how the rights or interests\nof citizens should restrict such activities. One helpful framing of\nthis concern comes from familiar discussions of political legitimacy\n(see the entry on\n political legitimacy).\n In these discussions, there are typically three claims that are\npresented as though they are in tension:\n\nExercises of political power interfere with free and equal\npersons \u2013 some of whom do not consent to such interference.\nThere is a moral presumption against interfering with\nnon-consenting free and equal persons.\nPublic health interventions are (often) exercises of political\npower.\n\n\nThe use of \u2018interference\u2019 is intentionally broad and can\nbe specified to be more or less inclusive. As we saw from the Nuffield\nLadder, the most paradigmatic cases of interference are laws\nrestricting or eliminating individual choice. Arguably, however, other\ninterventions interfere with free and equal persons, such as\ndisincentivizing or incentivizing choice, altering choice\narchitecture, or conducting surveillance. Others charge that even\nsubsidized smoking cessation programs funded by taxpayer money\nconstitute an interference with free and equal persons on the grounds\nthat taxation is coercive \u2013 and so constitutes interference\n(Quong 2011).\n\nThe conception of \u2018free and equal persons\u2019 is also open to\nmultiple specifications (see the entry on\n liberalism).\n The basic idea behind the \u2018free\u2019 qualifier is to limit\ndiscussion to individuals who have the requisite psychological\nabilities to govern their lives in accordance with their values or\nplan of life. Children and, arguably, adults with severe cognitive\ndisabilities do not count as free in this sense, and so the tension\nbetween (1) and (2) does not arise for them as straightforwardly. The\n\u2018equal\u2019 qualifier is meant to convey that free persons are\nmoral equals, and no person has a natural right to govern others.\n\nResolving the tension between (1) and (2) is not unique to public\nhealth; it is widely treated as a central problem for theorists of\npolitical morality generally, especially by those who consider\nthemselves liberals. Nonetheless, as (3) indicates, the tension\nbetween (1) and (2) frequently arises in the context of public health\npractice and policy. We now consider a variety of responses to this\ntension.\n3.2.1 Paternalism\n\nPerhaps no issue has driven more debates about the legitimacy of\npublic health interventions than paternalism, and when, if ever,\npaternalism is morally permissible. There is no consensus on how to\nbest define paternalism, and resolving disputes about this definition\nis beyond the scope of this entry (see the\n entry on paternalism).\n But paternalism is classically understood as successfully interfering\nwith the liberty of action of a person, against her will, to protect\nor promote her welfare (Dworkin 2005; Feinberg\n 1986)[21].\n \u2018Strong\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 paternalism, the variant\nof paternalism that is most controversial, typically refers to\ninterference with someone\u2019s informed and value-based preferences\nfor the sake of advancing that person\u2019s best interests or\nwelfare. To illustrate with a case, imagine someone who chooses to\nride a motorcycle without a helmet rather than with a helmet despite\nknowing the greater risk of injury and death that accompanies this\nchoice because the person values the enhanced sense of freedom they\nexperience when riding bareheaded. In this case, interference with\nthis decision for their own good by issuing fines that are ultimately\nbacked by loss of driving privileges or some other significant penalty\nwould be a case of strong or hard paternalism.\n\nStrong or hard paternalism is quite controversial in all domains, and\nliberals rarely claim that interventions can be justified on strong or\nhard paternalistic grounds when it comes to autonomous, competent, and\ninformed persons. And very few public health interventions are\njustified exclusively or even primarily on grounds of hard or strong\npaternalism. Even proponents of motorcycle helmet laws often eschew\npaternalistic arguments in favor of arguments about the costs the\ncyclist imposes on others by riding without a helmet (Jones and Bayer\n2007).\n\nA distinct class of paternalistic arguments more popular with public\nhealth advocates appeals to soft paternalism or weak paternalism. Soft\npaternalism concerns interference with individuals to ensure that they\nare not acting on false beliefs when endangering themselves such as\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s influential example of the person who intends\nto cross an unstable bridge, when it is unclear whether he knows that\nthe bridge is dangerous. In this case, to engage in soft paternalism\nwould be to make sure that the individual knows that the bridge is\nunstable and if that person does, allowing them to cross nonetheless.\nWeak paternalism includes correcting more general failures to take\none\u2019s means to one\u2019s ends due to, say, weakness of will\n(Dworkin 2005). Both weak and soft paternalism share the feature that\nthey are interferences with choices that are compromised by ignorance\nor non-voluntariness.\n\nA challenge for both soft and especially weak paternalism is how to\nrespond when the person who is to be interfered with voices or holds a\npreference that is inconsistent with the ends pursued on her behalf. A\ngeneral view is that preferences are not entitled to robust respect if\nformed under conditions that significantly compromise their autonomy\nor voluntariness, such as cognitive disability or immaturity and, in\nvery limited cases, ignorance or false\n beliefs.[22]\n Although rarely employed as a justification in public health,\nadaptive preferences formed in response to difficult or unjust\ncircumstances are viewed by some as being less autonomous and\nconsequently more subject to permissible interference than preferences\nformed under just or normal background\n conditions[23]\n (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on autonomy).\n\nMore typically in public health, the obligation to respect preferences\nis challenged by appeal to other claimed compromises of autonomy or\nvoluntariness. For example, public health interventions aimed at\nadolescents, such as minimum age requirements for the purchasing of\nalcohol, tobacco products, and driver\u2019s licenses, appeal to\nviews about the immaturity of judgment of adolescents whose brains are\nstill developing and who have limited life experience. For adults as\nwell as teenagers, claims about the addictive properties of some\nsubstances, as well as the power of corporate marketing strategies to\nmanipulate preferences, are often used to justify interference. For\nexample, this line of reasoning has been used to help defend some\ndrug, alcohol, and tobacco policies, as well as policies to restrict\naccess to sugar-sweetened\n beverages.[24]\n\nIt warrants emphasizing that in all these cases, justified\ninterference would be based on a finding of significantly compromised\nautonomy, competence, or rationality in the formation or continued\nholding of particular preferences. This should not be confused with\ninterference based on the content of the preferences. Only the former\nwould be justifiable under soft or weak paternalism, whereas the\nlatter would constitute hard or strong paternalism.\n\nThese demarcations are not, of course, as clear in real life as they\nare in theory, and in practice, the content of preferences is often\nprecisely what is appealed to in illustrating that a particular\npreference is compromised. However, by and large, what distinguishes\nweak paternalism from strong paternalism is the requirement that the\ndecision or preference be fundamentally compromised, and not simply\nthat it be mistaken or ignorant. This principled distinction remains\nimportant not least because it reflects a difference in approach or\nattitude: in the case of hard or strong paternalism, the interference\nis based on the content of a preference that, purportedly, does not\nreflect what is in the preference holder\u2019s\n interest.[25]\n In the case of soft or weak paternalism, persons might hold all\nmanner of preferences not in their best interest that are nonetheless\nnot justifiably interfered with because the relevant compromising\nconditions do not obtain.\n\nDespite the general tendency to eschew paternalistic arguments in\npublic health ethics, there have been some notable defenses of\nunabashed paternalism in recent years. However, the exact form of\npaternalism that these authors defend varies (Conly 2013, 2014; Hanna\n2019). To take one prominent defender of paternalism, Sarah Conly\nappears to defend weak paternalism insofar as she claims the\nappropriate goal of paternalism is to enable as many individuals as\npossible to act on their genuine values or higher-order preferences.\nFor instance, Conly argues in favor of various paternalist forms of\npublic health legislation, such as banning trans-fats, because\nindividuals value their health more than they value consuming\ntrans-fats (Conly 2013, 2014).\n3.2.2 John Stuart Mill, Liberty, and the Harm Principle\n\nLikely no classic philosophical work is cited more often in the public\nhealth ethics literature than John Stuart Mill\u2019s influential essay,\n\u201cOn Liberty\u201d (Mill 1869). In that essay, Mill articulates\nand defends what has come to be called \u2018the harm\nprinciple,\u2019 although Mill himself never used the term. The harm\nprinciple has been interpreted as holding that the only justification\nfor interfering with the liberty of an individual, against her will,\nis to prevent direct, non-consensual harm to others. The harm\nprinciple is used to both challenge and support public health\npolicies.\n\nPolicies that interfere with conduct that does not produce direct harm\nto others are sometimes criticized as government overreach in virtue\nof failing to satisfy the harm principle (Jones and Bayer 2007; Quong\n2011; Flanigan 2014b). For instance, opponents of motorcycle helmet\nlaws in Massachusetts explicitly invoked Mill when pressing their case\nin court (Jones and Bayer 2007, 211). Conversely, the harm principle\nis invoked to justify policies where harm to others is a paramount\nconcern, paradigmatically for various infectious disease control\ninterventions such as quarantine, isolation, and compulsory treatment\n(Flanigan 2014a; Holland 2007; Navin 2016; Giubilini 2019). In liberal\ndemocracies, the harm principle is often viewed as the most compelling\njustification for public health policies that interfere with\nindividual liberty. For example, some claim that in the United States\nit was not until the public became persuaded of the harmful effects of\n\u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d that the first significant intrusion\ninto smoking practices \u2013 the banning of smoking in public places\n\u2013 became politically possible.\n\nAs with all such moral and political principles, questions remain\nabout the specification of the harm principle. There are questions\nabout the nature of harm, which is typically understood as setting\nback the interests of individuals in which they have rights, including\neconomic interests. How significant must the threat of harm be, with\nregard to both its likelihood and\n magnitude?[26]\n Are physical harms to the health of others to be weighted more than\neconomic harms or other setbacks to interests? It is undeniable that\nindividuals have much broader and more multi-dimensional interests\nthan narrowly self-directed physical ones. In that sense, it is not\nunreasonable to have a fairly expansive understanding of\n\u201charm\u201d in a public health context. And given how\nself-harming behavior influences others, some might question the\nusefulness of sharply delineating self-regarding and other-regarding\nharm. Others, however, charge that to interpret harm in this way is\ntoo expansive (Jones and Bayer 2007).\n\nFor instance, consider the claim that one harms others by riding a\nmotorcycle without a helmet because, in so doing, cyclists risk\ndiverting important medical resources and personnel to the care of\npeople who get into accidents without helmets. Some have charged that\nthis construal of harm is unduly broad and, accordingly, this\nconstrual of harm would entail that the harm principle permits various\ngovernment interventions that it should prohibit (Jones and Bayer\n2007). Actions that are primarily self-harming frequently raise\nconcerns about how broadly to interpret the harm principle.\n\nBecause the impact of J.S. Mill on public health ethics cannot be\noverstated, it is also important to recognize that Mill does not hold\nthat in the formulation of public policies all liberty interests enjoy\nan equal presumption in their favor. Mill distinguishes interests that\nare so important that they are immune from state interference,\ninterests that enjoy a presumption in favor of liberty, and interests\nthat enjoy no such presumption. The harm principle figures prominently\nonly when the second kind of liberty interest is involved. Some public\nhealth interventions target the third kind of liberty interest, which\nis not privileged in the same way. For example, is not clear that the\ninterest individuals have in eating foods with trans-fats is an\ninterest that enjoys a presumption in favor of liberty (Powers, Faden\nand Saghai 2012).\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the harm principle has also\nenjoyed more attention in public health ethics in recent years because\nsome of Mill\u2019s arguments have been subject to increased\nscrutiny. One of Mill\u2019s arguments rests on the claim that\nothers, including the State, are not as well-positioned to know the\nbest interests of the individual as the individual herself, and the\nindividual has the greatest interest in her own well-being.\nAccordingly, restricting the individual\u2019s liberty for her own\ngood will typically fail. Yet in recent years, some have drawn on\nfindings in behavioral economics and social psychology to challenge\nthis empirical claim about our self-knowledge, incentives, and\ncompetence at pursuing our own interests \u2013 and thereby challenge\na claim that underlies the harm principle. This challenge can be\nspecified in various ways. One specification is that we are quite bad\nat means-end reasoning due to ignorance; many would like to lead\nhealthy lives but lack knowledge of nutrition. Another version of this\nis that individuals are bad at taking the requisite means to their\nends due to various cognitive biases, such as temporal discounting, or\nlack of executive function. Individuals often know what is in their\nbest interest, but they still succumb to temptation or otherwise act\nin ways that, arguably, are not conducive to what they as well as\nothers appreciate is in their interest (Conly 2013, 2014; Hanna 2019;\nSunstein 2013; Thaler and Sunstein 2003; 2008).\n\nNeedless to say, whether these empirical claims are correct will turn\non how we specify the requisite conditions for knowledge of\none\u2019s own best interest; what constitutes successfully acting on\none\u2019s best interests; and whether various cognitive biases do,\nin fact, prevent individuals from acting on their own best interests.\nMoreover, as we will see in the following section, even if we grant\nthat individuals are subject to the relevant shortcomings, this might\nnot undercut Mill\u2019s more general point.\n3.2.3 The Liberty Tradition\n\nRegardless of how we interpret the harm principle or whether we accept\nthe various arguments for it, some liberals have appealed to the moral\nsignificance of individual liberty to argue that various liberal\ngovernments currently overstep their mandate when it comes to\npromoting public health. To borrow a label from Eric Mack and Gerald\nGaus, this class of views constitutes \u2018the liberty\ntradition.\u2019 (Mack and Gaus 2004; Brennan 2018). The liberty\ntradition includes (non-left and anti-paternalist) libertarianism and\nvarious forms of classical liberalism. In recent years, some advocates\nof the liberty tradition have become increasingly interested in public\nhealth ethics. Their views are distinctive insofar as they place a\nsignificant normative premium on individual liberty, and they\ntypically do not countenance public health interventions based on\nprinciples of justice other than principles of transfer or repair.\nMoreover, these theorists frequently call out perceived excesses on\nthe part of the State\u2019s pursuit of public health.\n\nOne argument that frequently appears in this literature turns on\nskepticism that government actors are sufficiently knowledgeable,\ncompetent, or well-motivated to effectively improve the public\u2019s\nhealth. In other words, some object to a wide variety of public health\ninterventions because of empirical claims about government actors,\nincluding those who attempt to promote public health. While we have\nseen that some challenge the presumption in favor of liberty by\nproviding evidence that individuals are not, in fact, especially good\nat pursuing their own interests \u2013 due to ignorance, lack of\nwillpower, or cognitive bias \u2013 those in the liberty tradition\nsometimes counter that even if we grant these empirical claims, it\ndoes not follow that governments are any better. In other words, to\nshow that governments may interfere with free and equal persons, one\nwould need to show that policy can better secure the interests of\nindividuals than individuals themselves can. And when it comes to\npublic health interventions aimed at protecting individuals from\nthemselves, these theorists claim that we should doubt that government\nactors are up to the task (Brennan 2017; Epstein 2004; Flanigan\n2014b).\n\nThe argument so far rests on empirical claims about the questionable\ncompetence and motivation of government actors, but many (if not most)\nin the liberty tradition also oppose such interventions on normative\ngrounds as well. That is, even if public health officials were\ncompetent, well-motivated, and knew the interests of individuals\nbetter than individuals themselves, those in the liberty tradition\nobject that this still would not justify various public health\npolicies aimed at improving the health of citizens (see Brennan 2018;\nEpstein 2004; Flanigan 2014b; Quong 2011; Anomaly 2011; Gaus 2010).\nThis point can be summarized with the following quote from David\nEstlund (although Estlund uses it in a markedly different context):\n\u201cYou might be right, but who made you boss?\u201d (Estlund\n2007). There are a variety of rationales for this normative\nconclusion; some appeal to natural rights or broadly deontological\nviews, whereas others appeal to requirements of public justification\n(more on this below). Others still draw on consequentialist reasoning\nand appear to argue on grounds of efficiency or aggregate benefit.\nThat is, one could grant that overall benefit or efficiency would\njustify public health interventions but deny that many public health\ninterventions are, in fact, efficient in the relevant ways (Brennan\n2018).\n\nThe common thread in the liberty tradition is the moral presumption in\nfavor of individual liberty. This thread manifests in a variety of\nways in the context of public health. Some object to the ways in which\npublic health authorities provide information to citizens, such as\n\u2018traffic light\u2019 labels on foods, or especially graphic\nimages that depict the deleterious effects of smoking cigarettes\n(Bonotti 2014). Others in the liberty tradition object to\ngovernment-created disincentives, such as soda taxes (Anomaly 2011,\n2012). And, of course, proponents of the liberty tradition object to\nrestrictions of choice. For instance, some charge that regulatory\nbodies, such as the FDA, illegitimately restrict individual liberty\nwhen they prohibit individuals from purchasing and using drugs that\nthe FDA deems unsafe (Anomaly 2011, 2012; Flanigan 2014b, 2017;\nEpstein 2004).\n\nAs with the harm principle, those in the liberty tradition are not\nnecessarily opposed to public health measures that prohibit people\nfrom harming others. Yet we might wonder whether the liberty\ntradition\u2019s premium on individual liberty constrains various\npublic health interventions that its proponents wish to endorse. An\ninteresting boundary case concerns whether members of the liberty\ntradition can endorse vaccine mandates, especially for the\nmeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine (Bernstein 2017; Brennan 2018; Flanigan\n2014a; Giubilini 2019; Navin 2015). Collectively, parents who delay or\nrefuse vaccination can impose considerable risk on others,\ncollectively. Individually, however, each unvaccinated child does not\nimpose much risk. Given this low risk of harm, it would seem that the\nmost natural argument in defense of mandatory vaccination would be to\njustify a restriction of individual parental liberty for the sake of\nsome sort of overall benefit. Insofar as libertarians view\ninterference with free and equal persons for promoting overall benefit\nas illegitimate, however, this argument is not available for them. And\nself-identified libertarians outside of academia have objected to\nvaccine mandates as unjustified infringements on individual liberty.\n(For instance, in 2015, Senator Rand Paul argued against vaccine\nmandates because \u201cThe state doesn\u2019t own your children.\nParents own their children.\u201d) But this is a striking conclusion,\none that arguably counts against the plausibility of libertarianism\nrather than against the legitimacy of vaccine mandates (Brennan 2018;\nBernstein 2017).\n\nPerhaps in response to this position, some self-described libertarians\nhave attempted to defend vaccine mandates by arguing that allowing\none\u2019s child to go unvaccinated violates the rights of others\n(Flanigan 2014a; Brennan 2018). If their arguments succeed,\nlibertarians can place a premium on individual liberty without being\ncommitted to the ostensibly unpalatable implication that vaccine\nmandates are illegitimate. In reply, however, some have objected that\nif vaccine delayal or refusal violates rights in virtue of imposing\nrisk of harm on others, then so too do many other activities. Think of\nthe risks associated with owning guns or private pools or driving\nlarge, fuel-inefficient cars. If this is correct, then a libertarian\ndefense of vaccine mandates is either unsuccessful or entails the\npermissibility of widespread government restrictions of various\nliberties, thereby raising the question as to whether the defense\ngenuinely counts as libertarian (Bernstein 2017).\n3.2.4 Libertarian Paternalism\n\nSome have sought a third way between paternalism and the liberty\ntradition. The proponents of this third way describe their view as\n\u2018libertarian paternalism.\u2019 (Thaler and Sunstein 2003;\nThaler and Sunstein 2008; Sunstein 2013). Libertarian paternalism aims\nto be responsive to our well-documented shortcomings at pursuing our\nown interests while also assuaging the liberty tradition\u2019s\nconcerns about paternalistic measures that disincentivize, restrict,\nor eliminate choice. \u2018Nudges,\u2019 understood typically as\ninterventions in choice architecture, are the focus of libertarian\npaternalism. And public health policy and liberal governments have\nincreasingly employed nudges to influence health behaviors in\ndesirable directions. Libertarian paternalism endorses interventions\nby planners (such as public health authorities) in the environmental\narchitecture in which individuals decide and act in order to make it\neasier for people to behave in ways that are in their best interests\n(including their health), provided two conditions are satisfied\n(Thaler and Sunstein 2003; Thaler and Sunstein 2008). First,\nindividuals are steered by these interventions in ways that make them\nbetter off, as judged by themselves. Thus, in libertarian paternalism,\nthere is no attempt to contravene the will of individuals, in contrast\nto what some hold to be a necessary feature of paternalism. Second,\nthe interventions must not overly burden individuals who want to\nexercise their freedom in ways that run counter to their own welfare.\nThaler and Sunstein suggest, for example, that salads rather than\nFrench fries could be made the default \u201cside\u201d on\nrestaurant menus, with diners free to request fries if that remains\ntheir preference. By nudging people to eat salads, public health\noutcomes would improve, but this intervention does not objectionably\ninterfere with individual liberty.\n\nA key conceptual question about paternalism is whether the\ninterference with individual liberty must be against the person\u2019s will\n(Beauchamp 2010). If this feature is a necessary condition of\npaternalism, then libertarian paternalism is inappropriately titled.\nSimilarly, we might wonder whether the view is genuinely libertarian\nin any informative sense since libertarianism is concerned to protect\nindividual liberty not only from coercion but also from other forms of\ninterference \u2013 most notably manipulation. Both supporters and\nopponents of paternalistic interventions and those in favor of them\nhave charged that choice architecture is manipulative (Conly 2013;\nQuong 2011).\n\nFrom the standpoint of public health ethics, however, whether\nlibertarian paternalism is appropriately titled is less important than\nany moral issues it raises and how it is justified. There is a large\nand still-growing literature on the ethics of nudges, much of it\nfocusing on health (Engelen 2019; Levy 2017; Moles 2015; Muldoon 2018;\nNoggle 2018; Saghai 2013a; Saghai 2013b; Soccia 2019; Quigley 2013;\nHollands et al. 2013; Quong 2011).\n\nThose who believe that nudging is manipulative and that manipulation\nis objectionable for the same sorts of reasons as coercion is\nobjectionable do not see libertarian paternalism as a viable middle\npath between paternalism and the liberty tradition. Instead, they\nargue that it is simply a different form of paternalism, one that\nraises the same or very similar concerns about respect for individuals\nas coercive paternalism (see Quong 2011; Noggle 2018; Soccia 2019).\nMoreover, as noted above in the discussion of the liberty tradition,\nsome have granted that individuals are not good at the relevant kinds\nof decision-making but deny that government actors are sufficiently\ncompetent or well-motivated to design nudges that do more good than\nharm. Whether this objection to libertarian paternalism sticks is a\ncomplicated empirical question. But insofar as one accepts that\nlibertarian paternalism is manipulative, it does not avoid worries\nfrom those in the liberty tradition.\n\nOthers, by contrast, see libertarian paternalism as too restrictive in\nits conditions (and therefore too weak) to be applicable or adequate\nfor many public health contexts (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007;\nUbel 2009; Conly 2013; Conly 2014; Menard 2010). For instance, some\ncharge that libertarian paternalism is so concerned with individual\ndecision-making that it is not well-suited to producing public goods\nassociated with public health, nor is it effective at removing\nunderlying social determinants of bad public health outcomes (Menard\n2010). And some restrictions of liberty have yielded significant\npublic health benefits, such as seatbelt or motorcycle laws, or bans\non the use of trans fats (Conly 2013; Conly 2014; Menard 2010). In\nother words, those unmoved by the objections to restricting individual\nliberty for the sake of realizing public health gains find the\nlibertarian paternalist proposal to be too concessive to the liberty\ntradition. Because policies that conform to libertarian paternalist\ncriteria are too limited in their effects, libertarian paternalism is\nunable to accomplish central tasks of public health \u2013 and\ntherefore does not satisfy those who reject the liberty tradition.\n3.3 Normative Disagreement and Legitimacy\n\nA small but growing literature addressing concerns about legitimacy\naccepts a broadly liberal view of political morality but emphasizes a\nslightly different set of concerns. More specifically, some argue that\nthe distinctive problems of public health ethics do not merely extend\nto offering answers to moral questions about, say, whether the state\nis permitted to try to reduce the incidence of obesity or whether such\na policy is just. Instead, the public health ethicist also faces moral\nquestions about the normatively appropriate ways for governments to\nrespond to disagreements among its citizen about how to distribute\nresources or what considerations (if any) justify attempts to reduce\nthe incidence of obesity. That is, given the plurality of views about\nthe good life or justice, how should we ultimately arrive at\nparticular policies designed to promote public health? (Kristine\nB\u00e6r\u00f8e et al. 2014; Anomaly 2011; Coggon 2012; Daniels and\nSabin 1997; Daniels and Sabin 2008; Bonotti 2014; Bonotti and Barnhill\n2019)\n\nConsider, for example, a municipal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.\nPublic health authorities and policymakers may defend the tax by\npointing to the health burdens of rising obesity rates, which are\nfueled by the consumption of sugary beverages that have no redeeming\nnutritional value. Not everyone in the population affected by the tax\nshares the values that underlie this position, however. Some citizens\nreject the view that overweight bodies are somehow objectionable and\ninstead see them as something else entirely \u2013 large or\ntraditionally built bodies that are particularly attractive and\nbeautiful. Other citizens greatly enjoy the pleasures associated with\nsweets, including sweetened beverages. These citizens might object\nthat they value sweets or having a beautiful body so much that they\nare more than willing to assume any associated elevated risk of, say,\nhypertension or diabetes. Here, there is genuine disagreement within\nthe affected population about standards of beauty, the worth of sweet\ndrinks, and how important these values are compared to health. (Other\ndisagreements concern what conception of health we should accept.) If\nthe soda tax is implemented in the name of promoting population\nhealth, then a distinctive issue arises: the justification for the\nsoda tax appeals to a conception of what is overall valuable or good\nthat not all citizens accept. Disagreements about values also plague\npublic health concerns about justice. As we have already noted, there\nare competing theories about why health matters, morally, as well as\nwhether health policy should aim to maximize overall population health\nor reducing unjust inequalities in health status or health care\naccess. In the face of these kinds of disagreements about the good\nlife or justice, what makes public health policies legitimate?\n3.3.1 Public Reason Liberalism\n\nOne line of response to normative disagreement draws on work in\npolitical philosophy that develops theories of public reason or public\njustification (see the\n entry on public reason,\n and the entry on\n public justification).\n According to public reason theorizing, political power is legitimate\nif and only if it is exercised in accordance with shared political\nvalues or normative reasons that idealized members of a political\ncommunity can accept, would accept, could not reject, or would not\nreject. To return to the earlier example, imagine that when defending\na soda tax to citizens, some legislators point to passages in their\npreferred religious texts to support the tax. Other supporters claim\nthat smaller bodies are more beautiful than larger ones, and so we\nshould try to reduce the incidence of obesity. Neither of these\nconsiderations would count as public reasons because reasonable\ncitizens have different aesthetic standards and disagree about which\n(if any) religious texts are authoritative. According to public reason\nliberalism, to justify a policy on the basis of these sorts of reasons\nwhen some (idealized) citizens could not or would not accept those\nreasons would be to run afoul of a requirement of legitimacy.\n\nPublic justification theorists also offer competing explanations as to\nwhy political officials ought only to exercise political power on the\nbasis of values that satisfy requirements of public justification. For\ninstance, some argue that if policies are coercively enforced on the\nbasis of reasons that at least some citizens cannot accept, then we\nfail to accord them the respect to which they are entitled. Others\nfocus less on coercion but nonetheless insist that considerations of\nreciprocity or community generate requirements of public reason. (For\na variety of views about the normative significance of satisfying\nrequirements of public reason, see esp., Quong 2011; Rawls 1993; Gaus\n2010; the entry on\n public reason;\n and the\n entry on public justification.)\n\nRegardless of the preferred rationale, if one accepts the claim that\npolicies are legitimate only if they are justifiable on the basis of\npublic reasons, a great deal turns on how one specifies public\nreasons. And such specifications have significant implications for the\nscope of the mandate of public health. Some argue that public reasons\ninclude reasons that are acceptable given shared epistemic standards\nor values internal to a political culture, or a society\u2019s shared\nconception of justice. Shared conceptions of justice or values in a\npolitical culture are presumably consonant with a broad array of\npublic health interventions. For instance, imagine someone justifying\nvarious programs that would provide access to healthier foods. This\nperson could invoke shared epistemic standards by pointing to evidence\nthat lack of access to adequately nutritious food as a child is\ncorrelated with health outcomes that no rational or reasonable person\nwould want, such as diabetes. The person could invoke a shared\nconception of justice by claiming that the neighborhood one is born\ninto should not determine one\u2019s health prospects (Bonotti and\nBarnhill 2019; Moles 2013; Nielsen and Jensen 2016).\n\nOthers, by contrast, argue for more restrictive conceptions of public\nreasons. For instance, one popular theory of public reason liberalism\nclaims that a reason is public if and only if it is compatible with\nthe \u2018motivational set\u2019 \u2013 which includes desires,\ndispositions of evaluation, and patterns of emotional reaction \u2013\nof each (idealized) person (Bonotti and Barnhill 2019). Given that at\nleast a few (idealized) people will have a motivational set that is\nincompatible with reasons offered in defense of a public health\nmeasure, very few public health interventions will be supported by\npublic health reasons. Accordingly, this restrictive conception of\npublic reasons has restrictive implications for the mandate of public\nhealth. Without further specification of what is meant by \u2018idealized\u2019\ntaking this position may mean that virtually no public health measures\ncould ever be considered legitimate. Because public health policies\nare by design intended to affect large numbers of people, it is hard\nto imagine any public health policy, or indeed any kind of policy,\nthat is compatible with the motivational set of every affected person.\nThere will always be some who object to a proposed policy because it\nis incompatible with their values. It is not, therefore, a coincidence\nthat those who endorse restrictive conceptions of public reasons also\ntend to identify with the liberty tradition. To return to an earlier\nexample, one reason offered in defense of a soda tax is that the tax\nwill reduce overall obesity and thereby improve population health.\nYet, as we saw, at least some people have motivational sets that\nprioritize having a larger body or enjoying sweet drinks over being\nhealthy \u2013 even if we assume a shared conception of health. Since\nthe reason given in defense of the policy is incompatible with the\nmotivational set of some individuals, it is not a public reason. If\nthe health argument was the only reason in defense of a soda tax, then\nthis version of public reason liberalism would claim that the soda tax\nis illegitimate \u2013 it is not justifiable to (idealized) citizens\n(Bonotti and Barnhill 2019).\n3.3.2 Authoritative Decision \u2013 Procedures\n\nA distinct set of responses to disagreement-based concerns about\nlegitimacy focus on designing authoritative decision-procedures. Many\ndefend the claim that when we disagree about conceptions of the good\nlife or justice, allowing the majority to vote is normatively\nattractive \u2013 or even strictly necessary \u2013 because it\nrespectfully resolves such disagreements (see, e.g., Waldron 1999).\nSome theorists addressing topics in public health have taken a similar\ntack. Given disagreement about various values relevant to population\nhealth, some emphasize the importance of utilizing decision-procedures\nthat include stakeholder input, are transparent, or satisfy various\nother values that are discussed in the context of debates about\ndisagreement and authority (Childress et al. 2002; Emanuel 2002; Goold\net al. 2005; Upshur 2002; Marckmann et al. 2015).\n\nWhile less explored, a different set of questions about institutional\ndesign and disagreement concerns the connection between administrative\nagencies, public health, and democratic decision-making. Public health\ndecision-making often occurs within administrative agencies, where\nunelected officials make value judgments about how to interpret or\nimplement legislation or executive directives (Weinstock 2016). This\nfeature of public health raises interesting legitimacy questions,\nquestions that also crop up for national defense or environmental\nagencies or appointed judges. While of considerable interest and\nimportance for public health ethics, there has been relatively little\nwork addressing this topic. Adequately addressing this gap in the\nliterature would require bringing together work on democratic\nlegitimacy, the legitimacy of administrative agencies, and the\nimplications of both for public health, in particular.\n\nPerhaps the most extensive discussion about legitimate\ndecision-procedures as an appropriate response to normative\ndisagreement concerns disagreements about priority-setting. To give a\nsense of these debates and the broader philosophical issues they\nraise, it is worth focusing on an especially influential framework for\nassessing the legitimacy of decision-making about priority setting and\ncoverage issues relevant to public health, Norman Daniels\u2019s and\nJames Sabin\u2019s Accountability for Reasonableness\n (A4R).[27]\n Initially intended to inform decision-making by private insurance\ncompanies, A4R has since been extended to apply to priority setting\ngenerally and health technology assessment.\n\nThe underlying assumption of A4R is that it is easier to reach\nagreement about a decision-procedure for how to go forward in the face\nof substantive moral disagreements about the appropriate distribution\nof health resources than it is to resolve the underlying substantive\ndisagreements themselves (Daniels 2000; Daniels and Sabin 1997;\nDaniels and Sabin 2008). A4R articulates four conditions that, if\nsatisfied, render a decision-procedure legitimate \u2013 even when\nindividuals disagree about fundamental questions about values or\njustice or the decision reached by the procedure. These four\nconditions are as follows:\n\nThe publicity condition requires that rationales for resource\nallocation must be publicly accessible.\nThe relevance condition requires that decisions must invoke\nrelevant reasons that \u2018fair-minded people\u2019 would accept,\nwhere \u2018fair-minded people\u2019 are those who are\n\u2018disposed to finding mutually justifiable terms of\ncooperation\u2019 (Daniels 2008, 118). Here, A4R draws on the\naforementioned work in public reason theorizing as well as work on\ndeliberative democracy; having fair-minded people offering reasons for\ndifferent policies will yield some degree of consensus, at the very\nleast about which reasons are relevant for making a decision (see the\n entry on democracy).\nThe revision and appeals condition requires that mechanisms be in\nplace to allow for challenges and revisions of decisions when new\nevidence or arguments come to light.\nThe regulative condition (also referred to as the enforcement\ncondition) requires that there be voluntary or public regulation of\nthe process of decision-making.\n\n\nDespite its popularity, many object to A4R. A fundamental objection\nquestions the assumption that motivates A4R \u2013 that arriving at\nagreement on a decision-procedure is more feasible than arriving at\nconsensus on substantive values (Friedman 2008; Dawson and Verweij\n2014; Sabik and Lie 2008). Others debate whether the publicity and\nrevision and appeals conditions are sufficiently democratic (Friedman\n2008, 102) or whether publicity is necessary for legitimacy (de Fine\nLicht 2011; Martin and Giacomini and Singer 2002).\n\nPerhaps the most scrutinized aspect of the A4R is the relevance\ncondition. As we saw in the discussion of public reason, political\ntheorists disagree about which sorts of reasons count as public.\nDaniels claims the only relevant class of reasons are those that\nfair-minded people would accept. He argues that to allow every\nconsideration to count equally would make a consensus impossible and\nthat it would be misguided to accord significant weight to\nconsiderations that fair-minded people would reject (Daniels 2009,\n144).\n\nYet narrowing the class of reasons that count in favor of decisions\nleads to its own problems. The fair-minded and unfair-minded alike\nmight very well disagree about who counts as fair-minded, and,\naccordingly, about which sorts of reasons should count when making\npolicy decisions (Hasman and Holm 2005; Friedman 2008). This leads to\na puzzle about how to determine who counts as fair-minded \u2013\nshould we use another procedure that people could accept in order to\ndetermine which reasons count as those that fair-minded people would\ninvoke? And what should we say to those who espouse reasons that are\ndeemed unsuitable because only the unfair-minded would advance\nthem?\n\nA more fundamental worry is that the focus on which reasons count\ncomplicates rather than helps when trying to reach an acceptable\nresolution to disagreements about various questions relevant to public\nhealth. That is, we need not just to resolve disagreements about the\nimportance of various competing normative considerations when engaged\nin priority-setting, but to resolve disagreements about which\nconsiderations and which reasons should be\n excluded.[28]\n Perhaps the most significant worry about the relevance condition is\nthat it avoids questions of legitimacy that arise due to normative\ndisagreement rather than answering such questions. It is not difficult\nto come to a consensus if we only consider the views of those who\nantecedently agree. Presumably, however, if we accept the importance\nof reaching a decision that is acceptable to people who ultimately\ndisagree with it, then gerrymandering the array of reasons that are\nrelevant to decision-making would seem to be counter-productive.\n3.4 Alternatives to Liberalism\n\nFinally, a different class of views rejects altogether the position\nthat liberalism should be given pride of place in thinking about the\njustification of public health interventions. Recurring charges\ninclude that liberalism fails to accommodate communal values like\nsolidarity; (Dawson and Jennings 2012); that the conception of persons\nas free and equal involves a skewed account of human nature; and that\nliberalism lacks the resources to provide an adequate conception of\nthe public or the common good. For instance, in an agenda-setting\npaper for a non-liberal feminist framework for public health ethics,\nBaylis, Kenny, and Sherwin write, \u201cWe agree with Bruce Jennings\nthat \u2019[t]he liberal framing of public health ethics is useful up to a\npoint, but it is ultimately too narrow to provide normative\njustification for \u2013 or adequate moral insight about \u2013 the\nkinds of social change public health must strive to bring\nabout,\u2019\u201d (Baylis and Kenny and Sherwin 2008,\n 196).[29]\n\nCivic republicans agree with liberals that freedom is a central\n\u2013 or perhaps the central \u2013 value of political morality.\nYet republicans offer a definition of freedom that rivals the one that\nthe liberal proposes. Rather than espousing the liberal position that\nfreedom consists of negative liberty or freedom as non-interference,\nrepublicans claim that conditions of non-domination constitute freedom\n(Pettit 1997; Pettit 2012). While there are a variety of definitions\nof non-domination, two claims typically lie at its core: first, to\nenjoy true freedom, one must be free from arbitrary interference, and\nsecond, one\u2019s freedom from arbitrary interference must be robust\n\u2013 one must enjoy it in a variety of nearby possible worlds. An\noft-employed example to illustrate the distinction between\nnon-interference and non-domination is the case of an enslaved person\nwho has a benevolent slave-owner who permits the enslaved person to do\nwhatever they wish and provides the enslaved person with plentiful\nresources. Yet the enslaver could, if they so chose, prohibit the\nenslaved person from using the provided resources or performing\nvarious actions. Because the enslaver has this power over the enslaved\nperson and could exercise it, the enslaved person does not enjoy\ngenuine freedom. Instead, the enslaved person is dominated (Lovett\n2001; Lovett 2018; Pettit 1997; Pettit 2012; Skinner 1998; Skinner\n2008; see also the\n entry on republicanism).\n\nRepublicans argue that the power to interfere is non-arbitrary \u2013\nand thus non-dominating \u2013 when it is genuinely public. In order\nfor power to be genuinely public, it needs to be subject to procedures\nthat track the interests of those subject to it, typically citizens.\nFor procedures to track these interests, republicans often argue that\nconstitutionally protected rights, as well as a representative and\nreasonably well-functioning democracy, are all necessary. When such\nconditions are satisfied, the public exercises political power in a\nway that ensures that each is free. When political institutions fail\nto track the interests of citizens in the requisite ways, however,\ncitizens are subjection to the arbitrary will of states. Accordingly,\nrather than construing legislation as freedom-restricting, when such\nlegislation tracks the interests of citizens and enables individuals\nto avoid being subject to the arbitrary will of others, democratic\nlegislation enhances freedom (Pettit 1997, 2012).\n\nWhen it comes to public health, some have claimed that civic\nrepublicanism is better-suited than liberalism as a foundational\ntheory (see Jennings 2007; Jennings 2009; Weinstock 2016). Rather than\nfocusing on a purported tension between government action that\npromotes public health and freedom as non-interference, republicans\nargue government has an indispensable role in ensuring that\nindividuals are not subject to the arbitrary will of others as a\nconsequence, for example, of poverty or the need to maintain\nemployer-provided medical insurance. One natural extension of\nrepublican thought in the domain of public health concerns how\npowerful private actors can subject us to their arbitrary will through\nmanipulative advertising or pricing, and unhealthy labor practices. On\nthis proposed application of republican theory, a major role of public\nhealth is to prevent domination by these powerful private actors.\nPublic health agencies are thus described not as interfering with\nfreedom, but as enhancing it.\n\nVarious liberal theorists of public health resist the republican\ncharacterization of their view and the republicans\u2019 claims about the\ndefects of liberalism (Rajczi 2016; Radoilska 2009). Moreover, while\nthe republican approach to public health is provocative, it faces\nsignificant challenges. Some of these problems apply to republicanism\ngenerally. For instance, some object that republicanism gives short\nshrift to the moral importance of non-interference (Larmore 2001; Wall\n2001; List and Valentini 2016). Others have objected that the\n\u2018non-arbitrary\u2019 qualification of being subject to the will\nof another yields counter-intuitive results. For instance, if someone\nis non-arbitrarily imprisoned, then they certainly seem to be\ndominated in any ordinary understanding of \u2018domination.\u2019\nHowever, it seems to follow from the republican definition that the\nindividual is not dominated (List and Valentini 2016).\n\nOther concerns about republicanism focus on the central importance of\ndemocratic decision-making to ensure freedom from non-domination, and\nhere some distinctive issues for public health ethics emerge. As we\nhave noted, public health interventions are frequently implemented or\ndecided upon by agencies that have a relatively limited democratic\npedigree. Advocates of public health can defend the large role of\nadministrative agencies by appeal to a range of justifications,\nincluding realizing conditions of justice, overall benefit, or even\nsome form of paternalism, but it is less clear what republicans can\nsay here (Weinstock 2016). Some might insist that, contrary to what\nsome republican health ethicists claim, republicanism limits the scope\nof public health as currently practiced, since the relatively\nattenuated democratic pedigree of administrative agencies limits their\nmandate. On this sort of view, public health should be more subject to\ndemocratic control. But making public health more democratic to avoid\nworries about non-domination so understood engenders its own problems.\nOne worry is that the rich notions of the public and citizenship as\nproposed by civic republicans are objectionably demanding, given the\namount of time individuals would have to spend engaged in the work of\npolitics (Latham 2016). More fundamentally, to claim that public\nhealth needs to be much more democratic and, therefore, that it enjoys\nless legitimacy than public health advocates currently claim appears\nto undercut the initial motivation for adopting republicanism: to find\na theory that is better-suited than liberalism for legitimating a\nbroad mandate for public health.\n\nAnother worry specific to public health ethics concerns how much of\nthe public health portfolio actually engages in activities that\npromote freedom as non-domination. While many public health\ninterventions, such as those that regulate the health claims of food\nand drug manufacturers, can plausibly be construed as helping to\nadvance freedom as non-domination, many others are harder to fit under\nthis description. Consider, for example, infectious disease\nsurveillance and vaccine programs, or educational campaigns promoting\nphysical activity. It is something of a stretch to claim that these\nkinds of public health policies and practices constitute an\nimprovement to freedom as non-domination. But even if we accept such a\ndescription, any advances to freedom as non-domination seem to be a\ndesirable side effect of the policy rather than the real grounds for\nenacting it. Others \u2013 e.g., (Viens 2016) \u2013 charge that the\nemphasis on individual freedom as non-domination is not much of an\nimprovement over individual freedom as non-interference, since public\nhealth should ultimately be concerned with the well-being of\npopulations rather than individuals.\n\nPerhaps because of these concerns, some who take a republican approach\nto public health ethics work with a more expansive understanding of\nthe appropriate role of government in public health, one that includes\nadvancing the common good as well as promoting freedom as\nnon-domination (Jennings 2007, 46-47). Yet if the promotion of the\ncommon good ultimately justifies a justification for public health\npolicy, then it would seem that we are stuck with something close to\nthe familiar tension between individual freedom, albeit construed as\nfreedom as non-domination, and the common good \u2013 the tension\nthat animates the concerns of those operating out of the liberal\ntradition. And just as the liberal faces questions about how to\nreconcile tensions between the common good and freedom as\nnon-interference, it would seem the republican faces difficult\nquestions about how to reconcile tensions between the common good and\nfreedom as non-domination.\n3.5 Frameworks that Include both Justice and Legitimacy Considerations\n\nAs we noted in the introduction to this entry, many real-world\nchallenges in public health require attending to both questions of\njustice as well as questions of legitimacy in order to provide an\nadequate analysis of what is morally at stake. In keeping with this\nobservation, some have proposed approaches to public health ethics\nthat accord normative importance to individual liberty while also\nallowing for the possibility that, depending on the context, other\nmoral considerations may justifiably outweigh or override this\nnormative\n importance.[30]\n Several influential frameworks for public ethics that are meant to\nprovide practical guidance to public health professionals who wish to\nconsider ethical issues in their decision-making are structured around\nthis view (Kass 2002; Childress et al. 2002; Marckmann et al. 2015;\nPetrini 2010; ten Have et al. 2010). A common thread in these\napproaches is an endorsement of something like principlism developed\nby Tom Beauchamp and James Childress in their influential work on\nbiomedical ethics (Beauchamp and Childress 2019). Ethical\ndecision-making is understood to require the balancing or weighing of\ndifferent moral considerations whose relative relevance or importance\ncan only be discerned in the context of a specific policy or\naction.\n\nIn addition to concerns about legitimacy, individual liberty and\nautonomy, justice, overall benefit and efficiency, these models\ngenerally include other substantive moral considerations such as\nexpressing solidarity, building trust, and giving reasons to the\npublic (Childress et al. 2002) as well as procedural conditions to\nhelp guarantee a fair decision process (Marckmann, et al. 2015;\nBernstein et al. 2020).\n\nEach of these substantive moral considerations can provide a prima\nfacie justification for implementing or rejecting a policy. However,\nwhen these considerations conflict, we must assess their relative\nimportance for the public health policy at issue. Ultimately, both\npublic health ethicists and public health decision-makers need to\nemploy considerable practical judgment to weigh these different kinds\nof considerations in a particular public\nhealth context to determine what policy, if any, ought to be\nimplemented.\n",
