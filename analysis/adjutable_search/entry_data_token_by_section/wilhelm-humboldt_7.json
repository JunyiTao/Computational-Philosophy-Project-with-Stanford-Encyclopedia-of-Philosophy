Humboldt\u2019s Approach to Anthropology, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics\n\nIn his essay \u201cOn Religion\u201d (1789) Humboldt drew the\noutlines of a historical typology that would make it possible to study\nthe relationship between religion and state power from the Greek\ncity-states to present times and envisaged the purpose of the modern\nstate as enabling its citizens to realize fully their \u201chuman\nvocation\u201d (Bestimmung als Mensch, GS Vol 1: S.54). It\nwould be necessary for this purpose, Humboldt thought, to accord a\npositive value to human sensuality and give it a freer and more\ncreative rein. Consequently, he rejected the traditional dualistic\nview of human nature with its mind/body dichotomy and the Cartesian\nnotion of the human spirit as a kind of ghost in the machine. Instead,\nhe maintained, mind and body form a vital unity and what we call\nspirit (Geist) for him was nothing but \u201cthe finest\nramification of sensuality.\u201d The path to self-determination that\nKant had demanded in his moral philosophy must therefore proceed\nthrough the cultivation of man\u2019s sensuality (Sinnlichkeit).\nHence the realm of aesthetics is granted a key function in any attempt\nto overcome the inherited mind/body dichotomy, in which Humboldt saw a\nmajor obstacle in the path of achieving individual self-determination.\nSchiller, in the central sections of his Letters on the Aesthetic\nEducation of Man of 1795 would take up Humboldt\u2019s ideas. In the\ntwentieth century members of the Frankfurt School, such as Herbert\nMarcuse in his book Eros and Civilization, would infuse these\nideas with a renewed sense of relevancy and importance by linking them\nto Freudian psychology in their \u201cCritical Theory\u201d and\nphilosophy. In his two contributions for Schiller\u2019s journal Die\nHoren, Humboldt took the additional step of characterizing sexual\ndifference as basic biological and anthropological givens of human\nculture and society.\n\nHis political writings from this period take issue with the eighteenth\ncentury absolutist idea of the state while at the same time offering a\ncritical analysis of the political situation in contemporary France.\nHumboldt tried to explain the unsuccessful attempts by the French\nNational Assembly to create a lasting constitution and civic order by\nits unrealistic absolutist reliance on principles of abstract reason.\nAs early as 1791 he predicted the fate of the new French constitution\nwhen he argued that \u201cconstitutions cannot be grafted upon human\nbeings as sprigs on a tree.\u201d Where time and nature had not\nprepared the ground, he argued \u201cit would be like tying blossoms\non trees with pieces of twine: the first sunlight at noon will scorch\nthem to death\u201d (GS Vol 1: 80). In order to safeguard the freedom\nof the individual from government encroachment, Humboldt proposed to\nlimit the functions and the authority of the state. This included the\nstate\u2019s endeavors to provide actively for the welfare of its citizens\nwhenever this would cripple or hinder the free development of the\nindividual\u2019s own potential for self-realization. For the \u201ctrue\nend of man\u201d, Humboldt wrote, was \u201cthe highest and most\nharmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent\nwhole\u201d. To reach that goal, freedom was the indispensable\ncondition (GS Vol 1: 107). Yet the free development of the\nindividuals, their self-realization, or Bildung, their\n\u201cself-culture\u201d, as the American Transcendentalists would\ntranslate the term, for Humboldt necessarily implied a social and\npolitical dimension. Self-culture demanded \u201ca manifold of\nsituations\u201d (eine Mannigfaltigkeit der Situationen) for\nthe individual citizens, so that they would be able to enter freely\ninto relationships of association and cooperation with one another,\nbecause, Humboldt argued, humans can realize their potential as\nindividuals only in society. For this reason, Humboldt maintained, a\ngovernment should not be evaluated solely by its legal system that\ngranted freedom and liberty to its citizens but equally by how much\nand to what degree it helped assure the creation of such a manifold of\nsituations and opportunities for the individual citizens to develop\ntheir human capacities in actual reality.\n\nIn his Aesthetische Versuche I (Essays in Aethetics\nI) of 1799 Humboldt employed an unusual and original approach\nthat enabled him to combine successfully three different tasks, namely\na close interpretation of Goethe\u2019s epic poem Hermann und\nDorothea, the laying of the foundations of a new aesthetics and\npoetics proceeding from Kantian transcendental principles and finally\nthe formulation of a theory of literature and literary genres. His\nstarting point is the question: \n\n\nWhat makes it possible for an artist to produce aesthetic effects? (GS\nVol 2: 318) \n\n\nCombining a Kantian questioning from the Critique of Judgment\nwith the performative model of the human mind presented by Fichte in\nhis Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre),\nHumboldt advanced a theory of the imagination\n(Einbildungskraft) that enabled him to explain aesthetic\neffects as an interactive process involving the triad of artist, work\nof art and recipient. \n\nArt in its most basic sense is to be understood as the transformation\nof what is real into an image (Das Wirkliche in ein Bild zu\nverwandeln, GS Vol 2: 126, de transformer en image ce qui,\ndans la nature est r\u00e9el\u201d, GS Vol 1: 1). The art of\nthe poet, more specifically, \u201cconsists in his ability or\ncompetence (Fertigkeit) to render the imagination creative\naccording to rules\u201d, to incite the imagination through the\nimagination (GS Vol 2: 127) and thereby create \u201ca live act of\ncommunication\u201d (lebendige Mitteilung) (GS Vol 2: 132).\nAmong all the arts poetry occupies a special position in Humboldt\u2019s\nview, because the material from which it is fashioned is not like\nordinary material, as the stone or marble the sculptor uses, but\ninstead consists of something already endowed with form, namely\nlanguage. Poetry therefore \u201cis art through language\u201d.\nThrough his imagination the poet creates works that represent \u201ca\nworld\u201d embodying a totality of their own that differs in\nprinciple from the world of reality. In his definition of art Humboldt\nno longer looks at artworks as objects in order to gather from them a\nlist of quasi objective qualities from which the nature of art could\nthen be derived, but instead focuses on the process of aesthetic\nproduction and the rules by which it is governed and on how these\nrules are revealed in the poet\u2019s art. In other words, a generative one\nhas replaced the traditional mimetic or objective concept of art. \n",
