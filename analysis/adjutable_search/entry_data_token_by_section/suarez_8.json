    "main_text": "Political Authority\n4. Political Authority\n\nWhat, if anything, makes political subjection legitimate? For\nSu\u00e1rez, the question is compelling given that \u201cman is by\nhis nature free and subject to no one, save only to the Creator\u201d\n(DL III, 1.1).\n\nAs Su\u00e1rez conceives of the basic position of humanity, the\ninhabitants of a hypothetical pre-political state would have two main\nreasons to try to transcend it. First, families, the basic unit of\nhuman organization, are not self-sufficient: they contain within\nthemselves neither the offices nor the arts necessary for survival.\nThey simply lack the requisite knowledge. Secondly, evoking the idea\nof a state of war, Su\u00e1rez argues that if families were divided\nfrom one another, peace could hardly be preserved among men, nor could\nwrongs be duly averted or avenged (Defensio fidei catholicae, et\napostolicae adversus anglicanae sectae errores, III.1.4, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia XXIV). Inhabitants of the\npre-political state are thus capable of envisaging a possible\npolitical state, in which cooperation between families exists for some\ncommon purpose. They can thus realize that power must be vested in one\nor some individuals because \u201cnobody can be preserved unless\nthere exists some principle whose function is to provide for and seek\nits common good\u201d (DL III, 1.4\u20135).\n\nThe constitutive act of the community cannot simply be a decision by\neach family to live in proximity to each other and interact\npeacefully. This would create, at most, a certain familiarity or\nfriendship, but would fail to generate what Su\u00e1rez terms a\n\u201cmoral union\u201d. This moral union originates instead in the\nassumption of the duties and obligations that make political life\npossible. These, in turn, are incurred by an act of \u201cexpress or\ntacit pact\u201d between the would-be citizens to help each other,\ntogether with their consent to subordinate themselves to a superior\n(De opere sex dierum, V.7.3, in Su\u00e1rez, Opera\nomnia\n III).[16]\n\nThis view places Su\u00e1rez very close to the social contract\nschool. It is a central tenet of this school that the citizens\ncontract an obligation towards the political authority because they\nhave given express, tacit, or hypothetical consent to it. Some of\nSu\u00e1rez's interpreters have resisted this conclusion, arguing\nthat, for him, although consent creates the state, it does not\ndirectly cause political obligation. In this interpretation, just as\nthe right of a person to rule over his body \u201cnaturally\nresults\u201d (to use Su\u00e1rez's phrase) from his being a person\nand is independent from the means by which he was generated (so that,\nsay, an in vitro generated human being would also have these\nrights), so the right of the ruler(s) to rule over the city naturally\nflows from the fact that the city is a city, independently from the\nconsent that generated it.\n\nOther interpreters, such as Schwartz, argue that, for Su\u00e1rez,\nconsent directly causes political obligation without the mediation of\nthe political community (Schwartz 2008). What the political community\ncauses by \u201cnatural resultancy\u201d is not the citizens'\npolitical subjection to the ruler. Rather, it is the community's\noriginal rightful incumbency to the role of the ruler (its\nself-mastership). For Su\u00e1rez, to say that the self-mastership\nof the political community emanates by natural resultancy is simply a\nway of saying that this mastership has no external cause (such as\nGod). The right to self-rule of the political community has the same\norigin as the political community itself: consent. This effect is not\nmediated by any intervening cause.\n\nNote that for Su\u00e1rez the ruler's power is not the result of a\ntransfer or alienation of individual self-rule rights. Hence,\nSu\u00e1rez's ruler is not, as in Hobbes, the depositary of a part\nof the citizens' right over themselves. The seat of power remains\nalways, if only latently, with the community (Schwartz 2008: 71).\n",
