    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe field of climate science emerged in the second half of the\ntwentieth century. Though it is sometimes also referred to as\n\u201cclimatology\u201d, it differs markedly from the field of\nclimatology that came before. That climatology, which existed from the\nlate-nineteenth century (if not earlier), was an inductive science, in\nmany ways more akin to geography than to physics; it developed systems\nfor classifying climates based on empirical criteria and, by the\nmid-twentieth century, was increasingly focused on the calculation of\nstatistics from weather observations (Nebeker 1995; Edwards 2010;\nWeart 2008 [2017, Other Internet Resources]; Heymann & Achermann\nforthcoming). Climate science, by contrast, aims to explain and\npredict the workings of a global climate system\u2014encompassing the\natmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice sheets and more\u2014and it\nmakes extensive use of both theoretical knowledge and mathematical\nmodeling. In fact, the emergence of climate science is closely linked\nto the rise of digital computing, which made it possible to simulate\nthe large-scale motions of the atmosphere and oceans using fluid\ndynamical equations that were otherwise intractable; these motions\ntransport mass, heat, moisture and other quantities that shape\nparadigmatic climate variables, such as average surface temperature\nand rainfall. Today, complex computer models that represent a wide\nrange of climate system processes are a mainstay of climate\nresearch.\n\nThe emergence of climate science is also linked to the issue of\nanthropogenic climate change. In recent decades, growing concern about\nclimate change has brought a substantial influx of funding for climate\nresearch. It is a misconception, however, that climate science\njust is the study of anthropogenic climate change. On the\ncontrary, there has been, and continues to be, a significant body of\nresearch within climate science that addresses fundamental questions\nabout the workings of the climate system. This includes questions\nabout how energy flows in the system, about the roles of particular\nphysical processes in shaping climates, about the interactions that\noccur among climate system components, about natural oscillations\nwithin the system, about climate system feedbacks, about the\npredictability of the climate system, and much more.\n\nThis entry provides an overview of some of the core concepts and\npractices of contemporary climate science, along with philosophical\nwork that engages with them. Thus far, most of this philosophical work\nhas focused on the epistemology of climate modeling and\nclosely-related topics.\n Section 2\n introduces a few basic concepts: climate system, climate and climate\nchange.\n Section 3\n turns to climate data, highlighting some of the complexities and\nchallenges that arise when producing three important types of climate\ndataset.\n Section 4\n focuses on climate modeling, briefly describing some of the main types\nof climate model employed today and then considering in more detail\nthe construction, use and evaluation of complex global climate models.\nFinally,\n Section 5\n discusses research in climate science that addresses the issue of\nanthropogenic climate change, as well as several recent controversies\nrelated to this research; it also provides some pointers to the large\nliterature that has emerged on ethics and climate change.\n",
