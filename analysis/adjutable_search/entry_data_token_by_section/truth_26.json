Because of this, any such theory will imply a strong, but\nvery particular, biconditional, close in form to the Tarski\nbiconditionals. It can be made most vivid if we think of propositions\nas sets of truth conditions. Let \\(p\\) be a proposition, i.e., a\nset of truth conditions, and let \\(a\\) be the \u2018actual\nworld\u2019, the condition that actually obtains. Then we can almost\ntrivially see:\n\n\\(p\\) is true if and only if \\(a \\in p\\).\n\n\nThis is presumably necessary. But it is important to observe that it\nis in one respect crucially different from the genuine Tarski\nbiconditionals. It makes no use of a non-quoted sentence, or in fact\nany sentence at all. It does not have the disquotational character of\nthe Tarski biconditionals.\n\nThough this may look like a principle that deflationists should\napplaud, it is not. Rather, it shows that deflationists cannot really\nhold a truth-conditional view of content at all. If they do, then they\ninter alia have a non-deflationary theory of truth, simply by\nlinking truth value to truth conditions through the above\nbiconditional. It is typical of thoroughgoing deflationist theories to\npresent a non-truth-conditional theory of the contents of sentences: a\nnon-truth-conditional account of what makes truth-bearers meaningful.\nWe take it this is what is offered, for instance, by the use\ntheory of propositions in Horwich (1990). It is certainly one of the\nleading ideas of Field (1986; 1994), which explore how a conceptual\nrole account of content would ground a deflationist view of truth.\nOnce one has a non-truth-conditional account of content, it is then\npossible to add a deflationist truth predicate, and use this to give\npurely deflationist statements of truth conditions. But the starting\npoint must be a non-truth-conditional view of what makes truth-bearers\nmeaningful.\n\nBoth deflationists and anti-realists start with something other than\ncorrespondence truth conditions. But whereas an anti-realist will\npropose a different theory of truth conditions, a deflationists will\nstart with an account of content which is not a theory of truth\nconditions at all. The deflationist will then propose that the truth\npredicate, given by the Tarski biconditionals, is an additional\ndevice, not for understanding content, but for disquotation. It is a\nuseful device, as we discussed in section 5.3, but it has nothing to\ndo with content. To a deflationist, the meaningfulness of\ntruth-bearers has nothing to do with truth.\n",
