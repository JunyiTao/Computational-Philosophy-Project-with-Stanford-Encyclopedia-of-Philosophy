Central Features of the Common Good\n\nAccording to a common good conception of political morality, members\nof a political community stand in a social relationship with one\nanother. This relationship is not as intimate as the relationship\namong family members or the members of a church. But it is a genuine\nsocial relationship nonetheless, and it requires members not only to\nact in certain ways, but also to give one another\u2019s interests a\ncertain status in their practical reasoning. This basic outlook leads most\nconceptions of the common good to share certain features.\n",
