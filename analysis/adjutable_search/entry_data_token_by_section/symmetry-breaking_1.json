Symmetry Principles\n\nThe first explicit study of the invariance properties of equations in\nphysics is connected with the introduction, in the first half of the\nnineteenth century, of the transformational approach to the problem of\nmotion in the framework of analytical mechanics. Using the formulation\nof the dynamical equations of mechanics due to W. R. Hamilton (known\nas the Hamiltonian or canonical formulation), C. G. Jacobi developed a\nprocedure for arriving at the solution of the equations of motion\nbased on the strategy of applying transformations of the variables\nthat leave the Hamiltonian equations invariant, thereby transforming\nstep by step the original problem into new ones that are simpler but\nperfectly equivalent (for further details see Lanczos\n 1949).[5]\n Jacobi\u2019s canonical transformation theory, although introduced\nfor the \u201cmerely instrumental\u201d purpose of solving dynamical\nproblems, led to a very important line of research: the general study\nof physical theories in terms of their transformation properties.\nExamples of this are the studies of invariants under canonical\ntransformations, such as Poisson brackets or Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nintegral invariants; the theory of continuous canonical\ntransformations due to S. Lie; and, finally, the connection between\nthe study of physical invariants and the algebraic and geometric\ntheory of invariants that flourished in the second half of the\nnineteenth century, and which laid the foundation for the geometrical\napproach to dynamical problems. The use of the mathematics of group\ntheory to study physical theories was central to the work, early in\nthe twentieth century in G\u00f6ttingen, of the group whose central\nfigures were F. Klein (who earlier collaborated with Lie) and D.\nHilbert, and which included H. Weyl and later E. Noether. We will\nreturn later in this section to Weyl (see\n Sections 2.1.2,\n 2.2,\n 2.5)\n and Noether (see\n Section 2.1.2).\n For more details on these developments see Brading and Castellani\n(2007).\n\nOn the above approach, the equations or expressions of physical\ninterest are already given, and the strategy is to study their\nsymmetry properties. There is, however, an alternative way of\nproceeding, namely the reverse one: start with specific symmetries and\nsearch for dynamical equations with such properties. In other words,\nwe postulate that certain symmetries are physically\nsignificant, rather than deriving them from prior dynamical equations.\nThe assumption of certain symmetries in nature is not, of course, a\nnovelty. Although not explicitly expressed as symmetry principles, the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of physical space, and the uniformity of time\n(forming together with the invariance under Galilean boosts \u201cthe\nolder principles of invariance\u201d \u2014 see Wigner\n 1967,[6]\n pp. 4\u20135), have been assumed as prerequisites in the physical\ndescription of the world since the beginning of modern science.\nPerhaps the most famous early example of the deliberate use of this\ntype of symmetry principle is Galileo\u2019s discussion of whether\nthe Earth moves in his Dialogue concerning the two chief world\nsystems of 1632. Galileo sought to neutralize the standard\narguments purporting to show that, simply by looking around us at how\nthings behave locally on Earth \u2014 how stones fall, how birds fly\n\u2014 we can conclude that the Earth is at rest rather than\nrotating, arguing instead that these observations do not enable us to\ndetermine the state of motion of the Earth. His approach was to use an\nanalogy with a ship: he urges us to consider the behaviour of objects,\nboth animate and inanimate, inside the cabin of a ship, and claims\nthat no experiments carried out inside the cabin, without reference to\nanything outside the ship, would enable us to tell whether the ship is\nat rest or moving smoothly across the surface of the Earth. The\nassumption of a symmetry between rest and a certain kind of\nmotion leads to the prediction of this result, without the need to\nknow the details of the laws governing the experiments on the ship.\nThe \u201cGalilean principle of relativity\u201d (according to which\nthe laws of physics are invariant under Galilean boosts, where the\nstates of motion considered are now those of uniform velocity) was\nquickly adopted as an axiom and widely used in the seventeenth\ncentury, notably by Huygens in his solution to the problem of\ncolliding bodies and by Newton in his early work on motion. Huygens\ntook the relativity principle as his 3rd hypothesis or axiom, but in\nNewton\u2019s Principia it is demoted to a corollary to the laws of\nmotion, its status in Newtonian physics therefore being that of a\nconsequence of the laws, even though it remains, in fact, an\nindependent assumption.\n\nAlthough the spatial and temporal invariance of mechanical laws was\nknown and used for a long time in physics, and the group of the global\nspacetime symmetries for electrodynamics was completely derived by H.\nPoincar\u00e9\n [7]\n before Einstein\u2019s famous 1905 paper setting out his special\ntheory of relativity, it was not until this work by Einstein that the\nstatus of symmetries with respect to the laws was reversed. E. P.\nWigner (1967, p. 5) writes that \u201cthe significance and general\nvalidity of these principles were recognized, however, only by\nEinstein\u201d, and that Einstein\u2019s work on special relativity\nmarks \u201cthe reversal of a trend: until then, the principles of\ninvariance were derived from the laws of motion \u2026 It is now\nnatural for us to derive the laws of nature and to test their validity\nby means of the laws of invariance, rather than to derive the laws of\ninvariance from what we believe to be the laws of nature\u201d. In\npostulating the universality of the global continuous spacetime\nsymmetries, Einstein\u2019s construction of his special theory of\nrelativity represents the first turning point in the application of\nsymmetry to twentieth-century\n physics.[8]\n",
