    "main_text": "Scientific Knowledge, History, and Prediction\n9. Scientific Knowledge, History, and Prediction\n\nHistoricism and holism, Popper argues, have their origins in what he\nterms\n\n\none of the oldest dreams of mankind\u2014the dream of prophecy, the\nidea that we can know what the future has in store for us, and that we\ncan profit from such knowledge by adjusting our policy to it. (1963:\n338)\n\n\nThis dream was given impetus, he suggests, by the emergence of a\ngenuine predictive capability regarding solar and lunar eclipses at an\nearly stage in human civilisation, which became refined with the\ndevelopment of the natural sciences. Historicism derives a superficial\nplausibility from the suggestion that, just as the application of the\nlaws of the natural sciences can lead to the prediction of such events\nas eclipses, knowledge of \u201cthe laws of history\u201d as yielded\nby a social science or sciences can and should lead to the prediction\nof future social phenomena. Why should we not conceive of a social\nscience which would function as the theoretical natural sciences\nfunction and yield precise unconditional predictions in the\nappropriate sphere of application? Popper seeks to show that this idea\nis based upon a series of misconceptions about the nature of science,\nand about the relationship between scientific laws and scientific\nprediction.\n\nIn relation to the critically important concept of prediction, Popper\nmakes a distinction between what he terms \u201cconditional\nscientific predictions\u201d, which have the form \u201cIf\nX takes place, then Y will take place\u201d, and\n\u201cunconditional scientific prophecies\u201d, which have the form\n\u201cY will take place\u201d. Contrary to popular belief,\nit is the former rather than the latter which are typical of the\nnatural sciences, which means that typically prediction in natural\nscience is conditional and limited in scope\u2014it takes the form of\nhypothetical assertions stating that certain specified changes will\ncome about if and only if particular specified events antecedently\ntake place. This is not to deny that \u201cunconditional scientific\nprophecies\u201d, such as the prediction of eclipses, for example, do\ntake place in science, and that the theoretical natural sciences make\nthem possible. However, Popper argues that (a) these unconditional\nprophecies are not characteristic of the natural sciences,\nand (b) that the mechanism whereby they occur, in the very limited way\nin which they do, is not understood by the historicist.\n\nWhat is the mechanism which makes \u201cunconditional scientific\nprophecies\u201d possible? Popper\u2019s answer is that they are\npossible because they are derived from a combination of conditional\npredictions (themselves derived from scientific laws) and\nexistential statements specifying that the conditions in relation to\nthe system being investigated are fulfilled.\n\nGiven that this is the mechanism which generates unconditional\nscientific prophecies, Popper makes two related claims about\nhistoricism:\n\n\nThe first is that the historicist does not, as a matter of fact,\nderive his historical prophecies from conditional scientific\npredictions. The second \u2026 is that he cannot possibly do so\nbecause long term prophecies can be derived from scientific\nconditional predictions only if they apply to systems which can be\ndescribed as well isolated, stationary, and recurrent. These systems\nare very rare in nature; and modern society is surely not one of them.\n(1963: 339)\n\n\nPopper accordingly argues that it is a fundamental mistake for the\nhistoricist to take the unconditional scientific prophecies of\neclipses as being typical and characteristic of the predictions of\nnatural science; they are possible only because our solar system is a\nstationary and repetitive system which is isolated from other such\nsystems by immense expanses of empty space. Human society and human\nhistory are not isolated systems and are continually\nundergoing rapid, non-repetitive development. In the most fundamental\nsense possible, every event in human history is discrete, novel, quite\nunique, and ontologically distinct from every other historical event.\nFor this reason, it is impossible in principle that unconditional\nscientific prophecies could be made in relation to human\nhistory\u2014the idea that the successful unconditional prediction of\neclipses provides us with reasonable grounds for the hope of\nsuccessful unconditional prediction regarding the evolution of human\nhistory turns out to be based upon a gross misconception. As Popper\nsuccinctly concludes, \u201cThe fact that we predict eclipses does\nnot, therefore, provide a valid reason for expecting that we can\npredict revolutions\u201d (1963: 340).\n",
