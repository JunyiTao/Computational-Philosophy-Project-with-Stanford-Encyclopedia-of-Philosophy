    "main_text": "Creation and the big bang || Does the big bang provide evidence for atheism?\n2.5 Does the big bang provide evidence for atheism?\n\nMost philosophers and physicists have thought that big bang cosmology\nis either neutral towards, or supportive of, traditional theism. Thus,\natheists have usually taken a defensive stance, trying to defeat the\narguments of the big-bang theologians. But a vocal minority\u2014we\nmight call them \u201cbig-bang atheologians\u201d\u2014have made\nthe stronger claim that big bang cosmology disconfirms theism. The\nmost visible proponents of this big-bang atheology are the\nphilosophers Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum and Quentin Smith. In the case of\nSmith, quantum cosmologies are taken to provide even stronger evidence\nagainst theism.\n\nIn putting forward their arguments, big-bang atheologians make a\nnumber of points that seem to have been overlooked by their theistic\ncounterparts. One such point is that FRW cosmological models have no\nfirst state. Thus, a theist who invokes the big bang cannot say that\nthere is a state of the universe, say \u0391, such that God created\nthe universe in state \u0391. He or she will have to invoke a more\nsophisticated notion of God creating initial temporal intervals, or\nsomething like that. Are these more sophisticated developments still\nconsonant with traditional theology?\n\nBig-bang atheologians also argue that it makes no sense to accept both\nthat there were no times before the big bang (since time itself comes\ninto existence with the universe) and that the universe was caused. Of\ncourse, many theists claim that God causes the universe timelessly,\nand they would attempt to defend the coherence of such a notion in the\nface of these criticisms.\n\nThe case of quantum cosmology provides further complications for\ntheology. Without going into excessive detail of specific proposals, a\ncommon theme of many quantum cosmologies is that they postulate a\nprobability distribution over universes themselves. In other words,\nquantum cosmologies provide a measure of likelihood that certain sorts\nof universes exist. Some older quantum cosmologies (e.g.,\nHawking\u2019s early proposals) still predict that the universe is\nfinitely old. And yet, one might consider their further explanatory\npower\u2014over and above classical general relativity\u2014as\nundermining theistic explanations of the universe. In particular,\nquantum cosmology predicts with a high probability that a universe\nlike ours would exist. Seen from this perspective, one might take\nquantum cosmologies to offer a competing, non-theistic explanation for\nthe origin of the universe.\n\nTheists have argued, in response, that quantum cosmologies do not\nprovide unconditional probabilities for the existence of the\nuniverse. For example, Craig (1997), Deltete & Guy (1997), and\nOppy (1997) argue that quantum cosmologies provide only conditional\nprobabilities for the existence of some universe configurations given\nother universe configurations. Smith (1998) responds by defending the\nclaim that the probabilities in quantum cosmology are unconditional.\nBut neither side of this debate has attended to the special\ncomplications involved in interpreting quantum, rather than\nclassical, probabilities. For example, Smith treats the universal\nwavefunction\n\u03a8(hi\u2009j,\u2009f) as\nproviding a probability distribution over universe configurations\n(hi\u2009j,\u2009f). But we know,\nfrom elementary quantum mechanics, that it is literally inconsistent\n(i.e., leads to contradictions) to treat a wavefunction as giving\nprobabilities in an absolute sense. (This contradiction is derived by\nthe famous Kochen-Specker theorem.) We conclude that in order for the\nmetaphysical significance of quantum cosmologies to be assessed, a\nmore nuanced consideration of the interpretation of quantum mechanics\nwill be required.\n",
