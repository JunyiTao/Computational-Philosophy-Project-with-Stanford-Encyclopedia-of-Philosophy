    "main_text": "New approaches to fallacies || The epistemic approach to fallacies\n3.5 The epistemic approach to fallacies\n\nSDF may be seen as closely tied to the logical approach to\nfallacies\u2014the fault in arguments it singles out is their\ndeductive invalidity. But this conception of fallacies turns out to be\ninadequate to cover the variety of the core fallacies in two ways: it\nis too narrow because it excludes begging the question which is not\ninvalid, and it is too wide because it condemns good but non-deductive\narguments as fallacies (given that they also satisfy the appearance\ncondition) because they are invalid. Even if we replace the invalidity\ncondition in SDF with some less stringent standard of logical weakness\nwhich could overcome the \u201ctoo wide\u201d problem, it would\nstill leave the difficulty of accounting for the fallacy of begging\nthe question unsolved.\n\nSiegel and Biro (1992, 1995) hold an epistemic account of fallacies,\ncontrasting their view with dialectical/rhetorical approaches, because\nmatters extraneous to arguments, such as being a practice that leads\nto false beliefs or not being persuasive, are not in their view a\nsufficient condition to make an argument a fallacy. They take the\nposition that \u201cit is a conceptual truth about arguments that\ntheir central \u2026 purpose is to provide a bridge from known\ntruths or justified beliefs to as yet unknown \u2026 truths or as\nyet unjustified beliefs\u201d (1992, 92). Only arguments that are\n\u201cepistemically serious\u201d can accomplish this; that is, only\narguments that satisfy the extra-formal requirement that premises are\nknowable independently of their conclusions, and are more acceptable\nepistemically than their conclusions, can fulfill this function. A\npurely logical approach to argument will not capture this requirement\nbecause arguments of the same valid form, but with different contents,\nmay or may not be epistemically serious, depending on whether the\npremises are epistemically acceptable relative to the conclusion.\n\nModifying Biro\u2019s (1977, 265\u201366) examples we can\ndemonstrate how the requirement of epistemic seriousness plays out\nwith begging the question. Consider these two arguments:\n\n\nAll men are mortal;\n\nObama is a man;\n\nSo, Obama is mortal.\n\nAll members of the committee are old Etonians;\n\nFortesque is a member of the committee;\n\nFortesque is an old Etonian.\n\n\nIn the first argument the premises are knowable independently of the\nconclusion. The major premise can be deduced from other universal\npremises about animals, and the minor premise, unlike the conclusion\nwhich must be inferred, can be known by observation. Hence, this\nargument does not beg the question. However, in the second argument\n(due to Biro, 1977) given the minor premise, the major cannot be known\nto be true unless the conclusion is known to be true. Consequently, on\nthe epistemic approach to fallacies taken by Biro and Siegel, the\nsecond argument, despite the fact that it is valid, is non-serious, it\nbegs the question, and it is a fallacy. If there was some independent\nway of knowing whether the major premise was true, such as that it was\na bylaw that only old Etonians could be committee members, the\nargument would be a serious one, and not beg the question.\n\nBiro and Siegel\u2019s epistemic account of fallacies is\ndistinguishable in at least three ways. First, it insists that the\nfunction of arguments is epistemic, and therefore anything that counts\nas a fallacy must be an epistemic fault, a breaking of a rule of\nepistemic justification. But since logical faults are also epistemic\nfaults, the epistemic approach to fallacies will include logical\nfallacies, although these must also be explicable in terms of\nepistemic seriousness. Second, since the epistemological approach does\nnot insist that all justification must be deductive, it allows the\npossibility of their being fallacies (as well as good arguments) by\nnon-deductive standards, something precluded by SDF. Finally, we\nnotice that the appearance condition is not considered a factor in\nthis discussion of fallacies.\n\nUlrike Hahn and Mike Oaksford (2006a, 2006b) see themselves as\ncontributing to the epistemic approach to fallacy analysis by\ndeveloping a probabilistic analysis of the fallacies. It is part of\ntheir programme for a normative theory of natural language\nargumentation. They are motivated by what they perceive as the\nshortcomings in other approaches. The logical (deductive) approach\nfalls short in that it simply divides arguments into valid and invalid\narguments thereby failing to appreciate that natural language\narguments come in various degrees of strength. The alternative\napproaches to fallacies, given by procedural (dialectical) and\nconsensual accounts, they criticize on the basis that they fail to\naddress the central problem raised by the fallacies: that of the\nstrength of the reason-claim complex. In Hahn and Oaksford\u2019s\nview the strength or weakness of the classical fallacies (they are\nconcerned mostly with the post-Aristotelian ones) is not a result of\ntheir structure or their context of use. It is instead a matter of the\nrelationship between the evidence and the claim (the contents of the\npremises and the conclusion). Evaluation of this relationship is\nthought to be best captured by a probabilistic Bayesian account;\naccordingly, they adapt Bayes\u2019 theorem to arguments evaluation\nwith the proviso that the probabilities are subjective degrees of\nbelief, not frequencies. \u201cAn argument\u2019s strength,\u201d\nthey write, \u201cis a function of an individual\u2019s initial\nlevel of belief in the claim, the availability and observation of\nconfirmatory (or disconfirmatory) evidence, and the existence and\nperceived strength of competing hypotheses\u201d (Corner, et al.\n1145). With Korb (2003) they view a fallacy as an argument with a low\nprobability on the Bayesian model.\n\nSince the variance in input probabilities will result in a range of\noutputs in argument strength, this probabilistic approach has the\npotential to assign argument strengths anywhere between 0 and 1,\nthereby allowing that different tokens of one argument type can vary\ngreatly in strength, i.e., some will be fallacies and others not.\nAlso, and this seems to concur with our experience, different arguers\nmay disagree on the strength of the same arguments since they can\ndiffer in the assignments of the initial probabilities. Hahn and\nOaksford also claim as advantages for their normative theory that it\ngives guidance for persuasion since it takes into account the initial\nbeliefs of audiences. Moreover, their approach contributes to the\nstudy of belief change; that is, to what extent our confidence in the\nconclusion changes with the availability of new evidence. \n",
