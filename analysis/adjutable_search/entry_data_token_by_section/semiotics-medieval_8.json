Mental concepts as signs\n\n\nIn 12th- and early 13th-century logical\ntextbooks the concept of sign does not play an important role yet.\n\u2018Sign\u2019 in its technical sense is taken as the name of the\nso-called syncategorematic terms (e.g., omnis [every],\nnullus [no] as signa universalia or universal signs,\nquidam [a certain], aliquis [some] as signa\nparticularia or particular signs) (L. M. de Rijk, 1965\u201367,\nII/2.383).[41]\n In line with the text of Aristotle's\nPeri Hermeneias and its translation by Boethius, only written\nand spoken words were said to signify. Mental concepts (passiones\nanimae, intellectus, conceptus) were seen as\nlikenesses (similitudines) rather than as signs of things.\nOnce again, it is the mid-13th century where a conceptual\nchange is taking place which, although at first it may seem to be a\nmatter of nuance, turns out to be one of the most important junctures\nin the history of semiotics: mental concepts \u2014 without at first\nlosing their status of being likenesses of things \u2014 begin to be\ncharacterized as signs of things (signa rerum). It is true\nthat there are some few passages in Boethius, Anselm, and Abelard\nalready pointing in this direction (Boethius, In Periherm. ed.\nsec., 1880, 24; cf. Magee, 1989, 71; Anselm of Canterbury,\nMonolog., 1968, 25; Abelard, Log.\n\u2018Ingredientibus\u2019, 1927, 315f.). But it is not until\nthe second half of 13th century that this idea achieves\ngeneral acceptance and gains relevance to the theory of\n sign.[42]\n\n\nThe consequences of this view are many: for instance, the rejection,\nor at least the modification, of Augustine's venerable definition of\nthe sign, and the new possibility to describe the relationship between\nthe concept and its object without referring to the notion of\nsimilitude. Furthermore, in the semantic triangle, the Boethian\nordo orandi now can be described entirely in terms of sign and\nsignificate.[43]\n Insofar as concepts agree with vocal\nexpressions in their function of being signs, it makes sense to\nconceive of thought processes as a kind of mental speech (oratio\nmentalis) showing close analogies to spoken discourse. This again\npaves the way for the development of a mentalist logic, the principal\nobjects of which are not the vocal terms and propositions any longer,\nbut rather the corresponding mental acts. The definition of mental\nconcepts as signa rerum also provides the basis of a close\ninterconnection of logic and epistemology as it is characteristic\nespecially of the later Middle Ages. In conjunction with this, a\nredefinition of the notion of signification (significare) is\ntaking place. For where the mental concepts, i.e., the acts of\nunderstanding (intellectus), are considered to be signs\nthemselves, the Aristotelian definition of significare\n(signifying) as to constitute an understanding (constituere\nintellectum) can no longer be regarded as adequate. As a result,\nthe terminology of \u2018representation\u2019\n(repraesentatio, repraesentare, facere\npraesens), originally used mainly in epistemological contexts,\nachieves an increasing importance for logical semantics by being fused\nwith the terminology of \u2018signification\u2019. Finally, the\ndescription of mental concepts as signs can also be seen as one of the\nmain motifs for the general account of signs as it emerges in late\nmedieval logic. For it is only under this condition that logic is no\nlonger concerned exclusively with arbitrary signs but also \u2014 and\neven primarily \u2014 with natural signs.\n",
