    "main_text": "\n\nJoseph Butler is best known for his criticisms of the hedonic and\negoistic \u201cselfish\u201d theories associated with Hobbes and\nBernard Mandeville and for his positive arguments that self-love and\nconscience are not at odds if properly understood (and indeed promote\nand sanction the same actions). In addition to his importance as a\nmoral philosopher Butler was also an influential Anglican theologian.\nUnsurprisingly his theology and philosophy were connected \u2014 his\nmain writings in moral philosophy were published sermons, a work of\nnatural theology, and a brief dissertation attached to that work.\nAlthough most of Butler\u2019s moral arguments make rich use of\npassages from scripture and familiar Christian stories and concepts,\nthey make little reference to \u2014 and depend little on the reader\nhaving \u2014 any particular religious commitments. Indeed many of\nhis arguments do not rest on the reader having any religious\ncommitments at all. His Analogy of Religion was aimed to\nconvince deists of the truth of core doctrines of natural and revealed\ntheology but the argument only assumes the premises Butler shared with\nthem. This has led to his philosophy being of interest to both secular\nand Christian moralists, and to debate as to how much and what of his\nethics rests on his Christian commitments.\n",
