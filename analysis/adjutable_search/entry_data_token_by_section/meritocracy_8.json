    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance || Limited epistocracy\n3.4 Limited epistocracy\n\nThe aforementioned proposals would radically change political\npractice. As such, they invite a criticism that they are\ninsufficiently democratic\n (\u00a75.3).\n This has led some philosophers to develop \u201climited\nepistocracies\u201d which would improve political performance without\nstraying too far from the democratic status quo.\n\nPerhaps, for example, we can provide extra political influence to\ncitizens who know \u201cbasic political facts\u201d (Gibbons\n2021)\u2014facts which are both politically relevant and\nuncontroversial, like candidates\u2019 policy platforms. Or perhaps\n\u201cspecialized institutions\u201d (Jeffrey 2018), like the World\nHealth Organization, can be granted unilateral\u2014but narrow or\ntemporary\u2014political power via the democratic process.\n\nThere is no obvious dividing line between democracy and political\nmeritocracy. All contemporary democracies seek to harness expertise,\nalbeit to different extents and through different processes. The U.S.\nSenate, for example, was envisioned as a \u201cportion of enlightened\ncitizens\u201d (Madison 1787: Tuesday, June 26) to serve as a bulwark\nagainst the \u201cfickleness and passion\u201d of the more\ndemocratic House of Representatives. Institutions like that plausibly\nqualify as limited epistocracies and might be defended on those\ngrounds.\n",
