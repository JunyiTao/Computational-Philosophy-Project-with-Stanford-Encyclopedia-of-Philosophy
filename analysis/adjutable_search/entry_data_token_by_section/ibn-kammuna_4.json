    "main_text": "Philosophy: Following the Thread of Intuition || Introduction\n5.1 Introduction\n\n\nIbn Kammuna looms as a philosophical writer, a learned and keen\nstudent, who bequeathed to posterity not a \u201cphilosophy\u201d\nbut rather a rich assortment of philosophical studies. Some, such as\nhis New Wisdom, aimed at a synthesis; others, like his\ncommentary to Suhrawardi, are primarily an essay in the interpretation\nof the thought of others; yet others, e.g., the monographs mentioned\nin the preceding section, address specific issues to whose resolution\nIbn Kammuna feels he can contribute. Scholarship on his output,\nhowever, has displayed less interest in literary form, intended\naudience, and specific objectives; instead, in keeping with an\nacademic tradition, it has focused by and large upon the\nidentification of his \u201csources\u201d, even at the level of\nsentence by sentence, or phrase by phrase, analysis. This approach has\nreaped some important insights, for example, the combination of\nAvicennan and Suhrawardian statements in connection with the notion of\nexistence.\n\n\nOne drawback of this approach is the patchwork image it impresses upon\nthe modern student, as if Ibn Kammuna set out to prepare a quiltwork of\nphilosophical sources rather than to take a stand on the issues. But is\nthis the way his writings present themselves to the reader who is\ninnocent of academic scholarship? Ibn Kammuna is aware of the\nquestions that are under debate, and as a rule he formulates a clear\npoint of view.  Nonetheless, his views may well have changed over the\nyears\u2014not at all surprising, if, as some think, he made the more\ntraumatic act of switching religious affiliation. It is in any event\nclear enough that his expressions, emphases, agreements and\ndisagreements, inclusions and exclusions, were in part functions of\nthe literary genre which he chose for any given work. He could be\ncritical in his commentaries, insofar as he would look closely at the\ntext he was explicating and cite alternative views, but he would not\nreject outright the views of the author whose work he was commenting\nupon. In his original writings he was freer to take a personal\nstand.\n\n\nIf we also keep in mind the nascent state of scholarship on the man\nand the period in which he flourished, the best course of action for\nthe present essay seems to be this.  We shall take one very central\nconcept, h\u0323ads, most often translated \u201cintuition\u201d, and\nfollow it through Ibn Kammuna\u2019s major works. (It will become clear\nthat in this context, intuition is a sui generis state, which, on the\nepistemological scale, falls between the discursive reasoning of very\nbright individuals and the gift of prophecy.) This will allow us to\nget a handle on a key feature of his philosophical thinking, as well\nas to observe the different ways the same concept is treated within\nthe different projects that Ibn Kammuna undertook. Note that we shall\nbe alert to the utilization of the concept, even if the\nterm h\u0323ads does not appear in the text under scrutiny.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, h\u0323ads is the revelation\u2014some would add\ninstantaneously\u2014of the middle term of the syllogism, leading to\nan infallible conclusion. In practice, though, it had much wider\napplication and less precise definition. Rare indeed is the case,\nwhen h\u0323ads is cited as the source of knowledge, that the\nwriter will display the full syllogism and specify the middle term\n(see Langermann 2005, 286\u2013302, and Gutas 2001). In effect, it is of\nthe same species as the \u201crevelations\u201d by which Avicenna\nlearned of his own existence (and indeed the great bulk of his\neducation) and, like that Avicennan moment, it shifted epistemology in\nthe direction of a reliance upon a person\u2019s sense of security in his\npersonal illuminations . In the work of later thinkers, including Ibn\nKammuna, the evaluation of h\u0323ads served to legitimize alchemy and\nastrology and, more generally, to blur the distinction between\ndemonstrative knowledge and revelation.\n\nH\u0323ads was not just one more function to be added to the basket\nof terminologies used to explain psychological processes. Two\napplications in particular must be singled out. First of all,\nh\u0323ads offered an analogy to prophecy; no other phenomenon from\nthe world of humans, extraordinary as it may be, seemed as close to\nprophetic revelation. Second, it offered a way to account for great\nscientific acumen. Prophecy, scientific discovery, and intuition in\ngeneral all lead those who experience them to certain knowledge\nin a moment of\nrevelation, in general, knowledge that had not been available before.\n",
