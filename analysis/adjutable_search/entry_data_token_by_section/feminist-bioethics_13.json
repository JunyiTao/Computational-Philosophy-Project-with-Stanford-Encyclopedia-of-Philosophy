    "main_text": "Feminist Contributions to Thematic Areas || Reproduction, reproductive medicine, and assisted reproductive technologies\n5.1 Reproduction, reproductive medicine, and assisted reproductive technologies\n\nMany people assume that bioethics is feminist when it addresses\n\u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d, such as pregnancy or menopause.\nThe roots of this misperception can be traced both to the\ndiscipline\u2019s origins in women\u2019s health activism, and the\nfact that many feminists were drawn into the field by their interest\nin the burgeoning technologies of assisted reproduction in the 1990s\nand 2000s. Reproductive issues are seen as \u201cfeminist\u201d\nsimply because both biologically and socially they tend to affect\nwomen more than men. And in practice, the first decades of feminist\nbioethics were dominated by writing on contraception and abortion, and\nthe medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth. There was a particular\nfocus on how societies in general and healthcare in particular should\nrespond to the industrialized growth of assisted reproductive\ntechnologies (ARTs) (in vitro fertilization, surrogate pregnancy, egg\nand embryo donation, artificial insemination by donor). This has been\nextended to more recent techniques such as mitochondrial transfer,\ntechniques of selective reproduction (prenatal testing, diagnosis, and\nscreening; preimplantation genetic diagnosis; preconception testing;\nand genome editing), and the ability to generate, test, and manipulate\nembryos ex vivo (e.g., Wolf 1996; Gupta 2000; Rapp 2000; Shanley 2001;\nKukla 2005; Mullin 2005; Harwood 2007; McLeod 2009; Baylis 2013;\nBaylis & McLeod 2014).\n\nThis work on reproduction is identifiably feminist not simply because\nit addresses issues that are of greater salience to women, but because\nit reflects the characteristic features of feminist bioethical\napproaches discussed earlier. It starts from the experiential\nperspective of women, and it consciously examines the systemic and\ninterpersonal power differentials that determine how these\ntechnologies were developed, delivered, and experienced. A feminist\nframework enables a different kind of ethical evaluation of\nthe practices of reproductive medicine and ARTs than mainstream\nbioethics can provide. A key insight is that because women bear a\ndisproportionate share of the associated risks and burdens, new\nreproductive technologies are not gender neutral, a fact frequently\nignored in debates about the ethics of assisted reproduction. Thus,\nfeminist work highlights the potential that research into and use of\nthese technologies holds for issues such as the exploitation of\nwomen\u2019s bodies and body tissues (Turkmendag 2022), the unequal\ndistribution of the physical and psychological burdens of fertility\ntreatments between women and men, the impact of ARTs on women\u2019s\ncareer plans, and many others (Dickenson 2013; Ballantyne 2014).\n\nSome feminist ethicists have also attempted to place reproductive\nethics in the wider context of both social expectations of maternity\nand parenthood, and the accepted norms of the human body. There are\nconcerns that the fertility industry has a vested interest in\nreinforcing a set of social expectations that women will do (and pay)\nanything to have children and will turn to whatever technology is on\noffer if they have difficulty conceiving due to a medical condition or\nsimply because of their age (Warren 1988; Parks 1999). Similarly, the\navailability of testing and screening technologies, and potentially of\ngenomic editing, exerts pressure on women (and men) to produce only\n\u201cperfect\u201d children (Rothman 1986 [1993]; Rapp 2000; Mills\n2015; de Melo-Mart\u00edn 2017). Alongside the health benefits they\nmay offer, these technologies may increase the stigma experienced by\ndisabled children and their families and exacerbate social\ninequalities. Many of these issues overlap with others known to\ndisproportionately affect women, such as the impact of caregiving\nresponsibilities and the effect of particular economic policies on\nsocially marginalized groups, while some feminist bioethicists draw\nparallels between the ways that both the female body and the disabled\nbody are seen as deviations from the (nondisabled, male) norm of human\nembodiment (Scully 2022).\n\nFeminist bioethics has also contributed to the ethical analysis of the\nuse of reproductive tissues for research or to circumvent infertility.\nInsight into the routes through which eggs, embryos, and other\nreproductive material flow into and circulate in contemporary medicine\nand research raises questions about the potential exploitation of\nwomen and women\u2019s bodily tissue. Examples of this include\ngroundbreaking work by Donna Dickenson (2007) on property and\nownership of the body and body parts, and by Catherine Waldby, Robert\nMitchell and Melinda Cooper on the global economy of reproductive\ntissues (Waldby & Mitchell 2006; Cooper & Waldby 2014). One of\nthe key issues raised by these discussions is how to recognize when\nwomen (and others) are being exploited as producers of bodily material\nfor research in the increasingly common situations where the research\ntakes place in the context of medical treatment, such as for\ninfertility.\n",
