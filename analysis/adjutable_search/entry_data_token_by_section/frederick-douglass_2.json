    "main_text": "On Liberty\n3. On Liberty\n\nInstead of surrendering to despair, he joined the abolition movement\nafter escaping slavery. And for that grand purpose, natural law and\nrights were ideas he believed in and used to significant effect. Thus,\nin his writings, his writings he repeatedly makes clear and direct\nreferences to concepts that flow from liberalism: liberty; moral and\nsocial equality; individuality; property rights, self-defense, and\nspeech; the moral and instrumental value of labor; democracy; and\ncomposite (what we would call multiethnic or multiracial) nationality.\nThis is why he is rightly associated with liberalism (Myers 2008;\nBuccola 2012). The relation between Douglass\u2019s works and those\nideas is apparent; however, three merit highlighting because they are\nnot typically emphasized in the theoretical literature about Douglass:\nfree speech, property, and composite nationality.\n\nDouglass\u2019s life after abolition speaks to the importance of the\nfreedoms of speech, thought, and opinion and the great value he placed\non them. From his efforts to learn how to read and write to his desire\nto start his own newspaper, his attitude and actions aggressively\nasserted the indivisible links between equal liberty and the right to\nthink and speak one\u2019s mind. Like the name of his first\nnewspaper, this value was his North Star. So, on 9 December\n1860, in response to the violent disruption of a meeting he was\nparticipating in, Douglass directly addressed the matter in his\nspeech, \u201dA Plea for Freedom of Speech in Boston\u201c, wherein\nhe delivered a classic liberal defense of it that still resonates:\n\n\nThere can be no right where any man however, lifted up or humble,\nhowever young or however old, is overawed by force, and compelled to\nsuppress his honest sentiments. (1860c [FDP1 v.3: 423])\n\n\nThe silencing of speech squashes thought, opinion, and discussion, and\ndoing so, as Douglass pointed out\u2014consistent with other\nphilosophers on liberty\u2014commits a \u201ddouble wrong. It\nviolates the right of the hearer as well as those of the speaker\n (Ibid.).[14]\n\nOn property, Douglass argues, as expected, against human bondage.\nThat, however, was not the only thing he had to say about it. The\npositive right to property, the right of black Americans to their\nbodies, the labor of their bodies, and the wealth generated from their\nproductivity are ideas that feature prominently throughout the\nnarratives. Douglass wrote movingly about the productivity of his\nlabor, the exploitation of it by his enslavers and those in their\nemploy, the theft of his rightfully earned wages, and the anger of\nsome white laborers who resented having to work and compete with free\nblack workers. The right to self-ownership, labor, and property were\nnot just mere things denied to him\u2014they were expressions,\nproducts, and symbols of his liberty and liberty in general. In the\nNarrative, for example, on the theft of his wages by Hugh\nAuld, his master\u2019s brother, Douglass wrote,\n\n\nI was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.\nI contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully\nmy own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to\ndeliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because\nhe earned it,\u2014not because he had any hand in earning\nit,\u2014not because I owed it to him, nor because he possessed the\nslightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had the power\nto compel me to give it up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon\nthe high seas is exactly the same. (FDAB: 84)\n\n\nFrom the Civil War through Reconstruction and its betrayal, Douglass\ncontinued to see the right to property as a necessary part of genuine\nemancipation. He wrote and frequently spoke about the ennobling,\nmoral, and economic power of labor, private property, and individual\nproductivity in articles before emancipation like, \u201cWhat Shall\nbe Done with the Slave if Emancipated\u201d from 1862 (FDSW:\n470\u2013473) to speeches like \u201cSelf-Made Men\u201d from 1893\n(SFD: 414\u2013453).\n\nOn composite nationality, or what we would call multiethnic democracy,\nDouglass\u2019s \u201cOur Composite Nationality\u201d from 1869a\n(SFD: 278\u2013303) is a ringing endorsement of a robust vision of\ncivic belonging and national identification. It is an outlook that\nreflects his support for organic processes of assimilation and\namalgamation and social reform. More on that below\n (\u00a7\u00a76\u20138\n and\n \u00a712).\n\nJust as he drew on liberal ideas, he repeatedly invoked ideas of\nAmerican civic republicanism and advocated for democratic reform,\naction, and, eventually, universal suffrage\n (\u00a711).\n This democratic advocacy has led some philosophers to view Douglass\nas a civic republican as much as he was a liberal (Gooding-Williams\n2009). The evidence for that connection naturally arises from the wide\nvariety of his democratic associational activity. It is modeled in his\nnarratives, particularly in My Bondage and My Freedom, in its\ndepictions of social organization, action, solidarity, friendship, and\naffection among black men and women (FDAB: 305\u2013306).\n\nWhether we understand Douglass as a liberal or civic republican (or\neven as a type of black nationalist or black radical liberal), the\nvalues and ideas he drew on were the foundation of his fierce\ndenunciations of and active resistance to American slavery and his\ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n",
