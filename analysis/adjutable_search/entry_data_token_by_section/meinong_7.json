    "main_text": "Object Theory \u2014 Ontology beyond Being and Non-Being || The Principle of Independence and the Principle of Indifference\n5.1 The Principle of Independence and the Principle of Indifference\n\nWhatever can be experienced in some way, i.e., be the target of a\nmental act, Meinong calls an object [Gegenstand or\nObjekt]. The term \u201cobject\u201d is a \u201crelation\nterm\u201d in the sense that \u201cyou shall not speak of an object\nwithout considering a mental activity\u201d (1888\u20131903: 47).\nMeinong does not see an ontological but only a conceptual dependence\nexpressed by the term \u201cobject\u201d, and he does not determine\nan object intentionally as something that is grasped but only as\nsomething that can be grasped by mental acts (it can\nbe represented, judged etc.). He is neither a constructivist nor a\nsubjective idealist as he admits that the mental acts are not already\nto be thought of as something that create objects. He (1904b, \u00a74;\n1921a: 110) also acknowledges the following connection between\n\u201c(every) thing\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d: Everything is an\nobject, but everything is logically prior to its apprehending and\npre-given [vorgegeben] to the mind. Referring to\nMeinong\u2019s theory of knowledge lectures in the winter term\n1903/4, Ernst Mally (1904, Chapt. I, \u00a73, 126), even states\n\u201cEverything that is something is called an object\u201d\n[\u201cAlles, was etwas ist, hei\u00dft ein\nGegenstand\u201d]).\n\nNot only existing things but also all kinds of non-beings\n(nonentities, Routley 1980: 7) find their place in Meinong\u2019s\nall-embracing theory of objects \u2014 among them even impossible\nobjects, like the round square, as well as paradoxical,\n\u201cdefective\u201d objects, like some forms of the liar\nor special cases of purely self-referential thinking (the thought\nabout itself, for\n example).[2]\n Similar to Twardowski (see above 4.1), Meinong maintains that talking\nabout non-beings is not just speaking of nothing, i.e. there can be no\nobjectless representations and thoughts. He clears up the apparently\nparadoxical sentence \u201cThere are objects of which it is true that\nthere are no such objects\u201d (1904b, \u00a73) by introducing two\nmeanings of \u201cthere are\u201d: first as outside-being\n(pre-giveness), second as being, and he tries to give a\nrational account of the paradoxical sentence by referring to two\nclosely related principles: (1) the \u201cprinciple of the\nindependence of so-being from being\u201d [\u201cPrinzip der\nUnabh\u00e4ngigkeit des Soseins vom Sein\u201d], and (2) the\n\u201cprinciple of the indifference of the pure object to\nbeing\u201d (\u201cprinciple of the outside-being of the pure\nobject\u201d [\u201cSatz vom Au\u00dfersein des reinen\nGegenstandes\u201d]) (1904b, \u00a73\u20134).\n\nAd 1: The independence principle, first formulated by Ernst\nMally in the year 1903 and a little later in his 1904 (Chapt. I,\n\u00a73), states that \u201cthe so-being of an object is not affected\nby its non-being\u201d (Meinong 1904b: 8 [82]), that is to\nsay, an object\u2019s having properties is independent of whether it\nhas being or not. Meinong\u2019s comments on this principle show that\nit combines several claims; in particular, (i) the\ncharacterization principle, which postulates that any object\nhas those properties that it is characterized as having (e.g.,\n\u201cThe AB is A and B,\nrespectively\u201d), and (ii) the denial of the ontological\nassumption, which denies that there are no true propositions\nabout what does not have being (cf. Routley 1980).\n\nAd 2: The indifference principle says: \u201cThe object is\nby nature indifferent to being, although in any case one of the\nobject\u2019s two objectives of being, its being or its non-being,\nsubsists\u201d (1904b: 13 [86]). This formulation is\nsupposed to be less misleading than the claim that \u201cthe pure\nobject stands \u2018beyond being and non-being\u2019\u2009\u201d\n[\u201cder reine Gegenstand stehe \u2018jenseits von Sein und\nNichtsein\u2019\u201d]. The latter catchphrase means\nthat neither being nor non-being belongs to the make-up of an\nobject\u2019s nature (its so-being [Sosein]), but it should\nnot be taken to mean that an object is beyond being and non-being in\nthe sense that it neither has being nor does not have being \u2014\nthe second clause of the indifference principle makes this clear.\nAlthough the non-being of an object may be guaranteed by the\nobject\u2019s nature \u2014 as in the case of the round square, for\nexample \u2014, the non-being does not belong to its nature. In other\nwords: Being (or non-being) is not part of an object\u2019s nature,\nbut nevertheless \u201cthe law of excluded middle lays it down that\nevery object necessarily stands in a fact of being or in a fact of\nnon-being\u201d (Findlay 1963: 49). It is worth noticing that there\nare two interpretations of negation (narrower, internal, predicate, or\nontological negation versus wider, external, sentence,\nlogical negation), and accordingly there are two versions of the law\nof excluded middle. Meinong seems to accept the law of excluded middle\nonly with respect to sentence negation.\n",
