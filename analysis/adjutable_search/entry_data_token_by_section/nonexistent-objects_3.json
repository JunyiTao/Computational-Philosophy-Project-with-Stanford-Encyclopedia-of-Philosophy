    "main_text": "Further Motivations for Belief in Nonexistent Objects || The Problem of Negative Singular Existence Statements\n3.1 The Problem of Negative Singular Existence Statements\n\nVery briefly, the problem can be stated as follows: it seems that in\norder to deny the existence of a given individual, one must assume the\nexistence of that very individual. Thus, it seems that it is\nimpossible to deny the existence of an individual without getting\ninvolved in a contradiction.\n\nHowever, this conclusion seems hard to accept. In fact, there are many\nnegative existence statements that we take not only to be sensible but\nalso to be true (or at least not to be necessarily false). Consider,\nfor instance:\n\nPegasus does not exist.\nYugoslavia does not exist anymore.\nThe perpetual motion machine does not exist and never will exist.\n\n\nFrom the common sense point of view, negative singular existence\nstatements are ubiquitous, comprehensible and sometimes true. So why\nis it that many philosophers are so puzzled about them? In particular,\nwhy think one has to assume the existence of an individual in order to\ndeny its existence?\n\nOne traditional reason that has been given is based on the following\nassumptions:\n\nOnly meaningful sentences can be true.\nIn a meaningful sentence, every constituent of the sentence must\nbe meaningful.\nIf a singular term is meaningful, then it denotes something.\nIf a singular term \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something,\nthen \u201c\\(b\\) does not exist\u201d is false.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how these assumptions lead to a problem in light of\nthe negative singular existence sentence \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d. If \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true, then it\nmust be meaningful (by (1) above). If it is meaningful, all of its\nconstituents must be meaningful, including the singular term\n\u201cPegasus\u201d (by (2) above). If \u201cPegasus\u201d is\nmeaningful, then \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something (by (3)\nabove). If \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something, then\n\u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is false (by (4) above). Thus,\nthe assumption that \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true leads\nto the conclusion that this same sentence is false. So if the above\npremises are correct, it is impossible that \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d is true: either \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something,\nin which case \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is false; or\n\u201cPegasus\u201d does not denote anything, in which case\n\u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is not even meaningful, let alone\ntrue.\n\nThere are several ways to resolve this problem, i.e., to account for\nmeaningful and true negative singular existence sentences. One\nsolution that became very prominent in the 20th century consists in\nthe strategy of \u201canalyzing away\u201d the proper names and\ndefinite descriptions appearing in negative singular existential\nclaims. This strategy consists of two steps:\n\nOrdinary proper names are interpreted as disguised definite\ndescriptions. For instance, \u201cPegasus\u201d is to be analyzed as\nshort for \u201cthe flying horse from Greek mythology\u201d. This is\noften called the description theory of proper names. Thus to\nsay \u201cPegasus exists\u201d is simply to say \u201cthe flying\nhorse of Greek mythology exists\u201d.\nDefinite descriptions are to be analyzed along the lines of\nBertrand Russell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions. On\nRussell\u2019s theory, to say \u201cthe flying horse of Greek\nmythology exists\u201d is to say \u201cthere is exactly one\n\\(x\\) which is a flying horse of Greek mythology\u201d.\n\n\nThus, combining these two steps, it follows that:\n\nTo say \u201cPegasus doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is to say\n\u201cit is not the case that there is exactly one \\(x\\) which\nis a flying horse of Greek\n mythology\u201d.[5]\n\n\nIf \u201cVulcan\u201d is short for \u201cthe planet between Mercury\nand the sun\u201d, then:\n\nTo say \u201cVulcan doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is to say\n\u201cit is not the case that there is exactly one \\(x\\) which\nis such that \\(x\\) is a planet between Mercury and the\nsun\u201d.\n\n\nThe point of these paraphrases is to show that the original sentences\ncan be analyzed in terms of sentences in which the singular terms\n(\u201cPegasus\u201d, \u201cVulcan\u201d, \u201cthe flying horse\nof Greek mythology\u201d and \u201cthe planet between Mercury and\nthe sun\u201d) have all disappeared. The paraphrases involve the\ngeneral terms \u201cflying horse from Greek mythology\u201d and\n\u201cplanet between Mercury and the sun\u201d, along with the\nexistential quantifier (\u201cthere is\u201d) and a uniqueness\ncondition (\u201cexactly one\u201d). (Let\u2019s ignore the fact\nthat the singular terms \u201cMercury\u201d and \u201cLe\nVerrier\u201d appear within the general terms; of course, this means\nthat the procedure isn\u2019t complete, but, in principle, it can be\ncompleted.) The problem of negative singular existentials is thereby\nresolved because sentences containing names which appear to be about\nnonexistent objects are paraphrased in terms of sentences involving\ngeneral terms, quantifiers and uniqueness conditions. These latter\nsentences are meaningful independently of whether the general terms\napply to anything.\n\nHowever, both the description theory of proper names and\nRussell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions have been subject to\nserious criticisms. One might object that they fail to do full justice\nto our actual use of proper names and definite descriptions. Often we\nuse proper names\u2014successfully\u2014without having any definite\ndescription in mind. Sometimes we don\u2019t need a definite\ndescription in order to refer to a particular object, because we\nindividuate the respective object by means of perception or perceptual\nmemories. Sometimes we simply do not know of a definite description\nthat individuates the object we wish to refer to. Most of us know\nabout Cicero just that he was a famous Roman orator; but the Romans\nhad more than one famous orator. Nevertheless, we can use the name\n\u201cCicero\u201d successfully to refer to a particular\nfamous Roman orator. Moreover, even when we do have something like the\nmental correlate of a definite description in mind when we use a\nproper name, we do not usually treat the description as a\ndefinition of the proper name (as the Russellian picture\nsuggests). Suppose what I have in mind when I use the name\n\u201cSocrates\u201d corresponds to the description \u201cthe\nancient Greek philosopher who died from drinking hemlock\u201d.\nSuppose furthermore that the famous story about Socrates\u2019 death\nis actually a myth and that Socrates in fact died peacefully of old\nage. Do I then simply fail to refer to Socrates whenever I use the\nname \u201cSocrates\u201d? It does not seem so. When I eventually\ncome to know that Socrates did not die from drinking hemlock, I will\ntake this as a piece of information about Socrates, the\nperson I referred to all the time by using the name\n\u201cSocrates\u201d. (See Kripke 1980.)\n\nAs to the theory of definite descriptions, two kinds of problem arise.\nFirst, some philosophers simply deny that the paraphrases properly\ncapture the meaning of sentences with definite descriptions, simply on\nthe grounds that the meaning of a proper name like\n\u201cPegasus\u201d is just less specific than the meaning of the\ndefinite description \u201cthe flying horse of Greek\nmythology\u201d. Second, some philosophers have objected that the\ntheory of definite descriptions sometimes yields the wrong results.\nConsider, for instance: \u201cThe ancient Greeks worshipped\nZeus.\u201d Prima facie, this sentence expresses a real\nrelation between the ancient Greeks and Zeus; and it is surely a\nhistorical fact that the ancient Greeks worshipped Zeus. Yet on\nRussell\u2019s analysis, proper names like \u201cZeus\u201d have to\nbe replaced by definite descriptions, even in contexts other than\nexistence claims. So \u201cZeus\u201d would get replaced by a\ndefinite description like \u201cthe Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who \u2026\u201d. Thus, the above true sentence would\nget analyzed in terms of the following false one:\n\u201cThere exists one and only one Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who \u2026 and who was such that the ancient Greeks\nworshipped him.\u201d There are numerous other true sentences like\nthis, such as \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous than any real\ndetective\u201d, etc., all of which appear to involve real relations\nbetween existent objects and nonexistent ones, but whose Russellian\nparaphrases are false. Third, the use of the anaphoric pronoun\n\u201cit\u201d in \u201cTeams of scientists have searched for the\nLoch Ness monster, but since it doesn\u2019t exist, no one will ever\nfind it\u201d seems problematic. The pronoun in both of its\noccurrences in this sentence seems to pick up its meaning/denotation\nfrom the definite description \u201cthe Loch Ness\nmonster\u201d\u2014which is not easy to explain given\nRussell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions.\n\nThere might be ways to defend the theory of definite descriptions, but\nthey will not be pursued here. In the context of this article, the\nrelevant point is that Russell\u2019s theory does not provide a\ngenerally accepted solution to the problem of negative existence\nsentences. The appeal to nonexistent objects, on the other hand,\nprovides a very simple solution to this problem. It consists in\nrejecting the premise\n\nIf a singular term \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something,\nthen \u201c\\(b\\) does not exist\u201d is false.\n\n\nIf there are nonexistent objects, then \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d may\ndenote an object that does not exist.\n\nThe idea here is that whereas the quantifiers \u201cthere is\u201d\nand \u201csomething\u201d range over everything whatsoever, the\nobjects that exist constitute only a portion of that domain.\nTherefore, it would be fallacious to derive from\n\u201c\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 denotes something\u201d that\n\u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something that exists.\nAccording to this picture, \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d simply\nexpresses that Pegasus is a nonexistent object. Premises 1\u20133\nfrom above can be accepted without restriction. \u201cPegasus\u201d\ndenotes a nonexistent flying horse and thus is meaningful. Thus, the\nwhole sentence \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is meaningful as\nwell. Since it is true that Pegasus does not belong to the class of\nexistent objects, \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true. Of\ncourse, this solution can be generalized to all negative singular\nexistence statements. The appeal to nonexistent objects thus supplies\nan elegant solution to the problem of negative singular\nexistentials.\n\nNaturally, there are alternative solutions to the problem of negative\nsingular existence statements. Among other things, it is possible to\nreject premise 4 without committing oneself to an ontology of\nnonexistent objects. One might simply accept a positive Free Logic,\ni.e., the conjunction of the following two principles: 1. Singular\nterms do not need to denote anything in order to be meaningful. 2.\nSentences containing non-denoting singular terms can be true. (This\nstrategy is to be found, for instance, in Crane 2013.) One of the\ndifficulties of this solution, however, is to give an account of what\nmakes such sentences true, i.e., of what their truthhmakers are (given\nthe principle that, for every true sentence, there is something in the\nworld that makes it true, i.e., something that is the sentence\u2019s\ntruthmaker). For the special case of negative singular existence\nsentences, one might claim that that their truthmaker is just the\nentire world (see, e.g., Crane 2013, Section 3.5; for more about\nCrane\u2019s position see Section 5.1 below). However, this answer to\nthe truthmaker question is not available for the problem of fictional\ndiscourse, which provides another important motivation for a\ncommitment to nonexistent objects.\n",
