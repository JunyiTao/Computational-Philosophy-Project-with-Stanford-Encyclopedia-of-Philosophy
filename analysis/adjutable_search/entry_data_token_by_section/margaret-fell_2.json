    "main_text": "Quaker thought and practice || Doctrine of the light\n2.1 Doctrine of the light\n\n\nThis emphasis on the inward rather than the outward person lies at\nthe heart of Fell\u2019s egalitarian views about spiritual authority.\nAccording to Quaker philosophy, the spirit of Christ is \u201cin the\ninward parts\u201d, it is \u201cthe Law of God written in the\nheart\u201d or the \u201cCandle of the Lord in you\u201d (Fell 1710,\n35, 49). The light of Christ is divinely or supernaturally implanted in every individual\u2019s conscience;\nit is not a natural human capacity, such as reason or rational judgment\n(cf. Apetrei 2009, 134). By participating in this light, human beings\npartake in \u201ca living, pure, eternal, immortal Principle\u201d\n(Fell 1710, 92). Through the inner light, they come to learn God\u2019s\nwill and law\u2014the light \u201cmakes the will of God\nmanifest\u201d (Fell 1710, 50). They learn moral truths, such as\n\u201cto doe to all men as ye would they should doe to you\u201d, and\nthat \u201cthou shalt not steal\u201d and \u201cthou shalt not\nkill\u201d (Fell 1656a, 2, 24). The light enables human beings to\nrecognize sin and to make considered moral judgments in matters of\njustice and equity. And the light reproaches the individual for\nstraying from the righteous path: it \u201cwill reprove, this teacheth\nin secret, and is alwayes present, when you are upon your Beds\u201d\n(Fell 1656c, 7).\n\n\nBut while the light is undoubtedly divine or supernatural in nature,\naccording to Fell, it is still up to the individual to direct her mind\nto the light in order to attain redemption. Above all, personal\nsalvation depends upon the mind discerning the light within and then\ndiligently keeping to it. The individual must engage in constant mental\neffort, she must \u201cconsider seriously\u201d and \u201ccome to\nsearch and examine\u201d her beliefs for herself (Fell 1656b, 1,\n14).\n\n\nFell reiterates these points in several tracts addressed to the Jews\nof Europe, including For Manasseth Ben Israel (1656), A\nLoving Salutation (c. 1656\u201357) and A Call unto the Seed\nof Israel (1668). In the 1650s, Oliver Cromwell contemplated\nreadmitting the Jews to England for the first time since their\nexpulsion in the thirteenth century. In her writings, Fell welcomes\nthe return of the Jews, but only on the condition that they convert to\nChristianity. As a millenarian thinker, she believes that the\nconversion of the Jews signals the fulfilment of biblical prophecies\nforetelling \u201cthe last days\u201d and the second coming of\nChrist (cf. Gardiner 1994; Guibbory 2000). Fell thus appeals to the\nJews to turn from their \u201coutward worship\u201d and to\nacknowledge the divine light within them. In Manasseth Ben\nIsrael, Fell calls on them to \u201ctherefore cease from your\nabomination, and turne to the living God\u201d (Fell 1656c,\n4). \u201cIf ever you come to know the true and living God,\u201d\nshe says, \u201cyou must hearken to this Prophet which calls your\nminds to within, for by this doth the living God teach his People\nhimselfe\u201d (5). In A Loving Salutation, Fell likewise\nurges the Jews to \u201chearken diligently\u201d (Fell 1656a, 3):\n\u201cIncline your eare, and come unto me, hear, and your souls shall\nlive\u201d (3), and \u201cthine eyes shall see thy teacher, and thy\neares shall heare a voice behind thee\u201d (6). With such exhortations, Fell emphasizes\nthat living in the light requires certain activity on part of the\nmoral agent, and not just the mere passive reception of the power and\nspirit of God. While everyone has the divine light within their\nconscience, they can only know the truths that the light\nreveals\u2014and attain salvation\u2014by actively hearkening to the\nlight: \u201cif ye desire this inheritance,\u201d she says to the\nJews, \u201cturn your minds into the light\u201d (8).\n\n\nIn these and other writings, Fell promotes a certain critical\nattitude toward customary ways of practising and thinking about\nreligion. The path to God, she says, \u201cleads out of the world, out\nof the worlds ways, fashions, and customs, and this makes a separation\nfrom the world\u201d (Fell 1710, 65). The individual must learn to\nrely on her own independent faculty of moral judgement or her\nconscience. Both Jews and Gentiles are urged to \u201clet\nthat in your Consciences (which is of God) which respects no Person,\nRead and Examine those Scriptures\u201d (Fell 1710, 65).\n\n\nIn the 1650s, Fell arranged to have Manasseth Ben Israel\nand A Loving Salutation translated into Hebrew, in a bid to\nreach a Jewish audience. There is some evidence that Baruch Spinoza\nwas the anonymous translator of A Loving Salutation (cf. Fell\n1987), and that he may have adapted some of Fell\u2019s arguments in\nhis Theological-Political Treatise (cf. Clausen-Brown\n2019).\n",
