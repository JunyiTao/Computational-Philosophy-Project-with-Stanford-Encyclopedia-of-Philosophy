    "main_text": "Metaphysical Sentimentalism\n4. Metaphysical Sentimentalism\n\nIt is an appealing thought that moral (and other evaluative) facts and\nproperties are not just brutely out there independently of human\nthought and sensibility. Take the evaluative property of being funny.\nHow could something be funny, if no human being was ever amused by it?\nHow could something be outrageous if it failed to generate any outrage\nwhen known about, even in those who care about the victim? For\nsentimentalists, value, including moral value, is\nanthropocentric (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2006).\n\nSentimentalists agree with error theorists that sui generis,\nnon-natural moral facts would be queer, and that mind-independent\nnatural facts are unfit for the role of moral facts. Non-cognitivist\njudgment sentimentalists treat moral facts as projections of\nmoral attitudes. Although there is excellent reason to think Hume\nwasn\u2019t a projectivist, he gave one of the classic formulations\nin saying that taste\n\n\nhas a productive faculty, and gilding and staining all natural\nobjects, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises in a manner a new\ncreation. (1751: 88)\n\n\nWe take a sentimental response in ourselves, say envy, and attribute\nto the worldly object a feature it doesn\u2019t really have, such as\nbeing enviable.\n\nError theorists treat this projection as much the same as the\nattribution of agency to planets in some cultures: a predictable false\nbelief. Contemporary expressivists, in contrast, believe that\nattribution of moral facts and properties serves a purpose. It enables\nus to express our commitments in a way that provides a focal point for\ndisagreement and debate. As discussed above, on deflationary views of\ntruth and facts, it is a first-order question whether some attribution\nis in error or not (Blackburn 1998).\n\nMost interestingly for moral metaphysics, many cognitivist judgment\nsentimentalists think that moral judgments refer to moral and\nevaluative facts that are metaphysically determined by some sort of\nsentimental responses. According to such views, moral properties are\nresponse-dependent in one way or another. For more, see the\n Response-Dependence Supplement.\n",
