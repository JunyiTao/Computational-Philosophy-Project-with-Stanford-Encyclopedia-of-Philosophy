    "main_text": "Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms || Verificationism and the Critique of Metaphysics\n3.1 Verificationism and the Critique of Metaphysics\n\nNot surprisingly, it was the Circle\u2019s rejection of metaphysics\nby means of their seemingly devastating criterion of cognitive\nsignificance that attracted immediate opposition. (That they did not\ndeny all meaning to statements thus ruled out of court was freely\nadmitted from early on, but this \u201cexpressive\u201d surplus was\nconsidered secondary to so-called \u201ccognitive\u201d meaning and\ndiscountable in science (see Carnap 1928b, 1932a).) Notwithstanding\nthe metaphysicans\u2019 thunder, however, the most telling criticisms\nof the criterion came from within the Circle or broadly sympathetic\nphilosophers. When it was protested that failure to meet an empiricist\ncriterion of significance did not make philosophical statements\nmeaningless, members of the Circle simply asked for an account of what\nthis non-empirical and presumably non-emotive meaning consisted in and\ntypically received no convincing answer. The weakness of their\nposition was rather that their own criterion of empirical significance\nseemed to resist an acceptable formal characterization.\n\nTo start with, it must be noted that long before the verification\nprinciple proper entered the Circle\u2019s discourse in the late 1920s,\nthe thought expressed by Mach\u2019s dictum that \u201cwhere neither\nconfirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not\nconcerned\u201d (1883 [1960, 587]) was accepted as a basic precept of\ncritical reflection about science. Responsiveness to evidence for and\nagainst a claim was the hallmark of scientific discourse.\n(Particularly the group Frank-Hahn-Neurath, who formed part of a\npre-World War I discussion group (Frank 1941, 1949a) sometimes called\nthe \u201cFirst Vienna Circle\u201d (Haller 1985, Uebel 2003), can\nbe presumed to be familiar with Mach\u2019s criterion.) Beyond this,\nstill in the 1920s, Schlick (1926) convicted metaphysics for falsely\ntrying to express as logically structured cognition what is but the\ninexpressible qualitative content of experience. Already then,\nhowever, Carnap (1928b, \u00a77) edged towards a formal criterion by\nrequiring empirically significant statements to be such that\nexperiential support for them or for their negation is at least\nconceivable. Meaningfulness meant the possession of \u201cfactual\ncontent\u201d which could not, on pain of rendering many scientific\nhypotheses meaningless, be reduced to actual testability. Instead, the\nempirical significance of a statement had to be conceived of as\npossession of the potential to receive direct or indirect experiential\nsupport (via deductive or inductive reasoning).\n\nIn 1930, considerations of this sort appeared to receive a\nconsiderable boost due to Waismann\u2019s reports of\nWittgenstein\u2019s meetings with him and Schlick. Wittgenstein had\ndiscussed the thesis \u201cThe sense of a proposition is [the method of] its\nverification\u201d in conversations with Schlick and Waismann on 22\nDecember 1929 and 2 January 1930 (see Waismann 1967 [1979, 47 and 79]) and Waismann elaborated it in his \u201cTheses\u201d which were presented to the Circle as\nWittgenstein\u2019s considered views. While Wittgenstein appears to have\nthought of his dictum primarily as a constitutive principle of meaning, in the Circle it was put to work mainly as a demarcation criterion against metaphysics. Whether it was always noted that Wittgenstein\u2019s thesis and the criterion of cognitive significance must be distinguished (the former entails the latter, but not vice versa) may be doubted, but striking differences emerged all the same. Like Carnap\u2019s criterion of significance of 1928, the version of the criterion which followed from Wittgenstein\u2019s dictum also allowed for\nverifiability in principle (and did not demand actual\nverifiability): like Carnap\u2019s notion of experiential support, it worked with the mere conceivability of verifiability. Yet Wittgenstein\u2019s criterion required conclusive verifiability which Carnap\u2019s did not. (The demand for conclusive verifiability was discussed in the meetings\nwith Wittgenstein.) By 1931, however, it had become clear to some that\nthis would not do. What Carnap later called the \u201cliberalization\nof empiricism\u201d was underway and different camps became\ndiscernible within the Circle. It was over this issue that the\nso-called \u201cleft wing\u201d with Carnap, Hahn, Frank and Neurath\nfirst distinguished itself from the \u201cmore conservative\nwing\u201d around Schlick. (See Carnap 1936\u201337, 422 and 1963a,\n\u00a79. Carnap 1936\u201337, 37n dated the opposition to strict\nverificationism to \u201cabout 1931\u201d.)\n\nIn the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of\nuniversally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to\nsalient aspects of Carnap\u2019s 1928 conception. Everybody had noted\nthat Wittgenstein\u2019s criterion rendered\nuniversally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus\nfollowed Wittgenstein\u2019s own suggestion to treat \u201chypotheses\u201d instead as\nrepresenting rules for the formation of verifiable singular\nstatements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated\nonly in Schlick 1936a.) By contrast, Hahn (1933, drawn from lectures\nin 1932) pointed out that hypotheses should be counted as properly\nmeaningful as well and that the criterion be weakened to allow for\nless than conclusive verifiability. But other elements played into\nthis liberalization as well. One that began to do so soon was the\nrecognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms\nto observation terms (more on this presently). A third element was\nthat disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability\nor support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was\nnomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth\nelement, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the\ncriterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it\nwas to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick\nretained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages\nthroughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological\npossibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned\nwith natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements\nmeaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a\nprocedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only,\nCarnap (1936\u201337) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it\nwas nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation\nof disconfirmation.\n\nMany of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in\n1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous\ncriterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that\nwere syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were\nreducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence\nstatements of science. While Carnap\u2019s focus on the reduction of\ndescriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some\nstatements, it must be noted that his criterion also allowed\nuniversally quantified statements to be meaningful in general, provided they were\nsyntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, \u00a72). It was\nnot until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially\ndeclared the criterion of cognitive significance to be mere confirmability.\nCarnap\u2019s new criterion required neither verification nor\nfalsification but only partial testability so as now to include not\nonly universal statements but also the disposition statements of\nscience (see Carnap 1936\u201337; the English translation of the\noriginal Paris address (1936a [1949]) combines it with extraneous\nmaterial). These disposition terms were thought to be linked to\nobservation statements by a variety of reduction postulates or longer\nreduction chains, all of which provided only partial definitions\n(despite their name they provided no eliminative reductions). Though\nplausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms\nin this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the\nsupposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters\nand analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951, 1963).\nIndependently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all\ntheoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base\nby such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for\nthe formulation of a criterion of cognitive significance: how was one to rule out\nunwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly\nabstract scientific claims?\n\nConsider that Carnap (1939, 1956b) admitted as legitimate theoretical\nterms that are implicitly defined in calculi that are\nonly partially interpreted by correspondence rules between\nsome select calculus terms and expressions belonging to an\nobservational language (via non-eliminative reductions). The problem\nwas that mere confirmability was simply too weak a criterion\nto rule out some putative metaphysical claims. Moreover, this problem\narose for both the statement-based approach to the criterion (taken by\nCarnap in 1928, by Wittgenstein in 1929/30, and by Ayer both in the\nfirst (1936) and the second editions (1946) of Language Truth and\nLogic) and for the term-based approach (taken by Carnap since\n1932). For the former approach, the problem was that the empirical\nlegitimacy of statements obtained via indirect testing also\ntransferred to any expressions that could be truth-functionally\nconjoined to them (for instance, by the rule of\n\u2018or\u2019-introduction). Statements thus became empirically\nsignificant, however vacuous they had been on their own. For the\nterm-based approach, the problem was that, given the non-eliminability\nof dispositional and theoretical terms, empirical significance was no\nlonger ascribable to individual expressions in isolation but became a\nholistic affair, with little guarantee in turn for the empiricist\nlegitimacy of all the terms now involved.\n\nFor most critics (even within the ranks of logical empiricism), the\nproblem of ruling out metaphysical statements while retaining the\nterms of high theory remained unsolved. By 1950, in response to the\ntroubles of Ayer\u2019s two attempts to account for the indirect\ntesting of theoretical statements via their consequences, Hempel\nconceded that it was \u201cuseless to continue to search for an\nadequate criterion of testability in terms of deductive relationships\nto observation sentences\u201d (1950 [1959, 116]). The following\nyear, Hempel also abandoned the idea of using, as a criterion of\nempirical significance, Carnap\u2019s method of translatability into\nan antecedently determined empirical language consisting only of\nobservational non-logical vocabulary. Precisely because it was\nsuitably liberalized to allow abstract scientific theories with merely\npartial interpretations, its anti-metaphysical edge was blunted: it\nallowed for combination with \u201csome set of metaphysical\npropositions, even if the latter have no empirical interpretation at\nall\u201d (1951, 70). Hempel drew the holistic conclusion that the\nunits of empirical significance were entire theories and that the\nmeasure of empirical significance itself was multi-criterial and,\nmoreover, allowed for degrees of significance. To many, this amounted\nto the demise of the Circle\u2019s anti-metaphysical campaign. By\ncontrast, Feigl\u2019s reaction (1956) was to reduce the ambition of\nthe criterion of significance to the mere provision of necessary\nconditions.\n\nSome further work was undertaken on rescuing and, again, debunking a\nversion of the statement-based criterion, but mostly not by (former) members\nof the Vienna Circle. However, in response to the problem of how to\nformulate a meaning criterion that suitably distinguished between\nempirically significant and insignificant non-observational terms,\nCarnap proposed a new solution in 1956. We\nwill return to discuss it separately (see section 3.5 below); for\nnow we need only note that these proposals were highly technical and\napplied only to axiomatized theories in formal languages. They too,\nhowever, found not much favor amongst philosophers. Yet whatever the\nproblems that may or may not beset them, it would seem that far more\ngeneral philosophical considerations contributed to the disappearance\nof the problem of the criterion of cognitive significance from most philosophical\ndiscussions since the early 1960s (other than as an example of\nmistaken positivism). These include the increasing opposition to the\ndistinctions between analytic and synthetic statements and\nobservational and theoretical terms as well as a general sense of\ndissatisfaction with Carnap\u2019s approach to philosophy which began\nto seem both too formalist in execution and too deflationary in\nambition. The entire philosophical program of which the search for a\nprecise criterion of empirical significance was a part had begun to\nfall out of favor (and with it technical discussions about the\ncriterion\u2019s latest version).\n\nThe widely perceived collapse of the classical Viennese project to\nfind in an empiricist meaning criterion a demarcation criterion\nagainst metaphysics\u2014we reserve judgement about Carnap\u2019s\nlast two proposals here\u2014can be interpreted in a variety of ways.\nIt strongly suggests that cognitive significance cannot be reduced to\nwhat is directly observable, whether that be interpreted in\nphenomenalist or intersubjective, physicalist terms. In that important\nbut somewhat subsidiary sense, the collapse spelt the failure of many\nof the reductivist projects typically ascribed to Viennese\nneopositivism (but see section 3.3 below). Beyond that, what actually\nhad failed was the attempt to characterize for natural languages the\nclass of cognitively significant propositions by recursive definitions\nin purely logical terms, either by relations of deducibility or\ntranslatability. What failed, in other words, was the attempt to apply\na general conception of philosophical analysis as purely formal,\npursued also in other areas, to the problem of characterizing\nmeaningfulness.\n\nThis general conception can be considered formalist in several senses.\nIt was formalist, first, in demanding the analysis of the meaning of\nconcepts and propositions in terms of logically necessary and\nsufficient conditions: it was precise and brooked no exceptions. And\nit was formalist, second, in demanding that such analyses be given\nsolely in terms of the logical relations of these concepts and\npropositions to other concepts and propositions: it used the tools of\nformal logic. There is also a third sense that is, however, applicable\npredominantly to the philosophical project in Carnap\u2019s hands, in\nthat it was formalist since it concentrated on the analysis of\ncontested concepts via their explication in formal languages.\n(Discussion of its viability must be deferred until sections 3.5 and\n3.6 below, since what\u2019s at issue currently is only the formalist\nproject as applied to concepts in natural language.) The question\narises whether all Vienna Circle philosophers concerned with empirical\nsignificance in natural language were equally affected, for the\ncollapse of the formalist project may leave as yet untouched other\nways of sustaining the objection that metaphysics is, in some relevant\nsense, cognitively insignificant. (Such philosophers in turn would\nhave to answer the charge, of course, that only the formalist project\nof showing metaphysics strictly meaningless rendered the Viennese\nanti-metaphysics distinctive.)\n\nEven though the formalist project became identified with mainstream\nlogical empiricism generally (consider its prominence in confirmation\ntheory and in the theory of explanation), it was not universally\nsubscribed to in the Vienna Circle itself. In different ways, neither\nSchlick nor Neurath or Frank adhered to it. As noted in the overview\nabove, Schlick\u2019s attempts to exhibit natural language meaning\nabjured efforts to characterize it in explicitly formal terms, even\nthough he accepted the demand for necessary and sufficient conditions\nof significance. In the end, moreover, Schlick turned away from his\ncolleagues\u2019 search for a criterion of empirical significance. In\nallowing talk of life after death as meaningful (1936a), for the very\nreason that what speaks against it is only the empirical impossibility\nof verifying such talk, Schlick\u2019s final criterion clearly left\nempiricist strictures behind.\n\nBy contrast, Neurath and Frank kept their focus on empirical\nsignificance. While they rarely discussed these matters explicitly,\ntheir writings give the impression that Neurath and Frank chose to\nadopt (if not retain) a contextual, exemplar-based approach to\ncharacterizing the criterion of meaninglessness and so decided to\nforego the enumeration of necessary and sufficient conditions.\nMach\u2019s precept cited earlier is an example of such a pragmatic\napproach, as is, it should be noted, Peirce\u2019s criterion of\nsignificance, endorsed by Quine (1969), which claims that significance\nconsists in making a discernible difference whether a proposition is\nlikely to be true or false. Mach\u2019s pragmatic approach had been\nchampioned already before verificationism proper by Neurath, Frank and\nHahn who became, like Carnap, early opponents of conclusive\nverifiability. (Indeed, it is doubtful whether Neurath\u2019s radical\nfallibilism, most clearly expressed already in 1913, ever wavered.)\nThis pragmatic understanding found clear expression in Neurath\u2019s\nadoption (1935a, 1938) of K. Reach\u2019s formulation of metaphysical\nstatements as \u201cisolated\u201d ones, as statements that do not\nderive from and hold no consequences for those statements that we do\naccept on the basis of empirical evidence or for logical reasons.\n(Hempel\u2019s dismissal, in 1951, of this pragmatic indicator\npresupposes the desiderata of the formalist project.) Finally, there\nis Frank\u2019s suggestion (1963), coupled with his longstanding\nadvice to combine logical empiricism with pragmatism, that\nCarnap\u2019s purely logical critique of metaphysics in (1932a) was\nbound to remain ineffective as long as the actual use of metaphysics\nremained unexamined. It would be worth investigating whether\u2014if\nthe critique of the alleged reductionist ambitions of their philosophy\ncould also be deflected (see section 3.3 below)\u2014the impetus of\nthe anti-verificationist critique can be absorbed by those with a\npragmatic approach to the demarcation against metaphysics. Much as\nwith Quine\u2019s Peirce, such a criterion rules out as without\ninterest for epistemic activity all concepts and propositions whose\ntruth or falsity make no appreciable difference to the sets of\nconcepts and propositions we do accept already.\n\nAn entirely different moral was drawn by Reichenbach (1938) and\nthinkers indebted to his probabilistic conception of meaning and his\nprobabilistic version of verificationism, which escaped the criticisms\nsurveyed above by vagaries of its own. Such theorists perceive the\nfailure of the formalist model to accommodate the empirical\nsignificance of theoretical terms to stem from its so-called deductive\nchauvinism. In place of the exclusive reliance on the\nhypothetical-deductive method these theorists employ non-demonstrative\nanalogical and causal inductive reasoning to ground theoretical\nstatements empirically. Like Salmon, these theorists adopt a form of\n\u201cnon-linguistic empiricism\u201d which they sharply\ndifferentiate from the empiricism of the Vienna Circle (Salmon 1985,\n2003 and Parrini 1998).\n\nNow against both the pragmatic and the post-linguistic responses to\nthe perceived failure of the attempt to provide a precise formal\ncriterion of significance serious worries can be raised. Thus it must\nbe asked whether without a precise way of determining when a statement\n\u2018makes an appreciable difference\u2019, criticism of\nmetaphysics based on such a criterion may be not be considered as a\nbiased dismissal rather than a demonstration of fact and so fall short\nof what is needed. Likewise in the case of the anti-deductivist\nresponse, it must be noted that a criterion based on analogical\nreasoning will only be as effective as the strength of the analogy\nwhich can always be criticized as inapt (and similarly for appeals to\ncausal reasoning). The very point of exact philosophy in a scientific\nspirit\u2014for many the very point of Vienna Circle philosophy\nitself\u2014seems threatened by such maneuvres. Acquiescence in the\nperceived failure of the proposed criteria of significance thus comes\nwith a price: if not that of abandoning Vienna Circle philosophy\naltogether, then at least that of formulating an alternative\nunderstanding to how some of its ambitions ought to be understood.\n(Recent reconstructive work on Carnap, Neurath and Frank may be\nregarded in this light.)\n\nA still different response\u2014but one emblematic for the\nphilosophical public at large\u2014is that of another of\nReichenbach\u2019s former students, Putnam, who came to reject\nthe anti-metaphysical project that powered verificationism in its\nentirety. Repeatedly in his later years, Putnam called for a\nrefashioning of analytic philosophy as such, providing, as it were, a\nphilosophically conservative counterweight to Rorty\u2019s turn to\npostmodernism. Putnam\u2019s reasons (the alleged self-refutation of\nthe meaning criterion) are still different from those surveyed above\nand will be discussed when we return to reconsider the very point of\nthe Circle\u2019s campaign against metaphysics (see section 3.6\nbelow).\n",
