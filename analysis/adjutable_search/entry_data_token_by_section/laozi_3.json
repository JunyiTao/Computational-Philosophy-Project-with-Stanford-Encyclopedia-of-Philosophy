    "main_text": "Commentaries\n4. Commentaries\n\n\nCommentaries to the Laozi offer an invaluable guide to\ninterpretation and are important also for their own contributions to\nChinese philosophy and religion.\n\n\nTwo chapters in the current Hanfeizi (chs. 21 and 22) are\nentitled \u201cExplaining (the Sayings of) Laozi\u201d\n(Jie Lao) and \u201cIllustrating (the Sayings\nof) Laozi\u201d (Yu Lao), which can be regarded as\nthe earliest extant commentary to the classic (for a detailed study\nand translation, see Sarah A. Queen 2013). The\n\u201cbibliographical\u201d section of the Hanshu (History\nof the Former or Western Han Dynasty) lists four commentaries to\nthe Laozi, but they have not\nsurvived. Nevertheless, Laozi learning began to flourish from\nthe Han period. The commentaries by Heshanggong, Yan Zun, Wang Bi, and\nthe Xiang\u2019er commentary will be introduced in what\nfollows. Some mention will also be made of later developments in the\nhistory of the Daodejing. The late Isabelle Robinet has\ncontributed an important pioneering study of the early Laozi\ncommentaries (1977; see also Robinet 1998).\n\n\nTraditionally, the Heshanggong commentary is regarded as a product of\nthe early Han dynasty. The name Heshanggong means an old man who\ndwells by the side of a river, and some have identified the river in\nquestion to be the Yellow River. An expert on the Laozi, he\ncaught the attention of Emperor Wen, who went personally to consult\nhim. Heshanggong revealed to the emperor his true identity as a divine\nemissary sent by the \u201cSupreme Lord of the Dao\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe divine Laozi\u2014to teach him. The emperor proved a humble\nstudent, as the legend concludes, worthy of receiving\nthe Daodejing with Heshanggong\u2019s commentary (A. Chan\n1991).\n\n\nRecent Chinese studies generally place the commentary at the end of\nthe Han period, although some Japanese scholars would date it to as\nlate as the sixth century C.E. It is probably a second-century\nC.E. work and reflects the influence of the \u201cHuang-Lao\u201d\n(Yellow Emperor and Laozi) tradition, which flourished during the\nearly Han dynasty (A. Chan 1991a). Called in early sources\nthe Laozi zhangju, it belongs to the genre\nof zhangju literature, prevalent in Han times, which one may\nparaphrase as commentary by \u201cchapter and sentence.\u201d Its\nlanguage is simple; its imagination, down-to-earth. The Heshanggong\ncommentary shares with other Han works the cosmological belief that\nthe universe is constituted by qi, the energy-like building\nblocks of life and the vital constituent of the cosmos, variously\ntranslated as \u201cvital energy,\u201d \u201clife-force,\u201d or\n\u201cpneuma.\u201d On this basis, interpreting the text in terms of\nyin-yang theory, the Laozi is seen to disclose not only the\nmystery of the origins of the universe but also the secret to personal\nwell-being and sociopolitical order.\n\n\nWhat the Laozi calls the \u201cOne,\u201d according to\nHeshanggong, refers to the purest and most potent form\nof qi-energy that brings forth and continues to nourish all\nbeings. This is the meaning of de, the \u201cvirtue\u201d\nor power with which the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nall beings\u2014have been endowed and without which life would\ncease.\n\n\nThe maintenance of \u201cvirtue,\u201d which the commentary also\ndescribes as \u201cguarding the One,\u201d is thus crucial to\nself-cultivation. A careful diet, exercise, and some form of\nmeditation are implied, but generally the commentary focuses on the\ndiminishing of selfish desires. The government of the\n\u201csage\u201d\u2014a term common to all schools of Chinese\nthought but which is given a distinctive Daoist meaning in the\ncommentary\u2014rests on the same premise. Policies that are harmful\nto the people such as heavy taxation and severe punishment are to be\navoided, but the most fundamental point remains that the ruler himself\nmust cherish what the Laozi calls \u201cemptiness\u201d and\n\u201cnonaction.\u201d Disorder stems from the dominance of desire,\nwhich reflects the unruly presence of confused and\nagitated qi-energy. In this way, self-cultivation and\ngovernment are shown to form an integral whole.\n\n\nA second major commentary is the Laozi zhigui (The Essential\nMeaning of the Laozi) attributed to the Han dynasty scholar\nYan Zun (fl. 83 B.C.E.\u201310 C.E.). Styled Junping, Yan\u2019s surname\nwas originally Zhuang; it was changed in later written records to the\nsemantically similar Yan to comply with the legal restriction not to\nuse the name Zhuang, which was the personal name of Emperor Ming\n(r. 57\u201375) of the Later or Eastern Han dynasty. Yan Zun is well\nremembered in traditional sources as a recluse of great learning and\nintegrity, a diviner of legendary ability, and an author of\nexceptional talent. The famous Han poet and philosopher Yang Xiong (53\nB.C.E.\u201318 C.E.) studied under Yan and spoke glowingly of\nhim.\n\n\nThe Laozi zhigui (abbreviated hereafter as Zhigui),\nas it now stands, is incomplete; only the commentary to\nthe Dejing, chapters 38\u201381 of the\ncurrent Laozi, remains. The best edition of\nthe Zhigui is that contained in the Daozang (Daoist\nCanon, no. 693 in the Daozang zimu yinde, Harvard-Yenching\nSinological Index Series, no. 25), which clearly indicates that the\nwork had originally thirteen juan or books, the first six of\nwhich have been lost. Judging from the available evidence, it can be\naccepted as a Han product (A. Chan 1998a). The Laozi text\nthat accompanies Yan Zun\u2019s commentary agrees in many instances with\nthe wording of the Mawangdui manuscripts.\n\n\nLike Heshanggong, Yan Zun also subscribes to the yin-yang cosmological\ntheory characteristic of Han thought. Unlike Heshanggong\u2019s commentary,\nhowever, the Zhigui does not prescribe a program of\nnourishing one\u2019s qi endowment or actively cultivating\n\u201clong life.\u201d This does not mean that it rejects the ideal\nof longevity. On the contrary, it recognizes that the Dao \u201clives\nforever and does not die\u201d (8.9b), and that the man of Dao,\ncorrespondingly, \u201cenjoys long life\u201d (7.2a). Valuing one\u2019s\nspirit and vital energy is important, but the Zhigui is\nconcerned that self-cultivation must not violate the principle of\n\u201cnonaction.\u201d Any effort contrary to what\nthe Laozi has termed \u201cnaturalness\u201d\n(ziran) is counter-productive and doomed to failure.\n\n\nThe concept of ziran occupies a pivotal position in Yan Zun\u2019s\ncommentary. It describes the nature of the Dao and its manifestation\nin the world. It also points to an ethical ideal. The way in which\nnatural phenomena operate reflects the workings of the Dao. The\n\u201csage\u201d follows the Dao in that he, too, abides by\nnaturalness. In practice this means attending to one\u2019s\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d (xin) so that it will not be\nenslaved by desire. Significantly, the Zhigui suggests that\njust as the sage \u201cresponds\u201d to the Dao in being simple and\nempty of desire, the common people would in turn respond to the sage\nand entrust the empire to him. In this way, the Laozi is seen\nto offer a comprehensive guide to order and harmony at all levels.\n\n\nAn early commentary that maximizes the religious import of\nthe Laozi is the Xiang\u2019er Commentary. Although it is\nmentioned in catalogues of Daoist works, there was no real knowledge\nof it until a copy was discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts\n(S. 6825 in the Stein collection). The manuscript copy, now housed in\nthe British Library, was probably made around 500 C.E. The original\ntext, disagreement among scholars notwithstanding, is generally traced\nto around 200 C.E. It is closely linked to the \u201cWay of the\nCelestial Masters\u201d and has been ascribed to Zhang Daoling, the\nfounder of the sect, or his grandson Zhang Lu, who was instrumental in\nensuring the group\u2019s survival after the collapse of the Han dynasty. A\ndetailed study and translation of the work in English is now available\n(Bokenkamp 1997).\n\n\nThe Xiang\u2019er manuscript is unfortunately incomplete; only the\nfirst part has survived, beginning with the middle of chapter 3 and\nending with chapter 37 in the current chapter division of\nthe Laozi. It is not clear what the title, Xiang\u2019er,\nmeans. Following Rao Zongyi and \u014cfuchi Ninji, Stephen Bokenkamp\nsuggests that it is best understood in the literal sense that the Dao\n\u201cthinks (xiang) of you (er)\u201d (1997,\n61). This underscores the central thesis of the commentary, that\ndevotion to the Dao in terms of self-cultivation and compliance with\nits precepts would assure boundless blessing in this life and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe Xiang\u2019er commentary accepts without question the divine\nstatus of Laozi. While Yan Zun and Heshanggong direct their commentary\nprimarily to those in a position to effect political change,\nthe Xiang\u2019er invites a larger audience to participate in the\nquest for the Dao, to achieve union with the Dao through spiritual and\nmoral discipline. It is possible to attain the \u201clife-span of an\nundefiled, godlike being\u201d (xianshou). Nourishing one\u2019s\nvital qi-energy through meditation and other practices\nremains the key to attaining \u201clong life\u201d and ultimately to\nforming a spiritual body devoid of the blemishes of mundane existence\n(Rao 1991; see also Puett 2004).\n\n\nSpiritual discipline, however, is insufficient; equally important is\nthe accumulation of moral merit. Later Daoist sources refer to the\n\u201cnine precepts\u201d of the Xiang\u2019er. There is also a\nlonger set known as the \u201ctwenty-seven precepts\u201d of\nthe Xiang\u2019er. These include general positive steps such as\nbeing tranquil and yielding, as well as specific injunctions against\nenvy, killing, and other morally reprehensible acts. Likening the\nhuman body to the walls of a pond, the essential qi-energy to\nthe water in it, and good deeds the source of the water,\nthe Xiang\u2019er commentary makes clear that deficiency in any\none would lead to disastrous consequences (see Bokenkamp 1993).\n\n\nCompared with the Xiang\u2019er, Wang Bi\u2019s Laozi\ncommentary could not be more different. There is no reference to\n\u201cimmortals\u201d; no deified Laozi. The Daodejing, as\nWang Bi sees it, is fundamentally not concerned with the art of\n\u201clong life\u201d but offers profound insight into the radical\notherness of Dao as the source of being, and the practical\nimplications that follow from it.\n\n\nStyled Fusi, Wang Bi (226\u2013249) was one of the acknowledged\nleaders of the movement of \u201cLearning in the Profound\u201d\n(xuanxue) that came into prominence during the Wei period\n(220\u2013265) and dominated the Chinese intellectual scene well into\nthe sixth century. The word xuan denotes literally a shade of\ndark red and is used in the Laozi (esp. ch. 1) to suggest the\nmystery or profundity of Dao. The movement has been termed, perhaps\nnot without ambiguity, \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in Western studies. It\nsignifies a broad philosophical front united in its attempt to discern\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d meaning of Dao but not a homogeneous or\npartisan school. Alarmed by what they saw as the decline of Dao,\ninfluential intellectuals of the day initiated a sweeping\nreinterpretation of the classical heritage. They did not neglect the\nConfucian classics but drew inspiration especially from\nthe Yijing, the Laozi, and the Zhuangzi,\nwhich were then referred to as the \u201cThree (Classics on the)\nProfound\u201d (sanxuan); that is to say, the three key\ntreatises unlocking the mystery of Dao. Wang Bi, despite his short\nlife, distinguished himself as a brilliant interpreter of\nthe Laozi and the Yijing (see A. Chan 1991a, Wagner\n2000, Lynn 2015, and \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in\nthis Encyclopedia).\n\n\nAccording to Wang Bi, Dao is indeed the \u201cbeginning\u201d of the\n\u201cten thousand things.\u201d Unlike Heshanggong or\nthe Xiang\u2019er, however, he did not pursue a cosmological or\nreligious interpretation of the process of creation. Rather, Wang\nseems more concerned with what may be called the logic of\ncreation.\n\n\nDao constitutes the absolute \u201cbeginning\u201d in that all\nbeings have causes and conditions that derive logically from a\nnecessary foundation. The ground of being, however, cannot be itself a\nbeing; otherwise, infinite regress would render the logic of\nthe Laozi suspect. For this reason, the Laozi would\nonly speak of Dao as \u201cnonbeing\u201d (wu). We will\ncome back to this point later.\n\n\nThe transcendence of Dao must not be compromised. To do justice to\nthe Laozi, it is also important to show how the function of\nDao translates into basic \u201cprinciples\u201d (li)\ngoverning the universe. The regularity of the seasons, the plenitude\nof nature, and other expressions of \u201cheaven and earth\u201d all\nattest to the presence of Dao. Human beings also conform to these\nprinciples, and so are \u201cmodeled\u201d ultimately after Dao.\n\n\nWang Bi is often praised in later sources for having given the concept\nof li, \u201cprinciple,\u201d its first extended\nphilosophical treatment. In the realm of Dao, principles are\ncharacterized by \u201cnaturalness\u201d (ziran) and\n\u201cnonaction\u201d (wuwei). Wang Bi\ndefines ziran as \u201can expression of the ultimate.\u201d\nIn this regard, attention has been drawn to Yan Zun\u2019s\ninfluence. Nonaction helps explain the practical meaning of\nnaturalness. In ethical terms, Wang Bi takes nonaction to mean freedom\nfrom the dictates of desire. This defines not only the goal of\nself-cultivation but also that of government. The concepts of\nnaturalness and nonaction will be discussed further below. Wang\nBi\u2019s Laozi commentary has exerted a strong influence on\nmodern interpretations of the Laozi in both Asia and the\nWest. There are four English translations available (Lin 1977, Rump\n1979, Lynn 1999, and Wagner 2003).\n\n\nAmong these four commentaries, Heshanggong\u2019s Laozi zhangju\noccupied the position of preeminence in traditional China, at least\nuntil the Song dynasty. For a long period, Wang Bi\u2019s work was\nrelatively neglected. The authority of the Heshanggong commentary can\nbe traced to its place in the Daoist religion, where it ranks second\nonly to the Daodejing itself. Besides Heshanggong\u2019s work and\nthe Xiang\u2019er, there are two other commentaries, the Laozi\njiejie (Sectional Explanation) and the Laozi neijie\n(Inner Explanation), that are closely associated with religious\nDaoism. Both have been ascribed to Yin Xi, the keeper of the pass who\n\u201cpersuaded\u201d Laozi to write the Daodejing and who,\naccording to Daoist hagiographic records, later studied under the\ndivine Laozi and became an \u201cimmortal.\u201d These texts,\nhowever, only survive in citations (see Kusuyama 1979).\n\n\nFrom the Tang period, one begins to find serious attempts to collect\nand classify the growing number of Laozi commentaries. An\nearly pioneer is the eighth-century Daoist master Zhang Junxiang, who\ncited some thirty commentaries in his study of the Daodejing\n(Wang 1981). Du Guangting (850\u2013933) provided a larger\ncollection, involving some sixty commentaries (Daode zhenjing\nguangshengyi, Daozang no. 725). According to Du, there\nwere those who saw the Laozi as a political text, while\nothers focused on spiritual self-cultivation. There were Buddhist\ninterpreters (e.g., Kum\u0101raj\u012bva and Sengzhao), and there were\nthose who explained the \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d\n(chongxuan). This latter represents an important development\nin the history of interpretation of the Daodejing (Assandri\n2009).\n\n\nThe term \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d comes from chapter 1 of\nthe Laozi, where Dao is said to be the mystery of all\nmysteries, in the sense of an incomparably profound reality beyond\nordinary comprehension (xuan zhi you xuan). As a school of\nDaoist learning, \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d seizes this to be the\nkey to understanding the Laozi. Daoist sources relate that\nthe school goes back to the fourth-century master Sun Deng. Through Gu\nHuan (fifth century) and others, the school reached its height during\nthe Tang period, represented by such thinkers as Cheng Xuanying and Li\nRong in the seventh century. The school reflects the growing\ninteraction between Daoist and Buddhist thought, particularly\nM\u0101dhyamika philosophy. Unlike Wang Bi, it sees\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d as equally one-sided as \u201cbeing\u201d\nwhen applied to the transcendence of Dao. Nonbeing may highlight the\nprofundity or mystery of Dao, but it does not yet reach the highest\ntruth, which according to Cheng Xuanying can be called the \u201cDao\nof Middle Oneness\u201d (Kohn 1992, 144; Assandri 2009, chs. 4 and\n6). Like other polar opposites, the distinction between being and\nnonbeing must also be \u201cforgotten\u201d before one can achieve\nunion with Dao.\n\n\nThe Laozi has been viewed in still other ways. For example, a\nTang commentary by Wang Zhen, the Daodejing lunbing yaoyishu\n(Daozang no. 713), presented to Emperor Xianzong\n(r. 806\u2013820) in 809, sees the text as a treatise on military\nstrategy (Rand 1979\u201380; see also Wang Ming 1984 and Mukai\n1994). The diversity of interpretation is truly remarkable (see\nRobinet 1998 for a typological analysis). The Daodejing was\ngiven considerable imperial attention, with no fewer than eight\nemperors having composed or at least commissioned a commentary on the\nwork. These include Emperor Wu and Emperor Jianwen of the Liang\ndynasty, Xuanzong of the Tang, Huizong of the Song, and Taizu of the\nMing dynasty (see Liu Cunren 1969 for a discussion of the last\nthree).\n\n\nBy the thirteenth century, students of the Daodejing were\nalready blessed, as it were, with an embarrassment of riches, so much\nso that Du Daojian (1237\u20131318) could not but observe that the\ncoming of the Dao to the world takes on a different form each\ntime. That is to say, different commentators were shaped by the spirit\nof their age in their approach to the classic, so that it would be\nappropriate to speak of a \u201cHan Laozi,\u201d\n\u201cTang Laozi,\u201d or\n\u201cSong Laozi,\u201d each with its own agenda\n(Xuanjing yuanzhi fahui, Daozang no. 703).\n",
