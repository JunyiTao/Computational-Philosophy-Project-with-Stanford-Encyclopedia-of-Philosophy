    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || The Principle of No Privilege\n2.2 The Principle of No Privilege\n\nAn analogous history-fed pessimistic argument can be based on the\nso-called \u201cprinciple of no privilege\u201d, which was advanced\nby Mary Hesse in her 1976. According to this principle:\n\n\nour own scientific theories are held to be as much subject to radical\nconceptual change as past theories are seen to be. (1976: 266)\n\n\nThis principle can be used for the derivation of the strong conclusion\nthat all theories are false. As Hesse put it:\n\n\nEvery scientific system implies a conceptual classification of the\nworld into an ontology of fundamental entities and properties\u2014it\nis an attempt to answer the question \u201cWhat is the world really\nmade of?\u201d But it is exactly these ontologies that are most\nsubject to radical change throughout the history of science. Therefore\nin the spirit of the principle of no privilege, it seems that we must\nsay either that all these ontologies are true, ie: we must give a\nrealistic interpretation of all of them or we must say they are all\nfalse. But they cannot all be true in the same world, because they\ncontain conflicting answers to the question \u201cWhat is the world\nmade of?\u201d Therefore they must all be false. (1976: 266)\n\n\nThis argument engages the history of theory-change in science in a\nsubstantial way. As Hesse admitted, the Principle of No Privilege\narises \u201cfrom accepting the induction from the history of\nscience\u201d (1976: 271). Hesse\u2019s argument starts with the\nhistorical premise that, as science grows over time, there has been a\nrecognizable pattern of change in the \u2018ontology of fundamental\nentities and properties\u2019 posited by scientific theories.\nAssuming, then, the Principle of No Privilege, it is argued that\ncurrent theories too will be subjected to a radical change in the\nontology of the entities and properties they posit. Hence, current\ntheories are as false as the past ones.\n\nThe problem with this kind of argument is that the historical premise\nshould be borne out by the actual history of theory-change in science.\nIt\u2019s not enough to say that scientific theories change over\ntime; these changes should be such that the newer theories are\nincompatible with the past ones. Or, to use Hesse\u2019s idiom, it\nshould be shown that past and current scientific\n\u2018ontologies\u2019 are incompatible with each other. Showing\nincompatibility between the claims made by current theory T\nand a past theory T\u2032 requires a theory of reference of\ntheoretical terms which does not allow that terms featuring\nin different theories can nonetheless refer to the same entity in the\nworld. Hence, it is question-begging to adopt a theory of reference\nwhich makes it inevitable that there is radical-reference variance in\ntheory-change.\n\nReferential stability, as noted already, makes possible the claim that\npast and present ontologies are compatible, even if there have been\nchanges in what current theories say of the posited entities. The\n\u201crevolutionary induction from the history of science about\ntheory change\u201d (Hesse 1976: 268) can be blocked by pointing to a\npattern of substantial continuity in theory change.\n",
