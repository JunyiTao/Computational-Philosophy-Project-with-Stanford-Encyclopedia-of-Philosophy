    "main_text": "Justice: Acting for the Sake of the Cosmopolis\n3. Justice: Acting for the Sake of the Cosmopolis\n\n\nMarcus says that one should be concerned with two things only: acting\njustly and loving what is allotted one (x.11, cf. xii.1). He fleshes\nout \u2018acting justly\u2019 in terms of acting communally (ix.31),\nand adds that wherever one lives, one should live as a citizen of the\ncosmic city (x.15). Appeal to the idea that the cosmos is a city\nallows him to say that we should do well for all humanity (viii.23),\nfor we each have a citizen\u2019s duty to contribute to the welfare of the\nwhole cosmopolis, i.e., to the welfare of all humans as our fellow-citizens.  Conversely, anyone who does not contribute to the\ncommunal goal (to koin\u00f4nikon telos) is acting\nseditiously (ix.23); one may not hate even one man, for this rends the\ncommunity (xi.8).\n\n\nStrikingly, Marcus seems to specify this communal goal in terms of\nindifferents rather than virtue, with the result that one should aim\nto bring about preferred indifferents for the whole of which one is a\npart. When he explains that that whatever happens to a part benefits\nthe whole, and that what is advantageous (to sumpheron) to\none person does not conflict with what is advantageous to another,\nMarcus writes that by \u2018interest\u2019 he means intermediate\nthings (t\u00f4n mes\u00f4n) (vi.45; perhaps he\ntakes this to follow from the coincidence of what is in accordance\nwith nature for the whole and the part). Even though food is not a\ngood and hunger not an evil, a Stoic will respond to a hungry person\nwith food, rather than (only) a lecture that food is not a good and\nhunger not an evil. \n\nOf course, one\u2019s efforts to give food to the hungry, or to benefit the\nhungry by giving them food, may fail, so Marcus recommends pursuing\nsuch ends with reservation (hupexairesis), making one\u2019s impulses\nconditional on what is fated to happen (iv.1, v.20, vi.50).\n\nPresumably this response is grounded in our natural concern\n(oikei\u00f4sis), which at its most fundamental is responsible\nfor parents\u2019 caring for their children (Diogenes Laertius\nvii.85), and Marcus tells himself to regard other human beings as most\nhis own (oikeiotaton) when thinking how to benefit them and\nhow not to obstruct their plans (v.20).\n\n\nMarcus says that the rational nature does well when it directs\nimpulses (hormai) to communal action (viii.7). We must do\nwhat follows from our constitution, and the communal faculty (to\nkoin\u00f4nikon) plays the leading part in the human\nconstitution (vii.55). After the communal faculty comes the rational\nfaculty (vii.55), but again, the rational faculty is perfected in\njustice (ix.22). As a human being, one is able to contribute to the perfectionn\n(sumpl\u00ear\u00f4tikos) of the whole political organization;\nMarcus urges himself to make his every action perfective of political\nlife (ix.23). Sometimes Marcus goes so far as to identify the good\n(agathon) of a rational creature with community (v.16).\n\n\nFinally, Marcus simply denies that there is ever any conflict between\nthe good of the individual and the good of the whole community of\nwhich that individual is a part. He says, on the one side, that the\nperfection, well-being, and stability of the whole depends on what\nhappens to each part (v.8).  And on the other side, he says that what\nthe nature of the whole brings about is good (agathon) for\neach part (ii.3), and that what is not hurtful to the city can\u2019t be\nhurtful to its citizen (v.22).  He compares the relationship between\nseparate rational individuals and the community to limbs and body,\nwhich are so constituted as to work together (vii.13). The comparison\nbetween the citizen-city relationship and the limb-body relationship\ngoes back to Plato\u2019s Republic (462b\u2013d), according to which in\nthe ideal city, harm to one citizen or part of the city is felt as\nharm to the rest of the citizens or the city as a whole. While Plato\nuses the limb-body analogy to emphasize the unity of feeling the ideal\ncity achieves, Marcus uses it to emphasize that the citizen is a\nfunctional part of the whole city: just as this material making up a limb would not be a\nlimb at all without the body of which it is a part, so too, this human\nindividual would not be what they are without a city of which they are a\npart (Marcus must mean the cosmic city).  One might object that there\nis more to being a human being than being a citizen (Striker 1996,\n259), but perhaps Marcus is not merely saying that the cosmos is like a city\nand we are like its citizens; perhaps he is saying that the cosmos actually is\na city and human beings actually are its citizens, so that what it is to be\nhuman is exhausted by citizenship of the cosmos.\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 claims about the harmony between the welfare or\nadvantage of wholes and parts are also central to his conception of\npiety.\n",
