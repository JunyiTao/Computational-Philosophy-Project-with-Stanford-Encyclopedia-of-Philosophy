    "main_text": "Four Basic Questions || The Interactor Question\n2.1 The Interactor Question\n\nIn its traditional guise, the interactor question is, what units are\nbeing actively selected in a process of natural selection? As such,\nthis question is involved in the oldest forms of the units of\nselection debates (Darwin 1859 [1964], Haldane 1932, Wright 1945). In\nan early review on \u201cunits of selection\u201d, the purpose of\nthe article was claimed as: \u201cto contrast the levels of\nselection, especially as regards their efficiency as causers of\nevolutionary change\u201d (Lewontin 1970: 7). Similarly, others\nassumed that a unit of selection is something that \u201cresponds to\nselective forces as a unit\u2014whether or not this corresponds to a\nspatially localized deme, family, or population\u201d (Slobodkin\n& Rapoport 1974: 184).\n\nQuestions about interactors focus on the description of the selection\nprocess itself, that is, on the interaction between an entity, that\nentity\u2019s traits and environment, and on how this interaction\nproduces evolution; they do not focus on the outcome of this process\n(see Wade 1977; Vrba & Gould 1986). The interaction between some\ninteractor at a certain level and its environment is assumed to be\nmediated by \u201ctraits\u201d that affect the interactor\u2019s\nexpected survival and reproductive success. Here, the interactor is\npossibly at any level of biological organization, including a group, a\nkin-group, an organism, a gamete, a chromosome, or a gene. Some\nportion of the expected fitness of the interactor is directly\ncorrelated with the value of the trait in question. The expected\nfitness of the interactor is commonly expressed in terms of genotypic\nfitness parameters, that is, in terms of the fitness of combinations\nof replicators. Hence, interactor success is most often reflected in\nand counted through, replicator success, either through simple\nsummation of the fitnesses of their traits, or some more complicated\nrelation. Several methods are available for expressing the correlation\nbetween interactor trait and (genotypic or genic) fitness, including\npartial regression, variances, and\n covariances.[2]\n\nIn fact, much of the interactor debate has been played out through the\nconstruction of mathematical genetic models\u2014with the exception\nof work on group selection and on female-biased sex ratios (Wade 1980,\n1985, 2016; D.S. Wilson & Colwell 1981; see especially Griesemer\n& Wade 1988). The point of building such models is to determine\nwhat kinds of selection, operating at which levels, may be effective\nin producing evolutionary change.\n\nIt has been widely held, for instance, that the conditions under which\ngroup selection can effect evolutionary change are quite stringent and\nrare. Typically, group selection was seen to require small group size,\nlow migration rate, and extinction of entire\n demes.[3]\n Some modelers, however, disagree that these stringent conditions are\nnecessary, and show that in the evolution of altruism by group\nselection, very small groups may not be necessary (Matessi &\nJayakar 1976: 384; contra Maynard Smith 1964). Others also\nargue that small effective deme size is not a necessary prerequisite\nto the operation of group selection (Wade & McCauley 1980: 811).\nSimilarly, another shows that strong extinction pressure on demes is\nnot necessary (Boorman 1978: 1909). And finally, there was an early\ngroup selection model that violates all three of the\n\u201cnecessary\u201d conditions usually cited (Uyenoyama 1979; see\nWade 2016).\n\nThat different researchers reach such disparate conclusions about the\nefficacy of group selection is partly because they are using different\nmodels with different parameter values. Several assumptions, routinely\nused in group selection models, were highlighted, that biased the\nresults of these models against the efficacy of group selection (Wade\n1978). For example, many group selection models use a specific\nmechanism of migration; it is assumed that the migrating individuals\nmix completely, forming a \u201cmigrant pool\u201d from which\nmigrants are assigned to populations randomly. All populations are\nassumed to contribute migrants to a common pool from which colonists\nare drawn at random. Under this approach, which is used in all models\nof group selection prior to 1978, small sample size is needed to get a\nlarge genetic variance between populations (Wade 1978: 110; see\ndiscussion in Okasha 2003, 2006).\n\nIf, in contrast, migration occurs by means of large populations,\nhigher heritability of traits and a more representative sampling of\nthe parent population will result. Each propagate is made up of\nindividuals derived from a single population, and there is no mixing\nof colonists from the different populations during propagule\nformation. On the basis of further analysis, much more\nbetween-population genetic variance can be maintained with the\npropagule model (Slatkin and Wade 1978: 3531). Thus, by using\npropagule pools as the assumption about colonization, one can greatly\nexpand the set of parameter values for which group selection can be\neffective (Slatkin and Wade 1978, cf. Craig 1982).\n\nAnother aspect of this debate that has received a great deal of\nconsideration concerns the mathematical tools necessary for\nidentifying when a particular level of biological organization meets\nthe criteria for being an\n interactor.[4]\n Overall, while many of the suggested techniques have had strengths,\nno one approach to this aspect of the interactor question has been\ngenerally accepted and indeed it remains the subject of debate in\nbiological circles (Okasha 2004b,c). Detailed work on two of the major\ntechniques, the Price equation and contextual analysis, has indicated\nthat neither approach is universally applicable, on the grounds that\nneither provides a proper causal decomposition in all varieties of\nselection (Okasha 2006). Specifically, it appears that while\ncontextual analysis may be superior in most cases of multi-level\nselection, the Price equation may be more useful in certain cases of\ngenic selection (Okasha 2006).\n\nIt is important to note that, even in the midst of deciding among the\nvarious methods for representing selection processes, these choices\nhave consequences for the empirical adequacy of the selection models.\nThis is true even if the models are denied to have a causal\ninterpretation, as is done by those promoting a\n\u201cstatisticalist\u201d interpretation of selection theory\n(Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002). On this view, evolution is seen as\na purely statistical phenomenon, and population genetics studies\nstatistical relations estimated by census, and not causal\nrelationships. The claim is that the \u201cdeeply\nuninteresting\u201d units of selection problem has been dissolved,\nwhereas in fact, it has simply been restricted to the interactor\nquestion (while ignoring the other three \u201cunits\u201d questions\nentirely); the problem of how to deliver an empirically adequate\nselection model is not directly addressed (2002: 470\u2013471).\nInstead, an unspecified method is assumed that \u201cidentifies\nclasses [that] \u2026 adequately predict and explain changes in the\nstructure of the population\u201d (Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002:\n471), with no acknowledgment that this involves making a commitment to\none or another of the above methods of determining an interactor,\nwhether under a causal interpretation or not. Thus, the interactor\nproblem has not been escaped, whether or not it is interpreted\ncausally (see Otsuka 2016).\n\nNote that the \u201cinteractor question\u201d does not involve\nattributing adaptations or benefits to the interactors, or indeed, to\nany candidate unit of selection. Interaction at a particular level\ninvolves only the presence of a trait at that level with a special\nrelation to genic or genotypic expected success that is not reducible\nto interactions at a lower level. A claim about interaction indicates\nonly that there is an evolutionarily significant event occurring at\nthe level in question; it says nothing about the existence of\nadaptations at that level. As we shall see, the most common error made\nin interpreting many of the interactor-based approaches is that the\npresence of an interactor at a level is taken to imply that the\ninteractor is also a manifestor of an adaptation at that level.\n",
