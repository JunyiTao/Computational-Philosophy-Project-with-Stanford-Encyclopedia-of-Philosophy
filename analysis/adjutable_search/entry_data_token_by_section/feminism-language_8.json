One sort of criticism was that philosophy of\nlanguage, like English, displays a male bias. Another was simply that\nphilosophy of language is ill-equipped to further feminist aims. Those\nmaking these criticisms did not suggest that philosophy of language be\nabandoned, but rather that it should be reformed\u2014purged of male\nbias and turned into a discipline that can help in the attainment of\nfeminist ends.\n\nWhat reasons were given for supposing that philosophy of language is\nill suited to achieving feminist ends? There were a variety of reasons\n(Hintikka and Hintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000; Nye 1996, 1998), but one\ncommon thread involves the idea that philosophy of language is\nexcessively individualistic. Criticism of individualism in philosophy\nis widespread in many areas of feminism. Exactly what\n\u2018individualism\u2019 comes to varies depending upon the area of\nphilosophy under discussion, and depending also on the concerns of the\nparticular critic. (For more on what feminists mean by\n\u2018individualism\u2019, see Antony 1995.) Because of this, we\nwill not attempt a general definition of \u2018individualism\u2019,\nas used by those raising these concerns. However, we will sketch what\nseems to be at issue in concerns over philosophy of language. Some\nclaim that philosophy of language focuses excessively on the states of\nmind of individual speakers\u2014in particular on their intentions\n(Hornsby 2000). Jennifer Hornsby\u2019s central example of this\ntendency is the work of H. P. Grice, which does indeed analyse speaker\nmeaning in terms of speaker intentions. (Although it is worth noting\nthat that Grice\u2019s analysis of sentence meaning incorporates\nsocial elements, and that both speaker and audience are essential to\nhis notion of conversational implicature. For more on this, see Saul\n2002.) Others suggest that semantics assigns too important a role to\nthe notion of reference to discrete individuals (Hintikka and Hintikka\n1983). Their focus is on Alfred Tarski\u2019s truth definitions\n(Tarski 1956; see also entry on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions)\n and Richard Montague\u2019s work (Thomason 1974).\n\nIndividualism of this sort is said to be problematic for several\nreasons. One common claim is that this sort of individualism is\ncharacteristic of male thinking. Men tend, according to this line of\nthought, to be interested in separate, discrete individuals; while\nwomen are interested in connections and relationships. Thus, it is\nsuggested, an individualistic philosophy of language is one that\nrepresents a male way of thinking about the world. For philosophy of\nlanguage to be true to the experiences and language use of both men\nand women, then, the individualistic philosophy of language which is\ncharacteristic of male thinking will need to be supplemented or\nreplaced by a version more suited to female thinking (Hintikka and\nHintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000). As Haslanger (2000a) and others have\nnoted, however, the claims regarding male and female thinking on which\nthis line of thought depends are not well supported. Moreover,\ndifferences among women give us reason to doubt the prospects for any\nsupportable generalizations about \u2018women\u2019s\u2019 thinking\n(Ang 1995, Lorde 1983, Lugones and Spelman 1983; Moody-Adams 1991).\n\nOther objections to individualism do not depend upon contentious\npsychological claims about differences between women and men. Instead,\nthey suggest that the real problem with individualism is its failure\nto appreciate the importance of the social. The social world is,\nnaturally, an important area of concern when discussing politics and\npower relations. Understanding how people come to dominate one\nanother, and exactly how this domination functions, are important\nprojects for feminists. Language is an important part of the social\nworld, and understanding the roles that language plays in\ncommunicating, manipulating, and controlling (to cite just a few\nexamples) is surely vital to understanding the workings of power (see,\nfor example, MacKinnon\u2019s views on speech in MacKinnon 1993). So,\nmany feminists suggest, a philosophy of language that is appropriate\nto understanding communicative interactions in the social world could\nbe a valuable tool for feminists. However, they insist that the\nindividualism of philosophy of language (as it is now) prevents it\nfrom serving this function (Hornsby 2000).\n\nThe general charge that philosophy of language pays little attention\nto the social world is not one that all feminists would agree with.\nIndeed, it is a difficult one to sustain in light of the prominence\nof\u2014to give a few examples\u2014Saul Kripke\u2019s causal\ntheory of reference (1972; see also Section 2 of the entry on\n reference),\n Hilary Putnam\u2019s arguments for a social element (the division of\nlinguistic labor) in the working of kind terms (1975; see also Section\n3 of the entry on\n reference),\n H.P. Grice\u2019s theory of conversation (1975 [1989]), David\nLewis\u2019s work on convention (1969), and J.L. Austin\u2019s\nspeech act theory (1962 [1975]). Nonetheless, one might well suggest\nthat philosophers of language have generally attended only to aspects\nof the social world that are not of particular interest to feminists.\nWhile causal theories of reference undeniably involve social elements,\nthese social elements don\u2019t seem to be of the sort that concern\nfeminists; while Putnam\u2019s division of linguistic labour arguably\ninvolves some power relations (experts have a special sort of\nlinguistic power that non-experts lack), the political aspects of\nthese power relations\u2014if any\u2014have been ignored. Andrea Nye\ncriticizes mainstream philosophy of language on roughly these grounds,\narguing that work on radical translation has not been sufficiently\nsensitive to political concerns (for the notion of radical\ntranslation, see the section on Meaning and Truth in the entry on\n Donald Davidson).\n\n\n\u2026a highly technical and professionalized English-speaking\nphilosophy of language was addressing problems of the possibility of\n\u2018radical\u2019 translation from one language community to\nanother, of alternate and incommensurable conceptual schemes, of the\ndifficulty of establishing singular reference across \u2018different\nworlds\u2019, but with virtually no reference to actual failures of\ncommunication or problems of gender. (Nye 1998: 266)\n\n\nMore recently, Louise Antony has argued that it is a mistake to\nsuppose that there is any particular approach to philosophy of\nlanguage that is distinctly feminist or anti-feminist, taking as her\nparticular target Hornsby\u2019s work\u2014but her arguments apply\nmore broadly. She argues that such strategies are \u201cdisrespectful\nto and exclusionary of feminists who support alternative views\u201d\n(2012: 277).\n",
