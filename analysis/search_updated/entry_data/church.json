    "preamble": "\n\nAlonzo Church (1903\u20131995) was a renowned mathematical logician,\nphilosophical logician, philosopher, teacher and editor. He was one of\nthe founders of the discipline of mathematical logic as it developed\nafter Cantor, Frege and Russell. He was also one of the principal\nfounders of the Association for Symbolic Logic and the\nJournal of Symbolic Logic. The list of his students,\nmathematical and philosophical, is striking as it contains the names\nof renowned logicians and philosophers. In this article, we focus\nprimarily on Church\u2019s philosophical contributions. (For an\naccount of his life and academic history see the Introduction to\nThe Collected Works of Alonzo Church (2019).) However, we\nalso discuss his mathematical results when it is desirable to do so in\norder to pursue a philosophical issue. In Church\u2019s case, the\ndistinction between philosopher and formal logician/mathematician is\nnot entirely correct, since all of his work (except for the\noccasional paper on some purely mathematical subject) concerns logical\nissues in one way or another.\n\nChurch brought both the general outlook and the specific distinctions\nof formal logic to bear on philosophy in a distinctive way by applying\nhis \u201clogistic method\u201d to the philosophical topics he\ndiscussed. Conversely, he also wove certain aspects of his philosophy\ninto the fabric of formal, mathematical logic as he presented it. The\nresult was a formidable combination of philosophical vision and\nfocused argumentation. For Church, the logistic method (or\nformalization) was not only necessary to obtain additional\nclarification beyond informal discussion and to make meta-mathematical\ninvestigations possible; it was also the ideal method for dealing with\nphilosophical problems in epistemology, metaphysics and philosophy of\nlanguage. It was Church\u2019s view that one who does not aspire to\nthis ideal falls short. However, he also recognized that formalization\nis not always appropriate. He did not demand that the natural sciences\nbe formalized and even provided an informal philosophical discussion\nof semantics in the introductory chapter of his Introduction to\nMathematical Logic (1956a). The theories and arguments discussed\nin this article describe and illustrate Church\u2019s logistic\nmethod.\n\nIn the following, we often use the notational conventions that Church\nadopted from Principia Mathematica (Whitehead & Russell\n1910; hereafter PM). When we do so, these conventions are explained\nand sometimes compared with modern notation.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Computability and Church\u2019s Thesis\n1.1 Church\u2019s Seminal Paper\n\nChurch was the first to devise a formalism\u2014the\n\u03bb-calculus\u2014within which it was possible to define a class\nof functions that coincide, arguably, with the intuitively computable\nfunctions\u2014those that can be evaluated by means of an algorithm,\ni.e., a computer program. He also provided, again arguably, the first\nexample of a particular significant function that is not\ncomputable. (Other examples, due independently to Kleene (1936) and\nTuring (1936) followed quickly.) He did this by constructing a\nfunction that is provably not recursive in the sense defined slightly\nearlier by G\u00f6del and Herbrand. He then appealed to the assumption\nthat any intuitively computable function is recursive to\nconclude that the function in question is not computable\u2014in\nChurch\u2019s terminology it is not effectively calculable.\n(We will continue to use the terms \u201ccomputable\u201d and\n\u201cintuitively computable\u201d rather than \u201ceffectively\ncalculable\u201d since they are more readily understood by\nnon-specialists.) Given the nature of this function, this meant that a\ncertain problem of elementary number theory is unsolvable: there is no\nway it could be solved by algorithmic means. It also implied a\nnegative solution to the Entscheidungsproblem first\nenunciated by Hilbert and Ackerman (1928): the problem whether there\nis a decision procedure for first order logic. The italicized\nassumption later came to be known as \u201cChurch\u2019s\nthesis\u201d (Kleene 1952).\n\nThe paper in which this result is presented, entitled \u201cAn\nUnsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory\u201d (1936a), is a\ngreat classic of logic and computability theory, but it has been\nsomewhat overshadowed by the almost contemporaneous and brilliant\npaper by Turing (1936), as well as the earlier remarkable\nincompleteness theorems of G\u00f6del (1931). In this section,\nChurch\u2019s paper takes center stage.\n\nSection 7 of Church\u2019s paper contains the first explicit\nformulation of Church\u2019s thesis (apart from a preliminary\nstatement in 1935c):\n\n\nWe now define the notion, already discussed, of an effectively\ncalculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the\nnotion of a recursive function of positive integers (or of a\nlambda-definable function of positive integers). This definition is\nthought to be justified by the considerations which follow, so far as\npositive justification can ever be obtained for the selection of a\nformal definition to correspond to an intuitive notion. (1936a [BE:\n119])\n\n\nChurch goes on to consider two natural ways one might seek to expand\nthe notion of computability beyond that of recursiveness (or\n\u03bb-definability) and he argued that each of these methods\nresults in functions that are already recursive (and\n\u03bb-definable) and so concludes:\n\n\nThus it is shown that no more general definition of effective\ncalculability than that proposed above can be obtained by either of\ntwo methods which naturally suggest themselves (1) by defining a\nfunction to be effectively calculable if there exists an algorithm for\nthe calculation of its values (2) by defining a function \\(F\\) (of one\npositive integer) to be effectively calculable if, for every positive\ninteger \\(m\\), there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(F(m)\n= n\\) is a provable theorem. (1936a [BE: 121])\n\n\nKleene (1952: 222\u2013223) discusses these two classic arguments for\nChurch\u2019s thesis. (See\n supplement A.2\n for further details.)\n1.2 What is Church\u2019s Thesis?\n\nChurch\u2019s thesis is the first of the following two propositions,\nbut the second plays an important role in discussions of the first. We\nuse the term \u201cCT\u201d for the conjunction of the two:\n\nCT1\nEvery intuitively computable function is recursive\nCT2\nEvery recursive function is intuitively computable.\n\n\nCT might be formulated in terms of \u03bb-definability or Turing\ncomputability or a number of other distinct mathematical conditions\nknown to be extensionally equivalent to recursiveness. Despite these\nequivalences, the differences are significant. On several occasions,\nG\u00f6del expressed a strong preference for Turing\u2019s analysis\nand there are good reasons for G\u00f6del\u2019s preference. These\nare amply detailed elsewhere (see the entry on the\n Church-Turing thesis\n as well as Davis 1965). Church himself thought that Turing\u2019s\nanalysis was superior to his:\n\n\ncomputability by a Turing machine \u2026 has the advantage of making\nthe identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly\ndefined) sense evident immediately. (Church 1937a [BE: 934])\n\n\nThe identification of \u03bb-definability with intuitive\ncomputability was certainly not \u201cevident immediately\u201d. In\nfact, Church\u2019s student, Stephen Cole Kleene, reports that it\nonly gradually dawned on Church, Rosser (J. Barkley Rosser, also\nChurch\u2019s student), and himself that \u03bb-definability may\nserve as a precise counterpart of intuitive computability (Kleene\n1981). Kleene also describes the difficulty of giving\n\u03bb-definitions of certain basic number theoretic\nfunctions\u2014particularly the predecessor function\u2014given the\nparticular way Church gives \u03bb-expressions standing for integers\n(1981: 56; these \u03bb-expressions are described in\n supplement D).\n But the fundamental difficulty with\n CT1\n as Church (1936a) enunciates it is that it is given as a definition\nwithout any accompanying justification other than a brief sketch of a\nproof of the extensional equivalence of \u03bb-definability and\nrecursiveness (Kleene [1936] gives a more detailed proof). G\u00f6del\ncomplained of exactly this:\n\n\nHe [G\u00f6del] insisted \u2026 that it was \u201cthoroughly\nunsatisfactory\u201d to define the effectively calculable functions\nto be some particular class without first showing that \u201cthe\ngenerally accepted properties\u201d of the notion of effective\ncalculability necessarily lead to this class. (Davis 1982:12)\n\n\nG\u00f6del eventually held up Turing\u2019s analysis as a better\nmodel of computation precisely because Turing justifies the\nidentification of intuitive computation with Turing machine\ncomputation on the basis of a detailed analysis of what a human\ncomputer, equipped with paper and pencil, must actually do (Turing\n1936: \u00a79). It seems that a counterpart of Turing\u2019s\ncompelling analysis has yet to be given for the case of\n\u03bb-computation. It should be emphasized, however, that\nChurch\u2019s main aim was not to defend an analysis of computability\nbut rather to set the stage for a proof that a particular number\ntheoretic combinatorial problem is not solvable. So long as\ncomputation is defined as a finite process, cardinality considerations\nimply that non-computable functions must exist, and Church wished to\ndemonstrate that his combinatorial problem was one of these.\n\nFor most of its life, Church\u2019s view\u2014that\n CT1\n is not subject to mathematical proof, or any sort of mathematical\ntreatment at all\u2014has prevailed. But some such as Shoenfield,\n(and Church himself), have observed that\n CT2\n is subject to intuitive proof despite the lack of a\nmathematically precise definition of \u201ccomputable\u201d\n(Shoenfield 1967: 120). Shoenfield\u2019s view of CT2 has been\nseconded by Kripke. All that is needed, Kripke says, is \u201cjust a\ndirect argument\u201d (2013). Moreover, Kripke and others (e.g.,\nMendelson 1990) have challenged the received view that CT1 is not\namenable to mathematical treatment. Accordingly, the discussion of CT1\ndivides into two parts: The first part is the evidence usually adduced\nfor CT1 on the assumption that it is a definition or hypothesis not\namenable to proof; and the second part is the evidence derived from\nrecent attempts to support CT1 by mathematical arguments. The first\nsort of evidence we may term \u201cexternal\u201d and the second\n\u201cinternal\u201d. The emphasis in what follows is on\nChurch\u2019s role in these developments.\n1.3 The Role of CT1\n\nIn Church\u2019s terms, the decision problem for a logistic system is\nthe problem of finding\n\n\nan effective procedure, a decision procedure, by which, for\nan arbitrary wff of the system, it is possible to determine whether or\nnot it is a theorem (and if it is a theorem, to obtain a proof of it).\n(1956a: 273)\n\n\nIn a footnote, Church remarked that from a classical point of view,\nthe parenthetical condition is not required, but is in \u201cthe\ndirection of\u201d intuitionism, which he described as\n\u201cradical\u201d, but the proviso nonetheless was, in subsequent\nparts of his 1956a, always included. But such a determination must be\nmade on the basis of a precise counterpart of the concept of an\neffective procedure, such as a recursive or \u03bb-definable\nprocedure. In case there is a positive result,\n CT2\n allows one to infer that a computable (effective) procedure exists;\nand if the result is negative,\n CT1\n allows the inference to its non-existence. This has been the role of\nCT in computability theory and the development of logic. A\nparticularly telling example is Church\u2019s negative solution to\nthe Entscheidungsproblem\u2014the decision problem for first\norder logic, now known as \u201cChurch\u2019s theorem\u201d\n(1936b). It was felt that a positive solution would render mathematics\ncompletely mechanical at least in principle. Every mathematical\nproblem could in principle be solved by an algorithm. On the other\nhand, the shape of a negative solution was a mystery. It is reported\nthat von Neumann declared that \u201cWe have no clue how to prove\nit\u201d (Gandy 1988: 62). Church\u2019s result rendered a negative\nsolution conceivable and gave some hope that the solution to\nmathematical problems would continue to require human ingenuity. In\nany case, appeals to CT1 have sometimes been viewed as part of the\nproofs giving the solutions to decision problems and\nsometimes not, depending on the required degree of formalization. To\nprove, for example, that some axiomatic theory is undecidable is to\nprove that its set of theorems is not recursive (or not Turing\ncomputable, etc.) and the appeal to CT1 often comes after the strictly\nmathematical work. However, it has not been common to suggest that one\nor other of the precise counterparts of intuitive computability should\nactually replace it; and although G\u00f6del comes close to\nsuch a view (in the case of Turing computability), this is not the\nstandard view. Other reductions of intuitive notions to mathematical\nterms have often been viewed as replacements (cf. Mendelson 1990); but\nthere has been resistance to this view in the case of Church\u2019s\nthesis, for otherwise logicians should long ago have ceased to speak\nof intuitive computability (effective calculability).\n\nHowever, significant developments in computability theory often take\nthe form of informal mathematics, as with the rest of mathematics. An\ninformal method of computation is given, where it is clear that it\ncould be replaced by a formal one although such a demonstration might\nbe thought to be unnecessary or cumbersome. To give a simple example:\nProofs of Craig\u2019s theorem that any recursively enumerable set of\nformulas is recursively axiomatizable often take the form of an\ninformal argument that the set of Craig-axioms is decidable; and then\n CT1\n is applied to conclude that it is recursive (cf. Craig 1953). Rogers\n(1967) gives many examples of the role of informal mathematics in\nconjunction with CT1 in computability theory. In fact, Rogers\u2019\nclassic text uses informal mathematics together with Church\u2019s\nthesis in its positive (non-contrapositive) form to develop recursive\nfunction theory as a whole. By contrast, Davis (1958) gives a fully\nformal account and so uses CT1 mainly in its contrapositive form, or,\nequivalently, in its positive form but resting on a reductio\nassumption. A third role of CT1 has been to motivate the proofs that\ncertain basic sets and relations are recursive. For example,\nmembership in the set of formulas of a standard formalized language is\nintuitively computable. Hence by CT1 it must be recursive, but a proof\nthat it is recursive can be surprisingly complex (see Boolos et al.\n2007: Ch. 15).\n1.4 The External Evidence\n\nThe classic account of the external evidence for\n CT1\n is by Kleene (1952: 318\u2013323). Kleene organizes the evidence\nunder four headings:\n\n(A)\nHeuristic evidence,\n(B)\nEquivalence of diverse formulations,\n(C)\nTuring\u2019s concept of a Turing machine, and\n(D)\nSymbolic logics and symbolic algorithms.\n\n\n(A) is the fact that large families of functions had been shown to be\n\u03bb-definable and hence recursive. (B) is the striking fact that\nthe various mathematically precise counterparts of\ncomputability\u2014\u03bb-definability, recursiveness, Turing\ncomputability and others of the period due to G\u00f6del and\nPost\u2014despite being technically quite different from one\nanother\u2014turn out to lead to the same class of functions. (Not\neveryone is impressed by this \u201cconfluence\u201d of definitions;\ncf. Kreisel 1987.) As for (C), Kleene observes that Turing\u2019s\nanalysis constitutes a direct attempt to give a mathematical account\nof the actions of a human computor and thus differs from the other\nanalyses (in terms of recursiveness and \u03bb-definability), which\n\u201carose differently\u201d. He remarks that Turing\u2019s\nidentification of intuitive computability with computability by a\n(Turing) machine constitutes an \u201cindependent statement of\nChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d. For this reason\n CT1\n has come to be known as the Church-Turing Thesis. Both Church (1937b)\nand Kleene (1952) also note that Post (1936) independently gives an\nanalysis very similar to Turing\u2019s. Perhaps, then, CT1 should\nproperly be known as the Church-Turing-Post-Thesis.\n\nKleene\u2019s (D) consists of the two arguments mentioned earlier by\nChurch (1936a: section 7). The first argument is that the notion of\ncomputation by means of an algorithm does not lead outside the class\nof recursive functions (cf. Shoenfield [1967: 120] for an argument of\nthe same sort). The second of these concerns the relation between\nrecursive functions and formal systems of \u201csymbolic\nlogic\u201d. Church argues that in any such system whose set of\ntheorems is recursively enumerable, if \\(f\\) is a unary\n(\u201csingulary\u201d is Church\u2019s term) function of positive\nintegers and if it is true that \n\\[\\tag{*} f(m) = n,\\]\n\n\nfor integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), then (in essence) \\((*)\\) is provable in\nthe system; and if \\((*)\\) is false, then it is not provable in the\nsystem, then \\(f\\) is recursive. See\n supplement A.2\n for a more detailed discussion of this controversial\nargument\u2014controversial because Church simply assumes\nthat the set of axioms and rules of a symbolic logic must be\nrecursive, and this has seemed to some to beg the question of the\ntruth of\n CT1\n and thus to constitute a \u201cstumbling block\u201d to the\nacceptance of Church\u2019s argument (Sieg 1997).\n1.5 The Internal Evidence\n\nMendelson challenged the view that\n CT1\n is not subject to mathematical treatment by citing cases in which an\nintuitive concept has literally been replaced by a\ncorresponding mathematically precise one. It is not a mere\nthesis that the limit concept, for example, is given by the\nfamiliar epsilon-delta definition. The definition replaces the\nintuitive concept (Mendelson 1990). Others have gone further, arguing\nthat computability may be taken as a primitive concept subject to an\naxiomatic treatment, as G\u00f6del had once suggested (according to\nChurch\u2019s letter to Kleene, 1935d [BE: 1000]). Sieg proposes an\naxiomatization based on Turing\u2019s analysis of a person who\ncomputes (\u201ca computor\u201d). In section 9 of his (1936),\nTuring argues (argument I) that the Turing machine is a good model of\na computor, who, as such, is subject to certain constraints such as\nthat\n\nthe behavior of the computor is completely determined by the\nsymbols observed and the computor\u2019s state of mind;\nthat there is a finite bound on the number of symbols observed at\nany one time;\nthat only a finite number of states of mind are involved at any\none time (a condition that G\u00f6del [1972] disputed); and\nthat each newly observed symbol is within finitely many steps of\nearlier ones.\n\n\nSieg, building on work of Gandy, formulates axioms corresponding to\nsuch conditions and claims that these constitute an axiomatization of\ncomputability (Gandy 1988; Sieg 1997).\n\nIn a recent paper (2013), Kripke argues that\n CT\n may be regarded as a \u201cspecial corollary\u201d of the\ncompleteness theorem for first order logic. Kripke\u2019s argument is\nreminiscent of one given earlier by Kreisel (1987) concerning, not CT,\nbut rather the relation between informal validity, on the one hand,\nand formal validity and provability on the other. It is useful to\nconsider Kreisel\u2019s argument first and Kripke\u2019s afterwards\n(some details of the following are not Kreisel\u2019s):\n\nLet \\(TA\\), \\(VA\\), and \\(DA\\) mean respectively that \\(A\\) is a first\norder translation of an informal argument that is intuitively valid\n\u201cin virtue of form alone\u201d, that \\(A\\) is valid according\nto the standard model theoretic definition of validity for first order\nlogic, and that \\(A\\) is derivable in a first order formal system of\ndeduction, \\(D\\), that is sound and complete in the usual sense. Then\ninformally, we have that \\(DA\\) implies \\(TA\\). If an argument is\nformally derivable, we regard it as valid in virtue of its form alone.\nAt least that is often taught to students. And also \\(TA\\) implies\n\\(VA\\)\u2014something also taught to students. By completeness,\n\\(VA\\) implies \\(DA\\). And so it follows that \\(TA\\)\u2014an informal\nnotion\u2014is equivalent to \\(DA\\), a formal notion, for the case of\nfirst order logic. (It might be assumed in addition that any\nintuitively valid argument is formalizable in a first order language,\nbut Kreisel does not assume this.)\n\nNow, Kripke summarizes his argument as follows:\n\n\nSuppose one has any valid argument whose steps can be stated in a\nfirst-order language. It is an immediate consequence of the G\u00f6del\ncompleteness theorem for first-order logic with identity that the\npremises of the argument can be formalized in any conventional formal\nsystem of first-order logic. Granted that the proof relation of such a\nsystem is recursive (computable), it immediately follows in the\nspecial case where one is computing a function (say, in the language\nof arithmetic) that the function must be recursive (Turing\ncomputable). (2013: 81)\n\n\nKripke assumes \u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d:\n\n\nnamely that the steps of any mathematical argument can be given in a\nlanguage based on first order logic (with identity)\n\n\nand he assumes that the proof relation is recursive and hence that the\nprovability relation is semirecursive. Thus, the argument runs as\nfollows: (1) Let \\(A\\) be a valid mathematical argument that is a\ncalculation, \u201cwhere one is computing a function (say, in the\nlanguage of arithmetic)\u201d. Then, (2) by Hilbert\u2019s thesis,\nthe steps of \\(A\\) can be stated in a first order language (and so the\npremises and conclusion of \\(A\\) can be stated in such a language).\nBut then (3) by the completeness theorem, there is a formal derivation\nof the conclusion of \\(A\\)\u2014the final result of the\ncalculation\u2014from its premises, and so (4) \u201cit immediately\nfollows\u201d that the function representing the calculation is\nrecursive. This is a proof of Church\u2019s thesis, assuming\nHilbert\u2019s, and, as Kripke mentions, it might therefore be viewed\nalternatively as a reduction of Church\u2019s thesis to\nHilbert\u2019s.\n\nThe similarity to Kreisel\u2019s argument is clear: Define \\(C(A)\\)\nto mean that \\(A\\) is a is correct mathematical calculation; then by\nHilbert\u2019s thesis, \\(C(A)\\) implies \\(V(A)\\) and by completeness\n\\(C(A)\\) implies \\(D(A)\\). Moreover, apart from the appeal to the\ncompleteness theorem, Kripke\u2019s argument is essentially the same\nas the Church-Kleene argument mentioned earlier and discussed in\n supplement A.1:\n\n\nIt is because of these considerations that I take myself to be\nreviving somewhat neglected arguments already given by Church, and\nespecially Turing. (Kripke 2013: 81)\n\n\nOne important consequence of Kripke\u2019s argument, in particular,\nis that as he observes, there is\u2014and has been from the\nbeginning\u2014a characterization of computable functions in terms of\nfirst order provability that is fully equivalent to the others (2013:\n82).\n2. Philosophy of Logic\n\nIn this section we describe how Church\u2019s wove certain\nphilosophical doctrines about logic into the fabric of formal,\nmathematical logic as he presented it in (Church 1956a, 1959, 1962b,\n1956\u201372). Church\u2019s early philosophy of logic is described\nin\n supplement B.\n2.1 Philosophy of Logic and the Logistic Method\n\nIn Church\u2019s philosophy of logic, the phenomenon of deductive\nreasoning is assumed to be \u201calready known, from experience with\nparticular instances of it\u201d and the stated goal of logic is to\nprovide a theory of such reasoning\n\n\nplus whatever is required in object language or metalanguage for the\nadequacy, generality, and simplicity of the theory. (1962b [BE:\n608])\n\n\nThis attitude required Church to accept not only first order logic but\nalso the logic of second and higher orders, so that he could study\nlogic in all its generality. It was not enough to accept, for example,\n\u201c\\((x) F(x) \\supset F(y)\\)\u201d, because there are infinitely\nmany sentences of this form requiring one to also accept\n\u201c\\((F)(y) \\hdot (x) F(x) \\supset F(y)\\)\u201d \u201cby\ngeneralization from infinitely many analytic sentences of the\nappropriate form\u201d (1962b [BE: 608]). (Note Church\u2019s\nnotational convention that a dot placed before a connective or (as\nabove) a quantifier brackets a proposition.)\n\nAnother consideration Church offered in favor of second order logic\nwas the more pragmatic one that a greater understanding of\nmathematical theories could be obtained by comparing their\nformulations in first and second order languages (1956a: chapter V).\n(Discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this entry; but see\nMyhill (1953), Shapiro (1991, 2001), Button and Walsh (2018) and the\ncitations therein. See also the entries on\n model theory,\n second and higher order logic, and\n Skolem\u2019s Paradox.)\n\nChurch\u2019s philosophy of logic was shaped not only on the one hand\nby a belief in the generality of logic but also on the other by the\nneed to avoid the paradoxes to be discussed in\n section 4.\n In order to avoid the paradoxes to which Frege\u2019s position lead,\nChurch was forced to work primarily within a type-theoretic\nframework\u2014the logic of second, third and higher orders up to and\nincluding w\u2014with different kinds of variables, with\ndifferent restricted domains of individuals, classes, relations, etc.\n(Church\u2019s type theory is described in\n supplement D.)\n Moreover, as we will now see, Church departed even further from Frege\nand Russell by presenting these ideas in terms of conventional model\ntheory.\n\nThe purpose of formal logic, in Church\u2019s view, was first and\nforemost to study the form of correct deductive reasoning in\nabstraction from its subject matter (1956a: \u00a700). For Church,\ndeductive reasoning operates on propositions, and so the study of such\nreasoning is the study of the logical form of propositions\u2014which\nChurch distinguished from their \u201ccontent\u201d or\n\u201cmatter\u201d (ibid)\u2014via the study of the logical forms\nof sentences that express them (ibid; cf. 1959 [BE: 475]). This way of\nstudying logical form invoked what Church called the \u201clogistic\nmethod\u201d (1956a). This required him to distinguish between\ninformal languages and formalized languages, because\n\n\nthe natural languages, including English, have been evolved over a\nlong period of history to serve practical purposes of facility of\ncommunication, and these are not always compatible with soundness and\nprecision of logical analysis\u2026 To adopt a particular language\nthus involves adopting a particular theory or system of logical\nanalysis. (1956a: \u00a700)\n\n\nIn order to adopt a formal language, one first devises what Church\ncalls \u201ca particular theory or system\u201d (1956a [BE: 373]),\nwhich is a syntactic theory. This specifies the primitive\nsymbols and formation rules for building the\nwell-formed expressions (the wffs) of the theory, as well as what\nare the axioms and inference rules. The\ntheorems are the wffs that occur at the end of\nproofs, which are themselves specified as finite sequences of\nwffs that are either axioms or inferable from prior wffs in the\nsequence according to the inference rules. In order for this theory to\nserve as a language, it must be provided with semantic rules\nthat assign designata (or denotations) to the names of the\ntheory, as well as values to expressions containing free\noccurrences of variables.\n\nThe logical forms of sentences are the ways that sentences are built\nup from the logical particles. From this perspective, to say that a\nwff B is a logical consequence of a set of wffs \\(\\Sigma\\) is\nto say that the logical forms of B and the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are so\nrelated that if the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are true, so is B. Moreover,\nsince logical form is sufficient to ensure this, for any argument of\nthe same logical form, if the premises are true, so is the\nconclusion. This leads to the now familiar idea that\n\n\nthe proof of a theorem (of the object language) shall make no\nreference to or use of any interpretation, but shall proceed purely by\nthe rules of the logistic system. (1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nChurch gave three reasons for this requirement. First, it adheres to\nextant standards of mathematical rigor. Secondly, reasoning purely by\nthe rules of the logistic system is safer than reasoning about any\ninterpretation one may wish to adopt, because\u2014as is discussed in\n2.2\u2014the object language is set up using an informal\nmeta-language that is \u201cso elementary and restricted that its\nessential reliability can hardly be doubted if mathematics is to be\npossible at all\u201d (1956a [BE: 415]). Finally, it allows one to\ndraw a precise distinction between form and content:\n\nReturning to B and \\(\\Sigma\\), if the former is a logical consequence\nof the latter, then, if we do not reinterpret the logical\nparticles but do reinterpret the nonlogical vocabulary by\nassociating it with different rules, then it will still be the case\nthat if all the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are true, so is B. In this way, we\ncan isolate the form of a proposition by studying the corresponding\nsentence and reinterpreting its non-logical vocabulary.\n\nThis, of course, is the now conventional model-theoretic treatment of\nlogical consequence originally due to Tarski (1937 [1941]) and\nextended to the logic of higher orders by Church\u2019s student Leon\nHenkin (1950), which is presented in Church (1956a). (For more on\nHenkin\u2019s contribution, see the entries on\n second and higher order logic\n and on\n Church\u2019s type theory.)\n It should be noted that Church, in addition to working in classical\nmodel theory with restricted universes that can be accommodated in ZF\nset theory, was also willing to allow the existence of a universal set\n(1974c). Further, he not only distinguished between sharply between\nmodel theoretic interpretations and intended interpretations (1956a),\nbut also argued that giving a particular model theoretic\ninterpretation of a formal language was not sufficient for describing\nits logic. In particular, he argued that giving a formal language\ncontaining empty names (like \u2018Pegasus\u2019) an interpretation\nwith inner and outer domains that invalidates Existential\nGeneralization (as well as, presumably, Universal Instantiation) was\nnot sufficient for describing the logic of that language (1965).\n2.2 Adopting a Formalized Language\n\nCentral to the logistic method is the process of adopting a formalized\nlanguage. This process takes place in an informal meta-language (such\nas a fragment of English) that\n\n\ndeals with matters of everyday human experience, going beyond such\nmatters only in that no finite upper limit is imposed on the number of\nobjects that may be involved in any particular case, or on the time\nthat may be required for their manipulation according to instructions.\n(1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nIncluded in Church\u2019s description of the process of adopting a\nformalized language is that one first specifies the primitive symbols\nand formation rules, which together with the axioms and inference\nrules constitute the primitive basis of the logistic system\n(which will become a language once semantical rules are added). The\ndescription of this process assumes that the person who undergoes it\nhas a stock of information about language and the world, the ability\nto understand definitions (such as the definition of \u201cprimitive\nsymbol\u201d) as well as the ability to understand and follow\ninstructions. Church also provided a rational reconstruction of how we\nlearn our first language and suggested that this method could, in\nprinciple, be used to learn a formalized language rather than a\nnatural language as a first language:\n\n\nSome part of the language must first be learned approximately by the\nmethod of example and imitation; then this imprecisely known part of\nthe language is applied in order to state rules of the language (and\nperhaps to correct initial misconceptions); then the known part of the\nlanguage may be extended by further learning by example and imitation,\nand so on in alternate steps, until some precision in knowledge of the\nlanguage is reached. There is no reason in principle why a first\nlanguage, learned in this way, should not be one of the formalized\nlanguages of this book, instead of one of the natural languages.\n(1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nThis assumes that the person who undergoes this process can not only\nstate rules but also apply them, so it assumes that such a person can\nreason as well as imitate behavior. In this way, it resembles,\nsomewhat, Church\u2019s earlier philosophy of logic in which he\ndistinguished between intuitive logic and formal\nlogic and maintained that intuitive logic cannot be learned and is a\nprecondition of reasoning in formal logic. (Church\u2019s early\nphilosophy of logic is described in\n supplement B.)\n One reason for the absence of the locution \u201cintuitive\nlogic\u201d from Church\u2019s mature philosophy might be that he\nwanted to avoid the impression that there is some essential difference\nbetween what should take place in an informal meta-language and what\nshould take place in a formalized object language. In fact, he was\nadamant that basic deductive reasoning should not have to\ntake place in an informal meta-language. Rather, once the object\nlanguage has been set up it\n\n\nshall be an independent language capable, without continued support\nand supplementation from the meta-language, of expressing those things\nfor which it was designed. (1956a: fn. 121)\n\n\nThe idea is that a person who can already reason as well as use an\ninformal meta-language to set up the object language can come to\nreason with greater rigor and to a greater extent in the object\nlanguage. At which point, having pulled herself up by her bootstraps,\nshe should no longer have any need for an informal meta-language. (Of\ncourse, a meta-language is still needed to prove certain meta-theorems\nabout the object language such as its consistency.)\n2.3 Logic and Communication\n\nWhen one is setting up a logistic system, the well-formed expressions,\naxioms and rules of inference must all be specified\neffectively in order that there can be an effective test of\nwhether a purported proof is really a proof. Intuitively, the\nrequirement is that one can test\u2014by looking at the symbols and\nfollowing a fixed set of instructions for performing concrete\noperations with symbols\u2014whether a given finite sequence of\nsymbols is a wff, or whether a given finite sequence of wffs is a\nproof of the last wff in the sequence. In the absence of such a\nmethod.\n\n\na proof would not necessarily carry conviction, the proposer of a\nproof could fairly be asked to give a proof that it was a\nproof\u2014in short the formal analysis of what constitutes a proof\n(in the sense of a cogent demonstration) would be incomplete (1959\n[BE: 477\u20138]).\n\n\nThe philosophy underlying Church\u2019s position is that mathematical\nproof and logical analysis\u2014as well as other attempts at precise\nreasoning\u2014should be public and communicable.\nJust as one should be able to convince an interlocutor that a\nmathematical proof is really a proof, so one should be able to\nconvince her that an argument more generally is cogent, which will\nalso require convincing her that meaningful assertions have been made.\nFurther, these questions should be addressed by the object\nlanguage in which one is speaking (although one will often have\nto look beyond the language to convince an interlocutor that\none\u2019s assertions are true):\n\n\nBut without the requirements of effectiveness, it might happen that\nsomeone confronted with a proof of a theorem (and admitting the axioms\nand rules of inference) might nevertheless continue to doubt the\ntheorem, because of doubt that the alleged proof actually is a\nproof\u2026. the proposer of the proof might be fairly asked to give\nsupplementary proof that it is a proof\u2014and for the purposes of\ndeductive logic, this supplementary proof ought then to be treated as\npart of the whole proof, and included with it when the process of\nproof is formalized by the logistic method. (1956\u201371 [BE:\n703])\n\n\nFor example, while there may be advantages to using the deduction\ntheorem as a primitive rule of inference, there is also reason to\navoid doing so, i.e., to obviate the need for supplementary proof\n(1956a: \u00a729 and fn. 181).\n\nFor Church, it is constitutive of a language that it provides the\nforegoing connection between reasoning and communication:\n\n\nFor, however indefinite or imprecisely fixed the common idea of a\nlanguage may be, it is at least fundamental to it that a language\nshall serve the purpose of communication. And to the extent that\nrequirements of effectiveness fail, the purpose of communication is\ndefeated. (1956a: \u00a707)\n\nTo say that an assertion has been made if there is a meaning evades\nthe issue unless an effective criterion is provided for the presence\nof meaning. An understanding of the language, however reached, must\ninclude effective ability to recognize meaningfulness (in some\nappropriate sense), and in the purely formal aspect of the language,\nthe logistic system, this appears as an effective criterion of\nwell-formedness. (1956a: fn. 120)\n\n\nIn short, an assertion can be recognized as meaningful only if there\nis an effective method for determining whether it is meaningful;\nChurch\u2019s logistic method provides such a method by way of\nwell-formedness. Further, since communication and conviction are at\nissue (as well as mere judgments of meaningfulness), one must also be\nable to tell which propositions have been asserted and, in\nparticular, which ones have been proved.\n\nHowever, some critics have questioned the cogency of Church\u2019s\nphilosophical arguments for his requirement of effectiveness (Anderson\n1998). Moreover, it should be noted that logical consequence is not in\ngeneral an effective notion. By Church\u2019s Theorem (1936a), there\nis no effective test for deciding the validity or provability of the\nwffs of first order logic or of logics of any higher order (as Church\nhimself notes; 1956\u201371 [BE: 703]). Further, as Church was\nacutely aware, there is a price to be paid for communicating and\nverifying proofs in a formalized language that meets the requirement\nof effectiveness. If the formalized language is sufficiently\nexpressive, it will be subject to G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems (see\n \u00a75.4).\n\nIt should also be noted that the question what exactly is an effective\nprocedure spurred Church\u2019s work on effective calculability and\nthe decision problem (see\n section 1).\n It is also motivated some of his other technical work such as his\nwork on constructive ordinals (1938).\n\nIn addition to the requirement of effectiveness, Church also demands\nthat proofs should be constructive. However, in later years his\nattitude became more ecumenical. See (1936b: fn. 10 added 1971 [BE:\n128]).\n3. Applications of the Logistic Method\n\nChurch used the logistic method to apply the general outlook and\nspecific distinctions of formal logic to problems in philosophy. In\nthis section we describe five such applications.\n3.1 Against Logical Empiricism\n\nChurch was never a member of the Vienna Circle and neither were Kleene\nnor Rosser (an ocean separated them from Vienna); nor did they show\nparticular sympathy for the Circle and its aims. Church was, however,\nappreciative of the work of Carnap in particular (cf. Church\u2019s\n[1939a] review of Carnap\u2019s Foundations of Logic and\nMathematics [1939]). But commenting on Carnap\u2019s\nCircle-inspired view that the sole task of philosophy is semantical\nanalysis, Church remarked that this \u201crepresents an extreme\nview\u201d (1943a). Church adds that, nonetheless, the importance of\nsemantical investigations to philosophy should not be\nunderestimated.\n\nThus, Church was among those logicians and philosophers who did\nnot subscribe to the Circle\u2019s approach to the question\nof meaning. This, of course, is not to deny that the Circle was a\npowerful force in the development of analytic philosophy (see the\nentry on\n logical empiricism).\n But Church and many of his students did not participate in the\nCircle.\n\nThe logical empiricists tried to explicate the notion of empirical\nverification in terms of logical entailment. We begin with their\nsecond attempt, an explication known as \u201cweak\nverifiability\u201d, which (like its predecessor, \u201cstrong\nverifiability\u201d) was framed in terms of logical entailment or\nlogical deducibility:\n\n\nS is empirically verifiable iff S logically entails\nA1, A2\u2026,\n\n\n(perhaps with the help of additional premises). More specifically, the\nform A. J. Ayer initially gave to this idea was as follows:\n\n\nIt is the mark of a genuine factual proposition\u2026that some\nexperiential [observation] propositions can be deduced from it in\nconjunction with certain other premises without being deducible from\nthese other premises alone (1936 [1952: 38\u201339]).\n\n\nFor example, from \u201cThis is a swan\u201d together with\n\u201cAll swans are white\u201d we can deduce \u201cThis is\nwhite\u201d although the latter cannot be deduced from \u201cAll\nswans are white\u201d alone. Thus, \u201cAll swans are white\u201d\ncounts as meaningful.\n\nBut this is obviously unacceptable and (as with its predecessor) it is\nproperties of logical entailment that cause the problem. To borrow\nAyer\u2019s own example (given in the second edition of his 1936\n[1952]), from \u201cThe Absolute is lazy\u201d together with\n\u201cIf the Absolute is lazy, then this is white\u201d, it follows\nthat \u201cThis is white\u201d, and this does not follow from the\nconditional premise alone. Hence, contrary to every bone in the\nlogical empiricist\u2019s body, \u201cThe Absolute is lazy\u201d is\nmeaningful. The argument can be redeployed to show that any sentence\nwhatsoever is meaningful.\n\nIn the second edition of Language, Truth, and Logic, Ayer\nattempted to remedy this problem. In a review, Church (1949a) roundly\nrefuted Ayer\u2019s proposal. This rebuttal sent verificationism and\nlogical empiricism itself into a tailspin. Carnap tried to rescue\nthese doctrines by adopting an approach not based directly on logical\nentailment but this effort was refuted by Kaplan (1975a). Despite\nthese difficulties, there is currently an intense revival of interest\nin the question of the empirical structure and content of scientific\ntheories and in Carnap\u2019s work in particular (see the entry on\n Rudolph Carnap).\n\nAyer\u2019s revised criterion of empirical verification is as\nfollows:\n\n\nS is directly verifiable iff either S is an\nobservation sentence or else S, perhaps in conjunction with\nother observation sentences A, B,\nC,\u2026, logically implies an observation sentence that is\nnot implied by A, B, C\u2026.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n\nS is indirectly verifiable if and only if\nS, perhaps in conjunction with other sentences P,\nQ, R,\u2026 logically implies a directly\nverifiable sentence D that is not implied by P,\nQ, R,\u2026. Furthermore, these sentences\nP, Q, R are each either analytic or\ndirectly verifiable.\n\n\nIn sum:\n\n\nA sentence is meaningful if and only if it is directly or indirectly\nverifiable, or else analytic.\n\n\nChurch argues as follows: Let \\(O1,\\) \\(O2,\\) and \\(O3\\) be\nindependent observation sentences (no one of them entails any other),\nand suppose \\(S\\) is any sentence whatsoever\u2014it might be\n\u201cThe Nothing Nots\u201d. Church shows that Ayer\u2019s\ndefinition entails that either \\(S\\) or its negation \u201cIt is not\nthe case that the Nothing Nots\u201d, is meaningful. For consider the\ndisjunctive sentence\n\n\n\\[ R: (\\nsim O1 \\cdot O2) \\lor (O3 \\cdot \\nsim S) \\]\n\n\n\\(R\\) together with \\(O1\\) entails the observation sentence \\(O3\\) and\nhence \\(R\\) is directly verifiable. Also, \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) entail\n\\(O2\\). This means that \\(S\\) is indirectly verifiable,\nunless \\(R\\) alone entails \\(O2\\). But if \\(R\\) alone entails\n\\(O2,\\) then its right hand disjunct alone entails \\(O2,\\) and hence\n\\(\\nsim S\\) is directly verifiable. So either \\(S\\) or \\(\\nsim S\\) is\nmeaningful and therefore many sentences that Ayer would reject as\nmeaningless are meaningful according to his definitions.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the foregoing argument may seem\nto depend crucially on a somewhat contested feature of classical\npropositional logic. The argument appeals to the principle that if \\(A\n\\lor B\\) logically entails \\(C\\), then \\(B\\) alone logically entails\n\\(C\\). But this in turn rests on the principle that \\(B\\) alone\nlogically entails \\(A \\lor B\\), for any \\(A\\), and this principle is\nrejected by so-called containment logics (for which see\n \u00a73.1 of the entry on connexive logic).\n However, it is possible to revise Church\u2019s argument so that it\nis compatible with containment-logical principles. So in fact\nChurch\u2019s argument is not in this way beholden to classical\nlogic.\n3.2 The Slingshot Argument\n\nIn Frege\u2019s logical system, declarative sentences stand for\n(bedeuten) truth values, which are two distinct abstract\nobjects in Frege\u2019s ontology. Thus Frege treated such sentences\nas a special kind of name. But others, Carnap in particular, viewed\nsentences as standing for propositions. In response, Church gave an\nargument, directly traceable to Frege, that the denotations of\nsentences are indeed their truth values, and so cannot be propositions\nas Carnap supposed. (While we prefer \u201cdesignate\u201d we will\nfollow Church and use \u201cdenote\u201d in this section.) This\nargument has become known as \u201cthe Slingshot\u201d, invoking the\nslaying of Goliath by David, for its ability to refute looming\nhypotheses such as that sentences are correlated directly with facts\nor propositions.\n\nChurch argued that sentences must stand for truth values, for\nif sentences stood for propositions, there would only be two\npropositions. A similar argument that all true sentences stand for the\nsame thing (and that all false sentences stand for a distinct thing)\nwas suggested by G\u00f6del (1944; for an extended discussion of truth\nvalues, the slingshot, and generalized truth values see the entry on\n truth values).\n Here we focus exclusively on Church\u2019s review, and his related\ncommentary in (1956a: \u00a704), which constitute the locus\nclassicus of the Slingshot argument.\n\nHere is a simple, ingenious, logic-notation-free version of the\nargument given by Church (1956a: \u00a704): Assume first that\nsentences do denote something or other. Now consider the following\nlist of sentences:\n\n(1)\nSir Walter Scott is the author of Waverley\n(2)\nSir Walter Scott is Sir Walter Scott\n(3)\nSir Walter Scott is the man who wrote twenty-nine Waverley novels\naltogether\n(4)\nThe number such that Sir Walter Scott is the man who wrote that\nmany Waverley novels is twenty-nine.\n(5)\nThe number of counties in Utah is twenty-nine.\n\n\nChurch argued that (1) and (5), which seem totally unrelated in\nmeaning, must denote the same thing, namely, their truth value (since\nthat is all they have in common). The only additional assumptions\nChurch works with are the following two:\n\n(A)\nCo-denoting names or definite descriptions are\ninterchangeable.\n\n(B)\nSynonymous sentences (or, Church remarks, nearly synonymous\nsentences such as (3) and (4)) have the same denotation.\n\n\nAssumption (A) allows that an occurrence of a name or a definite\ndescription N in a sentence S may be replaced by a name or description\nM that denotes the same thing without altering the denotation of S.\nThus, (2) comes from (1) by (A). (But it is not clear what role, if\nany, (2) plays in the argument.) (3) comes from (1) by (A); (4) comes\nfrom (3) by (B); and (5) comes from (4) by (A). A similar argument can\nbe used to show that all false sentences denote the same thing. A\nfurther conclusion, important to Church, is that if, as this argument\nseems to demonstrate, (1) and (5) denote the same thing, this cannot\nbe the propositions expressed by each, since those are clearly\ndifferent. (For further discussion see\n supplement C.1\n as well as the supplement to the entry on\n truth values.)\n3.3 The Translation Argument\n\nConsider the sentences\n\n(1)\nSeneca said that man is a rational animal\n(2)\nColumbus believed that the world is round.\n\n\nA natural analysis of such sentences is that they express a relation\nbetween Seneca or Columbus and the propositions that man is a rational\nanimal or that the world is round, where such propositions are\nobjective abstract entities that are the ultimate vehicles of truth\nand meaning. But there has been\u2014and no doubt always will\nbe\u2014skepticism about the existence of such entities and this has\nmotivated the view that sentences such as (1) and (2) express\nrelations between agents and sentence types or even particular\ninscriptions (or other tokens) of sentences of a particular language,\nwhere sentences are assumed to be more concrete than propositions.\nWhile this assumption of concreteness seems highly questionable in the\ncase of sentence types, Carnap and others nevertheless vigorously\npursued the project of analyzing (1) and (2) in terms that relate\nagents to such types. (The theory that saying and believing are\nrelations to particular physical tokens is obviously implausible.\nContrary to what it predicts, the destruction of such tokens would not\nhave voided Seneca\u2019s belief.) In response, Church deployed his\ntranslation argument (CTA) that if we limit our ontology to sentence\ntypes, then our semantic theory will not be able to provide a true\nanalysis of sentences like (1) and (2). (This is a crucial part of\nChurch\u2019s broader argument that no philosophical theory that is\nboth true and humanly understandable can do without propositions. We\nreturn to the rest of the argument in\n \u00a76.3.)\n\nCTA\u2014as formulated in Church\u2019s (1950a)\u2014is\nspecifically directed at Carnap\u2019s (1947) analysis of sentences\nlike (1) and (2), which in turn appeals to a particular notion of\nsynonymy. However, since Church has shown that Carnap\u2019s notion\nof synonymy is incorrect (via an argument described in\n supplement E),\n we can safely omit the details of Carnap\u2019s notion for present\npurposes and speak simply in terms of synonymy. Now, according to\nCarnap\u2019s analysis, (2) is synonymous with\n\n(3)\nColumbus was disposed to an affirmative response to the English\nsentence \u201cthe world is round\u201d.\n\n\nThis is presumed true in virtue of Columbus\u2019 disposition to\naffirm, say, \u201cEl mundo es redondo\u201d or a\nsynonymous sentence in some other language (such as the English\nsentence \u201cThe earth is round\u201d).\n\nChurch suggested that the reader translate (2) and (3) into German\nmaking sure that, among other things, \u201cthat the world is\nround\u201d as it occurs in (2) is translated as \u201cdass die\nwelt rund ist\u201d, whereas \u201cthe world is round\u201d as\nit occurs in (3) is translated as \u201cthe world is round\u201d.\nThe difference is that the sentence \u201cthe world is round\u201d\nis mentioned in (3), whereas it is used in (2);\nmoreover, (3) does not mention the German sentence \u201cdie welt\nrund ist\u201d, only the English sentence \u201cthe world is\nround\u201d and so a proper translation of (2)\u2014one that\npreserves meaning (and not merely \u201cthe main\npoint\u201d)\u2014will mention the latter not the former. So, the\ntranslations are:\n\n(4)\nColumbus glaubte, dass die Welt rund ist\n(5)\nColumbus war bereit, den englischen Satze \u201cThe\nworld is round\u201d zu bejahen.\n\n\n(Notice that if we replace \u201cThe world is round\u201d in (5) by\nits German translation, the result is clearly false, since the German\ntranslation is not a sentence of English.)\n\nChurch concluded this version of CTA by noting that (4) and (5) are\nclearly not synonymous, since they convey different information to a\nGerman speaker who does not speak English. Church concluded that,\ntherefore, (2) and (3) are not synonymous (1951a [BE: 294]). Church\nassumed, plausibly, that synonymy is an equivalence\nrelation\u2014reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Hence, the basic\nstructure of CTA is as follows: Assume that (2) and (3) are\nsynonymous. Then (4) and (5) are synonymous. But (4) and (5) are not\nsynonymous, and so neither are (2) and (3), and therefore (3) cannot\nserve as an analysis of (2).\n\nHowever, Church argued that translation is not needed to establish\nthat (2) and (3) are not synonymous, and he gave another argument that\ndoes not appeal to translation:\n\n\nIt is not possible to infer [(2)] as a consequence of [(3)], on\nlogical grounds alone\u2014but only by making use of an item of\nfactual information not contained in [(3)], namely, that \u201cthe\nearth is round\u201d means in English that the earth is round. (1950a\n[BE: 280])\n\n\nThe point is that it is only a contingent fact about the English\nlanguage that the particular sequence of symbols and associated sounds\n\u201cthe earth is round\u201d mean in English that the earth is\nround. (Compare Church\u2019s summary of his argument where he says\nthat it is designed to \u201cdispel any remnants of an illusion that\nthere is something in some way necessary or transparent about the\nconnection between a word or sentence and its meaning, whereas, of\ncourse, this connection is entirely artificial and arbitrary\u201d\n(1951a [BE: 294]).) Moreover, this additional factual information is\nneeded to infer (2) from (3). For example, the language might have\ndeveloped in such a way that \u201cround\u201d and\n\u201csquare\u201d were interchanged, so that to say \u201cthe\nearth is square\u201d in this version of English is to say that the\nearth is round. Note that the following would nonetheless be true in\nthis new version of English:\n\n\n\u201cthe earth is square\u201d means that the earth is square,\n\n\nwhere the latter used occurrence of \u201cthe earth is\nsquare\u201d is a pronouncement of the new version of English, not\nthe familiar one. This shows that the aforementioned factual\ninformation is needed to infer (2) from (3), since otherwise the\nexpression \u201cthe earth is round\u201d need not represent\nColumbus\u2019 belief. This argument that CTA does not essentially\ninvolve translation is worth a closer look, since Church himself\ndescribes the argument as expressing \u201cthe main point\u201d he\nis trying make via CTA:\n\n\nThe main point is that [(3)] is inadequate as an analysis of [(2)]\nbecause it conveys less information than [(2)] does. (1950b [BE:\n1061]; cf. Salm\u00f3n 2001)\n\n\nThe information conveyed by (2) but not (3) is:\n\n(6)\n\u201cThe earth is round\u201d means in English that the earth\nis round.\n\n\nChurch claims that this is \u201can item of factual information not\ncontained in [(3)]\u201d, and it was Church\u2019s view that the\nword \u201cEnglish\u201d as commonly used contains \u201creference\nto matters of pragmatics\u201d (1950b [BE: 1060]). By this he meant\nthat the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means something like, as Church\nputs it, \u201cthe language that was current in the United States,\nCanada and Great Britain in 1949 AD\u201d, since it allows that\nEnglish is an evolving rather than a fixed system (1950). If so, it\nseems clear that the information given by [(2)] is not contained in\n[(3)] and that translation is not required to establish this.\n\nHowever, in a further twist, Carnap responds that\n\u201cEnglish\u201d as \\(he\\) intends it means something like\n\u201cthe unique language having such and such semantical\nrules\u201d and he brings this to Church\u2019s attention in his\nletter (1950b [BE: 1063]), thus challenging Church\u2019s claim that\n(5) is an item of factual information not contained in (3) but needed\nto infer (2) from (3). Church recognizes the threat:\n\n\nThe objection would then be less immediate that [(2)] is not a logical\nconsequence of [(3)] and it is possible that it would disappear.\n(1950a [BE: 280])\n\n\nThe point is that if English is defined to be the unique language with\nsuch and such semantical rules and (5) is one such rule, then it looks\nas though (2) would be a logical consequence of (3), so\ninterpreted.\n\nIn the last paragraph of (1950a), Church briefly states two arguments\nthat he obviously views as cementing the falsehood of Carnap\u2019s\nanalysis, even if English is taken to be the language with such and\nsuch fixed semantical rules. He first observes that if Carnap\u2019s\nproposal is discussed in German rather than English, then it will not\nbe synonymous with the English version! The one version involves an\nEnglish sentence while the other a German sentence. Church\u2019s\nassumption appears to be that a correct analysis of (2) should be\nlanguage independent. Next, he observes that even if (3) logically\nentails (2), a person might not see the entailment, and so not draw\nthe inference, leading her to believe (3) and yet not believe (2). Is\nChurch\u2019s assumption here that if (3) were a correct analysis of\n(2), then understanding and believing it should entail understanding\nand believing (2)? If so, this would conflict with Church\u2019s own\nway of dealing with the Paradox of Analysis. Moreover, there is\narguably an outright inconsistency between Church\u2019s solution to\nthis paradox and his solution to the Mates puzzle, which we discuss in\n supplement C.\n Church\u2019s criticism of Carnap\u2019s notion of synonymy is\ndiscussed in\n supplement E.\n3.4 The Paradox of Analysis\n\nChurch\u2019s brief remarks on the paradox of analysis focus\nexclusively on the sentence\n\n(1)\nA brother is a male sibling.\n\n\n(While this is an example of a trivial analysis, its triviality does\nnot affect the cogency of Church\u2019s discussion.) Church renders\n(1) as\n\n(2)\n\\(b = \\textit{ms}\\)\n\n\nwhich he thinks of as an expression \u201cof the Boolean algebra of\nclasses\u2014or better, of class concepts\u201d (1946a [BE: 956]).\nAccording to this proposal, the concept of a brother is a kind of\n\u201cproduct\u201d of the concepts of a male and a sibling. (Of\ncourse, this ignores the relational nature of both sides of the\nequation. For example, the only siblings relevant to the definition\nare the brother\u2019s siblings; other siblings are ignored, and so\nthe analysis is incomplete. But we shall nonetheless stick to\nChurch\u2019s formulation.) The problem as Church sees it is\nthis:\n\n\nIf \\(b\\) and \\(\\textit{ms}\\) are the same concept, then it must be\npossible to introduce either in place of the other without alteration\nof meaning\u2014indeed this is clearly the intention, or part of the\nintention, of any analysis in the sense of Moore. Hence in particular\nthe analysis \\(b = \\textit{ms}\\) must not be different from \\(b = b\\)\nor \\(\\textit{ms} = \\textit{ms}\\). This would seem to reduce analysis\nto something trivial and uninformative. But it is evident\notherwise\u2014especially from cases in which, though a concept is in\nsome sense known, its analysis presents difficulty\u2014that analysis\nis not always trivial. (1946a [BE: 956])\n\n\nChurch argues that the paradox is a special case of what is now known\nas \u201cFrege\u2019s Puzzle\u201d. It is unclear how a statement\nof the form \\(a = b\\) can be both true and informative; for if it is\ntrue, then it would seem to say the same thing as \\(a = a\\), since\nthis is the result of substituting \\(a\\) for \\(b\\) in \\(a = b\\).\nMoreover, Church views (2) as a special case of an informative\nidentity statement, with the difference that (2)\u2014unlike a\nstatement of the form \\(a = a\\) that asserts the identity of\nobjects\u2014asserts the identity of concepts or senses. That is,\nChurch takes \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201cmale sibling\u201d to\ndesignate concepts in the context of (2), rather than classes, since\n(2) is meant to be an analysis. Further, while \u201cbrother\u201d\nand \u201cmale sibling\u201d designate the same concept, viz.\nbrother or male sibling, they may nevertheless\ndiffer in sense (that is, though they designate the same concept the\nexpress, they express different concepts as senses); and this\nis what explains how (2) can be informative and how the proposition\nexpressed by (2) can differ from that expressed by the trivial \\(b =\nb\\) or \\(\\textit{ms} = \\textit{ms}\\).\n\nThe power of Church\u2019s proposal may not yet be apparent due to\nthe triviality of the sample analysis. Recall Church\u2019s remark\nthat there are cases of analyses (or hoped for analyses) where\n\n\nthough a concept is in some sense known, its analysis presents\ndifficulty\u2014that analysis is not always trivial. (1946a [BE:\n956])\n\n\nIn philosophy the correct analysis of the concept of knowledge has\nproved to be profoundly elusive. In mathematics, the analysis of the\nconcept of the limit of a function was a triumph, as was the analysis\nof the concept of an effectively calculable (computable) function.\nChurch would view these as cases where analysans and\nanalysandum designate the same concept but express radically\ndifferent senses; and this does seem exactly right. Some, however,\nhave thought that Church\u2019s way of dealing with the paradox of\nanalysis and his way of dealing with Mates\u2019 problem are\nincompatible. This is discussed in\n supplement C.2.\n3.5 The Logic of Sense and Denotation\n\nChurch\u2019s (1943a) review of Carnap\u2019s Introduction to\nSemantics (1942) constitutes an important early step in the\napplication of the logistic method to the subject of semantics (see\nalso Church 1943c, 1951b, 1952, 1956a). Like Frege, Church believed\nthat the Sinn or sense of an expression is an\nobjective\u2014i.e., mind-and-language\nindependent\u2014abstract entity (cf.\n \u00a73.3\n and\n \u00a76.3)\n and that senses are needed in semantics for their power to explain\nthe informative nature of identity statements containing\nco-designating names, as well as to explain the failure of the\nsubstitutivity of co-designating names in intensional contexts (1943a;\n1956a: \u00a701). Moreover, Church also shared Frege\u2019s highly\ncontroversial view that in addition to assigning senses to expressions\nin scientific language, one should also assign them to expressions in\nnatural language. (See\n supplement E\n for discussion.)\n\nHowever, given that senses and propositions are objective, one might\nwonder whether theorizing about them via the logistic method should\nreally proceed indirectly, via the study of\nintensional semantic theories of possible languages (again, see\n supplement E),\n or whether the logistic method should instead study senses\ndirectly by theorizing about how these entities are related\nto one another and to the designata that they determine.\nChurch himself distinguishes these two approaches and claims that if a\ntheory could be formulated in a satisfactory way using the direct\nmethod, then \u201cit should be a comparatively simple matter to\ndevise a language with the desired sort of semantics\u201d (1979 [BE:\n807]). He pursued this direct approach in his papers on the Logic\nof Sense and Denotation or \u201cLSD\u201d (1946b, 1951a,\n1973b, 1974a, 1993).\n\nThe fundamental difference between the intensional semantic approach\nto language and the direct LSD approach to senses can be seen from the\nfollowing. Church\u2019s view that the sense assigned to a name by a\nsemantic theory is univocal raises the question of\nwhich sense to assign to \u201cHesperus\u201d. Further,\nnames can occur not only in customary contexts like\n\n(1)\nHesperus is a planet\n\n\nbut also in indirect contexts such as:\n\n(2)\nHammurabi believes that (1).\n\n\nWhich sense do we assign to \u201cHesperus\u201d in (2)? From the\nperspective of a Fregean semantic theory, this question has the\nfollowing answer. First, we distinguish the expression\n\u201cHesperus\u201d from an occurrence of it in a\nnon-customary syntactic position such as in (2). Secondly, we assign a\nnon-customary sense to its occurrence in (2) so that this occurrence\nexpresses not the customary sense of \u201cHesperus\u201d (say,\nthe first planet visible in the evening) but its indirect\nsense. Thirdly, we claim that this indirect sense determines the\nexpression\u2019s customary sense as the designatum of the\nnon-customary occurrence (cf. Frege 1892a; Salm\u00f3n 1993).\nHowever, such subtleties will require us to complicate the background\nlogic. In this case, we have to prohibit the application of Leibniz\nlaw to indirect contexts; this is because names with the same\ncustomary designatum but different customary senses cannot be\nsubstituted salva veritate within contexts where they\ndesignate their customary senses. For example, (2) can be true while\n(2*) is false:\n\n(2*)\nHammurabi believes that Phosphorus is a planet.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of LSD, these complications pertaining to\nindirect contexts can be avoided by replacing the occurrence of\n\u201cHesperus\u201d in (2) with a new name; and likewise for all\nother occurrences that would be assigned a non-customary\ndesignatum were we still working in a semantic theory. For\nexample, we can replace the customary occurrence of\n\u201cHesperus\u201d in (1) with a constant \u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d\nand replace the non-customary occurrence of \u201cHesperus\u201d in\n(2) with \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d. This raises the question of the\nrelationship between these constants.\n\nLSD was originally formulated in a simply typed \u03bb-calculus (of\nthe kind described in\n supplement D),\n which allows the subject matter of the theory to be sorted into\nvarious type hierarchies. Individuals (like Hesperus) are of type\n\\(\\iota_0\\). Senses (which Church calls \u201cconcepts\u201d) that\ndetermine individuals\u2014i.e., \u201cindividual\nconcepts\u201d\u2014are of type \\(\\iota_1\\) etc. In another\nhierarchy, truth values are of type \\(o_0\\), concepts of truth\nvalues\u2014i.e., propositions\u2014are of type \\(o_1\\), concepts of\npropositions\u2014i.e., \u201cpropositional\nconcepts\u201d\u2014are of type \\(o_2\\) etc. (Individuals are\ndesignated by constants, truth values are designated by sentences\nwhile propositions are designated by complex names corresponding to\n\u201cthat\u201d-clauses.) In addition to typed hierarchies of\nconcepts of individuals and concepts of truth values, there is also a\nhierarchy of functions and concepts of functions; for any types\n\\(\\alpha_k\\) and \\(\\beta_k\\), there exists a type\n\\(\\ulcorner\\)(\\(\\alpha_k\\) \\(\\beta_k )\\urcorner\\) of functions from\nentities of \\(\\beta_k\\) to entities of type \\(\\alpha_k\\).\n\nIn this framework, \u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d designates an individual of\ntype \\(\\iota_0\\) and expresses an individual concept of type\n\\(\\iota_1\\). Further, \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d designates this individual\nconcept in virtue of expressing a concept of type \\(\\iota_2\\) of the\nindividual concept. However, and crucially, in LSD this concept of\ntype \\(\\iota_2\\) is not the Fregean indirect sense of\n\u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d; rather, it is a distinct semantic primitive\nthat is assigned to \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d only. How, then, are these\nconcepts related?\n\nChurch tells us that there is a relation \\(\\Delta\\) that holds between\nconcepts of each type within a hierarchy and the entities of the type\nimmediately below it, for example between a concept of type\n\\(\\iota_2\\) and another concept of \\(\\iota_1\\). But something more\nneeds to be said to illuminate the nature of this relationship. This\nis because although it helps to increase the numerical value of a\nsubscript in order to remove ambiguity from our notation and indicate\na corresponding increase in type, this provides little or no\ninsight into the relationships among the concepts themselves,\nwhich are neither related by the numerical successor relation, nor\ndependent for their existence and identity on the notation for them.\nMoreover, expressing concepts may require adding new expressions to\nthe language, so not everything can be expressed using a fixed\nvocabulary like the numerals.\n\nThis bring us to an objection, which arises from the fact that\nintensional contexts can be iterated:\n\n(1)\nHesperus is a planet\n(2)\nHammurabi believes that (1)\n(3)\nMonica said that (2)\n\u00a0\nAd infinitum.\n\n\nReplacing such constructions with the corresponding ones in LSD\nrequires an infinity of independent names,\n\u201cHesperus0\u201d\u2014\u201cHesperusn\u201d,\ncorresponding to the occurrences of \u201cHesperus\u201d in (1),\n(2), (3), etc. If these names named an infinity of primitive and\nindependent concepts, Church\u2019s proposal would be subject to the\nobjection that a language for which LSD was a semantic theory could\nnot be learned (Davidson 1965). To meet this objection, something more\nneeds to be said about the nature of the relation \\(\\Delta\\). The\nissue is discussed in\n supplement E,\n as are Church\u2019s numerous other achievements in the philosophy\nof language.\n\nA more formidable problem is that John Myhill was able to derive a\nversion of the so-called \u201cRussell-Myhill paradox (RM)\u201d\nwithin Church\u2019s initial formulation of LSD (see Myhill 1958). In\nresponse, Church reformulated LSD by ramifying the relation \\(\\Delta\\)\n(1973\u20134). In response, Anderson (1987) showed that the source of\nthe inconsistency of LSD lay in its axioms. We turn to the subject of\nantinomy and paradox and their impact on Church\u2019s work in the\nnext section.\n\nBefore we do so, it should be noted that LSD had some influence on the\ndevelopment of intensional logic. Both Kaplan (1964) and Montague\n(1969, 1970b) built on Church\u2019s work, combining type theory with\nCarnap\u2019s (1947) notion of an intension as a function from worlds\nto extensions. However, to the extent that Kaplan and Montague favored\nCarnap\u2019s notion of an intension they disagreed with Church\nhimself, who rejected this notion and treated senses along the same\nlines as Frege (again, see\n supplement E).\n Anderson (1980, 1987, 2001), Klement (2002), T. Parsons (2001) and\nSalm\u00f3n (2010) follow Frege and Church more closely. Bealer\n(1982) also responded to Church. (See also the entry on\n intensional logic.)\n4. Paradox\n4.1 Antinomy in Church\u2019s Work\n\nChurch\u2019s work was dogged by what he termed\n\u201cantinomies\u201d, which he distinguished from paradoxes in\nthat the former result in outright contradiction whereas the latter\ngive rise only to unacceptable conclusions. (Quine\u2019s paradox\ndiscussed in\n supplement C\n is an example of a paradox that is not an antinomy.) His early\nattempt at providing foundations for mathematics turned out to be\nsusceptible to Russell\u2019s antinomy (Church 1932) and\nRichard\u2019s antinomy (Church 1933). (Hereafter we use\n\u201cparadox\u201d rather than \u201cantinomy\u201d since that is\nthe current usage; but bear in mind that there are then two kinds of\nparadox.) His later attempts to formulate LSD gave rise to the\nRussell-Myhill paradox and Anderson\u2019s (1987) paradox, which\ndrove Church to turn to Ramified Type Theory (or \u201cRTT\u201d) as\na solution (see below\n \u00a74.4\n and\n \u00a75).\n In addition Church was convinced that Simple Type Theory (or\n\u201cSTT\u201d, see\n supplement D)\n supplemented with a semantical predicate is threatened by the\nsemantical paradoxes and in particular by the Grelling-Nelson paradox\n(the \u201cheterological\u201d paradox), hereafter\n\u201cGrelling\u2019s paradox\u201d or GP. Church had an intense\ndesire to show first how GP may be derived in STT so supplemented,\nsecondly, how RTT resolves the problem, third, that adding the axioms\nof reducibility does not restore the paradox and in fact leads to an\nimportant definability result concerning RTT with reducibility, and\nfinally, fourth, that the resolution of GP by means of RTT does not\ndiffer significantly from a Tarskian resolution in terms of the\ndistinction between object and metalanguage.\n4.2 Grelling\u2019s Paradox\n\nThis paradox is usually\u2014and was originally\u2014formulated as\npertaining to adjectives expressing properties that are or are not\ntrue of the adjective (the word) itself. For example,\n\u201cshort\u201d is short, whereas \u201cred\u201d is not red.\nThose adjectives that have the properties they express are termed\n\u201cautological\u201d and those that don\u2019t are termed\n\u201cheterological\u201d. The problem arises with the question: Is\n\u201cheterological\u201d heterological or not? And the answer is\nthat it is if and only if it\u2019s not. But the paradox is better\nformulated in terms of the extensions, in general, of any sort of\npredicate\u2014adjective, common noun, or verb phrase. Some\npredicates belong to their own extensions and some do not. The problem\narises if it supposed that there is a\npredicate\u2014\u201cheterological\u201d\u2014whose extension\nconsists of exactly those predicates that do not belong to their own\nextensions, since then \u201cheterological\u201d belongs to its\nextension if and only if it does not.\n\nViewed in this way, the reasoning of the paradox is in direct\nviolation of Cantor\u2019s theorem. The latter theorem is usually\nthought of as the principle that the cardinality of the power set of a\nset is greater than that of the set; and applied to an infinite set,\nthis leads to the sequence of ever larger infinite cardinal numbers.\nBut in its most basic form\u2014from which the result about\ncardinality follows as a corollary\u2014Cantor\u2019s theorem is the\nfollowing set theoretical principle:\n\nCantor\u2019s Lemma (CL)\n\nLet \\(f\\) be a function with domain \\(A\\) and range \\(B\\). Then the\nset: \\(D_{f} = \\{x \\in A: x \\not\\in f(x)\\}\\) is not in \\(B\\).\n\nProof. If \\(D_f\\) is in \\(B\\), then there is some \\(y\\) in\n\\(A\\) such that \\(f(y) = D_f\\). It now follows that \\(y\\) is in\n\\(D_f\\) iff it\u2019s not. Contradiction. Note that when \\(A = B\\)\nand \\(f\\) is the identity map defined on \\(A\\), the result is (a form\nof) the theorem asserting that the set of non-self-membered sets does\nnot exist.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning, firstly, that this principle underlies\ndiagonal argumentation in general (cf. Gaifman 2006). Even venerable\nexamples such as Post\u2019s informal argument that there is a\nrecursively enumerable set of positive integers whose complement is\nnot recursively enumerable, rely in essence on\n CL\n (Davis 1965: 312). A slight variant of CL is frequently found in the\nliterature on undecidability (cf. Shoenfield 1967: 131). Secondly, the\nproof of CL only relies\u00a0on minimal set-theoretic resources. Of\ncourse, the famous corollary of CL about cardinality relies\non\u00a0the power set axiom. But the theorem that there can be no\none-one function from a set onto its power set is otherwise a direct\nconsequence of CL. In this case, \\(D_f\\) must be in \\(B\\), since it\nbelongs to the power set of \\(A\\), and the conclusion must be that\n\\(f\\) does not exist. Third, Grelling\u2019s paradox as well as\nBerry\u2019s paradox can be used as a basis for alternative proofs of\nthe first incompleteness theorem (Boolos et al. 2007; Kripke 2014).\nLastly, a somewhat more general form of CL pertaining to relations in\ngeneral\u2014not just to functions\u2014, which is now accepted as a\nversion of Cantor\u2019s Theorem, was already noticed by Russell\n(1903). Whereas CL is essentially a principle of first order logic,\nthe relational version is second order in nature.\n\nTo say that \\(D_f\\) is not an element of \\(B\\), where \\(B\\) is the\nrange of \\(f\\), is to say that there is no element \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) such\nthat \\(f(x) = D_f\\). Applied to predicates and their extensions,\n CL\n implies that for any function \\(g\\) mapping some predicates\n\\(A\\) to their extensions, there is a predicate\n\u201cheterological\\(_g\\)\u201d whose extension is \\(D_g\\) although\nthis predicate cannot be in the domain of \\(g\\). However, assuming\nthat there is a function, \\(h\\), mapping every predicate to\nits extension, there can be no predicate, heterological\\(_h\\), at\nall, whose extension is \\(D_h\\). From a Tarskian point of view,\nheterological\\(_h\\), must be a predicate of the metalanguage. From\nChurch\u2019s point of view, there are a multiplicity of\nheterological predicates analogous to, but not the same as, the\nheterological\\(_g\\) predicates, distinguished by their types and\norders in the ramified hierarchy. CL is exploited in the next\nsection.\n4.3 Comparing Russell and Tarski\n\nIn an important paper but one still not widely discussed in print,\n\u201cA Comparison of Russell\u2019s Resolution of the Semantical\nAntinomies with that of Tarski\u201d (1976), reprinted with some\nadditions and corrections in Martin (1984) and The Collected\nWorks (2019), Church does the following:\n\nHe gives an elegant formulation of RTT as a straightforward\ncomplication of STT. (See\n supplement D.\n We adopt the definitions and notations used there.)\nHe shows how Grelling\u2019s paradox, GP, may be derived within\nSTT with the addition of a semantical predicate Val in the object\nlanguage interpreting \u201cforms\u201d (wffs containing free\nvariables) and governed by appropriate postulates.\nHe shows how RTT resolves GP and how it answers the question\nwhether \u201cheterological\u201d is heterological or not. Depending\non its level, it sometimes is and sometimes is not; but the assignment\nof levels is not ad hoc. It emerges as a product of RTT along\nwith the axioms about Val.\nHe defines languages \\(L_1,\\) \\(L_2,\\)\u2026, \\(L_{n +\n1},\\)\u2026, \\(L_w = L,\\) in terms of the r-types and Val,\nwhere \\(L_{n + 1}\\) is a semantical metalanguage for \\(L_n\\).\nHe shows how analogues of Tarski\u2019s definitions of\nsatisfaction and truth and Tarski\u2019s theorem are obtained for the\nlanguages \\(L_n\\) and concludes that Russell\u2019s resolution of GP\nis a special case of Tarski\u2019s.\nHe formulates the axioms of reducibility which are needed to\nrestore the impredicative definitions required for classical\nmathematics. He then shows that reducibility does not, at least not in\nany obvious way, reinstate GP. However, the system with Val and\nreducibility does prove certain results about definability and\nnameability of propositional functions.\n\n4.4 The Derivation and Dissolution of GP\n\nIn the following, we focus on Church\u2019s Russellian resolution of\nGP and leave aside most of the remaining issues. In this we are aided\nby a simplified account of the matter prepared by Church (1995a). The\nsimplification does not omit anything essential to the argument of\nChurch (1976) regarding GP specifically. It is clear that a main\nconcern of Church was to communicate once and for all Russell\u2019s\nresolution of the semantic paradoxes to a wider audience.\n\nChurch\u2019s r-typed Val predicate is rather clumsy, but it\nis required for the generalizations in (1976) to accomplish all the\ngoals listed above. In the simplified account, however, Val is\nreplaced by a denotation predicate \\(D(v, F)\\), where \\(v\\) is a word,\nunderstood to be an individual, and \\(F\\) is a propositional function\nof any r-type. \\(D(v, F)\\) is read \u201c\\(v\\) denotes\n\\(F\\)\u201d. Church remarks that\n\n\nWe shall make use only of the case that the second argument of \\(D\\)\nis a singulary functional variable or singulary functional constant of\nlowest type, so fixing the type of \\(D\\). (1995a [BE: 929])\n\n\nThe r-type of \\(D\\) is then \\((i (i))/1\\), for the purposes\nof the following.\n\nChurch first shows how GP may be derived within STT using certain\nprinciples concerning \\(D\\), the first of which is a principle of\n\u201cunivocacy\u201d:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{*} D(v,F) \\supset_{v F} \\hdot D(v,G) \\supset_{G} \\hdot F(x) \\equiv_{x} G(x).\\]\n\n\n\n(Note the following notational conventions. Firstly, a connective can\ntake a variable as subscript: that variable becomes a universal\nquantifier whose scope is precisely that of the connective. Secondly,\na dot placed before a connective brackets a proposition. The stars are\nalso Church\u2019s notation.) Church decides to avoid the stronger\naxiom asserting that \\(D\\) is functional due to complications\nconcerning identity in the ramified theory, but the effect is the\nsame. The\n axiom *\n guarantees a weaker form of functionality: It is a function from\nwords as individuals to extensions of propositional functions,\nassuming the axiom of extensionality for such extensions. Next Church\ninvokes an informally stated principle that he describes as\n\u201creasonable\u201d:\n\n**\nWhenever an individual or a propositional function has been\ndetermined in some unique way, it is permissible to extend the\nlanguage by introducing a constant (a word) which denotes it.\n\n\nOn this basis, he says, the constant \u201chet\u201d may be\nintroduced together with an axiom defining it implicitly:\n\n\n\\[\\tag*{***} \\het(w) \\equiv_{w} (\\exists F) \\hdot D(w, F) \\cdot \\nsim F(w).\\]\n\n\n\n(Note the difference between the dot placed before the connective and\nthe conjunction sign itself.) By a simple deduction from the three\nstarred principles and basic logic, Church derives both \\(\\het(v)\\)\nand \\(\\nsim \\het(v)\\). Church\u2019s deduction closely resembles one\ngiven by Copi (1971), who attributes it to Ramsey. (See\n supplement F.)\n\nChurch clearly thinks that the starred principles are\n\u201creasonable\u201d and that the only problem is that they make\nuse of an impredicative definition, namely,\n ***,\n and that when the starred principles are suitably ramified, the\nproblem can be solved in the manner Russell (1908) foresaw and\nimplemented, if imperfectly (PM). He remarks that\n\n\n\\[\\tag*{****} \\het^{m+1} (w) \\equiv_{w} (\\exists F^{1/m}) \\hdot D(w,F) \\cdot \\nsim F(w)\\]\n\n\n\nwhich replaces\n ***,\n when level indicators are supplied, defines an infinite list of het\npredicates, \u201chet2\u201d,\n\u201chet3\u201d, \u2026, and the two other starred\nprinciples are also to be supplied with level indicators. Church now\ngives what appears to be a hastily composed list of inferences with\nannotations but no comment. However, Church in effect here proves the\nanalogues of theorems (6) and (7) of (1976), with \\(D\\) in place of\nVal. These are: \n\\[\\tag{\\(6'\\)} \\left[D^{m +1} (v, G^{1/m+1}) \\hdot G(x) \\equiv_{x} \\het^{m+1} (x)\\right] \\supset \\nsim \\het^{n+1} (v), \\textrm{ if } m \\ge n \\]\n \n\\[ \\tag{\\(7'\\)} \\left[D^{m +1} (v, G^{1/m+1}) \\hdot G(x) \\equiv_{x} \\het^{m+1} (x)\\right] \\supset \\het^{n+1} (v), \\textrm{ if } m \\lt n. \\]\n\n\nTo derive these, Church assumes that:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{5} \\het^{n+1} (v) \\supset \\het^{m+1} (v), \\text{ if } m \\ge n.\\]\n\n\n(5) is a theorem of (1976).\n\nNote that, as in the case of Val, the level \\(m+1\\) of \\(D^{m+1}\\) is\ndetermined entirely by the level of its second argument place. (5) is\nneeded as a lemma in the proofs of (\\(6'\\)) and (\\(7'\\)). In (1995a)\nChurch appeals to (5) without comment, perhaps assuming implicitly the\n\\(D\\)-analogue of axiom (4) of (1976) reflecting that the types of the\nsemantical predicates are cumulative\u2014as are the types of (1976)\nin general. It is also worth noting that in the background is an\nr-typed version of the\n principle **\n asserting that at any level \\(m\\) there is a word \\(v\\) denoting a\nproperty having the same extension as \\(\\het^m\\). (Compare theorem (8)\nof (1976).)\n\nIn this scheme, the question whether the word\n\u201cheterological\u201d is heterological becomes the question\nwhether a word \\(v\\) denoting that property, or rather a word with\nsame extension, is heterological; and the answer is that it depends on\nthe level of the property \\(\\het^{m+1}\\).\n\nAt levels equal to or less than \\(m+1\\), \\(\\het(v)\\) is false; that\nis, \\(v\\) is autological. At levels greater than \\(m+1\\), v is\nheterological; this, according to (\\(6'\\)) and (\\(7'\\)). There is,\ntherefore, no one property of heterologicality such that it\nis possible to ask whether a word for it is heterological or not; and\nthis blocks GP.\n\nChurch\u2019s point of view is that the semantical primitives and\nprinciples, including\n **,\n that were added to STT to obtain GP are all \u201creasonable\u201d.\nThe only thing missing is ramification. This is in essence why Church\nthought that RTT provides the framework for the solution to the\nsemantical paradoxes. (For more details see\n supplement F.)\n\nIn an undated typescript newly published in The Collected\nWorks (n.d., [BE: 928]), Church formulates conditions required\nfor the derivation of the Berry paradox within STT and indicates how\nit is resolved in RTT. He uses Val to formulate a condition giving the\n\u201cBerry number\u201d of a formula. His formulation is quite\nsimilar to that found in Boolos et al. [2007: 228). But in this short\nnote he does not give a derivation of the paradox within STT.\n4.5 The Russell-Myhill Paradox\n\nIn a later paper, Church turns his attention to a paradox that Russell\nformulates in Appendix B of Principles of Mathematics (1903).\nOnce again, Church\u2019s aim is first to show how this contradiction\narises in STT, and then to appeal to RTT as a means of solving the\nproblem. This time, however, STT is not supplemented directly by any\novert semantic principles concerning denotation or predication, but\nonly by a predicate for identity of propositions and axioms supporting\nRussell\u2019s view as of 1903, that if a pair of propositions differ\nby a constituent, then they are different propositions. For example,\nif \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are distinct classes of propositions, then the\npropositions expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in \\(X\\) is\ntrue\u201d differs from that expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in\n\\(Y\\) is true\u201d. Given this principle\u2014call it\n\u201cStructure\u201d\u2014if such propositions are correlated with\nthe classes they mention, then it is possible to diagonalize and\nobtain a contradiction. For let \\(W\\) be the class of propositions\nthat are not in the classes with which they are correlated, and\nconsider the proposition expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in\n\\(W\\) is true\u201d. Then this proposition is in \\(W\\) if and only if\nit\u2019s not. (Note that this argument involves yet another\nviolation of\n CL,\n since in effect it defines a function \\(f\\) from propositions to sets\nof them, and then assumes that \\(D_f\\) is in the range of \\(f\\). )\nChurch gives a careful proof theoretical analysis of this argument\nshowing exactly what formal principles must be assumed for it to be\nformally derivable. (See\n supplement F\n for a sketch of some details.)\n\nIn a certain form, this contradiction actually rose up to bite Church\nhimself, because Myhill (1958) was able to derive a version of it\nwithin Church\u2019s initial formulation of LSD. Thus it has come to\nbe called \u201cthe Russell-Myhill paradox (RM)\u201d. In fact, RM\ncan be deployed to prove the inconsistency of popular accounts of\npropositions such as that of Soames (1987, 2010; see Deutsch 2008,\n2014, 2019). Recently, however, higher order versions of RM have\nenjoyed attention from philosophers seeking to draw metaphysical\nmorals (Goodman 2017; Uzquiano 2015). These writers see the\ncontradiction as a proof that Russell\u2019s Structure principle is\nfalse. But neither Russell nor Church saw it that way. Russell left\nthe problem open and Church turned to RTT for a resolution.\n4.6 The Knowability Paradox\n\nIn the course of writing a referee\u2019s report on a paper submitted\nto the Journal of Symbolic Logic by Frederick Fitch, Church\ngives the following inspired argument:\n\nThen it may plausibly be maintained that if \\(a\\) is not omniscient,\nthere is always a true proposition which it is empirically impossible\nfor \\(a\\) to know at time \\(t\\). For let \\(k\\) be a true proposition\nwhich is unknown to \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\), and let \\(k'\\) be the\nproposition that \\(k\\) is true but unknown to \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\).\nThen \\(k'\\) is true. But it would seem that if \\(a\\) knows \\(k'\\) at\ntime \\(t\\), then \\(a\\) must know \\(k\\) at time \\(t\\), and must also\nknow that he does not know \\(k\\) at time \\(t\\) \u2026 this is a\ncontradiction. (1945b [Salerno (ed.) 2009: 14])\n\n\nIt follows that it is impossible for \\(a\\) to know \\(k'\\) at time\n\\(t\\). A generalization of this argument appears to show that if there\nare true propositions that are not known to be true, then there are\ntrue propositions that cannot be known\u2014that are unknowable.\nContrapositively, if every true proposition can be known, then every\ntrue proposition is known\u2014which is clearly absurd.\n\nThe generalization\u2014which Church does not formulate and which was\nfirst formulated by Fitch (1963)\u2014has become known as \u201cThe\nKnowability Paradox\u201d or \u201cFitch\u2019s Paradox\u201d and\nit has been the subject of a great deal of wide-ranging commentary\ncollected in Salerno\u2019s (2009). Fitch\u2019s argument may be\nformulated as follows:\n\nAssume for reductio that \\(K(p \\hdot \\neg Kp)\\).\nThen \\(Kp \\hdot K\\neg Kp\\), assuming \\(K(q \\hdot r)\\) implies \\(Kq\n\\hdot Kr\\), for arbitrary \\(q\\) and \\(r\\).\n\\(\\neg Kp\\), assuming \\(Kq\\) implies \\(q\\), for arbitrary\n\\(q\\).\nHence, \\(Kp \\hdot \\neg Kp\\) by logic.\nTherefore, \\(K(p \\hdot \\neg Kp)\\) cannot possibly be true, and\ntherefore, \\(p \\hdot \\neg Kp\\) is unknowable.\n\n\nFitch, in his (1963), does not state the argument 1\u20145, but\ninstead notes that the proof of his generalized conclusion is\n\u201csimilar\u201d to Church\u2019s argument. Surprisingly, Church\ndoes not comment on the incompatibility of a Fitch-style\ngeneralization with the logical positivist doctrine that any\nmeaningful and true proposition is in principle verifiable and hence\nknowable. The contemporary revival of Fitch\u2019s argument, however,\nis almost entirely devoted to this issue and, more generally, to the\nconsequences of Fitch\u2019s argument for widely held views committed\nto the principle that there are no unknowable truths.\n\nChurch remarks in effect that step 2, the distribution of \\(K\\) over a\nconjunction, is an instance of the doubtful principle that the logical\nconsequences of a known proposition are also known. He also notes that\nthere are \u201cfools\u201d who would believe a conjunction and yet\nnot believe its conjuncts. But could there be such foolishness as to\ncount a conjunction as known and yet not count its conjuncts\nas such? Most find this highly implausible. Finally, Church suggests\nthat his argument runs afoul of type restrictions. Linsky, in his\n(2009), gives a lucid account of the application of Church\u2019s\n1976 version of RTT to the knowability paradox. See also the entry on\nFitch\u2019s Paradox of Knowability.\n5. Foundations of Mathematics\n\nChurch was primarily concerned with providing a foundational system\nthat meets two basic conditions: (1) it avoids the paradoxes, and (2)\nit is adequate for extant mathematics. These two conditions will be\nthe main focus of this section.\n5.1 Attempts at Type-Free Foundations\n\nLater in his career, Church looked to RTT to meet conditions (1) and\n(2); but in his early forays into foundations he was quite dismissive\nof RTT:\n\n\nRather than adopt the method of Russell for avoiding the paradoxes of\nmathematical logic, or that of Zermelo, both of which appear somewhat\nartificial, we introduce for this purpose, as we have said, a certain\nrestriction on the law of excluded middle. (1932 [BE: 52])\n\n\nIt turned out that despite this restriction a form of Russell\u2019s\nparadox is derivable in the system of 1932. Nevertheless, it was here\nthat Church first formulated the (untyped) \u03bb-calculus as a mere\npart of the whole system. This part turned out to be of great\nimportance for the theory of computation, formal semantics and for the\nfoundations of mathematics in general. So much for inconsistency! (See\n supplement D\n for a description of the \u03bb-calculus).\n\nIn the second paper (Church 1933), the problem about Russell\u2019s\nparadox was corrected. But Kleene and Rosser (1935) established that\nboth systems\u2014those of Church 1932 and 1933\u2014as well as\nrelated early systems of combinatory logic fell prey to\nRichard\u2019s paradox. The mere part\u2014the pure untyped\n\u03bb-calculus\u2014is, however, consistent in the sense that not\nall equations between \u03bb terms are derivable. This follows from\nan early result due to Church himself and Rosser (1936)\u2014the\nChurch-Rosser theorem (see the entry on the\n lambda calculus\n for discussion). Significant mathematical models for the\n\u03bb-calculus were developed later (Scott and Strachey 1971;\nPlotkin 1993; see Hindley & Seldin 2008: ch. 16). Church also\nproved the consistency of a variant of the system of (1933) by\nelementary means (1934), thus escaping, as he hoped, the\nincompleteness theorems of G\u00f6del (1931). But this system was too\nweak to satisfy requirement (2), and Church abandoned the system. (A\ntype-free system with a similar motivation was proposed later by\nMyhill 1975.) It is remarkable that in his failed struggle to produce\na consistent, type-free foundational system, Church nevertheless\nintroduced ideas that have profoundly affected the development of\nlogic.\n5.2 Type-theoretic vs. Set-theoretic Foundations\n\nIn 1940 Church turned away from a type-free approach and published a\nversion of STT that incorporated \u03bb-abstraction (see\n supplement D).\n Although Church had developed what became the most useful and famous\nversion of STT (1940), he thought that it was not enough to meet\ncondition (1), since he thought that STT when augmented with a\nsemantical predicate was vulnerable to the semantical paradoxes such\nas the Epimenides and Grelling\u2019s paradox (cf.\n section 4\n above). To avoid these he thought it necessary to appeal to RTT (with\nreducibility).\n\nRegarding condition (2), STT with axioms of infinity and choice\npermits the full development of classical number theory and analysis.\nChurch (1959 [BE: 493]) notes that STT with an axiom of infinity and\nZermelo set theory (Z) are of \u201ccomparable\u201d provability\nstrength but that Z is slightly stronger. (Indeed, the first detailed\nproof that Z is stronger than STT with infinity is given in a thesis\nwritten under Church\u2019s supervision by Kemeny (1949). It is now\nknown that STT with an axiom of infinity is equi-consistent with and\nhas as much provability strength as bounded Zermelo set\ntheory (see Farmer 2008 and the citations therein). Moreover,\nChurch\u2019s STT has turned out to be an important tool in the\ninvestigation of automated reasoning and proof verification in\ncomputer science. The typed system with \u03bb is particularly well\nsuited for the use and development of programming languages and\nparadigms (such as Haskell and Functional Programming [Hudak 1989]).\nThus, Church succeeded in providing a type theoretical alternative to\nset theory as a foundation for mathematics. (It\u2019s also worth\nmentioning that through his work on finite automata, Church\ncontributed in yet another fundamental way to computer science [1960,\n1962a].)\n\nHowever, for the most part, at this point, Church focused on the\ndevelopment of intensional logic in the form of LSD (see\n \u00a73)\n and on condition (1)\u2014viz. the problem of semantical\nparadox. In his 1976, his aim is clearly to communicate the resolution\nvia RTT of the semantical paradoxes:\n\n\nTo avoid impredicativity the essential restriction is that\nquantification over any domain (type) must not be allowed to add new\nmembers to the domain, as it is held that adding new members changes\nthe meaning of quantification over the domain in such a way that a\nvicious circle results. (1976 [BE: 794]).\n\n\nGiven the rest of 1976, it is natural to view Church as defending\nRussell\u2019s diagnosis of the paradoxes. (This contrasts with\nChurch\u2019s early view that RTT embodies an \u201cad hoc\u201d\nresolution; see the quotes at the beginning of this section.)\nChurch\u2019s final position seems to have been, then, that both RTT\nand Russell\u2019s rationale for it are correct.\n\nAs for the axioms of reducibility, Church\u2019s view was that the\naxioms only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions and that\nintensional notions remain unaffected: \u201cThus the\nrejection of impredicative definition is annulled in extensional but\nnot in intensional matters\u201d. In this way, RTT with the axioms of\nreducibility permits the full development of classical number theory\nand analysis and blocks the semantical paradoxes. This is a view\nshared by Kripke (2011b) and Myhill (1979).\n\nChurch\u2019s published remarks on set theory are scattered,\nrelatively brief and stop short of full endorsement. However, his\noverall attitude towards set theory was accepting and conciliatory,\nalthough he was skeptical of some of its axioms, including separation\nand choice. His doctoral dissertation (under Veblen) was on\n\u201cAlternatives to Zermelo\u2019s Assumption\u201d\n(1927)\u2014namely, the axiom of choice. He viewed Zermelo\u2019s\naxiomatization of set theory as \u201ctransferring\u201d the\nconcepts of class and class membership from the \u201c(unformalized)\nlogical level\u201d to the \u201c(formalized) mathematical\nlevel\u201d, but viewed the improvements due to von Neumann, Fraenkel\nand Skolem as bringing it continually closer to (formalized) logic, so\nthat\n\n\nit is now possible to formulate the theory as a system of symbolic\nlogic in the same sense as the system of Principia. (1939b\n[BE: 156])\n\n\nThese improvements brought with them an emphasis on formalization\n(such as Skolem\u2019s isolation of first order logic) and that was\nfor Church a sign that logic was being done; although he no doubt\nmodified his view as the distinction between logic and proper theory\nbecame pronounced. Later on, Church himself contributed again to set\ntheory. His paper on set theory with a universal set shows great\ningenuity in the analysis of a route to a consistent set theory\n(consistent relative to ZF) with a universal set (1974c). But he did\nnot think that set theory could handle intensional notions, despite\nthe success of set theoretic model theory for modal logic. For a\ntreatment of intensional notions he continued to look to RTT.\n5.3 Logicism and Intuitionism\n\nChurch (1962b) distinguished sharply between which systems provide\nfoundations for \u201cthe whole of presently extant\nmathematics\u201d and which ones provide \u201can economical\nbasis\u201d for particular branches such as arithmetic.\nChurch\u2019s view was that while the study of logicism had led to\nthe discovery of type theory and so to the discovery of adequate\nfoundations for the whole of extant mathematics (see\n \u00a75.2),\n it did not succeed in putting arithmetic on the most\neconomical basis possible (for reasons explained, in\n supplement D\n on TT). Moreover:\n\n\nA more satisfactorily economical basis for elementary arithmetic is\nprovided either by one of the standard formulations of first-order\narithmetic employing primitive notations special to arithmetic and\nspecial arithmetic postulates, or by a weak set theory which is\nadequate for the treatments of finite sets but omits all the standard\nset-theoretic axioms that are not needed for this purpose (including\nthe axiom of infinity). (1962b [BE: 611])\n\n\nFor example, elementary arithmetic can be represented in the universe\nof hereditarily finite sets (HF), without the axiom of infinity (for\ndiscussion and history see C. Parsons 1987, 2007).\n\nAs for intuitionism, early on Church rejected Brouwer\u2019s view\nthat in mathematics the truth of a proposition is identical with the\npossibility of proving the proposition, because\n\n\nit seems more in accord with our usual ideas to think of truth as a\nproperty of a proposition independent of our ability to prove it.\n(1928a [BE: 44])\n\n\nBut he welcomed Heyting\u2019s formalization of intuitionism as\nproviding needed clarification. Later in a discussion of\nintuitionistic objections to logicism, he pointed out that\nHeyting\u2019s work was a concession to the method of logistic\ncharacteristic of logic, and hence in tension with Brouwer\u2019s\nview that mathematics is prior to logic (1962b [BE: 611]). The point\nis a powerful one. Even those seeking to replace, for example,\nKripke\u2019s proof within classical logic of the completeness of\nintuitionistic propositional calculus, with an intuitionistically\nacceptable argument, have had to use the logistic method in their\ninvestigation.\n5.4. The Significance of G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorems and the Continuum Problem\n\nChurch was acutely conscious of the effect on the question of\nfoundations of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems. His early\nattitude was that they were \u201cunpleasant\u201d results to be\ncircumvented, if at all possible (1934). His work in this direction is\nrelated to Alan Turing\u2019s work on \u201cordinal logics\u201d in\nhis Princeton doctoral thesis completed under Church\u2019s direction\n(see Turing\u2019s [1939] paper and Feferman [1995]). Turing\u2019s\nidea, encouraged by Church, was to extend an incomplete system by\nadding to it the sentences unprovable in it and iterating this\noperation into the transfinite. However, the iteration must be\neffective and involve only ordinals that are constructive in the sense\ndefined and studied earlier by Church (1938) and Kleene (1938). This\nidea is still being investigated today.\n\nChurch also noted that while the pure \u03bb-calculus escapes\nG\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem, this is only in\nvirtue of its lack of provability strength, and so:\n\n\nThe sense in which it escapes the G\u00f6del theorem is not\nsignificant from the point of view of logic as a foundation of\nmathematics. (1984 [BE: 829])\n\n\nOn the other hand, he also noted that for any sufficiently strong\nformalized language, such as STT with the axiom of infinity,\n\n\nno proof of consistency\u2026 is known, except by methods involving\nassumptions so strong as to destroy any major significance. (1959 [BE:\n488])\n\n\nMoreover, he was aware that the incompleteness theorems are a price\nthat has to be paid for communicating and verifying proofs in a\nsufficiently strong formalized language that also meets his\nrequirement of effectiveness (discussed in\n \u00a72).\n The theorems, their significance for Hilbert\u2019s program, their\nrelation to effectiveness, and their relation to Tarski\u2019s work\nare discussed in some detail in chapter VIII of Church\u2019s\ntextbook on mathematical logic (1968/1972/1976; printed in BE). Here\nChurch also acknowledged the value of Gentzen\u2019s and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s consistency proofs, but apparently did not think\ntheir significance was \u201cmajor\u201d. A finitary consistency\nproof in the sense of Hilbert was desirable but impossible.\n\nElsewhere, Church comments that:\n\n\nThe feeling that there is an absolute realm of sets, somehow\ndetermined in spite of the non-existence of a complete axiomatic\ncharacterization, receives more of a blow from the solution (better,\nthe unsolving) of the continuum problem than from the famous\nG\u00f6del incompleteness theorems. It is not a question of\nrealism\u2026 versus either conceptualism or nominalism, but if one\nchooses realism, whether there can be a \u201cgenetic\u201d realism\nwithout axiomatic specification. (1966 [BE: 677]).\n\n\nWhile Church may have wished to postulate an absolute realm of sets,\njust as he postulated such a realm of senses, in neither case was he\nhappy to affirm the existence of such entities without first\nformulating an axiomatic theory of them and then evaluating it for\ntruth (see\n section 6).\n The independence from the axioms of ZFC of a natural set-theoretic\nquestion like that of the cardinality of the continuum showed that\nChurch\u2019s strictures could not be met without the discovery of\nanother axiom. Absent this discovery, Church hesitated to postulate an\nabsolute realm of sets and even noted the possibility of set-theoretic\nrelativism: that there could be \u201crival set theories\u201d and\nthat sets \u201chave their reality only relative to and within a\ncertain theory\u201d (1966 [BE: 677]).\n6. Metaphysics\n6.1 Metaphysics and the Logistic Method\n\nChurch\u2019s mature view was that discussion of metaphysical\ndoctrines is only worthwhile if they can be reformulated and developed\nusing the logistic method. For example, he thought that the question\nof the legitimacy of the distinction between form and matter should be\ninvestigated by setting up a formal language, which is used to isolate\nthe form of a proposition as well as of the corresponding sentence, so\nthat one can reinterpret its non-logical vocabulary and study what is\ncommon under various reinterpretations: \u201cthis may be considered\na more precise formulation of the traditional distinction between form\nand matter\u201d (1956a [BE: 372\u20133 and 379]; 1956\u201372 [BE:\n697]; 1959 [BE: 415, 475]).\n\nAnother question that receives such a reformulation is that of the\nexistence of abstract entities, which, according to Church, are\n\u201cpostulated\u201d as ontological commitments of a true sentence\nor theory that has been developed in accordance with the strictures of\nthe logistic method. The basic idea is that theory \\(T\\) is\nontologically committed to entities of kind \\(K\\) if the truth of\n\\(T\\) implies that there are \\(K\\)s (1958a). Moreover, as Church\nclarified later, \u201ctheory\u201d was intended to encompass not\nonly formal theories but also\n\n\nsystems of notions which arose long before scientific method came to\nbe consciously used and which have therefore become embedded matters\nof \u201ccommon sense\u201d in the natural languages (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nThis would suggest that numbers were postulated when notations for\nthem first entered human culture\u2014long before the advent of\nmodern science and the discovery of the logistic method. (For an\nexample of how natural numbers have become embedded in natural\nlanguage, see the discussion of \u201cdescendant\u201d in\n supplement D.)\n Presumably, however, according to the logistic method, such notations\nmust ultimately be included in a formalized object language to which\nthe criterion of ontological commitment is then applied. Further,\ngiven this commitment:\n\n\nIf [the philosopher] maintains, for example, that numbers do not exist\nbut nevertheless asserts, or is persuaded to admit, \u201c1729 is the\nsum of two cubes in more than one way\u201d, he is, at least\nprima facie, involved in contradiction, because by naming the\nnumber 1729 and attributing a property to it he seems to be committed\nto the existence of at least this one number. (1958a [BE: 438])\n\n\nMore generally,\n\n\nthose philosophers who speak of \u201cexistence\u201d,\n\u201creality\u201d, and the like are to be understood as meaning\nthe existential quantifier, and are to be condemned as inconsistent if\non this basis inconsistency appears in their writings. The\njustification is that no other reasonable meaning of\n\u201cexistence\u201d has ever been provided (which would fit into\ncontexts of the kind that were quoted), and the burden of providing\nsuch a second meaning of \u201cexistence\u201d rests on those whose\nwritings or whose philosophical views require it. (1958a [BE:\n442]).\n\n\nRecently, Jody Azzouni (2004, 2010) has attempted to shoulder this\nburden. For discussion of nominalism and Church\u2019s criterion see\nChurch (1958a,b), Burgess (2001) as well as Salm\u00f3n (2020).\n6.2 Church\u2019s Modest Realism\n\nChurch was at pains to distinguish his preferred brand of realism from\nPlatonism (1973a [BE: 748]). Moreover, he was also clear that his\nrealism was not\n\n\neven the extreme realism of Frege and G\u00f6del, but rather only in\nopposition to the claim of superior reality for physical or\nspatio-temporal entities. (1951b, fn. Added 1971 [BE: 287])\n\n\nTo show the contrast with Frege, Church stated that while his own view\nis that the two truth values are \u201cpostulated\u201d:\n\n\nTo Frege, as a thoroughgoing Platonic realist, our use of the word\n\u201cpostulate\u201d here would not be acceptable. (1956a:\n\u00a74)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s position, according to Church, is that \u201cthere\nare two such things as truth and falsehood\u201d (1956a:\n\u00a74). Of course, it also follows from Church\u2019s semantic\ntheory together with his criterion of ontological commitment that\nthere are two such things as truth and falsehood. What, then,\nis the disagreement with Frege? It appears to be that because Church\npostulated the two truth values relative to a logistic theory, and\nbecause he did not claim to have demonstrated conclusively the truth\nof one such theory, he still saw room for consideration of competing\nlogistic theories, and so competing ontologies, which do not postulate\ntruth values as objects (cf. 1966).\n\nNevertheless, according to Church, theories that are effectively\nspecifiable (cf. 2.3) can be communicated, inspected, compared with\neach other and with observational data\u2014as well as evaluated for\ntruth by other rational, checkable procedures. So there is no\nprincipled reason (other than Church\u2019s Theorem) why,\nafter rational debate has come to an end, we could not assert the\ntruth of our theory and postulate the existence of its ontological\ncommitments with near certainty. (Of course, in some cases the theory\nmay be underdetermined by the data; and in the case of set theory\nthere may be genuine theory relativity; cf.\n \u00a75.4.)\n\nReturning to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of superior\nreality for physical or spatio-temporal entities\u201d, his reason\nwas that spatio-temporal entities are, like abstract entities,\npostulated ontological commitments of theories. For this reason,\nterminology for spatio-temporal entities does not\n\u201cbelong to the vocabulary in which the observational data are\nstated;\u201d rather they are theoretical constructs the terminology\nfor which \u201cbelongs to a theoretical language\u201d (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]; cf. 1975 [BE: 983\u20134].)\n\nComplementary to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of\nsuperior reality for spatio-temporal entities\u201d was his view that\nabstract entities\u2014assuming they exist\u2014are no more remote\nfrom causal explanations than are spatio-temporal ones. To Carnap, who\nclaimed that abstracts entities may be avoided in causal explanations\nof phenomena (1963), Church responded by claiming\n\n\nthe cause of an event is never a physical object or even another event\nbut a total situation, in the description of which many entities, both\nabstract and concrete, must in general be mentioned (1951b, fn. Added\n1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nMoreover, Church added that if we assume that the objects of\nlinguistic understanding and (other) propositional attitudes are\npropositions (cf.\n \u00a73.3\n and\n \u00a76.3),\n then propositions are also an essential part of any adequate causal\nexplanation of behavior.\n\nGiven all this, it is not surprising that Church did not see a\nspecial problem about our epistemological access to concepts\nand propositions:\n\n\nBut the preference of (say) seeing over understanding as a method of\nobservation seems to me capricious. For just as an opaque body may be\nseen, so a concept may be understood or grasped. And the parallel\nbetween the two cases is indeed rather close. In both cases the\nobservation is not direct but through intermediaries\u2014light, lens\nof eye or optical instrument, and retina in the case of visible body,\nlinguistic expressions in the case of the concept. And in both cases\nthere are or may be tenable theories according to which the entity in\nquestion, opaque body or concept, is not assumed, but only those\nthings which would otherwise be called its effects. (1951b [BE:\n287])\n\n\nIt should be emphasized that Church\u2019s realism about propositions\nis not supposed to follow from their role in causal explanations but\nfrom his view that no logistic theory that is both true and humanly\nunderstandable can do without them. It is to this that we now\nturn.\n6.3 Realism about Propositions\n\nThe notion of proposition that Church argued must be\npostulated by semantics is the \u201cabstract notion\u201d:\n\n\nindependent alike of any particular expression in words and of any\nparticular psychological act of judgment or conception\u2014not the\nparticular declarative sentence, but the content or meaning which is\ncommon to the sentence and its translation into another\nlanguage\u2014not the particular judgment, but the objective content\nof the judgment, which is capable of being the common property of\nmany. (1956\u201372 [BE: 742])\n\n\nChurch credited Leibniz with an important argument that goes some way\nto establishing the need for this notion in semantics. The argument,\nas reported by Church (1956b), is as follows:\n\nTruth cannot attach to actual particular thoughts\n(cogitationes) or particular acts of judgment, since what is\nthought or judged by no one may nevertheless be true. Perhaps, then,\ntruth attaches to things (res) rather than particular\nthoughts. However, falsehood cannot attach to things, only to\nthoughts. In which case, if truth attaches to things and falsehood\nattaches to thoughts, then we cannot say that the same subject might\nbe true or false. Leibniz\u2019s way out, as reported by Church, is\nthat truth and falsehood attach to possible thoughts. This is\nthe notion that Church considered an important step towards the\nabstract notion of a proposition.\n\nChurch (1956b) noted that instead of making the final step from\npossible thoughts to propositions, we might claim that truth and\nfalsehood attach to possible sentences of some\nlanguage\u2014those that the syntactical rules of the language allow\nas well formed. He added that this move won\u2019t serve the\nnominalist like Goodman\u2014who denies propositions because they are\nabstract\u2014since the move also invokes abstract types. Further,\nand for the reasons discussed in\n \u00a73.3,\n if we abandon nominalism but continue to limit our ontology to\npossible sentences, then our semantic theory will provide a false\nanalysis of attributions of assertion and belief.\n\nChurch (1956b) also considered rejecting the first line of argument\nand insisting that truth and falsehood do attach only to\nactual particular thoughts or sentences. In that case, he argued, we\nwould be limited to those things that we could actually think or say\nin a reasonable amount of time. In which case, there would no longer\nbe a distinction between statements that are unproved because of human\nlimitations and those that are unprovable as a matter of\nmathematical necessity.\n\nMoreover, Church pointed out that those who are willing to accept\nthese limitations must, at the very best, face an excessively\ncomplicated theory of syntax and semantics (one that, for example,\nwould have to be formulated without the notion of an infinite\nsequence):\n\n\nIndeed the justification would seem to be basically the same for\nextended physical objects in macrophysical theory and for ideal\nsentences in logical syntax: both are postulated entities\u2014some\nmay prefer to say inferred entities\u2014without which the theory\nwould be intolerably complex if not impossible. (1956b [BE:\n359\u201360])\n\n\nReturning to Leibniz\u2019s dialogue, Church pointed out that it\ncontained an important assumption about logical form (which Church\naccepted): that there is some thing\u2014whether a thought\nor another kind of thing\u2014that is the logical subject of\nattributions of truth and falsehood as well as the logical object of\nattributions of assertion and belief, including attributions\ncontaining bound variables such as \u201cthere is something that\nChurch asserts and Goodman denies\u201d. Church was scathingly\ncritical of those (like Goodman) who denied this assumption without\nalso providing, in sufficient detail, their own corresponding analyses\nof attributions of assertion and belief. Church (1956b; 1973) noted\nthat Scheffler (1954) was almost alone in offering such an analysis\nand defended the assumption by submitting Scheffler\u2019s proposal\nto extensive criticism. Especially puzzling to Church was\nScheffler\u2019s willingness to admit that there is a philosophical\nproblem about the existence of physical objects while also insisting,\nwithout argument, that there is a problem about the existence of\npropositions and sentence types that is different in kind.\n\nIn sum, Church\u2019s argument for the existence of propositions is\nas follows. (1) Actual thought or sentence tokens, as well as possible\nsentences, are insufficient for semantics to be a true and humanly\nunderstandable theory. Rather, (2) propositions are also needed.\nFurther, by Church\u2019s criterion of ontological commitment, (3) if\nentities of kind \\(K\\) are entailed by a true theory, then there exist\nentities of kind \\(K\\). So, (4) there exist propositions. Church\n(1952, 1958a) chides Ayer and Ryle for not taking this last step, that\nis for inadvertently committing themselves to propositions while\ntalking about propositional attitudes but denying their existence\nwhile talking explicitly about propositions as theoretical\ncommitments.\n\nRegarding the second premise, it remains to be shown that we need to\ntake the step from the notion of a possible\nthought\u2014which is abstracted from the notion of a possible\nmind that is capable of error and so of thinking something\nfalse\u2014to the notion of an abstract proposition. Church\nattributed the discovery of the latter notion to both Bolzano and\nFrege (Church 1943a; 1956a,b). However, Church did not endorse\nBolzano\u2019s arguments so much as his conclusion. (For the\nargument, see\n \u00a73.3 of the entry on Bolzano.)\n And as for Frege, Church simply reiterated his remarks about the\nobjectivity, mind and language independence, and publicity of\nGedanke, without telling us exactly why possible thoughts are\nnot also objective, mind-and-language-independent, abstract and\npublic. Perhaps the issue is that the existence of possible thoughts\ndepends on the existence of possible minds, whereas propositions, such\nas that two and two are four, do not depend on the existence\nof possible minds, since, intuitively, they would be true if there\nwere no minds at all. Arguably, then, the notion of an abstract\nproposition must be postulated by and so is an ontological commitment\nof a theory that can explain the foregoing intuition.\n",
