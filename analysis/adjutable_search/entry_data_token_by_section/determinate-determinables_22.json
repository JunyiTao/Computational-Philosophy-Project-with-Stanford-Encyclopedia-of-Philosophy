    "main_text": "Applications || The problem of mental/higher-level causation\n5.3 Metaphysical indeterminacy\n\nMany phenomena appear to be indeterminate: macro-objects (clouds,\nmountains) appear to have imprecise boundaries; the future, it seems,\nmight be genuinely open; on many interpretations of quantum mechanics,\nsome properties of a system (e.g., position and momentum, orthogonal\nspin components) cannot jointly have precise values. In these and\nother cases there are reasons to think that the indeterminacy is\nmetaphysical, as opposed to merely semantic or epistemic. Elder (1996)\nsuggests that determinables might be useful for purposes of making\nsense of \u201cthe idea that corresponding to (at least some) vague\npredicates there really are, in the world, vague properties\u201d\n(1996: 150). Wilson (2013) more specifically argues that determinables\nand determinates provide the basis for an attractive account of\nmetaphysical indeterminacy\n (MI),[48]\n as follows:\n\n\nDeterminable-based MI: For a state of affairs to be\nmetaphysically indeterminate in a given respect \\(R\\) at a time \\(t\\)\nis for the state of affairs to constitutively involve an object\n(entity) \\(O\\) such that (i) \\(O\\) has a determinable property \\(P\\)\nat \\(t\\), and (ii) for some level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(P\\),\n\\(O\\) does not have a unique level-\\(L\\) determinate of \\(P\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\n\nOne application of Determinable-based MI is to macro-object\nboundary MI; here the conditions are satisfied in \u2018glutty\u2019\nfashion, reflecting that macro-objects typically have multiple\noverlapping realizers, as with Mount Everest and the multiple\noverlapping aggregates of rock in its vicinity at any given time. On\nthe suggested approach, Mount Everest has a determinable boundary\nproperty, but no unique determinate boundary property, since there are\ntoo many candidate determinates of the determinable, associated with\nthe comparatively precise boundaries of its realizing aggregates, to\nnon-arbitrarily pick out any one as the \u2018unique\u2019\ndeterminate boundary had by the mountain. At best, these determinate\nboundaries can be attributed to Mount Everest in relativized (or\ndegree-theoretic)\n fashion.[49]\n That ordinary objects typically have metaphysically indeterminate\nboundaries provides, in combination with a determinable-based account\nof realization\n see \u00a75.2,\n the basis for an argument that such objects are emergent\u2014that\nis, distinct from and distinctively efficacious as compared to the\nlower-level configurations upon which they cotemporally depend (see\nWilson 2021, Ch. 6). Another application is to open future MI: here\nthe conditions may be satisfied in \u2018gappy\u2019 fashion,\nreflecting that, while there might be present grounds for the future\ninstancing of a given determinable (say, being an outcome of a sea\nbattle) there may be no present grounds for the future instancing\nof any specific determinate of that determinable.\n\nDeterminable-based MI is also usefully applied to cases of\nvalue indeterminacy on (various interpretations of) quantum mechanics,\nassociated with superpositions, incompatible observables, and\nentangled states. Darby (2010) and Skow (2010) argue that metaphysical\nsupervaluationist accounts of MI (see Akiba 2004, Barnes 2010, and\nBarnes and Williams 2011) cannot accommodate quantum MI on the\northodox interpretation, for on these accounts MI is effectively a\nmatter of primitive unsettledness about which maximally precise world\nor state of affairs obtains; but such an approach cannot model quantum\nMI, since the Kochen-Specker theorem rules out simultaneously\nassigning definite values to all properties of a quantum system.\nCalosi and Wilson (2019 and forthcoming) defend this result against\ncertain objections, and extend the concern with supervaluationist\naccounts to cases of MI on the GRW and Everettian interpretations,\nassociated with GRW\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 problem (see Lewis\n2016) and ineradicable incompatible observable MI within Everettian\nbranches (see A. Wilson 2020), respectively.\n\nBy way of contrast, Determinable-based MI is compatible with\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem, and more generally, with insuperable or\n(as Skow puts it) any \u2018deep\u2019 quantum MI associated with\nquantum phenomena. Whether individual such cases are best treated in\ngappy or glutty determinable-based terms remains controversial.\nBokulich (2014) and Wolff (2015) see a gappy implementation as most\npromising for the target case of spin value indeterminacy; as Wolff\nobserves:\n\n\nPermitting the instantiation of determinables without determinates\nhelps to describe this phenomenon, because we can say that \\(x\\)-spin\nand \\(y\\)-spin are determinables with two determinates each, and\n[after a spin-\\(z\\) measurement] neither of these determinates is\ninstantiated even though the determinables \u201cspin-\\(x\\)\u201d\nand \u201cspin-\\(y\\)\u201d are. (2015:\n 385)[50]\n\n\n(See also Schroeren 2021.) However, a glutty implementation has\ncertain advantages, including being able to preserve information\nassociated with coefficients of components states in a superposition.\nCalosi and Wilson (2021) advance a glutty implementation as providing\nthe basis for an intelligible explanation of the distinctive\ninterference patterns characteristic of the double-slit experiment,\nreflecting that a single particle in the experiment can (in\nrelativized or degree-theoretic fashion) go through both slits in such\na way as to be able to interfere with itself (as per Dirac\u2019s\noriginal suggestion).\n\nThat said, whether the value indeterminacy on (available readings of)\navailable interpretations of quantum mechanics should be understood in\nmetaphysical terms, and if so, whether it should be treated in\ndeterminable-based terms (or relatedly, whether a supervaluationist\napproach can be fixed up so as to do the job), remains an area of\nactive\n research.[51]\n The debate continues; still, here and in other cases of seeming MI\nthere is a case to be made that our experiential and theoretical\nfamiliarity with determinables goes at least some distance towards\nrendering MI intelligible\u2014offering, along the way, a nice\ncase-in-point of how determinables may be useful for purposes of\nilluminating the structure of natural reality.\n",
