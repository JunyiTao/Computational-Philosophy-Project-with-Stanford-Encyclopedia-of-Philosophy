Doctrine and mundane experience\n\nWe have been exploring various ways in which the phenomenology of\nreligious experience may be construed, in affective and other terms.\nIt is reasonable to suppose, in addition, that the quality of the\nbeliever\u2019s strictly mundane experience will be in some respects\nconditioned by their religious commitments, or will need to show some\nsort of consonance with those commitments.\n\nFor instance, the emotions may be religiously important even if they\nare not bound up with an experience of God or a sacred space, because\nof their role in signalling that certain matters are properly the\nobject of attention. Evolutionary accounts of emotional experience\ncommonly emphasise the significance of the emotions in constituting\npatterns of salience. For instance, it is obviously of adaptive value\nif a large, fast-approaching dog is afforded a certain salience in my\nperceptual field, while the colour of the linoleum floor on which I am\nstanding is consigned to the periphery of my awareness. And in\nstandard cases, to feel fear of a dog is, in part, to view the\nrelevant scene with such salience. (Compare Oatley and Jenkins, 1996.)\nHere, emotional responses help to frame rational thought, by\ndetermining what it is appropriate to attend to and in turn to reason\nabout. And, arguably, similar connections hold in religious\ncontexts.\n\nFor instance, speaking of revelation, John Henry Newman comments:\n\nThat earnest desire of it, which religious minds cherish, leads the\nway to the expectation of it. Those who know nothing of the wounds of\nthe soul, are not led to deal with the question, or to consider its\ncircumstances; but when our attention is roused, then the more\nsteadily we dwell upon it, the more probable does it seem that a\nrevelation has been or will be given to us. (1979, p. 328)\n\n\nIn this way, a person\u2019s emotional experience can mark out\ncertain matters as deserving of closer attention, and thereby this\nexperience can prepare the way for a deepening of religious\nunderstanding. Here, the phenomenology of the experience has, once\nagain, a crucial part to play in constituting the relevant pattern of\nsalience. But in this case, the experience is not directly or\nindirectly of God, but in the first instance of the condition of\none\u2019s soul. William James takes a similar line when he says of\n\u201cdogmatic or idealistic theology\u201d that \u201cthese\nspeculations must \u2026 be classed as over-beliefs, buildings-out\nperformed by the intellect into directions of which feelings\noriginally supplied the hint,\u201d giving as an example of such\nfeelings \u201cinner unhappiness and the need of deliverance\u201d\n(1902, p. 431). (For the importance of emotional responses in framing\nrational thought, see also Damasio 1995, pp. 193\u2013194.)\n\nThis example is a matter of moving from a way of experiencing the\nworld to a doctrinal commitment. We might suppose that it is also\npossible to move in the other direction, since doctrinal commitments\nmay carry implications for how the world is to be experienced in\nsubjective terms. Nicholas Wolterstorff notes, for example, how this\nworld\n\nrepresents a success on the part of God \u2014 God who is love\n\u2014 not a failure. In contemplation of what He had made God found\ndelight. But also God knew that what He had made would serve well his\nhuman creatures. So God pronounced His \u2018Yes\u2019 upon it all,\na \u2018Yes\u2019 of delight and of love. You and I must do no less.\n(1980, p. 69)\n\n\nFollowing this suggestion, we should suppose that the doctrine of\ncreation implies a correlative affectively toned phenomenology, one\nwhich is open to taking delight in the world, in its materiality.\n\nReports of conversion experience provide a particularly striking\nexample of how religious commitments may be connected to experience of\nthe everyday world. It is notable that such reports commonly testify\nnot simply to the convert\u2019s new-found closeness to God, in\nprayer for example, but to a generalized shift in the appearance of\nthe physical world. For instance, William James notes how:\n\nWhen we come to study the phenomenon of conversion or religious\nregeneration, we \u2026 see that a not infrequent consequence of the\nchange operated in the subject is a transfiguration of the face of\nnature in his eyes. A new heaven seems to shine on a new earth. (1902,\np. 141)\n\n\nAs one of James\u2019s sources remarks: \u201cNatural objects were\nglorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in\nevery material object in the universe\u2026\u201d (1902, p. 250). Here,\nfollowing conversion, the natural world appears brighter or more\nvivid, so that it seems to be newly transparent to the divine glory.\n(For another account of how a whole domain of experience may take on a\nparticular subjective character and significance, see Cooper 2002 on\n\u201cexistential\u201d experience, p. 340.)\n\nThere are various ways of understanding the significance of this sort\nof shift in the world\u2019s appearance. One potentially helpful\ncategory is Matthew Ratcliffe\u2019s notion of \u201cexistential\nfeelings.\u201d Ratcliffe introduces the category in these terms:\n\nFirst of all, they [existential feelings] are not directed at specific\nobjects or situations but are background orientations through which\nexperience as a whole is structured. Second, they are bodily\nfeelings. (2008, p. 38, Ratcliffe\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs an analogy (or perhaps more than an analogy) we could take the case\nof jet lag. When I am in a jet lagged state, the world in general can\nappear differently to me, and this is in part, no doubt, because of\nthe associated change in my bodily condition. I may feel groggy (here\nis the bodily feeling to which Ratcliffe refers), and at the same time\nthe world in general may take on a new appearance, so that it seems,\nfor instance, out of focus. And we might speculate that, similarly,\nthe convert has undergone a change in bodily condition, and that it is\nthis change that accounts both for their feelings of elation, and also\nfor the shift that they report in the world\u2019s appearance. It may\nbe that, in some cases, whether by design or not, this bodily change\nis the product of a spiritual discipline. So here is another way in\nwhich feelings, including feelings of bodily condition, may be caught\nup into the phenomenology of the religious or spiritual life.\n\nWe may wonder what phenomenological categories to use for the\ndescription of this sort of experience, whereby the world in general\nappears brighter and newly vivid. It may be that the category of\nsalience is, once again, of some help here. James notes how in the\nexperience of the depressed person, the world can appear\n\u201cflat.\u201d And this is what we should expect: in central\ncases, the person who is depressed is suffering from a lack of\nemotional engagement with the world, and in turn, therefore, from a\nblunted sense of the differentiated significance of things, so that\nthe patterns of salience that normally inform the perceptual field are\nflattened out. Hence James writes of Tolstoy\u2019s experience of a\nperiod of existential crisis that: \u201cLife had been enchanting. It\nwas now flat sober, more than sober, dead\u201d (1902, p. 152). And\nspeaking more generally he comments that:\n\nThe old man, sick with an insidious internal disease, may laugh and\nquaff his wine at first as well as ever, but he knows his fate now,\nfor the doctors have revealed it; and the knowledge knocks the\nsatisfaction out of all these functions. They are partners of death\nand the worm is their brother, and they turn to a mere flatness. The\nlustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the background of\npossibilities it goes with. (1902, p. 141)\n\n\nHere again, we are concerned with a generalized shift in the\nappearance of the world, but in this example, the change is evidently\ninduced not simply by a change in bodily condition, though that may be\npart of the story, but by the person\u2019s new assessment of their\ncircumstances. This case too is religiously suggestive, since the\nreligions standardly offer, of course, far-reaching diagnoses of our\npresent circumstances and our prospects. So perhaps, in some cases,\nconversion experience is a matter of the person coming to subscribe to\na new conception of their circumstances, of this far-reaching variety,\nand acquiring thereby a new sense of their \u201cbackground of\npossibilities,\u201d with the result that their experience of the\neveryday world is then renewed.\n\nSo salience is one category that is relevant to the description of the\nchange in the appearance of the everyday world that is commonly\nassociated with conversion. In brief, before conversion, the world may\nappear relatively \u201cflat,\u201d and after it may be that objects\nare more clearly delineated relative to one another, so that they\nstand out in the perceptual field, where this standing out records the\nperson\u2019s new appreciation of their significance in themselves\nand relative to one another. It it notable that James\u2019s converts\nseem to be talking not only about a deepening of patterns of salience\nin the perceptual field, but also of the world appearing brighter or\nmore vivid, where this change seems to imply a change in the\n\u201ccolouring,\u201d and not simply in the structure, of the\nperceptual field. An example will help us to pin down this further\ndimension of the change that converts seem to be describing.\n\nSuppose that I am chewing some meat that, unknown to me, derives from\nShuttlecock, the pet rabbit. And suppose that I am now told that the\nmeat does indeed derive from Shuttlecock. In these circumstances\n\u2013 granted standard assumptions \u2013 the meat will, of course,\nbecome newly salient for me: I will now be focally aware of it. But\nthat is not all that will happen. The meat will also change in its\nintrinsic phenomenal feel: it will now be experienced as disgusting.\nWe can call this second element of the change in the appearance of the\nmeat a change in \u201chue.\u201d Commonly, changes in salience and\nin hue will arise together: if an object acquires a new hue, for\nexample, then it is natural to suppose that it will stand out relative\nto other objects in a new way. But as the example of Shuttlecock\nindicates, these changes are conceptually distinguishable. And we\nmight suppose, then, that James\u2019s converts are reporting not\nonly a change in salience, but also a change in hue: the perceptual\nfield is now more boldly contoured, and it is at the same time\nbrighter or more vivid than before conversion.\n\nSo far in this section, we have been interested in the correlation\nbetween mundane experience and religious teaching, where this\ncorrelation is \u201cexternal\u201d: that is, it is a matter of the\ndoctrine upholding some idea about the nature of the world \u2013 for\ninstance, the idea that the world as created is good \u2013 and the\nappearance of the world then conforming to that idea, by virtue of,\nsay, the patterns of salience that are inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, and the colouring or \u201chue\u201d of the world as\nexperienced. And as we have seen, we can understand these shifts in\nthe appearance of the world as, fundamentally, the product of changes\nin bodily condition, or as shaped by way of religious teaching about\nhuman beings\u2019 \u201cbackground of possibilities.\u201d But\nanother case is also possible: here, the religious teaching enters\ninto the appearance of the world. Something like this case is perhaps\nimplied in Jonathan Edwards\u2019 report of his religious conversion,\nwhich is also recorded by William James. Edwards writes:\n\nThe appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be, as it\nwere, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost\neverything. God\u2019s excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love,\nseemed to appear in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the\nclouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water\nand all nature; which used greatly to fix my mind. (1902, pp.\n248\u20139)\n\n\nIn this report, it is not simply that things look different following,\nor in the course of, conversion, but the divine nature is now somehow\nmade manifest in the appearance of the world. This sort of report at\nleast raises the possibility, however puzzling it may be, that\nconcepts of the divine can enter into our experience of the world, so\nthat the content of the concept comes to be embodied in the world as\nit appears. A related case is reported by Roger Scruton when he\nrepresents the intentions of the designers of the Gothic church in\nthese terms:\n\nit is clear from Abbot Suger\u2019s account of the building of St\nDenis \u2026 that the architects of the Gothic churches were motivated by\na perceived relationship between the finished church and the Heavenly\nCity of Christian speculation. Sir John Summerson has further\nsuggested that the Gothic church aims at a certain effect of\naccumulation. Each great church can be considered as a concatenation\nof smaller structures, of aedicules, fitted together as arches,\nchapels, windows, and spires, and so can be seen as an assembled city,\nrather than as a single entity minutely subdivided\u2026 But the\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d here is not a \u201cthought\u201d that\nis separable from the experience \u2013 it is there in the\nexperience, as when I see the dots of a puzzle picture as a face, or\nthe man in the moon. (1979, pp. 74\u20135)\n\n\nHere, the concept of the heavenly city has a phenomenal counterpart in\nthe appearance of the Gothic church, once the perceptual field has\nbeen appropriately organised. We could put the point by saying that\nthe concept of the heavenly city can be inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, so that the Gothic church comes to present an image of that\ncity, by virtue of appearing as an \u201cassembled\u201d entity,\nrather than as a single thing divided. As Scruton notes, this is not a\nquestion of the idea of the heavenly city being used to interpret the\nappearances; the connection is more integral than that: the\nappearances themselves take on a certain character once they are\nordered according to that idea. Perhaps, similarly, it is possible for\na particular concept of God to be inscribed in the perceptual field,\nso that the sensory world in some relevant respect comes to image God?\nSomething like this possibility seems to be implied in Edwards\u2019\naccount of his conversion experience, where the world \u2013 the sun\nand stars, trees and flowers \u2013 is said to body forth the various\ndivine attributes. Edwards\u2019 insistent use of the words\n\u201cappear\u201d and \u201cappearance\u201d in his report\nindicates that his intention is to communicate the phenomenology of\nhis experience, where that phenomenology is one of the divine nature\nbeing manifest in the world.\n\nOf course, the case of the Gothic church may seem relatively\nstraightforward, and rather unrepresentative of religious thought more\ngenerally. For, here, we are dealing with the capacity of one\nspatio-temporal entity (the Gothic church) to image another (the\nheavenly city), and it is only to be expected that one such entity can\nimage another once its appearance is structured appropriately.\n(Compare the capacity of small children to take clouds as images of\njust about anything, once the relevant isomorphism has been\nintroduced.) But if a religious thought concerns, say, the divine\nnature, then it is not of a spatio-temporal entity, and in this case,\ntherefore, it is harder to see how the appearance of the world might\npresent an image of the content of the thought. It may be that another\nof Scruton\u2019s examples bears on this issue. In the following\npassage, he is considering the capacity of a cloister to represent an\nideal of life. He writes:\n\none might think of a Romanesque cloister in terms of the industrious\npiety of its former inhabitants: in terms of an historical identity, a\nway of life, with which this habit of building was associated. But\nwere a man to present this as his reason for looking favourably on\nsome particular cloister, say that of S. Paolo Fuori Le Mura in Rome\n\u2026 then the onus lies on him to show exactly how such an idea finds\nconfirmation in an experience of the building. Perhaps he could go on\nto refer to the variety of forms employed in the columns, to their\nfine industrious detailing, and to the way in which none of this\nabundance of observation disturbs the restful harmony of the design.\nHe might trace the rhythm of the arcade, and describe the Cosmatesque\nmosaic, with its bright and childlike inventiveness that never\ntransgresses the bounds of sensible ornamentation. In all this, he\nmight say, we see how energetic observation and monastic piety may be\nsuccessfully combined. A certain idea of monasticism becomes a visible\nreality: the idea is not merely a personal association occasioned by\nsome anecdotal or historical reminiscence: we see it in the\ndetails of the building. (1979, p. 109)\n\n\nThis case is rather different from the example of the Gothic church.\nHere, what we \u201csee\u201d in the building is not a\nspatio-temporal entity (the heavenly city) but an ideal of life. Of\ncourse, it is true that it was the monks\u2019 leading of that life\nthat accounts for the construction of the building; but Scruton is\nclear that the association here, between the way of life and the\ncharacter of the building, is not just causal: when the cloister is\nviewed in the right way, that way of life enters into its appearance.\nIn general terms, it seems clear enough how, on Scruton\u2019s\naccount, this is supposed to happen: what is required is that when we\nview the building, we hold in tension the \u201cenergy\u201d and\n\u201cabundant observation\u201d of the columns, arcade and other\nfeatures of the structure, on the one side, and the impression of\n\u201crestfulness\u201d and measure that is communicated by the\noverall design of the cloister, on the other. When we allow these two\nimpressions of the building to coexist in our perception of it, then\nthe building can image the relevant ideal of life. Here again, what is\nneeded, presumably, is that we order the scene according to the\nappropriate pattern of salience. But this is, it seems, a relatively\ncomplex example of salient viewing, since it requires one set of\nqualities, identified in one instance of salient viewing, to be laid\nalongside another, identified in another instance of salient viewing,\nwithin a single, cohesive act of perception.\n\nThis case is closer to the experience that Edwards reports than is the\nexample of the heavenly city, and it suggests one way of making sense\nof his account. Perhaps just as the ideal of life, and the associated\nvirtues, of the monks can be imaged in the cloister, so the divine\ncharacter, and the divine \u201cvirtues,\u201d can be imaged in the\nworld, once it is viewed aright. If so, that would be a significant\ntruth: for in that case, we would be able to reckon with various\nconceptions of the divine nature not only abstractly, but also in\nsensory terms, in so far as those conceptions can be used to order the\nappearance of the everyday world, so that the relevant understanding\nof God comes to be imaged by the world as experienced. And if this is\nso, then we have reason to think that the goods of the spiritual life\nare not only behavioural, intellectual, emotional and attitudinal, as\nwidely supposed, but also perceptual. (For further discussion, see\nWynn 2013.) On this view, the way the sensory world appears can be\ndeemed more or less appropriate relative to various truths concerning\nthe divine nature; and accordingly, some ways in which the world\nappears may turn out to realize significant spiritual goods.\n",
