    "main_text": "The Interpretation of the Theory and its Primitive Ontologies\n11. The Interpretation of the Theory and its Primitive Ontologies \n\nAs stressed in the opening sentences of this contribution, the most\nserious problem of standard quantum mechanics lies in its being\nextremely successful in telling us about what we observe, but\nbeing basically silent on what there is. This specific\nfeature is closely related to the probabilistic interpretation of the\nstatevector, combined with the completeness assumption of the theory.\nNotice that what is under discussion is the probabilistic\ninterpretation, not the probabilistic character, of the theory. Also\ncollapse theories have a fundamentally stochastic character but, due\nto their most specific feature, i.e., that of driving the statevector\nof any individual physical system into appropriate and physically\nmeaningful manifolds, they allow for a different interpretation. One\ncould even say (if one wants to avoid that they too, as the standard\ntheory, speak only of what we find) that they\nrequire a different interpretation, one that accounts for our\nperceptions at the appropriate, i.e., macroscopic, level.\n\nWe must admit that this opinion is not universally shared. According\nto various authors, the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 embodied in\nthe precise formulation of the GRW and CSL theories represent all\nthere is to say about them. However, this cannot be the whole story:\nstricter and more precise requirements than the purely formal ones\nmust be imposed for a theory to be taken seriously as a fundamental\ndescription of natural processes (an opinion shared by J. Bell). This\nrequest of going beyond the purely formal aspects of a theoretical\nscheme has been denoted as (the necessity of specifying) the Primitive\nOntology (PO) of the theory in an extremely interesting paper (Allori,\net al. 2008). The fundamental requisite of the PO is that it should\nmake absolutely precise what the theory is fundamentally about.\n\nThis is not a new problem; as already mentioned it has been raised by\nJ. Bell since his first presentation of the GRW theory. Let me\nsummarize the terms of the debate. Given that the wavefunction of a\nmany-particle system lives in a (high-dimensional) configuration\nspace, which is not endowed with a direct physical meaning connected\nto our experience of the world around us, Bell wanted to identify the\n\u2018local beables\u2019 of the theory, the quantities on which one\ncould base a description of the perceived reality in ordinary\nthree-dimensional space. In the specific context of QMSL, he (Bell\n1987: 45) suggested that the \u2018GRW jumps\u2019, which we called\n\u2018hittings\u2019, could play this role. In fact they occur at\nprecise times in precise positions of the three-dimensional space. As\nsuggested in (Allori, et al. 2008) we will denote this position\nconcerning the PO of the GRW theory as the \u2018flashes\nontology.\u2019\n\nHowever, later Bell himself suggested that the most natural\ninterpretation of the wavefunction in the context of a collapse theory\nwould be that it describes the \u2018density [\u2026] of\nstuff\u2019 in the 3N-dimensional configuration space (Bell 1990:\n30), the natural mathematical framework for describing a system of\n\\(N\\) particles. Allori et al. (2008) appropriately have pointed out\nthat this position amounts to avoiding commitment about the PO\nontology of the theory and, consequently, to leaving vague the precise\nand meaningful connections it permits to be established between the\nmathematical description of the unfolding of physical processes and\nour perception of them.\n\nThe interpretation which, in our opinion, is most appropriate for\ncollapse theories, has been proposed in (Ghirardi, Grassi, &\nBenatti 1995) and has been referred in Allori et al. 2008 as\n\u2018the mass density ontology\u2019. Let us briefly describe\nit.\n\nFirst of all, various investigations (Pearle & Squires 1994) had\nmade clear that QMSL and CSL needed a modification, i.e., the\ncharacteristic localization frequency of the elementary constituents\nof matter had to be made proportional to the mass characterizing the\nparticle under consideration. In particular, the original frequency\nfor the hitting processes \\(f = 10^{-16}\\) sec\\(^{-1}\\) is the one\ncharacterizing the nucleons, while, e.g., electrons would suffer\nhittings with a frequency reduced by about 2000 times. Unfortunately\nwe have no space to discuss here the physical reasons which make this\nchoice appropriate; we refer the reader to the above paper, as well as\nto the detailed analysis by Peruzzi and Rimini (2000). With this\nmodification, what the nonlinear dynamics strives to make\n\u2018objectively definite\u2019 is the mass distribution in the\nwhole universe. Second, a deep critical reconsideration (Ghirardi,\nGrassi, & Benatti 1995) has made evident how the concept of\n\u2018distance\u2019 that characterizes the Hilbert space is\ninappropriate in accounting for the similarity or difference between\nmacroscopic situations. Just to give a convincing example, consider\nthree states \\(\\ket{h} , \\ket{h^*}\\) and \\(\\ket{t}\\) of a macrosystem\n(let us say a massive macroscopic bulk of matter), the first\ncorresponding to its being located here, the second to its having the\nsame location but one of its atoms (or molecules) being in a state\northogonal to the corresponding state in \\(\\ket{h}\\), and the third\nhaving exactly the same internal state of the first but being\ndifferently located (there). Then, despite the fact that the first two\nstates are indistinguishable from each other at the macrolevel, while\nthe first and the third correspond to completely different and\ndirectly perceivable situations, the Hilbert space distance between\n\\(\\ket{h}\\) and \\(\\ket{h^*}\\), is equal to that between \\(\\ket{h}\\)\nand \\(\\ket{t}\\).\n\nWhen the localization frequency is related to the mass of the\nconstituents, then, in completely generality (i.e., even when one is\ndealing with a body which is not almost rigid, such as a gas or a\ncloud), the mechanism leading to the suppression of the superpositions\nof macroscopically different states is fundamentally governed by the\nthe integral of the squared differences of the mass densities\nassociated to the two superposed states. Actually, in the original\npaper the mass density at a point was identified with its average over\nthe characteristic volume of the theory, i.e., \\(10^{-15}\\) cm\\(^3\\)\naround that point. It is however easy to convince oneself that there\nis no need to do so and that the mass density at any point, directly\nidentified by the statevector (see below), is the appropriate quantity\non which to base an appropriate ontology. Accordingly, we take the\nfollowing attitude: what the theory is about, what is real \u2018out\nthere\u2019 at a given space point \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\), is just a\nfield, i.e., a variable \\(m(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) given by the expectation\nvalue of the mass density operator \\(M(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) at\n\\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) obtained by multiplying the mass of any kind of\nparticle times the number density operator for the considered type of\nparticle and summing over all possible types of particles which can be\npresent: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{7}\nm(\\boldsymbol{x},t) &= \\langle F,t \\mid M(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\mid F,t\n\\rangle; \\\\ M(\\boldsymbol{x}) &= {\\sum}_{(k)}\nm_{(k)}a^*_{(k)}(\\boldsymbol{x})a_{(k)}(\\boldsymbol{x}).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(\\ket{F,t}\\) is the statevector characterizing the system at the\ngiven time, and \\(a^*_{(k)}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) and\n\\(a_{(k)}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) are the creation and annihilation\noperators for a particle of type \\(k\\) at point \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\). It\nis obvious that within standard quantum mechanics such a function\ncannot be endowed with any objective physical meaning due to the\noccurrence of linear superpositions which give rise to values that do\nnot correspond to what we find in a measurement process or what we\nperceive. In the case of GRW or CSL theories, if one considers only\nthe states allowed by the dynamics one can give a description of the\nworld in terms of \\(m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)\\), i.e., one recovers a\nphysically meaningful account of physical reality in the usual\n3-dimensional space and time. To illustrate this crucial point we\nconsider, first of all, the embarrassing situation of a macroscopic\nobject in the superposition of two differently located position\nstates. We have then simply to recall that in a collapse model\nrelating reductions to mass density differences, the dynamics\nsuppresses in extremely short times the embarrassing superpositions of\nsuch states to recover the mass distribution corresponding to our\nperceptions. Let us come now to a microsystem and let us consider the\nequal weight superposition of two states \\(\\ket{h}\\) and \\(\\ket{t}\\)\ndescribing a microscopic particle in two different locations. Such a\nstate gives rise to a mass distribution corresponding to 1/2 of the\nmass of the particle in the two considered space regions. This seems,\nat first sight, to contradict what is revealed by any measurement\nprocess. But in such a case we know that the theory implies that the\ndynamics running all natural processes within GRW ensures that\nwhenever one tries to locate the particle they will always find it in\na definite position, e.g., one and only one of the Geiger counters\nwhich might be triggered by the passage of the proton will fire, just\nbecause a superposition of \u2018a counter which has fired\u2019 and\n\u2018one which has not fired\u2019 is dynamically forbidden.\n\nThis analysis shows that one can consider at all levels (the micro and\nthe macroscopic ones) the field \\(m(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) as accounting for\n\u2018what is out there\u2019, as originally suggested by\nSchr\u00f6dinger with his realistic interpretation of the square of\nthe wave function of a particle as representing the\n\u2018fuzzy\u2019 character of the mass (or charge) of the particle.\nObviously, within standard quantum mechanics such a position cannot be\nmaintained because  \n\n\nwavepackets diffuse, and with the passage of time become infinitely\nextended \u2026 but however far the wavefunction has extended, the\nreaction of a detector \u2026 remains spotty (Bell 1990: 39). \n\n\nAs we hope to have made\nclear, the picture is radically different when one takes into account\nthe new dynamics which succeeds perfectly in reconciling the spread\nand sharp features of the wavefunction and of the detection process,\nrespectively.\n\nIt is also extremely important to stress that, by resorting to the\nquantity (7) one can define an appropriate \u2018distance\u2019\nbetween two states as the integral over the whole 3-dimensional space\nof the square of the difference of \\(m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)\\) for the two\ngiven states, a quantity which turns out to be perfectly appropriate\nto ground the concept of macroscopically similar or distinguishable\nHilbert space states. In turn, this distance can be used as a basis to\ndefine a sensible psychophysical correspondence within the theory.\n",
