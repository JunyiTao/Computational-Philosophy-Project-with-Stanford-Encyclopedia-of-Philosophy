However, in classical general\nrelativity there remains a fundamental asymmetry between gravitational\nand non-gravitational fields, in particular, electromagnetism, the\nonly other fundamental physical interaction definitely known until the\n1930s. This shows up visibly in one form of the Einstein field\nequations in which, on the left-hand side, a geometrical object\n(\\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\), the Einstein tensor) built up from the uniquely\ncompatible linear symmetric (\u201cLevi-Civita\u201d) connection\nassociated with the metric tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\), and representing the\ncurvature of spacetime, is set identical to a tensorial but\nnon-geometrical phenomenological representation of matter on the\nright-hand side. \n\n\\[ G_{\\mu\\nu} = k T_{\\mu\\nu}, \\textrm{ where } G_{\\mu\\nu} \\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\mu\\nu} R \\]\n\n\nThe expression on the right side, introduced by a coupling term that\ncontains Newton\u2019s gravitational constant, mathematically\nrepresents the non-gravitational sources of the gravitational field in\na region of spacetime in the form of a stress-energy-momentum tensor\n(an \u201comnium gatherum\u201d in Eddington\u2019s (1919:\n63) pithy phrase). As the geometry of spacetime principally resides on\nthe left-hand side, this situation seems unsatisfactory. Late in life,\nEinstein likened his famous equation to a building, one wing of which\n(the left) was built of \u201cfine marble\u201d, the other (the\nright) of \u201clow grade wood\u201d (1936: 311). In its classical\nform, general relativity accords only the gravitational field a direct\ngeometrical significance; the other physical fields reside in\nspacetime; they are not of spacetime.\n\nEinstein\u2019s dissatisfaction with this asymmetrical state of\naffairs was palpable at an early stage and was expressed with\nincreasing frequency beginning in the early 1920s. A particularly\nvivid declaration of the need for geometrical unification was made in\nhis \u201cNobel lecture\u201d of July 1923:\n\n\nThe mind striving after unification of the theory cannot be satisfied\nthat two fields should exist which, by their nature, are quite\nindependent. A mathematically unified field theory is sought in which\nthe gravitational field and the electromagnetic field are interpreted\nas only different components or manifestations of the same uniform\nfield,\u2026 The gravitational theory, considered in terms of\nmathematical formalism, i.e., Riemannian geometry, should be\ngeneralized so that it includes the laws of the electromagnetic field.\n(489)\n\n\nIt might be noted that the tacit assumption, evident here, that\nincorporation of electromagnetism into spacetime geometry requires a\ngeneralization of the Riemannian geometry of general relativity;\nthough widely held at the time, it is not quite correct (Rainich 1925;\nMisner & Wheeler 1957; Geroch 1966).\n",
