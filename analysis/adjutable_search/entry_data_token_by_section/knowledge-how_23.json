For many tasks\nat least, it is intuitive that one cannot be skilled at it without\nknowing how to perform it. At first, it also seems as if knowledge-how\nentails skill: one does not really know how to swim if one does not\nhave the skill to swim; and one cannot know how to tell apart birds\nwithout the skills of a bird watcher. One might object to the\nsufficiency of knowledge-how for skill on the grounds that it is\nnatural to say things such as \u201cJohn may know how to make\nrisotto, but I would not say he is skilled at it\u201d. However,\nknowing how to make risotto sufficiently well (relative to\ncontextually determined standards) might entail being skilled at it\n(relative to the same standards) (Cath 2020).\n\nRyle (1946, 1949) used \u201cskill\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge-how\u201d interchangeably in his criticism of the\n\u201cIntellectualist legend\u201d (for discussion, see Kremer\n2020). In fact, Ryle\u2019s view of knowledge-how is stated,\nliterally, as the view that \u201cskill\u201d is a complex of\ndispositions (Ryle 1949: 33; see also Ryle 1967, 1974, 1976 for his\nviews on how skill as a form of knowledge is distinguished by the\nforms on how it is taught and learned through training). This\ndiscussion brings us to whether intellectualism about knowledge-how\nand intellectualism about skill stand or fall together.\nShould intellectualists about knowledge-how identify skill too with\npropositional knowledge? While Stanley and Williamson (2001) embrace\nthe view that knowledge-how is propositional knowledge, in a recent\npaper (Stanley & Williamson 2017), they refuse to think of\nskill as a standing propositional knowledge state. Rather,\nthey argue that skills are dispositions to know. One motivation for\nthis view is that this addresses the novelty challenge raised by\nDreyfus (1991, 2005). According to this challenge, propositional\nknowledge cannot explain the ability to respond intelligently to\nsituations that have not been encountered by the agent before. If\nskills are dispositions to know, it is no mystery how novel situations\ncan be handled by skillful agents. Stanley & Williamson (2017)\nclaim that the resulting view is still broadly intellectualist in a\nsense, because on it, skillful action manifests propositional\nknowledge (for a criticism of this response to the novelty objection,\nsee Pavese 2016 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome authors argue that while skills may be related to propositional\nknowledge, they do not reduce to it. Dickie (2012) suggests that an\nagent is skilled at \u03a6 whenever her intentions to \u03a6 are\nnon-lucky selectors of non-lucky means to \u03a6; while, in turn, these\nmeans might manifest propositional knowledge. Some argue that control\nis necessary for skills, and control cannot fully be understood in\nterms of propositional knowledge (Fridland 2014, 2017a, 2017b). In\norder to provide a theory of skill that makes room for control,\nFridland (2020) develops a \u201cfunctional\u201d account of skills.\nIn this view, a skill is a function from intentions to action,\nimplemented through certain \u201ccontrol structures\u201d, which\ninclude attention and strategic control. Among these control\nstructures, there is also propositional knowledge, which is required\nfor strategic control. In contrast, intellectualists about skills\nargue that being in control is not intelligible unless it is\nunderstood in terms of knowing what one is doing in virtue of knowing\nhow to perform that action. Therefore, they argue that agentive\ncontrol itself is best understood in terms of the capacity for\npropositional knowledge.\n",
