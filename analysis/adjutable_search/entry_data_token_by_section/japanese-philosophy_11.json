    "main_text": "Historical Periods of Philosophical Development and Interaction || Edo-period Philosophy (1600\u20131868)\n4.3 Edo-period Philosophy (1600\u20131868)\n\nThe Edo period marked a time of relative peace and stability under the\nTokugawa shogunate following the unification of the country by a\nsequence of three hegemons: Oda Nobunaga (1534\u20131582), Toyotomi\nHideyoshi (1537\u20131598), and finally Tokugawa Ieyasu\n(1543\u20131616). Most of the unification occurred at the hands of\nNobunaga with Hideyoshi as his chief general. A major factor in\nNobunaga\u2019s success was his cunning use of the new technologies\nof warfare (canons and muskets) introduced by Portuguese traders in\n1543.\n\nWith the Portuguese and Spanish ships came Roman Catholic\nmissionaries. The hegemons at times welcomed the Christians as\ninformants about the West and as foils against Buddhism, but at other\ntimes, viciously persecuted them as potential threats in turning the\npeople against the new political order in favor a foreign God. In the\nend, Christianity was banned from the country entirely (with most\nfinality after the closure of Japan to almost all Western contact\nafter 1637). Therefore, although Christianity enjoyed some initial\nsuccess in its number of conversions, its overall impact was limited.\nFormal polemical debates with Buddhists did introduce some new lines\nof argument to Japan especially concerning creation, afterlife, and\nteleology. Snippets reappeared in later Shint\u014d arguments, most\nnotably those by Hirata Atsutane (1777\u20131843), but in general, as\na philosophical tradition, Christianity\u2019s impact would be\nminimal until its reintroduction to Japan in the modern period. The\nmajor philosophical innovation of the Edo period would not be\nChristianity but rather a new form of Confucianism.\n4.3.1 Edo-period Confucianism\n\nConfucianism had been part of Japan\u2019s intellectual tradition\nsince ancient times, but a series of events in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries breathed into it new life. With their skills in\nChinese language, their general knowledge of Chinese culture, and\ntheir intermittent personal contacts in China, Rinzai Zen Buddhist\nmonks often served as advisers about China to the medieval shoguns.\nYet, for the most part, the Rinzai monks had lost touch with Confucian\nmovements in China through much of the medieval era and were surprised\nto discover in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that since\nthe eleventh century totally new forms of Chinese Confucianism had\ndeveloped, what is called in the West neo-Confucianism.\n\nThat neo-Confucianism included comprehensive philosophical systems\nthat had incorporated ideas and practices from Buddhism and Daoism,\nrelegating them into subordinate places within its own philosophy. The\nConfucianism in Japan that was a legacy from the ancient period barely\ntouched on metaphysical, epistemological, and psychological issues and\nhad hardly mentioned themes related to nature, art, and creativity.\nHence, up to the Edo period, Japanese philosophers had turned to\nBuddhism to address those themes. Indeed, from the time of K\u016bkai,\nBuddhism had relegated Japanese Confucian thought to being not much\nmore than a social philosophy. The newly imported neo-Confucianism,\nhowever, had assimilated enough Buddhist and Daoist ideas that it\ncould address a full complement of philosophical problems in a single\ncomprehensive system. When the second hegemon, Toyotomi Hideyoshi,\nbrought prisoners of war to Japan from his failed attempt to conquer\nKorea in the late sixteenth century, included in the group were some\nKorean officials who were also scholars of Chinese neo-Confucianism.\nRinzai Zen monks became disciples and soon Japan had its own emergent\nschools of neo-Confucianism, a phenomenon the Tokugawa shogunate would\nwelcome.\n\nThe Tokugawa regime largely distrusted Buddhism with its armies of\nmonks on Mt Hiei and Mt K\u014dya and with its popularity among\npeasants who rebelled (for good reason) over high taxes and the\nmismanagement of agricultural resources. Hoping to centralize the\ngovernment by building up large urban centers, the shogunate believed\nConfucianism could support its aims. First, compared with Buddhism and\nChristianity, Confucianism in Japan was basically secular and unlike\nBuddhism had no preexisting institutional networks to conciliate. As a\nphilosophy, Confucianism stresses communal harmony grounded in\nhierarchical social relations, an ideal that had served the state well\nin building Japan\u2019s first permanent capital in eighth-century\nNara. Perhaps it could work again. Lastly, Confucian academies could\nserve the new urban, literate, and mercantile culture the shogunate\nwas envisioning.\n\nBy the end of the seventeenth century, the home of the Tokugawa\nshogunate in Edo (present-day Tokyo) had grown from a fishing village\nto a metropolis larger than any city in Europe, while Kyoto and Osaka\nwere each close to the size of Paris. A nationwide economy flourished\nby means of a a network of roads and waterways accompanied by a system\nof mercantile laws with a unified monetary system. Literacy soared as\nthe publication industry boomed. The effect on philosophy was profound\nas its center of activity shifted from the Buddhist temples to secular\nurban academies supported by student tuition. This commodification of\nknowledge led to sharp competition among schools of thought, fueling\nan array of new philosophies, each purporting to be an improvement on\nwhat was available elsewhere. See the entry on \n Japanese Confucian Philosophy, section 3.)\n\nBesides schools directly imported from China, Japanese Confucians\ndeveloped their own variations, occasionally assimilating aspects of\nShint\u014d. Even more syncretic were teachers of practical philosophy\nwho directed their teachings to ordinary townspeople, mixing various\nlevels of teaching and praxis (including Buddhism and Shint\u014d)\naccording to the needs and talents of the audience, even to the extent\nof having different wings in their academies dedicated to different\nlevels and kinds of teaching for different audiences.\n\nA major theme across many varieties of Edo-period Confucianism was a\nfocus on language. As mentioned above in the discussion of the\nfundamental ideas of Confucian philosophy, a basic assumption is that\nan understanding of a term for a human relation entails a recognition\nof how that relation should be enacted. To know fully what the term\nfriend means, for example, is to know how a friend ought to\nact. That is the principle of the trueing up of terms, or the\nrectification of names. Previous to the Edo period in Japan that was\nabout as far as the analysis went. With the expanded range of issues\naddressed in the new forms of Confucianism, however, the question was\nwhether that same principle could be applied beyond the five binary\nhuman relations. For example, do the essential meanings of terms like\nhuman nature, mind, harmony, principle, or learning\nalso entail normative behaviors? Can a philosophy of education, for\nexample, be generated out of a close analysis of the meaning of the\nancient word for \u201clearning\u201d (gaku) in the classic\nChinese texts? To what extent do words have individual meanings and to\nwhat extent is there a core of terms that are in internal relation to\neach other that can be understood only together? And so forth. Such\nthemes became the center of attention in the Confucian academies and\nthey raised questions about the nature of language and how to study\nit.\n\nThe concern for language motivated not only the careful reading of\ntraditional texts, but also increasingly sophisticated philological\nstudies into the meaning of ancient Chinese words. Inspired by\ndetailed Chinese glossaries of key terms, Japanese Confucian scholars\nargued among themselves about the correct understanding of central\nideas by doing their own exegeses of texts and etymological or\nphilological discussions. Some (who came to be associated with a\nclassicist movement sometimes called Kogaku) took their\nhistorical philology so strictly that they refused to read any Chinese\nConfucian texts written after Confucius\u2019s own time, considering\nthe assimilative techniques of neo-Confucianism to be dilutions of\noriginal insights, even to the extent of introducing Buddhist or\nDaoist \u201cdistortions\u201d to the original meaning of terms. As\nfor philological methodology, again we find a range of opinion. Should\nwe take a detached, scientific approach that analyzes the occurrences\nof words simply in their own contexts as objectively as possible? Or\nshould we try to engage them so that they become our language\nand we can write or even speak in the style of the most ancient\nChinese prose and poetry? How can we best understand language: with\nthe detachment of a philologist or with the engagement of a poet? The\nphilosophers of language in Edo-period Confucianism debated such\nissues.\n4.3.2 Kokugaku (Native Studies)\n\nThe emphasis on ancient texts, language, and meanings inspired another\ngroup of scholars to pursue an entirely different direction. The\nblatant sinophilia of some of the Japanese Confucians vexed those\nJapanese who wanted to deepen the appreciation of their own ancient\nlanguage and texts. The oldest Japanese texts such as Kojiki\nhad been written in the eighth century, before an effective\northography for Japanese had been fully developed. As a result, many\nparts of those most ancient texts were nearly unintelligible to later\nreaders. Philologists and literary critics in a movement called Native\nStudies (kokugaku) took up the task of breaking the code by\ndiscovering, for example, that ancient Japanese had vowel sounds that\nsoon dropped out of use by the time the orthography had been\nstandardized. That helped account for many apparent discrepancies and\nallowed for insights into ancient expressions. (See the entry on \n The Kokugaku School.)\n\nFor example, the terms for \u201cawe-inspiring being\u201d and\n\u201cabove\u201d have both been pronounced kami since the\neight century, but in ancient Japanese they were separate\nwords pronounced differently, disproving a common theory that there\nwas a semantic link between the two. Such discoveries led some\nthinkers, most notably Motoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801), to take\nNative Studies in a new direction: the quest for developing a\nShint\u014d philosophy grounded in an understanding of the most\nancient Japanese texts and their language. In essence, Norinaga hoped\nto do for Shint\u014d what Edo-period Confucians were doing for their\ntradition in going back to ancient texts and analyzing their original\nlanguage.\n\nAs already explained, in ancient Japan proto-Shint\u014d had the\nsketch of a basic world view and set of values, but it had lacked\nphilosophical explanation or argumentative justification. In the early\nninth century esoteric Buddhism supplied the philosophical\nunderpinnings for what was, in effect, a quite similar view of reality\nas a field of interdependent, internally related events that are\nalways in flux. Esoteric Buddhist philosophy had relegated Shint\u014d\nto being a surface manifestation of what, on a deeper level, could be\nexplained as a Buddhist reality. That is roughly how the situation\nstood for much of the medieval period with one notable exception.\n\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth century Shint\u014d philosophers in\nthe Watarai lineage had started to pose repeatedly a new argument:\nhistorical priority entails ontological priority or importance. For a\ncreation or cosmogonic theory formulated in diachronic time, the point\nis clear enough. What comes first creates what comes next and hence\nthe latter is ontologically dependent on the former. The remarkable\npoint is that this claim, so common in Abrahamic theories of genesis\nas well as most classical Greco-Roman cosmogonies, seems to have been\nmostly unargued in Japan before the medieval period, primarily because\nBuddhism and Confucianism place little importance in their\nphilosophies on creation myths. Buddhism in particular favors a\ncyclical rather than linear theory of cosmic time and, therefore, in\nclaiming the ontological superiority of buddhas over their\nmanifestations as kami, the argument was based on a\nmetaphysical or logical argument, not an appeal to a chronology of\ncreation.\n\nIn Shint\u014d philosophy, however, in the centuries following the\nWatarai formulations, the search for the primordial\u2013\u2013the\nprimal energy of creation, the primal source of language, the primal\norigin of the Japanese land and its people\u2014became a deepening\ninterest. Certainly, we find that emphasis in Native Studies, in both\nits early philological and literary project as well as in its focus on\nKojiki. Because of Norinaga\u2019s influence,\nKojiki became not only the central canon for Shint\u014d, but\nalso revered as the oldest text with substantial portions written in\nthe \u201coriginal\u201d language of the Japanese people (yamato\nno kotoba). That language was understood to consist of\nword-things (koto) imbued with the creation of the spirit of\nancient Japan (yamato no damashii). (See the entry on \n The Kokugaku School, section 3.2.) \nThat claim continued into the\nnineteenth-century ideology of State Shint\u014d that argued for the\nrestoration of the original purity of the Japanese people and their\nappropriate role in the \u201cnew moment of world history,\u201d a\nkeynote of the Japanese ethnocentrism and imperial militarism of the\nmodern period.\n4.3.3 Edo-period Buddhism\n\nAlthough Edo-period Buddhism was active in its scholarly productivity,\nits philosophical creativity did not match the activity of either\nConfucianism or Shint\u014d, but there were exceptions. For example,\nJiun Sonja (1718\u20131804) was a Shingon monk whose career ran\ncounter to the typical pattern in Edo Japan in that he was first a\nConfucian and then became a Buddhist. Early in his career he enrolled\nin the Confucian academy of It\u014d Jinsai (1627\u20131705), where\nthere was a strong emphasis on philology, on trueing up the key terms\nby scrutinizing the early Chinese texts. That inspired Jiun to\ninvestigate the roots of Buddhism, but in that case the relevant texts\nwere in Sanskrit, a language barely studied in Japan at the time.\nUndaunted, he took up the study mainly on his own, becoming\nJapan\u2019s premier authority on Sanskrit in the premodern period.\nBased on his research, Jiun argued for a new form of monasticism based\non what he understood to be the original principles of Buddhism that\npreceded and transcended the various sectarian forms of Buddhism known\nin Japan. Thus, Jiun represents yet another example of an Edo-period\nthinker who used philology as a means of unearthing the origins and\nphilosophical principles of a tradition\u2014in his case\nBuddhism\u2014in much the same way as his contemporaries did in\nNative and Confucian Studies.\n\nAs a philosopher, Jiun\u2019s acumen was best displayed in his\narguments in favor of Buddhist over Confucian ethics. Against the\nConfucian charge that Buddhism was antinomian, Jiun pointed to the ten\nBuddhist precepts, the prohibitions against \u201ckilling, stealing,\nadultery, lying, frivolous language, slander, equivocation, greed,\nanger, and wrong views.\u201d In comparison with the Confucian\nvirtues, Jiun argued, they were not only more specific (and therefore\nmore practical), but also could be shown to have a metaphysical\njustification based in the nature of reality as confirmed by the\nBuddhist experiences of as-ness and universal buddha-nature. By\ncontrast, Jiun pointed out, the Confucian virtues derived from a blind\nacceptance of texts claiming that the ancient Chinese sages had lived\nin a utopian society of harmony. In other words, Buddhist ethics\nemerge from an analysis based in the engagement with immanent reality,\nwhereas Confucian ethics are based in the detached study of texts\nconsidered authoritative.\n\nAs sinophilia increased among Rinzai Zen monks in the later medieval\nand Edo periods, many Rinzai monasteries became centers for practicing\nthe arts and letters, much in the tradition of the Chinese literati\nand often to the neglect of traditional Zen disciplines. Occasionally,\nRinzai masters like Hakuin Ekaku (1685\u20131768) reacted against\nthis development and urged a revival of intense and rigorous forms of\npraxis. One teaching that would have important ramifications for later\nevents was an increasing emphasis on death as a theme. When the\nTokugawa peace brought newly unemployed samurai warriors to the gates\nof Rinzai Zen monasteries, some masters like Takuan S\u014dh\u014d\n(1573\u20131645), Suzuki Sh\u014dsan (1579\u20131655), and\nShid\u014d Bunan (or Munan 1603\u20131676) tried to find points of\ncontact between Zen and their martial experience. One strategy was to\ncompare the warrior\u2019s fearlessness in the face of death with the\nZen monk\u2019s fearlessness in the face of losing the ego-self. Of\ncourse, the former occurs only at the moment of battle and the latter\nshould be a mentality of egoless engagement within all the events of\neveryday life. Yet, the comparison would establish a link between\nBuddhist discipline and what would evolve into bushid\u014d,\nthe Way of the warrior in the modern period.\n",
