The intersubjective constitution of objectivity and the case for \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d\n\nEven the objective spatio-temporal world, which represents a\nsignificant part of our everyday lifeworld, is constituted\nintersubjectively, says Husserl. (The same holds true for its\nspatio-temporal framework, consisting of objective time and space.)\nHow so? Husserl starts (again, from a first-person viewpoint) from a\n\u201csolipsistic\u201d abstraction of the notion of a\nspatio-temporal object which differs from that notion in that it does\nnot presuppose that any other subject can observe such an object from\nhis (or her) own perspective. His question is what justifies us (i.e.,\neach of us for him- or herself) in the assumption of an objective\nreality consisting of such objects, given only this\n\u201csolipsistic\u201d conception of a spatio-temporal thing (or\nevent) as our starting point. On Husserl\u2019s view, \u201cthe\ncrucial further step\u201d in order to answer this question consists\nin disclosing the dimension that opens up when the epistemic\njustification, or \u201cmotivation\u201d, of intersubjective\nexperience, or empathy, is additionally taken into account and made\nexplicit (Husserliana, vol. VII, p. 435).\n\nRoughly, his argument goes as follows. In order for me to be able to\nput myself into someone else\u2019s shoes and simulate his (or her)\nperspective upon his surrounding spatio-temporal world, I cannot but\nassume that this world coincides with my own, at least to a large\nextent; although the aspects under which the other subject represents\nthe world must be different, as they depend on his own egocentric\nviewpoint. Hence, I must presuppose that the spatio-temporal objects\nforming my own world exist independently of my subjective perspective\nand the particular experiences I perform; they must, in other words,\nbe conceived of as part of an objective reality. This result\nfits in well with\u2014in fact, it serves to\nexplain\u2014Husserl\u2019s view, already stressed in\nIdeas, that perceptual objects are \u201ctranscendent\u201d\nin that at any given moment they display an inexhaustive number of\nunperceived (and largely even unexpected) features, only some of which\nwill become manifest\u2014will be intuitively presented\u2014in the\nfurther course of observation.\n\nHowever, according to Husserl this does not mean that the objective\nworld thus constituted in intersubjective experience is to be regarded\nas completely independent of the aspects under which we represent the\nworld. For on his view another condition for the possibility of\nintersubjective experience is precisely the assumption that by and\nlarge the other subject structures the world into objects in the same\nstyle I myself do. It is partly for this reason that Husserl can be\nsaid to adhere to a version of both \u201crealism\u201d and\n\u201cidealism\u201d at the same time.\n\nAnother, related, reason is that Husserl\u2019s argument for realism\nis developed in a context in which he defends what he refers to as\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d (a terminological choice he\nwould later regret; see F\u00f8llesdal 1990a, p. 128). During the\nyears in which his transcendental phenomenology took shape, he\ndeveloped a number of \u201cproofs\u201d of this position, most of\nwhich are based upon his conception of a \u201creal\npossibility\u201d regarding cognition or the acquisition of\nknowledge. By a \u201creal possibility\u201d, Husserl understands a\npossibility that is such that \u201csomething\u2014more or\nless\u2014 \u2018speaks in favour of it\u2019\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. XX/1, p. 178). Real possibilities are, in\nother words, conceived of as more or less (rationally)\nmotivated possibilities; and Husserl understands motivation\nin such a way that it is always someone who is motivated a\ncertain way (cf. Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 222). This is why\nHusserl subscribes to the following dependency thesis: The\nreal possibility to acquire (empirical) knowledge regarding a\ncontingent object A (possible world, individual thing, state of\naffairs involving such thing; cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI,\npp. 139f) \u201crequires\u201d an \u201cepistemic subject\u201d,\nwhich \u201ceither experiences A, or acquires knowledge regarding A\non the basis of experience, or else has the practical possibility (or\nthe practical ability) to experience A and acquire knowledge regarding\nit\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 139). Husserl also\nadheres to the following correlation thesis with regard to\nempirical reality and real epistemic possibility: If a contingent\nobject A is real (really exists), then the real (as opposed to the\nmerely logical) possibility obtains to acquire knowledge regarding A\n(cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 138, l. 35\u201336). From\nthese two propositions\u2014the dependency and the correlation\nthesis\u2014he derives the conclusion that the existence of a\ncontingent object A requires \u201cthe necessary co-existence of a\nsubject either acquiring knowledge\u201d regarding A \u201cor having\nthe ability to do so\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, pp.\n139f). This is nothing but \u201c[t]he thesis of transcendental\nidealism [...]: A nature without co-existing subjects of possible\nexperience regarding it is unthinkable; possible subjects of\nexperience are not enough\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p.\n156).\n\nWhy are actual subjects of experience supposed to be\nnecessary? Husserl\u2019s answer refers to the notion of\nfull epistemic justification, or full degree of real\npossibility (with regard to empirical knowledge): \u201cIn order for\n[a thing of nature] to really exist, and thus in order for the\nassumption that it exists to be reasonable or justified not merely in\na restricted but rather in an unrestricted way, i.e. to the fullest\nextent, there must be an actual ego in whose experiences [...] the\nbeing of the thing manifests itself [...].\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, pp. 76f). Husserl takes this notion\nto be applicable (as far as empirical consciousness is concerned) in\ncase of truth only. Thus, in sec. 16 of Formal and Transcendental\nLogic he first equates \u201ctruth\u201d with \u201cgenuine\nknowledge\u201d which is \u201crepeatable by any [...] rational\nbeing\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XVII, p. 46) and then makes\nthe (somewhat weaker) claim that truth and such knowledge are\n\u201ccorrelated\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XVII, p. 47).\nThis conception of (empirical) truth, which is already to be found in\nLogical Investigations, has been compared to ideal\nverificationism (cf. Soldati 1994, p. 119) and to Putnam\u2019s\ninternal realism (cf. Beyer 2020, p. 69).\n\nHusserl seems to regard real possibilities as epistemic dispositions\n(habitualities), or abilities, that require an actual\n\u201csubstrate\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p.\n139). At the same time, he stresses that \u201csurely no human being\nand no animal\u201d must exist in the actual world (adding that their\nnon-existence would however already result in a \u201cchange of the\nworld\u201d) (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 121). One way\nto make sense of this would be to weaken the dependency thesis, and\nthe requirement of an actual substrate, and to merely require what\nmight be called real higher-order possibilities\u2014possibilities\nfor acquiring epistemic dispositions in counterfactual (or actual)\ncases where epistemic subjects would be co-existing\u2014that may\nremain unactualized but could be actualized by someone properly taking\ninto account a multitude of individual epistemic perspectives, by\nmeans of intersubjective experience. But even under this\nreconstruction there remains a sense in which the criteria of real\npossibility and reality constitution, and the corresponding structure\nof the real world, are dependent on an \u201cego\u201d, on\nHusserl\u2019s view: What counts as a real possibility, or as\nepistemically justified, is dependent on the phenomenological subjects\nreflecting about such counterfactual cases in the methodological\ncontext of the transcendental reduction and the results they arrive at\nin this context.\n",
