    "preamble": "\n\nDespite the simple name, biomedicine is not simply the area of overlap\nbetween biology and medicine. It is a framework, a set of\nphilosophical commitments, a global institution woven into Western\nculture and its power dynamics, and more. Biomedicine is the umbrella\ntheoretical framework for most health science and health technology\nwork done in academic and government settings. Western medical\npractices and the surrounding healthcare infrastructure are\nprincipally biomedical. Health-related corporations are predominantly\nbiomedical in orientation (with the exception of a few homeopathic\nproducers and other scattered outliers). International medical aid\nmainly offers biomedical resources. Biomedicine, in other words, is\nthe name for how most powerful global institutions envision the\nrelations between biological sciences and medicine.\n\nThe biomedical model is in fact so commonplace that it is easy to\noverlook how philosophically weighty (and contentious) its core\ncommitments are: that health phenomena must be understood in terms of\nphysical/biochemical entities and processes, that experimental\ntechniques are the preferred means of acquiring and assessing\nhealth-related knowledge, and that human bodies are best understood as\ncomposed of a collection of subsidiary parts and processes (Krieger\n2011: 130). In addition to critiquing those core commitments,\nphilosophers have also disputed connected issues regarding the\nmeanings of health and disease, the nature of biomedical knowledge and\nexpertise, the value of reductionist thinking, the value of\nbiomedicine\u2019s global institutions, etc. Some philosophers have\nalso proposed alternative frameworks for understanding the relations\nbetween biology and medicine. Though, relatively little literature is\ndirected at biomedicine per se.\n\nThe fact that the philosophical literature is so critical is in part\nbecause \n\n biomedicine is so expansive that there is no shortage of flaws to\nidentify, and \n biomedicine is deeply embedded in the current global order, and\nhence is tied directly or indirectly to all of the goods and ills of\nthat order.\n\n\nThis entry will, as much as possible, avoid duplicating the work done\nin the thorough\n Philosophy of Medicine\n entry. That entry focuses on elucidating the work done by that branch\nof philosophy, which according to entry, has\n\n\n\ndedicated journals and professional organizations, a relatively\nwell-established canon of scholarly literature, and distinctive\nquestions and problems. (Reiss & Ankeny 2016) \n\n\nMost of the \u201cmedicine\u201d examined in \u201cphilosophy of\nbiomedicine\u201d is medicine pursued within a biomedicine framework,\nso there is much overlap. Yet, this entry will accomplish something\nother than what that entry does. This entry will review the\nphilosophical literature (and some literature in allied fields, such\nas history of medicine) that scrutinizes the biomedical framework\nitself, in whole or in part.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biomedicine as a Framework for Medicine + Biology\n\nConsult with a primary care physician when feeling ill. Perhaps they\nsend you to a medical lab that will take a blood sample to run a\nbiochemical analysis. After the results arrive, consult with a\nphysician specialist whose expertise is the particular bodily organ or\nsystem where the ailment is localized. The specialist prescribes a\ndrug that has been mass-produced in a factory, after a biology\nlaboratory extracted the active ingredient from a natural source, or\nperhaps synthesized it from scratch. The drug\u2019s efficacy has\nbeen proven by testing the drug experimentally on two groups with the\nrelevant disease, randomly sorted into an experimental group and a\ncontrol group so that the drug\u2019s measurable bodily effects could\nbe scrutinized and counted. This is biomedicine. It has quickly grown\nto be so pervasive around the globe that it is difficult to\ncharacterize biomedicine.\n1.1 What is biomedicine?\n\nAs explored in this entry, and outlined in how the sections are\ndivided in the entry, biomedicine has many facets. It is a very large\nand complex thing. It is a morphing historical product of the\npost-World War Two West. It is a contemporary global social\ninstitution. It is an epistemology of medical research and practice\n(albeit with factions). It is a set of ontological and metaphysical\ncommitments. And more. \n\nThe US National Cancer Institute defines biomedicine as synonymous\nwith \u201callopathic medicine, conventional medicine, mainstream\nmedicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine\u201d (NCI\n Other Internet Resources,\n accessed 12 March 2020). By contrast, A. E. Clarke, Mamo, Fishman,\nShim, and Fosket (2003) takes an expansive view of the nature of\nbiomedicine, contending that it is an evolving entity, a cohesive and\ndeveloping whole that consists of elements ranging from the assertion\nthat good health is a personal moral obligation to the increasing\nreliance on \u201ccomputerization and data banking\u201d (A. E.\nClarke et al. 2003: 173).\n\nKrieger offers a detailed examination of the history and philosophy of\nthe \u201cbiomedicine approach,\u201d and extracts three key tenets\nof the view.\n\n\nAmong the many features of a biomedical perspective, three stand out\nas fundamental regarding its approach to investigating disease (Lock\n& Gordon 1988; Fee & Krieger 1994; Krieger 1994; Lawrence\n& Weisz 1998; Cambrosio & Keating 2001; Bynum 2008). They\nare:\n\nFirst, specific to biomedicine: the domain of disease and its\ncauses is restricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical\nphenomena;\nSecond, shared with many natural sciences: an emphasis on\nlaboratory research and technology and, as translated to health\nresearch, a discounting of research questions that cannot be studied\nby randomized clinical trials (or their analogs, e.g., \u201cnatural\nexperiments\u201d); and\nThird: an embrace of \u201creductionism,\u201d a philosophical\nand methodological stance (discussed more fully below) that holds that\nphenomena are best explained by the properties of their parts.\n(Krieger 2011: 130)\n\n\n\nKrieger\u2019s account of biomedicine offers a compelling\ndistillation of the philosophical commitments of biomedical science.\nThough since this is an entry on philosophy of biomedicine,\nthe entry will be organized around philosophical dimensions and\ndebates, rather than being organized directly around these core\ntheoretical tenets (e.g., the upcoming section is on ontological and\nmetaphysical commitments). Additionally, this entry will supplement\nthe tenets identified by Krieger with discussion of connected issues,\nsuch as philosophical critiques of biomedicine as a social institution\n (Section 4).\n\nThe terms \u201cframework\u201d and \u201capproach\u201d are used\nhere to describe biomedicine, in an attempt to avoid narrowly\novercommitting to any particular philosophical system. Biomedicine may\nor may not qualify as one of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s\n\u201cparadigms\u201d, in the way that the heliocentric model of the\nsolar system is a paradigm\u2014a complex worldview in which the\nviewpoints cannot be straightforwardly translated back-and-forth with\nan alternative paradigm (i.e., if we try to translate the concepts of\nbiomedicine to the pre-biomedical concepts of humoral theory,\ndiscussed in\n Section 1.2\n (Kuhn 1962). Alternatively, biomedicine seems to qualify as one of\nImre Lakatos\u2019 Research Programmes, a different way of conceiving\nof the way that research communities intellectually cohere (Lakatos\n1968). It\u2019s a question of how biomedicine serves as a\nmeans of organizing and guiding research.\n\nWithout getting too lost in the technical criteria, biomedicine shares\nthe Kuhnian paradigm quality of being incommensurable (or at least\nmore or less so) with other conceptions of biology and health.\nScholars of complementary medicine have spent enormous effort\nsearching for ways that traditional medical practices\u2014e.g.,\nherbal treatments handed down over generations\u2014can get a\nfoothold in a medical world dominated by biomedicine. It is telling\nthat there is no question that \u2018proof\u2019 of a\ntreatment\u2019s efficacy requires starting from scratch, by\nexamining the herb\u2019s chemical makeup, isolating and analyzing\nwhich chemical components are the active ingredients, and then testing\nsafety and efficacy, all entirely within biomedicine\u2019s rules.\nWhatever explanations might have been offered by herbalists (e.g.,\n\u2018it calms turmoil in the stomach\u2019) are irrelevant\nuntranslatable knowledge. Biomedicine also shares the Lakatosian\nResearch Programme quality of (largely implicitly) dictating what\nsorts of internal dispute about biomedicine is permissible. Within the\nbiomedical Research Programme, one is invited to question whether a\nparticular experimental design is suitable; one is not permitted to\nreject experimentation entirely.\n1.2 The history of biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine as a global institution coevolved with its characteristic\nphilosophical positions. While key elements, such as laboratory\nbiology, were present in the nineteenth century and even before,\n\u201cWorld War II is usually presented as a turning point in the\n\u2018biomedicalization\u2019 process\u201d (L\u00f6wy 2011: 117).\nThe term \u201cbiomedicine\u201d was first used between the two\nworld wars as a shorthand for some of the medical and scientific work\nbeing done on radioactive materials (Keating & Cambrosio 2003;\nL\u00f6wy 2011: 49\u201355). But biomedicine only came into its own\nduring the period of economic and social transformation in\nindustrialized Western countries that followed World War Two:\n\n\nIn industrialized countries, the post-World War II era was also\ncharacterized by important increases in public funding for medical\nresearch, the extension of health insurance to large parts of the\npopulation (a process that, in nearly all the Western countries, the\nUnited States excepted, was also supported by the state), and the\nrapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry. (L\u00f6wy 2011: 117)\n\n\nIf biomedicine is a recent historical development, then what exactly\ncame before it? Many different frameworks for health existed before\nthe rise of biomedicine, though many such frameworks exist now despite\nthe dominance of biomedicine. Some have been distinctly influenced by\nor merged with biomedicine. For instance, osteopathic medicine has\ngradually gone from a full alternative system of medicine (focusing on\nmanipulation of body via pressure, stretching and other means of\nreadjustment of bodily structure in order to rebalance internal\nprocesses), to an alternative track of medical education/practice that\nhas in large part converged with the biomedical/allopathic medicine\ntrack (McClain 2017; Stark 2013).\n\nInsofar as biomedicine formed in the West, it is helpful to see it in\ncontrast to the medical and philosophical traditions that preceded it.\nThe most influential Western tradition prior to biomedicine is the Hippocratic tradition\u2014the views attributed\nto Hippocrates and over two millennia of re-interpretations, riffs,\namendments, and other alterations. At the core of Hippocratic medicine\nwere two views. First, it made a commitment to methodological\nnaturalism\u2014a refusal to attribute disease processes to the work\nof gods and other supernatural beings (Conrad, Neve, Nutton, Porter,\n& Wear 1995). Though, it is worth noting that for much of that\nhistory, elements of astrology, talismans, and some forms of magic\nwere understood as essentially natural phenomena (e.g., the sun\nobviously affects health via sunburns and such, so it is not absurd to\nhave inferred that planets could have their own subtle effects on\nbodies too). Second, it understood health as a matter of\nbalance\u2014and disease as a matter of imbalance\u2014of the\nhumors. Humoral theory was interpreted in many different ways, but\ncentered on the idea that heath and disease are attributable to the\ninteractions of anatomical humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and\nblack bile), which were in turn directly tied to a much larger\ncosmology of the elements (e.g., blood is linked to air, the\nspringtime, a combination of heat and moisture, the heart, and the\nastrological influence of the planet Jupiter) (see additional internet\nresources below) (Conrad et al., 1995).\n\nThere is long-standing debate in health policy over exactly how\nsuccessful the biomedical model has been over its relatively short\nhistorical trajectory. The growth of the biomedical model in Western\ncountries occurred at the same time as other social and economic\ntransformations (industrialization, urbanization, globalization, etc.)\nand at the same time as improvements in life expectancy and a large\nnumber of disease outcomes. The \u2018received view\u2019 of these\nhistorical relations is that social and economic changes allowed the\ngrowth of biomedicine, which in turn created new institutions,\nprofessional health care practices, and technologies that, in turn,\ncaused vast improvements in health outcomes for the populations served\nby biomedical institutions. Penicillin is the go-to example for\nillustrating the positive health impacts of biomedicine (L\u00f6wy\n2011). It is a medicine extracted from nature (mold), made into a\nwidely available \u2018magic bullet\u2019 thanks to biomedical\ntechniques of identifying its active components, and manufacturing\ncontrolled doses of it at reasonable cost at massive scale. Suffering\nand death from bacterial infections was rapidly alleviated; once\nhopeless diseases were suddenly curable with a few (usually) benign pills.\n\nThomas McKeown was an influential critic of the biomedical institution\n(including the work done during its early twentieth century\nprehistory), having authored the blockbuster volume The Role of\nMedicine: Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis (1976). McKeown reevaluated\nthe historical record and available evidence to instead hypothesize\nthat the social and economic changes in the West were more responsible\nfor the health improvements than biomedicine\u2019s growth. Put\nbluntly, he argued that twentieth century modernity (economic development, improved nutrition, etc.) caused\npopulations in the West to get healthier over time, then modernity went on to also cause the growth of\ncontemporary medicine/biomedicine, but the medical advances themselves played a generally secondary role in\nsupporting the health improvements. His works has inspired decades\nworth of debates over the validity of his bold claims, which have been\nlargely overturned or largely vindicated, depending on whom one asks\n(Link & Phelan 2002).\n\nHealth theorist Nancy Krieger shows how the activity of finding ratios\nof how much biomedical healthcare vs. socioeconomic environment\ncontributed to health improvements since the twentieth century is the\nsort of debate that easily falls victim to the \u201cfallacy of\ntreating causes of population health as if they sum to 100%\u201d\n(Krieger 2017). Causes overlap and interact in complex ways; e.g.,\nindividual diet, exercise, medications, and changing exposures to\nsmoking, etc. have all been contributing to changes in heart disease\nrates. How much of the credit goes to biomedicine for studying the\neffects of exercise on heart attack risk, for helping make the case\nfor the heart risks of smoking, and so on? Extracting and assessing\nthe contributions of biomedicine, an enterprise fully embedded in\nWestern countries\u2019 social systems and economies, is not\npossible; biomedicine is firmly embedded. That is not to deny it is\nimpossible to attribute health effects in particular populations to\nparticular causes in general\u2014there are methods allowing such\ncalculations\u2014just that causes\u2019 interactions need to be\ntaken into consideration (Krieger 2017).\n2. Ontological and Metaphysical Commitments in Biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine is built around a conception of disease as a disfunction\nof particular physical parts (organs, tissues, cells) of the body.\nDespite being hegemonic in the global research community,\nbiomedicine\u2019s ontological and metaphysical commitments are not\nself-evident, historically long-lived, nor universally embraced. In\ncontrasting Classical Chinese Medicine with biomedicine, Lee explains\nthat biomedicine is set apart by \n\n\nthe metaphysical thesis that only what is ascertainable by means of\nthe five senses and by extension the use of instrumentation is real\nand exists \n\n\nand a connected epistemic claim that legitimate health knowledge must\ncome to us via those means (Lee 2017: 2).\n2.1 Ontology of the body and life in biomedicine\n\nWhat makes patients and their bodies special? Some philosophers of\nbiomedicine have attempted to make headway in this question by\nprovocatively asking what it means for biomedical sciences to be\n\u2018chauvinist\u2019 and whether this is proper. Biomedical\ndiscussions are in large part defined by what they exclude from\ndiscussion. Curiously, there are two sides to the coin of biological\nchauvinism: one that directly supports the biomedical framework and\none that challenges it. Both help shed light on the relationship\nbetween biology and medicine.\n\nBroadbent (2009) uses the helpful term, \u201cbiological\nchauvinism\u201d to describe the way that biomedicine actively\nexcludes consideration of entities and processes that don\u2019t fit\ninto its worldview: \u201ca refusal to countenance causes of ill\nhealth that are not biological\u201d (Broadbent 2009: 305).\nBiological chauvinists might appeal to ontological or epistemic\ncommitments, e.g., the assumption that knowledge of the body is\nnothing but knowledge of organic chemical processes, and any processes\nnot clearly reducible to such terms are not yet worthy of being given\nfull consideration. But the strongest case for this chauvinism rests\nmore on pragmatic grounds than on such philosophical assumptions.\nBiomedicine has built itself into a massive global institution and\nresearch enterprise while operating under that assumption (to repeat\nKrieger\u2019s phrasing from\n Section 1.1,\n the assumption is that \u201cthe domain of disease and its causes is\nrestricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical\nphenomena\u201d (Krieger 2011: 130)). This is a powerful argument,\nthough it cuts both ways;\n Section 5\n discusses critiques attempting to undercut the value of what\nbiomedicine has indeed built while operating under that approach.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, \u201cbiochauvinism\u201d is the term\napplied to the view that there is something philosophically unique\nabout biological organisms\u2014due to their basic nature and/or the\nlimitations of human knowledge\u2019s access to them\u2014that makes\nthem the biological world fundamentally unlike the rest of the world\n(Wolfe 2015). Vitalism\u2014the view that life has some animating\nentity (along the lines of spirit) that animates matter into a living\nbeing\u2014is one form of such biochauvinism (Wolfe 2015). Another\nform of biochauvinism is the use of phenomenology to assert that human\nlived experience partly operates within a space-time context that is\ndifferent from that of a rock (Wolfe 2015). Wolfe finds that sort of\nview inside the influential phenomenological work of\n Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n (Wolfe 2015) (See\n Section 5\n on phenomenology). Thus there are two rather opposite senses in which\nwe can chauvinistically hold that the biological world is special:\n\n a specialness through what life excludes (medicine is\nnothing but applied biology) or \n a specialness through what life includes (an intangible\nvital spirit; a unique frame of time and space). \n\n\nVersion (1) of biomedicine is consistent with biomedicine and version\n(2) generally is not. The fact that the valorizing of biology can cut\nboth ways helps to show, though, that biomedicine has staked out a\nsort of middle ground by insisting that understanding health and\nmedicine is accomplished through understanding the innumerable\nsubtleties of biological processes and substances, but that those\nbiological processes and substances must not be so subtle or\nmysterious as to become untethered from properties and processes\ncondoned by physics and chemistry.\n\nPut another way, the biomedical framework of the body can be\nunderstood by considering what it excludes: spirit, vitality, and any\nother entity or property unknown to mainstream physicists or chemists.\nThe concept\n Physicalism\n is closely related, but the term is perhaps not a perfect fit since\nit has taken on conceptual connotations and baggage through its use by\nanalytic philosophers of metaphysics. The connection is that in the\npsychological biosciences, the \u201chard problem of\nconsciousness\u201d looms over everything: \n\n\nIt is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but\nwe have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should\nphysical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems\nobjectively unreasonable that it should, and yet it does. (Chalmers\n1995) \n\n\nWhile the human mind and consciousness attract a special sense of awe,\nthe hard problem of consciousness is not all that different from the\nproblems facing attempts to make sense of the patient as a whole.\nPatients live; their bodies function every second of the day,\nvia an astounding series of interconnected processes. It stretches the\nimagination to think that a vital spirit or such is giving unity to\neach life (human or non-); it stretches the imagination in another way\nto think that we humans are simply skin bags of chemical\nreactions.\n2.2 Biomedical conceptions of health and disease\n\nThe preceding section on purpose in biomedicine leads directly to the\nrelated issue of how health and disease are conceptualized in\nbiomedicine. This is something that will only be dealt with very\nbriefly here, in part to avoid duplicating the content in the entry on\n Concepts of Health and Disease.\n Debates over the meaning of health and disease\u2014including how\nthe two are connected\u2014are central to philosophy of medicine.\nThis entry will not attempt to summarize that complex literature, and\nrather focus on how conceptions of health and disease relate to\nbiomedicine, including related disputes over how disease relates to\ndisability justice matters, and ways in which purportedly objective\nbiomedical conceptions of disease can be co-opted for dubious\npurposes.\n\nOf the different philosophical accounts of health and disease,\nChristopher Boorse\u2019s naturalistic Biostatistical Theory (BST) of\ndisease gives the account that is perhaps most tightly linked with the\nphilosophical commitments of biomedicine. Boorse\u2019s revised\naccount of the BST states:\n\n\nThe reference class is a natural class of organisms of\nuniform functional design; specifically, an age group of a sex of a\nspecies.\nA normal function of a part or process within members of\nthe reference class is a statistically typical contribution by it to\ntheir individual survival [or] reproduction.\nHealth in a member of the reference class is normal\nfunctional ability: the readiness of each internal part to\nperform all its normal functions on typical occasions with at least\ntypical efficiency.\nA disease [later, pathological condition] is a\ntype of internal state which impairs health, i.e., reduces\none or more functional abilities below typical efficiency (Boorse 2014:\n684, amending Boorse 1977: 562).\n\n\n\nThe idea is that we can wield insights of biochemistry, pathology, and\nevolutionary biology to together yield an objective means of\n\u2018reading\u2019 nature to tell us which states are pathological\nor diseased states, without the interference of messy and culturally\nrooted/biased evaluations. One line of rebuttal is that there is no\nprincipled way of objectively choosing a reference class against which\nto judge that a given part or process is falling short (my blood sugar\nlevels are objectively too high compared to\u2026what exactly?)\n(Kingma 2014). Even if that problem is resolvable, Krueger argues that\nan objective set of criteria for defining states as pathological or\nnot would be a very limited accomplishment. Knowing that my blood\nsugar levels are objectively pathological does not really tell me much\nabout what, if anything, I or my physician ought to do about that\n(Krueger 2015).\n\nFraught as it is to approach health via the functioning of components\nin the body, it is also quite conceptually difficult to measure health\nin a broader sense. Biomedical science practitioners tend to get\ntwisted into conceptual and epistemic knots when attempting to measure\ngeneral/overall health or well-being in a population (Hausman 2015).\nOne key philosophical dispute among health scientists engaged in\npatient health measurement activities is over what sorts/amounts of\nknowledge patients have about their own health states, and how this\nknowledge ought to be accessed (McClimans forthcoming). How much can\nwe glean about a patient\u2019s physical comfort by asking them to\nrate their level of pain on a scale of 1\u201310? How do we solicit\nsuch information without repeating unethical patterns of trust or\nmistrust, rooted in racist/sexist/etc. stereotypes about patients\n(Buchman, Ho, & Goldberg 2017)?\n\nThe notion of disease is biological malfunction is also tied to a pair\nof critiques of the \u201cmedical model\u201d of disability and of\n\u201cmedical model\u201d of mental health. Both models are\ncriticized for reducing the complexities of disability or\npsychological welfare to only the individual-level signs, symptoms,\nand variables recognized by biomedicine (see:\n Disability: Definitions, Models, Experience).\n As traced in Hogan\u2019s history of the concept, the medical model\nis either critiqued as insufficiently attentive to other dimensions\n(especially the social dynamics that drastically shape the relevant\nhealth experiences) or oppressive (since the model empowers biomedical\nexperts to unilaterally dictate the disability/psychiatric categories,\nrelevant evidence, diagnoses, treatments, etc.) (Hogan 2019). This is\nin part a dispute over functioning since debates over normality,\ndifference, and pathology depend on whether/how we commit to the\nnotion that bodies or parts thereof have functions at all. If\none\u2019s legs do not perform the function of walking, are the legs\npathological? Is the person with those legs inherently diseased?\nDisabled? Worse off than if they had legs that could walk? One\nsolution is to simply throw out the notion of normal functioning\n(Amundson 2000). Another related option is to embrace pluralism in the\nsense of accepting that the relationship between disability and\nwell-being or health is complex, variable, and dependent on\nindividual and social contingencies (Campbell & Stramondo\n2017).\n\nOne philosophical complication is that a naturalistic concept of\ndisease, like Boorse\u2019s, does not prevent social processes from\naltering the standards and practices of how the boundaries of these\nnatural categories are drawn in practice. Chronic diseases such as\ncardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have been targeted by drug\ncompanies to not only create new treatments but to redraw the\nboundaries between healthy vs. pathological, including boundary zones\nsuch as \u201cprediabetes\u201d (Greene 2006). These efforts are in\npart accomplished via the design of clinical trials, which have the\ndangerous distinction of having very high epistemic value in the\nbiomedical community, while remaining highly susceptible to\nmanipulations to the experimental setup that push the evidence one\ndirection or another (Gonz\u00e1lez-Moreno, Saborido, & Teira\n2015).\n\nWhile a naturalistic concept of disease is the most consistent with\nthe ontological assumptions and methodological practices of\nbiomedicine, that has not prevented biomedicine from accommodating a\ncertain type of dissent from the biomedical tenet that biomedicine\nought to focus on diseases and (only) the biological, chemical, and\nphysical aspects thereof (Krieger 2011: 130). The World Health\nOrganization (WHO)\u2014founded in the same post-World War Two period\nas biomedicine\u2014adopted a holistic positive concept of health at\nits founding. i.e., it said that health is the presence of complete\nwell-being (including mental and social well-being) rather than just\nthe absence of disease. This created a direct tension with the core\ntenets of biomedicine, especially the reduction of disease to a set of\nconcrete observable and measurable physical bases (Valles 2018).\nHistorically, the tension was resolved in the case of the WHO by the\norganization, shortly after its founding, effectively self-suppressing\nthe use of its own definition of health in favor of pursuing a\nnarrower set of initiatives to combat particular diseases (e.g., the\ncelebrated Smallpox Eradication Program) (Irwin & Scali 2007).\nThis seems to have been in part because cold war politics made it\npragmatic to not antagonize the United States with pushing a health\nconcept concerned with \u201csocial\u201d well-being, sounding a bit\nreminiscent of socialism (Irwin & Scali 2007). While a\nWHO-type understanding of health is in genuine tension with the\nphilosophical tenets of biomedicine, the tension is manageable in this\ncase by simply pursuing areas of overlap between the different\nconceptions of disease (e.g., investing in infectious disease-control\nstrategies for a population) while ignoring any purported aspects of\nhealth beyond the absence of pathologies (e.g., declining to invest in\nassessing how human-environment relations contribute to a\npopulation\u2019s happiness or misery).\n3. Epistemology of Biomedicine\n\nThere are philosophical disputes happening at the heart of the\nbiomedical enterprise and those disputes offer a means of\nunderstanding the epistemological dimensions of biomedicine: the\nnature of evidence and knowledge in the framework. The most\ncontentious of those internal biomedicine disputes center on what the\nepistemology of biomedicine ought to be, with the rise of\n\u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d (EBM) being the event that\nprovoked the largest segment of these disputes. By examining the\ndisputes surrounding EBM, we can gain a better understanding of the\nepistemology of biomedicine, as illustrated in work such as\nSolomon\u2019s Making Medical Knowledge (2015).\n\nEvidence-based medicine is a tricky concept, since its name\nmisleadingly raises the question of who is practicing medicine that is\nnot based on evidence (Goldenberg 2006). Instead, the dispute\nis over which evidence is best and how it ought to be used. For\ninstance, physicians will often advise patients on which home\ntreatments to use for minor lower back pain, with individual\nphysicians varying in which treatments they recommend, even aside from\ndifferences in the advice based on differing patient characteristics.\nIbuprofen? Acetaminophen? Heat and/or cold compresses? Exercise? The\nstandard twentieth-century medical response would be to let physician\ngroups (including consensus groups convened for this purpose) lay out\nthe options and perhaps use their collective expertise to make a\nrecommendation, but giving great leeway to individual physicians to\nuse their individual accumulated expertise to choose another of the\navailable options seen as viable options by their peers. EBM instead\ntreats this as a matter to be largely decided by empirical research.\nI.e., we ought to run randomized control trial experiments that\ncompare the efficacy of alternative options by randomly assigning\npatients with lower back pain into Treatment A or\nTreatment B\u2014controlling for the single\nvariable\u2014and measure the effects on patients using predetermined\nmetrics (change in reported pain severity, incidence of major side\neffects, etc.). After doing multiple experiments we can then do a\n\u201csystematic review and meta-analysis\u201d that compiles the\ndata trends across parallel research studies and helps us build an\nevidence base for creating guidelines for which treatment clinicians\nought to use. Those guidelines dictate the proper default practices,\nwhich individual clinicians can contravene if specific individual\npatient needs are in conflict (e.g., a patient history of not\nresponding well to a certain medication).\n\nEBM began as a self-described Kuhnian scientific revolution of\nbiomedicine\u2014a fundamental change of worldview that is\nincommensurable with the previous one; a paradigm shift\n(Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group 1992). The most fundamental\ndispute between advocates of the EBM movement and skeptics within the\nbiomedical community is, in one sense, over the epistemic and power\nrelationships between the two halves of biomedicine: biology and\nmedicine. In biology, experimental methodologies and attempts to find\ngeneralizable population trends are valued highly; in clinical\nmedicine, the single patient and the clinician\u2019s accumulated\n(and ineffable) expert evaluation of them has long been valued very\nhighly\u2014much attention is paid to that individual patient\u2019s\ncontingencies (the particulars of their body and symptoms), with the\nclinician\u2019s accumulated knowledge and know how being relied on\nwhen determining how to proceed. Evidence-based medicine is not a\nsimplistic adoption of biology principles and their application to\nmedicine; it is not the triumph of biology over medicine in\nbiomedicine. Instead, EBM has helped to draw out deeper disagreements\nabout what it means to do and use biomedical science well.\n\nThere is a large philosophical literature on evidence-based medicine,\nwith the first monograph appearing in 2002 (Goodman 2002). Most of the\nliterature takes at least a partially skeptical stance on EBM\npractitioners\u2019 various hardline stances on evidentiary matters:\nthe suitability of clinicians relying primarily on brief synopses that\nattempt to synthesize massive bodies of evidence (Borgerson 2009); the\nroom for hidden biases in the process of evaluating medical data\n(Stegenga 2011), and more. EBM has also inspired passionate disputes\namong clinicians over how to apply its principles (Berwick 2005;\nGreenhalgh, Snow, Ryan, Rees, & Salisbury 2015). One line of\ncriticism is that its aims are noble, but have been hijacked by bad\nactors, namely corporations that learned to that by getting involved\nin the production of randomized control trial evidence they could sway\nthe evidence for the apparent safety and efficacy of their own\nproducts (Ioannidis 2016). Philosophy of EBM is given extensive\ndiscussion in the entry on\n Philosophy of Medicine,\n and as with the rest of this entry, this entry will avoid needless\nrepetition and keep the focus on biomedicine per se.\n3.1 Epistemology of expertise and experimental clinical data in biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine is in a state of tension, between\n\n a history of resolving evidentiary disputes using mechanistic\nreasoning, consensus, and authority (see, e.g., Solomon [2015] on the\nroles played by \u2018consensus conferences\u2019) vs.\n a recent practice of creating predetermined evidentiary\nranking/\u200bevaluating procedures designed to minimize the ability\nof biased or erratic human judgments to unduly influence the\nresolution of evidentiary disputes. \n\n\nClinical guidelines were once routinely created by what is\npejoratively called GOBSAT: Good Old Boys Sat Around A Table (and\nreached a consensus by talking amongst themselves as leading experts\nin the subject matter). As Greenhalgh puts it, \u201cit is a major\nachievement of the EBM movement that almost no guideline these days is\nproduced by GOBSAT!\u201d (Greenhalgh 2014: 7). It remains a point of\nphilosophical contention just how epistemically different it is to\ngenerate clinical practice guidelines using a consensus-based model\nvs. an evidence-based model, in large part since, no matter what\nevidence is prioritized, a group of experts will ultimately need to\ninterpret the data and make judgment calls on how to generate\npractical guidelines based on the compiled evidence (Djulbegovic &\nGuyatt 2019). Though even the meaning of clinical expertise is itself\nnot clearly defined and agreed upon, a matter further complicated by\nthe way that the meaning of expertise is tangled up with views about\nwhat roles expertise ought to be playing in clinical practice (Wieten\n2018).\n\nEvidence-based medicine prizes certain types of biomedical\nevidence\u2014highly controlled and systematic evidence\u2014more\nhighly than others. But that preference is a matter of much\ncontention. As noted above, experimental evidence from a randomized\nexperiment testing a treatment (a \u201crandomized control\ntrial\u201d) is held as the best sort of evidence: the gold standard.\nThe one exception is that \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d of multiple\nexperimental studies are perhaps a platinum standard better than gold\n(Stegenga 2011), i.e., the thinking goes that the only evidence that\nmight be better than such experimental data is a rigorous quantitative\nstudy rigorously looking for patterns and lessons by analyzing the\nresults many rigorous experimental studies. While the rigidity of EBM\nthinking gets a great deal of criticism, there are elements of the\nEBM\u2019s philosophy that implement the sort of pragmatism that many\ncritics desire, such as an epistemic openness in the community to\nengage in \u201copen-ended critical inquiry\u201d (Goldenberg\n2009).\n3.2 Epistemology of basic and applied science in biomedicine\n\nThe status of laboratory evidence is a major point of contention in\nphilosophy of biomedicine disputes. \u201cBench science\u201d is\noften used as a catchall term in EBM for a wide variety of laboratory\nevidence (biochemistry, pathology, digital models of drug metabolism,\nanimal studies of a treatment, etc.), and that evidence is pushed to\nthe very bottom of the evidence hierarchy (B. Clarke, Gillies, Illari,\nRusso, & Williamson 2014). For example, green tea contains\nepigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which seems to be effective at\nkilling cancer cells in petri dishes and in mice (Eisenstein 2019).\nEBM supporters would be inclined to look down on inferences that green\ntea is therefore a wise anti-cancer home health behavior, until there\nis at least epidemiological evidence that green tea drinkers genuinely\ndo have better cancer outcomes. Even then, EBM supporters would want\nto know if the anti-cancer effects are due to EGCG, some combination\nof multiple components of green tea, or perhaps just the relaxing\nsocial act of having a hot beverage. Biomedicine has always valued the\nsort of research that investigates EGCG in petri dishes, in mice, or\nother models used on the laboratory bench, but the dispute is over how\nreliable one takes that research to be for guiding real medical\ndecisions (ought physicians tell patients to drink green tea?).\n\nThe problem of how highly to value bench science is distinct from the\ngeneral objection to hierarchies of evidence (Bluhm 2005). Even if\nevidence isn\u2019t treated as inherently rankable in value, one key\nphilosophical objection is that much of the biomedical research world\nis treated by EBM as less important than clinical patient experiments,\nor meta-analyses of such experimental data. Solomon explains that this\nposition is in tension with a simultaneous trend in biomedicine, an\nincreased concern with translational medicine (an effort to improve\nthe process of moving candidate treatments from (the laboratory) bench\nto (the patient\u2019s) bedside (Solomon 2011). This effort to better\nmanage the biomedical research enterprise has brought with it, \n\n\na restoration of the recognition that clinical research requires an\nengagement with basic theory (e.g., physiological, genetic,\nbiochemical) and a range of empirical techniques such as bedside\nobservation, laboratory and animal studies. (Solomon 2011: 451) \n\n\nIn an openly conciliatory move, the \u201cEBM+\u201d group of\nphilosophers and clinicians (see\n Other Internet Sources),\n offers a defense of the view that mainstream EBM has erred by\nessentially relegating mechanistic evidence, such as EGCG having\nanti-cancer chemical properties, to a subsidiary role (B. Clarke et\nal. 2014).\n3.3 Epistemology of measurement in biomedicine\n\nWhile epidemiology-focused EBM is partly in tension with most of the\nrest of laboratory-focused biomedicine\u2014needing it but seeing it\nas in service to randomized control trials on patients\u2014both EBM\nand other branches of biomedicine are united by a valuing of precise\nmeasurement. While precise measurement is achievable in the\nbiochemistry lab, the practical and philosophical challenges are\nthornier when doing measurement at the level of the whole person or\nthe population. What is well-being (Alexandrova 2017)? By\nwhat standards can we call a population healthy (Hausman 2015)? What\nsorts of social structures, policies, and interventions are effective\nfor promoting health (Valles 2018)? How do we identify which subgroups\nare left out of the benefits and prevent injustices being done to them\n(Maglo 2010, 2012)? What sorts of values are at stake when we debate\nbiomedical evidence surrounding culturally issues such as birthing\npractices (McClimans 2017)? A common theme shared by these critiques\nis a concern about the fickleness and contingency of measurement\nleaving much room for practitioners\u2019 values and motivations to\nshape the results of the measurement process, for good or for ill.\n\nThe biomedical quest for precise and objective measurements leaves\nsome unsatisfied with the little room left for patient input in\nclinical care decision-making. What roles are there for patient input\nin the process of deciding the best course of treatment (Chin-Yee\n& Upshur, 2018)? According to critiques, by trying to sideline\nsubjective factors in medical care and replace them with increasingly\nobjective factors, EBM especially (even among than other biomedical\nperspectives), risks losing the humanistic aspects of medicine, an\nethical loss and an epistemic loss. By treating patients\u2019\ndesires, goals, and values as largely irrelevant or a source of\ninterference with an objective process, EBM loses sight of medicine as\na means of helping real humans\u2019 real problems. Relatedly, by\nshutting the patient out of the process, the notion of the best or\nright treatment becomes hollowed out (McClimans forthcoming).\n\nIn the background is the important\u2014and\nmeta-epistemic\u2014problem that physicians are not educated to be\ncomfortable with uncertainty, and what to do in an objective\nmeasurement-focused field when one finds oneself lacking the desired\nevidence: inconclusive tests, treatments designed for patients unlike\nthe one being treated, etc. The very topic of uncertainty is\nconspicuously absent from medical education (Tonelli & Upshur\n2019).\n3.4 Reductionism in epistemology of biomedicine\n\nIn biomedicine, it appears much of medicine is reduced to applied\nbiology\u2014patients are just biochemical substances processes and\nmedical knowledge is just a complicated form of biological knowledge.\nKeating and Cambrosio see the relationship between this reductionism\nin biomedicine (the reducing of medicine to biology) as more a matter\nof the two being aligned for complex historical and philosophical\nreasons, instead of that reductionism being philosophically central to\nbiomedicine (Keating & Cambrosio 2003). According to them, after\nWorld War Two, the fields of biology and pathology negotiated the\ncreation of \u201cthe institutional and epistemic hybrid we call\nbiomedicine,\u201d and neither component of this hybrid rules the\nother (Keating & Cambrosio 2003, p. 368). They see this as\nundermining claims of biomedicine being reductionist because such\nassertions implicitly or explicitly mean that (micro)biology gets\nepistemic priority because it is the true and stable foundation.\n\nPart of the challenge is that there are multiple varieties of\n Reductionism in Biology.\n And there are a number of different reductionism disputes in biology,\nand the overlaps with biomedicine vary\u2014e.g., Rosenberg\u2019s\ndefense of reductionism in genetics overlaps with biomedicine in the\narea of medical genetics (Rosenberg 2006). As discussed in\n Section 1,\n it is very difficult to tell the difference between the core\ncomponents of biomedicine and the bits of\nphilosophy/technology/sociology that aren\u2019t inherently part of\nbiomedicine, but have gotten tangled up in it. The rationale for\nreductionism in biomedicine is explained with great care by\nAndersen:\n\n\nBeing able to successfully take a disease as complex as sickle cell\nanemia or Parkinson\u2019s and reduce it to a single genetic error\nthat cascades through various systems, even if that reduction holds\nfor only a proper subset of cases, illustrates that reduction can be a\npowerful tool for research and explanation in medicine. It cannot be\nthe only tool in the toolkit, since some diseases or dysfunctions may\nbe only partially reducible, or for which only some cases are\nreducible. But it is a good working assumption, as Oppenheim and\nPutnam put it, in tackling a problem with an unknown etiology, to look\nfor ways to reduce it to a few or even a single causal driver at a\nmolecular level (Andersen 2016: 86).\n\n\nIn other words, the potential for success and record of prior\nsuccesses is an argument for at least operating under the assumption\nthat biomedical scholars ought to continue treating biomedical\nmysteries as biochemical puzzles for which the relevant pieces have\nnot yet been identified or assembled.\n\nReductionism in biomedicine has been targeted by some committed\ncritics. For instance, Marcum explains that the process of reducing\nthe body to such component parts yields a vision of the body as\nmachine, a radically dehumanizing move.\n\n\nFrom the biomechanical point of view, the patient\u2019s body is\noften perceived as a material object that can be reduced to a system\nof physical parts. That body is viewed as a machine composed of\nindividual body parts, which can be fixed or exchanged with new parts,\nwhen broken. By reducing the patient\u2019s body to an assemblage of\nbody parts, the patient qua person vanishes (Marcum 2005:\n318).\n\n\nWhile the critique stands on its own, it remains an open question what\nother view ought to be adopted if not a reductionist biomechanical\none. Marcum contrasts the view most directly to phenomenological\nviews\u2014which will be discussed in\n Section 5\u2014arguing\n that a phenomenological approach is better suited to advancing\nmedicine, which he presents as being in a state of crisis.\n\nEBM\u2019s reliance on randomized control trials as a cornerstone of\nhealth data collection doubles down on the general reductionism of\nbiomedicine. Randomized control trials assume that health variables\ncan be observed, manipulated and controlled as largely independent\nunits. Yet, is a well-established problem that we simply don\u2019t\nknow all of the variables that might confound a clinical experiment\n(Worrall 2007), so randomization can at most hope that the\n\u2018confounders\u2019 (e.g., unknown dietary factors that affect\nmetabolization of a drug) are randomly distributed between the\ndifferent treatment populations in an experiment. Taking the\nreductionism a step further, the goal of exactly measuring the\ndifferences between Treatment A and Treatment B\nrequires EBM to only look for effects that are precisely measurable in\nthe first place. This limitation is a deeply-rooted problem since even\nthe official list of clinical signs and symptoms of a given disease\ncan diverge from accumulated patient observations, and in cases such\nas some psychiatric conditions, the symptoms\u2014or lack\nthereof\u2014are overtly difficult to measure or factor into an\nassessment of treatment efficacy (e.g., one\u2019s sense of self\nand/or emotional life) (Kendler 2016).\n\nWhile reductionist and antireductionist approaches are in direct\nopposition, it is possible to take a pluralistic stance toward them:\nboth can be welcomed into health science. For instance, this is the\nposition taken by Campaner (2010). Though, as discussed in the next\nsection, the power of the biomedical institution makes it such that\nbiomechanical reductionist approaches can easily overwhelm alternative\nviews.\n4. Biomedicine as an Institution\n\nThe disputes over biomedicine\u2019s virtues and flaws are tied to\nthe other aspects of Western cultural-political-economic influence\nthat coevolved with it, and travelled with it around the globe. The\ndynamics between the institution of biomedicine\u2014rooted in\nwealthy Western countries\u2014and low/middle-income countries is in\npart a manifestation of the philosophical complexities of the\ninternational political scene. See, for instance, the literature on\n International Distributive Justice.\n\nAs discussed in\n Section 1.2,\n biomedicine co-evolved with the West\u2019s social and economic\ninstitutions in the aftermath of World War Two. Of particular\nimportance, the individualism of Western capitalism has meshed with\nbiomedicine\u2019s ontological view of the body as effectively\nseparable from its social context. Briggs and Hallin describe the how\ncontemporary media and biomedicine work to coproduce public knowledge\nabout health and disease, a process they dub biomediatization (Briggs\n& Hallin 2016).\n\nMetzl and Kirkland\u2019s influential edited volume Against\nHealth: How Health Became the New Morality lays out a\nrelated case for how biomedicine exercised undue influence over\nculture, including casting health ills as personal failings deserving\nof public shaming and stigmatization (Metzl & Kirkland 2010). As\nan illustration of the sort of stigmatizing strategies that they\ncondemn as unacceptable, bioethicist Daniel Callahan ethically\nendorsed the social practice of \u2018fat shaming\u2019 as a means\nof promoting public health (Callahan 2016). Empirical arguments on the\nharms of stigmatization (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link 2013), and\ncontrary ethical arguments (Dean 2018), both rebut stigma as an\nethically viable health-promoting intervention.\n\nHealth/body stigma, public rhetoric over health, and moralism about\nhealth behaviors are all subjected to scrutiny in critiques of\n\u2018self-care\u2019 strategies, e.g., telling\n\u2018overweight\u2019/overtired/overworked employees feeling\nstressed by their jobs that they should take better care of themselves\nby doing yoga, more closely monitoring their eating at work, etc. The\ncritique is that the biomedical model can recast social problems\n(including outright abuses\u2014usually capitalist ones) as\nindividual responsibilities. Self-care can go well when it empowers,\nsuch as the Women\u2019s Health Movement of the 1960s and 1970s that\nfought against sexism by calling upon women to know their own bodies\nand value that knowledge (Bueter 2017). Or self-care can become\nregressive when it becomes \n\n\ninner-directed, authoritarian, victim-blaming, manipulated by dominant\nforces, or diversionary from struggles for radical change in both\nmedicine and the broader society. (Sidel & Sidel 1981: 656) \n\n\nIn recent discourse, in which the problem of stress has garnered\nincreased attention, \n\n\ncontrolling the health problems associated with living in stressful\nsituations therefore becomes the responsibility of the\nindividuals\u2014all too often, the responsibility of individuals who\nare already disadvantaged by their economic status, their race, or\ntheir social position more generally. (Kaplan 2019: 116) \n\n\nBiomedicine has been used as one prong of colonial power dynamics\nbetween Western institutions and non-Western peoples (including\nindigenous peoples) (see Millum & Emanuel 2012). Colonial\ngovernments and cultural imperialism have long undermined or directly\nattacked local/indigenous medical frameworks and institutions. And\nsince biomedical education and practice are based on technologies and\neducation from the West, low- and middle-income countries are left\ndependent on wealthy Western countries (Nunn 2009). As a result, local\nwould-be biomedical practitioners often travel to the West for\nbiomedical education and then have little incentive to return to their\nhome countries to practice techniques for which they will have\nrelatively few biomedical tools, lower pay, etc. This raises further\nethical questions related to which entities have which\nindividual/collective responsibilities to address this so-called\n\u2018brain drain\u2019 trend (Yuksekdag forthcoming). Meanwhile,\nnon-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross offer medical\naid, but generally in the form of sending temporary trained personnel\nfrom the West, rather than building local capacity for medical\ntraining and practice. And well-meaning Western biomedical students\ntravel to the same low- and middle-income countries, with limited\nbiomedical skills and little or no knowledge of the populations or\nhealth needs, seeking to help populations assumed to be incapable of\nhelping themselves (Pinto & Upshur 2009).\n5. Alternative Frameworks\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this entry, critiques of biomedicine tend\nto focus on elements of biomedicine rather than the whole. There are\nexceptions to this. This section will review some of the frameworks\nthat have been offered in place of biomedicine, though they vary in\nhow similar they remain to the biomedical framework. Before delving\ninto the alternative frameworks, it is important to discuss two\nprominent critiques of biomedicine that are influential primarily as\nholistic criticisms and not so much as sources of alternative visions\nof what ought to be offered in place of biomedicine.\n\nMichel Foucault\u2019s\n work, and use of the concepts biopower and biopolitics, remain\ntouchstones for much of the critical discourse surrounding\nbiomedicine. Foucault\u2019s critique of modern medicine is part of a\ncareer critiquing other aspects of modernity, including the related\ntopic of psychiatry. His famous work The Birth of the Clinic\nis written as a history, though in the process it highlighted aspects\nof biomedicine that other scholars went on to critique as well, either\nbased on his critique or in parallel to it: dehumanization,\nreductionism, measurement and observation methods of dubious value,\nand the problem of the biomedicine\u2019s institutional power\n(Foucault 1963 [2002]).\n\nIvan Illich\u2019s Medical Nemesis is perhaps the most\ninfluential critique of biomedicine (Illich 1976). It combines\ncritiques of (bio)medicine for failing at its own goals (iatrogenic\ndisease\u2014harms caused by medical treatment\u2014are a large\ncomponent) and for having the wrong goals in the first place (he\nvalorizes death, disease, and pain as proper components of the human\nexperience rather than enemies to be automatically and constantly\nopposed).\n5.1 Traditional healing practices\n\n\u201cComplementary, alternative, or integrative medicine\u201d is\nbiomedicine\u2019s \u2018big tent\u2019 category for non-biomedical\nsystems of health care (see NCCIH in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Philosophers have pointed out that biomedicine, specifically\nevidence-based medicine, puts advocates of such non-biomedical systems\ninto a no-win position. One such philosophical challenge is that some\nof the claims made by non-biomedical systems are claimed to be\nnon-measurable experiences, e.g., the experience of Qi life\nforce in traditional Chinese Medicine (Tonelli & Callahan 2001).\nThis means that advocates have to either submit to the epistemological\nframework of biomedicine (which may be incapable of assessing some of\nthe effects claimed to exist), or refusing to play by medicine\u2019s\nrules and hence being dismissed by as quackery by biomedicine.\nEpistemically, it seems like the latter option is the better option,\nbut it would require advocates to \u201cwork to develop new research\ndesigns and new standards of evidence that reflect their approach to\nmedical care\u201d (Borgerson 2005: 502).\n\nClassical Chinese Medicine (CCM) remains practiced in communities\naround the world, and Lee draws out two core philosophical differences\nbetween CCM and biomedicine. First, CCM has \n\n\na process ontology\u2014it considers causal relationships between\nevents and processes to be foundational, rather than things.\nFurthermore, it implies complex causal relationships between events\nand processes which may be said to be multi-factorial and non-linear.\n(Lee 2017: 2) \n\n\nSecond, it is holistic \n\n\nthe universe and everything in it, including human beings, constitute\nwholes which are different from the sum of their parts, and which in\nturn are related and as well as inter-related with other wholes. (Lee\n2017: 2) \n\n\nIt is within this philosophical system that treatments such as\nacupuncture and herbal/dietary remedies are used. While the gulf\nbetween biomedicine and CCM is wide, it is not entirely dissimilar\nfrom some Western scientific practices: CCM\u2019s approach to health\nand the human body bear some resemblances to the ways that\nepidemiologists approach populations\u2019 health and how ecologists\napproach ecosystems. Among other similarities, in both fields there is\ngreat respect for balance and dynamic interconnected processes (Lee\nforthcoming).\n\nAyurvedic medicine takes a somewhat similarly holistic and\nbalance-oriented approach to the person and their health (Rastogi,\n2014) (note also that holistic bodily balance is central to the\nHippocractic medicine described in\n Section 1.2).\n One way that manifests in Ayurvedic practice\u2014in contrast with\nbiomedicine\u2014is that the biological characteristics of two\nindividuals might be similar but their recommended treatments might be\nquite different. For instance, while biomedicine routinely hands out\nstandardized advice on what sorts of foods are best for someone of a\ngiven age and sex, Ayurvedic medicine rejects the assumption that such\nstandardization within a single age-sex grouping is even a good\ndefault. Other factors play larger roles than in biomedicine,\nincluding bodily changes over the course of the day and one\u2019s\n(internal) body type (affecting how one metabolizes specific foods,\netc.). Complicating matters is that Ayurvedic medicine grew as a part\nof Hinduism in South Asia, and Hinduism itself is a substantially\nheterogeneous family of beliefs/practices that vary between\ncommunities (Desai 1988).\n5.2 Narrative and phenomenological approaches\n\nAmong the numerous humanistic critiques of biomedicine, coming from\nthe broad field of medical humanities (for an overview, see Marcum\n2008), philosophers have paid particular attention to narrative and\nphenomenology (Ferry-Danini 2018).\n\nNarrative medicine offers a revision to the biomedical model\nalternative based around the centrality of the story or narrative in\nhuman life (Charon 2006). This notion that narrative is central to\nhuman experience offers a variety of potential operationalizations in\nclinical biomedical practice. For instance, it places additional value\non the patient consultation and asks for improved active listening\nskills among clinicians, who must learn to elicit, receive, and\nunderstand patients\u2019 stories about their health conditions. Such\nlistening has many potential benefits, including the potential to\nunderstand the meaning(s) of what human dignity means for a given\npatient, an important benefit given that biomedical settings are known\nfor being \u201cdehumanizing\u201d (Parsons & Hooker 2010).\nThough, the proposition that humans are indeed narrative beings has\nitself been disputed (Woods 2011).\n\nAs shown by Carel, phenomenology\u2019s value to medicine comes from\nits insistence on taking illness seriously (Carel 2016).\n\n\n\u2026we must enlist philosophical analysis in order to fully\nappreciate the existential transformation illness brings about. This\ntransformation cannot be accounted for as merely physical or mental\n(in the case of psychiatric disorder) dysfunction. Rather, there is a\nneed for a view of personhood as embodied, situated, and enactive, in\norder to explain how local changes to the ill person\u2019s body and\ncapacities modify her existence globally (Carel 2016: 14).\n\n\nBiomedicine takes illness seriously, but the philosophical framework\nof biomedicine leaves no space for the notions of existential\ntransformation as part of illness\u2014disease is reduced to the\nstate of a system in which there are malfunctioning parts (pathologies\nin body parts). See also the discussion of phenomenology in\n Section 3.4.\n5.3 Gentle medicine and population health framework approaches\n\nStegenga has argued in favor of \u201cgentle medicine,\u201d a\nconservative treatment mindset that stands in contrast to the\nbiomedical pursuit of ever-more interventions (Stegenga 2018)\u2014a\npill for each ailment. This is in one sense a challenge to biomedicine\nmore in quantity than in quality; he does not advocate for switching\nfrom pills to naturopathic diet-based treatments. He recommends this\n(purportedly gentler) conservatism as a response to an epistemic\ndevaluing of biomedicine knowledge which he calls: \u201cmedical\nnihilism\u2026the view that we should have little confidence in the\neffectiveness of medical interventions\u201d (Stegenga 2018: 1). This\nfollows in the loose tradition of other writings, such as the text by\nIllich discussed at the start of\n Section 5\n (Illich 1976). But Stegenga\u2019s critique and replacement remains\na radical challenge to biomedicine in the sense that it undercuts the\nepistemic practices of biomedicine and pushes back on the\ninstitutional practices (and the related infrastructure, including\nmassive pharmaceutical companies) by arguing that (bio)medical\ntreatments ought to be applied sparingly.\n\nValles offers an alternative\u2014the population health\nframework\u2014that partly meshes with Stegenga\u2019s concluding\nsuggestion that \u201cgentle medicine\u201d ought to be accompanied\nby interventions that refocus health promotion efforts on social\ndeterminants of health, including \u201cclean drinking water, better\nnutrition, and greater socio-economic equality\u201d (Stegenga 2018:\n198). Valles expounds and defends the merits of the population health\nframework, a view developed in response to frustrations with\nbiomedicine that coalesced in the 1990s in Canada as an alternative\ntheoretical framework, before expanding internationally (Evans, Barer,\n& Marmor 1994; Valles 2018). The population health framework is\nnot nihilistic about medical care, but rather seeks to decenter\nmedicine and healthcare in the overall pursuit of health; most of the\nproblems and most promising solutions to ill health lay outside the\nscope of biomedicine (safer workplaces, an end to racist housing\ndiscrimination, neighborhoods where people can safely walk, socialize\nand play, etc.) (Valles 2018).\n",
