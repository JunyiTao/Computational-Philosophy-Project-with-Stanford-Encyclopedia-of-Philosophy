    "main_text": "Critiques of operationalism || Are operations private or public?\n2.4 Are operations private or public?\n\nOne last issue needs to be mentioned, before I complete the discussion\nof the critique of operationalism: the privacy of operations. This is\nperhaps not widely remembered now, but it was the issue on which\nBridgman\u2019s position elicited the most severe incomprehension and\nobjection, even from many who called themselves operationalists.\n\nThe emblematic moment in this dispute came during the 5th\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science in 1939, held at\nHarvard University\u2014one of the highpoints of the activities of\nthe \u201cVienna Circle in exile\u201d in America (see Holton\n1995b). Bridgman was invited to address this conference, and chose to\ngive a talk entitled \u201cScience: Public or\n Private?\u201d.[4]\n At this point it became clear that his enterprise was fundamentally\nat odds with the logical positivist project, despite the surface\nkinship:\n\nThe process that I want to call scientific is a process that involves\nthe continual apprehension of meaning, the constant appraisal of\nsignificance, accompanied by a running act of checking to be sure that\nI am doing what I want to do, and of judging correctness or\nincorrectness. This checking and judging and accepting that together\nconstitute understanding are done by me, and can be done for me by no\none else. They are as private as my toothache, and without them\nscience is dead. (Bridgman 1955, 56)\n\n\nPositivists and behaviorists had embraced operationalism for precisely\nthe opposite reason: they thought operations were public, objective\nand verifiable, unlike private experience. But Bridgman was insistent\nthat operations were a matter for private experience. He could see no\nwarrant in simply taking someone else\u2019s testimony as true or\nreliable, or in regarding the report of an operation performed by\nsomeone else as the same kind of thing as an operation performed and\nexperienced by himself. In a later paper called \u201cNew Vistas for\nIntelligence\u201d he declared: \u201cScience is not truly objective\nunless it recognizes its own subjective or individual aspects\u201d\n(Bridgman 1955, 556). As Holton puts it (2005, 74), Bridgman\u2019s\ndrive in operational analysis was \u201cto throw the spotlight on\nperformable action, above all an action performed by himself.\nUltimately, he was a private man, so much so that he was accused of\nsolipsism, to which he scarcely objected.\u201d In his epistemic\nindividualism Bridgman was perhaps only matched by Herbert Dingle, the\nfounder of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, among\nnotable 20th-century philosophers of science (see Dingle 1950).\n\nBridgman\u2019s individualistic bent, both in epistemology and social\nlife, was in stark contrast to the logical positivist vision of\nknowledge and society, particularly the strand of positivism driven by\nOtto Neurath (1882\u20131945). The latter\u2019s aversion to the\nprivate compelled him to express even first-hand observation reports\nas third-person happenings in space and time, of the following type:\n\u201cOtto\u2019s protocol at 3:17 o\u2019clock: [Otto\u2019s\nspeech-thinking at 3:16 o\u2019clock was: (at 3:15 o\u2019clock\nthere was a table in the room perceived by Otto)].\u201d (Neurath\n1932\u201333 [1983, p. 93]). Bridgman was unyielding in his\nopposition to Neurath\u2019s type of objectification of personal\nexperience. To him, operations provided the best possible refuge from\nthe ocean of uncertainty always threatening to engulf science, and the\nrelative certainty was only possible if he was learning from his own\noperations, not from second-hand reports from some other person. In\nthis regard Bridgman was closer to the strand of logical positivism\nrepresented by Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936), who insisted on\nmaintaining the notion of direct experience as the final arbiter of\nknowledge. Schlick (1930 [1979]) admitted that experience was fleeting\nand only provided momentary points of verification rather than any\nlasting \u201cfoundation\u201d one could build knowledge on.\nBridgman\u2019s operations had more promise in this regard, as the\noperations were meant to be repeatable so the descriptions of\noperations and their results would be lasting. However, that was not\nto be such a straightforward matter, as we will see in Section\n3.4.\n\nAs Holton (1995a; 2005) reports from his first-hand observations, the\nprivacy of operations (and the consequent privacy of science) was not\nan idle philosophical doctrine for Bridgman. In the lab he carried out\nas much of the work as possible with his own hands, using few\nassistants and crafting most of his instruments himself. Holton\n(1995a, 222\u2013223) quotes the following report as typical of the\nway Bridgman worked: \u201cIt is easy, if all precautions are\nobserved, to drill a hole \u2026 17 inches long, in from 7 to 8\nhours\u201d\u2014that is, a hole as narrow as the lead in a pencil,\nin a block of very hard steel. In academic life Bridgman (1955, 44)\nopenly lamented the \u201cintellectual fashion \u2026 of\nemphasizing that all our activities are fundamentally social in\nnature\u201d. As for his social and political writings, they were\noften agonizing attempts to clarify, for himself, the place of the\n\u201cintelligent individual\u201d in society. He was unabashedly\nelitist, both on behalf of the gifted individual and of scientists as\na group, and argued that giving appropriate special treatment to\nscientists would in the end benefit society (that is, all the\nindividuals in society). Maila Walter observes (1990, 192\u2013193):\n\u201cWithin the community of scientists and scientific philosophers,\nBridgman had become the lone spokesman for a radical existential\nsubjectivism\u201d, more akin to Rheinhold Niebuhr\u2019s\nexistentialist theology than to any commonly recognized philosophy of\nscience. Bridgman\u2019s uncompromising individualism continued right\nto the end, with a self-administered euthanasia in the late stage of a\npainful terminal illness (see Holton 1995a, 226\u2013227).\n",
