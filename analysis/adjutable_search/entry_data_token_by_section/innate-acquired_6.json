One is that there has never been an agreed\nscientific definition of an \u201cinstinctive\u201d or\n\u201cinnate\u201d trait. During the late 19th century\nC.L. Morgan noted the proliferation of different definitions of\ninstinct and criticized his contemporaries for their sloppy use of\nlanguage. The same criticisms are echoed in the work of Dunlap,\nBernard, and Kuo, who all complained that imprecision in the\ndefinition of \u201cinstinct\u201d led researchers to draw faulty\ninferences. Lehrman and other critics of the ethological revival of\ninstinct likewise complained that this concept lacked scientific\nprecision.\n\nA second general pattern is that such ambiguity was no barrier to the\nsheer volume of studies claiming to identify instincts. Indeed, it\nmight even be the case that lack of precision in the meaning of this\nterm fostered the growth of the instinct industry in late\n19th and early 20th century. A third general\npattern is the persistent complaint that instinct theorists ignore\nearly or subtle opportunities for learning. Wallace criticized Darwin\nfor failing to consider the influence of experience in early\ndevelopment. The same objection can be found in Kuo\u2019s criticism\nof instinct theory. Lehrman and his fellow critics likewise noted the\nfailure of ethologists to consider possible influences of experience\non development.\n\nDespite this troubled scientific history, versions of nativism\ncontinue to appear in psychology. In this century, Evolutionary\nPsychology has resuscitated a brand of nativism that is strikingly\nreminiscent of the instinct psychology that prevailed in the wake of\nDarwin and James (Hampton 2004). Part of what makes the recurrence of\nnativism philosophically interesting is that many scientists have\nnoted that the innate/acquired distinction is ultimately a false\ndichotomy (Kitcher 2001). All traits are influenced in their\ndevelopment by both environmental and genetic factors.\nWeismann\u2019s insistence on the distinction aside, it is a mistake\nto classify traits as emanating either from the germ line or the\nenvironment. Moreover, ever since Baldwin (1896) it has been thought\nthat complex behavioral adaptations can conceivably become fixed in a\npopulation by a process that relies heavily on experience. What then\nexplains the persistence of the innate/acquired distinction in\npsychology? The following section reviews recent attempts by\nphilosophers to identify what is at issue in disagreements over the\nmeaning and utility of nativism in psychology and biology.\n",
