    "main_text": "Virtues and Deficiencies, Continence and Incontinence\n4. Virtues and Deficiencies, Continence and Incontinence\n\nAristotle distinguishes two kinds of virtue (1103a1\u201310): those\nthat pertain to the part of the soul that engages in reasoning\n(virtues of mind or intellect), and those that pertain to the part of\nthe soul that cannot itself reason but is nonetheless capable of\nfollowing reason (ethical virtues, virtues of character). Intellectual\nvirtues are in turn divided into two sorts: those that pertain to\ntheoretical reasoning, and those that pertain to practical thinking\n(1139a3\u20138). He organizes his material by first studying ethical\nvirtue in general, then moving to a discussion of particular ethical\nvirtues (temperance, courage, and so on), and finally completing his\nsurvey by considering the intellectual virtues (practical wisdom,\ntheoretical wisdom, etc.).\n\nAll free males are born with the potential to become ethically\nvirtuous and practically wise, but to achieve these goals they must go\nthrough two stages: during their childhood, they must develop the\nproper habits; and then, when their reason is fully developed, they\nmust acquire practical wisdom (phron\u00easis). This does\nnot mean that first we fully acquire the ethical virtues, and then, at\na later stage, add on practical wisdom. Ethical virtue is fully\ndeveloped only when it is combined with practical wisdom\n(1144b14\u201317). A low-grade form of ethical virtue emerges in us\nduring childhood as we are repeatedly placed in situations that call\nfor appropriate actions and emotions; but as we rely less on others\nand become capable of doing more of our own thinking, we learn to\ndevelop a larger picture of human life, our deliberative skills\nimprove, and our emotional responses are perfected. Like anyone who\nhas developed a skill in performing a complex and difficult activity,\nthe virtuous person takes pleasure in exercising his intellectual\nskills. Furthermore, when he has decided what to do, he does not have\nto contend with internal pressures to act otherwise. He does not long\nto do something that he regards as shameful; and he is not greatly\ndistressed at having to give up a pleasure that he realizes he should\nforego.\n\nAristotle places those who suffer from such internal disorders into\none of three categories: (A) Some agents, having reached a decision\nabout what to do on a particular occasion, experience some\ncounter-pressure brought on by an appetite for pleasure, or anger, or\nsome other emotion; and this countervailing influence is not\ncompletely under the control of reason. (1) Within this category, some\nare typically better able to resist these counter-rational pressures\nthan is the average person. Such people are not virtuous, although\nthey generally do what a virtuous person does. Aristotle calls them\n\u201ccontinent\u201d (enkrat\u00eas). But (2) others are\nless successful than the average person in resisting these\ncounter-pressures. They are \u201cincontinent\u201d\n(akrat\u00eas). (The explanation of akrasia is a\ntopic to which we will return in section 7.) In addition, (B) there is\na type of agent who refuses even to try to do what an ethically\nvirtuous agent would do, because he has become convinced that justice,\ntemperance, generosity and the like are of little or no value. Such\npeople Aristotle calls evil (kakos, phaulos). He\nassumes that evil people are driven by desires for domination and\nluxury, and although they are single-minded in their pursuit of these\ngoals, he portrays them as deeply divided, because their\npleonexia\u2014their desire for more and more\u2014leaves\nthem dissatisfied and full of self-hatred.\n\nIt should be noticed that all three of these\ndeficiencies\u2014continence, incontinence, vice\u2014involve some\nlack of internal harmony. (Here Aristotle\u2019s debt to Plato is\nparticularly evident, for one of the central ideas of the\nRepublic is that the life of a good person is harmonious, and\nall other lives deviate to some degree from this ideal.) The evil\nperson may wholeheartedly endorse some evil plan of action at a\nparticular moment, but over the course of time, Aristotle supposes, he\nwill regret his decision, because whatever he does will prove\ninadequate for the achievement of his goals (1166b5\u201329).\nAristotle assumes that when someone systematically makes bad decisions\nabout how to live his life, his failures are caused by psychological\nforces that are less than fully rational. His desires for pleasure,\npower or some other external goal have become so strong that they make\nhim care too little or not at all about acting ethically. To keep such\ndestructive inner forces at bay, we need to develop the proper habits\nand emotional responses when we are children, and to reflect\nintelligently on our aims when we are adults. But some vulnerability\nto these disruptive forces is present even in more-or-less virtuous\npeople; that is why even a good political community needs laws and the\nthreat of punishment. Clear thinking about the best goals of human\nlife and the proper way to put them into practice is a rare\nachievement, because the human psyche is not a hospitable environment\nfor the development of these insights.\n",
