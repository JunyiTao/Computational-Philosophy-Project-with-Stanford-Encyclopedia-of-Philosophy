    "main_text": "The Roots of the Realist Tradition || Hobbes\u2019s Anarchic State of Nature\n1.3 Hobbes\u2019s Anarchic State of Nature\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131683) was part of an intellectual movement\nwhose goal was to free the emerging modern science from the\nconstraints of the classical and scholastic heritage. According to\nclassical political philosophy, on which the idealist perspective is\nbased, human beings can control their desires through reason and can\nwork for the benefit of others, even at the expense of their own\nbenefit. They are thus both rational and moral agents, capable of\ndistinguishing between right and wrong, and of making moral choices.\nThey are also naturally social. With great skill Hobbes attacks these\nviews. His human beings, extremely individualistic rather than moral\nor social, are subject to \u201ca perpetual and restless desire of\npower after power, that ceases only in death\u201d\n(Leviathan XI 2). They therefore inevitably struggle for\npower. In setting out such ideas, Hobbes contributes to some of the\nbasic conceptions fundamental to the realist tradition in\ninternational relations, and especially to neorealism. These include\nthe characterization of human nature as egoistic, the concept of\ninternational anarchy, and the view that politics, rooted in the\nstruggle for power, can be rationalized and studied\nscientifically.\n\nOne of the most widely known Hobbesian concepts is that of the\nanarchic state of nature, seen as entailing a state of war\u2014and\n\u201csuch a war as is of every man against every man\u201d (XII 8).\nHe derives his notion of the state of war from his views of both human\nnature and the condition in which individuals exist. Since in the\nstate of nature there is no government and everyone enjoys equal\nstatus, every individual has a right to everything; that is, there are\nno constraints on an individual\u2019s behavior. Anyone may at any\ntime use force, and all must constantly be ready to counter such force\nwith force. Hence, driven by acquisitiveness, having no moral\nrestraints, and motivated to compete for scarce goods, individuals are\napt to \u201cinvade\u201d one another for gain. Being suspicious of\none another and driven by fear, they are also likely to engage in\npreemptive actions and invade one another to ensure their own safety.\nFinally, individuals are also driven by pride and a desire for glory.\nWhether for gain, safety, or reputation, power-seeking individuals\nwill thus \u201cendeavor to destroy or subdue one another\u201d\n(XIII 3). In such uncertain conditions where everyone is a potential\naggressor, making war on others is a more advantageous strategy than\npeaceable behavior, and one needs to learn that domination over others\nis necessary for one\u2019s own continued survival.\n\nHobbes is primarily concerned with the relationship between\nindividuals and the state, and his comments about relations among\nstates are scarce. Nevertheless, what he says about the lives of\nindividuals in the state of nature can also be interpreted as a\ndescription of how states exist in relation to one another. Once\nstates are established, the individual drive for power becomes the\nbasis for the states\u2019 behavior, which often manifests itself in\ntheir efforts to dominate other states and peoples. States, \u201cfor\ntheir own security,\u201d writes Hobbes, \u201cenlarge their\ndominions upon all pretences of danger and fear of invasion or\nassistance that may be given to invaders, [and] endeavour as much as\nthey can, to subdue and weaken their neighbors\u201d (XIX 4).\nAccordingly, the quest and struggle for power lies at the core of the\nHobbesian vision of relations among states. The same would later be\ntrue of the model of international relations developed by Hans\nMorgenthau, who was deeply influenced by Hobbes and adopted the same\nview of human nature. Similarly, the neorealist Kenneth Waltz would\nfollow Hobbes\u2019 lead regarding international anarchy (the fact\nthat sovereign states are not subject to any higher common sovereign)\nas the essential element of international relations.\n\nBy subjecting themselves to a sovereign, individuals escape the war of\nall against all which Hobbes associates with the state of nature;\nhowever, this war continues to dominate relations among states. This\ndoes not mean that states are always fighting, but rather that they\nhave a disposition to fight (XIII 8). With each state deciding for\nitself whether or not to use force, war may break out at any time. The\nachievement of domestic security through the creation of a state is\nthen paralleled by a condition of inter-state insecurity. One can\nargue that if Hobbes were fully consistent, he would agree with the\nnotion that, to escape this condition, states should also enter into a\ncontract and submit themselves to a world sovereign. Although the idea\nof a world state would find support among some of today\u2019s\nrealists, this is not a position taken by Hobbes himself. He does not\npropose that a social contract among nations be implemented to bring\ninternational anarchy to an end. This is because the condition of\ninsecurity in which states are placed does not necessarily lead to\ninsecurity for their citizens. As long as an armed conflict or other\ntype of hostility between states does not actually break out,\nindividuals within a state can feel relatively secure.\n\nThe denial of the existence of universal moral principles and norms in\nthe relations among states brings Hobbes close to the Machiavellians\nand the followers of the doctrine of raison\nd\u2019\u00e9tat. His theory of international relations, which\nassumes that independent states, like independent individuals, are\nenemies by nature, asocial and selfish, and that there is no moral\nlimitation on their behavior, is a great challenge to the idealist\npolitical vision based on human sociability and to the concept of the\ninternational jurisprudence that is built on this vision. However,\nwhat separates Hobbes from Machiavelli and associates him more with\nclassical realism is his insistence on the defensive character of\nforeign policy. His political theory does not put forward the\ninvitation to do whatever may be advantageous for the state. His\napproach to international relations is prudential and pacific:\nsovereign states, like individuals, should be disposed towards peace\nwhich is commended by reason.\n\nWhat Waltz and other neorealist readers of Hobbes\u2019s works\nsometimes overlook is that he does not perceive international anarchy\nas an environment without any rules. By suggesting that certain\ndictates of reason apply even in the state of nature, he affirms that\nmore peaceful and cooperative international relations are possible.\nNeither does he deny the existence of international law. Sovereign\nstates can sign treaties with one another to provide a legal basis for\ntheir relations. At the same time, however, Hobbes seems aware that\ninternational rules will often prove ineffective in restraining the\nstruggle for power. States will interpret them to their own advantage,\nand so international law will be obeyed or ignored according to the\ninterests of the states affected. Hence, international relations will\nalways tend to be a precarious affair. This grim view of global\npolitics lies at the core of Hobbes\u2019s realism.\n",
