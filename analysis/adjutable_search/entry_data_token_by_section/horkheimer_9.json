    "main_text": "The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature || Sources of Emancipation\n4.3 Sources of Emancipation\n\nThe upshot of these views seems to be that reason is self-destructive\nin a way that limits the very possibility of a rational critique of\nreason. It is fairly common to interpret the work from the 1940s as\nbeing so totalizing in its critique that it closes all avenues for\nfinding in reason the possibility for any emancipatory critique of\nsociety (Habermas is the most famous exponent of such a critique, see\nfor example his 1984, pp. 366\u2013399). One can certainly find much\npessimistic rhetoric in both Dialectic and Eclipse\nthat supports such a notion. But there are also elements of the text\nthat hint at the possibility for positive social change, such that the\nemancipatory aim of earlier critical theory is not entirely lost.\n\nThe emancipatory aim is not lost, but it is perhaps obscured. In the\nfirst essay of Dialectic, it is noted that \u201ca true\npraxis capable of overturning the status quo depends on theory\u2019s\nrefusal to yield to the oblivion in which society allows thought to\nossify\u201d (p. 33). That \u201ctheory\u201d and\n\u201cthought\u201d are so emphasized is important. Relatedly,\nHorkheimer disavows, in the preface to Eclipse, the idea he\nshould present a program of action, because \u201caction for\naction\u2019s sake is in no way superior to thought for\nthought\u2019s sake, and is perhaps even inferior to it\u201d (p.\nvi). This does not necessarily separate thought from action, of\ncourse, and the quote from Dialectic speaks of a \u201ctrue\npraxis.\u201d But genuinely emancipatory action is said to depend on\ncorrecting problems of thought first, such that Horkheimer would\nstress thought for thought\u2019s sake. Correcting these problems\nwould require freeing reason from instrumentality, which would mean\neschewing formalism. But this does not mean eschewing reason, if there\ncan be a kind of knowing that uses rational concepts while at the same\ntime moving beyond the static form of concepts associated with\nscientific thinking. Such a view is closely associated with\nAdorno\u2019s later work (see the entry in this encyclopedia on\nAdorno, Zuidervaart 2008). It is sometimes argued that the unusual\nliterary style of Dialectic itself is meant to exemplify such\nan attempt at escaping the ossification of thought (for an\ninterpretation that generally takes such a view, see Honneth 2007).\nAlong somewhat similar lines, modern art might have emancipatory\npotential, in its ability to express something of the current state of\nsociety through means other than formal reasoning. This is, again, a\nview that is commonly associated with Adorno\u2019s thought. But\nHorkheimer also presents such a view, especially in his 1941 essay\n\u201cArt and Mass Culture.\u201d There culture is criticized in a\nmanner similar to the discussion of the culture industry in\nDialectic, and a largely pessimistic picture of the\nrestrictive and homogenizing role of contemporary mass culture is\npresented. But Horkheimer does note that some art can break free of\nthis and still help the human being \u201cconceive of a world\ndifferent from that in which he lives.\u201d Such works (Horkheimer\nmentions Joyce\u2019s literature and Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica) can do so only negatively, however, by displaying\nthe difference between the human being and his or her \u201cbarbarous\nsurrounding\u201d (p. 278; on Horkheimer\u2019s views on art see Jay\n1993). In the case both of non-ossifying thought and modern art, the\nemancipatory potential is found only in traces, presented in an\nesoteric and perhaps abstruse manner. Such a conception of\n\u201cemancipation\u201d now seems to be somewhat separated from the\nexperience of the proletariat, and is possibly evidence of elitism\n(see Heller 2002). Whatever one makes of these criticisms, it is clear\nthat Horkheimer was less than sanguine regarding the possibility of\npositive social change.\n\nHorkheimer does suggest another avenue for emancipatory social change,\nhowever. He notes in Eclipse that \u201cthere are some\nforces of resistance left within man,\u201d and that \u201cthe\nspirit of humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a\nmember of social groups, at least in the individual as far as he is\nleft alone\u201d (p. 95). Unsurprisingly given the tone of the text\nas a whole, much of what follows that passage discusses the difficulty\nof separating oneself from the homogenizing forces of society. But\nHorkheimer does suggest that it is possible to engage in a kind of\nnon-conformism (without much of a description of what it would be\nlike), which comes through the \u201cspontaneity of the individual\nsubject\u201d (p. 99). The emphasis on individual action is tempered,\nhowever, through the emphasizing of a point that brings the latter\nparts of Eclipse back to one of Horkheimer\u2019s earliest\nviews; solidarity can be formed through the experience of shared\nsuffering, and philosophy should \u201ctranslate what [those who\nsuffer in the face of oppression] have done into language that will be\nheard\u201d (p.109). How this happens is unclear, as is the\nconnection between individual acts of non-conformism and solidarity.\nOne might also doubt the reliance on the power of the compassion. For\na thorough discussion of Eclipse that examines these\npotential problems, see Lohmann 1993. Whatever one makes of these\npoints, it is clear that this emphasis on suffering is the thread that\nties all of the periods of Horkheimer\u2019s work together, as it\nwould continue to be present in Horkheimer\u2019s last works.\n",
