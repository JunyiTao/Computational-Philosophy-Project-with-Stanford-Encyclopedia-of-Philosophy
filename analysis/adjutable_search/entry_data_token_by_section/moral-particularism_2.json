    "main_text": "What the Particularist Believes\n3. What the Particularist Believes\n\n\nThe particularist believes, like the generalist, that the perfectly\nmoral person is the person who is fully sensitive to the moral reasons\npresent in the case. But the particularist paints a very different\npicture of what it is to be fully sensitive to those reasons. The\nparticularist picture is one which takes moral reasons to operate in\nways that are not noticeably different from the way in which other\nreasons function\u2014more ordinary reasons for action, say, or\nreasons for belief rather than for action. Morality may be\ndistinguished by its subject matter, but moral thought does not have a\ndistinctive structure.\n\n\nIf we are to form a view about what a full sensitivity to the reasons\namounts, to, we need to have some picture of how moral reasons\nwork. The core of particularism is its insistence on variability.\nEssentially the generalist demands sameness in the way in which one\nand the same consideration functions case by case, while the\nparticularist sees no need for any such thing. A feature can make one\nmoral difference in one case, and a different difference in\nanother. Features have, as we might put it, variable\nrelevance. Whether a feature is relevant or not in a new case,\nand if so what exact role it is playing there (the \u2018form\u2019\nthat its relevance takes there) will be sensitive to other features of\nthe case. This claim emerges as the consequence of the core\nparticularist doctrine, which we can call the holism of reasons. This\nis the doctrine that what is a reason in one case may be no reason at\nall in another, or even a reason on the other side. In ethics, a\nfeature that makes one action better can make another one worse, and\nmake no difference at all to a third.\n\n\nParticularists suppose that this doctrine is true for reasons in\ngeneral, so that its application to moral reasons is just part and\nparcel of a larger story. For an example that comes from a non-moral\ncontext, suppose that it currently seems to me that something before\nme is red. Normally, one might say, that is a reason (some\nreason, that is, not necessarily sufficient reason) for me to believe\nthat there is something red before me. But in a case where I also\nbelieve that I have recently taken a drug that makes blue things look\nred and red things look blue, the appearance of a red-looking thing\nbefore me is reason for me to believe that there is a blue, not a red,\nthing before me. It is not as if it is some reason for me to believe\nthat there is something red before me, but that as such a reason it\nis overwhelmed by contrary reasons. It is no longer any reason at\nall to believe that there is something red before me; indeed it\nis a reason for believing the opposite.\n\n\nExamples like this establish the variability of reasons for belief.\nTurning to reasons for action, we might point out that in some\ncontexts the fact that something is against the law is a reason not to\ndo it, but in others it is a reason to do it (so as to protest, let us\nsay, against the existence of a law governing an aspect of private\nlife with which the law should not interfere). Examples of this sort\ncan be multiplied at will. They appear to establish the holism, or\nvariability of reasons for belief and of ordinary reasons for\naction. The particularist suggests that there is no reason to suppose\nthat moral reasons function in a radically different way from other\nreasons.  Indeed, there is a sort of presumption that they don\u2019t. That\npresumption is partly grounded on the fact that nobody is able to say\nwith any confidence just which reasons are moral ones and which are\nnot. This means that providing a radical difference between the way in\nwhich reasons of the two sorts function should seem rather peculiar.\nBut the presumption is also partly grounded in the fact that the\ndifference suggested by the generalist is very radical, since it\naffects what one might call the very logic of moral thought. To\nsuppose that moral thought has a different logic from other thought is\nto adopt a bifurcated conception of rationality. Moral rationality is\nprinciple-bound, based on invariant reasons. Other forms of\nrationality are nothing like this at all. Particularists think that\nthis suggestion is very strange.\n\n\nThese points about holism or the variability of reasons need to be\nexpressed in different ways, according to the conception of principles\nthat they are aimed at\u2014the absolute or the\ncontributory. Principles of both sorts aim to specify invariant\nreasons, but the reasons they specify are rather different in\nstyle. Absolute principles, which specify a feature or combination of\nfeatures that always succeed in making an action wrong (or right)\nwherever they occur, purport to specify an invariant overall reason,\nas we might put it.  Counter-examples to suggested principles of this\nsort will consist in cases where the supposed feature or combination\nof features is present but the action concerned is not wrong overall\n(or right overall).  Contributory principles are different. They\npurport to specify features that always make the same contribution,\nirrespective of context.  Counter-examples to suggested contributory\nprinciples consist of cases where the feature cited is present but\neither does not count at all or counts the wrong way (a supposed\nright-making feature actually making an action worse rather than\nbetter, for instance). Particularists take their holism to be a reason\nto reject any invariance of reasons, of either sort\u2014whether at\nthe overall or at the contributory level.  Reasons as such, they say,\ndo not need to behave in this sort of way.  It is consistent with this\nto allow that there might be some invariant reasons. What the\nparticularist says, however, is that the possibility of morality in no\nway depends upon a suitable provision of invariant reasons of the\nsorts that principles are attempting to specify.  Principle-based\naccounts of morality, such as those that specify ten (or some other\nnumber) of basic moral principles (e.g., Gert 1998), are left looking\nrather peculiar.\n\n\nThe picture so far is that actions get to be right or wrong in a wide\nvariety of ways. Particularists are \u2018pluralists\u2019,\nbelieving that there is more than one morally relevant property. Many\nproperties (or features) are capable of making a difference to how one\nought to act, and are therefore capable of being morally relevant. But\na property can be relevant on one occasion and not on another, and can\ncount in favour of action here and against action there. Isn\u2019t this\nall terribly confusing? If it is all as much of a mess as this, how\nare we capable of keeping track of it? Are we reduced to looking at\nthe case before us and hoping that the complex interrelations between\nthe various features that happen to be relevant here will just strike\nus, somehow? Is there no such thing as general moral knowledge that\none can extract from experience and bring to bear on a new case?\nParticularists need not deny this possibility. The question will be\nwhat form such general moral knowledge will take if it is not\nknowledge of the sort of invariabilities that particularism sets its\nface against, and that principles try to capture. I suggest that what\nthe experienced moral judge knows is a range of ways in which a\nfeature can contribute to determining how to act. There need be no\nhard core to this set of \u2018sorts of contribution\u2019, no\ncommon element, no limited set of paradigm cases. Instead, in\nunderstanding the practical purport of a concept such as\ncruelty, what one knows is the sort of difference it can make that\nwhat one proposes to do would be cruel, in a way that enables one to\nsee new differences made in situations rather different from those one\nhas encountered so far. Particularists may suggest that this is rather\nlike what one knows when one knows the semantic purport of a\nterm. In knowing the semantic purport (= the meaning) of\n\u2018and\u2019, one is in command of a range of contributions that\n\u2018and\u2019 can make to sentences in which it occurs. There need\nbe no \u2018core meaning\u2019 to \u2018and\u2019; it would be\nwrong to suggest that \u2018and\u2019 basically signifies\nconjunction. If you only know about conjunction, you are not a\ncompetent user of \u2018and\u2019 in English, for there are lots of\nuses that have little or nothing to do with conjunction. For example:\ntwo and two make four; \u2018And what do you think you are doing?\n(said on discovering a child playing downstairs in the middle of the\nnight); John and Mary lifted the boulder; the smoke rose higher and\nhigher. Those competent with \u2018and\u2019 are not unsettled by\ninstances such as these, but nor are they trying to understand them in\nterms of similarity to a supposed conjunctive paradigm or core case.\nParticularists in ethics will want to say the same sort of thing about\nwhat one knows when one knows the practical purport of a concept; one\nbecomes familiar with its practical grammar. There is complexity,\nthen, but it is manageable complexity.\n\n\nThis tells us how particularists will conceive of moral deliberation,\nwhen an individual tries to work out for herself how to act. There is\nno attempt to bring principles to bear on the situation, but there is\nan attempt to work out what matters here and how it matters, in ways\nthat may involve an indirect appeal to the way things were or might be\nelsewhere. And when two particularists are engaged in dispute, it is\nnot as if they are reduced to saying \u2018I see it this\nway\u2019. There are ways of supporting or defending the way one\ntakes the situation to be. A particularist can perfectly well point to\nhow things are in another perhaps simpler case, and suggest that this\nreveals something about how they are in the present more difficult\none. There need be no generalist suggestion that since this feature\nmade a certain difference there, it must make the same difference\nhere. But our judgement can be informed, and indeed defended, by\nseeing the way in which a feature functions in situations that\nresemble the present one in various ways. What we learn is not how\nthings must be here, but how they might very well\nbe. Argument between two people who differ on the way to see the\npresent case can make progress as each brings to bear other situations\nthat are both appropriately different from and also appropriately\nsimilar to the one before them. There is no guarantee that\nthis process will lead to agreement, any more than the generalist\nunderstanding of how disagreements get resolved leads us to suppose\nthat all disagreements are resoluble, if treated properly. But things\ncan happen even where there is no guarantee that they will happen.\n\n\nFinally, in this section, how does the particularist understand\nsomeone who says \u2018that is stealing, and therefore you should not\ndo it\u2019? One way of understanding what is said here is as an\nabbreviated argument, which fully specified reads \u2018that is\nstealing and stealing is always wrong; therefore that is\nwrong\u2019. This reading introduces silent appeal to a\nprinciple\u2014either absolute or contributory, according to one\u2019s\nway of understanding \u2018that is wrong\u2019. And it suggests that\nwhat we have here is really an inference, or argument, with premises\nand a conclusion. This is not how the particularist is likely to see\nthings.  Particularism is likely to think of \u2018that is stealing\nand therefore it is wrong\u2019 as saying \u2018that is stealing and\nwrong for that reason\u2019. This is not an argument, and there is\nnothing going on here that really merits being called inference. It is\nsimply an account of the presence of a reason and a statement of what\nreason it is, that is, of what it is a reason for (or against).\n",
