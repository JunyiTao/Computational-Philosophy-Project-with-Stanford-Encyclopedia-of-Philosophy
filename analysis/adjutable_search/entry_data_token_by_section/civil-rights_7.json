    "main_text": "The Right to Vote || The Disenfranchisement of Black Americans\n4.1 The Disenfranchisement of Black Americans\n\nThe 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in\n1870, a landmark of the Reconstruction era in which radical\nRepublicans and their allies sought to ensure that America\u2019s\nfreedmen and their fellow blacks would be free and equal citizens. The\namendment prohibits the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on\naccount of race and authorizes Congress to enact \u201cappropriate\nlegislation\u201d to implement the prohibition. But it would take a\ncentury after the amendment\u2019s ratification before blacks across\nthe South could register and vote free from widespread and overt\ndiscrimination and a well-grounded fear of economic coercion and\nretaliatory violence. Even during Reconstruction, when many blacks\ncould vote under the protection of federal troops occupying the South\nat the time, there was routine discrimination and violence against\nblacks seeking to exercise their constitutional right. \n\nThe Supreme Court gave a tortured interpretation to federal\nlegislation that sought to protect black voting rights, declaring that\nthe legislation was not \u201cappropriate\u201d as a basis for the\nprosecution of state officials who had flagrantly prevented blacks\nfrom registering to vote (U.S. v. Reese 1875). And after a\nbackroom deal enabled Rutherford Hayes to win the contested\npresidential election of 1876, his administration instructed federal\ntroops to end their efforts to protect the rights of blacks. With the\nconsequent demise of Reconstruction, the path was opened for Southern\nwhites to turn the 15th Amendment into a dead letter. \n\nSouthern states proceeded to adopt literacy requirements and other\ntests of a voter\u2019s knowledge, poll taxes, and a variety of other\nmeasures that, applied in a discriminatory manner by local registrars\nand combined with terrorist violence and economic coercion, succeeded\nin disenfranchising the vast majority of blacks in the region. And\ndespite the open defiance of the 15th Amendment, in Giles v.\nHarris (1903), the Supreme Court declared that the federal\njudiciary was not the place to go for blacks who sought the abrogation\nof the system of disenfranchisement. Justice Holmes wrote for the\ncourt that \u201crelief from a great political wrong, if done, as\nalleged, by the people of a state and the state itself must be given\nby them or by the legislative and political department of the\ngovernment of the United States\u201d (488). But Holmes and every\nother minimally-informed American at the time knew full well that\nthere was no realistic possibility that Southern states or Congress\nwould voluntarily act to protect the voting rights of blacks. \n\nIt was clear to blacks that, without the franchise, they had no\nprospect of securely enjoying their legal rights to property,\ncontract, due process and the other claims that had been traditionally\nregarded as the fundamental rights of free and equal citizens. With no\npolitical power, Southern blacks were exposed to ruthless exploitation\nand oppression at the hands of whites, which was the reason why whites\nundertook their disenfranchisement schemes in the first place. The\nexperience of Reconstruction had taught whites that the vote was a\npower that blacks would use to secure their other legal rights. It was\nno accident that one of the principal aims of the Civil Rights\nMovement would be the enactment of effective federal legislation to\nprotect voting rights. \n",
