    "main_text": "\n1. Quantum Mechanics as a Probability Calculus\n\nIt is uncontroversial (though remarkable) that the formal apparatus of\nquantum mechanics reduces neatly to a generalization of classical\nprobability in which the role played by a Boolean algebra of events in\nthe latter is taken over by the \u201cquantum logic\u201d of\nprojection operators on a Hilbert\n space.[1]\n Moreover, the usual statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics\nasks us to take this generalized quantum probability theory quite\nliterally\u2014that is, not as merely a formal analogue of its\nclassical counterpart, but as a genuine doctrine of chances. In this\nsection, I survey this quantum probability theory and its supporting\nquantum\n logic.[2]\n\n[For further background on Hilbert spaces, see the entry on\n quantum mechanics.\n For further background on ordered sets and lattices, see the\nsupplementary document:\n The Basic Theory of Ordering Relations.\n Concepts and results explained these supplements will be used freely\nin what follows.] \n1.1 Quantum Probability in a Nutshell\n\nThe quantum-probabilistic formalism, as developed by von Neumann\n[1932], assumes that each physical system is associated with a\n(separable) Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), the unit vectors of which\ncorrespond to possible physical states of the system. Each\n\u201cobservable\u201d real-valued random quantity is represented by\na self-adjoint operator \\(A\\) on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), the spectrum of which\nis the set of possible values of \\(A\\). If \\(u\\) is a unit vector in\nthe domain of \\(A\\), representing a state, then the expected value of\nthe observable represented by \\(A\\) in this state is given by the\ninner product \\(\\langle Au,u\\rangle\\). The observables represented by\ntwo operators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are commensurable iff \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\ncommute, i.e., AB = BA. (For further discussion, see the\n entry on quantum mechanics.)\n1.2 The \u201cLogic\u201d of Projections\n\nAs stressed by von Neumann, the \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)-valued observables may be\nregarded as encoding propositions about\u2014or, to use his phrasing,\nproperties of\u2014the state of the system. It is not difficult to\nshow that a self-adjoint operator \\(P\\) with spectrum contained in the\ntwo-point set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) must be a projection; i.e., \\(P^2 = P\\).\nSuch operators are in one-to-one correspondence with the closed\nsubspaces of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). Indeed, if \\(P\\) is a projection, its\nrange is closed, and any closed subspace is the range of a unique\nprojection. If \\(u\\) is any unit vector, then \\(\\langle Pu,u\\rangle =\n\\llvert Pu\\rrvert ^2\\) is the expected value of the corresponding\nobservable in the state represented by \\(u\\). Since this observable is\n\\(\\{0,1\\}\\)-valued, we can interpret this expected value as the\nprobability that a measurement of the observable will produce\nthe \u201caffirmative\u201d answer 1. In particular, the affirmative\nanswer will have probability 1 if and only if Pu = u; that\nis, \\(u\\) lies in the range of \\(P\\). Von Neumann concludes that \n\n\n\u2026 the relation between the properties of a physical system on\nthe one hand, and the projections on the other, makes possible a sort\nof logical calculus with these. However, in contrast to the concepts\nof ordinary logic, this system is extended by the concept of\n\u201csimultaneous decidability\u201d which is characteristic for\nquantum mechanics. (1932: 253) \n\n\nLet\u2019s examine this \u201clogical calculus\u201d of\nprojections. Ordered by set-inclusion, the closed subspaces of\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) form a complete lattice, in which the meet (greatest\nlower bound) of a set of subspaces is their intersection, while their\njoin (least upper bound) is the closed span of their union. Since a\ntypical closed subspace has infinitely many complementary closed\nsubspaces, this lattice is not distributive; however, it is\northocomplemented by the mapping \n\n\\[\\mathbf{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{M}^{\\bot} = \\{v\\in \\mathbf{H} \\mid\n\\forall u\\in \\mathbf{M}(\\langle v,u\\rangle = 0)\\}.\\]\n\n\n In view of the\nabove-mentioned one-one correspondence between closed subspaces and\nprojections, we may impose upon the set \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) the\nstructure of a complete orthocomplemented lattice, defining \\(P\\le\nQ\\), where \\(\\rran (P) \\subseteq \\rran (Q)\\) and \\(P' = 1 - P\\) (so\nthat \\(\\rran (P') = \\rran (P)^{\\bot})\\). It is straightforward that\n\\(P\\le Q\\) just in case \\(PQ = QP = P\\). More generally, if PQ =\nQP, then \\(PQ = P\\wedge Q\\), the meet of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) in\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\); also in this case their join is given by \\(P\\vee Q\n= P+Q - PQ\\).\n\n\n1.1 Lemma:\n\nLet \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be projection operators on the Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\). The following are equivalent:\n\n\\(PQ = QP\\)\nThe sublattice of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) generated by \\(P, Q, P'\\) and\n\\(Q'\\) is Boolean\n\\(P, Q\\) lie in a common Boolean sub-ortholattice of\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\).\n\n\n\nAdhering to the idea that commuting observables\u2014in particular,\nprojections\u2014are simultaneously measurable, we conclude that the\nmembers of a Boolean sub-ortholattice of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) are\nsimultaneously testable. This suggests that we can maintain a\nclassical logical interpretation of the meet, join and orthocomplement\nas applied to commuting projections.\n1.3 Probability Measures and Gleason\u2019s Theorem\n\nThe foregoing discussion motivates the following. Call projections\n\\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) orthogonal, and write \\(P\\binbot Q\\) iff \\(P\n\\le Q'\\). Note that \\(P\\binbot Q\\) iff \\(PQ = QP = 0\\). If \\(P\\) and\n\\(Q\\) are orthogonal projections, then their join is simply their sum;\ntraditionally, this is denoted \\(P\\oplus Q\\). We denote the identity\nmapping on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{1}\\).\n\n\n1.2 Definition:\n\nA (countably additive) probability measure on\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is a mapping \\(\\mu : L \\rightarrow\\) [0,1] such that\n\\(\\mu(\\mathbf{1}) = 1\\) and, for any sequence of pair-wise orthogonal\nprojections \\(P_i, i = 1,2\\),\u2026\n\n\\[\\mu(\\oplus_i P_i) = \\sum_i \\mu(P_i)\\]\n\n\n\nHere is one way in which we can manufacture a probability measure on\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\). Let \\(u\\) be a unit vector of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), and\nset \\(\\mu_u (P) = \\langle Pu,u\\rangle\\). This gives the usual\nquantum-mechanical recipe for the probability that \\(P\\) will have\nvalue 1 in the state \\(u\\). Note that we can also express \\(\\mu_u\\) as\n\\(\\mu_u(P) = Tr(P P_u)\\), where \\(P_u\\) is the one-dimensional\nprojection associated with the unit vector \\(u\\), i.e., \\(P_u(x) =\n\\langle x, u \\rangle u\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbf{H}\\). \n\nMore generally, if \\(\\mu_i, i=1,2,\\ldots\\), are probability measures\non \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\), then so is any \u201cmixture\u201d, or convex\ncombination \\(\\mu = \\sum_i t_i\\mu_i\\) where \\(0\\le t_i\\le 1\\) and\n\\(\\sum_i t_i = 1\\). Given any sequence \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\), of unit\nvectors, let \\(\\mu_i = \\mu_{u_{ i}}\\) and let \\(P_i = P_{u_{ i}}\\).\nForming the operator \n\n\\[W = t_1 P_1 + t_2P_2 +\\ldots,\\]\n\n one sees that \n\n\\[\\mu(P) = t_1 Tr(P P_1) + t_2 Tr(P P_2) + \\ldots = Tr(WP)\\]\n\n\nAn operator expressible in this way as a convex combination of\none-dimensional projections in is called a density operator.\nDensity operators are the standard mathematical representation for\ngeneral (pure or \u201cmixed\u201d) quantum-mechanical states. We\nhave just seen that every density operator \\(W\\) gives rise to a\ncountably additive probability measure on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\). The\nfollowing striking converse, due to A. Gleason [1957], shows that the\ntheory of probability measures on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is co-extensive\nwith the theory of (mixed) quantum mechanical states on\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\):\n\n\n1.3 Gleason\u2019s Theorem:\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) have dimension \\(\\gt 2\\). Then every countably\nadditive probability measure on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) has the form\n\\(\\mu(P) = Tr(WP)\\), for a density operator \\(W\\) on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\).\n\n\n\nAn important consequence of Gleason\u2019s Theorem is that\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) does not admit any probability measures having only\nthe values 0 and 1. To see this, note that for any density operator\n\\(W\\), the mapping \\(u \\rightarrow \\langle Wu,u\\rangle\\) is continuous\non the unit sphere of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). But since the latter is\nconnected, no continuous function on it can take only the two values 0\nand 1. This result is often taken to rule out the possibility of\n\u201chidden variables\u201d\u2014an issue taken up in more detail\nin section 6.\n1.4 The Reconstruction of QM\n\nFrom the single premise that the \u201cexperimental\npropositions\u201d associated with a physical system are encoded by\nprojections in the way indicated above, one can reconstruct the rest\nof the formal apparatus of quantum mechanics. The first step, of\ncourse, is Gleason\u2019s theorem, which tells us that probability\nmeasures on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) correspond to density operators. There\nremains to recover, e.g., the representation of\n\u201cobservables\u201d by self-adjoint operators, and the dynamics\n(unitary evolution). The former can be recovered with the help of the\nSpectral theorem and the latter with the aid of a deep theorem of E.\nWigner on the projective representation of groups. See also R. Wright\n[1980]. A detailed outline of this reconstruction (which involves some\ndistinctly non-trivial mathematics) can be found in the book of\nVaradarajan [1985]. The point to bear in mind is that, once the\nquantum-logical skeleton \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is in place, the remaining\nstatistical and dynamical apparatus of quantum mechanics is\nessentially fixed. In this sense, then, quantum mechanics\u2014or, at\nany rate, its mathematical framework\u2014reduces to quantum\nlogic and its attendant probability theory.\n2. Interpretations of Quantum Logic\n\nThe reduction of QM to probability theory based on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\)\nis mathematically compelling, but what does it tell us about\nQM\u2014or, assuming QM to be a correct and complete physical theory,\nabout the world? How, in other words, are we to interpret the quantum\nlogic \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\)? The answer will turn on how we unpack the\nphrase, freely used above,\n\n(*) The value of the\nobservable \\(A\\) lies in the range \\(B\\).\n\n\nOne possible reading of (*) is operational:\n\u201cmeasurement of the observable \\(A\\) would yield (or will yield,\nor has yielded) a value in the set \\(B\\)\u201d. On this view,\nprojections represent statements about the possible results of\nmeasurements. This sits badly with realists of a certain stripe, who,\nshunning reference to \u201cmeasurement\u201d, prefer to understand\n(*) as a property ascription: \n\n\nthe system has a certain categorical property, which corresponds to\nthe observable \\(A\\) having, independently of any measurement, a value\nin the set \\(B\\). \n\n\n(One must be careful in how one understands this last phrase, however:\nconstrued incautiously, it seems to posit a hidden-variables\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics of just the sort ruled out by\nGleason\u2019s Theorem. I will have more to say about this\nbelow.)\n2.1 Realist Quantum Logic\n\nThe interpretation of projection operators as representing the\nproperties of a physical system is already explicit in von\nNeumann\u2019s Grundlagen.. However, the logical operations\ndiscussed there apply only to commuting projections, which are\nidentified with simultaneously decidable propositions. In 1936\nBirkhoff and von Neumann took a step further, proposing to interpret\nthe lattice-theoretic meet and join of projections as their\nconjunction and disjunction, whether or not they commute.\nImmediately this proposal faces the problem that the lattice\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is not distributive, making it impossible to give\nthese \u201cquantum\u201d connectives a truth-functional\ninterpretation. Undaunted, von Neumann and Birkhoff suggested that the\nempirical success of quantum mechanics as a framework for physics\ncasts into doubt the universal validity of the distributive laws of\npropositional logic. Their phrasing remains cautious:\n\nWhereas logicians have usually assumed that properties \u2026 of\nnegation were the ones least able to withstand a critical analysis,\nthe study of mechanics points to the distributive identities \u2026\nas the weakest link in the algebra of logic. (1936: 837)\n\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, this thesis was advanced rather more\naggressively by a number of authors, including especially David\nFinkelstein and Hilary Putnam, who argued that quantum mechanics\nrequires a revolution in our understanding of logic per se.\nAccording to Putnam, \u201cLogic is as empirical as geometry.\n\u2026 We live in a world with a non-classical logic\u201d ([1968]\n1979: 184).\n\nFor Putnam, the elements of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) represent categorical\nproperties that an object possesses, or does not, independently of\nwhether or not we look. Inasmuch as this picture of physical\nproperties is confirmed by the empirical success of quantum mechanics,\nwe must, on this view, accept that the way in which physical\nproperties actually hang together is not Boolean. Since logic is, for\nPutnam, very much the study of how physical properties actually hang\ntogether, he concludes that classical logic is simply mistaken: the\ndistributive law is not universally valid.\n\nClassically, if \\(S\\) is the set of states of a physical system, then\nevery subset of \\(S\\) corresponds to a categorical property\nof the system, and vice versa. In quantum mechanics, the state space\nis the (projective) unit sphere \\(S = S(\\mathbf{H})\\) of a Hilbert\nspace. However, not all subsets of \\(S\\) correspond to\nquantum-mechanical properties of the system. The latter correspond\nonly to subsets of the special form \\(S \\cap \\mathbf{M}\\), for\n\\(\\mathbf{M}\\) a closed linear subspace of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). In\nparticular, only subsets of this form are assigned probabilities. This\nleaves us with two options. One is to take only these special\nproperties as \u201creal\u201d (or \u201cphysical\u201d, or\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d), regarding more general subsets of \\(S\\) as\ncorresponding to no real categorical properties at all. The other is\nto regard the \u201cquantum\u201d properties as a small subset of\nthe set of all physically (or at any rate, metaphysically) reasonable,\nbut not necessarily observable, properties of the system. On\nthis latter view, the set of all properties of a physical\nsystem is entirely classical in its logical structure, but we decline\nto assign probabilities to the non-observable\n properties.[3]\n\nThis second position, while certainly not inconsistent with realism\nper se, turns upon a distinction involving a notion of\n\u201cobservation\u201d, \u201cmeasurement\u201d,\n\u201ctest\u201d, or something of this sort\u2014a notion that\nrealists are often at pains to avoid in connection with fundamental\nphysical theory. Of course, any realist account of a statistical\nphysical theory such as quantum mechanics will ultimately have to\nrender up some explanation of how measurements are supposed to take\nplace. That is, it will have to give an account of which physical\ninteractions between \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cprobe\u201d\nsystems count as measurements, and of how these interactions cause the\nprobe system to evolve into final \u201coutcome-states\u201d that\ncorrespond to\u2014and have the same probabilities as\u2014the\noutcomes predicted by the theory. This is the notorious\nmeasurement problem.\n\nIn fact, Putnam advanced his version of quantum-logical realism as\noffering a (radical) dissolution of the measurement problem: According\nto Putnam, the measurement problem (and indeed every other\nquantum-mechanical \u201cparadox\u201d) arises through an improper\napplication of the distributive law, and hence disappears\nonce this is recognized. This proposal, however, is widely regarded as\n mistaken.[4]\n\n\nAs mentioned above, realist interpretations of quantum mechanics must\nbe careful in how they construe the phrase \u201cthe observable \\(A\\)\nhas a value in the set \\(B\\)\u201d. The simplest and most traditional\nproposal\u2014often dubbed the \u201ceigenstate-eigenvalue\nlink\u201d (Fine [1973])\u2014is that (*) holds if and only if a\nmeasurement of \\(A\\) yields a value in the set \\(B\\) with certainty,\ni.e., with (quantum-mechanical!) probability 1. While this certainly\ngives a realist interpretation of\n (*),[5]\n it does not provide a solution to the measurement problem. Indeed, we\ncan use it to give a sharp formulation of that problem: even though\n\\(A\\) is certain to yield a value in \\(B\\) when measured, unless the\nquantum state is an eigenstate of the measured observable \\(A\\), the\nsystem does not possess any categorical property corresponding to\n\\(A\\)\u2019s having a specific value in the set \\(B\\). Putnam seems\nto assume that a realist interpretation of (*) should consist in\nassigning to \\(A\\) some unknown value within \\(B\\), for which quantum\nmechanics yields a non-trivial probability. However, an attempt to\nmake such assignments simultaneously for all observables runs afoul of\nGleason\u2019s\n Theorem.[6]\n2.2 Operational Quantum Logic\n\nIf we put aside scruples about \u201cmeasurement\u201d as a\nprimitive term in physical theory, and accept a principled distinction\nbetween \u201ctestable\u201d and non-testable properties, then the\nfact that \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is not Boolean is unremarkable, and\ncarries no implication about logic per se. Quantum mechanics\nis, on this view, a theory about the possible statistical\ndistributions of outcomes of certain measurements, and its\nnon-classical \u201clogic\u201d simply reflects the fact that not\nall observable phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Because of\nthis, the set of probability-bearing events (or propositions) is\nless rich than it would be in classical probability theory,\nand the set of possible statistical distributions, accordingly, less\ntightly constrained. That some \u201cnon-classical\u201d probability\ndistributions allowed by this theory are actually manifested in nature\nis perhaps surprising, but in no way requires any deep shift in our\nunderstanding of logic or, for that matter, of probability.\n\nThis is hardly the last word, however. Having accepted all of the\nabove, there still remains the question of why the logic of\nmeasurement outcomes should have the very special form\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\), and never anything more\n general.[7]\n This question entertains the idea that the formal structure of\nquantum mechanics may be uniquely determined by a small\nnumber of reasonable assumptions, together perhaps with certain\nmanifest regularities in the observed phenomena. This possibility is\nalready contemplated in von Neumann\u2019s Grundlagen (and\nalso his later work in continuous geometry), but first becomes\nexplicit\u2014and programmatic\u2014in the work of George Mackey\n[1957, 1963]. Mackey presents a sequence of six axioms, framing a very\nconservative generalized probability theory, that underwrite the\nconstruction of a \u201clogic\u201d of experimental propositions,\nor, in his terminology, \u201cquestions\u201d, having the structure\nof a sigma-orthomodular partially-ordered set (see Section 4 and the\nsupplement document\n The Basic Theory of Ordering Relations\n for definitions of these terms). The outstanding problem, for Mackey,\nwas to explain why this poset ought to be isomorphic to\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\):\n\nAlmost all modern quantum mechanics is based implicitly or explicitly\non the following assumption, which we shall state as an axiom:\n\n\nAxiom VII: The partially ordered set of all questions in quantum\nmechanics is isomorphic to the partially ordered set of all closed\nsubspaces of a separable, infinite dimensional Hilbert space.\n\n\nThis axiom has rather a different character from Axioms I through VI.\nThese all had some degree of physical naturalness and plausibility.\nAxiom VII seems entirely ad hoc. Why do we make it? Can we justify\nmaking it? \u2026 Ideally, one would like to have a list of\nphysically plausible assumptions from which one could deduce Axiom\nVII. Short of this one would like a list from which one could deduce a\nset of possibilities for the structure \u2026 all but one of which\ncould be shown to be inconsistent with suitably planned experiments.\n[Mackey 1963: 71\u201372]\n\n\nSince Mackey\u2019s writing there has grown up an extensive technical\nliterature exploring variations on his axiomatic framework in an\neffort to supply the missing assumptions. The remainder of this\narticle presents a brief survey of the current state of this\nproject.\n3. Generalized Probability Theory\n\nRather than restate Mackey\u2019s axioms verbatim, I shall paraphrase\nthem in the context of an approach to generalized probability theory\ndue to D. J. Foulis and C. H. Randall having\u2014among the many more\nor less analogous approaches\n available[8]\u2014certain\n advantages of simplicity and flexibility. References for this section\nare Foulis, Greechie, and R\u00fcttimann [1992]; Foulis, Piron and\nRandall [1983]; Randall and Foulis [1983]; see also Gudder [1989];\nWilce [2000b] and Wilce [2009] for surveys.\n3.1 Discrete Classical Probability Theory\n\nIt will be helpful to begin with a review of classical probability\ntheory. In its simplest formulation, classical probability theory\ndeals with a (discrete) set \\(E\\) of mutually exclusive outcomes, as\nof some measurement, experiment, etc., and with the various\nprobability weights that can be defined thereon\u2014that\nis, with mappings \\(\\omega : E \\rightarrow[0,1]\\) summing to 1 over\n \\(E\\).[9]\n\nNotice that the set \\(\\Delta(E)\\) of all probability weights on \\(E\\)\nis convex, in that, given any sequence\n\\(\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\ldots\\) of probability weights and any sequence\n\\(t_1,t_2,\\ldots\\) of non-negative real numbers summing to one, the\nconvex sum or \u201cmixture\u201d \\(t_1\\omega_1 + t_2\\omega_2\n+\\ldots\\) (taken pointwise on \\(E)\\) is again a probability weight.\nThe extreme points of this convex set are exactly the\n\u201cpoint-masses\u201d \\(\\delta(x)\\) associated with the outcomes\n\\(x \\in E\\): \n\n\\[\\delta(x)(y) = 1 \\textrm{ if } x = y, \\textrm{ and } 0 \\textrm{ otherwise.}\\]\n\n\n Thus, \\(\\Delta(E)\\) is a simplex:\neach point \\(\\omega \\in \\Delta(E)\\) is representable in a unique way\nas a convex combination of extreme points, namely: \n\n\\[\\omega = \\sum \\omega(x)\\delta(x)\\]\n\n\n We also\nneed to recall the concept of a random variable. If \\(E\\) is\nan outcome set and \\(V\\), some set of \u201cvalues\u201d (real\nnumbers, pointer-readings, or what not), a \\(V\\)-valued random\nvariable is simply a mapping \\(f : E \\rightarrow V\\). The\nheuristic (but it need only be taken as that) is that one\n\u201cmeasures\u201d the random variable \\(f\\) by\n\u201cperforming\u201d the experiment represented by \\(E\\) and, upon\nobtaining the outcome \\(x \\in E\\), recording \\(f(x)\\) as the measured\nvalue. Note that if \\(V\\) is a set of real numbers, or, more\ngenerally, a subset of a vector space, we may define the expected\nvalue of \\(f\\) in a state \\(\\omega \\in \\Delta(E)\\) by:\n\n\\[E(f,\\omega) = \\sum_{x\\in E} f(x)\\omega(x).\\]\n\n3.2 Test Spaces\n\nA very natural direction in which to generalize discrete classical\nprobability theory is to allow for a multiplicity of outcome-sets,\neach representing a different \u201cexperiment\u201d. To formalize\nthis, let us agree that a test space is a non-empty\ncollection A of non-empty sets \\(E,F,\\ldots\\), each construed as a\ndiscrete outcome-set as in classical probability theory. Each set \\(E\n\\in \\mathcal{A}\\) is called a test. The set \\(X = \\cup\n\\mathcal{A}\\) of all outcomes of all tests belonging to\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is called the outcome space of\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\). Notice that we allow distinct tests to overlap, i.e.,\nto have outcomes in\n common.[10]\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a test space with outcome-space \\(X\\), a\nstate on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a mapping \\(\\omega : X\n\\rightarrow\\) [0,1] such that \\(\\sum_{x\\in E} \\omega(x) = 1\\) for\nevery test \\(E \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Thus, a state is a consistent\nassignment of a probability weight to each test\u2014consistent in\nthat, where two distinct tests share a common outcome, the state\nassigns that outcome the same probability whether it is secured as a\nresult of one test or the other. (This may be regarded as a normative\nrequirement on the outcome-identifications implicit in the structure\nof \\(\\mathcal{A}\\): if outcomes of two tests are not equiprobable in\nall states, they ought not to be identified.) The set of all states on\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is denoted by \\(\\Omega(\\mathcal{A})\\). This is a\nconvex set, but in contrast to the situation in discrete classical\nprobability theory, it is generally not a simplex.\n\nThe concept of a random variable admits several generalizations to the\nsetting of test spaces. Let us agree that a simple (real-valued)\nrandom variable on a test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a mapping \\(f\n: E \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\) where \\(E\\) is a test in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nWe define the expected value of \\(f\\) in a state \\(\\omega \\in\n\\Omega(\\mathcal{A})\\) in the obvious way, namely, as the expected\nvalue of \\(f\\) with respect to the probability weight obtained by\nrestricting \\(\\omega\\) to \\(E\\) (provided, of course, that this\nexpected value exists). One can go on to define more general classes\nof random variables by taking suitable limits (for details, see Younce\n[1987]).\n\nIn classical probability theory (and especially in classical\nstatistics) one usually focuses, not on the set of all possible\nprobability weights, but on some designated subset of these (e.g.,\nthose belonging to a given family of distributions). Accordingly, by a\nprobabilistic model, I mean pair \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\)\nconsisting of a test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and a designated set of\nstates \\(\\Delta \\subseteq \\Omega(\\mathcal{A})\\) on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nI\u2019ll refer to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) as the test space and to\n\\(\\Delta\\) as the state space of the model.\n\nI\u2019ll now indicate how this framework can accommodate both the\nusual measure-theoretic formalism of full-blown classical probability\ntheory and the Hilbert-space formalism of quantum probability\ntheory.\n3.3 Kolmogorovian Probability Theory\n\nLet \\(S\\) be a set, understood for the moment as the state-space of a\nphysical system, and let \\(\\Sigma\\) be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of subsets\nof \\(S\\). We can regard each partition \\(E\\) of \\(S\\) into countably\nmany pair-wise disjoint \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable subsets as representing\na \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d approximation to an imagined perfect\nexperiment that would reveal the state of the system. Let\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\Sigma}\\) be the test space consisting of all such\npartitions. Note that the outcome set for \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\Sigma}\\) is\nthe set \\(X = \\Sigma \\setminus \\{\\varnothing \\}\\) of non-empty\n\\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable subsets of \\(S\\). Evidently, the probability\nweights on \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\Sigma}\\) correspond exactly to the\ncountably additive probability measures on \\(\\Sigma\\). \n3.4 Quantum Probability Theory\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) denote a complex Hilbert space and let\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\) denote the collection of (unordered)\northonormal bases of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, the outcome-space \\(X\\) of\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\) will be the unit sphere of\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\). Note that if \\(u\\) is any unit vector of\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) and \\(E \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\) is any\northonormal basis, we have \n\n\n\\[\\sum_{x\\in E} \\lvert\\langle u,x\\rangle\\rvert^2 = \\llvert u\\rrvert ^2 = 1\\]\n\n\nThus, each unit vector of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) determines a probability\nweight on \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\). Quantum mechanics asks us to\ntake this literally: any \u201cmaximal\u201d discrete\nquantum-mechanical observable is modeled by an orthonormal basis, and\nany pure quantum mechanical state, by a unit vector in exactly this\nway. Conversely, every orthonormal basis and every unit vector are\nunderstood to correspond to such a measurement and such a state.\n\nGleason\u2019s theorem can now be invoked to identify the states on\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\) with the density operators on\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\): to each state \\(\\omega\\) in\n\\(\\Omega(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}})\\) there corresponds a unique\ndensity operator \\(W\\) such that, for every unit vector \\(x\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{H}, \\omega(x) = \\langle Wx,x\\rangle = Tr(WP_x), P_x\\) being\nthe one-dimensional projection associated with \\(x\\). Conversely, of\ncourse, every such density operator defines a unique state by the\nformula above. We can also represent simple real-valued random\nvariables operator-theoretically. Each bounded simple random variable\n\\(f\\) gives rise to a bounded self-adjoint operator \\(A = \\sum_{x\\in\nE} f(x)P_x\\). The spectral theorem tells us that every self-adjoint\noperator on \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) can be obtained by taking suitable limits\nof operators of this form.\n4. Logics associated with probabilistic models\n\nAssociated with any probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) are\nseveral partially ordered sets, each of which has some claim to the\nstatus of an \u201cempirical logic\u201d associated with the model.\nIn this section, I\u2019ll discuss two: the so-called operational\nlogic \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) and the property lattice\n\\(\\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\). Under relatively benign conditions\non \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), the former is an orthoalgebra. The latter\nis always a complete lattice, and under plausible further assumptions,\natomic. Moreover, there is a natural order preserving mapping from\n\\(\\Pi\\) to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). This is not generally an order-isomorphism,\nbut when it is, we obtain a complete orthomodular lattice, and thus\ncome a step closer to the projection lattice of a Hilbert space. \n4.1 Operational Logics\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a test space, an \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-event\nis a set of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-outcomes that is contained in some test.\nIn other words, an \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-event is simply an event in the\nclassical sense for any one of the tests belonging to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nNow, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-events, we say that\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are orthogonal, and write \\(A\\binbot B\\), if\nthey are disjoint and their union is again an event. We say that two\northogonal events are complements of one another if their\nunion is a test. We say that events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nperspective, and write \\(A\\sim B\\), if they share any common\ncomplement. (Notice that any two tests \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are\nperspective, since they are both complementary to the empty\nevent.)\n\n\n4.1 Definition:\n\nA test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is said to be algebraic if for\nall events \\(A, B, C\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(A\\sim B \\binbot C\\)\nimplies \\(A\\binbot C\\).\n\n\nWhile it is possible to construct perfectly plausible examples of test\nspaces that are not algebraic, many test spaces that one encounters in\nnature do enjoy this property. In particular, the Borel and quantum\ntest spaces described in the preceding section are algebraic. The more\nimportant point is that, as an axiom, algebraicity is relatively\nbenign, in the sense that many test spaces can be\n\u201ccompleted\u201d to become algebraic. In particular, if every\noutcome has probability greater than 1/2 in at least one state, then\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is contained in an algebraic test space\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) having the same outcomes and the same states as\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) (see Gudder [1989] for details).\n\nIt can be\n shown[11]\n that test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is algebraic if and only if it\nsatisfies the condition\n\nFor all events \\(A, B\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), if \\(A\\sim B\\), then any\ncomplement of \\(B\\) is a complement of \\(A\\). \n\nFrom this, it is not hard to see that, for an algebraic test space\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\), the relation \\(\\sim \\) of perspectivity is then an\nequivalence relation on the set of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-events. More than\nthis, if \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is algebraic, then \\(\\sim \\) is a\ncongruence for the partial binary operation of forming unions\nof orthogonal events: in other words, for all \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-events\n\\(A, B\\), and \\(C, A\\sim B\\) and \\(B\\binbot C\\) imply that \\(A\\binbot\nC\\) and \\(A\\cup C \\sim B\\cup C\\).\n\nLet \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) be the set of equivalence classes of\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-events under perspectivity, and denote the equivalence\nclass of an event \\(A\\) by \\(p(A)\\); we then have a natural partial\nbinary operation on \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) defined by \\(p(A)\\oplus p(B)\n= p(A\\cup B)\\) for orthogonal events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Setting 0 :\\(=\np(\\varnothing)\\) and 1 :\\(= p(E), E\\) any member of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\),\nwe obtain a partial-algebraic structure \\((\\Pi(\\mathcal{A}),\\oplus\n,0,1)\\), called the logic of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). This satisfies\nthe following conditions:\n\n\\(\\oplus\\) is associative and commutative:\n\n\nIf \\(a\\oplus(b\\oplus c)\\) is defined, so is \\((a\\oplus b)\\oplus\nc\\), and the two are equal\nIf \\(a\\oplus b\\) is defined, so is \\(b\\oplus a\\), and the two are\nequal.\n \n\\(0\\oplus a = a\\), for every \\(a \\in \\mathbf{L}\\)\nFor every \\(a \\in \\mathbf{L}\\), there exists a unique \\(a' \\in\n\\mathbf{L}\\) with \\(a\\oplus a' = 1\\)\n\\(a\\oplus a\\) exists only if \\(a = 0\\)\n\n\nWe may now define: \n\n\n4.2 Definition:\n\nA structure \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus ,0,1)\\) satisfying conditions\n(a)\u2013(d) above is called an orthoalgebra. \n\n\nThus, the logic of an algebraic test space is an orthoalgebra. One can\nshow that, conversely, every orthoalgebra arises as the logic\n\\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) of an algebraic test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\n(Golfin [1988]). Note that non-isomorphic test spaces can have\nisomorphic logics.\n4.2 Orthocoherence\n\nAny orthoalgebra \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is partially ordered by the relation\n\\(a\\le b\\) iff \\(b = a\\oplus c\\) for some \\(c\\binbot a\\). Relative to\nthis ordering, the mapping \\(a\\rightarrow a'\\) is an\northocomplementation and \\(a\\binbot b\\) iff \\(a\\le b'\\). It can be\nshown that \\(a\\oplus b\\) is always a minimal upper bound for \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\), but it is generally not the least upper bound. Indeed,\nwe have the following (Foulis, Greechie and Ruttimann [1992], Theorem 2.12):\n\n\n4.3 Lemma:\n\nFor an orthoalgebra \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus ,0,1)\\), the following are\nequivalent:\n\n\\(a\\oplus b = a\\vee b\\), for all \\(a, b\\) in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\nIf \\(a\\oplus b, b\\oplus c\\), and \\(c\\oplus a\\) all exist, then so\ndoes \\(a\\oplus b\\oplus c\\)\nThe orthoposet \\((\\mathbf{L},\\le ,')\\) is orthomodular,\ni.e., for all \\(a, b\\in L\\), if \\(a\\le b\\) then \\((b \\wedge a') \\vee\na\\) exists and equals \\(b\\).\n\n\n\nAn orthoalgebra satisfying condition (b) is said to be\northocoherent. In other words: an orthoalgebra is\northocoherent if and only if finite pairwise summable subsets of\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) are jointly summable. The lemma tells us that every\northocoherent orthoalgebra is, inter alia, an orthomodular\nposet. Conversely, an orthocomplemented poset is orthomodular iff\n\\(a\\oplus b = a\\vee b\\) is defined for all pairs with \\(a\\le b'\\) and\nthe resulting partial binary operation is associative\u2014in which\ncase the resulting structure \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus ,0,1)\\) is an\northocoherent orthoalgebra, the canonical ordering on which agrees\nwith the given ordering on \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). Thus, orthomodular posets\n(the framework for Mackey\u2019s version of quantum logic) are\nequivalent to orthocoherent orthoalgebras.\n\nA condition related to, but stronger than, orthocoherence is that any\npairwise compatible propositions should be jointly\ncompatible. This is sometimes called regularity. Most\nnaturally occurring orthomodular lattices and posets are regular. In\nparticular, Harding (1996, 1998) has shown that the direct-product\ndecompositions of any algebraic, relational or topological structure\ncan be organized in a natural way into a regular orthomodular\n poset.[12]\n\n\nSome version of orthocoherence or regularity was taken by Mackey and\nmany of his successors as an axiom. (Orthocoherence appears, in an\ninfinitary form, as Mackey\u2019s axiom V; regularity appears in the\ndefinition of a partial Boolean algebra in the work of Kochen and\nSpecker (1965).) However, it is quite easy to construct simple model\ntest spaces, having perfectly straightforward\u2014even\nclassical\u2014interpretations, the logics of which are not\northocoherent. There has never been given any entirely compelling\nreason for regarding orthocoherence as an essential feature of all\nreasonable physical models. Moreover, certain apparently quite\nwell-motivated constructions that one wants to perform with test\nspaces tend to destroy orthocoherence (see\n section 7).\n4.3 Lattices of Properties\n\nThe decision to accept measurements and their outcomes as primitive\nconcepts in our description of physical systems does not mean that we\nmust forgo talk of the physical properties of such a system. Indeed,\nsuch talk is readily accommodated in the present formalism.[13]\n In the approach we have been pursuing, a physical system is\nrepresented by a probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\), and the\nsystem\u2019s states are identified with the probability weights in\n\\(\\Delta\\). Classically, any subset \\(\\Gamma\\) of the\nstate-space \\(\\Delta\\) corresponds to a categorical property of the\nsystem. However, in quantum mechanics, and indeed even classically,\nnot every such property will be testable (or \u201cphysical\u201d).\nIn quantum mechanics, only subsets of the state-space corresponding to\nclosed subspaces of the Hilbert space are testable; in classical\nmechanics, one usually takes only, e.g., Borel sets to correspond to\ntestable properties: the difference is that the testable properties in\nthe latter case happen still to form a Boolean algebra of sets, where\nin the former case, they do not.\n\nOne way to frame this distinction is as follows. The support\nof a set of states \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq \\Delta\\) is the set \n\n\\[S(\\Gamma) = \\{x\\in X \\mid \\exists \\omega \\in \\Gamma \\omega(x) > 0 \\}\\]\n\n\nof outcomes that are possible when the property \\(\\Gamma\\) obtains.\nThere is a sense in which two properties are empirically\nindistinguishable if they have the same support: we cannot distinguish\nbetween them by means of a single execution of a single test. We might\ntherefore wish to identify physical properties with classes of\nphysically indistinguishable classical properties, or, equivalently,\nwith their associated supports. However, if we wish to adhere to the\nprogramme of representing physical properties as subsets (rather than\nas equivalence-classes of subsets) of the state-space, we can do so,\nas follows. Define a mapping \\(F : \\wp(X) \\rightarrow \\wp(\\Delta)\\) by\n\\(F(J) = \\{\\omega \\in \\Delta \\mid S(\\omega) \\subseteq J \\}\\). The\nmapping \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow F(S(\\Gamma))\\) is then a closure\noperator on \\(\\wp(\\Delta)\\), and the collection of closed sets\n(that is, the range of \\(F)\\) is a complete lattice of sets, closed\nunder arbitrary\n intersection.[14]\n Evidently, classical properties\u2014subsets of\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u2014have the same support iff they have the same closure,\nso we may identify physical properties with closed subsets of the\nstate-space:\n\n\n4.4 Definition:\n\nThe property lattice of the model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) is\nthe complete lattice \\(\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\)\nof all subsets of \\(\\Delta\\) of the form \\(F(J), J\\) any set of\n outcomes.[15]\n\n\n\nWe now have two different \u201clogics\u201d associated with a probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) with \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) algebraic: a\n\u201clogic\u201d \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) of experimental propositions\nthat is an orthoalgebra, but generally not a lattice, and a\n\u201clogic\u201d \\(\\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) of properties\nthat is a complete lattice, but rarely orthocomplemented in any\nnatural way (Randall and Foulis [1983]). The two are connected by a\nnatural mapping [\u00a0] : \\(\\Pi \\rightarrow \\mathbf{L}\\), given by\n\\(p \\rightarrow[p] = F(J_p)\\) where for each \\(p\\in \\Pi\\), \\(J_p =\n\\{x\\in X \\mid p(x) \\nleq p' \\}\\). That is, \\(J_p\\) is the set of\noutcomes that are consistent with \\(p\\), and [\\(p\\)] is the largest\n(i.e., weakest) physical property making \\(p\\) certain to be confirmed\nif tested.\n\nThe mapping \\(p \\rightarrow[p\\)] is order preserving. For both the\nclassical and quantum-mechanical models considered above, it is in\nfact an order-isomorphism. Whenever this is the case, \\(\\Pi\\) will\ninherit from \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) the structure of a complete lattice, which\nwill then automatically be orthomodular by Lemma 4.3. In other words,\nin such cases we have only one logic, which is a complete\northomodular lattice. While it is surely too much to expect that [ ]\nwill be an order-isomorphism every conceivable physical\nsystem\u2014indeed, we can easily construct toy examples to the\ncontrary\u2014the condition is at least reasonably transparent in its\nmeaning.\n5. Piron\u2019s Theorem\n\nSuppose that the logic and property lattices of a model are\nisomorphic, so that the logic of propositions/properties is a complete\northomodular lattice. The question then arises: how close does this\nbring us to quantum mechanics\u2014that is, to the projection lattice\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) of a Hilbert space? \n\nThe answer is: without additional assumptions, not very. The lattice\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) has several quite special order-theoretic features.\nFirst it is atomic\u2014every element is the join of minimal\nnon-zero elements (i.e., one-dimensional subspaces). Second, it is\nirreducible\u2014it can not be expressed as a non-trivial\ndirect product of simpler\n OMLs.[16]\n Finally, and most significantly, it satisfies the so-called\natomic covering law: if \\(p \\in L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is an atom\nand \\(p\\nleq q\\), then \\(p \\vee q\\) covers \\(q\\) (no element\nof \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) lies strictly between \\(p \\vee q\\) and\n\\(q)\\).\n\nThese properties still do not quite suffice to capture\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\), but they do get us into the right ballpark. Let\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) be any inner product space over an involutive division\nring \\(D\\). A subspace \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is said to be\n\\(\\bot\\)-closed iff \\(\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{M}^{\\bot \\bot}\\),\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{M}^{\\bot} = \\{v\\in \\mathbf{V} \\mid \\forall m\\in\n\\mathbf{M}( \\langle v,m\\rangle = 0)\\}\\). Ordered by set-inclusion, the\ncollection \\(L(\\mathbf{V})\\) of all \\(\\bot\\)-closed subspaces of\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) forms a complete atomic lattice, orthocomplemented by\nthe mapping \\(\\mathbf{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{M}^{\\bot}\\). A theorem of\nAmemiya and Araki (1966) shows that a real, complex or quaternionic\ninner product space \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) with \\(L(\\mathbf{V})\\)\northomodular, is necessarily complete. For this reason, an inner\nproduct space \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) over an involutive division ring is\ncalled a generalized Hilbert space if its\nlattice\\(L(\\mathbf{V})\\) of \\(\\bot\\)-closed subspaces is orthomodular.\nThe following representation theorem is due to C. Piron [1964]:\n\n\n5.1 Theorem:\n\nLet \\(L\\) be a complete, atomic, irreducible orthomodular lattice\nsatisfying the atomic covering law. If \\(L\\) contains at least 4\northogonal atoms, then there exists an involutive division ring \\(D\\)\nand a generalized Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) over \\(D\\) such that\n\\(L\\) is isomorphic to \\(L(\\mathbf{V})\\). \n\n\nIt should be noted that generalized Hilbert spaces have been\nconstructed over fairly exotic division\n rings.[17]\n Thus, while it brings us tantalizingly close, Piron\u2019s theorem\ndoes not quite bring us all the way back to orthodox quantum\nmechanics.\n5.1 Conditioning and the Covering Law\n\nLet us call a complete orthomodular lattice satisfying the hypotheses\nof Piron\u2019s theorem a Piron lattice. Can we give any\ngeneral reason for supposing that the logic/property lattice of a\nphysical system (one for which these are isomorphic) is a Piron\nlattice? Or, failing this, can we at least ascribe some clear physical\ncontent to these assumptions? The atomicity of \\(L\\) follows if we\nassume that every pure state represents a \u201cphysical\nproperty\u201d. This is a strong assumption, but its content seems\nclear enough. Irreducibility is usually regarded as a benign\nassumption, in that a reducible system can be decomposed into its\nirreducible parts, to each of which Piron\u2019s Theorem applies.\n\nThe covering law presents a more delicate problem. While it is\nprobably safe to say that no simple and entirely compelling argument\nhas been given for assuming its general validity, Piron [1964, 1976]\nand others (e.g., Beltrametti and Cassinelli [1981] and Guz [1978])\nhave derived the covering law from assumptions about the way in which\nmeasurement results warrant inference from an initial state to a final\nstate. Here is a brief sketch of how this argument goes. Suppose that\nthere is some reasonable way to define, for an initial state \\(q\\) of\nthe system, represented by an atom of the logic/property lattice\n\\(L\\), a final state \\(\\phi_p (q)\\)\u2014either another atom, or\nperhaps 0\u2014conditional on the proposition \\(p\\) having been\nconfirmed. Various arguments can be adduced suggesting that the only\nreasonable candidate for such a mapping is the Sasaki\nprojection \\(\\phi_p : L \\rightarrow L\\), defined by\n\n\\(\\phi_p (q) = (q \\vee p') \\wedge\n p\\).[18]\n\nIt can be shown that an atomic OML satisfies the atomic covering law\njust in case Sasaki projections take atoms again to atoms, or to 0.\nAnother interesting view of the covering law is developed by Cohen and\nSvetlichny [1987].\n6. Classical Representations\n\nThe perennial question in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is\nthat of whether or not essentially classical explanations are\navailable, even in principle, for quantum-mechanical phenomena.\nQuantum logic has played a large role in shaping (and clarifying) this\ndiscussion, in particular by allowing us to be quite precise about\nwhat we mean by a classical explanation. \n6.1 Classical Embeddings\n\nSuppose we are given a statistical model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\). A\nvery straightforward approach to constructing a \u201cclassical\ninterpretation\u201d of \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) would begin by\ntrying to embed \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) in a Borel test space \\(\\mathcal{B}\\),\nwith the hope of then accounting for the statistical states in\n\\(\\delta\\) as averages over \u201chidden\u201d classical\u2014that\nis, dispersion-free\u2014states on the latter. Thus, we\u2019d want\nto find a set \\(S\\) and a mapping \\(X \\rightarrow \\wp(S)\\) assigning\nto each outcome \\(x\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) a set \\(x* \\subseteq\nS\\) in such a way that, for each test \\(E \\in \\mathcal{A}, \\{x* \\mid x\n\\in E\\}\\) forms a partition of \\(S\\). If this can be done, then each\noutcome \\(x\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) simply records the fact that the\nsystem is in one of a certain set of states, namely, \\(x\\)*. If we let\n\\(\\Sigma\\) be the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of sets generated by sets of the\nform \\(\\{x* \\mid x \\in X\\}\\), we find that each probability measure\n\\(\\mu\\) on \\(\\Sigma\\) pulls back to a state \\(\\mu\\)* on\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\), namely, \\(\\mu *(x) = \\mu(x\\)*). So long as every\nstate in \\(\\delta\\) is of this form, we may claim to have given a\ncompletely classical interpretation of the model\n\\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\).\n\nThe minimal candidate for \\(S\\) is the set of all\ndispersion-free states on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). Setting \\(x* = \\{s\\in S\n\\mid s(x) = 1\\}\\) gives us a classical interpretation as above, which\nI\u2019ll call the classical image of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). Any\nother classical interpretation factors through this one. Notice,\nhowever, that the mapping \\(x \\rightarrow x\\)* is injective only if\nthere are sufficiently many dispersion-free states to separate\ndistinct outcomes of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). If \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) has \\(no\\)\ndispersion-free states at all, then its classical image is\nempty. Gleason\u2019s theorem tells us that this is the case\nfor quantum-mechanical models. Thus, this particular kind of classical\nexplanation is not available for quantum mechanical models.\n\nIt is sometimes overlooked that, even if a test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\ndoes have a separating set of dispersion-free states, there may exist\nstatistical states on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) that can not be\nrealized as mixtures of these. The classical image provides no\nexplanation for such states. For a very simple example of this sort of\nthing, consider the the test space: \n\n\\[\\mathcal{A} = \\{\\{a, x, b\\}, \\{b, y, c\\}, \\{c, z, a\\}\\}\\]\n\n\n and the state\n\\(\\omega(a) = \\omega(b) = \\omega(c) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\omega(x) =\n\\omega(y) = \\omega(z) = 0\\). It is a simple exercise to show that\n\\(\\omega\\) cannot be expressed as a weighted average of\n\\(\\{0,1\\}\\)-valued states on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). For further examples and\ndiscussion of this point, see Wright [1980].\n6.2 Contextual Hidden Variables\n\nThe upshot of the foregoing discussion is that most test spaces\ncan\u2019t be embedded into any classical test space, and that even\nwhere such an embedding exists, it typically fails to account for some\nof the model\u2019s states. However, there is one very important\nclass of models for which a satisfactory classical interpretation is\nalways possible. Let us call a test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nsemi-classical if its tests do not overlap; i.e., if \\(E \\cap\nF = \\varnothing\\) for \\(E, F \\in \\mathcal{A}\\), with \\(E\\ne F\\).\n\n\n6.1 Lemma:\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be semi-classical. Then \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) has a\nseparating set of dispersion-free states, and every extreme state on\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is dispersion-free. \n\n\nAs long as \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is locally countable (i.e., no test \\(E\\)\nin \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is uncountable), every state can be represented as\na convex combination, in a suitable sense, of extreme states (Wilce\n[1992]). Thus, every state of a locally countable semi-classical test\nspace has a classical interpretation.\n\nEven though neither Borel test spaces nor quantum test spaces are\nsemi-classical, one might argue that in any real laboratory situation,\nsemi-classicality is the rule. Ordinarily, when one writes down in\none\u2019s laboratory notebook that one has performed a given test\nand obtained a given outcome, one always has a record of which test\nwas performed. Indeed, given any test space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), we may\nalways form a semi-classical test space simply by forming the\nco-product (disjoint union) of the tests in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). More\nformally:\n\n\n6.2 Definition:\n\nFor each test \\(E\\) in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), let \\(E^{\\sim} = \\{ (x,E) \\mid\nx \\in E \\}\\). The semi-classical cover of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is\nthe test space \n\n\\[\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim} = \\{E^{\\sim} \\mid E \\in \\mathcal{A} \\}.\\]\n\n\n\nWe can regard \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) as arising from \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\)\nby deletion of the record of which test was performed to secure a\ngiven outcome. Note that every state on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) defines a\nstate \\(\\omega^{\\sim}\\) on \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\) by \\(\\omega^{\\sim}\n(x,E) = \\omega(x)\\). The mapping \\(\\omega \\rightarrow \\omega^{\\sim}\\)\nis plainly injective; thus, we may identify the state-space of\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) with a subset of the state-space of\n\\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\). Notice that there will typically be many\nstates on \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\) that do not descend to\nstates on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). We might wish to think of these as\n\u201cnon-physical\u201d, since they do not respect the (presumably,\nphysically motivated) outcome-identifications whereby \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nis defined.\n\nSince it is semi-classical, \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\) admits a classical\ninterpretation, as per Lemma 7.1. Let\u2019s examine this. An element\nof \\(S(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\)) amounts to a mapping \\(f :\n\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim} \\rightarrow X\\), assigning to each test \\(E \\in\n\\mathcal{A}\\), an outcome \\(f(E) \\in E\\). This is a (rather brutal)\nexample of what is meant by a contextual (dispersion-free) hidden\nvariable. The construction above tells us that such contextual\nhidden variables will be available for statistical models quite\ngenerally. For other results to the same effect, see Kochen and\nSpecker [1967], Gudder [1970], Holevo [1982], and, in a different\ndirection, Pitowsky\n [1989].[19]\n\nNote that the simple random variables on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) correspond\nexactly to the simple random variables on \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\), and\nthat these, in turn, correspond to some of the simple random\nvariables (in the usual sense) on the measurable space\n\\(S(\\mathcal{A}^{\\sim}\\)). Thus, we have the following picture: The\nmodel \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) can always be obtained from a classical\nmodel simply by omitting some random variables, and identifying\noutcomes that can no longer be distinguished by those that remain.\n\nAll of this might suggest that our generalized probability theory\npresents no significant conceptual departure from classical\nprobability theory. On the other hand, models constructed along the\nforegoing lines have a distinctly ad hoc character. In particular, the\nset of \u201cphysical\u201d states in one of the classical (or\nsemi-classical) models constructed above is determined not by any\nindependent physical principle, but only by consistency with the\noriginal, non-semiclassical model. Another objection is that the\ncontextual hidden variables introduced in this section are badly\nnon-local. It is by now widely recognized that this non-locality is\nthe principal locus of non-classicality in quantum (and more general)\nprobability models. (For more on this, see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s theorem.)\n7. Composite Systems\n\nSome of the most puzzling features of quantum mechanics arise in\nconnection with attempts to describe compound physical systems. It is\nin this context, for instance, that both the measurement problem and\nthe non-locality results centered on Bell\u2019s theorem arise. It is\ninteresting that coupled systems also present a challenge to the\nquantum-logical programme. I will conclude this article with a\ndescription of two results that show that the coupling of\nquantum-logical models tends to move us further from the realm of\nHilbert space quantum mechanics. \n7.1 The Foulis-Randall Example\n\nA particularly striking result in this connection is the observation\nof Foulis and Randall [1981a] that any reasonable (and reasonably\ngeneral) tensor product of orthoalgebras will fail to preserve\northo-coherence. Consider the test space \n\n\\[\\mathcal{A}_5 = \\{\\{a,x,b\\}, \\{b,y,c\\}, \\{c,z,d\\}, \\{d,w,e\\}, \\{e,v,a\\}\\}\\]\n\n\n consisting of\nfive three-outcome tests pasted together in a loop. This test space is\nby no means pathological; it is both ortho-coherent and algebraic, and\nits logic is an orthomodular lattice. Moreover, it admits a separating\nset of dispersion-free states and hence, a classical interpretation.\nIt can also be embedded in the test space \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{H}}\\)\nof any 3-dimensional Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). Now consider how we\nmight model a compound system consisting of two separated sub-systems\neach modeled by \\(\\mathcal{A}_5\\). We would need to construct a test\nspace \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and a mapping \\(\\otimes : X \\times X \\rightarrow\nY = \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\) satisfying, minimally, the following;\n\nFor all outcomes \\(x, y, z \\in X\\), if \\(x\\binbot y\\), then\n\\(x\\otimes z \\binbot y\\otimes z\\) and \\(z\\otimes x \\binbot z\\otimes\ny\\),\nFor each pair of states \\(\\alpha , \\beta \\in\n\\Omega(\\mathcal{A}_5)\\), there exists at least one state \\(\\omega\\) on\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) such that \\(\\omega(x\\otimes y) = \\alpha(x)\\beta(y)\\),\nfor all outcomes \\(x, y \\in X\\).\n\n\nFoulis and Randall show that no such embedding exists for which\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is orthocoherent. Indeed, suppose we have a test space\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and an embedding satisfying conditions (a) and (b).\nConsider the set of outcomes \n\n\\[S = \\{a \\otimes b, b \\otimes e, c \\otimes c, d \\otimes a, e \\otimes d\\}.\\]\n\n\n By (a), this set is pairwise\northogonal. Now let \\(\\alpha\\) be the state on \\(\\mathcal{A}_5\\)\ntaking the value 1/2 on outcomes \\(a, b, c, d\\) and \\(e\\), and the\nvalue 0 on \\(x, y, z, w\\) and \\(v\\). By condition (b), there exists\nstate \\(\\omega\\) on \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) such that \n\n\\[\\omega(s \\otimes t) = \\alpha(s) \\alpha(t)\\]\n\n\n for all\noutcomes \\(s, t\\) in \\(X\\). But this state takes the constant value\n1/4 on the set \\(S\\), whence, it sums over this set to \\(5/4 \\gt 1\\).\nHence, \\(S\\) is not an event, and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is not\northocoherent.\n\nIt is important to emphasize here that the test space\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_5\\) has a perfectly unproblematic quantum-mechanical\ninterpretation, as it can be realized as a set of orthonormal bases in\na 3-dimensional Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). However, the\nstate \\(\\omega\\) figuring in the Foulis-Randall example\ncannot arise quantum-mechanically (much less classically). (Indeed,\nthis follows from the example itself: the canonical mapping\n\\(\\mathbf{H} \\times \\mathbf{H} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{H} \\otimes\n\\mathbf{H}\\) provides a mapping satisfying the conditions (a) and (b)\nabove. Since \\(\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{H} \\otimes \\mathbf{H})\\) is\northocoherent, the set S corresponds to a pairwise orthogonal family\nof projections, over which a quantum-mechanical state would have to\nsum to no more than 1.) \n7.2 Aerts\u2019 Theorem\n\nAnother result having a somewhat similar force is that of Aerts\n[1981]. If \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) are two Piron lattices, Aerts\nconstructs in a rather natural way a lattice \\(L\\) representing two\nseparated systems, each modeled by one of the given lattices.\nHere \u201cseparated\u201d means that each pure state of the larger\nsystem \\(L\\) is entirely determined by the states of the two component\nsystems \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\). Aerts then shows that \\(L\\) is again a\nPiron lattice iff at least one of the two factors \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\)\nis classical. (This result has recently been strengthened by Ischi\n[2000] in several ways.)\n7.3 Ramifications\n\nThe thrust of these no-go results is that straightforward\nconstructions of plausible models for composite systems destroy\nregularity conditions (ortho-coherence in the case of the\nFoulis-Randall result, orthomodularity and the covering law in that of\nAerts\u2019 result) that have widely been used to underwrite\nreconstructions of the usual quantum-mechanical formalism. This puts\nin doubt whether any of these conditions can be regarded as having the\nuniversality that the most optimistic version of Mackey\u2019s\nprogramme asks for. Of course, this does not rule out the possibility\nthat these conditions may yet be motivated in the case of especially\nsimple physical systems.\n\nIn some quarters, the fact that the most traditional models of quantum\nlogics lack a reasonable tensor product have have been seen as\nheralding the collapse of the entire quantum-logical enterprise. This\nreaction is premature. The Foulis-Randall example, for instance, shows\nthat there can be no general tensor product that behaves properly on\nall orthomodular lattices or orthomodular posets (that is,\northocoherent orthoalgebras), and on all states\nthereon. But this does not rule out the existence of a satisfactory tensor\nproduct for classes of structures larger than that of\northomodular posets, or smaller than that of orthomodular\nlattices, or for classes of orthomodular lattices or posets with\nrestricted state spaces. Quantum Mechanics itself provides one example. \nFor another, as Foulis and Randall showed in\nFoulis and Randall [1981a], the class of unital\northoalgebras\u2014that is, orthoalgebras in which every proposition\nhas probability 1 in some state\u2014does support a\ncanonical tensor product satisfying their conditions (a) and (b).  \n\nMoving in the opposite direction, one can take it as an axiomatic\nrequirement that a satisfactory physical theory be closed under some\nreasonable device for coupling separated systems. This suggests taking\nclasses of systems, i.e., physical theories, as distinct from\nindividual systems, as the focus of attention. And in fact, this is\nexactly the trend in much current work on the foundations of quantum\nmechanics. \n\nA particularly fruitful approach of this kind, due to Abramsky and\nCoecke [2009] takes a physical theory to be represented by a symmetric\nmonoidal category\u2014roughly, a category equipped with a naturally\nsymmetric and associative tensor product. Subject to some further\nconstraints (e.g., compact closure), such categories exhibit formal\nproperties strikingly reminiscent of quantum mechanics. Interestingly,\nit has recently been shown by Harding [2009] that, in every strongly\ncompact closed category with biproducts, every object is associated\nwith an orthomodular poset Proj\\((A)\\) of \u201cweak\nprojections\u201d, and that Proj\\((A \\otimes B)\\) behaves in many\nrespects as a sensible tensor product for Proj\\((A)\\) and Proj\\((B)\\).\nFrom this perspective, the FR example simply exhibits a pathological\nexample \u2014 \\(A_5\\) and the state \\(\\alpha\\) \u2014 that can not\nbe accommodated in such a theory, establishing that the monoidality\nrequirement imposes a nontrivial restriction on the structure of\nindividual systems.\n\n\nThis recent emphasis on systems in interaction is part of a more\ngeneral shift of attention away from the static structure of states\nand observables and towards the processes in which physical\nsystems can participate. This trend is evident not only in the\ncategory-theoretic formulation of Abramsky and Coecke (see also Coecke\n[2011]), but also in several recent axiomatic reconstructions of\nquantum theory (e.g., Hardy [2001, Other Internet Resources], Rau\n[2009], Dakic-Brukner [2011], Massanes and Mueller [2011],\nChiribella-D\u2019Ariano-Perinotti [2011], Wilce [2018]), most of\nwhich involve assumptions about how physical systems combine. In a\ndifferent direction, Baltag and Smets [2005] enrich a Piron-style\nlattice-theoretic framework with an explicitly dynamical element,\narriving at a quantum analogue of propositional dynamical logic.\n8. Effect Algebras \n \nAnother recent development was the introduction in the early 1990s of\nstructures called effect algebras  (Foulis and Bennett\n[1994]) generalizing the orthoalgebras discussed in sect 4.1.  The\ndefinition is almost identical, except that the weaker condition \\(a\n\\perp a \\Rightarrow a = 0\\) is replaced by the weaker condition \\(a\n\\perp 1 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ a = 0\\). Like orthoalgebras, effect algebras\nare partially ordered by setting \\(a \\leq b\\) iff \\(b = a \\oplus c\\)\nfor some \\(c \\perp \na\\).[20]\n\n\nA simple but important example is the effect algebra \\([0,1]^{E}\\) of\nfunctions \\(\\,f : E \\rightarrow [0,1]\\), with \\(f \\perp g\\) iff \\(f + g\n\\leq 1\\) and, in that case, \\(f \\oplus g = f + g\\). One can regard\nelements of \\([0,1]^{E}\\) as \u201cunsharp\u201d or\n\u201cfuzzy\u201d versions of indicator functions \\(f : E\n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\). The set \\(\\{0,1\\}^{E}\\) of indicator\nfunctions, regarded as a subeffect algebra of \\([0,1]^{E}\\), is an\northoalgebra and, of course, isomorphic to the boolean algebra of\nsubsets of \\(E\\).[21]\n\nEffect algebras exist in great abundance. In particular, if \\(\\Omega\\)\nis a convex set arising as the state-space of a probabilistic model,\nthen the set \\({\\mathcal E}(\\Omega)\\) of bounded affine\n(convex-linear) functions \\(f : \\Omega \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) form an\neffect algebra, with \\(f \\oplus g = f + g\\) if \\(f + g \\leq 1\\).  The\nidea is that a function \\(\\,f \\in {\\mathcal E}(\\Omega)\\) represents an\n\"in principle\" measurement outcome, with probability \\(f(\\alpha)\\) in\nstate \\(\\alpha \\in \\Omega\\).  If \\(f_0,...,f_n \\in {\\mathcal\nE}(\\Omega)\\) with \\(f_0 + \\cdots + f_n = 1\\), then the sequence\n\\((f_0,...,f_n)\\) rpresents an \u201cin principle\u201d observable with values\n\\(i = 0,...,n\\), taking value \\(i\\) with probability\n\\(f_i(\\alpha)\\).\n8.1 Quantum Effects and Naimark\u2019s Theorem \n\nIn the special case where \\(\\Omega = \\Omega(\\mathbf{H})\\), the set of\ndensity operators on a Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), one can show\nthat every effect \\(f\\) on \\(\\Omega\\) has the form \\(\\,f(W) =\n\\textrm{Tr}(W a)\\) for a unique positive self-adjoint operator \\(a\\)\nwith \\(a \\leq 1\\). Conversely, such an operator\ndefines an effect through the formula just given. One therefore\nidentifies \\(\\mathcal{E}(\\Omega(\\mathbf{H}))\\) with the set\n\\(\\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{H})\\) of all positive self-adjoint operators on\n\\(\\mathbf{H})\\) with \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 1\\), referring to these also as\neffects.\n\nArbitrary quantum effects, and arbitrary effect-valued observables,\narise quite naturally as models of actual experimental\noutcomes. Consider an isolated quantum system \\(A\\) with Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathbf{H}_A\\), and an ancillary system \\(B\\), with Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathbf{H}_{B}\\), maintained in a reference state represented by a\ndensity operator \\(W^{B}_o\\).  If \\(A\\) is in the state represented by\na density operator \\(W^{A}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{H}_A\\), thet state of the\njoint system is represented by \\(W^{A} \\otimes W^{B}_o\\). If we make a\nyes-no measurement on \\(AB\\) represented by a projection operator\n\\(P_{AB}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{H}_{AB} = \\mathbf{H}_{A} \\otimes\n\\mathbf{H}_{B}\\) then the probability of obtaining a positive result\nis \\(\\textrm{Tr}(P_{AB}(W^{A} \\otimes W^{B}_{o}))\\). This defines a\nbounded convex-linear function of \\(W^{A}\\), and hence, there is a\nunique effect \\(a\\) with \\(\\textrm{Tr}((W^{A} \\otimes\nW^{B}_{o})P_{AB}) = \\textrm{Tr}(W^{A} a)\\).  This effect \\(a\\) is\ncalled the compression of \\(P_{AB}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{H}_{A}.\\)\nIn other words, we can understand \\(a\\) as representing the result of\nmeasuring \\(P_{AB}\\) on the combined system \\(AB\\), holding \\(B\\) in\nstate \\(W^{B}_o\\), and then \u201cforgetting about\u201d the\nancillary system \\(B\\).\n\nIt is not difficult to show that every every effect on \\(A\\) arises in\nthis way from a projection on \\(\\mathbf{H}_{A} \\otimes\n\\mathbf{H}_{B}\\) for a suitable Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}_{B}\\). More\ngenerally, a classic result in operator theory known as Naimark\u2019s\nTheorem  asserts that any effect-valued observable\n\\(a_1,...,a_n\\) on \\(A\\) arises by compression of an ordinary\nprojection-valued observable \\(P_1,...,P_n\\) on \\(AB\\) for a suitable\nquantum system \\(B\\).  Thus, all effects, and indeed all effect-valued\nobservables, on \\(A\\) are physically realizable. In view of this, it\nis difficult to see why effect algebras should have any less claim to\nthe status of a \u201cquantum logic\u201d than do, say, orthomodular posets.\n\n8.2 Sequential effect algebras \n \nA natural question is whether one can characterize those effect\nalgebras of the special form \\(\\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{H})\\).  One way in\nwhich effects arise naturally is in the context of sequential\nmeasurements.  If \\(P\\) is a projection, a measurement of \\(P\\) in\nstate corresponding to the density operator \\(W\\) leaves the system in\nthe state corresponding to the density operator\n\n \\[W_{p} := \\frac{P W P}{\\textrm{Tr}(W P)}.\\] \n\n\nA subsequent measurement of \\(q\\) in this\nstate then yields a positive result with probability \\begin{equation}\n\\textrm{Tr}(W_{P} Q) = \\frac{\\textrm{Tr}(QP W PQ)}{\\textrm{Tr}(W P)} =\n\\frac{\\textrm{Tr}(W PQP)}{\\textrm{Tr}(W P)}.  \\end{equation} The\noperator \\(PQP\\) is not a projection unless \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) commute,\nbut is always an effect.  If we write \\(\\Pr(a|W)\\) for\n\\(\\textrm{Tr}(Wa)\\) for arbitrary effects \\(a\\), then the above can be\nrewritten, perhaps more transparently, as\n\n \\[\\Pr(Q|W_{P})\\Pr(P|W) \\ = \\ \\Pr(PQP |W).\\] \n\n\nThus, \\(PQP\\) represents the \u201c(yes,yes)\u201d-outcome in a\nsequential measurement of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) (in that order).\n\n\nMore generally, the sequential product \\(a \\odot b :=\n\\sqrt{a}b\\sqrt{a}\\) of two effects is another effect, representing the\nresult of observing first \\(a\\) and then \\(b\\) in a sequential\nmeasurement (and assuming the state updates according to \\(W \\mapsto\n(\\textrm{Tr}(Wa))^{-1} \\sqrt{a} W \\sqrt{a}\\) after measurement of\n\\(a\\)).  Abstracting from this example, S. Gudder and R. J. Greechie\n([2002]) defined a sequential effect algebra to be an effect\nalgebra \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus,0,1)\\) equipped with a binary operation\n\\(\\odot : \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{L} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{L}\\)\nsatisfying the following conditions for all \\(a,b,c \\in \\mathbf{L}\\),\nwhere \\(a | b\\) means \\(a \\odot b = b \\odot a\\):\n\n\nIf \\(b \\perp c\\), then \\(a \\circ b \\perp a \\circ c\\) and \n\\(a \\circ (b \\oplus c) = (a \\circ b) \\oplus (a \\circ c)\\)\n\\(1 \\circ a = a\\)\nIf \\(a \\circ b = 0\\), then \\(b \\circ a = 0\\) \nIf \\(a | b\\) then \\(a | b'\\), and \\(a \\circ (b \\circ c) = (a \\circ\nb) \\circ c\\)\nIf \\(a | b\\) and \\(a | c\\), then (i) \\(a | b \\circ c\\) and, (ii)\nif \\(b \\perp c\\), \\(c | a \\oplus b\\) \n\n\nA remarkable recent result of J. van de Wetering ([2019]) shows that\nany finite-dimensional order-unit space whose order interval \\([0,u]\\)\nis an SEA under a binary operation continuous in the first variable,\nis a euclidean (equivalently, formally real) Jordan algebra in a\nnatural\n way.[22]\n\n",
