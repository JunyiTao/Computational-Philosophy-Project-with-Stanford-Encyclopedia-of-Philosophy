    "main_text": "Critical Concepts || Ideology\n3.3 Ideology\n\nIdeology is similar to alienation and reification in being both a\nconcept critical theory inherits from the Marxist tradition and one\nthat is used to identify a distorted relationship to the world and\none\u2019s own place in it (Eagleton 1991). In the Marxist tradition,\nit has played a prominent role in answering questions such as why\npeople accept social and political conditions that seem to be contrary\nto their own interests, or how it is possible that subjects feel free\nalthough they are dominated. When people experience and describe\nrelations of exploitation and domination as natural and without\nalternative or even as just, this seems to be an effect of ideology.\nIdeology, on this critical understanding, usually denotes a more or\nless coherent system of action-guiding beliefs, such as liberal\nindividualism, that is said to obscure social reality \u2013\nespecially power relations, crisis tendencies, and social conflicts.\nAs Marx (1844, 1846, 1867) and subsequent critical theorists argue, by\nobscuring these, ideology contributes to the reproduction of the\nprevailing order (Rosen 1996). Accordingly, any radically\ntransformative and emancipatory practice presupposes that this\nideological obfuscation must be recognized as such, criticized, and\novercome. The challenge to such critical reflection is particularly\nacute when the possibility of even asking questions about how we might\nwant to live, if we could transform society, is occluded by a\ntechnocratic ideology that reframes such practical questions as\ntechnical problems with narrow solutions (Habermas 1963, 1968a).\n\nIdeology differs from mere deception, propaganda, or conspiracy\ntheories. Because it is structurally anchored in social reality and\nplays a functional role for its reproduction, it cannot be explained\nwith reference to the individual psyche or manipulation by others\nalone. Even if false consciousness is an element of ideology, critical\ntheorists from Adorno to Jaeggi emphasize the practical nature of\nideology as it shapes identities, is embedded in social practice, and\nfunctions via affects and habitus.\n\nAccording to one influential interpretation, the critical notion of\nideology developed in the Frankfurt School is characterized by three\ndimensions (Geuss 1981, Jaeggi 2008). In the first, epistemic\ndimension, ideologies always encompass epistemically deficient beliefs\nand attitudes that can range from substantially false beliefs to the\nconfusion of particular and universal interests and inadequate\nconcepts (such as \u201cillegal alien\u201d to refer to undocumented\nimmigrants). In the second, functional dimension, ideologies are seen\nas playing a necessary, or at least supporting, role for the\nstabilization and legitimation of social relations of domination, i.e.\nfor their more or less smooth reproduction. In the third, genetic\ndimension, ideologies are shaped, in ways that are not transparent to\nthe agents themselves, by the social conditions under which they\nemerge, so that it is not an accident that people end up with the\nspecific sets of beliefs they end up with in a specific type of\nsociety.\n\nRadicalizing the Marxist notion of ideology as \u201cnecessarily\nfalse consciousness,\u201d i.e. consciousness that is false (and not\nsimply morally problematic) for structural reasons (and not just\naccidentally), Adorno and Marcuse often seem to argue that ideology\nreaches into the innermost core of subjects, who are shaped all the\nway down to their psychological and physical impulses, leading them to\naffirm the existing order and thereby preempting any resistance to\ndomination. While this might help explain the resilience of ideology\nand its continued effectiveness, it also poses the challenge for\ncritical theorists to find an anchor for their critique in the forms\nof consciousness, experience, and practice of its addressees\n(Celikates 2006, and\n Section 2.5\n above).\n\nDue to its emancipatory orientation, the critique of ideology must\nconnect up with the self-understanding of those affected by trying to\ninitiate learning processes, which in turn are supposed to lead to a\ntransformation of those social conditions that are hidden behind\nideologies. At the same time, without recourse to critical theories\nagents themselves will often continue to face obstacles to\nidentifying, diagnosing, and explaining the effects of ideology on\ntheir critical capacities and practices. Arguably, showing that a\ncontradiction is inscribed in the existing social order and can only\nbe \u201cdissolved\u201d if this order itself is fundamentally\ntransformed is also a task for a critical theory.\n\nAlthough for most critical theorists ideology is not merely false\nconsciousness but embedded in social practices and identities,\nideology critique has been criticized for being overly cognitivist and\nunderestimating the role of habitualized attitudes and cultural\npractices, for relying on an overly strong distinction between true\nand distorted consciousness, and for presupposing an idealized notion\nof the subject. Critics such as Foucault and Bourdieu speak instead of\npower-knowledge (Foucault 1973, 15) or of symbolic power and its\nembodiment (Bourdieu 1980, Ch. 8). The epistemological and political\nchallenges the notion of ideology gives rise to continue to animate\ndiscussions (Celikates, Haslanger, and Stanley (eds.) forthcoming),\nincluding, more recently, on the relation between ideology and\nepistemic injustice (Fricker 2007, Mills 2017), cultural techn\u0113\n(Haslanger 2017a), and propaganda (Stanley 2015).\n",
