    "main_text": "\n\nThis much is agreed: \u201cx makes it true that\np\u201d is a construction that signifies, if it signifies\nanything at all, a relation borne to a truth-bearer by something else,\na truth-maker. But it isn\u2019t generally agreed what that something\nelse might be, or what truth-bearers are, or what the character might\nbe of the relationship that holds, if it does, between them, or even\nwhether such a relationship ever does hold. Indeed sometimes\nthere\u2019s barely enough agreement amongst the parties to the\ntruth-maker dispute for them to be disagreeing about a common subject\nmatter. This makes navigating the literature about truth-makers a\ntreacherous undertaking but a necessary one because of the\nsignificance the debate about truth-makers bears for contemporary\nmetaphysics.\n\nWe can distinguish between the following questions that different\napproaches to truth-makers have been framed to answer:\n\nWhat is it to be a truth-maker?\nWhich range, or ranges, of truths are eligible to be made true (if\nany are)?\nWhat kinds of entities are truth-makers?\nWhat is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers?\n\n\nThese questions cannot be addressed in isolation from one another. Our\nthinking about what it is to be a truth-maker will likely have\nknock-on effects for how we answer the second and third questions. Our\nbeliefs about which truths have truth-makers will likely shape our\nanswer to the first and third. And the theoretical benefits that we\nthink will come our way from positing truth-makers in the first place\nwill no doubt exert a controlling influence upon our responses to the\nother questions. We\u2019ll start with the issue of what it is to be\na truth-maker.\n\nThe notion of a truth-maker, like that of a clapping hand, cannot\nultimately be understood in isolation from the notion of what it makes\ntrue, the other hand with which it claps, a truth-bearer. There are a\nvariety of different candidate fillers for the role of\ntruth-bearers\u2014sentence tokens, judgements, propositions\netc\u2014and very often discussion of truth-makers and\ntruth-making proceeds without an eye to which candidate best fills\nthis role. This is understandable: metaphysicians are typically\ninterested in what there is rather than representations thereof. But\ntruth-bearers are the elephant in the room during these discussions.\nEventually we\u2019ll have to talk about them because what we think\nabout truth-bearers will have consequences for what we think about\ntruth-makers. So there\u2019s a further question that we can\u2019t\nput off answering indefinitely,\n\nWhat are the truth-bearers?\n\n\nFor the time being we\u2019ll remain relatively non-committal about\nthe character of truth-bearers except for making the minimal\nassumption that truth-bearers are inherently representational in\ncharacter. But eventually the issue will become unavoidable.\n\nI will not dwell upon the history of the concept truth-maker.\nAnticipations of the contemporary use of the concept have been found\nin Aristotle and Suarez (Fox 1987; K\u00fcnne 2003: 150\u20134;\nSchmutz 2007), Leibniz (Armstrong 1997: 14; Mulligan 2009:\n39\u201342), Russell and Wittgenstein (Hochberg 1978; Mulligan,\nSimons, & Smith 1984: 287\u20139, 308\u201312; Simons 1992:\n156\u201361; K\u00fcnne 2003: 118\u2013226, 145\u20138), Stout,\nMcTaggart and Pf\u00e4nder (Mulligan 2009). But it has also been\ndisputed whether these authors are really deploying the concept of\ntruth-making with which we are familiar rather than\nemploying, perhaps for reasons of grammatical convenience,\nsuperficially similar turns of phrase that make it sound as if they\nare expressing our concept (Dodd 2002: 81\u20133; MacBride 2005:\n137\u20139; Glock 2007).\n",
