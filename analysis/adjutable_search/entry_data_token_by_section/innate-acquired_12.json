The basic idea is that the concept of innateness is\na cornerstone of \u201cfolk biology\u201d (Medin and Atran 1999;\n2004), the pre-theoretical beliefs that people intuitively use to\nunderstand biological systems. Part of folk biology involves the\nclassification of organisms into species-like groupings. These\nclassifications sometimes overlap with scientific classifications, but\noften they diverge. For example, a folk biological classification\nmight identify horses, roses, and octopuses as species-like groupings,\nwhen in fact each of these biological categories contain numerous\nspecies, some of which are morphologically and phylogenetically\ndisparate.\n\nFolk biology also departs from scientific classification in its\nessentialist commitments. Across a wide range of cultures, people tend\nto assume that members of each species possess a common essence or\ncausal nature that determines their appearance, behavior, and\necological roles (Medin and Atran 2004). Psychologists have found that\neven when people have no specific ideas about the nature of a\nparticular species, they nonetheless assume that it must have an\nessence (i.e. they operate with what Medin and Ortony (1989) call an\n\u201cessence placeholder\u201d). It is plausible that folk\nessentialism has served our species well for most of its history.\nMedin and Atran (2004) propose that the existence of an essence\nplaceholder might have motivated people to explore their environments,\nleading them to discover and share information about edible or\nmedicinal plants, about dangerous plants and animals, and other\nsalient aspects of the environment. The idea of an essence might also\nhave assisted humans in tasks associated with agriculture and animal\nhusbandry. Despite its utility, however, essentialism is\nscientifically inaccurate. No internal essence explains why members of\na species share certain traits. Although genetic similarities account\nfor some of the traits that are typical of a species, it is misleading\nto think of a species\u2019 genome as its essence. Elliott Sober\n(1980) provides a detailed account of what is wrong with this idea.\nEssentialism, he notes, employs a Natural State Model of explanation\nwhich views every member of a species as directed toward a single\ndevelopmental outcome (natural state). Essentialists recognize that\nindividuals vary in the characteristics they actually express.\nHowever, such variability is explained according to essentialism by\npositing the effects of intervening forces that interrupt development\nand prevent the full realization of its goal. The reason that\nindividuals of the same sex differ in their sexual preference, on this\nview, is because of slightly different environmental factors impinging\non the development of these individuals. By contrast, on a\nneo-Darwinian model there is no natural state. Individual variability\nis partly explained in terms of genetic variation passed on from one\ngeneration to the next. Moreover, even given a specific genetic\nstarting point, development is not aiming at some specific, natural\nstate, but simply goes wherever local causes push it. The interaction\nbetween genetic and environmental factors is most accurately\nrepresented as a norm of reaction (see Section 3.2 below), where a\nspectrum of developmental outcomes is associated with each unique\ngenotype in a population of genetically variable individuals. This\nneo-Darwinian perspective requires a fairly dramatic shift in\nconventional thinking about species. As Atran et al. (2002, 32) put\nit, \u201cto understand modern biological science, people must\nunlearn universal dispositions to view species\nessentialistically\u201d.\n\nGriffiths (2002) hypothesized that folk essentialism might be exerting\nan influence even on scientists\u2019 and philosophers\u2019\nprofessional judgments about innateness. More precisely, the\nhypothesis states that (1) there is a \u201cfolk\u201d or vernacular\nconcept of innateness that most people operate with in non-technical\ncontexts, (2) this vernacular concept is incompatible with scientific\ndevelopments in such fields as evolutionary and developmental biology,\nand (3) that researchers working in psychology and perhaps other\ndisciplines will employ the vernacular concept of innateness (often\ninadvertently) even when reasoning in a scientific context. Machery et\nal. (2019) have more recently dubbed this the \u201cattractor\nhypothesis\u201d of innateness, because of its similarity to the idea\nof a psychological attractor in cultural evolution (Sperber 1996;\nClaidi\u00e8re and Sperber 2007). An implication of the attractor\nhypothesis of innateness is that the concept of an innate trait will\nbe highly resistant to scientific revision. Despite attempts to refine\nthe concept, researchers will continue to default to the vernacular\nconcept, the theory goes, and draw faulty inferences despite their\nefforts to avoid equivocation. Griffiths (2002) draws the normative\nconclusion that the concept of innateness should be self-consciously\neliminated from scientific discourse. This proposal will be discussed\nbelow (Section 3.5). The remainder of this subsection discusses recent\nexperimental evidence surrounding the attractor hypothesis of\ninnateness.\n\nPhilosophers have devised a number of questionnaire studies exploring\nthe structure of the vernacular concept of innateness (Griffiths, et\nal. 2009; Linquist et al. 2011; Knobe and Samuels 2013) and whether\nthe vernacular concept features in scientists\u2019 judgments about\ninnateness (Knobe and Samuels 2013; Machery et al. 2019). Drawing\nagain from the psychological literature on folk biology, Griffiths et\nal. (2009) identified three features that are thought to be central to\nthe vernacular concept of innateness:\n\nFixity: Innate traits are insensitive to environmental influences\nduring development.\nTypicality: Innate traits are shared by most adult members of the\nsame species or sex.\nFunction: Innate traits serve some purpose or end for the\norganism.\n\n\nThe authors tested this \u201cthree feature theory\u201d (as they\ncall it) using a questionnaire describing examples of birdsong that\ndiffered in Fixity, Typicality, and Function. The aim was to determine\nthe extent to which each factor independently contributes to\nfolk judgments about innateness. This experiment was first conducted\non na\u00efve or non-expert subjects with the aim of first determining\nthe structure of the vernacular concept before examining its potential\nrole in expert (scientific) judgments. As predicted, evidence of\nFixity was enough for na\u00efve subjects to agree that a trait is\ninnate, even if the trait lacks Typicality and Function. Evidence of\nTypicality also independently drove innateness judgments, as did\nFunctionality (though to a lesser degree). The authors take these\nresults to provide a fine-grained analysis of the vernacular concept\nof innateness, revealing just how easily people are prompted to\nclassify a given trait as \u201cinnate.\u201d In a later study,\nLinquist et al. (2011) expanded the survey to test whether Fixity,\nTypicality, and Function also influence naive subjects\u2019\njudgments about whether a trait is \u201cin the DNA.\u201d They\nfound that the two phrases (\u201cinnate\u201d and \u201cin the\nDNA\u201d) draw upon the same underlying folk concept. Linquist et\nal. (2011) also cite examples where researchers in psychology and\nbiology employ the folk concept in drawing unjustified inferences\namong i-properties. It is important to note that although these x-phi\nexperiments are quite limited, their findings are confirmed by a much\nlarger body of experimental work in social psychology on the\n\u2018genetic essentialist framework\u2019 in folk cognition\n(Dar-Nimrod and Heine 2006; 2011; Cheung, et al. 2014). For a side by\nside-comparison of the two models see Stotz and Griffiths (2018).\n\nLinquist and collaborators (2011) predicted that scientists would\ncontinue rely on the vernacular concept of innateness when reasoning\nin a professional context. This prediction was confirmed by Knobe and\nSamuels (2013) who compared na\u00efve subjects\u2019 responses to\nthe same birdsong questionnaire that was developed by Griffiths et al.\n(2009). As the attractor hypothesis predicts, they found that\nscientific training had no effect on a person\u2019s judgments about\ninnateness. Scientists were just as likely as lay people to classify a\ntrait as innate it if exhibits one of Typicality, Fixity or Function.\nThis result went against Knobe and Samuels (2013) own expectations\nthat professional scientists would exhibit a different response\npattern from laypersons. A subsequent analysis of Knobe and\nSamuels\u2019 (2013) data by Machery et al. (2019) took a\nfiner-grained look at how different categories of scientist responded\nto questions about innateness. They found no significant difference\namong psychologists, linguists, and biologists in their responses to\nthe birdsong questionnaire. This finding supports the attractor\nhypothesis and goes against the rival expectation that the concept of\ninnateness functions differently in psychology or linguistics than it\ndoes in biology. Interestingly, however, Knobe and Samuels (2013) also\nasked researchers how \u201cimportant\u201d the concept of\ninnateness is in their discipline. In this case, there was a\nsignificant difference among disciplines, with biologists ranking it\nless important than psychologist or linguists.\n\nOne must be cautious before reading too much significance into these\nresults since the sample size of scientists was fairly small (Machery\net al. 2019), the questionnaire offered only a limited glimpse into\nthe folk concept of innateness (Samuels 2016), and the questions\npresented (on birdsong) might have been more familiar to certain\ndisciplines (e.g. to biologists) than they were to others. This topic\nis ripe for future research. That said, a few additional results\nreported by Knobe and Samuels (2013) are worth mentioning.\n\nIn one of their experiments the authors manipulated the way in which\nbirdsong was described. In one condition, birds were described as\n\u201clearning\u201d their song. In another condition, the same\nacquisition process was described in neurological terms: birds were\ndescribed not as learning their songs, but rather as acquiring songs\nthrough specific neurological interactions with the environment.\nRecall that primitivism (Section 2.3) predicts that a trait described\nas \u201cunlearned\u201d should be less likely to be seen as innate\nthan one which is described as the result of a sub-personal,\nneurological process. The fact that subjects responded no differently\nto the \u201clearned\u201d versus \u201cneurological\u201d\nversions of the questionnaire (regardless of whether they were\nscientists or lay persons) contradicts this prediction of primitivism.\nIt is also interesting to note that Knobe and Samuels (2013) found an\neffect of moral \u201cvalence\u201d on innateness judgments. If a\nbehavior was morally unacceptable, subjects were less likely to judge\nit as innate than if it was morally good. This result ties in with a\nbroader literature on the influence of moral valence on all manner of\nfolk judgments (Knobe and Mendlow 2004; Cushman, et al. 2008; Petit\nand Knobe 2009). Finally, Knobe and Samuels (2013) included another\nversion of the birdsong questionnaire in which subjects were told how\ndifferent vignettes varied from one another, while also prompting\nsubjects to justify their responses. This was interpreted by the\nauthors as a \u201creflective\u201d condition, with the aim of\nprompting subjects to answer more systematically. Knobe and Samuels\n(2013) report that subjects responded more systematically under the\n\u201creflective\u201d condition than they did under the\nunreflective one, suggesting that even na\u00efve subjects will be\nless likely to equivocate in their judgments if they are prompted to\ndo so (see Linquist 2018 for a discussion of this result). All of the\nexperiments reported in this section are suggestive and offer an\ninteresting example of how empirical methods can be used to analyze\nboth folk and scientific concepts. Hopefully other researchers will be\ninspired to carry this work forward.\n",
