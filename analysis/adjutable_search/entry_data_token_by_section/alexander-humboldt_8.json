    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Nature || Ecology\n4.1 Ecology\n\nAlthough it was Ernst Haeckel who coined the term \u201cecology\n[Oecologie]\u201d some seven years after Humboldt\u2019s\ndeath, it was Humboldt\u2019s way of thinking and his understanding\nof the natural world that made Haeckel\u2019s coinage of the term\npossible. In fact, some scholars (Pausas & Bond 2019) have argued\nthat Haeckel had Humboldt in mind when he wrote that \n\n by ecology, we understand the whole science of the relationships\nbetween organisms and their surrounding external world, which we could\ncount as their \u201cconditions of existence\u201d in a wider sense.\n(Haeckel 1866 (Volume 2), 286, translation by author) \n\n\nThus, while Haeckel gave us the term ecology, it was Humboldt\nwho elaborated the idea of nature as a \u201chousehold (oikos)\u201d\nin which living beings mutually influence and support one another\n(Kosmos 1: 33 n. 27; CO 1: 69n).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s first concrete ecological observations have been\ntraced back to his research at Lake Valencia (Lake Tacarigua) in\npresent-day Venezuela. Humboldt and Bonpland arrived in Lake Valencia\nin March 1800. In contrast to their expectations, they encountered a\nregion suffering from drought. Through conversations with Indigenous\nlocals, Creole farmers and his own investigations, Humboldt came to a\nsurprising conclusion: the felling of trees, and the replacement of\nforests by farms, had fundamentally transformed the climate and soil.\nWhat was once a verdant region, with regular rain, had become a\ndesert. The trees, Humboldt realized, were crucial to maintaining the\nintegrity of the soil and bringing the rain. While a number of\nthinkers before Humboldt\u2014including Buffon, Kant and\nHerder\u2014had acknowledged the influence of the environment on\nliving beings, none had realized that the influence was mutual. Living\nbeings transform their environment just as they are transformed by it.\nThe trees determine the soil and the seasons, as much as they are\ndetermined by them. Accordingly, the felling of the trees\nfundamentally altered both. This is how Humboldt put it: \n\n\nWhen forests are destroyed \u2026 as they are everywhere in America\nby the European colonists, the springs \u2026 dry up, or become less\nabundant. The beds of the rivers, remaining dry during a part of the\nyear, become torrents whenever heavy rain falls on the heights. With\nthe disappearance of sward and moss from the sides of the mountains,\nthe waters falling in rain are no longer impeded in their course: and,\nduring heavy showers, instead of slowly augmenting the level of the\nrivers by progressive filtrations, they furrow the sides of the hills,\nbear down the loosened soil, and form those sudden inundations that\ndevastate the country. And so it results that the destruction of the\nforests, the want of permanent springs, and the existence of torrents\nare three phenomena closely connected to one another. (Voyage\n2: 71; PN 4: 143\u20134; translation altered)\n\n\nHumboldt\u2019s statement, which had a profound impact on\nenvironmental policy across the world (Grove 1990; Sachs 2004), points\nto two fundamental (but at that point hardly recognized) facts: the\ninfluence of trees (forests) on the environment and the influence of\nhuman beings on the environment. The implication is that environments\nare not stable backdrops of animal and human activity, but dynamic\nentities, themselves the outcome of ongoing activity, transformation,\nand collaboration.\n",
