    "main_text": "Natural Theology || Proof of the existence of God\n2.2 Proof of the existence of God\n\nScotus\u2019s argument for the existence of God is rightly regarded\nas one of the most outstanding contributions ever made to natural\ntheology. The argument is enormously complex, with several\nsub-arguments for almost every important conclusion, and I can only\nsketch it here. (Different versions of the proof are given at\nLectura 1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 38\u2013135; Ordinatio\n1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 39\u2013190; Reportatio 1, d. 2, q. 1;\nand De primo principio.)\n\nScotus begins by arguing that there is a first agent (a being that is\nfirst in efficient causality). Consider first the distinction between\nessentially ordered causes and accidentally ordered causes. In an\naccidentally ordered series, the fact that a given member of that\nseries is itself caused is accidental to that member\u2019s own\ncausal activity. For example, Grandpa A generates a son, Dad B, who in\nturn generates a son of his own, Grandson C. B\u2019s generating C in\nno way depends on A\u2014A could be long dead by the time B starts\nhaving children. The fact that B was caused by A is irrelevant to\nB\u2019s own causal activity. That\u2019s how an accidentally\nordered series of causes works.\n\nIn an essentially ordered series, by contrast, the causal activity of\nlater members of the series depends essentially on the causal activity\nof earlier members. For example, my shoulders move my arms, which in\nturn move my golf club. My arms are capable of moving the golf club\nonly because they are being moved by my shoulders.\n\nWith that distinction in mind, we can examine Scotus\u2019s argument\nfor the existence of a first efficient cause:\n\n\n\n(1)\nNo effect can produce itself. \n\n(2)\nNo effect can be produced by just nothing at all. \n\n(3)\nA circle of causes is impossible. \n\n(4)\nTherefore, an effect must be produced by something else. (from\n1, 2, and 3) \n\n(5)\nThere is no infinite regress in an essentially ordered series of\ncauses.  \n\n\n\n\n(5a)\nIt is not necessarily the case that a being possessing a causal\npower C possesses C in an imperfect way. \n\n(5b)\nTherefore, it is possible that C is possessed without\nimperfection by some item. \n\n(5c)\nIf it is not possible for any item to possess C without\ndependence on some prior item, then it is not possible that there is\nany item that possesses C without imperfection (since dependence is a\nkind of imperfection). \n\n(5d)\nTherefore, it is possible that some item possesses C without\ndependence on some prior item. (from 5b and 5c by modus tollens)\n\n\n(5e)\nAny item possessing C without dependence on some prior item is a\nfirst agent (i.e., an agent that is not subsequent to any prior causes\nin an essentially ordered series). \n\n(5f)\nTherefore, it is possible that something is a first agent. (from\n5d and 5e) \n\n(5g)\nIf it is possible that something is a first agent, something is\na first agent. (For, by definition, if there were no first agent,\nthere would be no cause that could bring it about, so it would not in\nfact be possible for there to be a first agent.) \n\n(5h)\nTherefore, something is a first agent (i.e., an agent that is\nnot subsequent to any prior causes in an essentially ordered\nseries\u2014Scotus still has to prove that there is an agent that is\nnot subsequent to any prior causes in an accidentally ordered series\neither. That\u2019s what he does in step (6) below). (from 5f and\n5g)  \n\n\n\n\n(6)\nIt is not possible for there to be an accidentally ordered\nseries of causes unless there is an essentially ordered series.\n \n\n\n\n\n(6a)\nIn an accidentally ordered series, each member of the series\n(except the first, if there is a first) comes into existence as a\nresult of the causal activity of a prior member of the series.\n\n\n(6b)\nThat causal activity is exercised in virtue of a certain\nform. \n\n(6c)\nTherefore, each member of the series depends on that form for\nits causal activity. \n\n(6d)\nThe form is not itself a member of the series. \n\n(6e)\nTherefore, the accidentally ordered series is essentially\ndependent on a higher-order cause.  \n\n\n\n\n(7)\nTherefore, there is a first agent. (from 4, 5, and 6) \n\n\n\nScotus then goes on to argue that there is an ultimate goal of\nactivity (a being that is first in final causality), and a maximally\nexcellent being (a being that is first in what Scotus calls\n\u201cpre-eminence\u201d).\n\nThus he has proved what he calls the \u201ctriple primacy\u201d:\nthere is a being that is first in efficient causality, in final\ncausality, and in pre-eminence. Scotus next proves that the three\nprimacies are coextensive: that is, any being that is first in one of\nthese three ways will also be first in the other two ways. Scotus then\nargues that a being enjoying the triple primacy is endowed with\nintellect and will, and that any such being is infinite. Finally, he\nargues that there can be only one such being.\n",
