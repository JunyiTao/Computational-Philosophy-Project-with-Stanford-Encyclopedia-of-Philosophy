    "main_text": "Objectivity as a Feature of Scientific Communities and Their Practices || Reproducibility and the Meta-Analytic Perspective\n5.1 Reproducibility and the Meta-Analytic Perspective\n\nThe collectivist perspective is especially useful when an entire\ndiscipline enters a stage of crisis: its members become convinced that\na significant proportion of findings are not trustworthy. A\ncontemporary example of such a situation is the replication\ncrisis, which was briefly mentioned in the previous section\nand concerns the reproducibility of scientific knowledge\nclaims in a variety of different fields (most prominently: psychology,\nbiology, medicine). Large-scale replication projects have noticed that\nmany findings which we considered as an integral part of scientific\nknowledge failed to replicate in settings that were designed to mimic\nthe original experiment as closely as possible (e.g., Open Science\nCollaboration 2015). Successful attempts at replicating an\nexperimental result have long been argued to provide evidence of\nfreedom from particular kinds of artefacts and thus the\ntrustworthiness of the result. Compare the\n entry on experiment in physics.\n Likewise, failure to replicate indicates that either the original\nfinding, the result of the replication attempt, or both, are\nbiased\u2014though see John Norton\u2019s (ms., ch. 3\u2014see\nOther Internet Resources) arguments that the evidential value of\n(failed) replications crucially depends on researchers\u2019 material\nbackground assumptions.\n\nWhen replication failures in a discipline are particularly\nsignificant, one may conclude that the published literature lacks\nobjectivity\u2014at a minimum the discipline fails to inspire trust\nthat its findings are more than artefacts of the researchers\u2019\nefforts. Conversely, when observed effects can be replicated in\nfollow-up experiments, a kind of objectivity is reached that goes\nbeyond the ideas of freedom from personal bias, mechanical\nobjectivity, and subject-independent measurement, discussed in\n section 4.1.\n\nFreese and Peterson (2018) call this idea statistical\nobjectivity. It grounds in the view that even the most\nscrupulous and diligent researchers cannot achieve full objectivity\nall by themselves. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d instead applies\nto a collection or population of studies, with\nmeta-analysis (a formal method for aggregating the\nresults from ranges of studies) as the \u201capex of\nobjectivity\u201d (Freese and Peterson 2018, 304; see also Stegenga\n2011, 2018). In particular, aggregating studies from different\nresearchers may provide evidence of systematic bias and questionable\nresearch practices (QRP) in the published literature. This diagnostic\nfunction of meta-analysis for detecting violations of objectivity is\nenhanced by statistical techniques such as the funnel plot and the\n\\(p\\)-curve (Simonsohn et al. 2014).\n\nApart from this epistemic dimension, research on statistical\nobjectivity also has an activist dimension: methodologists urge\nresearchers to make publicly available essential parts of their\nresearch before the data analysis starts, and to make their methods\nand data sources more transparent. For example, it is conjectured that\nthe replicability (and thus objectivity) of science will increase by\nmaking all data available online, by preregistering experiments, and\nby using the registered reports model for journal articles (i.e., the\njournal decides on publication before data collection on the basis of\nthe significance of the proposed research as well as the experimental\ndesign). The idea is that transparency about the data set and the\nexperimental design will make it easier to stage a replication of an\nexperiment and to assess its methodological quality. Moreover,\npublicly committing to a data analysis plan beforehand will lower the\nrate of QRPs and of attempts to accommodate data to\nhypotheses rather than making proper predictions.\n\nAll in all, statistical objectivity moves the discussion of\nobjectivity to the level of population of studies. There, it takes up\nand modifies several conceptions of objectivity that we have seen\nbefore: most prominently, freedom of subjective bias, which is\nreplaced with collective bias and pernicious conventions, and the\nsubject-independent measurement of a physical quantity, which is\nreplaced by reproducibility of effects.\n",
