    "main_text": "Perceptual theories || The appearance/reality problem\n3.2 The appearance/reality problem\n\nThe main source of resistance to a perceptual view of pain comes from\nthe common-sense conception of pain according to which pains are\nsensations with essential privacy, subjectivity, self-intimation, and\nincorrigibility. These apparently essential features of pains pose\ndifficulties for any perceptual theory. Indeed, they can be used in\nadvancing anti-perceptualist arguments whose general form can be put\nin the following way. Genuine perception always involves the\npossibility of misperceiving the perceptual object that is not\nessentially private and subjective. In other words, there is always an\nappearance/reality distinction applicable to the objects of genuine\nperception which gives rise to the possibility that the perceptual\nappearance of this object misleads us about what the object is like in\nreality. The main reason for this is that these objects have a reality\nbeyond their appearances. They are thus public objects and capable of\nexisting on their own without anyone\u2019s perception of them. But\nfeeling pain has none of these features. Therefore, it cannot be\ngenuine perception.\n\nSo, how do the perceptual theorists handle this objection, which lies\nbehind the intuitive resistance to treating pain as a form of\nperception? Given the core commitment of perceptual views (namely,\nthat feeling pain involves perceiving something extramental), one\nmight think that perceptual theorists identify pain with tissue\ndamage. Indeed, if one takes this view, the above objection seems\nalmost decisive against it. But relatively few defenders actually take\nthis route \u2014 among the most notable are Newton (1989), Stephens\nand Graham (1987), and Hill (2004, 2006). Most others, including\nArmstrong and Pitcher, bowed to common-sense understanding of pain and\nidentified pains with pain experiences or sensations, understood in a\ndirect realist fashion. If pains are identified with experiences, not\nwith their causes (i.e., tissue damage), then the above objection\nseems to disappear (but see below).\n\nIt is primarily for this reason that most perceptual theorists\nidentify feeling pain with having an experience in the first place\n\u2014 just as the pain scientists and clinicians do (see IASP\ndefinition above) following the second thread in our ordinary\nconception of pain. But this is the experience mediating or involved\nin the perception of tissue damage. In other words, they\ngrant that the (dominant) concept of pain is the concept of a\nsubjective experience, but they insist that this experience is\nessentially perceptual: it constitutes our perception of tissue\ndamage. Compare the situation with seeing. In seeing a red apple in\ngood light, I am having a visual experience which is perceptual: it\nconstitutes my seeing the red apple. The difference lies not in the\nflow of information, but in the locus of our spontaneous interest and\nconceptual identification directly induced by the perceptual\nexperience. According to most perceptual theorists, we apply the\nconcept of pain, PAIN, primarily to the perceptual experience we are\nhaving, not to the object of this experience, i.e., tissue damage\n(even though, as discussed above, common sense also uses confusingly\nthe same word \u2018pain\u2019 to indicate where the tissue damage\nmight be occurring by applying it to a bodily location \u2014 more on\nthis\n shortly).[10\n In other words, \u2018pain\u2019 names a subjective experience. In\nvision, however, the locus of conceptual identification is different:\nnormally it is the object of our visual experience we are interested\nin, say, a red apple seen in good light and identified as such. Thus,\nwe both perceptually and conceptually focus on it and its visible\nproperties such as its redness, roundness, etc., by applying our\nconcepts, RED, ROUND, APPLE, to it on the basis of our visual\nexperience. Of course, we are sometimes interested in and can focus\nand report on our visual experiences too, but this happens usually\nwhen we are not sure about what we are seeing.\n\nThere is thus an asymmetry in our spontaneous reaction to incoming\nstimuli in seeing and having pain; that is, our spontaneous interest\nand focus directly resulting from the perceptual experiences is\ndifferent in each case. We can represent this asymmetry with a\nschematic (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: There is asymmetry in concept application\neven when it is assumed that the structure of information flow may be\nsymmetrical in the contrast cases.\n\n\nThus the incorrigibility mentioned before reduces to one\u2019s\nincorrigibility about one\u2019s occurrent experiences. To the extent\nto which we are incorrigible in discriminating and conceptually\nidentifying our own experiences, to that extent we cannot be wrong\nabout our own pains. Hence the locus of concept application is the\npain experiences, even though it might seem to us as if we were\napplying the concept of pain to bodily locations (see below). It\nfollows that hallucinations or illusions are possible, in one sense,\nnot about feeling/experiencing pain, but about whether these\nexperiences\u2019 correctly represent some tissue damage, that is,\nthe object of perception in feeling pain.\n\nThe privacy and subjectivity of pains are explained similarly. If\npains are experiences, they cannot exist without being the state of\nsomeone\u2019s mind. In other words, they exist insofar as one has\nthem: they are mental states or processes, hence essentially\nmind-dependent. The privacy of pains again reduces to the privacy of\nexperiences. There may be philosophical problems about how privacy,\nsubjectivity and incorrigibility are possible in a completely physical\nworld, but if there are such problems, they are general problems about\nhaving perceptual experience of any kind, not necessarily pertaining\nto pains and other intransitive bodily sensations.\n",
