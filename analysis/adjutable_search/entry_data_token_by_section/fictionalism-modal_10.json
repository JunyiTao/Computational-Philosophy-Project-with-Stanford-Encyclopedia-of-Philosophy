    "main_text": "Other Concerns || Artificiality\n4.1 Artificiality\n\nFictions are human products: they have authors, and those authors have\na good deal of control over what is true according to them (though\nexactly how much control is controversial). Alternatively, if it is\nthought that fictions are timeless Platonic abstract entities (sets of\npropositions, perhaps), we should say that which fictions we consider\nand express is a matter of human activity: and the\n\u2018authors\u2019 of those eternal Platonic fictions actually\nexpressed have a good deal of control over which of a variety of such\nfictions they express. However, \u201ctheoretical fictions\u201d\nintroduced as an alternative to realist theories, and which are\nsupposed to play a serious role in inquiry, do not seem to be able to\nbe as arbitrary. Not any old story told about possible worlds will\nserve as the modal fiction, at least if it is to provide the heuristic\nand other advantages of talk about possible worlds. The suspicion is\nthat in some respects talk of possible worlds cannot be like paradigm\nfiction, since the \u2018choice\u2019 of which story about possible\nworlds should count as the modal fiction is not as up to us as what to\nsay about Sherlock Holmes was up to Conan\n Doyle.[6]\n\n\nModal fictionalists can certainly respond to the more general worry\nthat fictionalism makes it too arbitrary which particular story about\npossible worlds ought to be employed. After all, the purposes of the\nfiction constrain what sorts of fiction are suitable, just as not any\nold story about a gas will serve to provide an \u201cideal gas\u201d\nwhich has a behaviour approximated by real gases. Some story must be\ntold about what sorts of constraints are appropriate, and why: and\nthis can be difficult in its own right (see the \u201cwhich fiction\nshould be employed\u201d section, below). Even if there are\nsubstantial constraints on what story will be adequate, and these\nconstraints are not due merely to facts about us or our choices, there\nmay still be some scope for the story to be artificial to a small\ndegree, for some points of detail may be left underdetermined by the\nconstraints. This may also be considered a problem, but it is unlikely\nto be fatal.\n\nThere is a more specific worry that remains even if a suitable account\nof what constraints there are on the modal fiction can be given. This\nis that it is too contingent a matter whether there is a modal fiction\nat all. After all, if there had never been any sentient creatures, no\nstories would ever have been told, and even if the modal fiction is\nconstrued as a Platonic entity (a collection of propositions,\nperhaps), it may never have been a fiction if it was never expressed\nby story-tellers. (Of course if nothing hangs on whether or not it is\na fiction, then this will not worry the Platonist modal fictionalist).\nThis worry, again, is particularly pressing if modal truth is to\ndepend on the contents of the fiction, since it does not seem that\nwhether or not blue swans are possible, for example, depends on\nwhether or not anyone ever told stories. There are responses to this\nworry, and responses to these responses: see Nolan 1997a, Kim 2005 or\nDombrovszki 2017.\n\nSauchelli 2013 is a recent contribution to this debate that points out\nanother aspect of the problem about artificiality, especially for a\nfictionalist who intends an analysis of modal claims in terms of a\nfiction of possible worlds. Many people at different times and in\ndifferent places have made modal claims: Sauchelli mentions the\nexample of Caesar considering whether he could cross the Rubicon. Most\npeople have little or no contact with fictions of possible worlds, or\ntheories of possible worlds intended to be factual but useable as\nfictions. Those people lack access to the fictions that are\nsupposed to underpin the truth of their modal claims. Sauchelli claims\nthis makes for both an implausible modal epistemology for figures like\nCaesar and an implausible account of how people like Caesar can even\nunderstand modal claims. \n\nWoodward 2011 uses \u201cthe artificiality objection\u201d to refer\nto both the problem discussed in this section and the problem\ndiscussed in section 4.3. That paper contains a response to\nthis artificiality objection on pp. 537\u2013548.\n",
