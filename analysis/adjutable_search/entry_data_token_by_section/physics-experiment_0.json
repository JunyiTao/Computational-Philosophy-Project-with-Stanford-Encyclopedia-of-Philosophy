    "main_text": "Introduction: Epistemology of Experiment\n1. Introduction: Epistemology of Experiment\n\nEpistemology of experiment is a branch of philosophy of science\nfocusing on the diverse roles that experiment plays in science, its\nvarious connections to theory, to the understanding and functions of\nexperimental apparatus, and to the structure and culture of the\nscientific community in the laboratory setting. The epistemological\nanalysis of experiments ranges from highly abstract philosophical\narguments with only indirect connection to actual practice, to\nanalysis immersed in reflective case studies. For a long time\nexperiments in physics have been the leading edge of experimental\nscience, pioneering experimental techniques, methods and innovative\nsettings. This is why much of epistemology of experiment has focused\non physics.\n\nThe 17th century witnessed the first philosophical reflections on the\nnature of experimentation. This should not be surprising given that\nexperiment was emerging as a central scientific tool at the time. The\naim of these reflections was to uncover why nature reveals its hidden\naspects to us when we force experimental methods upon it.\n\nSome natural philosophers believed that scientific knowledge was\nlittle more than the proper application of observational and\nexperimental techniques on natural phenomena. Francis Bacon went so\nfar as to claim that it was possible to perform what he called a\ncrucial experiment (experimentum crucis), an ideal experiment of sorts\nthat can determine alone which of two rival hypotheses is correct. And\neven some of the giants of modern science such as Newton subscribed to\nthe view that scientific theories are directly induced from\nexperimental results and observations without the help of untested\nhypotheses. It is little wonder, then, that many natural philosophers\nthought that experimental techniques and their proper application\nshould be a primary object of philosophical study of science.\n\nYet not everybody agreed. Hobbes, for instance pointed out that human\nreason preceded experimental techniques and their application. He\nthought that human reasoning reveals to us the natural law, and\ncriticized Boyle\u2019s optimism regarding experimental\nmethod\u2019s ability to reveal it (Shapin and Schaffer 1984).\nDoesn\u2019t human reason guide experimenter\u2019s actions, in the\nway it leads us to choose data and samples, and the way it allows us\nto interpret them, after all? If so, we should focus on the\nphilosophical study of reason and theoretical scientific reasoning\nrather than on the study of experimental techniques and their\napplications.\n\nThis vigorous early debate in many ways anticipated the main points of\ndisagreement in debates to come. Yet the philosophical interest in\nexperimentation almost completely lost its steam at the end of the\n19th century and did not recover until fairly late in the 20th\ncentury.\n\nDuring that period philosophers turned much of their attention to the\nstudy of the logical structure of scientific theories and its\nconnection to evidence. The tenets of logical positivism influenced\nthis area of investigation \u2014 as well as philosophy more\ngenerally \u2014 at the time. One of these tenets stated that\nobservational and theoretical propositions in science are separable.\nMy readings of the gradation on the scale of a mercury thermometer can\nbe separated from rather complicated theoretical statements concerning\nheat transfer and the theoretical concept of temperature.\n\nIn fact, not only can one separate theory and observation, but the\nformer is considered justified only in light of its correspondence\nwith the latter. The theory of heat transfer is confirmed by\npropositions originating in the kind of readings I perform on my\nmercury thermometer. Thus, observational propositions are simply a\nresult of an experiment or a set of observations a scientist performs\nin order to confirm or refute a theory.\n\nThomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend vigorously criticized this view. They\nargued that observations and experimental results are already part of\na theoretical framework and thus cannot confirm a theory\nindependently. Nor there is a theory-neutral language for capturing\nobservations. Even a simple reading of a mercury thermometer\ninevitably depends on a theoretically-charged concept of temperature.\nIn short, the evidence is always theory-laden.\n\nYet neither the proponents of logical positivism nor their critics\never attempted to explain the nature of experimentation that produces\nall-important observational statements. And the reason for this was\nvery simple: they didn\u2019t think that there was anything\ninteresting to explain. Their views on the relationship between theory\nand evidence were diametrically opposed, but they all found only the\nfinal product of experimentation, namely observational statements,\nphilosophically interesting. As a result, the experimental process\nitself was set aside in their philosophical study of science. This has\ngradually changed only with the advent of New Experimentalism, with\nIan Hacking\u2019s work at its forefront.\n",
