    "main_text": "\n\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following new entry by Simon Tr\u00e9panier replaces the\n former entry\non this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\nTitus Lucretius Carus (mid-90s to mid-50s BCE) was the author of a\nLatin, six-book didactic poem on Epicurean physics, the De rerum\nnatura, henceforth DRN, usually translated The\nnature of things or On the nature of the universe.\nLargely by accident, the DRN is our fullest source for\nEpicurean, atomist physics. Lucretius\u2019 rendering of technical\nGreek prose into Latin verse, combined with the encyclopedic scope of\nthe work, was a pioneering accomplishment in Latin literature, a\ncontender for the most ambitious poem ever written. The DRN\nis complete but probably lacking its final revision. Allowing for some\nabridgments and simplifications, Lucretius reproduces Epicurean\ndoctrine faithfully. He provides us with our most detailed account of\nthe foundations of Epicurean atomism, and he is our sole Epicurean\nsource for the doctrine of the atomic \u2018swerve.\u2019 In the\nmore poetic openings of the individual books, he expresses his\ndevotion to Epicurus and his confidence in Epicureanism as the path to\nhappiness. The DRN is a nearly unique survival from antiquity\nof the anti-teleological and anti-providential materialist outlook.\nAmong its philosophical highlights are: the scientific image of atoms\nas motes of dust in a sunbeam, and the denial of most phenomenal\nproperties, including color, to the atoms themselves, both in book 2;\nthe treatment of the fear of death in book 3; the criticism of\nteleological explanations of nature, from cosmic design down to body\nparts, in books 4 and 5; and, from book 5, the humanistic explanation\nof the origins of religion.\n",
