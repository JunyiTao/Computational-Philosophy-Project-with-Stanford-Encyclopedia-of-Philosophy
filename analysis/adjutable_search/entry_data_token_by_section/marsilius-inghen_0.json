    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nMarsilius of Inghen was born around 1340 in Nijmegen, a city in the\neastern part of the Low Countries\n (Netherlands).[1]\n In the older literature it is often said that he came from one of the\nvillages in the vicinity of Nijmegen (Inghen), but this view is\nmistaken. It was based on a confused reading of the Oratio\nFunebris held in 1396 by Nicholas Prowin at the funeral of\nMarsilius and published in 1499 at\n Mainz.[2]\n From 1362 on, Marsilius was master at the Faculty of Arts at the\nUniversity of Paris, where he was also rector (1367 and 1371), and a\nstudent of theology. As a teacher at Paris, Marsilius was much\nesteemed and his lectures drew large audiences. Among his students\nwere many compatriots, some of whom came from Nijmegen and surrounding\nvillages. In 1378, Marsilius found himself the University\u2019s\ndelegate at the court of Pope Urban VI in Tivoli. In 1379, he\ninstructed one of his colleagues, Hugh of Hervort, to look after his\ninterests in Paris. After 1379, Marsilius\u2019s name is no longer\nmentioned in the acts of the University of Paris. He probably turned\naway from Paris because of the imbroglio surrounding the Great Schism\nof 1378. Meanwhile, he kept in touch with his native city. In 1382 the\ntown council of Nijmegen treated him to a banquet. From 1386 on,\nMarsilius was master at the University of Heidelberg. There, as in\nParis, he held a number of administrative offices. He was one of the\nfounders of the University of Heidelberg, of which he was rector no\nfewer than nine times, from 1386\u20131392 and also in 1396. In\n1389\u20131390, as the University\u2019s nuncio together\nwith Conrad of Soltau, he was responsible for transferring the\nUniversity register to Rome (Boniface IX). At the beginning of the\n1390s, Marsilius again took up the study of theology. The masters who\ntaught theology were by then Conrad of Soltau (since 1387) and Matthew\nof Krakow (since 1394), both from the University of Prague. In\n1395/1396 Marsilius finished his lectures on the Sentences\nand so became the first theologian to obtain the doctorate at\nHeidelberg. He died a short time later, on August 20, 1396.\n\nMarsilius was a prolific writer. His work was the fruit of his\nteachings in Paris and Heidelberg. Many of his writings have been\npreserved in manuscripts or early printed editions, although recently\nsome have appeared in modern critical editions. His most important\nwritings\n include:[3]\n\nWorks on Logic and Epistemology\n\nExposition of the Old Logic\nVarious Questions on the Old and New Logic\nSummary [Abbreviationes] of the Old and New\nLogic\nTreatises on the Properties of Terms: On Supposition,\nAmpliation, Appellation, Restriction, Obligation, Insolubles, and\nConsequences.\n Works on Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics\n\nSummary [Abbreviationes] of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018Physics\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018On Generation and\nCorruption\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018De\nanima\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018Metaphysics\u2019\n Works on Ethics\n\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018Nicomachean\nEthics\u2019\n Works on Theology\n\nQuestions on the \u2018Sentences\u2019 of Peter\nLombard\n\n\n",
