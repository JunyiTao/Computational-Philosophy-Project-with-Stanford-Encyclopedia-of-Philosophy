Philosophy and Conditions\n\nAn ambition of twentieth-century philosophy was to analyse and refine\nthe definitions of significant terms\u2014and the concepts expressed\nby them\u2014in the hope of casting light on the tricky problems of,\nfor example, truth, morality, knowledge and existence that lay beyond\nthe reach of scientific resolution. Central to this goal was\nspecifying at least in part the conditions to be met for correct\napplication of terms, or under which certain phenomena could truly be\nsaid to be present. Even now, philosophy\u2019s unique contribution\nto interdisciplinary studies of consciousness, the evolution of\nintelligence, the meaning of altruism, the nature of moral obligation,\nthe scope of justice, the concept of pain, the theory of perception\nand so on still relies on its capacity to bring high degrees of\nconceptual exactness and rigour to discussions in these areas.\n\nIf memory is a capacity for tracking our own past experiences and\nwitnessings then a necessary condition for Penelope\nremembering giving a lecture is that it occurred in the past.\nContrariwise, that Penelope now remembers the lecture is\nsufficient for inferring that it was given in the past. In a\nwell-known attempt to use the terminology of necessary and sufficient\nconditions to illuminate what it is for one thing to be cause of\nanother thing, J. L. Mackie proposes that causes are at a minimum INUS\nconditions, that is, \u201cInsufficient but Necessary parts of a\ncondition which is itself Unnecessary but Sufficient\u201d for their\neffects (Mackie 1965). A schema like Mackie\u2019s became the\nfoundation for the \u201csufficient cause model\u201d of disease in\nepidemiology (see Rothman 1976) and continues to have influence on\nmedical thinking about disease causation, as well as on definitions of\ncausation in psychology and law (VanderWeele 2017).\n\nWhat, then, is a necessary (or a sufficient) condition? This article\ndescribes the difficulties in providing complete precision in\nanswering this question. Although the notion of sufficient condition\ncan be used in defining what a necessary condition is (and vice\nversa), there appears to be no straightforward way to give a\ncomprehensive and unambiguous account of the meaning of the term\n\u201cnecessary (or sufficient) condition\u201d itself. \n2. The Standard Theory: Truth-functions and Reciprocity\n\nThe front door is locked. In order to open it in a normal way and get\ninto the house, I must first use my key. A necessary condition of\nopening the door, without violence, then, is to use the key. So it\nseems true that\n\nIf I opened the door, I used the key.\n\n\nCan we use the truth-functional understanding of \u201cif\u201d to\npropose that the consequent of any conditional (in (i), the consequent\nis \u201cI used the key\u201d) specifies a necessary condition for\nthe truth of the antecedent (in (i), \u201cI opened the door\u201d)?\nMany logic and critical thinking texts use just such an approach, and\nfor convenience it can be called \u201cthe standard theory\u201d\n(see Blumberg 1976, pp. 133\u20134, Hintikka and Bachman 1991, p.\n328, Moore and Parker 2009, 310\u201311, and Southworth and Swoyer\n2020, ch. 3.2 for examples of this approach).\n\nThe standard theory makes use of the fact that in classical logic, the\ntruth-function \u201cp \u2283 q\u201d (\u201cIf\np, q\u201d) is false only when p is true\nand q is false. The relation between \u201cp\u201d\nand \u201cq\u201d in this case is sometimes referred to as\nmaterial implication (see the entry on\n the logic of conditionals).\n On this account of \u201cif p, q\u201d, if the\nconditional \u201cp \u2283 q\u201d is true, and\np holds, then q also holds; likewise if q\nis false, then p must also be false (if the conditional is\ntrue). The standard theory claims that when the conditional\n\u201cp \u2283 q\u201d is true the truth of the\nconsequent, \u201cq\u201d, is necessary for the\ntruth of the antecedent, \u201cp\u201d, and the truth of\nthe antecedent is in turn sufficient for the truth of the\nconsequent. This reciprocal relation between necessary and sufficient\nconditions matches the formal equivalence between a conditional\nformula and its contrapositive (\u201c~q \u2283\n~p\u201d is the contrapositive of \u201cp\n\u2283 q\u201d). Descending from talk of truth of statements\nto speaking about states of affairs, we can equally correctly say, on\nthe standard theory, that using the key was a necessary condition of\nopening the door.\n\nGiven the standard theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are\nconverses of each other: B\u2019s being a necessary\ncondition of A is equivalent to A\u2019s being a\nsufficient condition of B (and vice versa). So it seems that\nany truth-functional conditional sentence states both a sufficient and\na necessary condition as well. Suppose that if Nellie is an elephant,\nthen she has a trunk. Being an elephant is a sufficient condition of\nher having a trunk; having a trunk in turn is a necessary condition of\nNellie\u2019s being an elephant. Indeed, the claim about the\nnecessary condition appears to be another way of putting the claim\nabout the sufficient condition, just as the contrapositive of a\nformula is logically equivalent to the original formula.\n\nIt is also possible\u2014according the the standard theory\u2014to\nuse \u201conly if\u201d to identify a necessary condition: we can\nsay that Jonah was swallowed by a whale only if he was swallowed by a\nmammal, for if a creature is not a mammal, it is not a whale.\nEquivalent to (i) above, on this account, is the sentence \u201cI\nopened the door only if I used the key\u201d\u2014a perfectly\nnatural way of indicating that use of the key was necessary for\nopening the door.\n\nThis account of necessary and sufficient conditions is particularly\napposite in dealing with logical inferences. For example, from the\ntruth of a conjunction, it can be inferred that each component is true\n(if \u201cp and q\u201d is true, then\n\u201cp\u201d is true and \u201cq\u201d is\ntrue). Suppose, then, that it is true that it is both raining and\nsunny. This is a sufficient condition for \u201cit is raining\u201d\nto be true. That it is raining is\u2014contrariwise\u2014a necessary\ncondition for it being true that it is both raining and sunny. A\nsimilar account seems to work for conceptual and definitional\ncontexts. So if the concept of memory is analysed as the concept of a\nfaculty for tracking actual past events, the fact that an event is now\nin the past is a necessary condition of my presently recollecting it.\nIf water is chemically defined as a liquid constituted mainly of\nH2O, then if a glass contains water, it contains mainly\nH2O. That the glass contains mostly H2O is a\nnecessary condition of its containing water.\n\nDespite its initial appeal, objections to the standard theory have\nbeen made by theorists from both philosophy and linguistics. In\nsummary, the objections build on the idea that \u201cif\u201d in\nEnglish does not always express a uniform kind of condition. If\ndifferent kinds of conditions are expressed by the word\n\u201cif\u201d, the objectors argue, then it would be wise to\nuncover these before engaging in attempts to formalize and systematize\nthe concepts of necessary and sufficient. In trying\nto show that there is an ambiguity infecting\n\u201cif\u201d-sentences in English, critics have focused on two\ndoctrines they regard as mistaken: first, that there is a reciprocity\nbetween necessary and sufficient conditions, and, second, that\n\u201cif p, q\u201d and \u201cp only if\nq\u201d are equivalent.\n3. Problems for the Standard Theory\n\nGiven any two true sentences A and B, the\nconditional \u201cIf A, then B\u201d is true. For\nexample, provided it is true that the sun is made of gas and also true\nthat elephants have four legs, then the truth-functional conditional\n\u201cIf elephants have four legs, then the sun is made of gas\u201d\nis also true. However, the gaseous nature of the sun would not\nnormally be regarded as either a conceptually, or even a contingently,\nnecessary condition of the quadripedality of elephants. Indeed,\naccording to the standard theory, any truth will be a necessary\ncondition for the truth of every statement whatsoever, and any\nfalsehood will be a sufficient condition for the truth of any\nstatement we care to consider.\n\nThese odd results do not arise in some non-classical logics where it\nis required that premisses be relevant to the conclusions drawn from\nthem, and that the antecedents of true conditionals are likewise\nrelevant to the consequents. But even in those versions of relevance\nlogic which avoid some of these odd results, it is difficult to avoid\nall of the so-called \u201cparadoxes of implication\u201d(see the\nentry on\n the logic of conditionals\n and\n relevance logic).\n For example, a contradiction (a statement of the form\n\u201cp and not p\u201d) will be a sufficient\ncondition for the truth of any statement unless the semantics for the\nlogic in question allow the inclusion of inconsistent worlds. \n\nThese oddities might be dismissed as mere anomalies were it not for\nthe fact that writers have identified a number of other problems\nassociated with the ideas of reciprocity and equivalence mentioned at\nthe end of the previous section. According to the standard theory,\nthere is a kind of reciprocity between necessary and sufficient\nconditions, and \u201cif p, q\u201d sentences can\nalways be paraphrased by \u201cp only if q\u201d\nones. However, as writers in linguistics have observed, neither of\nthese claims matches either the most natural understanding of\nnecessary (or sufficient) conditions, or the behaviour of\n\u201cif\u201d (and \u201conly if\u201d) in English. Consider, for\nexample, the following case (drawn from McCawley 1993, p. 317):\n\nIf you touch me, I\u2019ll scream.\n\n\nWhile in the case of (i) above, using the key was necessary for\nopening the door, no parallel claim seems to work for (ii): in the\nnatural reading of this statement, my screaming is not a condition for\nyour touching me. James McCawley claims that the\n\u201cif\u201d-clause in a standard English statement gives the\ncondition\u2014whether epistemic, temporal or causal\u2014for the\ntruth of the \u201cthen\u201d-clause. The natural interpretation of\n(ii) is that my screaming depends on your touching me. To take my\nscreaming as a necessary condition for your touching me seems to get\nthe dependencies back to front. A similar concern arises if it is\nmaintained that (ii) entails that you will touch me only if I\nscream.\n\nA similar failure of reciprocity or mirroring arises in the case of\nthe door example ((i) above). While opening the door depended,\ntemporally and causally, on using the key first, it would be wrong to\nthink that using the key depended, either temporally or causally, on\nopening the door. So what kind of condition does the antecedent state?\nIt may be helpful to consider the following puzzling pair of\nconditional sentences (a modification of Sanford 1989,\n175\u20136):\n\nIf he learns to play, I\u2019ll buy Lambert a cello.\nLambert learns to play only if I buy him a cello.\n\n\nNotice that these two statements are not equivalent in meaning, even\nthough the standard theory treats \u201cif p,\nq\u201d as just another way of saying \u201cp only\nif q\u201d. While (iii) states a condition under which I buy\nLambert a cello (presumably he first learns by using a borrowed one,\nor maybe he hires one), (iv) states a (necessary) condition of Lambert\nlearning to play the instrument in the first place (there may be\nothers too). Understood this way, the statements taken together leave\npoor old Lambert with no prospect of ever getting the cello from me.\nBut if (iv) were just equivalent to (iii), combining the two\nstatements would not lead to an impasse like this.\n\nBut how else can we formulate (iii) in terms of \u201conly if\u201d?\nA natural English equivalent is surprisingly hard to formulate.\nPerhaps it would be something like:\n\nLambert has learned to play the cello only if I have bought him\none.\n\n\nwhere the auxiliary (\u201chas\u201d/\u201chave\u201d) has been\nintroduced to try to keep dependencies in order. Yet (v) is not quite\nright, for it can be read as implying that Lambert\u2019s success is\ndependent on my having first bought him a cello\u2014something that\nis certainly not implied in (iii). A still better (but not completely\nsatisfactory) version requires further adjustment of the auxiliary,\nsay:\n\nLambert will have learned to play the cello only if I have bought\nhim one.\n\n\nThis time, it is not so easy to read (vi) as implying that I bought\nLambert a cello before he learned to play. These changes in the\nauxiliary (sometimes described as changes in \u201ctense\u201d) have\nled some writers to argue that conditionals in English involve\nimplicit quantification across times (see, for example, von Fintel\n1998). \n\nAn alternative view is that different kinds of dependency are\nexpressed by use of the conditional construction: (iv) is not\nequivalent to (iii) because the consequent of (iii) provides what\nmight be called a reason for thinking that Lambert has\nlearned to play the cello. By contrast, the very same\ncondition\u2014that I buy Lambert a cello\u2014appears to fulfil a\ndifferent function in (iv) (namely that I first have to buy him a\ncello before he learns to play). In the following section, the\npossibility of distinguishing between different kinds of conditions is\ndiscussed. The existence of such distinctions would seem to provide\nsome evidence for a systematic ambiguity about the meaning of\n\u201cif\u201d and in the concepts of necessary (and\nsufficient) condition.\n\nThe possibility of ambiguity in these concepts raises a further\nproblem for the standard theory. According to it\u2014as Georg Henrik\nvon Wright points out (von Wright 1974, 7)\u2014the notions of\nnecessary condition and sufficient condition are themselves\ninterdefinable:\n\nA is a sufficient condition of B\n=df the absence of A is a necessary\ncondition of the absence of B\n\nB is a necessary condition of A\n=df the absence of B is a sufficient\ncondition of the absence of A\n\nAmbiguity would threaten this neat interdefinability. In the following\nsection, we will explore whether there is an issue of concern here.\nThe possibility of such ambiguity figures in work by Peter Downing on\nso-called \u201csubjunctive\u201d conditionals (Downing1959) and is\nexplored subsequently as a more general problem in Wilson (1979),\nGoldstein et al. (2005), ch. 6, and later writers. The general\nargument, in brief, is that in some contexts there is a lack of\nreciprocity between necessary and sufficient conditions understood in\na certain way, while in other situations the conditions do relate\nreciprocally to each other in the way required by the standard theory.\nIf ambiguity is present, then there is no general conclusion that can\nsafely be drawn about reciprocity, or lack of it, between necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Instead there will be a need to distinguish\nthe sense of condition that is being invoked in a particular context.\nWithout specification of meaning and context, it would also be wrong\nto make the general claim that sentences like \u201cif p,\nq\u201d are generally paraphrasable as \u201cp\nonly if q\u201d. The philosophical literature contains\nnumerous ways to make sense of the lack of reciprocity between the two\nkinds of conditions. Using a semi-formal argument, Carsten Held, for\nexample, has suggested a way of explaining why necessary and\nsufficient conditions are not converses by making appeal to a version\nof truthmaker theory (Held 2016 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\nIn what follows, the entry focuses on a rather different and possibly\nmore widely accepted approach: the attempt to make sense of the lack\nof reciprocity in terms of the difference between inferential,\nevidential and explanatory uses of conditionals.\n4. Inferences, Reasons for Thinking, and Reasons Why\n\nAre the following two statements equivalent? (Wertheimer 1968,\n363\u20134):\n\nThe occurrence of a sea battle tomorrow is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the truth, today, of \u201cThere will be a\nsea battle tomorrow.\u201d\nThe truth, today, of \u201cThere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\noccurrence of a sea battle tomorrow.\n\n\nDavid Sanford argues that while (vii) is sensible, (viii) \u201chas\nthings backward\u201d (Sanford 1989, 176\u20137). He writes:\n\u201cthe statement about the battle, if true, is true because of the\noccurrence of the battle. The battle does not occur because of the\ntruth of the statement\u201d (ibid.) What he may mean is\nthat the occurrence of the battle gives a reason why the\nstatement is true, but it is not conversely the case that the truth of\nthe statement provides any reason why the battle occurred. Of course,\npeople sometimes do undertake actions just to make true what they had\nformerly said; so there will be unusual cases where the truth of a\nstatement is a reason why an event occurred. But this seems an\nunlikely reading of the sea battle case.\n\nNow let S be the sentence \u201cThere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d. If S is true today, it is correct to infer\nthat a sea battle will occur tomorrow. That is, even though the truth\nof the sentence does not explain the occurrence of the battle, the\nfact that it is true licenses the inference to the occurrence of the\nevent. Ascending to the purely formal mode (see section 4 of the entry\non\n Rudolf Carnap),\n we can make the point by explicitly limiting inference relations to\nones that hold among sentences or other bearers of truth values. It is\nperfectly proper to infer from the truth of S today that some\nother sentence is true tomorrow, such as \u201cthere is a sea battle\ntoday\u201d. Since \u201cthere is a sea battle today\u201d is true\ntomorrow if and only if there is a sea battle tomorrow, then we can\ninfer from the fact that S is true today that it is true that\na sea battle will occur tomorrow.\n\nFrom this observation, it would appear that there is a gap between\nwhat is true of inferences, and what is true of \u201creason\nwhy\u201d relations. There is an inferential sense in which the truth\nof S is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the\noccurrence of the sea battle. However, there is an explanatory sense\nin which the occurrence of the sea battle is necessary and sufficient\nfor the truth of S, but not vice versa. It would\nappear that in cases like (vii) and (viii) the inferences run in both\ndirections, while explanatory reasons run only one way. Whether we\nread (vii) as equivalent to (viii) seems to depend on the sense in\nwhich the notions of necessary and sufficient conditions are being\ndeployed.\n\nIs it possible to generalize this finding? The door example ((i)\nabove) seems to be a case in point. The fact I used the key gives a\nreason why I was able to open the door without force. That I opened\nthe door without force gives a ground for inferring that I used the\nkey. Here is a further example from McCawley:\n\nIf Audrey wins the race, we will celebrate.\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s winning the race is a sufficient condition for us\nhaving a celebration, and her winning the race is the reason why we\nwill be celebrating. Our celebration, however, is not likely to be the\nreason why she wins the race. In what sense then is the celebration a\nnecessary condition of her winning the race? Again, there is a ground\nfor inferring: that we don\u2019t celebrate is a ground for inferring\nthat Audrey didn\u2019t win the race. English time reference appears\nsensitive to the asymmetry uncovered here, in the way noted in the\nprevious section. The natural way of writing the contrapositive of\n(ix) is not the literal \u201cIf we will not celebrate, then Audrey\ndoes not win the race\u201d, but rather something like:\n\nIf we don\u2019t celebrate, Audrey didn\u2019t win the\nrace.\n\n\nor\n\nIf we aren\u2019t celebrating, Audrey hasn\u2019t won the\nrace.\n\n\nor even\n\nIf we don\u2019t celebrate, Audrey can\u2019t have won the\nrace.\n\n\nGilberto Gomes (Gomes 2019) discusses in detail a range of cases in\nwhich sometimes elaborate paraphrasing of this, and other, kinds can\nbe used to preserve reciprocity between conditionals and their\ncontrapositives.\n\nIan Wilson (in Wilson 1979) proposes that there are five possible\nrelations symbolised by \u201cif, \u2026 then \u2026\u201d\nincluding the reason why reading. Subsequent authors have not\nadopted this proposal, preferring to focus mainly on three of these\nrelations, each of which bears on questions of necessity and\nsufficiency. First is the implication relation symbolised by the hook\noperator, \u201c\u2283\u201d or perhaps some relevant implication\noperator. Such an operator captures some inferential relations as\nalready noted. For example, we saw that from the truth of a\nconjunction, it can be inferred that each component is true (from\n\u201cp and q\u201d, we can infer that\n\u201cp\u201d is true and that \u201cq\u201d is\ntrue). Hook, or a relevant implication operator, seems to capture one\nof the relations encountered in the sea battle case, a relation which\ncan be thought of as holding paradigmatically between bearers of truth\nvalues, but can also be thought of in terms of states of affairs. For\nthis relation, we are able to maintain the standard theory\u2019s\nreciprocity thesis with the limitations already noted.\n\nTwo further relations, however, are often implicated in reflections on\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. To identify these, consider the\ndifferent things that can be meant by saying\n\nIf Solange was present, it was a good seminar.\n\n\nOne scenario for (xiii) is the situation where Solange is invariably a\nlively contributor to any seminar she attends. Moreover, the\ncontributions she makes are always insightful, hence guaranteeing an\ninteresting time for all who attend. In this case, Solange\u2019s\npresence at least in part explains or is a reason why the\nseminar was good. Note that some writers distinguish explanatory\nreasons of this sort from full-bodied explanations (Nebel 2018). A\ndifferent scenario depicts Solange as someone who has an almost\nunerring knack for spotting which seminars are going to be good, even\nthough she is not always active in the discussion. Her attendance at a\nseminar, according to this story, provides a reason for\nthinking\u2014or is evidence\u2014that the seminar is\ngood. We might say that according to the first story, the seminar is\ngood because Solange is at it. In the second case, Solange is at it\nbecause it is good. Examples of this kind were first introduced in\nWilson (1979) following on from the attack on the validity of\ncontraposition in Downing (1975). Notice that the hook (as understood\nin classical logic) does not capture the reason for thinking\nrelation, for it permits any true consequent to be inferred from any\nother statement whatever. Where the conditional is a reason for\nthinking relation, then the antecedent must provide some support\nfor the consequent\u2014hence has to provide some supporting evidence\nfor accepting the consequent. A formal exploration of one reason\nfor thinking relation is given in Vincenzo Crupi and Andrea\nIacona\u2019s study of the evidential conditional (Crupi and\nIacona 2020, and see the fully developed logic of the evidential\nconditional in Raidl, Iacona and Crupi 2021). These writers treat the\nreason for thinking or evidentiary relation as one in which\nthe antecedent provides a \u201creason for accepting\u201d the\nconsequent. See also Igor Douven on the \u201cevidential support\nthesis\u201d (Douven 2008, 2016). \n\nThe reason why and reason for thinking that\nconditions may help to shed light on the peculiarities encountered\nearlier. That I opened the door is a reason for thinking that I used\nthe key, not a reason why. In case (iii) above, that he learns to play\nthe instrument is the reason why I will buy Lambert a cello, and that\nI buy him a cello is (in the same case) a reason for thinking\nthat\u2014but not a reason why\u2014he has learned to play the\ninstrument. Our celebrating is a reason for thinking that Audrey has\nwon the race in case (ix), but is unlikely to be a reason why.\n\nAlthough there is sometimes a correlation between reasons why, on the\none hand, and evidentiary relations, on the other, few generalisations\nabout this can be safely made. If A is a reason why\nB has occurred (and so perhaps also is evidence that\nB has occurred), then the occurrence of B will\nsometimes be a reason for thinking\u2014but not a\nguarantee\u2014that A has occurred. If A is no more\nthan a reason for thinking that B has occurred, then\nB will sometimes be a reason why\u2014but not a guarantee\nthat\u2014A has occurred. Going back to example (i) above,\nmy opening the door (without violence) was a reason for thinking, that\nis to say evidence, that I had used the key. That I used the key,\nhowever, was not just a reason for thinking that I had opened the\ndoor, but one of the reasons why I was able to open the door. What is\nimportant is that the \u201cif\u201d clause of a conditional may do\nany of three things described in the present section. One of these is\nwell captured by classical truth-functional logic, namely (i)\nintroduce a sentence from which the consequent follows in the way\nmodelled by an operator such as hook. But there are two other jobs\nthat \u201cif\u201d may do as well, namely: (ii) state a reason why\nwhat is stated in the consequent is the case; (iii) state a reason for\nthinking that what is stated in the consequent is the case even when\nthis is not a reason why.\n\nIn general, if explanation is directional, it may not seem surprising\nthat when A explains B, it is not usually the case\nthat B, or its negation, is in turn an explanation of\nA (or its negation). Audrey\u2019s winning the race explains\nour celebration, but our failure to celebrate is not (normally) a\nplausible explanation of her failure to win. Solange\u2019s presence\nmay explain why the seminar was such a great success, but a boring\nseminar is not\u2014in any normal set of circumstances\u2014a reason\nwhy Solange is not at it. This result seems to undermine the usual\nunderstanding that if A is a sufficient condition of\nB, it will typically be the case that B is a\nnecessary condition for A, and the falsity of B a\nsufficient condition for the falsity of A.\n\nIn defence of contraposition, it might be argued that in the case of\ncausal claims there is at least a weak form of contraposition that is\nvalid. Gomes proposes (Gomes 2009) that where \u2018A\u2019\nis claimed to be a causally sufficient condition for\n\u2018B\u2019, or \u2018B\u2019 a causally\nnecessary condition of \u2018A\u2019, then some form of\nreciprocity between the two kinds of conditions holds, and so some\nversion of contraposition will be valid. Going back to example (ii),\nsuppose we read this as stating a causal condition\u2014that your\ntouching me would cause me to scream. Gomes suggests that\n\u2018A\u2019 denotes a sufficient cause of B,\nprovided that (1) \u2018A\u2019 specifies the occurrence of\nan event that would cause another event \u2018B\u2019, and\ndoes this by (2) stating a condition the truth of which is sufficient\nfor inferring the truth of \u2018B\u2019. In such a case,\nwe could further maintain that \u2018B\u2019, in turn,\ndenotes a necessary effect of \u2018A\u2019, meaning that\nthe truth of B provides a necessary condition for the truth\nof A (Gomes 2009, 377\u20139). It is notable that Crupi and\nIacona\u2019s evidential conditional also preserves contraposition,\nwhich they claim as a distinctive feature of of their analysis, based\non their understanding that \u201cprovides evidence for\u201d is\nanother way of saying \u201csupports\u201d (section 6 of Crupi and\nIacona 2020). For them, if Solange\u2019s presence provides evidence\nfor the seminar being good (see (xiii) above), then the\nseminar\u2019s not being good is evidence of Solange\u2019s absence.\nThey\u2014like Gomes (2019)\u2014thus reject Downing\u2019s (1975)\ngeneral scepticism about contraposition. Wilson, by contrast, argues\nthat the seminar not being good might also be a reason why Solange\ndoes not attend. But this, he claims, \u201csaves only the appearance\nof contraposition\u201d (Wilson 1979, 274\u20135).\n\nWhile it is possible to distinguish these different roles the\n\u201cif\u201d clause may play (there may be others too), it is not\nalways easy to isolate them in every case. The appeal to\n\u201creasons why\u201d and \u201creasons for thinking\u201d\nenables us to identify what seem to be ambiguities both in the word\n\u201cif\u201d and in the terminology of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. Unfortunately, the concept of what is explanatory\nitself may be too vague to be very helpful here, for we can explain a\nphenomenon by citing a reason for thinking it is the case, or by\nciting a reason why it is the case. A similar vagueness infests the\nword \u201cbecause\u201d, as we see below. Consider, for example,\ncases where mathematical, physical or other laws are involved (one\nlocus classicus for this issue is Sellars 1948). The truth of\n\u201cthat figure is a polygon\u201d is sufficient for inferring\n\u201cthe sum of that figure\u2019s exterior angles is 360\ndegrees\u201d. Likewise, from \u201cthe sum of the figure\u2019s\nexterior angles is not 360 degrees\u201d we can infer \u201cthe\nfigure is not a polygon\u201d. Such inferences are not trivial.\nRather they depend on geometrical definitions and mathematical\nprinciples, and so this is a case of mathematically necessary and\nsufficient conditions. But it appears quite plausible that\nmathematical results also give us at least a reason for thinking that\nbecause a figure is a polygon its exterior angles will sum to 360\ndegrees. We may even be able to think of contexts in which someone\nclaims that a figure\u2019s being a polygon is a reason why its\nexterior angles sum to 360 degrees. And it might not be unnatural for\nsomeone to remark that a certain figure is a polygon because its\nexterior angles sum to 360 degrees.\n\nA similar point holds for the theory of knowledge where it is\ngenerally held that if I know that p, then p is true\n(see the entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n The truth of p is a necessary condition of knowing that\np, according to such accounts. In saying this we do not rule\nout claims stronger than simply saying that the truth of p\nfollows from the fact that we know that p. That a belief is\ntrue\u2014for example\u2014may be (part of) a reason for thinking it\nconstitutes knowledge. Other cases involve inferences licensed by\nphysics, biology and the natural sciences\u2014inferences that will\ninvolve causal or nomic conditions. Again there is need for care in\ndetermining whether reason why or reason for\nthinking relations are being stated. The increase of mean kinetic\nenergy of its molecules does not just imply that the temperature of a\ngas is rising but also provides a reason why the temperature is\nincreasing. However, if temperature is just one way of measuring mean\nmolecular kinetic energy, then a change in temperature will be a\nreason for thinking that mean kinetic energy of molecules has changed,\nnot a reason why it has changed.\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the article, the specification of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions has traditionally been part of the\nphilosopher\u2019s business of analysis of terms, concepts and\nphenomena. Philosophical investigations of knowledge, truth,\ncausality, consciousness, memory, justice, altruism and a host of\nother matters do not aim at stating evidential or explanatory\nrelations, but rather at identifying and developing conceptual ones\n(see Jackson 1998 for a detailed account of conceptual analysis, and\nthe supplementary entry on\n conceptions of analysis in analytic philosophy\n for an overview). But even here, the temptation to look for\nreasons why or reasons for thinking that is not far\naway. While conceptual analysis, like dictionary definition, eschews\nevidential and explanatory conditions, evidential conditions seem to\nbe natural consequences of definition and analysis. That Nellie is an\nelephant may not be a (or the) reason why she is an animal, any more\nthan that a figure is a square is a reason why it has four sides. But\nsome evidential claims seem to make sense even in such contexts: being\nan elephant apparently gives a reason for thinking that Nellie is an\nanimal, and a certain figure may be said to have four sides because it\nis a square, in an evidential sense of \u201cbecause\u201d.\n\nTo specify the necessary conditions for the truth of the sentence\n\u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is to specify a number of\nconditions including \u201cthat figure has four sides\u201d,\n\u201cthat figure is on a plane\u201d, and \u201cthat figure is\nclosed\u201d. If any one of these latter conditions is false, then\nthe sentence \u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is also false.\nConversely, the truth of \u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is a\nsufficient condition for the truth of \u201cthat figure is\nclosed\u201d. The inferential relations in this case are\nmodelled\u2014even if inadequately\u2014by an operator such as\nhook.\n\nNow consider a previous example\u2014that of memory. That Penelope\nremembers something\u2014according to a standard account of\nmemory\u2014means (among other things) that the thing remembered was\nin the past, and that some previous episode involving Penelope plays\nan appropriate causal role in her present recall of the thing in\nquestion. It would be a mistake to infer from the causal role of some\npast episode in Penelope\u2019s current remembering, that the\ndefinition of memory itself involves conditions that are explanatory\nin the reason why sense. That Penelope now remembers some\nevent is not a reason why it is in the past. Nor is it a reason for\nthinking that it is in the past. Rather, philosophical treatments of\nmemory seek for conditions that are a priori constitutive of\nthe truth of such sentences as \u201cPenelope remembers doing\nX\u201d. The uncovering of such conditions simply provides\ninsight into whether, and how, \u201cremember\u201d is to be\ndefined. Reason why and reason for thinking that\nconditions seem not to play a role in this part of the\nphilosopher\u2019s enterprise.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that not all conditional sentences\nprimarily aim at giving either necessary or sufficient conditions. A\ncommon case involves what might be called jocular\nconditionals. A friend of Octavia\u2019s mistakenly refers to\n\u201cPlato\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason\u201d and\nOctavia says, \u201cIf Plato wrote the Critique of Pure\nReason, then I\u2019m Aristotle\u201d. Rather than specifying\nconditions, Octavia is engaging in a form of reductio\nargument. Since it is obvious that she is not Aristotle, her joke\ninvites the listener to infer (by contraposition) that Plato did not\nwrite the Critique of Pure Reason. Another case is the\nso-called concessive conditional, where the antecedent does\nnot appear to be a condition on the consequent of even an inferential\nkind. Suppose we plan on having picnic and hope it will be sunny. But\neven if rain comes, we will still go. In such a case it does\nnot seem plausible to maintain that the threat of rain provides any\ncondition at all on accepting the consequent. Such concessive\nconditionals do not admit of contraposition (Crupi and Iacona 2022,\nand compare Gomes 2020). Others have argued that in cases where a\nconditional construction does not appear to be putting forward any\ngenuine conditions, these are \u201cnonconditional\u201d\nconditionals (Geis and Lycan 1993)\u2014in other words they may just\nbe disguised affirmations.\n5. Conclusion\n\nGiven the different roles for \u201cif\u201d just identified, it is\nhardly surprising that generalisations about necessary and/or\nsufficient conditions are hard to formulate. Suppose, for example,\nsomeone tries to state a sufficient condition for a seminar being good\nin a context where the speaker and all the listeners share the view\nthat Solange\u2019s presence is a reason why seminars would be good.\nIn this case, Solange\u2019s presence might be said to be a\nsufficient condition of the seminar being good in the sense that her\npresence is a reason why it is good. Now, is there a similar sense in\nwhich the goodness of the seminar is a necessary condition of\nSolange\u2019s presence? The negative answer to this question is\nalready evident from the earlier discussion. If we follow von\nWright\u2019s proposal, mentioned above, we get the following result:\nthat the seminar is not good is a sufficient condition of Solange not\nbeing present. But this cannot plausibly be read as a sufficient\ncondition in anything like the sense of a reason why. At most, the\nfact of the seminar not being a good one may be a reason for thinking\nthat Solange was not at it. So how can we tell, in general, what kind\nof condition is being expressed in an \u201cif\u201d sentence? As\nnoted in the case of the sea battle, when rewriting in the formal mode\ncaptures the sense of what is being said, and when the formulations\n\u201cif p, q\u201d and \u201cp only if\nq\u201d seem idiomatically equivalent, then an inferential\ninterpretation will be in order, von Wright\u2019s equivalences will\nhold, and the material conditional gives a reasonable account of such\ncases. As indicated above, there are limitations to such an approach\nand it provides at best a partial account of the circumstances under\nwhich conditional sentences express necessary or sufficient\nconditions.\n\nAs already noted, even the inferential use of \u201cif\u201d is not\nalways associated primarily with the business of stating necessary and\nsufficient conditions. This observation, together with the cases and\ndistinctions mentioned in the present article, shows the need for\ncaution when we move from natural language conditionals to analysis of\nthem in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and also the\nneed for caution in modelling the latter conditions by means of formal\noperators. It appears that there are several kinds of conditionals,\nand correspondingly several kinds of conditions. As the developments\noutlined above have shown, there are as a result several formal\nschemes for translating and making sense of the variety of\nconditionals used in natural language and the conditions, if any, that\nthey express.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Blumberg, Albert E., 1976. <em>Logic: A First Course</em>, New\nYork: Alfred E.
