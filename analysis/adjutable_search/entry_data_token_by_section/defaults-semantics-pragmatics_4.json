    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Computational Semantics Landscape\n1.5 Computational Semantics Landscape\n\nThe computational semantics landscape contains a few landmarks in\nwhich the concept of a default figures prominently, albeit under\ndifferent labels. I have already discussed the role of defaults and\ninheritance reasoning in artificial intelligence research in the\nexample of SDRT. This kind of research in computational linguistics is\narguably the closest to theoretical linguistic semantics and\npragmatics in that it directly appeals to human practices in\nreasoning. Pelletier & Elio (2005) refer to this characteristic as\nthe psychologism of nonmonotonic logics, and thus a property that was\nso fiercely banished from logic by Frege as a form of a\n\u2018corrupting intrusion\u2019, in that \u2018being true\nis quite different from being held as true\u2019 (Frege\n1893: 202). Pelletier and Elio write:\n\nUnlike most other reasoning formalisms, nonmonotonic or default\nreasoning, including inheritance reasoning, is\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d \u2013 that is, it is defined only as\nwhat people do in circumstances where they are engaged in\n\u201ccommonsense reasoning\u201d. It follows from this that such\nfundamental issues as \u201cwhat are the good nonmonotonic\ninferences?\u201d or \u201cwhat counts as \u2018relevance\u2019 to\na default rule?\u201d, etc., are only discoverable by looking at\npeople and how they behave. It is not a formal\nexercise to be discovered by looking at mathematical systems, nor is\nit to be decided by such formal considerations as\n\u201csimplicity\u201d or \u201ccomputability\u201d, etc.\nPelletier & Elio (2005: 30).\n\n\nOther landmarks include research on default feature specification in\nsyntactic theory and default lexical inheritance (e.g., Gazdar et\nal. 1985; Boguraev & Pustejovsky 1990; Lascarides et al.\n1996), where default inheritance comes from a simple idea pertaining\nto all taxonomies: regular features belonging to an entity of a\ncertain type are inherited from the categories higher up in the\ntaxonomic hierarchy, that is simply by virtue of the membership of a\ncertain ontological type. As a result, only the non-default features\nhave to be attended to (on various semantic networks in computational\nlinguistics see also Stone 2016). To generalize, this line of research\ncan lead to incorporation of information into logical forms,\nincluding, as can be seen in the example of SDRT, dynamic logical\nforms of discourses. In a different camp there are statistical,\ndistributional approaches to meaning where meaning is derived from\ninformation about co-occurrence of items gleaned from corpora and then\nquantitatively analysed. This orientation gave rise to current\nvector-based approaches (see, e.g., Jurafsky & Martin 2017 [Other\nInternet Resources]; Coecke et al. 2010 and for discussion\nLiang & Potts 2015). Vector semantics exploits the finding that\ndates back at least to Harris (1954) and Firth (1957) that the meaning\nof a word can be computed from the distribution of the words in its\nimmediate context. The term \u2018vector semantics\u2019 derives\nfrom the representation of the quantitative values in this\ndistribution called a \u2018vector\u2019, where the latter is\ndefined as a distributional model that presents information in the\nform of a co-occurrence matrix. Vectors have been around since the\n1950s but it is only recently that such distributional methods have\nbeen combined with logic-based approaches to meaning (see Liang &\nPotts 2015). Vectors can measure the similarity of texts with respect\nto a lexical item, the similarity of lexical items with respect to\nsources, or, what interests us most, the co-occurrence of selected\nwords in a selection of contexts (using additional methods to rule out\nco-occurrence by chance). In distributional semantics therefore the\nsalient or default meaning is the meaning given by the observed high\nco-occurrence or, in other words, delimited by the high conditional\nprobability of its occurrence in the context of other words.\n\nCurrent compositional semantics is beginning to combine compositional\nsemantic theory (logic-based approaches discussed above) with\nstatistical models, conforming to the standard view of\ncompositionality on which complex meanings are a function of lexical\nmeanings and the mode of combination, arrived at through a recursive\nprocess, but at the same time aiming at capturing the generalization\nfrom (finite) past experiences that would inform machine learning.\nDefaults arise in this context in several different forms: (i) as\nshortcuts to standard meanings of more semantically predictable\ncategories, that is, closed-class words such as determiners, pronouns\nor sentential connectives. (This can be extended perhaps to types of\npredictable projective content such as various types of implicature or\npresupposition; see Tonhauser et al. 2013); (ii) as\npredictable cross-sentential discourse relations; (iii) as predictable\ndiscourse-anaphoric links; (iv) as meaning arising from frequent\nsyntagmatic associations; (v) as meaning arising from frequent\nconversational scenarios, to name a few salient concepts. In this new,\npositively eclectic orientation in computational linguistics that\ncombines logical and statistical approaches, the label\n\u2018default\u2019 is likely to lead to more confusion than utility\nin that it can pertain to either of the two contributing orientations.\nOn the other hand, if the findings lead to the same set of what we can\ncall \u2018shortcuts through possible interpretations\u2019, the\nconfusion may be of merely a methodological rather than ontological\nimportance.\n",
