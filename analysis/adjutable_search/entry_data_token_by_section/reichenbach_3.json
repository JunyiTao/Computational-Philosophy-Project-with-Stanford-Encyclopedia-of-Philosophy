    "main_text": "Causality and Probability || The Theory of Probability (1935, 1949)\n2.3 The Theory of Probability (1935, 1949)\n\nReichenbach continued to revise and elaborate his ideas about\nprobability in a series of papers in the early\n 1930s[3]\n until, in 1935, his The Theory of Probability provided a\nfuller statement of his developed view. Surprisingly, Reichenbach does\nnot acknowledge help from Richard von Mises, his colleague in Berlin\nand Istanbul in the period and the mathematician whose views on the\nfoundations of probability were closest to his own and are often\ndiscussed in the book. He does attribute part of the mathematical work\nin the book to Valentine Bargmann, who after finishing his doctorate\nin physics in Berlin fled to Switzerland in 1933 and later became an\nassistant to von Neumann and to Einstein at the Institute for Advanced\nStudy, from where in the 1940s he also assisted Reichenbach\u2019s\nwork on quantum theory. \n\nIt is fair to say that The Theory of Probability was not well\nreceived, drawing intense criticism from Karl Popper (1934), who had\nread Reichenbach\u2019s papers presenting a frequentist\ninterpretation of probability, C.I. Lewis (1952), Bertrand Russell\n(1948), and Ernest Nagel (1936, 1938). Kolmogorov\u2019s measure\ntheoretic axioms for probability, which appeared in 1933, soon\novershadowed Reichenbach\u2019s formulation of the theory of\nprobability. \n\nThe Theory of Probability uses class terms\u2014A,\nB, C\u2014and individual\nvariables\u2014x, y, z\u2014as well as\nreal variables\u2014p, q, u, r,\nw. Distinct individual variables are (unnecessarily)\nsometimes and sometimes not associated with distinct class names, but\nReichenbach\u2019s formulae without iterated probability conditionals\ncan be read as universally quantified with a single individual\nvariable. The earlier 10 axiom schemes for probability implication\n(1925d) are replaced by 4 axiom schemes expressed in\nReichenbach\u2019s abbreviated form as (1949f, p. 53\u201365): \n\nUnivocality: (p \u2260 q) \u2283 [(A\n\u2287p B)\u2009.\u2009(A\n\u2287q B) \u2261 (~A)]\nNormalization:\n\n\n(A \u2283 B) \u2283 \u2203p[(A\n\u2287p B)\u2009.\u2009(p =\n1)]\n~~A\u2009.\u2009(A\n\u2287p B) \u2283 (p \u2265 0)\n \nAddition: [(A \u2287p B) .\n(A \u2287q C) .\n(A.B \u2283 ~C)] \u2283\n\u2203r[(A \u2287r (B\n\u2228 C))\u2009.\u2009(r =\np+q)]\nMultiplication: [(A \u2287p\nB) . (A.B \u2287u\nC)] \u2283 \u2203w[(A\n\u2287w\nB.C)\u2009.\u2009(w =\np\u2217u)]\n\n\nReichenbach\u2019s intent with formula I is to say that where it\nexists, the probability has a unique value. Axiom II is meant to\nensure that the probabilities conditional on a nonempty set have\nvalues between 0 and 1 inclusive. Axiom III is Reichenbach\u2019s\nversion of the requirement that the probability of the union of\nmutually exclusive events is the sum of their probabilities. Axiom IV\nis essentially the chain rule of probability: P(CB |\nA) = P(C | BA)\nP(B | A). Axiom I is implicit in the\nKolmogorov axioms (see Section 1 (\u201cKolmogorov\u2019s\nProbability Calculus\u201d) in the entry on\n interpretations of probability)\n since probability is taken to be a real valued function. Axiom II\ncorresponds to Kolmogorov\u2019s first and second axioms, that\nprobability values are bounded between 0 and 1 inclusive. Axiom III\namounts to finite additivity because Reichenbach\u2019s\nlogic does not have infinite disjunctions: it is a finite restriction\nof Kolmogorov\u2019s third axiom, which postulates additivity of\nprobabilities for countable, even infinite, disjoint sets. Axiom IV\n(at least its interpretation in terms of the chain rule) follows from\nKolmorogov\u2019s first three axioms. Reichenbach requires it as an\nadditional axiom, because of his mixture of logical and mathematical\nnotation. Without the additional fourth axiom, Reichenbach could not\nswitch between logical conjunction and mathematical multiplication.\n\n\nReichenbach proceeds to show that finite frequencies satisfy his four\naxioms. He construes all probabilities as frequencies of sub-series in\na larger series\u2014or what is the same thing for finite sets,\ncardinalities of subsets in a universal set. Hence his probabilities\nare always with respect to a non-empty reference class, so the\nprobability that an event is in a class B is in\nReichenbach\u2019s notation, P(A, B) where\nA is the reference class\u2014similar to the modern notation\nof the conditional probability P(B | A).\nBut the probability logic axioms are so weak that many formal\nstructures satisfy them, and Reichenbach\u2019s claim is a long way\nfrom a representation theorem. He fails to provide the additional\nconstraints on the space that probabilities are applied to, which in\nKolmogorov\u2019s case are given by the assumption that the space is\na sigma-field, i.e. a field closed under complementation and countable\nunion. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s official definition of probability for infinite\nsequence pairs \u27e8xi,\nyi\u27e9 with\nxi in A, and\nyi in B, for which the limit\np of the relative frequency of B in A\nexists, is as follows: \u201cthe limit p is called the\nprobability from A to B within the sequence\npair.\u201d (1949f, p. 69). Constraints on the nature of the\nsequences are added later (1949f, section 30) that are aimed to\nformalize aspects of randomness. Probabilities of single cases are\n\u201cfictive\u201d or elliptical, to be understood as claims about\nthe frequency of a kind of case in an implicit reference class.\nElsewhere, Reichenbach puts more emphasis on finite frequencies and\neven suggests that limiting frequencies are simply a mathematical\ndevice for justifying inductive procedures (\u2018A letter to B.\nRussell\u2019, 1978, vol. II, p. 405\u2013406). Once introduced, the\nlogical framework is dropped in the mathematical development of\nprobability theory in the book. \n\nIn combination with the representation of probability relations by\nclaims in a quasilogical language, the limiting frequency\ninterpretation creates fundamental formal problems that Reichenbach\ndid not foresee. Sets of limiting relative frequencies are not closed\nunder finite intersection; they are not closed under countable union;\nthey do not satisfy countable additivity. They do not, in other words,\nform a sigma field, or a Borel field, or even a field. (See the\nentries on\n interpretations of probability,\n the early development of set theory, and\n set theory.)\n These and several other mathematical difficulties of\nReichenbach\u2019s setup are described in van Fraassen\n (1979).[4]\n\n\nReichenbach imposes two further axioms\u2014the axioms of order\n(1949f, p. 137)\u2014that are supposed to hold necessarily of\nlimiting frequencies for infinite time series. One is trivial,\nessentially asserting that a conditional frequency on lags\n(Reichenbach\u2019s term for lags is \u201cphases\u201d) of a\nconstant \u201cvariable\u201d can always be replaced by a\nconditional frequency on no lag of that variable. The second, however,\nappears to be a very strong stationarity principle that is not\ngenerally true: the probability of one variable conditional on a\nspecified common lag of other variables is invariant under all uniform\ntranslations of the lags. This axiom seems to derive directly from\nReichenbach\u2019s interpretation of the foundations of probability,\nin particular from Reichenbach\u2019s assumption about normal\nsequences, described below. \n\nIn addition to an axiomatization, Reichenbach attempts to provide a\nfoundation for probability claims in terms of properties of sequences,\nsimilar to von Mises. Reichenbach regarded von Mises attempt (von\nMises 1919) at formally characterizing a \u201crandom sequence\u201d\nas a failure and instead attempted to characterize a weaker sequence\nproperty\u2014a \u201cnormal\u201d sequence. In his account of\nnormal sequences Reichenbach retains (although the second only in a\nweaker form) two features that are deemed essential for random\nsequences: the lack of \u201cafter-effect\u201d and the invariance\nof the limiting relative frequency under subsequence selection.\nInformally, the \u201cinvariance under subsequence selection\u201d\nis supposed to capture the idea that the probabilities of events in\nany infinite subsequence selected from the original sequence by a\nprocedure based on the indices of events in the original sequence\nalone will be the same as the probabilities of events in the original\nsequence. \u201cThe lack of aftereffect\u201d is supposed to capture\nthe idea that given any initial segment of a sequence, one cannot\npredict the probability of the next event any better than predicting\nit based on the limiting relative frequency of events in the infinite\nsequence. Reichenbach\u2019s definition of lack of aftereffect is not\nbased on initial segments of sequences, but rather on subsequences\nselected by a particular set of rules (1949f, p. 142). Reichenbach\ndefines a \u201cselection\u201d S as any rule that\ndetermines for each member of a sequence whether it is a member of\nS (p. 143). He intends by a \u201crule\u201d literally any\nsubsequence. \n\nWe are unable to reconstruct exactly what Reichenbach may have\nintended, in particular since his definition of lack of aftereffect is\ndifficult to distinguish from the criterion of invariance under\nsubsequence selection. But we believe it is something close to the\nfollowing: A sequence of Bi is\n\u201cfree from aftereffect\u201d if (i) a subsequence is selected\nbased on a rule of the form \u201cFor each index i in the\nsequence, include the (i+k)th element in\nthe sequence if the ith element is B (or\n~B),\u201d (ii) if the subsequence thus selected has the\nsame event probabilities as the original sequence, and (iii) if this\nholds for all lags k > 0. If our reconstruction is\ncorrect, this would distinguish Reichenbach\u2019s account of lack of\naftereffect from that of invariance under subsequence selection,\nbecause the former includes subsequence selection rules that depend on\nthe values of certain items in the sequence, while the latter includes\nonly rules that are based on the indices. Two more definitions are\nrequired for the full picture. First, a selection S of a\nsubsequence of sequence A belongs to the \u201cdomain of\ninvariance\u201d of B, if the probability of B (for\nall lags) in S is unchanged from the probability of\nB in A, and if the same holds for any selection\nS from A with a lag. Second, a subsequence selected\nby an algebraic rule that partitions the sequence\nA\u2014e.g. take every fourth element (see p. 144 for\ndetails)\u2014is called a \u201cregular division\u201d of\nA. Putting the pieces together, Reichenbach requires for the\n\u201cnormality\u201d of a sequence A that it be free of\naftereffect and that all \u201cregular divisions\u201d of A\nare in the domain of invariance of B. This condition of\nregular divisions seems to underlie the stationarity expressed in the\nsecond axiom of order. \n\nIf random sequences are taken to satisfy (at least) the conditions of\nthe lack of aftereffect and invariance of subsequence selection under\nany selection rule, then Reichenbach\u2019s restriction of\nsubsequence selection rules to regular divisions implies that the set\nof normal sequences is a proper superset of that of random sequences.\nReichenbach accepts this weakening to avoid some of the difficulties\nin characterizing a random sequence, and to broaden his earlier\nnotions of probability to include sequences of trials, which might not\nbe perfectly independent. In later writings, he seems to suggest that\nas long as the sequence converges, probability claims can be applied\nto the component events. \n\nA large section of the book is devoted to reconstructing classical\nresults in the theory of probability as claims about relative\nfrequencies, including various continuous distributions and\nBernoulli\u2019s theorem. Reichenbach claims that probabilities on\ncontinuous domains are \u201cisomorphic\u201d to limiting relative\nfrequencies, but, as van Fraassen (1979) notes, it is difficult to see\nany sense in which that is true. The remainder of the book is not\nabout probability per se, but about its epistemological role. \n\nFurther Reading. A detailed attempt at the reconstruction of\nReichenbach\u2019s account of probability and its epistemological\ngrounding can be found in Eberhardt & Glymour (2011), which\nincludes specific references to the original sources. \n",
