    "main_text": "Pattern (li) || Pattern and Nature\n3.2 Pattern and Nature\n\nBy the start of the Song dynasty, the Chinese character xing\n\u6027, which is usually translated as \u201cnature\u201d or\n\u201cthe nature\u201d, had long been used to refer to important\nfeatures of people and things that play a major role in defining what\nthey are and determining how they ought to be. For much of the history\nof Confucian thought before the Song there had been a wide-ranging and\ngenerally unresolved debate about the moral character of human nature\nin particular, with Mencius famously arguing that human nature is\ngood, Xunzi (c. 310\u2013c. 221 BCE) contending that it is bad, and\nothers defending various moderate and hybrid views (Tiwald 2016:\n437\u2013440). By the end of the 11th century, however, a\nconsensus formed around a strong interpretation of the doctrine that\npeople are good by nature, according to which people have well-formed\nmoral dispositions and sensitivities innately and permanently. Cheng\nYi developed the most influential formulation of this view. According\nto Cheng, humans necessarily have a good nature because humans\nnecessarily have Pattern (li), which includes the tendencies\ntoward life-generativity that all things share, and this Pattern is an\nessential and important feature of ourselves, determinative of what we\nare and how we ought to be. Cheng and later Neo-Confucians took his\ninterpretation to be implicit in the works of the authoritative\nclassical Confucians, especially Mencius, but it is evident that their\ninterpretation was more radical than what Mencius in fact thought.\nMencius is most plausibly read as endorsing the view that we are born\nwith strong proclivities or sprouts of goodness which, if we are\nprovided with a healthy upbringing, will naturally develop into\nvirtues, and his primary concern was with the nature of humans in\nparticular, not the nature of all living things (Mencius 2A6,\n6A1\u20136, 6A8). Cheng Yi and most of the notable Neo-Confucians\nafter him, however, thought we had well-formed dispositions and\nsensitivities right from the start, that these are ineradicable\nfeatures of us, and that they are in fact universally shared, so that\nthe nature in us is essentially the same as the nature in all things\n(Ivanhoe 2016: 36\u201348; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 159,\n166).\n\nBy locating our good nature in Pattern, however, Cheng Yi introduced\nnew philosophical challenges. His view assumes that all human beings\nhave Pattern at all times, and yet it is obvious that few if any human\nbeings are good at all times, so there must be some way of explaining\nthe pervasiveness of human moral failure. Furthermore, Pattern is\nshared by all beings, human or otherwise, so the nature that we\nidentify with Pattern cannot by itself suffice to distinguish us from\nnon-human things. Cheng\u2019s response in brief was to posit a\nsecond sort of nature consisting of one\u2019s endowment of\nqi, sometimes called the \u201cmaterial nature\u201d or\n\u201cthe nature of one\u2019s qi-constitution\u201d\n(qizhi zhi xing \u6c23\u8cea\u4e4b\u6027). The nature\nthat he identified with Pattern he called by various names, including\n\u201cinherent nature\u201d or \u201coriginal nature\u201d\n(benxing \u672c\u6027), referring to our nature as it is\nwhen not distorted or altered by external stimuli, prior to the\narousal of occurrent emotions. Both moral failure and differences in\nspecies or kind can be traced to differences in one\u2019s\nqi-constitution. If human beings sometimes fail to be good\nand virtuous it is because of dark or turbid qi which\nprevents Pattern from expressing itself or responding correctly, and\ndark and turbid qi is ubiquitous. The configuration and\nquality of qi which constitutes a thing also determines the\nparticular type or species it is (Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 166).\nThis was a view that Zhu Xi came to both refine and popularize in his\nown writings and teachings (Ivanhoe 2000: 45\u201349; Tiwald &\nVan Norden 2014: 170\u2013178). But Zhu was reluctant to say that we\nliterally have two separate natures, recommending instead that we have\nonly one nature that can be described in different terms, as\n\u201cinherent nature\u201d when considered in terms of its\nintrinsic structure and as \u201cmaterial nature\u201d when\nconsidering in terms of its interactions with qi (Angle &\nTiwald 2017: 64\u201367).\n",
