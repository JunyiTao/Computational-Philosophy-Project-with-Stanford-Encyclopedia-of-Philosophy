Philosophy of Science: Necessary Truth\n\nA particularly intriguing aspect of Whewell\u2019s philosophy of\nscience is his claim that empirical science can reach necessary\ntruths. Explaining this apparently contradictory claim was considered\nby Whewell to be the \u201cultimate problem\u201d of philosophy (see\nthe important paper by Morrison 1997). Whewell accounted for it by\nreference to his antithetical epistemology. Necessary truths are\ntruths which can be known a priori; they can be known in this\nway because they are necessary consequences of ideas which are a\npriori. They are necessary consequences in the sense of being\nanalytic consequences. Whewell explicitly rejected Kant\u2019s claim\nthat necessary truths are synthetic. Using the example \u201c7 + 8 =\n15,\u201d Whewell claimed that \u201cwe refer to our conceptions of\nseven, of eight, and of addition, and as soon as we possess the\nconceptions distinctly, we see that the sum must be 15.\u201d That\nis, merely by knowing the meanings of \u201cseven,\u201d\nand \u201ceight,\u201d and \u201caddition,\u201d we see that it\nfollows necessarily that \u201c7 + 8 = 15\u201d (1848, 471).\n\nOnce the Ideas and conceptions are explicated, so that we understand\ntheir meanings, the necessary truths which follow from them are seen\nas being necessarily true. Thus, once the Idea of Space is explicated,\nit is seen to be necessarily true that \u201ctwo straight lines\ncannot enclose a space.\u201d Whewell suggested that the first law of\nmotion is also a necessary truth, which was knowable a priori\nonce the Idea of Cause and the associated conception of force were\nexplicated. This is why empirical science is needed to see necessary\ntruths: because, as we saw above, empirical science is needed in order\nto explicate the Ideas. Thus Whewell also claimed that, in the course\nof science, truths which at first required experiment to be known are\nseen to be capable of being known independently of experiment. That\nis, once the relevant Idea is clarified, the necessary connection\nbetween the Idea and an empirical truth becomes apparent. Whewell\nexplained that \u201cthough the discovery of the First Law of Motion\nwas made, historically speaking, by means of experiment, we have now\nattained a point of view in which we see that it might have been\ncertainly known to be true independently of experience\u201d (1847,\nI, 221). Science, then, consists in the \u201cidealization of\nfacts,\u201d the transferring of truths from the empirical to the\nideal side of the fundamental antithesis. He described this process as\nthe \u201cprogressive intuition of necessary truths.\u201d\n\nAlthough they follow analytically from the meanings of ideas our minds\nsupply, necessary truths are nevertheless informative statements about\nthe physical world outside us; they have empirical content.\nWhewell\u2019s justification for this claim is a theological one.\nWhewell noted that God created the universe in accordance with certain\n\u201cDivine Ideas.\u201d That is, all objects and events in the\nworld were created by God to conform to certain of his ideas. For\nexample, God made the world such that it corresponds to the idea of\nCause partially expressed by the axiom \u201cevery event has a\ncause.\u201d Hence in the universe every event conforms to this idea,\nnot only by having a cause but by being such that it could not occur\nwithout a cause. On Whewell\u2019s view, we are able to have\nknowledge of the world because the Fundamental Ideas which are used to\norganize our sciences resemble the ideas used by God in his creation\nof the physical world. The fact that this is so is no coincidence: God\nhas created our minds such that they contain these same ideas. That\nis, God has given us our ideas (or, rather, the \u201cgerms\u201d of\nthe ideas) so that \u201cthey can and must agree with the\nworld\u201d (1860a, 359). God intends that we can have knowledge of\nthe physical world, and this is possible only through the use of ideas\nwhich resemble those that were used in creating the world. Hence with\nour ideas\u2014once they are properly \u201cunfolded\u201d and\nexplicated\u2014we can colligate correctly the facts of the world and\nform true theories. And when these ideas are distinct, we can know\na priori the axioms which express their meaning.\n\nAn interesting consequence of this interpretation of Whewell\u2019s\nview of necessity is that every law of nature is a necessary truth, in\nvirtue of following analytically from some idea used by God in\ncreating the world. Whewell drew no distinction between truths which\ncan be idealized and those which cannot; thus, potentially, any\nempirical truth can be seen to be a necessary truth, once the ideas\nand conceptions are explicated sufficiently. For example, Whewell\nsuggests that experiential truths such as \u201csalt is\nsoluble\u201d may be necessary truths, even if we do not recognize\nthis necessity (i.e., even if it is not yet knowable a\npriori) (1860b, 483). Whewell\u2019s view thus destroys the line\ntraditionally drawn between laws of nature and the axiomatic\npropositions of the pure sciences of mathematics; mathematical truth\nis granted no special status.\n\nIn this way Whewell suggested a view of scientific understanding which\nis, perhaps not surprisingly, grounded in his conception of natural\ntheology. Since our ideas are \u201cshadows\u201d of the Divine\nIdeas, to see a law as a necessary consequence of our ideas is to see\nit as a consequence of the Divine Ideas exemplified in the world.\nUnderstanding involves seeing a law as being not an arbitrary\n\u201caccident on the cosmic scale,\u201d but as a necessary\nconsequence of the ideas God used in creating the universe. Hence the\nmore we idealize the facts, the more difficult it will be to deny\nGod\u2019s existence. We will come to see more and more truths as the\nintelligible result of intentional design. This view is related to the\nclaim Whewell had earlier made in his Bridgewater Treatise (1833),\nthat the more we study the laws of nature the more convinced we will\nbe in the existence of a Divine Law-giver.
