What is the wider significance of\nsuch a result?\n\nFrom time to time, the Liar has been argued to show us something\nfar-reaching about philosophy. For instance, Grim (1991) has argued\nthat it shows the world to be essentially \u2018incomplete\u2019 in\nsome sense, and that there can be no omniscient being. McGee (1991)\nand others suggest that the Liar shows the notion of truth to be a\nvague notion. Glanzberg (2001) holds that the Liar shows us something\nimportant about the nature of context dependence in language, while\nEklund (2002) holds that it shows us something important about the\nnature of semantic competence and the languages we speak. Gupta and\nBelnap (1993) claim that it reveals important properties of the\ngeneral notion of definition. And there are other lessons, and\nvariations on such lessons, that have been drawn.\n\nOf more immediate concern, at least for our purposes here, is what the\nLiar shows us about the basic principles governing truth, and about\nlogic. In a skeptical vein, Tarski himself (1935, 1944) seems to have\nthought the Liar shows the ordinary notion of truth to be incoherent,\nand in need of replacement with a more scientifically respectable one.\n(For more on Tarski, see the entries on\n Tarski\n and\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions.\n For more on Tarski\u2019s aims and purposes, see Heck 1997.) More\ncommon, and perhaps the dominant thread in the solutions to the Liar,\nis the idea that the basic principles governing truth are more subtle\nthan the T-schema reflects.\n\nThe Liar has also formed the core of arguments against classical\nlogic, as it is some key features of classical logic that allow\ncapture and release to result in absurdity. Notable among these are\nthe arguments for logics that are paracomplete (e.g., Kripke 1975;\nField 2008) or paraconsistent (e.g., Asenjo 1966; Priest 1984, 2006).\nHowever, Ripley (2013b) argues that classical logic can be maintained\nwhile shedding the features in question.\n\nIn many cases inspired by wider views of the significance of the\nparadox, there have been a number of attempts to one way or another\nresolve the paradox. It is to these proposed solutions that we now\nturn.\n",
