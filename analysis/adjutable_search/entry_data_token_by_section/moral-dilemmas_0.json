    "main_text": "Examples\n1. Examples\n\nIn Book I of Plato\u2019s Republic, Cephalus defines\n\u2018justice\u2019 as speaking the truth and paying one\u2019s\ndebts. Socrates quickly refutes this account by suggesting that it\nwould be wrong to repay certain debts\u2014for example, to return a\nborrowed weapon to a friend who is not in his right mind.\nSocrates\u2019 point is not that repaying debts is without moral\nimport; rather, he wants to show that it is not always right to repay\none\u2019s debts, at least not exactly when the one to whom the debt\nis owed demands repayment. What we have here is a conflict between two\nmoral norms: repaying one\u2019s debts and protecting others from\nharm. And in this case, Socrates maintains that protecting others from\nharm is the norm that takes priority.\n\nNearly twenty-four centuries later, Jean-Paul Sartre described a moral\nconflict the resolution of which was, to many, less obvious than the\nresolution to the Platonic conflict. Sartre (1957) tells of a student\nwhose brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940. The\nstudent wanted to avenge his brother and to fight forces that he\nregarded as evil. But the student\u2019s mother was living with him,\nand he was her one consolation in life. The student believed that he\nhad conflicting obligations. Sartre describes him as being torn\nbetween two kinds of morality: one of limited scope but certain\nefficacy, personal devotion to his mother; the other of much wider\nscope but uncertain efficacy, attempting to contribute to the defeat\nof an unjust aggressor.\n\nWhile the examples from Plato and Sartre are the ones most commonly\ncited, there are many others. Literature abounds with such cases. In\nAeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon, the protagonist ought to save\nhis daughter and ought to lead the Greek troops to Troy; he ought to\ndo each but he cannot do both. And Antigone, in Sophocles\u2019s play\nof the same name, ought to arrange for the burial of her brother,\nPolyneices, and ought to obey the pronouncements of the city\u2019s\nruler, Creon; she can do each of these things, but not both. Areas of\napplied ethics, such as biomedical ethics, business ethics, and legal\nethics, are also replete with such cases.\n",
