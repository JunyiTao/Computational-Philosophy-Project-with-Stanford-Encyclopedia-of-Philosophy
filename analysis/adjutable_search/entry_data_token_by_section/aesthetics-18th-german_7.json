    "main_text": "Baumgarten and Meier: Aesthetics as the Analogue of Rational Cognition || Baumgarten\n3.1 Baumgarten\n\nBaumgarten was the son of a Pietist minister from Berlin, but was\norphaned by the time he was eight. He followed his older brother Jacob\nSigismund (who would become a prominent theologian and historian of\nreligion) to Halle when he was thirteen. The Baumgartens thus arrived\nin Halle just after Wolff had been expelled and the study of his\nphilosophy banned, although the ban was less strictly enforced at the\nfamous Pietist orphanage and school in Halle (the Franckesche Stift)\nwhere they went first than at the university. The younger Baumgarten\nstarted at the university at sixteen (in 1730), and studied theology,\nphilology, poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy, especially Leibniz, whose\nphilosophy unlike that of Wolff had not been banned. He began teaching\nthere himself in 1735, upon the acceptance of his thesis on poetry,\nand published his Metaphysics in 1739. In 1740, the same year\nas he published his Ethics, he was called to a\nprofessorship\u2014or more precisely, ordered to accept it\u2014at\nanother Prussian university, in Frankfurt an der Oder. Georg Friedrich\nMeier (1718\u20131777), who had been studying with Baumgarten, took\nover his classes and was himself appointed professor at Halle in\n1746.\n\n\nHaving published the textbooks for his metaphysics and ethics classes\n(which Kant would still use decades later), Baumgarten then returned\nto aesthetics, and began working on a major treatise in 1742. The\nfirst volume of his Aesthetica appeared in 1750. It was\nwritten in Latin, like Baumgarten\u2019s other works, and was the first\nwork ever to use the name of the new discipline as a title. The next\nyear, however, Baumgarten\u2019s health began to decline, and a second\nvolume of the Aesthetica came out only in 1758, under\npressure from the publisher. The two volumes cover just under a third\nof Baumgarten\u2019s original plan, although they may have included the\nmost original part of the plan. Meanwhile, Meier had been publishing\nprofusely in Halle since the early 1740s, with works in or relevant to\naesthetics including a Theoretical Doctrine of the Emotions\nin 1744, a twenty-five part Evaluation of Gottsched\u2019s Poetics\ncollected in book form in 1747, a three-volume Foundations of the\nBeautiful Sciences from 1748\u20131750, and a condensation of\nthe latter, the Extract from the Foundations of the Beautiful Arts\nand Sciences in 1757. (Meier also published massive textbooks in\nlogic, metaphysics, and ethics, as well as a memoir of Baumgarten and\na German translation of Baumgarten\u2019s\nLatin Metaphysics). Although Meier thus published his main\ntreatise in aesthetics before Baumgarten did, he claimed it was based\non Baumgarten\u2019s lectures, and always presented himself as a disciple\nof Baumgarten.\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s Meditations on Poetry conclude with his famous\nintroduction of the term \u201caesthetics\u201d: \u201cThe Greek\nphilosophers and the Church fathers have always carefully\ndistinguished between the aistheta and the noeta,\u201d that is,\nbetween objects of sense and objects of thought, and while the latter,\nthat is, \u201cwhat can be cognized through the higher faculty\u201d\nof mind, are \u201cthe object of logic, the aistheta are the subject\nof the episteme aisthetike or AESTHETICS,\u201d the science of\nperception (Meditationes, \u00a7CXVI, p. 86).  But this work\nsays nothing about in what way the new discipline might be a general\nscience of perception, and analyzes only the nature of poetry and our\nexperience of it. We will first see what is novel in Baumgarten\u2019s\ntheory of poetry, and then turn to his larger work to see what it\nsuggests about the general character of the new discipline. Baumgarten\nbegins the work with a series of definitions, defining\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d as a \u201cseries of words that bring to mind\n[intelligimus] connected representations,\u201d\n\u201csensible representations\u201d as ones \u201creceived through\nthe lower part of the cognitive faculty,\u201d \u201csensible\ndiscourse\u201d as a \u201cdiscourse of sensible\nrepresentations,\u201d and finally a \u201cpoem\u201d as a\n\u201cperfect sensible discourse.\u201d The parts of sensible\ndiscourse are \u201c(1) sensible representations, (2) their\ninterconnections, and (3) the words, or the articulate sounds which\nare represented by the letters and which symbolize the words,\u201d\nand sensible discourse is \u201cdirected toward the apprehension of\nsensible discourse\u201d (Meditationes,\n\u00a7\u00a7I\u2013IX, pp.  6\u201310). The key thoughts in this\nseries of definitions is that poetry is aimed not just at conveying\ntruth, but at conveying it by means of \u201csensible\nrepresentations,\u201d or imagery drawn from the senses, and that the\n\u201cperfection\u201d of a poem may lie in both its medium, that\nis, the words its uses, and the imagery it arouses, and indeed in the\nrelationship between these two dimensions. Thus Baumgarten introduces\nthe idea that the sensible imagery a work of art arouses is not just a\nmedium, more or less perfect, for conveying truth, but a locus of\nperfection in its own right. This is a view that was barely hinted at\nby Wolff, and not at all in his discussion of imitation as the\nperfection of mimetic arts, but only in his discussion of mixed arts\nlike architecture, where he took into account the appearance as well\nas the function of structural elements.\n\n\nAs he continues Baumgarten remains within the Wolffian framework by\ndefining sensible representations as clear rather than\nobscure\u2014thus he rejects poetry that aims at obscurity for its\nown sake (Meditationes, \u00a7XIII, p. 14)\u2014but confused\nrather than distinct, and thus as conveying more representations\npacked together rather than fewer that are neatly separated. Or as he\nputs it, poems aim for extensive rather\nthan intensive clarity, conveying more rather than less\ninformation but without separating the images from each other, as\nwould be aimed for in scientific or \u201clogical\u201d discourse\n(Meditationes, \u00a7\u00a7XVI\u2013XVII, p. 16). And since\nindividuals are more fully determined, or more fully characterized,\nthan any abstraction, \u201cparticular representations are in the\nhighest degree poetic\u201d (Meditationes, \u00a7XIX,\np. 18): poetry achieves its goal of arousing a density of images by\nportraying individuals in particular circumstances rather than by\ntrafficking in generalities and abstractions. Thus Baumgarten turns\nwhat is a vice in scientific knowledge\u2014connoting too many ideas\nwithout clearly distinguishing among them\u2014into the paradigm\nvirtue of poetry.\n\n\nWhat is particularly striking is that he then uses what we might call\nthis quantitative conception of the aim of poetry, that it arouse more\nand denser rather than fewer and more clearly separated images, as the\nbasis for an argument that poetry should be emotionally\naffecting. First he argues that poetry aims to arouse our affects or\nengage our emotions simply because they are sensible:\nSince affects are more notable degrees of pain and\npleasure, their sensible representations are given in representing\nsomething to oneself confusedly as good or bad, and thus they\ndetermine poetic representations, and to arouse affects is\npoetic. (Meditationes, \u00a7XXV, p. 24)\n\n\nBut then he goes on to give an explicitly\nquantitative argument for this conclusion:\n\n\nThe same can be demonstrated by this reasoning also: we represent more\nin those things which we represent as good and bad for us than if we\ndo not so represent them; therefore representations of things which\nare confusedly exhibited as good or bad for us are extensively clearer\nthan if they were not so displayed, hence they are more poetic.  Now\nsuch representations are motions of the affects, hence to arouse\naffects is poetic. (Meditationes, \u00a7XXVI, pp.\n24\u20136)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten thus innovates within the formal structure of Wolffian\nphilosophy in order to accommodate a non-cognitivist aspect of the\naims of art. Indeed, his emphasis on the poetic arousal of emotion has\nrecently been argued to be a subtle Pietist response to Wolffian\nintellectualism. This aspect of Baumgarten\u2019s early poetics clearly\nimpressed his student Meier, who devoted one of his earliest books to\na Theoretical Doctrine of the Emotions, or\n\u201cGem\u00fcthsbewegungen,\u201d literally,\n\u201cmovements of the mind.\u201d Meier states that\nAesthetics is in general the science of sensible\ncognition. This science concerns itself with everything that can be\nassigned in more detail to sensible cognition and to its\npresentation. Now since the passions have a strong influence on\nsensible cognition and its presentation, aesthetics for its part can\nrightly demand a theory of the emotions. (Meier, Theoretische\nLehre der Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a77, p. 7)\n\n\nHowever, since Baumgarten himself does not give\nas much emphasis to the emotional aspect of the experience of art in\nhis Aesthetica as his earlier Meditations might lead\nus to expect, perhaps because it remained incomplete, we will return\nto Meier\u2019s development of this theme only after we have considered\nBaumgarten\u2019s mature work.\n\n\nBefore we can turn to the Aesthetica, however, we must look\nat some of the key definitions Baumgarten lays down in the chapter on\n\u201cEmpirical Psychology\u201d in his Metaphysics.\nBaumgarten begins by defining the \u201cinferior\u201d or\n\u201clower faculty of cognition\u201d as that which works with\nsensible representations, which are in turn \u201cindistinct, that\nis, obscure or confused\u201d (Metaphysik,\n\u00a7\u00a7382\u20133, pp.  115\u201316). Sensible representations\ncan be developed in either of two ways, however: either with\nincreasing clarity of their component \u201cmarks,\u201d in which\ncase they acquire \u201cgreater clarity\u201d (claritas\nintensive maior), or with increasing \u201cmultitude of\nmarks,\u201d in which case they acquire \u201cliveliness\u201d\n(vividitas, claritas extensive maior, cogitationum nitor)\n(Nitor means brightness or splendor). The former development\nof cognition leads to proofs, while what makes a perception lively is\na \u201cpainterly\u201d form of clarity (eine malende),\nthus one that consists in richness of imagery rather than analytical\nclarity (Metaphysik, \u00a7393, p. 119). It is this\nliveliness rather than probative clarity which is the basis of\naesthetic experience.\n\n\nBaumgarten then defines judgment as the representation of the\nperfection or imperfection of things. Judgment is initially divided\ninto \u201cpractical\u201d judgment, the object of which is\n\u201cthings foreseen,\u201d and \u201ctheoretical judgment,\u201d\nwhich concerns everything else (Metaphysik, \u00a7451, p.\n139). Theoretical judgment is in turn divided into that which is\ndistinct and that which is rather sensible, and the \u201cability to\njudge sensibly is taste in the broad,\u201d that is,\naesthetic sense. So taste is the ability to judge perfections and\nimperfections sensibly rather than intellectually. Perfections and\nimperfections, it should be noted, are defined entirely formally as\nthe \u201cagreement or disagreement\u201d of the \u201cmanifold of\na thing\u201d (Metaphysik, \u00a7452, p. 139). Next,\nBaumgarten divides the sensible representation or judgment of\nperfections and imperfections into the \u201cintuitive\u201d and the\n\u201csymbolic,\u201d that is, those which consist in sensible\nproperties directly and those which consist in sensible properties\ntaken as symbols of something else, and then adds that the sensible\ncognition of a perfection is pleasing and that of its imperfection\ndispleasing. If I have sensible cognition neither of an object\u2019s\nperfection nor its imperfection, then it is indifferent to me\n(Metaphysik, \u00a7478, p. 150). Finally, Baumgarten states\nthat beauty is perfection perceived by means of the senses rather than\nby the pure intellect (Metaphysik, \u00a7488,\npp. 154\u20135).\n\n\nThus far, then, Baumgarten has remained within the conceptual\nframework of Wolff. One key addition to Wolff that he makes in\nthe Metaphysics, however, is the concept of the analogon\nrationis, the \u201canalogue of reason.\u201d He writes:\n\n\nI cognize the interconnection of some things distinctly, and of others\nindistinctly, consequently I have the faculty for both.  Consequently\nI have an understanding, for insight into the connections of things,\nthat is, reason (ratio); and a faculty for\nindistinct insight into the connections of things, which consists of\nthe following: 1) the sensible faculty for insight into the\nconcordances among things, thus sensible wit; 2) the sensible faculty\nfor cognizing the differences among things, thus sensible acumen; 3)\nsensible memory; 4) the faculty of invention; 5) the faculty of\nsensible judgment and taste together with the judgment of the senses;\n6) the expectation of similar cases; and 7) the faculty of sensible\ndesignation. All of these lower faculties of cognition, in so far as\nthey represent the connections among things, and in this respect are\nsimilar to reason, comprise that which is similar to reason\n(analogon rationis), or the sum of all the cognitive\nfaculties that represent the connections among things\nindistinctly. (Metaphysik, \u00a7468,\np. 146)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s departure from Wolff here may be subtle, but his idea is\nthat the use of a broad range of our mental capacities for dealing\nwith sensory representations and imagery is not an inferior and\nprovisional substitute for reason and its logical and\nscientific analysis, but something parallel to reason.\nMoreover, this complex of human mental powers is productive of\npleasure, through the sensible representation of perfection, in its\nown right.  Baumgarten has not yet introduced the idea that aesthetic\npleasure comes from the free play of our mental powers, but he has\nrelaxed the grip of the assumption that aesthetic response is a\nstraightforward case of cognition.\n\n\nThe potential of this idea finally begins to emerge in\nthe Aesthetica. Taking up where the Meditations had\nleft off, Baumgarten begins the \u201cProlegomena\u201d of this work\nwith his famous definition of aesthetics:\nAesthetics (the theory of the liberal arts, the\nlogic of the lower capacities of cognition [gnoseologia\ninferior], the art of thinking beautifully, the art of\nthe analogon rationis) is the science of sensible\ncognition. (Aesthetica, \u00a71)\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s list of synonyms may be confusing,\nfor it includes both traditional and novel designations of his\nsubject matter. He explains in the preface to the second edition of\nthe Metaphysics that he\nadds synonymous designations from other authors in\nparentheses alongside [his own] defining expressions so that the\nlatter might more easily be understood. (Vorreden zur\nMetaphysik, p. 43)\n\n\nYet it is clear that he means his own new science\nto be broader in scope than some of the more traditional definitions\nhe brackets: he intends to provide a general science of\nsensible cognition rather than just a theory of the fine arts\nor our taste for them.  Although Baumgarten makes some broad claims\nfor the new science, this is not where the novelty of\nthe Aesthetica lies, for at least in the extant part of the\nwork Baumgarten never actually develops this theme. Instead, the\ninnovation comes at the beginning of the first chapter of the work,\nwhen Baumgarten writes that\nThe aim of aesthetics is the perfection of\nsensible cognition as such, that is, beauty, while its imperfection as\nsuch, that is, ugliness, is to be avoided. (Aesthetica,\n\u00a714)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s departure from Wolff\u2019s formula that beauty is the\nsensitive cognition of perfection may easily be overlooked, but in his\ntransformation of that into his own formula that beauty is the\nperfection of sensitive cognition he is saying that beauty lies\nnot\u2014or as his subsequent practice suggests, not just\u2014in\nthe representation of some objective perfection in a form accessible\nto our senses, but rather\u2014or also\u2014in the exploitation of\nthe specific possibilities of sensible representation for their own\nsake. In other words, there is potential for beauty in the form of a\nwork as well as in its content because its form can be pleasing to our\ncomplex capacity for sensible representation\u2014the analogon\nrationis\u2014just as its content can be pleasing to our\ntheoretical or practical reason itself. The satisfaction of those\nmental powers summed up in the analogon rationis is a source\nof pleasure in its own right.\n\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? Baumgarten\u2019s recognition of the\nperfection of sensible cognition as well as the perfection of what is\nrepresented as a distinct source of pleasure in beauty leads him to\nrecognize not just one but in fact three different potential sources\nof beauty in a work of art: \u201cthe harmony of the thoughts insofar\nas we abstract from their order and their signs,\u201d or means of\nexpression; \u201cthe harmony of the order in which we meditate upon\nthe beautifully thought content,\u201d and \u201cthe harmony of the\nsigns\u201d or means of expression \u201camong themselves and with\nthe content and the order of the content\u201d (Aesthetica,\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320). Here Baumgarten is importing the traditional\nrhetorical concepts of inventio, dispositio\nand elocutio into his system, and conceiving of the latter\ntwo, the harmony of the thoughts and the harmony of the expression\nwith the thoughts, as the dimensions in which the potentials for\npleasure within our distinctively sensible manner of representing and\nthinking are realized. He thus recognizes those aspects of works of\nart, which were touched upon only in passing by Wolff and Gottsched,\nas sources of pleasure internal to works of art that are equally\nsignificant with the pleasure that arises from the content of works,\nconsidered as representations of perfections outside of the works\nthemselves. The three main sections of Baumgarten\u2019s planned project,\nthe \u201cheuristic,\u201d \u201cmethodology,\u201d and\n\u201csemiotics\u201d were intended to cover these three sources of\npleasure in works of art. (see Aesthetica, \u00a713).\n\n\nAs it happened, Baumgarten did not live to complete even the first of\nthese three parts. Further, the material he did complete suggests that\nhe may have been more successful in making conceptual space for the\nappreciation of the particularly sensible aspects of art than in\nsubstantively changing how art is actually experienced. What\nBaumgarten does is to take a list of the categories of the perfections\nof the content of logical or scientific cognition and construct a\nparallel list by adding the adjective \u201csensible\u201d to them\nto arrive at a list of sensible or aesthetic perfections (and Meier\nmakes a similar addition to lists of the perfections of the\norganization and expression of scientific knowledge). Nevertheless,\nsome of Baumgarten\u2019s categories of aesthetic qualities are\nimportant. The list of the perfections of every kind of cognition that\nBaumgarten gives in the first chapter of the Aesthetica is\n\u201cwealth, magnitude, truth, clarity, and liveliness\u201d\n(ubertas, magnitudo, veritas, claritas, \ncertitudo\net vita cognitionis), and thus beauty consists in the aesthetic\nversions of these perfections (Aesthetica,\n\u00a7\u00a722\u201325).\n\n\nHowever, in his classroom lectures on the Aesthetica,\nBaumgarten particularly emphasized the moral magnitude of the\nsubject matter of works of art as a major source of our pleasure in\nthem, and there mentions that works of art will therefore be touching,\nthat is to say, emotionally moving. Baumgarten stressed that the moral\ncontent of a work of art is only one source of beauty, and that a work\nof art can be beautiful without any moral grandeur.\n\u201c[A]esthetic dignity,\u201d he claimed, \u201cbelongs to\naesthetic magnitude as a part to the whole,\u201d but if a work of\nart represents moral agents then it cannot be maximally beautiful\nwithout representing moral dignity, and it certainly cannot be\nbeautiful if it conveys an attitude contrary to morality. What is\nimportant here, finally, is the moral standing of what is contained in\nthe work of art, not the actual morality of the artist himself.\n",
