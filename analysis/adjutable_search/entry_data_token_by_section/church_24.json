    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Metaphysics and the Logistic Method\n6.1 Metaphysics and the Logistic Method\n\nChurch\u2019s mature view was that discussion of metaphysical\ndoctrines is only worthwhile if they can be reformulated and developed\nusing the logistic method. For example, he thought that the question\nof the legitimacy of the distinction between form and matter should be\ninvestigated by setting up a formal language, which is used to isolate\nthe form of a proposition as well as of the corresponding sentence, so\nthat one can reinterpret its non-logical vocabulary and study what is\ncommon under various reinterpretations: \u201cthis may be considered\na more precise formulation of the traditional distinction between form\nand matter\u201d (1956a [BE: 372\u20133 and 379]; 1956\u201372 [BE:\n697]; 1959 [BE: 415, 475]).\n\nAnother question that receives such a reformulation is that of the\nexistence of abstract entities, which, according to Church, are\n\u201cpostulated\u201d as ontological commitments of a true sentence\nor theory that has been developed in accordance with the strictures of\nthe logistic method. The basic idea is that theory \\(T\\) is\nontologically committed to entities of kind \\(K\\) if the truth of\n\\(T\\) implies that there are \\(K\\)s (1958a). Moreover, as Church\nclarified later, \u201ctheory\u201d was intended to encompass not\nonly formal theories but also\n\n\nsystems of notions which arose long before scientific method came to\nbe consciously used and which have therefore become embedded matters\nof \u201ccommon sense\u201d in the natural languages (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nThis would suggest that numbers were postulated when notations for\nthem first entered human culture\u2014long before the advent of\nmodern science and the discovery of the logistic method. (For an\nexample of how natural numbers have become embedded in natural\nlanguage, see the discussion of \u201cdescendant\u201d in\n supplement D.)\n Presumably, however, according to the logistic method, such notations\nmust ultimately be included in a formalized object language to which\nthe criterion of ontological commitment is then applied. Further,\ngiven this commitment:\n\n\nIf [the philosopher] maintains, for example, that numbers do not exist\nbut nevertheless asserts, or is persuaded to admit, \u201c1729 is the\nsum of two cubes in more than one way\u201d, he is, at least\nprima facie, involved in contradiction, because by naming the\nnumber 1729 and attributing a property to it he seems to be committed\nto the existence of at least this one number. (1958a [BE: 438])\n\n\nMore generally,\n\n\nthose philosophers who speak of \u201cexistence\u201d,\n\u201creality\u201d, and the like are to be understood as meaning\nthe existential quantifier, and are to be condemned as inconsistent if\non this basis inconsistency appears in their writings. The\njustification is that no other reasonable meaning of\n\u201cexistence\u201d has ever been provided (which would fit into\ncontexts of the kind that were quoted), and the burden of providing\nsuch a second meaning of \u201cexistence\u201d rests on those whose\nwritings or whose philosophical views require it. (1958a [BE:\n442]).\n\n\nRecently, Jody Azzouni (2004, 2010) has attempted to shoulder this\nburden. For discussion of nominalism and Church\u2019s criterion see\nChurch (1958a,b), Burgess (2001) as well as Salm\u00f3n (2020).\n",
