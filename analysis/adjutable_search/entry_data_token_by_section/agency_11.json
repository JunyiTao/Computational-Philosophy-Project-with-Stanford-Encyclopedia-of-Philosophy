    "main_text": "The metaphysics of agency || Actions, events, processes, and omissions\n3.4 Actions, events, processes, and omissions\nWe now turn, in brief, to some further issues in the metaphysics of\nagency. The first concerns the individuation of actions. You flick the\nswitch, turn on the light, illuminate the room, and you thereby also\nalert the burglar. How many actions do you perform? According\nto coarse-grained (or minimizing) views on the individuation\nof actions, you perform one action under different descriptions\n(Anscombe 1957; Davidson 1963). According to fine-grained (or\nmaximizing) views, how many actions you perform depends on how many\nact-properties are instantiated. If you instantiate four\nact-properties, then you perform four distinct actions (Goldman 1970;\nsee also Ginet 1990). According to a third alternative, actions can\nhave other actions as their components or parts (Thalberg 1977; Ginet\n1990). According to all three views, actions are events, and the\nindividuation of actions derives from different views on the\nindividuation of events (see the entry on\nevents). Not much work has been done on this recently (see, however, En\u00e7\n2003: Ch. 3). This is partly because it is now widely agreed that the\nindividuation of actions has little or no bearing on other issues. To\nillustrate, the question of whether agency is to be explained within\nan event-causal or an agent-causal framework bears directly on various\nissues in the debate on free will and moral responsibility (see the\nentry on\nfree will). But event-causal and agent-causal theories are both compatible with\ncoarse-grained and fine-grained views on the individuation of actions.\nSimilarly, it seems that the views on the individuation of actions\nhave no substantial bearing on the question of whether or not reason\nexplanations are causal explanations.\nA related issue is whether actions are to be identified with\nthe outcomes of causal processes or with\nthe processes themselves. According to most versions of\nevent-causal and agent-causal theories, an action is an event that is\ncaused in the right way: the action is identical with or constituted\nby the outcome of that process.[19] According to process views, the action\nis either identical with or constituted by that process (Searle 1983;\nDretske 1988; Wu 2011; see also Thompson 2008). This issue has also not\nreceived much attention. Again, this is mainly because it is widely\nassumed that this issue has little or no substantial bearing on more\nfundamental issues in the metaphysics of agency and on debates\noutside the philosophy of\naction.[20]\nAnother issue in the metaphysics of agency that has received more\nattention in the recent debate is the nature of omissions (in\nparticular, intentional omissions). According to Sartorio (2009), an\nintentional omission is the absence of an action that is caused by the\nabsence of an intention. She argues, on the basis of this account,\nthat intentional omissions cannot be accommodated easily by the\nstandard theory. In reply, Clarke (2010a) has argued that in cases of\nintentional omission the agent usually does have an intention not to\nact that plays an important causal role, and he has identified various\nparallels between intentional actions and intentional omissions. On\nhis view, there are no major obstacles to an account of intentional\nomissions that is compatible and continuous with the standard theory\nof intentional action. Further, he argues that a failure to account\nfor intentional omissions would not obviously be a shortcoming of a\ntheory of intentional action. There are, after all, significant\ndifferences between actions and omissions, and so we should not expect\nthat a theory of action provides all the resources that are required\nfor an account of omissions.
