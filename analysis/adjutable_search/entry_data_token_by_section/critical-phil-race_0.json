    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nModern European philosophers played a key role in the development of\nthe concept of race as a way to characterize, and rank, differences\namong human groups (Bernasconi 2018; Valls 2005; Ward and Lott 2002;\nBernasconi and Lott 2000). Philosophers in the modern era (roughly from\n1600 to 1900) often disagreed on the nature of race, the source of\nracial differences, and the correlations between race and non-physical\ncharacteristics. Kant, Rousseau and Mill, for example, disagreed over\nthe critical issue of whether racial differences were mutable (Kant\n2012; Elden and Mendieta 2011; Boxill 2005). Defining race in terms of\nunderlying biological features emerged well after the language of race\nhad become familiar. The biology of race continues to elicit\ncontroversy over whether it has explanatory value (Kitcher 2007;\nSpencer 2015, \n; Glasgow et al. 2019).\n\nThe Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) developed in large part as a\ncritique of modern ideas and approaches to both race and proffered\nsolutions to racism. In this, CPR was influenced by the late 20th\ncentury developments of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) and Critical Race\nTheory (CRT) (Unger 2015; Delgado 1995; Delgado and Stefancic 1997;\nEssed and Goldberg 2002). CLS and CRT were motivated to go beyond\nquestions of formal equality and de jure discrimination to\nconsider the subtle and broad reach of racist ideas and practices\nthroughout social life and institutions, arguing, for example, that\nnorms of neutrality in legal interpretation or reasoning often\nconcealed structural racism.\n\nWhile borrowing from CLS and CRT, CPR\u2019s distinctive\nphilosophical interests concern the role racialization plays in\nembodiment, subjectivity, identity formation as well as formations of\npower and the establishment of meaning. In order to reach beyond\nEurocentric philosophical resources CPR has drawn from anti-colonial\nwritings as well as critical work in sociology, history, psychology and\nother fields that have addressed the topic of race and racism more\nthoroughly than philosophy (e.g. Mallon and Kelly 2012; Steele 2011;\nFeagin 2013; Horne 2020).\n",
