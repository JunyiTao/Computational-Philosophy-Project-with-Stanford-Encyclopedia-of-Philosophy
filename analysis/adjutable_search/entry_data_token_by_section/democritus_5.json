Indivisibility and Mathematics\n\nThe reasons for supposing that there are indivisible magnitudes\napparently stem from Zeno of Elea\u2019s account of paradoxes that arise if\nextension is understood to be infinitely divisible, i.e. composed of\nan infinite number of parts. The atomists may have sought to avoid\nthese paradoxes by supposing that there is a limit to\ndivisibility.\n\nIt is not clear, however, in what sense the atoms are said to be\nindivisible, and how the need for smallest magnitudes is related to\nthe claim that atoms are indivisible. Furley suggests that the\natomists may not have distinguished between physical and theoretical\nindivisibility of the atoms (Furley 1967, p. 94). The physical\nindivisibility of the atoms seems to be independent of the argument\nfor indivisible magnitudes, since the solidity of atoms\u2014the fact\nthat there is no void within them\u2014is said to be the reason why\nthey cannot be split. The existence of void space between\natoms is cited as the reason why they can be separated: one late\nsource, Philoponus, even suggests that atoms could never actually\ntouch, lest they fuse (DK 67A7). Whether or not Democritus himself saw\nthis consequence, it seems that atoms are taken to be indivisible\nwhatever their size. Presumably, though, there is a smallest size of\natom, and this is thought to be enough to avoid the paradoxes of\ninfinite divisibility.\n\nA reductio ad absurdum argument reported by Aristotle\nsuggests that the atomists argued from the assumption that, if a\nmagnitude is infinitely divisible, nothing prevents it actually having\nbeen divided at every point. The atomist then asks what would remain:\nif the answer is some extended particles, such as dust, then the\nhypothesized division has not yet been completed. If the answer is\nnothing or points, then the question is how an extended magnitude\ncould be composed from what does not have extension (DK 68A48b,\n123). \n\nDemocritus is also said to have contributed to mathematics, and to\nhave posed a problem about the nature of the cone. He argues that if a\ncone is sliced anywhere parallel to its base, the two faces thus\nproduced must either be the same in size or different. If they are the\nsame, however, the cone would seem to be a cylinder; but if they are\ndifferent, the cone would turn out to have step-like rather than\ncontinuous sides. Although it is not clear from Plutarch\u2019s report how\n(or if) Democritus solved the problem, it does seem that he was\nconscious of questions about the relationship between atomism as a\nphysical theory and the nature of mathematical objects.\n",
