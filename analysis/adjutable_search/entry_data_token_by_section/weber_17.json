    "main_text": "Politics and Ethics || Conviction and Responsibility\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nSeen this way, we find a remarkable consistency in Weber\u2019s\nthought. Weber\u2019s main problematic turned on the question of\nindividual autonomy and freedom in an increasingly rationalized\nsociety. His dystopian and pessimistic assessment of rationalization\ndrove him to search for solutions through politics and science, which\nbroadly converge on a certain practice of the self. What he\ncalled the \u201cperson of vocation,\u201d first outlined famously\nin The Protestant Ethic, provided a bedrock for his various\nefforts to resuscitate a character who can willfully combine\nunflinching conviction and methodical rationality even in a society\nbesieged by bureaucratic petrification and value fragmentation. It is\nalso in this entrenched preoccupation with an ethical characterology\nunder modern circumstances that we find the source of his enduring\ninfluences on twentieth-century political and social thought.\n\nOn the left, Weber\u2019s articulation of the tension between\nmodernity and modernization found resounding echoes in the\n\u201cDialectics of Enlightenment\u201d thesis by Theodor Adorno and\nMax Horkheimer; Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s own critique of the perversion\nof capitalist reason owes no less to Weber\u2019s problematization of\ninstrumental rationality on which is also built Habermas\u2019s\nelaboration of communicative rationality as an alternative. Different\nelements in Weber\u2019s political thought, e.g., intense political\nstruggle as an antidote to modern bureaucratic petrification,\nleadership democracy and plebiscitary presidency, stark realist\noutlook on democracy and power-politics, and value-freedom and\nvalue-relativism in political ethics, were selected and critically\nappropriated by such diverse thinkers on the right as Carl Schmitt,\nJoseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron.\nEven the postmodernist project of deconstructing the Enlightenment\nsubjectivity finds, as Michel Foucault does, a precursor in Weber. All\nin all, across the vastly different ideological and methodological\nspectrum, Max Weber\u2019s thought will continue to be a deep\nreservoir of fresh inspiration as long as an individual\u2019s fate\nunder (post)modern circumstances does not lose its privileged place in\nthe political, social, cultural, and philosophical reflections of our\ntime.\n",
