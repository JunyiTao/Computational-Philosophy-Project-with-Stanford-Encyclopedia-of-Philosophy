    "main_text": "Background || Gentzen-style proof theory: Reduction, normalization, cut elimination\n1.3 Gentzen-style proof theory: Reduction, normalization, cut elimination\n\nGentzen\u2019s calculus of natural deduction and its rendering by\nPrawitz is the background to most approaches to proof-theoretic\nsemantics. Natural deduction is based on at least three central\nideas:\n\nDischarge of assumptions: Assumptions can be\n\u201cdischarged\u201d or \u201celiminated\u201d in the course of\na derivation, so the central notion of natural deduction is that of a\nderivation depending on assumptions.\nSeparation: Each primitive rule schema\ncontains only a single logical constant.\nIntroductions and eliminations: The rules for\nlogical constants come in pairs. The introduction rule(s) allow(s) one\nto infer a formula with the constant in question as its main operator,\nthe elimination rule(s) permit(s) to draw consequences from such a\nformula.\n\n\nIn Gentzen\u2019s natural deduction system for first-order logic\nderivations are written in tree form and based on the well-known\nrules. For example, implication has the following introduction and\nelimination rules \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$[A]$}\n\\noLine\n\\UnaryInfC{$B$}\n\\RightLabel{$\\,\\to$I}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A\\to B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\n\\hspace{6em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A\\to B$}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\RightLabel{$\\,\\to$E}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the brackets indicate the possibility to discharge occurrences\nof the assumption \\(A\\). The open assumptions of a derivation\nare those assumptions on which the end-formula depends. A derivation\nis called closed, if it has no open assumption, otherwise it\nis called open. If we deal with quantifiers, we have to\nconsider open individual variables (sometimes called\n\u201cparameters\u201d), too. Metalogical features crucial for\nproof-theoretic semantics and for the first time systematically\ninvestigated and published by Prawitz (1965) include:\n\nReduction: For every detour consisting of an introduction\nimmediately followed by an elimination there is a reduction step\nremoving this detour.\n\nNormalization: By successive applications of reductions,\nderivations can be transformed into normal forms which contain no\ndetours.\n\nFor implication the standard reduction step removing detours is the\nfollowing: \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$[A]$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$\\vdots$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A\\to B$}\n\\AxiomC{$|$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1em}\n\\text{reduces to}\n\\hspace{1em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$|$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$\\vdots$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nA simple, but very important corollary of normalization is the\nfollowing: Every closed derivation in intuitionistic logic can be\nreduced to a derivation using an introduction rule in the last\nstep. We also say that intuitionistic natural deduction satisfies\nthe \u201cintroduction form property\u201d. In\nproof-theoretic semantics this result figures prominently under the\nheading \u201cfundamental assumption\u201d (Dummett, 1991, p. 254).\nThe \u201cfundamental assumption\u201d is a typical example of a\nphilosophical re-interpretation of a technical proof-theoretic\nresult.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor the general orientation of proof-theoretic semantics, see\nthe special issue of Synthese edited by Kahle and\nSchroeder-Heister (2006), the reader edited by Piecha and\nSchroeder-Heister (2016b), the textbook by Francez (2015), and the\nsurveys by Wansing (2000) and by Schroeder-Heister (2016).\n\nFor the philosophical position and development of proof\ntheory, see the entry on\n Hilbert\u2019s program,\n the entry on the\n development of proof theory\n as well as Prawitz (1971).\n\nFor intuitionism, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic,\n the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics\n and the entry on the\n development of intuitionistic logic.\n\nFor anti-realism, see the entry on\n challenges to metaphysical realism\n as well as Tennant (1987; 1997) and Tranchini (2010; 2012a).\n\nFor Gentzen-style proof-theory and the theory of natural\ndeduction, see the entry on\n natural deduction systems in logic\n as well as, in addition to Gentzen\u2019s (1934/35) original\npresentation, Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s (1934) theory of suppositions,\nPrawitz\u2019s (1965) classical monograph, Tennant (1978; 2017),\nTroelstra and Schwichtenberg (2000), Negri and von Plato (2001),\nMancosu, Galvan and Zach (2021), and Andrzej Indrzejczak\u2019s entry\non\n natural deduction in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. \n\n",
