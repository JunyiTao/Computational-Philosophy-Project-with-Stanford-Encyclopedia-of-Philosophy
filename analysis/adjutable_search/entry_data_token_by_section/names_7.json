First, something (we haven\u2019t seen what)\nestablishes that \u201cbachelor\u201d means man who has never\nbeen married. Second, \u201cbachelor\u201d applies to all and\nonly those things that satisfy the condition specified in its\nmeaning\u2014the men who have never been married. If names have\nmeanings, then their referents or ranges (in the case of generic\nnames) will be determined in the same way. However, many philosophers\nhave found the view that names do not have a meaning intuitively\ncompelling (Mill 1843: 34, 36\u201337; Strawson 1950; Ziff 1960:\n85\u201389, 93\u201394; Marcus 1961). They still believe names\nrefer, and so require an alternative metasemantics\u2014an account,\nin this case, of what determines reference\u2014to the\nmeaning-mediated one.\n\nThe now standard alternative to the meaning-mediated model is one on\nwhich reference (or range) is directly established by use.\nThe referent is the referent (or the range the range) because it\nsatisfies a particular condition, but that condition amounts to\nconsistency with past use, rather than encapsulating the meaning of\nthe expression. Proponents of the use model tend to emphasize the\nexternalism of this determining use. For\nexample, in the quote below, Evans elaborates the rough idea of the\nreferent being known as NN by citing the \u201cactual\npattern of dealings\u201d with the referent\u2014by which he means\nspecifically the occasions where the referent has been identified as\nNN by certain members of the community (the \u201cproducers\u201d of\nthe particular name-using practice)\u2014rather than basing it on the\nrecognitional capacities that enable the identification (which would\nhew closer to Strawson).\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that what makes it the case that an\nordinary proper-name-using practice involving the name\n\u201cNN\u201d concerns a particular individual is that that\nindividual should be known to the producers in the practice as\nNN. It is the actual pattern of dealings the producers have had\nwith an individual\u2014identified from time to time by the exercise\nof their recognitional capacities in regard to that\nindividual\u2014which ties the name to the individual. (Evans 1982:\n382, emphasis in the original)\n\n\nWe will now look, in a general way, at how the reference of a name\ncould be determined by other aspects of its use. Our approach will\nsingle out attribution (of a name to someone)\nas the relevant basis. Other approaches are possible, but the\n(technical) notion of attribution will be broad enough to cover the\nuse theories of Evans and Kripke.\n\nTo refer is to use an expression to identify some individual, usually\nin order to talk about them. Attribution of a name, by contrast,\nrequires the attributee to be identified (at least partially)\nindependently of the deployment of the name. To attribute a name to\nsomeone is just to treat someone\u2014thus extrinsically\nidentified\u2014as belonging to its extension; to assert or\npresuppose that the name applies to them. A straightforward example,\nwhere the attributee is identified by a gesture (or her proximity),\nwould be:\n\n(5) This is\nMiranda.\n\n\nOthers include vocative address (\u201cHello, Miranda!\u201d), where\nthe name is attributed to the addressee, and stipulation (\u201cLet\nthis one be Zappa\u201d). Constructions with appellative verbs like\n\u201ccall\u201d are tailor-made for name attribution (\u201cCall\nme Ishmael\u201d), but attribution may also be discerned in the\nbackground of a more casual kind of utterance. Even \u201cHomer was a\nmaster of narrative\u201d could be seen to presuppose an attribution\nof \u201cHomer\u201d to the author of certain narrative works (Evans\n1982: 394\u2013395).\n\nAttributions can be to individuals identified by description\nas well as by acquaintance. As we will see, Evans restricts\ncanonical applications by fiat to the by-acquaintance variety, while\nKripke seems to allow both sorts (1980: 94).\n\nThe main tenet of the use theory, as we will understand it, is that an\nutterance of a name is constrained in its reference by a set of prior\napplications. Assuming, for the moment, that the applications in that\nset were all to one individual (the same one was independently\nidentified in each case), then the utterance is simply constrained to\nrefer to that individual (in order, as we might put it, to be\nconsistent with those past applications). The use theory in outline is\nalmost the same as Strawson\u2019s view that the reference of a name\nis determined by the identifying descriptions associated with it in\nthe minds of its users, except that it replaces users\u2019\ndispositions to identify the referent of a name in a certain way with\ntheir public acts of committing to particular identifications.\n\nAnother difference exhibited by the use theories of Kripke and Evans\nis their flight from Strawson\u2019s democratic approach to\nidentification (Kripke 1980: 65). Both philosophers distinguish a\nproper subset of the applications of a name as canonical for\ndetermining its reference (see also Putnam 1975).\n\nIndeed, only one attribution is authoritative on the picture Kripke\noffers: an inaugurating stipulation that tyrannically governs all\nsubsequent use. The paradigm of this initiating act is the naming\nceremony, where a name is officially conferred on a person or thing.\nSince no subsequent attribution can alter the reference of downstream\nuse, Kripke\u2019s account makes no allowance for reference change\n(each \u201cchange\u201d in fact requires the institution of a new\nspecific name, with a new inaugural event).\n\nEvans loosens Kripke\u2019s restriction to allow for the influence of\nsubsequent attributions, and hence makes it possible to model change\nin the reference of a name. On his account, the authoritative\napplications are those of the (current) \u201cproducers\u201d of a\nname-using practice\u2014those in a position to make identifications\nbased on direct acquaintance, as they are capable of recognizing the\nindividual to which they attribute the name (Evans 1982:\n376\u2013377). Those who are not producers\u2014the\nconsumers\u2014have a more limited role in the practice. While they\ncan use the name to refer to the relevant individual, their own\nattributions need not be consistent with its reference.\n\nStandard use theories provide vague guidelines for selecting the set\nof historical attributions (the \u201cprecedent\u201d) that\nconstrains the reference of a particular utterance. For Kripke,\nselection involves tracing back the (intentionally mediated)\nhistorical chain from the utterance to an initial naming ceremony. For\nEvans it requires resolving the utterance to its proper name-using\npractice (a process he conceives of on the model of lexical\ndisambiguation), and then sifting out the attributions of the\nproducers in that practice.\n\nIt follows that Kripke is committed to the coreference of\n(appropriately) historically connected name-utterances, while Evans is\ncommitted to the coreference of all (simultaneous) utterances\nbelonging to the one practice. It is worth noting that a use theory\nneed not carry either of these commitments. We might instead,\nfollowing Donnellan (1974: 16), take the relevant applications to be\nthose that contribute to the historically correct explanation of the\nutterance in question. Since the same speaker, manifestly intending to\ncontribute to the same name-using practice, might utter the same name\nin pursuit of different goals, and hence with differing overall\nexplanations for each of their utterances, Donnellan\u2019s account\ndoes not carry the constraints of the other theories (for some pros\nand cons, see Donnellan 1970: 349\u2013351 and Evans 1973: 202).\n\nIf the precedent consists of more than one attribution, the theory\nadditionally needs some way to resolve conflicts\u2014cases where one\nattribution is to x, while another is to y. We could say\nthat any conflict in the precedent results in either reference failure\n(Evans 1982: 389) or referential indeterminacy (Lewis 1984). But we\ncan also imagine a more nuanced rule that prioritized certain\nproperties in the event of a conflict (the way Evans prioritizes the\napplications of producers over those of consumers).\n\nIn sum, the general framework for a use theory has it that a set of\nattributions P provides a constraint on the reference of an\nutterance u of a name (the theory may provide a means of\ndetermining P from u and its circumstances, or, at the\nextreme of relativism, will only say that reference is dependent on a\nchoice of precedent P). Each element \\(P_i\\) of P\ncontributes a general descriptive or situational feature that serves\nto identify the subject of the application (think of each \\(P_i\\) as a\nproperty, applied at the world of utterance). Additionally, the use\ntheory may specify a priority relation on P (or other means of\nresolving conflicts). The result is a condition (we can call it\n\\(C(u)\\) if we assume that an utterance u determines this\ncondition, by determining its proper precedent) that specifies the\nconstraint on the reference of the utterance required by consistency\nwith its proper precedent of attributions.\n",
