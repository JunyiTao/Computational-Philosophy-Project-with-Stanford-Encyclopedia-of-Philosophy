    "main_text": "Four schools || Predicativism\n2.4 Predicativism\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, predicativism is not ordinarily described as\none of the schools. But it is only for contingent reasons that before\nthe advent of the second world war predicativism did not rise to the\nlevel of prominence of the other schools.\n\nThe origin of predicativism lies in the work of Russell. On a cue of\nPoincar\u00e9, he arrived at the following diagnosis of the Russell\nparadox. The argument of the Russell paradox defines the collection C\nof all mathematical entities that satisfy \\(\\neg x\\in x\\). The\nargument then proceeds by asking whether C itself meets this\ncondition, and derives a contradiction.\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9-Russell diagnosis of this argument states that\nthis definition does not pick out a collection at all: it is\nimpossible to define a collection S by a condition that implicitly\nrefers to S itself. This is called the vicious circle\nprinciple. Definitions that violate the vicious circle principle\nare called impredicative. A sound definition of a collection\nonly refers to entities that exist independently from the defined\ncollection. Such definitions are called predicative. As\nG\u00f6del later pointed out, a platonist would find this line of\nreasoning unconvincing. If mathematical collections exist\nindependently of the act of defining, then it is not immediately clear\nwhy there could not be collections that can only be defined\nimpredicatively (G\u00f6del 1944).\n\nAll this led Russell to develop the simple and the ramified theory of\ntypes, in which syntactical restrictions were built in that make\nimpredicative definitions ill-formed. In simple type theory, the free\nvariables in defining formulas range over entities to which the\ncollection to be defined do not belong. In ramified type theory, it is\nrequired in addition that the range of the bound variables in defining\nformulas do not include the collection to be defined. It was pointed\nout in\n section 2.1\n that Russell\u2019s type theory cannot be seen as a reduction of\nmathematics to logic. But even aside from that, it was observed early\non that especially in ramified type theory it is too cumbersome to\nformalize ordinary mathematical arguments.\n\nWhen Russell turned to other areas of analytical philosophy, Hermann\nWeyl took up the predicativist cause (Weyl 1918). Like\nPoincar\u00e9, Weyl did not share Russell\u2019s desire to reduce\nmathematics to logic. And right from the start he saw that it would be\nin practice impossible to work in a ramified type theory. Weyl\ndeveloped a philosophical stance that is in a sense intermediate\nbetween intuitionism and platonism. He took the collection of natural\nnumbers as unproblematically given. But the concept of an arbitrary\nsubset of the natural numbers was not taken to be immediately given in\nmathematical intuition. Only those subsets which are determined by\narithmetical (i.e., first-order) predicates are taken to be\npredicatively acceptable.\n\nOn the one hand, it emerged that many of the standard definitions in\nmathematical analysis are impredicative. For instance, the minimal\nclosure of an operation on a set is ordinarily defined as the\nintersection of all sets that are closed under applications of the\noperation. But the minimal closure itself is one of the sets that are\nclosed under applications of the operation. Thus, the definition is\nimpredicative. In this way, attention gradually shifted away from\nconcern about the set-theoretical paradoxes to the role of\nimpredicativity in mainstream mathematics. On the other hand, Weyl\nshowed that it is often possible to bypass impredicative notions. It\neven emerged that most of mainstream nineteenth century mathematical\nanalysis can be vindicated on a predicative basis (Feferman 1988).\n\nIn the 1920s, History intervened. Weyl was won over to Brouwer\u2019s\nmore radical intuitionistic project. In the meantime, mathematicians\nbecame convinced that the highly impredicative transfinite set theory\ndeveloped by Cantor and Zermelo was less acutely threatened by\nRussell\u2019s paradox than previously suspected. These factors\ncaused predicativism to lapse into a dormant state for several\ndecades.\n\nBuilding on work in generalized recursion theory, Solomon Feferman\nextended the predicativist project in the 1960s (Feferman 2005). He\nrealized that Weyl\u2019s strategy could be iterated into the\ntransfinite. Also those sets of numbers that can be defined by using\nquantification over the sets that Weyl regarded as predicatively\njustified, should be counted as predicatively acceptable, and so on.\nThis process can be propagated along an ordinal path. This ordinal\npath stretches as far into the transfinite as the predicative\nordinals reach, where an ordinal is predicative if it measures\nthe length of a provable well-ordering of the natural numbers. This\ncalibration of the strength of predicative mathematics, which is due\nto Feferman and (independently) Sch\u00fctte, is nowadays fairly\ngenerally accepted. Feferman then investigated how much of standard\nmathematical analysis can be carried out within a predicativist\nframework. The research of Feferman and others (most notably Harvey\nFriedman) shows that most of twentieth century analysis is acceptable\nfrom a predicativist point of view. But it is also clear that not all\nof contemporary mathematics that is generally accepted by the\nmathematical community is acceptable from a predicativist standpoint:\ntransfinite set theory is a case in point.\n",
