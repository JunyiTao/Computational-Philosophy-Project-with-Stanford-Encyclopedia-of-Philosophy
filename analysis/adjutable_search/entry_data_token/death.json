This topic arises\nbecause to die is roughly to lose one\u2019s life.\n\nThe second topic is the nature of death, and how it bears on\nthe persistence of organisms and persons.\n\nThe third topic is the harm thesis, the claim that\ndeath can harm the individual who dies. Perhaps the most influential\ncase against the harm thesis was made by Epicurus. His argument is\ndiscussed, as is a contemporary response, the deprivationist defense\nof the harm thesis.\n\nThe fourth topic is a question that seems to confront\nproponents of the harm thesis, especially those who offer some version\nof the deprivationist defense: if a person is harmed by her death, at\nwhat time does her death make her worse off than she otherwise would\nbe? Some answers are considered.\n\nFifth is further issues that may lead us to doubt the harm\nthesis. One is a further question about deprivationism: we are not\nalways harmed by what deprives us of things; what makes some of these\nworrisome and not others? Next is a question concerning the fact that\nthere are two different directions in which our lives could be\nextended: into the past (our lives could have been longer if they\nbegan earlier), or into the future (they could have been longer if\nthey ended later). Assuming the former does not matter to us, why\nshould the latter?\n\nThe sixth topic concerns events that occur after a person has\ndied: is it possible for these events to harm her?\n\nSeventh is a controversy concerning whether extreme long\nlife, even immortality, would be good for us. Of particular interest\nhere is a dispute between Thomas Nagel, who says that death is an evil\nwhenever it comes, and Bernard Williams, who argues that, while\npremature death is a misfortune, it is a good thing that we are not\nimmortal, since we cannot continue to have our current characters and\nremain meaningfully attached to life forever.\n\nA final controversy concerns whether or not the harmfulness\nof death can be reduced. It may be that, by adjusting our conception\nof our well-being, and by altering our attitudes, we can reduce or\neliminate the threat death poses us. But there is a case to be made\nthat such efforts backfire if taken to extremes.\n", "toc": [{"#Lif": "1.

Life\n\nTo die is to cease to be alive. To clarify death further, then, we\nwill need to say a bit about the nature of life.\n\nSome theorists have said that life is a substance of some sort. A more\nplausible view is that life is a property of some sort, but we should\nalso consider the possibility that lives are events. If we say that\nlives are events, we will want to know something about how to\ndistinguish them from other events, and how they are related to the\nindividuals that are alive. It would also be useful to know the\npersistence conditions for a life. If instead we conclude that life\n(or alive) is a property, we will want to clarify it, and\nidentify what sorts of things bear it. Let us briefly discuss each of\nthese views\u2014that life is a substance, a property, or an event.\n\n1.1 Life as a Substance\n\nWe can deal quickly with the view called \u2018vitalism\u2019\n(defended by Hans Driesch, 1908 and 1914, among others), which holds\nthat being alive consists in containing some special substance called\n\u2018life.\u2019 Vitalism is a nonstarter since it is unclear what\nsort of stuff vitalists take life to be, and because no likely\ncandidates\u2014no special stuff found in all and only in living\nthings\u2014have been detected. Moreover, vitalism faces a further\ndifficulty, which Fred Feldman calls \u2018the Jonah Problem\u2019:\na dead thing, such as a whale, may have a living thing, say Jonah,\ninside it; if Jonah has \u2018life\u2019 inside him, then so does\nthe whale, but by hypothesis the whale is not alive. Of course, in\nthis example Jonah is in the whale\u2019s stomach, not in its cells,\nbut the difficulty cannot be solved by saying that an object is alive\nif and only if it has \u2018life\u2019 in its cells, as an\ninfectious agent (organisms with \u2018life\u2019 in them) could\nsurvive, for a time, within the dead cells of a dead whale.\n1.2 Life as an Event\n\nAs Jay Rosenberg noted (1983, p. 22, 103), sometimes when we speak of\na life we mean to refer to the events that make up something\u2019s\nhistory\u2014the things that it did and the things that happened to\nit. (For example, the publication of The Problems of\nPhilosophy was one of the events that made up one life, namely\nBertrand Russell\u2019s.) Yet a rock and a corpse have histories, and\nneither has a life. Presumably, then, \u2018a life,\u2019 in the\nsense we are discussing, refers to the history of something that is\nalive. In that case what we are really looking for is clarification of\na property, not an event. We want clarification of what it is to be\nalive.\n\nAccording to a second theorist, Peter van Inwagen, while a life is\nindeed an event, it is not the history of something.\n\u201c\u2018Russell\u2019s life,\u2019\u201d van Inwagen writes\n(1990, p. 83), \u201cdenotes a purely biological event, an event\nwhich took place entirely inside Russell\u2019s skin and which went\non for ninety-seven years.\u201d Russell\u2019s life included the\noxygenation of his hemoglobin molecules but not the publication of his\nbooks.\n\nIf lives are biological events, it would be useful to know more about\nwhat they are, how they are individuated, and what their persistence\nconditions are. Van Inwagen declines to provide these details (1990,\np. 145). He assumes that (the events he calls) lives are familiar\nenough to us that we can pick them out. But he does make the useful\ncomment that each such event is constituted by certain self-organizing\nactivities in which some molecules engage, and that it is analogous to\na parade, which is an event constituted by certain marching-related\nactivities of some people. Having taken the notion of a life for\ngranted, he draws upon it in his account of organisms. On his view\n(1990, p. 90), some things compose an organism if and only if their\nactivity constitutes a life.\n1.3 Life as a Property\n\nMany theorists have defended the view that life, or (being) alive, is\na property, but there is considerable disagreement among them about\nwhat precisely that property is. The main views on offer are\nlife-functionalist accounts and accounts that analyze life in terms of\nDNA or genetic information or evolution by natural selection.\n\nLife-functionalism, a view introduced by Aristotle, analyzes the\nproperty alive in terms of one or more salient functions that\nliving things typically are able to perform. The salient functions\nAristotle listed were nutrition, reproduction, sensation, autonomous\nmotion, and thought. However, life-functionists disagree about how to\nformulate their account and about which functions are salient. Take\nAristotle\u2019s list. Obviously, it would be a mistake to say that\nsomething is alive if and only if it can perform all of the functions\non the list. Might we say that, for something to be alive, it\nsuffices that it be capable of one or more of the listed\nfunctions? Is being capable of one of these functions in\nparticular necessary for something to be alive? As Fred\nFeldman points out, neither of the suggestions just mentioned is\nacceptable.  Devices such as Roomba cleaning robots can do one of\nAristotle\u2019s functions, namely move themselves, but are not\nalive, so being able to do at least one listed function does not\nsuffice for being alive. Nor is it plausible to say that any one on\nthe list is necessary for being alive.  Which on the list would this\nnecessary function be?  Perhaps nutrition?  Adult silk moths are alive\nbut lack a digestive system, so are incapable of nutrition. And, as\nmany theorists have noticed, many living things cannot reproduce;\nexamples include organisms whose reproductive organs are damaged and\nhybrid animals such as mules.\n\nWhat, now, about accounts that analyze life in terms of genetic\ninformation? Feldman thinks that something like the Jonah problem\narises for any account according which being alive consists in\ncontaining DNA or other genetic information, as dead organisms contain\nDNA. A further problem for such views is that it is conceivable there\nare or could be life forms (say on other planets) that are not based\non genetic information. This latter difficulty can be avoided if we\nsay that being alive consists in having the ability to evolve, to\nengage in Darwinian evolution, assuming that evolution by natural\nselection is possible for living things that lack nucleic acid. We\nmight adopt NASA\u2019s definition, according to which life is\n\u201ca self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian\nevolution.\u201d However, accounts like NASA\u2019s are implausible\nfor a further reason: while the ability to evolve by natural selection\nis something that collections of organisms\u2014species\u2014may or\nmay not have, it is not a feature an individual organism may have.\nLater members of a species come to have features earlier members\nlacked; some of these new features may make survival more or less\nlikely, and the less \u2018fit\u2019 are weeded out of existence. An\nindividual organism, such as a particular dog, cannot undergo this\nprocess. Yet individuals may be alive.\n\nBecause he has encountered no successful account of life, no account\nexempt from counterexamples, Feldman concludes that \u201clife is a\nmystery\u201d (p. 55). Despite his skepticism, however, there is a\ngood case to be made for saying that what distinguishes objects that\nare alive from objects that are not is that the latter have a\ndistinctive sort of control over what composes them, which the former\nlack. Let us see if we can make this claim clearer.\n\nConsider ordinary composite material objects that are not alive. We\ncan assume that, at a given time, these are made up of, or composed\nof, more simple things, such as molecules, by virtue of the fact that\nthe latter meet various conditions. Among the conditions is the\nrequirement that (in some sense in need of clarification) they be\nbonded together. Take the boulder near my front porch. Among\nthe things that compose it now will be a few molecules, say four\nmolecules near the center of the boulder, that are bonded together, in\nthat each is bonded to the others, directly or indirectly (a molecule,\nA, is indirectly bonded to another molecule, B, if A is\ndirectly bonded to a molecule C that is directly bonded to B, or if A\nis bonded to a molecule that is indirectly bonded to B). The things\nthat make up the boulder are not limited to these four molecules, but\nthey are limited to molecules that are bonded to them. Nor is the\nboulder unique in this way; something similar seems true of any\ncomposite material object. A composite material object is composed of\nsome things at a time only if those things are bonded together at that\ntime.\n\nWhat sort of bonding relationship holds among the things that compose\nmaterial objects? Any answer to this question will be controversial.\nLet us set it aside, and move on to some further assumptions about the\ncomposition of nonliving composite material objects, namely that a\ngreat many of them persist for a while (some persist for a very long\ntime) and that what composes them at one time normally differs from\nwhat composes them at other times. Exactly how this works is a\ncomplicated matter, but among the conditions that such objects must\nmeet if they are to persist is that any change in their composition be\nincremental. (Even this condition is controversial. For more on\nmaterial objects, see the article Material Constitution and Ordinary\nobjects.) Consider the boulder again. Suppose that at one time,\nt0, it is composed of some molecules, and that all\nor most of these molecules remain bonded to each other until a later\ntime t1. Suppose, too, that no or few (few as\ncompared to the number of molecules that composed the boulder at\nt0) molecules come to be newly bonded to these by\nthe time that t1 rolls around. Under these\nconditions the boulder undergoes an incremental change in composition,\nand it seems plausible to say that the boulder remains in existence\nover the interval t0\u2013t1,\nand, at t1, is composed of the molecules that\nremain bonded together with the molecules that are newly attached to\nthem. Presumably, it will also survive a series of such incremental\nchanges in composition. But it will not survive drastic and sudden\nchanges. It would stop existing, for example, if the molecules that\ncompose it were suddenly dispersed.\n\nEnough said about composite material objects that are not alive. Now\nlet us see if we can shed some light on what makes living objects\nspecial. What is it that distinguishes an object that is alive from an\nobject that is not?\n\nThe answer seems to be that, normally, a live object has a distinctive\nsort of control over whether things come to be, or cease to be, part\nof it. The control in question is made possible by activities its\nconstituents themselves are capable of. Contrast objects that are not\nalive, say automobiles. What an ordinary car is composed of is settled\nfor the car by the mechanics who repair it (detaching some\nparts and affixing others), by whether it is involved in an accident\nand loses some parts, and so forth. Imagine a car that is not passive\nin this way. Imagine that its parts were somehow capable of replacing\nsome of themselves with fresh parts, without assistance from outside,\nso that the activities of the parts that compose the car today were\nresponsible for its being composed of certain parts tomorrow. That\nwould make it quite lifelike.\n\nLet us describe, in a bit more detail, what the molecules that compose\nliving objects can do:\n\nWorking together, these molecules can engage in activities that\nare integrated in conformity with (under the control of) the\ninformation that some of them carry (information that is comparable to\nblueprints and instructions), much as soldiers that make up an army\ncan engage in activities that are integrated in conformity with battle\nplans and instructions issued by the commanding officers that are\namong them.\nDeploying these activities, the molecules can self-modify, in the\nsense that they can bond new (perhaps recently ingested) molecules to\nthemselves, or prune (and excrete) some away, combining themselves in\nvarious ways (e.g., constructing cells), thereby giving way to a\nslightly different assembly of molecules at a later time, and fueling\ntheir activities by drawing upon external energy sources or stored\nreserves.\nThe molecules can also pass along their ability to self-modify,\nenabling the molecules to which they give way to continue these\nactivities, thus allowing the object they compose to sustain a given\nform (or forms) over time (say that of a dog) despite the fact that\nwhat composes that object at one time differs from what composes it at\nanother time.\n\n\nThe view on offer\u2014we might call it the compositional\naccount of life\u2014is that an object is composed of things\nthat are capable of the activities just described if and only if it is alive.\n\nThis account of life needs refinement, but it avoids at least most of\nthe worries mentioned earlier. It implies that an object may be alive\neven though it is sterile (as in the case of mules), even though it\nsurvives on stored energy (as in the case of a silk moth), and\nconceivably even if it lacks nucleic acid (yet is still composed of\nthings that engage in activities integrated in conformity with\ninformation they carry). In fact, it implies that being capable of\nnone of the items on Aristotle\u2019s list is necessary nor\nsufficient for being alive. What is more, the compositional account\njust sketched implies that being alive is a property an individual,\nsay the last remaining dodo, may bear on its own, which suggests that\nit may be alive without being capable of Darwinian evolution. At the\nsame time, it explains how collections of live individuals may evolve.\nIndividual objects are alive only if their composition is under the\ncontrol of some of their parts (e.g., nucleic acid molecules) that\ncarry information. The mechanisms by which such information is carried\ntend to be modified over time, altering the information they carry,\nand thus the features of the organisms they help shape, introducing\nmutations that may or may not facilitate survival. (For more on the\nnature of life, see Bedau 2014 and the entry on Life.)\n2. Death\n\nThe previous section discussed the nature of life, thereby clarifying\nwhat it is that death ends. This section discusses the nature of death\nand how death is related to the persistence of organisms and persons.\n(For an excellent discussion of views of death outside of the analytic\ntradition, see Schumacher 2010.) \n2.1 Life and Death\n\nAccording to the compositional account of life discussed in the\nprevious section, objects that are alive have a distinctive capacity\nto control what they are composed of, fixing these constituents\ntogether in various ways, by virtue of the fact that their\nconstituents can engage in various self-modifying activities that are\nintegrated in conformity with information they carry. Let us call\nthese vital activities.\n\nIt is one thing to have the capacity to engage in vital activities and\nanother actually to engage in them, just as there is a difference\nbetween having the ability to run and actually running. Being alive\nseems to involve the former. It consists in having the relevant\ncapacity. To die is to lose this capacity. We can call this the\nloss of life account of death.\n\nThe event by which the capacity to engage in vital activities is lost\nis one thing, and the state of affairs of its having been lost it is\nanother. \u2018Death\u2019 can refer to either. However, the\ncapacity to engage in vital activities may be lost gradually, rather\nthan all at once, so it is reasonable to speak of a process of dying.\nIn some cases that process is especially complicated, because the\nself-modifying activities of some organisms result in the construction\nof complex physiological systems that must remain largely intact for\nthe self-modifying activities of these organisms to remain integrated.\nIn defining death, some theorists focus on these systems, and claim\nthat an organism\u2019s life ends when that organism\u2019s\nphysiological systems can no longer function as an integrated whole,\nor when this loss becomes irreversible (Christopher Belshaw 2009;\nDavid DeGrazia 2014).\n2.2 Death and Suspended Vitality\n\nThe loss of life account of death has been challenged by theorists who\nclaim that things whose vital activities are suspended are not alive\n(Feldman 1992, Christopher Belsaw 2009, Cody Gilmore 2013, and David\nDeGrazia 2014). When zygotes and embryos are frozen for later use in\nthe in vitro fertilization procedure, their vital activities are\nbrought to a stop, or very nearly so. The same goes for water bears\nthat are dehydrated, and for seeds and spores. It seems clear that the\nzygotes and water bears are not dead, since their vital activities can\neasily be restarted\u2014by warming the zygote or by wetting the\nwater bear. They are not dead, but are they alive? If we deny that\nthey are alive, presumably we would do so on the grounds that their\nvital activities are halted. If something\u2019s life can be ended by\nsuspending its vital activities without its dying, then we must reject\nthe loss of life account of death.\n\nHowever, the loss of life account is thoroughly established in\nordinary usage, and is easily reconciled with the possibility of\nsuspended vitality. In denying that frozen embryos are dead, it is\nclear that we mean to emphasize that they have not lost the\ncapacity to deploy their vital activities. When we say that\nsomething is dead, we mean to emphasize that this capacity\nhas been lost. Having used \u2018dead\u2019 to signal this\nloss, why would we want to use the word \u2018alive\u2019 to signal\nthe fact that something is making active use of its vital activities?\nOur best option is to use a pair of contrasting terms. We can use\n\u2018viable\u2019 to indicate that something has the capacity to\ndeploy vital activities and \u2018unviable\u2019 to indicate that it\nhas lost this capacity. When instead we are concerned about whether or\nnot something is engaging its vital activities, we can use different\ncontrasting terms, say \u2018vital\u2019 and \u2018nonvital\u2019,\nthe former to characterize something that is employing its capacity\nfor vital activities and the latter to characterize something that is\nnot making use of its capacity for vital activities. What seems\nrelatively uncontroversial is that being dead consists in unviability.\nTo retain the loss of life account, we have only to add that being\nalive consists in viability. We can then say that a frozen embryo is\nviable and hence alive despite its lack of vitality, and it will die\nif its life ends (it will die if it ceases to be viable). Of course,\nif we are willing to abandon the loss of life account, we could\ninstead use \u2018alive\u2019 to characterize something that is both\nviable and vital. We would then say that a frozen embryo is not alive\n(since it lacks vitality) but also that it is not dead (since it\nremains viable).\n2.3 Being Dead\n\nPeople often speak of being dead as a \u2018state\u2019 or\n\u2018condition\u2019 as opposed to an event or process. They say an\norganism comes to be in this state once it dies. This way of speaking\ncan be puzzling on the assumption that what dies ceases to exist.\n(This assumption is discussed below.) If the assumption is true, then\nan organism that dies stops existing but simultaneously comes to be in\nthe state of death. Mustn\u2019t something exist at a time if it is\n(literally) in some state at that time? But of course it would be\nabsurd to deny that something can truly be dead on the grounds that\ndeath is a state and what does not exist at a time cannot be in any\nstate at that time.\n\nWhy not solve the problem by saying that upon dying an organism leaves\na corpse, and it is the corpse that is in the state of being dead?\nThere are several problems with this suggestion. Some organisms do not\nleave corpses. What corpses are left eventually disintegrate. Whether\nan organism leaves a corpse or not, and whether its corpse exists or\nnot, if that organism dies at time t and does not regain life\nthen it is dead after t.\n\nThe difficulty can be avoided if we say, with Jay Rosenberg 1983, p.\n42), that dead is a relation between an organism, the time it died,\nand a subsequent time, and that when someone asserts, at some given\ntime t, \u2018Socrates is dead,\u2019 what is asserted\n(ignoring the possibility of restored life, discussed in the next\nsection) is roughly that Socrates died before t.\n\nAs is mentioned below, some theorists deny that an object that is at\none time an organism may continue its existence as a corpse. Such\ntheorists will say that organisms and their corpses are two different\nobjects. They may conclude that \u2018dead\u2019 is\nambiguous\u2014that it means one thing as applied to organisms, and\nanother thing as attributed to the corpses organisms leave. In any\ncase, they will need to deny that, as concerns corpses, being dead\nimplies having died, as corpses are never alive, according to them.\nIf, on the other hand, an object that is an organism may continue its\nexistence as a corpse, then, at any time t after that object\ndies, \u2018dead\u2019 applies univocally to it at time t,\nand means roughly died before t.\n2.4 Resurrection\n\nIt will be useful to sharpen the loss of life account if, as seems\nconceivable, it is possible to restore life to something that\nhas died.\n\nRestoration in this sense is quite different from the revival of\nsomething, such as a frozen embryo, whose vital activities have been\nhalted. Something can be revived only if it is\nalive\u2014only if it has the capacity to deploy vital activities, as\nin the case of a frozen zygote. It is revived when it regains\nvitality. Something\u2019s life can be restored only if it\nhas lost its capacity for vital activities. Life is restored when this\ncapacity is regained.\n\nTo bring the possibility of restoration into view, imagine a\nfuturistic device, the Disassembler-Reassembler, that chops\nme into small cubes, or individual cells, or disconnected atoms, which\nit stores and later reassembles just as they were before. It is far\nfrom obvious that I would survive\u2014and that my life would\ncontinue\u2014after Reassembly. (Assuming that I am a material\nobject, the account of objects sketched in Section 1.3 implies that\nchopping me into bits ends my existence forever.) But even if my\nexistence would pick up again after Reassembly occurs, it is quite\nclear that I would not live during intervals when my atoms are stacked\nin storage. I would not even exist during such intervals. If I can be\nReassembled, my life would be restored, not revived. Restoration, not\nrevival, is a way of bringing a creature back from the dead.\n\nNow imagine a Corpse Reanimator, a device that moves\nmolecules back to where they were prior to the death of the creature\nthat left the corpse, and restarts its vital activities. Some\ntheorists say that I continue my existence as a corpse if it remains\nin good shape; they will assume that I remain in existence after\nlosing my life, and continue my existence after the Corpse Reanimator\ndoes its work. On their view the Corpse Reanimator restores\nmy life--it gives me back the capacity to engage in vital\nactivities.\n\nGiven the possibilities of restoration and revivification, it seems\nbest to refine the loss of life account, as follows:\n\nDying is the loss of an object\u2019s life\u2014the loss of\nits capacity to perpetuate itself using vital activities. An object\ndies at the time it loses this capacity. It is dead at all\ntimes afterwards, except while that capacity is regained.\n2.5 Death and What We Are\n\nDeath for you and me is constituted by the loss of our capacity to\nsustain ourselves using vital activities. This characterization of\ndeath could be sharpened if we had a clearer idea of what we\nare, and its implications concerning our persistence. After\nall, we cannot retain any capacities if we fail to persist,\nso if we fail to persist we stop being capable of vital activities. We\ndie. However, what we are, and what is involved in our persistence, is\na matter of controversy.\n\nThere are three main views: animalism, which says that we are\nhuman animals (Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997, 2007); personism,\nwhich says that we are creatures with the capacity for self-awareness;\nand mindism, which says that we are minds (which may or may\nnot have the capacity for self-awareness) (McMahan 2002). Animalists\ntypically say that we persist over time just in case we remain the\nsame animal; mindist typically suggest that our persistence requires\nour remaining the same mind. Personism is usually paired with the view\nthat our persistence is determined by our psychological features and\nthe relations among them (Locke 1689, Parfit 1984). (For more on what\nwe are, see the entry on Personal Identity.)\n\nIf we are animals, with the persistence conditions of animals, we die\nwhen we cease to be the same animal. If we are minds, with the\npersistence conditions for minds, we die when we cease to meet these\nconditions. And if persistence is determined by our retaining certain\npsychological features, then the loss of those features will\nconstitute death.\n\nThese three ways of understanding death have very different\nimplications. Severe dementia can destroy a great many psychological\nfeatures without destroying the mind, which suggests that death as\nunderstood by personists can occur even though death as understood by\nmindists has not. Moreover, human animals sometimes survive the\ndestruction of the mind, as when the cerebrum dies but the brainstem\ndoes not, leaving an individual in a persistent vegetative state. Many\ntheorists also think that the mind could survive the extinction of the\nhuman animal, say when the brain is removed from the body, kept alive\nartificially, and the remainder of the body is destroyed (assuming\nthat a bare brain is not a human animal). These possibilities suggest\nthat death as understood by mindists can occur even though death as\nunderstood by animalists has not (and also that the latter sort of\ndeath need not be accompanied by the former.)\n2.6 Death and Existence\n\nWhat is the relationship between existence and death? May people and\nother creatures continue to exist after dying, or cease to exist\nwithout dying?\n\nTake the first question: may you and I and other creatures continue to\nexist for some time after our lives end? Fred Feldman (1992, p. 91)\ncoins the term termination thesis to refer to the view that\n\u201cwhen a person dies, he or she \u2026 goes out of existence;\nsubsequently, there is no such thing as that person.\u201d (A version\nof the thesis applies to any living thing.) We can call those who\naccept the termination thesis terminators, and those who deny\nit anti-terminators. One point anti-terminators such as\nFeldman (1992, 2000, 2013) cite is that people who encounter corpses\nsometimes call them dead animals, or dead people. Such talk may\nsuggest that we believe that animals continue to exist, as animals,\nwhile no longer alive. The idea might be that an animal continues to\ncount as the same animal if enough of its original components remain\nin much the same order, and animals continue to meet this condition\nfor a time following death (Mackie 1997). On this view, if you and I\nare animals (as animalists say), then we could survive for a time\nafter we are dead, albeit as corpses. In fact, we could survive\nindefinitely, by arranging to have our corpses preserved.\n\nHowever, this way of defending the anti-terminators\u2019s view may\nnot be decisive. The terms \u2018dead animal\u2019 and \u2018dead\nperson\u2019 seem ambiguous. Normally, when we use \u2018dead\npeople\u2019 or \u2018dead animal\u2019 we mean to speak of persons\nor animals who lived in the past. One dead person I can name is\nSocrates; he is now a \u2018dead person\u2019 even though his corpse\nsurely has ceased to exist. However, in certain contexts, such as when\nwe are standing inside morgues, we seem to use the terms \u2018dead\nanimal\u2019 and \u2018dead person\u2019 to mean \u201cremains of\nsomething that was an animal\u201d or \u201cremains of something\nthat was a person.\u201d On this interpretation, even in morgues\ncalling something a dead person does not imply that it is a\nperson.\n\nStill, the dispute between terminators and anti-terminators is\nunlikely to be settled on the basis of how we use terms such as\n\u2018dead animal\u2019 and \u2018dead person.\u2019 Metaphysical\nconsiderations must weigh in. For example, consider that the remarks\nmade in Section 1.3 about the persistence of objects are consistent\nwith the possibility that objects that are people may continue their\nexistence as corpses, which may be useful to anti-terminators. On the\nother hand, many theorists think that nothing is a person unless it\nhas various psychological features, which corpses lack, and some think\nthat nothing is an organism unless it is alive. Terminators may be\nable to exploit these thoughts.\n\nWhat about the second question: can creatures cease to exist without\ndying? Certainly things that never were alive, such as bubbles and\nstatues, can be deathlessly annihilated. Arguably, there are also ways\nthat living creatures can be deathlessly annihilated (Rosenberg 1983,\nFeldman 1992, Gilmore 2013). Perhaps an amoeba\u2019s existence ends\nwhen it splits, replacing itself with two amoebas, and the existence\nof chlamydomonas ends when pairs of them fuse to form a zygote. Yet\nwhen amoebas split, and chlamydomonas fuse, vital activities do not\ncease. If people could divide like amoebas, perhaps they, too could\ncease to exist without dying. (For a famous discussion of division,\nfusion, and their implications, see Parfit 1981.) If such\n\u2018deathless exits\u2019 are possible, we would have to modify\nthe loss of life account of death.\n\nHowever, proponents of the loss of life account can hold their ground.\nThey can say that division, fusion, and other apparent examples of\ndeathless exits are unusual ways of dying, because, in such cases,\nnonexistence is not brought about via the destruction of vital\nactivities, but they are not ways of escaping death altogether.\nProponents of the loss of life account might also turn the tables on\nits critics, and argue as follows: nothing can be alive unless it\nexists, so if something ceases to exist it ceases to be alive, but to\ncease to be alive is to die. So there are no deathless exits.\n2.7 Criteria for Death\n\nDefining death is one thing; providing criteria by which it can be\nreadily detected or verified is another. A definition is an account of\nwhat death is; when, and only when its definition is met,\ndeath has necessarily occurred. A criterion for death, by contrast,\nlays out conditions by which all and only actual deaths may\nbe readily identified. In some cases criteria for death are intended\nto capture conditions by which the actual deaths of human\npersons may be identified. Such a criterion falls short of a\ndefinition, but plays a practical role. For example, criteria for the\ndeath of a person would help physicians and jurists determine when\ndeath has occurred.\n\nIn the United States, the states have adopted criteria for the death\nof a person modeled on the Uniform Determination of Death Act\n(developed by the President\u2019s Commission, 1981), which says that\n\u201can individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible\ncessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2)\nirreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including\nthe brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in\naccordance with accepted medical standards.\u201d In the United\nKingdom, the accepted criterion is brain stem death, or the\n\u201cpermanent functional death of the brain stem\u201d (Pallis\n1982).\n\nThese current criteria are subject to criticism, even if we put aside\nreservations concerning the qualifier \u2018irreversible\u2019.\nAnimalists might resist the criteria since the vital activities of\nhuman beings whose entire brains have ceased to function can be\nsustained artificially using cardiopulmonary assistance. Mindists and\npersonists might also resist the criteria, on the grounds that minds\nand all psychological features can be destroyed in human beings whose\nbrain stems are intact. For example, cerebral death can leave its\nvictim with an intact brain stem, yet mindless and devoid of\nself-awareness. (For more on criteria for death, see the article on\nthe Definition of Death.)\n3. Epicurus and the Harm Thesis\n\nIs death bad for some people who die? Is it good for some of them?\n\nAccording to the harm thesis, death is, at least sometimes,\nbad for those who die, and in this sense something that\n\u2018harms\u2019 them. It is important to know what to make of this\nthesis, since our response itself can be harmful. This might happen as\nfollows: suppose that we love life, and reason that since it is good,\nmore would be better. Our thoughts then turn to death, and we decide\nit is bad: the better life is, we think, the better more life would\nbe, and the worse death is. At this point, we are in danger of\ncondemning the human condition, which embraces life and death, on the\ngrounds that it has a tragic side, namely death. It will help some if\nwe remind ourselves that our situation also has a good side. Indeed,\nour condemnation of death is here based on the assumption that more\nlife would be good. But such consolations are not for everyone. (They\nare unavailable if we crave immortality on the basis of demanding\nstandards by which the only worthwhile projects are endless in\nduration, for then we will condemn the condition of mere mortals as\ntragic through and through, and may, as Unamuno (1913) points out, end\nup suicidal, fearing that the only life available is not worth\nhaving.) And a favorable assessment of life may be a limited\nconsolation, since it leaves open the possibility that, viewing the\nhuman condition as a whole, the bad cancels much of the good. In any\ncase it is grim enough to conclude that, given the harm thesis, the\nhuman condition has a tragic side.\n\nIt is no wonder that theorists over the millennia have sought to\ndefeat the harm thesis. Let us consider some challenges to the harm\nthesis, beginning with the case against it developed by the ancient\nGreek philosopher Epicurus.\n3.1 The Epicurean Case\n\nEpicurus (341\u2013270) adopted a version of hedonism according to\nwhich pleasure (or pleasant experiences) is the only thing that is\nintrinsically good for us (that is, the only thing that is good for us\nin itself), while pain (or painful experiences) is the only thing that\nis intrinsically bad for us, bad in itself. Call this view intrinsic\nhedonism. (For a discussion of intrinsic value, see the entry on\nIntrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value.) Epicurus\u2019s commitment to\nintrinsic hedonism prompted him to say, in his Letter to\nMenoeceus, that \u201ceverything good and bad lies in\nsensation.\u201d He also claimed, in that same letter, that\n\u201cwhen we are, death is not, and when death is present, then we\nare not.\u201d The death of a person, and that person\u2019s\nexistence, do not overlap in time. On the basis of this assumption\nabout death and existence, he concluded that a person\u2019s death\ndoes not cause her to have any experiences (sensations)\u2014indeed,\n\u201cdeath is to be deprived of sensation.\u201d In the following\npassage, he uses these thoughts against the harm thesis:\n\nMake yourself familiar with the belief that death is nothing to us,\nsince everything good and bad lies in sensation, and death is to be\ndeprived of sensation. \u2026 So that most fearful of all bad\nthings, death, is nothing to us, since when we are, death is not, and\nwhen death is present, then we are not.\n\n\nMuch about Epicurus\u2019s argument is unclear, so let us work\nthrough it more carefully and see if we can fill in some details that\nhe did not supply. Some speculation will be necessary, but we can\ndevelop a reconstruction that aligns with the things he wrote.\n\nEarlier we mentioned one of the views Epicurus accepted, which we can\nstate as follows:\n\nIntrinsic hedonism is true: a person\u2019s experiences\n(sensations) of pleasure (or her pleasant experiences) are the only\nthings that are intrinsically good for her, the only things that are\ngood for her in themselves, while her experiences of pain (or painful\nexperiences) are the only things that are intrinsically bad for her,\nbad in themselves.\n\n\nFrom this view it follows that\n\nsomething is intrinsically good or bad for a person only if it is\nan experience.\n\n\nNow, regardless of whether a person experiences her death, that death\nis not itself an experience. (Compare: I may experience jogging down\nthe street, and I may experience the cup that is in front of me, but\nneither jogging nor the cup is itself an experience. My experiences\nare, so to speak, in my mind. Cups are not.) Let us add this\nobservation to the argument:\n\nA person\u2019s death is not an experience.\n\n\nAnd if a person\u2019s death is not an experience at all, clearly it\nis not an experience that is intrinsically good or bad for her. So,\nfrom 1\u20133, it follows that\n\na person\u2019s death is not intrinsically good or bad for\nher.\n\n\nHowever, something that is not intrinsically bad for a person might\nnevertheless make other things happen that are detrimental to her, in\nwhich case it may be extrinsically bad for her. Seeing\nsomebody fall and break her arm is not intrinsically bad for a person,\nbut it might well cause her painful sadness, which makes the accident\nshe saw extrinsically bad for her. Similarly, something that is not\nintrinsically good for a person might be extrinsically good for\nher.\n\nEpicurus recognized the possibility of extrinsic goodness. It is not\nentirely clear how he understood it, but he seemed to accept a view we\ncan call extrinsic instrumentalism: something is\nextrinsically good or bad for a person only if it makes her have\nthings (other than itself) that are intrinsically good or bad for her.\nLet us add this to the argument:\n\nextrinsic instrumentalism is true: something is extrinsically good\nor bad for a person only if it makes her have things that are\nintrinsically good or bad for her.\n\n\nArmed with this assumption, Epicurus can reject the possibility that a\nperson\u2019s death is extrinsically bad for her, arguing as follows.\nBecause Epicurus thought that the death of a person and that\nperson\u2019s existence do not overlap in time, he thought that\n\na person\u2019s death does not make her have any\nexperiences.\n\n\nFrom premises 2, 5 and 6 it follows that\n\na person\u2019s death is not extrinsically good or bad for\nher.\n\n\nTo complete the argument against the harm thesis, Epicurus would need\nan additional assumption, such as this:\n\nsomething is good or bad for a person only if it is either\nintrinsically or extrinsically good or bad for her.\n\n\nPremises 4, 7 and 8 entail that the harm thesis is false:\n\na person\u2019s death is not good or bad for her.\n\n\nIs this Epicurean argument convincing? Let us see if we can find weak\nspots. We can begin with a reservation concerning the term\n\u2018death.\u2019\n\nEarlier we noted that \u2018death\u2019 might be used for dying, the\nevent or process of losing life, or being dead, the property of having\nlost life. The first reservation about the argument is that it is\nstrongest if its uses of \u2018death\u2019 refer to being dead, and\nnot to (the event or process of) dying. Here is why.\n\nBeing dead is not an experience, and it does not make a person have\nany experiences. So (on Epicurus\u2019s assumptions) it is neither\nintrinsically nor extrinsically bad for a person to be dead.\nHowever, a person may experience dying, and the experience of\ndying (the experiences dying causes her to have) might well be\nintrinsically bad for her, even if only painful experiences are\nintrinsically bad for her (as premise 1 says). So even if\nbeing dead is not extrinsically bad for a person, the\nquestion arises as to whether, for some people, it is extrinsically\nbad to die. If something makes a person have painful\nexperiences, isn\u2019t it extrinsically bad for her, other things\nbeing equal? At least this much is true: the Epicurean argument does\nnot show that dying painfully is not extrinsically bad for a\nperson.\n\nApparently, then, the argument does not demonstrate that\nneither being dead nor dying is ever bad for those\nwho die. Nevertheless, unless we find further weaknesses in it, it\nstill seems to support powerful conclusions: being dead is neither\ngood nor bad for those who die, and dying is extrinsically good or bad\nfor them only if and insofar as it causes them to have painful\n(pleasant) experiences. Dying is wholly a matter of indifference for\nthose who do not experience it, say because they sleep through it.\n\nBut there are further reservations to consider. Intrinsic hedonism is\nquestionable. So is extrinsic instrumentalism.\n\nConsider the first of these. Which things are intrinsically good or\nbad for us is a controversial matter , but many theorists deny that\nthe list is limited to pleasure and pain. (For further discussion, see\nthe entry on Intrinsic Goodness, the entry on Preferences, and\n\u201cWhat Makes Someone's Life Go Best,\u201d Parfit 1984, pp.\n493\u2013502.) Adding more things to the list can undermine the Epicurean\nargument.\n\nFor example, we might adopt some version of preferentialism, or the\ndesire fulfillment account, which is the view that it is intrinsically\ngood for us to fulfill one of our desires (assuming that the desire\nmeets various conditions; exactly what these are is\ncontroversial\u2014let us put the matter aside), and it is\nintrinsically bad for us to have a desire that comes to be thwarted.\nNow, many of my desires may be fulfilled, and many may be thwarted,\nwithout my noticing\u2014desire fulfillment need have not\nexperiential upshot. If I want my child to be happy, and she is, my\ndesire is fulfilled, even if she has travelled away so far from me\nthat I cannot interact with her, now or ever again. So preferentialism\nblocks the Epicurean\u2019s move from premise 1 to 2.\n\nPreferentialism also blocks the move to 7. Epicureans cannot use\nextrinsic instrumentalism to deny that a person\u2019s death is\nextrinsically good or bad for her if the things that are intrinsically\ngood or bad for her are not limited to experiences. Preferentialism\nimplies that things may be extrinsically bad for us by virtue of\nthwarting our desires, regardless of whether this has any experiential\nupshot. Suppose, for example, that I desire that my child have a happy\nupbringing, and, for various reasons, it turns out that I am the only\none who can make this happen, but I die suddenly, and as a consequence\nshe has a miserable childhood. Arguably, my untimely death would be\nbad for me, in that it would thwart my desire, even if I die in my\nsleep, and am never aware of her fate. (The role a person\u2019s\nexperience plays in her being harmed is discussed by several\ntheorists, including Rosenbaum 1986, Nussbaum 2013, Silverstein 2013,\nand Fischer 2014.)\n\nNow consider some worries about extrinsic instrumentalism, which says\nthat something is extrinsically good or bad for us only if it causes\nus to have things that are intrinsically good or bad for us.\nThis view overlooks something that Thomas Nagel (1970) noted in his\nseminal essay \u201cDeath,\u201d namely the fact that things may be\nextrinsically good or bad for us, other things being equal, by virtue\nof causing us not to have\u2014by virtue of precluding our\nhaving\u2014things that are intrinsically good or bad for us.\nConsider that being rendered unconscious prior to surgery is\nextrinsically good for a patient who otherwise would endure great\nsuffering when the physicians apply the knife, in that it keeps him\nfrom suffering, and not because it causes him to accrue pleasure or\nsome other good. Of course, after waking, the patient might also\naccrue pleasure or some other good as an indirect result of having\nbeen sedated, but in view of the suffering that it averts, being\nsedated is extrinsically good for him whether he receives that\nindirect bonus or not. As well, being made unconscious might be\nextrinsically bad for a person, say when it precedes, not surgery, but\nrather some joyous occasion he will miss because he is not conscious\nwhile it occurs. It is extrinsically bad for him, in this case,\nbecause it prevents him from taking joy in the occasion he misses.\nThis remains true whether or not he also accrues some pain or other\nintrinsic evil as an indirect result of being sedated.\n\nIf it is indeed the case that things may be extrinsically good (bad)\nfor us, other things being equal, by virtue of precluding our having\nevils (goods), we will want to allow for this fact in settling on an\nadequate understanding of what makes things good or bad for us. Next\nlet us consider how this might be done, and the implications for the\nharm thesis.\n3.2 The Deprivationist Defense\n\nTo argue that death may be bad for those who die (even if they do not\nexperience dying), theorists typically draw upon some version of the\ncomparativist view that we are harmed by what makes our lives\nas wholes worse than they otherwise would be, and benefitted by what\nmakes our lives as wholes better than they otherwise would be (early\nproponents of this view include Nagel 1970, Quinn 1984, and Feldman\n1991). Applying comparativism, we may claim that, in at least some\ncases, dying at a time makes our lives as wholes worse than they would\nhave been had we not died when we did, roughly because, by cutting our\nlives short, it deprives us of good life. This suggestion about death\nneeds further development, but first let us explain the comparativist\nview more clearly.\n\nNote that how well off you are at one time is likely to differ from\nhow well off you are at another time. Your welfare level rises and\nfalls over time. (For a discussion of welfare, see the article on\nWell-Being.) What determines how well off you are at a time, or during\nan interval of time, are the things you then accrue that are\nintrinsically good for you, goods such as pleasure, together with the\nthings you then accrue that are intrinsically bad for you, evils such\nas pain (using the term \u2018evil\u2019 as a synonym for\n\u2018bad\u2019). Accruing the former at a time boosts your welfare\nlevel during that time, other things being equal, while accruing the\nlatter lowers your welfare level during that time. Your welfare level\nduring an interval of time will be positive if the goods you then\naccrue outweigh the evils. It will be 0\u2014neither positive nor\nnegative\u2014if and only if you are capable of accruing goods or\nevils (unlike, say, a shoe, which is incapable of faring well or ill)\nbut the goods you accrue are exactly offset by the evils and vice\nversa. The welfare level resulting from the goods and evils you accrue\nover the course of your life we may call your lifetime welfare\nlevel.\n\nUsing the notion of a lifetime welfare level, let us formulate an\naccount of what it is for something to be extrinsically good or bad\nfor us. Let us say that something is extrinsically good (bad) for us\nif and only if, and to the extent that, it is overall good (bad) for\nus simpliciter, where:\n\nan event is overall good (bad) for us simpliciter if\nand only if, and to the extent that, it makes our lifetime welfare\nlevel higher (lower) than it otherwise would be.\n\n(Why add the term \u2018simpliciter\u2019? Read on.) By way of\nillustration, consider a typical case in which you receive treatment\nby a dentist. Let us assume that, on this particular occasion, the\ndentist fills a cavity in one of your teeth, and that, had you not\nreceived this treatment, your tooth would have decayed, painfully, for\nmonths, until finally you would have sought out proper treatment. So\nthe salient difference between your lifetime welfare level in the\nsituation in which you are treated right away, on one hand, and the\nlifetime welfare level you would have in the case that you were not\ntreated until much later, on the other, is that, in the latter\nsituation, that level is significantly lower, due to the pain you\nwould incur. Hence, on these assumptions, receiving treatment was\noverall good for you: the greater that pain would have been, the\nbetter for you it was that you were treated.\n\nNote that things that are overall good for you may be a mixed\nbag\u2014they may bring some pain or other intrinsic evils in their\nwakes, as well as some intrinsic goods, and the mix may differ from\ntime to time. In some cases, what is overall good for you\nsimpliciter is overall bad for you in a temporally relative\nsense\u2014overall bad for you during some period of time.\nAnd although it is overall bad for you during one period of time, it\nmight be overall good for you during some other period of time. Let us\nelaborate upon this point briefly. Comparativists can say that:\n\nan event is overall good (bad) for us at some time t\nif and only if, and to the extent that, it makes our lifetime welfare\nlevel higher (lower) at t than it otherwise would be.\n\nSuppose, for example, that, while your tooth\u2019s cavity is being\nfilled, the dentist\u2019s drill causes you pain, and that this is\npain you would not have had if you had not sought treatment, and\ninstead watched TV. In that case, your visit to the dentist is overall\nbad for you during the time your tooth is being repaired.\nYet, as emerged earlier, your visit to the dentist is overall good for\nyou simpliciter, insofar as it enables you to reduce the\nepisodes of toothache you would suffer over the course of your\nlife.\n\nComparativists can accept intrinsic hedonism, but need not. They\ncould, for example, pair comparativism with some version of the\npreferentialist view (mentioned earlier) that getting what we\nwant\u2014fulfilling one of our desires\u2014is intrinsically good\nfor us, and having our desires thwarted is intrinsically bad for us.\nComparativism is neutral on the issue of what counts as the intrinsic\ngoods and evils. Theorists who conclude that things other than\npleasure are intrinsically good for us will want to weigh them in when\nthey assess an individual\u2019s welfare level. For example,\npreferentialists can say that even if accruing pleasure boosts a\nperson\u2019s welfare level so does desire fulfillment.\n\nAccording to comparativism, a person\u2019s death, whether painful or\nnot, may well be overall bad for her (and hence extrinsically bad for\nher). To decide whether a person\u2019s death is overall bad for her\nsimpliciter (usually we can drop \u2018simpliciter\u2019\nwithout creating confusion) we compare her actual lifetime welfare\nlevel to the lifetime welfare level she would have had if she had not\ndied. Suppose, for example, that Hilda died (painlessly) on December\n1, 2008 at age 25 and that, had she not died, she would have gone on\nto prosper for 25 years\u2014her welfare level during that time would\nhave been high\u2014then suffer during her final five years. Her\noverall welfare level over her final 30 years would have been high,\ndespite the downturn during the last five. Hence her lifetime welfare\nlevel had she not died at age 25 is significantly higher than her\nlifetime welfare level would be upon dying at 25. The former is\nboosted by the many goods she accrues during her final 30 years, and\nthese goods are absent from her lifetime welfare level as it would be\nwere her life ended at age 25. Hence dying at 25 is overall bad for\nher.\n\nImportantly, dying at a time is not overall bad for everyone who dies.\nIn fact, it will be overall good in many cases. Imagine that, had she\nnot died at age 25, Hilda would have fared badly for 25\nyears\u2014her welfare level during that time would have been low. We\nmight also suppose that, during her last five years her welfare level\nwould have been positive. Despite this last stipulation concerning her\nfinal five years, her lifetime welfare level had she not died at 25 is\nsignificantly lower than her lifetime welfare level would be if she\ndid die at 25, so, on our new assumptions, dying at 25 is overall good\nfor her.\n\nAccording to comparativism, when a death is bad for us despite not\nmaking us accrue intrinsic evils such as pain, it is bad for us\nbecause it precludes our coming to have various intrinsic goods which\nwe would have had if we had not died. We might say that death is bad\nfor us because of the goods it deprives us of, and not, or at least\nnot always, because of any intrinsic evils for which it is\nresponsible. This stance is sometimes called deprivationism,\nand its proponents deprivationists.\n\nAs promising as it is, however, there may be grounds for doubting that\ncomparativists can give the harm thesis a deprivationist defense. Let\nus discuss one such doubt next.\n4. The Timing Puzzle\n\nIf we cannot identify a time when something makes us worse off than we\notherwise would be, we might well doubt that it really was bad for us.\nWe might go so far as to say that what never makes us worse (better)\noff than we otherwise would be is not bad (good) for us. Call this the\nEpicurean presumption. Given this presumption, proponents of\nthe harm thesis need an answer to the timing question, which\nasks: if death is bad for us, at what time (or times) does it make us\nworse off than we otherwise would have been? In some cases in which\nthings are bad for us, it seems rather easy to identify times when we\nare made worse off, but in other cases, especially in some cases\ninvolving death, it seems more difficult, which may make us worry\nabout the deprivationist defense of the harm thesis. All this needs\nelaboration.\n4.1 Concurrentism\n\nIf having something is intrinsically bad for us, it is bad for\nus\u2014because it is intrinsically bad for us\u2014while we have\nit. Moreover, if something is overall bad for us wholly by virtue of\nmaking us have things that are intrinsically bad for us, we can say\nthat it makes us worse off while we have those evils. For example,\ncoming to be infected with a flu virus is overall bad for us, and the\ntime it makes us worse off is not when we come to be infected, but\nrather while we are sick, while we suffer. (If we came to be infected\nwith a virus, and our immune system dealt with it, preventing our\nbecoming sick, the infection would not be bad for us.) This line of\nthought suggests that a painful death makes us worse off\nwhile we die, or rather while dying is painful for us. What about a\npainless death? Might it also be bad for us? (If so, when are we made\nworse off?) Perhaps; more on that in a bit.\n\nWe can use the term concurrentism for the view that a bad\ndeath makes us worse off while we die.\n4.2 Priorism\n\nIf we reject intrinsic hedonism, we might conclude that death can make\nus worse off not just while we die but at other times as well. If we\nadopt some form of preferentialism, we can take the view that things\nmay make us worse off at the time one of our desires is thwarted.\nSuppose that, as George Pitcher (1984) suggested, a desire that you\nhave now may be thwarted by your death, even though you will die\nseveral months from now. In that case, it might be now that your death\nmakes you worse off than you would have been had you not died.\nPitcher\u2019s assumptions suggest that priorism is true:\ndeath may make you worse off before you die. It may harm you\nretroactively.\n\nIdentifying a time something makes us worse off seems rather easy in\ncases, such as the examples of infection or thwarted desire, in which\nit brings us have pain or other things that are intrinsically bad for\nus. But what about cases in which something is bad for us due to the\nfact that it precludes our having things that are intrinsically good\nfor us? In cases like this, the victim incurs deprivation\nharm. But at what time are such persons worse off than they\notherwise would be? When, in particular, does dying painlessly make a\nperson worse off?\n\nIs it possible to defend a concurrentist answer to this question about\ndeath? Julian Lamont (1998) says we incur deprivation harm at the time\nsome event ensures that we will not retain or attain some good that is\notherwise available. Call such an event an ensuring event.\nDeath may itself be an ensuring event, he thought, so death and\ndeprivation harm may occur simultaneously.\n\nBut this suggestion appears doubtful. Recall the earlier case in which\nwe come to be infected and only later experience any symptoms. The\nevent of coming to be infected is overall bad for us, but it seems\nimplausible to say that this makes us worse off than we otherwise\nwould be at the time we are infected. Instead, it seems,\ncoming to be infected makes us worse off later, while we are sick. We\nare unlikely to adopt concurrentism as our story concerning catching\nthe flu, which makes it doubtful as our story concerning deprivation\nharm.\n4.3 Subsequentism\n\nIn cases like catching the flu, it makes sense to say that the\noffending event is bad for its victim after it occurs\u2014while she\nis incurring intrinsic evils she otherwise would lack. Perhaps the\nsame is true of deprivation harm. Recall the example, discussed\nearlier, in which being sedated at time t is bad for a person\ndue to the fact that it deprives her of good things: in this example,\nit seems, being sedated makes her worse off than she otherwise would\nbe at a time after t\u2014at the time when she would have\nbeen enjoying those goods had she not been sedated. Can we extend this\nstory to the deprivation harm for which a victim\u2019s death is\nresponsible? Does a person\u2019s death makes her worse off than she\notherwise would be after she dies\u2014during the time when she would\nhave been enjoying the goods of which her death has deprived her, had\nshe not died? Call this stance subsequentism. Proponents of\nsubsequentism include Neil Feit (2002) and Ben Bradley (2004,\n2009).\n\nSubsequentism is plausible only if we can make good sense of the\nwelfare level someone occupies while dead, but this may not be\npossible. There are at least two problems to discuss.\n\nOne difficulty is the problem of the subject. Suppose we are\nterminators rather than anti-terminators (discussed in Section 2.6).\nSuppose, too, that you die at time t1 but had you\nnot you would have experienced joy at time t2.\nTime t2 arrives while you are dead, so that, given\nthe termination thesis, t2 arrives while you no\nlonger exist. Consider the property, lacks joy. Does it make\nsense to attribute this (or any other) property to you at\nt2? Does it make sense to say that some subject\nhas a property at a time when that subject does not exist? If not, it\nseems difficult to make sense of your having a welfare level then.\nEpicurus seemed to be thinking along these lines when he wrote that\n\u201cdeath is nothing to us, since when we are, death is not, and\nwhen death is present, then we are not.\u201d (Echoing Epicurus,\nNagel 1970 wrote \u201cSo long as a person exists, he has not yet\ndied, and once he has died, he no longer exists; so there seems to be\nno time when death, if it is a misfortune, can be ascribed to its\nunfortunate subject.\u201d But if this is the reason we cannot\nascribe misfortune to a victim of death then we cannot even ascribe\ndeath to any victim.)\n\nIt might seem possible to solve the problem of the subject by simply\nswitching sides and becoming anti-terminators, but this will not work.\nAnti-terminators can say that it is a straightforward matter to\nattribute the property lacks joy to you at\nt2, since you still exist at\nt2. You are your (joyless) corpse at\nt2. This won\u2019t work because you might die\nand go out of existence without leaving a corpse, and even if you\nleave a corpse it might rot away, taking you out of existence, well\nbefore time t2 arrives. Both possibilities are\nconsistent with the fact that, had you not died when you did, at\nt1, you would have experienced joy at\nt2.\n\nStill, there are more promising strategies for solving the problem of\nthe subject. Subsequentists might adopt a view that is sometimes\ncalled metaphysical eternalism (defended by Nagel 1970 and Silverstein\n1980, among others). On this view, past and future objects are\nontologically on a par with present objects. Existing things are\nspread out in both space and time. Suppose it is possible to refer to\nanything that is ontologically on a par with present objects. Then,\ngiven metaphysical eternalism, we can still refer to Socrates, even\nthough \u2018Socrates\u2019 refers to something whose existence is\ntemporally located wholly in the past, and say of him that he is not\nalive. For similar reasons, perhaps, we can also attribute the\nproperty lacks joy to a person, such as Socrates, whose\nexistence is over.\n\nHowever, even if they can solve the problem of the subject, and make\nsense of attributing properties to subjects who are dead,\nsubsequentists face another difficulty: it seems confused to speak of\nhow well off a subject is during times when she is dead. Now, it does\nmake sense to attribute the property lacks joy to a corpse,\nand to a person who has stopped existing. Anti-terminators will add\nthat a person will have this property\u2014lacks\njoy\u2014while she is a corpse. But it makes no sense to ask how\nwell off a person is while she is a corpse or during some time after\nshe has stopped existing altogether. The concept of faring well or ill\ndoes not apply to things like concrete blocks and corpses or to\npersons while they are corpses. Things that do fare well or ill may\npass through periods of time when they have a level of welfare that is\nequal to 0\u2014during those times they are capable of accruing goods\nor evils but do neither\u2014but unlike them, bags of concrete are\nnot capable of having any welfare level, not even a level of 0. The\nsame seems true of a corpse. And the same seems true of us during such\ntimes as we are no longer alive\u2014times when we have become\ncorpses or when those corpses have turned to dust.\n\nMany theorists who reject subsequentism assume that because death\ntakes a person out of actual existence, the dead are not\n\u201cthere\u201d to be harmed. Palle Yourgrau (2019) rejects this\nassumption. He combines modal realism (the view that, like the actual\nworld, other possible worlds are concrete objects) with the thesis of\ntransworld identity (one and the same object exists in more than one\npossible world), and says that although a dead person no longer exists\nin the actual world, one and the same person is still alive, and\nexists, in other possible worlds. We may deny that, after a person has\ndied, she is no longer real at all\u2014not \u201cthere\u201d to be\nharmed\u2014because she still exists in other worlds, according to\nYourgrau.\n4.4 Indefinitism\n\nSome (Nagel 1970; Silverstein 1980) suggest that death harms us but at\nno determinate time. This view is criticized by Julian Lamont (1998)\non the grounds that it implies that some events take place but at no\nparticular time. But William Grey (1999) counters that Lamont has\nmisunderstood Nagel\u2019s (and Grey\u2019s) indefinitist position,\nwhich is that the harm death causes is incurred during a stretch of\ntime that has blurry boundaries (compare: the time of the onset of\nbaldness).\n\nAs Grey understands it, indefinitism is correct only if subsequentism,\npriorism or concurrentism is true (Grey opts for subsequentism), for\neven a period of time with blurry edges must occur before, after or at\nthe same time as a mortem event (eternalism is an exception since an\ninfinite period has no boundaries to blur).\n4.5 Atemporalism\n\nSuppose we conclude that there just is no (stretch of) time, whether\nwith blurry edges or not, at which we are made worse off than we\notherwise would be by a death that precludes our having goods we\notherwise would have. Given the Epicurean presumption, we would have\nto conclude that it is not bad for us to be deprived of such goods by\ndeath. But of course we need not accept this conclusion. We can\ninstead reject the Epicurean presumption. Being deprived of goods by\ndeath is bad for us, we can say, if, and insofar as, it is overall bad\nfor us simpliciter, and to be overall bad for us\nsimpliciter, there need not be a time at which death\nmakes us worse off than we otherwise would be. There need be no time\nat which death makes our welfare level lower than it otherwise would\nbe. Death can preclude our enjoying years of pleasant activities,\nmaking our lives worse than they would have been had we not died, even\nif at no time we are worse off than we would be had our lives not been\ncut short.\n\nIsn\u2019t it still possible to raise a question about timing,\nnamely: if death is overall bad simpliciter for those who are\ndeprived of happy years, at what time is it bad for them? This\nquestion does indeed arise, but it is not the timing question we have\nbeen asking, and an answer to the one is not an answer to the other.\nThe answer to the new question is this: if true at all, the\nproposition that death is overall bad for us simpliciter is\nan eternal, a timeless, truth (Feldman 1991). A timeless truth is a\nproposition that is true at all times if true at all. That 6 is less\nthan 7 is an example. That the welfare level Harry accrued today is\nlower than the welfare level Mary accrued today is another example.\nAnd so is the proposition that Sam\u2019s death is overall bad for\nhim simpliciter. It amounts to the claim that Sam\u2019s\nactual lifetime welfare level is lower than the lifetime welfare level\nSam would have accrued had he not died. Jens Johansson (2013) coined\nthe term atemporalism for the view that \u201cdeath is bad\nfor the deceased but not at any time.\u201d (For further discussion\nof atemporalism see Lamont 1998, Silverstein 2000 and Feit 2002.)\n5. Further Reservations Concerning the Harm Theses\n\nBefore we move on, let us consider some further objections to the harm\nthesis and the deprivationist defense of it.\n5.1 Harmless Preclusion\n\nAnother worry about the deprivationist defense is that deprivationism\nappeals to comparativism, and comparativism says that an event or\nstate of affairs harms me, in that it is bad for me, when my life\nwould have been better for me, my lifetime welfare higher, had that\nthat event not occurred. However, there seem to be exceptions.\n\nI am not harmed, it seems, by failing to be brilliant, or rich and\nbeautiful. But compare my life as it is, with my unimpressive IQ,\nincome and looks, to my life as it would be were I brilliant or rich\nor beautiful: the former is considerably worse than the latter. My\nnot being a genius (or rich and so forth) precludes my coming\nto have many goods. It makes my life worse than it otherwise would be,\nso comparativism seems to imply that not being a genius is bad for me.\nSuppose you have the winning Mega Millions jacpot ticket, and you\ndecide to give it to me. Before you hand it over, you have a stroke\nand die. Has your death harmed me?\n\nEpicureans might renew their attack on the harm thesis by exploiting\nexamples like these. The examples appear to show that things can have\nenormous negative value for me without harming me. Similarly,\nEpicureans might insist, the preclusion of goods by death is harmless:\ncut short, my life is worse than it would be were I not to die, but\nthis comparative difference does not show that I am harmed.\n\nIt seems that the comparative criteria work well when we evaluate\nlosses, such as the loss of my arms, and also when we evaluate some\nlacks, such as the inability to see or to feel pleasure. But,\narguably, the criteria have worrisome implications when we evaluate\ncertain other lacks, such as my lack of genius. It is relatively clear\nthat a person is harmed by the inability to see but less clear that he\nis harmed by the lack of genius. Why is that?\n\nNagel seems inclined to think that the solution is to \u201cset some limits\non how possible a possibility must be for its nonrealization to be a\nmisfortune,\u201d but also mentions that we might not regard, as a\nmisfortune, \u201cany limitation, like mortality, that is normal to the\nspecies.\u201d Draper suggests that harmless preclusion involves cases in\nwhich the events or states of affairs that would be good for us if\nthey held are highly improbable (Draper 1999). Another explanation\nmight focus on the relative importance of having some goods rather\nthan others. In some moods, we may consider it harmful to be deprived\nof a good just when it is important for us to have it. The troublesome\nlacks we have been discussing might be lacks of goods it is\nunimportant to have; such lacks would not be harmful even though we\nwould be better off without them. (But if, against all odds, a person\nis a genius, or rich, or beautiful, would taking these away\nbe harmless to her?)\n5.2 The Symmetry Argument\n\nLucretius, a follower of Epicurus, extended Epicurus\u2019s case\nagainst the harm thesis. The argument he developed involved a thought\nexperiment:\n\nLook back at time \u2026 before our birth. In this way Nature holds\nbefore our eyes the mirror of our future after death. Is this so grim,\nso gloomy? (Lucretius 1951)\n\n\nAccording to his symmetry argument, it is irrational to object to\ndeath, assuming it ends our existence, since we do not find it\nobjectionable that we failed to exist prior to being alive, and the\nway things were for us while not existing then is just like\nthe way things will be for us after death ends our existence;\nour pre-vital nonexistence and our posthumous nonexistence are\nsymmetrical, alike in all relevant respects, so that any objection to\nthe one would apply to the other.\n\nLucretius\u2019s argument admits of more than one interpretation,\ndepending on whether it is supposed to address death understood as\ndying or as being dead (or both).\n\nOn one interpretation, the argument is this: the ending of life is not\nbad, since the only thing we could hold against it is the fact that it\nis followed by our nonexistence, yet the latter is not objectionable,\nas is shown by the fact that we do not object to our nonexistence\nbefore birth. So understood, the symmetry argument is weak. It would\nhave some force for someone who thought initially that death puts us\ninto a state or condition that is ghastly, perhaps painful, but that\nneed not be our complaint. Instead, our complaint might be that death\nprecludes our having more good life. Notice that the mirror image of\ndeath is birth (or, more precisely, becoming alive), and the two\naffect us in very different ways: birth makes life possible; if a life\nends up being good for us, birth starts a good thing going. Death\nmakes further life impossible; it brings a good thing to a close.\n\nPerhaps Lucretius only meant to argue that being dead is not\nbad, since the only thing we could hold against it is our\nnonexistence, which is not really objectionable, as witness our\nattitude about pre-vital nonexistence. So interpreted, there is a\nkernel of truth in Lucretius\u2019s argument. Truly, our pre-vital\nnonexistence does not concern us much. But perhaps that is because our\npre-vital nonexistence is followed by our existence. Perhaps we would\nnot worry overly about our post-vital nonexistence if it, too, were\nfollowed by our existence. If we could move in and out of existence,\nsay with the help of futuristic machines that could dismantle us, then\nrebuild us, molecule by molecule, after a period of nonexistence, we\nwould not be overly upset about the intervening gaps, and, rather like\nhibernating bears, we might enjoy taking occasional breaks from life\nwhile the world gets more interesting. But undergoing temporary\nnonexistence is not the same as undergoing permanent nonexistence.\nWhat is upsetting might be the permanence of post-vital\nnonexistence\u2014not nonexistence per se.\n\nThere is another way to use considerations of symmetry against the\nharm thesis: we want to die later, or not at all, because it is a way\nof extending life, but this attitude is irrational, Lucretius might\nsay, since we do not want to be born earlier (we do not want to have\nalways existed), which is also a way to extend life. As this argument\nsuggests, we are more concerned about the indefinite\ncontinuation of our lives than about their indefinite\nextension. (Be careful when you rub the magic lamp: if you\nwish that your life be extended, the genie might make you older!) A\nlife can be extended by adding to its future \\(or\\) to its past. Some\nof us might welcome the prospect of having lived a life stretching\nindefinitely into the past, given fortuitous circumstances. But we\nwould prefer a life stretching indefinitely into the future.\n\nIs it irrational to want future life more than past life? No; it is\nnot surprising to find ourselves with no desire to extend life into\nthe past, since the structure of the world permits life extension only\ninto the future, and that is good enough. But what if life extension\nwere possible in either direction? Would we still be indifferent about\na lengthier past? And should our attitude about future life match our\nattitude about past life?\n\nOur attitude about future life should match our attitude about past\nlife if our interests and attitudes are limited in certain ways. If\nquantity of life is the only concern, a preference for future life is\nirrational. Similarly, the preference is irrational if our only\nconcern is to maximize how much pleasure we experience over the course\nof our lives without regard to its temporal distribution. But our\nattitude is not that of the life- or pleasure-gourmand.\n\nAccording to Parfit, we have a far-reaching bias extending to goods in\ngeneral: we prefer that any good things, not just pleasures, be in our\nfuture, and that bad things, if they happen at all, be in our past. He\nargues that if we take this extensive bias for granted, and assume\nthat, because of it, it is better for us to have goods in the future\nthan in the past, we can explain why it is rational to deplore death\nmore than we do our not having always existed: the former, not the\nlatter, deprives us of good things in the future (he need not say that\nit is because it is in the past that we worry about the life-limiting\nevent at the beginning of our lives less than the life-limiting event\nat the end). This preference for future goods is unfortunate, however,\naccording to Parfit. If cultivated, the temporal insensitivity of the\nlife- or pleasure-gourmand could lower our sensitivity to death:\ntowards the end of life, we would find it unsettling that our supply\nof pleasures cannot be increased in the future, but we would be\ncomforted by the pleasures we have accumulated.\n\nWhether or not we have the extensive bias described by Parfit, it is\ntrue that the accumulation of life and pleasure, and the passive\ncontemplation thereof, are not our only interests. We also have\nactive, forward\u2013looking goals and concerns. Engaging in such\npursuits has its own value; for many of us, these pursuits, and not\npassive interests, are central to our \u2018identities\u2019, our\nfundamental values and commitments. However, we cannot make and pursue\nplans for our past. We must project our plans (our\nself\u2013realization) into the future, which explains our forward\nbias. (We could have been devising and pursuing plans in the\npast, but these plans will not be extensions of our present concerns.)\nIt is not irrational to prefer that our lives be extended into the\nfuture rather than the past, if for no other reason than this: only\nthe former makes our existing forward-looking pursuits possible. It is\nnot irrational to prefer not to be at the end of our lives, unable to\nshape them further, and limited to reminiscing about days gone by. As\nFrances Kamm (1998, 2021) emphasizes, we do not want our lives to be\nall over with.\n\nNevertheless, it does not follow that we should be\nindifferent about the extent of our pasts. Being in the grip\nof forward-looking pursuits is important, but we have passive\ninterests as well, which make a more extensive past preferable.\nMoreover, having been devising and pursuing plans in the past\nis worthwhile. If fated to die tomorrow, most of us would prefer to\nhave a thousand years of glory behind us rather than fifty. We want to\nhave lived well.\n\nIn \u201cDeath\u201d Thomas Nagel offered a response to Lucretius\nthat has been widely discussed. It is entirely reasonable not to want\nto come into existence earlier even though we want to live longer,\nNagel said, because it is metaphysically impossible for a person to\nhave come into existence significantly earlier than she did, even\nthough it is possible for a person to have existed longer than she\nactually did. However, his response hinges on questionable assumptions\nabout the essential features of people\u2019s origins, as Nagel\nacknowledges (in footnote 3 of the reprint of \u201cDeath\u201d in\nhis collection Mortal Questions.) Imagine someone who\noriginated from a zygote that had been frozen for a very long time.\nMightn't that zygote have been frozen for a brief time instead?\nWouldn\u2019t that be a way for this person to have come into\nexistence far earlier than she did?\n\nAccording to Frederik Kaufman (2016, p. 63), this thought experiment\n(perhaps tweaked a bit) might provide a way in which a human\norganism could have come into existence far earlier than she\ndid, but it does not provide a way in which a person could\nhave come into existence far earlier. \u201cPersons (properly\nunderstood) cannot exist earlier than they do.\u201d He bases this\nview on the assumption\u2014challenged by animalists but defended by\nParfit\u2014that persons are objects (distinct from organisms) with\npsychological persistence conditions, chief among which is\npsychological continuity, together with the assumption that \u201cif\nmental continuity is constitutive of personal identity, then when a\nparticular consciousness emerges is essential to that\nperson.\u201d\n6. Posthumous Harm\n\nAccording to Aristotle,\n\na dead man is popularly believed to be capable of having both good and\nill fortune\u2014honour and dishonour and prosperity and the loss of\nit among his children and descendants generally\u2014in exactly the\nsame way as if he were alive but unaware or unobservant of what was\nhappening (Nicomachean Ethics 1.10)\n\n\nThe belief Aristotle reported in this passage is that a person may be\nbenefitted or harmed by things that happen while she is dead. Nagel\n(1970, p. 66) agrees; drawing upon his indefinitist approach he says\nthat \u201ca man's life includes much that does not take place within\nthe boundaries \u2026 of his life\u201d and that \u201cthere is a\nsimple account of what is wrong with breaking a deathbed promise. It\nis an injury to the dead man.\u201d If something that occurs while a\nperson is dead is bad for her, let us say that it is responsible for\nposthumous harm. (But this way of speaking is potentially\nmisleading, as theorists who argue that posthumous events may harm us\nneed not assume that the victims are worse off while they are dead.)\nIs there such a thing as posthumous harm?\n6.1 Doubts About Posthumous Harm\n\nThe main reason to doubt the possibility of posthumous harm is the\nassumption that it presupposes the (dubious) possibility of backwards\ncausation. As Ernest Partridge wrote, \u201cafter death no events can\nalter a moment of a person's life\u201d (1981, p. 248). The dead may\nbe wronged, Partridge thought, but being wronged is not a kind of\nharm. (The claim that a person may be wronged by actions others take\nafter she is dead is itself quite controversial. Like Partridge, some\ntheorists think that people may be wronged but not harmed\nposthumously. Priorists typically argue that both are possible, while\nother, theorists, such as J.S. Taylor 2012, argue that neither is\npossible.)\n\nWe might also question the possibility of posthumous harm by drawing\non the assumption (made by Mark Bernstein 1998, p. 19, and Walter\nGlannon 2001, p. 138, among others) that something is intrinsically\ngood or bad for a person only if it reduces to her intrinsic,\nnon-relational properties. For simplicity, we can focus on one version\nof this view, namely intrinsic hedonism. Suppose we assume that a\nperson is harmed only by what is intrinsically or extrinsically bad\nfor her, that intrinsic hedonism is the correct account of intrinsic\nharm and comparativism is the correct account of extrinsic harm, and\nalso that the termination thesis (people do not exist while dead) is\ntrue. On these assumptions, it is impossible for an event that occurs\nafter a person dies to be bad for her. It cannot be bad for her in\nitself and it cannot be overall bad for her either. To be overall bad\nfor a person, a posthumous event would have to make her have fewer\ngoods or more evils or both than she would have had if that event had\nnot occurred. But nothing that happens after a person dies and ceases\nto exist has any bearing on the amounts of pleasure or pain in her\nlife. Nothing that occurs after she ceases to exist modifies\nany of her intrinsic properties.\n\nAlthough the above assumptions rule out the possibility of posthumous\nharm, they are entirely consistent, we have seen, with the possibility\nof mortal harm, the possibility that people are harmed by dying. (We\nmight think otherwise if, as some theorists do, we assume that a\nperson no longer exists at the time she dies. Joel Feinberg 1984,\nfollowing Barbara Levenbook 1984, defined death as \u201cthe first\nmoment of the subject\u2019s nonexistence,\u201d which makes death\nsomething that occurs after a person has ceased to exist, and suggests\nthat by ruling out the possibility that a person is harmed by things\nthat occur after she ceases to exist we rule out the possibility of\nmortal harm.)\n6.2 Retroactive Harm\n\nThose who defend the possibility of posthumous harm deny that it\ninvolves backwards causation. But how could posthumous events affect\npeople if not via backwards causation?\n\nSome theorists say that posthumous harm occurs when posthumous events\nchange the value of a person\u2019s life for the worse. Dorothy\nGrover (1989) suggests that posthumous events may affect the\n\u201cquality\u201d of a person's life, say by changing the value of\nher accomplishments. David Velleman (1991) argues along similar lines,\nclaiming that later events may affect the meaning of earlier events,\nand the latter bears on the value of a person\u2019s life.\n\nSome theorists (for example, Pitcher 1984, Feinberg 1984, Luper 2004\nand 2012, and Scarre 2013) appeal to preferentialism to explain the\npossibility of posthumous harm. We noted earlier that preferentialists\ncan defend the idea that some events harm their victims retroactively,\nand that death is such an event. Preferentialists can take a similar\nstance on posthumous events, assuming that things that happen after we\ndie may determine whether desires we have while alive are fulfilled or\nthwarted.\n\nAccording to Pitcher, posthumous events harm us by being responsible\nfor truths that thwart our desires. For example, being slandered while\nI am dead makes it true that my reputation is to be damaged, and this\nharms me at all and only those times when I desire that my reputation\nbe untarnished. It is while I am alive that I care about my\nreputation\u2019s always being intact, and it is while I am alive\nthat my well-being is brought lower by posthumous slander. Similarly,\nmy desire that my child have a happy upbringing even if I am not there\nto provide it will be thwarted if, after I die, she catches some\ndevastating illness. The event that makes it true that my child will\nbe miserable occurs after I am gone, but this truth thwarts my desire\nabout my child now, so it is now that I am worse off. The posthumous\nevents themselves harm me only indirectly; directly I am harmed by\ntheir making things true that bear on my interests.\n\nHowever, the desire-based case for the possibility of posthumous harm\nremains controversial. It will be rejected by theorists who doubt that\npeople are harmed by events that do not modify their intrinsic\nfeatures, and by theorists who think that it hinges on the possibility\nof backwards causation, of course. Velleman (1991, p. 339) rejects the\ndesire-based case on the grounds that \u201cwe think of a person's\ncurrent well-being as a fact intrinsic to the present, not as a\nrelation that he currently bears to his future.\u201d Some theorists\necho a criticism that was offered by Partridge (1981, p. 246).\nConsider an event that thwarts one of a person's desires. To harm her\nby virtue of thwarting that desire, Partridge claims, the event must\noccur while she still has that desire, while she still cares\nabout whether it is fulfilled, but she and her desire are gone by the\ntime a posthumous event occurs. For some theorists (Vorobej, 1998,\nSuits 2001), the point is that we have no reason to care whether our\ndesires are fulfilled by events that occur once we no longer have\nthose desires, and we no longer have desires after we die. Parfit\nresisted this charge by noting that while some of our desires are\nconditional on their own persistence (we want them fulfilled at a time\nonly on condition that we will still have them at that time), others\nare not.\n7. Never Dying\n\nIs it always a misfortune for us to die? Would never dying instead be\nbad for us? In a pair of influential essays, Thomas Nagel defends an\naffirmative answer to the first question, while Bernard Williams\ndefends an affirmative answer to the second.\n7.1 Never Dying Would be Good\n\nIn \u201cDeath\u201d (and in The View From Nowhere, p. 224)\nNagel argues that no matter when it happens, dying is bad for those\nwho die. He bases this view on the claim that \u201clife is worth\nliving even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful and the\ngood ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The\nadditional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather\nthan by any of its contents.\u201d (1970, p. 60) Nagel\u2019s view\nappears to be that it is intrinsically good for us to experience\nthings, and that this good is great enough to outweigh any evils that\naccompany it. Hence a person\u2019s welfare level is positive at any\ntime when she is experiencing things, and no matter how much misery\ncontinued existence will bring her, it is overall good for her to live\nlonger, assuming that she continues to experience things. (Nagel does\nnot argue that being deprived of continued life would be a misfortune\nif that life were entirely devoid of experience.)\n\nNagel considers objections to his view towards the end of his essay.\nOne might argue, Nagel points out (as noted earlier), that mortality\nis not a misfortune on the grounds that the nonrealization of remote\npossibilities (like being immortal) is not harmful, or on the grounds\nthat limitations that are normal to the species (like mortality) are\nnot harmful. He responds that the normality and inevitableness of\ndeath \u201cdo not imply that it would not be good to live\nlonger.\u201d Whenever death comes, it would have been good to live\nlonger, so it is bad for us that we will not: \u201cif there is no\nlimit to the amount of life that it would be good to have, then it may\nbe that a bad end is in store for us all.\u201d (1970, p. 69)\n\nNagel\u2019s case for saying that death is always bad for those who\ndie rests on his claim that the goodness of experiencing outweighs any\naccompanying evils. However, the latter is implausible, as is evident\nto anyone who would rather be sedated into unconsciousness than\nundergo the suffering she would otherwise experience during surgery.\nUnder such circumstances, sedation is overall good for us, despite the\nfact that (indeed: because) it stops us from experiencing things for a\ntime. And once this is acknowledged, it seems reasonable to add that,\nunder certain circumstances, dying would be overall good for us, and\nhence not bad for us after all. It would be overall good for us if the\nfurther life we otherwise would have would bring us great evils, such\nas suffering, that are not offset by goods.\n7.2 Never Dying Would be a Misfortune\n\nBernard Williams (and others, such as Shelly Kagan 2012) takes the\nview that it would be bad to live forever, even under the best of\ncircumstances. In his influential essay \u201cThe Makropulos Case:\nReflections on the Tedium of Immortality,\u201d Williams argues that\nalthough the deaths of some persons is a misfortune for them, never\ndying would be intolerable. In arguing for these views, Williams draws\nupon the notion of a categorical desire, which we can clarify as\nfollows.\n\nConsider a woman who wants to die. She might still take the view that\nif she is to live on, then she should be well fed and clothed. She\nwants food and clothing on condition she remain alive. In this sense\nher desires (for food and clothes) are conditional on her remaining\nalive, and, in being conditional on her living on, they do not give\nher reason to live. Contrast a father who desires that his beloved\ndaughter have a good start in life. His desire is not conditional on\nhis remaining alive. In this sense, it is, Williams says, categorical.\nIn fact, his desire gives him reason to live, because he can see to\nher well-being if he survives. Williams thinks that our categorical\ndesires are not only what motivate us to live on, they give meaning to\nour lives, and are important elements of our characters. He also\nthinks that it is by virtue of the fact that we will retain the same\ncharacter until a later time that it is clear to us that we will be\nthe same person until then.\n\nThe bearing on death, according to Williams, is, first, that we have\ngood reason to condemn a death that is premature in the sense that it\nthwarts our categorical desires. Second, mortality is good, for if we\nlive long enough, eventually we will lose our categorical desires. At\nthat point we will no longer be motivated to live on, and oppressive\nboredom will set in. When we contemplate this fate from our vantage\npoint in the present, we find it that it is not even clear to us that\nthese bored seniors are us.\n\nIf we could find a way to extend our lives indefinitely, yet avoid the\nravages of senescence, and remain healthy and mentally competent,\ncouldn\u2019t we avoid becoming jaded with life by gradually varying\nour interests over time, adding to and perhaps replacing some of our\ncategorical desires, again and again? Several theorists including\nNagel (1986, p. 224, n. 3), Glover (1977, p. 57), and Fischer (1994),\nhave argued that the lives of superseniors need not become dull and\ntedious. Williams\u2019s view is that it is not possible to make\neternal life desirable (which claim is not identical to the claim that\neternal life would inevitably be bad for us). Varying my categorical\ndesires will not work, because, to be desirable, the endless life I\ndesign for myself must meet two conditions: (1) \u201cit should\nclearly be me who lives forever,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state in\nwhich I survive should be one that, to me looking forward, will be\nadequately related, in the life it presents, to those aims I now have\nin wanting to survive at all.\u201d (1973, p. 83) If I replace my\ncategorical desires, I fall afoul of at least one of these conditions.\nLife under the future desires is detached from life under my current\ncategorical desires. Moreover, the desires I give myself in the future\nwill be elements of a character that is very different from my current\ncharacter; replacing my current character with an entirely different\none later in life makes it far less clear, Williams appears to think,\nthat the individual living that later life is me. \u201cThe degree of\nidentification needed with the later life \u2026 is absolutely\nminimal.\u201d (1973, p. 85)\n\nWilliams\u2019s claim that immortality cannot be made desirable\nremains controversial. It is not obvious that eternal life is\nundesirable if it involves changing our categorical desires and\ncharacters (insofar as our characters are defined by the desires). Nor\nis it obvious that such changes must violate Williams\u2019s two\nconditions for the desirability of continued life. Williams seems to\nthink that the individual who is changed in this way will not clearly\nbe the same person as before, but he stops short of saying that it\nclearly will not be the same person (indeed, he defends a bodily\ncontinuity criterion for identity in \u201cThe Self and the\nFuture,\u201d pp. 46\u201363, so he presumably thinks that a person\ndoes survive changes of desires and character). Concerning\nWilliams\u2019s second condition, his view is that if we replace our\ncharacters and desires, \u201cthere is nothing left by which he can\njudge\u201d whether future life is desirable (1093, p. 85). Yet it\nseems reasonable to take the view now that it would be good for me to\ndevelop and fulfil desires in the future\u2014desires I now lack.\nMany of us would welcome the prospect of gradually transforming our\ninterests and projects over time. The gradual, continuous\ntransformation of our desires and projects does not end our lives, or\nexistence. It is distinct from, and preferable to, annihilation. If we\ncould live endlessly, the stages of our lives would display reduced\nconnectedness, yet remain continuous, which is a property that is\nimportant in the kind of survival most of us prize. Even after\ndrinking from the fountain of eternal youth, we would tend to focus on\nrelatively short stretches of our indefinitely extensive lives, being\nanimated by the specific projects and relationships we have then.\nHowever, sometimes we would turn our attention to long stretches of\nlife, and then, prizing continuity, we might well phase in new and\nworthwhile undertakings that build upon, and do not wholly replace,\nthe old. (For further discussion of the desirability of eternal life,\nsee Overall 2003, Bortolotti 2009, Smuts 2011, Luper 2012b, Altshuler\n2016, Buben 2016, Cholbi 2016, and Fischer 2019.)\n8. Can Death\u2019s Harmfulness be Reduced?\n\nEven if death is usually bad for those of us who die, perhaps it\nneed not be bad for us, if we prepare ourselves suitably.\nThis might be possible if some form of preferentialism is true, and\nif, by altering our desires, we could cease to have any interests that\ndying would impair. For then we might be able to thanatize\nour desires, in this sense: we might abandon all desires that death\nmight thwart. Among these are desires we can satisfy only if we live\non for a few days, but also desires we cannot possibly satisfy within\nthe span of a normal lifetime, and the desire for immortality itself.\nInstead of desiring that some project of mine succeed, which is a\ndesire that might be thwarted by my death, I might instead adopt a\nconditionalized version of this desire, namely: should I live on, let\nmy project succeed. If all goes well, thanatizing would insulate us\nfrom harm from death by leaving us with no interests with which dying\ninterferes.\n\nUnfortunately, this strategy will backfire. The main problem is that\ndeath can interfere with desire fulfillment not just by falsifying the\nobjects of our desires but also by precluding our having desires\n(Luper 2013). So even if we resolve, from now on, to limit ourselves\nto desires whose objects cannot be falsified by death, we are still\nvulnerable to the harm death will do us if it precludes our having and\nfulfilling desires. Hence thanatizing would force us to avoid having\nany desires whose fulfillment would have benefitted us, and to deny\nourselves such desires would be as bad for us as the harm we are\ntrying to avoid.\n\nHowever, the core idea of adapting our desires is useful, if not taken\nto an extreme. It is prudent to avoid taking on goals we cannot\npossibly attain, and hence prudent to eschew projects that cannot\npossibly be completed during the course of a normal lifetime.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Altshuler, R., 2016. \u201cImmortality, Identity, and\nDesirability,\u201d in Cholbi 2016.", "Bedau, M., 2014. \u201cThe Nature of Life\u201d in S.
