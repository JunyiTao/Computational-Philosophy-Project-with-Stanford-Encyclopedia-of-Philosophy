    "main_text": "Manifestos for N\u00e9gritude\n3. Manifestos for N\u00e9gritude\n\nFollowing the example of Alain Locke, Leon Damas in 1947 and\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor a year later published\nAnthologies of poetry to manifest the existence of\nN\u00e9gritude as an aesthetics and as a literary movement.\n\nIn the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to his Po\u00e8tes\nd\u2019expression fran\u00e7aise 1900\u20131945, Damas\nproclaimed that \u201cthe time of blocking out and inhibition\u201d\nhad now given place to \u201canother age: that in which the colonized\nman becomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a\nnovelist or a story-teller, an essayist or a poet.\u201d And he\nstated the literary and political significance of his\nAnthology in non ambiguous terms: \u201cPoverty, illiteracy,\nexploitation of man by man, social and political racism suffered by\nthe black or the yellow, forced labor, inequalities, lies,\nresignation, swindles, prejudices, complacencies, cowardice, failures,\ncrimes committed in the name of liberty, of equality, of fraternity,\nthat is the theme of this indigenous poetry in French\u201d (Damas\n1947, 10). It is important to notice that he meant his anthology to be\na manifesto, not so much for N\u00e9gritude, than for the Colonized\nin general, as he insisted that the sufferings of colonialism were the\nburden of \u201cthe black and the yellow\u201d and as he featured in\nthe selection poets from Indochina and Madagascar. Or rather Damas\nunderstood the concept of N\u00e9gritude (in fact the word does not\nappear in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the anthology) to\nencompass people of color in general as they were under the domination\nof European colonialism. This is a broader meaning of N\u00e9gritude\nthat the \u201cfathers\u201d of the movement always kept in mind.\nDamas\u2019 view about the substance of the poetry he was presenting,\nabout what the poets gathered in his book had in common besides living\nthe same colonial situation, is generally the same as Etienne\nL\u00e9ro\u2019s, whose \u201cMis\u00e8re d\u2019une\npo\u00e9sie\u201d (\u201cPoverty of a Poetry\u201d) he quotes\n abundantly.[2]\n In a vitalistic language that characterizes N\u00e9gritude\nL\u00e9on Damas opposes, using L\u00e9ro\u2019s language, the\nvitality of this \u201cnew poetry\u201d to what he denounced as\n\u201cwhite literary decadence\u201d (to be contrasted with the\nrevolutionary nature of surrealist philosophy and literature). He\nquoted in particular L\u00e9ro\u2019s denunciation of writers from\nthe Caribbean \u201cmulatto society, intellectually \u2026 corrupt\nand literarily nourished with white decadence\u201d to the point that\nsome of them would make it a matter of pride that a white person could\nread their whole book without being able to tell \u201cwhat their\nactual complexion was\u201d (Damas 1947, 13). The\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d was indeed a manifesto for N\u00e9gritude\nas a vital poetic force that Damas (and L\u00e9ro) identified as\n\u201cthe wind rising from Black America\u201d which in turn\nexpresses \u201cthe African love for life, the African joy in love,\nthe African dream of death\u201d (Damas 1947, 13).\n\nSenghor\u2019s Anthologie de la nouvelle po\u00e9sie\nn\u00e8gre et malgache de langue fran\u00e7aise, (An\nAnthology of the New Negro and Malagasy Poetry in French), published\nin 1948, would eventually overshadow Damas\u2019 anthology and his\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to it as a manifesto for the\nN\u00e9gritude movement. Senghor\u2019s own\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d is just five short paragraphs as it devoted\nonly to the technicalities of selecting the poets gathered in the book\n(interestingly, unlike Damas, his choice is restricted to the\n\u201cBlacks\u201d, the Malagasies being according to him\n\u201cm\u00e9laniens\u201d (Senghor 1948, 2)). But what\ncontributed greatly to the fame of the Anthology and\npropelled N\u00e9gritude into the broad intellectual conversation\nwas the \u201cPreface\u201d written for it by French philosopher and\npublic intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre (1906\u20131980). The title of\nthe \u201cpreface\u201d, Black Orpheus, referring to the\nGreek myth about the evocative force of poetry but also about its\neventual impotence in front of fate and death, fully expresses what\ncan be called the kiss of death the existentialist philosopher gave to\nthe movement.\n",
