If it has aspects or qualities in common with\nanything else, it is nonetheless stipulated to be specifically itself\nnot insofar as it has these in common, and thus is indistinguishable\nfrom the other things that share them, but insofar as it is different\nfrom them.\nTo be is to be determinate. To be determinate is to be finite,\nnon-all. To be finite is to be conditional. Anything strictly\nunconditional would ipso facto be omnipresent (no particular\nplace rather than another can be the \u201ccondition\u201d for its\nexistence) and always occurring (no particular time rather than\nanother can be the \u201ccondition\u201d for its existence), and\nthus indistinguishable from anything else. This would be equivalent to\nnot being determinate at all, for it would be impossible for an\nunconditional entity to be mutually exclusive with anything, since\nthat exclusion would then have to be a \u201ccondition\u201d of its\nexistence.\nAny entity must thus be copresent with some otherness; it must\nexist in a world that includes something that is not it, i.e., (by\nitem #1), something that is mutually exclusive with it (even if just\nthe empty space around it). Some form of copresence-with-otherness is\nan essential characteristic of the existence of all entities.\nAll forms of relation, including relations of causality and of\nconceptual contrast, are instances of this necessary\ncopresence-in-the-world.\nThe conditions from which it must be different but related include\nnot only immediately contiguous causally efficient factors, but also\nprior states of affairs. More searchingly, the constitutive copresent\notherness cannot be to non-X in general, for this would\nmerely be a repetition of the determination of X itself, in\nreverse; to the extent that there is no more in non-X than\nthe negation of X, no new content is provided by the\ncontrast, which therefore presupposes X. Rather, the\nexclusions that make up the determination of X must be\nspecific other determinations, other exclusions; they must in\nprinciple include anything at all that the entity in question is\ndifferent from: to be determinate as X is a specific\nexclusion of all specific non-X things and states. We have\ngreater knowledge of what the essence of a dog is by learning more\nabout each and every particular thing that the dog is not, how it\ndiffers specifically from a cat, from a hedgehog, from a table, from a\ntowel\u2026. (Our knowledge is thus always constitutively partial\nand in-process; knowing X is always being poised to know more\nabout X. Knowledge per se is non-omniscience.)\nHowever, all copresence-in-the-world, all conditioning, all\nrelation, all causality between two entities requires some overlap or\ninterface between them. There must be some place, thing, time, medium\nor concept that simultaneously includes them both, or which they both\ninclude. Any two entities must have something in common to succeed in\nbeing copresent\u2014to have a causal relation or to even be\ncontrasted.\nBut no genuinely distinct entities, insofar as they are distinct\nand thus determinate, have anything in common.\nHence two genuinely mutually exclusive entities can have no\nrelation of conditioning one another.\nHence there are no genuinely mutually exclusive entities. Thus the\nnature of determination stipulated in item #1 must be supplemented.\nThis rewrite of the nature of determination is the Three Truths.\nWhatever appears to be, i.e., to be just what it is and nothing\nelse, cannot really be mutually exclusive with whatever it is not.\nX is \u201cnon-different\u201d from non-X. This\nnon-difference is called the Emptiness (\u7a7a kong,\n\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101) of X. For if X is\nnon-different from non-X, it fails to fulfill the condition\nof being X stipulated in item #1, and thus X is\nnot X; X is \u201cempty\u201d.\nBut X is also \u201cnon-same\u201d with non-X.\nEmpirically, if it were the same, there would be no X to be\ncalled non-different: its presence is nothing other than its\nnon-identity with all other states. Logically, the alternative to the\nTiantai view is the default bivalent assumption that either some\nentities exist or that no entities exist; but both existing and\nnon-existing require non-sameness\u2014i.e., the non-sameness between\nexisting and non-existing. Anything determinate is non-same with what\nis not itself, by item #1. This is why there is something rather than\nnothing: even total nothingness would still be determinate and\nnon-same to what it is not, i.e., non-same to somethingness. Nothing\nwould therefore still be something, so the question why there is\nsomething rather than nothing is actually moot. Non-sameness to what\nit is not is analytically necessary to any proposed entity. Even if no\nentity is posited, \u201cno-entity-being-posited\u201d will not\nobtain unless the positing of entities is thereby excluded, and\nnon-sameness is necessary to succeed in excluding the positing of any\nentity. This is non-sameness to non-X is called the\nProvisional Positing or Conventional Truth (\u5047 jia) of\nX.\nThe non-sameness of X and non-X and the\nnon-difference between X and non-X are themselves\nnon-same as one another and non-different from one another. Non-same\nin spite of being non-different is Provisional Positing. Non-different\nin spite of being non-same is Emptiness. These are just reversed ways\nof saying the same thing, but the reversal is itself not negligible.\nThey are two opposite and mutually exclusive senses given to a single\nidentical referent. They are synonymous and yet contrasted. This is\ncalled the Center (\u4e2d zhong).\nX has to be an aspect or part of more than whatever it\nseems to be, and even as a part or aspect it cannot really be just the\nsingle selfsame (i.e., simply and bivalently same or different) part\nor aspect it appears to be.\nBut it also does and must seem to be just this and nothing\nbesides, and can appear only if initially appearing to be mutually\nexclusive with what it is not: to appear is to appear as something,\nwhich is to appear as finite. The whole of which any appearance is a\npart or aspect can never appear simpliciter, even in thought.\nIt is always appearing as one specific thing (or concept, or thought)\nor another.\nTo be present as X is to not be X, but such that\nthis not-X is showing itself only as X. To be\nX is to exclude non-X but only in such a way as to\nnecessarily involve non-X, which can only be done by showing\nitself exclusively as X.\nThus the Three Truths are:\n\n\nProvisional Positing: Some X is always appearing.\nEmptiness: X is not (only) X.\nThe Center (or Middle, or Mean): The simultaneity, inseparability,\nsameness-as-difference of X appearing and X not\nbeing only X (this is the Center in its simplest formulation,\nas \u201cthe exclusive Center\u201d (\u4f46\u4e2d\ndanzhong) which is itself neither Emptiness nor Provisional\nPositing, is beyond both and more ultimately real than both, but which\ncan appear as either).\n \nA further implication of the Center, called the\n\u201cNon-exclusive Center\u201d (\u4e0d\u4f46\u4e2d budan\nzhong): Any two putatively distinct things, Y and\nX, are also not-same-and-not different from one\nanother. For the Center can never appear simpliciter; it\nalways appears as some specific coherence showing itself, to which it\nis non-different. Provisional Positing is intrinsic to every instance\nof both Emptiness and the Center, and Provisional Positing is always\nsome specific provisional posit (even the abstract concept\n\u201cprovisional positing\u201d, or the abstract concept\n\u201cemptiness\u201d or \u201cthe center\u201d is still a\nspecific provisional posit.) Each provisional posit involves\nevery other provisional posit, specifically. Y is an\ninstantiation of X. X is an instantiation of\nY. All other appearances are thus\n\u201cintersubsumptive\u201d with X. The Center is thus\nultimately not beyond or more real than Emptiness or Provisional\nPositing, but is itself synonymous-as-contrasted with them, such that\njust to be Empty or to Provisionally Posited, or to be any provisional\nposit, is to be the Center, the subsumer and subsumed of all other\nprovisional posits\u2014and vice versa.\n\n",
