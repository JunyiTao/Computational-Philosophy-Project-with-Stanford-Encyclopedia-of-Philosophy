    "main_text": "Mood, Force and Convention || Force Conventionalism\n4.1 Force Conventionalism\n\n\nOne well known answer we may term force\nconventionalism. According to a strong version of this view, for\nevery speech act that is performed, there is some convention that will\nhave been invoked in order to make that speech act occur. This\nconvention transcends those imbuing words with their literal\nmeaning. Thus, force conventionalism implies that in order for use of\n\u2018I promise to meet you tomorrow at noon,\u2019 to constitute a\npromise, not only must the words used possess their standard\nconventional meanings, there must also exist a convention to the\neffect that the use, under the right conditions, of some such words as\nthese constitutes a promise. Austin seems to have held this\nview. For instance in his characterization of \u201cfelicity\nconditions\u201d for speech acts, Austin holds that for each speech\nact\n\nThere must exist an accepted conventional procedure having a certain\nconventional effect, that procedure to include the uttering of certain\nwords by certain persons in certain circumstances\u2026 (1962,\np. 14).\n\nAustin\u2019s student Searle follows him in this, writing\n\n\u2026utterance acts stand to propositional and illocutionary acts\nin the way in which, e.g., making an X on a ballot paper\nstands to voting.  (1969, p. 24)\n\nSearle goes on to clarify this commitment in averring,\n\n\u2026the semantic structure of a language may be regarded as a\nconventional realization of a series of sets of underlying\nconstitutive rules, and \u2026speech acts are acts\ncharacteristically performed by uttering sentences in accordance with\nthese sets of constitutive rules. (1969, p. 37)\n\nSearle espouses a weaker form of force conventionalism than does\nAustin in leaving open the possibility that some speech acts can be\nperformed without constitutive rules; Searle considers the case of a\ndog requesting to be let outside (1969, p. 39). Nevertheless Searle\ndoes contend that speech acts are characteristically performed by\ninvoking constitutive rules.\n",
