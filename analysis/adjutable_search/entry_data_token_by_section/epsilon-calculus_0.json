    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nBy the turn of the century David Hilbert and Henri Poincar\u00e9\nwere recognized as the two most important mathematicians of their\ngeneration. Hilbert\u2019s range of mathematical interests was broad,\nand included an interest in the foundations of mathematics: his\nFoundations of Geometry was published in 1899, and of the\nlist of questions posed to the International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1900, three addressed distinctly foundational\nissues.\n\nFollowing the publication of Russell\u2019s paradox, Hilbert\npresented an address to the Third International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1904, where, for the first time, he sketched his\nplan to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics via syntactic\nconsistency proofs. But he did not return to the subject in earnest\nuntil 1917, when he began a series of lectures on the foundations of\nmathematics with the assistance of Paul Bernays. Although Hilbert was\nimpressed by the work of Russell and Whitehead in their Principia\nMathematica, he became convinced that the logicist attempt to\nreduce mathematics to logic could not succeed, due in particular to\nthe non-logical character of their axiom of reducibility. At the same\ntime, he judged the intuitionistic rejection of the law of the\nexcluded middle as unacceptable to mathematics. Therefore, in order to\ncounter concerns raised by the discovery of the logical and\nset-theoretic paradoxes, a new approach was needed to justify modern\nmathematical methods.\n\nBy the summer of 1920, Hilbert had formulated such an approach. First,\nmodern mathematical methods were to be represented in formal deductive\nsystems. Second, these formal systems were to be proved syntactically\nconsistent, not by exhibiting a model or reducing their consistency to\nanother system, but by a direct metamathematical argument of an\nexplicit, \u201cfinitary\u201d character. The approach became known\nas\n Hilbert's program.\n The epsilon calculus was to provide the first component of this\nprogram, while his epsilon substitution method was to provide the\nsecond.\n\nThe epsilon calculus is, in its most basic form, an extension of\nfirst-order predicate logic with an \u201cepsilon operation\u201d\nthat picks out, for any true existential formula, a witness to the\nexistential quantifier. The extension is conservative in the sense\nthat it does not add any new first-order consequences. But,\nconversely, quantifiers can be defined in terms of the epsilons, so\nfirst-order logic can be understood in terms of quantifier-free\nreasoning involving the epsilon operation. It is this latter feature\nthat makes the calculus convenient for the purpose of proving\nconsistency. Suitable extensions of the epsilon calculus make it\npossible to embed stronger, quantificational theories of numbers and\nsets in quantifier-free calculi. Hilbert expected that it would be\npossible to demonstrate the consistency of such extensions.\n",
