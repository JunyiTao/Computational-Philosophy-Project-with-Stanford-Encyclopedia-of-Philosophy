    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi (b. 1743, d. 1819) was a critic of both\nmodern philosophy and its offspring (the rationalism of German late\nEnlightenment), of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, of\nFichte\u2019s systematic philosophy, and eventually of\nSchelling\u2019s idealism. He was initially not regarded as a\nfirst\u2013rate philosopher, but he had the natural talent of asking\nthe right question: has philosophy forgotten the difference between\nconditions of conceptualization and conditions of existence? Has it\nforgotten that explanations must start with what cannot be further\nexplained? Has it forgotten that thinking and being are different?\nJacobi intended to amend this mistake; hence he channeled his efforts\ntoward a philosophical definition of existence. By focusing on\nexistence, in the form of the individual agent, his philosophy drew a\nsolitary path that led to the universe of the living, populated by\nsingular subjects, a personal God, and a divine order of values.\nJacobi put in circulation expressions and themes that resonate to this\nday (di Giovanni, 1994: 115).\n\nHe was the one who forged the philosophical meaning of the concept of\n\u2018nihilism,\u2019 marking a difference from its religious\nconnotation. In his vocabulary, nihilism was the necessary outcome of\nall philosophy after Aristotle. Though he never considered himself an\nirrationalist, he was accused of attacking reason and reintroducing\nconservative values. In truth, he criticized the instrumental use of\nreason and the discursive shape of reasoning. Instead, he promoted a\ndifferent array of notions that would eventually unearth the\npossibility to conceive reality anew.\n",
