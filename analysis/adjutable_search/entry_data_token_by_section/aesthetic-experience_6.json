    "main_text": "Mental aspects of aesthetic experience || Pleasure\n2.1 Pleasure\n\nAlmost all agree that pleasure is a typical aspect of aesthetic\nexperience (for exceptions see Carroll 2006, Adorno 1970 [1997]). But\nnot all agree that it is an essential or even necessary aspect of\naesthetic experience (those who do not include Levinson 1996c, Stecker\n2005, and Peacocke 2021).\n\nIs it possible to explain the source of such pleasure in aesthetic\nexperience? It\u2019s not obvious that it should be possible,\nespecially on the view that art has no function and aesthetic\nexperience no further purpose (see Section 2.5). One option is simply\nto delineate the particular type of pleasure that makes aesthetic\nexperience what it is\u2014and thereby count on an\ninterlocutor\u2019s recognition of that type of\npleasure\u2014without explaining its source. In the\n\u201caestheticist\u201d or \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d\nmovement amongst Romantic poets and essayists (Gautier 1835\u20136\n[2005], Poe 1850 [1984], Baudelaire 1857 [1965], Pater 1873 [1986];\nfor overview see Guyer 2014b, Ch.6), many took this particular stance,\nespecially to rebel against those (like Ruskin 1843\u201360 [2004])\nwho took the point of art to be moral in nature.\n\nIt is more common, however, to claim that aesthetic experience\ninvolves pleasure taken in some further aspect of aesthetic\nexperience. There are a few distinct proposed sources of pleasure in\naesthetic experience. First, we might take pleasure in positive\nevaluation of an object or its creator. Second, we might enjoy the\nactivity of our own minds, including the free play of our faculties.\nThird, we might feel joyful relief in being liberated, at least\ntemporarily, from certain practical pressures or domination. Fourth,\nwe might take pleasure in coming to know or understand something in\naesthetic experience. Fifth, and finally, we might take pleasure in a\nspecial connection to others made available in aesthetic experience in\nparticular.\n\nVarious theories of aesthetic experience combine these claims in\nconsistent ways; it is possible to think that there are several\ngrounds for the total pleasure involved here. Note also that\nit\u2019s consistent to take pleasure to be a necessary aspect of\naesthetic experience without claiming (i) that pleasure makes\naesthetic experience what it is, (ii) that pleasure is the\npoint or aim of aesthetic experience, or (iii) that\nan object\u2019s power to produce pleasure in us is the focus of\naesthetic experience. (For discussion of this last claim, see Section\n1.2 above).\n\nPerhaps most popular is the claim that aesthetic experience involves\npleasure because (and insofar as) it involves a positive evaluation of\nan object in some respect (see also Sections 1.1 and 1.3). The idea\nhere is that we take pleasure in an object\u2019s intrinsic value,\nits suitedness to function, its power to produce a certain kind of\nexperience, or even in the goodness and skill of its creator\n(including, perhaps, the divine).\n\nTo compliate matters, pleasure can be understood in at least two ways:\nas a phenomenological feeling with a certain positive \u201chedonic\ntone,\u201d or as a kind of pro-attitude with positive content (see\nLabukt 2012, Bramble 2013). On the former definition, it\u2019s not\nclear that any positive evaluation of an object should\ninvolve a positive frisson of feeling (Peacocke 2021, pp.\n173\u20134). Given that we can begrudgingly, enviously, or otherwise\ngrumpily attribute genuine value to things in other contexts, why\nshould positive evaluation in aesthetics necessarily involve a\npositive hedonic tone? On the latter definition, it might trivially\nfollow that aesthetic experience involves pleasure (as a pro-attitude)\nif it involves positive evaluation, but this claim has limited\ninterest. Recent work in aesthetic normativity has done significant\nwork to make sense of a combination of the two (Gorodeisky 2019, 2021;\nKriegel forthcoming).\n\nA second common claim is that pleasure in aesthetic experience derives\nfrom a biologically natural joy we take in the activity of our own\nmental faculties. This position was especially popular in the\neighteenth century among those philosophers who thought of the mind\nfundamentally in terms of a limited number of faculties like\nsensation, imagination, understanding, and reason (Baumgarten 1735\n[1954], Meier 1999, Schlegel 1795 [2001], 1798\u20131800 [1991]).\nThis view also has its own contemporary proponents (Levinson 1996b, p.\n13).\n\nThe claim that we take pleasure in mental activity can be readily\ncombined with the thought that aesthetic experience involves an\nevaluation, especially as it involves a (positive) evaluation of our\nown minds (Baumgarten 1735 [1954], Mendelssohn 1758 [1997], Feagin\n1983). But this can seem too much focused on the perceiver or\nappreciator rather than the object of aesthetic experience itself.\n\nA famous version of this second claim derives largely from Kant (1789\n[1987]), who argued that we take pleasure in the free play of\nour mental faculties. This pleasure has a substantive aspect, but it\nalso has a privative aspect. In the absence of a concept we apply to\nsome object of perceptual representation, our imagination and\nunderstanding are liberated from the strictures of rational,\ndiscursive thought about the things we encounter in experience. This\nliberation is itself joyful. Some philosophers, notably Friedrich\nSchiller (1795 [1989]), thought this mental liberation was the single\nfundamental source of pleasure in aesthetic experience (cf. Matherne\nand Riggle 2020).\n\nThis relates closely to a third proposed source of pleasure in\naesthetic experience: liberation from certain practical thought and\nemotion in aesthetic experience. Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) took it\nthat the basic condition of human practical life was a painful one: as\nwilling creatures, we are constantly vacillating between frustration\nof our desires and boredom in the satisfaction of them. What aesthetic\nexperience offers us is a reprieve from such suffering, a way to\nbecome a \u201cpure will-less, painless, timeless\nsubject of knowledge\u201d (\u00a734, p. 179; cf. Schelling\n1800 [1978]).\n\nInfluential modern theories focused on liberation from the influence\nof unexpressed emotions. R.G.C. Collingwood (1938 [1958]) in\nparticular thought that all experience of \u201cart proper,\u201d\nwhether as creator or appreciator involves expression of an emotion,\nand that all such expression involves clarification and transformation\nof a feeling into something whose murky domination you can now resist\nin a way you couldn\u2019t before (see Section 1.4.4 above).\n\nCollingwood explicitly distinguishes his view from another kind of\nview that takes pleasure in aesthetic experience to be a matter of\nrelease. This other view makes a process of \u201ccatharsis\u201d\ncentral to some or all aesthetic experience. Catharsis is an\nAristotelian concept; Aristotle himself used it to explain the\npleasurable release from tension we feel after a tragic drama raises\nemotions of pity and fear in us (Poetics). But it is not\nentirely clear what catharsis is.\n\nA fourth proposed source of pleasure in aesthetic experience is the\npleasure of gaining knowledge or understanding. Those who take\naesthetic experience to involve, essentially, a form of acquaintance\nwith fundamental aspects of nature tend to attribute pleasure in this\nway. But any broadly epistemic approach to aesthetic experience can\nattribute pleasure to this source, even if the knowledge or\nunderstanding gained by aesthetic experience is not necessarily of\nfundamental metaphysics. Nelson Goodman (1968 [1976]), for instance,\ntook aesthetic experience to be an encounter with a meaningful\nsymbolic object. He rejects all attempts \u201cto distinguish the\naesthetic in terms of immediate pleasure \u2026 The claim that\naesthetic pleasure is of a different and superior quality is\nnow too transparent a dodge to be taken seriously\u201d\n(p.242\u20133). But he nonetheless notes that \u201cwhat delights is\ndiscovery,\u201d so there\u2019s pleasure involved here (p.258).\n\nFinally, some trace pleasure in aesthetic experience to connection\nwith other people. This claim is particularly associated with those\nwho treat aesthetic experience as focused on expressive properties\n(see Section 1.4. above). The pleasure we take in communing with\nothers can be a matter of connecting with an artist and her own inner\nlife (Wordsworth 1802 [1984], Vischer 1873 [1994], Proust\n1913\u20131927 [2003]), or a matter of connecting with others who\nwould react to an object in the same distinctively aesthetic ways we\ndo, or both (Tolstoy 1897 [2007]).\n",
