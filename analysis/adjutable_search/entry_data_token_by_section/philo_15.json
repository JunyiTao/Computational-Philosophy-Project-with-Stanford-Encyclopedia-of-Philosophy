    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || From oikei\u00f4sis to omoi\u00f4sis\n5.1 From oikei\u00f4sis to omoi\u00f4sis\n\nOne major intellectual revolution in the passage from the Hellenistic\nperiod to Middle Platonism was a relative abandoning of the concept of\noikei\u00f4sis (natural kinship) which, originating with the\nStoics, became a foundation of ethics not only in Stoicism but also in\nEpicureanism and the late Aristotelianism of Antiochus of Ascalon. The\nHellenistic period was that of a naturalism that only the sceptic\nAcademy undertook to fight it. The great change brought by Middle\nPlatonism was the irruption of transcendence which seemed to have been\nforgotten for at least two centuries. And in the case of Philo,\ntranscendence was not only philosophical, but also religious, mainly\nthat of the God of the Bible. Philo sometimes uses the term\noikei\u00f4sis, but never in the Stoic meaning, always with\nsemantic transformations. He could not accept the idea, central in the\ndogma of oikei\u00f4sis, that children as well as animals\nare the image of nature. His own description of the world of childhood\nis a frightening one, a description Sigmund Freud would not have\nspurned. For him the main ethical purpose is to become closer and\ncloser to God, and so to be in a spiritual kinship with Him. At this\npoint, Philonian oikei\u00f4sis is not different from the\nPlatonic omoi\u00f4sis. It is not, as in Stoicism, an\ninitial impulse, indicating the path of nature, but the result of a\npious asceticism, getting rid of desire and passionate impulses. It\nhas been suggested that the resemblance to God did not have in Philo\nany concrete social or ethical consequences, but things are much more\ncomplex. He says in Decalogo 133 that murder is forbidden\nbecause of the common resemblance (omoi\u00f4sis) of all men\nto God, but it is true that he does not develop extensively the\nconsequences of this omoi\u00f4sis. In Stoicism, there is a\nkind of family relationship between human beings, since they alone\n(among animals) share reason in a world which is itself exclusively\nrational. Philo puts great weight on the specific status of Israel as\nthe only people able to see God, an etymology of which he is very\nfond. In Alexandria, anti-Semitic propagandists accused Jews of being\na group unified through their hatred of other nations, and today in\nthe scholarship, the problem of universalism in Philo is much\ndiscussed (Berthelot 2003). However, it is necessary to distinguish\nbetween the ontological level and the ethical level. Because of its\nspecific relation with God, Israel is the priest of the Nations, for\nwhom it prays and offers sacrifices (Abr. 98; Somn.\n2.163; Mos. 2.133\u2013135). At the same time, Philo never\ndenied that non-Jews could reach wisdom. For him, as well as Jews,\nGreeks and Barbarians could be ascetics of wisdom. Jewish superiority\nlies in the unique capacity to articulate the three levels: human\nindividual perfection, with the examples of the patriarchs and Moses;\nsocial perfection, that of a society ruled by the laws of Moses; and\nontological specificity, due to a deep kinship with God.\n",
