    "main_text": "A Moderate Naturalism || Intuitions, Norms, Experiments\n5.2 Intuitions, Norms, Experiments\n\nGiven that his moderate naturalism has him (agreeing and) disagreeing\nwith certain elements of both TE and more \u201cradical\u201d\nnaturalisms, it is not surprising that Goldman\u2019s position has come in for\ncriticism from both sides. Thus, for example, Feldman (1999, 2012) and\nBonJour (1994) voice doubts about whether more modest forms of NE are\nboth interesting and correct\u2014whether, that is, plausible\ninstances of the relevance of (e.g.) psychology to epistemology\naren\u2019t already accommodated by TE, and whether any genuinely\nnewsworthy bearing of (e.g.) psychology on epistemology really is\nlikely. (Goldman offers a direct response to BonJour at 1999:\n26\u201327; and many of Kornblith\u2019s arguments on behalf of\nnaturalism\u2014e.g., his 1995 and 2001\u2014can be read as a\nresponse to such objections.) Once again, however, perhaps more\ninteresting for our purposes is the internecine objection: according\nto Kornblith, the importance Goldman places upon conceptual analysis\nstands in the way of his offering a plausible account of epistemic\nnormativity.\n\nIn his review of Kornblith\u2019s 2002 book, Goldman writes that\n\u201c[o]n the question of the basis of epistemic norms, he\n[Kornblith] has a very insightful and probing discussion\u201d (2005:\n409)\u2014see the brief discussion thereof in\n Section 4.2\n above. And, of course, Goldman is hardly averse to seeing true belief\nas having the sort of instrumental value that Kornblith\u2019s\naccount of epistemic normativity features. However, as Kornblith\nwrites, \u201cin Epistemology and Cognition, empirical\nconcerns play no role at all in explaining the source of epistemic\nnormativity\u201d (2002: 140\u2013141). On that account, rather, it\nis at the foundational conceptual stage of epistemology that\nnormativity gets a foothold: our epistemic assessments are evaluative\n(Goldman 1986: 20), and give pride of place to reliability\nconsiderations, owing to the contents of the concepts which are\ndeployed therein. In short, Kornblith says, on Goldman\u2019s (1986)\naccount \u201c[n]ormative force seems to derive from semantic\nconsiderations alone\u201d (Kornblith 2002: 142). According to\nKornblith, however, such a semantic grounding for epistemic\nnormativity is unsatisfactory. In effect, it simply pushes the problem\nback: why should we care about the concepts\u2014hence, the epistemic\nstandards\u2014that we actually have (2002: 142\u2013145)?\n\nAs Kornblith acknowledges, he is not the first to raise such concerns\nabout the normative standings of results obtaining via the conceptual\nanalysis that is characteristic of TE. Stich (1990: 92\u201393), for\nexample, has raised them previously. As Stich\u2019s discussion makes\nclear, what would make the envisaged problem pressing is if there\nwere, in fact, genuine diversity in our cognitive processes, epistemic\nstandards, and/or our intuitions about cases. After all, so long as\nour actual epistemic concepts and evaluations are broadly\nreliabilist\u2014so long as \n\n\n[e]xamining folk epistemic concepts\u2026reveal[s] how truth (true\nbelief) is a primary basis for epistemic evaluation and epistemic\nachievement (Goldman 2007: 22) \n\n\n\u2014there is at the very least an important consilience\nbetween the results yielded by our conceptual investigation and the\naccount of epistemic normativity that Kornblith favors.\n\nHence the significance of certain results claimed to have been\nobtained within \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d (x-phi), itself\na recent movement within naturalistic\n philosophy.[25]\n For, according to some theorists, there is in fact widespread\ndiversity in epistemic intuitions\u2014both within individuals\n(Swain, Alexander, and Weinberg 2008) and between groups, even (as\nJennifer Nagel puts it) \u201calong such epistemically scary fault\nlines\u201d (Nagel 2012: 495) as ethnicity (Weinberg, Nichols, and\nStich 2001) and gender (Buckwalter and Stich 2011). According to those\nworking within x-phi\u2019s \u201cnegative\u201d\n program,[26]\n (putative) results such as this reveal that there is something deeply\nflawed about the method of using intuitions to inform one\u2019s\nphilosophical theory. This is the lesson that Bishop and Trout take\naway from such reported results as well. As they see it, while\npractitioners of \u201cStandard Analytic Epistemology\u201d (SAE)\ntypically regard NE as unable to accommodate epistemic normativity, it\nis in fact they who are engaged in a purely descriptive\nproject\u2014namely, the project of giving information \n\n\nabout the reflective epistemic judgments of a group of idiosyncratic,\nnon-representative people who have been trained to use highly\nspecialized epistemic concepts and patterns of thought. (Bishop and\nTrout 2005a: 704)\n\n\nIf we want a genuinely normative epistemology, Bishop and Trout\nsuggest (2005a,b), we should abandon SAE altogether and look directly\nto the empirical findings of \u201cameliorative psychology\u201d,\nwhich promises to give us insight into how we can reason\n better.[27]\n The feasibility of this project has been challenged, and on much the\nsame grounds as Goldman (e.g.) objects to Kornblith\u2019s\nview\u2014namely, because of the apparent indispensability to even an\nempirically-minded epistemology of a reliance upon intuitions, for\ninstance concerning what the relevant standard of epistemic goodness\nis (e.g., Stich 2006). And yet, if the studies mentioned\nabove are correct, it\u2019s not clear what kind of authority we\nshould grant such intuitions \u2013 or, more generally, the results\nof armchair philosophical methods such as are found within both TE and\nGoldman\u2019s brand of \u201cmoderate naturalism\u201d.\n\nHowever, those studies have been challenged. For instance, Sosa 2005,\nGoldman 2010, and Williamson 2013 raise concerns about the\ninterpretation and significance of the reported data (and, to some\nextent, about the merits of x-phi itself). Just as importantly, others\nworking within an experimental framework have raised questions about\nthose data themselves. Thus, while Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich\n(2001), for example, claimed to find significant cross-cultural\nvariation in people\u2019s epistemic intuitions, several recent studies\n(Nagel et al. 2013, Seyedsayamdost 2015, Kim and Yuan 2015)\nhave failed to replicate those results. (See too Nagel 2012, 2013;\nNagel and Boyd 2014.) In fact, in his most recent work on the subject,\nStich \u2013 along with his coauthors (see Machery et al.\n2015) \u2013 has argued for the cross-cultural robustness of\ncertain epistemic intuitions, suggesting that these \u201cmay be a\nreflection of an underlying innate and universal core folk\nepistemology.\u201d Like NE itself, x-phi raises pressing issues\nabout philosophical methodology and remains the focus of lively\ndebate. The most recent findings just mentioned, however, illustrate\nhow x-phi per se is not at odds with the more traditional\nconcerns and methods that Goldman\u2019s moderate naturalism, for example,\nincorporates: an epistemological theory\u2019s being informed by conceptual\ninvestigation, or by intuitive judgments, does not automatically fate\nit to being parochial and therefore of only limited interest.\n",
