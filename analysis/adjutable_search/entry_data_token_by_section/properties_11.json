    "main_text": "Exemplification || Bradley\u2019s Regress\n2.3 Bradley\u2019s Regress\n\nOne important motivation, possibly the main one, behind attempts at\nanalysis such as the ones we have just seen is the worry to avoid the\nso-called Bradley\u2019s regress\nregarding\nexemplification (Baxter 2001: 449; Mumford 2007: 185), which goes as\nfollows. Suppose that the individual \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\). For\n\\(a\\) to instantiate \\(F\\) it must be linked to \\(F\\) by a\n(dyadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_1\\). But this requires a\nfurther (triadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_2\\), that connects\n\\(I_1, F\\) and \\(a\\), and so on without end. At each stage a further\nconnecting relation is required, and thus it seems that nothing\never gets connected to anything else (it is not clear to what\nextent Bradley had this version in mind; for references to analogous\nregresses prior to Bradley\u2019s, see Gaskin 2008: ch. 5,\n\u00a770).\n\nThis regress has traditionally been regarded as vicious (see, e.g.,\nBergmann 1960), although philosophers such as Russell (1903: \u00a755)\nand Armstrong (1997: 18\u201319) have argued that it is not. In doing\nso, however, they seem to take for granted the fact that \\(a\\) has the\nproperty \\(F\\) (pretty much as in the brute fact approach;\nsee below) and go on to see \\(a\\)\u2019s and \\(F\\)\u2019s\ninstantiating \\(I_1\\) as a further fact that is merely\nentailed by the former, which in turn entails \\(a\\)\u2019s,\n\\(F\\)\u2019s and \\(I_1\\)\u2019s instantiating \\(I_2\\), and so on.\nThis way of looking at the matter tends to be regarded as a standard\nresponse to the regress. But those who see the regress as vicious\nassume that the various exemplification relations are introduced in an\neffort to explain the very existence of the fact that \\(a\\)\nhas the property \\(F\\). Hence, from their explanatory standpoint,\ntaking the fact in question as an unquestioned ground for a chain of\nentailments is beside the point (cf. Loux 1998: 31\u201336;\nVallicella 2002).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this perspective suggests a\ndistinction between an \u201cinternalist\u201d and an\n\u201cexternalist\u201d version of the regress (in the terminology\nof Orilia 2006a). In the former, at each stage we postulate a new\nconstituent of the fact, or state of affairs, \\(s\\), that exists\ninsofar as \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\), and there is viciousness\nbecause \\(s\\) can never be appropriately\n characterized.[10]\n In the latter, at each stage we postulate a new, distinct, state of\naffairs, whose existence is required by the existence of the state of\naffairs of the previous stage. This amounts to admitting infinite\nexplanatory and metaphysical dependence chains. However, according to\nOrilia (2006b: \u00a77), since no decisive arguments against such\nchains exist, the externalist regress should not be viewed as vicious\n(for criticisms, see Maurin 2015 and Allen 2016: \u00a72.4.1; for a\nsimilar view about predication, see Gaskin 2008).\n\nA typical line for those convinced that the regress is vicious has\nconsisted in proposing that instantiation is not a relation, or at\nleast not a normal one. Some philosophers hold that it is a sui\ngeneris linkage that hooks things up without intermediaries.\nPeter Strawson (1959) calls it a non-relational tie and\nBergmann (1960) calls it a nexus. Broad (1933: 85) likened\ninstantiation to glue, which just sticks two sheets of paper\ntogether, without needing anything additional; similarly,\ninstantiation just relates. An alternative line has been to\nreject instantiation altogether. According to Frege, it is not needed,\nbecause properties have \u201cgaps\u201d that can be filled, and\naccording to a reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus,\nbecause objects and properties can be connected like links in a chain.\nHowever, both strategies are problematic, as argued by Vallicella\n(2002). His basic point is that, if \\(a\\) has property \\(F\\), we need\nan ontological explanation of why \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) happen to be\nconnected in such a way that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its properties\n(unless \\(F\\) is a property that \\(a\\) has necessarily). But none of\nthese strategies can provide this explanation. For example, the appeal\nto gaps is pointless: \\(F\\) has a gap whether or not it is filled by\n\\(a\\) (for example, it could be filled in by another object), and thus\nthe gap cannot explain the fact that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its\nproperties.\n\nBefore turning to exemplification as partial identity, Armstrong\n(1997: 118) has claimed that Bradley\u2019s regress can be avoided by\ntaking a state of affairs, say \\(x\\)\u2019s being \\(P\\), as capable\nby itself of holding together its constituents, i.e., the object \\(x\\)\nand the property \\(P\\) (see also Perovic 2016). Thus, there is no need\nto invoke a relation of exemplification linking \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) in\norder to explain how \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) succeed in giving rise to a\nunitary item, namely the state of affairs in question. There seems to\nbe a circularity here for it appears that we want to explain how an\nobject and a property come to be united in a state of affairs by\nappealing to the result of this unification, namely the state of\naffairs itself. But perhaps this view can be interpreted as simply the\nidea that states of affairs should be taken for granted in a\nprimitivist fashion without seeking an explanation of their unity by\nappealing to exemplification or otherwise; this is the brute fact\napproach, as we may call it (for supporters, see Van Inwagen\n(1993: 37) and Oliver (1996: 33); for criticisms and a possible\ndefense, see Vallicella 2002, and Orilia 2016, respectively).\n\nLowe (2006) has tried to tackle Bradley\u2019s regress within his\npluralist approach to exemplification. In his view, characterization,\ninstantiation and exemplification are \u201cformal\u201d and thus\nquite different from garden-variety relations such giving or\nloving. This guarantees that these three relations escape\nBradley\u2019s regress (Lowe 2006: 30, 80,\n 90).[11]\n Let us illustrate how, by turning back to the Fido example of\n \u00a72.1.\n What a mode instantiates and what it characterizes belong to its\nessence. In other words, a mode cannot exist without instantiating the\nattribute it instantiates and characterizing the object it\ncharacterizes. Hence, mode \\(b\\), by simply existing, instantiates\nattribute \\(B\\) and characterizes Fido. Moreover, since\nexemplification (the occurrent one, in this case) results from\n\u201ccomposing\u201d characterization and instantiation,\n\\(b\\)\u2019s existence also guarantees that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\).\nAccording to Lowe, we thus have some truths, that \\(b\\) characterizes\nFido, that \\(b\\) instantiates \\(B\\), and that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\)\n(i.e., is barking), all of which are made true by \\(b\\). Hence, there\nis no need to postulate as truthmakers states of affairs with\nconstituents, Fido and \\(b\\), related by characterization, or \\(b\\)\nand \\(B\\), related by exemplification, or Fido and \\(B\\), related by\nexemplification. This, in Lowe\u2019s opinion, eschews\nBradley\u2019s regress, since this arises precisely because we appeal\nto states of affairs with constituents in need of a glue that\ncontingently keep them together. Nevertheless, there is no loss of\ncontingency in Lowe\u2019s world picture, for an object need not be\ncharacterized by the modes that happen to characterize it. Thus, for\nexample, mode \\(b\\) might have failed to exist and there could have\nbeen a Fido silence mode in its stead, in which case the proposition\nthat Fido is barking would have been false and the proposition that\nFido is silent would have been true. One may wonder however what makes\nit the case that a certain mode is a mode of just a certain object and\nnot of another one, say another barking dog. Even granting that it is\nessential for \\(b\\) to be a mode of Fido, rather than of another dog,\nit remains true that it is of Fido, rather than of the other\ndog, and one may still think that this being of is also glue\nof some sort, perhaps with a contingency inherited from the\ncontingency of \\(b\\) (which might have failed to exist). The suspicion\nthen is that the problem of accounting for the relation between a mode\nand an object has replaced the Armstrongian one of what makes it the\ncase that a universal \\(P\\) and an object \\(x\\) make up the state of\naffairs \\(x\\)\u2019s being \\(P\\). But the former problem,\none may urge, is no less thorny than the latter, and some\nuniversalists like Armstrong may consider uneconomical Lowe\u2019s\nacceptance of tropes in addition to universals (for accounts of\nBradley\u2019s regress analogous to Lowe\u2019s, but within a\nthoroughly tropist ontology, see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n tropes.)\n\nAs it should be clear from this far from exhaustive survey,\nBradley\u2019s regress deeply worries ontologists and the attempts to\ntame it keep\n flowing.[12]\n",
