    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice || Basic Preferences\n4.3 Basic Preferences\n\nAnother approach to the comparison problem appeals to basic\npreferences. Joseph Raz takes the line that we can explain choice\nbetween irreducibly plural goods by talking about basic preferences.\nRaz approaches the issue of incommensurability by talking about the\nnature of agency and rationality instead of about the nature of value.\nHe distinguishes between two conceptions of human agency: the\nrationalist conception, and the classical conception. The rationalist\nconception corresponds to what we have called the stronger use of the\nterm rational. According to the rationalist conception, reasons\nrequire action. The classical conception, by contrast, \u201cregards\nreasons as rendering options eligible\u201d (Raz 1999, p. 47). Raz\nfavors the classical conception, which regards the will as something\nseparate from desire:\n\nThe will is the ability to choose and perform intentional actions. We\nexercise our will when we endorse the verdict of reason that we must\nperform an action, and we do so, whether willingly, reluctantly, or\nregretting the need, etc. According to the classical conception,\nhowever, the most typical exercise or manifestation of the will is in\nchoosing among options that reason merely renders eligible. Commonly\nwhen we so choose, we do what we want, and we choose what we want,\nfrom among the eligible options. Sometimes speaking of wanting one\noption (or its consequences) in preference to the other eligible ones\nis out of place. When I choose one tin of soup from a row of identical\ntins in the shop, it would be wrong and misleading to say that I\nwanted that tin rather than, or in preference to, the others.\nSimilarly, when faced with unpalatable but unavoidable and\nincommensurate options (as when financial need forces me to give up\none or another of incommensurate goods), it would be incorrect to say\nthat I want to give up the one I choose to give up. I do not want to\ndo so. I have to, and I would equally have regretted the loss of\neither good. I simply choose to give up one of them. (Raz, 1999, p.\n48)\n\n\nRaz\u2019s view about the nature of agency is defended in great\ndetail over the course of many articles, and all of those arguments\ncannot be examined in detail here. What is crucial in the context of\nthis discussion of pluralism is whether Raz gives us a satisfactory\naccount of the weaker sense of rational. Raz\u2019s solution to the\nproblem of incommensurability hangs on the claim that it can be\nrational (in the weak sense) to choose A over B when there are no\nfurther reasons favouring A over B. We shall restrict ourselves to\nmentioning one objection to the view in the context of moral choices\nbetween plural goods. Though Raz\u2019s account of choice may seem\nplausible in cases where we choose between non-moral values, it seems\nto do violence to the concept of morality. Consider one of Raz\u2019s\nown examples, the choice between a banana and a pear. It may be that\none has to choose between them, and there is no objective reason to\nchoose one or the other. In this case, it seems Raz\u2019s account of\nchoice is plausible. If one feels like eating a banana, then in this\ncase, desire does provide a reason. As Raz puts it, \u201cA want can\nnever tip the balance of reasons in and of itself. Rather, our wants\nbecome relevant when reasons have run their course.\u201d In the\nexample where we choose between a banana and a pear, this sounds fine.\nHowever, if we apply it to a moral choice it seems a lot less\nplausible. Raz admits that \u201cIf of the options available to\nagents in typical situations of choice and decision, several are\nincommensurate, then reason can neither determine nor completely\nexplain their choices or actions\u201d (Raz, 1999, p. 48). Thus many\nmoral choices are not directed by reason but by a basic preference. It\nis not fair to call it a desire, because on Raz\u2019s account we\ndesire things for reasons\u2014we take the object of our desire to be\ndesirable. On Raz\u2019s picture then, when reasons have run their\ncourse, we are choosing without reasons. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhugely whether we call that \u2018rational\u2019 (it is not rational\nin the strong sense, but it is in the weak sense). What matters is\nwhether this weak sense of rational is sufficient to satisfy our\nconcept of moral choice as being objectively defensible. The problem\nis that choosing without reasons look rather like plumping. Plumping\nmay be an intelligible form of choice, but it is questionable whether\nit is a satisfactory account of moral choice.\n",
