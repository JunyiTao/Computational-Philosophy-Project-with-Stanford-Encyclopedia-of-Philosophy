    "main_text": "Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons || Developmental Findings\n7. Conclusion\n\nSince the late 1980s, ST has received a great amount of attention from\nphilosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists. This is not\nsurprising. Mindreading is a central human cognitive capacity, and ST\nchalleges some basic assumptions about the cognitive processes and\nneural mechanisms underlying human social behavior. Moreover, ST\ntouches upon a number of major philosophical problems, such as the\nrelation between self-knowledge and knowledge of other minds, and the\nnature of mental concepts, including the concept of mind itself. In\nthis entry, we have considered some of the fundamental empirical and\nphilosophical issues surrounding ST. Many of them remain open. In\nparticular, while the consensus view is now that both mental\nsimulation and theorizing play important role in mindreading, the\ncurrently available evidence falls short of establishing what their\nrespective roles are. In other words, it is likely that we shall end\nup adopting a hybrid model of mindreading that combines ST and TT,\nbut, at the present stage, it is very difficult to predict what this\nhybrid model will look like. Hopefully, the joint work of philosophers\nand cognitive scientists will help to settle the matter.\n",
