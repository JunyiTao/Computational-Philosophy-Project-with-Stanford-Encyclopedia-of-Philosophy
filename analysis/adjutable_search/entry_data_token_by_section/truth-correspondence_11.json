    "main_text": "Modified Versions of the Correspondence Theory || Logical \u201cSubatomism\u201d\n7.2 Logical \u201cSubatomism\u201d\n\n\nLogical atomism aims at getting by without logically complex\ntruthmakers by restricting definitions like (1) or (2) from Section 3\nto elementary truthbearers and accounting for the truth-values of\nmolecular truthbearers recursively in terms of their logical structure\nand atomic truthmakers (atomic facts, events,\nobjects-plus-tropes). More radical modifications of the correspondence\ntheory push the recursive strategy even further, entirely discarding\ndefinitions like (1) or (2), and hence the need for atomic\ntruthmakers, by going, as it were,\n\u201csubatomic\u201d.\n\n\nSuch accounts analyze truthbearers, e.g., sentences, into their\nsubsentential constituents and dissolve the relation of correspondence\ninto appropriate semantic subrelations: names refer to, or\ndenote, objects; predicates (open sentences) apply to, or are\nsatisfied by objects. Satisfaction of complex predicates can\nbe handled recursively in terms of logical structure and satisfaction\nof simpler constituent predicates: an object o satisfies\n\u2018x is not F\u2019 iff o does not\nsatisfy \u2018x is F\u2019; o satisfies\n\u2018x is F or x is G\u2019\niff o satisfies \u2018x is F\u2019\nor o satisfies \u2018x is G\u2019; and so\non. These recursions are anchored in a base-clause addressing the\nsatisfaction of primitive predicates: an object o\nsatisfies \u2018x is F\u2019 iff o\ninstantiates the property expressed by \u2018F\u2019. Some\nwould prefer a more nominalistic base-clause for satisfaction, hoping\nto get by without seriously invoking properties. Truth for singular\nsentences, consisting of a name and an arbitrarily complex predicate,\nis defined thus: A singular sentence is true iff the object denoted by\nthe name satisfies the predicate. Logical machinery provided by Tarski\n(1935) can be used to turn this simplified sketch into a more general\ndefinition of truth\u2014a definition that handles sentences\ncontaining relational predicates and quantifiers and covers molecular\nsentences as well. Whether Tarski\u2019s own definition of truth can\nbe regarded as a correspondence definition, even in this modified\nsense, is under debate (cf. Popper 1972; Field 1972, 1986; Kirkham\n1992, chaps. 5-6; Soames 1999; K\u00fcnne 2003, chap. 4; Patterson\n2008.)\n\n\nSubatomism constitutes a return to (broadly) object-based\ncorrespondence. Since it promises to avoid facts and all similarly\narticulated, sentence-like slices of reality, correspondence theorists\nwho take seriously objection 3.F2 favor this approach: not even\nelementary truthbearers are assigned any matching truthmakers. The\ncorrespondence relation itself has given way to two semantic relations\nbetween constituents of truthbearers and objects: reference (or\ndenotation) and satisfaction\u2014relations central to any semantic\ntheory. Some advocates envision causal accounts of reference and\nsatisfaction (cf.  Field 1972; Devitt 1982, 1984; Schmitt 1995;\nKirkham 1992, chaps. 5-6).  It turns out that relational predicates\nrequire talk of satisfaction by ordered sequences of\nobjects. Davidson (1969, 1977) maintains that satisfaction by\nsequences is all that remains of the traditional idea of\ncorrespondence to facts; he regards reference and satisfaction as\n\u201ctheoretical constructs\u201d not in need of causal, or any,\nexplanation.\n\nProblems: (a) The subatomistic approach\naccounts for the truth-values of molecular truthbearers in the same\nway as the atomistic approach; consequently, molecular truthbearers\nthat are not truth-functional still pose the same problems as in\natomism. (b) Belief attributions and modal claims pose\nspecial problems; e.g., it seems that \u201cbelieves\u201d is a\nrelational predicate, so that \u201cJohn believes that snow is\nwhite\u201d is true iff \u201cbelieves\u201d is satisfied by John\nand the object denoted by \u201cthat snow is white\u201d; but the\nlatter appears to be a proposition or state of affairs, which\nthreatens to let in through the back-door the very sentence-like\nslices of reality the subatomic approach was supposed to avoid, thus\nundermining the motivation for going subatomic. (c) The\nphenomenon of referential indeterminacy threatens to undermine the\nidea that the truth-values of elementary truthbearers are always\ndetermined by the denotation and/or satisfaction of their\nconstituents; e.g., pre-relativistic uses of the term\n\u201cmass\u201d are plausibly taken to lack determinate reference\n(referring determinately neither to relativistic mass nor to rest\nmass); yet a claim like \u201cThe mass of the earth is greater than\nthe mass of the moon\u201d seems to be determinately true even when\nmade by Newton (cf. Field 1973).\n\nProblems for both versions of modified correspondence\ntheories: (a) It is not known whether an entirely\ngeneral recursive definition of truth, one that covers all\ntruthbearers, can be made available. This depends on unresolved issues\nconcerning the extent to which truthbearers are amenable to the kind\nof structural analyses that are presupposed by the recursive\nclauses. The more an account of truth wants to exploit the internal\nstructure of truthbearers, the more it will be hostage to the\n(limited) availability of appropriate structural analyses of the\nrelevant truthbearers. (b) Any account of truth employing a\nrecursive framework may be virtually committed to taking sentences\n(maybe sentences of the language of thought) as primary\ntruthbearers. After all, the recursive clauses rely heavily on what\nappears to be the logico-syntactic structure of truthbearers, and it\nis unclear whether anything but sentences can plausibly be said to\npossess that kind of structure. But the thesis that sentences of any\nsort are to be regarded as the primary truthbearers is\ncontentious. Whether propositions can meaningfully be said to have an\nanalogous (albeit non-linguistic) structure is under debate\n(cf. Russell 1913, King 2007). (c) If clauses like\n\u201c\u2018p or q\u2019 is true iff\n\u2018p\u2019 is true or \u2018q\u2019 is\ntrue\u201d are to be used in a recursive account of our\nnotion of truth, as opposed to some other notion, it has to\nbe presupposed that \u2018or\u2019 expresses disjunction:\none cannot define \u201cor\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d at the same\ntime. To avoid circularity, a modified correspondence theory (be it\natomic or subatomic) must hold that the logical connectives can be\nunderstood without reference to correspondence truth.\n",
