    "main_text": "Essence and Existence || The Existent as Primary\n3.1 The Existent as Primary\n\nThe first step in the analysis of the existent\n (al-maw\u01e7\u016bd)[6]\n is to acknowledge its absolute priority: the existent as such is\nindefinable (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u201331,9; cf.\nI, 2, 13, 8\u201313): everything implies the notion of the existent\nand cannot exist outside of it. In fact, whereas a definition serves\nto answer the question about the quiddity (m\u0101hiyya: what\nis it: m\u0101 huwa?) of a thing, the existent as such cannot\nhave a quiddity (one cannot investigate its m\u0101hiyya:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2,13,\n 8\u201313).[7]\n In order to ask what a thing is, one cannot avoid referring to being,\nwhich is exactly what allows us to conceive all things, whether they\nare sensible, imaginary or intelligible, as existent. According to\nAvicenna\u2019s formula, which had a great impact on Thomas Aquinas\n(and on medieval Western philosophy in general), the existent\nis\u2014together with the thing, the necessary and the one\u2014one\nof the \u201cintentions\u201d (ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b;\nintentiones) that are \u201cimprinted in the soul in a primary\nway\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u20136; 30,\n3\u20134).\n\nThe primacy of being (everything that is conceived of\n\u201cis\u201d) leads to an often unseen consequence: everything\nthat is conceived of or simply mentally represented exists\nand hence has at least a mental existence (which means either\nintellectual or imaginary or estimative). Indeed, the existent as such\nis immaterial and only non-existence in the absolute sense does\n(obviously) not exist, since it cannot be either conceived or\ndiscussed (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32, 6\u201316).\nNon-existent things are only relatively non-existent: resurrection,\ne.g., and possible and imaginary entities exist at least in the mind\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 33, 12\u201334, 9; cf. Arist.,\nMetaph., 1006b10). Impossible things seem to be non-existent\ninsofar as they are not properly conceived (intellectual existence is\ndistinct from imaginative existence: Michot 1987; Black 1997,\n1999).\n\nTogether with the distinction between mental and external existence\n(or existence in concrete individuals: f\u012b\nl-\u02bfay\u0101n) Avicenna posits a distinction between the\nbeing of the thing and its existence. Clearly, then,\nthe fundamental and primary character of being does not imply\nsimplicity: to exist means to be a given entity in\nthe world or\u2014as Avicenna also uses it\u2014a\n\u201cthing\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5). The\nexistence of something must thus be distinguished from its being what\nit is.\n\nIn Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5 Avicenna summarizes the meanings\nof the term maw\u01e7\u016bd (\u201cexistent\u201d) and of\nthe locutions that are related to it: \u201cthing\u201d\n (\u0161ay\u02be),[8]\n but also \u201cwhat\u201d (m\u0101), \u201cthat\u201d\n(alla\u1e0f\u012b), \u201cwhat is given\u201d or\n\u201crealized\u201d (al-mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al) and\n\u201cwhat is affirmed\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d\n(al-mu\u1e6fbat). On the one hand, there are the existent\nand the thing as first notions: both indicate being as what cannot be\nknown through anything other than itself, so that knowledge is built\non it. On the other, there is what the word \u201cthing\u201d may\nalso indicate in every language: \u201cthe reality whereby every\nthing (amr) is what it is\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31, 5\u20136; cf. VI, 5, 292,\n1\u20135). \n",
