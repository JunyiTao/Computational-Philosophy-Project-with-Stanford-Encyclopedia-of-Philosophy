    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty\n2. Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty\n\nEach of the views sketched below has many expressions, some of which\nmay be incompatible with one another. In many or perhaps most of the\nactual formulations, elements of more than one such account are\npresent. For example, Kant\u2019s treatment of beauty in terms of\ndisinterested pleasure has obvious elements of hedonism, while the\necstatic neo-Platonism of Plotinus includes not only the unity of the\nobject, but also the fact that beauty calls out love or adoration.\nHowever, it is also worth remarking how divergent or even incompatible\nwith one another many of these views are: for example, some\nphilosophers associate beauty exclusively with use, others precisely\nwith uselessness.\n",
