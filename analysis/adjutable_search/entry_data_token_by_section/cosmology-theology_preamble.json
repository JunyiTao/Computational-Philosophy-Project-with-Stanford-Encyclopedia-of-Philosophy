    "main_text": "\n\nAs long as humans have been trying to make sense of the universe, they\nhave been proposing cosmological theories. Furthermore, the notion of\na deity often plays a central role in these cosmological theories.\nAccording to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole creator and\nsustainer of the universe.\n\nBut the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of\ncosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the\ndemarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific\ncosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is\nformalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What\nhas this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often\ntheistic) cosmologies? Has the new cosmology replaced the older\ncosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older\ncosmologies?\n\nOur subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to the\ncase of western monotheism\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and\nIslam\u2014and even more specifically to variants of Christianity.\nEven so, we note a wide range of diversity among Christian beliefs and\nChristian attitudes towards science in general, and towards scientific\ncosmology in particular. At one extreme, we find ultra-traditional\nversions of Christianity that emphasize literal interpretation of\nScripture, and that often interpret theological doctrines in terms of\nancient Greek philosophical categories (e.g., God as eternal,\nunchangeable, etc.). Even within this more traditional camp, we find\ndifferences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount of\nflexibility with regard to traditional theological doctrines. (e.g.,\nthere are ongoing debates among traditional theologians about the\nrelation of God to time.) At another extreme, we find more recent\nincarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on ideas from German\nidealism and/or process philosophy. There are also subtle, but not\nnegligible, differences in attitude among Protestant, Roman Catholic,\nand Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not think of theism as\none fixed set of doctrines that is simply consistent or inconsistent\nwith scientific cosmology.\n\nFurthermore, even though most theological interactions with cosmology\nhave taken place within the Christian tradition, it has\nrarely\u2014if ever\u2014been the case that the defining feature of\nChristianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any explicit\nrole in these interactions.\n",
