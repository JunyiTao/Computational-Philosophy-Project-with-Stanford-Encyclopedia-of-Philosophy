    "main_text": "Arguments for Compositionality || Productivity\n3.1 Productivity\n\nThe argument most often used to support compositionality is based on\nproductivity. It goes back (at least) to Frege, who claimed that \n\n\nthe possibility of our understanding sentences which we have never\nheard before rests evidently on this, that we can construct the sense\nof a sentence out of parts that correspond to words. (Frege [c. 1914]\n1980: 79) \n\n\nThe argument is an inference to the best explanation, which can be\nexpanded and rephrased without assuming that meanings are Fregean\n senses.[16]\n\nArgument from productivity: Since competent speakers can\nunderstand a complex expression e they never encountered\nbefore, it must be that they (perhaps tacitly) know something on the\nbasis of which they can figure out, without any additional\ninformation, what e means. If this is so, something they\nalready know must determine what e means. And this knowledge\ncannot plausibly be anything but knowledge of the structure of\ne and knowledge of the individual meanings of the simple\nconstituents of e.\n\n\nTo bolster the claim that we do, in fact, understand complex\nexpressions we never heard before, philosophers often appeal to\nunboundedness: although we are finite beings we have the\ncapacity to understand each of an infinitely large set of complex\nexpressions. Although there are dissenters\u2014e.g., Ziff (1974) \nand Pullum & Scholz (2010)\u2014the claim that natural languages \ncontain infinitely many complex expressions is\n plausible.[17]\n But it is equally plausible that nobody who reads this entry the\nfirst time has ever encountered this very sentence before, and\nconsequently, the detour through cardinality considerations seems\nsuperfluous. Occasionally, the fact that natural languages are\nlearnable is also used to argue for compositionality. This is\nnot an independent argument: the reason it is remarkable that we can\nlearn a natural language is that once we have learnt it our\nunderstanding is productive. If we could not understand expressions we\nnever encountered before, without detailed empirical study we could\nnot rule out the hypothesis that we learned the language in question\nby rote.\n\nThe first thing to point out about the argument from productivity is\nthat it is an argument in favor of\n (C)\u2014global\n distributive language-bound compositionality of meaning. As it\nstands, it provides no reason for believing anything this principle\ndoes not entail; in particular it cannot establish\n (C\\(_{\\textit{ref}}\\)),\n (C\\(_{\\textit{local}}\\)), or\n (C\\(_{\\textit{cross}}\\)).\n \n\nThe argument can be criticized on the ground that considerations of\nthis sort simply cannot establish a universal claim. Suppose someone\nsuggests that the complex expression e is a counterexample to\n (C).\n The fact that we tend to understand all sorts of complex expressions\nwe never heard before does not mean that we would understand e\non the first encounter. But suppose we would. Still, even if in\ngeneral we tend to understand complex expressions we never heard\nbefore in virtue of our knowledge of their structure and the meanings\nof their simple constituents, we might understand e in some\nother way. General considerations of productivity cannot rule out\nisolated exceptions to compositionality. \n\nIsolated putative\nexceptions are called idioms\u2014 and natural languages contain many of them. (Jackendoff (1997) estimates the number of English idioms to be around twenty-five thousand. Defenders of the compositionality of natural languages sometimes argue that the syntactic complexity of these expressions is only apparent, and hence, they can be viewed as lexical items. But unless we are given clear\nnon-semantic grounds for singling out idioms, the move is\nquestion-begging. Such criteria have been proposed, but they tend to\nbe rather controversial; cf. Nunberg, Sag, and Wasow (1994).)\n\nIf we lower our sights and seek to prove nothing more than the claim\nthat natural languages by and large obey global distributive\nlanguage-bound compositionality of meaning, the argument from\nproductivity is reasonably strong.\n",
