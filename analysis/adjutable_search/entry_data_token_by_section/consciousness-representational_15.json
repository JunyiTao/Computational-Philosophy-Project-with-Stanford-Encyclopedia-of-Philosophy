    "main_text": "Objections to the Representational Theory || \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality\u201d\n4.3 \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality\u201d\n\nTerry Horgan and co-authors, beginning with Horgan (2000) and Horgan\nand Tienson (2002), inaugurated the \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality\nResearch Program.\u201d (The view was anticipated by Siewert (1998),\nand see, e.g., the essays collected in Kriegel (2013), as well as\nMendelovici (2018).) It was inspired in part by an idea of\nLoar\u2019s (1987, 2003), but its approach is different and its\nclaims are much more ambitious. Its proponents defend an internal,\nnarrow type of intentionality that (Horgan and Tienson say) is not\nonly determined by phenomenology but is constituted by it\n(pp. 520, 524); indeed, they contend (p. 529) that their internal\nintentionality is \u201cthe fundamental kind of\nintentionality: the narrow, phenomenal kind that is a prerequisite for\nwide content and wide truth conditions.\u201d And by\n\u201cphenomenal,\u201d they seem to mean \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d properties in the higher-order sense.\n\nThis would imply that \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d properties\nare conceptually or at least metaphysically prior to intentionality.\nPut together with representationalism about sensory qualities, it\nwould follow that \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d properties are\nprior to those, which is quite contrary to the spirit of (though not\nflatly incompatible with) representationalism, and certainly it poses\na general threat of circularity. Moreover, some proponents concede\nthat it is anti-naturalistic and may require a departure from\nmaterialism; but Mendelovici and Bourget (2014) argue that\nnaturalistic considerations actually favor phenomenal\nintentionality.\n\nAn obvious objection is that many perceptual states and other clearly\nintentional occurrent states are not conscious in sense (1) above;\ntheir subjects are entirely unaware of them, and they have no\nphenomenology at all. Kriegel (2011) replies, contending that the\nintentionality of such states is not \u201cintrinsic\u201d but\n\u201cinterpretivist,\u201d merely charitable interpretation\n\u00e0 la Donald Davidson and D.C. Dennett. Mendelovici (2018, Ch.\n8) reviews several further strategies and proposes a combination of\nthose.\n\nA further objection is that since phenomenal intentionality is narrow,\nthe view cannot account for the wide intentionality of everyday mental\nstates. Proponents reply either that wide \u201ccontents\u201d are\nnot really contents (e.g., Horgan and Tienson, Bourget (2010)), or\nthat they are derived in a deflationary way from the narrow phenomenal\ncontents (e.g., Siewert, Kriegel, Farkas (2008)). \n\nThe \u201cphenomenal intentionality\u201d view will have to be\nconsidered on its merits, and after we have seen what account it\naffords of the sensory qualities. (However, it blocks any direct\nargument for representationalism based on transparency. Indeed,\nKriegel (2007, p. 321) appeals to transparency in support of\nphenomenal intentionality.) For further discussion, see the entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.\n",
