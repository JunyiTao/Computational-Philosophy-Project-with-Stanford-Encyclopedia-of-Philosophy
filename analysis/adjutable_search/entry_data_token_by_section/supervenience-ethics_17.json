    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism || Ethical explanations of ethical supervenience\n4.5 Ethical explanations of ethical supervenience\n\nSeveral philosophers have suggested that we can offer ethical\nexplanations of the supervenience relation (Kramer 2009, Ch. 10; Olson\n2014, \u00a75.1, Scanlon 2014, 38ff; other philosophers, such as\nDworkin 1996 and Blackburn 1998, 311 also appear committed to this\nidea; for discussion see Tiefensee 2014). For example, one might think\nthat the dictum treat like cases alike! is an ethical\nrequirement of ethical reasoning. Or one might think that all ethical\ntruths are grounded in certain fundamental ethical truths that are\nrelational: for example, a fundamental truth might be that it is wrong\nto torture someone purely for fun. This truth states a relationship\nbetween ethical and non-ethical properties. If all ethical facts are\nexplained by such fundamental ethical truths, then these truths could\nseemingly explain why there are supervenience relations between\nethical and base properties.\n\nOne worry about this strategy is that one might take a mark of ethical\nrealism to be commitment to a truthmaker thesis, according to which\nethical truths are metaphysically explained by (or grounded in) the\npatterns of instantiation of ethical properties. The ethical\nexplanation strategy seems to invert this intuitive order of\nexplanation, by having the distribution of ethical properties\nexplained by ethical truths.\n\nSuppose that we rejected this idea in an especially radical way,\ninsisting instead on the reverse order of metaphysical explanation\neverywhere. The nature of every property, we might say, is wholly\ngrounded in some relevant subset of the true propositions. Provided\nthat we can recover the idea of metaphysical explanation within this\nframework, we will be able to isolate the set of propositions that\nstate metaphysically unexplained necessary connections. And it is\nnatural to think that the brute necessities worry could be expressed\nwithin this framework as objecting to accepting such propositions. The\nproblem is that fundamental normative principles, as invoked\nin the \u2018ethical explanation\u2019 strategy, would seem to be of\nexactly the objectionable sort.\n",
