    "main_text": "Economics and ethics\n6. Economics and ethics\n\nAs discussed above in\n Section 2.1\n most economists distinguish between positive and normative economics,\nand most would argue that economics is relevant to policy mainly\nbecause of the (positive) information it provides concerning the\nconsequences of policy. Yet the same economists also offer their\nadvice concerning how to fix the economy, and there is a whole field\nof normative economics.\n\nEconomic outcomes, institutions, and processes may be better or worse\nin several different ways. Some outcomes may make people better off.\nOther outcomes may be less unequal. Others may restrict individual\nfreedom more severely. Economists typically evaluate outcomes\nexclusively in terms of welfare. This does not imply that they believe\nthat only welfare is of moral importance. They focus on welfare,\nbecause they believe that economics provides an excellent set of tools\nto address questions of welfare and because they hope that questions\nabout welfare can be separated from questions about equality, freedom,\nor justice. As sketched below, economists have had some things to say\nabout other dimensions of moral appraisal, but welfare takes center\nstage. Indeed normative economics is standardly called \u201cwelfare\neconomics.\u201d\n",
