    "main_text": "Later Conceptual Developments and Modern Chinese Epistemology || Pre-modern Methodologies\n5.1 Pre-modern Methodologies\n\nAt the threshold of the 18th century, Chinese\nepistemologists sought to establish a new analytical and critical\nmethodology for \u201cexploring things (gewu).\u201d\nSimilar tendencies could be observed already in Wang Fuzhi\u2019s and\nGu Yanwu\u2019s (1613\u20131682) notion of evidence\n(kaozheng \u8003\u8b49). Gradually, they acquired greater\nimportance within the framework of new practice-oriented\napproaches.\n\nWang and Gu profoundly influenced the epistemology of the School of\nPractical Learning (Xi zhai) which consisted of two main\ncurrents; the most important representatives of the first, Yan Yuan\n(1635\u20131704) and Li Gong (1659\u20131746), followed the\nessential approaches of Huang Zongxi (1610\u20131695) and Wang Fuzhi,\nwhile the chief proponent of the second, the philosopher Dai Zhen,\nfounded his epistemological system upon Gu Yanwu\u2019s methodology.\nTheir emphasis on the practical, physical aspects of knowledge and the\nsignificance of sensations led them to rehabilitate human feelings,\ninclinations and desires as a driving force that motivated human\nbeings to seek knowledge. By so doing, they unknowingly prepared the\nterrain for the later Chinese understanding of the European notion of\nthe individual as the subject of comprehension.\n\nDai Zhen is widely considered to be the first Chinese philosopher to\nhave described the relation between the subject and object of\ncomprehension by defining the subject\u2019s potential for\ncomprehension as a tool, which can be compared to light that makes\nobjects visible. Xia Zhentao (1996b: 405) especially indicates his\nelaboration of the notions of the potential for comprehension (xin\nzhi shenming \u5fc3\u4e4b\u795e\u660e), elucidation,\nexposure and illumination (zhao \u7167). Xia stresses that\nDai\u2019s reflective method, by which reality is perceived through\nits reflection (fanying \u53cd\u6620) in the human mind,\npertains to basic theories of materialistic epistemology, given that\nthe objective reality (which is external to the subject of\ncomprehension) is seen as a necessary precondition of reflection (Xia\n1996b: 405).\n\nAt this point we should mention China\u2019s first encounter with\nWestern thought, which slowly began to seep into the Middle Kingdom at\nthat time. During the 18th century, the Jesuit influence on\nthe Chinese academic world grew steadily.\n\nHence, Tan Sitong (1865\u20131898) believed that the central\nConfucian virtue of humaneness (ren) is not merely an\nethical, but also an epistemological term that determines the social\nfunction of the basic stuff of which everything is composed, namely of\nether, which makes it possible for people to experience circulation\n(tong \u901a), i.e., one of the principal components in the\nprocess of comprehension. In accordance with this mechanistic\nunderstanding of concrete reality, circulation provides both the inner\nand external conditions of perceiving, comprehending and transmitting\nreality. In terms of inwardness, circulation makes the harmonic,\ncoordinated operation of the senses (wu guan\n\u4e94\u5b98), brain (nao \u8166) and nervous system\n(nao qi jin \u8166\u6c23\u7b4b) possible. Tan Sitong\nwas one of the first Chinese scholars who accepted the Western notion\nthat mind and consciousness arise from the brain and not from the\nheart (xin), as was widely believed in traditional China.\n",
