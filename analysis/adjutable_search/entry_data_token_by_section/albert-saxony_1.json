    "main_text": "Logic\n2. Logic\n\nOn most topics the Logica (a text based on lectures first\ngiven before 1356 and finally revised for publication before 1360) is\ninfluenced by Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae, though it offers\nan independent approach in the treatises on obligations, insolubles,\nand consequences, which had assumed greater importance during this\nperiod. As has been known for some time, this work is a remarkable\nhandbook organized into six treatises: the first defines the elements\nof propositions; the second treats of the properties of terms; the\nthird of the truth conditions of different types of proposition; the\nfourth of consequences (including syllogisms, and in fact adding to it\nthe theory of topics); the fifth of fallacies; and the sixth of\ninsolubles and obligations.\n\nIn the first part of the Logica, which sets out the\nterminology of the entire text, Albert returns to the Ockhamist\nconception of the sign and in so doing distances himself from the\nposition defended by Buridan. After clearly including the term (an\nelement of the proposition) in the genus of signs \u2014 by which he\nprovides, in the tradition of Ockham, a semiotic approach to\nlogico-linguistic analysis \u2014 he establishes signification\nthrough a referential relation to a singular thing, defining the\nrelation of spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination.\nHe is also an Ockhamist in his conception of universals, which he\nregards as spoken or conceptual signs, and in his theory of\nsupposition, which essentially restates the Ockhamist divisions of\nsupposition, despite of some refinements as descensus\ncopulatim, perhaps influenced by Heytesbury. In particular, he\nrestores the notion of simple supposition \u2014 i.e., the reference\nof a term to the concept to which it is subordinated, when it\nsignifies an extra-mental thing \u2014 which is criticized and\nrejected by Buridan. Finally, Albert is close to the Venerabilis\nInceptor in his theory of the categories, where he refuses to\nconsider quantity as something absolutely real, reducing it instead to\na disposition of substance and quality. Albert in fact contributed as\nmuch as Ockham to the spread of this conception of the relation\nbetween substance and quantity in natural philosophy in Paris and\nItaly.\n\nAlbert\u2019s treatment of relations is, on the other hand, highly\noriginal. Although (like Ockham) he refuses to make relations into\nthings distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribes them to an\nact of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in\nrelation to each other, an \u201cact of the referring soul [actus\nanimae referentis]\u201d. This leads him to reject completely\ncertain propositions Ockham had admitted as reasonable, even if he did\nnot construe them in quite the same way, e.g., \u2018Socrates is a\nrelation\u2019. Both Ockham and Buridan had allowed that the term\n\u2018relation\u2019 could refer to the things signified or connoted\nby concrete relative terms (whether collectively or not).\n\nSo Albert was not content with merely repeating Ockhamist arguments.\nMore often than not, he developed and deepened them, e.g., in\nconnection with the notion of the appellation of form. This property\nof predicates, which had previously been used by the Venerabilis\nInceptor, was employed by Albert in an original manner when he\nadopted it instead of Buridan\u2019s appellation of reason\n(appellatio rationis) to analyze verbs expressing\npropositional attitudes. Every proposition following a verb such as\n\u2018believe\u2019 or \u2018know\u2019 appellates its form. In\nother words, it must be possible to designate the object of the belief\nvia the expression understood as identical to itself in its material\nsignification and without reformulation. Another area in which Albert\ndeviates from Ockham is his rejection of the idea that any distinction\nwith multiple senses must have an equivocal proposition as its object.\nAccording to Albert, equivocal propositions can only be conceded,\nrejected, or left in doubt.\n\nHe adopts the same position as Burley about the issue of the complex\nsubject-term (including an oblique case) in a categorical proposition,\nas in \u2018Any man\u2019s donkey is running [Cuiuslibet hominis\nasinus currit]\u2019. He supports a logico-semantical model in\nwhich \u2018man [homo]\u2019 is the logical subject while\n\u2018a man\u2019s donkey [hominis asinus]\u2019 is the\ngrammatical one. This theory is criticized by Buridan, for whom the\nlogical subject is always the grammatical subject.\n\nAlbert\u2019s semantics becomes innovative when he admits that\npropositions have their own proper significate, which is not identical\nto that of their terms (see especially his Questions on the\nPosterior Analytics I, qq. 2, 7, 33). Like syncategorematic terms\n(see his Questions on the Categories, qu. 1 \u2018On\nNames\u2019), propositions signify the \u201cmode of a thing\n[modus rei]\u201d. This position is not repeated in the\nLogical Questions. In any case, Albert avoids hypostatizing\nthese modes by explaining them as relations between the things to\nwhich the terms refer. It cannot be said here that Albert is moving\ntowards the \u201ccomplexly signifiable [complexe\nsignificabile]\u201d of Gregory of Rimini, although his remarks\nare reminiscent of the latter theory. Still, he uses the idea of the\nsignification of a proposition to define truth and to explain\n\u2018insolubles\u2019, i.e., propositions expressing paradoxes of\nself-reference. On Albert\u2019s view, every proposition signifies\nthat it is true by virtue of its form. Thus, an insoluble proposition\nis always false because it signifies at the same time that it is true\nand that it is false.\n\nThe Questiones circa logicam (Questions on Logic)\nwere written at roughly the same time as the Logica and the\nQuestiones circa artem veterem, that is to say about 1356.\nThey explore in a series of disputed questions the status of logic and\nsemantics on topics such as the relation of words to concepts, the\ndifference between natural and conventional signification, etc., as\nwell as the theory of reference and truth. Albert defines\nsignification by representation. He distinguishes two ways of\nunderstanding suppositio, the first as the act of the mind\nitself; the second as an operation constituting one of the properties\nof terms.\n\nIn his Sophismata, Albert usually follows Heytesbury. The\ndistinction between compounded and divided senses, which is presented\nin a highly systematic way in Heytesbury\u2019s Tractatus de\nsensu composito et diviso, is the primary instrument (besides the\nappellation of form) for resolving difficulties connected with\nepistemic verbs and with propositional attitudes more generally. This\nis abundantly clear in his discussion of infinity. Rather than\nappealing to the increasingly common distinction between the\ncategorematic and syncategorematic uses of the term\n\u2018infinite\u2019 and then indicating the different senses it can\nhave depending on where it occurs in a proposition, he treats the\ninfinite itself as a term. Albert\u2019s approach involves analyzing\nthe logical and linguistic conditions of every proposition involving\nthe term \u2018infinite\u2019 that is significant and capable of\nbeing true. This leads him to sketch a certain number of possible\ndefinitions (where he appears to take into account the teachings of\nGregory of Rimini), as well as to raise other questions, e.g., on the\nrelation between finite and infinite beings (in propositions such as\n\u2018Infinite things are finite [infinita sunt\nfinita]\u2019), on the divisibility of the continuum, and on\nqualitative infinity. There are echoes in Albert not only of the\napproach Buridan had systematically implemented in his\nPhysics, but also of the analyses of English authors \u2014\nagain, especially Heytesbury. As is often the case, the treatment\nproposed by Albert in the Sophismata provides good evidence\nof the extent to which philosophers were gripped by questions about\ninfinity at that time.\n\nFinally, one of the fields in which Albert is considered a major\ncontributor is the theory of consequences. In the treatise of the\nPerutilis Logica devoted to consequences, Albert often seems\nto follow Buridan. But whereas Buridan maintained the central role of\nAristotelian syllogistic, Albert, like Burley, integrated syllogistic\nand the study of conversions into the theory of consequences.\nConsequence is defined as the impossibility of the antecedent\u2019s\nbeing true without the consequent\u2019s also being true \u2014\ntruth itself being such that howsoever the proposition signifies\nthings to be, so they are. The primary division is between formal and\nmaterial consequences, the latter being subdivided into consequences\nsimpliciter and ut nunc. A syllogistic consequence\nis a formal consequence whose antecedent is a conjunction of two\nquantified propositions and whose consequent is a third quantified\nproposition. Albert is thus led to present a highly systematic theory\nof the forms of inference, which represents a major step forward in\nthe medieval theory of logical deduction.\n",
