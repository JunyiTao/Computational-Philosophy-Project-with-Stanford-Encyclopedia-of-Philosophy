    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nIn the West, virtue ethics\u2019 founding fathers are Plato and\nAristotle, and in the East it can be traced back to Mencius and\nConfucius. It persisted as the dominant approach in Western moral\nphilosophy until at least the Enlightenment, suffered a momentary\neclipse during the nineteenth century, but re-emerged in\nAnglo-American philosophy in the late 1950s. It was heralded by\nAnscombe\u2019s famous article \u201cModern Moral Philosophy\u201d\n(Anscombe 1958) which crystallized an increasing dissatisfaction with\nthe forms of deontology and utilitarianism then prevailing. Neither of\nthem, at that time, paid attention to a number of topics that had\nalways figured in the virtue ethics tradition\u2014virtues and vices,\nmotives and moral character, moral education, moral wisdom or\ndiscernment, friendship and family relationships, a deep concept of\nhappiness, the role of the emotions in our moral life and the\nfundamentally important questions of what sorts of persons we should\nbe and how we should live.\n\nIts re-emergence had an invigorating effect on the other two\napproaches, many of whose proponents then began to address these\ntopics in the terms of their favoured theory. (One consequence of this\nhas been that it is now necessary to distinguish \u201cvirtue\nethics\u201d (the third approach) from \u201cvirtue theory\u201d, a\nterm which includes accounts of virtue within the other approaches.)\nInterest in Kant\u2019s virtue theory has redirected\nphilosophers\u2019 attention to Kant\u2019s long neglected\nDoctrine of Virtue, and utilitarians have developed\nconsequentialist virtue theories (Driver 2001; Hurka 2001). It has\nalso generated virtue ethical readings of philosophers other than\nPlato and Aristotle, such as Martineau, Hume and Nietzsche, and\nthereby different forms of virtue ethics have developed (Slote 2001;\nSwanton 2003, 2011a).\n\nAlthough modern virtue ethics does not have to take a\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d or eudaimonist form (see section 2),\nalmost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient\nGreek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it.\nThese are ar\u00eate (excellence or virtue),\nphronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia\n(usually translated as happiness or flourishing). (See Annas 2011 for\na short, clear, and authoritative account of all three.) We discuss\nthe first two in the remainder of this section. Eudaimonia is\ndiscussed in connection with eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics in\nthe next.\n",
