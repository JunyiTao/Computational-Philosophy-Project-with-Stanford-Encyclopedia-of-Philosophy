    "main_text": "What is Supererogation: Problems of Definition\n2. What is Supererogation: Problems of Definition\n\nThe conceptual question of what we mean by supererogation and\nthe substantive question of whether there actually are\nsupererogatory acts (and how their normative value can be justified)\nare inextricably interrelated. Consequently, although the following\ndiscussion will try to separate the two questions, addressing first\nthe conceptual issue and only later the normative, the division is\nonly didactic. Much of the disagreement about the nature of\nsupererogation and its proper definition is informed by normative\nviews about the scope of moral duty, the legitimate expectations of\naltruistic behavior, and the value of the autonomy of the individual\nin pursuing personal goals. This interdependence of the meta-ethical\nand the normative levels of discourse on supererogation becomes\nparticularly evident when paradigm examples are discussed: for\ninstance, is forgiveness obligatory or supererogatory is both a\nconceptual and a normative issue, and the same applies to charity, to\nacts of self-sacrifice and even to toleration, as will be shown\nbelow.\n\nJ.O. Urmson opened the contemporary discussion of supererogation\n(although hardly mentioning the term itself!) by challenging the\ntraditional threefold classification of moral action: the obligatory,\nthe permitted (or indifferent) and the prohibited (Urmson 1958). A\nmore general schema of this classification runs thus (Chisholm\n1963):\n\nactions that are good to do and bad not to do\nactions that are neither good to do nor bad not to do\nactions that are bad to do and good not to do\n\n\nUrmson argued that a morally significant class of actions, to which he\nreferred as saintly and heroic (such as throwing oneself on an\nexploding hand grenade in order to save the lives of others), does not\nfall under any of these categories. He referred to this class as\npraiseworthy though non-obligatory acts, or in terms of the above\ngeneral schema as\n\nactions that are good to do but not bad not to do\n\n\nThe scope of this further category became, however, the focus of\ndebate. Supererogatory acts in Urmson\u2019s sense (which is\nreminiscent of the Catholic doctrine) include only actions that are\nmorally praiseworthy, valuable, although not obligatory in the sense\nthat their omission is not blameworthy. But the general formulation\n(iv) could consist also of small acts of favor, politeness,\nconsideration and tact, which are good though not morally\npraiseworthy, which can be expected of people even though not strictly\ndemanded. The latter, wider, definition of supererogation, covers a\nlarger scope of actions that we tend to view as\ngood-though-not-obligatory; but the former, narrow, definition of\nsupererogation as having a unique moral merit better captures the\nessential value and hence justification of supererogation as a\ndistinct category of moral action, to which Urmson referred as saintly\nand heroic.\n\nThe general schema underlying (iv), i.e. the combination of some\npositive assessment of the action with a non-negative assessment of\nits omission, can be filled in various ways. \u201cGood to do, but\nnot bad not to do\u201d appears to be too weak a definition for\nsupererogation, at least in the sense that some omissions of\nsupererogatory action are (or lead to) bad states of affairs.\n\u201cRight to do, but not wrong not to do\u201d responds to this\nconcern but seems an equally weak definition for supererogatory\naction, this time due to the overly wide characterization of the\npositive condition (e.g. \u201cright\u201d falls short of the proper\ndescription of the act of volunteering to risk one\u2019s life in\norder to save a stranger). \u201cPraiseworthy to do, but not\nblameworthy not to do\u201d seems closer to what we wish to say about\nsupererogatory acts. However, praiseworthiness is associated with the\nevaluation of the agent rather than the act, while supererogation\nrefers primarily to the act. Furthermore, we often praise agents for\ndoing their duty (e.g. in overcoming obstacles like natural fear) and\nwe often do not praise agents of supererogatory action (e.g. when no\nparticular effort, cost, or risk is involved). There is no necessary\nconnection between supererogation and praiseworthiness, as some\nphilosophers argue (Archer 2015). It seems, therefore, that the neat\nschema of deontic logic, comprising of pairs of normative concepts\napplied symmetrically to commission and omission must be broken if we\nhope to arrive at a more useful characterization of supererogation\n(Schumaker 1972). This can be done by either mixing concepts from\ndifferent pairs, such as \u201cgood to do but not wrong not to\ndo,\u201d or by enriching the schema itself by adding further\nconditions, such as the beneficent intentions of the agent and her\naltruistic motives (Heyd 1982, Zimmerman 1996).\n\nDefinitions that are motivated by a skeptical attitude to\nsupererogation often try to salvage the three-fold classification of\nobligation-permission-prohibition as exhausting the realm of moral\nactions. Some philosophers identify supererogation with imperfect\nduty, or with a weak duty, or with duty that is personal and\nnon-universalizable, or with duty that has no correlative right, or\nwith an ethical rather than legal duty, or with an \u201cought\u201d\nwhich is not enforceable. Some even use the oxymoronic term\n\u201csupererogatory duty\u201d in trying to do justice to the\nphenomenon of supererogation without giving up the typically Kantian\nframing of all moral judgments in terms of duty. These are, however,\nmostly unsuccessful attempts. Imperfect duties, as many Kant scholars\nhave noted, are no less compelling than perfect duties and the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duty lies only in the mode\nof application (to what degree the conditions of its fulfillment are\nfixed or left to personal choice) rather than in the prescriptive\nforce of the duty itself. And since Kant sometimes defines imperfect\nduties as duties to adopt ends (rather than engage in particular\nacts), supererogation and imperfect duty do not belong to the same\nlevel of discourse: by doing many acts of charity one does not act\nsupererogatorily, since one cannot be more charitable than\nrequired (Guevara 1999, Baron 1987). Furthermore, if supererogation is\na personal (rather than universal) duty, then is it by a subjective\njudgment that it is made to be so? If not, there must be some\n(universalizable) characteristic which lays the duty on this\nkind of individual. Finally, there are many duties that have\nno correlative rights that have nothing to do with supererogation\n(e.g., at least for some philosophers, duties to animals or to future\npeople), so the test of the correlativity of duties to rights cannot\naccount for the distinction between obligation and supererogation.\n\nAnother issue raised by attempts to subject the concept of\nsupererogation to some version of the general schema is that of\n\u201coffence\u201d or \u201csuberogation\u201d: if there are\nnon-obligatory well-doings (supererogation), are there also \u2014 as\ntheir mirror image \u2014 non-prohibited wrong-doings\n(\u201cpermissive ill-doings\u201d)? Or in other words, are\nthere\n\nactions that are bad to do but not good not to do\n\n\nSome philosophers (Chisholm 1963, Richards 1971,\u00a0 Forrester 1975,\nand Driver 1992) were attracted to the logically neat symmetry of\nsupererogation and suberogation, but a critical examination of this\nartificially invented category demonstrates both the difficulty in\nfilling it with content and flaws in the general schema itself (Heyd\n1982, Mellema 1992). Examples for typical \u201coffences\u201d are\nhard to come by. At most one can think of permissible bad action in\nrelatively trivial cases, like taking too long in a restaurant while\nothers are waiting, which is inconsiderate rather than immoral\n(Ullmann-Margalit 2011). These are uninteresting cases from a moral\npoint of view as are their supererogatory counterparts of small favors\nor acts of politeness. An interesting, though controversial, example\nis ingratitude, which is traditionally considered as a grave sin\n(gratitude being a duty), but which some treat as typically\nsuberogatory (Wellman 1999). But once we look for examples of morally\nvicious or villainous action that is nevertheless permissible (which\nis the counterpart of a morally heroic action), we find it difficult\nto come up with an example. This should hardly be surprising. By its\nnature, a moral system does not leave patently bad action as morally\npermissible. In that respect, good and bad, the virtuous and the\nvicious, are not symmetrical from the deontic point of view:\nthe good is open-ended in a way that the bad is not. The extremely\ngood cannot be required, but the extremely bad (vicious) is the prime\ntarget of prohibition. However, more recently Paul McNamara has\nsuggested a rich conceptual analysis of the supererogatory which\nalthough leaving the question of asymmetry open, points to important\nanalogies between the supererogatory and the suberogatory. These can\nbe shown once we switch our attention from the agent-evaluative\ncomponent of suberogation as \u201coffence\u201d to the objective,\nact-evaluative element of \u201cpermissible suboptimality\u201d\n(McNamara 2011).\n\nWider definitions of supererogation, which refer to any\nnon-obligatory good action, are at risk of losing sight of the\nspecifically moral value usually associated with\n\u201cacting beyond the call of duty\u201d or \u201cgoing the\nsecond mile.\u201d Although \u201csupererogatory\u201d in English\nalso means superfluous, the technical Roman-Catholic meaning of the\nconcept is closer to what moral philosophy wishes to highlight as a\nseparate category of action. A typical ethically informed definition\nof supererogation relates both to the element of over-subscription\n(doing literally more than duty requires) and to the high cost or risk\ninvolved in the action (Feinberg 1968). There is a debate whether cost\nto the agent is a necessary condition of supererogation, for some\nminor supererogatory acts do not seem to involve costs, let alone\nrisks. However some cost to the agent, even if marginal, is\npart and parcel of supererogatory behavior, even if the agent enjoys\nengaging in it (Benn 2018b). But risk is not necessarily the source of\nthe value of supererogation. Yet it is true that, unlike\ndefinitions offered by deontic logicians, an ethical definition of\nsupererogation must include a condition that the action be of a\nparticularly moral value. The source of this particular value is\ndouble: the good intended consequences on the one hand, and\nthe optional nature of the act on the other. The good\npromoted is typically of an altruistic nature and thus an act may be\nsupererogatory even if the overall good in the world is not promoted\n(as might be the case in extreme acts of self-sacrifice for the sake\nof another). Supererogatory behavior is typically other-regarding:\neven if there are duties \u201cto oneself\u201d (which many ethical\ntheorists doubt), it is hard to see how they can be transcended in a\nsupererogatory way. In that respect, most definitions of\nsupererogation in modern ethics diverge from the Christian tradition:\nwhereas for the latter paradigm examples of supererogation are piety\nand chastity, for the former these are altruistic deeds of extreme\nbeneficence. There are, however, contemporary non-religious views\nwhich leave room for self-regarding actions of supererogation (Kawall\n2003). \n\nAn illustrative case for this altruistic characterization of\nsupererogation is the understudied issue of whether governments can\nact supererogatorily (for an exception, see Weinberg 2011). Weinberg\nexamines all the possible objections to such a possibility, primarily\nin terms of the government\u2019s exclusive role to implement\njustice, but still wishes to leave the door open for some possible\ngovernmental acts which go beyond duty \u2014 such as throwing a\nblock party or investing money in the preservation of the historical\nlegacy of the nation. But these examples are not intuitively clear\ncases of government supererogation and even if they were, they would\nalways be entangled (as the author admits) with questions of the way\nthe money for these projects was collected and now spent (which is\ntypically a matter of justice). Furthermore, if the definition of\nsupererogatory action consists of a condition of beneficent intention\nor altruism (like in Heyd), governments cannot be considered as agents\nable to show these attitudes. For they are impersonal institutions.\nFor that reason it is dubious whether governments, or other\ninstitutions like the courts, can show forgiveness since their\nfunction is to do justice and promote the good according to the law\nrather than break the rules from an altruistic intention. And of\ncourse it is hard to see how the government can \u201csacrifice\nitself\u201d or its own interests for the sake of another individual\nor state.\n\nAs for the second source of value of supererogatory action, its\noptional nature, it should first be noted that such action must be\nvoluntary (unlike obligatory action, which is often forced or\nenforced). But again, the neutral deontic description of\n\u201cneither obligatory nor forbidden\u201d fails to capture the\nkind of freedom involved in such action. The agent has full discretion\nwhether to go beyond what is required and makes a personal choice to\ndo so. She is neither under any external constraint (like the law),\nnor under internal demands (of rationality or of the Kantian moral\nlaw). In other words, supererogatory behavior is fully optional. Thus,\nit would be absurd to force a person to do a supererogatory act, even\nif that act had extremely beneficial consequences. The permission not\nto do the best we can is not derived from the unenforceability of\nsupererogatory conduct but from agent-centred restrictions which limit\nthe force of the impersonal maximizing principle (Haydar 2002). This\ndoes not mean that the agent herself necessarily believes that her\naction is optional. Many agents of supererogatory acts report that all\nthey did was what they felt they \u201chad to do,\u201d or what they\nthought was their duty (although when asked whether they would expect\nsuch an action to be performed by everybody else in the same\ncircumstances they would probably answer in the negative, thus getting\nentangled in an inconsistency typical of moral modesty).\n\nDoing one\u2019s duty does not win the agent any credit. She only did\nwhat she had to do. But going beyond the call of duty is meritorious\nexactly in the sense that the agent did something \u201cextra,\u201d\nbreaking the balance of justice or that of respect for claim-rights\nand the fulfillment of duties. This merit of supererogatory action\nshould be held distinct from the praise we often assign to the agent.\nPraise is a subjective assessment or recognition of the particular way\nin which the agent faced a moral challenge and acted as she did (e.g.\novercoming special difficulties or obstacles, or sacrificing herself\nin the course of doing either what was her duty or what lay beyond\nit). Merit is an objective property of the act itself. It is typically\nattached to heroic and saintly acts, but it can also be gained by\nminor supererogatory acts of kindness or gifts, and is thus not\nnecessarily associated with particular praise for the agent (cf.\nMontague 1989, Trianosky 1986). Recent works on supererogation refer\nto \u201cmoral-merit-conferring reasons\u201d for action, i.e.\nreasons which are neither \u201crequiring\u201d nor\n\u201cjustifying\u201d as a way to untie \u201cthe knot\u201d (or\nalleged paradox) of supererogation (Horgan and Timmons 2010, Dreier\n2004). But unlike the Catholic doctrine, few theorists of\nsupererogation believe that this merit is transferable or can serve as\ncompensation for other people\u2019s moral failures. And although\nsupererogation cannot be hoped to simply offset even one\u2019s\nown violations of duty, the merit of actions beyond the call\nof duty definitely plays an important role in the overall evaluation\nof one\u2019s moral record. In cases of a high potential benefit we\nmay sometimes even be permitted to act supererogatorily rather than do\nour duty (Kamm 1985). Furthermore, the traditional idea of merit (or\n\u201csuperabundance\u201d) associated with supererogation is\nreflected in secular ethical theory in the duty of gratitude:\nacknowledging the meritorious nature of a gift or any non-obligatory\nwell doing is the morally obligatory response (irrespective of the\nmoral praise which might or might not accrue to the agent of the\nsupererogatory act).\n\nThe characterization of supererogatory acts is highly controversial\nand cannot be captured by a strict formal definition. Furthermore, as\nhas already come up in the discussion in this section, the way we\ndescribe supererogation is closely dependent on the way we justify (or\ndeny) its moral value. Most typically, definitions of supererogation\nthat introduce conditions of altruistic intention, free choice and\ngood consequences are constructed in a way that betrays an underlying\nview about its special moral value and hence justification. On the\nother hand, definitions that are merely formal (deontic) in nature are\nnot committed to the intrinsic value, indeed to the very existence of\nsupererogatory actions.\n",
