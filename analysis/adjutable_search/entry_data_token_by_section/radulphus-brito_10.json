    "main_text": "Psychology || Intellectual Cognition\n5.5 Intellectual Cognition\n\nThe intellectual faculty, in turn, does not use a bodily organ in its\noperations. According to Brito, however, every single case of\nintellectual cognition takes as a starting point a phantasma\nor image (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 40). This does not mean that the\nimage is itself the object of intellectual cognition. On the contrary,\nBrito emphasizes in several places that the object of intellectual\ncognition is the essence (quod quid est) of the thing\n(QDA-1974-III: 174; cf. QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 41). For\ninstance, what is known through intellectual cognition is neither the\nimage of the apple nor the external apple, but the essence of the\nexternal apple that is represented in the image.\n\nThe process of intellectual cognition of an essence involves two\noperations that correspond to two different powers of the intellectual\nfaculty: the operations of abstraction and intellection by the agent\nand the possible intellect. Since the essence in both the image and\nthe external thing has material existence, and since the object of\nintellectual cognition must be immaterial, it is necessary to\nintroduce a power that makes the essence immaterial. This power is the\nagent intellect\u2014an active power that, through the act of\nabstraction, makes immaterial the essence materially represented in\nthe image (QDA-1974-III: 212).\n\nBrito rejects two alternative accounts that explain this act of\nabstraction either as\n\n the impression of a disposition in the image, or as \n the removal of the accidental features that accompany the essence\nin the image.\n\n\nThe former, (i), is rejected because whatever is impressed in a\nmaterial power immediately becomes material, and hence the impression\nof a disposition in the image cannot make the essence immaterial\n(QDA-1974-III: 218). The latter account, (ii), in turn, is\nrejected because either the result of the removal remains in the\nphantasia\u2014a material power\u2014and we end up again\nwith the same problem as (i), or the result is transferred to the\npossible intellect and we end up with a problematic transfer of an\naccidental form from one subject to another\u2014from the organ of\nthe phantasia to the soul (QDA-1974-III: 230). An\naccident only has being in a substance; hence, if the transfer of\naccidents from one subject to another were possible, one would need to\nposit a time t where the accident has no supporting\nsubstance, which is impossible. Brito\u2019s own account is that the\nagent intellect functions as a \u2018light\u2019 that enables the\nessence in the image to trigger a corresponding act of intellection\nwithout any removal, impression, or transfer of a form. Brito explains\nhis point by means of an analogy with seeing milk\u2019s whiteness:\nthanks to the action of light, the milk\u2019s whiteness is seen,\nwithout other features of the milk being seen, e.g., its sweetness;\nbut the action of light on the milk involves neither the impression of\na disposition on the milk\u2019s whiteness (namely, visibility) nor a\nreal removal of the whiteness from the sweetness\n(QDA-1974-III: 237). In fact, the milk\u2019s whiteness is\nin itself potentially visible and the action of light does nothing\nmore than to make it actually visible. The same goes for the agent\nintellect: it makes the essence in the image, which is in itself\npotentially intelligible, be actually intelligible.\n\nThe essence in the image thus illuminated, but neither really\nseparated from the image nor transferred anywhere, triggers the act of\nintellection of the possible intellect\u2014the passive power of the\nintellectual faculty. This power is passive precisely in the sense\nthat it cannot trigger its own operation; rather, this operation must\nbe caused in it by the essence of the thing with the assistance of the\nagent intellect (QDA-1974-III: 122). Finally, the act of\nintellection comes about when, thanks to the action of the agent\nintellect, the actually intelligible essence in the image is actually\nunderstood by the possible intellect, thus causing the formation of\nthe essence\u2019s concept in the soul.\n",
