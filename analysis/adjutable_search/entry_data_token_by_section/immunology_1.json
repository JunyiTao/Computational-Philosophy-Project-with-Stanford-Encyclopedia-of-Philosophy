    "main_text": "Organism-Level Functions of the Immune System\n2. Organism-Level Functions of the Immune System\n\nThe basic schema of vertebrate immunity consists of two evolutionary\ndistinct ways to perceive the organism\u2019s external environment\nand to monitor its inner state. The first modality, more primitive and\nless refined in its perceptive mechanisms, is referred to as the\n\u201cinnate\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d immune system. This arm\nof immunity is composed of a variety of primordial\nphagocytes\u2014\u201ceating cells\u201d\u2014possessing\ndistinctive characteristics based on their tissue distribution. They\ningest particulate microbes and destroy effete, cancerous, and damaged\nhost cells. These immunocytes constitute the first line of the immune\nencounter and comprise the \u201cresting\u201d state of\nphysiological immunity as they \u201cpolice\u201d on-going processes\nof surveillance and restoration. This system has autonomous functions,\nbut the incorporation of antigen (a substance that stimulates an\nimmune response) may also lead to integration with the second mode of\nimmunity, the so called, \u201cacquired\u201d immune system. This\nsecond arm of immunity has evolved mechanisms that are highly specific\nin their recognition capabilities and exhibit immune\n\u201cmemory\u201d of previous sensitization. Acquired immunity is\nmediated by several classes of lymphocytes that may be stimulated by\nphagocyte first-encounters or as primary responders under certain\npathological conditions. The B-lymphocytes produce antibody that\nrecognizes antigens by structural homology and, correspondingly,\nT-cells have specific antigen-matching receptors on their cell\nsurface. The initial recognition event leads to activation of a\nvariety of effector reactions that destroy the immune target. However,\nthe decision not to respond is also a recognition event and results in\nimmune \u201ctolerance\u201d. Both the innate and acquired immune\ncellular elements are regulated by a vast array of soluble molecular\nfactors that serve to either activate or dampen immune responses. The\ncomplexity of diverse cell types, the mediators of their interactions,\nthe contextual determinants that determine immune reactivity, and the\nwide range of physiological functions in which immunity participates,\nhas defied comprehensive modeling. Consequently, immunology offers a\nfecund example of biological organizational complexity, which, in\nturn, leads to the fundamental philosophical question: On what basis\nis organismal identity established and maintained?\n\nImmunology, from its earliest inception, has been concerned with\nbiological identity\u2014its establishment and maintenance.\nIn its original iteration, immunity was conceived as that function\nthat preserved the integrity of the organism in terms of\nprotecting and restoring its individuality. Thus, immune\nfunctions testified to the persistence of a stable, core identity\ndefined in terms of its insularity and autonomy. Indeed,\nindividuality undergirded the science from its inception, for\nthe defense against pathogens was framed by an attacked patient\n(individual) pitted against alien others, the invaders. In this\nscenario, distinct borders mark individual identity, and immunity is\nthe response to the violation of those boundaries. However, challenges\nto this conception of immunity have recently appeared. Emphasizing the\ncontextual placement of the organism, notions of demarcated boundaries\nthat have characterized traditional definitions of the organism are\nbeing revised.\n\nGenerally understood, an individual replicates itself and possesses\nanatomic borders, a harmonious communication between its parts, a\ndivision of labor for the benefit of the whole, and a system of\nhierarchical dominance and control. By these criteria, the immune\nsystem is responsible for establishing and maintaining the integrity\nof such an individual (Pradeu 2016). However, symbiosis challenges\nthis entrenched definition of the individual organism: shared\nphysiologies govern homeostasis; anatomic margins lose clear\ndefinition; development is intertwined among several phylogenetically\ndefined entities; and the unit of evolutionary selection becomes a\nmultiplex genome (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n On this consortium view, notions of individuality are replaced with\ncomplexes of organisms that defy any singular definition of\norganismal identity as independent agents (L\u00f6wy 1991; S. Gilbert,\nSapp, and Tauber 2012). In terms of commensal relationships,\nsymbiosis, mediated by immune tolerance, signifies stabilized\nadaptation to the complex of diverse living elements that live in a\ncohesive ecology, both within and external to the traditional borders\nof the organism. When oriented by ecological relationships, immunology\nmoves from its dominant concern with autonomous individuality to\ninclude the science of cooperative assemblies of organisms. The\nontological implications of this re-formulation are highly significant\nfor philosophical considerations of identity as discussed below (see\nthe entry on\n identity).\n",
