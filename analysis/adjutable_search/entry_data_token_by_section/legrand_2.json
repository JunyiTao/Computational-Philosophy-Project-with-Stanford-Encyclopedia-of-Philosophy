Sensory\nimpressions are what mediate the external object and our mind\u2019s\nidea of it, and they consist in nothing more than the immediate\nmotions of the sensory organs in the body. Such motions are produced\nby a natural necessity and they share no similarity or affinity with\nthe particular objects that cause them. Like Descartes, Le Grand used\nthe example of a sword wounding the body to illustrate the\nnon-resemblance or dissimilitude of the relations between external\nobjects and sensations, and sensations and ideas. (1694, book I, part\nix, p. 327) A sword that produces pain in us is nothing like our\nsensation or idea of pain, nor is our idea of pain anything like our\nsensation of pain. Yet, we maintain that there is a causal and\nrepresentational relation between the sword and the idea it produces.\nIn addition, Le Grand like Descartes made a clear distinction between\nsensory impressions and ideas. Sensory impressions are particular,\nquantifiable motions, whereas ideas are representational and\npropositional in character. Given that sensations are non-resembling\nand non-representational it follows that ideas, which are essentially\nrepresentational, could not be derived from sensations. Due to the\nlack of any form of similitude or affinity between object/sensation,\nand sensation/idea, it follows that there is no such relation that\nholds between an idea and an external (material) object. From this\nlack of similitude, Le Grand concluded that adventitious ideas (coming\nfrom material objects outside us) must be innate or inbred in the\nmind. For, if the external object is not like the idea we form of it,\nthen the only explanation remaining is that the mind is responsible\nfor it. Likewise, fictitious ideas, such as sirens and chimeras, have\nno exemplar outside the mind and so must be formed according to forms\nnatural to the human mind. And finally, common notions such as\nsubstance, truth, goodness, equity, and God, as well as axioms such as\n\u2018the same thing cannot be and not be,\u2019 must also be\ninnate, that is, they must proceed from the mind alone, since all\ncorporeal motions are particular but these notions are universal.\nAccording to Le Grand, innate ideas do not proceed from the senses or\nthe imagination but \u201care congenite and inbred with the said\nmind, from their original\u201d (1694, book I, part ix, p. 328). By\nthis Le Grand meant that the mind or thought itself, not any of its\nfaculties such as sense, imagination, or intellection, is the\nprinciple or original of such ideas. These ideas are formed in the\nmind by the mind and from the mind.\n\nThus, as Descartes held, there are three kinds of ideas, adventitious,\nfictitious, and innate, which are distinguished by their differing\nsources as well as the way in which they are inbred in the mind.\nAdventitious ideas proceed from the senses, fictitious ideas proceed\nfrom the imagination and the intellect, and innate ideas proceed from\nthought itself, which acts as their ground or original. Nonetheless,\nall ideas, regardless of their source or origin, depend on the mind in\nsome essential way for their form. But this gives rise to the problem\nof explaining how ideas can be said to represent, if they in no way\nresemble their objects. (Watson, 1966, chapter 6) This problem is\nespecially acute for Cartesians who held that there is a modal\ndifference between what is found at the level of sensory perception\nand intellection, such that impressions cannot contain any of the\nproperties found at the level of ideas. What arrives at our faculty of\nthinking from the senses is not ideas such as we form them in our\nthought, as the scholastic empiricists held, but rather only various\nparticular motions emitted by external objects. (1694, book I, part\nix, p. 328)\n\nLe Grand\u2019s solution to the problem of how ideas represent their\nobjects absent similitude was to employ the notion of substitution or\n\u2018supplying a stead\u2019\u2014wherein the cause (the object)\ncontains all the properties found in the effect (the idea) not\nactually but in virtue of its ability to supply the substitute\nproperties or proxies. According to Le Grand, \u201c[the] relation of\nsubstitution is that which intervenes betwixt the sign, and that which\nis signified by it.\u201d (1694, book I, part I, p. 17) Such a\nrelation, \u201c\u2026is nothing else but a mode of our\nunderstanding, comparing one thing with others, because of some\nproperties or acts that are found in them.\u201d (Ibid., p.\n17). By virtue of a kind of causal concomitance of the\nsigned-signified pairs there arises a signifying relation. Descartes\nhimself never develops the notion of representation in terms of\nsubstitution, although he came close to suggesting it in the French\nversion of the Third Meditation, in which he claimed that such things\nas extension, shape, position and movement may be contained in him\neminently, \u201c\u2026and as it were the garments under which\ncorporeal substance appears to us.\u201d (1985\u201391, II, fn.1, p.\n31). One could conceivably interpret this to mean that the garments of\ncorporeal substance, namely extension, shape, position and movement\nare the garments supplied by the mind as the forms or the conceptions\nunder which the mind grasps material things. Although the mind itself\nis not extended, shaped, locally positioned or moved, it dresses\nmaterial substance in these properties in order to perceive particular\nmaterial things. But there is no suggestion in Descartes regarding how\nthe dressing is related to the material object grasped. Le\nGrand\u2019s notion of substitution provided an explication of this\nrelation, and constitutes his contribution to the Cartesian dialectic\non ideas.\n\nLe Grand was one of the few Cartesians to see the connection Descartes\ndrew between the doctrine of the creation of essences and eternal\ntruths (Creation Doctrine) and establishing the proper foundation of\nhuman knowledge and certainty. The thesis is that God is the efficient\ncause of all things equally in their existence and essence, including\nthe truths we call eternal. Given the immutability and indivisibility\nof God\u2019s will, once God chose to create the world in its being\nand essence, it could not be changed. In 1630, Descartes introduced\nthe Creation Doctrine in his correspondence with Mersenne to explain\nthe sense in which the truths of mathematics, such as 2+2=4, are\nnecessarily true but could have been otherwise. According to\nDescartes, such truths are created, \u201cThe mathematical truths\nwhich you call eternal have been laid down by God and depend on him\nentirely no less than the rest of his creatures.\u201d\n(1985\u201391, III, p. 23) The sense in which God could have\nmade a universe in which 2+2 did not equal 4, or not willed a\nworld at all, is beyond our grasp. What we know is that once the\neternal truths are established in their being according to God\u2019s\nwill, they become necessary and knowable to the human intellect,\n\u201cIn general we can assert that God can do everything that is\nwithin our grasp but not that he cannot do what is beyond our grasp.\nIt would be rash to think that our imagination reaches as far as his\npower.\u201d (1985\u201391, III, p. 23)\n\nAlthough Descartes promised to expand on this idea in his physics, and\npleads with Mersenne to test the idea out on others (without\nmentioning his name), he seems instead to have abandoned it or decided\nnot to publish on it further. (Ibid., p. 23) Le Grand was\namong a minority of Descartes\u2019s successors to take up a defense\nof the Creation Doctrine. Le Grand draws on Descartes\u2019s analogy\nof God laying down the eternal truths in the manner that a king lays\ndown the laws of his kingdom: \u201cThe case of God and a king are\nvery different. A king can change his laws because his will is\nchangeable, but God\u2019s will is unchangeable; for it is his\nperfection that he acts in a most constant and invariable manner ...\nWherefore tho\u2019 I cannot comprehend how it should not be true,\nthat one and five are six; yet I understand clearly enough that it is\nimpossible there should be anything in the whole universe of things\nwhich does not depend on him.\u201d (1694, book I, part ii, p. 63)\nThe main worry that critics such as Malebranche had of this doctrine\nwas that it would remove any necessary foundation for the propositions\nof science and theology, making them contingent and uncertain. Le\nGrand\u2019s answer is that whereas the creation of true and\nimmutable natures was the work of God\u2019s free will (not dictated\naccording to his Wisdom, as Malebranche and other critics held), once\ncreated, they are necessary. In order to tie this necessity to the\nimmutability of God\u2019s will without limiting God in any way, Le\nGrand drew on a Scholastic distinction between antecedent and\nconsequent necessity. He argued that true and immutable natures, such\nas mathematical truths, only possessed a consequent necessity. God did\nnot will that 5+1=6 because he saw it could not be otherwise, but in\nvirtue of his free will, 5+1 [necessarily] = 6; therefore it could not\nbe otherwise. As Descartes put this same point, \u201cAnd even if God\nhas willed that some truths should be necessary, this does not mean\nthat he willed them necessarily; for it is one thing to will that they\nbe necessary, and quite another to will this necessarily, or to be\nnecessitated to will it.\u201d (1985\u201391, III, p. 235). For\nnothing outside of God, not even the eternal truths or immutable\nessences, necessitate that God act in one way or another, but rather,\nthey are themselves eternal and immutable in virtue of the fact that\nGod, whose existence is necessary and immutable, willed them in their\nessence and existence. Eternal truths and immutable essences are\nnecessary only in that they presuppose and are consequent to the act\nof God who caused them. (Easton, 2009)\n\nEchoing Descartes in part VI of the Discourse on Method, Le\nGrand held that God implanted certain simple, true, and immutable\nideas in our minds so that we could have a science of nature. God also\ncreated nature with powers so ample and vast that observation becomes\nmore and more necessary to advance our knowledge. Like Descartes,\nwhile Le Grand retains the essential role of reason in knowing\nimmutable essences, laws, and truths it is tempered by the realization\nthat the effects in nature are so numerous that observation is needed\nto connect our understanding to them. This dependence means that\ntruths of natural philosophy must be sought after in the effects of\nnature, and not in something independent of those effects. In other\nwords, our search for the truths of nature is in the specific\noperations of things, and even though our understanding of these\ntruths is importantly independent of these specific operations, our\ndiscovery of them is not.
