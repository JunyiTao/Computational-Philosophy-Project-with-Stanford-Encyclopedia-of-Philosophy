Justifications of Criminal Law\n\n\nIn light of the resources it consumes, and the damage it does to\npeople\u2019s lives, it is far from clear that we are justified in\nhaving criminal law. If we should not be abolitionists, criminal law\nmust be capable of realizing some value that gives us sufficient\nreason to retain it. To offer an account of this value is to offer a\ngeneral justification of criminal law. Obviously enough, the\nfunctions of criminal law tell us something about what this might be.\nIf the punitive view is correct, criminal law\u2019s value consists in\ndelivering justified punishment. If the curial view is correct, that\nvalue consists (in part) in people offering answers that they have\nreason to offer. If the preventive view is correct, it consists in\npreventing criminal wrongs. So stated, however, these views do not tell\nus what the value of fulfilling each function actually is. The punitive\nview tells us nothing about what justifies criminal punishment. The\ncurial view tells us nothing about the value of calling people to\naccount in criminal courts. The preventive view tells us nothing about\nthe value of preventing crime. A general justification of criminal law\nfills this explanatory gap.\n\n\nWe can make progress by distinguishing between value of different\nkinds. Some value is relational\u2014it exists in virtue of\nrelationships in which people stand. That a relationship has such\nvalue is a reason to do what will bring it into existence. The value\nof friendship is a reason to make friends. The value of egalitarian\nsocial relations is a reason to break down barriers of status and\nrank. Some argue that we have sufficient reason to have criminal law\nbecause it helps us enter a valuable relationship: it helps transform\nour relations with one another from relations of mutual dependence, to\nrelations of independence from the power of others (Ripstein 2009,\n300\u2013324; Thorburn 2011a, 2011b).\n\n\nThis argument can be developed as follows. Just as slaves are\ndependent on their masters, so we are dependent on one another in the\nabsence of a framework of legal rights: just as masters wrong their\nslaves, however well they treat them, so we are doomed to wrong one\nanother if no such framework exists. To avoid this, we need more than\njust rights that exist on paper. We need sufficient assurance that our\nrights will be respected, and we need a mechanism by which their\nsupremacy can be reasserted in the face of wilful violation. Criminal\nlaw\u2019s value lies in giving us what we need. Criminal punishment\namounts to reassertion. Crime prevention provides reassurance. At the\nlevel of function, this is what the last section called a mixed view.\nBut the value of fulfilling both functions is one and the same: it is\nthe value of securing our independence from one another, so we cease\nto relate to one another as master and slave, and begin to do so as\nindependent beings. As it is often associated (rightly or wrongly)\nwith Kant\u2019s political philosophy, we can call this the\nKantian view.\n\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that criminal law\u2019s general\njustification is exhausted by its contribution to our independence. It\nis not clear why we should accept this claim. One source of doubt is\nthe fact that some agents are unavoidably\ndependent\u2014they lack the capacities required to live as\nindependent beings. This is true of some non-human animals, and some\nof those with serious disabilities. Precisely because of the\ncapacities they lack, these agents are especially vulnerable to being\nabused or exploited. Part of criminal law\u2019s general\njustification is that it protects the vulnerable against such\nwrongs. Ex hypothesi, this does nothing to secure\nindependence. So it is not something that can be accommodated by (the\nexhaustive form of) the Kantian view (Tadros 2011b).\n\n\nFor defenders of the Kantian view, criminal law\u2019s value derives\nfrom a relationship it helps create. On another view, the value of\ncriminal law derives from a relationship that pre-exists it: the\nrelationship in which we stand as members of a political community\n(Duff 2011). Any such community has values in terms of which it is\nunderstood by its members. If this self-understanding is to be more\nthan a charade, the community must actually value its defining\nvalues\u2014it must do what those values are reasons to do. Imagine\nthat life is one such value, and a member takes another\u2019s life.\nPart of what it is for a community to value life is for it to respond\nto the taking: for the killer to be required to account to fellow\nmembers, thereby communicating the community\u2019s judgment that the\nkilling was wrong. Criminal law is a body of law that requires the\naccounting. Functionally, this is a version of the curial view. But\nthe value of fulfilling that function is relational: it is the value\nof making the community one that is true to itself\u2014one that does\nnot betray the values in terms of which members understand what it is\nand who they are (Duff and Marshall 2010, 83\u201384). This line of\nthought lends support to what I earlier called the communitarian\nview. On that view, criminal proceedings discharge secondary duties\nowed to the community as a whole. That such duties are part and parcel\nof a valuable form of relationship helps explains why we should think\nthat they exist.\n\n\nOne objection to the view described in the previous paragraph is that\nit is unduly conservative. What justifies criminalizing a\nwrong\u2014on that view\u2014is that the wrong has a pre-existing\nfoothold in the defining values of the community: it is because of\nthat foothold that failing to criminalize would be a form of\nself-betrayal.  Some communities, however, are characterised by\nsystematic\nneglect of important values\u2014by patriarchy, or racism, or\ndistributive inequality. When this is so, part of the justification for\ncriminalization is not that it helps the community remain true to\nitself, but that it helps transform the community by\nreconstituting it in valuable ways (Dempsey 2009; 2011). One source of\ncriminal law\u2019s value, on this alternative view, is its ability to help alter\nsocial morality, such that neglected values come to be taken seriously\nby community members (Green 2013a). Where this is successful, criminal\nlaw can largely disappear from members\u2019 motivational horizons: we\ncome to refrain from conduct for the moral reasons that make it wrong,\nwithout reference to the fact that the conduct is criminal.\n\n\nBoth versions of the relational view\u2014Kantian and\ncommunitarian\u2014face another doubt. Imagine \\(D\\) robs \\(V\\). It\nis plausible to think that this wrong is of concern to the criminal\nlaw\nin its own right. It is plausible to think that whatever\nfurther effects it might have, preventing the wrong of murder\nitself helps justify criminalizing murder, and bringing\ncriminal proceedings against murderers. On both the Kantian and\ncommunitarian views this is not the case. What justifies criminalizing\nwrongs, and bringing criminal proceedings against wrongdoers, is that\nthis contributes to some larger social good\u2014to the framework of\nlegal rules we need for independence, or to the community remaining\ntrue to itself. We may reasonably doubt that wrongs like murder matter\nto the criminal law only for these further reasons. In claiming that\nthis is why they matter, both versions of the relational view\ninstrumentalize criminal law\u2019s concern with wrongdoing:\nboth hold that we have reason to prevent wrongs via the criminal law\nonly because this is a means of establishing healthy relations in which\nall share.\n\n\nThe above remarks concern the kind of value that justifies having\ncriminal law. We can also ask who is capable of realizing that value.\nOn both the views sketched above, criminal law\u2019s value is\ngrounded in a relationship in which all stand. If that value is to be\nrealised, someone must act on behalf of those who stand in the\nrelationship. In most systems of criminal law, the job is done by the\nstate\u2014agents of the state create, apply, and enforce criminal\nlaws. Some argue that in a legitimate system of criminal law this is\nthe only possibility. Criminal law\u2019s value, it is claimed, is\nessentially public\u2014it is value that can only be\nrealised, even in principle, by agents of the state. This view can be\ndeveloped in a number of ways. Consider again the Kantian view. Some\nclaim that coercion secures independence only if the coercer speaks for\nall those coerced. Otherwise it is just another independence violation.\nOnly state agents can speak for all of us. So the enforcement of the\ncriminal law must remain in their hands (Thorburn 2011a, 98\u201399).\nDefenders of the communitarian view tell a similar story. If the value\nof criminal proceedings is that they express the community\u2019s\njudgment about wrongdoing, and if only state agents can convey our\ncollective judgment, trials must be carried out, and punishments\nimposed, by those agents (Duff 2013a, 206). On both views, it is\nimpossible for private persons to realise the values that justify\ncriminal law. If these arguments go through, they have obvious\nimplications for debates about the privatization of prison and police\nservices (Dorfman and Harel 2016). They also offer us a sense in which\ncriminal law theory must be political. It must face up to the question\nof whether there are essentially public goods, and ask what role they\nplay in justifying the existence of criminal law (Harel 2014,\n96\u201399).\n\n\nSome find criminal law\u2019s general justification in value that is\nneither relational nor essentially public. Consider the prevention of\nharm, or the prevention of moral wrongdoing. A number of writers\nappeal to one or both values to justify the existence of criminal law\n(Feinberg 1987, 146\u2013155; Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 17; Simester\nand von Hirsch 2011, 29\u201330). Because there are wrongless harms\n(think of sporting injures caused without foul play) and harmless\nwrongs (think of botched conspiracies or undiscovered attempts) the\naforementioned values do not always wax and wane together. One\npossibility is that criminal law\u2019s concern with wrongs is\nderivative of its concern with harms: criminal law should prevent\nwrongs (e.g., conspiracy to injure) when and because harm is thereby\nprevented (e.g., injury itself). Another possibility is that criminal\nlaw\u2019s concern with harms is derivative of its concern with\nwrongs: criminal law should prevent harms (e.g., physical injury) when\nand because those harms are wrongfully caused (e.g., by assault)\n(Feinberg 1987, 151\u2013155; Moore 1997, 647\u2013649). A third\npossibility is that harms and wrongs provide two independent sources\nof general justification (compare Tadros 2016,\n162\u2013166). Whatever the answer, this preventive value is\nimpersonal in two ways: it is not grounded in any special\nrelationship; and it is value that might in principle be realised by\nany of us.\n\n\nAnyone who seeks criminal law\u2019s justification in the coin of\nimpersonal value must also account for what the criminal law does when\nprevention fails. Imagine \\(D\\) assaults \\(V\\), thereby causing \\(V\\)\nphysical injury. Some claim that \\(D\\) thereby incurs secondary moral\nduties, not in virtue of any relationship in which \\(D\\) stands, but\nsimply in virtue of facts about the wrong \\(D\\) committed (Moore 1997,\n170\u2013172; Tadros 2011c, 275\u2013283). Criminal law\u2019s\nresponses to crime discharge these duties, it is claimed, and this is\nwhat justifies those responses.\n\n\nIt is worth distinguishing between two versions of this view.\nAccording to Moore, all culpable wrongdoers incur a duty to allow\nthemselves to suffer. \n  Retributive justice\n is done when punishment\nimposes that suffering, and this is what justifies the imposition of\ncriminal punishment (Moore 1997, 70\u201371). Moore argues that the\nsuffering of culpable wrongdoers is intrinsically good. On a rival\nview, suffering is always intrinsically bad. We must accept, however,\nthat in some cases not all suffering can be avoided. Sometimes we must\nchoose between wrongdoers suffering now and others suffering at the\nhands of wrongdoers later. Only by imposing the former can we protect\nagainst the latter. It might look as though punishing wrongdoers for\nthese protective reasons amounts to treating them as mere means. But\nthis is not necessarily so. Tadros argues that some wrongdoers incur\nduties to protect others at the cost of some harm to themselves. We\ncan justify imposing punishments that come at this cost to these\nwrongdoers, when the punishments protect others by preventing future\nwrongs. As those punished are only doing their duty, we can reasonably\nclaim that they are not treated as mere means (Tadros 2011c; 2016).\nThough Moore and Tadros disagree on many things, their views also have\nsomething in common. Both claim that, as a matter of principle, anyone\nmight impose punishment that discharges wrongdoers\u2019 secondary\nduties. The value to which both appeal to justify punishment is\nimpersonal: it is neither relational nor essentially public (Moore\n2009a, 42; Tadros 2011c, 293).\n\n\nGeneral justifications of criminal law like those sketched in the last\nfew paragraphs face a number of criticisms. One objection has it they\nare unduly expansive: much moral wrongdoing\u2014even much\nthat generates secondary duties to suffer or protect\u2014is no\nbusiness of the criminal law. Failing to help one\u2019s friend move\nhouse because one is lazy is a culpable wrong. But as the failure is a\nprivate matter\u2014to be resolved by the friends\nthemselves\u2014there is no reason for law-makers to criminalize the\nwrong (Duff 2014b; Husak 2014, 215\u2013216). There is certainly no\nreason for them to criminalize it when the friends are both citizens\nof another state, and the failure occurs in the other jurisdiction\n(Duff 2016). Reasons to criminalize exist, as it is often put, only\nwhere law-makers have standing. And the mere fact that a\nwrong generates the aforementioned secondary duties does not itself\ngive law-makers standing to criminalize it.\n\n\nAccording to a second objection, the focus on moral wrongdoing is\nunduly restrictive: much that is not morally wrong\u2014and\nwhich generates no secondary duties\u2014is the business of the\ncriminal law. According to one argument for this conclusion, the\nstable existence of (almost) any valuable social institution\u2014be\nit financial, educational, familial, military, or\npolitical\u2014depends on widespread compliance with its rules. Under\nrealistic conditions, criminal liability for violation is necessary\nfor stability. It is the value of stable institutions, not the moral\nwrongfulness of violating their rules, that justifies bringing\ncriminal law into existence (Chiao 2016).\n\n\nA third objection returns us to the asymmetry discussed at\nthe end of section 1. Many of the powers and permissions by means of\nwhich criminal justice is done are withheld from private persons. Most\nobviously, private persons are not typically permitted to use force to\npunish others for crime. Few think that this should be changed.\nVigilantism should remain criminal. If the values that justify having\ncriminal law are essentially public, we appear to have an easy\nexplanation of this fact: private persons cannot, even in principle,\nrealise the values that justify criminal punishment; so they should\nnot be permitted to punish. If those values are not essentially\npublic, things are more difficult. There will surely be cases in which\nprivate persons are best placed to discharge \\(D\\)\u2019s secondary\nduties\u2014in which the state will not punish \\(D\\), but our\nimagined moot court would fine \\(D\\) a proportionate amount. It is not\nimmediately clear that those who find criminal law\u2019s general\njustification in impersonal values can explain why the moot court may\nnot extract the money (Thorburn 2011a, 92\u201393).\n\n\nLet us take the third objection first. If impersonal values justify\nhaving criminal law, we have reason to opt for whichever set of legal\nrules will realise those values most efficiently. If one set of powers\nand permissions will achieve more of the value in question at a lower\ncost, we should\u2014all else being equal\u2014opt for that set. Now\ncompare two sets of rules. One permits state officials and private\npersons alike to use force to punish criminals. Another withholds the\npermissions granted to the former from the latter. We have good reason\nto think that the first set of rules would bring with it significant\ncosts. Private persons are likely to make more mistakes about who\ncommitted crimes, and about how much punishment is appropriate for\ncriminality. Different private punishers are unlikely to punish\nsimilarly placed offenders in similar amounts. And as their actions\nare less easily subjected to public scrutiny, private persons are less\neasily compelled to punish for the right reasons\u2014in order to do\njustice rather than settle scores, get revenge, or maximise their\nprofit margins (Moore 2009a, 42; Edwards forthcoming). Avoiding these costs\nis a strong reason to opt for the second set of rules. True, that set\nprevents proportionate punishment being imposed by our imagined moot\ncourt. But it is plausible to think that this benefit is outweighed by\nthe aforementioned costs. If it is, those who appeal to impersonal\nvalues to justify criminal law can explain why the moot court is not\npermitted to force us to give up our money.\n\n\nAccording to the second objection, what justifies having criminal law\nis its role in stabilizing valuable institutions. Notice, however,\nthat if violating the rules of a valuable institution contributes to\nits destabilization, we will often have a moral duty to conform to the\ninstitution\u2019s rules. By preventing these wrongs, and holding\nwrongdoers responsible, we stabilize the institutions. The contrast\nbetween a general justification focused on moral wrongdoing, and one\nfocused on institutional stability, therefore turns out to be a false\ncontrast (Tadros 2016, 135). These observations help make a more\ngeneral point. We can accept that criminal law is a tool properly used\nto support financial, educational, familial, military, and political\ninstitutions. We can also accept that it is not any old\ntool\u2014that criminal law is \u2018a great moral machine, stamping\nstigmata on its products, painfully \u201crubbing in\u201d moral\njudgments on the people who entered at one end as\n\u201csuspects\u201d and emerged from the other end as condemned\nprisoners\u2019 (Feinberg 1987, 155).  It is precisely because\ncriminal law is a tool of this special kind\u2014a \u2018morally\nloaded sledgehammer\u2019 (Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n10)\u2014that its general justification is plausibly found in\npreventing and responding to moral wrongs (cf. Tadros 2016,\n68\u201370).\n\n\nIf this kind of general justification is not too restrictive, is it\nnonetheless too expansive? This was the first of the three objections\nraised above. Let us grant that some moral wrongs are not the criminal\nlaw\u2019s business. We need not infer that criminal law is\nunconcerned with moral wrongness. We need only accept that there are\nfacts about criminalization which give law-makers a duty not to\ncriminalize some moral wrongs. There are many such facts, and their\nforce varies depending on the wrong (Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n189\u2013211; Moore 2014). In some cases, criminalizing a wrong will\ninevitably result in selective enforcement, raising concerns about\nselection being made on discriminatory grounds. In others, enforcement\nwould necessitate gross invasions of privacy, and require the law to\ntake sides in conflicts better resolved by the parties themselves.\nThere is often value in freely choosing not to act wrongly, and in so\nchoosing for the right reasons, rather than because one was coerced:\ncriminalizing a wrong may result in this value disappearing from the\nworld. It will almost inevitably divert scarce resources from other\nvaluable priorities. And there is often reason to think that\ncriminalization will not result in there being less wrongdoing in the\nworld. Criminal conduct may be driven underground rather than made\nless common. Institutions of punishment may house unseen abuse and\nvictimization. Ex-offenders may be driven towards crime by their\nreduced prospects in life. Where reasons like these generate a duty\nnot to criminalize a wrong, the conduct in question is no business of\nthe criminal law. There is nothing here to cast doubt on the thought\nthat criminal law\u2019s general justification consists in\npreventing, and holding people responsible for, moral wrongs.\n",
