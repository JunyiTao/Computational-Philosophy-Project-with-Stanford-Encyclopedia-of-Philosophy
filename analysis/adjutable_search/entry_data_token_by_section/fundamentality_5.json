Well-Foundedness\n\nAs we noted in the very beginning of this entry, one of the two key\ntasks for the notion of fundamentality is to capture the idea that\nthere is a foundation of being and that everything else depends on the\nfundamental entities. This idea about fundamentality is often\nexpressed in terms of well-foundedness (Morganti 2009: 272;\nOrilia 2009: 333; Fine 2010: 100; Schaffer 2010a: 37; Bennett 2011a:\n30; Bliss 2013: 416; Trogdon 2013: 108; Tahko 2014: 260; Raven 2016:\n614; Bohn 2018; Jago 2018; Pearson forthcoming). But the notion of\nwell-foundedness itself is sometimes used without much further\nqualification, and there are many instances where another term is used\ninstead for what is clearly the same general idea (e.g., Lowe 1998:\n158; R. Cameron 2008; Paseau 2010; Rosen 2010). A common formulation\nof this general idea is as follows: a priority/dependence chain is\nwell-founded if and only if it terminates, i.e., has an end\nconstituted by one or more entities that do not depend on any other\nentity. But not all the above-mentioned authors would be happy with\nthis particular formulation, and it turns out that sometimes\nphilosophers may even have talked past each other due to having\nslightly different formulations of well-foundedness in mind.\nFortunately, the literature has matured, and we now have a number of\nmuch more precise accounts of the various potential formulations of\nwell-foundedness (see especially Dixon 2016; Rabin & Rabern 2016;\nLitland 2016b; Wigglesworth 2018).\n\nLet\u2019s start with the origin of the term\n\u201cwell-foundedness\u201d. The term is familiar from mathematics,\nespecially set theory; no doubt it was adopted from set theory with\nthe hope of making the metaphysical idea more precise. A simple\nformulation of set-theoretic well-foundedness can be found in Cotnoir\nand Bacon (2012: 187):\n\n\nAn order < on a domain is said to be wellfounded if every\nnonempty subset of that domain has a <-minimal element.\n\n\nThe first thing to notice here is that well-foundedness is relativized\nto a giver order, a given relation of dependence, just like\n (RI)\n in\n section 1.2.\n So, strictly speaking, we ought to specify which relation we have in\nmind and consider the various complications that this introduces,\nwhich we discussed in\n section 1.\n However, much of the literature on well-foundedness (although not all\nof it) focuses on grounding, and for purposes of exposition it is\neasiest to focus on this literature, also assuming that grounding\nestablishes an absolute order of priority.\n\nThe set-theoretic formulation of well-foundedness is the sense in\nwhich, e.g., Fine (2010: 100) appears to use the notion. Applied to\nchains of grounding, the proposal is that well-foundedness would rule\nout infinite, non-terminating grounding chains and entail that\n\u201cthe grounds of any truth that is grounded will \u2018bottom\nout\u2019 in truths that are ungrounded\u201d. We can see slightly\ndifferent but equivalent formulations in Schaffer (2010a, 37), Bennett\n(2011a, 30), Trogdon (2013: 108), Tahko (2014: 260), Dixon (2016:\n452), and Jago\n (2018).[19]\n As Dixon (ibid.) puts it, the attraction of using the set-theoretic\nnotion of well-foundedness is that it is a straightforward application\nof the standard mathematical definition of a well-founded relation\n(this is also recognized by Morganti 2015: 556fn2). The only problem\nis that the standard understanding of well-foundedness may be too\nstrict for the task at hand. Many authors have considered weakened\nversions of the well-foundedness requirement, which may be more\nsuitable for expressing the desired limits on infinite grounding\nchains (R. Cameron 2008: 4; Trogdon 2013: 108; Leuenberger 2014:\n170\u2013171). So, to summarize, it might at first seem intuitive to\ninterpret well-foundedness simply as a ban on infinite chains and\ncycles of grounding, in accordance with set-theoretic\nwell-foundedness. But this would seem to go against the intuition that\nthere are cases of infinite chaining which are acceptable for the\nfoundationalist metaphysician (R. Cameron 2008; Bliss 2013). This has\nrecently been made explicit by Dixon (2016) and Rabin & Rabern\n (2016).[20]\n\nTo get us started on the idea that foundationalist metaphysicians\ncould accept violations of well-foundedness, consider an important\nobservation by Bliss (2013: 416), which also comes up, e.g., in Rabin\n& Rabern (2016: 362). She distinguishes between finite and\nwell-founded grounding chains where a finite grounding chain not only\nterminates in something fundamental, but is also such that we can\nreach the fundamental entities in a finite number of steps from\nanywhere in the chain. According to this approach, a well-founded\ngrounding chain is indeed one that is grounded in something\nfundamental, but it may itself be infinitely long. So, on this\nterminology, finite grounding chains are always well-founded, but a\nwell-founded grounding chain could be infinite. But note that this\nalready violates set-theoretic well-foundedness as defined above. To\ndemonstrate this, consider an infinite chain of dependence \\(f <\n\\ldots d_{3} < d_{2} < d_{1}\\), where the chain of dependent\nentities \\(d_{n}\\) terminates in some minimal element f. Now,\nif we take a subset of that chain of dependence without the minimal\nelement f, then we are left with a chain that lacks a\n<-minimal element, hence violating the set-theoretic definition of\nwell-foundedness.\n\nTo get clearer on what is at issue here, let us introduce another\nnotion, being \u201cbounded from below\u201d or \u201chaving a\nlower bound\u201d. We can say that an order < on a domain is\nbounded from below if any subset of that domain has a lower bound.\nMore precisely, a lower bound of a given set is any element that is\nmore minimal or equal to all of the elements of the set. For example,\n1, 2, and 3 are all lower bounds of the interval [3, 4, 5]. A lower\nbound of a set does not need to be an element of the set itself.\nConsequently, the chain \\(f < \\ldots d_{3} < d_{2} < d_{1}\\),\nis bounded from below. More generally, any finite chain is\nset-theoretically well-founded and bounded from below. We\u2019ve\njust seen that some infinitely descending chains of dependence may be\nbounded from below yet fail to be set-theoretically well-founded. As\nRabin & Rabern (2016: 360) put it, an infinitely descending chain\nmay or may not have a \u201climit\u201d, where limit is the greatest\nlower bound of a set. In the previous example, 3 is the greatest lower\nbound of the interval [3, 4, 5]. So, one might suggest that the\nrelevant sense of metaphysical well-foundedness is captured either by\nthis idea of being bounded from below or by having a limit, a greatest\nlower bound. But it turns out that even these may be too strong. This\nis the key insight in the recent work of Dixon and Rabin & Rabern.\nIf this is right, then we need to have a sense of a metaphysical\nfoundation that is not only compatible with infinite chains of\ndependence, but also with infinite chains that do not have a lower\nbound (i.e., \u201cunbounded\u201d\n chains).[21]\n\nIt might be helpful to present a somewhat simplified example of a case\nwhere well-foundedness and being bounded from below come apart. Let us\nuse a variation of Trogdon\u2019s (2018b) reconstruction of an\nexample by Rabin & Rabern (2016: 361; this is an example of what\nDixon 2016: 448 calls a \u201cfully pedestalled chain\u201d).\nConsider a spherical region of space S, which we divide up in\nsuch a way that each of the proper sub-regions of S has a\nproper sub-region, and each of those sub-regions in turn has a proper\nsub-region. In principle, we can continue this process infinitely.\nNow, let us assume that each region of space derives its being in part\nfrom (or is partially grounded in) its sub-regions. Here we would seem\nto have an infinite regress where, to use the familiar phrase, being\nis forever deferred, never achieved. But suppose in addition that\nthere are spatial points and that these points are fundamental. Then\nwe might like to say that S and indeed each of its infinitely\nmany proper sub-regions fully derives its being from (or is fully\ngrounded in) spatial points. In this case, the infinite regress of the\nsub-regions would appear to be innocuous since each of them is after\nall fully accounted for by the fundamental spatial points. Still, the\ncase for a sense of fundamentality that is compatible with at least\nsome kind of non-well-founded infinite descent or other seems to have\nbeen made sufficiently clear in recent work. Metaphysical\nfoundationalism does not seem to be properly captured by the idea of\nset-theoretic well-foundedness. So, what is it about?\n\nWe can find numerous formally precise attempts to capture the relevant\nsense of a metaphysical foundation in recent work. Dixon\u2019s\n(2016: 446) preferred understanding (which he calls \u201cfull\nfoundations\u201d) suggests that every non-fundamental fact is fully\ngrounded by some fundamental fact(s). Rabin & Rabern (2016: 363)\nattempt to capture the idea of a metaphysical foundation with the\nphrase \u201chaving a foundation\u201d, whereby a grounding\nstructure has a foundation if and only if there is some set of facts\nthat (i) together ground all the derivative facts and (ii) are\nthemselves ungrounded. Raven suggests (2016: 612) that metaphysical\nfoundationalism could be understood in terms of\nineliminability (to be discussed in\n section 3).\n Tahko (2014: 263) tries to analyze metaphysical foundationalism in\nterms of an \u201contological\u201d sense of well-foundedness, which\nrequires that an ontologically well-founded chain terminates in a\nfundamental supervenience base. Trogdon (2018b) follows the recent\nsuggestions for a weaker understanding of metaphysical foundationalism\nand defines it as the view that, necessarily, any non-fundamental\nentity is fully grounded by fundamental entities. Even though the\nterminology varies, it\u2019s quite clear that there are weaker\nsenses of metaphysical foundationalism than the one defined in terms\nof set-theoretic well-foundedness. We arrive at the following\ndefinition of metaphysical foundationalism:\n\n(MF) Every\nnon-fundamental entity is dependentD1,\nD2 \u2026 DN on some fundamental\nentity or entities that fully account for its\nbeing/reality.\n\n\nThis definition of metaphysical foundationalism is somewhat vague\nsince it attempts to capture the idea for all the different varieties\nof fundamentality that we have discussed, but it may be supplemented\nwith an appropriate restriction on the type of entities it concerns\n(e.g., facts) and the subscripts \\(D_{1}\\), \\(D_{2}\\) \u2026\n\\(D_{N}\\) may be replaced with one\u2019s preferred kind or kinds of\ndependence, exactly as with the schemas proposed in\n (AI)\n and\n (RI)\n in\n section 1.\n Furthermore, we need to understand \u201cfully account for\u201d\ncorrespondingly, for instance, in the case of grounding it should be\nparsed as \u201cfully grounds\u201d and in the case of compositional\ndependence it should be parsed as \u201cfully composes\u201d (albeit\nin some cases it may not be entirely clear that a full/partial\ndistinction properly applies). Now that we have a working notion of\nmetaphysical foundationalism, we may proceed to discuss arguments in\nfavor and against this view.\n",
