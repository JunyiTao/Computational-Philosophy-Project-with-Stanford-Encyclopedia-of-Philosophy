Morality, Religion, and Politics\n\nThese basic building blocks of Machiavelli\u2019s thought have\ninduced considerable controversy among his readers going back to the\nsixteenth century, when he was denounced as an apostle of the Devil,\nbut also was read and applied sympathetically by authors (and\npoliticians) enunciating the doctrine of \u201creason of state\u201d\n(Meinecke 1924 [1957]). The main source of dispute concerned\nMachiavelli\u2019s attitude toward conventional moral and religious\nstandards of human conduct, mainly in connection with The\nPrince. For many, his teaching endorses immoralism or, at least,\namoralism. The most extreme versions of this reading find Machiavelli\nto be a \u201cteacher of evil\u201d, in the famous words of Leo\nStrauss (1958: 9\u201310), on the grounds that he counsels leaders to\navoid the common values of justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and\nlove of their people in preference to the use of cruelty, violence,\nfear, and deception. A more moderate school of thought, associated\nwith Benedetto Croce (1925), views Machiavelli as simply a\n\u201crealist\u201d or a \u201cpragmatist\u201d advocating the\nsuspension of commonplace ethics in matters of politics. Moral values\nhave no place in the sorts of decisions that political leaders must\nmake, and it is a category error of the gravest sort to think\notherwise. Perhaps the mildest version of the amoral hypothesis has\nbeen proposed by Quentin Skinner (1978), who claims that the\nruler\u2019s commission of acts deemed vicious by convention is a\n\u201clast best\u201d option. Concentrating on the claim in The\nPrince that a head of state ought to do good if he can but must\nbe prepared to commit evil if he must (Prince CW 58), Skinner\nargues that Machiavelli prefers conformity to moral virtue ceteris\nparibus.\n\nDisinterest in ethical concerns also permeates the claim, popular in\nthe early- and mid-twentieth century, that Machiavelli simply adopts\nthe stance of a scientist\u2014a kind of \u201cGalileo of\npolitics\u201d\u2014in distinguishing between the\n\u201cfacts\u201d of political life and the \u201cvalues\u201d of\nmoral judgment (Olschki 1945; Cassirer 1946; Prezzolini 1954 [1967]).\nHe is thereby set into the context of the scientific revolution more\ngenerally. The point of Machiavellian \u201cscience\u201d is not to\ndistinguish between \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cunjust\u201d forms\nof government, but to explain how politicians deploy power for their\nown gain. Thus, Machiavelli rises to the mantle of the founder of\n\u201cmodern\u201d political science, in contrast with\nAristotle\u2019s classical norm-laden vision of a political science\nof virtue. More recently, the Machiavelli-as-scientist interpretation\nhas largely gone out of favor (Viroli 1998 1\u20133), although some\nhave recently found merit in a revised version of the thesis (e.g.,\nDyer and Nederman 2016).\n\nOther of Machiavelli\u2019s readers have found no taint of immorality\nor amoralism in his thought whatsoever. Jean-Jacques Rousseau long ago\nheld that the real lesson of The Prince is to teach the\npeople the truth about how princes behave and thus to expose, rather\nthan celebrate, the immorality at the core of one-man rule (quoted in\nConnell 2005, 178). Various versions of this thesis have been\ndisseminated more recently. Some scholars, such as Garrett Mattingly\n(1958), have pronounced Machiavelli the supreme satirist, pointing out\nthe foibles of princes and their advisors. The fact that Machiavelli\nlater wrote biting popular stage comedies is cited as evidence in\nsupport of his strong satirical bent. Thus, we should take nothing\nMachiavelli says about moral conduct at face value, but instead should\nunderstand his remarks as sharply humorous commentary on public\naffairs. Alternatively, Mary Deitz (1986) asserts that\nMachiavelli\u2019s agenda was driven by a desire to\n\u201ctrap\u201d the prince by offering carefully crafted advice\n(such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken\nseriously and followed.\n\nA similar range of opinions exists in connection with\nMachiavelli\u2019s attitude toward religion in general, and\nChristianity in particular. Machiavelli was no friend of the\ninstitutionalized Christian Church as he knew it. The\nDiscourses makes clear that conventional Christianity saps\nfrom human beings the vigor required for active civil life (CW\n228\u2013229, 330\u2013331). And The Prince speaks with\nequal parts disdain and admiration about the contemporary condition of\nthe Church and its Pope (CW 29, 44\u201346, 65, 91\u201392). Many\nscholars have taken such evidence to indicate that Machiavelli was\nhimself profoundly anti-Christian, preferring the pagan civil\nreligions of ancient societies such as Rome, which he regarded to be\nmore suitable for a city endowed with virt\u00f9. Anthony\nParel (1992) argues that Machiavelli\u2019s cosmos, governed by the\nmovements of the stars and the balance of the humors, takes on an\nessentially pagan and pre-Christian cast. For others, Machiavelli may\nbest be described as a man of conventional, if unenthusiastic, piety,\nprepared to bow to the externalities of worship but not deeply devoted\nin either soul or mind to the tenets of Christian faith. A few\ndissenting voices, most notably Sebastian de Grazia (1989) and\nMaurizio Viroli (2006 [2010]), have attempted to rescue\nMachiavelli\u2019s reputation from those who view him as hostile or\nindifferent to Christianity. Grazia demonstrates how central biblical\nthemes run throughout Machiavelli\u2019s writings, finding there a\ncoherent conception of a divinely centered and ordered cosmos in which\nother forces (\u201cthe heavens\u201d, \u201cfortune\u201d, and\nthe like) are subsumed under a divine will and plan. Cary Nederman\nextends and systematizes Grazia\u2019s insights by showing how such\ncentral Christian theological doctrines as grace, free will and prayer\nform important elements of Machiavelli\u2019s conceptual framework\n(2009: 28\u201349; Nederman and Lahoud 2023). Viroli considers, by\ncontrast, the historical attitudes toward the Christian religion as\nmanifested in the Florentine republic of Machiavelli\u2019s day.\n",
