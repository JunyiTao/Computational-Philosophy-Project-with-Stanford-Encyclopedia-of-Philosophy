    "main_text": "Looking Ahead: New Challenges and Opportunities || Reticulation & Discordance\n3.1 Reticulation & Discordance\n\nIn the previous sections we treated phylogenetic trees as\nstraight-forwardly bifurcating models, regularly referring back to\n Figure 1.\n Branches represent ancestral lineages, and nodes represent lineage\nsplits. Yet, this view of phylogenetics is also highly idealized,\nreflecting at least three simplifying assumptions: (1) that lineages\nsplit but do not fuse; (2) that changes on one lineage do not affect\nother lineages, and (3) that splits are singular, simple events. Each\nof these assumptions turn out to be false.\n\nIn order to think about how lineages split or fuse, we have to first\nanswer the question of what a lineage represents. In the case of a\nphylogeny where the tips are species, the natural answer is that the\nlineages are tracking species through time and the nodes represent\nspeciation events. But consider the assumption that lineages split but\ndo not fuse. For many readers, hybridization may be the most obvious\ncounter-example. After all, hybridization is relatively familiar,\nespecially for cases involving sexually reproducing charismatic\nmega-fauna and, even more frequently, plants.\n\nIn the case of speciation by hybridization, it is clear that entire\nlineages can fuse. Exactly how often this occurs is disputed and of\ncourse will depend on how you define species in the first place. But\nit is a widespread occurrence in plants and is known to happen in\nanimals as well (Mallet 2007; Schumer, Rosenthal, & Andolfatto\n2014).\n\nWhile most occurrences of hybridization do not lead to new species,\nmany often lead to introgression\u2013that is, the introduction of\ngenetic information from one lineage to another. If we model this as\none lineage connecting to another, we violate the assumption that a\nphylogeny is a strictly branching tree diagram. But if we instead do\nnot depict these lineages as directly connected, then we violate\nanother background assumption in phylogenetics, namely, that changes\nalong one branch do not affect any other branches. In either case, we\nnow have a situation where the branching history of some characters is\nnot the same as the history of others or of the history of the species\nas a whole. In the case of genetic history, this is known as\ngenealogical discordance.\n\nWhile hybridization among sexually reproducing species already\nprovides good counter-examples to our assumptions about the\nindependence of lineages, the bigger challenges have come from\n microbiology\n. More\nspecifically, what we find in microbial genomics are high levels of\nhorizontal (or lateral) gene transfer (HGT or LGT). For readers\nunfamiliar with microbial genomics, this can be thought of as the\nmicrobial analogue to hybridization, though there are important\nqualitative and quantitative differences.\n\nQualitatively, HGT is not a mode of reproduction, though it does\ninvolve the transfer of genomic parts between microbes. Unlike in\nreproduction, the genomic transfer is not (typically) between parent\nand offspring microbes, but adjacent ones. Roughly, when microbes make\ncontact, they can exchange parts of their genome, which means that the\nhistory of these genomic parts may be distinct from the history of the\nmicrobial organisms in which we find those genetic units. HGT can be\nhighly advantageous for microbes, and genomic parts can quickly spread\nthrough microbial populations, especially if they carry beneficial\ncharacteristics. Quantitatively, the rate of HGT in microbes is\nenormously high and commonplace, especially relative to hybridization\nin, say, mammalian species.\n\nThe upshot of widespread HGT is that microbial genes will frequently\nhave different histories, and genetic parts will sometimes flow from\none lineage to very distantly related lineages. Microbialists and\nphilosophers of biology have taken up the question of whether\nreticulation in microbial histories is enough to entirely undercut the\nutility of phylogenetics in microbial genomics, and how this has\nimpacted the utility of the tree of life metaphor more\ngenerally (e.g., Martin 1999; Doolittle 1999; Velasco 2013 see too the\nspecial issue of Biology & Philosophy [O\u2019Malley,\nMartin, & Dupr\u00e9 2010]).\n\nThe final simplifying assumption treats lineage splits as singular\nevents that wholly separate a lineage into two distinct new branches\nthat we can cleanly track. When we think about the process of\nspeciation, it is clear that speciation and lineage separation more\ngenerally is often not instantaneous (de Queiroz 1998; Harrison 1998).\nWhat is less clear is how this matters to phylogenetics. Thinking\ncarefully about lineage splits and the internal structure of lineages\nforces us to examine the nature and relationships of the multilevel\norganization of the lineages we track (Haber 2012, 2019). More\ninclusive lineages contain less-inclusive lineages as parts,\nreflecting the hierarchical organization found in biology\u2013a\nfeature of lineages well appreciated by early phylogeneticists, e.g.,\nHennig 1966; Griffiths 1974). Species trees, for example, contain gene\ntrees within their branches (Maddison 1997).\n\nWhen individual gene histories are incongruent with each other or with\ntheir containing species trees we have genealogical discordance. We\nhave already seen how hybridization and horizontal gene transfer can\ncause discordance, but as systematics has become increasingly\nconnected with population genetics, another source of discordance has\nloomed large\u2014incomplete lineage sorting. Any two copies of a\ngene in a population will share a common ancestor in the past called\ntheir point of coalescence. If two gene lineages in the same species\nlineage fail to coalesce within that species branch (that is, their\npoint of coalescence is earlier than than the most recent speciation\nor lineage branching) we have what is called incomplete lineage\nsorting (ILS). In a case of incomplete lineage sorting it is\npossible that one of the gene lineages first coalesces with a gene\nlineage from another species and thus is a case of genealogical\ndiscordance. This generates what Avise and Robinson (2008) have termed\nhemiplasies, i.e., homologous characters whose phylogenetic\nhistories are topologically discordant with higher level phylogenies\ndue to ILS. Maddison (1997) provides a very readable introduction to\nthe relationship between gene trees and species trees and the problems\nof genealogical discordance while Degnan and Rosenberg (2009) is a\nslightly more advanced introduction to the biology of incomplete\nlineage sorting and its affects on phylogenetic inference.\n\nTo summarize, we first discussed phylogenetic inference as it was\ntypically done prior to around the 1990s. First, infer the history of\na number of characters (for example, genes). Each of these histories\nis a particular, branching tree. Now assume that these histories are\nthe same as the species history. It is this assumption that allows\nmethods such as parsimony or likelihood to evaluate competing\nhypotheses. The species history is then also a branching tree even\nthough we know that in general, this is a kind of idealization\nassuming that (1) that lineages split but do not fuse, (2) that\ninformation is not transferred between lineages , and (3) that splits\nare singular, simple events. Each of these assumptions turn out to be\nfalse.\n",
