Spinoza\u2019s\nresponse is that \u201cauthority in sacred matters belongs wholly to\nthe sovereign powers \u201d (Ch.  19, title). Like Hobbes, he\nembraces the Erastian position that religious law is realized through\nthe will of the civil authority (TTP, Ch. 19). The crux of the single\nauthority thesis is this: the sovereign is the sole civil and\nreligious authority. Indeed, because piety consists in practicing\njustice and obedience, and because there is no standard of justice\nother than the will of the sovereign (TTP 19, 239ff; EIVP37S2),\n\u201cit is also the duty of the sovereign authority alone to lay\ndown how a person should behave with piety towards their neighbor,\nthat is, to determine how one is obliged to obey God\u201d (TTP 19,\n242\u20133). The obvious, yet important, implication of the single\nauthority thesis is that clerics are at best spiritual advisors with\nno real claim to political power. The problem of dual allegiances\n(divine and civil) is overcome, since the two authorities converge in\nthe form of the sovereign.\n\n\nThe argument against ecclesiastical power here depends upon the\nsupposition that there is no transcendental standard of piety. Of\ncourse, a sovereign could delegate authority to religious\nfunctionaries, but Spinoza cautions against this, using the case of\nthe Hebrews to illustrate the dangers of priestly authority. The\ndecisive turn that precipitated the decline of the first Hebrew state\ncame with the ascendance of a priestly order. On Spinoza\u2019s account,\nunder Moses, civil law and religion \u201cwere one and the same\nthing\u201d (TTP 17, 213) and the Jews lived peaceably.  However, when\nthe priests\u2014chiefly the Levites\u2014were given the right to\ninterpret divine law, \u201ceach of them began seeking glory for his\nown name in religion and everything else...As a result religion\ndegenerated into fatal superstition\u201d (TTP 18, 231). The message here\nhad clear application in the Dutch context, where, as we\u2019ve noted,\nCalvinist theocrats\u2014who formed a menacing alliance with the\nhouse of Orange\u2014were increasingly wielding power to the\ndetriment of peace and stability (see Nadler 1999, 283\u20134).\n\n\nSpinoza punctuates his historical analysis of the Hebrew state by\ndrawing four lessons about the theologico-political problem, three of\nwhich are relevant here: (1) civil stability requires the limitation of\necclesiastical power; (2) it is disastrous for religious\nleaders to govern speculative matters; and (3) the sovereign\nmust remain the sole legislator. These historical observations support Spinoza\u2019s principle of toleration, which I discuss\nbelow.\n",
