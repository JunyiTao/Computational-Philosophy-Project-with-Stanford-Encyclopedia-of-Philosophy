    "main_text": "The Justice of Compulsory Voting\n4. The Justice of Compulsory Voting\n\nVoting rates in many contemporary democracies are (according to many\nobservers) low, and seem in general to be falling. The United States,\nfor instance, barely manages about 60% in presidential elections and\n45% in other elections (Brennan and Hill 2014: 3). Many other\ncountries have similarly low rates. Some democratic theorists,\npoliticians, and others think this is problematic, and advocate\ncompulsory voting as a solution. In a compulsory voting regime,\ncitizens are required to vote by law; if they fail to vote without a\nvalid excuse, they incur some sort of penalty.\n\nOne major argument for compulsory voting is what we might call the\nDemographic or Representativeness Argument (Lijphart 1997; Engelen\n2007; Galston 2011; Hill in J. Brennan and Hill 2014: 154\u2013173;\nSingh 2015). The argument begins by noting that in voluntary voting\nregimes, citizens who choose to vote are systematically different from\nthose who choose to abstain. The rich are more likely to vote than the\npoor. The old are more likely to vote than the young. Men are more\nlikely to vote than women. In many countries, ethnic minorities are\nless likely to vote than ethnic majorities. More highly educated\npeople are more likely to vote than less highly educated people.\nMarried people are more likely to vote than non-married people.\nPolitical partisans are more likely to vote than true independents\n(Leighley and Nagler 1992; Evans 2003: 152\u20136). In short, under\nvoluntary voting, the electorate\u2014the citizens who actually\nchoose to vote\u2014are not fully representative of the public at\nlarge. The Demographic Argument holds that since politicians tend to\ngive voters what they want, in a voluntary voting regime, politicians\nwill tend to advance the interests of advantaged citizens (who vote\ndisproportionately) over the disadvantaged (who tend not to vote).\nCompulsory voting would tend to ensure that the disadvantaged vote in\nhigher numbers, and would thus tend to ensure that everyone\u2019s\ninterests are properly represented.\n\nRelatedly, one might argue compulsory voting helps citizens overcome\nan \u201cassurance problem\u201d (Hill 2006). The thought here is\nthat an individual voter realizes her individual vote has little\nsignificance. What\u2019s important is that enough other voters like\nher vote. However, she cannot easily coordinate with other voters and\nensure they will vote with her. Compulsory voting solves this problem.\nFor this reason, Lisa Hill (2006: 214\u201315) concludes,\n\u201cRather than perceiving the compulsion as yet another unwelcome\nform of state coercion, compulsory voting may be better understood as\na coordination necessity in mass societies of individual strangers\nunable to communicate and coordinate their preferences.\u201d\n\nWhether the Demographic Argument succeeds or not depends on a few\nassumptions about voter and politician behavior. First, political\nscientists overwhelmingly find that voters do not vote their\nself-interest, but instead vote for what they perceive to be the\nnational interest. (See the dozens of papers cited at Brennan and Hill\n2014: 38\u20139n28.) Second, it might turn out that disadvantaged\ncitizens are not informed enough to vote in ways that promote their\ninterests\u2014they might not have sufficient social scientific\nknowledge to know which candidates or political parties will help them\n(Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Caplan 2007; Somin 2013). Third, it\nmay be that even in a compulsory voting regime, politicians can get\naway with ignoring the policy preferences of most voters (Gilens 2012;\nBartels 2010).\n\nIn fact, contrary to many theorists\u2019 expectations, it appears\nthat compulsory voting has no significant effect on individual\npolitical knowledge (that is, it does not induce ignorant voters to\nbecome better informed), individual political conversation and\npersuasion, individual propensity to contact politicians, the\npropensity to work with others to address concerns, participation in\ncampaign activities, the likelihood of being contacted by a party or\npolitician, the quality of representation, electoral integrity, the\nproportion of female members of parliament, support for small or third\nparties, support for the left, or support for the far right (Birch\n2009; Highton and Wolfinger 2001). Political scientists have also been\nunable to demonstrate that compulsory voting leads to more egalitarian\nor left-leaning policy outcomes. The empirical literature so far shows\nthat compulsory voting gets citizens to vote, but it\u2019s not clear\nit does much else.\n\n",
