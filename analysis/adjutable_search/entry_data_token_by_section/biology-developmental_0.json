    "main_text": "Overview || Historical Considerations\n1.1 Historical Considerations\n\nDevelopmental biology is the science that investigates how a variety\nof interacting processes generate an organism\u2019s heterogeneous\nshapes, size, and structural features that arise on the trajectory\nfrom embryo to adult, or more generally throughout a life cycle (Love\n2008; Minelli 2011a). It represents an exemplary area of contemporary\nexperimental biology that focuses on phenomena that have puzzled\nnatural philosophers and scientists for more than two millennia. How\ndo the dynamic relations among seemingly homogeneous components in the\nearly stages of an embryo produce a unified whole organism containing\nheterogeneous parts in the appropriate arrangement and with correct\ninterconnections? More succinctly, how do we explain ontogeny\n(or, more archaically, generation)? In Generation of\nAnimals, Aristotle provided the first systematic investigation of\ndevelopmental phenomena and recognized key issues about the emergence\nof and relationships between hierarchically organized parts (e.g.,\nbone and anatomical features containing bone), as well as the\nexplanatory difficulty of determining how a morphological form is\nachieved reliably in offspring (e.g., the typical shape and structure\nof appendages in a particular species). Generation remained a poignant\nquestion throughout the early modern period and was explored by many\nkey figures writing at the time, including William Harvey, Ren\u00e9\nDescartes, Robert Boyle, Pierre Gassendi, Nicolas Malebranche,\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Anne Conway, Immanuel Kant, and others\n(Smith 2006). Observations of life cycle transitions, such as\nmetamorphosis, fed into these endeavors and led to striking\nconclusions, such as Leibniz\u2019s denial of generation sensu\nstricto.\n\n\nAnimals and all other organized substances have no\nbeginning \u2026 their apparent generation is only a development, a\nkind of augmentation \u2026 a transformation like any other, for\ninstance like that of a caterpillar into a butterfly. (Smith 2011:\n186\u2013187)\n\n\nA major theme that crystallized in this history of investigation is\nthe distinction between epigenesis and preformation (see the entry on\n theories of biological development).\n Proponents of epigenesis claimed that heterogeneous, complex features\nof form emerge from homogeneous, less complex embryonic structures\nthrough interactive processes. Thus, an explanation of the ontogeny of\nthese form features requires accounting for how the interactions\noccur. Proponents of preformation claimed that complex form preexists\nin the embryo and \u201cunfolds\u201d via ordinary growth processes.\nAn adequate explanation involves detailing how growth occurs. Although\npreformation has a lighter explanatory burden in accounting for how\nform emerges during ontogeny (on the assumption that growth is easier\nto explain than process interactions), it also must address how the\nstarting point of the next generation is formed with the requisite\nheterogeneous complex features. This was sometimes accomplished by\nembedding smaller and smaller miniatures ad infinitum inside\nthe organism\n (Figure 1).\n Epigenetic perspectives were often dependent on forms of teleological\nreasoning (see the entry on\n teleological notions in biology)\n to account for why interactions among homogeneous components\neventually result in a complex, integrated whole organism. Though\nnothing prevents mixing features of these two outlooks in explaining\ndifferent aspects of development, polarization into dichotomous\npositions has occurred frequently (Rose 1981; Smith 2006).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An early modern depiction of a\ntiny person inside of a sperm exemplifying preformationist views. \n\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the\ntopic of development was salient in controversies surrounding\nvitalism, such as the disagreement between Wilhelm Roux and Hans\nDriesch over how to explain ontogeny (Maienschein 1991). Roux thought\nthat a fertilized egg contains inherited elements that represent\ndifferent organismal characteristics. During the process of cellular\ndivision, these elements become unequally distributed among daughter\ncells leading to distinct cell fates. Driesch, in contrast, held that\neach cell retained its full potential through division even though\ndifferentiation occurred. Although this issue is often understood in\nterms of the metaphysics of life (vitalism versus\nmaterialism), Driesch\u2019s interpretation of development and the\nautonomy of an organism had epistemological dimensions (Maienschein\n2000). The explanatory disagreement involved different experimental\napproaches and divergent views on the nature of differentiation in\nearly ontogeny (e.g., to what degree cells are pre-specified). A\nfamiliar philosophical theme running through these discussions, both\nepistemological and metaphysical, is the status of\n reductionism in biology.\n Through the middle of the 20th century,\nembryology\u2014the scientific discipline studying\ndevelopment\u2014slowly transformed into developmental biology with a\nvariety of reworked and recalcitrant elements (Berrill 1961). In\nconjunction with the issue of reductionism, a key aspect of this\nhistory is the molecularization of experimental (as opposed to\ncomparative) embryology (Fraser and Harland 2000), with a concomitant\nemphasis on the explanatory power of genes (see the entry on\n gene\n and\n Section 3.1).\n This complex and fascinating history, including interrelations with\nmedicine and reproductive technology, has been detailed elsewhere\n(see, e.g., Oppenheimer 1967; Horder et al. 1986; Hamburger 1988;\nHopwood 2019; Maienschein 2014; Maienschein et al. 2005; Gilbert 1991;\nEmbryo Project in Other Internet Resources).\n\nDevelopmental biology has increasingly become an area of exploration\nfor\n philosophy of biology\n due to the potential relevance of development for understanding\nevolution (Love 2015;\n Section 5),\n the theme of reductionism in biology and explanations from molecular\ngenetics (Robert 2004; Rosenberg 2006;\n Section 3),\n and via increased attention to the details of particular research\nprograms, such as stem cell biology (Fagan 2013; Laplane 2016).\nHowever, it should not be forgotten that ontogeny was on the radar of\nphilosophical scholars in the 20th century, as seen in\nErnest Nagel\u2019s treatment of hierarchical organization and\nreduction in the development of living systems (Nagel 1961: 432ff).\nFor contemporary philosophy of science, developmental biology displays\na rich array of material and conceptual practices that can be analyzed\nto better understand the scientific reasoning exhibited in\nexperimental life science (see the entry on\n experiment in biology).\n After a brief review of some central phenomena of ontogeny, this\nentry explores four domains that represent some of the import and\npromise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of developmental\nbiology.\n",
