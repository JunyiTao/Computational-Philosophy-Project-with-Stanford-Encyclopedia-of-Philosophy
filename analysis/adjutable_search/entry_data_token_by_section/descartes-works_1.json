    "main_text": "The World and Discourse\n2. The World and Discourse\n\nAfter Descartes left the army, in 1619, his whereabouts for the next\nfew years are unknown. Based on what he says in the Discours de la\nMethode (Discourse on the Method), published in 1637,\nthere is speculation that he spent time near Ulm (Descartes apparently\nattended the coronation of Ferdinand II in Frankfurt in 1619). There\nis some evidence suggesting that he was in France in 1622, for it was\nat this time that property he had inherited was sold\u2014the\nproceeds of which would provide him a simple income for many years.\nThere is some speculation that between 1623 and 1625 he visited Italy.\nDescartes emerges in 1625 in Paris, his notes revealing that he was in\ncontact with Father Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648), a member of the\nOrder of Minims. This relationship would prompt Descartes to make\npublic his thoughts on natural philosophy (science). It is by way of\nMersenne that Descartes\u2019 work would find its way into the hands\nof some of the best minds living in Paris\u2014for instance, Antoine\nArnauld (1612\u20131694), Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655), and\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679).\n\nIn 1628 Descartes left Paris. At this time he seems to have been\nworking on the Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii (Rules for\nthe Direction of the Mind), a work that he would abandon, some\nspeculating around the time of the move from Paris. It is worth noting\nthat relatively recently a copy of the Rules was discovered\nin a library at Cambridge University. Scholars are unsure how it got\nthere. Currently, based on what it includes, it is thought that this\nmanuscript represents the work as it stood when Descartes had\nabandoned it in 1628. The later Amsterdam printing (1701) and a copy\nthat Leibniz acquired from Clerselier (c. 1670) make certain\nadvancements over what is found in the Cambridge manuscript. So, it\nappears that Descartes picked up the work again. Some have speculated\nthat this may have happened after a visit in 1635 from John Dury\n(1596\u20131680) and Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662), where Hartlib\nreports that Dury had returned to England with copies of some of\nDescartes\u2019 works (Fallon, pp. 9f); the speculation being that\nthe recently discovered manuscript is related to something brought\nback by Dury. The meeting took place in The Hague. Dury and Hartlib\nwere friends of the Cambridge philosopher Henry More\n(1614\u20131687), with whom Descartes had corresponded, and of others\nin More\u2019s circle, including John Milton (1608\u20131674).\nPerhaps the copy was made during the visit and brought back to\nCambridge. (In any event, this is a new and interesting development in\nDescartes scholarship.) In 1630 Descartes moved to Amsterdam. There he\nworked on drafts of the Dioptrique (the Optics) and\nthe Meteors (the Meteorology), which were very\nlikely intended to be a part of a larger work, Le Monde\n(The World). In 1632 he moved again, this time to Deventer,\nto apparently teach Henry Reneri (1593\u20131639) his physics. It is\nalso during his stay in Deventer that Descartes probably worked on a\nfinal draft of the Traite de l\u2019homme (Treatise on\nMan), which in connection to the Optics and the\nMeteorology was probably originally intended to be a part of\nThe World.\n\nWhen The World had become ready for publication in 1633, upon\nhearing of the Church\u2019s condemnation of Galileo\n(1564\u20131642) in the same year, Descartes decided against its\npublication. For, the world system he had adopted in the book assumed,\nas did Galileo\u2019s, the heliocentric Copernican model. In a letter\nto Mersenne, dated November 1633, Descartes expresses his fear that\nwere he to publish The World, the same fate that befell\nGalileo would befall him. And, although this is something that he\nunderstandably would want to avoid, some scholars question\nDescartes\u2019 expressed concern, for his living in the Netherlands\nwould have kept him out of reach of Catholic authorities. The\nWorld appears to have been constituted of several smaller, but\nrelated, works: a treatise on physics, a treatise on mechanics\n(machines), a treatise on animals, and a treatise on man. Although\nmuch of The World has been lost, some of it seems to have\nsurvived in the form of essays attached to the Discourse\nwhich, as was mentioned earlier, would be published four years later,\nin 1637. And, some of it was published posthumously. Arguably,\nConstantijn Huygens (1596\u20131687) received what Descartes refers\nto as \u201cthree sheets\u201d of The World, along with a\nletter dated 5 October 1637. These \u201csheets\u201d deal primarily\nwith mechanics.\n\nAround 1635, at the University of Utrecht, Reneri began teaching\n\u201cCartesian\u201d physics. Also during this year, a domestic\nservant by the name of Helene gave birth to a baby girl, Francine.\nGenevieve Rodis-Lewis claims that Francine was born 19 June 1635\n(Rodis-Lewis, p. 40). According to a baptismal record, dated 28 July\n1635, Descartes is named the father (AT I 395n). However, Gaukroger\nclaims that the baptismal date was 7 August 1635 (Gaukroger, p. 294).\nIn 1636 Reneri acquired an official chair in Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Utrecht, and continued to build a following of students\ninterested in Cartesian science. Around March of 1636, at the age of\nforty, Descartes moved to Leiden to work out the publishing of the\nDiscourse. And, in 1637 it is published. With the\nDiscourse out and a following of students building in\nUtrecht, Descartes seems to have turned his attention from career to\nfamily. In a letter dated 30 August 1637 we find him apparently\nworking out an arrangement for Francine, but strangely refers to her\nas his \u201cniece\u201d\u2014which suggests that he did not want\ncertain people to know that he was a father (or that Francine had been\nborn out of wedlock). Gaukroger suggests that despite this apparent\ndenial of paternity, Descartes not only corresponds with Francine, but\nin 1637 brings her and Helene to his new home at Santpoort or\nEgmond-Binnen (Gaukroger, pp. 294, 332).\n\nThe Discourse is the first published work of\nDescartes\u2019, coming some four years after he had abandoned\nThe World. The Discourse is important for many\nreasons. For instance, it tells us what Descartes himself seems to\nhave thought of his early education, and in particular, his early\nexposure to mathematics. Roger Ariew suggests that these reflections\nare not so much those of the historical Descartes, as much as they are\nthose of a persona Descartes adopts in telling the story of the\nDiscourse (Ariew, pp. 58\u201363). Uncontested, however, is\nthe view that the Discourse sketches out the metaphysical\nunderpinnings of the Cartesian system. And, as a bonus, it has three\nworks that are attached to it that are apparently added so as to\nexemplify the method of inquiry it develops (though admittedly it is\nunclear how the method is applied in these essays). The attached\nessays are the Optics, the Meteorology, and Le\nGeometrie (the Geometry). As was suggested earlier, the\nOptics and Meteorology were very likely versions of\nworks originally intended for The World.\n\nIt should be stressed that the three attached essays are important\nindependent of the Discourse, for they contain much worth\nstudying. In the Optics, for example, Descartes works out his\nlaws of refraction, and within this context, what would later be\ncalled Snell\u2019s Law (which Descartes seems to have worked out as\nearly as 1632). Further, although the Geometry would seem to\nhave come out of nowhere, there is evidence in Descartes\u2019s notes\nto himself, from which Clerselier reconstructed some of\nDescartes\u2019s correspondence, that he had been working on some\nversion of it as early as 1619. In a letter to Beeckman, dated 26\nMarch 1619, for example, Descartes discusses the subject matter that\nis found in the Geometry, and in a letter dated 23 April\n1619, he explicitly mentions the book\u2019s title. It is in this\nwork that Descartes shows how certain geometrical problems can be\nsolved by way of algebraic equations.\n\nThe significance of the sort of connection that Descartes made between\ngeometry and algebra was great indeed, for without it the\nmathematization of the physics and the development of the calculus\nmight not have happened when they did\u2014a generation later via Sir\nIsaac Newton (1642\u20131727) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716). It should be noted, however, that as groundbreaking\nas this work may have been, contrary to the claims of many, nowhere in\nthe Geometry is a \u201cCartesian Coordinate System\u201d\never developed (that is, the x-y coordinate system\ntaught to today\u2019s students of algebra), nor is he the originator\nof other mathematical concepts that bear his name, for example, the\n\u201cCartesian Product\u201d. Carl Boyer notes that various\nconcepts that lead to analytic geometry are found for the first time\nin the Geometry, and that the Geometry\u2019s\nmathematical notation is still used today. But, he argues, although\nCartesian geometry is taken by many to be synonymous with analytic\ngeometry, the fact is that the fundamental aim of Descartes\u2019\nsystem is quite different from that of contemporary analytic geometry\n(Boyer, pp. 370\u20131). And so, the claim that Descartes is the\noriginator of analytic geometry, at least as we understand it today,\noverstates the case. As Boyer rightly points out, however, this does\nnot diminish the importance of the work in the history of\nmathematics.\n",
