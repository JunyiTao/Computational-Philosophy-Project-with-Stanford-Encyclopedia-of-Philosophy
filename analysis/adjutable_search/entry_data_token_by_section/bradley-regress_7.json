    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || Rejectionism\n3.1 Rejectionism\n\nRejectionists about Bradleyean arguments tend to question one or more\nof the assumptions on which the argument rests. With respect to the\nregresses, rejectionists have mainly questioned the grounds of\nBradley\u2019s skepticism about relations and their relating role. As\nwe have seen in section 1.3 above, Russell employed this strategy when\ndebating Bradley in the journal Mind, in 1910. On that\noccasion, Russell argued in favor of external relations and\ntheir relating role within complexes of the form\n aRb.[3]\n\nC. D. Broad (1933) also objected to Bradley for his treatment of\nrelations; he thought that the main problem had to do with\nBradley\u2019s treatment of relations as if they were particulars in\nneed of being related themselves. He wrote, rather harshly:\n\nIt is plain that Bradley thinks of A and B as being like\ntwo objects fastened together with a bit of string, and he thinks of\nR as being like the bit of string. He then remembers that the\nobjects must be glued or sealed to both ends of the the bit of string\nif the latter is to fasten them together. And then, I suppose, another\nkind of glue is needed to fasten the second drop of glue to the object\nB on the one side and the string on the other. And so on\nwithout end. Charity bids us avert our eyes from the pitiable\nspectacle of a great philosopher using an argument which would\ndisgrace a child or a savage. (Broad 1933: 85)\n\nWe find a very similar take on Bradley\u2019s regress in Blanshard\n(1986). He argued contra Bradley that \u201cR is not\nthe same sort of being as its terms. It is neither a thing nor a\nquality. It is a relation, and the business of a relation is to\nrelate\u201d (Blanshard 1986: 215).\n\nMore of the same can also be found in Alexander (1920 [1966], vol. 1, 249,\n256) and Grossmann (1992: 55\u201356). Though they are less harsh\nthan Broad and Blanshard in their assessment of Bradley\u2019s\nregress arguments, they are unambiguous in their diagnosis of the\nproblem as one involving the wrong conception of relations. According\nto Grossmann, for instance, the correct conclusion to draw from\nBradley\u2019s regress argument is that \u201cit is really an\nargument not against relations, but against the assumption that\nrelations need to be related to what they relate\u201d (Grossmann\n1992: 55).\n\nIn recent debate, replies to Bradley\u2019s regress that bluntly\ninsist on relations\u2019 relating role have been unpopular. This is\nbecause the debate has shifted to include the associated questions\noutlined in 2.2. above, including the question: \u201cHow do\nrelations relate?\u201d. Thus, if one is after the answer to the\n\u201chow\u201d question, simply saying that it is the job of\nrelations to relate is deemed unsatisfactory.\n\nOne sort of rejectionist reply to Bradleyean arguments can be found in\nPerovic (2014). Perovic (2014) argues that Bradley\u2019s original\nregress arguments in AR rest on unsubstantiated assumptions\nand thus cannot be considered as successful reductio\narguments against relations. For example, the first regress takes for\ngranted that as long as unifying relations are conceived as\n\u201cindependent\u201d from their relata, they cannot relate. The\nsecond regress assumes that unifying of qualities cannot be achieved\nwith \u201cinternal\u201d relations either; for the latter are\nunderstood as being grounded in proper parts of qualities, which\nleads, according to Bradley, to an infinite regress. She points out\nthat it is not clear why Bradley understands internal relations as\ngrounded in proper parts of qualities that they relate, nor is it\nclear why Bradley believes that relations, if they are to have any\nstanding, ought to fill a dual role of unifying their relata as well\nas providing the ground of their distinctness. Perovic (2014)\nconcludes that without further support, Bradley\u2019s original\narguments against relations as unifiers of qualities do not establish\nthe unreality of relations; an appeal to external relations as\nunifiers of their relata is still a perfectly acceptable option for\nboth realists and trope theorists.\n",
