    "main_text": "Ethics\n5. Ethics\n\nThe third Aristotelian work on which Richard Kilvington commented\nduring his regency in the Arts Faculty was the Nicomachean\nEthics. His commentary on the second and tenth books of the\nEthics takes a form of ten questions, which deal only with\nselected issues that were the subjects of Kilvington\u2019s lectures\nat Oxford: e.g., creating and destroying moral virtue, free acts of\nvolition, the behavior of honest people and the delight taken in their\nactions (or conversely, the punishment of those who act evilly), and\nquestions concerning particular virtues such as courage, generosity,\nmagnanimity, justice, and prudence. As Micha\u0142owska has shown,\nKilvington uses terminist logic and mathematical physics to solve\nethical problems (see Micha\u0142owska 2011a,\u00a02016).\nMicha\u0142owska also shows that, just as he did in his questions on\nthe Physics, Kilvington follows Ockham\u2019s minimalist\nontology by treating ethical qualities\u2014i.e., vices and virtues,\ncognition and wisdom, good and evil\u2014as volition-like objects,\ncalling them res. Being real things and not merely mental\nconcepts, they can be measured by addition, subtraction, and division\ninto parts, for they undergo change via increase or decrease and so\nhave varying degrees of intensity. Such changes\u2014e.g., undergoing\npunishment for an evil act\u2014cannot be instantaneous and must\nhappen in time. Each change is the result of an acting power\novercoming resistance. In the case of moral acts, the changes do not\nproduce any external effects but internal modifications in terms of\nthe intensity of virtues and vices. When a vice acts upon a virtue, it\ncauses its continuous change, and so someone\u2019s courage can vary\nin intensity. Virtues and vices are opposed in Kilvington\u2019s\nphysical theory, so it is impossible for someone to be vicious and\nvirtuous at the same time, although it is possible for them to be\ngenerous at one time, miserly at another.\n\nThe increase or decrease of a moral quality is either an effect of the\nimpact of the opposite quality (or a change in the degree of intensity\nof the same quality), or else the result of human external acts. For\nexample, frequent generous actions lead to an increase of generosity.\nPerforming morally good actions intensifies the virtues, whereas the\nconstant practice of evil diminishes them. Virtues and vices can be\ndescribed in terms of different degrees of intensity, so one can say\nthat a man can be more or less generous during his lifetime. And just\nlike physical qualities, Kilvington states that the intensity of a\nmoral quality has only an extrinsic limit, so that one cannot perfect\none\u2019s virtue infinitely.\n\nVirtues and vices have an absolute or relative character, and can be\npossessed absolutely (simpliciter) or in a certain respect\n(secundum quid). There are highest\u2014i.e., most\nperfect\u2014degrees of intensity of our moral virtues, but there are\nno absolutely greatest degrees, like Platonic ideas. In\nKilvington\u2019s opinion, people are never absolutely generous or\nvirtuous. The ultimate perfection, i.e., the highest degree of moral\nvirtue, is the product of a person\u2019s natural dispositions,\nsocializations, and moral acts. But since people relevantly differ,\neach of us is virtuous in our own way. So too, the highest degree of\nmoral virtue is unique in each of us. In Kilvington\u2019s opinion,\nif someone is prudent in the highest degree, they must have all the\nother virtues in the highest degree as well (Micha\u0142owska 2011a:\n488\u201392).\n\nFor Kilvington, prudence is one of the primary virtues. It is a habit,\nwhich cooperates with right reason (recta ratio) in the\nprocess of making good or bad decisions. Even though Ockham is not\nmentioned by name, his theory of the relation between prudence and\nmoral knowledge is present in Kilvington\u2019s discussion. Ockham\ndistinguishes two types of moral knowledge. The first, which concerns\nuniversal truths, is gained through learning; the second, which\nconcerns particular statements and particular situations, is gained\nthrough experience. Prudence is understood in two ways: as knowledge\nabout singular propositions and as universal practical knowledge. In\nhis opinion, both types of prudence are gained only through\nexperience, the former concerning singular statements and the latter\nuniversal practical statements. The former is properly called\nprudence, whereas the latter is commonly known as prudence. In\nOckham\u2019s view, the first kind of knowledge\u2014i.e., of\nuniversal truths\u2014must be distinguished from prudence concerning\nsingular statements. The second type of knowledge, however, is the\nsame as prudence, since it is also gained through experience\n(Quaestiones q.6, a.10). Kilvington identifies two kinds of\nmoral knowledge. The first is called scientia necessaria,\nwhich is composed of general statements and refers to universal truth.\nThe other is called scientia ad utrumlibet, which comprises\nparticular statements. The scientia necessaria, achieved by\nmeans of deduction, is not sufficient to make good moral decisions and\nso it must be complemented by a reference to scientia ad\nutrumlibet, achieved by experience (see Micha\u0142owska 2016:\n13). Gaining knowledge through experience is an indispensable part\nbecoming prudent. Kilvington states that someone can err with regard\nto a moral choice even though they possess certain and complete\nknowledge about universal moral truths; a skilled logician is not\nnecessarily a moral person. To make good moral decisions, one needs a\nfully-developed prudence, which is the same as scientia ad\nutrumlibet. Kilvington claims that someone who possesses moral\nknowledge is not automatically prudent, but a prudent person is always\nwise (see Micha\u0142owska & Jung 2010: 109\u2013111).\n\nGood choices are possible only when the will is supported by prudence.\nThe problem of free will and free choice is fully elaborated in\nKilvington\u2019s Ethics, where he presents his\ntheory\u2014what Micha\u0142owska calls a \u201cdynamic\nvoluntarism\u201d. Kilvington distinguishes three types of human\nvolitional acts: willing, nilling, and not-willing. Willing always\nwills, and can never be passive or in potency. Even when the will\nwants nothing (velle nihil), it is willing, and so it cannot\nrest and is always determined to an act of willing. Here Kilvington\nseems to be directly influenced by Scotus, who claims that the will\ncannot be suspended (Ord. I d.1). The will is absolutely free\nin its acts of willing, and the free will of volition is the primary\nprinciple in the genus of contingent propositions. Since the will is\nactive all the time, it must decide between its three acts of volition\n(velle volitionem), nolition (velle nolitionem), or\nnot-willing (non-velle). With regard to its own internal\nacts, the will is absolutely free. With regard to its external acts,\nhowever, it chooses between wanting something (velle aliquid)\nand not wanting something (nolle aliquid). In these cases,\nthe will is also absolutely free to make such a choice.\n\nFor Kilvington it is obvious that prudence plays an essential role in\nproducing good moral acts. When the habit of prudence is not fully\ndeveloped, the will is indecisive. Repeated good moral decisions makes\nit hesitate (non-velle) less, so that the agent is able to\nreach a decision in any context, whether affirmatively velle\nor negatively nolle. Supported by fully developed prudence,\nthe will makes proper and good moral choices more easily or even\neffortlessly (see Micha\u0142owska 2016: 14). Kilvington, however, is\nof the opinion that most of us rarely make good moral decisions\nbecause we often remain in doubt, stuck in the state of\nnon-velle.\n",
