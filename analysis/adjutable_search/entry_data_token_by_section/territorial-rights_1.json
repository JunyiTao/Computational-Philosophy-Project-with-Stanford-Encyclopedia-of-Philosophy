    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Territorial rights\n1.2 Territorial rights\n\nThe political philosophy literature on territory makes use of the idea\nof territorial rights. This is often done in a way that is analogous\nto how we think about property rights\u2014viz., as a bundle of\ndifferent liberties, powers, immunities, and claims, which, when held\ntogether with respect to a material thing, constitutes what we mean by\nproperty rights. In the case of property, the fullest form of\nnormative control over that thing was what Honor\u00e9 (1961) called\n\u2018full liberal ownership\u2019, but he also recognized that\nproperty rights can be parcelled out and held by different agents and\nthat each right within the bundle may have its own, separate\njustification.\n\nIn the case of territorial rights, the central and fundamental right\nis the right of jurisdiction, which is the right to create and enforce\nlaws within the domain in question. However, there are other related\nrights (powers, immunities) related to jurisdiction, which we also\nlump together as part of \u2018territorial right\u2019. It includes\nthe power to make changes to the territory\u2019s status, for example\nby incorporating it into some larger entity such as the EU, and the\npower to create sub-jurisdictional units of a federal system. It\nincludes the right to do business in the world as a legal\nentity\u2014to make war and peace, to conclude treaties, and enter\ninto alliances. And it includes rights against other similar entities\nnot to be interfered with in the exercise of this power.\n\nTerritorial rights are also normally understood to include other\nrights beyond jurisdiction and the associated claims, powers and\nimmunities: rights to control resources within the geographical area,\nrights to control borders and regulate the flow of people and goods\nacross them and rights to defend the territory against outside\naggression (Simmons 2001; Miller 2012). Although these are often\nassumed to be inherent in the very idea of a sovereign state, we can\nenvisage entities that have some rights of jurisdiction but lack other\nelements in the territorial bundle. Consider the members of the\nEuropean Union which have significant jurisdictional powers at the\nmember state level, but no border checks between member states in the\nSchengen area. Most federations are structured in this way. In Canada,\nprovinces exercise wide powers of jurisdiction (over education,\nhealth, roads, natural resources) but there are no border controls\nbetween provinces. Thus, each element in the bundle that make up what\nwe might loosely call \u2018territorial rights\u2019 needs to be\nexamined, related to other elements, and justified, if we are to have\na full normative theory of territorial rights or territorial\njustice.\n\nThe structural similarities between property rights and territorial\nrights should not blind us to their differences. Territory is not the\nsame as property, because it has, as its primary element, a right of\njurisdiction. Some of the rights that are included in rights over\nterritory look as though they\u2019re concerned with the claims to\nregulate and control a particular territory, which we think of as\nprimarily rights of jurisdiction; and other rights are much more\nproperty-like, because they involve exclusionary claims over a region,\nand claims about how to use resources and land located within the\nboundaries of the state. However, these rights are mainly conceived of\nas secondary to that of jurisdiction, and of meta-jurisdictional\npowers such as the power to secede from a state or merge with another\none.\n\nOne of the fundamental divisions in theories of territorial justice\nconcerns the question of the relationship between territory and\nproperty, with theorists of a more Lockean or libertarian bent arguing\nthat there are natural rights to property, which can give rise to\nrights over territory. On this story, property-holders consent to\ncreate a state and bring their property with them. Other theorists,\nincluding justice theorists, self-determination theorists and liberal\nnationalists, view rights of jurisdiction as both prior and\nfundamental, since it is through the exercise of jurisdiction that the\nrules according to which people can acquire and transfer property are\ndetermined.\n",
