    "main_text": "A Brief History || Carnap\n2.3 Carnap\n\n\nChurch simply(!) formalized something of how intensions behaved,\nwithout saying what they were. Rudolf Carnap took things further with\nhis method of intension and extension, and provided a semantics in\nwhich quite specific model-theoretic entities are identified with\nintensions (Carnap 1947). Indeed, the goal was to supply intensions\nand extensions for every meaningful expression, and this was done in a\nway that has heavily influenced much subsequent work.\n\n\nAlthough Carnap attended courses of Frege, his main ideas are based on\nWittgenstein 1921. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein\nintroduced a precursor of possible world semantics. There are\nstates of affairs, which can be identified with the set of\nall their truths, \u201c(1.13) The facts in logical space are the\nworld.\u201d Presumably these facts are atomic, and can be varied\nindependently, \u201c(1.21) Each item can be the case or not the case\nwhile everything else remains the same.\u201d Thus there are many\npossible states of affairs, among them the actual one, the real\nworld. Objects, in some way, involve not only the actual state of\naffairs, but all possible ones, \u201c(2.0123) If I know an object I\nalso know all its possible occurrences in states of affairs. (Every\none of these possibilities must be part of the nature of the object.)\nA new possibility cannot be discovered later.\u201d It is from these\nideas that Carnap developed his treatment.\n\n\nCarnap begins with a fixed formal language whose details need not\nconcern us now. A class of atomic sentences in this language,\ncontaining exactly one of \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) for each\natomic sentence, is a state-description. In each\nstate-description the truth or falsity of every sentence of the\nlanguage is determined following the usual truth-functional\nrules\u2014quantifiers are treated substitutionally, and the language\nis assumed to have \u2018enough\u2019 constants. Thus truth is\nrelative to a state-description. Now Carnap introduces a stronger\nnotion than truth, L-truth, intended to be \u201can\nexplicatum for what philosophers call logical or necessary or analytic\ntruth.\u201d Initially he presents this somewhat informally, \u201ca\nsentence is \\(L\\)-true in a state description \\(S\\) if it is\ntrue in \\(S\\) in such a way that its truth can be established on\nthe basis of the semantical rules of the system \\(S\\) alone,\nwithout any reference to (extra-linguistic) facts.\u201d But this is\nquickly replaced by a more precise semantic version, \u201cA sentence is\n\\(L\\)-true if it holds in every state-description.\u201d\n\n\nOne can recognize in \\(L\\)-truth a version of necessary truth\nusing possible world semantics. There is no accessibility relation, so\nwhat is being captured is more like S5 than like other modal\nlogics. But it is not S5 semantics either, since there is a fixed set\nof state-descriptions determined by the language itself. (If\n\\(P\\) is any propositional atom, some state-description\nwill contain \\(P\\), and so \\(\\Diamond P\\) will\nbe validated.) Nonetheless, it is a clear anticipation of possible\nworld semantics. But what concerns us here is how Carnap treats\ndesignating terms in such a setting. Consider predicates\n\\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). For Carnap these are intensionally\nequivalent if \\(\\forall x(Px \\equiv Qx)\\) is an \\(L\\)-truth, that is, in each\nstate-description \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have the same\nextension. Without being quite explicit about it, Carnap is proposing\nthat the intension of a predicate is an assignment of an extension for\nit to each state-description\u2014intensional identity means identity\nof extension across all state-descriptions and not just at the actual\none. Thus the predicate \u2018\\(H\\)\u2019, human, and the\npredicate \u2018\\(FB\\)\u2019, featherless biped, have the same\nextension\u2014in the actual state-description they apply to the same\nbeings\u2014but they do not have the same intension since there are\nother state-descriptions in which their extensions can differ. In a\nsimilar way one can model individual expressions, \u201cThe extension\nof an individual expression is the individual to which it\nrefers.\u201d Thus, \u2018Scott\u2019 and \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 have the same extension (in the actual\nstate-description). Carnap proposes calling the intension of an\nindividual expression an individual concept, and\nsuch a thing picks out, in each state-description, the individual to\nwhich it refers in that state description. Then \u2018Scott\u2019\nand \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 have different intensions\nbecause, as most of us would happily say, they could have been\ndifferent, that is, there are state-descriptions in which they are\ndifferent. (I am ignoring the problems of non-designation in this\nexample.)\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s fundamental idea is that intensions, for whatever entities\nare being considered, can be given a precise mathematical embodiment\nas functions on states, while extensions are relative to a single\nstate. This has been further developed by subsequent researchers, of\ncourse with modern possible world semantics added to the mix. The\nCarnap approach is not the only one around, but it does take us quite\na bit of the way into the intensional thicket. Even though it does\nnot get us all the way through, it will be the primary version\nconsidered here, since it is concrete, intuitive, and natural when it\nworks.\n",
