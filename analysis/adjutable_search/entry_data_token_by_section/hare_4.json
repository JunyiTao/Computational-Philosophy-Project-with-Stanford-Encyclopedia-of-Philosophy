    "main_text": "Attending to Preferences\n5. Attending to Preferences\n\n\nA related query (which Moral Thinking leaves as\n\u201cunfinished business\u201d; 1981: 105, cf. 1997) arises about\nthe range of preferences that prescribing universally commits one to\ntaking on board. If \u201cI\u201d is fully prescriptive, it may\nfurther follow that to suppose that I am some person is to take on\nboard all his preferences, including \u201cexternal\u201d\nones about matters (say his neighbors\u2019 sexual or dietary\npractices) that may never impinge upon his consciousness. Yet\nsometimes Hare only demands impartiality between interests, which is\nnarrower. To accommodate precisely that, we might distinguish a\nsympathetic \u201cI\u201d: to suppose that I am some person might be\nto give full weight to his preferences regarding his own\nexperiences. This would still leave open whether I should take into\naccount his prudential preferences (now-for-then) for his future, or\nonly his synchronic preferences (now-for-now) regarding his present\nstate. Alternatively, we might admit an egocentric \u201cI\u201d:\nthis would let us give weight to Cheops\u2019 desire that he\nreceive a big funeral after his death, but not to external desires\nthat do not essentially refer to their possessor. Yet such options\nembarrass if the aim was to derive a precise ethical theory from the\nvery logic of the concepts.\n\n\nAs Hare notes (1981: 103), restrictions upon the relevant range of\npreferences may have the effect of bringing together a utilitarianism\nthat aims to maximize pleasure or happiness, and one that aims to\nmaximize the satisfaction of preference. Yet to have any hope of\nachieving this we would need a double restriction: the only\npreferences to be considered must be now-for-now or then-for-then, and\nthey must be fully internal in relating only to conscious states of\nthe subject\u2014indeed, more precisely, to features of those states\nof which the agent is conscious, or, for short, what it is\nlike to be in those states. However, this position is doubly\ninsecure. First, when discussing the treatment of now-for-then\npreferences, Hare takes over from Richard Brandt the idea that\nrational agents seek to maximize the satisfaction of their present\npreferences after they have been adjusted in the light of full\nexposure to logic and the facts (1981: 101\u20135,\n214\u201316). This makes the practical question for the agent not\n\u201cWhat do I now prefer?\u201d, but \u201cWhat would I prefer\nafter full exposure to logic and the facts?\u201d The same issue\narises even with now-for-now preferences. Hare discusses, though in a\ndifferent context (1981: 142\u20134), the pleasure machine imagined\nby J.J.C. Smart (Smart & Williams 1983: 18) that maximizes the\npleasures of a subject through generating a stream of illusory but\nenjoyable experiences. He sees it as an advantage of his variety of\nutilitarianism that, not being \u201cformulated in terms of\npleasure\u201d, it can give weight to whether\n\u201cwe prefer a life for ourselves plugged into the\nmachines to one devoted to pursuits now considered normal and\nenjoyable\u201d (1981: 143). That suggests that we should give weight\nto now-for-now preferences whose objects are not restricted\nto conscious features of current mental states. Further, if we follow\nBrandt, we should ask not what now-for-now preferences an\nagent actually has, but which he would have after\nsubjection to Brandt\u2019s \u201ccognitive psycho-therapy\u201d. Yet\nthis implication may trouble us, not only because of the indefinite\nscope it offers to paternalism, but because it would seem\nundeterminable what an agent would want if indefinitely\ninformed.\n\n\nThe other source of insecurity is doubts about whether, within Hare\u2019s\nframework, we are justified in restricting the relevant range of\npreferences. If, in deciding what ought to be done, I am rationally\nbound to identify with the agents whose preferences, internal or\nexternal, bear on it, how can I fail to take on the widest range of\nactual preferences, now-for-then as well as now-for-now and\nthen-for-then, external as well as internal, and uninformed as well as\ninformed? Hare inclines this way, writing \u201cIt is still my belief\nthat a full account of the matter would assign weight to all\npreferences\u201d (1981: 103\u20134). However, how might this best\nbe done? Let us take them in turn.\n\nNow-for-then preferences.  Hare is clear that we take\ninto account how much an agent prefers one thing to another,\nalso to how many agents prefer it. This suggests that we\nshould also attend to how long an agent has a preference; for\nit would seem arbitrary to count a preference twice if two men have\nit, if only for a day, but only once if one man has it for two\ndays. We might assimilate the questions how long and how\nmany by dividing people into time-slices within which their\nrelevant preferences are stable, and asking how many\nperson-slices shared some given preference. Yet the effect is\ncurious. Within the life of an individual, a preference may become\noverriding because he has entertained it for a long time, even if it\nhas been replaced by conflicting preferences at the time of\naction. (And the theory would not allow one to give precedence to the\npreferences of the person-slice who acts on the grounds of agential\nautonomy; for agents enjoy no such privilege.)\nExternal preferences. One difficulty here is in assessing\nthe intensity of an external preference that is idle, but perhaps\nbecause the agent can do nothing towards satisfying it.  Apparent\nintensity may be deceptive: it is the mark of a sentimental attitude\nthat it may be warmly felt, and yet at the same time inactive and\ninsincere. However, the same problem arises elsewhere; it is not\npeculiar to external preferences.\nUninformed preferences. It is hard to see how Hare\u2019s\nframework itself justifies disregarding these. However, subjects may\nhave a higher-level preference that, where they hold or lack a\nlower-level preference only out of ignorance, its presence or absence\nshould be discounted\u2014thought perhaps only so long as this does\nnot give rise to a denial of autonomy within spheres where each of us\nexpects to be free to act at will according to his own judgment.\n\n\n\nThere is further unclarity in the notion of a preference.\nHare had long distinguished being in pain, to which one may\nbe indifferent (if the pain is slight, or if one has undergone\nprefrontal lobotomy), and suffering, which entails having a\ndesire (not necessarily overriding) to escape it. Now it is plausible\nto suppose that, of any variety of suffering, there is such a thing\nas what it is like to be subject to it. (So Hare can write of\na group of sufferers, \u201cI shall not know what it will be like for\nthem \u2026 unless I know what it is like to suffer like\nthat\u201d; 1981: 92.) This applies so long as the desire that is an\naspect of suffering is of a kind that is bound to be felt.\nYet we all are subject to an indefinite range of desires that are\ndispositional; and even occurrent desires may be manifest in how we\nthink or act without being felt. Hare appears to overlook such\nvariations when he writes of preferences in general, \u201cIf I do\nnot feel the preference with the intensity which the person in the\nsituation feels it, I have not fully represented his situation to\nmyself\u201d (Seanor & Fotion 1988: 288). And yet, when he\nconsiders failures to act as one prescribes (e.g., 1981: 21\u20132),\nhe shows an awareness that how one chooses and acts can be equally\nindicative as anything one feels of what one prefers. No doubt this\ncould be sorted out, and precisely by recognizing (as Hare doubtless\ncould have, though the language is not his) that the criteria\nof preference are multiple. However, this would have for him two\ndrawbacks. First, it multiplies the possible ways in which one might\ncount as \u201cidentifying with\u201d another. Hare has written,\n\u201cIn identifying myself with some person either actually or\nhypothetically, I identify with his prescriptions\u201d (1981:\n96\u20137). Yet another way might be imagining what it is like to be\nhim at some time or in some situation\u2014which is different, though\nit may (to the extent that his preferences come to his mind as objects\nof attention) be overlapping.  Secondly, it confirms a doubt that one\nis likely to have anyway about the comparability of preferences. If I\nfeel like doing something but, for no compelling reason, fail to do\nit, whereas you do it without any prior or accompanying consciousness\nof the preference, who has the stronger preference to do it? The\nquestion is liable to be unanswerable.\n",
