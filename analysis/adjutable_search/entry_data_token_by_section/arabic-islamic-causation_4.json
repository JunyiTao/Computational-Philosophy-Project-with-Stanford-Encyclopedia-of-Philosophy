    "main_text": "Aristotelian causality || Final causality\n2.3 Final causality\n\nIn Physics 2.3, Aristotle says that \u201cthe end or\nthat for the sake of which the thing is done\u201d is also considered\na type of cause. In Arabic philosophical works, the terms \u201cfinal\ncause\u201d (al-\u02bfillah al-gh\u0101\u02beiyyah) and\n\u201cend\u201d (al-gh\u0101yah) designate this type of\ncause. The philosophers hold both natural motion and divine\naction to occur for the sake of an end, though they consider the\nlatter to differ from the former in an important way. Natural bodies\nare said to act for the sake of something distinct from themselves,\nwhich they lack. For example, an animal builds for the sake of\nshelter. By contrast, God\u2019s end is not distinct from God itself,\nrather God acts for the sake of itself. This idea is implicit in\nal-Kind\u012b\u2019s account of the final cause in The\nExplanation of the Proximate Efficient Cause for Generation and\nCorruption, which states that the end is either something\nexternal to the efficient cause, which compels it to act, or it is not\nsomething external to the efficient cause; in the latter case, the\nefficient cause acts \u201conly because of itself\u201d (McGinnis\nand Reisman 2007: 4). Presumably, the latter case describes divine\naction. Avicenna attempts to explain the idea that God cannot act for\nthe sake of something distinct from itself as follows. He argues that\nan agent\u2019s desire for an end distinct from itself implies the\nagent\u2019s imperfection, since the object of the agent\u2019s\ndesire must be superior to the agent. In support of the latter claim,\nhe reasons that the object of an agent\u2019s desire must be\nsomething that perfects or benefits the agent (Avicenna MH: 321). So,\nan absolutely perfect agent as is God cannot act from desire for an\nend distinct from itself. Avicenna also argues that an agent\u2019s\nintending something distinct from itself implies the agent\u2019s\nmultiplicity, since it involves multiple acts of knowledge, e.g.,\nknowledge of the intention, of the reason for the intention and of the\nbenefit to the agent to be derived from the intention (Avicenna MH:\n326; McGinnis 2010: 206\u2013208). So, an absolutely simple agent as\nis God cannot act by intending for the sake of something other than\nitself.\n\nArabic philosophical discussions of final causality also aim to meet\nvarious objections to Aristotelian teleology. Avicenna takes up this\nchallenge with great energy. Again, the most developed arguments are\nfound in the Physics and Metaphysics of the Book\nof Healing. In Physics I 13\u201314, Avicenna attempts\nto meet to objections derived from Aristotle\u2019s discussion of\nAncient materialists, such as Democritus and Empedocles. In\nMetaphysics VI 5, he treats additional objections. Perhaps\nthese are of greatest interest.\n\nOne objection asserts as obvious that certain human actions are\ntrivial or purposeless (\u02bfabath); the example given is\nplaying with one\u2019s beard (Avicenna MH: 220\u2013225). This\nobjection challenges the idea that every natural motion has an end or\ngoal. The objection is probably derived from Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho claims in On Fate that twiddling with toothpicks and\ntouching and pulling one\u2019s hair do not have a cause in the sense\nof an end (Sharples 1983: 44). Against this objection, Avicenna\nmaintains that apparently trivial human actions are motivated by\nunconscious desire for pleasure, the good of the animal soul\n(Richardson 2015). This argument derives support from Avicenna\u2019s\noriginal and influential account of the internal senses, which\nexplains the cognitive bases of such actions (Avicenna ASAN:\n43\u201345, 58\u201361, 163\u201369; Black 2000, 2013a).\n\nAvicenna also devotes considerable attention to this objection:\n\u201cWhy is the end considered a prior cause when in fact it is an\neffect of the other causes?\u201d(Avicenna MH: 220, trans. modified).\nThis objection asserts that it is inappropriate to include the end\namong the types of causes on the ground that causes are ontologically\nprior to effects. Avicenna\u2019s reply involves a distinction\nbetween (i) the \u201cthingness\u201d (shay\u02beiyyah) or\nessence (m\u0101hiyyah) of the end and (ii) the existence of\nthe end: while the existence of the end in concrete particulars is\nposterior to and, thus, an effect of the other causes, the thingness\n(or essence) of the end exists prior to action and causes the\ncausality of the other causes (Avicenna MH: 228; Wisnovsky 2000,\n2003a). He also makes a further point, which is historically\nsignificant: the thingness (or essence) of the end \u201cis not a\ncause unless it occurs as an image in the soul, or as something\nanalogous to that\u201d (Avicenna MH: 228, trans. modified).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the priority of the final cause was\ninfluential in the Latin West, where it was taken by some to support\nthe view that the scope of final causation be restricted to agents\nwith cognitive powers (Maier 1955). This interpretation also appears\nin the Arabic tradition. Roughly speaking, Avicenna was taken to have\nshown that (i) the claim that the end is a cause of motion depends on\nthe claim that it is prior to and a cause of the causality of the\nother causes and (ii) the claim that the end is prior to and a cause\nof the causality of the other causes is true only in cases where it\nexists in the mind or soul of the efficient cause.\n\nWith respect to this interpretation of Avicenna, it is important to\nemphasize that, in his account of the priority of the final cause, he\nmentions that the thingness (or essence) of the end may exist prior to\nmotion as an image in the soul \u201cor as something analogous to\nthat\u201d (Avicenna MH: 228, trans. modified). In this passage, he\nsuggests that the thingness or essence of the end may exist prior to\nmotion either as an object of cognition, or in another way, which is\ndifferent from, but analogous to, existing as an object of cognition.\nFurthermore, Avicenna\u2019s various discussions of the final cause\ngive every indication that he considers the motion of natural bodies\nwithout cognitive powers to occur for the sake of an end, which is\nprior to and a cause of that motion. Still, it seems especially\ndifficult to prove that that the end of natural motion is prior to and\na cause of that motion.\n\nThis issue was widely discussed by Arabic philosophers and\ntheologians. In his commentary on Avicenna\u2019s Pointers and\nReminders, al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b attempts to resolve this\nproblem by suggesting that we can attribute a sort of prior awareness\n(shu\u02bf\u016br) to the nature of a body (Avicenna and\n\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b PR: part IV, 7, 18). \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b makes\nthese remarks in reply to Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s\ncomplaint that Avicenna\u2019s conception of the final cause applies\nonly to cognitive agents. By contrast, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b maintains\nthat the inanimate is called \u201ca seeker and a willer\u201d only\nfiguratively:\n\n\nFor it is said the stone falls because it wills [to move to] the\ncenter and seeks it, when seeking and willing in reality are only\nconceivable in conjunction with the knowledge (al-\u02bfilm)\nof what is willed and sought after and are [thus] conceivable only of\nanimals. (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 57)\n\n\nAvicenna may be able to meet this objection by appeal to his account\nof natural inclination (Richardson 2015).\n",
