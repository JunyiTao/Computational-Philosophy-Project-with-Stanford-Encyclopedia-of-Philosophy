    "main_text": "A Word on Method: Moving Beyond Aristotle, Augustine, and Kabbalah || Kabbalistic Lenses in the Study of Ibn Gabirol\n2.3 Kabbalistic Lenses in the Study of Ibn Gabirol\n\n\nIn his elaboration on the metaphysics of matter, Ibn Gabirol\nfrequently uses the Arabic term \u201cal-\u2018unsur\u201d\n(instead of the more common Arabic terms\n\u201cal-hay\u00fbl\u00e2\u201d and\n\u201cal-madda\u201d) for matter. In fact, as outlined in\nsection 1, this is one of the key pieces of evidence for identifying a\nuniquely \u201cEmpedoclean\u201d strain in his thinking. That said,\nmany readers instead simplistically fall into a Kabbalistic reading of\nIbn Gabirol since the Arabic \u201cal-\u2018unsur\u201d is\ncorrelated to the Hebrew term \u201cyes\u00f4d\u201d both\nin Ibn Gabirol's own Hebrew poetry as well as in\nFalaquera's 13th century Hebrew translation of the\nFons Vitae. While to be sure, the Hebrew term\n\u201cyes\u00f4d\u201d (literally \u201cfoundation\u201d)\nis a cornerstone term and concept in Jewish mysticism, the desire to\nread Ibn Gabirol Kabbalistically (as a proto-Zoharian) is simply\nunder-supported by the mere fact that he (and his Hebrew translator)\nuse the term \u201cyes\u00f4d\u201d. While there might be\nKabbalistic traces in Ibn Gabirol, it is methodologically inadvisable\u2014and \ndistorting\u2014to simply start out assuming there are.\nWe might note, for example, F. E. Peters' boldly claiming\u2014with\nno stated evidence\u2014in his \u201cAvicebron\u201d entry in\nthe New Catholic Encyclopedia: \u201cThe true philosophical home of\nAvicebron is in the Zohar and in the speculative sections of the\nCabala\u201d (see Peters 1967, volume 1, p. 1130). Such a claim is not\nprima facie evident. In an obviously more methodologically careful\nspirit, there are scholars of Jewish mysticism who recommend\nconnections to Ibn Gabirol (usually with reference to Ibn\nGabirol's poems, not his Fons Vitae) (see, for example,\nIdel, who offers the suggestion of mystical overtones in an Ibn Gabirol\npoetic reference to \u201cten sefir\u00f4t\u201d (Idel\n1982, p. 278); see too: Idel 1992; Liebes 1987; Heller-Wilensky 1967).\nWhile we needn't dismiss the idea of links between Ibn Gabirol\nand Jewish mysticism (he was most likely familiar with the\nS\u00eafer Yetz\u00eerah tradition, and possibly other\ntraditions, of sef\u00eer\u00f4t), we must be\nmethodologically cautious to not over-Kabbalize Ibn Gabirol (and\nespecially his Fons Vitae): use of terms like\n\u201csef\u00eer\u00f4t,\u201d\n\u201cyes\u00f4d,\u201d et al. do not necessarily reveal\nJewish mystical overtones or influence. Scholem reminds us (in his\nstudy of Ibn Gabirol's influence on Kabbalah) that even after\nmany studies of the link between Ibn Gabirol and the Kabbalah, we have\nno clear conclusions (Scholem 1939, p. 160). (Avoiding reading Ibn\nGabirol as a proto-Zoharist is not to deny any impact of Ibn Gabirol on\nlater Kabbalists; but even this question of forward-influence must be\ntreated with care; as Scholem also notes, the mere use of the term\n\u201cDivine Will\u201d in Kabbalistic thinkers after Ibn\nGabirol does not necessarily reveal a Gabirolean influence (Scholem\n1939, p. 161)).\n\n\nSince we have strong reason to claim that Ibn Gabirol's use of\nthe term \u201cyes\u00f4d\u201d reflects a Ps. Empedoclean\ntradition, it is methodologically strained to read Ibn Gabirol from a\nKabbalistic vantage point. A Kabbalistic lens does not open us to\nunderstanding the metaphysical picture that Ibn Gabirol is trying to\npaint for us.\n",
