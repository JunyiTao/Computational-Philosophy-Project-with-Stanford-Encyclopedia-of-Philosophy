    "main_text": "Concepts and conceptual analysis\n5. Concepts and conceptual analysis\n\nSome of the deepest divides in contemporary philosophy concern the\nlimits of empirical inquiry, the status of conceptual analysis, and\nthe nature of philosophy itself (see, e.g., Chalmers 1996, Jackson\n1998, DePaul & Ramsey 1998, Block & Stalnaker 1999, Williamson\n2007, Stich 2012, Machery 2017, Strevens 2018). And concepts are right\nat the center of these disputes. For many, philosophy is essentially\nthe a priori analysis of concepts, which can and should be done\nwithout leaving the proverbial armchair. We\u2019ve already seen that\nin the paradigm case, an analysis embodies a definition; it specifies\na set of conditions that are individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient for the application of the concept. For proponents of\ntraditional conceptual analysis, the analysis of a concept is\nsuccessful to the extent that the proposed definition matches\npeople\u2019s intuitions about particular cases, including\nhypothetical cases that figure in crucial thought experiments.\n",
