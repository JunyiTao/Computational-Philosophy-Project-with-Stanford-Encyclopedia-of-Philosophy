    "main_text": "Explanatory Sentimentalism || Sympathy/Empathy-Based Theories\n2.2 Sympathy/Empathy-Based Theories\n\nWhat is distinctive of David Hume and Adam Smith is that although they\noccasionally use the term \u2018moral sense\u2019, they do not take\nit to be a primitive, innate capacity, but rather aim to explain its\nworkings in terms of more basic mechanisms, in particular what they\ncall \u2018sympathy\u2019. In contemporary use, the term is often\nused for a kind of concern for another. But Hume, Smith, and Sophie de\nGrouchy (1798), in different ways, used it for sharing what another\nfeels. The contemporary term for this kind of mechanism is\nempathy (for the distinction between sympathy and empathy,\nsee Darwall 1998; Sober and Wilson 1998; Fleischacker 2019). This\nsection will nevertheless use the older term, since what the classical\nsentimentalists talk about isn\u2019t always quite\n\u2018empathy\u2019 either.\n\nFollowing Hutcheson, Hume rejects reason or reasoning as the source of\nmoral distinctions (judgments or facts). Briefly, he believes that\nreason alone cannot motivate us in the way that morality does\n(motivation scepticism), and that reasoning alone cannot tell\nus what\u2019s right or wrong (content scepticism). For\ndiscussion, see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments.\n\nOn Hume\u2019s positive account, moral approval is caused, if not\nconstituted, by pleasure of a special kind, or a form of love towards\nthe agent when considering their character impartially:\n\n\n\u2019Tis only when a character is considered in general, without\nreference to our particular interest, that it causes such a feeling or\nsentiment, as denominates it morally good or evil. (T 472)\n\n\nBut why does contemplation of a character without reference to our own\ninterest give us pleasure in the first place? Not because we\u2019re\nsimply equipped with an innate moral sense, but because of the\noperation of sympathy, which offers a more parsimonious and systematic\nexplanation of the phenomena. For Hume, its mechanism is a kind of\nanalogical association from the effects of a passion to their cause or\nvice versa, which generates the same passion in the observer (T 576).\nGrouchy observed that the importance of memory in this process has\npolitical implications: the privileged who skip the \u201cschool of\npain and adversity\u201d will be lacking in compassion (1798: 62). On\nHume\u2019s account, once the pleasures and pains of others are\ncommunicated to us, we are ourselves pleased in a special way when\ncontemplating those durable character traits that reliably please\nothers. This special kind of pleasure \u2018denominates\u2019 the\ntrait as virtuous or vicious:\n\n\nWhen any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind,\nwe are pleased with it, and approve of it; because it presents the\nlively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is\nitself a kind of pleasure. (T 580)\n\n\nHume notes two ways in which our moral approval diverges from what\ncauses sympathetic pleasure, however. First, what comes naturally to\nus is taking on the feelings of the near and the dear, those who are\nclose to or similar to us and those we care about. (This observation\nof bias inherent in empathy has recently been rediscovered by Prinz\n2011 and Bloom 2017.) Yet we can also approve of the virtues of\ndistant strangers, even enemies. Second, we sometimes approve of\n\u201cvirtue in rags\u201d: an honest and generous person, who is\n(say) imprisoned and thus in no position to benefit others, is not\nconsidered morally worse than someone with the same traits who\nactually does please those around her.\n\nHume\u2019s answer to these challenges is that we correct\nour initial responses for bias and the influence of moral luck, as\nwell as our present disposition \u2013 not because we aim for some\nstandard that is independent of our responses, but because of\n\u201cmany contradictions to our sentiments in society and\nconversation\u201d (T 583) that result from relying on\n\u201cmomentary appearances\u201d (T 582). After all, when someone\nuses moral language and calls someone \u201cvicious\u201d,\n\u201codious\u201d, or \u201cdepraved\u201d, she \u201cexpresses\nsentiments, in which, he expects, all his audience are to concur with\nhim\u201d (Hume 1751: 75). It is this expectation of concurrence\ncharacteristic of moral sentiments that pushes us towards a\n\u201ccommon point of view\u201d (ibid.) in moral judging, a point\nof view that abstracts from our particular interests, current\ndisposition, and relation to the agent, and focuses on the effects of\nthe person\u2019s character traits on people around them (T\n602\u20133) (see Sayre-McCord 1994).\n\nAdam Smith presents a different theory about the nature and mechanisms\nof sympathy and consequently moral and evaluative approval. For Smith,\nthe key mechanism of sympathy is imaginatively projecting oneself in\nanother\u2019s position, or what would now be called\nsimulation (Gordon 1995), rather than mere emotional\ncontagion, association, or inference. In Smith\u2019s official\ndefinition, sympathy consists in concord between what one takes the\nother to actually feel and what one feels oneself as a result of\nputting oneself in the other\u2019s shoes. Approbation is the\npleasant feeling that results from perceiving this rough coincidence\n(TMS 56 note a), perhaps because it simultaneously confirms our common\nhumanity and the distinctness of our perspectives (Fleischacker 2019,\n28\u201331). Although this account of \u2018sense of\npropriety\u2019 is sometimes described as Smith\u2019s theory of\nmoral judgment, he regards it as a perfectly general account of\nevaluation, encompassing belief, sense of humour, or business\ndecisions. When it comes to judgments of moral merit or demerit, or\nthe qualities of deserving praise or blame, what counts is our\nsympathy with the gratitude and resentment of those\naffected by the action, on the one hand, and with the agent\u2019s\nmotives, on the other. Like Hume, Smith recognizes that moral approval\nrequires departing from one\u2019s personal point of view:\n\n\nBut [resentment and gratitude], as well as all the other passions of\nhuman nature, seem proper and are approved of, when the heart of every\nimpartial spectator entirely sympathizes with them, when every\nindifferent by-stander entirely enters into, and goes along with them.\n(TMS 81)\n\n\nThe figure of an impartial spectator also plays a key role in\nSmith\u2019s account of self-directed moral judgment or conscience.\nBecause we want others to sympathize with us (and thus approve of us),\nwe strive to bring our passions to a level that an imagined informed\nand impartial spectator could sympathize with (Kopajtic 2020). Antti\nKauppinen (2010: 236\u2013239; 2014a) argues that this can be seen in\ncontemporary psychological terms as a form of emotion regulation by\nmeans of refocusing attention and reappraising the meaning of the\naction.\n\nMichael Slote\u2019s recent sentimentalist account picks up the\nthread of empathy/sympathy-based theories, along with\nHutcheson\u2019s emphasis on benevolence. Slote\u2019s claim is that\nmoral approval is constituted and explained by empathizing with an\nagent\u2019s motives:\n\n\n[I]f agents\u2019 actions reflect empathic concern for (the well\nbeing or wishes of) others, empathic beings will feel warmly or\ntenderly toward them, and such warmth and tenderness empathically\nreflect the empathic warmth or tenderness of the agents. \u2026\n[S]uch empathy with empathy \u2026 also constitutes moral approval,\nand possibly admiration as well, for agents and/or their actions.\n(Slote 2010: 34\u201335)\n\n\nSome people\u2019s actions exhibit empathy toward others. This\nempathy is a warm feeling. When we empathize with the agent, we come\nto share this warm feeling. And this empathic warm feeling constitutes\nmoral approval. In contrast, unempathetic actions manifest a coldness\ntowards others. Since moral approval and disapproval \u201center into\nthe making of moral judgments\u201d, Slote believes empathy can\nexplain our intuitions and judgments.\n\nSlote\u2019s account has been criticized from within the\nsentimentalist camp. Jesse Prinz (2011) notes that the view has\ndifficulty with disapproval: failure to empathize is not the same\nthing as disapprobation, nor does it have the same kind of\nmotivational effect. Julia Driver (2011) points out that people with\nempathy deficits can nevertheless morally approve or disapprove of\nthings. Slote\u2019s view also faces challenges of both necessity and\nsufficiency, in that it seems possible that we approve of un-empathic\nactions (such as doing something out of a sense of duty, or doing the\nright thing for the wrong reason), and that there are empathetic\nactions we don\u2019t approve of (such as empathy-motivated helping\nof one victim at the expense of many others who are less close or\nsimilar to the agent).\n\nEmpathic feelings may enter into the explanation of moral judgment\nmore indirectly, however. Shaun Nichols\u2019s (2004) version of\nsentimentalism shares the Humean ambition of explaining moral thought\nwithout assuming an innate moral capacity or sense. Instead, Nichols\nassumes that normal people have a generic capacity to be guided by\nnorms or rules of various kinds, and certain non-moral emotional\ndispositions, such as the disposition to have an aversive response to\nsuffering in others. His hypothesis is that we regard a rule-violation\nas moral (and thus wrong independently of what anyone tells us to do)\nrather than conventional (something that owes its status to being\nprohibited by some local de facto authority) when the rule in\nquestion is affect-backed, that is, when it prohibits actions\nof a type that we independently have a negative emotional reaction\ntowards (Nichols 2004: 62).\n\nOne important source of support for this claim is that people who lack\nthe relevant affective response, such as psychopaths, appear to fail\nat distinguishing between moral and conventional rules, even if their\nrational capacities are intact (cf. Aaltola 2014). At the same time,\nNichols holds that particular moral judgments can be simply\napplications of affect-backed rules, and don\u2019t require on-line\naffective response. This indirect explanatory sentimentalism was\nanticipated by some earlier sentimentalists. Adam Smith noted that we\nmake the \u201cgreater part of\u201d our moral judgments on the\nbasis of general rules, which are for him based on induction from\nemotional responses to particular cases (TMS 377). Similarly, Grouchy\nholds that reflection generates abstract and general moral sentiments,\nwhich we obey \u201cwithout thinking back to the way in which they\nwere first formed and all that justified them\u201d (1798: 112).\nEdward Westermarck held that many judgments are \u201capplications of\nsome accepted general rule\u201d, whose acceptance is ultimately\nexplained by the existence of an \u201cemotional sanction\u201d in\nthe judge\u2019s mind (Westermarck 1906: 6).\n\nNichols believes that his sentimental rules account also offers an\nexplanation of universality of certain norms. We do not have to assume\nthat people have an innate tendency to regard causing harm to\ninnocents as morally wrong. Instead, it is plausible that of the\nvarious norms that different societies have come up with, those that\nresonate with our non-moral emotional dispositions enjoy a higher\n\u2018cultural fitness\u2019 (Nichols 2004: 127) and thus become\nmore prevalent over time. Since we can account for (nearly)\npan-cultural moral rules as well as moral judgment without appeal to\ndedicated innate mechanisms, Nichols (2005) concludes that morality is\nan evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation.\n",
