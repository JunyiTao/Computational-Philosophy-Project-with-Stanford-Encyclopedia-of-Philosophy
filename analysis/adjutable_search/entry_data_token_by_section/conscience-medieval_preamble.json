    "main_text": "\n\nThe question of what role the human mind plays in moral\nbehaviour\u2014or the study of moral psychology\u2014has been a\nfruitful area of research in medieval philosophy since at least the\nearly to mid-1990s. Since then scholars have done much to illuminate\nmedieval contributions to such perennial topics as the freedom of the\nwill, the problem of moral weakness, and what role, if any, the\nemotions and the moral virtues play in the achievement of happiness\n(e.g., Kent 1995, Saarinen 1994, Dumont 2000, Eardley 2006, Hoffmann\n2007, and Osborne 2014). Similarly, metaethical theories about the\nfoundations of morality that were prominent during the medieval period\nsuch as natural law theory\u2014particularly in its Thomistic and\nScotistic variants\u2014continue to receive robust scholarly\nattention (e.g., Porter 2005, M\u00f6hle 2003, Lisska 2012, Sweeney\n2012, and Cross 2012). Comparatively less consideration, however, has\nbeen devoted to what was believed to link the psychological to the\nmetaethical: the mental habit or act of conscience (and its\nsister-concept of synderesis), though interest in the subject has\nrecently seen a modest resurgence (e.g., Hoffmann 2012, Eardley 2013,\nand Dougherty 2018).\n\nWhat is the scope and nature of this apparent ability to intuitively\ngrasp right from wrong? Can conscience err and, if so, do its dictates\nstill bind? The best way to address these and other questions is to\nemploy a developmental approach. The term conscience is still\ngenerally used to refer to an innate moral sense, but it has slightly\ndifferent connotations today than it did in the medieval period, which\nin turn had different connotations from what preceded it in pagan\nantiquity and in Scripture. Still, medieval theories of conscience\ndrew extensively on these earlier sources. Since the concepts of\nconscience and synderesis evolved over time, then, it will be\nnecessary to take a linear approach to the topic and begin with some\nbackground.\n",
