Hot out of the oven!\n\nTODD: What is that?\n\nLOVETT: It\u2019s priest. Have a little priest.\n\nTODD: Is it really good?\n\nLOVETT: Sir, it\u2019s too good, at least!\n\nThen again, they don\u2019t commit sins of the flesh,\n\nSo it\u2019s pretty fresh.\n\n\u2026\n\nTODD: Haven\u2019t you got poet, or something like that?\n\nLOVETT: No, y\u2019see, the trouble with poet is\n\n\u2019Ow do you know it\u2019s deceased?\n\nTry the priest!\n\n(Lyrics from Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet\nStreet)\n\n\nAs Pelletier has frequently noted (e.g. 1989, 2001, 2011, 2012a,\n2012b), even if one wants to ignore putative metaphysical distinctions\nfor distinguishing mass and count, instead maintaining that there are\nmerely syntactical, lexical, or semantical ones\u2014there remain\nsignificant problems for distinguishing mass vs. count. And if such\nfundamental linguistic problems are still outstanding, then the\nprospects of employing the +MASS/+COUNT\ndistinction as the basis for a strong metaphysical distinction are\n hazy.[23]\n Let\u2019s see why.\n\nEvery criterion put forth for distinguishing between\n+MASS and +COUNT faces\nsignificant\u2014and seemingly systematic\u2014counterexamples. We\nattempted to side-step such problems in\n Section 1\n by stipulating that there is a difference between\n\u2018nouns/terms/expressions used with a mass sense,\u2019 versus\n\u2018nouns/terms/expressions used with a count sense,\u2019 but\nforebore giving an account of what gives particular instances the\nsense they do have. (More detail on this can be found in the\n \u201cLogic of Mass Expressions\u201d\n entry). Then, using the rough-and-ready characterization of\n+COUNT versus +MASS (or things versus\nstuff) we, mirroring our authors, went on to exploit the distinction\nfor our ends of taxonomizing the world\u2019s inhabitants and\ndescribing their features.\n\nBut, this stipulation ignores the following kinds of problems. Suppose\nwe accept that syntactic criteria (as covered in\n Section 1)\n are doing the distinguishing. The problem with this is that every\nputatively +MASS/-COUNT noun admits of\n-MASS/+COUNT instances, and we cannot\ntell the difference based on syntax alone. But if this is so, then we\nwould need \u201csyntactic derivation rules to convert each noun from\none to the other category\u2014a terrible syntactic idea (or double\nentries for every lexical noun\u2014another terrible syntactic idea)\n\u2026 once [this is done] \u2026, then the\n+MASS/-COUNT features do no syntactic work: they never\nrule out any construction as ungrammatical on their own\u201d\n(Pelletier 2011, pp. 22\u201323).\n\nAny supposed count noun can have mass instances, and vice versa. For\nexample, employing something like the \u2018Universal Grinder\u2019\nidea of Pelletier (1979, pp. 5\u20136) we can imagine any putative\ncount-item C as being ground up so that there is \u2018C all over the\nfloor.\u2019 The quoted passage above from Sweeney Todd is\nan example of how count-terms for kinds of people are easily\ntransformed into mass terms to refer to the stuffs in (or kinds of)\nmeat-pies served to the unwittingly cannibalistic customers. The\nUniversal Grinder idea relies more on the ease with which we can\nswitch from +COUNT to +MASS than it does\non any actual grinding (cf. Chierchia 2010 and 2021, Rothstein 2010 p.\n390\u20134). We can refer to any individual (be it ground or whole)\nin a \u2018massy\u2019 way. Think of how Mark\u2019s spouse might\nthink, \u2018there\u2019s a lot more Mark now after the\nquarantine\u2019 if he gained a lot of weight. These instances of\n\u2018grinding\u2019, which may seem peculiar or violent, have been\nargued to be merely \u201crealizations of a regular polysemy\u201d\n(Kiss et al 2021b, 379).\n\nBunt (1985) discussed the reverse operation(s):\n(+MASS/-COUNT ->\n-MASS/+COUNT), which comes in two\nvarieties. The first is the \u2018Universal Sorter\u2019, which\nsorts into kinds, such as with \u2018Voodoo Brewery sells\nsix beers.\u2019 The second is the \u2018Universal Packager\u2019\n(Pelletier 1975), which puts masses into portions, as with\n\u2018we\u2019ll have six beers,\u2019 or \u2018there are four\nbutters in the package.\u2019 (Granted, there is a change in sense in\nthese cases, but, as addressed below, this doesn\u2019t undermine the\nnotion that these nouns are polysemous, and so also does not undermine\nthe point of interchangeability without a lexical switch). We can\nrefer to any stuff (be it packaged, atomistic, or neither) in a\nparticular way.\n\nHuddleston & Payne, in The Cambridge Grammar of the English\nLanguage (Huddleston & Pullum (eds.), 2002, pp. 334\u20135,\ncited in Pelletier 2011 and 2012), show convincingly that such\ntransformations are ubiquitous and do not at all support the notion\nthat [chocolate (+MASS/-COUNT)]\n(\u2018he had a lot of chocolate\u2019) is a different word\nthan [chocolate (-MASS/+COUNT)]\n(\u2018he had three chocolates\u2019). \u2018Chocolate\u2019 is\npolysemous, not homonymous. In addition to the lack of syntactic\nfeatures to distinguish between mass and count terms, there are no\ninherent lexical features either.\n\nSo if syntax or lexical meaning won\u2019t do it, maybe a semantic\ndistinction will do? Huddleston & Payne go on to distinguish\nbetween the heterogeneity of terms like\n\u2018crockery\u2019 and \u2018furniture\u2019, which are not\ndissective, versus terms like \u2018water,\u2019 which are (2002,\n336\u20137). (They call the former sort of mass terms\n\u2018aggregative\u2019). But if dissectivity is taken seriously as\na semantic requirement to be considered as mass, then it will end up\nthat an H2O molecule is not water, nor is an NaCl molecule\nsalt. (More on the non-atomic criteria is discussed in the Supplement\non\n Non-Atomicity and Its Relevance to the Mass/Count Distinction).\n As the authors point out (p338), when some material comes in small\nenough units, we often treat it as\n+MASS/-COUNT, such as dust,\nhair (e.g. when there\u2019s scattered piles of it on the\nfloor), change (i.e., coins)\u2013\u2013not because we\nthink the stuff is non-atomic, but because when the atoms are small\nenough it is more convenient or intuitive to think of it in a\n+MASS way. Dissectivity may do some work, but only to a\npoint, and so it\u2019s not really what is distinguishing mass from\ncount. And we cannot appeal to language-users\u2019 intentions in\nparticular instances to settle whether their use is mass or count\nbecause it may be \u201cthat in most instances speakers simply have\nno intentions that are relevant\u201d (Pelletier 2001 p496,\nsummarizing Ware 1975). Often, people\u2019s use, mental states, and\nthe nature of the referent under-determine whether on a particular\noccasion a noun/term/expression is used in a mass or count manner.\n\nCumulativity may be a more dogged criterion, as it is relatively\nconsistent for two (+COUNT/-MASS)\nN\u2019s not to be an N, e.g. two people don\u2019t seem to be a\nperson, whereas some (-COUNT/+MASS) N\nand some other N are N, e.g. two bits of water are water. But there\nare many counterexamples to this as well. If there is an aggregate of\nwell-demarcated individuals, then the aggregation of it with another\nyields an aggregate. Two connected but discrete planes can compose a\nplane, and some robots could be made to, Voltron-style, compose a\nrobot. Or, less exotically, in certain circumstances two fleets or\narmies could compose a fleet or army. Granted, these are somewhat\nartificial examples, and cumulativity does seem to be much more common\nin +MASS than +COUNT, but it is not\ndistinguished in this from +PLURAL. (See Sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3.1\n for accounts which reduce mass reference to plural reference).\n\nThere is empirical work which militates against the standard criteria\nput forward for differentiating mass and count, and also questions the\nover-reliance of researchers on their own intuitions about the\ndistinction (Kiss et al, 2017). Reflection upon recent\nempirical evidence in language-acquisition has led some researchers to\ntentatively conclude that particular nouns themselves, whether mass or\ncount, \u201cdo not encode full conceptual criteria for\nindividuation, but instead encode partial criteria that are filled out\npragmatically, by contrasting alternative descriptions of objects and\ntheir parts\u201d (Srinivasan and Barner 2020, p159). But it would be\nirresponsible to suggest that there is just \u2018nothing to\u2019\nthe mass/count distinction, nor any universal or near-universal\ndistinguishing features (See Chierchia 2010 p.4). One can maintain\nthat while there are different mass and count senses, that\nnevertheless, all nouns are both mass and count, as\nwe see defended in Pelletier 2012b. (For challenges to this, see Kiss\net al 2021b). Yet others argue that it is not the distinction\nbetween mass and count that matters so much, rather what matters is\nthe more general distinction between being +COUNT and\n+NON-COUNT (Laycock 2006b & 2006c, Rothstein 2010,\nWiese 2012, and see chapter 1 of Massam 2012 for other proposed\nreplacements to, or more general alternatives to, the mass/count\ndistinction).\nArbitrariness\n\nRelying on the +MASS/+COUNT distinction\nto support any strong metaphysical conclusions has the additional\nproblem that, in many cases, whether we use a mass or count term\nappears to be almost completely arbitrary (and certainly\nnon-universal, see the next section). The following is a chart which\nlists many nouns in English and shows how their translations\nfrequently diverge in terms of being +MASS or\n+COUNT (The following examples are from Pelletier 2001,\n2011; Chierchia 1998a, 2010):\n\nCross-Linguistic Mass/Count Variation\n\n\ndandruff\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nFrench: les pellicules\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) lit. \u2018the\nfilms\u2019 \n\ndish(es)\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT)\nFrench: la vaisalle\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT) \n\nfurniture\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nGerman: ein m\u00f6bel\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) \n\nnews\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)\nGerman: eine nachricht\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT) lit. \u2018a\nnews\u2019 \n\nstrawberry\n\n(-MASS/+COUNT)\nRussian: klubnika /\n\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\n\n(+MASS/-COUNT)  \n\n\nEven within English often the use seems arbitrary, where the\nfollowing illustrate cases where either (i) the choice to use a\n+MASS/-COUNT or\n-MASS/+COUNT term is (usually) arbitrary\non the occasion of use, or (ii) where a contrast is given (e.g.\nbetween fruit and vegetables) where one can see that\nour decision to make the default noun mass and another count is\narbitrary, since there is no inherent mass/count difference in the\nreferents. (These examples, and the point, are from Pelletier 1989\np19, and 2012 p429, and Gillon 1992 p.627, 2012 p.721).\n\n\n\n+MASS/-COUNT\n-MASS/+COUNT  \n\n\nfruit\nvegetables \n\nflu\ncold \n\nspaghetti\nnoodle \n\nfootware\nshoes \n\nchange\ncoins \n\nknowledge\nbelief \n\nrice\nbeans \n\nbaklava\nbrownies \n\nfoliage\nleaves \n\nammunition\nbullets  \n\nNon-Universality\n\nStrawson\n (1959) introduced the notion of \u2018descriptive metaphysics\u2019\nto self-describe his attempt to explain what \u2018individuals\u2019\nare, according to ordinary language. Projects like this do not seek to\ncarve out the ontic joints in nature so much as show where \u2018the\nfolk\u2019 supposedly think such joints are, as implied by their\nlanguage use. Projects like this represent attempts to describe our\nmetaphysical picture of the world rather than argue that the picture\nis right.\n\nPrescriptive metaphysics, by contrast, seeks to argue for particular\nmetaphysical views that may not gel with commonsense or ordinary\nlanguage. Prescriptive metaphysics often relies on the descriptive in\norder to advance its agenda\u2014sometimes as a foil, other times as\na baseline from which to deviate minimally only when required, or\nregarded as an oppressive thought system that we need liberation from,\nand so on. Often prescriptivists are descriptivists inasmuch as they\nattempt to \u2018paraphrase\u2019 their replacement ontology into\nthe language of the folk and its implicit ontology, and the\navailability of such a paraphrase is sometimes thought to be required\nfor the replacement ontology to be considered successful. Such a\nparaphrase requires doing descriptive metaphysics.\n\nYet the descriptive is not free from prescriptivity either, since\nthere are obviously disagreements amongst practitioners of descriptive\nmetaphysics, and conflicting intuitions about what \u2018our\u2019\nimplicit ontology is. And so descriptivists argue that we should\naccept one descriptive view over another, but such arguments often\nrely on pointing out that the opponents\u2019 view cannot be a\ncorrect view of reality, or rely on a principle of charity that\nrequires attempting to massage the folk view so that it ends up being\ncorrect as a depiction of reality, which in turn relies on the\nprescriptive non-universal intuitions of the descriptive\nmetaphysician. Any sufficiently rich descriptive metaphysics is not\nfree from some prescriptive content. And so they need each other, and\nare inextricably intertwined.\n\nMost of the foregoing metaphysicians (not necessarily philosophers of\nlanguage or linguists) we have examined have practiced a sort of mixed\nmethodology. One starts by pointing out the commonsense distinction in\nEnglish between mass and count, and one then proceeds to develop a\npicture which can both explain, and be consistent with, ordinary talk,\nas well as solving whichever particular problems the metaphysician in\nquestion is concerned with. Often one takes the ordinary language\ndistinction as evidence in their view\u2019s favor, together with\nvarious prescriptively informed premises not necessarily endorsed by\nfolk ontology.\n\nThe problem with this procedure is that the distinction between mass\nand count is often employed by metaphysicians to make universal\nconclusions about \u2018our\u2019 (i.e., humanity\u2019s) implicit\nconceptual scheme, usually by merely examining English (or\nthe one to three Indo-European languages known by the author).\n\nAs one early critic of Strawson\u2019s method noted (Mei 1961, cited\nin Pelletier 2011 pp. 37\u20138):\n\n\nStrawson exploits facts peculiar to languages like English \u2026 in\nChinese, Strawson\u2019s criteria are inapplicable \u2026 [his]\n\u2026 Aristotelian arguments based upon the pecularities of English\nand its relatives \u2026 [Strawson\u2019s notion of]\n\u2018assertive ties\u2019, and subject-predicate\n\u2018congruence\u2019 only works for languages with sufficient\ninflection \u2026. Strawson\u2019s silence [about other languages]\ncan be interpreted in only two ways. He must either have thought that\nthey conform to his criterion or that they are irrelevant. But the\ngrammatical facts of Chinese do not conform to his criterion \u2026\nand to say that they are irrelevant is to claim that English is the\nparadigm of all languages. What justification can Strawson, or any of\nhis colleagues, offer for this act of linguistic imperialism? (Mei\n1961 p157, most truncation and interpolation is Pelletier\u2019s)\n\n\nWhile the mass/count distinction is relatively pervasive, it is not\nclearly universal. Some (e.g. Sharvy 1978) have argued that Mandarin\nhas no count nouns at all, and rather refers to individuals by\nimposing a measure or classifier on what are by default mass nouns.\nSo, for example, \u2018a cigarette\u2019\n(\u2018\u9999\u70df\u2019) is best understood as something like\n\u2018a stick\u2019s worth of cigarette-stuff.\u2019 But others\n(e.g. Cheng & Sybesma 1999, Cherchia 2010) have argued that we are\nto look for the +MASS/-COUNT distinction\nin the classifier system itself (cf Pelletier 2011 p30),\nwhile yet others argue that there just is no distinction between mass\nand count in Mandarin. In an opposite fashion, Whorf (1944) argued\nthat Hopi has only count nouns, and Davis and Matthewson (2009) have\nargued that the Lillooet Salish language lacks mass nouns\nentirely.\n\nWhile ignoring the details, The D\u00ebn\u00eb\nS\u0173\u0142in\u00eb\u0301 language (spoken by the Den\u00e9 or\nChipeweyan people of Northwest Canada) arguably does not have a\nmass/count distinction whatsoever, nor do the Amazonian languages\nKaritiana or Yudja. (See Pelletier 2011 p31, and a challenge to this\nin Chierchia 2021. See Wiltschko 2012 for an examination of languages\nwhich lack a mass/count distinction, and for extremely recent and\ncopious work on this see the Kiss, Pelletier, and Husic (eds.) 2021\ncollection).\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been definitively demonstrated that the\nmass/count distinction is not universal (cf. Chierchia 2021), neither\ncan one easily claim that it is (cf. Massam 2012 ch.1). Maybe its\nuniversality is not needed for their purposes, but authors frequently\nseem to argue that syntactical, lexical, or semantic features of mass\nvs. count give one strong reason to believe that such a distinction\ngoes beyond the representational and reflects reality itself.\n",
