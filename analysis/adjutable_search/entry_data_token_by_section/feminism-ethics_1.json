    "main_text": "Feminist Ethics: Historical Background || Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Forerunners of Feminist Ethics\n1.1 Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Forerunners of Feminist Ethics\n\nIn the seventeenth century, some public intellectuals published\ntreatises arguing that women were as rational as men and should be\nafforded the education that would allow them to develop their moral\ncharacter. They argued that since females are rational, their unequal\naccess to learning was immoral and unjustifiable. They explored\nmeta-ethical questions about the preconditions for morality, including\nwhat sorts of agents can be moral and whether morality is equally\npossible for different sexes. For example, in 1694, Mary\nAstell\u2019s first edition of A Serious Proposal to the Ladies\nfor the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest was\npublished, advocating for access to education. It was controversial\nenough that Astell issued a sequel three years later, A Serious\nProposal, Part II, that challenged \u201cthose deep background\nphilosophical and theological assumptions which deny women the\ncapacity for improvement of the mind\u201d (Springborg,\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d in Astell 2002, 21). At the time, some\napparently attributed the first Serious Proposal not to\nAstell, but to Damaris Cudworth Masham, a one-time companion of John\nLocke, since such criticisms of the injustice of women\u2019s lot and\nthe background assumptions maintaining their subordinate situation\nwere familiar to Masham (Springborg, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d in\nAstell 2002, 17). Although Masham sharply disagreed with aspects of\nAstell\u2019s work, she too would later come to be credited with\n\u201cexplicitly feminist claims,\u201d including objections to\n\u201cthe inferior education accorded women\u201d (Frankel 1989,\n84), especially when such obstacles were due to \u201cthe ignorance\nof men\u201d (Masham 1705, 169, quoted in Frankel 1989, 85). Masham\nalso deplored \u201cthe double standard of morality imposed on women\nand men, especially \u2026 the claim that women's\n\u2018virtue\u2019 consists primarily in chastity\u201d (Frankel\n1989, 85).\n\nA century later, Mary Wollstonecraft, in her Vindication of the\nRights of Women ([1792] 1988), renewed attention to girls\u2019\nlack of access to education. Criticizing the philosophical assumptions\nunderpinning practices that denied girls adequate education,\nWollstonecraft articulated an Enlightenment ideal of the social and\nmoral rights of women as the equal of men. Wollstonecraft also\nbroadened her critique of social structures to encompass ethical\ntheory, especially in resistance to the arguments of influential men\nthat women\u2019s virtues are different from men\u2019s and\nappropriate to perceived feminine duties. Wollstonecraft asserted:\n\u201cI here throw down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual\nvirtues,\u201d adding that \u201cwomen, I allow, may have different\nduties to fulfil; but they are human duties, and the\nprinciples that should regulate the discharge of them \u2026 must be\nthe same\u201d (51). The revolutions of the Enlightenment age\nmotivated some men as well as women to reconsider inequities in\neducation at a time when notions of universal human rights were\ngaining prominence. As Joan Landes observes,\nMarie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet was an\nextraordinary advocate for the rights of women in France during the\nsame period who argued in 1790 for \u201cthe admission of women to\nthe rights of citizenship\u201d and \u201cwoman's equal humanity on\nthe grounds of reason and justice\u201d (Landes 2016). Like many\ntheorists of their time and places, including Catherine Macaulay\n(Tomaselli 2016), Olympe de Gouges, and Madame de Sta\u00ebl (Landes\n2016), Wollstonecraft and Condorcet granted that there were material\ndifferences between the sexes, but advanced moral arguments against\nethical double-standards on the basis of universal humanism. Yet the\nnotion of universal humanism tended to prioritize virtues\ntraditionally seen as masculine. Wollstonecraft, for example, argued\nagainst perceptions that women lacked men\u2019s capacities for\nmorality, but praised rationality and \u201cmasculinity\u201d as\npreconditions for morality (Tong 1993, 44). \n",
