    "main_text": "Disunity and pluralism || Metapluralism\n5.3 Metapluralism\n\nThe preference for one kind of pluralism over another is typically\nmotivated by epistemic virtues or constraints. Meta-pluralism, or\npluralism about pluralism, is obviously conceivable in similar terms,\nas it can be found in the formulation of the so-called pluralist\nstance (Kellert, Longino and Waters 2006). The pluralist stance\nreplaces metaphysical principles with scientific or empirical\nmethodological rules and aims that have been \u201ctested\u201d.\nLike Dupr\u00e9\u2019s and Cartwright\u2019s metaphysical\npositions, its metascientific position must be empirically tested.\nMetascientific conclusions and assumptions cannot be considered\nuniversal or necessary, but are local, contingent and relative to\nscientific interests and purposes. Thus, on this view, complexity does\nnot always require interdisciplinarity (Kellert 2008), and in some\nsituations the pluralist stance will defend reductions or\nspecialization over interdisciplinary integration (Kellert, Longino\nand Waters 2006; Cat 2012; Rescher 1993).\n",
