    "main_text": "What is a Child?\n1. What is a Child?\n\nAlmost single-handedly, Philippe Ari\u00e8s, in his influential\nbook, Centuries of Childhood (Ari\u00e8s, 1962), made the\nreading public aware that conceptions of childhood have varied across\nthe centuries. The very notion of a child, we now realize, is both\nhistorically and culturally conditioned. But exactly how the\nconception of childhood has changed historically and how conceptions\ndiffer across cultures is a matter of scholarly controversy and\nphilosophical interest (see Kennedy, 2006). Thus Ari\u00e8s argued,\npartly on the evidence of depictions of infants in medieval art, that\nthe medievals thought of children as simply \u201clittle\nadults.\u201d Shulamith Shahar (1990), by contrast, finds evidence\nthat some medieval thinkers understood childhood to be divided into\nfairly well-defined stages. And, whereas Piaget claims that his\nsubjects, Swiss children in the first half of the 20th Century, were\nanimistic in their thinking (Piaget, 1929), Margaret Mead (1967)\npresents evidence that Pacific island children were not.\n\nOne reason for being skeptical about any claim of radical\ndiscontinuity\u2014at least in Western conceptions of\nchildhood\u2014arises from the fact that, even today, the dominant\nview of children embodies what we might call a broadly\n\u201cAristotelian conception\u201d of childhood. According to\nAristotle, there are four sorts of causality, one of which is Final\ncausality and another is Formal Causality. Aristotle thinks of the\nFinal Cause of a living organism as the function that organism\nnormally performs when it reaches maturity. He thinks of the Formal\nCause of the organism as the form or structure it normally has in\nmaturity, where that form or structure is thought to enable the\norganism to perform its functions well. According to this conception,\na human child is an immature specimen of the organism type, human,\nwhich, by nature, has the potentiality to develop into a mature\nspecimen with the structure, form, and function of a normal or\nstandard adult.\n\nMany adults today have this broadly Aristotelian conception of\nchildhood without having actually read any of Aristotle. It informs\ntheir understanding of their own relationship toward the children\naround them. Thus they consider the fundamental responsibility they\nbear toward their children to be the obligation to provide the kind of\nsupportive environment those children need to develop into normal\nadults, with the biological and psychological structures in place\nneeded to perform the functions we assume that normal, standard adults\ncan perform.\n\nTwo modifications of this Aristotelian conception have been\nparticularly influential in the last century and a half. One is the\n19th century idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\n(Gould, 1977), that is, that the development of an individual\nrecapitulates the history and evolutionary development of the race, or\nspecies (Spock, 1968, 229). This idea is prominent in Freud (1950) and\nin the early writings of Jean Piaget (see, e.g. Piaget, 1933). Piaget,\nhowever, sought in his later writings to explain the phenomenon of\nrecapitulation by appeal to general principles of structural change in\ncognitive development (see, e.g., Piaget, 1968, 27).\n\nThe other modification is the idea that development takes places in\nage-related stages of clearly identifiable structural change.\nThis idea can be traced back to ancient thinkers, for example the\nStoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 49). Stage theory is to be found in\nvarious medieval writers (Shahar, 1990, 21\u201331) and, in the\nmodern period, most prominently in Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s\nhighly influential work, Emile (1979). But it is Piaget who\nfirst developed a highly sophisticated version of stage theory and\nmade it the dominant paradigm for conceiving childhood in the latter\npart of the 20th Century (see, e.g., Piaget, 1971).\n\nMatthews (2008, 2009), argues that a Piagetian-type stage theory of\ndevelopment tends to support a \u201cdeficit conception\u201d of\nchildhood, according to which the nature of the child is understood\nprimarily as a configuration of deficits\u2014missing capacities that\nnormal adults have but children lack. This conception, he argues,\nignores or undervalues the fact that children are, for example, better\nable to learn a second language, or paint an aesthetically worthwhile\npicture, or conceive a philosophically interesting question, than\nthose same children will likely be able to do as adults. Moreover, it\nrestricts the range and value of relationships adults think they can\nhave with their children.\n\nBroadly Aristotelian conceptions of childhood can have two further\nproblematic features. They may deflect attention away from thinking\nabout children with disabilities in favour of theorizing solely about\nnormally developing children (see Carlson 2010), and they may distract\nphilosophers from attending to the goods of childhood when they think\nabout the responsibilities adults have towards the children in their\ncare, encouraging focus only on care required to ensure that children\ndevelop adult capacities.\n\nHow childhood is conceived is crucial for almost all the\nphilosophically interesting questions about children. It is also\ncrucial for questions about what should be the legal status of\nchildren in society, as well as for the study of children in\npsychology, anthropology, sociology, and many other fields.\n",
