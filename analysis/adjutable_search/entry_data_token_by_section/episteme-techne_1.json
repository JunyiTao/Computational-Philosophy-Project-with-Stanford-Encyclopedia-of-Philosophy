    "main_text": "Plato\n2. Plato\n\nIn Plato\u2019s dialogues the relation between knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and craft or skill\n(techn\u00ea) is complex and surprising. There is no general\nand systematic account of either but rather overlapping treatments,\nreflecting the context of different dialogues. Nevertheless, Plato\nemphasizes certain characteristics of both that demonstrate a\nsustained and consistent engagement with the two concepts.\n\nThroughout the dialogues characters frequently cite\ntechn\u00ea as a way of illustrating important points in\ntheir philosophical conversations. Some crafts mentioned are medicine,\nhorsemanship, huntsmanship, oxherding, farming, calculation, geometry,\ngeneralship, piloting a ship, chariot-driving, political craft,\nprophecy, music, lyre-playing, flute-playing, painting, sculpture,\nhousebuilding, shipbuilding, carpentry, weaving, pottery, smithing,\nand cookery. Each of these activities is associated with the word\ntechn\u00ea, e.g., medicine with the iatrik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea. Each is also associated with a practitioner, e.g.,\nmedicine with a physician (iatros). Other crafts are\nmentioned but without practitioners, e.g., arithmetic, flute-making,\nand sorcery. Socrates uses medicine much more than any other\ntechn\u00ea; other crafts repeatedly mentioned, albeit less\nfrequently than medicine, are house-building, weaving, political\ncraft, music, shoemaking, piloting a ship, generalship, prophecy,\ncarpentry, farming, horsemanship, flute-playing. To our contemporary\nears this list is quite various; it is hard to think that they all\nhave any interesting characteristics in common. Such crafts, or\ntechnai, as farming and building have concrete, inanimate\nproducts. Horse training and huntsmanship care for animate but\nnon-human beings. Medicine cares for the health of humans. Calculation\nhas neither a concrete product nor does it provide care.\n\nIn some dialogues, craft (techn\u00ea) and knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) seem interchangeable in much the same\nway as in Xenophon\u2019s Socratic dialogues. In the\nCharmides (165c) Socrates says that medicine, i.e., the\nphysician\u2019s craft (iatrik\u00ea techn\u00ea), is the\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) of health. In\nEuthydemus (281a) Socrates says that what guides right use of\nmaterials in carpentry is the knowledge of carpentry\n(techtonik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea). In\nIon (532c) Socrates tells the rhapsode Ion that he is not\nable to talk about Homer with craft and knowledge. In\nProtagoras (356d-e) Socrates refers to measuring as both a\ncraft and a kind of knowledge.\n\nHowever, Plato\u2019s interest in techn\u00ea is not\ninnocent. He uses the notion as a way of explicating central themes,\nsuch as virtue, ruling, and the creation of the cosmos. As a\nconsequence, he develops a complex account of techn\u00ea.\nFirst of all, a craft has a function (ergon); this is what it\ncharacteristically does or what it characteristically accomplishes. In\nfact, crafts are differentiated by their specific functions\n(erga)(Rep. 346a). A similar idea is assumed in the\nexchange between Dionysiodorus and Socrates (Euthydemus\n301c), as it is by Socrates in Euthyphro (13d) and\nIon (537c). While the ergon of a craft is its goal,\nthe goal is frequently identified with a result separate from the\nactivity of the craft. In the Euthydemus (291e) the goal\n(ergon) of medicine is health just as food is the goal\n(ergon) of farming. When in the Charmides (165e)\nCritias denies that calculation has an ergon, in the way that\na house is the ergon of building or a garment of weaving,\nSocrates answers that nevertheless calculation is about the odd and\nthe even. His answer suggests the possibility of a\ntechn\u00ea whose goal is not a separate result \u2014 an\nidea to be found in the Statesman. Still in the\nGorgias (453e\u2013454a) Socrates argues that calculation produces\nas its ergon persuasion about the amount of the odd and the\neven \u2014 a result separate from the activity of calculation.\n\nAs the concept of techn\u00ea develops, the role of\nreflective knowledge is emphasized. Whereas techn\u00ea is\nassociated with knowing how to do (epistasthai) certain\nactivities, epist\u00eam\u00ea sometimes indicates a\ntheoretical component of techn\u00ea. For example, the\nphysician knows how to care for the sick (Rep. 342d), to\nprescribe a regimen (Rep. 407d), to provide for the advantage\nof the body (Rep. 341e), to make someone healthy\n(Charm. 174c), to make someone vomit (Laws 933b).\nHowever, the epist\u00eam\u00ea associated with craft means\nmore than simply how to do certain activities. The physician knows or\nrecognizes (gign\u00f4skein) health by medical knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) (Charm. 170c). Since health\nis the goal of the medical craft, the physician understands the goal\nof the craft. Plato emphasizes this knowledge as a distinct aspect of\nthe craftsman\u2019s skill. Sometimes this aspect is theoretical in\nthe root sense of the\u00f4ria \u2014 looking. In the\nCratylus (389a\u2013b) Socrates talks about the carpenter who\nmakes the weaver\u2019s shuttle; he looks to (blep\u00f4n)\nsomething whose nature is to weave. This latter seems to be a material\nmodel because Socrates supposes what would happen if it were to break.\nIn that case, the carpenter looks to the form (eidos) of\nshuttle, that which is shuttle (ho estin kerkis). In the\nGorgias (503d-e) all craftsmen work not at random but look\ntoward the goal of their craft (ergon) so that what each\nproduces will have a certain form. Socrates cites painters,\nhousebuilders, and shipbuilders. In Republic VI Socrates\ncompares philosophers who are rulers to painters who look to a model\n(484c).\n\nThe theoretical aspect is also expressed as articulate reasoning about\nthe goal. In Plato\u2019s view, the ability to explain why he does\nwhat he does is one of the most important characteristics of the\ncraftsman. In the Charmides, Socrates says that we test the\nphysician by questioning him since he understands health\n(Charm. 170e5\u20137). Expanding on the idea of testing,\nSocrates says they will investigate the physician in what he says and\nin what he does, on whether what he says is true and whether what he\ndoes is right (171b7\u20139). This theoretical side of craft is\nfurther developed in the Gorgias. In his conversation with\nPolus and later in his conversation with Callicles, Socrates carries\non a sustained reflection about craft. In his conversation with Polus,\nSocrates distinguishes four crafts (technai: medicine,\nphysical training, judging, and legislating; the first pair are\nconcerned with the body and the latter with the soul (464b). These\ncrafts provide their care always for the best, either of the body or\nof the soul (464c). Unlike empiric practice (empeiria),\ntechn\u00ea has an account to give by which it provides the\nthings it provides, an account of what their nature is, so that it can\nsay the cause of each (465a). In the conversation with Callicles,\nSocrates returns to this account, when he seems especially interested\nin the ability of techn\u00ea to give an account. He says\nmedical techn\u00ea investigates the nature of the thing it\ncares for (therapeuei) and the cause of what it does and has\nan account to give of each of them (501a). In the first instance,\nmedicine cares for, or treats, the body; but, more particularly, it\ncares for the good of the body, i.e., its health. So, this\ntechn\u00ea has an account to give of health and of what it\ndoes to achieve the end of health.\n\nSo far then, a craft is defined by its goal and is a kind of\nknowledge. Fully developed, this knowledge is knowing how to\naccomplish a goal on the basis of an understanding of the goal; the\nunderstanding can be articulated in an account. The account informs\nand guides the skilled practice. A craftsman\u2019s being able to\narticulate the goal is most fully developed, perhaps, in the\nLaws. The Athenian Stranger describes the distinction between\nthe slave doctor and the doctor of free men as resting on the ability\nto give an account. The slave doctor relies on experience\n(empeiria) and has no account to give for his procedure. The\nfree doctor not only has an account, he communicates it to his\npatients as a way of eliciting their cooperation in the course of\ntreatment (720 b\u2013d). Presumably, the patients come to appreciate the\nreasons for the actions the doctor undertakes as well as the regimen\nhe prescribes because they better understand the nature of health and\nthe way the treatments produce health. In fact, the empiric doctor\nlaughs at the free doctor for instructing his patients \u2014 as\nthough he were trying to make them into doctors themselves (857\nd-e).\n\nThere is a second feature of techn\u00ea that is vital for\nunderstanding its importance to Plato. In the Gorgias,\ntechn\u00ea is distinguished from empeiria not only\nby its ability to give an account but also because it seeks the\nwelfare of its object. The physician and the physical trainer seek the\nwelfare of the body, just as the judge and the legislator seek the\nwelfare of the soul (464c). These features of techn\u00ea\nfigure in one of Plato\u2019s persistent themes, the knowledge needed\nto rule the city. One of its most important occurrences is in the\nRepublic, where Socrates characterizes ruling as a kind of\ntechn\u00ea that looks out after the welfare of the city\n(Rep. 342e). But in other dialogues as well, the authentic\nruler has a knowledge, both practical and theoretical, that allows him\nto achieve what is good for the city. In fact, the passage just cited\nfrom the Laws is part of an analogy to explain why the\nlegislator should be able to explain to the citizens the reasons\nbehind the law, and presumably why the law is good for the city.\n\nIndeed, most accounts of knowledge in the dialogues are carried out in\nthe context of such discussions. Even in the Theaetetus, the\ndialogue most often thought of as dedicated to epistemology, we find\nthe same theme. When he argues against Protagoras\u2019 relativism,\nSocrates gets the sophist to concede that some people are wiser than\nothers when it comes to what is good for the city (167c\u2013d). Socrates\nthen seizes upon an analogy with medicine. While each person may be\nthe final authority for himself when it comes to what is hot, dry, and\nsweet for him, in matters of health and disease not everyone knows the\nhealthy for himself nor is he able to cure himself. Just so, while\nProtagoras may hold that for each city what is fine or base, just or\nunjust, pious or impious is what the city takes it to be, what is\nreally advantageous for the city is not the same as what it takes to\nbe advantageous (171e \u2013 172b). Although Socrates\u2019\ninvestigation of knowledge becomes more abstract when he introduces\nbeing, not-being, likeness and unlikeness, identity and difference,\nunity and plurality, to this group he adds the fine and the base, the\ngood and the bad (185c\u2013186a). The soul itself investigates these\nthings, trying to determine their being (ousia) and their\nopposition to one another and the being of that opposition. Finally,\nthe investigation of being, non-being and the other opposites \u2014\nincluding the fine and the base, the good and the bad \u2014 also\nreflects both on the being of each and on its usefulness (pros te\nousian kai \u00f4pheleian) (186c).While Socrates does not\nexplain what reflecting on their usefulness amounts to, the remark\nshows a link, however slight, to the original motivation for the\ninvestigation of knowledge\u2014 i.e., providing what is really\nadvantageous for the city.\n\nNevertheless, these passages from the Theaetetus draw our\nattention to a change in the notion of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\nKnowledge of the forms tends to become an end in itself; and in this\nway the idea of knowledge as pure theory begins to make an appearance\nin the dialogues. This tension is also prominent in the\nRepublic, of course, where Socrates introduces and develops\nthe notion that rulers should be philosophers, who are defined by\ntheir knowledge of forms. At the beginning of the discussion of\nphilosophical rulers in Republic IV, knowledge and craft fall\ninto a familiar pattern of interchangeability. After defining the\nthree classes in the city, Socrates is looking for the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) in virtue of which the city is\nwell-counseled. He dismisses the crafts of carpentry, smithing, and\nfarming \u2014 obviously crafts and called epist\u00eamai\n(428b\u2013c). While these focus on some partial good for the city, the\nepist\u00eam\u00ea of ruling takes counsel for the city as\na whole and what is best for it internally and externally (428 b\u2013d).\nThen, in Republic V, Socrates introduces an altogether\ndifferent notion of the knowledge that philosophers will have \u2014\none whose object is forms. Indeed this passage defines for most\nreaders Plato\u2019s idea of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nKnowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) is the ability to know the\nreal as it is (477b). The context shows that when Socrates talks about\nthe real, he is referring to the forms. In the Republic, the\nprominent forms are the forms for the beautiful, the good, and the\njust. In the Symposium, Socrates describes the form of the\nbeautiful as neither coming to be nor passing away, as not changing in\nany other way, as never being or even appearing to anyone as anything\nbut beautiful (211a\u2013b). Since an analogous description applies to the\ngood and the just, one can see that forms are very different from the\nsorts of things we experience through the sensory perception\nassociated with the usual technai. After forms are introduced\nin the Republic, they are the objects of the most abstract\nand highest knowledge, afforded by the power of dialectic. At the end\nof Book VI, Socrates uses the words for knowledge that we have found\nin other contexts\u2014 understanding (gn\u00f4sis) and\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea). However, in the Divided\nLine passage a new vocabulary is introduced, as though the conception\nof knowledge has changed in a fundamental way. As he has in other\nplaces, Socrates divides the visible world (horaton) from the\nintelligible (no\u00eaton). Whereas before the intelligible\nhad been the undivided field of gn\u00f4sis and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, now it is subdivided into the fields of\nmathematical or deductive reasoning (dianoia) and the\ngrasping of the unhypothetical beginning point (nous). The\nlatter is the goal of dialectic (511a\u2013b).\n\nLater in Republic VI there is a connection\u2014of a\ndifferent sort\u2014between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. Knowledge, in the sense of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, will be deductive and logical like\nmathematics; unlike mathematics, its deductions will be based on\nfoundations that need no further justification. In part it will be\nsomething like mathematical deduction based on fundamental reality. Two\naspects of this account are significant. First, using a mathematical\nmodel as the root of this conception of knowledge makes it purely\ntheoretical; it is theoretical because, like calculation in the\nCharmides (165e), it has no separate product. Its\nergon seems to be the activity itself of dialectical thought.\nSecond, in using mathematical thinking as an analogue for dialectic,\nSocrates is still relying on the notion of techn\u00ea since\nboth geometry and calculation are technai. \n\nNevertheless, in the Divided Line, Socrates posits intelligible\nentities, abstract but real, as objects of mathematical thought and of\ndialectical knowledge. Although it treats them only as hypotheses,\nmathematics reasons about the odd and the even, the various kinds of\nshapes, and the three kinds of angles. These are entities distinct\nfrom their perceptual representation in material diagrams. In turn,\ndialectic does not treat forms as hypotheses but comes to know what\neach is. This knowledge comes from grasping their relation to the\nunhypothetical beginning point, the form of the good (509d-511e). The\nsuper-eminence of the knowledge of the good leads to the\nlatter\u2019s becoming an end in itself. When philosophers, after\nyears of study, at last see the good, they would prefer to stay at\nthis level and not go back down into the city to rule. They must be\nforced, by argument, to undertake the task of applying their knowledge\nof the forms to the affairs of ruling (519c\u2013520e). So, when this\naccount introduces abstract but real entities as objects of knowledge,\nSocrates comes close to giving theoretical knowledge a sphere of\nactivity that is distinct from that of practical knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, even though epist\u00eam\u00ea is tied to\nforms, it still has a role in techn\u00ea. First, at the\nbeginning of Republic VI, Socrates gives his interlocutors a\npeculiar description of what the philosopher will do with this\nknowledge of reality. Converting Socrates\u2019 negative description\nof the non-philosopher, we find that the philosopher has a knowledge\n(gn\u00f4sis) of the reality of each form, thus a clear\nparadigm in his soul. Like painters, philosophers look to\n(apoblepontes) the truest paradigm, always referring to it\nand contemplating it as accurately as possible; in this way they\nestablish here the laws respecting the fine, the just, and the good,\nif there is need to establish them, or take care to preserve those\nthat are established (484c\u2013d). By comparing philosophers to painters\nwho imitate a paradigm, Socrates is giving to the knowledge of forms a\nrole within a kind of craft which imitates forms. This notion of\nimitating forms is an important one for Plato; he uses it again in the\naccount of creation in the Timaeus. At 28a, the Demiurge\n\u2014 the craftsman of the universe \u2014 looking at\n(blep\u00f4n) that which does not change and using it as a\nparadigm, fashions its form and power into his creation. In the\nsubsequent passage we learn that this unchanging paradigm is the\nintelligible animal that contains all other intelligible animals\n(30c\u2013d).\n\nBesides the contexts in which epist\u00eam\u00ea of forms\nresults in imitating them, the dialogues offer another important way\nof reconciling knowledge of forms and techn\u00ea. In the\nSophist, the Visitor from Elea elaborates an analogy between\ntechn\u00ea and dialectic, whose objects are clearly forms.\nHe begins with the idea that there is a techn\u00ea for\ntelling which letters join to which, just as there is\ntechn\u00ea for which musical notes mingle and which do not\n(253a ff). Then the Visitor turns to the kinds (gen\u00ea)\nthat he has just introduced: being, rest, motion, sameness, and\ndifference (254d-e). Making an analogy with the grammatical and\nmusical technai, he posits a sort of knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) for showing which kinds harmonize and\nwhich do not. This is also the knowledge of how to discriminate\naccording to kinds, which the Visitor calls dialectic. While this\nknowledge of how to distinguish and to harmonize forms is compared to\ncraft, it is not productive, the way carpentry is productive. However,\nin the Statesman, the Visitor takes up the relation of\ndialectic, conceived of as theoretical, with practical knowledge. He\ncontrasts epist\u00eamai that are practical \u2014 like\ncarpentry \u2014 and those which are for knowledge only (258d). The\nVisitor calls them respectively the practical\n(praktik\u00ea) and the theoretical\n(gn\u00f4stik\u00ea \u2014 clearly related to\ngn\u00f4sis and gign\u00f4skein)(259d). The\npractical epist\u00eamai cover what are otherwise called\ncrafts; however, the theoretical is subdivided into (a)\nepist\u00eamai like calculation, which only judges or\ndistinguishes the things known and (b) epist\u00eamai like\nthat of the architect (architekt\u00f4n), which command and\nare thus called commanding (epitaktik\u00ea) (259e). The\nVisitor may seem to have blurred his original distinction between\npractical and theoretical by including commanding knowledge\n(epitaktik\u00ea) in the latter category. Still, the notion\nthat at least part of theoretical knowledge only judges the things\nknown gives us a basis for distinguishing theoretical from practical\nknowledge. The former entails craft-like skill; but the skill remains\nfocused on the objects of knowledge. In calculation the objects are\nnumbers; in dialectic they are the kinds. This kind of knowledge has\nno product separate from its activity; by contrast, practical\nknowledge actually produces something separate, in the way carpentry\ndoes. This way of expressing the difference suggests that theoretical\nepist\u00eam\u00ea is not so much a body of knowledge as an\nability to grasp very abstract sorts of distinctions. \n\nStill, by including commanding knowledge, the Visitor has left a\nmiddle ground between the purely theoretical and the practical.\nCertainly architecture is not practical since it does not directly\nproduce anything, in the way carpentry does. However, it does give\ncommands, whose effects are practical; thus, it is not for knowledge\nonly, in the way in which calculation is for knowledge only. Insofar\nas architecture is an analogue for the political craft, the Visitor\nseems to be exploiting this middle ground (259e). It is as though the\nVisitor is trying to associate the political craft with the most\nabstract disciplines, like geometry, even though it has to have\npractical impact. In fact, including commanding knowledge under\ntheoretical knowledge reflects again the tension between the knowledge\nneeded to rule and the elaboration of that knowledge. The ruler needs\nto be able to engage in purely theoretical investigation; he also\nneeds to bring order into the city. The Visitor turns to the latter\nactivity when he compares the kingly or political knowledge to\nweaving. Finally, he arrives at the conclusion that the kingly\nknowledge weaves together all the other epist\u00eamai\n\u2014 like generalship and judging \u2014 as well as the laws and\nthose things having to do with the city (305e). While no resolution is\noffered to this tension, two features of this long discussion are\nsuggestive. If the kingly or political epist\u00eam\u00ea\nis like weaving, it depends on the ability first of all to distinguish\nwhat it will weave together. Insofar as dialectic is the skill of\ndistinguishing the things known, it can serve as preliminary to\nweaving because it is preliminary to showing how the kinds harmonize.\nFurther, if political knowledge is like architecture, it is a\ncommanding knowledge (epitaktik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea);\nit gives commands. If we search for the source of these commands, a\nlikely source is the relations and distinctions to be found among\nforms. If so, the abstract structures discovered by\ngn\u00f4stik\u00ea are normative for the city, the way the\nforms are in the Republic.\n",
