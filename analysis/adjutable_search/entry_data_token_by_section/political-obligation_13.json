    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation\n4. Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation\n\nAlthough the lines that separate one theory from another are not\nalways distinct, philosophical justifications of political obligation\nnowadays usually take the form of arguments from consent, fair play,\nmembership, or natural duty. Some philosophers advance a hybrid of two\nor more of these approaches, and others hold, as the concluding\nsection shows, that a pluralistic theory is necessary. For the most\npart, though, attempts to justify a general obligation to obey the law\nfollow one of these four lines of argument.\n",
