Some adopt a principle of public\njustification. A public justification is a kind of rationale for\nexercising power and control. It is public because the rationale, or\ngroup of rationales, is one that members of the public can accept. Put\nanother way, to treat people as equals, we must ensure that political\npower is justified for or to them by their own\nlights, so a public justification thus consists of reasons the public\ncan recognize as valid. Those who adopt a public justification\nstandard are often called public reason liberals. Liberal\ninstitutions (freedom of speech, the rule of law, democracy) are\npublicly justified, but illiberal institutions are not. Diverse\nperspectives within the public will reject non-liberal\ninstitutions.\n\nCoercion is the standard object of public justification because it is\nperhaps the characteristic feature of political life. Charles Larmore\nremarks that public justification has \u201cto do with the sort of\nrespect we owe one another in the political realm \u2014 that is, in\nrelationships where the possibility of coercion is involved\u201d\n(Larmore 2008, 86). John Rawls\u2019s principle of public\njustification holds that political power requires justification (Rawls\n2005, 12) because \u201cpolitical power is always coercive\npower\u201d (Rawls 2005, 68). Jonathan Quong holds that public\njustification concerns the imposition of coercive laws (Quong 2011,\n233\u2013250). And, as Christopher Eberle puts it (2002, 54),\n\u201cthe clarion call of justificatory liberalism is the public\njustification of coercion.\u201d Some have wondered whether\nnon-coercive state actions need public justification (2.7). But they\nnonetheless agree that coercion generally, if not always, requires\nit.\n\nThe idea of a public justification is, at its root, an idea about\nwhich reasons justify coercion. Public justification is not a\nprocess of exchanging reasons. Instead, the exchange of\nreasons can uncover or generate a public justification. Or we could\narrive at a public justification through a non-deliberative route.\nExamples include bargaining processes and adjudicative procedures. In\nthis way, the ideas of public reason and public justification are\ndistinct. Public justifications might consist of public reasons. But a\nreason shared by the public might fall short of a sound justification\nif other reasons undercut or override it. One might, for example,\nsupport a new anti-poverty program on shared grounds of justice for\nthe poor. However, alternative programs reduce poverty more\neffectively. The original poverty program could be publicly justified\nbased on a shared commitment to justice, but other shared reasons,\nlike policy efficacy, can undercut the public justification for the\nprogram.\n\nRawls was the foremost advocate of the idea of public justification.\nBut we find the idea stressed in the works of J\u00fcrgen Habermas,\nDavid Gauthier, Gerald Gaus, Stephen Macedo, Charles Larmore, Seyla\nBenhabib, and many others.\n\nThere is considerable disagreement about how to understand the idea.\nSome theorists hold that all public justifications consist of shared\nor accessible reasons. These are often called consensus\ntheorists. Others allow diverse, unshared reasons to figure into\npublic justifications. These are often called convergence\ntheorists. (See\n Section 2.3\n below). Public justification theorists also disagree about how to\nattribute reasons to citizens. This disagreement is about the right\nlevel of idealization. Idealization involves modeling someone\nas having improved information and cognitive capacities. The goal is\nto identify which reasons apply to her, even if she cannot or will not\nsee them as such in her ordinary life. Some theorists adopt more\nradical idealizations than others.\n\nThis entry addresses disputes about public justification by\narticulating an open-ended principle. This Public Justification\nPrinciple (PJP) helps classify competing conceptions of public\njustification.\n\nThe entry first situates public justification in the history of\npolitical philosophy. The PJP is then stated and explained, along with\nits chief variables. Variables include conceptions of reasons,\nidealization, processes of public justification, and others. The entry\nthen examines the arguments on behalf of the principle; different\nfoundations for the PJP are then discussed. The entry also addresses\nconcepts of political stability and publicity related to public\njustification. And then, it reviews various objections to the PJP. The\nentry concludes by discussing how theorists apply public justification\nto specific controversies.\n", "toc": [{"#Ori": "1. Origins"}, {"#PubJusPri": "2.

Origins\n\nPublic justification arose to resolve problems for social contract\ntheory.\n\nClassical social contract theorists grounded political legitimacy on\nconsent. The chief social contract theorists were Thomas Hobbes, John\nLocke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. They had different\nstandards of consent; the first three oscillated between an empirical\nand a normative standard. The empirical standard draws on actual\nmental states: consent justifies political power because it draws on\neach party\u2019s beliefs and values. The normative standard draws on\nsomehow rational mental states: we appeal not to what people believe\nand value but what they have reason to believe and value. Political\npower is justified when grounded in what parties ideally affirm. In\nthe latter case, we sometimes speak of hypothetical consent as a proxy\nfor rational justification.\n\nIn general, empirical standards gave way to normative standards.\nTheorists wanted to legitimize uses of power that contradict what\npeople actually will. By Kant\u2019s time, actual consent views had\ndisappeared. Hypothetical consent was the state of play. The normative\nstandard of legitimacy had won out.\n\nAll four theorists recognize the diversity of private judgments about\njustice. All allowed moral judgments to diverge for any number of\nreasons. They all concluded that private judgment could not ground\nlegitimacy for a diverse public. As Rawls (2005, vii) would put it,\nthese theorists recognized reasonable pluralism. Citizens who reason\nfreely will disagree about fundamental values and principles. Contract\ntheorists concluded that justifications for political power had to\nrespect diverse judgments. So justification could not rest on one\nspecific set of beliefs and values. A public justification had to be\nimpartial, at least among respectable but diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe idea of public justification surfaced in Kant\u2019s work but\nthen entered hibernation for a century. Social contract theory gave\nway to utilitarianism, Hegelianism, and Marxism. These three schools\nof thought rejected the idea of a social contract, though they have\ndistinct reasons for doing so. The social contract tradition revived\nonly after World War II, first in the United States.\n\nOne of the first new forms of social contract theory was\ncontractarianism, which justifies coercive institutions through\ninstrumental rationality: justified political arrangements are\nrational bargains among parties for dividing social resources. The\nfirst contemporary contract theorists were economists like John\nHarsanyi and James Buchanan. But neo-Hobbesian philosophers pursued a\nsimilar project, especially David Gauthier, Jean Hampton, and Gregory\nKavka.\n\nBut the dominant strand of the new contract tradition was Kantian.\nHere John Rawls leads the pack in A Theory of Justice and\nlater in Political Liberalism. Political Liberalism\nfeatures public justification as this entry understands the concept.\nRawls first understood public justification as a hypothetical\ncontract: idealized members of the public choose principles of\njustice. Only Political Liberalism articulates the challenge\nthat reasonable pluralism poses for political legitimacy. For Rawls,\nthe public must adopt principles justified for them despite their\ndifferences. Political power is legitimate only when exercised in\naccord with publicly justified norms. (Some theorists use\n\u201cjustified\u201d and \u201cpublicly justified\u201d as\nsynonyms. See 2.3 below.)\n\nThe modern idea of public justification thus only comes into full view\nin the early 1990s. Works on public reason and justification published\nin rapid succession. They produced a new tradition of political\nthought that flourishes today; indeed, public justification is now a\ncore concept in political philosophy. Yet the idea admits significant\nvariation, so we now examine those differences.\n2. The Public Justification Principle\n\nPublic justification theories vary. But we can categorize them\naccording to the Public Justification Principle (PJP). Define\nthe PJP as follows:\n\n\nThe Public Justification Principle (PJP): A coercive law\n\\(L\\) is justified in a public \\(P\\) if and only if each member \\(i\\)\nof \\(P\\) has sufficient reason(s) \\(R_i\\) to endorse \\(L\\).\n\n\nThe principle permits individuals 1 and 2 to have different reasons to\nendorse \\(L\\). Public justifications can consist of reasons some in\n\\(P\\) reject. But in this case, \\(L\\) is still justified for the\npublic as a whole. The justification encompasses the public but as\ndistinct individuals. The justification also need not be public as\ncommon knowledge; an individual\u2019s reason \\(R_i\\) need not be\ncommon knowledge in \\(P\\).\n\nOne can analyze the PJP through answers to the following seven\nquestions:\n\nWhat makes a reason \u201csufficient\u201d?\nHow fine-grained is the specification by \\(L\\) of the conduct\nwhich is permitted or prohibited for members of the public?\nWhat types of justificatory reasons \\(R\\) do we recognize?\nHow are the parties to public justificatory arguments\nidealized?\nWhat is the scope of the public?\nWhat are the modalities of public justification? Or: by which\nprocess is public justification achieved?\nMust we publicly justify anything other than coercion?\n\n\nAgain, public justification does not require the presentation\nof reasons. A declaration may produce or uncover a public\njustification, but societies may generate public justifications in\nother ways (see 2.7). Thus, John can have a justifying reason even if\nno one presents it to him through explicit reasoning. We must\nnonetheless explain the ideas of a reason and of a sufficient reason\nto endorse some law \\(L\\).\n2.1 \u201cSufficient\u201d Reasons\n\nThe PJP requires that members of a public \\(P\\) have reason to endorse\na principle \\(L\\). One must then explain what it means to \u201chave\na reason to endorse\u201d \\(L\\).\n\nA common approach to reasons in normative ethics is to take the idea\nof a reason as primitive. A reason to \\(\\Phi\\) is a consideration that\ncounts in favor of \\(\\Phi\\)-ing (Scanlon 1998, 17). But the idea of a\nreason in public justification theory is more specific. We do not need\nan ontology of reasons, but we must explain when a reason\njustifies a proposal. Gaus defends a conception of reasons on\nepistemic grounds in Justificatory Liberalism. One has a\njustificatory reason when openly justified. A reason is\nopenly justified when it is \u201cstable in the face of acute and\nsustained criticism by others and of new information\u201d (Gaus\n1996, 31).\n\nA reason is sufficient when it has some positive epistemic grounds.\nSome considerations favor it, and none defeat it. Critically, a reason\ncan be sufficient for one member of the public but not others. So, a\njustifying reason may not justify coercion for all members of the\npublic. A coercive law is only justified when each person has\nsufficient reason to endorse \\(L\\). Laws gain public justification by\nresting on the sufficient reasons of each member.\n\nPublic justification theorists assume that our personal reasons for\naction and belief can differ, and in some cases, substantially. The\nreasons one may offer in public justification may be narrower than\none\u2019s personal reasons, but even consensus theorists think that\njustifying reasons must, in some sense, adhere to an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs and values. Public justification theorists need not adopt\nGaus\u2019s epistemology of justificatory reasons, but the correct\naccount cannot be too far off.\n\nPublic justification theorists thus acknowledge that citizens can\nrationally affirm reasons that others reject. And so, different\nindividuals may have epistemic justification to endorse quite\ndifferent reasons. While members of the public themselves need not\nrecognize these (admittedly) abstruse principles, theorists\nmust accept that two individuals can have reasonable grounds for\naffirming diverse and incompatible reasons.\n\nPublic justification theory rejects actual endorsement standards,\nopting for idealization (as we will see in 2.4). Today theorists\neither appeal to counterfactual endorsement or rationally required\nendorsement. In the former case, an agent would accept the law through\na deliberate act of will. In the latter case, an agent endorses a law\nwhen rationally committed to affirming it; that is, rationality\nrequires that she approve it through a deliberate act of will.\n2.2 Granularity\n\nWhat is the object of public justification? What is the thing that we\npublicly justify? Answers differ, and we can classify them by their\n\u201cgranularity.\u201d Some exercises of political power and state\ncoercion are small, like legal regulations, while others are broader,\nlike constitutions. If we take laws as our object of justification, we\ntake a fine-grained approach. But if constitutions are our object, we\ntake a coarse-grained approach.\n\nRawls (2005, 140) adopts a coarse-grained approach, applying public\njustification to \u201cconstitutional essentials\u201d and\n\u201cbasic questions of justice.\u201d Jonathan Quong (2004,\n233\u2013259) adopts a fine-grained approach. He applies public\njustification first to laws. Gaus (2011, 495) focuses on laws that\nlack \u201cstrong interactive effects\u201d with other laws. For\ninstance, a smoking ban lacks strong interactive effects with a corn\nsubsidy, and so they should be justified separately.\n\nGaus\u2019s case for fine-grained \u201cindividuation\u201d of\nproposals involves two arguments. We must justify at a level narrow\nenough to identify which forms of behavior are permitted or not. But\nwe must justify at a level wide enough to see rules as governing\nclasses of behavior (Gaus 2011, 122\u2013125). This entry\u2019s\nformulation of the PJP focuses on law \\(L\\) for brevity, and it\nacknowledges that public justification theorists work with other\nobjects of justification.\n2.3 Types of Justificatory Reason\n\nA chief disagreement among public justification theorists concerns the\nnature of justificatory reasons. Variable \\(R_i\\) in the PJP\nrepresents the contrast. The mainstream view within public reason\ncircles is that justificatory reasons are shared. More accurately,\nmembers of the public can share all justificatory reasons. The reasons\nare shareable. (Or, at least, be \u201caccessible\u201d in a sense\noutlined below (see 2.3.2)). On these \u201cconsensus\u201d views,\n\\(R_i\\) is the same for each individual \\(i\\).\n\u201cConvergence\u201d views allow \\(R_i\\) to differ between\nmembers of the public. John may have his reason \\(R_1\\), whereas Reba\nmay have her \\(R_2\\). Citizens can see the reasons as justified\naccording to reasonable evaluative standards. But they need not adopt\nthose standards themselves. So, on a convergence view, a private\nreligious reason can be justificatory. One person\u2019s reasons can\ndiffer from another. Each has reasons, but these reasons aren\u2019t\nthe same in the two cases. (See D\u2019Agostino 1996, 30) Again,\nreligious reasons may form some of those reasons.\n\nThe idea of people having different reasons may seem odd to some. But\nwe recognize convergence reasoning in various contexts. One concerns\nmarket transactions. Suppose \\(A\\) has apples and \\(B\\) has bananas.\n\\(A\\) wants some bananas, and \\(B\\) wants some apples. After a trade,\nboth have a mixture and regard themselves as better off. Here \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) exchanged for different reasons. And so, the arrangement has\na convergence justification. Each has a reason of their own to prefer\nit. And note that the point stands even if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) find one\nanother\u2019s reasons quite alien. Indeed, they might not even know\none another\u2019s reasons. But the arrangement still has a kind of\npublic justification.\n\nSo convergence only requires that individuals have their reasons\n\\(R_i\\), which creates set \\(\\{R_1, R_2 , \\ldots ,R_n\\}\\) to support\n\\(L\\). Consensus requires, in the limit, that all members of the\npublic share a (set of) reason(s) \\(R\\) to endorse \\(L\\).\n\nBut even convergence limits the range of justificatory reasons:\n\\(A\\)\u2019s reasons for endorsing \\(L\\) might be repugnant, perhaps\nenough to undermine \\(L\\)\u2019s public justification. For this\nreason, convergence theorists appeal to idealization (see 2.4\nbelow).\n\nAgain, the consensus approach remains dominant. Convergence is in the\nminority, both in earlier and contemporary works. (Gaus 1990, 256;\nStout 2004; Klosko 1993 vs Gaus 2011; Vallier 2014; Vallier 2019, Gaus\n2021).\n\nBut the public reason tradition provides grounds for both approaches.\nRawls seems to have combined the two approaches. Rawls looks like a\nconsensus theorist in the \u201cfreestanding\u201d stage of\npolitical justification. He (2005, 12) says that citizens should use\nshared reasons to converge on a political conception of justice. But\nin the \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d stage, Rawls leaves\njustification \u201cto each person.\u201d Each person must sync the\npolitical conception of justice with their comprehensive doctrine, and\nthe public adopts no single comprehensive doctrine. Rawls included\nboth accounts of justificatory reasons in his view, yet while the\ncombined view is attractive, many writers feel compelled to reject\nit.\n\nHabermas (1995) provides the most well-known illustration of the\ntension in Rawls. Gaus (2011) opts for overlapping\nconsensus/convergence justifications. Quong (2011) opts for\nfree-standing/consensus justifications. Vallier and Muldoon (2021)\nargue that these answers generate two public reason projects. Gaus\nfounded a \u201cdiversity project\u201d focused on how diverse\nreasoning resolves social conflicts. Quong founded a \u201ccoherence\nproject\u201d focused on rendering key political concepts\ncoherent.\n\nAs noted, even convergence theorists adopt restrictions on the set of\njustificatory reasons. Some discipline is implicit in the concept of\n\u201ca reason.\u201d A factual claim does not justify a principle\nif evidence falsifies the claim, and a normative claim is not a reason\nto endorse \\(L\\) if it lacks real normative force. So, we need to\narticulate some tests that count reasons as justificatory. The entry\norganizes them by increasing stringency: intelligibility,\naccessibility, and shareability.\n2.3.1 Intelligibility\n\nDefine intelligibility and the intelligibility requirement as\nfollows:\n\n\nIntelligibility: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is intelligible\nto members of the public if and only if members of the public regard\n\\(R_A\\) as justified for \\(A\\) according to \\(A\\)\u2019s evaluative\nstandards.\n\nIntelligibility Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law \\(L\\)\nonly if it is intelligible to all members of the public.\n\n\n\\(A\\)\u2019s intelligible reasons are those members can see as\nreasons for \\(A\\), who advances them. And members see \\(A\\)\u2019s\nreasons as reasons for \\(A\\) based on \\(A\\)\u2019s own evaluative\nstandards. Contrast these reasons with mere utterances, expressions of\nemotions, or irrational demands: intelligible reasons have rational\ngrounds.\n\nIntelligibility theorists (Vallier 2016b) argue that reasonable\npluralism applies to evaluative standards as it applies to reasons\n(Vallier 2011). Reasonable people can dispute standards of inference\nand epistemic justification. For instance, John may regard theological\nreasoning as intelligible. To illustrate, he points to the rational\nstructure of religious exegetical disputes. We may reject\nanother\u2019s sacred texts but think they furnish reasonable\nevaluative standards. Others may disagree: sacred texts are too\nindeterminate for adequate interpretation. Members may disagree about\nwhat counts as a good cognitive process.\n\nThe intelligibility requirement recognizes these differences in\nevaluative standards. But it still places pressure on a purely\nempirical approach. An empirical approach would count reasons as\njustificatory simply because people affirm them. But intelligibility\ndemands that our reasons for endorsing a principle meet rational\nstandards. Others must see the reason as one for the person who offers\nit, at least according to that person\u2019s standard.\n\nNot all intelligible reasons can figure into a justification for some\n\\(L\\). Some intelligible reasons are irrelevant; others only pertain\nto the benefits for oneself; still others may not be sufficient to\njustify a law, as specified in 2.1. Intelligibility is a requirement\nbeyond logical sufficiency to give reasons some epistemic credentials.\n\\(A\\)\u2019s intelligible reasons must be available to others to\nconsider at least as reasons for \\(A\\).\n2.3.2 Accessibility\n\nThe accessibility requirement is more stringent than intelligibility.\nIt does not mandate that a reason for \\(A\\) to accept \\(L\\) be\njustified according to \\(A\\)\u2019s reasonable standards. (Even if\nothers do not share these reasons). Instead, accessibility requires\nthat reasons be justified according to shared evaluative standards.\n(Members believe that \\(R_A\\) justifies \\(L\\) for \\(A\\) under common\nevaluative standards, and \\(A\\) accepts that \\(R_A\\) justifies \\(L\\).)\nAccessibility permits reasons to differ. \\((A\\) might endorse \\(R_A\\)\nand \\(B\\) might not). But it requires that they be evaluated as\nreasons according to shared evaluative standards. Thus, accessibility\nlies between intelligibility and shareability. (Which we consider\nnext, in section 2.4.3.) Intelligibility permits differing reasons and\nevaluative standards, whereas shareability permits neither.\nAccessibility is the most common standard, with at least eight\navailable interpretations. (Eberle 2002, 252\u2013286; for a recent\ndefense, see Boettcher 2015). Define accessibility and the\naccessibility requirement as follows:\n\n\nAccessibility: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is accessible to\nthe public if and only if all members of the public regard \\(R_A\\) as\njustified for \\(A\\) according to common evaluative standards\n\nAccessibility Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law only if\n\\(R_A\\) is accessible to all members of the public.\n\n2.3.3 Shareability\n\nShareability is the strongest of the three requirements. It combines\nshared evaluative standards with the shared reasons requirement\n(Bowman and Richardson 2009; Hartley and Watson 2009; Watson and\nHartley 2018). Public reason liberals often argue that justifying\nreasons are necessarily shared. But they say little about what it\nmeans to share reasons. Public reason liberals presumably hold that\nreasons must be shareable, in that citizens have the reasons\nat the right level of idealization.\n\nLike intelligibility and accessibility, the shareability requirement\nhas two components: a requirement on the appropriate evaluative\nstandards and a requirement on the range of permitted reasons. Define\nshareability and the shareability requirement as follows:\n\n\nShareability: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is shareable with\nthe public if and only if members of the public regard \\(R_A\\) as\njustified for each member of the public, including A, according to\ncommon standards.\n\nShareability Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) coercion only if\n\\(R_A\\) is shared with all (suitably idealized) members of the\npublic.\n\n\nShareability rules out convergence approaches to public justification,\nand citizens may only use shareable reasons in their public uses of\nreason. (One could argue that members of the public share any good\nreason at high levels of idealization, and here people may even share\ntheir comprehensive doctrines. This point bleeds into the matter of\nidealization, addressed below).\n2.3.4 A Diagram\n\nIntelligibility, Accessibility, and Shareability are the three core\nstandards of justificatory reasons in the public justification\nliterature. They can be grouped together in a diagram:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nUnshared Standards\nShared Standards  \n\n\nUnshared Reasons\nIntelligibility\nAccessibility \n\nShared Reasons\nX\nShareability  \n\n\nThe bottom left quadrant is open\u2014public reason liberals never\nadvocate shared reasons and unshared evaluative standards. There are\ntwo reasons for this. First, sharing evaluative standards is more\ncommon than sharing reasons. So if reasons are shared, evaluative\nstandards should be too. Second, evaluative standards help to\nindividuate and distinguish between reasons. So it\u2019s not clear\nwe could determine which reasons are shared if evaluative standards\nare not shared.\n2.4 Idealization\n\nOnce the outer bounds of the public are set (see\n Section 2.5\n below), and we know which individuals have to have reason(s) for some\narrangement to legitimize that arrangement, public reason liberals\nmust explain how to ascribe reasons to the members of this group.\nSpecifically, public reason liberals, unless they are empirical\nconsent theorists, engage in idealization to show how citizens\u2019\nbeliefs, desires, and values enter into the process of public\njustification. Idealization is the practice of considering\ncitizens\u2019 beliefs, desires, and values as if they possessed good\ninformation and good reasoning. It is typically employed because an\nindividual\u2019s morally significant reasons may not be the same as\nthe reasons she affirms. Her affirmed reasons might rest on poor\ninformation, poor reasoning, or incoherent beliefs and desires.\nJustificatory populism determines citizens\u2019 reasons by\ntheir actual commitments (Eberle 2002, 200).\n\nRawls\u2019s primary model of idealization (1971, 118) is the veil of\nignorance. It models parties as reasonable by withholding information\nthat would undermine the impartiality of their deliberations. (The\nveil device models reasonableness and the parties\u2019 veiled\nreasoning models rationality.) J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1999, 198)\nprefers deliberative conditions without abstract idealization. He\nconstrains the form of discourse to actual individuals. David Gauthier\n(1986, 245) prefers a bargaining scenario. Individuals know the\ncharacteristics of persons, but they do not know which person they\nare.\n\nIdealization alters citizens\u2019 belief-value sets. A\ncitizen\u2019s belief-value set is the set of all her beliefs,\ndesires, goals, and plans, i.e., everything she thinks and wants.\n(This idea derives from Bernard Williams\u2019s (1981, 102)\nconception of a subjective motivational set.) A citizen is idealized\nwhen we consider her belief-value set as it might be. Theorists change\none or more of her beliefs, desires, and goals according to some\ncriteria. They may imagine her having more or different information or\nvalues. Or they must insist on modeling her as fully rational. Both\nmodels alter her belief-value set. And the appropriate level of\nidealization might vary with context. Perhaps it depends on the\nepistemic quality of reasoning demanded by the situation. (Some\nreasoning aims to design institutions, whereas one might use other\nreasoning to plan a family vacation).\n\nTo motivate idealization, consider how public justification fares\nwithout it. Populist views \u201ctake citizens as they are: the\ndefault populist position is that a rationale \\(R\\) counts as a public\njustification only if the members of the public find \\(R\\) acceptable\nin light of their existing [subjective motivational sets],\nirrespective of their epistemic pockmarks and doxastic defects\u201d\n(Eberle 2002, 200). Populist conceptions of idealization have severe\nproblems.  People can \u201cwithhold their assent because of\nobstinacy, selfishness, laziness, perversity, or confusion\u201d\n(Gaus 1996, 121). Populism also problematically requires asking\neveryone about their reasons before deciding whether a coercive law is\njustified.\n2.4.1 Radical Idealization\n\nPublic justification theorists typically prefer radical idealization.\nThey do this to fix the weaknesses of justificatory populism and alter\nbelief-value sets to rid them of inconsistencies and ignorance.\nRadical idealization thus has two dimensions\u2014rationality and\ninformation\u2014pushed to their upper bound.\n2.4.1.1 Rationality\n\nThe distinction between full rationality and less-than-full\nrationality is central to idealization. Though, as we will see, full\nrationality is elusive. To attribute reasons to citizens based on poor\nreasoning corrupts public justification. A theory of full rationality\nidealizes agents by giving parties flawless cognitive powers. (See\nRawls (1971, 12) and Gauthier (1986, 234) for explicit attributions of\nfull rationality to their agents.)\n\nThe assumption of full rationality initially seems irresistible. If we\ncan discern the reasons citizens would affirm if perfectly rational,\nsurely these reasons would be morally relevant. The public reason\nliberal tries to justify demands and coercion to members of her\nsociety. How could she do better than full rationality? Another\nmotivation for embracing full rationality is to generate agreement.\nMany assume that suitably idealized individuals will agree on matters\nthey otherwise would not. Rawls ascribes full rationality to parties\nto the original position to induce agreement. Were they less than\nfully rational, the parties might reach different conclusions.\n\nBut problems with full rationality abound. First, the notion of full\nrationality may be incoherent when applied to finite and fallible\nbeings (see Cherniak 1986). It requires adjusting a dense web of\nbeliefs and values. And these beliefs and values are not computable in\nreal-time given limited resources. Second, full rationality will\nproduce justifications that individuals cannot reflectively endorse.\nIndividuals\u2019 actual beliefs and values differ significantly from\nthose which justify the arrangements. (This is one way in which the\nproblem of stability might arise. See below 5.2.)\n2.4.1.2 Information\n\nAgain, public reason liberals add information to the belief-value set\nof ordinary citizens. (And, indeed, remove misinformation.) They\nthereby avoid holding public justification captive to ignorance.\nRawls, Gauthier, and Habermas all pursue this strategy. Their models\nassume that idealized agents have all (and only) the facts that\ndetermine what reasons they have. Public reason liberals remove\nbeliefs and desires that stop individuals from adopting an impartial\nperspective. They add such general and specific information necessary\nfor the agent to reason well about the issues before her. Public\nreason liberals disagree about what sets of information interfere with\nimpartiality. But all theorists subtract misinformation and biasing\ninformation.\n\nInformational idealization ranges between complete information and\nadequate or relevant information. The motivations for embracing and\nrejecting full information resemble those for full rationality. A full\ninformation account is attractive because it attributes reasons to\ncitizens based on many true propositions and no false ones. Further,\ncomplete information might guarantee determinate recommendations, and\nif agents share relevant information, they will tend to converge on\nsimilar conclusions. Yet, complete information may model citizens in\nan implausibly abstract fashion, and it gives them powers that no\nfinite and fallible being has.\n2.4.2 Moderate Idealization\n\nPublic reason liberals take criticisms of radical idealization\nincreasingly seriously. (See Gaus 2011, 232\u2013260 and Vallier\n2014, 145\u2013180.) If these criticisms are successful, one might\nreconsider returning to justificatory populism. However, there may be\na third option: moderate idealization. Moderate idealization assigns\nreasons based on some standard of adequate information and reasoning.\nYet it falls short of full information and perfect reasoning. The\nmoderate idealization theorist argues that we can go too far in\nseparating idealized belief-value sets from citizens\u2019 dingy,\nreal-world belief-value sets. We will eventually sever the tie between\nthem. And, as Wolterstorff insists (2007, 153), the idealized person\nmay have no reason to care about his counterpart\u2019s\nrecommendations. (Also see Enoch 2013, 164\u2013170; for a reply, see\nGaus 2015). The pull toward radical idealization must balance\nrespecting citizens as they are. (This latter element will be crucial\nfor maintaining stability; see 5.2.) Radical idealization may test the\n\u201cstrains of commitment\u201d (Rawls 1971, 155\u20139) in\ndemanding that citizens cognitively struggle to see what reasons they\nhave. But moderate idealization may prove acceptable to most ordinary\ncitizens. Moderate idealization is an appropriate acknowledgment of\nthe demands of the impartial perspective.\n2.4.3 Reasonableness\n\nIdealization limits the set of reasons that figure into public\njustification. \u201cNormative\u201d idealizations that represent\nthe public as reasonable do likewise. In one way, reasonableness may\nseem to be a redundant category. Rawls, Gauthier, and Habermas\nrepresent citizens as reasonable by depriving them of partializing\ninformation. But reasonableness is not redundant. It attributes\ncognitive dispositions to agents uncaptured by idealizing beliefs,\ndesires, and values.\n\nRawls\u2019s conception of the reasonable plays two roles in his\ntheory of justice. First, the veil of ignorance models reasonableness.\nBut a citizen of the well-ordered society is also reasonable because\nshe possesses the following four dispositions (Rawls 2005,\n49\u201352, 53\u201358, 60, 76, 119, 162\u20133, 229). (1) A\ndisposition to engage in public justification or to offer\njustifications for her own preferred principles and abide by the\njustified principles proposed by others. (2) A disposition to\nrecognize the \u201cburdens of judgment\u201d implies reasonable\npluralism. (3) A disposition to reject the repression of other\nreasonable points of view. (4) A disposition to rely on methods of\nreasoning that others can share or access.\n\nPublic reason liberals share something like the standard conception of\nreasonableness. But idealizing members of the public as reasonable\nruns into two problems. First, such idealization risks ruling too many\ncitizens out of the justificatory public. Second, representing the\npublic as reasonable might forestall justifying coercive social\narrangements in a way that helps them to approximate a voluntary\nagreement (Nagel 1987).\n2.5 Scope of the Public\n\nThe scope of the public determines who to idealize. Public\njustification theorists typically identify the public with members of\na traditional nation-state. Theorists do this to simplify, but also\ndue to an implicit nationalism. Rawls confined his theory of justice\nto members of a nation, though he later developed an account of public\njustification for global matters (2002). This matter is left to\ndebates about nationalism and cosmopolitanism (see the entries on\n nationalism\n and\n cosmopolitanism).\n\nPublic reason liberals tend to leave future generations out of the\npublic (though see the entry on\n intergenerational justice).\n Some theorists, like Gauthier, confine public justification to\npersons capable of cooperation. But most theorists apply public\njustification to all citizens.\n2.6 Modalities of Public Justification\n\nThe PJP can also specify which social processes establish public\njustification. We can sort social processes into four types:\ndiscursive, universalizing, bargaining, and evolutionary. Discursive\nviews identify public justification with an agreement reached between\npublic discussants. Universalizing approaches identify public\njustification with fair and reciprocal principles. Bargaining\napproaches identify publicly justified principles as those that\nmaximally advance individual interests. Evolutionary approaches are\nthe most distinctive. They distinguish sharply between public reason\nand public justification. In their view, a coercive principle \\(L\\) is\npublicly justified when it is a stable, evolved public equilibrium. No\nprocess of public reasoning needs to take place. These four theories\neach have a prominent representative. In order they are J\u00fcrgen\nHabermas, John Rawls, David Gauthier and Gerald Gaus.\n2.6.1 Discursive\n\nDiscursive theories understand public justification as generating\nagreement among disputants through a process of real discourse under\njust and fair social institutions. Such views divide into Habermasian\nand pragmatist theories (Talisse 2005; Misak 2000). We can outline the\ndiscursive view by reviewing Habermas\u2019s account (see the entry\non\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas).\n\nHabermas holds (1999, 68) that \u201cthe justification of norms and\ncommands requires that a real discourse be carried out.\u201d The\nonly way to achieve public justification is through free\nargumentation. Such argumentation convinces citizens to recognize the\nclaims others make on them. For \\(A\\) to make a legitimate claim on\n\\(B\\), \\(A\\) must submit his claim to \\(B\\)\u2019s critique. The\ndiscursive process forms each individual\u2019s conception of her\ninterests and commitments. Habermas calls this process \u201cwill\nformation.\u201d Personal opinions can change and then produce a\nrational consensus. Habermas idealizes in this way to define a\nconception of the reasonable. Citizens take a discursive, moral point\nof view. Their goal is to reach a rational consensus about the\ninterests of the public. (For details about how idealized discourse\nproceeds, see Habermas 1999, 65\u20136.)\n2.6.2 Universalizing\n\nUniversalizing views try to identify a regime that fairly advances\neveryone\u2019s interests in accord with how individuals understand\nthose interests. Rawls exemplifies this view: a theory of justice\njustifies claims that citizens make on one another\u2019s conduct\nfrom our perspectives. Given how much people disagree, Rawls knows\nthat gaining traction on justification is complex, and he responds by\nconverting it into a problem of social choice. Rawls: \u201cthe\nquestion of justification [can be] settled by working out a problem of\ndeliberation\u201d (Rawls 1971, 16). Principles of justice are\npublicly justified when parties to a proper choice situation select\nthem.\n2.6.3 Bargaining\n\nBargaining views call a regime legitimate for an individual when it\nmaximally advances her interests. Bargaining suggests a negotiation\nthat yields a stable equilibrium of opposing forces: each person\nachieves as much as she can, consistent with the needs of others. The\nmost prominent example of a bargaining theory is David\nGauthier\u2019s contractarianism. Gauthier argues that citizens need\na social morality to secure social cooperation. We identify moral and\npolitical norms as justified when it is instrumentally rational for\neach agent to accept them.\n\nIndividuals \u201cfaced with the costs of natural or market\ninteraction in the face of externalities agree to a different,\ncooperative mode of interaction.\u201d Rational individuals do so to\n\u201cmaximize their own utility\u201d (Gauthier 1986, 145\u20136).\nThe goal is to show why anyone should accept moral restraints on their\nbehavior. Gauthier proposes that even instrumental rationality can\njustify ethical constraints to all. A citizen can be subject to state\ncoercion in certain respects because it is in his interests. Gauthier\ndoes not base public justification on the total utility it produces.\nParties strike bargains where each person provides the minimum\nrelative concession of rents. Publicly justified rules maximize each\nperson\u2019s share, but joint maximization constrains each\nperson\u2019s claim. Each side seeks the best bargain they can\nget.\n\nIn recent years, both Michael Moehler (2018) and Peter Vanderschraaf\n(2018) have revived bargaining approaches to public justification.\nMoehler develops a \u201ctwo level\u201d theory of practical\nrationality for social contract theory. Bargaining reasoning is the\nfallback position when more moralized contracting fails.\nVanderschraaf\u2019s book, Strategic Justice, takes the\nbargaining approach to its highest level of sophistication.\n2.6.4 Evolutionary\n\nEvolutionary views are, again, the newest approach. The approach\narguably originates in Bryan Skyrms (1996). But Gerald Gaus (2011) is\ntoday the most well-known proponent of such a view. Evolutionary views\nare new because they react to perceived failures of other approaches.\nGaus, for instance, rejects bargaining views, claiming that parties to\npublic justification must be intrinsic rule-followers. We can follow\nrules that frustrate our goals. Gaus argues that agents who follow\nmoral rules for instrumental reasons cannot sustain cooperation\nbecause its members still have reason to defect when others cooperate.\nMoral agency, he concludes, must allow us to decline to maximize the\nsatisfaction of our goals.\n\nFor Gaus, then, parties will not accept every instrumentally rational\nbargain. They also know that public discourse will not resolve their\ndisagreements. And a universalizing approach will yield multiple\neligible social arrangements; universalizing strategies are\nindeterminate. Gaus appeals to social evolution to produce convergence\non an eligible understanding, which would otherwise be indeterminate.\nWhen society reaches an undefeated agreement, it achieves public\njustification. Each party sees no other way to secure social\ncooperation. Public reason combines with a sociological thesis:\nspontaneous order processes can converge on norms. No one foresees or\nconstructs the justified principle or rule. But all have reason to\naccept the outcome of such a process.\n\nEvolutionary views draw on \u201cadaptive\u201d rationality,\ncontrasted with \u201ccalculated\u201d rationality (March 1978). An\nagent is rational when she adapts effectively to her environment, so\nher rationality does not depend on how she adapts, only that she\nadapts well. Calculated rationality occurs when one adapts through\ndeliberative decision-making. Many theorists assume the PJP is a\nprinciple of calculative reason. But evolutionary theorists reject\nthis claim. \\(L\\) is publicly justified for \\(P\\) if each member has\nsufficient reason to endorse \\(L\\). Full stop. Public justification\nobtains even if justificatory reasons differ. It even obtains when\nthese reasons are the consequence of an equilibrium process. The\nreasons need not derive from explicit deliberation.\n\nGaus continued the evolutionary project up to The Open Society and\nIts Complexities (Gaus 2021). The book draws complexity economics\nand agent-based modeling to determine when and in what circumstances a\ndiverse population will converge on common rules. Here Gaus draws on\nRyan Muldoon (2019), who introduced agent-based modeling into social\ncontract theory. Muldoon uses his theory to challenge consensus views\nof public reason.\n2.7 Coercion Alone?\n\nTypically public justification addresses the permissibility of\npolitical coercion. Coercion might apply to constitutional essentials\nand basic justice (Rawls 2005). Or it applies to coercive law as well\n(Quong 2011). Yet some theorists extend public justification beyond\ncoercion. Gaus (2011) and Chad Van Schoelandt (2015) argue that public\njustification evaluates relations of moral authority. We publicly\njustify our practice of making moral demands of others, even if the\nrules we demand others follow are not coercive. Colin Bird (2014)\ngrounds public justification in the standing of democratic citizens as\nco-authors of legislation. In Bird\u2019s view, we must justify\nnon-coercive legislation that affects the status of citizens. An\nexample might be communicative legislation that defines an optionally\nsworn national pledge of allegiance. Some public reason theorists\nbroaden the idea of coercion to cover structural coercion (Boettcher\n2016, Wong 2020).\n3. The Liberty Principle\n\nThe PJP only explains how to justify coercion (or some related form of\ndemand). It includes no other moral principle that describes why\ncoercion is problematic. Nor does it explain how to handle unjustified\ncoercion. So, one might combine the PJP with a consequentialist norm.\nUnjustified coercion, on this view, merits minimization. Or we could\nadopt a deontological side constraint on using unjustified coercion.\nAgain, on this matter, the PJP is silent.\n\nAnd yet, many public justification theorists, with other liberals,\nadopt such a principle. Some theorists call it the Liberty Principle.\nIt takes the form of a presumption in favor of liberty or against\ncoercion. Stanley Benn (1988, 87) defends such a presumption. Benn:\n\u201cthe burden of justification falls on the interferer, not on the\nperson interfered with.\u201d\n\nJoel Feinberg (1987, 9) also defends a \u201cpresumption in favor of\nliberty.\u201d Defined: \u201cliberty should be the norm, coercion\nalways needs some special justification.\u201d While Benn worries\nabout interference, and Feinberg about coercion, their presumptions\nare similar. Rawls (2001, 44) endorses a presumption against legal\ncoercion, which also appears in his liberal principle of legitimacy.\nRawls: \u201cOur exercise of political power is proper only when we\nsincerely believe that the reasons we offer for our political action\nmay reasonably be accepted by other citizens as a justification of\nthose actions\u201d (Rawls 2005, xlvi). Rawls does not speak of\ncoercion in this formulation. Yet he elsewhere claims that\n\u201cpolitical power is always coercive power\u201d (68). Further,\npublic justification should explain when citizens may coerce another\n(217). We can naturally read Rawls, then, as endorsing the Liberty\nPrinciple. Gaus (2011) probably provides the most extensive defense of\nthe liberty principle to date (though see Vallier 2019).\n\nWe can conjoin the PJP with the Liberty Principle. Together, they\nexplain how to use the PJP to evaluate laws. When satisfied, the PJP\nlegitimizes coercion, overcoming the presumption in favor of\nliberty.\n4. Foundations of the Public Justification Principle\n\nNow we inquire into the foundations of the PJP. Why should anyone\naccept it? The set of proposed normative foundations has increased\nwith time. Classically, public justification rests on respect for\npersons as free and equal. (See Larmore 2008; for criticism, see\nEberle 2002, Gaus 2011 and Van Schoelandt 2015). Others ground the PJP\nin an analysis of the nature of rationality and morality (Habermas\n1996). One dominant view bases the PJP on requirements of justice\n(Rawls 2005: Quong 2013). Some draw on the value of civic friendship.\n(See Lister 2013, Ebels-Duggan 2010, Leland and van Wietmarschen 2017,\nvan Wietmarschen 2021, Neufeld 2022. For criticism, see Billingham\n2016.) Gaus adopts a PJP because he argues that publicly justified\nrules avoid authoritarianism and fit with the reactive attitudes (for\ncriticism, see Tahzib 2019, Taylor 2018). At a deeper moral level,\nthese rules preserve moral relations between persons. (Gaus 2011,\nVallier 2022. For criticism, see Enoch 2013 and Enoch 2015.)\n\nWatson and Hartley (2018) rest public justification on respect for\npersons and reciprocity. Vallier (2019, 2020) grounds a PJP in the\nvalue of social trust or trust between members of society (though see\nTahzib 2021). Neo-Hobbesian views have seen a revival in the work of\nMoehler (2018) and Vanderschraaf (2018); they have much more developed\ntheories of instrumental rationality as a basis for public\njustification.\n\nFor space purposes, I omit a discussion of these foundations, as it\nwould only recapitulate the argument found in the entry on\n public reason.\n\nA related foundational question asks who merits a public justification\nin the first place (this question relates to the question of the scope\nof public justification, but is logically prior to it). Quong (2011,\n137\u2013160) applies public justification to an idealized\nconstituency of reasonable people. Gaus (2011, 232\u2013268) directs\npublic justification to actual persons; their justifying reasons are\nthose that survive moderate idealization. Quong calls his view the\n\u201cinternal conception\u201d of political liberalism. He\ncontrasts it with the \u201cexternal conception.\u201d The external\nconception directs public justification to natural persons as they\nare. But few public reason liberals adopt the external view. The\nGausian model appeals to a limited idealization, not none. The\ninternal conception has been subject to several criticisms. (Gaus\n2012, Billingham 2017a, Vallier 2017). But theorists also criticize\nthe Gausian approach (Enoch 2013, Quong 2014).\n\nDeciding who merits a public justification requires explaining its\npoint. For Quong and others, public justification renders consistent\nour fundamental political ideals. Examples include the idea of society\nas a system of cooperation and persons as free and equal. For Gaus,\npublic justification establishes moral relations between natural\npersons (Gaus 2011). These relations are ones of equal respect. But\nthey also lay the foundation for closer ties of trust, love, and\nfriendship.\n\nThe internal/external conception contrast no longer serves to classify\npublic reason liberals. Vallier and Muldoon (2021) have argued that\npublic reason has split into two projects. The first project, which\nthey call the coherence project, characterizes the internal\nconception; it involves rendering our political ideals consistent. The\nproject contrasts with the diversity project; diversity\ntheorists use diverse reasoning to achieve real-world public\njustification. Vallier and Muldoon (2021) set the external conception\naside.\n\nThe original project, advanced by Rawls and traditional\nRawlsians, continues (Weithman 2011). But the coherence and diversity\nprojects arose from a shared worry about it. Rawls uses both consensus\nand convergence reasoning in legitimizing state coercion. We first\njustify a conception of justice based on shared values, and we then\nsee if it can become the object of an overlapping consensus. Coherence\ntheorists say the first stage is critical, while the second stage is\nconfusing. But diversity theorists say the second stage is necessary\nas a heuristic for finding points of convergence. Original project\ntheorists refuse to choose between these two justificatory stages.\n\nFor the most recent work in the coherence project, see Neufeld 2022.\nFor the most recent work in the diversity project, see Gaus 2021.\nGaus\u2019s work has pushed public reason so far in a diversity\ndirection that in some ways it is no longer a form of social contract\ntheory (Gaus 2018). Gaus now models the choice of principles as a\nsocially interdependent choice process, and not a single agreement.\nGaus even began developing a research program based on these insights\ncalled the New Diversity Theory (Gaus 2018b).\n5. Sister Concepts\n\nThe PJP ties itself to two essential concepts: publicity and\nstability. A law that achieves stability and publicity may thereby\ncount as publicly justified. In other cases, theorists see reaching\npublicity and stability as theoretical merits\u2014considerations\nthat favor their approach to public justification over others. If a\nversion of the PJP conflicts with publicity, that could refute the\nspecification. Other factors can count against this specification of\nthe PJP. But publicity and stability are central to public\njustification, so we explore connections.\n5.1 Publicity\n\nFor Rawls, \u201cpublic justification\u201d occurs when a\nwell-ordered society achieves \u201cfull publicity.\u201d Full\npublicity contains three levels (see the entry on\n publicity).\n The first level occurs when public principles of justice effectively\nregulate society. Rawls (2005, 66): \u201ccitizens accept and know\nthat others likewise accept those principles, and this in turn is\npublicly recognized.\u201d Each person sees society\u2019s basic\nstructure as justified by shared reasoning.\n\nThe second level requires that citizens of a well-ordered society have\nshared beliefs. In particular, they believe that all can accept the\nfirst principles of justice. Their evaluations draw on \u201cgeneral\nbeliefs about human nature\u201d and how institutions work (67).\n\nLevel three establishes \u201cthe full justification of the public\nconception of justice as it would be presented in its own\nterms.\u201d It must include all considerations relevant to\ngenerating a conception of justice. Then the full justification\nbecomes \u201cpublicly known\u201d or at least \u201cpublicly\navailable.\u201d\n\nFull publicity arises when all three levels of publicity occur. When a\nsociety reaches full publicity, its conception of justice becomes\npublicly justified. Yet this is so only given two conditions. The\nconception of justice must become a political conception. It must\nderive from shared and public political values. Second, it must reach\nan overlapping consensus. Full publicity comprises \u201cpublic\njustification,\u201d Rawls\u2019s third stage of justifying a\npolitical conception. It occurs when each person knows that the\npolitical conception is fully justified. (Rawls 2005, 386\u20137).\nFor Rawls, \u201cpublic justification happens when all the reasonable\nmembers of political society carry out a justification of the shared\npolitical conception by embedding it in their several reasonable\ncomprehensive views.\u201d Thus, public justification obtains via\npublicity.\n\nCharles Larmore (2008, 203\u20137) traces Rawls\u2019s idea of\npublic reason to concerns about publicity. Paul Weithman (2011, 242)\nstresses the centrality of publicity in Rawls. Publicity helps educate\nsociety about the basis of its political views. And it is crucial for\nmaintaining a community as stable for the right reasons.\n\nRawls\u2019s notion of publicity is the most common in the\nliterature, but Gaus (2011, 296\u20137) offers a less demanding\n\u201cweak\u201d publicity standard. Notice, then, that\nRawls\u2019s conception of publicity is quite demanding. The PJP does\nnot insist that public justifications achieve full publicity, and most\ntheorists say that people should be able to tell when laws or rules\nare publicly justified. Publicity is a \u201csister concept\u201d to\npublic justification when it helps to establish public\njustification.\n\nSome theorists define publicity as the publicity of shared reasons.\n(See Rawls 2002, 173.) They adopt a consensus approach to aid public\nrecognition that public justification occurs. (See Hadfield and Macedo\n2012; Watson and Hartley 2018.) And yet, consensus and convergence\nviews appeal to publicity. Both approaches want citizens to know when\nlaws or policies are justified for all. Convergence theorists may not\ndefine the PJP as including shared values, but they still find\npublicity attractive. This difference draws on the contrast between\nintelligibility and accessibility discussed above.\n\nPublicity remains a central topic in this literature, but has gone\nwithout major treatments until Kogelmann 2022.\n5.2 Stability\n\nStability is the other sister concept to public justification. Many\npublic reason liberals think publicly justified principles must be\nsomehow morally stable. Rawls (2005, 140\u20133) advances this line:\npublic justification helps political conceptions become \u201cstable\nfor the right reasons.\u201d\n\nWeithman (2011) argues that Rawls\u2019s changing ideal of stability\ndrove revisions to his theory. Rawls wanted his political principles\nto reach stability in a diverse society despite reasonable pluralism.\nIn some ways, concerns about stability are a reason to care about\npublic justification. A community may only reach moral stability, that\nis, stability for the right reasons if each person has moral reason to\nendorse society\u2019s coercive power. Otherwise, stability rests on\na balance of power alone\u2014a modus vivendi regime.\n\nSome theorists draw a looser connection between stability and public\njustification. Whether a principle can stabilize is a reason to prefer\nit over less stable principles. (Rawls sometimes talks this way in\nTheory.) Stability may also help vindicate a conception of\npublic justification over others. So, suppose that a convergence view\nhelps justify laws in ways that promote stability. If so, we may have\nreason to adopt a convergence over a consensus view.\n\nRawls\u2019s focus on stability raises another complex issue. The\npresent entry addressed idealizing persons as reasonable or not\n(2.4.3). Some idealizations attribute reasons to citizens based on\nwhat they would reasonably endorse. Stability is also sometimes\nmoralized. It is valuable only when based on \u201cthe right\nreasons.\u201d Rawls resists merely prescriptive stability, however.\nHe does not want to stabilize a society based only on what ought to\nmake it stable. Instead, stability has content apart from its basis in\nmoral reasons. A community can be unstable even if its institutions\nrest on reasonable grounds. Stability has an ethical ideal and a\ndescriptive ideal of real stability. Public justification then can\nhave both moral and descriptive parts. Publicly justified rules are\nboth real and justified. Gaus has criticized Rawls (1996, 130\u20136)\nfor his populist conception of stability. He has developed an\nalternative (2011, 389\u2013408). So, many public justification\ntheorists feel the pull of descriptive and moral stability. But some,\nlike Quong (2011), adopt a purely normative notion.\n\nFollowing Weithman (2011), philosophers now explore stabilization\nmechanisms. Weithman argues that public reasons create stability for\nthe right reasons and that this was Rawls\u2019s view.\n\nVallier and John Thrasher (2015) think public reasons are poor\nassurance signals. They raise problems associated with cheap talk and\nmisinformation. These factors may be present even in well-ordered\nsocieties. Kogelmann and Steven H. W. Stich (2016) embrace convergence\ndiscourse for stability. Convergence allows people to use diverse\nreasons as costly signals of cooperative inclinations. It takes a\ngreat deal of effort to speak the political languages of various\ngroups. The use of diverse discourse can thus create stability. This\nliterature continues to bear fruit.\n6. Objections\n\nThis entry as a whole explains the ideal of public justification, so\nit does not explore objections to public justification in detail.\nInstead, it offers a comprehensive list of criticisms. Some items in\nthe list draw on a shorter list constructed by Jonathan Quong (2011,\n259\u201360). In general, the objections aim at particular\nconceptions of public justification, but unless specified, assume that\ncritics direct their complaints against all versions of public\njustification discussed.\n6.1 The Incompleteness Objection\n\nMany critics of public justification claim it cannot address critical\npolitical issues. This problem arises from restrictions on permissible\nreasoning in public life. (De Marneffe 1994, Reidy 2000; Schwartzman\n2004). Critics here object to consensus views, which restrict the set\nof justifying reasons. Citizens may not have shared reasons and\ninstead appeal to personal considerations, so the convergence view\nmakes this objection less pressing.\n6.2 The Indeterminacy Objection\n\nCritics have argued that public reason liberals embrace excessively\nindeterminate conceptions of justice. The ideal of public\njustification cannot make determinate recommendations. Gaus (2011)\npresses this objection against Rawlsian conceptions of public\njustification, resolving indeterminacy by appealing to actual\nevolutionary mechanisms (see 2.7.4). This \u201cnormalization\u201d\nobjection rejects attempts to avoid indeterminacy by adopting\nhomogenizing assumptions. (D\u2019Agostino 2003)\n6.3 The Antidemocratic Objection\n\nDeliberative democrats have complained that Rawls identifies justice\napart from real deliberation. Habermas famously (1995, 127\u20138)\nlodged this criticism against Rawls. This objection targets Rawlsian\nuniversalizing public justification.\n6.4 The Integrity Objection\n\nSome say public justification imposes excessive burdens on people of\nfaith. By barring unshared reasons, it excludes religious reasons from\npublic discourse. Critics say people of faith have no reason to accept\nthose constraints. (Eberle 2002, Wolterstorff 1997, Vallier 2014). The\nconstraints, if followed, would divide the identity of religious\npeople, and the person of faith\u2019s identity may disintegrate.\n\nThe integrity objection relates to a fairness objection. This\nobjection claims that public justification prioritizes secular over\nreligious reasons, arbitrarily preferring secular citizens. (Perry\n1993, Wolterstorff 1997). Note that convergence undermines these\nobjections as it allows appeals to religious reasons. (Eberle 2012).\nThe integrity objection also relates to the Denial of Truth objection\n(Neal 2009). Neal thinks citizens who abide by public justification\ncannot appeal to the truth as they see it. Andrew March (2013)\nprovides a taxonomy of religion-based criticisms of public reason. He\nargues that some restrictions can burden us too much. But other\nconditions are justified.\n6.4.1 The Antidiscourse Objection\n\nPublic justification might also support unrealistic views of\ndemocratic politics because real politics uses personal reasons to\nbuild coalitions and forge compromises (Shapiro 1999). This objection\nfocuses on the burdensomeness of public reason, but it also concerns\nwhether public reason is realistic. Note that the antidiscourse\nobjection threatens discursive views of public justification.\n6.4.2 The Marginalization Objection\n\nSome critics argue that public justification privileges logical, calm,\ndispassionate forms of discourse. There may be minority groups that do\nnot find such speech rules satisfactory. (It is a matter of\ncontroversy who these minority groups are.) The objection mirrors the\nintegrity objection, but they apply to different social groups.\n(Sanders 1997, Young 2000). These critics oppose Rawlsian\ninterpretations of the PJP.\n6.5 The Unreasonableness Objection\n\nPublic reason liberals often say many citizens are unreasonable, but\nthis claim meets powerful resistance due to its ambiguity. Others\nobject because uses of the reasonable privilege some over others, so\nthe standard is inegalitarian. (Bohman 2003, Friedman 2000). This\nobjection focuses on Rawlsian interpretations of PJP.\n6.6 The Asymmetry Objection\n\nPublic reason liberals argue that reasonable people will disagree\nabout the human good. But they also claim that reasonable people will\nagree on conceptions of justice. Some critics say these claims are\nproblematic because they are asymmetric. The same factors that drive\nreasonable pluralism about the good apply to justice, hence the\nasymmetry. (For discussion and rebuttal, see Quong 2011,\n192\u2013220.) This objection applies to a wide range of\ninterpretations of the PJP. But convergence theorists often accept\njustice pluralism. (Gaus 2011, 276\u20139; Gaus and Van Schoelandt\n2017, Vallier 2019, Gjesdal 2022).\n6.7 The Self-Refutation Objection\n\nThe PJP holds that all coercive actions or laws require justification\nfor each member of the public. But critics ask whether this treatment\napplies to the PJP itself. If so, then given that reasonable people\ndisagree about the PJP, the PJP is self-refuting. But suppose the PJP\nneeds no public justification; if so, its defenders make an arbitrary\nexception for their moral principle. (Wall 2002; Christiano 2010,\n206\u2013213; Estlund 2008; Wall 2013; Enoch 2013,\n170\u2013173).\n\nSome respond by arguing that their version of the PJP can satisfy\nitself (Estlund 2008). Other public reason liberals exclude the PJP\nfrom public justification, but they then argue that the exclusion is\nnot arbitrary. (Gaus 2011; Vallier 2016a; Bajaj 2017. This objection\napplies to any interpretation of the PJP. For a more recent\ndiscussion, see Billingham 2017b.)\n6.8 The Perfectionism Objection\n\nLiberal perfectionists claim that the state should promote the\nauthentic human good. They reject public justification for preventing\ngovernments from promoting that good. And they reject the ideas of\n\u201cneutrality\u201d and \u201crestraint\u201d that justify the\nPJP. (Wall 1998, Chan 2000.) For some prominent replies, see Quong\n2011. Perfectionists reject the PJP itself, not merely some\ninterpretations of it.\n6.9 The Empty Set Objection\n\nThe most powerful objection to the PJP is that it allows too many\nreasons to defeat proposed laws. The objection applies to various\ninterpretations of the PJP. But critics direct it most often at the\nconvergence views. (Eberle 2012; Enoch 2015, though see Schultz-Bergin\n2021) By allowing diverse defeaters into public justification, few\nproposals reach public justification. Few states can engage in their\nmost basic functions. Some public reason liberals admit that public\njustification is often beyond us. (Rawls 2005, D\u2019Agostino 2006).\nWe may need some degree of social development to establish a publicly\njustified polity. (Rawls 2005).\n\nGaus offers the most prominent response. The benefits of shared norms\ncan populate an otherwise empty set of proposals. The idea here is\nthat we all rank some rules ahead of no rule governing some issue.\nWhile we regard some rules as sub-optimal, they improve our relations\nwith others. This reply is a sociological response: people prefer\nsub-optimal ethical rules to no rules because empty sets are\ndebilitating. Both Rawls and Gaus provide such arguments. (Rawls 2002,\n124\u2013128, Gaus 2011, 303\u2013333, 389\u2013408,\n424\u2013447).\n\nIn short, each person may have a defeater for another\u2019s\npreferred moral rule. But most members of the public prefer some\nethical governance to none, and in that case, they may deem some moral\nrules acceptable but not optimal.\n6.10 The Insincerity Objection\n\nThis objection threatens convergence views. Quong thinks permitting\npersonal reasons allows citizens to be insincere with one another.\nConvergence citizens can offer others reasons they do not believe are\ngood reasons. (Quong 2011). This objection does not address the\ndistinction between shared reasons and standards. We are not insincere\nif we offer others reasons that follow our modes of inquiry but end up\nin a different place. If we share a scientific method, yet end up with\ndifferent theories, we may have varied reasons. But sharing diverse\nreasons is not insincere when our shared background is common\nknowledge.\n\nQuong\u2019s consensus constraints also appear to bar reasoning by\nconjecture. (Rawls 2002, Schwartzman 2012). Conjectural reasoning\nallows persons to appeal to the reasons of other comprehensive\ndoctrines. But both parties are aware of the nature of such appeals.\nThat said, sincerity requirements may still have an essential role in\npublic reason. (Schwartzman 2011)\n6.11 Theoretical Indeterminacy\n\nFred D\u2019Agostino (1996) argues that the PJP admits many variants.\n(We characterize the variants through values in the PJP.) We have\nreasons to favor a range of interpretations of the PJP. For example,\npublic justification appeals to idealization. But we have grounds to\nidealize radically, moderately, or not at all. (Macedo 1990 makes\nthese points.) Unfortunately, the case for idealizing, but not\nidealizing too much, is complicated and involves conflicting\ndesiderata. True, conflicting desiderata are common in any theoretical\ndomain. Still, D\u2019Agostino worries that conceptions of public\njustification arise from incompatible motivations, and theorists lack\nconceptual resources to weigh these considerations against one\nanother. In his final book, Gaus (2021) argues that even his earlier\nevolutionary model of public reason (Gaus 2011) would not lead to\nconvergence on rules in many cases; but with diverse agents in a free\nand interactive model of rule choice can converge on rules more\noften.\n6.12 Concerns about Idealization\n\nPublic reason liberals, again, feel intense pressure to idealize. But\nsome critics think idealization is always arbitrary.\n\nEberle (2002) claims idealizations reflect the biases and values of\ntheorists, which is why largely secular public reason liberals\nsuppress religious reasons. So, any version of the PJP that appeals to\nidealization is subject to this objection.\n\nDavid Enoch (2013) rejects Gaus\u2019s moderate idealization. Contra\nGaus, such idealization does not show that social-moral rules reduce\nauthoritarianism. Nicholas Wolterstorff (2007) argues that coercing\nsomeone based on an idealization is patronizing. Even disrespectful.\nFor recent papers on idealization, see Besch 2019, Donahue 2021,\nVallier 2020b.\n\nIn light of these objections, Fabian Wendt (2019) has tried to\nseparate public justification from public reason liberals. He hopes to\ncapture what is attractive about public justification while separating\nit from problems with public reason in liberal political thought.\n6.13 New Objections to Convergence\n\nIn recent years, consensus theorists have pushed back against\nconvergence views in detail. While these arguments are all unique,\nthey are worth noting as a general phenomenon. See Badano and Bonotti\n2020, Boettcher 2020, Tahzib 2021, Neufeld 2022. But the debate rages\non from convergence theorists; see Motchoulski 2020.\n7. Applied Issues\n\nTheorists often use public justification to address important applied\nquestions. Applied questions concern religion in liberal democracies,\nreligious exemptions, feminism, marriage policy, environmental issues,\nhealthy eating policies, and even public reason and Confucianism.\nApplied issues are the order of the day in much of the literature.\n\nOn the religion in politics literature, see the entry on\n religion and political theory.\n Also, see literature reviews in March 2013, Vallier 2014, and Bailey\nand Gentile 2014. While many public reason liberals have moved away\nfrom a restraint-based approach to religion in public life (Gaus and\nVallier 2009, Laborde 2017, newer work defends such principles (Watson\nand Hartley 2018). Some even focus public reason on discourse, setting\npublic justification aside (Leland 2019). Still other theorists have\nfocused on developing principles of restraint appropriate for managing\npartisanship and the conduct of political parties (Bonotti 2017).\n\nWe have seen the rapid expansion of the literature on public reason\nand religious exemptions, brought into clear focus in Cecile\nLaborde\u2019s (2017) work. (Also see Bespalov 2019.) Some of the\nexemption literature extends into medical exemptions. See McConnell\nand Card 2019.\n\nPublic reason and feminism discussions are now voluminous. (Okin 1994,\nRawls 2002, Nussbaum 2003, Baehr 2008, Hartley and Watson 2009,\nHartley and Watson 2010, Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014, and Watson\nand Hartley 2018).\n\nTo explore public justification and marriage policy, see Brake 2010,\nMacedo 2015, Chambers 2017, and Toop 2019.\n\nPublic reason methods have also been applied to environmental issues\n(Shahar forthcoming; Nielsen and Hauge-Helgestad 2021), as well as\nhealthy eating policy (Bonotti and Barnhill 2019).\n\nWe are also seeing the beginnings of a discussion about the\nintersection of public reason and the Confucian religion (Kim 2019;\nD\u2019Ambrosio 2019).\n\nWe have also seen the introduction of new formal methods into public\nreason, such as social choice theory (Kogelmann 2017, 2019; Chung\n2020), agent-based modeling (Muldoon 2019, Gaus 2021), and fixed-point\ntheorems (Schaefer 2022).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Badano, G. and M.
