    "main_text": "Main Debates || 0 Singularity\n3. Closing\n\nThe singularity thus raises the problem of the concept of AI again. It\nis remarkable how imagination or \u201cvision\u201d has played a\ncentral role since the very beginning of the discipline at the\n\u201cDartmouth Summer Research Project\u201d (McCarthy et al. 1955\n[OIR]; Simon and Newell 1958). And the evaluation of this vision is\nsubject to dramatic change: In a few decades, we went from the slogans\n\u201cAI is impossible\u201d (Dreyfus 1972) and \u201cAI is just\nautomation\u201d (Lighthill 1973) to \u201cAI will solve all\nproblems\u201d (Kurzweil 1999) and \u201cAI may kill us all\u201d\n(Bostrom 2014). This created media attention and public relations\nefforts, but it also raises the problem of how much of this\n\u201cphilosophy and ethics of AI\u201d is really about AI rather\nthan about an imagined technology. As we said at the outset, AI and\nrobotics have raised fundamental questions about what we should do\nwith these systems, what the systems themselves should do, and what\nrisks they have in the long term. They also challenge the human view\nof humanity as the intelligent and dominant species on Earth. We have\nseen issues that have been raised and will have to watch technological\nand social developments closely to catch the new issues early on,\ndevelop a philosophical analysis, and learn for traditional problems\nof philosophy.\n",
