    "main_text": "\n\nFrancisco Sanches (1551\u20131623) was an important figure in the\nhistory of philosophical scepticism, and most specifically in the\nlater sixteenth and early seventeenth century. Sanches gained\nnotoriety through his controversial text, That Nothing is\nKnown. His skeptical ideas concerning what could be known of the\nphenomenal world, influenced the work of other philosophers like\nRen\u00e9 Descartes. In fact, in the last twenty-five to thirty\nyears, his work has at last been acknowledged as having served as a\nbackground source of Descartes\u2019 refutation of scepticism.\nSanches was not only a philosopher; he was also a physician, and a\nprofessor of medicine \u2013 a fact that doubtlessly tempered his\nscepticism. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in\nSanches, as he has come to be seen as a significant philosopher in the\nhistory of scepticism, along with Montaigne, Descartes, and Hume. Some\ncontemporary thinkers have gone as far as comparing his notion of\nlanguage and metaphysics to that of someone like Wittgenstein.\n",
