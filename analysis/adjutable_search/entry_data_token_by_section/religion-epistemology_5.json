    "main_text": "Wittgensteinian Fideism\n6. Wittgensteinian Fideism\n\n\nAnother reaction to the problematic is Wittgensteinian fideism, the\nthesis that there are various different \u201clanguage games\u201d,\nand that while it is appropriate to ask questions about justification\nwithin a language game it is a mistake to ask about the justification\nof \u201cplaying\u201d the game in question. In this way\nepistemology is relativised to language games, themselves related to\nforms of life, and the one used for assessing religious claims is less\nstringent than evidentialism. Here there seems to be both an autonomy\nthesis and an incommensurability thesis. The autonomy thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are only to be judged as justified or\notherwise by the standards implicit in the religious form of life, and\nthis may be further restricted to Christianity or Hinduism, or any\nother religion (Malcolm 1992). The incommensurability thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are unlike scientific or metaphysical claims\nand so we are confusing different uses of language if we judge\nreligious utterances by the standards of science or metaphysics\n(Phillips 1992). Stress on the autonomy thesis brings Wittgensteinian\nfideism close to the fideism of many religious conservatives, but\nstress on the incommensurability thesis brings it close to the extreme\nliberal position of Braithwaite (1955), namely that religion is about\nattitudes not facts, which would, of course, be rejected by religious\nconservatives.\n\n\nPerhaps the most obvious criticism of Wittgensteinian fideism is that\neven if the underlying theory of forms of life and language games is\ngranted, it is an historical fact, itself justified by the criteria of\nthe \u201cgame\u201d of history, that the tradition to which the\nmajority of Jews, Christians and Muslims belong to is a form of life\nwith heavy metaphysical commitments, and in which such utterances as\n\u201cThere is a God\u201d are intended as much like \u201cThere is\na star ten times more massive than the Sun\u201d as like \u201cThere\nis hope\u201d. So Wittgensteinian fideism is only appropriate for\nsuch religions as Zen Buddhism and for some, relatively recent,\nliberal strands of Judaism and Christianity which have rejected the\ntraditional metaphysical commitment (as in Cupitt 1984).\n\nThe Wittgensteinian position could be modified to allow a metaphysical\n\u201clanguage game\u201d with its own criteria for justification\netc, and in which natural theology should be pursued. Then the\nJudeo-Christian-Islamic \u201clanguage game\u201d would be part of\nthis larger, autonomous metaphysical \u201clanguage game\u201d. That\nmodified account would cohere with the historical fact of the\nmetaphysical commitment of that religious tradition. In that case,\nthough, it would seem that, not just the Judeo-Christian-Islamic\n\u201clanguage game\u201d, but all serious intellectual enquiry\nshould also be treated as parts of the one \u201cgame\u201d, with\none set of rules. Thus Wittgensteinian fideism would have been\nqualified out of existence.\n\n\nEven if you reject Wittgensteinian fideism you might still take a lesson\nfrom it. For it must surely be granted that religious utterances are\nnot made in a purely intellectual way. Their entanglement with\ncommitment to a way of life and their emotional charge might help to\nexplain the fact, if it is one, that those who take religion\nseriously, whether believers or not, do not in fact have a continuous\nrange of degrees of confidence but operate instead with full belief or\nfull disbelief. For, normally, emotionally charged beliefs are either\nfull on or full off, and in abnormal cases tend to be divided rather\nthan partial. Thus, confronted with conflicting evidence about whether\nyour affection is reciprocated you are far less likely to suspend\njudgement than to oscillate between full belief and full\ndisbelief. Likewise it seems more normal to oscillate between full\nbelief in God in moments of crisis and full disbelief when things go\nwell than to suspend judgement at all times. This ties in with the\nNewmanian modification of evidentialism, mentioned above.\n",
