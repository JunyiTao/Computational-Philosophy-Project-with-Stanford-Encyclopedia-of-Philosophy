    "main_text": "Action and Freedom || Actions and Excuses\n4.2 Freedom and Ability\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to Austin\u2019s discussion of whether\ndeterminism is compatible with free action\n ((3) above).\n One general form of excuse for doing something would be that one\ncouldn\u2019t avoid doing it. Similarly, a general excuse\nfor failing to do something\u2014failing to apply one\u2019s brakes,\nfor example\u2014would be that one couldn\u2019t do it.\nExcuses of that general type have figured centrally in discussions of\nhuman freedom and the bearing of determinism on whether we ever act\nfreely. Suppose that, wherever an excuse of this form is correctly\napplicable, we are not responsible for the action targeted by the\nexcuse and did not act freely. If this supposition were correct, a\ndemonstration that there are no things that we do that we could have\navoided doing, and no things that we do not do that we could have\ndone, would amount to a demonstration that we are never responsible\nfor doing, or refraining from doing, what we do and, so, never act\nfreely. And some philosophers have held that determinism provides the\nbasis for such a demonstration.\n\nSuch a demonstration might take the following form. The all-in claim\nthat someone could have done something at t requires that the\ncircumstances at t are consistent with their doing that thing\nat t. But according to determinism, the circumstances,\nC, at t determine that one set of events,\nE, occurs at t rather than any others. That is,\naccording to the thesis of determinism, it couldn\u2019t be that\n(C & not-E). Now, given that what the individual\nin question in fact did at t (/refrained from doing at\nt) is a member of E, it couldn\u2019t have been\nthat C and yet they failed to do it (/failed to refrain from\ndoing it). Hence, because of C, it\u2019s not the case that\nthey could have avoided doing what they did (/refraining from doing\nit).\n\nAustin considers this issue in his \u201cIfs and Cans\u201d (1956a).\nThere, he discusses and rejects attempts in G.E. Moore 1912 and\nNowell-Smith 1954 to provide accounts of what we can do on which it\nbeing true that we can do things (/refrain from doing them) is\ncompatible with its being determined by our circumstances that we\ndon\u2019t in fact do them (/refrain from doing them). Austin thinks\nthat his objections to the accounts on which he focuses provide\npartial support to the view that our ordinary claims about what we can\ndo are incompatible with determinism.\n\nThe first proposal of Moore\u2019s that Austin considers is that the\nclaim that someone, S, can do something, A, is\nequivalent to the following claim: S will A, if\nS chooses to A. Austin argues that Moore\u2019s\nfirst proposal is based on a mistaken view about the functioning of\nthe claims of the form: \u201cS can A, if\nS\n chooses\u201d.[25]\n The second proposal of Moore\u2019s that Austin considers is the\nclaim that \u201cS can A\u201d is equivalent to a\nclaim of the form \u201cIf it were that C, then S\nwould B\u201d. For example, \u201cI could have holed the\nputt\u201d might be taken to be equivalent to \u201cIf I had tried\nto hole the putt, I would have succeeded in holing the putt.\u201d\nHere again, it seems that the proposal might be of service in\nsidestepping the challenge posed by determinism. Suppose that in\nactual circumstances C, I don\u2019t try to hole the putt.\nAccording to determinism, it follows that it is impossible that\n(C and I do try to hole the putt). But that is consistent\nboth with its being possible, in slightly different circumstances,\nthat I try to hole the putt, and with it being the case that, if I\nwere to try, I would succeed. Austin doesn\u2019t pursue the proposal\nin detail, though his discussion of Nowell-Smith pursues connected\nissues (219\u2013230). However, in a footnote, Austin presents an\nimportant putative counterexample:\n\n\nConsider the case where I miss a very short putt and kick myself\nbecause I could have holed it. It is not that I should have holed it\nif I had tried: I did try, and missed. It is not that I should have\nholed it if conditions had been different: that might of course be so,\nbut I am talking about conditions as they precisely were, and\nasserting that I could have holed it. There is the rub. (1956a: 218\nfn.1)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s thought here is that attributions of this sort manifest\nour belief that,\n\n\n\u2026a human ability or power or capacity is inherently liable not\nto produce success, on occasion, and that for no reason (or are bad\nluck and bad form sometimes reasons?). (218: 218 fn.1)\n\n\nNow a committed determinist would claim that the events that\nconstitute such failures must be determined\u2014and in that sense\nexplained\u2014by the circumstances at and before the failure. But\nAustin believes\u2014for reasons in effect considered\nabove\u2014that the existence of such an explanation would make it\nthe case that, in fact, the golfer could not have made the\nputt in the circumstances as they precisely were.\n\nWe have here, then, a point at which Austin expresses his view that\nordinary attributions of ability, power, and capacity are incompatible\nwith the thesis of determinism. In response, the compatibilist is\nforced, I think, to deny that its being true that a golfer could have\nholed the putt, or even that he could have holed the putt in precisely\nthe same conditions, entails that he would have holed the putt in a\nperfect duplicate of the actual world. Leaving that issue to\none side, Austin presents the proposed analysis with a case of\nmasking\u2014a case in which, although ability is retained,\nsuccessful exercise of the ability is somehow precluded, for instance\nby outside interference (for discussion of masking, see A. Bird 1998;\nClarke 2009; Fara 2008; and Johnston 1992). The challenge facing the\ndefender of the analysis is to spell out the analysis so as to cope\nwith masking. Arguably, meeting the challenge depends upon provision\nof a non-circular specification of all possible masks. Austin would, I\nthink, claim that it is impossible to meet the challenge. For on his\nview, abilities are sometimes masked brutely, without any\nspecifiable mask. Even if he is wrong about that, it remains an open\nquestion whether the challenge can be met, or whether the endless\nheterogeneity of potential masks makes it impossible to provide an\nexplanatory specification.\n\n(For discussion of Austin views about freedom and ability see Ayers\n1966; Clarke 2009; Kaufman 1963; Locke 1962; New 1966; Nowell-Smith\n1960; Pears 1973; Thalberg 1969; Warnock 1989: 80\u201397.)\n",
