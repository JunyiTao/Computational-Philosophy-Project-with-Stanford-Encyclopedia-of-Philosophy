Introduction\n\nIn Kant\u2019s famous dictum, \u201cAutonomy of the will is the\nproperty the will has of being a law unto itself (independently of\nevery property belonging to the objects of volition)\u201d (Kant\n1785, 108). Rational beings make the moral law for themselves and can\nregard themselves as authors of the law. Thus autonomy is manifested\nwhen rational agents \u201cwill\u201d the moral law. For Kant the\nmoral law is a categorical, not a hypothetical, imperative. The act of\nformulating a categorical imperative, and hence the moral law, is an\nact of a pure autonomous will, because, unlike the formulation of a\nhypothetical imperative, it is untainted by the influence of the\ndesires and interests that an agent may have relative to a particular\nsituation. (For a more detailed account, see the entry on\n\u201cKant\u2019s Account of Reason\u201d.) A contemporary parallel\nof Kant\u2019s conception of autonomy is John Rawls\u2019s\ninfluential notion of free and rational agents formulating principles\nof justice in the \u201coriginal position\u201d (Rawls 1971). Rawls\nargues that rational agents formulate principles of justice from\nbehind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, that is, from a position in\nwhich they are making decisions about how a society will function\nbefore they know who in this society they will turn out to be. For\nexample, in the original position, agents do not know their social\nstatus, natural abilities, or conceptions of the good (Rawls 1971,\n12). Such agents, like Kantian agents, are not influenced by the\nparticular desires and preferences that are contingent on being\nembedded in an actual situation. Because of this, their formulation of\nthe principles of justice is taken to be the product of a\n\u201cpure\u201d self, and hence genuinely\nself-originating. (For a more detailed account, see the entry\non \u201cOriginal Position\u201d.)\n\nFeminist philosophers typically reject the Kantian and Rawlsian\nconceptions of autonomy. Five categories of feminist critique have\nbeen identified (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 5\u201312). All of\nthe critiques reject both the nature of the self and the\nvalue of autonomy implicit in the Kantian/Rawlsian account.\nThe notion of self implicit in the Kantian and Rawlsian accounts is\nsaid to be \u201catomistic\u201d; that is, it is abstracted from the\nsocial relations in which actual agents are embedded. Such a\nconception of the self is associated with the claim that autonomous\nagents are, and ought to be, self-sufficient, which in turn is\nassociated with the character ideal of the \u201cself-made\nman\u201d. Feminists challenge this character ideal and question\nwhether self-sufficiency, or \u201csubstantive independence\u201d,\nis really a value that a theory of autonomy, and normative theories in\ngeneral, should promote (Jaggar 1985; Code 1991). If autonomy is\nsomehow conceived as inimical to being a woman\u2014because, for\nexample, being a women involves valuing social relationships of care\nwhereas being autonomous devalues such relationships\u2014one denies\nwomen, in particular, the social and political advantages associated\nwith the label \u201cautonomous\u201d.\n\nSince these initial critical reactions, feminist philosophers have\nattempted to rehabilitate autonomy (e.g., Meyers 1987 and 1989; Benson\n1990; Friedman 1997 and 2003; Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000a). Some\nfeminist philosophers have argued that articulating the conditions of\nautonomous choice is vital to attempts to understand gender\noppression. The challenge facing feminist theorists is to\nreconceptualize autonomy in ways that are compatible with the feminist\ncritiques (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 3\u20134).\n\u201cRelational autonomy\u201d is the name that has been given to\nfeminist reconceptualizations of the notion of autonomy. The term\n\u201crelational\u201d here may serve simply to deny that autonomy\nrequires self-sufficiency. If relationships of care and\ninterdependence are valuable and morally significant (cf. Mackenzie\n& Stoljar 2000b, 8\u201310), then any theory of autonomy must be\n\u201crelational\u201d in the sense that it must acknowledge that\nautonomy is compatible with the agent standing in and valuing\nsignificant family and other social relationships.\n\u201cRelational\u201d may also deny the metaphysical notion of\natomistic personhood, emphasizing instead that persons are socially\nand historically embedded, not metaphysically isolated, and shaped by\nfactors such as race and class. It is this latter sense of\n\u201crelational\u201d that will be employed in the following sketch\nof relational accounts.\n",
