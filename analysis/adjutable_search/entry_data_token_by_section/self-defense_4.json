    "main_text": "Proportionality\n3. Proportionality\nEven when an aggressor is liable to defensive harm, there are still important constraints on what may be done to them. Consider:\n\nSlap: Angela is angry with Victoria for spilling tomato juice on Angela\u2019s carpet and is about to slap her. The only way Victoria can defend herself is to kill Angela with her flamethrower.\n\nAngela culpably poses an unjustified threat to Victoria, but it would obviously be morally wrong for Victoria to defend herself. Using the flamethrower would be disproportionate. The proportionality constraint holds that the bad effects of a defensive action must not be excessive in relation to the good achieved. Though seemingly simple and intuitive, things quickly become complex once we try to identify the factors relevant to proportionality judgments.\n",
