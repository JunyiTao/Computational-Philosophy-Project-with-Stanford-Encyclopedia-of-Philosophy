Population geneticists develop abstract\nmathematical models of gene frequency dynamics, extract predictions\nabout the likely patterns of genetic variation in actual populations,\nand test the predictions against empirical data. A number of the more\nrobust generalizations to emerge from population-genetic analysis are\ndiscussed below.\n\nPopulation genetics is intimately bound up with the study of evolution\nand natural selection, and is often regarded as the theoretical\ncornerstone of evolutionary biology. This is because\n\u201cevolution\u201d has traditionally been defined as any\nchange in a population\u2019s genetic composition (though this\ndefinition has been criticized); and natural selection is one\nimportant factor (though not the only one) that can lead to such a\nchange. Natural selection occurs when some variants in a population\nout-reproduce other variants as a result of being better adapted to\nthe environment, or \u2018fitter\u2019. Presuming the fitness\ndifferences are at least partly due to genetic differences, this will\ncause the population\u2019s genetic makeup to change, as the genetic\nvariants associated with higher fitness increase in frequency. By\ndevising models of gene frequency change, population geneticists are\nthus able to shed light on the genetic basis of evolutionary change, and to\npermit the consequences of different evolutionary hypotheses to be\nexplored in a quantitatively precise way.\n\nPopulation genetics came into being in the 1920s and 1930s, thanks to\nthe work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright. Their\nachievement was to integrate the principles of Mendelian genetics,\nwhich had been rediscovered at the turn of century, with Darwinian\nnatural selection. Though the compatibility of Darwinism with\nMendelian genetics is today taken for granted, in the early years of\nthe twentieth century it was not. Many of the early Mendelians did not\naccept Darwin\u2019s \u2018gradualist\u2019 account of evolution,\nbelieving instead that novel adaptations must arise in a single\nmutational step; conversely, many of the early Darwinians did not\nbelieve in Mendelian inheritance, often because of the erroneous\nbelief that it was incompatible with the process of evolutionary\nmodification as described by Darwin. By working out mathematically the\nconsequences of selection acting on a population obeying the Mendelian\nrules of inheritance, Fisher, Haldane and Wright showed that Darwinism\nand Mendelism were not just compatible but excellent bed fellows; this\nplayed a key part in the formation of the \u2018neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis\u2019, and explains why population genetics came to occupy\nso pivotal a role in evolutionary theory.\n\nPopulation genetics is an important branch of science, but why should\nphilosophers care about it? There are a number of reasons. Firstly,\nDarwinian evolution has long been a fruitful source of ideas for\nphilosophers working in a variety of areas, including philosophy of\nmind, ethics and political philosophy. (Recall Darwin\u2019s famous\ncomment \u201che who understands baboon would do more for metaphysics\nthan Locke\u201d). To properly understand evolution requires a grasp\nof basic population genetics, which provides one motivation for\nphilosophers to learn about this field. Secondly, population genetics\nis a possible \u201ctesting ground\u201d for ideas developed in\ngeneral philosophy of science about idealization, explanation, the\nrole of abstract models, and the interplay between theory and data.\nThirdly, population genetics features prominently in many debates in\nphilosophy of biology over issues including the nature of evolutionary\ncausation, the logic of selective explanation, the role of chance in\nevolution, and the relation between population-level and\nindividual-level processes. Finally, population genetics is indirectly\nrelevant to certain other philosophical debates, such as the debate\nover the reality of biological race, for example.\n\nThe discussion below is structured as follows. Section 1 briefly\noutlines the origins of population genetics, focusing on major themes\nand controversies. Section 2 explains the Hardy-Weinberg principle,\nthe starting point of much population-genetic analysis. Section 3\noutlines some elementary models in population genetics and their\nconsequences. Section 4 discusses random drift (the chance\nfluctuations in gene frequency that arise in finite populations), and\ncoalescence (the joining up of gene lineages as we trace them back in\ntime). Section 5 discusses the status of population genetics in\nbiology. Section 6 examines some of the philosophical issues raised by\npopulation genetics.\n", "toc": [{"#OriPopGen": "1.

The Origins of Population Genetics\n\nTo understand how population genetics came into being, and to\nappreciate its intellectual significance, a brief excursion into the\nhistory of biology is necessary. Darwin\u2019s Origin of\nSpecies, published in 1859, propounded two main theses: firstly,\nthat modern species were descended from common ancestors, and secondly\nthat the process of natural selection was the major mechanism of\nevolutionary change. The first thesis quickly won acceptance in the\nscientific community, but the second did not. Many people found it\ndifficult to accept that natural selection could play the explanatory\nrole required of it by Darwin\u2019s theory. This\nsituation\u2014accepting that evolution had happened but doubting\nDarwin\u2019s account of what had caused it to happen\u2014persisted\nwell into the twentieth century (Bowler 1988).\n\nOpposition to natural selection was understandable, for Darwin\u2019s\ntheory, though compelling, contained a major lacuna: an account of the\nmechanism of inheritance. For evolution by natural selection to occur,\nit is necessary that parents should tend to resemble their offspring;\notherwise, fitness-enhancing traits will have no tendency to spread\nthrough a population. In the Origin, Darwin rested his\nargument on the observed fact that offspring do tend to\nresemble their parents\u2014\u2018the strong principle of\ninheritance\u2019\u2014while admitting that he did not know why this\nwas. Darwin did later attempt an explicit theory of inheritance, based\non hypothetical entities called \u2018gemmules\u2019, but it turned\nout to have no basis in fact.\n\nDarwin was troubled by not having a proper understanding of the\ninheritance mechanism, for it left him unable to rebut a powerful\nobjection to his theory. For a population to evolve by natural\nselection, the members of the population must vary\u2014if all\norganisms are identical, no selection can occur. So for selection to\ngradually modify a population over a long period of time, in the\nmanner suggested by Darwin, a continual supply of variation is needed.\nFleeming Jenkin argued that the available variation would be used up\ntoo fast (Jenkin 1867). His reasoning assumed a \u2018blending\u2019\ntheory of inheritance, i.e., that an offspring\u2019s phenotypic\ntraits are a \u2018blend\u2019 of those of its parents. (So for\nexample, if a short and a tall organism mate, the height of the\noffspring will be intermediate between the two.) Jenkin argued that\ngiven blending inheritance, a sexually reproducing population will\nbecome phenotypically homogenous in just a few generations, far\nshorter than the number of generations needed for natural selection to\nproduce complex adaptations.\n\nFortunately for Darwin\u2019s theory, inheritance does not actually\nwork the way Jenkin thought. The type of inheritance that we call\n\u2018Mendelian\u2019, after Gregor Mendel, is\n\u2018particulate\u2019 rather than\n\u2018blending\u2019\u2014offspring inherit discrete hereditary\nparticles (genes) from their parents, which means that sexual\nreproduction does not diminish the heritable variation present in the\npopulation. (See section 2, \u2018The Hardy-Weinberg\nPrinciple\u2019.) However this realisation took a long time to come,\nfor two reasons. Firstly, Mendel\u2019s work was overlooked by the\nscientific community for forty years. Secondly, even after the\nrediscovery of Mendel\u2019s work at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, it was widely believed that Darwinian evolution and Mendelian\ninheritance were incompatible. The early Mendelians did not accept\nthat natural selection played an important role in evolution, so were\nnot well placed to see that Mendel had given Darwin\u2019s theory the\nlifeline it needed. The synthesis of Darwinism and Mendelism, which\nmarked the birth of population genetics, was achieved by a long and\ntortuous route (Provine 1971).\n\nThe key ideas behind Mendel\u2019s theory of inheritance are\nstraightforward. In his experimental work on pea plants, Mendel\nobserved an unusual phenomenon. He began with two \u2018pure\nbreeding\u2019 lines, one producing plants with round seeds, the\nother wrinkled seeds. He then crossed these to produce the first\ndaughter generation (the F1 generation). The F1 plants all had round\nseeds\u2014the wrinkled trait had disappeared from the population.\nMendel then crossed the F1 plants with each other to produce the F2\ngeneration. Strikingly, approximately one quarter of the F2 plants had\nwrinkled seeds. So the wrinkled trait had made a comeback, skipping a\ngeneration.\n\nThese and similar observations were explained by Mendel as follows. He\nhypothesised that each plant contains a pair of \u2018factors\u2019\nthat together determine some aspect of its phenotype\u2014in this\ncase, seed shape. A plant inherits one factor from each of its\nparents. Suppose that there is one factor for round seeds\n\\((R)\\), another for wrinkled seeds \\((W)\\). There are then\nthree possible types of plant: \\(RR,\\) \\(RW\\) and\n\\(WW\\). An \\(RR\\) plant will have round seeds, a \\(WW\\)\nplant wrinkled seeds. What about an \\(RW\\) plant? Mendel\nsuggested that it would have round seeds\u2014the \\(R\\) factor\nis \u2018dominant\u2019 over the \\(W\\) factor. The observations\ncould then be easily explained. The initial pure-breeding lines were\n\\(RR\\) and \\(WW\\). The F1 plants were formed by \\(RR \\times WW\\) crosses, so were all of the \\(RW\\) type and\nthus had round seeds. The F2 plants were formed by \\(RW \\times RW\\) crosses, so contained a mixture of the \\(RR,\nRW\\) and \\(WW\\) types. If we assume that each \\(RW\\)\nparent transmits the \\(R\\) and \\(W\\) factors to its\noffspring with equal probability, then the F2 plants would contain\n\\(RR, RW\\) and \\(WW\\) in approximately the ratio\n1:2:1. (This assumption is known as Mendel\u2019s First Law\nor The Law of Segregation.) Since \\(RR\\) and \\(RW\\)\nboth have round seeds, this explains why three quarters of the F2\nplants had round seeds, one quarter wrinkled seeds.\n\nOur understanding of heredity today is vastly more sophisticated than\nMendel\u2019s, but the key elements of Mendel\u2019s\ntheory\u2014discrete hereditary particles that come in different\ntypes, dominance and recessiveness, and the law of\nsegregation\u2014have turned out to be essentially correct.\nMendel\u2019s \u2018factors\u2019 are the genes of population\ngenetics, and the alternative forms that a factor can take (e.g.,\n\\(R\\) versus \\(W\\) in the pea plant example) are known as\nthe alleles of a gene. The law of segregation is explained by\nthe fact that during gametogenesis, each gamete (sex cell) receives\nonly one of each chromosome pair from its parent organism. Other\naspects of Mendel\u2019s theory have been modified in the light of\nlater discoveries. Mendel thought that most phenotypic traits were\ncontrolled by a single pair of factors, like seed shape in his pea\nplants, but it is now known that most traits are affected by many\npairs of genes, not just one. Mendel believed that the pairs of\nfactors responsible for different traits (e.g., seed shape and flower\ncolour) segregated independently of each other, but we now know that\nthis need not be so (see section 3.5, \u2018Two-Locus Models and\nLinkage\u2019, below). Despite these points, Mendel\u2019s theory\nmarks a turning point in our understanding of inheritance.\n\nThe rediscovery of Mendel\u2019s work in 1900 did not lead the\nscientific community to be converted to Mendelism overnight. The\ndominant approach to the study of heredity at the time was biometry,\nspearheaded by Karl Pearson in London, which involved statistical\nanalysis of the phenotypic variation found in natural populations.\nBiometricians were mainly interested in continuously varying traits\nsuch as height, rather than the \u2018discrete\u2019 traits such as\nseed shape that Mendel studied, and were generally believers in\nDarwinian gradualism. Opposed to the biometricians were the\nMendelians, spearheaded by William Bateson, who emphasized\ndiscontinuous variation, and believed that major adaptive change could\nbe produced by single mutational steps, rather than by cumulative\nnatural selection \u00e0 la Darwin. A heated controversy between the\nbiometricians and the Mendelians ensued. As a result, Mendelian\ninheritance came to be associated with an anti-Darwinian view of\nevolution.\n\nPopulation genetics arose in part from the need to reconcile Mendel\nwith Darwin, a need which became increasingly urgent as the empirical\nevidence for Mendelian inheritance began to pile up. A significant\nmilestone was R.A. Fisher\u2019s 1918 paper, \u2018The Correlation\nbetween Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\u2019,\nwhich showed how the biometrical and Mendelian research traditions\ncould be unified. Fisher demonstrated that if a given continuous\ntrait, e.g., height, was affected by a large number of Mendelian\nfactors, each of which made a small difference to the trait, then the\ntrait would show an approximately normal distribution in a population.\nSince the Darwinian process was widely believed to work best on\ncontinuously varying traits, showing that the distribution of such\ntraits was compatible with Mendelism was an important step towards\nreconciling Darwin with Mendel.\n\nThe full reconciliation was achieved in the 1920s and early 30s,\nthanks to the mathematical work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright (Fisher\n1930, Haldane 1930\u201332, Wright 1931). These theorists developed\nformal models to explore how natural selection, and other evolutionary\nfactors such as mutation and random drift, would modify the genetic\ncomposition of a Mendelian population over time. This work marked a\nmajor step forward in evolutionary biology, for it enabled the\nconsequences of various evolutionary hypotheses to be explored\nquantitatively rather than just qualitatively. Verbal arguments about\nwhat natural selection could or could not achieve, or about the\npatterns of genetic variation to which it would give rise, were\nreplaced with explicit mathematical arguments. The strategy of\ndevising formal models to shed light on the evolutionary process\nremains the dominant methodology of population genetics today, though\nunlike in the 1930s, today\u2019s modellers have a wealth of\nempirical data against which to test their predictions (Hartl\n2020).\n\nFisher and Haldane were both strong Darwinians\u2014they believed\nthat natural selection was the most important factor affecting a\npopulation\u2019s genetic composition. Wright did not downplay the\nrole of natural selection, but he believed that chance also played a\ncrucial role, as did migration between the constituent sub-populations\nof a species (See sections 4, \u2018Random Drift\u2019, and 3.3,\n\u2018Migration\u2019.) The respective roles of natural selection\nand chance (or random drift) in shaping genetic variation, both within\nand between species, became a major theme in population genetics, and\nis still a live issue today. The issue lay at the heart of the\n\u201cneutralist versus selectionist\u201d controversy of the 1960s\nand 1970. The neutralists, led by Motoo Kimura, argued that much of\nthe molecular genetic variation found in natural populations was\nlikely to be neutral, i.e., the different genetic variants at a given\nlocus were mostly selectively equivalent (Kimura 1977, 1994). If true,\nthis suggests a significant role for random drift. Though initially\ncontroversial, the idea of abundant neutral variation in DNA sequence\nis today quite standard (Jensen et al. 2019); though this is fully\ncompatible with natural selection playing the major role in\nadaptive evolution (Kern and Hahn 2018).\n\nContemporary population genetics takes place in a very different\nscientific landscape to the one inhabited by Fisher, Haldane and\nWright. They were working in the pre-molecular biology era, when the\n\u201cgene\u201d was a purely theoretical entity, posited to explain\nobserved patterns of inheritance, but whose structure and molecular\ncomposition were unknown. Genetic variation could thus only be\nobserved indirectly, though the phenotypic variation to which it\n(sometimes) gave rise. This meant that there was very little empirical\ndata against which population genetic models could be tested; so the\nenterprise remained an essentially theoretical one. In the intervening\ncentury, the gene has gone from being a theoretical posit to being an\nentity whose molecular structure and functioning is understood in\ngreat detail. Since the 1980s, the technology for gene sequencing,\ni.e., determining the sequence of nucleotide bases in a length of DNA,\nhas become increasingly fast and cheap. This has allowed population\ngeneticists to directly study the genetic variation found in natural\npopulations, by sampling a number of individuals and sequencing a gene\nof interest (or in some cases the whole genome). As a result,\npopulation genetics is now a \u201cdata rich\u201d science, the\npolar opposite of the situation when the field was founded. Despite\nthis, many of the models, techniques and conclusions provided by the\nearlier theoretical work remain directly relevant today (Charlesworth\nand Charlesworth 2017).\n2. The Hardy-Weinberg Principle\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle, discovered independently by G.H. Hardy\nand W. Weinberg in 1908, is one of the simplest and most important\nprinciples in population genetics (Hardy 1908, Weinberg 1908). To\nillustrate the principle, consider a large population of sexually\nreproducing organisms. The organisms are diploids, meaning\nthat they contain two copies of each chromosome, one received from\neach parent. The gametes they produce are haploid, meaning\nthat they contain only one of each chromosome pair. During sexual\nfusion, two haploid gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, which then\ngrows and develops into an adult organism. Most multi-celled animals\nand many plants have a lifecycle of this sort.\n\nSuppose that at a given locus, or chromosomal \u2018slot\u2019,\nthere are two possible alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\); the locus is\nassumed to be on an autosome, not a sex chromosome. With respect to\nthe locus in question, there are three possible genotypes in the\npopulation, \\(A_1 A_1, A_1 A_2\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) (just as in\nMendel\u2019s pea plant example above). Organisms with the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) genotypes are called homozygotes;\nthose with the \\(A_1 A_2\\) genotype are heterozygotes. The\nproportions, or relative frequencies, of the three genotypes in the\noverall population may be denoted \\(f(A_1 A_1), f(A_1 A_2)\\) and\n\\(f(A_2 A_2)\\) respectively, where \\(f(A_1 A_1) + f(A_1 A_2) + f(A_2\nA_2) = 1\\). It is assumed that these genotypic frequencies are the\nsame for both males and females. The relative frequencies of the \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) alleles in the population are denoted \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where\n\\(p = f(A_1 A_1) + \\frac{1}{2}f(A_1 A_2)\\) and \\(q = f(A_2 A_2) +\n\\frac{1}{2}f(A_1 A_2).\\) Note that \\(p + q = 1\\).\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle is about the relation between the allelic\nand the genotypic frequencies. It states that if mating is random in\nthe population, and if natural selection, mutation, migration and\ndrift are absent, then in the offspring generation the genotypic and\nallelic frequencies will be related by the following simple\nequations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(A_1 A_1) &= p^2, \\\\\nf(A_1 A_2) &= 2pq, \\\\\nf(A_2 A_2) &= q^2\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRandom mating means the absence of a genotypic correlation between\nmating partners, i.e., the probability that a given organism mates\nwith an \\(A_1 A_1\\) partner, for example, does not depend on the\norganism\u2019s own genotype, and similarly for the other two\ngenotypes.\n\nThat random mating will lead the genotypes to be in the above\nproportions (\u201cHardy-Weinberg proportions\u201d) is a\nconsequence of Mendel\u2019s law of segregation. To see this, note\nthat random mating is in effect equivalent to offspring being formed\nby randomly picking pairs of gametes from a large \u2018gamete\npool\u2019 and fusing them into a zygote. The gamete pool contains\nall the successful gametes of the parent organisms. Since we are\nassuming the absence of selection, all parents contribute equal\nnumbers of gametes to the pool. By the law of segregation, an \\(A_1\nA_2\\) heterozygote produces gametes bearing the \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\)\nalleles in equal proportion (on average). Therefore, the relative\nfrequencies of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) alleles in the gamete pool will be\nthe same as in the parental population, namely \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nrespectively. Given that the gamete pool is very large, when we pick\npairs of gametes from the pool at random, we will get the ordered\ngenotypic pairs \\(\\{A_1 A_1\\},\\) \\(\\{A_1 A_2\\},\\) \\(\\{A_2 A_1\\},\\)\n\\(\\{A_2 A_2\\}\\) in the proportions \\(p^2 :pq:qp:q^2\\).  But order does\nnot matter, so we can regard the \\(\\{A_1 A_2\\}\\) and \\(\\{A_2 A_1\\}\\)\npairs as equivalent, giving the Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the\nunordered offspring genotypes.\n\nThis simple derivation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle deals with two\nalleles at a single locus, but can easily be extended to multiple\nalleles. (Extension to more than one locus is trickier; see section\n3.6 below.) For the multi-allelic case, suppose there are \\(n\\)\nalleles at the locus, \\(A_1 \\ldots A_n\\), with relative frequencies of\n\\(p_1 \\ldots p_n\\) respectively, where \\(p_1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_n =\n1\\). Assuming again that the population is large, mating is random,\nevolutionary forces are absent, and Mendel\u2019s law of segregation\nholds, then in the offspring generation the frequency of the\n\\(A_i A_i\\) genotype will be \\(p_i^2\\), and the frequency of\nthe (unordered) \\(A_i A_j\\) genotype \\((i \\ne j)\\) will be\n\\(2p_i p_j\\). Note that the two allele case is a special case\nof this generalized principle.\n\nImportantly, whatever the initial genotypic proportions, random mating\nwill automatically produce offspring in Hardy-Weinberg proportions\n(for one-locus genotypes). So if generations are non-overlapping,\ni.e., parents die as soon as they have reproduced, just one round of\nrandom mating is needed to bring about Hardy-Weinberg proportions in\nthe whole population; if generations overlap, more than one round of\nrandom mating is needed. Once Hardy-Weinberg proportions have been\nachieved, they will be maintained in subsequent generations so long as\nthe population continues to mate at random and is unaffected by\nevolutionary forces. The population is then said to be in\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium\u2014meaning that the genotypic\nfrequencies are constant from generation to generation.\n\nThe importance of the Hardy-Weinberg principle lies in the fact that\nit contains the solution to the problem of blending inheritance that\ntroubled Darwin. Jenkin\u2019s argument that sexual reproduction will\nrapidly diminish the variation in a population is disproved by the\nHardy-Weinberg principle. Sexual reproduction has no inherent tendency\nto destroy genotypic variation, for the genotypic proportions remain\nconstant over generations, given the assumptions noted above. It is\ntrue that natural selection often tends to destroy variation,\nand is thus a homogenizing force; but this is a quite different\nmatter. The \u2018blending\u2019 objection was that sexual mixing\nitself would produce homogeneity, even in the absence of\nselection, and the Hardy-Weinberg principle shows that this is\nuntrue.\n\nAnother benefit of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is that it greatly\nsimplifies the task of modelling evolutionary change. When a\npopulation is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it is possible to track\nthe genotypic composition of the population by directly tracking the\nallelic frequencies (or gametic frequencies). That this is so is\nclear\u2014for if we know the relative frequencies of all the alleles\n(at a single locus), and know that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium, the entire genotype frequency distribution can be easily\ncomputed. Were the population not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we\nwould need to explicitly track the genotype frequencies themselves,\nwhich is more complicated.\n\nPrimarily for this reason, many population-genetic models assume that\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium obtains; this is tantamount to assuming\nthat mating is random with respect to genotype. But is this assumption\nempirically plausible? The answer is sometimes but not always. In the\nhuman population, for example, mating is close to random with respect\nto ABO blood group, so the genotype that determines blood group is\nfound in approximately Hardy-Weinberg proportions in many populations\n(Hartl and Clark 2006). But mating is not random with respect to\nheight; on the contrary, people tend to choose mates similar in height\nto themselves. So if we consider a genotype that influences height,\nmating will not be random with respect to this genotype (see section\n3.4 \u2018Non-Random Mating\u2019).\n\nThe population geneticist W.J. Ewens has written of the Hardy-Weinberg\nprinciple, \u201cit does not often happen that the most important\ntheorem in any subject is the easiest and most readily derived theorem\nfor that subject\u201d (1969, p. 1). The main importance of the\nprinciple, as Ewens stresses, is not the gain in mathematical\nsimplicity that it permits, which is simply a beneficial side effect,\nbut rather what it teaches us about the preservation of genetic\nvariation in a sexually reproducing population.\n3. Population-Genetic Models of Evolution\n\nEvolutionary biologists often define \u2018evolution\u2019 as any\nchange in a population\u2019s genetic composition over time. The\nrationale for this definition is the idea that all other aspects of\nevolution, e.g., the spread of novel phenotypic traits and the\nformation of new species, stem ultimately from changes in gene\nfrequencies within populations. The four factors that can bring about\nsuch a change are: natural selection, mutation, random genetic drift,\nand migration into or out of the population. (A fifth\nfactor\u2014changes to the mating pattern\u2014can change the\ngenotype but not the gene frequencies; many\ntheorists would not count this as an evolutionary change.) A brief\nintroduction to the standard population-genetic treatment of each of\nthese factors is given below.\n3.1 Selection at One Locus\n\nNatural selection occurs when some variants in a population enjoy a\nsurvival or reproductive advantage over others. The simplest\npopulation-genetic model of natural selection focuses on a single\nautosomal locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), in a large\npopulation. Random mating is assumed. The three diploid genotypes\n\\(A_1 A_1,\\) \\(A_1 A_2\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) have different fitnesses,\ndenoted by \\(w_{11},\\) \\(w_{12}\\) and \\(w_{22}\\) respectively. These\nfitnesses are assumed to be constant across generations. A\ngenotype\u2019s fitness may be defined, in this context, as the\naverage number of successful gametes that an organism of that genotype\ncontributes to the next generation\u2014which depends on how well the\norganism survives, how many matings it achieves, and how fertile it\nis. Unless \\(w_{11},\\) \\(w_{12}\\) and \\(w_{22}\\) are all equal, then\nnatural selection will occur, which may lead the genetic composition\nof the population to change.\n\nSuppose that initially, i.e., before selection has operated, the\nzygote genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions and the frequencies\nof the \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) alleles are \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) respectively,\nwhere \\(p + q = 1\\). The zygotes then grow to adulthood and reproduce,\ngiving rise to a new generation of offspring zygotes. Our task is to\ncompute the frequencies of \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) in the second\ngeneration; let us denote these by \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\) respectively,\nwhere \\(p' + q' = 1\\). (Note that in both generations, we consider\ngene frequencies at the zygotic stage; these may differ from the adult\ngene frequencies if there is differential survivorship.)\n\nIn the first generation, the genotypic frequencies at the zygotic\nstage are \\(p^2 , 2pq\\) and \\(q^2\\) for \\(A_1 A_1,\\) \\(A_1 A_2,\\)\n\\(A_2 A_2\\) respectively, by the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The three\ngenotypes produce successful gametes in proportion to their fitnesses,\ni.e., in the ratio \\(w_{11}:w_{12}:w_{22}\\).  The average fitness in\nthe population is \\(w = p^2 w_{11} + 2pq w_{12} + q^2\nw_{22}\\). Assuming there is no mutation, and that Mendel\u2019s law\nof segregation holds, then an \\(A_1 A_1\\) organism will produce only\n\\(A_1\\) gametes, an \\(A_2 A_2\\) organism will produce only \\(A_2\\)\ngametes, and an \\(A_1 A_2\\) organism will produce \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\)\ngametes in equal proportion (on average). Therefore, the proportion of\n\\(A_1\\) gametes, and thus the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\nsecond generation at the zygotic stage, is:\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\begin{align}\np' &= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} (2pq w_{12})}{w} \\\\\n&= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}}{w}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nEquation (1) is known as a \u2018recurrence\u2019 equation\u2014it\nexpresses the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\nsecond generation in terms of its frequency in the first generation.\nThe change in frequency between generations can then be written\nas:\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta p &= p' - p \\\\\n&= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}}{w} - p \\\\\n&=  \\frac{pq[p(w_{11} - w_{12}) + q(w_{12} - w_{22})]}{w}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\Delta p \\gt 0\\), then natural selection has led the\n\\(A_1\\) allele to increase in frequency; if\n\\(\\Delta p \\lt 0\\) then selection has led the\n\\(A_2\\) allele to increase in frequency. If\n\\(\\Delta p = 0\\) then no gene frequency change has occurred,\ni.e., the system is in allelic equilibrium. (Note, however, that the\ncondition \\(\\Delta p = 0\\) does not imply that no\nnatural selection has occurred; the condition for that is\n\\(w_{11} = w_{12} = w_{22}\\). It is possible for natural selection to occur\nbut to have no effect on gene frequencies.)\n\nEquations (1) and (2) show, in precise terms, how fitness differences\nbetween genotypes will lead to evolutionary change. This enables us to\nexplore the consequences of various different selective regimes.\n\nSuppose firstly that \\(w_{11} \\gt w_{12} \\gt w_{22}\\), i.e., the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) homozygote is fitter than the \\(A_1 A_2\\) heterozygote, which in\nturn is fitter than the \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote. By inspection of\nequation (2), we can see that \\(\\Delta p\\) must be positive (so long\nas neither \\(p\\) nor \\(q\\) is zero). So in each generation, the\nfrequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele will be greater than in the previous\ngeneration, until it eventually reaches fixation. Once the \\(A_1\\)\nallele reaches fixation, i.e., \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 0\\), no further\nevolutionary change will occur, for if \\(p = 1\\) then \\(\\Delta p =\n0\\).  This makes good sense intuitively: since the \\(A_1\\) allele\nconfers a fitness advantage on organisms that carry it, its relative\nfrequency in the population will increase from generation to\ngeneration until it is fixed.\n\nIt is obvious that analogous reasoning applies in the case where\n\\(w_{22} \\gt w_{12} \\gt w_{11}\\). Equation (2) tells us that \\(\\Delta p\\)\nmust then be negative, so long as neither \\(p\\) nor \\(q\\) is\nzero, so the \\(A_2\\) allele will sweep to fixation.\n\nA more interesting situation arises when the heterozygote is superior\nin fitness to both of the homozygotes, i.e., \\(w_{12} \\gt w_{11}\\) and\n\\(w_{12} \\gt w_{22}\\)\u2014a phenomenon known as heteroygote\nsuperiority. Intuitively it is clear what should happen in this\nsituation: an equilibrium situation should be reached in which both\nalleles are present in the population. Equation (2) confirms this\nintuition. It is easy to see that \\(\\Delta p = 0\\) if either allele\nhas gone to fixation (i.e., if \\(p = 0\\) or \\(q = 0)\\), or, thirdly,\nif the following condition obtains:\n\n\\[\np(w_{11} - w_{12}) + q(w_{12} - w_{22}) = 0\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhich reduces to\n\n\\[\np = p^* = \\frac{(w_{12} - w_{22})}{(w_{12} - w_{22}) + (w_{12} - w_{11})}\n\\]\n\n\n(The asterisk indicates that this is an equilibrium condition.) Since\n\\(p\\) must be non-negative, this condition can only be satisfied\nif there is heterozygote superiority or inferiority; it represents an\nequilibrium state of the population in which both alleles are present.\nThis equilibrium is known as polymorphic, by contrast with\nthe monomorphic equilibria that arise when either of the\nalleles has gone to fixation. The possibility of polymorphic\nequilibrium is quite significant. It teaches us that natural selection\nwill not always lead to homogeneity; in some cases, selection\npreserves the genetic variation found in a population.\n\nNumerous evolutionary questions can be addressed using simple\npopulation-genetic models of this sort. For example, by incorporating\na parameter which measures the fitness differences between genotypes,\nwe can study the rate of evolutionary change, permitting us\nto ask questions such as: how long will it take for selection to\nincrease the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele from 0.1\nto 0.9? If a given deleterious allele is recessive, how much longer\nwill it take to eliminate it from the population than if it were\ndominant? In this way, population genetics converted the theory of\nevolution into a quantitatively precise one.\n\nThe one-locus model outlined above is unlikely to apply to many\nreal-life populations, due to the simplifying assumptions it makes. In\nreality, selection is rarely the only evolutionary force in operation,\ngenotypic fitnesses are unlikely to be constant across generations,\nMendelian segregation does not always hold exactly, and not all\nevolving populations are large. Much effort in population genetics has\nbeen put into making more realistic models which relax these\nassumptions and are thus more complicated. But the one-locus model\nillustrates the essence of the population-genetic analysis of\nevolutionary change.\n3.2 Selection-Mutation Balance\n\nMutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, preventing\npopulations from becoming genetically homogeneous. Once mutation is\ntaken into account, the conclusions drawn in the previous section need\nto be modified. Even if one allele is selectively superior to all\nothers at a given locus, it will not become fixed in the population;\nrecurrent mutation will ensure that other alleles are present at low\nfrequency, thus maintaining a degree of polymorphism. Population\ngeneticists have long been interested in exploring what happens when\nselection and mutation act simultaneously.\n\nContinuing with our one locus, two allele model, suppose that the\n\\(A_1\\) allele is selectively superior to\n\\(A_2\\), but recurrent mutation from\n\\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) prevents\n\\(A_1\\) from spreading to fixation. The rate of\nmutation from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) per\ngeneration, i.e., the proportion of \\(A_1\\) alleles\nthat mutate every generation, is denoted \\(u\\). (Empirical\nestimates of mutation rates are typically in the region of\n\\(10^{-6}\\).) Back mutation from \\(A_2\\) to\n\\(A_1\\) can be ignored, because we are assuming that\nthe \\(A_2\\) allele is at a very low frequency in the\npopulation, thanks to natural selection. What happens to the gene\nfrequency dynamics under these assumptions? Recall equation (1) above,\nwhich expresses the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in\nterms of its frequency in the previous generation. Since a certain\nfraction \\((u)\\) of the \\(A_1\\) alleles will have\nmutated to \\(A_2\\), this recurrence equation must be\nmodified to:\n\n\\[\np' = \\frac{(p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}) (1 - u)}{w}\n\\]\n\n\nto take account of mutation. As before, equilibrium is reached when\n\\(p' = p\\), i.e., \\(\\Delta p = 0\\). The\ncondition for equilibrium is therefore:\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\np = p^* = \\frac{(p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}) (1 - u)}{w}\n\\]\n\n\nA useful simplification of equation (3) can be achieved by making some\nassumptions about the genotype fitnesses, and adopting a new notation.\nLet us suppose that the \\(A_2\\) allele is completely recessive (as is\noften the case for deleterious mutants). This means that the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_1 A_2\\) genotypes have identical fitness. Therefore,\ngenotypic fitnesses can be written \\(w_{11} = 1,\\) \\(w_{12} = 1,\\)\n\\(w_{22} = 1 - s,\\) where \\(s\\) denotes the difference in fitness of\nthe \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote from that of the other two\ngenotypes. \\((s\\) is known as the selection coefficient\nagainst \\(A_2 A_2)\\). Since we are assuming that the \\(A_2\\) allele is\ndeleterious, it follows that \\(s \\gt 0\\). Substituting these genotype\nfitnesses in equation (3) yields:\n\n\n\\[\np^* = \\frac{p (1 - u)}{p^2 + 2pq + q^2 (1 - s)}\n\\]\n\n\nwhich reduces to:\n\n\\[\np^* = 1 - \\left(\\frac{u}{s}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nor equivalently (since \\(p + q = 1)\\):\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\nq^* = \\left(\\frac{u}{s}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nEquation (4) gives the equilibrium frequency of the \\(A_2\\) allele,\nunder the assumption that it is completely recessive. Note that as\n\\(u\\) increases, \\(q\\)* increases too. This is highly intuitive: the\ngreater the mutation rate from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\), the greater the\nfrequency of \\(A_2\\) that can be maintained at equilibrium, for a\ngiven value of \\(s\\). Conversely, as \\(s\\) increases, \\(q\\)*\ndecreases. This is also intuitive: the stronger the selection against\nthe \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote, the lower the equilibrium frequency of\n\\(A_2\\), for a given value of \\(u\\).\n\nIt is easy to see why equation (4) is said to describe\nselection-mutation balance\u2014natural selection is\ncontinually removing \\(A_2\\) alleles from the population, while\nmutation is continually re-creating them. Equation (4) tells us the\nequilibrium frequency of \\(A_2\\) that will be maintained, as a\nfunction of the rate of mutation from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) and the\nmagnitude of the selective disadvantage suffered by the \\(A_2 A_2\\)\nhomozygote. Though equation (4) was derived under the assumption that\nthe \\(A_2\\) allele is completely recessive, it is straightforward to\nderive similar equations for the cases where the \\(A_2\\) allele is\ndominant, or partially dominant. In those cases, \\(A_2\\)\u2019s\nequilibrium frequency will be lower than if it is completely\nrecessive; for selection is more efficient at removing it from the\npopulation. A deleterious allele that is recessive can\n\u2018hide\u2019 in heterozygotes, and thus escape the purging power\nof selection, but a dominant allele cannot.\n\nOur discussion in this section has focused on deleterious mutations,\ni.e., ones which reduce the fitness of their host organism. This may\nseem odd, given that beneficial mutations play a key role in the\nevolutionary process. The reason is that in population genetics, a\nmajor concern is to understand the causes of the genetic variability\nfound in biological populations. If a gene is beneficial, natural\nselection is likely to be the major determinant of its equilibrium\nfrequency; the rate of sporadic mutation to that gene will play at\nmost a minor role. It is only where a gene is deleterious that\nmutation plays a major role in maintaining it in a population.\n3.3 Migration\n\nMigration into or out of a population is a third factor that can\naffect its genetic composition. Obviously, if immigrants are\ngenetically different from the population they are entering, this will\ncause the population\u2019s genetic composition to change. The\nevolutionary importance of migration stems from the fact that many\nspecies are composed of a number of distinct subpopulations, largely\nisolated from each other but connected by occasional migration.\nMigration between subpopulations gives rise to gene flow, which acts\nas a sort of \u2018glue\u2019, limiting the extent to which\nsubpopulations can diverge from each other genetically.\n\nThe simplest model for analysing migration assumes that a given\npopulation receives a number of migrants each generation, but sends\nout no emigrants. Suppose the frequency of the \\(A_1\\)\nallele in the resident population is \\(p\\), and the frequency of\nthe \\(A_1\\) allele among the migrants arriving in the\npopulation is \\(p_m\\). The proportion of\nmigrants coming into the population each generation is \\(m\\)\n(i.e., as a proportion of the resident population.) So post-migration,\nthe frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the population\nis:\n\n\\[\np' = (1 - m) p + mp_m\n\\]\n\n\nThe change in gene frequency across generations is therefore:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Delta p &= p' - p \\\\\n  &= -m(p - p_m)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nTherefore, migration will increase the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele\nif \\(p_m \\gt p\\), decrease its frequency if \\(p \\gt p_m\\), and leave\nits frequency unchanged if \\(p = p_m\\). We can then derive an equation\ngiving the gene frequency in generation \\(t\\) as a function of its\ninitial frequency and the rate of migration::\n\n\\[\np_t = p_m + (p_0 - p_m)(1 - m)^t\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p_0\\) is the initial frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\npopulation, i.e., before any migration has taken place. Since the\nexpression \\((1 - m)^t\\) tends towards zero as \\(t\\) grows large, it\nfollows that equilibrium will eventually be reached when \\(p_t =\np_m\\), i.e., when the gene frequency of the migrants equals the gene\nfrequency of the resident population.\n\nThis simple model assumes that migration is the only factor affecting\ngene frequency at the locus, but this is unlikely to be the case. So\nit is necessary to consider how migration will interact with\nselection, drift and mutation (cf. Rice 2004, ch.5). A balance between\nmigration and selection can lead to the maintenance of a deleterious\nallele in a population, in a manner analogous to mutation-selection\nbalance. The interaction between migration and drift is especially\ninteresting. Genetic drift will often lead the separate subpopulations\nof a species to diverge genetically. Migration opposes this\ntrend\u2014it is a homogenising force that tends to make\nsubpopulations more alike. Mathematical models suggest that that even\na fairly small rate of migration will be sufficient to prevent the\nsubpopulations of a species from diverging genetically (Hartl and\nClark 2006). Some theorists have used this to argue against the\nevolutionary importance of group selection, on the grounds that\ngenetic differences between groups, which are essential for group\nselection to operate, are unlikely to persist in the face of\nmigration.\n3.4 Non-Random Mating\n\nRecall that the Hardy-Weinberg principle was derived under the\nassumption of random mating. But departures from random mating are\nactually quite common. Organisms may tend to choose mates who are\nsimilar to them phenotypically or genotypically\u2014a mating system\nknown as \u2018positive assortment\u2019. Alternatively, organisms\nmay choose mates dissimilar to them\u2014\u2018negative\nassortment\u2019. Another type of departure from random mating is\ninbreeding, or preferentially mating with relatives.\n\nAnalysing the consequences of non-random mating gets quite\ncomplicated, but some conclusions are fairly easily seen. Firstly,\nnon-random mating does not in itself affect gene frequencies (so\narguably is not an evolutionary \u2018force\u2019 on a par with\nselection, mutation and migration); rather, it affects genotype\nfrequencies. To appreciate this point, note that the gene frequency of\na population, at the zygotic stage, is equal to the gene frequency in\nthe pool of successful gametes from which the zygotes are formed. The\npattern of mating simply determines the way in which haploid gametes\nare \u2018packaged\u2019 into diploid zygotes. Thus if a random\nmating population suddenly starts to mate non-randomly, this will have\nno effect on gene frequencies.\n\nSecondly, positive assortative mating will tend to decrease the\nproportion of heterozygotes in the population,. To see this, consider\nagain a single locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), with\nfrequencies \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in a given population. Suppose that\ninitially the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so the\nproportion of \\(A_1 A_2\\) heterozygotes is \\(2pq\\). If the population\nthen starts to mate completely assortatively, i.e., mating only occurs\nbetween organisms of identical genotype, it is obvious that the\nproportion of heterozygotes must decline. For \\(A_1 A_1 \\times A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_2 A_2 \\times A_2 A_2\\) matings will produce no\nheterozygotes; and only half the progeny of \\(A_1 A_2 \\times A_1 A_2\\)\nmatings will be heterozygotic (on average). So the proportion of\nheterozygotes in the second generation must be less than\n\\(2pq\\). Conversely, negative assortment will tend to increase the\nproportion of heterozygotes from what it would be under Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium.\n\nWhat about inbreeding? In general, inbreeding will tend to increase\nthe homozygosity of a population, like positive assortment (Hartl\n2020, ch. 3). This is because relatives tend to be genotypically\nsimilar. Inbreeding often has negative effects on organismic\nfitness\u2014a phenomenon known as \u2018inbreeding\ndepression\u2019. The explanation for this is that deleterious\nalleles often tend to be recessive, so have no phenotypic effect when\nfound in heterozygotes. Inbreeding reduces the proportion of\nheterozygotes, making recessive alleles more likely to be found in\nhomozygotes where their negative phenotypic effects become apparent.\nThe converse phenomenon\u2014\u2018hybrid vigour\u2019 resulting\nfrom outbreeding\u2014is widely utilised by animal and plant\nbreeders.\n3.5 Two-Locus Models and Linkage\n\nThe one-locus model outlined above is unrealistic, since in practice\nevolution may occur at multiple loci simultaneously. The simplest\ntwo-locus model assumes two autosomal loci, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each with\ntwo alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2, B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\). Thus there are four\ntypes of haploid gamete in the population\u2014\\(A_1 B_1, A_1 B_2,\nA_2 B_1\\) and \\(A_2 B_2\\)\u2014whose frequencies we will denote by\n\\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\) respectively. (Note that the \\(x_i\\)\nare not allele frequencies; in the two-locus case, we cannot\nequate \u2018gamete frequency\u2019 with \u2018allelic\nfrequency\u2019, as is possible for a single locus.) Diploid\norganisms are formed by the fusion of two gametes, as before. Thus\nthere are ten possible diploid genotypes in the population\u2014found\nby taking every gamete type in combination with every other.\n\nIn the one-locus case, we saw that in a large randomly-mating\npopulation, there is a simple relationship between the gametic and\nzygotic frequencies. In the two-locus case, the same relationship\nholds. Thus for example, the frequency of the \\(A_1 B_1 / A_1 B_1\\)\ngenotype will be \\((x_1)^2\\); the frequency of the \\(A_1 B_1 / A_2\nB_1\\) genotype will be \\(2x_1 x_3\\), and so-on. (This can be\nestablished rigorously with an argument based on random sampling of\ngametes, just as in the one-locus case.) The first aspect of the\nHardy-Weinberg principle\u2014genotypic frequencies given by the\nsquare of the array of gametic frequencies\u2014therefore transposes\nneatly to the two-locus case. However, the second aspect of\nHardy-Weinberg\u2014stable genotypic frequencies after one round of\nrandom mating\u2014does not generally apply in the two-locus\ncase.\n\nA key concept in two-locus population genetics is that of\nlinkage, or lack of independence between the two loci. To\nunderstand linkage, consider the set of gametes produced by an\norganism of the \\(A_1 B_1 / A_2 B_2\\) genotype, i.e., a double\nheterozygote. If the two loci are unlinked, then the\ncomposition of this set (on average) will be \\(\\{ \\frac{1}{4} A_1 B_1,\n\\frac{1}{4} A_1 B_2, \\frac{1}{4} A_2 B_1, \\frac{1}{4} A_2 B_2\\}\\),\ni.e., all four gamete types are equally represented. (This assumes\nthat Mendel\u2019s first law holds at both loci.) So unlinked loci\nare independent\u2014which allele a gamete has at the \\(A\\) locus\ntells us nothing about which allele it has at the \\(B\\) locus. The\nopposite extreme is perfect linkage. If the two loci are perfectly\nlinked, then the set of gametes produced by the \\(A_1 B_1 / A_2 B_2\\)\ndouble heterozygote has the composition \\(\\{\\frac{1}{2} A_1 B_1,\n\\frac{1}{2} A_2 B_2\\}\\); this means that if a gamete receives the\n\\(A_1\\) allele at the \\(A\\) locus, it necessarily receives the \\(B_1\\)\nallele at the \\(B\\) locus and vice versa.\n\nIn physical terms, perfect linkage means that the \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) loci are located close together on the same chromosome; the\nalleles at the two loci are thus inherited as a single unit. Unlinked\nloci are either on different chromosomes, or on the same chromosome\nbut separated by a considerable distance, hence likely to be broken up\nby recombination. Where the loci are on the same chromosome, perfect\nlinkage and complete lack of linkage are two ends of a continuum. The\ndegree of linkage is measured by the recombination fraction\n\\(r\\), where \\(0 \\le r \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\). The composition of\nthe set of gametes produced by an organism of the\n\\(A_1 B_1 /\nA_2 B_2\\) genotype can be written\nin terms of \\(r\\), as follows:\n\n\n\\(A_1 B_1\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} (1 - r)\\)\n\n\n\\(A_1 B_2\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} r\\) \n\n\\(A_2 B_1\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} r\\) \n\n\\(A_2 B_2\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} (1 - r)\\)\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\) means that the loci are\nunlinked, while \\(r = 0\\) means that they are perfectly\nlinked.\n\nIn a two-locus model, the gametic (and therefore genotypic)\nfrequencies need not be constant across generations, even in the\nabsence of selection, mutation, migration and drift, unlike in the\none-locus case. (Though allelic frequencies will be constant,\nin the absence of these evolutionary forces.) It is possible to derive\nrecurrence equations for the gamete frequencies, as a function of\ntheir frequencies in the previous generation plus the recombination\nfraction:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_1' &= x_1 + r(x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4) \\\\\nx_2' &= x_2 + r(x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4) \\\\\nx_3' &= x_3 + r(x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4) \\\\\nx_4' &= x_4 + r(x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(See Ewens 1969 or Edwards 2000 for an explicit derivation of these\nequations.)\n\nFrom the recurrence equations, it follows that gametic (and thus\ngenotypic) frequencies will be stable across generations, i.e., \\(x_i'\n= x_i\\) for each \\(i\\), under either of two conditions: (i) \\(r = 0\\),\nor (ii) \\(x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4 = 0\\). Condition (i) means that the two\nloci are perfectly linked and thus in effect behave as one; condition\n(ii) means that the two loci are in \u2018linkage equilibrium\u2019,\nso that alleles at the \\(A\\)-locus are in random association with\nalleles at the \\(B\\)-locus. More precisely, linkage equilibrium means\nthat the population-wide frequency of the \\(A_i B_i\\) gamete is equal\nto the frequency of the \\(A_i\\) allele multiplied by the frequency of\nthe \\(B_i\\) allele.\n\nAn important result in two-locus theory shows that, given random\nmating, the quantity \\((x_2 x_3 - x_1 x_4)\\) will decrease\nevery generation until it reaches zero\u2014at which point the\ngenotype frequencies will be in equilibrium. So a population initially\nin linkage disequilibrium will approach linkage equilibrium over a\nnumber of generations, at a rate that depends on \\(r\\), the\nrecombination fraction. Note the contrast with the one-locus case,\nwhere just one round of random mating is sufficient to bring the\ngenotype frequencies into equilibrium.\n4. Random Drift\n\nRandom genetic drift refers to the chance fluctuations in gene\nfrequency that arise in finite populations. In many evolutionary\nmodels, including those outlined in section 3 above. the population is\nassumed to be very large (technically, infinite) precisely in order to\nabstract away from such fluctuations. But though mathematically\nconvenient, this assumption is often unrealistic. In real life\npopulations, particularly those of small size, stochasticity is an\nimportant source of evolutionary change. Thus a given allele may\nincrease or decrease in frequency not because of any effect it has on\norganismic survival or reproduction, but simply by chance.\nUnderstanding such stochastic changes in gene frequency, and their\ninteraction with natural selection, is a major topic in population\ngenetics, past and present.\n\nThe term \u201crandom drift\u201d has both a narrow and a broad\nsense (Kimura 1964; Rice 2004; Millstein 2016). In the narrow sense,\nit refers to gene frequency changes that arise from the random\nsampling of gametes to form the offspring generation. (The point here\nis that organisms produce many more gametes than will ever make it\ninto a fertilized zygote, and only half of a diploid organism\u2019s\ngenes are transmitted to each gamete). In the broader sense, drift\nrefers to gene frequency changes arising from all stochastic factors,\nincluding for example random fluctuations in selection intensities, or\nin survival and mating success. The narrower sense of the term is used\nhere.\n\nRandom drift greatly complicates the task of the population\ngeneticist. For in the presence of drift, it is no longer possible to\ndeduce the genetic composition of the population in generation\n\\(t+1\\) from its composition in generation \\(t\\); so no\nrecurrence relation for an allele\u2019s frequency, of the sort\nexpressed in equation (1) above, can be derived. Instead, the aim must\nbe to deduce the probability distribution over all the\npossible genetic compositions of the population in generation\n\\(t+1\\). From this, it is sometimes possible to extract a\nprediction about the long-term fate of an allele.\n\nThe simplest and most widely-used model for analysing random drift is\nknown as the Wright-Fisher model. This model deals with a\nfinite population containing \\(N\\) diploid organisms. \\(N\\)\nis assumed constant over generations (perhaps because of ecological\nconstraints). Generations are non-overlapping, meaning that parents\ndie as soon as they have reproduced, and mating is random. Selection,\nmigration and mutation are assumed absent. The offspring generation is\nformed by randomly sampling \\(2N\\) of the gametes produced by the\nparental generation. Time is discrete, with one generation\ncorresponding to one time period. Consider a particular allele of\ninterest. Let \\(X(t)\\) denote the number of copies of\nthe allele in the population in generation \\(t\\), where \\(0 \\leq\nX(t) \\leq 2N\\) (since organisms are diploid). The allele\u2019s\nfrequency \\(p(t)\\) is then equal to \\(\\frac{1}{2N}X(t),\\)\nwhere \\(0 \\leq p(t) \\leq 1\\).\n\nWe are interested in \\(X(t+1)\\) and \\(p(t+1)\\), the number of copies\nand frequency of the allele in generation \\(t+1,\\) respectively. (They\nare related by \\(p(t+1) = \\frac{1}{2N}X(t+1).\\)) Now, \\(X(t+1)\\) is a\nrandom variable that can take any of \\(2N+1\\) possible values from the\nset \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots ,2N\\}\\). Since the offspring generation is\nformed by random sampling from the parental gamete pool, the\nprobability distribution of \\(X(t+1)\\) is given by the binomial\ndistribution:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{Prob}(X(t+1) = x) = \\binom{2N}{x}p(t)^x(1-p(t))^{2N-x}\n\\]\n\n\nThis formula tells us, for each possible value of \\(X(t+1)\\), what its\nprobability is as a function of the population size \\(N\\) and the\nallele\u2019s frequency in the parental generation \\(p(t).\\) From\nthis, we can easily compute the expected value of \\(X(t+1)\\), denoted\n\\(E(X(t + 1))\\), which turns out to simply be equal to \\(X(t)\\). This\nis quite intuitive: since the second generation is formed by random\nsampling, the number of copies of the allele is just as likely to\nincrease as to decrease, so the expected number of copies in\ngeneration \\(t+1\\) equals the actual number of copies in generation\n\\(t.\\) It follows that the expected change in allele frequency from\ngeneration \\(t\\) to \\(t+1,\\) denoted \\(E(\\Delta p)\\), is equal to\nzero.\n\nThe fact that \\(E(\\Delta p) = 0\\) does not imply that drift will have\nno evolutionary effect. For \\(\\Delta p\\) may have a substantial\nvariance around the mean of zero (depending on the value of \\(N\\)), so\nit may be quite probable that \\(\\Delta p\\) deviates from zero by a\nsubstantial amount. (Similarly, if one flips a fair coin 20 times, the\nexpected number of heads is 10, but the probability that the actual\nnumber of heads is 8 or less is quite substantial \u2013\napproximately 25%). In the Wright-Fisher model, the variance of\n\\(\\Delta p\\) turns out to be \\(Var(\\Delta p) = \\frac{1}{2N}p(1-p)\\).\nThus as the population size increases, the variance of \\(\\Delta p\\)\ngets smaller and smaller, which illustrates the point that random\ndrift is more important in small than in large populations.\n\nWhat will happen in the long run? Under the assumptions of the\nWright-Fisher model, the sequence of allele frequencies in successive\ngenerations \\(\\{p(0), p(1), p(2), \\ldots \\}\\)constitutes what is known\nas a Markov chain, that is, a sequence of random variables\n(stochastic process) where the probability distribution of any\nvariable depends only on the value of the immediately preceding\nvariable. That is, the probability that the allele has a frequency of\n(say) 0.8 in generation \\(t+1\\), denoted \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 0.8)\\),\ndepends on the value of \\(p(t),\\) the allele\u2019s frequency in\ngeneration \\(t\\), but not on its frequency in earlier\ngenerations. Importantly, this Markov chain has a special feature,\nnamely that the the two extremal values of \\(p(t)\\), i.e., 0 and 1,\nare absorbing boundaries, meaning that if the system reaches\none of these boundaries it stays there. That is, if the allele goes\nextinct in generation \\(t\\), so has a frequency of zero, then in\nall subsequent generations its frequency will also be zero (since we\nare ignoring mutation). Similarly, if the allele goes to fixation in\ngeneration \\(t\\), it will remain fixed in subsequent generations.\nFormally, we can express these facts as: \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 0 \\mid p(t)\n= 0) = 1\\) and \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 1 \\mid p(t) = 1) = 1\\). Since there is\nno upper bound on the number of generations, eventually random drift\nmust lead the allele to go extinct or to become fixed in the\npopulation (and similarly for other alleles). This is because of the\nabsorbing boundary assumption, which implies that every stochastic\ntrajectory must eventually end up at \\(p(t) = 0\\) or \\(p(t) = 1\\), for\nsome value of \\(t.\\)\n\nThis leads naturally to the following question. What is the\nprobability that the allele will become fixed in the population,\nrather than going extinct? The Wright-Fisher model yields a very\nsimple answer to this question. If a given (neutral) allele has a\nfrequency \\(p(t)\\) in generation \\(t\\) , then the\nprobability that it eventually fixes is simply \\(p(t).\\)\nThis is a fairly intuitive result. For if the allele is rare, it is\nquite likely that it will be lost from the population by chance.\nConversely, if the allele is common, it is most unlikely to be lost\nfrom the population, as this would require an improbable series of\nchance events to occur together. An immediate consequence of this\nresult is that the probability of fixation of a novel (neutral)\ngenetic variant, that has arisen in the population by sporadic\nmutation, is \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\) \u2013 since initially there is one copy of\nthe novel variant in the population. Thus for appreciable \\(N\\),\nit is overwhelmingly likely that any given novel variant will be lost\nto genetic drift. This illustrates the general fact that genetic drift\nhas a homogenizing tendency over many generations, reducing the\ngenetic variation in a population.\n\nImportantly, the equality between an allele\u2019s current frequency\nand its probability of becoming fixed assumes that the allele in\nquestion, and other alleles at the same locus, are selectively\nneutral\u2014meaning that random drift is the sole determinant of the\nchanges in frequency. If this assumption is relaxed, matters become\nmore complicated. The fate of an allele then depends on both drift and\non its selective advantage or disadvantage. This takes us beyond the\nconfines of the simple Wright-Fisher model since now there are two\nevolutionary factors at work\u2014random drift and natural selection.\nIn a finite population, an allele that is selectively advantageous, so\nhas a positive selection coefficient, will have a higher probability\nof fixation that a neutral allele; and conversely for one that is\nselectively disadvantageous. This is fairly obvious. What is less\nobvious, but still true, is that even if a novel variant arises that\nconfers a significant selective advantage, it is still more likely to\nbe eliminated by drift than to become fixed. To quantitatively study\nthe combined effects of selection and drift, population geneticists\nuse an advanced probabilistic technique known as diffusion analysis,\nwhich lies beyond the scope of this article (see Rice 2004 ch.5, Hartl\n2020, ch.6. or Otto and Day 2007, ch.15). But one key result deserves\nmention, which is that the eventual fate of an allele depends on the\nrelative magnitude of two quantities, namely \\(4N_e\\) and \\(s\\).\nHere \\(N_e\\) denotes the \u201ceffective population size\u201d\n(which corrects the actual population size to take account of\ndeviations from the idealized assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model),\nand \\(s\\) is the selection coefficient, which is a measure of the\nrelative fitness of organisms with the allele compared to organisms\nwithout, where \\(0 \\leq s \\leq 1\\). It turns out that if \\(4N_e s\n\\gg 1\\) then natural selection will determine the fate of an\nallele, while if \\(4N_e s \\ll 1\\) then drift will determine its\nfate.\n\nThe respective roles of drift and natural selection in molecular\nevolution was the subject of the selectionist versus neutralist\ncontroversy in the 1960s and 1970s, as noted in the Introduction (cf.\nDietrich 1994). The neutralist camp, headed by Kimura, argued that\nmost molecular variants had no effect on phenotype, so were not\nsubject to natural selection; random drift was instead the main\ndeterminant of their fate. Kimura argued that the apparently constant\nrate at which the amino acid sequences of proteins evolved, and the\nextent of genetic polymorphism observed in natural populations, could\nbest be explained by the neutralist hypothesis (Kimura 1977, 1994).\nSelectionists countered that natural selection was also capable of\nexplaining the observed polymorphism. The controversy ended without a\nclear victory for either side, in part due to paucity of data. However\nthe opposition between selection and drift remains a central topic in\nmolecular population genetics today, where there is an abundance of\ndata on DNA sequence variation in natural populations. Sophisticated\nmethods have been developed to allow researchers to hunt for\nsignatures of past selection in the genomes of modern organisms. It\nhas become clear that there is indeed much neutral molecular variation\nin DNA sequence (in part due to \u201csynonymous\u201d mutations\nthat leave unchanged the amino acid sequence of the protein that the\ngene codes for). However, there is also much evidence showing that the\ngenomes of contemporary species have been substantially influenced by\nnatural selection (Casillas and Barbadilla 2017, Kern and Hahn 2018).\nMoreover, the idea that drift is the sole determinant of a neutral\nvariant\u2019s frequency, as the original neutralists held, is not\nnecessarily true. Another possibility, championed by J. Gillespie\n(2004), is that a neutral variant\u2019s spread in a population may\nbe heavily influenced by selection at linked loci, a process known as\n\u201chitchhiking\u201d or \u201cgenetic draft\u201d; see Skipper\n(2004) for discussion. A recent evaluation of the selection versus\ndrift issue concludes that \u201cthe extent to which DNA sequence\nevolution is caused by selection versus drift remains an important\nunanswered general question\u201d (Charlesworth and Charlesworth\n2017, p.6).\n\nThough random drift is well-understood mathematically, and is the\nsubject of much empirical research in biology, a number of\nphilosophers have suggested that it is conceptually less clearcut than\none might think. Thus for example Millstein (2002) has argued that the\nterm \u201crandom drift\u201d as used by biologists is often\nambiguous as between a process (such as random sampling) and an\noutcome (such as change in gene frequency). Millstein\u2019s point\nhas given rise to a considerable philosophical literature on how\nexactly the terms \u201cdrift\u201d and \u201cselection\u201d\nshould be defined; see the entry on\n genetic drift\n for discussion and references.\n4.1 Coalescence\n\nTraditional population genetics models of the sort sketched above are\n\u201cforward-looking\u201d, in that their goal is to predict the\nfuture genetic composition of a population, or the fate of an allele,\nbased on various assumptions about the evolutionary processes at work.\nStarting in the 1980s, a different approach to population genetics was\ndeveloped known as \u201ccoalescent theory\u201d, originally as a\nresult of work in applied probability (Kingman 1982). Coalescent\ntheory has a \u201cbackwards-looking\u201d orientation: it aims to\nmake inferences about a population\u2019s history based on a sample\nof genes drawn from the current population (Wakeley 2008). Compared to\nthe traditional forwards-looking models, coalescent theory allows a\ndifferent set of evolutionary questions to be asked, and also yields\nsimpler ways of calculating certain quantities of interest in the\ntraditional models, such as fixation probabilities (Rice 2004, ch. 5).\nAlso, coalescent theory yields predictions, for example about the\namount of DNA sequence variation we should expect to find in a sample\nof genes from a natural population, that can be directly tested\nagainst data.\n\nCoalescent theory is all about tracing lines of ancestry between genes\nin a (diploid) population. Ordinarily we think of ancestor-descendant\nlineages of organisms, but we can equally (indeed more easily) think\nin terms of lineages of genes at a locus, while simply ignoring the\norganisms that the genes are housed within. The starting point of\ncoalescent theory is the observation that all the genes at a locus in\na current population must ultimately stem from a single ancestral gene\ncopy in the past (the \u201cmost recent common ancestor\u201d or\nMRCA). This is in effect the flip-side of genetic drift. If we go back\nfar enough in a population\u2019s ancestry, we must arrive at a point\nat which all of the genes bar one have left no descendants in the\ncurrent population. This is because, at every round of reproduction, a\ngiven gene copy has a certain chance of not leaving any descendants in\nthe next generation, i.e., being eliminated by drift. This implies\nthat, as we trace back in time, the gene lineages will join up, or\n\u201ccoalesce\u201d.\n\nThe simplest approach to coalescence uses the Wright-Fisher model,\nexpounded above. Recall that this model involves a diploid population\nof fixed size \\(N\\), in which selection is absent, mating is random,\nand generations are non-overlapping. Each new generation is formed by\nrandomly sampling \\(2N\\) of the gametes produced by the previous\ngeneration. To illustrate coalescence, suppose that we pick two gene\ncopies at random from the current population. There are then two\npossibilities: either both derive from a single copy in the preceding\ngeneration, or they do not. These two events occur with probabilities\n\\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\) and \\((1 - \\frac{1}{2N})\\) respectively. To see this, note that\nthe first gene we pick must have some parent or other in the previous\ngeneration; so the probability that the two genes we pick derive from\na single copy in the previous generation is simply the probability\nthat the second gene has the same parent as the first; since there are\n\\(2N\\) possible parents, this equals \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\). So the alternative\npossibility, that the two genes do not coalesce in the previous\ngeneration, has the complementary probability of \\((1 - \\frac{1}{2N})\\).\n\nThis reasoning can be repeated in a natural way. Suppose that the two\ngenes we pick do not coalesce in the immediately previous generation,\ni.e., they have different parents. Then, those two parents genes will\nthemselves either derive from a single copy in the previous\ngeneration, or they will not. If so, then the two genes we have picked\nwill coalesce two generations ago, i.e., derive from a single\ngrandparent gene. The probability of this is \\(\\frac{1}{2N} \\times (1 -\n\\frac{1}{2N})\\). By iterating this reasoning, we can work out the\nprobability distribution that two randomly chosen gene copies in the\ncurrent generation derive from a common ancestor t\ngenerations ago. This is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{Prob}(\\text{coalescence}~t~\\text{generations ago}) = \\frac{1}{2N}\n\\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)^{t-1}.\n\\]\n\n\nThe next question to ask is what the expected value of this\ndistribution is, that is, what the mean time to coalescence is? The\nanswer turns out to be approximately \\(2N\\). Thus on average, a\npair of randomly picked genes at a given locus will coalesce after\n\\(2N\\) generations, where \\(N\\) is population size. However,\nthere is considerable variability about this mean, meaning that there\nis a significant chance that coalescence will occur much quicker, or\nmuch slower, than this. By building on this simple analysis,\ncoalescent theory allows a range of more complicated questions to be\nanswered, involving, for example, multiple alleles, sub-divided\npopulations, populations that change in size over time, plus other\ndeviations from the assumptions of the basic Wright-Fisher model. For\nexample, coalescent theory yields a straightforward calculation of how\nmany generations back we must go, on average, to find the MRCA of a\nnumber of different genes at a locus (Otto and Day 2007, ch. 13).\n5. Population Genetics and its Critics\n\nThe status of population genetics in contemporary biology is an\ninteresting issue. Despite its centrality to evolutionary theory, and\nits historical importance, population genetics is not without its\ncritics. Some argue that population geneticists have devoted too much\nenergy to developing theoretical models, often with great mathematical\ningenuity, and too little to actually testing the models against\nempirical data (Wade 2005). This was probably a fair criticism at one\ntime, however the recent flourishing of molecular population genetics\nhas changed the situation, allowing much greater contact between\ntheory and data (Hahn 2018). Others argue that population-genetic\nmodels are usually too idealized to shed any real light on the\nevolutionary process, and are limited in what they can teach us about\nphenotypic evolution (Pigliucci 2008). Still others have argued that,\nhistorically, population genetics has had a relatively minor impact on\nthe actual practice of most evolutionary biologists, despite the\nlip-service often paid to it (Lewontin 1980). However, not all\nbiologists accept these criticisms. Thus the geneticist Michael Lynch\n(2007), for example, has written that \u201cnothing in biology makes\nsense except in the light of population genetics\u201d, in a twist on\nDobzhansky\u2019s famous dictum; see Bromham (2009) and Pigliucci\n(2008) for discussion of Lynch\u2019s arguments. And in a recent\nsurvey of 50 years of population genetics, Charlesworth and\nCharlesworth (2017) argue that population-genetic analysis has not\nonly enabled us to understand the nature and causes of molecular\ngenetic variation, but has also provided deep insights into a variety\nof topics in evolutionary biology.\n\nPopulation-genetic models of evolution have sometimes been criticised\non the grounds that few phenotypic traits are controlled by genotype\nat a single locus, or even two or three loci. (Multi-locus\npopulation-genetic models do exist, but they are inevitably very\ncomplicated.) There is an alternative body of theory, known as\nquantitative genetics, which deals with so-called\n\u2018polygenic\u2019 or \u2018continuous\u2019 traits, such as\nheight, which are thought to be affected by genes at many different\nloci in the genome, rather than just one or two; see Falconer (1995)\nor Walsh and Lynch (2018) for good overviews. Quantitative genetics\nemploys a quite different methodology from population genetics. The\nlatter, as we have seen, aims to track gene and genotype frequencies\nacross generations. By contrast, quantitative genetics does not\ndirectly deal with gene frequencies; the aim is to track the phenotype\ndistribution, or moments of the distribution such as the mean or the\nvariance, across generations. Though widely used by animal and plant\nbreeders, quantitative genetics is usually regarded as a less\nfundamental body of theory than population genetics, given its\n\u2018phenotypic\u2019 orientation. Nonetheless, the relationship\nbetween population and quantitative genetics is essentially\nharmonious.\n\nA different criticism of the population-genetic approach to evolution\nis that it ignores embryological development; this criticism really\napplies to the evolutionary theory of the \u2018modern\nsynthesis\u2019 era more generally, which had population genetics at\nits core. As we have seen, population-genetic reasoning assumes that\nan organism\u2019s genes somehow affect its phenotype, and thus its\nfitness, but it is silent about the details of how genes actually\nbuild organisms, i.e., about embryology. The founders of the modern\nsynthesis treated embryology as a \u2018black box\u2019, the details\nof which could be ignored for the purposes of evolutionary theory;\ntheir focus was on the transmission of genes across generations, not\nthe process by which genes make organisms (see the entry on\n evolution and development).\n This strategy was perfectly reasonable, given how little was\nunderstood about development at the time. But since the 1990s, great\nstrides have been made in molecular developmental genetics, which has\nrenewed hopes of integrating the study of embryological development\nwith evolutionary theory and has led to the emergence of the\ndiscipline of \u2018evolutionary developmental biology\u2019, or\nevo-devo (see Arthur 2021 for a recent overview or the entry on\n evolution and development). \nIt is sometimes argued that evo-devo is in tension with traditional\nneo-Darwinism (e.g., Amundson 2007), but it is more plausible to view\nthem as complementary ways of studying evolution that have different\nemphases.\n\nIn a 2005 book, Sean Carroll, a leading evo-devo researcher, argued\nthat population genetics no longer deserves pride-of-place on the\nevolutionary biology curriculum. He writes: \u201cmillions of biology\nstudents have been taught the view (from population genetics) that\n\u2018evolution is change in gene frequencies\u2019 \u2026 This\nview forces the explanation toward mathematics and abstract\ndescriptions of genes, and away from butterflies and zebras, or\nAustralopithecines and Neanderthals\u201d (2005 p. 294). A similar\nargument has been made by Pigliucci (2008). Carroll argues that\ninstead of defining evolution as \u2018change in gene\nfrequencies\u2019, we should define it as \u2018change in\ndevelopment\u2019, in recognition of the fact that most morphological\nevolution is brought about through mutations that affect organismic\ndevelopment. Carroll may be right that evo-devo makes for a more\naccessible introduction to evolutionary biology than population\ngenetics, and that an exclusive focus on gene frequency dynamics is\nnot the best way to understand all evolutionary phenomena; but\npopulation genetics arguably remains indispensable to a full\nunderstanding of the evolutionary process.\n\nIn recent years, a vigourous debate has opened up about whether the\n\u201cmodern synthesis\u201d (MS) is still adequate to the needs of\nbiology. The MS, or neo-Darwinian synthesis, is the intellectual\nedifice that arose in the 20th century from the integration of\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution with Mendelian genetics, which had\npopulation genetics at its core, as we have seen. Proponents of the\n\u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d, or EES, argue that the\nmain principle of the MS\u2014that adaptive evolution arises from\nnatural selection acting on sporadic genetic mutation\u2014is not\nwrong but is not the whole story either, and needs supplementation in\nthe light of recent discoveries (Pigliucci and Muller eds. 2010;\nLaland et al. 2014, 2015). They point to phenomena such as niche\nconstruction, epigenetic inheritance, multi-level selection,\nphenotypic plasticity and developmental bias, which, they claim, do\nnot fit easily with the MS\u2019s emphasis on gene-based evolution.\nThe EES\u2019s proponents are typically somewhat suspicious of\npopulation genetics, and seek to downplay its explanatory\nsignificance. However, their views are controversial. Defenders of the\ntraditional MS argue that the empirical phenomena in question are of\nrelatively minor evolutionary importance and / or that they can be\naccommodated within the MS without any major paradigm shift (Wray et\nal. 2014; Walsh and Lynch 2018; Charlesworth, Barton and Charlesworth\n2017). This debate looks set to continue.\n\nDespite the criticisms levelled against it, population genetics has\ncertainly had a major influence on our understanding of evolution. For\nexample, the well-known \u2018gene\u2019s eye\u2019 view of\nevolution, developed by G.C. Williams (1966), W. D. Hamilton (1964)\nand R. Dawkins (1976), stems directly from population-genetic\nreasoning; indeed, important aspects of gene\u2019s eye thinking were\nalready present in Fisher\u2019s writings (Okasha 2008, Ewens 2011).\nProponents of the gene\u2019s eye view argue that genes are the real\nbeneficiaries of the evolutionary process; genotypes and organisms are\nmere temporary manifestations. Natural selection is at root a matter\nof competition between gene lineages for greater representation in the\ngene pool; creating organisms with adaptive features is a\n\u2018strategy\u2019 that genes have devised to secure their\nposterity (Dawkins 1976, 1982). Gene\u2019s eye thinking has\nrevolutionised many areas of evolutionary biology in the last fifty\nyears, particularly in the field of animal behaviour (cf. Agren 2021),\nbut in many ways it is simply a colourful gloss on the conception of\nevolution implicit in the formalisms of population genetics.\n6. Philosophical and Conceptual Issues in Population Genetics\n\nPopulation genetics raises a number of interesting conceptual and\nphilosophical issues. One such issue concerns the concept of the gene\nitself. As we have seen, population genetics came into being in the\n1920s and 1930s, long before the molecular structure of genes had been\ndiscovered. In these pre-molecular days, the gene was a theoretical\nentity, postulated in order to explain observed patterns of\ninheritance in breeding experiments; what genes were made of, how they\ncaused phenotypic changes, and how they were transmitted from parent\nto offspring were not known. Today we do know the answers to these\nquestions, thanks to the spectacular success of molecular genetics and\ngenomics. The gene has gone from being a theoretical entity to being\nsomething that can actually be manipulated in the laboratory.\n\nThe relationship between the gene of classical (pre-molecular)\ngenetics, and the gene of modern molecular genetics is a subtle and\nmuch discussed topic (Beurton, Falk and Rheinberger (eds.) 2000,\nGriffiths and Stotz 2006, Moss 2003, Meunier 2022). In molecular\ngenetics, \u2018gene\u2019 refers, more or less, to a stretch of DNA\nthat codes for a particular protein\u2014so a gene is a unit of\nfunction. But in classical population genetics, \u2018gene\u2019\nrefers, more or less, to a portion of hereditary material that is\ninherited intact across generations\u2014so a gene is a unit of\ntransmission, not a unit of function. In many cases, the two concepts\nof gene will pick out roughly the same entities\u2014which has led\nsome philosophers to argue that classical genetics can be\n\u2018reduced\u2019 to molecular genetics (Sarkar 1998). But it is\nclear that the two concepts do not have precisely the same extension;\nnot every molecular gene is a classical gene, nor vice-versa. Some\ntheorists go further than this, arguing that what molecular biology\nreally shows is that there are no such things as classical genes.\n\nWhatever one\u2019s view of this debate, it is striking that\nvirtually all of the central concepts of population genetics were\ndevised in the pre-molecular era, when so little was known about what\ngenes were; the basic structure of population-genetic theory has\nchanged little since the days of Fisher, Haldane and Wright\n(Charlesworth and Charlesworth 2017). This reflects the fact that the\nempirical presuppositions of population-genetic models are really\nquite slim; the basic presupposition is simply the existence of\nhereditary particles that obey the Mendelian rules of transmission,\nand that somehow affect the phenotype. Therefore, even without\nknowing what these hereditary particles are made of, or how they exert\ntheir phenotypic effects, the early population geneticists were able\nto devise an impressive body of theory. That the theory continues to\nbe useful today illustrates the power of abstract models in\nscience.\n\nThis leads us to another facet of population genetics that has\nattracted philosophers\u2019 attention: the way in which abstract\nmodels, that involve simplifying assumptions known to be false, can\nilluminate actual empirical phenomena. Idealized models of this sort\nplay a central role in many sciences, including physics, economics and\nbiology, and raise interesting methodological issues. In particular,\nthere is often a trade-off between realism and tractability; the more\nrealistic a model the more complicated it becomes, which typically\nlimits its usefulness and its range of applicability. This general\nproblem and others like it have been extensively discussed in the\nphilosophical literature on modelling (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2006,\nWeisberg 2006, Frigg and Hartmann 2006), and are related to population\ngenetics by Plutynski (2006).\n\nIt is clear that population genetics models rely on assumptions known\nto be false, and are subject to the realism / tractability trade-off.\nThe simplest population-genetic models assume random mating,\nnon-overlapping generations, infinite population size, perfect\nMendelian segregation, frequency-independent genotype fitnesses, and\nthe absence of stochastic effects; it is very unlikely (and in the\ncase of the infinite population assumption, impossible) that any of\nthese assumptions hold true of any actual biological population. More\nrealistic models, that relax one of more of the above assumptions,\nhave been constructed, but they are invariably much harder to analyze.\nIt is an interesting historical question whether these\n\u2018standard\u2019 population-genetic assumptions were originally\nmade because they simplified the mathematics, or because they were\nbelieved to be a reasonable approximation to reality, or both. This\nquestion is taken up by Morrison (2004, 2014) in relation to\nFisher\u2019s early population-genetic work.\n\nAnother philosophical issue raised by population genetics is\nreductionism. It is often argued that the population-genetic view of\nevolution is inherently reductionistic, by both its critics and its\ndefenders. This is apparent from how population geneticists define\nevolution: change in gene frequency. Implicit in this definition is\nthe idea that evolutionary phenomena such as speciation, adaptive\nradiation and diversification, as well as phenotypic evolution, can\nultimately be reduced to gene frequency change. But do we really know\nthis to be true? Many biologists, particularly \u2018whole\norganism\u2019 biologists, are not convinced, and thus reject both\nthe population-genetic definition of evolution and the primacy\ntraditionally accorded to population genetics within evolutionary\nbiology (Pigliucci 2008).\n\nThis is a large question, and is related to the issues discussed in\nsection 5 above. The question can be usefully divided into two: (i)\ncan microevolutionary processes explain all of evolution?; (ii) can\nall of microevolution be reduced to population genetics?\n\u2018Microevolution\u2019 refers to evolutionary changes that take\nplace within a given population, over relatively short periods of time\n(e.g., a few hundred generations). These changes typically involve the\nsubstitution of a gene for its alleles, of exactly the sort modelled\nby population genetics. So over microevolutionary time-scales, we do\nnot typically expect to see extinction, speciation or major\nmorphological change \u2014 phenomena which are called\n\u2018macroevolutionary\u2019. Many biologists believe that\nmacroevolution is simply \u2018microevolution writ large\u2019, but\nthis view is not universal. Authors such as Gould (2002) and Eldredge\n(1989), for example, have argued persuasively that macroevolutionary\nphenomena are governed by autonomous dynamics, irreducible to a\nmicroevolutionary basis. Philosophical discussions of this issue\ninclude Sterelny (1996), Grantham (1995) and Okasha (2006). A useful\noverview is provided by Turner and Havstad (2019).\n\nSetting aside the reducibility of macro to microevolution, there is\nstill the issue of whether an exclusively population-genetic approach\nto the latter is satisfactory. Some reasons for doubting this have\nbeen discussed already; they include the complexity of the\ngenotype-phenotype relation, the fact that population genetics treats\ndevelopment as a black-box, and the idealizing assumptions that its\nmodels rest on. Another point, not discussed above, is the fact that\npopulation genetics models are (deliberately) silent about the\ncauses of the fitness differences between genotypes whose\nconsequences they model (Sober 1984, Glymour 2006). For example, in\nthe simple one-locus model of section 3.1, nothing is said about why\nthe three genotypes leave different numbers of successful gametes. To\nfully understand evolution, the ecological factors that lead to these\nfitness differences must also be understood. While this is a valid\npoint, the most it shows is that an exclusively population-genetic\napproach cannot yield a complete understanding of the evolutionary\nprocess. This does not really threaten the traditional view that\npopulation genetics is fundamental to evolutionary theory.\n\nA final suite of philosophical issues surrounding population genetics\nconcerns causation. Evolutionary biology is standardly thought of as a\nscience that yields causal explanations: it tells us the causes of\nparticular evolutionary phenomena (Okasha 2009, Otsuka 2016a). This\ncausal dimension to evolutionary explanations is echoed in population\ngenetics, where selection, mutation, migration and random drift are\noften described as causes, or \u2018forces\u2019, that lead to gene\nfrequency change (Sober 1984). The basis for this way of speaking is\nobvious enough. If the frequency of allele \\(A\\) in a population\nincreases from one generation to another, and if the population obeys\nthe rules of Mendelian inheritance, then as a matter of logic one of\nthree things must have happened: (I) migrants bearing allele\n\\(A\\) entered the population (II); there was mutation to allele\n\\(A\\) from another allele; (III) the average number of\ndescendants left by each copy of \\(A\\) in the parental generation\nexceeded the average for all genes. It is straightforward to verify\nthat if none of (I)\u2013(III) occurred, then the frequency of allele\n\\(A\\) would have been unchanged. Note that case (III) covers both\nselection and random drift, depending on whether copies of \\(A\\)\nleft more descendants than average by chance, or because of some\nsystematic effect of \\(A\\) on organismic fitness.\n\nDespite this point, a number of philosophers have objected to the idea\nthat evolutionary change can usefully be thought of as caused by\ndifferent factors, including natural selection (e.g., Matthen and\nAriew 2009, Walsh 2007). A variety of objections to this apparently\ninnocent way of speaking have been levelled; some of these seem to be\nobjections to the metaphor of \u2018forces\u2019 in particular,\nwhile others turn on more general considerations to do with causality\nand chance. The status of these objections is a controversial matter;\nsee Reisman and Forber (2005), Brandon and Ramsey (2007), Sarkar\n(2011) and in particular Otsuka (2016b) for critical discussion. The\n\u2018non-causal\u2019 (or \u2018statisticalist\u2019 as it is\nsometimes called) view of evolution is certainly a radical one, since\nthe idea that natural selection, in particular, is a potential cause\nof evolutionary change is virtually axiomatic in evolutionary biology,\nand routinely taught to students of the subject. As Millstein (2002)\npoints out, if one abandons this view it becomes hard to make sense of\nimportant episodes in the history of evolutionary biology, such as the\nselectionist / neutralist controversy mentioned above.\n\nA full resolution of this issue cannot be attempted here; however, it\nis worth making one observation about the idea that mutation,\nselection, migration and drift should be regarded as\n\u2018causes\u2019 of gene frequency change. There is an important\ndifference between drift on the one hand and the other three factors\non the other. This is because mutation, selection and migration are\ndirectional; they typically lead to a non-zero expected change in gene\nfrequencies (Rice 2004 p. 132). Random drift on the other hand is\nnon-directional; the expected change due to drift is by definition\nzero. As Rice (2004) points out, this means that mutation, selection\nand migration can each be represented by a vector field on the space\nof gene frequencies; their combined effects on the overall\nevolutionary change is then represented by ordinary vector addition\n(which arguably lends substance of the \u201cforce\u201d metaphor).\nBut drift cannot be treated this way, for it has a magnitude but not a\ndirection. In so far as proponents of the \u2018non-causal\u2019\nview are motivated by the oddity of regarding drift, or chance, as a\nforce, they have a point. However this line of argument is specific to\nrandom drift; it does not generalize to all the factors that affect\ngene frequency change. And it does not alter the fact that, in\nattributing the spread of a gene to random drift, we have given a\nbona fide scientific explanation that is potentially falsifiable; for\nwe have said that the gene\u2019s spread was not due to any\nsystematic advantage that the gene conferred on organisms that had it.\n\n\nA final area of philosophical concern to which population genetics is\nrelevant is the debate over the status of racial categories. This is a\ncentral topic within the philosophy of race, a burgeoning sub-field of\nphilosophy (see the entry on\n race\n for an overview). One influential line of argument has it that racial\ncategories are social constructions rather than natural kinds. On this\nview, the division of the human species into distinct\n\u201craces\u201d (which can be done in multiple ways), should be\nunderstood primarily in terms of the social and political role that such\nracial categories play. This view is sometimes called\n\u201canti-realism\u201d about race, since it holds that the usual\nways of dividing humans into races (as employed in national censuses,\nfor example) are conventional rather than real. Opponents of\nanti-realism have sometimes drawn on human population genetics to\nbolster the rival position that racial divisions are in fact real\n(Andreasen 2007, Sesardic 2010, Spencer 2015). Empirical studies of\nhow genetic variation in humans is structured, using machine learning\ntechniques, have found genetic clusters that appear to roughly\ncorrespond to certain broad racial groupings (such as\n\u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cEurasian\u201d) (Rosenberg et al.\n2002, Li et al. 2008). However, the precise bearing of these empirical\nresults on the question of the reality versus conventionality of\nracial divisions is a matter of ongoing philosophical dispute (Kopec\n2014, Winther 2014).\n\nTo conclude, there are a number of interesting philosophical issues\nsurrounding population genetics discussed in the recent literature. In\naddition to these, population genetics is indirectly relevant to a\nstill broader set of philosophical concerns, given its centrality to\nevolutionary biology, a science replete with implications for many\nbranches of philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Agren, J.A., 2021, <em>The Gene\u2019s Eye View of\nEvolution</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Amundson, R., 2007, <em>The Changing Role of the Embryo in\nEvolutionary Thought</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Andreasen, R., 2007, \u2018Biological Conceptions of Race\u2019,\nin D.
