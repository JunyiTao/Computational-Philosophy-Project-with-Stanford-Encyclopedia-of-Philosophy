Intelligent Design and Traditional Creationism\n\nLet us now try to tackle the somewhat complex issue of the\nrelationship between Intelligent Design Theory and traditional\nCreationism, as discussed earlier in this essay. In significant\nrespects, they are clearly not the same. Most Intelligent Design\nTheorists believe in a long earth history (even the scientific\nestimation of a universe of about 15 billion years in age) and most\naccept overall common descent. In a recent book, The Edge of\nEvolution , Michael Behe has made this point very clear indeed.\nHowever, there are major overlaps, sufficient to encourage some\ncritics (myself included) to refer to Intelligent Design Theory as\n\u2018Creationism-lite\u2019 (Ruse 2017, 114).\n\nFirst, politically, the Creationists are more than willing at the\nmoment to let the ID theorists do the blocking. Openly they support\nthe ID movement, believing in taking one step at a time. If ID is\nsuccessful, then is the time to ask for more. A major funding and\nemotional support for the ID movement is the Discovery Institute, a\nprivately-supported think tank in Seattle. One of its prominent\nmembers is University of Chicago educated philosopher Paul Nelson, who\nis a young-earth creationist and a strong believer in the\neschatological significance of Israel.\n\nSecond, do note that both Creationists and ID enthusiasts are\ncommitted to some form of non-naturalist account of origins. The ties\nof course are stronger. ID enthusiasts pretend to be neutral about the\nIntelligent Designer, but they clearly do not think that he or she is\nnatural. No one pretends that the earth and its denizens are a lab\nexperiment being run by a grad student on Andromeda. In fact, in their\nown correspondence and works written for followers, they make it very\nclear that the Designer is the Christian God of the Gospels. They are\nalways quoting the first chapter of John \u2013 \u201cIn the\nbeginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was\nGod.\u201d So in both cases we have an evangelical Christian motive\nsetting the agenda on origins. Some ID enthusiasts are quite strong\nliteralists. Johnson for instance thinks that Genesis Chapter Six\nmight be right about their beings giants in early times \u2013 a\npoint made much of in Genesis Flood. (Forrest and Gross 2004 do a\nsuperb job of ferreting out much of the unstated biblical foundations\nof Intelligent Design Theory.)\n\nThird there is the moral factor. There is a very strong streak of\nanti-postmillennialism in the writings of ID theorists. They share the\nsame concern about the moral values of the Creationists \u2013\nanti-abortion, anti-homosexuality, pro-capital punishment, pro-Israel\n(for eschatological reasons) and so forth. Phillip Johnson feels very\nstrongly that the tendency to cross-dress, including apparently women\nwho wear jeans, is a sign of the degenerate state of our society\n(Johnson 2002). \n\nIn short, while there are certainly important differences between the\nposition of most literalists and most ID supporters, the strong\noverlap should not be ignored or downplayed.\n",
