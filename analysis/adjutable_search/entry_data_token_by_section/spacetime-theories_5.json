    "main_text": "Einstein || Relations Determine State of Motion?\n2.1 Relations Determine State of Motion?\n\nIn this subsection we will discuss an interesting sense in which, in\nSTR, the letter (if not the spirit) of classical relationism can be\nconsidered vindicated: the spatio-temporal relations between material\nthings are, on their own, sufficient to fully determine the state of\nmotion of a body. The discussion here presupposes acquaintance with\nSTR and its basic mathematics, and will be hard to follow for readers\nlacking that background; such readers should feel free to skip this\nsubsection, which is not necessary for following the material in the\nrest of section 2.\n\nAs Dorling (1978) first pointed out, there is a sense in which the\nstandard absolutist arguments against \u2018strict\u2019 relationism\nusing rotating objects (buckets or globes) fail in the context of STR.\nMaudlin (1993) used the same considerations to show that there is a\nway of recasting relationism in STR that appears to be successful. STR\nincorporates certain novelties concerning the nature of time and\nspace, and how they mesh together; perhaps the best-known examples are\nthe phenomena of \u2018length contraction\u2019, \u2018time\ndilation\u2019, and the \u2018relativity of\n simultaneity.\u2019[4]\n In STR both spatial distances and time intervals between events\n\u2013 when measured in the standard ways \u2013 are frame-relative\n(observers in different states of motion, i.e. at rest in different\nreference frames, will \u2018disagree\u2019 about their sizes). The\nstandard classical relationist starting point \u2013 the\nconfiguration of relative distances between the existing bodies at\na moment of time \u2013 does not exist, at least not as an\nobjective, observer- or frame-independent set of facts. Because of\nthis, when considering what spatial or temporal relations a\nrelationist should postulate as fundamental, it is arguably most\nnatural to restrict oneself to the frame-invariant spatiotemporal\n\u2018distance\u2019 between events in spacetime. This is given by\nthe interval between two points: \\([\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 +\n\\Delta z^2 - \\Delta t^2]\\) \u2013 the four-dimensional analog of the\nPythagorean theorem, for spacetime distances. If one regards the\nspacetime interval relations between point-masses-at-times as\none\u2019s basis, on which spacetime is built up as an ideal entity\n(analogously to how Leibniz thought of 3-d space as an ideal entity\nabstracted from spatial distance relations), then with only mild\ncaveats relationism works: the spacetime interval relations suffice to\nuniquely fix how the material systems can be embedded (up to\nisomorphism) in the \u2018Minkowski\u2019 spacetime of STR. The\nmodern variants of Newton\u2019s bucket and globes arguments no\nlonger stymie the relationist because (for example) the spacetime\ninterval relations among bits of matter in Newton\u2019s bucket at\nrest are quite different from the spacetime interval relations found\namong those same bits of matter after the bucket is rotating. For\nexample, the spacetime interval relation between a bit of\nwater near the side of the bucket, at one time, and itself (say) a\nsecond later is smaller than the interval relation between a\ncenter-bucket bit of water and itself one second later (times referred\nto inertial-frame clocks). The upshot is that, unlike the situation in\nclassical physics, a non-rotating body cannot have all the same\nspatiotemporal relations among its parts as a similar body in\nrotation. We cannot put a body or system into a state of rotation (or\nother acceleration) without thereby changing the spacetime interval\nrelations between the various bits of matter at different moments of\ntime, compared to what they would have been if the body had remained\nnon-accelerated or non-rotated. The facts about rotation and\nacceleration, thus, supervene on spacetime interval\n relations.[5]\n\nIt is worth pausing to consider to what extent this victory for (some\nform of) relationism satisfies the classical \u2018strict\u2019\nrelationism traditionally ascribed to Mach and Leibniz. The\nspatiotemporal relations that save the day against the bucket and\nglobes are, so to speak, mixed spatial and temporal distances. They\nare thus quite different from the spatial-distances-at-a-time\npresupposed by classical relationists; moreover they do not correspond\nto relative velocities (-at-a-time) either. Their oddity is forcefully\ncaptured by noticing that if we choose appropriate bits of matter at\n\u2018times\u2019 eight minutes apart, I-now am at zero\ndistance from the surface of the sun (of eight minutes\n\u2018past\u2019, since it took 8 minutes for light from the sun to\nreach me-now). So we are by no means dealing here with an innocuous,\n\u2018natural\u2019 translation of classical relationist quantities\ninto the STR setting. On the other hand, in light of the relativity of\nsimultaneity (see\n footnote 5),\n it can be argued that the absolute simultaneity presupposed by\nclassical relationists and absolutists alike was, in fact, something\nthat relationists should always have regarded with misgivings. From\nthis perspective, instantaneous relational configurations \u2013\nprecisely what one starts with in the theories of Barbour and Bertotti\ndiscussed below \u2013 would be the things that should be treated\nwith suspicion.\n\nIf we now return to our questions about motions \u2013 about the\nnature of velocities and accelerations \u2013 we find, as noted\nabove, that matters in the interval-relational interpretation of STR\nare much the same as in Newtonian mechanics in Galilean spacetime.\nThere are no well-defined absolute velocities, but there are indeed\nwell-defined absolute accelerations and rotations. In fact, the\ndifference between an accelerating body (e.g., a rocket) and an\ninertially moving body is codified directly in the cross-temporal\ninterval relations of the body with itself. So we are very\nfar from being able to conclude that all motion is relative motion of\na body with respect to other bodies. It is true that the\nabsolute motions are in 1\u20131 correlation with patterns of\nspacetime interval relations, but it is not at all correct to say that\nthey are, for that reason, eliminable in favor of merely relative\nmotions. Rather we should simply say that no absolute acceleration can\nfail to have an effect on the material body or bodies accelerated. But\nthis was already true in classical physics if matter is modeled\nrealistically: the cord connecting the globes does not merely tense,\nbut also stretches; and so does the bucket, even if imperceptibly,\ni.e., the spatial relations change.\n\nMaudlin does not claim this version of relationism to be victorious\nover an absolutist or substantivalist conception of Minkowski\nspacetime, when it comes time to make judgments about the\ntheory\u2019s ontology. There may be more to vindicating relationism\nthan merely establishing a 1\u20131 correlation between absolute\nmotions and patterns of spatiotemporal relations.\n",
