    "main_text": "Associationism as a Theory of Mental Structure || Extinction and Counterconditioning\n4.4 Extinction and Counterconditioning\nThere is a different, tighter relationship between associative\nlearning and associative structures concerning how to modulate an\nassociation. Associative theorists, especially from Pavlov onward,\nhave been clear on the functional characteristics necessary to\nmodulate an already created association. There have been two generally\nagreed upon routes: extinction\nand counterconditioning. Suppose that, through associative\nlearning, you have learned to associate a CS with a US. How do we\nbreak that association? Associationists have posited that one breaks\nan associative structure via two different types of\nassociative learning (/unlearning). Extinction is the name\nfor one such process. During extinction one decouples the external\npresentation of the CS and the US by presenting the CS without the US\n(and sometimes the US without the CS). Over time, the organism will\nlearn to disconnect the CS and US.\nCounterconditioning names a similar process to extinction,\nthough one which proceeds via a slightly different method.\nCounterconditioning can only occur when an organism has an\nassociation between a mental representation and a valence, as\nacquired in an evaluative conditioning paradigm. Suppose that one\nassociates\n ducks with a positive valence. To break this association\nvia counterconditioning one introduces ducks not with a lack of\npositive valence (as would happen in extinction) but with the\nopposite valence, a negative valence. Over multiple\nexposures, the initial representation/valence association weakens,\n and is perhaps completely \nbroken.[21]\nHow successful extinction and counterconditioning are, and how they\nwork, is the source of some controversy, and some reason to see both methods as highly ineffectual (Bouton 2004). Although the traditional\nview is that extinction breaks associative bonds, it is an open\nempirical question whether extinction proceeds by breaking the\npreviously created associative bonds, or whether it proceeds by\nleaving that bond alone but creating new, more salient (and perhaps\ncontext-specific) associations between the CS and other mental states (Bouton 2002, Bendana and Mandelbaum forthcoming). Additionally, reinstatement, the spontaneous\nreappearance of an associative bond after seemingly successful\nextinction, has been observed in many contexts (see, e.g., Dirikx et\nal. 2004 for\n reinstatement of fear in \nhumans).[22]\nOne fixed point in this debate is that one reverses associative\nstructures via these two types of associative learning/unlearning, and\nonly via these two pathways. What one does not do is try to\nbreak an associative structure by using practical or theoretical\nreasoning. If you associate\n salt with\n pepper, then telling you that\nsalt has nothing to do with pepper or giving you very good reasons\nnot to associate the two (say, someone will give you $50,000 for not\nassociating them) won\u2019t affect the association. This much has at\nleast been clear since Locke. In the Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding, in his chapter \u201cOn the Association of\nIdeas\u201d (chapter XXIII) he writes,\n\nWhen this combination is settled, and while it lasts, it is not in\nthe power of reason to help us, and relieve us from the effects of it.\nIdeas in our minds, when they are there, will operate according to\ntheir natures and circumstances. And here we see the cause why time\ncures certain affections, which reason, though in the right, and\nallowed to be so, has not power over, nor is able against them to\nprevail with those who are apt to hearken to it in other\ncases. (2.23.13)\n\nLikewise, say one has just eaten lutefisk and then vomited. The\nsmell and taste of lutefisk will then be associated with feeling\nnauseated, and no amount of telling one that they shouldn\u2019t be\nnauseated will be very effective. Say the lutefisk that made one\nvomit was covered in poison, so that we know that the lutefisk\nwasn\u2019t the root cause of the\n sickness.[23]\nHaving this knowledge won\u2019t dislodge the association. In\nessence, associative structures are functionally defined as being\nfungible based on counterconditioning, extinction, and nothing\nelse. Thus, assuming one sees counterconditioning and extinction as\ntypes of associative learning, we can say that associative learning\ndoes not necessarily eventuate in associative structures, but\nassociative structures can only be modified by associative\nlearning.\n",
