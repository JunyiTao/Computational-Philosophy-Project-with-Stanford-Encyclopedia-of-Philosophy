    "main_text": "Toward the Aufbau || Der Raum\n2.2 Der Raum\n\nFor Carnap the basis for \u201cgoal-oriented reason\u201d could only\nbe a comprehensive system of knowledge, and this exhortation to remove\nthe design of our system of the sciences \u201cfrom the realm of\nchaotic whim\u201d, and to \u201csubordinate\u201d it to\n\u201cgoal-oriented reason\u201d reverberates throughout his early\nphilosophical papers (e.g., Carnap 1923: 107), which have now been\npublished together with English translations in Carnap (2019). In the\neditors\u2019 introduction to this new edition it is argued that this\nprogram was not just a momentary response to a particular crisis, but\ncontinued to inform the architectonic of Carnap\u2019s philosophy\nthroughout its development. This is hardly disputed with respect to\nthe immediately following stages of Carnap\u2019s career, addressing\nthe nature and design of the system of knowledge\u2014his\ndissertation on philosophical problems of space and geometry, Der\nRaum (1922a) and other early papers. Der Raum\n[Space] prefigures later works in its effort to disentangle\nvarious meanings of the word \u201cspace\u201d and to show that\nphilosophical confusion had resulted from the failure to distinguish\nthem clearly. In this case, Carnap distinguishes \u201cformal\u201d,\n\u201cintuitive\u201d, and \u201cphysical\u201d space. The first\nwas a purely logical or set-theoretic construction of space; the\nsecond was built up from a version of Hilbert\u2019s axioms\nrestricted to a local, subjective space; the third was the space of\nphysics. In each case, by separate arguments, Carnap reaches the\nconclusion that the space we must assume as the precondition for any\nknowledge is not Euclidean space, as Kant had argued (and some\nKantians such as Natorp were still arguing), nor even any metric\nspace, but topological space of arbitrarily many dimensions. While\nthis represents a form of (neo-)Kantianism Carnap would soon leave\nbehind, it was tempered by the critical role of the \u201cfactual\nbasis [Tatbestand]\u201d in deciding among mathematically\npossible kinds of physical space. The factual basis was determined\nonly up to the topological relations among its elements;\nCarnap\u2019s residual Kantianism is expressed in the topologically\n\u201cnecessary form\u201d (not reaching to metrical relations) our\nperception imposes on its elements (see Heis 2011 on the neo-Kantian\nbackground in the philosophy of geometry).\n",
