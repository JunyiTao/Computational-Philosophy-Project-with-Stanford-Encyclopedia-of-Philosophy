    "main_text": "Taylor Mill\u2019s Influence on Mill || The Middle Ground\n5. Conclusion\n\nNo firm conclusions have been reached here as to what personal\nqualities Taylor Mill possessed, what if any philosophical works she\nauthored or co-authored, or how much influence she exercised over\nMill\u2019s philosophical career. All that has been attempted is to\npresent the wide range of answers that have been given to these\nquestions. The available evidence may be too sparse and too\ncontradictory for us ever to arrive at definitive answers. Taylor Mill\nmay therefore be destined to remain an essentially contested figure in\nthe history of philosophy.\n",
