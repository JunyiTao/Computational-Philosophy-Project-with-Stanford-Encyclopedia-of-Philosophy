    "main_text": "Nicholas\u2019 Thought\n2. Nicholas\u2019 Thought\n\nNicholas of Cusa may arguably be best understood as employing a\nChristian Neoplatonic framework to construct his own synthesis of\ninherited ideas. His thought witnesses to his own reading in a variety\nof predecessors, while side-stepping the methods of the medieval\nscholastic summae and their typical controversies and\narguments. Trained as a canon lawyer, Nicholas is mostly self-taught\nin theology and philosophy; both his ideas and his language may\npresent some difficulties to contemporary readers. His thought has to\nbe viewed as a whole, for it works more by correspondences and\nparallels between the domains he is interested in expounding than in a\nlinear fashion or by direct argument. What is noteworthy are the\nflexible metaphors he uses as he moves across what we designate today\nas ontology, philosophy of mind and epistemology, and philosophical\ntheology. His metaphors provide some methodological clue to\nunderstanding how Nicholas proposes that we should think God and\ncreatures together. It is not just that God exceeds our conceptual\nreach and grasp as well as our literal language. The asymmetry between\nGod and creatures also provides a measure or norm for the\nappropriateness of any metaphor exploring or attempting to explain\ntheir relationship.\n",
