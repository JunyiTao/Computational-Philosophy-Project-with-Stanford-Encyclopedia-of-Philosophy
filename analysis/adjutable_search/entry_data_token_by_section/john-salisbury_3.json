    "main_text": "Moderation\n4. Moderation\n\nJohn\u2019s admiration for temperate Academic skepticism supports\nwhat is among the key themes of his philosophy: modestia or\nmoderatio. He was a convinced adherent of an\nAristotelian-tinged doctrine that virtue necessarily consists in the\nmean, and that moderation in all things is the most valid standard for\njudging human thought and action (Nederman 1997). As John points out\nin the Entheticus, the Academic stance is consonant with\n\n\na modest mind \u2026 that no one may accuse it of being guilty of\nfalsehood; it thus tempers all words with qualifiers, so that it\nshould always be rightly credible. (EMM, ll. 155\u201358)\n\n\nJohn stresses that the possessors of such a modest mind\n\u201crestrain their words according to condition, time, cause, and\nmanner, [and] they avoid speaking with too much simplicity\u201d\n(EMM, ll. 161\u201362). Academic moderation results in rhetorical and\nintellectual humility, if not caution, consistent with the virtuous\nmean.\n\nThe counsel of moderation as crucial to any form of virtue permeates\nJohn\u2019s later corpus as well. In the Metalogicon, he\ninsists that education has a definite ethical component that requires\nrecognition and examination. As he acknowledges in his prefatory\nremarks,\n\n\nI have deliberately included a number of comments on moral issues,\nsince my view is that everything that is read or written is valueless\nexcept in so far as it affords support to the way we live. Any\nprofession of philosophy whatsoever is valueless and deceitful if it\ndoes manifest itself in the cultivation of virtue and the conduct of\nour lives. (ML: 122)\n\n\nMaking men virtuous is not a distinct enterprise from making them\nintelligent or knowledgeable; it is worthless to be well-educated if\none is unable to apply this learning in the service of moral\nrectitude. Moreover, the very techniques one employs in the\nacquisition of knowledge are subject to ethical evaluation and\njudgment. Proper learning is defined not only by the quantity of\nknowledge inculcated, but by the quality of the educational\nexperience. John believes that the doctrine of moderation and the\nvirtuous mean is essential to any pedagogy which takes seriously its\nduty to mold morals as well as intellect.\n\nThe theme of moderation appears most prominently in the\nMetalogicon\u2019s discussion of the correct attitude that\nthe student ought to adopt toward his subject matter. Intellectual\ndiscipline, John asserts, arises out of adherence to a mean course\nbetween the overzealous pursuit of all topics and an absence of\nintellectual curiosity: \u201cIf, however, there is no moderation,\nall these qualities [of the mind] turn to their opposites. Subtlety is\nreft of its utility\u201d (ML: 194). The mind must first discriminate\namong its potential subjects of study in order to eliminate those that\nare unsuitable, namely, matters that pertain to God alone as well as\n\u201cthings which are harmful; \u2026 from which come pain, anger,\ncupidity, and their followers, envy, hate, slander, lechery and vanity\n\u2026\u201d (ML: 299). Yet, excessive caution yields an intellect\nthat resists inquiry into new or foreign territory. John maintains\nthat proper philosophical investigation demands careful reflection\nupon the boundaries of one\u2019s intelligence in consort with the\ncorrect application of our God-given powers of reason (ML:\n180\u201382).\n\nJohn extends his discussion of intellectual moderation to pedagogical\npractice, such that a moderate attitude toward study is manifested in\nthe extent of materials one consults. The Metalogicon warns\nthat\n\n\nto follow up what some one even of the most contemptible of men has\never said is a sign either of complete masochism or of empty top-show,\nand it impedes and overwhelms minds which would be better off spending\ntheir time on other things. (ML: 177)\n\n\nThe well-trained scholar will survey those authorities who are\ndeserving of respect, while ignoring works that do not merit effort\nand attention. Equally importantly, learning ought not to be an\nall-consuming, exclusive (and therefore excessive) way of life.\nRather,\n\n\nintelligence must \u2026 be carefully cultivated under the control\nboth of study and of relaxation, the former designed to give it\nstrength, the latter encouragement \u2026 Intelligence starts with\nnature, is assisted by practice, is dulled by excess of toil, and is\nsharpened by controlled exercise. (ML: 148)\n\n\nThe overzealous scholar courts counterproductive conduct, if not the\nperil of his soul.\n\nThe notion that wisdom entails a moderate cast of mind forms the basis\nfor John\u2019s criticism of pedagogical techniques then current in\nthe schools. The temper of the times discourages observation of the\nmean, so that instructors prompt students to all manner of\nintellectual excess. Disputations are conducted without concern for\ntime, place, or topic, in spite of the fact that\n\n\nAristotle ought to have checked this immoderation on the part of those\nwho identify indiscriminate volubility with the exercise of dialectic.\n(ML: 196)\n\n\nIt is on grounds of immoderation that John objects to the unrestrained\nuse of the verbal duel:\n\n\nA voluble tongue \u2026 throws one\u2019s life into confusion, and,\nunless checked by the curb of moderation, drives one\u2019s whole\nbeing headlong. (ML: 195\u201396; translation slightly altered)\n\n\nHe has observed this situation, he says, at first hand. After visiting\nformer school associates from Paris, John reports his disappointment,\nfinding that \u201c[t]hey had made progress\u2014in just this one\nthing that, having unlearned moderation, they had thereby lost all\nmodesty\u201d (ML: 201). For like reasons, the Metalogicon\nurges re-evaluation of the contemporary practices associated with\nphilosophical studies. When logic and dialectic are employed without\nregard for the pursuit of wisdom, when their practice moves beyond the\nmean, when, in sum, philosophy becomes immoderately fond of its own\nimage, the goal of wisdom ceases to be paramount and such study is\nsterile and pointless.\n\nThe theme of moderation likewise infuses the Policraticus,\nthe audience for which was two-fold: first, courtiers and other\nso-called \u201cbureaucrats\u201d (per Forhan 1985) who serve the\ninterests of the realm; and second, rulers who are ultimately\nresponsible for maintaining peace and justice in their kingdoms.\nJohn\u2019s primary concern is to illuminate the vices of kings and\ntheir servants in order to instruct them in the forms of behavior\nappropriate to men of status and power. But John adopts a realistic\napproach, explicitly acknowledging that the demands of an ascetic\nmorality are unsuitable for such people. Since John intended the\nPolicraticus to be a practical guidebook, he was prepared to\nallow that\n\n\nif moderation is displayed, I do not judge it unbecoming \u2026 to\ndwell at times upon the pleasures of the senses; as has been said,\nnothing is unseemly that is beyond measure \u2026 Modestly pursued\nfor purposes of recreation, they are excused upon the license of\nleisure. (FCP: 373)\n\n\nJohn orients the value of moderation toward the actual conditions\nunder which courtiers and princes live. But there is an implicit\npolitical warning: Those in positions of leadership must not become so\nin thrall to such pursuits that these become ends in themselves and\nthe business of the kingdom suffers.\n\nMore broadly, John harnesses the principle of moderation to a general\ntheory of virtue, one that has important consequences for his\npolitical as well as moral thought. It is central to John\u2019s\ndoctrine throughout the Policraticus that if any action\n\n\nexceeds the mean, it is a fault. Every virtue is marked by its own\nboundaries, and consists in the mean. If one exceeds this, one is off\nthe road, not on it. (FCP: 157)\n\n\nBad men \u201c\u2018withdraw from the mean between vices, which is\nthe field of virtue\u2019\u201d (FCP: 374). But John by no means\nendorses zealotry. Employing the metaphor of the left and right hands,\nJohn observes that\n\n\nto stray to the right is to insist vehemently upon the virtues\nthemselves [that is, to be fanatical]. To stray to the left is to\nexceed the mean in works of virtue, which consists in the mean. Truly\nall vehemence is inimical to salvation, and all excess is in error; an\nexcess of goodness and of habitually good deeds is very evil. (PC:\n53)\n\n\nWhile this view may seem strange for an orthodox churchman to assert,\nit reveals the extent of John\u2019s concern about how his audience\nmight interpret his remarks. All virtues by nature may be attained\nonly when pursued within definite limits, and so he is not expecting\ncourtiers to be saints. Almost certainly referring to Aristotle, John\nremarks that\n\n\nthe philosopher says: Beware that which is excessive because if one\nabandons this cautious moderation itself, to that extent does one\nwithdraw incautiously from the path of virtue \u2026 What, therefore\nis advanced by excess, if the queen of the virtues, justice, perishes\nin its excessiveness? (PC: 54)\n\n\nOverstepping good in the name of goodness itself is as repugnant as\nthe utter absence of moral propriety.\n\nTo determine the virtuous mean in any specific circumstance, John\nadvances an essentially Ciceronian standard: \u201cDiscretion with\nregard to time, place, amount, person and cause readily draws the\nproper distinction\u201d between virtuous and vicious actions.\nIndeed, one might understand John to advocate a sort of\ncircumstantialist\u2014though by no means relativist\u2014moral\ntheory, since discretion \u201cis the origin and source of moderation\nin its widest sense without which no duty is properly performed\u201d\n(FCP: 373). Attention to context is required, for John, to guide the\ndeterminations one ought to make of what constitutes virtuous\nbehavior. Thus, it is clearly vicious to take a human life, yet as a\nform of punishment or as the result of a justly fought battle, it may\nbe vicious not to take a life. This conception of virtue\nposits the identification of a morally correct action as a sort of\nmoving target, rather than a fixed moral absolute that applies at all\ntimes and in all places. This seems to be the philosophical premise\nbehind his argument that various activities that might be viewed as\nreprehensible in themselves may be morally justifiable when conducted\nin the proper measure. In Book One of the Policraticus,\nfollowing a lengthy and scathing critique of hunting\u2014a favorite\npastime of the English aristocracy to whom he is writing\u2014John\nreverses course: \u201cThe activity, however, is laudable when\nmoderation is shown and hunting is pursued with judgment and, when\npossible, with profit\u201d (FCP: 25). The same holds for the many\nother popular courtly \u201cfrivolities\u201d. John\u2019s\noverarching aim is to keep his audience mindful of that\n\u201cmoderation without which the good life is impossible\u201d\n(FCP: 161), the very essence of which is the performance of the right\nact in the right way and in the right situation, in accordance with\none\u2019s best judgment.
