    "main_text": "Varieties of Corruption\n1. Varieties of Corruption\n\nConsider one of the most popular of the standard longstanding\ndefinitions, namely, \u201cCorruption is the abuse of power by a\npublic official for private\n gain\u201d.[2]\n No doubt the abuse of public offices for private gain is paradigmatic\nof corruption. But when a bettor bribes a boxer to \u201cthrow\u201d\na fight this is corruption for private gain, but it need not involve\nany public office holder; the roles of boxer and bettor are usually\nnot public offices.\n\nOne response to this is to distinguish public corruption from private\ncorruption, and to argue that the above definition is a definition\nonly of public corruption. But if ordinary citizens lie when they give\ntestimony in court, this is corruption; it is corruption of the\ncriminal justice system. However, it does not involve abuse of a\npublic office by a public official. And when police fabricate evidence\nout of a misplaced sense of justice, this is corruption of a public\noffice, but not for private gain.\n\nIn the light of the failure of such analytical-style definitions it is\ntempting to try to sidestep the problem of providing a theoretical\naccount of the concept of corruption by simply identifying corruption\nwith specific legal and/or moral offences. However, attempts to\nidentify corruption with specific legal/moral offences are unlikely to\nsucceed. Perhaps the most plausible candidate is bribery; bribery is\nregarded by some as the quintessential form of corruption (Noonan\n1984; Pritchard 1998; Green 2006). But what of nepotism (Bellow 2003)?\nSurely it is also a paradigmatic form of corruption, and one that is\nconceptually distinct from bribery. The person who accepts a bribe is\nunderstood as being required to provide a benefit to the briber,\notherwise it is not a bribe; but the person who is the beneficiary of\nan act of nepotism is not necessarily understood as being required to\nreturn the favor.\n\nIn fact, corruption is exemplified by a very wide and diverse array of\nphenomena of which bribery is only one kind, and nepotism another.\nParadigm cases of corruption include the following. The commissioner\nof taxation channels public monies into his personal bank account,\nthereby corrupting the public financial system. A political party\nsecures a majority vote by arranging for ballot boxes to be stuffed\nwith false voting papers, thereby corrupting the electoral process. A\npolice officer fabricates evidence in order to secure convictions,\nthereby corrupting the judicial process. A number of doctors close\nranks and refuse to testify against a colleague who they know has been\nnegligent in relation to an unsuccessful surgical operation leading to\nloss of life; institutional accountability procedures are thereby\nundermined. A sports trainer provides the athletes he trains with\nbanned substances in order to enhance their performance, thereby\nsubverting the institutional rules laid down to ensure fair\ncompetition (Walsh and Giulianotti 2006). It is self-evident that none\nof these corrupt actions are instances of bribery.\n\nFurther, it is far from obvious that the way forward at this point is\nsimply to add a few additional offences to the initial\n\u201clist\u201d consisting of the single offence of bribery.\nCandidates for being added to the list of offences would include\nnepotism, police fabricating evidence, cheating in sport by using\ndrugs, fraudulent use of travel funds by politicians, and so on.\nHowever, any such list needs to be justified by recourse to some\nprinciple or principles. Ultimately, naming a set of offences that\nmight be regarded as instances of corruption does not obviate the need\nfor a theoretical, or quasi-theoretical, account of the concept of\ncorruption.\n\nAs it happens, there is at least one further salient strategy for\ndemarcating the boundaries of corrupt acts. Implicit in much of the\nliterature on corruption is the view that corruption is essentially a\nlegal offence, and essentially a legal offence in the economic sphere.\nAccordingly, one could seek to identify corruption with economic\ncrimes, such as bribery, fraud, and insider trading.\n\nBut many acts of corruption are not unlawful. Bribery, a paradigm of\ncorruption, is a case in point. Prior to 1977 it was not unlawful for\nU.S. companies to offer bribes to secure foreign contracts; indeed,\nelsewhere such bribery was not unlawful until much\n later.[3]\n So corruption is not necessarily unlawful. This is because corruption\nis not at bottom simply a matter of law; rather it is fundamentally a\nmatter of morality.\n\nSecondly, corruption is not necessarily economic in character. An\nacademic who plagiarizes the work of others is not committing an\neconomic crime or misdemeanor; and she might be committing plagiarism\nsimply in order to increase her academic status. There might not be\nany financial benefit sought or gained.\n\nWe can conclude that many of the historically influential definitions\nof corruption, as well as attempts to circumscribe corruption by\nlisting paradigmatic offences, fail. They fail in large part because\nthe class of corrupt actions comprises an extremely diverse array of\ntypes of moral and legal offences undertaken in a wide variety of\ninstitutional contexts including, but by no means restricted to,\npolitical and economic institutions.\n\nHowever, in recent times progress has been made. Philosophers, at\nleast, have identified corruption as fundamentally a moral, as opposed\nto legal, phenomenon. Acts can be corrupt even though they are, and\neven ought to be, legal. Moreover, it is evident that not all acts of\nimmorality are acts of corruption; corruption is only one species of\nimmorality.\n\nAn important distinction in this regard is the distinction between\nhuman rights violations and corruption (see the entry on\n human rights).\n Genocide is a profound moral wrong; but it is not corruption. This is\nnot to say that there is not an important relationship between human\nrights violations and corruption; on the contrary, there is often a\nclose and mutually reinforcing nexus between them (Pearson 2001; Pogge\n2002 [2008]; Wenar 2016; Sharman 2017). Consider the endemic\ncorruption and large-scale human rights abuse that have taken place in\nauthoritarian regimes, such as that of Mobutu in Zaire, Suharto in\nIndonesia and Marcos in the Philippines (Sharman 2017). And there is\nincreasing empirical evidence of an admittedly sometimes complex, but\nsometimes not so complex, causal connection between corruption and the\ninfringement of both negative rights (such as the right not to be\ntortured, suffer arbitrary loss of one\u2019s freedom, or have\none\u2019s property stolen) and positive rights, e.g., subsistence\nrights (such as the right to a sufficient supply of clean water to\nenable life and health); there is evidence, that is, of a causal\nrelation between corruption and poverty. Consider corrupt\nauthoritarian leaders in developing countries who sell the\ncountry\u2019s natural resources cheaply and retain the profits for\nthemselves and their families and supporters (Pogge 2002 [2008]:\nChapter 6; Wenar 2016). As Wenar has forcefully argued (Wenar 2016),\nin the first place this is theft of the property (natural resources)\nof the people of the countries in question (e.g., Equatorial Guinea)\nby their own rulers (e.g., Obiang) and, therefore, western countries\nand others who import these resources are buying stolen goods; and, in\nthe second place, this theft maintains these human rights-violating\nrulers in power and ensures that their populations continue to suffer\nin conditions of abject poverty, disease etc.\n\nThus far, examples of different types of corrupt action have been\npresented, and corrupt actions have been distinguished from some other\ntypes of immoral action. However, the class of corrupt actions has not\nbeen adequately demarcated within the more general class of immoral\nactions. To do so, a definition of corrupt actions is needed.\n\nAn initial distinction here is between single one-off actions of\ncorruption and a pattern of corrupt actions. The despoiling of the\nmoral character of a role occupant, or the undermining of\ninstitutional processes and purposes, would typically require a\npattern of actions\u2014and not merely a single one-off action. So a\nsingle free hamburger provided to a police officer on one occasion\nusually does not corrupt, and is not therefore an act of corruption.\nNevertheless, a series of such gifts to a number of police officers\nmight corrupt. They might corrupt, for example, if the hamburger joint\nin question ended up with (in effect) exclusive, round the clock\npolice protection, and if the owner intended that this be the\ncase.\n\nNote here the pivotal role of habits (Langford & Tupper 1994). We\nhave just seen that the corruption of persons and institutions\ntypically requires a pattern of corrupt actions. More specifically,\ncorrupt actions are typically habitual. Yet, as noted by Aristotle in\nhis Nicomachean Ethics, one\u2019s habits are in large part\nconstitutive of one\u2019s moral character; habits make the man (and\nthe woman). The coward is someone who habitually takes flight in the\nface of danger; by contrast, the courageous person has a habit of\nstanding his or her ground. Accordingly, morally bad\nhabits\u2014including corrupt actions\u2014are extremely\ncorrosive of moral character, and therefore of institutional roles and\nultimately institutions. Naturally, so-called systemic corruption\nwould typically involve not simply the habitual performance of a\ncorrupt action by a single individual but the habitual performance of\na corrupt action by many individuals in an institution or,\nconceivably, an entire society or polity. Moreover, this pattern of\nindividuals engaged in the performance of habitual corrupt actions\nmight have a self-sustaining structure that gives rise to a collective\naction problem, if the pattern is to be broken. Consider widespread\nbribery in relation to competitive tenders for government contracts.\nBribes are paid by competing companies in order to try influence the\noutcome of the tender process. Any firm that chooses not to pay a\nbribe is not given serious consideration. Thus, not to engage in\ncorruption is to seriously disadvantage one\u2019s company. Even\nthose who do not want to engage in bribery do so. This is a collective\naction problem (Olson 1965).\n\nNotwithstanding the habitual nature of most corrupt actions there are\nsome cases in which a single, one-off action would be sufficient to\ncorrupt an instance of an institutional process. Consider a specific\ntender. Suppose that one bribe is offered and accepted, and the\ntendering process is thereby undermined. Suppose that this is the\nfirst and only time that the person offering the bribe and the person\nreceiving the bribe are involved in bribery. Is this one-off bribe an\ninstance of corruption? Surely it is, since it corrupted that\nparticular instance of a tendering process.\n\nOntologically speaking, there are different kinds of entities that can\nbe corrupted. These include human beings, words of a language,\nartefacts, such as computer discs, and so on. However, our concern in\nthis entry is with the corruption of institutions since this is the\nmain focus of the philosophical and, for that matter, the\nnon-philosophical, literature. Of course, institutions are comprised\nin large part of institutional roles occupied by human beings. So our\nfocus on institutional corruption brings with it a focus on the\ncorruption of individual human beings. (I refer to the corruption of\nindividual human beings as personal corruption.) However in the case\nof institutional corruption, the focus on the corruption of human\nbeings (personal corruption) is on human beings qua institutional\nactors(and on those who interact with institutional role\noccupants qua institutional role occupants)(Miller 2017:\n65).\n\nThe upshot of this is that there are three sets of distinctions in\nplay here. Firstly, there is the distinction between institutional\ncorruption and non-institutional corruption\u2014the latter being the\ncorruption of entities other than institutions, e.g., corruption of\nartefacts. Secondly, there is the distinction between personal and\nnon-personal corruption\u2014the former being the corruption of human\nbeings as opposed to, for instance, institutional processes. Thirdly,\nwith respect to personal corruption, there is the distinction between\nthe corruption of persons qua institutional actors and\nnon-institutional personal corruption. Non-institutional personal\ncorruption is corruption of persons outside institutional settings.\nPersonal corruption pertains to the moral character of persons, and\nconsists in the despoiling of their moral character. If an action has\na corrupting effect on a person\u2019s character, it will typically\nbe corrosive of one or more of a person\u2019s virtues. These virtues\nmight be virtues that attach to the person qua human being,\ne.g., the virtues of compassion and fairness in one\u2019s dealings\nwith other human beings. Corrosion of these virtues amounts to\nnon-institutional personal corruption. Alternatively\u2014or\nin some cases, additionally\u2014these virtues might attach to\npersons qua occupants of specific institutional roles, e.g.,\nimpartiality in a judge or objectivity in a journalist. Corrosion of\nthese virtues amounts to institutional personal corruption,\ni.e., corruption of a person qua institutional role\noccupant.\n\nIn order to provide an adequate account of institutional corruption we\nneed a serviceable notion of an institution: the thing corrupted. For\nour purposes here it is assumed that an institution is an organization\nor structure of organizations that reproduces itself (e.g., by\ntraining and recruitment processes) and is comprised of a structure of\ninstitutional roles defined in terms of tasks (Harr\u00e9 1979;\nGiddens 1984; Miller 2010). Accordingly, the class of institutions is\nquite diverse and includes political institutions, (e.g.,\nlegislatures), market-based institutions, (e.g., corporations),\ninstitutions of learning, (e.g., universities), security agencies,\n(e.g., police and military organizations), and so on. Importantly, as\nwe noted above, the various different types of, and even motives for,\ninstitutional corruption vary greatly from one kind of institution to\nanother.\n\nNote that in theorizing institutional corruption the distinction\nbetween an entire society or polity, on the one hand, and its\nconstituent institutions, on the other, needs to be kept in mind. A\ntheory of democracy, for instance, might be a theory not only of\ndemocratic government in the narrow sense of the legislature and\nsenior members of the executive, but also of the public administration\nas a whole, the judiciary, the security agencies (police and\nmilitary), civil society and so on. Obviously, a theory of the\ncorruption of democratic political institutions (in the narrow sense\nof the legislature and the senior members of the executive) might not\nbe generalizable to other sorts of institution within a democracy,\ne.g., to security agencies or market-based institutions. Moreover,\nfundamental differences regarding the specific form that a democracy\nought to take, e.g., between those of a republican persuasion (Pettit\n1997; Sandel 2012) and libertarians (Nozick 1974; Friedman 1970),\nmight morph into disputes about what counts as institutional\ncorruption. For instance, on one view market-based institutions exist\nto serve the common good, while on another they exist only to serve\nthe individual self-interest of the participants in them. Thus on the\nlatter, but not the former, view market intervention by the government\nin the service of the common good might be regarded as a species of\ncorruption. Further, a theory of the corruption of democracy, and\ncertainly of the corruption of one species of democracy such as\nliberal democracy, is not necessarily adequate for the understanding\nof the corruption of many of institutions within a democracy and, in\nparticular, those institutions, such as military and police\ninstitutions, hierarchical bureaucracies and market-based\ninstitutions, which are not inherently democratic either in structure\nor purpose, notwithstanding that they exist within the framework of a\ndemocratic political system, are shaped in various ways by that\nframework and, conversely, might be necessary for the maintenance of\nthat framework.\n",
