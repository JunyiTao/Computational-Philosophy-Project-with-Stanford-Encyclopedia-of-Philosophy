Semantics deals with the relation of\nsigns to (\u2026) objects which they may or do denote. Pragmatics\nconcerns the relation of signs to their interpreters.\n\nBy \u2018pragmatics\u2019 is designated the science of the relation\nof signs to their interpreters. (\u2026) Since most, if not all,\nsigns have as their interpreters living organisms, it is a\nsufficiently accurate characterization of pragmatics to say that it\ndeals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the\npsychological, biological, and sociological phenomena which occur in\nthe functioning of signs.\n\nCarnap 1942. If in an investigation explicit\nreference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms,\nto the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of\npragmatics. (\u2026) If we abstract from the user of the language\nand analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the\nfield of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata\nalso and analyze only the relations between expressions, we are in\n(logical) syntax.\n\nBar-Hillel 1954. I believe, therefore, that the\ninvestigation of indexical languages and the erection of indexical\nlanguage-systems are urgent tasks for contemporary logicians. May I\nadd, for the sake of classificatory clarity, that the former task\nbelongs to descriptive pragmatics and the latter to pure\npragmatics (in one of the many senses of the expression)?\n\nStalnaker 1970. Syntax studies sentences, semantics\nstudies propositions. Pragmatics is the study of linguistic acts and\nthe contexts in which they are performed. There are two major types of\nproblems to be solved within pragmatics: first, to define interesting\ntypes of speech acts and speech products; second, to characterize the\nfeatures of the speech context which help determine which proposition\nis expressed by a given sentence. \u2026 It is a semantic problem to\nspecify the rules for matching up sentences of a natural language with\nthe propositions that they express. In most cases, however, the rules\nwill not match sentences directly with propositions, but will match\nsentences with propositions relative to features of the context in\nwhich the sentence is used. Those contextual features are part of the\nsubject matter of pragmatics.\n\nKatz 1977. [I] draw the theoretical line between\nsemantic interpretation and pragmatic interpretation by taking the\nsemantic component to properly represent only those aspects of the\nmeaning of the sentence that an ideal speaker-hearer of the language\nwould know in an anonymous letter situation,(\u2026) [where there\nis] no clue whatever about the motive, circumstances of transmission,\nor any other factor relevant to understanding the sentence on the\nbasis of its context of utterance.\n\nGazdar 1979. PRAGMATICS = MEANING \u2014 TRUTH\nCONDITIONS. What we need in addition is some function that tells us\nabout the meaning of utterances. (\u2026) The domain of this\npragmatic function is the set of utterances, which are pairs of\nsentences and contexts, so that for each utterance, our function will\nreturn as a value a new context: the context as changed by the\nsentence uttered. (\u2026) And we can treat the meaning of the\nutterance as the difference between the original context and the\ncontext arrived at by utterance of the sentence. [This applies to\nonly] a restricted subset of pragmatic aspects of meaning.\n\nKempson 1988. Semantics provides a complete account\nof sentence meaning for the language, [by] recursively specifying the\ntruth conditions of the sentence of the language. \u2026 Pragmatics\nprovides an account of how sentences are used in utterances to convey\ninformation in context.\n\nKaplan 1989. The fact that a word or phrase has a\ncertain meaning clearly belongs to semantics. On the other hand, a\nclaim about the basis for ascribing a certain meaning to a word or\nphrase does not belong to semantics\u2026 Perhaps, because it\nrelates to how the language is used, it should be categorized as part\nof (\u2026) pragmatics (\u2026), or perhaps, because it\nis a fact about semantics, as part of (\u2026)\nMetasemantics.\n\nDavis 1991. Pragmatics will have as its domain\nspeakers\u2019 communicative intentions, the uses of language that\nrequire such intentions, and the strategies that hearers employ to\ndetermine what these intentions and acts are, so that they can\nunderstand what the speaker intends to communicate.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Fotion\n1995). Pragmatics is the study of language which focuses\nattention on the users and the context of language use rather than on\nreference, truth, or grammar.\n\nThe Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (Lycan\n1995). Pragmatics studies the use of language in context, and\nthe context-dependence of various aspects of linguistic\ninterpretation. (\u2026) [Its branches include the theory of how]\none and the same sentence can express different meanings or\npropositions from context to context, owing to ambiguity or\nindexicality or both, (\u2026) speech act theory, and the theory of\nconversational implicature.\n\nThe Blackwell Companion to Philosophy (Davies\n1995). The distinction between semantics and pragmatics is,\nroughly, the distinction between the significance conventionally or\nliterally attached to words, and thence to whole sentences, and the\nfurther significance that can be worked out, by more general\nprinciples, using contextual information.\n\nCarston 1999. The decoding process is performed by an\nautonomous linguistic system, the parser or language perception\nmodule. Having identified a particular acoustic stimulus as\nlinguistic, the system executes a series of deterministic grammatical\ncomputations or mappings, resulting in an output representation, which\nis the semantic representation, or logical form, of the sentence or\nphrase employed in the utterance. (\u2026) The second type of\ncognitive process, the pragmatic inferential process (constrained and\nguided by the communicative principle of relevance) integrates the\nlinguistic contribution with other readily accessible information in\norder to reach a confirmed interpretive hypothesis concerning the\nspeaker\u2019s informative intention.\n\nBach 2004. Semantic information is information\nencoded in what is uttered \u2014 these are stable linguistic\nfeatures of the sentence \u2014 together with any extralinguistic\ninformation that provides (semantic) values to context-sensitive\nexpressions in what is uttered. Pragmatic information is\n(extralinguistic) information that arises from an actual act of\nutterance, and is relevant to the hearer\u2019s determination of what\nthe speaker is communicating. Whereas semantic information is encoded\nin what is uttered, pragmatic information is generated by, or at least\nmade relevant by, the act of uttering it.\n",
