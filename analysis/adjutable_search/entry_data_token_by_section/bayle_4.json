    "main_text": "Criterion of Truth and Skepticism\n5. Criterion of Truth and Skepticism\n\nBayle never referred to himself as a skeptic, he never defended\nskepticism or skeptics at any length in his own voice, and his works\nestablish far more positive theses than you would expect from the pen\nof a skeptic. Nevertheless, the oldest interpretation of Bayle is that\nhe was a skeptic. In Bayle\u2019s day, the title\n\u201cskeptic\u201d or \u201cPyrrhonist\u201d was usually an\ninsult only slightly less offensive than another one frequently hurled\nat Bayle: \u201catheist\u201d. However, even Bayle\u2019s first and\ngreatest admirers freely admitted there was a skeptical character to\nBayle\u2019s writings. In his Poem on the Lisbon Earthquake,\nVoltaire said of Bayle:\n\n\nWise enough and great enough to live without a system, Bayle destroys\nall systems and then turns against himself. He is like Samson, buried\nwith his enemy Philistines under the rubble of a Temple toppled by his\nown hands.\n\n\nLater admirers, like Richard Popkin, also view Bayle as a skeptic, but\npraise him for his ingenious use of this ancient philosophical\nmethodology (Popkin 2003). Most recent debates focus on the particular\nkind of skepticism employed by Bayle: Pyrrhonian, Academic, or other\n(Maia Neto 1999). A few Bayle scholars deny that Bayle was a skeptic\nof any sort (McKenna 2015).\n\nPutting labels aside, the clearest view of Bayle\u2019s connection to\nskepticism comes from focusing on what he wrote concerning the\ncriterion of truth. The skeptical interpretation of Bayle gets support\nfrom the article \u201cPyrrho\u201d in the Historical and\nCritical Dictionary. A famous footnote to this article features a\ndiscussion between two Catholic abbots about the possibility of\ndefeating skeptics in debate. The \u201cphilosophical abbot\u201d,\nwho is really a skeptic, argues that victory can never be won over\nskeptics:\n\n\nRight away the philosophical abbot declared to the other that in order\nto hope for some victory over a skeptic, it is necessary to prove to\nhim before anything else that the truth is recognizable with certainty\nby some marks. We usually call these marks the criterion of truth. You\nwill rightly claim that evidence is the criterion of the truth; for if\nevidence is not this criterion, then nothing would be. \u201cSo be\nit\u201d, the skeptic will respond, \u201cI have been waiting for\nyou here all along; I will show you that there are things you reject\nas false that possess the highest degree of evidence\u201d.\n(Dictionary, \u201cPyrrho\u201d, remark B)\n\n\nThe philosophical abbot proceeds to demonstrate that the clearest,\nmost evident axioms of metaphysics are proven false by certain\nfundamental tenets of the Christian faith, which proves that evidence\nand truth do not always go hand-in-hand. For example, the Trinity\nforces us to reject the proposition that \u201cif two things are\nidentical to a third, then they are identical to each other\u201d,\nbecause both God the Father and God the Son are identical to God, but\nthe Father is not identical to the Son. Therefore, propositions can be\nboth supremely evident and false, thereby undermining the claim that\nevidence is the criterion of truth.\n\nThere are two reasons not to accept the article \u201cPyrrho\u201d\nas definitive proof that Bayle was a skeptic. First, the rejection of\nthe criterion of truth in this passage requires the assumption that\nthe Trinity, and other Christian dogmas, are true. At best, therefore,\nthe article demonstrates that there is a conflict between faith and\nreason, not that there is no certainty in philosophy. Many religious\nthinkers, including many Calvinist theologians, have held this same\nposition without being considered skeptics. The second reason is that,\nin various later works, Bayle revisits the issue of the criterion of\ntruth in his own voice and, rather than reject the criterion like the\nskeptical abbot did, supports a more nuanced view that evidence is a\nreliable, but merely probable criterion of truth. Like Descartes,\nBayle argues that one should not assent in the absence of evidence.\nBut unlike Descartes, Bayle argues that evidence comes in degrees and\nits presence does not guarantee the truth. These issues were the main\nfocus of the debate between Bayle and Jean Le Clerc in Bayle\u2019s\nlast years, and are dealt with at length in the first part of the\nDialogues of Maximus and Themistius (Bayle 1707 [2016]).\nBayle defends his position on the criterion of truth against the\naccusation of skepticism, so there is good reason not to consider him\na skeptic, and not to align his own views with those of his imagined\nphilosophical abbot in the Dictionary.\n",
