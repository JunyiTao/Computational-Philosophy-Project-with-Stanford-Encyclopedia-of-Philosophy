    "main_text": "Extensions of TL over linear time\n4. Extensions of TL over linear time\n\nA very natural class of instant-based models of time is the class of\nlinear models, and soon after Prior\u2019s invention of Tense Logic\nseveral extensions of TL over linear time have been proposed. In this\nsection, we discuss two such extensions of Prior\u2019s basic\ntemporal logic: the extension of TL by a Next Time operator\nover discrete, linear models of time and the introduction of the\noperators Since and Until. These operators also form\nthe basis of the linear time temporal logic LTL, which has widespread\napplications in computer science.\n",
