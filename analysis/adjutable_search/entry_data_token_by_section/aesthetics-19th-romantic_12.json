    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics || Individuality and Sociality\n4.3 Individuality and Sociality\n\nThe allegiance to autonomy and to the value of Bildung may\nseem to indicate individualism. And it does, to an extent.\nWhile individuality is indeed a romantic value, anti-communal\nindividualism is not. The romantics never celebrated uncurbed\nindividuality, but called for a balance between individuality and\nsociality: \u201cA certain regulated interaction between\nindividuality and universality\u2026constitutes the first condition\nfor moral well-being\u201d (F. Schlegel, OP: 427). \n\nWithout doubt, the romantics criticized Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative as proposing a problematically universalistic ethics that\ndiscourages the free expression of unique personalities. They viewed\nsuch a universalist ethics as problematic because they regarded\nindividual expression and the development of a unique, characteristic\nand unified self as intrinsically and morally valuable. Yet, the\nromantics were also critical of extreme individualism, such as the one\nthey found promoted by some Enlightenment thinkers. In other words,\nthey challenged those individualists who criticized any form of social\nand communal participation as potentially a form of passive submission\nto external authority.\n\nIn response to these two extremes of universalism and radical\nindividualism, the romantics sought after a golden mean\u2014romantic\nethics strived to preserve and strengthen social bonds and encouraged\na pluralistic communal life while supporting rational\ncriticism, autonomy, individual rights, liberties and freedom of\nexpression: \u201cDoes not the universal gain from the individual,\nthe individual from universal relations?\u201d (Novalis, Faith and\nLove: #5). The romantics believed that individualism is not merely\ncompatible with sociality and communitarianism, but that it actually\ndepends on genuine forms of the latter: \u201cThe vocation of man is\nattainable only through human society\u201d (F. Schlegel, TPL II:\n144). Autonomy and Bildung, in particular, though nothing\nother than individual freedom and self-realization, can never\nbe divorced from the social: \n\n\nAutonomy should be universal and not relate to the individual but the\nwhole, for otherwise it would destroy itself\u2026. We cannot\nconsider human beings individually. (TPL II: 156) \n\n\nOn the romantic picture, the achievement of free, fully-formed\nindividuality is impossible independently of strong sociality and\nvice versa. An ideal of sociality is deficient if it leaves\nno freedom for the distinct expression and liberties of each\nindividual, and the individual is most herself, as an individual only\ninsofar as she freely interacts with others: \u201cA person can be a\nperson only among people\u201d (TPL II: 145).\n\nRather than contradictory impulses, as they are often regarded today,\nsociality and individuality, on the romantic picture, are not only\ncompatible but also naturally harmonious\u2014grounded in human\nnature:[6]\n\n\nNo man is merely man, but\u2026at the same time he can and should be\ngenuinely and truly all mankind. Therefore, man, in reaching out time\nand again beyond himself to seek and find the complement of his\ninnermost being in the depths of another, is certain to return to\nhimself. (F. Schlegel, DP: 54)\n\n\nIt is this romantic view of natural human\nsociability\u2014rather than some exaggerated zeal or\neffusiveness\u2014that explains and is explained by the centrality of\nlove in romanticism. In contrast to many a modern thinker, the\nromantics regarded love rather than self-interest as a basic condition\nof human nature (\u201cLove is\u2026the core of ourselves\u201d\n(F. Schlegel, TPL II: 151)), and as the proper basis for a genuine\nsociable but pluralistic community:\n\n\nYes, love, you power of attraction of the spiritual world! No\nindividual life or development is possible without you. Without you\neverything must degenerate into a crude, homogeneous mass\u2026.\nThere is no individual development without love, and without the\ndevelopment of one\u2019s individuality there is no perfection in\nlove. When one complements the other, both grow together inseparably.\nI feel united within me the two fundamental conditions of ethical\nlife! (Schleiermacher, \u201dMonologue II\u201d, 180).\n\n\nBut as natural as it may be, the romantics believed that love has\nsuffered paralysis in modernity. On their view, the rise of capitalism\nand instrumentalism had suppressed natural social bonds and encouraged\nself-interest. The consequent view of human beings as solely\nquantitatively distinct further leveled them and inhibited their\ndistinctive and unique expressions.\n\nHow could people balance individuality and sociality in the face of\nmodernity? Here too romantic poetry and the creative imagination come\nto the rescue. Poetry is not only based in love, but is itself a form\nof love insofar as it bonds different individuals:\n\n\nPoetry befriends and binds with unseverable ties the hearts of all\nthose who love it. Even though in their own lives they may pursue the\nmost diverse ends, may feel contempt for what the other holds most\nsacred, may fail to appreciate or communicate with one another, and\nremain in all other realms strangers forever; in poetry through a\nhigher magic power, they are united and at peace. (F. Schlegel, DP:\n53)\n\n\nThe poet is, quintessentially, \u201ca social being\u201d (F.\nSchlegel, DP: 55) insofar as he both expresses, \u201cin\nlasting works the expression of his unique poetry\u201d (DP: 55)\nand reaches to others and reciprocally communicates with\nthem. The poet integrates: \n\n\nhis part with the entire body of poetry\u2026. He can do this when\nhe has found the center point through communication with those who\nhave found theirs from a different side, in a different way. Love\nneeds a responding love. Indeed, for the true poet\u2019s\ncommunication\u2026can be beneficial and instructive. (DP: 55)\n\n\nFollowing the \u201ccategorical imperative of the genius\u201d is\nrequired, then, also for achieving Bildung and autonomous\nindividuality in and through society: it is an ethical and social\ndemand as well.\n\n",
