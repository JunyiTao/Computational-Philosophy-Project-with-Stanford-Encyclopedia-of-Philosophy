    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 Place in Greek Neoplatonism || The second founder of Neoplatonism\n2.1 The second founder of Neoplatonism\n\nIamblichus\u2019 significance in Late Antique philosophy can hardly\nbe overestimated. Karl Praechter described him as the second founder\nof Neoplatonism after Plotinus and argued that Iamblichus\u2019\nposition was similar to that of Chrysippus in ancient Stoicism\n(Praechter 1910: 143). This statement aptly expresses\nIamblichus\u2019 historical and philosophical significance, but needs\nqualification: unlike the Stoa, \u201cNeoplatonism\u201d is not an\nancient philosophical school, but a modern historical category (whose\nreliability scholars are sometimes inclined to question: see Catana\n2013). Iamblichus is likely, as was mentioned above\n (Section 1.1)\n to have been a student of Porphyry who was, in turn, a student of\nPlotinus. Iamblichus\u2019 school was, however, separate from that of\nPlotinus, both in time and in place: consequently, despite late,\nideological attempts to reconstruct a continuous \u201cgolden\nchain\u201d of Neoplatonist exegetes (see, e.g., Hierocles, De\nProvidentia, apud Photius cod. 214, 173 a; Proclus,\nPlatonic Theology I, p. 6.16\u20137.8), there is no\ninstitutional continuity between Plotinus and Iamblichus and, from\nthis point of view, the situation is different from that of the\nancient Stoa. Iamblichus is not the second founder of the Neoplatonic\nschool for the simple reason that there is no unitary Neoplatonic\nschool in Late Antiquity. What scholars call Greek Neoplatonism is\nactually a multifaceted philosophical movement that covers some three\ncenturies and includes several schools scattered throughout the Roman\nEmpire: these schools certainly shared doctrines and methods, but\ntheir relations were sometimes close, sometimes much more tenuous.\nCertainly, Iamblichus accepts and further develops some distinctive\nfeatures of Plotinus\u2019 philosophy and he can be seen as a\nfollower of Plotinus and Porphyry: this holds in particular for\nIamblichus\u2019 general metaphysical and philosophical approach, for\nhis account of the One and of the first principles, for his exegesis\nof some works such as Plato\u2019s Parmenides and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories. On the other hand,\nIamblichus\u2019 original position vis-\u00e0-vis Plotinus\nand Porphyry emerges clearly with respect to both his theories and his\nmethods (see Taormina 1999).\n",
