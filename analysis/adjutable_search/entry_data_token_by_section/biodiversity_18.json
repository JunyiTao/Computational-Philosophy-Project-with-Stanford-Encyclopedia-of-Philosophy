Socio-Ecological Framing\n\nThe conservation biology framing interprets \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\nas a term that is to capture everything we want to conserve. An\nemerging socio-ecological framing of biodiversity requires that the\nterm take on a broader scope\u2014it is to be made operational, not\njust for conservation, but more broadly for sustainability,\nencompassing the many ways that society and nature are inter-linked.\nWhile conservation biology has interpreted \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\nas, from the start, all about society\u2019s conservation values, the\nsocio-ecological framing of biodiversity adopts a different narrative.\nHere, the claim is that, the term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d started\nout with a too-narrow, strictly biological, interpretation, and now\nshould be re-cast to better reflect, in different contexts, what\nsociety values about nature. The term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d in\nfact appears to wear two different hats in the rationale for a\nsocio-ecological framing: one of expectation and the other of\ndisappointment. The expectation is that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is\nobliged to capture society\u2019s various values and relationships\nwith nature; the disappointment is based on the claim that in reality\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d has been too biotic and creates a\nhuman-nature dichotomy.\n\nThe roots of this framing are found in the idea that biodiversity must\nreflect society\u2019s various environmental concerns. For example,\nthe book, Defending Biodiversity (Newman, Varner, &\nLinquist 2017) focusses on philosophical issues about the value of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d, because this is seen as the way to\n\u201cthrow a sufficiently large net over these many different\nflavours of environmentalism\u201d (2017: 15). Similarly, Lele et al.\n(2018b) take as a starting point the idea that\n\n\nThe concept of biodiversity currently captures the core of\nnaturalists\u2019 concerns for the environment, subsuming earlier\nformulations such as wilderness or wildlife. (2018b: 7)\n\n\nTwo recent books summarise these perspectives (Seeds of Change:\nProvocations for a New Research Agenda, Wyborn, Kalas, & Rust\n2019 and Rethinking Environmentalism: Linking Justice,\nSustainability, and Diversity, Lele et al. 2018a). In the first,\nD\u00edaz (2019: 62) outlines an historical argument that\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d has been purely biological in focus, and\ntherefore needs to be broadened to reflect human links:\n\n\nThe notion of biological diversity existed as a purely biological\nconcept well before the word \u201cbiodiversity\u201d emerged\u201c\nand \u201dFaced with the new challenge and desire to be useful to\nsociety,\u2026. It is now clear that whilst\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d is about the biological realm, its crisis\nand potential solutions pertain to the social, cultural, economic and\npolitical realm\u2026.Broadening the concept of\nbiodiversity\u2014from a property of measurable biological systems to\na socio-ecological boundary object.\n\n\nHere, \u201cbiodiversity\u201d history is presented as involving a\npost-1985 new-found desire to be useful to society, where, in\nresponse,\n\n\nbiological diversity scientists mustered the best tools they had:\nmathematical and statistical models and indices, which required a\nsingle and simple \u201ccurrency\u201d\u2014the number of\nspecies\u2026. (D\u00edaz 2019; see also Sarkar 2019)\n\n\nThis claimed new awareness then sets up the call for a re-casting of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d:\n\n\nIt is now clear that whilst \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is about the\nbiological realm, its crisis and potential solutions pertain to the\nsocial, cultural, economic and political realms. Therefore, diverse\nperspectives are needed in reframing biodiversity more broadly. Very\nfew would contest this general statement\u2026. (D\u00edaz 2019:\n62)\n\n\nThis claimed incontestability of the need for a biodiversity reframing\nis given support by an historical accounting that omits the rich\nhistory that had forged links to all those \u201crealms\u201d (see\nprevious sections); anthropocentric insurance and investment values of\nbiotic diversity (typically the number of species) were recognised in\nthe context of the extinction crisis, and integrated in policy along\nwith other needs of society. In contrast, the socio-ecological framing\nadopts a new historical accounting, where counting the number of\nspecies was simply a matter of mathematical and statistical models and\nindices, which then are found inadequate.\n\nThis new historical accounting omits the earlier history that\njustifies why biodiversity\u2019s definition logically focusses on\nvariety (or counting units). This omission props up the claim that\neven while \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is largely biological, it is, at\nthe same time, ill-defined and confusing. Redford and Mace (2018: 37)\nargue\n\n\nThe lack of clarity over the term simply adds another layer of\nconfusion to what is already a complicated and interacting set of\nissues.\n\n\nMace (2019: 105) concludes\n\n\nLooking back over the past 25 years\u2014roughly the period that the\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has been in place and the\nterm \u201cbiodiversity\u201d has been in use\u2014I conclude that\nit has become a confusing\n term\u2026[4]\n\n\nIn the book, Rethinking Environmentalism: Linking Justice,\nSustainability, and Diversity, Redford and Mace (2018) reinforce\nthis interpretation of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d as having only a\nrecent history, with confusing definitions, and with little link to\nhuman concerns. This is seen as calling for the alternative\nsocio-ecological framing, in which biodiversity conservation is seen\nas \u201cinextricably linked to a living political discourse\u201d\nso that a re-cast \u201cbiodiversity\u201d can be defined \u201cas\nincluding human beings\u201d (2018: 33). Similar arguments are found\nin Koricheva and Siipi\u2019s (2004) discussion of biodiversity as\n\u201ca social and political construct\u201d, compared to a purely\nscientific concept (see also the advocacy, by Meinard, Coq, &\nSchmid 2019, of \u201cbiodiversity practices\u201d rather than\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d).\n\nPascual (2019) describes this framing as an \u201cintegrated\nsocio-ecological\u201d perspective where \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\nis variously socially constructed. In this framing,\n\n\nThe ways we perceive and relate to biodiversity and make sense of it\nare influenced by collectively constructed and socially shared\ncognitive frameworks. (2019: 129)\n\n\nArguments for such a biodiversity re-casting have used the\n\u201cpeople and nature\u201d narrative (D\u00edaz 2019). Mace\n(2014: 1559) describes the \u201cpeople and nature\u201d perspective\nas requiring\n\n\nmetrics that link nature to human well-being, explicitly identifying\nbenefits needed and received by people \u2026 the science has moved\nfully away from a focus on species and protected areas and into a\nshared human nature environment, where the form, function,\nadaptability, and resilience provided by nature are valued most\nhighly.\n\n\nThe rationale for rejecting the idea of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d as\na counting up of species (or other units) employs an argument that\n\n\nbiodiversity science can become quite reductionist and focussed on\ndescribing, defining, measuring and counting certain units of life.\n(Mace 2019: 105)\n\n\nMace concludes that\n\n\nThis aspect of biodiversity science to do with metrics has been\nimportant and influential, but curiously often somewhat disconnected\nfrom the global change and sustainability agenda. Important as it is\nthis is, surely it is too narrow a focus for a biodiversity science\nthat will support sustainability. (2019: 106)\n\n\nThis claim again highlights how the narrative in this socio-ecological\nframing sees \u201cbiodiversity\u201d not only as obliged to capture\nsustainability, but also, in its present biological form, a\ndisappointment in not being connected to humans.\n\nMartin, McGuire, and Sullivan (2013: 125) similarly characterises\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d as problematical in being \u201cdistinct\nfrom other environmental phenomena, as well as from human\nactivity\u201d. They argue that such separation\n\n\nmay engender profoundly \u201cunecological\u201d thinking, by\ndisassembling life\u2019s entities both from each other and from the\ncomplex environmental contexts necessary for sustenance at all\nscales.\n\n\nThis dissatisfaction with counting-up units or items is echoed also in\nphilosopher Elliot\u2019s (2019) argument that\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d has failed to convince people to address\nenvironmental problems. He argues that that we need to \u201cdevelop\nnew conceptual schemes that link humans with their\nenvironments\u201d, by\n\n\nfocusing less on specific items in the natural world that we want to\nmaintain and more on developing resilient and sustainable systems that\nfacilitate the myriad relationships between humans and nature. (2019:\n68)\n\n\nThese perspectives within the socio-ecological framing suggest\noverlaps with the ideas of the conservation biology framing (though\nthere appears to be little cross-citation). Significantly, both\nportray \u201cbiodiversity\u201d as in need of some kind of\nre-casting, and both see the different ways in which society values\nnature as providing guidance about how we should interpret\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d in any given context. At the same time,\ncore differences in the two framings remain: in one,\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d has a working biological definition, but is\nnot connected to society\u2019s values; in the other,\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d is connected to society\u2019s\n(conservation) values, but we have no working definition.\n",
