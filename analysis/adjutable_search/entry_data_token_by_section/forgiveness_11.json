    "main_text": "Theories of Forgiveness || Multiple-Stage Accounts\n5.4 Multiple-Stage Accounts\n\nIn an insightful chapter on the relationship between forgiving and\nhatred, Jean Hampton argued that forgiveness is a two-stage process,\nthe first of which \u201cinvolves regaining one\u2019s confidence in\none\u2019s own worth despite the immoral action challenging\nit\u201d, which can be accomplished by \n\n\novercoming, in the sense of \u201cgiving up\u201d or\n\u201crepudiating\u201d, emotions such as spite and malice, and\n\u201covercoming\u201d in the sense of \u201ctranscending\u201d\nresentment. (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83) \n\n\nA further stage is required, however, for even after the first stage,\none might still hate the wrongdoer and hatred, according to Hampton,\nis incompatible with forgiveness. Therefore, at the second stage, the\nforgiver \u201creapproves\u201d of the wrongdoer (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83),\ndeciding to see the \u201cwrongdoer in a new, more favorable\nlight\u201d (84), \u201crevising her judgement of the person\nhimself\u201d (85).\n\nThis does not mean that the forgiver comes to approve of the\nwrongdoer\u2019s action or the character trait that precipitated\nit\u2014that disapproval must remain in order for forgiveness not to\ncollapse into condonation. Rather, by having a change of heart towards\nthe wrongdoer himself, the forgiver frees herself from hatred and\nindignation, allowing herself to accept the wrongdoer as a decent\nperson worthy of \u201crenewed association\u201d (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83, 85). On\nHampton\u2019s account then, forgiveness requires both a change in\nemotion towards the wrongdoer, and an intentional alteration of\none\u2019s assessments about the wrongdoer as a person, which is why\nshe holds that \u201cforgiveness must be defined so that it involves\nmore than simply effecting certain psychological changes for moral\nreasons\u201d (1988: 37). Forgiving, therefore, is accomplished when\none successfully goes through both stages. For more on Hampton\u2019s\naccount see Radzik (2011).\n",
