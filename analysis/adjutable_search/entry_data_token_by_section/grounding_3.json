    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Full and partial grounding\n1.3 Full and partial grounding\n\nThere is a distinction between full and partial grounding. Suppose\n\\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). Speaking in unionist\nterms, for a preliminary characterization of the distinction we can\nsay that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 partially grounds \\([Q]\\) when\nthe former facts contribute to explaining the latter; and \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 fully grounds \\([Q]\\) when nothing needs to be\nadded to the former to get a fully adequate explanation of the latter\nfact. Separatists might instead initially characterize the distinction\nin terms of partial and full determination.\n\nSticking with unionism for the moment, we can say that, as any ground\ncontributes to explaining what it grounds, any ground is a partial\nground. But not all partial grounds provide fully adequate\nexplanations of what they ground, so not all partial grounds are full\ngrounds. A merely partial ground is a partial ground that isn\u2019t\na full ground. By grounding we henceforth mean partial\ngrounding. The example of the truckers picketing above illustrates the\nnotion of merely partial grounding\u2014we would need to add facts\nabout the trucking company and relations between the picketers and the\ncompany (e.g., that the picketers work as drivers for the company) to\nget a fully adequate explanation of the fact that they\u2019re\nstriking. As for full grounding, a common view is that conjunctive\nfacts are fully grounded by their conjuncts\u2014the collection\nconsisting of [The bowl is brittle] and [The truckers are striking],\nfor example, is thought to fully ground [The bowl is brittle and the\ntruckers are striking].\n\nAccording to the standard definition of partial grounding, \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 partially grounds \\([Q]\\) just in case \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 either on its own or together with other facts\nfully grounds \\([Q]\\) (Audi 2012a; Litland 2015; Loss 2017; Raven\n2013; Rosen 2010; Skiles 2015). You might initially view this\ndefinition as being a purely stipulative matter. But it\u2019s\nactually substantive in nature, as we have a pre-theoretic grip on\nboth partial and full grounding. In fact, Leuenberger (2020) and\nTrogdon & Witmer (2021) argue that the standard definition is\nfalse, proposing cases in which mere partial grounds can\u2019t be\nsupplemented with further facts to yield full grounds. The latter\nrecommend reversing the direction of the standard definition,\nproposing a definition of full grounding in terms of partial grounding\ntogether with other notions.\n",
