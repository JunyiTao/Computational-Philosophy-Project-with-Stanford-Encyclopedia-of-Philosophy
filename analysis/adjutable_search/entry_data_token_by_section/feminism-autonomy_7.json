    "main_text": "Normative Competency Conceptions\n5. Normative Competency Conceptions\n\nIn his early work, Paul Benson offered a normative competence\nconception of \u201cfree agency\u201d that, he argued, was congenial\nto feminist interpretations of moral and political agency (Benson\n1987; 1990; 1991). For our purposes, Benson\u2019s proposal can be\ntreated as an account of autonomy because the capacity for free agency\nis also thought of as a capacity for exercising agency that is\none\u2019s own. As Benson points out, both Gary Watson and\nSusan Wolf adopt versions of normative competence views. Watson claims\nthat endorsement is insufficient for autonomy because doing\n\u201cwhat one wants\u201d\u2014that is to say, doing what one has\nendorsed\u2014is compatible with mere intentional agency and\ndoes not provide the further element required to guarantee\nautonomous agency (Watson 1975, 205; compare Buss 1994).\nWatson proposes that \u201cif what I do flows from my values and\nends, there is a\u2026sense in which my activities are inescapably\nmy own\u201d (Watson 1996, 233; quoted in Benson 2005b, 103). This\nmodification of the endorsement view, although it introduces values\ninto the analysis of autonomy, suffers from the same objection as the\npurely procedural theories discussed in the last section. For if an\nagent such as the student mentioned above has so effectively\ninternalized oppressive norms that she values them and treats them as\nher ends, then it is questionable whether they are genuinely her\nown.\n\nSusan Wolf adopts a normative competence view in which the capacity\nthat is essential for autonomy is the capacity to track objective\nmoral reasons. Wolf considers agents who have experienced a morally\nimpoverished or distorting socialization. For instance, JoJo is the\nson of an evil and sadistic tyrant who has been raised to respect his\nfather\u2019s values and emulate his desires, so that he thoroughly\ninternalizes his father\u2019s evil and sadistic worldview. Suppose\nthat on procedural theories, JoJo counts as autonomous because he\nendorses his desires in the appropriate ways, has the desires he\nreally wants, and so forth. Wolf proposes that he is neither\nfree nor morally responsible because his upbringing has undermined his\ncapacity to distinguish right from wrong: \u201c[i]t is unclear\nwhether anyone with a childhood such as his could have developed into\nanything but the twisted and perverse sort of person that he has\nbecome\u201d (Wolf 1987, 54). On Wolf\u2019s account, the failure of\nautonomy is a failure of a capacity to track an objective aspect of\nthe world, namely, \u201cthe moral\u201d or \u201cthe right\u201d.\nSince for Wolf the demands of morality are equivalent to the demands\nof objective \u201cReason\u201d, in order to be autonomous, agents\nmust be capable of discerning the requirements of Reason.\n\nBenson employs a parallel notion of normative competence, though it\ndoes not does require a capacity to track objective morality, but\nrather an ability to identify and deploy norms that are appropriate to\na particular domain (1987, 486). He writes that:\n\n[F]ree agency requires normative competence, an array of abilities to\nbe aware of applicable normative standards, to appreciate those\nstandards, and to bring them competently to bear in one\u2019s\nevaluations of open courses of action\u2026At the heart of free\nagency is the power of our actions to reveal who we are, both to\nourselves and to others, in the context of potential normative\nassessments of what we do. (Benson 1990, 54)\n\n\nAutonomy based on normative competence is compatible with feminist\nreinterpretations of moral and political agency because it is\nrelational in three respects (Benson 1990, 55). First, normative\ncompetence is \u201cother-directed\u201d in that \u201cit makes\ncertain normative characteristics of the agent present to\nothers\u201d. Second, the content of normative competence\n\u201cdepends on the particular norms or standards in relation to\nwhich an agent\u2019s freedom may be determined\u201d (Benson 1990,\n55). Third, the normative standpoint relative to particular domains is\nthat of \u201cpersons and institutions with whom (or which) one is\nconcretely connected by friendship, family, work, neighborhood\u201d\n(Benson 1990, 55).\n\nIt is plausible that the oppression experienced by marginalized groups\ninterferes with their normative competence. The psychological harms of\noppression include false consciousness (the agent adopts as true the\nfalse ideology that oppresses her) and deformed desires (the\nagent\u2019s desires depend on the belief in the false ideology)\n(Cudd 2006, 176, 182). At worst, agents in the grip of false\nconsciousness in a particular domain do not have the capacity relative\nto that domain to latch on to alternative, applicable, or\n\u201ccorrect\u201d standards and apply them to evaluate their\npreferences and desires. At best, they are faced with a contradictory\nset of norms:\n\nIf many of the prevailing norms which enter into what normative\ncompetence practically means for most women in the society are norms\nthat function to suppress or trivialize women\u2019s contributions\nand experience, to deny women dignity as full participants in the life\nof the community, then free agency would seem to confront women as a\nself-destructive goal. (Benson 1990, 57)\n\n\nIn other words, attempting to exercise normative competence (that is,\nto promote autonomy) relative to the prevailing norms entails adopting\na set of norms that is oppressive to oneself. Benson suggests that, in\norder to promote autonomy, members of marginal groups will need to\ndevelop alternative norms through grassroots activities such as\nconsciousness-raising. \n\nBenson is careful to point out that a requirement of normative\ncompetence should not be conflated with a strong substantive\nconception of autonomy in which the theory places direct normative\nconstraints on the contents of the preferences of autonomous agents.\nEven on Wolf\u2019s position, in which normative competence is the\nability to track objective moral norms, normative competence is\nnevertheless a capacity. It does not require that the content\nof agents\u2019 preferences correspond to the content of the\napplicable norms. As Benson puts it, \u201cnormatively competent\npersons can choose what is unreasonable or wrong or value what is bad,\nbecause competence lies some distance short of perfect evaluative\nperception or responsiveness\u201d (Benson 2005a, 133\u20134).\nHowever, there are controversial issues raised by normative competence\naccounts. The first is that of the status of the moral and other norms\nthat are employed to explicate normative competence. Wolf\u2019s\nclaim that there are objective moral reasons that rational agents have\nthe capacity to track is controversial despite being a well-known and\nwidely supported position. Benson\u2019s normative standpoints are\nnot derived from objective moral reasons but rather are\nintersubjective standpoints\u2014those derived from \u201cpersons or\ninstitutions to which the agent is concretely connected\u201d. The\nproblem here, as we have seen, is that such standpoints may be\noppressive to the group in which the agent is a member. Indeed, as a\nresult of internalized oppression, the agent may competently deploy\nthese standards to evaluate her own actions. It seems, for example,\nthat the eighteen-year-old student is competent to evaluate her\nactions using oppressive norms such as \u201cbeauty is a component of\nself-worth\u201d. She is normatively competent with respect to the\nprevailing set of intersubjective norms (those of the oppressive\nideology). If the student is to be characterized as lacking autonomy,\nshe must be judged lacking in normative competence from some other\nnormative standpoint\u2014but where does this other standpoint come\nfrom on Benson\u2019s account? A final difficulty for normative\ncompetence accounts is the charge that they conflate autonomy with\nmoral responsibility. In the case of JoJo, for example, although it is\nplausible that the comprehensiveness of his socialization absolves him\nfrom full moral responsibility for his acts, it may be too quick to\nconclude that his acts are not the product of his own (autonomous)\nagency. The wish to maintain a conceptual distinction between\nresponsibility and autonomy has led Benson to revise his early\nnormative competence approach (Benson 1994, 665).\n",
