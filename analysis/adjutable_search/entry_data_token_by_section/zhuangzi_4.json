    "main_text": "A Modern Philosophical Interpretation || Skepticism\n4.8 Perspectives on Perspectives\nNotice, the argument about the fish implies we have a perspective\non the perspectives of others. So skepticism grounded in dependence or\nrelativity of perspective need not be predominantly\nnegative. Zhuangzi, here, uses it to justify a way of claiming to\nknowing. In many other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that\ncomes with a gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and\nothers\u2019 points of view as similar\u2014see ourselves as others\nsee us. This is the more comprehensive perspective Zhuangzi urges on\nus. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come\nappreciate we had been wrong before and now view things\ndifferently. We are confident from our own \u201cnow\u201d that we\nhave made epistemic progress\u2014our new awareness seems\n\u201crelatively\u201d improved to us now. We reach a state where we\njudge our former perspective to be inferior to our present one. It\nincludes insight into our relative situations. Evidently, this\nawareness of one\u2019s own perspective as one of many, equally\nnatural points of view motivates us to wonder if we have made the\nfinal correction. This enhanced awareness of ourselves as one of many\nperspectives is an intelligible candidate reading of Zhuangzi\u2019s\n\u660e m\u00edngclarity. It is harder to\nconstruct a coherent narrative for mystical and/or dogmatic\nreadings\u2014those that jump from an improved perspective to a\nperfect one.\n This kind of gestalt shift leads us to reflect on how narrow our\npast perspective had been. It features prominently in the \u201cAutumn\nFloods\u201d Chapter 17. The Earl of the Yellow River, having thought\nhimself as the ultimate, discovers the North Sea and announces his\nformer error and newfound awareness of his lesser significance in\n\u201cthe greater path.\u201d The North Sea Overlord tells him that\nhe too sees himself as situated in a modest status in a still greater\nscheme and rejects the River Earl\u2019s attempts to identify the\nNorth Sea\u2019s as ultimate. He casts doubt on there being a final,\nultimately small or large.\n The lord of He river said, \u201cSo can I consider\ncosmos \u2018large\u2019 and the tip of a hair as\n\u2018small\u2019?\u201d North Sea Ruo replied, \u201cNo! Thing\nkinds have unlimited measurement (ways of measuring); Time has no end;\ndistinctions have no constancy, beginning and ending no inherent\ncause. Because of this great knowing is viewed within a range of\ndistant and close. \u2026We calculate that what humans know is never\nas great as what they do not know, their temporal extent of life is\nnot as great as not as much as the time before life, and from the very\nsmall to try to take in the scope of the very large, is an invitation\nto confusion and disorder and not that from which we can\ngain. (Ibid., HY 42/17/14\u201320) \n\nCan we describe Zhuangzi\u2019s m\u00edng as \u201chaving\na sense of our limited perspective?\u201d Credulous, dogmatic and\nimperious absolutists do not appreciate themselves as being in one of\na variety of natural perspectives. Broad open-mindedness and mild\nskepticism come together in the m\u00edngclarity\nZhuangzi encourages in us. It has a dual nature\u2014an epistemically\nmodest perspective on ourselves that arises from improving our\nepistemic status and encourages us to continue. It helps us appreciate\nthat we are still as naturally situated and others with whom we may\ndisagree and still grow. Further improvement can come from further\nexchange of perspectives. \n\nThe na\u00efve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social\nd\u00e0o thus disrupt the natural process by which social\nd\u00e0os evolve in real time as we seek a harmony guided\nby \u201cglances at nature.\u201d Seeing things from another\u2019s\nperspective both alerts us to how we could be wrong and makes us feel\nthat we now understand things better than with our former, narrower\nperspective. Yet, the Zhuangzi repeatedly reminds us not to\nabandon epistemic modesty when we make epistemic progress. That we now\nsee things from a perspective in common with another does not make us\nboth right. Yet, the more comprehensive our perspective, the\n\u201cclearer\u201d the new gestalt should seem. \n The search for this kind of perspective on ourselves and others\nseems to motivate Zhuangzi\u2019s willingness to engage and interact\nwith others, seeking to understand their perspective as having a\nnatural status and role for them as ours does for us. This is partly\nillustrated by common sense examples of our judging from our own\ncurrent perspective that theirs \u201cadds something\u201d enriching\nour own perspective by our own lights. Sometimes it\u2019s dangerous\nto try to mix others\u2019 perspectives with your own. \nAnd have you alone not\nheard tell of those from Shou-ling who studied walking with those in\nHandan? They never mastered the country\u2019s skill and lost their\noriginal way of walking, and stumbled and crawled\nback. (Ibid., HY45/17/79\u201380) \n Aside from its frequent usefulness from our point of view, the\nmain benefit from the self-recognition as a natural creature embedded\nas are others at a perspective-point within a natural network\nstructure is to encourage being open-minded.  Part of the value is the\nhumbling of our epistemic pride, mildly disrupting our judgment\nequilibrium. Without such an occasional perspective on ourselves, we\ntoo easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic exceptionalism. The\nreminder that we are intermingled with others in a web of natural\nperspectives gives us an appropriate, realistic correction.  A\nZhuangzi story illustrates such a moment.\n\nZhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a\n  weird magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of\n  over seven-feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel\n  it. Then it gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut\n  grove. Zhuangzi thought \u201cwhat bird is that?\u00a0 Massive\n  wings of such power and eyes so large it couldn\u2019t see\n  me.\u201d He hiked up his robe and hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his\n  cross-bow at the ready. Then he spotted a cicada settling in the\n  shaded shelter without a worry for itself, but a preying mantis\n  opened its pincers about to grab it, also focused on its gain and\n  ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange magpie burst out and\n  harvested them both\u2014similarly unaware of the natural dangers he\n  faced.\n\nBut Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with this thought, \u201cWe natural\nkinds are all interconnected! We two different species are mutually\nseeing things in our own ways.\u201d He dismantled his crossbow and\nfled, himself now himself pursued by the game warden shouting out his\ncrimes. (Ibid., HY 54/20/61\u20135)\n\nOverall, Zhuangzi clearly recommends open-minded flexibility as\nwhen he scolds Hui Shi for being tied to conventional thinking about\nhow to use giant gourds. He illustrates it again with his story about\ndifferent uses of a salve that prevents chapping. He models such\nopenness in his conversations with cripples (righteously shunned by\nConfucians), freaks, thieves, strange creatures, the wind, a shadow\nand a skull. He imagines many other conversations illustrating the\ndifferences of perspectives, capacities and needs. \n\nWhile we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, he\nseems to see tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from\nappreciating other natural perspectives:\n A monkey keeper says (to the monkeys) \u201cI\u2019ll\ngive you three [rations] in the morning and four in the\nevening.\u201d The monkeys seemed angry. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give\nyou four in the morning and three in the evening.\u201d The monkeys\nwere happy.  So with no substantive loss, he could change their anger\nto happiness. This is an example of a sh\u00ec judgment\nbeing dependent on circumstances. So the sage uses\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments to\nharmonize and rests in the natural balance. And we can call this\nwalking as pairs. (Ibid., HY 5/2/38\u201340) \n We are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives\nof others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to\nborrow insights and to reach agreements. However, the\nZhuangzi seems skeptical that we can extrapolate from this\nordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to having some absolute\nor comprehensive insight\u2014as it were from all points of\nview. Nor, as we saw above, can we assume that because the two\ndisputants come to a resolution or agreement, it constitutes knowing\nfrom a cosmically or absolutely higher perspective.  Hui Shi\u2019s\nrelativism, recall, does point to such an infinite expansion ending in\na single universal point of view. Here, however, we are reminded that\nwhile we experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing\nsomething real and significant (like waking from a dream), we cannot\nextrapolate from that to the claim to be able to know the final result\nof such gestalt leaps to broader perspectives.\n\nEven though North Sea Lord denies there is any final or ultimately\nbroad perspective from which we can make\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments, the\nparable suggests a progressive path toward broader perspectives with\nthose further along having the epistemic status to guide those with\nless comprehensive perspectives. However, arguments in Chapter 2\nsuggest that progress must always be judged from a moving frame of\nreference along a d\u00e0o that is already\nch\u00e9ngfixed in our\nx\u012bnheart-mind that shoots-out the\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i.\nOur location and trajectory makes us\nreceptive to some and not other avenues of learning. The boy was\nunable to master the Handan way of walking\nbecause of the way he had already learned to walk. The monkey keeper\ncould accommodate the monkeys, but still disagreed with them about the\nimportance of the breakfast-dinner choice. That someone understands\nand agrees with both of us does not make his judgment correct. The\nfinal skepticism concerns whether these paths of progress of\nperspectives must or will converge on a single outcome. \n\nThe epistemic modesty implicit in Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism targets\nmainly the paternalistic, superior attitude toward other points of\nview exemplified by Confucian and Mohist moralistic posture. When we\nhave an accommodation (you and I come to a common agreement) you and I\nmay both rate it as progress. However, it does not imply we have moved\nto a higher state of overall insight along an absolute scale\u2014or from\nany arbitrary third point of view. Exchange of points of view can be\nvaluable to each (perhaps in different ways) and broadening\nperspective in this way can make us wiser\u2014but always as judged\nfrom our already operative \u6210\nch\u00e9ngfixed d\u00e0os . We can\nadvise and recommend our normative perspective on others, but their\nbeing able to appreciate and use it depends on their capacities,\noptions and situation. \n\nAt this point, Zhuangzi starts to draw an analogy of dreaming and\nwaking up to the shift in gestalt that comes when we leap to a more\ncomprehensive perspective. At awakening, we immediately appreciate the\nunreality of the dream, yet within the dream, we can have a similar\ngestalt shift and dream of having dreamed and interpreted that deeper\ndream. \nHow do I know that loving life is not a form of ignorance?\nHow do I know disliking death is not a weak farewell of the sort when\nwe don\u2019t know about the return? Miss Li Zhi cries when she is\nbetrothed to someone\u2019s son, and when she first goes off to the Jin\nstate soaks her clothing with her tears; but then she arrives at the\nkings abode, sleeps with the king in his bed, eats  fattened\nlivestock and then starts to regret her tears. How do I know the dead\ndo not regret their former clinging to life, We dream of eating and\ndrinking and on awaking cry bitterly, we dream of weeping and wailing\nand awake in a good mood to go off hunting. When we dream, we don\u2019t\nknow it as a dream, and in our dreams, judge something else as a\ndream. On awakening, we know it was a dream, and there could be\nanother greater awakening in which we know a greater dream, and under\nthese the conditions the ignorant think they are as enlightened as if\nthey had learned it by an investigation. Gentlemen to shepherds\ninherently do this! (Ibid., HY 6/2/78\u201383) \nSo, is there an ultimate or final possible such shift in\ngestalt\u2014some final state of knowing what to do? Zhuangzi\u2019s\nrelativism is mildly skeptical because he cannot know either that\nthere is not nor that there is a final or ultimate\n\u201cawakening\u201d\n\nThe dream theme is memorably carried over to the story of Zhuangzi\ndreaming a butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the\ngestalt sense of liberation from error may even be reciprocal. Perhaps\nour subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our\nformer perspective. Adolescent conversion can be to or from a\nreligion. \n Once before, Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly, gaily\nbutterflying and himself embodied in this sense of purpose! He knew\nnothing of Zhuangzi.  Suddenly awakening, he then is rooted in\nZhuangzi. He doesn\u2019t know if Zhuangzi dreamt being a butterfly\nor a butterfly is dreaming being Zhuangzi\u2014though there must be a\ndifference. This is called \u201cthings change.\u201d (Ibid.,\nHY7/2/94) \n Elaborating the complexity this way makes Zhuangzi\u2019s\nproposals seem disappointing as solutions. They amount to mildly\nsuggesting that we allow the exchange of views to go on without the\ndomination of any dogma and with some vague \u201cglances at natural\nconstancies\u201d and see what comes out \u201cin the long\nrun.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s conception of d\u00e0os in nature, from a\nhere-now to a there-then, differs from a Mohist (broadly utilitarian)\nnaturalism. Utilitarianism is a natural constraint, an allegedly\nsingle naturally correct way for all of us to choose our course. In\neffect, Zhuangzi is more of a natural pluralist, with the natural\noutcome of morality the product of ongoing individual and social\nconstruction.\nD\u00e0os are in nature but not choices of\nnature for us. So the discussion, competition, and even strife between\nd\u00e0os and their advocates are factors in an ongoing\nnatural \u9053 d\u00e0oguiding process. We and\nour circumstances change as we each find, choose and walk different\nnaturally evolving paths.\n\nThis does not entail we should not advocate our own way. Such\nexchanges are part of the natural process of construction of \u9053\nd\u00e0ospaths and making them available to\nothers. Such a dialogue of competing d\u00e0os constitutes\nthe natural evolutional d\u00e0o of guidance. Realizing\nthis, we should not flatter ourselves, posing as the Confucian father\nshaping his child\u2019s character, but as a contributor in this\ncompetition among similarly natural ways. We express perspectives\nlocated in a real world of indexed points from which we choose\nbehavioral paths.\nSome characters in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues wonder\nabout exceptional figures who allegedly have abilities that justify\nthat paternal posture\u2014the capacity to transcend our location in\npoints of view and to lecture all of us from a privileged\nperspective. The Zhuangzi\u2019s response typically remind\nthem that such idealized points of view are neither intelligible to us\nnor relevant to what we should do. Either these exceptional\nobservers have their own naturally\nch\u00e9ngfixed frames of reference in the\nnatural world, or they are outside of the natural world in some\nunrealistically free realm. If the latter, then their views are both\nunintelligible and irrelevant to us. What they would do in our\nsituation does not constitute helpful advice to us. To advocate\nfollowing the advice of these ideal observers is to speak practical\nnonsense to non-ideal, actual actors.\n\nGap Tooth, following Kingsley\u2019s skeptical formulation\n above says:\n\nSo you don\u2019t know what is beneficial or harmful, does the\n\u201cfully arrived human\u201d necessarily not know them?\u00a0\nKingsley replied, \u201cthe fully arrived person becomes pure\nsapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any\nheat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he\ncouldn\u2019t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize\nmountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience\nsurprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the\nsun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans.\u00a0 Death and life\nare not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and\nharm.\u201d\n\nMaster Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from\nmy teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth\nengaging, doesn\u2019t pursue utility, doesn\u2019t avoid harm,\ndoesn\u2019t take delight in striving, doesn\u2019t follow\nd\u00e0os, in silence says things, and in saying things is\nsilent, and roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world. Master\nregarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution of a\nmysterious d\u00e0o. My kind sir what do you say of\nthis?\u201d\n\nZhang Wu replied, \u201cThis is something that, were the yellow\nemperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes\nof Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to\nconclusions\u2026 . I\u2019ll give you some absurd talk and you absurdly\nlisten.\u201d (Ibid., HY 6/2/71\u20137)\n\n However, in later chapters, Zhuangzi himself seems to recommend to\nus examples of such spectacular capacities\u2014the most beautifully\nand elaborately expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher\nDing.\nButcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point\nof contact, the way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the\nangle of his knee \u2026 gliding, flowing! The knife sang\n\u201cwhuaa\u201d with nothing out of tune. It was as if he were\ndancing the Faun Ballet or directing an opera. \nLord Wen Hui exclaimed \u201cOle! Splendidly done! Can talent\nextend even to this?.\n\nButcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining, \n\n\u201cWhat your\nservant pursues is d\u00e0o; which is what skill aims\nat. When I began to carve oxen, what I saw was nothing but the\noxen. After three years, I had ceased seeing them as wholes, and now\nmy sapience mingles so that I don\u2019t see with my eyes, Sensory\nknow-how ends and my sapient desires take over my performance. I rely\non natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer\nthrough empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where\ncords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones. \nA good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks\nchange knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it;\nit\u2019s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had\njust taken it from the sharpener.\n\n  Those joints have gaps, and the knife\u2019s edge no thickness, to\nput something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It\neven allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why,\nwith 19 years on it, this knife\u2019s edge is grindstone\nfresh.\u201d\n(Ibid., 7/3/2\u20138)\n The Zhuangzi plays several variations on this theme.\nSometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod,\nanother crafts chariot wheels, there are musicians, debaters, and\nthieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise\nin coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes\nflashing by while slithering on their stomachs, One implicit example\nis Zhuangzi\u2019s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy,\nHui Shi. Bemoaning his loss while visiting his sidekick\u2019s grave,\nZhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower who sliced specks off\nthe nose of his crony, but lost his \u201cknack\u201d when his\nco-performer passed away. (Ibid., HY 66/24/48\u201351)\n The tales often highlight the tranquil state that accompanies\nbehavior that skillfully follows a natural path. The performances look\nand feel effortless. The spontaneity of the flow along a natural path\ngives performers the sense that their behavior is\n\u201cworld-guided\u201d rather than internally controlled.  These\nbehaviors become second-nature. We move beyond anything like\nsub-vocalizing instructions, deliberating or reflecting\u2014and yet we\nare concentrating intently on the behavior. The range of his examples\nreminds us that such satisfying states of performance can be\nexperienced in even the most low caste and mundane of activities,\nincluding butchering, criminal skills, as well as in the finest of\narts, and philosophy. \n\nAnother feature of this theme is the observation that such expertise\nin performance always comes with some kind of limitation\u2014not\nleast that each example is a different person with a different\nknack. There is no shortcut d\u00e0o that gives you a knack\nat every activity. Cook Ding \u201ccomes to a hard place;\u201d the\ncicada catcher tries to balance two coins on his stick\u2014if he is\nnot calm enough, he will have a bad night. The wheelwright could not\nteach his son the art; the musician cannot play all the notes and only\nreaches true perfection when he dwells in silence. And above all, the\nvalorization of this kind of specialization in an art pulls in the\nopposite direction of Zhuangzi\u2019s encouragement to broaden and\nenlarge our perspectives and scope of appreciation. \n\nThis theme of the limits of virtuosity is pursued explicitly in the Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndiscussion of the necessary connection of\n\u6210 ch\u00e9ngcompletion:success and\n\u8667 ku\u012b failure:deficiency. The theme of\nthis weak skeptical relativism plays out smoothly into the classical\nChinese focus on paths as the model of normativity and the objects of\nknowledge. Paths are everywhere, but guide natural kinds from particular space-time\nlocations and can guide a wide range of behavior types, normative\nsubject matters. Each leads to subsequent choices among\nd\u00e0ospaths.\nZhuangzi does not ground his\nskepticism in an account of specifically human epistemic\ndeficiencies. We are one among many natural creatures with different\ncapacities choosing paths from their indexed point in space and time.\nThe skeptical theme is the wide range of our different\nperspectives. We are limited mainly in the sense that there is no\nbehavior from the point of view of the whole\u2014there is no omniscient\nperspective on the path structure. We may wonder if we have discovered\nall the available \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths. And\nwe may always wonder if our judgment about which is best now is about\nthe best in the long run. All we can substitute for this global\nperspective is some local consensus.\nSubstantively, in the end, is there success and defect?\nSubstantively, in the end, is there neither success nor defect?....If\nwe can call these successful, then even I am also successful. If they\ncannot be called successful, then neither I nor any other thing may be\ncalled successful. For this reason, illumination of slippery doubt is\nthat which sages target. For this reason, we do not use it and let\nthings rest in the conventional. (Ibid., HY\n5/2/42\u201347)\n\nThe weak skeptical conclusion is most strikingly expressed in the\nobservation that introduces the chapter with the story of Cook\nDing. \n My life is limited and know-how is unlimited. To pursue\nthe unlimited with the limited is dangerous. (Ibid., HY\n7/3/1)\n",
