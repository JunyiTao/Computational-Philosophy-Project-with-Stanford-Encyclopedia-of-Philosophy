    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || The Social Construction of Race\n3.2 The Social Construction of Race\n\nRace itself is a historically and culturally specific aspect of\nhuman experience (Gossett 1965; Hannaford 1996; Augstein 1996).\nAlthough there are precursors in earlier periods, most believe that the\nmain way the concept of race has been defined in the modern era\u2014as\nsignifying inherited, stable dispositions and capacities linked to\nphysical characteristics\u2014emerged within Europe during its era of\nglobal empire. The idea of ranked, permanent human differences\nmotivated or rationalized state policies governing a variety of social\nprotections, inclusions and exclusions, from suffrage to immigration to\nproperty rights.\n\nThis history may make race appear to be something imposed on the\nself. The idea that race has been socially constructed is sometimes\npresented in this way: that external forces have constructed social\nidentities as a way to divide and rank and ultimately exploit and\noppress. On this view, while the individual has been categorized and\ngrouped by political systems, with a subsequently curtailed (or\nmagnified) agency, we are still essentially individuals free to engage\nin self-making.\n\nOn this version of social construction, two important ideas follow.\nThe first is that philosophical treatments of the self, moral agency,\npersonal identity, linguistic capacity, normative practices of\ncognition and so on can be pursued separately from, or prior to, an\nengagement with questions of social categories of identity such as\nrace. And this accords with standard philosophical practices currently\nin place. The second implication is that the most liberating approach\nto race will be to deflate its significance and eliminate it from\nsocial life. If it is only contingently related to our identity, and\nhas been used to legitimate discrimination, we should strive to reduce\nthe power of race (Haslanger 2011; Glasgow et al. 2019). Some states,\nsuch as France, use such arguments to disallow the gathering of\nstatistics that involve racial as well as ethnic and religious\nidentity.\n\nTheories that take a social constructionist approach to race often\nunderstandably focus on the nefarious ways race has been constructed.\nYet, by unseating the biological determinist view of race, social\nconstructionist approaches can also instigate reflection on the varied\nfunctions of racial terms--to signal collectivity, for example--as well\nas their open-ended future. Philosophers of race as well as other\ntheorists have put a lot of work into showing how the concept was built\non the colonizing ideologies and practices that served economic as well\nas other ends (Harris 1999; Mills 1997, 2017). But eliminativists about\nrace have to do more than reveal the problematic genealogy of the\nconcept: they also must show that the meaning of race is uniform and\neliminating the concept is both possible and desirable.\n\nCritical Philosophers of Race have generally argued that the\nelimination of race terms will encroach on our ability to retain an\neffective historical consciousness, which hermeneuticists such as\nHans-Georg Gadamer described as central to the capacity to reason well\n(Gadamer 1975 [2004]). On the hermeneutic view, individuals engage in the work\nof judgment and interpretation while embedded within particular\ntraditions, but eliminativism could disable the self-reflection this\ncalls for. And for phenomenologists such as Sartre, at least in his\nlater works, the self is the product of a dialectical interaction\nbetween the particulars of one\u2019s social situation and the choices\none makes as an individual. As Donna-Dale Marcano explains,\nSartre\u2019s approach \u201cenables us to explain how and why\nmembers of an oppressed group positively assume and create an identity\nfor ourselves\u201d grounded in that group experience: in order to\nacknowledge the importance of this shared history as well as the forms\nof resistance that have had a hand in shaping our current social\nidentities (Marcano 2003, 25). The desirability of forgetting this\nhistory may vary across groups, since some might wish to forget\natrocities that played a role in their family enrichment, while others\nwish the world to remember the lessons of the past as well as the\nhistory of group resistance and survival. If our selves are indeed the\nproduct of dialectical engagement, a philosophical treatment of\nidentity and the self will need to incorporate the situated and\nrelational elements that play a significant role in constituting us,\nand this will include our racialized identities. This approach is not\nantithetical to a social constructionist theory but one form it can\ntake.\n\nThe history of race reveals its fundamentally social origin and many\nnefarious uses, but not the reach of its dynamism. Although race is an\nimportant element in our histories, this does not mean there are no\nsimilarities across racial groups, no significant differences within\ngroups, or that racial meanings will remain stable. Yet, still, as\nMills emphasizes, race has such a significant impact on our lives it\ncannot but affect what we know, how we know, and how we understand\nourselves in relation to our worlds (Mills 1998).\n",
