    "main_text": "Poetic format\n3. Poetic format\n\nLucretius writes in Latin verse to spread the gospel of Epicurus, who\nwrote in Greek prose two and a half centuries before him. A\npreliminary review may best allow us to consider how Lucretius\nadapted Epicurus\u2019 message to his own poetic medium and Roman\nworld. The present section covers poetic format, the next the\nEpicurean background and sources. Some readers may prefer to skip\ndirectly to section 5 on the contents of the DRN and read the\nnext two sections once they are more familiar with the poem.\n\nLucretius expounds his master\u2019s message in Latin hexameter,\nadapting the inherited genre of didactic epic. Greek didactic epic,\nwhich starts with Hesiod, standardly features a teacher offering\n(fictional) live instruction on a given field of knowledge to a\nstudent or addressee in need of such instruction. This continues to be\nstandard in Latin didactic (Volk 2002). In the DRN, Memmius,\nstanding in for the audience, is depicted as a beginner, which may not\nhave been the case. Lucretius is not the doctrinal, much less the\ndivine authority of the DRN \u2013that is Epicurus, on both\ncounts\u2013 but he does actively instruct.\n\nAs his main Latin poetic influence, Lucretius adopts the archaic\nformat and diction of Ennius (239 \u2013169 BCE), whose epic the\nAnnales on the history of Rome in 18 books, now known only\nfrom fragments, was the Roman national epic until displaced by the\nAeneid. Couching his revolutionary message in this\nestablished format may have helped Lucretius make it more acceptable\nto his Roman audience and simultaneously prompt them to reflect\ncritically on traditional Roman values (Nethercut 2021). A second\nimportant Latin influence appears to have been Cicero\u2019s\nAratea of c. 89 BCE, the orator\u2019s youthful rendering in\nLatin verse of the first part of the Phaenomena by the\nHellenistic Greek poet Aratus (Gee 2013 chapters 3 and 4, and appendix\nB for full parallels). The Phaenomena, published c. 276 BCE,\nis a work on astronomy and weather-signs. As was widely recognised,\nmost of its subject-matter comes from the prose treatise of the same\nname by the fourth-century mathematician and scientist Eudoxus of\nCnidus. One of the more popular poems of antiquity, the\nPhaenomena was at the forefront of a trend in Hellenistic\ndidactic poetry, in which a poet could showcase his originality,\nlearnedness and virtuosity by taking on obscure or challenging\ntechnical subjects. For Lucretius, since unobservable atoms and void,\nthe most obscure topics possible (DRN 1.933 obscura de re),\nprovide the subject-matter of the DRN, and given that\nEpicurus wrote in a clear but often complex Greek prose saturated with\ntechnical terms, on these two criteria it makes sense to view him as\nan heir to the Hellenistic tradition of learned didactic (Kenney 1970,\nBrown 1982, Gale 2007). To be sure, when at 1.921\u201330 Lucretius\nadvertises his originality as the first Latin poet to attempt his\nsubject, he tells us that he does so, at least in part, for \u2018the\nhigh hope of renown\u2019. This is not necessarily incompatible with\nEpicureanism, though it hardly flows from it (on Epicurean poetics see\nsection 4). As for the challenge posed by Epicurean terminology,\nLucretius recognised it (1.136\u20139) and met it by opting, on the\nwhole, to avoid directly importing Greek technical terminology (Sedley\n1998 ch. 2).\n\nIn a more important respect, however, the framework of Hellenistic\ndidactic epic is less helpful if it implies that Lucretius merely\nused Epicureanism to generate some sublime poetry. On the\ncontrary, Lucretius\u2019 missionary fervour make it clear that the\nmedium serves the message and that the aim of the poem is to convert\nthe hearer to Epicureanism (Asmis 2016). This relation is most clearly\nset out in the important \u2018honey and wormwood\u2019 passage,\nfrom which I quote DRN 1.936\u201347:\n\nBut as with children, when physicians try to administer rank wormwood,\nthey first touch the rims about the cups with the sweet yellow fluid\nof honey, that unthinking childhood be deluded as far as the lips, and\nmeanwhile may drink up the bitter juice of the wormwood, and though\nbeguiled be not betrayed, but rather by such means be restored and\nregain health, so now do I: since this doctrine commonly seems\nsomewhat harsh to those who have not used it (haec ratio\nplerumque videtur/ tritior esse quibus non est tractata) and the\npeople shrink back from it, I have chosen to set forth our doctrine to\nyou in sweet-speaking Pierian song, and as it were to touch it with\nthe Muses\u2019 delicious honey\u2026 . (transl. Rouse-Smith with\nmodifications)\n\n\nPoetry sweetens the bitter medicine needed to restore the patient, so\nthat Lucretius subordinates his poetic activity, honey, to the cure\nand salvation that is instruction in Epicureanism (for more on the\npassage, Gale 2020). At the same time, this image of benevolent\ndeception is more complicated than it looks, since the medicine is not\nactually bitter, it only \u2018seems\u2019 so to those who have not\nexperienced it. Indeed, no later than the opening of Book 3, Lucretius\ndepicts himself as a bee flitting through Epicurus\u2019 works,\nfeasting on the honey of his \u2018golden words\u2019 (3.13, fuller\nquote in 4). The medicine has become the honey, it appears, at least\nfor those who have converted to Epicureanism.\n\nThe goal of philosophical conversion leads us to a last important\nGreek poetic influence, the philosopher-poet Empedocles of Acragas\n(490\u2013430 BCE). Lucretius singles Empedocles out for explicit\npraise at 1.729\u201333, even as he turns to criticize his elemental\ntheory from an atomist perspective. Empedocles was the father of Greek\nfour-element theories and was recognized as the canonical champion of\nGreek philosophical didactic poetry. Although we know his work only\nthrough fragments, the great number of identifiable allusions or\nborrowings in the DRN from Empedocles, along with the\nclustering of Empedoclean themes in the opening of Book 1, make it\nclear that Lucretius was positioning himself as the Roman Empedocles\n(Jobst 1907, Kranz 1944, Furley 1970, Sedley 1998, ch. 1).\nEmpedocles\u2019 goal was to convert the hearer to new\n\u2018scientific\u2019 understanding of the world. In one summing-up\npassage, he explains how all things (\u2018all that was, all that is,\nand all that will be hereafter\u2019, a Homeric formula he adapts to\nhis own aims) are to be understood as the products of the four eternal\nelements, earth, air, fire and water, acting under the alternating\ninfluence of two moving-psychological powers, Love and Hate (On\nnature 1.265\u201372 Laks Most 2016 D 73). This effectively\ndowngrades the world of experience to the rank of temporary products\nof a more fundamental, invariant principles. Despite other important\ndifferences, this is close enough to the atomist picture, both systems\nbeing attempts to save appearances from the Eleatic challenge\n(Mourelatos 1987; Wardie 1988; Burnyeat 2017). Empedocles was also\nwidely celebrated for his use of imagery. In particular, he pioneered\na new type of epic simile, one that displays multiple points of\ncorrespondence between a given biological process and\n\u2013usually\u2013 a technological analogue. Lucretius\u2019 own\ncareful use of imagery and poetic vividness owe much to Empedocles\n(West 1969, Schiesaro 1990, Garani 2007, Taylor 2020).\n\nSince 1998, the Strasbourg papyrus, eds. Martin and Primavesi, has\nshown that Empedocles\u2019 commitment to the afterlife of the soul\nmost likely stood alongside his scientific cosmology, not in\nopposition to it. Although scholarship has only begun to reckon with\nthis new factor, it appears to make the new Empedocles even more\nsuitable as a Lucretian model (for a sketch of how this might have\nworked, Tr\u00e9panier 2007). The clearest instance of this\ncrossover between science and religion is section d\nof the papyrus, where Empedocles loudly laments his meat-eating sins\neven as he turns to describe the origins of living creatures from the\nearth. This contrast in tones seems a plausible predecessor to\nLucretius\u2019 own two styles, the juxtaposition of cool technical\nsections with impassioned rhetorical passages. Next, if more\ncontroversially, the compresence in Empedocles of (Pythagorean?)\nreligion and Early Greek science suggests that the instruction itself\nwas framed as an \u2018assimilation to the divine\u2019. That is, the scientific\nquest for knowledge was understood as both natural and a form of\ndivinization for the pupil. This was an important theme in later\nphilosophy, Plato especially, but no less so in Epicureanism. In both\ncases it also requires redefining the concept of divinity against more\npopular inherited notions (see section 7).\n",
