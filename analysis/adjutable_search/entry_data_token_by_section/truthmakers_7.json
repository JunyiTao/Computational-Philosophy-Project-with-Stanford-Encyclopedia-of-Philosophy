    "main_text": "Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)? || Maximalism\n2.1 Maximalism\n\nTruth-maker maximalists demand that every truth has a\ntruth-maker\u2014no exceptions granted. So they advance the\ncompletely general principle,\n\n(Maximalism) \nFor every truth, then there must be something in the world that\nmakes it true.\n\n\nThe principle lies at one end of the spectrum of positions we can\npotentially occupy. At the other end, we find truth-maker\nnihilism, the idea that no truth needs to be made true because\n(roughly) the very idea of a truth-maker is a corrupt one: there is no\nsuch role as making something true for anything to perform.\nTruth-maker optimalism is the intermediate position that only\nsome truths stand in need of truth-makers: not so few that truth fails\nto be anchored in reality but not so many that we strain credulity\nabout the kinds of things there are.\n2.1.1 The Liar?\n\nMilne (2005) has offered the following knock-down, if not knock-out,\nargument against maximalism. Take the sentence,\n\n(M)\n This sentence has no truth-maker.\n\n\nSuppose that (M) has a truth-maker. Since it\u2019s made\ntrue, M must be true. And since it\u2019s true, what\n(M) says must also be the case: that M has no\ntruth-maker. So if (M) has a truth-maker then it\ndoesn\u2019t have a truth-maker. By reductio ad absurdum\n(M) therefore has no truth-maker. But this is just what\n(M) says. So, contra (Maximalism), there is at least\none sentence, (M), that is true without benefit of a\ntruth-maker.\n\nRodriguez-Pereyra (2006c) has responded to this argument by\nmaintaining that (M) is like the Liar sentence\n\n(L)\n This sentence is false.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar position in the philosophy of logic to respond\nto the inconsistency that arises from supposing that (L) is\neither true or false\u2014if it is, it isn\u2019t and if it\nisn\u2019t, it is\u2014that the sentence (L)\nisn\u2019t meaningful, despite superficial appearances (see, for a\nuseful introduction to these issues, Sainsbury 1995: 111\u201333).\nAccording to Rodriguez-Pereyra, because (M) is akin to the\nLiar sentence there\u2019s no reason to suppose that (M) is\nmeaningful either. But if (M) isn\u2019t meaningful then\n(M) certainly can\u2019t be true; in which case (M)\ncan\u2019t be a counterexample to maximalism either.\n\nThis response is flawed because, as Milne points out, (M) is\nimportantly unlike (L): (L) gives rise to an\noutright inconsistency when only elementary logic rules are applied to\nit; whereas (M) isn\u2019t inconsistent per se but\nonly when combined with a substantive metaphysical principle:\nmaximalism. If, by contrast, you don\u2019t believe in truth-makers\nthen you have every right to treat (M) as just another true\nsentence\u2014just as you have every right to think (P) is\ntrue if you don\u2019t believe in propositions,\n\n(P)\n This sentence does not express a proposition\n\n\nIt\u2019s only if one was (absurdly) to think that maximalism was a\nlogical truth that (M) could be intelligibly thought to be\n\u201cLiar-like\u201d. Of course, one person\u2019s modus\nponens is another\u2019s modus tollens. So if one\nalready had very strong independent reasons for being committed to\nmaximalism, Milne\u2019s argument would provide a reason for thinking\nthat (M) is meaningless (even though it isn\u2019t\nLiar-like). But even if there are such reasons\u2014or appear to\nbe\u2014we can\u2019t claim to have control of our subject matter\nuntil we have established what it is about the constitutive\nconnections that obtain between truth-making, truth and truth-bearers\nthat determines (M) to be meaningless (if it is); until\nwe\u2019ve established the lie of the land, we can\u2019t be sure\nthat we\u2019re not kidding ourselves thinking (M) to be\nmeaningless rather than maximalism to be false. The lesson repeats\nitself: a convincing theory of truth-makers requires a coeval theory\nof truth bearers.\n\nFor further discussion of the Liar Paradox in relation to\ntruth-making, see Milne 2013 and Barrio and Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2015.\n2.1.2 Could there be nothing rather than something?\n\nHere\u2019s another shot across the bows, this time from Lewis. Take\nthe most encompassing negative existential of all: absolutely nothing\nexists. Surely this statement is possibly true. But if it were true\nthen something would have to exist to make it true if the principle\nthat every truth has a truth-maker is to be upheld. But then there\nwould have to be something rather than nothing. So combining\nmaximalism with the conviction that there could have been nothing\nrather than something leads to contradiction (Lewis 1998: 220, 2001:\n611). So unless we already have reason to think there must be\nsomething rather than nothing\u2014as both Armstrong (1989b:\n24\u20135) and Lewis (1986: 73\u20134) think they\ndo\u2014maximalism is already in trouble.\n2.1.3 Maximalism is distinct from 1\u20131 Correspondence\n\nWhat is there to be said in defence of maximalism? Even though he\nfavours it, Armstrong finds himself obliged to admit that \u201cI do\nnot have any direct argument\u201d for recommending the position\n(2004: 7). Instead he expresses the hope that \n\n\nphilosophers of realist inclinations will be immediately attracted to\nthe idea that a truth, any truth, should depend for its truth for\nsomething \u201coutside\u201d it, in virtue of which it is true.\n\n\n\nLet us follow Armstrong\u2019s lead and treat maximalism as a\n\u201chypothesis to be tested\u201d. (See Schaffer 2008b: 308 for a\nmore direct argument that relies upon (Grounding-T).)\n\nMaximalism needs to be distinguished from the even stronger claim,\n\n(Correspondence) \nFor each truth there is exactly one thing that makes it true and\nfor each truth-maker there is exactly one truth made true by it.\n\n\nBut that there\u2019s clear blue water between these claims is\nevident if we combine maximalism with (Entailment)\u2014that\nwhatever makes a truth p true makes what p entails\ntrue too. So p and all of its consequences are not only all\nmade true (as maximalism demands) but they also share a truth-maker\n(as Correspondence denies). This takes us halfway to\nappreciating that so far from being an inevitably profligate\ndoctrine\u2014as its name suggests\u2014maximalism is compatible\nwith denying that some logically complex claims have their own bespoke\ntruth-makers. (The inspiration for thinking this way comes from the\nlogical atomism of Russell (1918\u201319) that admitted some\nlogically complex facts but not others\u2014it is to be contrasted\nwith Wittgenstein\u2019s version of the doctrine (1921) which\nadmitted only atomic facts.)\n\nSuppose, for the sake of expounding the view, that some truth-bearers\nare atomic. Also suppose that P and Q are atomic and\nt makes P true. Then, by Entailment,\nt makes P \u2228 Q true too. Similarly, if\ns makes P true and s* makes Q true\nthen, by Entailment, s and s* together make\nP & Q true. Since the task of making P\n\u2228 Q and P & Q true has already been\ndischarged by the truth-makers for the atomic truth bearers, there is\nno need to posit additional truth-makers for making these disjunctive\nand conjunctive truths true. Similar reasoning suggests that there is\nno need to posit bespoke truth-makers for existential generalisations\nor truths of identity either (Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 313;\nSimons 1992: 161\u20133; Armstrong 2004: 54\u20135). But maximalism\nis not thereby compromised: even though disjunctive and conjunctive\ntruths lack specific truth-makers of their own, they\u2019re still\nmade true by the truth-makers of the basic claims from which\nthey\u2019re compounded by the logical operations of disjunction and\nconjunction.\n2.1.4 The need for bespoke truth-makers\n\nBut positing truth-makers for atomic truths doesn\u2019t obviate the\nneed\u2014supposing maximalism\u2014to posit additional truth-makers\nfor negative and universal truths. This becomes apparent in the case\nof negative truths when we compare the truth-tables for conjunction\nand disjunction with the truth-table for negation. The former tell us\nthat the truth of a disjunctive formula is determined by the truth of\none or other of its disjuncts, whilst the truth of a conjunctive\nformula is determined by the truth of both its conjuncts. But the\ntruth-table for negation doesn\u2019t tell us how the truth of\n~P is determined by the truth of some other atomic formula\nQ from which ~P follows; it only tells us that\n~P is true iff P is false. The strategy for\navoiding bespoke truth-makers for logically complex truths can\u2019t\nget a grip in this case: there\u2019s no Q such that\nsupplying a truth-maker for it obviates the necessity of positing an\nadditional truth-maker for ~P (Russell 1918\u201319:\n209\u201311; Hochberg 1969: 325\u20137).\n\nThe problem is even starker for universal truths: there\u2019s no\ntruth-table for them because there is no set of atomic formulae whose\ntruth determines that a universally quantified formula is true too.\nWhy so? Because whatever true atomic formulae we light upon\n(Fa, Fb\u2026 Fn), it doesn\u2019t\nfollow from them that \u2200xFx is true. To extract the\ngeneral conclusion one would need to add to the premises that\na, b\u2026 n are all the things\nthere are; that there\u2019s no extra thing waiting in the wings to\nappear on stage that isn\u2019t F. But this extra premise is\nitself universally quantified, not atomic. So it can\u2019t be argued\nthat the truth-makers for Fa, Fb\u2026 Fn\nput together already discharge the task of making \u2200xFx\ntrue because they entail it (Russell 1918\u20139: 236\u20137;\nHochberg 1969: 335\u20137).\n2.1.4.1 Truth-makers for Negative Truths\n\nThe most straightforward response\u2014since we are treating\nmaximalism as a working hypothesis\u2014is to find more fitting\ntruth-makers for those truths that aren\u2019t already made true by\nthe truth-makers for the atomic truths that entail them. Whilst\nlooking around for truth-makers for negative truths Russell reflected,\n\n\n\nThere is implanted in the human breast an almost unquenchable desire\nto find some way of avoiding the admission that negative facts are as\nultimate as those that are positive. (1919: 287)\n\n\nHe was right that our desire for positive facts and things makes us\nawkward about acknowledging that negative facts or things are the\ntruth-makers of negative truths. Nonetheless, discussions about\nwhether there are truth-makers for a given range of truth bearers on\none or the other side of the positive-negative divide are apt to\nappear nebulous. This is because, as Russell had himself previously\nnoted, there is \u201cno formal test\u201d or \u201cgeneral\ndefinition\u201d for being a negative fact; we \u201cmust go into\nthe meanings of words\u201d (1918\u201319: 215\u20136). Statements\nof the form \u201ca is F\u201d aren\u2019t\ninvariably positive (\u201cso-and-so is dead\u201d), nor are\nstatements of the form \u201ca isn\u2019t F\u201d\n(\u201cso-and-so isn\u2019t blind\u201d) always negative. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from the fact that a syntactic test cannot be\ngiven that there is nothing to the contrast between positive and\nnegative. Molnar suggests that the contrast can be put on a sound\nscientific footing. For Molnar, natural kinds are paradigm instances\nof the positive, to be identified on a posteriori grounds\n(2000: 73). To say that a thing belongs to a natural kind identified\nin this way is to state a positive fact. To state a negative fact is\nto negate a statement of a positive fact.\n\nIt\u2019s a very natural suggestion that if the negative claim that\na isn\u2019t F is true it\u2019s made true by the\nexistence of something positive that\u2019s incompatible\nwith a\u2019s being F (Demos 1917). For example,\nthe truth-maker for the claim that kingfishers aren\u2019t yellow is\nthe fact that they\u2019re blue because their being blue is\nincompatible with their being yellow. But what makes it true that\nthese colours are incompatible? The notion of incompatibility\nappears itself to be negative\u2014a relation that obtains between\ntwo states when it\u2019s not possible for them to obtain\ntogether. So this proposal threatens to become regressive: we\u2019ll\nneed to find another positive truth-maker for the further negative\nclaim that yellow and blue are incompatible, something whose obtaining\nis incompatible with the state of yellow and blue\u2019s being\ncompatible, and so on (Russell 1918\u20139: 213\u20135, 1919:\n287\u20139; Taylor 1952: 438\u201340; Hochberg 1969: 330\u20131;\nGrossman 1992: 130\u20131; Molnar 2000: 74\u20135; Simons 2008).\nThere\u2019s another worry: it\u2019s not obvious that there are\nenough positive states out there to underwrite all the negative truths\nthere are. Even though it may be true that this liquid is odourless\nthis needn\u2019t be because there\u2019s something further about it\nthat excludes its being odorous (Taylor 1952: 447; Mulligan, Simons,\n& Smith 1984: 314; Molnar 2000: 75; Armstrong 2004: 62\u20133;\nDodd 2007: 387).\n\nOne could circumvent the threatened regress by denying that the\nincompatibilities in question require truth-makers of their own\nbecause they\u2019re necessary truths and such truths are a\nlegitimate exception to maximalism\u2014because \u201cthey are true\ncome (or exist) what may\u201d (Simons 2005: 254; Mellor 2003: 213).\nThere is some plausibility to the idea that formal truths\n(tautologies) don\u2019t stand in need of truth-makers; their truth\nis settled by the truth-tables of the logical constants. But material\nnecessary truths\u2014such as that expressed by \u201cyellow is\nincompatible with blue\u201d\u2014appear to make just as substantive\ndemands upon the world as contingent truths do (Molnar 2000: 74). In a\nsense they appear to make even more of a demand since the world must\nbe so endowed that it could not in any circumstances have failed to\nlive up to the expectations of material necessary truths. It\u2019s a\npeculiar feature of our philosophical culture that even though\nit\u2019s almost universally acknowledged that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nplan (1921: 6.37) to show all necessity is logical necessity ended in\nfailure\u2014indeed foundered upon the very problem of explaining\ncolour incompatibilities\u2014that so many philosophers continue to\nthink and talk as though the only necessities were formal ones so that\nnecessary truths don\u2019t need truth-makers (MacBride 2011:\n176\u20137).\n\nRussell reluctantly chose to acknowledge negative facts as\ntruth-makers for negative truths. He just couldn\u2019t see any way\nof living without them. But negative facts are an unruly bunch. Try to\nthink of all the ways you are. Contrast that with the even harder task\nof thinking of all the ways you aren\u2019t! If negative truths are\nacknowledged as truth-makers they will have to be indefinitely\nnumerous, unbounded in their variety; choosing to live with them is a\nheavy commitment to make (Armstrong 2004: 55). What\u2019s worse, if\nnegative facts are akin to positive facts\u2014as their name\nsuggests\u2014then they must be made up out of things, properties and\nrelations arranged together. But, prima facie, many of these\nthings, properties and relations aren\u2019t existing elements of\nreality. So unless, like Meinong, we believe in the non-existent,\nwe\u2019ll have to admit that negative facts aren\u2019t\nconfigurations of their constituents and so an entirely different kind\nof entity from positive facts altogether (Molnar 2000: 77; Dodd 2007:\n388).\n\nIt is for such reasons that Armstrong counsels us to adopt a more\nparsimonious account of what makes negative truths true (2004:\n56\u20139). Armstrong\u2019s own account lies at the opposite\nextreme to Russell\u2019s. Whereas Russell posited indefinitely\nmany negative facts to make negative truths true, Armstrong\nposits just one thing that\u2019s responsible for making\nthem all true, viz. a totality fact.\n\nWe should register C.B. Martin\u2019s doubt that this is throwing out\nthe baby with the bath water (1996: 59). According to Martin, we\nalready recognise in ordinary discourse that different negative truths\nhave different truth-makers\u2014not just one as Armstrong proposes.\nFor example, we recognise that what makes it true that there is no oil\nin this engine is different from what makes it true that there are no\ndodos left. What makes claims like these true are absences, lacks,\nlimits, holes and voids, where these are conceived not as things but\nas \u201clocalised states of the world\u201d, robustly\nfirst-order and \u201ccausally relevant\u201d to what goes on\n(Martin 1996: 58, 65\u20136; Taylor 1952: 443\u20135). But, as many\nphilosophers have argued, when we talk about an absence having causal\neffects what we\u2019re really saying can be understood without\nreifying negative states and appealing instead to the actual effects,\nor the counterfactual effects, of a positive state (Molnar 2000:\n77\u201380; Armstrong 2004: 64\u20137; Lewis 2004; Beebee 2004).\n\n2.1.4.2 Truth-makers for general truths\n\nArmstrong\u2019s grand design is to sweep away the difficulties that\nattend the admission of negative facts by positing a special kind of\ngeneral fact that also serves as the truth-maker for general truths.\nRussell admitted general facts too but he acknowledged that, \u201cI\ndo not profess to know what the right analysis of general facts\nis\u201d (Russell 1918\u20139: 236\u20137). But Armstrong has gone\nfurther and assigned to general facts the following structure: a\ngeneral, or totality fact consists in a binary relation T of\ntotality that holds between an aggregate on the one hand and\na property on the other when the aggregate comprises all the\nitems that fall under the property in question (Armstrong 1989b:\n93\u20134, 1997: 199\u2013200, 2004: 72\u20135).\n\nFor example, China, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and the\nU.S.A. comprise the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.\nSo the aggregate (A) of them bears the T relation to\nthe property (P) of being a permanent member of the Council\n(T(A, P)). Since the aggregate bears that\nrelation to that property, there can be other permanent members of the\nCouncil who aren\u2019t already included in it. So the totality fact\nT(A, P) suffices for the general truth that\nChina, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and the U.S.A are\nall its members. It also suffices for the truth of the\nnegative existential that there are no other members of the\nCouncil. So once we\u2019ve recognised that T(A, P)\nexists, there\u2019s no need to recognise additional bespoke\ntruth-makers for these negative truths.\n\nIn a similar way Armstrong endeavours to sweep away the need for\nnegative facts by affirming \u201cthe biggest totality state of all,\nthe one embracing all lower-order states of affairs\u201d, i.e., the\nexistence of a totality state that consists in an aggregate of all the\n(1st order) states of affairs there are related by\nT to the property of being a (1st order)\nstates of affairs (2004: 75). It\u2019s one of Armstrong\u2019s\nabiding contentions that the world is \u201ca world of states of\naffairs, with particulars and universals only having existence within\nstates of affairs\u201d (1989: 94). Consequently this totality state\ncomprises a vast swathe of what exists\u2014whether particulars,\nuniversals or states of affairs that consist in particulars having\nuniversals. So it follows from the existence of this totality fact\nthat there are no more (1st order) states of affairs that\nare not already included in the aggregate of states that T\nrelates to the property of being a (1st order) states\nof affairs. Nor are there any particulars or (1st\norder) universals had by those particulars that are not constituents\nof the state of affairs included in that aggregate. It also follows\nthat there are no more particulars or (1st order)\nuniversals. So this totality fact serves as truth-maker for all these\nnegative truths.\n\nIt is sometimes objected that such totality facts are just negative\nfacts in disguise: \u201cTotality statements state the non-existence\nof certain entities, they state \u2018no more facts\u2019\u201d; so\nwe should reject totality facts if we are dissatisfied with negative\nones (Molnar 2000: 81\u20132; Dodd 2007: 389). Armstrong responds to\nthis charge with equanimity: \u201cIt is not denied, of course, that\nthe totalling or alling relation involves negation. It sets a limit to\nthe things of that sort\u201d (2004: 73). But if negation has indeed\nbeen smuggled into the description of the role that T\nperforms in comprising a totality state then it is difficult to avoid\nthe suspicion that Armstrong has simply exchanged many negative facts\nfor one big one. But we may think of Armstrong\u2019s contribution in\na different way. There are two ostensible concerns that negative\nstates of affairs present. First, there is a concern about their\nnumber. Second, there is a concern about, so to speak, their\nnegativity. Armstrong has addressed the first concern by\nshowing how we may reduce the number of negative states of affairs.\nBut the second concern neither cannot be met\u2014because, as\nArmstrong reflects, we cannot eliminate negation from our description\nof the world.\n\nIt has also been objected that Armstrong\u2019s position gives rise\nto a \u201cparadox of totality\u201d (Armstrong 1989: 94, 1997:\n198\u20139, 2004: 78\u20139; Cox 1997: 53\u201360; Molnar 2000:\n81). Take the totality state of affairs that comprises all the\n(1st order) state of affairs. Since this (2nd\norder) state is itself a state of affairs it follows that the initial\naggregate of (1st order) states of affairs failed to\ncomprise all the states of affairs there are. So there must be a\nfurther totality state that comprised the aggregate of all of them.\nBut this (3rd order) state is also a state of affairs so it\nwill need to be added to the mix too, and so ad\ninfinitum.\n\nArmstrong responds to this objection with equanimity too: \n\n\nwe can afford to be casual about this infinite series. For after the\nfirst fact of totality these \u201cextra\u201d states of affairs are\nall supervenient. As such, we do not have to take them with\nontological seriousness. (1989b: 94)\n\n\nTo understand this we need to appreciate that Armstrong\u2019s notion\nof supervenience is non-standard: \u201can entity Q\nsupervenes upon entity P if and only if it is impossible that\nP should exist and Q not exist\u201d or, in other words that\nthe existence of P entails the existence of Q.\n(Armstrong 1997: 11). He also holds a non-standard conception of\nontological commitment, viz. that \u201cWhat supervenes is\nno addition of being\u201d (Armstrong 1997: 12, 2004: 23\u20134).\nArmstrong\u2019s idea is (roughly) that to be a genuine addition to\nbeing is to be a net (indispensable) contributor to the schedule of\ntruth-makers for all the truths. But supervenient entities are\nsuperfluous as truth-makers. If the existence of an R entails\nthe existence of a certain S which in turn entails the truth\nof P, then R already makes P true so there\nis no need to include S in the inventory of truth-makers. It\nfollows that supervenient entities, like S, are no addition\nof being (Lewis 1992: 202\u20133).\n\nNow bring this non-standard conception of ontological commitment to\nbear upon the envisaged infinite series of totality facts. It is\nimpossible that the 2nd order totality fact comprising all\nthe 1st order states of affairs exist and the 3rd order\ntotality fact comprising all the 1st and 2nd\norder states not exist. So the 3rd totality fact\u2014or\nany other state higher-order than it\u2014is entailed by the\nexistence of the 2nd order totality state. So all of these\nn > 2 higher-order totality states supervene on it.\nThat\u2019s why Armstrong doesn\u2019t think we need to take any of\nthem with ontological seriousness.\n\nWhat should we make of this non-standard conception of ontological\ncommitment in terms of truth-making: that to be is to be a\ntruth-maker? Cameron (2008c) has proposed that this conception should\nreplace the standard one that to be is to be the value of a\nvariable. But this threatens to cut off the branch the advocates of\ntruth-maker theory are sitting on: if they disavow that existential\nquantification is ontologically committing then they will be left\nwithout a means of determining the ontological commitments of\ntruth-maker theory itself, i.e., the theory that gives the inventory,\nusing existential quantification, of what makes all the truths true\n(Schaffer 2010: 16\u20137).\n\nOf course, if someone grants that existential quantification is\nontologically committing in the context of a theory of\ntruth-makers then they won\u2019t stultify themselves in this way\n(Heil 2003: 9, 2009: 316\u20137, Simons 2010: 200). But this just\nseems like special pleading. An argument is owed that we can\u2019t\nlegitimately commit ourselves to the existence of things that perform\ntheoretical roles outside the theory of truth-makers (MacBride 2011:\n169). Why should there be only one theoretical dance allowed in town?\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we allow that there are other theoretical roles\nfor existing things to perform? Indeed it\u2019s a very real\npossibility that when we come to understand the capacity of the\ntruth-makers to make truth-bearers true we will find ourselves\nembroiled in commitment to the existence of other things in their\nexplanatory wake that aren\u2019t truth-makers themselves. In fact\nArmstrong himself should have been one of the first to recognise this.\nFor it has been an abiding feature of Armstrong\u2019s world view\nthat we are obliged to acknowledge not only states affairs, which are\ntruth makers, but also properties and relations, constituents of\nstates of affairs, which aren\u2019t.\n\nMore generally, can we make any sense of the idea of \u201can\nontological free lunch\u201d? Why is something supervenient no\naddition to being? Even if we only ever came to recognise the\nexistence of one supervening entity would we not thereby have\nadded at least one extra item to our inventory of things that\nexist? Of course in the special case where the supervening entity is\nconstituted by the entities it supervenes upon\u2014i.e.,\nthe things that are already there\u2014it makes some sense to say\nthat it\u2019s not adding anything new; but it\u2019s not at all\nobvious that what Armstrong et al. declare to be ontological free\nlunches are constituted from the entities upon which they supervene\n(Melia 2005: 74\u20135). Accordingly Schulte (2011a, 2011b) argues\nthat no necessitarian or grounding account of truth-making can make\nsense of the notion of an ontological free lunch, maintaining instead\nthat truthmaker theory needs to be augmented with the idea that we are\noffering a reductive explanation when we make an explanation in terms\nof truthmakers\n\nWhere does this leave us? So long as Armstrong\u2019s non-standard\nconception of ontological commitment remains controversial, it also\nremains controversial whether the infinite series of totality facts to\nwhich Armstrong is \u201ccommitted\u201d may be dismissed as mere\nontological frippery.\n",
