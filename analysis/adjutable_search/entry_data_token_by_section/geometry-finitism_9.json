    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as direct analogs || Constructive approaches\n2.3 Constructive approaches\n\nThe originality of Suppes\u2019 approach resides in the fact that he\nproposes to formulate geometry as a practice of constructions,\ncomparable to Hjelmslev\u2019s work yet quite distinct. A\nconstruction is here to be understood in the elementary sense of\nproducing drawings or diagrams, using certain instruments, such as a\nruler and/or a compass, and not in the modern sense in foundational\nterms, i.e., a constructive, axiomatic foundation for geometry.\n\nTwo elements are important from the (strict) finitist perspective.\nFirstly, constructions can be formulated in a quantifier-free way; the\nexpression \u201cdraw a line\u201d does not imply that we need to\nspeak about the complete set of lines in a plane. \u201cDraw a\nline\u201d will result in a specific finite object, namely a line\nfragment on, e.g., a piece of paper. Secondly, all models considered\nwill be finite, because no matter what constructions are performed,\nthe starting point will always be a finite set of points.\n\nSuppes considers two basic operations: the operation \\(B\\), that\ncorresponds with bisecting a line \\(ab\\) and the operation \\(D\\), that\ncorresponds with doubling a line \\(ab\\). A step \\(C_{i}\\) in a\nconstruction consists of three elements: the first element is the\n(new) point to be constructed, the second element is a pair of points\nthat are already present, and the third element is either \\(B\\) or\n\\(D\\), according to what operation is selected. The starting position\nconsists of three given points, \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nExample: consider the construction \\(((d, ac, B), (e, bd, D))\\)\nconsisting of two steps. The first step says to start with \\(ac\\) and\nconstruct the mid-point \\(d\\), and in the second step we take the\nsegment \\(bd\\) and double it. A diagrammatic representation makes\nclear what is happening:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nStarting from the triple \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\), we have constructed the\nparallelogram abce.\n\nOf course, merely listing a set of constructions is not sufficient to\ntalk about a geometrical theory, so it has to be shown, as it is\nindeed done by Suppes, that a formal-axiomatic treatment is possible.\nIt suffices to list a set of necessary axioms about the \\(B\\) and\n\\(D\\) operations, so that one can prove that the figure drawn in the\nexample above is indeed a parallelogram. In addition a representation\ntheorem is proven such that points are attributed rational\ncoordinates.\n\nTwo important comments must be made. First, it remains to be shown\nthat this elementary geometrical theory can be expanded all the way\ninto a full-fledged geometrical theory that can be considered a\nplausible alternative to classical geometry. Suppes himself seems\nquite confident as he writes:\n\n\nmy own conviction is that one can go the entire distance, or certainly\nalmost the entire distance, in a purely finitistic way, \u2026\n(2001: 136)\n\n\nSecondly, the focus on constructions opens up a novel way to deal with\nthe problem of the distance function. We do not need a general\ndistance function, but, for each separate case, we have to be able to\nattribute coordinates to the points present in the diagram and nothing\nmore. It remains to be seen however whether the basic operations,\n\\(B\\) and \\(D\\), can be extended without losing this important\nproperty.\n\nA more recent constructive proposal has been formulated by Burke\n(2022). Although quite similar to what Suppes proposed, there is at\nleast one major difference. Burke only talks about points and not\nabout lines (that is, lines are reduced to a finite number of points\nto identify them). The formal language contains both elementary\noperations or constructions and elementary relations. The former deal\nwith: (C1) (directed) segment extension, (C2) crossbar (the\n\u2018line\u2019 formed by two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on opposite\nsides of a line \\(cd\\) intersects \\(cd\\) in a point), (C3) angle\ntransport, (C4) circle-circle intersection, and (C5) orthogonality.\nThe latter consist of: (R1) the well-known betweenness relation, (R2)\nsegment congruence, (R3) same angle orientation, (R4) angle\ncongruence, and (R5) coplanarity. Burke, like Suppes, also uses a\nquantifier free first-order predicate logic for the same reason. There\nare two additional features to be mentioned. The first one is that\neach construction starts with a finite number of points within a\nfinite area. He then proves that no matter what elementary\nconstruction is performed, at the end the area will at most have\ndoubled in size. The second one is that his approach is easily\nextendible from the plane to 3D-space.\n\nA similar remark can be made here about the possibility of a distance\nfunction in Burke\u2019s approach. In\n section 2.5\n I will address this issue separately and discuss how one can deal\nwith this problem in a finitist setting. First, however, a quite\ndifferent approach from the physical side.\n",
