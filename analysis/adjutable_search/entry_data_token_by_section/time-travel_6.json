    "main_text": "The Grandfather Paradox || Inexplicable Occurrences\n2.3 Inexplicable Occurrences\nReturn again to the original version of the Grandfather\nparadox and Lewis\u2019s \u2018commonplace\nreasons\u2019 response to it.  This response engenders a\nfurther objection.  The autoinfanticidal time traveller is\nattempting to do something impossible (render herself permanently dead from\nan age younger than her age at the time of the attempts).  Suppose we\naccept that she will not succeed and that what will stop her is\na succession of commonplace occurrences.  The previous objection was that\nsuch a succession is improbable.  The new objection is that the\nexclusion of the time traveler from successfully committing\nauto-infanticide is mysteriously inexplicable.  The worry is as\nfollows.  Each particular event that foils the time traveller is explicable\nin a perfectly ordinary way; but the inevitable combination of these events\namounts to a ring-fencing of the forbidden zone of\nautoinfanticide\u2014and this ring-fencing is\nmystifying.  It\u2019s like a grand conspiracy to stop the time traveler from\ndoing what she wants to do\u2014and yet there are no\nconspirators: no time lords, no magical forces of logic.  This is\nprofoundly perplexing.  Riggs (1997, 52) writes:\n\u201cLewis\u2019s account may do for a once only attempt,\nbut is untenable as a general explanation of Tim\u2019s continual lack\nof success if he keeps on trying.\u201d Ismael (2003,\n308) writes: \u201cConsidered individually, there will\nbe nothing anomalous in the explanations\u2026It is\nalmost irresistible to suppose, however, that there is something anomalous\nin the cases considered collectively, i.e., in our unfailing lack of\nsuccess.\u201d See also Gorovitz (1964,\n366\u20137), Horwich (1987,\n119\u201321) and Carroll (2010, 86).\nThere have been two different kinds of defense of time travel\nagainst the objection that it involves mysteriously inexplicable\noccurrences.  Baron and Colyvan (2016, 70) agree with the objectors\nthat a purely causal explanation of failure\u2014e.g. Tim\nfails to kill Grandfather because first he slips on a banana peel,\nthen his gun jams, and so on\u2014is insufficient.  However they\nargue that, in addition, Lewis offers a non-causal\u2014a\nlogical\u2014explanation of failure: \u201cWhat explains\nTim\u2019s failure to kill his grandfather, then, is something about logic;\nspecifically: Tim fails to kill his grandfather because the law of\nnon-contradiction holds.\u201d Smith (2017) argues that the\nappearance of inexplicability is illusory.  There are no scenarios\nsatisfying the description \u2018a time traveller commits\nautoinfanticide\u2019 (or changes the past in any other way) because\nthe description is self-contradictory (e.g. it involves the time\ntraveller permanently dying at 20 and also being alive at 40).  So\nwhatever happens it will not be \u2018that\u2019.  There is\nliterally no way for the time traveller not to fail.  Hence there is\nno need for\u2014or even possibility of\u2014a substantive\nexplanation of why failure invariably occurs, and such failure is not\nperplexing.\n",
