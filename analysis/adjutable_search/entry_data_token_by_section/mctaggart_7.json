    "main_text": "Other Interesting Metaphysical Views\n9. Ethics\n\n\nIt is fair to say that McTaggart dedicated much more of philosophical\nenergy to metaphysics than ethics. That said, McTaggart did have\ninteresting ethical views, some of which will be discussed here.\n\n\nIn the Hegelian phase of McTaggart\u2019s career, McTaggart defended a\nform of consequentialism in which the ultimate good coincided with what\nis ultimately real: a series of persons each of whose final end is in\ncomplete harmony with the universe (and so with the final ends of every\nother individual), resulting in the happiness of each\n individual.[37]\nAlthough the\nproduction of this ultimate good is our obligation, it is exceedingly\ndifficult for us to know which actions of ours are what we ought to do.\nFor this reason, McTaggart suggests that we need a\n\u2018criterion\u2019 for moral rightness, i.e., a decision-procedure\nsuch that if we follow it we are most apt to do what we ought to do.\nMcTaggart argues that a form of hedonistic utilitarianism is the best\ncriterion for moral rightness that we can reasonably hope\n for.[38]\nMcTaggart\ngrants that sometimes this criterion could give incorrect results, and\nthat since following it is not a certain guide to what is right, we\nmust admit that our ethical knowledge is limited and incomplete.\n\n\nThe latter McTaggart was a moral realist cut from the same cloth as\nhis former student G.E. Moore. He held that (intrinsic)\ngoodness and badness were simple qualities, not\nreducible to non-normative properties, and not reducible to the\nrelation is intrinsically better than. (See chapter 64 of the\nsecond volume of the Nature of Existence for\ndiscussion.)\n\n\nThe fundamental bearers of intrinsic value are either\npersons (or other conscious beings) or states of\npersons (which in turn he took to be proper parts of\npersons). Because no person is a part of another person, the universe\nitself cannot be taken to be a fundamental bearer of intrinsic\nvalue. Therefore, one can say of the universe that it is intrinsically\ngood or intrinsically bad only if one means by this either something\nabout the average value of parts of the universe or by their total\nvalue. (This view is defended in \u201cThe Individualism of\nValue\u201d, reprinted in Philosophical Studies.)  McTaggart\nopts for the latter view, and for this reason, McTaggart\naccepts the repugnant conclusion, which is that a universe\ncontaining millions of people whose lives are barely worth living\nmight be better than a world containing far fewer people, each of whom\nlive lives of spectacular value. McTaggart notes that this conclusion\nwould be repugnant to certain moralists, but sees no reason to think\n\u2018repugnance in this case would be right.\u2019 (See section 870\nof the second volume of the Nature of Existence.)\n\n\nAlthough persons or states of persons are the bearers of intrinsic\nvalue, they have their value in virtue of having other properties.\nMcTaggart was an ethical pluralist, granting that many different sorts\nof properties can contribute to the value of a state of a person.\nPleasure and pain are both intrinsically valuable (the latter having\nnegative value, of course), and both are present in timeless reality.\nPain is always intrinsically bad, regardless of whether the recipient\nof the pain deserves to be in pain. On the basis of this claim,\nMcTaggart argued against the justifiability of vindictive punishment.\n(See Some Dogmas of Religion, section 133, as well as\n\u201cHegel\u2019s Theory of Punishment\u201d, which further\ndevelops this view; chapter five of Studies in Hegelian\nCosmology is devoted to a discussion of punishment.) And\nunfortunately, delusory perceptions, of which we are susceptible, are\nintrinsically bad. For this reason, McTaggart concludes that absolute\nreality is not free from intrinsic disvalue. (Even if pain is illusory,\nthe illusion that there is pain is real, and is itself bad. See\nhis Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic, page 155.) For this\nreason, Hegel\u2019s attempts to prove that the absolute is perfect\nare doomed to\n failure.[39]\n\nLove is central in McTaggart\u2019s theory of the good. Love is not to\nbe identified with benevolence, which McTaggart did not regard as an\nemotion but rather as a desire to do good for others. Furthermore, love\nis not to be identified with sympathy or sexual desire, but may\noccasion both. Love is not invariably caused by pleasure and it does\nnot invariably cause pleasure. We might be caused to love someone\nbecause of that person\u2019s qualities, but we do not love that\nperson\u2019s qualities but rather the person himself. We can love a\nperson whom we do not believe to be good.\n\n\nAccording to McTaggart, love is \u201csupremely\u201d good. By\nthis, McTaggart does not mean that love is incommensurably better than\nall other goods; were it, the smallest increase in love would be\ngreater than any other increase in any other valuable thing. However,\nlove is supreme in the following way: there is some amount of\nlove such that that particular amount of love is greater in intrinsic\nvalue than any amount of any other good. On McTaggart\u2019s\nview, the goodness of other goods asymptotically approach the goodness\nof that amount of love, whereas the goodness of love enjoys no upper\nbound. (See sections 850\u2013853 of the second volume of the\nNature of Existence.)\n\nThe optimistic conclusion of the Nature of Existence is that\ntimeless reality consists of persons who experience tremendous love for\neach other. The quantity of love is sufficient in value to dwarf any\nevils that remain. McTaggart argues that the value of this quantity of\nlove might well be\n infinite.\n\n",
