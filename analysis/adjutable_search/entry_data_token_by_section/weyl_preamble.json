    "main_text": "\n\n\nHermann Weyl was a great and versatile mathematician of the \n20th century. His work had a vast range, encompassing \nanalysis, algebra, number theory, topology, differential geometry, \nspacetime theory, quantum mechanics, and the foundations of \nmathematics. His scientific writing is informed by a rare literary \nand artistic sensibility\u2014in his words, \u201cExpression and \nshape mean almost more to me than knowledge itself\u201d. He was \nunusual among scientists and mathematicians of his time in being \nattracted to idealist philosophy: his idealist leanings can be seen \nparticularly in his work on the foundations of mathematics. In his \nyouth, Kant\u2019s doctrines made a great impression on him; later he was \nstirred both by Fichte\u2019s metaphysical idealism and by Husserlian \nphenomenology. Although Weyl came to question the certainties claimed\nby idealism, he cleaved always to the primacy of intuition he had \nfirst learned from Kant, and to its expression by Fichte as the \n\u201cinner light\u201d of individual consciousness.\n",
