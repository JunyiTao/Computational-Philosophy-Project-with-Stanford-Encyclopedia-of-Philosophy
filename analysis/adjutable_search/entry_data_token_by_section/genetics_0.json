    "main_text": "The Science of Genetics\n1. The Science of Genetics\n\nGenetics is devoted to the study and manipulation of heredity and\nvariation in living organisms. Genetics is so pervasive in\ntwenty-first century science\u2014in reproductive screening\ntechnologies like preimplantation genetic diagnosis, in assessments of\nwhat species are endangered, in public health programs that track\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria, to name a few\u2014that it is easy to\nforget what these disparate practices all have in common with one\nanother: a focus on the patterns and mechanisms of trait transmission\nfrom one generation to the next in order to understand and potentially\ncontrol that process. This contemporary focus can be traced back to\nthe first years of the twentieth century, when genetics took shape as\na unique field of study.\n",
