    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nThe works of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry fall into several distinct\ngenres: the novel, the novella, the dialogue, the oration, and the\nletter.\n\nThe novels follow the conventions of the serial epic novel established\nearlier in the seventeenth century. Each features an exotic locale.\nIbrahim or the Illustrious Basa (1641) sprawls over the\nancient Mediterranean basin. Artam\u00e8ne or the Grand\nCyrus (1649\u20131653) takes place in ancient Assyria.\nCl\u00e9lie, a Roman History (1654) is set in classical\nRome. Each is of extraordinary length to present its intricate twists\nin plot. Ibrahim has four volumes, Cyrus ten,\nCl\u00e9lie ten. The novels feature numerous abductions of\nthe heroine, a trait which was the cause of mockery by early and later\ncritics. Philosophically, the novels provide a critical portrait of\nthe abuses of power in the relationship between the sexes, especially\nin the practices of rape and forced marriage, and in the relationship\nbetween ruler and ruled, notably in the practice of enslavement.\n\nThe novellas represent a concession to the changed tastes of the\nFrench literary public. New miniature genres (the maxim, the tale, the\nfable) had replaced the outmoded genre of the prolix romance novel.\nC\u00e9linte (1661) and Mathilde d\u2019Aguilar\n(1667) explore the distinctive traits of female psychology, especially\nin the area of the passions and the propensity toward curiosity.\nPromenade at Versailles (1669) exemplifies\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s royalist political philosophy at its most\nmilitant; Louis XIV is praised as the model of virtues and Versailles\nis depicted as a terrestrial paradise.\n\nThe dialogues published toward the end of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s life\nrepresent the most philosophical of her works. Labeled as\n\u201cconversations,\u201d the dialogues reflect the debates and\nfavored topics of the salon Scud\u00e9ry hosted at the celebrated\nsamedis. A series of characters informally discuss a disputed\nissue of the moment; the conversation usually leads to a consensus on\nthe correctness of a particular position but occasionally the debate\nends in intellectual deadlock. Many dialogues focus on philosophical\nissues: the nature of the virtues, the nature of the passions, the\nproblem of free will, arguments for God\u2019s existence. Numerous\nconversations treat literary issues: the comparative merit of French\npoets, the proper method of letter-writing, the nature of artistic\nmimesis. Several dialogues deal with scientific questions. On\nButterflies and History of Two Chameleons defend a\nvitalist theory of animal life and contest the mechanistic theory of\nthe animal-machine.\n\nOne of the more unusual genres invented by Scud\u00e9ry is the\nrhetorical oration used in Illustrious Women or Heroic\nHarangues (1642). In this series of discourses by famous women,\nScud\u00e9ry creates fictitious diatribes pronounced by powerful\nwomen in a moment of crisis, often on the verge of death. Prominent\ncharacters include Cleopatra and Sappho. Many of the harangues\ncriticize the reduction of women to silence by political oppression\nand the need for women to express themselves forcefully through spoken\nand written speech. Placed in the mouths of socially prominent women,\nthe orations also defend the right of women to exercise political\nauthority.\n\nThe letters of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry involve two distinct\ntypes. The first are fictitious: Amorous Letters from Various\nContemporary Authors (1641). Imitating Ovid, this collection\nprovides model-letters for the expression of love by interested\nparties, including women expressing affection for each other. The\nactual correspondence of Scud\u00e9ry is currently dispersed among\nvarious anthologies and archives. A prolix epistler, Scud\u00e9ry\ncorresponded with the intellectual elite of French society. Bossuet\nand F\u00e9nelon figure among her\n correspondents.[19]\n Of special philosophical interest is Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\ncorrespondence with Catherine Descartes, the niece of Ren\u00e9\nDescartes. Both correspondents reject the uncle\u2019s mechanistic\nexplanation of animal life. \n",
