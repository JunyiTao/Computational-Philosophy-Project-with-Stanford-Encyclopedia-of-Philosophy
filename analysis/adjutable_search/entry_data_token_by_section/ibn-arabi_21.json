    "main_text": "Human Perfection || Perfect Man\n6.3 Divine Presences\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s followers often summarized the notion\nof Perfect Man by having recourse to a scheme that came to be known as\n\u201cthe Five Divine Presences\u201d (al-hadar\u00e2t\nal-il\u00e2hiyyat al-khams). Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee uses\npresence (hadra) to designate any realm in which Being (i.e.,\nfinding and being found) becomes manifest under the auspices of a\ngeneral quality; in this sense it is roughly synonymous with world\n(\u2018\u00e2lam) or level (martaba). In one\npassage, for example, he explains that the cosmos is made up of two\nworlds or two presences, that of the Unseen and that of the Visible,\n\u201cthough a third presence is born between the two from their\nhaving come together\u201d, and that is the world of imagination (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n3:42.5). Most commonly, as in his chapter on the divine names in\nOpenings, he uses presence to designate a name\u2019s realm\nof influence and then describes various ways in which the properties\nand traces of the name are displayed in the cosmos and human beings;\none might say that he is describing how things participate in Platonic\nideas. The most inclusive of these presences is the\n\u201cdivine\u201d (al-hadrat al-il\u00e2hiyya), that is,\nthe realm that comes under the sway of the all-comprehensive name.\nConcerning it Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee writes, \u201cThere is nothing\nin Being/existence [wuj\u00fbd] but the Divine Presence,\nwhich is His Essence, His attributes, and His acts\u201d (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n2:114.14).\n\nQ\u00fbnaw\u00ee seems to have been the first to speak of \u201cthe\nFive Divine Presences\u201d, and the expression soon became\ncommonplace, though several different schemes were proposed. He uses\nthe expression to explain how the Reality of Realities, or the First\nEntification, embraces all entifications and thereby becomes manifest\nin five basic realms. The first presence is the Reality of Realities\nin divinis, embracing the divine knowledge of the cosmos. The second,\nthird, and fourth presences are the same three worlds about which Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee spoke: the unseen (spiritual), the imaginal, and\nthe visible (corporeal). The fifth presence is Perfect Man in his\nall-comprehensive deployment, embracing the other four presences in a\nsynthetic whole: his fixed entity is identical with the Reality of\nRealities, his spirit with the unseen world, his soul with the\nimaginal world, and his body with the visible realm (Chittick 1984).\nIn this way of conceiving of man, the role that the Logos plays in\ngiving birth to the cosmos is clear. Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee puts it in a\nnutshell: Perfect Man is \u201cthe perfected human reality of the\nEssence, one of whose levels is the Godhead\n[al-ul\u00fbhiyya]; all existent things are the loci of\nmanifestation for his differentiated qualities and properties\u201d\n(Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee, al-Nafah\u00e2t, 66\u201367).\n",
