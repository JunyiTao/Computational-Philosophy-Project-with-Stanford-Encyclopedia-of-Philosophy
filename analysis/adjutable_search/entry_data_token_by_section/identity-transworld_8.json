    "main_text": "Individual essences and bare identities\n4. Individual essences and bare identities\n\nThe principal argument for this view\u2014that transworld identities\nrequire non-trivial individual essences\u2014is that such essences\nare needed in order to avoid what have been called \u2018bare\nidentities\u2019 across possible worlds. And some regard bare\nidentities as too high a price to pay for the characterization of\nde re modal statements in terms of transworld identity. If\nthey are right, and if (as many philosophers believe) there are no\nplausible candidates for non-trivial individual essences (at least for\nsuch things as people, cats, trees, and tables) there is, indeed, a\nserious problem about transworld identity. (The expression \u2018bare\nidentities\u2019 is taken from Forbes 1985. The notion, as used here,\nis approximately the same as the notion of \u2018primitive\nthisness\u2019 employed by Adams (1979), although Adams\u2019s\nnotion is that of an identity that does not supervene on qualitative\nfacts, rather than an identity that does not supervene on any other\nfacts at all.)\n\nSuppose that we combine transworld identity with the claim (without\nwhich the introduction of transworld identity seems pointless) that a\ntransworld identity can hold between A in\nw1 and B in w2 even\nthough the properties that B has in w2\nare somewhat different from the properties that A has in\nw1 (or, to put it more simply, suppose that we\ncombine the claim that there are transworld identities with the claim\nthat not all of a thing\u2019s properties are essential to it). Then,\nit can be argued, unless there are non-trivial individual essences, we\nare in danger of having to admit the existence of possible worlds that\ndiffer from one another only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain.\n",
