    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Sparing Civilians\n4.3 Sparing Civilians\n\nThe middle path in just war theory depends on showing that killing\ncivilians is worse than killing soldiers. This section discusses\narguments to explain why killing civilians is distinctly\nobjectionable. We discuss the significance of intentional\nkilling when considering proportionality, below.\n\nThese arguments are discussed at great length in Lazar (2015c), and\nare presented only briefly here. They rest on a key point: Moral\nDistinction says that killing civilians is worse than killing\nsoldiers. It does not say that killing civilians is worse\nthan killing soldiers, other things equal. Lazar\nholds that stronger principle but does not think that the intrinsic\ndifferences between killing civilians and killing soldiers\u2014the\nproperties that are necessarily instantiated in those two\nkinds of killings\u2014are weighty enough to provide Moral\nDistinction with the kind of normative force needed to protect\nnoncombatants in war. That protection depends on mobilising multiple\nfoundations for Moral Distinction, which include many properties that\nare contingently but consistently instantiated in acts that\nkill civilians and kill soldiers, which make killing civilians worse.\nWe cannot ground Moral Distinction in any one of these properties\nalone, since each is susceptible to counterexamples. But when they are\nall taken together, they justify a relatively sharp line between\nharming noncombatants and harming combatants. There are, of course,\nhard cases, but these must be decided by appealing to the salient\nunderlying properties rather than to the mere fact of membership in\none group or the other.\n\nFirst, at least deliberately killing civilians in war usually fails\neven the most relaxed interpretation of the necessity constraint. This\nis not always true\u2014killing is necessary if it is effective at\nachieving your objective, and no other effective options are\navailable. Killing civilians sometimes meets this description. It is\noften effective: the blockade of Germany helped end the first world\nwar, though it may have caused as many as half a million civilian\ndeaths; Russian targeting of civilians in Chechnya reduced Russian\ncombatant casualties (Lyall 2009); Taliban anti-civilian tactics have\nbeen effective in Afghanistan. And these attacks are often the last\nrecourse of groups at war (Valentino 2004); when all other options\nhave failed or become too costly, targeting civilians is relatively\neasy to do. Indeed, as recent terrorist attacks have shown (Mumbai and\nParis, for example), fewer than ten motivated gunmen with basic\nweaponry can bring the world\u2019s most vibrant cities screeching to\na halt. So, killing civilians can satisfy the necessity\nconstraint. Nonetheless, attacks on civilians are often wholly wanton,\nand there is a special contempt expressed in killing innocent people\neither wantonly or for its own sake. At least if you have\nsome strategic goal in sight, you might believe that\nsomething is at stake that outweighs the innocent lives taken. Those\nwho kill civilians pointlessly express their total disregard for their\nvictims in doing so.\n\nSecond, even when killing civilians is effective, it is usually so\nopportunistically (Quinn 1989; Frowe 2008; Quong 2009; Tadros\n2011). That is, the civilians\u2019 suffering is used as a means to\ncompel their compatriots and their leaders to end their war. Sieges\nand aerial bombardments of civilian population centres seek to break\nthe will of the population and of their government. Combatants, by\ncontrast, are almost always killed eliminatively\u2014their\ndeaths are not used to derive a benefit that could not be had without\nusing them in this way; instead they are killed to solve a problem\nthat they themselves pose. This too seems relevant to the relative\nwrongfulness of these kinds of attacks. Of course, at the strategic\nlevel every death is intended as a message to the enemy leadership,\nthat the costs of continuing to fight outweigh the benefits. But at\nthe tactical level, where the actual killing takes place, soldiers\ntypically kill soldiers eliminatively, while they kill civilians\nopportunistically. If this difference is morally important, as many\nthink, and if acts that kill civilians are opportunistic much more\noften than are acts that kill soldiers, then acts that kill civilians\nare, in general, worse than acts that kill soldiers. This lends\nfurther support to Moral Distinction.\n\nThird, as already noted above, the agent\u2019s beliefs can affect\nthe objective seriousness of her act of killing. Killing someone when\nyou have solid grounds to think that doing so is objectively\npermissible wrongs that person less seriously than when your epistemic\nbasis for harming them is weaker. More precisely, killing an innocent\nperson is more seriously wrongful the more reason the killer had to\nbelieve that she was not liable to be killed (Lazar 2015a).\n\nLast, in ordinary thinking about the morality of war, the two\nproperties most commonly cited to explain the distinctive wrongfulness\nof harming civilians, after their innocence, are their vulnerability\nand their defencelessness. Lazar (2015c) suspects that the duties to\nprotect the vulnerable and not to harm the defenceless are almost as\nbasic as the duty not to harm the innocent. (Note that these duties\napply only when their object is morally innocent.)  Obviously, on any\nplausible analysis, civilians are more vulnerable and defenceless than\nsoldiers, so if killing innocent people who are more vulnerable and\ndefenceless is worse than killing those who are less so, then killing\ncivilians is worse than killing soldiers.\n\nUndoubtedly soldiers are also often vulnerable too\u2014one thinks of\nthe \u201cHighway of Death\u201d, in Iraq 1991, when American forces\ndestroyed multiple armoured divisions of the Iraqi army, which were\ncompletely unprotected (many of the personnel in those divisions\nescaped into the desert). But this example just shows that killing\nsoldiers, when they are vulnerable and defenceless, is harder to\njustify than when they are not. Provided the empirical claim that\nsoldiers are less vulnerable and defenceless than civilians is true,\nthis simply supports the case for Moral Distinction.\n",
