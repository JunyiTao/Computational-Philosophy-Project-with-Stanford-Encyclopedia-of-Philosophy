    "main_text": "Later Conceptual Developments and Modern Chinese Epistemology || Pre-modern Methodologies\n5.2 Syntheses of Methods and Disciplines\n\nThe majority of 20th century Chinese epistemologists\nadvocated the conceptual divisions between the subjectivity and\nobjectivity of comprehension. While analytical and/or Marxist scholars\n(such as Jin Yuelin) gave absolute priority to the rational method,\nmost Modern Confucians (principally Xiong Shili and Mou Zongsan)\napplied the intuitive one. He Lin drew attention to the traditional\ncomplementary comprehension of reason and intuition (He 1982: 27). In\nthis context, the two methods are not only inseparably connected to\neach other, but are also connected to the method of reasoning itself,\nwhich is based upon distinctions. In his view, philosophers who apply\nthe method of intuition, simultaneously apply methods of formal logic\nand dual differentiations; others, who apply the rational method, also\nuse the intuitive method, as well as dual distinctions. All three\nmethods, the formal analysis and inferences, as well as methods of\ndual distinctions and intuition, are necessary compounds for any\nphilosophical activity (Zhang 2000: 75).\n\nThe epistemological discourses of the 20th century current\nof the so-called Modern or New Confucianism (Xin ruxue\n\u65b0\u5112\u5b78) were rooted in the specific features of\ntraditional Chinese epistemological thought and defined by a search\nfor fruitful amalgamation with contemporary Western theories of\nknowledge. In this field, they were most interested in the relation\nbetween reason and intuition, for the latter concept belongs to\nprinciple traditional epistemological notions, and the former to the\nconcepts that are crucial for the establishment of modernization\ntheories. The Western notion of intuition came to China in close\nconnection and with many connotations arising from Henri\nBergson\u2019s vitalism, was translated by the neologism\nzhijue \u76f4\u89ba. \n\nAn important notion in Modern Confucian epistemologies is the advanced\nconcept of the traditional moral self, which in the new global\nphilosophies was intended to assume the function of a\n\u201ctruly\u201d autonomous cognitive subject. While this subject\nacts and perceives the world as an individual, necessarily forming a\npart of the social community, it is also ennobled by an infinite\nheart-mind, which enables it to be aware of its unity with the\nuniverse. This new, moral and infinite, limitless subject represents\nan elaboration of the \u201ctraditional\u201d Confucian concept of\nthe moral self, and thus may also be the active personality that can\nsustain the idea of modernization. In the Confucian framework, this\nself is autonomous precisely due to its rational and structural (li\n\u7406) connection with all aspects of its natural and social\nenvironment. Further, because this connection is also dynamic and\norganic, it is capable of infinite forms of communication and\ncooperation. For a Chinese model of modernity, i.e. for a modernity\npermeated with humanism or mutuality (ren \u4ec1), these\nforms of communication and cooperation are much more important than\nformal laws of economy and official politics.\n\nModern Confucian epistemological notions, e.g. Mou Zongsan\u2019s\nintellectual intuition, Tang Junyi\u2019s (1909\u20131978) concept\nof sensual compatibility, Xiong Shili\u2019s and Liang\nShuming\u2019s (1893\u20131988) sinization of reason and intuition,\nall represent the various Modern Confucian responses to the global\nquestions of the contemporary epistemology. These questions are linked\nto the dilemmas of the modern subject, who is trapped within the\ncomplex technologies of the profit-seeking world and has thus\nforgotten the ethical dimensions that define their humanity.\n\nWithin the framework of his structurally ordered system of thought,\nZhang Dongsun decidedly rejected the Modern Confucian paradigm\nexpressed in the glorification of intuition as the most objective\nmystical method for innate knowledge. Zhang believed that reason was\nthe only reliable and unequivocal method of comprehension; because it\nled us to knowledge that was not only logically consistent but also\napplicable, there was no need to search for any other, more reliable\nmethod. However, the rational method was not one-dimensional and\nundiversified, for it not only functioned in accordance to the pure\nformal structure, but also with the aid of the so-called intuitive\ninsight (touzhi \u900f\u667a), which represented an\ninseparable and complementary part of intuitive methods. Thus, by\nproceeding from ratio centrism, Zhang Dongsun finally managed to\novercome the boundary between reason and intuition (Zhang 1924: 76).\nHowever, according to him, the thing we are directly confronted with,\nis neither reason nor intuition, but knowledge itself. Knowledge is a\nresult of reason, but it implies intuition on an unconscious level.\nIntuition is not mysterious. It merely represents a process of\napplying a philosophical \u201cmethod of\ncounter-investigation\u201d, by which we peel away from the image of\nknowledge the ultimate, most intimate thing. And this thing is the\npure, completely unregulated \u201cthat.\u201d (Zhang 1924:\n64\u201365)\n\nThe Taiwanese Modern Confucian philosopher Mou Zongsan tried to define\nthe position of reason within traditional Chinese thought by comparing\nWestern and Chinese culture, arguing that they were based on different\nrepresentational forms of human reason. He called the Chinese form\n\u201cfunctional or intensive\u201d (lixingzhi yunyong\nbiaoxian\n\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u904b\u7528\u8868\u73fe) and the\nWestern \u201cconstructive or extensive\u201d (lixingzhijiagou\nbiaoxian\n\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u67b6\u69cb\u8868\u73fe) (Mou 1995:\n544\u2013553). This distinction could be compared to the Kantian\ndifferentiation between practical and theoretical reason. The\n\u201creason\u201d which appears in the functional representation is\na practical one. It is not abstract, but concrete, connected to actual\nlife. This reason can thus be equated with morality within the\npersonality (Mou 1995: 544\u2013545). However, Mou endows functional\nreason with intellectual intuition (zhide zhijue\n\u667a\u7684\u76f4\u89ba) which is\u2014in contrast to\nKant\u2019s epistemology\u2014a potential implied not only in Divine\nconsciousness, but also in the human heart-mind.\n\nIn his treatise on Kant\u2019s philosophy, Jin Yuelin established a\nclear and insuperable demarcation between synthetic and analytical\npropositions: if a certain proposition is synthetic, it cannot be at\nthe same time necessary or a priori; and if it is necessary\nor a priori, it cannot be synthetic (Jin 1996: 46). This\ndifference is clearly of great importance for the elementary framework\nof Jin\u2019s theory of knowledge. Modern Confucian epistemology\ncriticized a similar division, since ethics and their pragmatic social\nimplications were still at the heart of their theoretical efforts.\nFeng Youlan also encountered many difficulties related to analytic and\nuniversal (synthetic) propositions: on one hand, he did not wish to\nabandon the universality of the metaphysical statements, because in\nthis way he could express the ideal of every single thing, but, on the\nother hand, he tried to respond to the attacks against synthetic\npropositions carried out by the Viennese circle (Jin 1996: 78).\n\nZhang Dongsun maintained that a pure form of either proposition did\nnot exist in reality. The absence of distinctions between analytic and\nsynthetic propositions implies the abolition of the demarcation\nbetween (posterior) experience and (a priori) knowledge and,\nconsequently, between metaphysics and the (natural) sciences. Most\nChinese scholars from the latter half of the 20th century\nargued that the reason for this demarcation was to be found in the\nfact that metaphysics only referred to the formal regulation of\nexperiences, while science also explained their contents (Feng 1986:\n166\u2013167). However, some recent Chinese epistemological theories\nlikewise reject the reasoning behind such demarcations and criticize\nthe existence or methods of the discourses based upon them. For them,\nboth science and metaphysics explain experience; in addition, both\nrepresent a formal kind of explanation. Hence, Zhang Dongsun\ntranscended the boundary between science and metaphysics, while Feng\nwas convinced that it was insuperable. In Zhang Dongsun\u2019s view,\nthe only difference between metaphysics and science lay in the fact\nthat science applied the postulate of relations, while metaphysics\napplied the postulates of being and existence (Zhang 2002: 77).\n\nThis all-embracing, specifically Chinese tendency towards transcending\nabstract demarcations ultimately also manifested itself on the level\nof heuristics, with respect to the question of the nature of creating\ntheories. In the context of the neo-holistic research, which was, in\nthe field of epistemology, founded by Zhang Dongsun, and further\nelaborated primarily by Zhang Yaonan, the demarcation between the\nconcepts of discovery (faxian \u767c\u73fe) and invention\n(faming \u767c\u660e) was also considered to be\nartificial. This assumption was developed as a negation of Jin\nYuelin\u2019s paradigm which stated that theories could not be\ncreated (or \u201cinvented\u201d), but only discovered. Zhang\nDongsun denied this affirmation, declaring that there was no\nqualitative difference between these two concepts (or methods), given\nthat science was not a reflection, but an explanation or\ninterpretation of the world. He argued that scientific discourses were\na method of selection, that is, they selected and isolated specific\nentities in (originally chaotic) reality or nature, defining them as\nfacts, even though they only represented a kind of abstract reality.\nBy \u201cdiscovering\u201d facts in this way, science simultaneously\ncreated them. Thus, the existence of facts co-existed with the results\nof science. Although facts as such were not separated from nature,\nthey could not be a part of \u201cpure\u201d nature either, for in\nZhang\u2019s view, pure forms that would be separated from our\nawareness, perception and apprehension, did not exist. However, since\nZhang Dongsun cannot be considered a solipsist, for whom mind or\nconsciousness is the sole \u201ccreator\u201d of reality, there had\nto be something apart from humans (or living beings), despite the\nnon-existence of substance. Of course, this \u201csomething\u201d\nwas an (at least potentially) all-connecting and all-embracing\nstructure, which was neither material nor ideal in its essence. In\nfact, this structure represented a concretization of manifold\nrelations. It was precisely here that contemporary Chinese theories of\nknowledge once again revealed their traditional connotation.\n",
