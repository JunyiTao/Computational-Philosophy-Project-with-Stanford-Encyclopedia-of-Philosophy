    "main_text": "Two Criteria of Theoreticity || Semantic Dependence upon a Scientific Theory\n1.2 Semantic Dependence upon a Scientific Theory\n\nThe above explanation of theoreticity may be felt unsatisfactory as it\ndetermines the property of being theoretical only via negation of the\nproperty of being observable (Putnam 1962). This explanation does not\nindicate any specific connection between the semantics of theoretical\nterms and corresponding scientific theories. There is, however, also a\ndirect characterization of theoreticity that complements the criterion\nof non-observability: an expression is theoretical if and only if its\nmeaning is determined through the axioms of a scientific theory. This\nexplanation rests on what has come to be referred to as the\ncontextual theory of meaning, which says that the meaning of\na scientific term depends, in some way or other, on how this term is\nincorporated into a scientific theory.\n\nWhy adopt the contextual theory of meaning for scientific terms?\nSuppose the notion of meaning is understood along the lines of the\nFregean notion of sense. The sense of a term be understood as that\nwhat determines its reference (cf. Church 1956: 6n). It is,\nfurthermore, a reasonable requirement that a semantic theory must\naccount for our understanding of the sense and, hence, our methods of\ndetermining the extension of scientific terms (cf. Dummett 1991: 340).\nFor a large number of scientific terms these methods rest upon axioms\nof one or more scientific theories. There is no way of determining the\nforce function in classical mechanics without using some axiom of this\ntheory. Familiar methods make use of Newton\u2019s second law of\nmotion, Hooke\u2019s law, the law of gravitation etc. Likewise,\nvirtually all methods of measuring temperature rest upon laws of\nthermodynamics. Take measurement by a gas thermometer which is based\non the ideal gas law. The laws of scientific theories are thus\nessential to our methods of determining the extension of scientific\nterms. The contextual theory of meaning, therefore, makes intelligible\nhow students in a scientific discipline and scientists grasp the\nmeaning, or sense, of scientific terms. On this account, understanding\nthe sense of a term means knowing how to determine its referent, or\nextension, at least in part.\n\nThe contextual theory of meaning can be traced back at least to the\nwork of Duhem. His demonstration that a scientific hypothesis in\nphysics cannot be tested in isolation from its theoretical context is\njoined with and motivated by semantic considerations, according to\nwhich it is physical theories that give meaning to the specific\nconcepts of physics (Duhem 1906: 183). Poincar\u00e9 (1902: 90)\nliterally claims that certain scientific propositions acquire meaning\nonly by virtue of the adoption of certain conventions. Perhaps the\nmost prominent and explicit formulation of the contextual theory of\nmeaning is to be found in Feyerabend\u2019s landmark\n\u201cExplanation, Reduction, and Empiricism\u201d (1962: 88):\n\n\nFor just as the meaning of a term is not an intrinsic property but is\ndependent upon the way in which the term has been incorporated into a\ntheory, in the very same manner the content of a whole theory (and\nthereby again the meaning of the descriptive terms which it contains)\ndepends upon the way in which it is incorporated into both the set of\nits empirical consequences and the set of all the alternatives which\nare being discussed at a given time: once the contextual theory of\nmeaning has been adopted, there is no reason to confine its\napplication to a single theory, especially as the boundaries of such a\nlanguage or of such a theory are almost never well defined.\n\n\nThe accounts of a contextual theory of meaning in the works of Duhem,\nPoincar\u00e9 and Feyerabend are informal insofar as they do not\ncrystallize into a corresponding formal semantics for scientific\nterms. Such a crystallization is brought about by some of the formal\naccounts of theoretical terms to be expounded in\n Section 4.\n\nThe view that meaning is bestowed upon a theoretical term through the\naxioms of a scientific theory implies that only axiomatized or\naxiomatizable scientific theories contain theoretical terms. In fact,\nall formal accounts of the semantics of theoretical terms are devised\nto apply to axiomatic scientific theories. This is due, in part, to\nthe fact that physics has dominated the philosophy of science for a\nlong time. One must wonder, therefore, whether there are any\ntheoretical terms in, for example, evolutionary biology which has as\nyet resisted complete axiomatization. Arguably, there are. Even though\nevolutionary biology has not yet been axiomatized, we can recognize\ngeneral propositions therein that are essential to determining certain\nconcepts of this theory. Consider the following two propositions. (i)\nTwo DNA sequences are homologous if and only if they have a common\nancestor sequence. (ii) There is an inverse correlation between the\nnumber of mutations necessary to transform one DNA-sequence \\(S_1\\)\ninto another \\(S_2\\) and the likelihood that \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are\nhomologous. Notably, these two propositions are used to determine,\namong other methods, relations of homology in evolutionary biology.\nThe majority of general propositions in scientific theories other than\nthose of physics, however, have instances that fail to be true. (Some\nphilosophers of science have argued that this so even for a large\nnumber of axioms in physics [Cartwright 1983]).\n",
