    "main_text": "\n\nThe name Carl Friedrich Stumpf (1848\u20131936) is historically\nassociated with one of the most important philosophical trends in the\nearly twentieth century, phenomenology. Stumpf supervised\nHusserl\u2019s habilitation thesis in Halle in 1887 and the\nlatter\u2019s seminal work on phenomenology, Logical\nInvestigations (1900\u20131901), is dedicated to him in\nrecognition of his friendship and his philosophical contribution to\nthis book. Stumpf is also known as the founder of the Berlin Institute\nof Psychology, which gave rise to Gestalt psychology, another\nimportant current during the early twentieth century and whose main\nadherents were among others, his students W. K\u00f6hler, K. Koffka,\nW. Wertheimer and K. Lewin. Founder of the Phonogram Archive in\nBerlin, now under the protection of the UNESCO, he is also considered\none of the forefathers of comparative musicology and a pioneer in\nethnomusicology. He held positions in the philosophy departments at\nthe universities of G\u00f6ttingen, W\u00fcrzburg, Prague, Munich and\nHalle, before obtaining a professorship at the University of Berlin,\nwhere he was also rector in 1907\u20131908. His two main sources of\ninspiration in philosophy are Franz Brentano, of whom he was the first\nstudent in W\u00fcrzburg, and Hermann Lotze, who supervised his\ndoctoral thesis on Plato (1868) and his habilitation thesis on\nmathematical axioms (1870). The philosophical work he left us is as\noriginal and as diversified as his academic and institutional\nachievements. Besides many treatises in the fields of acoustics and\nmusicology, his important contributions to the development of the\n\u201cnew psychology\u201d and to the philosophy of the mind in\ngeneral should also be noted. His friend William James said of him in\nhis Principles of Psychology (p. 911) that he was \u201cthe\nmost philosophical and profound of all writers; and I owe him\nmuch.\u201d His studies in the field of descriptive psychology and\nphenomenology (known as the science of phenomena) for example, are of\nparticular interest to current research in the fields of philosophy of\nmind and cognitive sciences.\n",
