    "main_text": "Introduction || Mass and Count Nouns; Mass and Count Expressions\n1.3 Mass and Count Nouns; Mass and Count Expressions\n\nThe most common entry-point for thinking that there may be a\nmetaphysical difference between stuff and things is by noting that\nwhile common things, such as dogs and rocks, can be unqualifiedly\ncounted, there are also stuffs, such as water and air, which cannot be\nunqualifiedly counted. But the entry point can be even more\nrudimentary, possibly pre-linguistic. As Burge (1975, 199) notes,\n\u201cfrom early childhood we learn to distinguish compact, enduring\nthings from the stuffs of which they are consituted. We count the\nformer and measure the latter. We treat things as stable points of\nreference \u2026 stuffs we think of as amorphous and protean.\u201d\nPhilosophers and linguists have often latched onto this distinction by\nnoting the difference between what are called \u2018mass\nterms/nouns\u2019 and \u2018count terms/nouns.\u2019 Burge goes on,\n\u201cMass terms are typically used to measure the masses\u2014count\nnouns, to number the multitudes\u201d (1975, 199).\n\nBut what distinguishes mass from count nouns? In order to answer this,\nit will be helpful if some preliminary conventions and issues are\nexplained or noted, even if only to sidestep them in order to make the\nfocus of this entry clear.\n\nWhile this entry is about mass and count expressions, the\nliterature has typically focused instead on what are called mass and\ncount nouns. Mass nouns include nitrogen,\nporridge, trash, china, traffic,\ndata, shade, music, pain, and\nfurniture. Count nouns include horse,\nfuton, army, codicil, proposition,\nand galaxy. It should be noted from the outset that the\nrelation between the mass/count distinction and the stuff/thing\ndistinction across all metaphysical categories is not straightforward,\nas there are so many different kinds of entities (e.g., events,\nconcreta, sets, processes, absences, conventional entities, etc.)\nreferred to by both mass and count expressions.\n\nThere is debate about whether nouns as such are count or\nmass, as opposed to\n expressions.[7]\nMass expression is a broader class than mass noun,\nsince the former includes instances of the latter, as well as phrases\nsuch as \u2018the water in the tub\u2019, \u2018the gold in\nFrance,\u2019 and \u2018the grape juice Roderick drank.\u2019 In\ncomparison, \u2018Robert\u2019s car\u2019, \u2018John\u2019s\nstudent,\u2019 and \u2018a NATO signatory\u2019 are count\nexpressions. But, while there is debate about whether nouns are count\nor mass, no one denies that expressions can be count or mass (a single\nword representing the limiting case). This is one reason our emphasis\nis on \u2018expressions.\u2019\n\nThere is a further preliminary issue, orthogonal to our discussion,\nabout whether expression-types or\nexpression-instances are what are primarily mass or count.\nMany hold that mass expressions are ambiguous between mass or count\nsenses depending upon context (e.g., \u2018Mary had a little\nlamb\u2019 could mean she owned one, or ate some (Quine 1960,\np.\u200991)). This question, and the former, can be side-stepped by\nstipulating, in what follows, that the phrases \u2018mass\nnouns,\u2019 \u2018mass terms,\u2019 and \u2018mass\nexpressions\u2019 will mean \u201cnoun/term/expression occurrences\nemployed with a mass\n sense.\u201d[8]\n\nFollowing common usage (cf Pelletier & Schubert 1989), we\nwill occasionally label linguistic items with mass features by\n\u2018+MASS\u2019, and those without by\n\u2018-MASS\u2019, and those with count features by\n\u2018+COUNT\u2019 and without by\n\u2018-COUNT.\u2019 As will become clear, an\nexpression\u2019s being mass or count are not always mutually\nexclusive, and neither is the distinction exhaustive. There are indeed\ncases of +MASS/+COUNT (e.g.\n\u2018hair\u2019, \u2018fish\u2019), or\n-MASS/-COUNT (e.g.\n\u2018fireworks\u2019)). This ends the preliminaries.\n\nThe following are commonly employed syntactic and lexical distinctions\nbetween mass and count nouns. Mass and count nouns act differently in\nrelation to quantifiers and non-logical determiners. Count nouns, but\nnot mass nouns (when not used in the kind sense), can be prefaced by\n\u2018each\u2019, \u2018every\u2019, \u2018few\u2019,\n\u2018fewer\u2019, \u2018many\u2019, and \u2018a\u2019. Mass\nnouns, but not count nouns, can be prefaced by \u2018much\u2019,\n\u2018little\u2019, \u2018a lot of\u2019, \u2018less\u2019,\n\u2018more\u2019, \u2018a quantity of\u2019, and so on. Both mass\nand count nouns take \u2018most\u2019, \u2018all\u2019,\n\u2018some\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018none of the\u2019,\n\u2018any\u2019, \u2018hardly any\u2019, and \u2018a\nlittle\u2019.\n\nOnly count nouns can be prefaced unqualifiedly by numerals or the\nindefinite article, and be pluralized without a category shift. When\nwe switch from speaking of \u2018a horse\u2019 to \u2018five\nhorses\u2019 we have not switched from speaking of things to speaking\nof kinds of things. However, when we switch from speaking of\n\u2018wine\u2019 to \u2018a wine\u2019 or \u2018seven\nwines\u2019, we usually switch from speaking about wine\n(+MASS/-COUNT) to either portions of it\n(-MASS/+COUNT), or to kinds of\nwine (-MASS/+COUNT) (Pelletier 1974).\n(Compare \u2018The wine is over there\u2019 to \u2018Gallo sells\nseven wines.\u2019) While we do say things like \u201cWe\u2019ll\nhave six beers,\u201d or \u201cI need five milks for the\nchildren,\u201d these are understood, depending on context, as\nshorthand for \u2018six bottles/kegs of beer,\u2019 or \u2018six\ncartons/pints of milk\u2019 (Higginbotham 1995, Pelletier 1979 pp.\n2\u20134, 2012). If you pour some wine on the floor you cannot, if\ngrammar is your guide, count the number of \u2018wines\u2019\n(+MASS/-COUNT) (in the non-kind sense)\non the floor. There are no things (or at least no commonsense things,\nby which we individuate and track persistence) which are wines, such\nthat there are a number of them on the floor. Even if there were, say,\nseven pools (or droplets, puddles, etc.) on the floor, we think the\nsame wine remains on the floor even if the pools cease to be, e.g. if\nthey are merged or further divided.\n\nWhile mass nouns do not admit the indefinite article, they admit a use\nof \u2018some\u2019 which acts like an indefinite article\n(Cartwright 1965). We can say, for example, \u201cAdam drank some\nwater which is worse than Onondaga Lake water,\u201d or,\n\u201cHeraclitus bathed in some water yesterday and bathed in it\nagain today.\u201d (Note the anaphoric use of \u2018it\u2019 in the\nlast sentence, and how it does not necessarily imply its referent is a\nparticular thing).\n\nBoth count and mass nouns admit the definite article. There are\nsentence forms with a mass noun prefaced by the definite article, such\nas \u201cSocrates drank the hemlock in that cup,\u201d \u201cBob\njust wrote your name in the snow over there.\u201d These sentences,\nif true, will be cases of definite reference of mass expressions, in\nthat they pick out an actual concrete referent. Both mass and count\nnouns admit definite reference. But, it is controversial whether\ndefinite reference to stuff is singular reference.\n\nFor our purposes, it is useful to lay down a limited taxonomy of mass\nnouns, not based on their linguistic, logical, or semantic features,\nbut based upon prima facie salient metaphysical\n criteria.[9]\n Compare the following lists:\n\nConcrete Quasi-Mass Nouns: furniture, silverware, china,\ntrash, clothes\nConcrete Mass Nouns: water, iron, lead, porridge,\nflesh\nAbstract Mass Nouns: information, data, wisdom\nPsychological Mass Nouns: pain, admiration\nQuantitative Mass Nouns: speed, weight, work, mass\n\n\n(a) are definitely mass by the grammatical criteria discussed above,\nand they refer to concrete entities. But, it is hard to see what\nimport they would have for supporting a metaphysics of\n stuff.[10]\n These words are devices for speaking about distinct, discrete objects\nin a collective manner. In certain contexts, we seek to draw attention\nto a bunch of distinct individuals, not as such, but, for pragmatic\nreasons, as an undifferentiated mass or plurality of a certain\nkind.\n\nFew have been led by the use of the words furniture or\nsilverware to conclude that there is a category of stuff or\nmatter which is distinct from things, nor have many others denied that\nthere is such a strong distinction based on the interchangeability of\nphrases like \u2018get your stuff off my desk!\u2019 with \u2018get\nyour things off my desk!\u2019 But, as we will discuss, the apparent\nmetaphysical triviality of category (a) could very well undermine the\ncontention that concrete mass nouns do in fact have metaphysical\nimport, since there is little or no grammatical difference between\nterms in category (a) or\n (b).[11]\n This is discussed more in\n Section 4\n and in\n Supplement: Non-Atomicity and its Relevance to the Mass/Count Distinction.\n\n\u2019Concrete Mass Nouns\u2019 refer to the kinds of entities\ndiscussed most often in the linguistically-informed metaphysics\nliterature. They have also been called \u2018physical stuff-kind\nterms\u2019 (Zimmerman 1995).\n\nAbstract mass nouns, if they do refer, do not, prima facie,\nrefer to physical stuffs or hunks of stuff. And the possibility of\npropositional or \u2018abstract stuff\u2019 strikes many, if it\nstrikes them at all, as dubious\u2014but it is not clear what is\nproblematic about it. (Some work on abstract mass nouns can be found\nin Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Husi\u0107 2020; Hinterwimmer 2020;\nMoltmann 2013, esp. 1.6; Nicolas 2002, 2003, and 2010; and Zamparelli\n2020. See Treanor 2013, esp. p10, for an applied discussion which\nrelates, and see Koslicki 1999, 68\u20139 for a rejection of the\nparallel between some abstract mass nouns and concrete mass nouns).\nMore on abstract mass nouns can be found in\n this section\n of the entry on the Logic of Mass Expressions.\n\nAddressing issues surrounding abstract, psychological, and\nquantitative mass nouns and their referents is beyond the scope of\nthis\n article.[12]\n Due to the almost exclusive emphasis on concrete and quasi-concrete\nmass nouns in the metaphysics literature, this article will follow\nsuit. While an analysis of concrete and quasi-concrete mass\nexpressions could possibly be carried over to generate a\ngeneral metaphysical theory of masses, the prospects for this are dim.\nThis is because, even given the grammatical similarities between all\nmass expressions, there are far too many differences between concrete\nstuff and the entities in categories\n (c)\u2013(e).[13]\n\nIn what follows, both concrete and quasi-concrete mass expressions\nwill be referred to as \u2018concrete mass expressions,\u2019 except\nwhen the distinction is needed. Also, due to our focus, \u2018mass\nexpressions\u2019 henceforth refers only to concrete mass\nexpressions, except where indicated.\n",
