    "main_text": "\n\nIn Indian literature, emotions are discussed in several different\ncontexts (Bilimoria and Wenta 2015b; Torella 2015): first, within\naesthetics (rasa). The word rasa can mean juice, sap,\nessence, condiment or even flavour and refers to the different\nsentiments invoked by a work of art, for example a piece of music.\nSecondly, emotions are discussed within the context of the\nbhakti (devotional) movement. Here particular emphasis is\nplaced on cultivating the emotion of love for a supreme being, e.g.,\n\u015aiva. Thirdly, they are discussed in various tantric traditions.\nThese traditions form a counterbalance to the ascetic ideal of\nclassical philosophical texts (fourth context in which emotions are\ndiscussed) in that they encourage \u201cliving out\u201d emotions\n(and desires) without forming any attachment to them. This entry\nfocuses on the emotions in this fourth context, namely classical\nIndian philosophical thinking, which includes Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical\nas well as Buddhist texts, among others. While there is no equivalent\nfor the term \u201cemotion\u201d in Sanskrit, the concept\nnevertheless plays an important role in Indian philosophy. Terms used\nin Sanskrit texts include vedan\u0101 (feeling) and\nbh\u0101va (feeling) as well as names of individual emotions,\nsuch as r\u0101ga (love, attraction), dve\u1e63a\n(hatred, aversion), har\u1e63a (joy), bhaya (fear)\nand \u015boka (sorrow). One of the reasons why emotions are\nphilosophically interesting in India and the West is their\nrelationship with the mental phenomenon of\nvij\u00f1\u0101na or j\u00f1\u0101na which is\ntranslated as \u201ccognition\u201d. The relationship between\nemotion and cognition is important for any account of reason and\nrationality. While the importance of the emotions for rational\ndeliberation and decision-making has been acknowledged in recent\ndiscussions in the philosophy of mind, the history of Western\nphilosophy contains many views, for example those of Plato, Aristotle,\nand the Stoics, which emphasize the dangerous and destructive role of\nthe emotions. At the heart of these views lies a division of our\nmental lives into cognitions and feelings. Cognitions are\nrepresentational thoughts. They are often regarded as rational because\nthey are capable of representing the external world and therefore they\nprovide us with access to the external world, based on the best\navailable evidence. So, according to this view of rationality, when I\nthink that there is a book on the table, based on my available\nevidence, and there really is one, then my thought is rational.\nHowever, if I am hallucinating that there is a book on the table, my\nthought that there is a book might also be rational because the\navailable evidence points towards this thought. In order to make sure\nthat our thoughts represent reality correctly, we require an account\nof what counts as good evidence, which is one of the main foci of\nepistemology in Indian and Western philosophy. Nevertheless,\ncognitions derive their status as thoughts capable of rationality from\nthe fact that they have objects which represent the external world. By\ncontrast, feelings are some of the non-representational attitudes one\ncan have towards the objects of the representations of our thoughts.\nFor example, when a person thinks about her daughters, she has a\ncognition which represents her daughters. The objects of her thought\nare her daughters and her thought picks them out among various objects\nand subjects in the world. There are several ways in which these\nobjects can be picked out: one can simply have the thought that one\nhas two daughters or one\u2019s thought can be \u201ccoloured\u201d\nwith love and affection. This \u201ccolouring\u201d of thought is\noften regarded as an affect. Together with the thought, it accounts\nfor an emotion. So, the emotion of love, for example, is the thought\nof the object of love plus an affect. The affect is\nnon-representational and regarded as a \u201cmere\u201d feeling.\n\nThe reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to\nrational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling.\nThe fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to\nsome views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According\nto these views, rational thought, which is representational and\ntherefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from\nthe feelings. The feelings themselves, however, are non-rational\nbecause they arise due to some physical imbalance in the body, for\nexample through an imbalance of the various \u201chumours\u201d.\nThis imbalance can negatively influence rational thought. An example\nis the person who acts against her better judgment because she is in\nthe grip of some feeling. This is of course also the basis for the\nterm \u201cpassion\u201d as something that we \u201csuffer\u201d,\nwhich was discussed by many philosophers in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, e.g., Descartes, Spinoza and Hume. Since rational\nthought is an ideal for many philosophers and the feelings can\ninterfere with this ideal, the natural consequence seems to be to\nadvocate for the extinction or at least the control of the feelings\nand, as a consequence, of the emotions. This is what many philosophers\nthroughout the history of philosophy have done, most notably of course\nthe Stoics. While they often recognize that the emotions contain a\ncognitive, and therefore potentially rational, element, they try to\nuncover this element by advocating its separation from the affect. Of\ncourse, if the affect were to be purged from the emotion, the\nresulting cognition would cease to be an emotion.\n\nThere is a parallel between this Western view and a prejudice that\nattaches to Indian philosophy. The prejudice is that Indian\nphilosophy, because of its soteriological nature with its emphasis on\nthe attainment of liberation, is about freeing the mind from feelings\nand emotions because they constitute an attachment to the world. While\nthis is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a\njustified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different\npositions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as\nis the case with regard to Western philosophy. This article introduces\nsome of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation\nto cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article\nroughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in\nclassical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have\npaid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would\nclassify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist\naccount of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the\nother accounts.\n",
