    "main_text": "\n\nTruth is one of the central subjects in philosophy. It is also one of\nthe largest. Truth has been a topic of discussion in its own right for\nthousands of years. Moreover, a huge variety of issues in philosophy\nrelate to truth, either by relying on theses about truth, or implying\ntheses about truth.\n\nIt would be impossible to survey all there is to say about truth in\nany coherent way. Instead, this essay will concentrate on the main\nthemes in the study of truth in the contemporary philosophical\nliterature. It will attempt to survey the key problems and theories of\ncurrent interest, and show how they relate to one-another. A number of\nother entries investigate many of these topics in greater depth.\nGenerally, discussion of the principal arguments is left to them. The\ngoal of this essay is only to provide an overview of the current\nTheories. Many of the papers mentioned in this essay can be found in\nthe anthologies edited by Blackburn and Simmons (1999) and Lynch\n(2001b). There are a number of book-length surveys of the topics\ndiscussed here, including Burgess and Burgess (2011), Kirkham (1992),\nand K\u00fcnne (2003). Also, a number of the topics discussed here,\nand many further ones, are surveyed at more length in papers in\nGlanzberg (2018).\n\nThe problem of truth is in a way easy to state: what truths are, and\nwhat (if anything) makes them true. But this simple statement masks a\ngreat deal of controversy. Whether there is a metaphysical problem of\ntruth at all, and if there is, what kind of theory might address it,\nare all standing issues in the theory of truth. We will see a number\nof distinct ways of answering these questions.\n",
