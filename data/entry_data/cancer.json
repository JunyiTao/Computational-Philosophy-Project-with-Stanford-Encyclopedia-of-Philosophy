    "preamble": "\n\nCancer is a major health problem worldwide; it is a leading cause of\ndeath, and with few exceptions, there have been steady increases in\nincidence and mortality (WHO, 2020). Perhaps not surprisingly, then,\ncancer is a central topic of biomedical research, drawing billions of\ndollars annually. In 2019, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI)\nallocated $5.74 billion in federal dollars, a $79 million increase\nover 2018 (NCI, 2019\u2014see the Other Internet Resources). A search\nfor the term \u201ccancer\u201d in PubMed returns over three million\nhits.\n\nDespite this, cancer\u2014and scientific research on cancer\u2014has\nreceived relatively little attention from philosophers of science.\nHowever, this is starting to change. Recent work by philosophers of\nscience has made substantial contributions to addressing conceptual\nand methodological issues that arise in cancer science and medicine\n(Pradeu, et. al., 2023). This entry will focus on four such\nissues.\n\nFirst, scientific classifications of cancer have as yet failed to\nyield a unified taxonomy. There is a diversity of classificatory\nschemes for cancer, and while some are hierarchical or nested, others\nappear to be \u201ccross-cutting.\u201d Initially, researchers\nturned to genomics in hopes that such issues might be resolved by\nmolecular \u201csubtyping\u201d. However, genomic sequencing and its\nsequelae\u2014transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics,\netc.\u2014have, if anything, complicated cancer classification. This\nliterature thus raises a variety of questions about both the nature of\nthe disease and disease classification: Are there some classifications\nthat are more useful, or better than others? What makes a\nclassification a good one? What does it mean to track more or less\n\u201cnatural\u201d distinctions in the context of disease? The\nproblem of cancer classification is complicated by the fact that\ncancer progression is a process with a complex natural history. Thus,\ncancer serves as a challenging case not only for disease\nclassification, but also for demarcating disease from health.\n\nSecond, many assume that the aim of science is to arrive at true\ntheories, from which one may generate predictions and explanations.\nHowever, scientists studying cancer seem to have a variety of\ndifferent practical and scientific aims, and the practical aims seem\nto receive far more attention than theoretical ones. Perhaps it is not\nsurprising, then, that historians and philosophers of science do not\nseem to agree on how best to characterize the aims, let alone agree on\nhow best to assess \u201cprogress\u201d in cancer research. With the\nrise of \u201cbig data\u201d science, both philosophers and\nhistorians of science are rethinking how best to describe and explain\nthese distinctive kinds of scientific inquiry.\n\nThird, cancer is in part a byproduct of our developmental and life\nhistory, as well as our evolutionary history. Cancer\u2019s emergence\nand progression has been compared to a reversion of development, and\nto the evolution of multicellularity. Thus, cancer raises intriguing\nquestions about how we conceive of \u201cfunctions,\u201d\n\u201cdevelopment,\u201d and the role of our evolutionary history\nand particularly, selective trade-offs, in vulnerability to\ndisease.\n\nLast but not least, cancer research provides a case study for\nconsideration of the roles of values in science, and at the\nscience-policy interface. Epidemiological and toxicological research\non cancer\u2019s causes informs law and regulatory policy. Cancer\nresearch also provides a test case for debates about the challenges\nfacing precision medicine; in particular, the complexity and\nheterogeneity of cancer makes translating \u201cbasic\u201d science\ninto the \u201creal world\u201d enormously difficult. This does not\nexhaust the variety of conceptual and methodological questions that\narise in cancer science. Philosophical work on cancer is increasingly\nbrought into conversation with debates of general philosophical\ninterest over causation, risk, chance, choice, and moral\nresponsibility.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Defining and Classifying Cancer\n\nWhat is cancer? Is cancer one disease, or many? If many, how many\ncancers are there? One might think that such questions are merely\nempirical. However, it turns out that defining and classifying cancer\nis contested not merely for empirical reasons. There are at least two\nbroader philosophical issues at stake. First, there is little\nagreement on how to characterize disease, distinguish disease from\nhealth, and thus classify diseases, generally (See the entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n Second, cancers exhibit features that make generating classifications\ndifficult; they are heterogeneous, and variable in their etiology and\ncourse of progression. In section 1.1, we will consider challenges\nfacing cancer classification given its intrinsic heterogeneity, and in\nsection 1.2, we will consider challenges facing cancer classification\ngiven its variable natural history. \n\nPrima facie, what distinguishes diseases are typical\nsymptoms, disease course, and a common cause. However, cancer can be\npresent without clinically detectable symptoms, has variable disease\ncourse, and is a multifactorial disease. It is difficult to pick out a\n\u201ccausal bottleneck\u201d uniquely necessary for cancer in\ngeneral, let alone each cancer type and subtype. While cancers are\ntypically classified by their cell-of-origin\u2014or the tissue, or\norgan, and cell-type where they originated (e.g., squamous cell\ncarcinoma of the skin or ovaries), it turns out that cancers can\ncontain mixes of different cells of origin, and cancers arising in the\nsame cells or tissues can have very different features, may evolve in\ndifferent ways, and have different vulnerability to treatment\n(Marusyk, et al. 2012). How, then, are we to classify such poorly\nbehaving kinds? These puzzles led researchers to wonder whether there\nare distinctive genetic or molecular \u201csignatures\u201d of each\ncancer that can help us estimate risk of progression, or chances of\nrecurrence, as well as predict responses to treatment. Perhaps these\nmolecular signatures are the key to a natural taxonomy of cancer types\nand subtypes?\n1.1 Cancer\u2019s Intrinsic Heterogeneity\n\nThe hope that molecular signature will address these classification\nproblems in part inspired international efforts at sequencing cancer\ngenomes \u2013 the Sanger Institute\u2019s Cancer Genome Project,\nand the U.S.\u2019s Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA). Such projects\nuse high-throughput genome sequencing to identify both inherited and\nsomatically acquired mutations to genes affected in cancer cells, as\nwell as mutational processes and patterns of clonal evolution. The\nTCGA aimed at generating a catalogue of mutations distinctive to of\neach cancer type and subtype, resulting in thirty-three\n\u201cmarker\u201d papers, and some novel subclassifications. For\nexample, in 2015, a working group affiliated with TCGA published a\n\u201cComprehensive Genomic Characterization of Head and Neck\nSquamous Cell Carcinomas,\u201d which identified specific mutations\nassociated with human-papillomavirus-associated versus smoking-related\nhead and neck cancers. While such projects did result in a more\ncomprehensive understanding of cancer biology, they also raised many\nquestions. Cancer genomes have many mutations, so a central puzzle has\nbeen determining which among the many changes to cancer genomes are\ncausally relevant to cancer progression, or which mutations are\n\u201cdrivers\u201d of cancer. Sorting the \u201csignal\u201d from\nthe noise has proven more difficult than anticipated.\n\nThere are very different rates, numbers and types of mutations across\nand within different cancer types and subtypes \u2013 what is called\n\u201cintertumor heterogeneity.\u201d Which mutations play a more\nsignificant causal role, viz. which outcome in different cancers, over\nthe course of cancer progression, is a difficult puzzle to solve. In\npart as a result of this, the concepts of \u201cdriver\nmutation\u201d and \u201cactionability\u201d have come to be\ndeployed quite differently in different contexts, leading to problems\nof slippage between criteria of application in research and clinical\ncontexts (Chin-Yee and Plutynski, forthcoming). Complicating this\nfurther, a cancer may contain several subpopulations of cells (or,\nmultiple evolving lineages), with different numbers and types of\nmutations within each lineage. Or, cancers have varying types and\ndegrees of \u201cintratumor heterogeneity.\u201d So, samples of a\ntumor taken when cancer is first diagnosed may be representative of\nonly one subpopulation of one stage of a dynamic process. Such samples\nmay not be representative of the genomic changes of greatest relevance\nto late-stage disease. \n\nAll this would be challenging enough as it is, but there is a yet\nfurther challenge facing hierarchical subclassifications of cancer\nbased on molecular information. Cancers arising in the same tissue or\norgan can be more genetically dissimilar than cancers arising in\ndifferent tissues or organs (Hoadley, et. al., 2014, 2018). Genomic\ninformation, far from providing a way to sort all cancers into a\nLinnean hierarchy, instead yields what philosophers have called\ncross-cutting classifications (Khalidi, 1998).\n\nMoreover, the effects of mutations are context-dependent, making their\ncausal relevance to any given cancer difficult to discern. Some\nmutations may provide low or no advantage to the mutated cells, until\nconditions change, such as the application of chemotherapies, which\ncan lead to proliferation of cells with specific mutations (Hsu et al.\n2018). Even the order of acquisition of mutations can change the\nbiology and outcome of the disease. For example, depending on which of\ntwo genes was first mutated, patients with myeloproliferative\nneoplasms (MPN) have different risks of different outcomes (Ortmann et\nal. NEJM 2015; Kent and Green 2017).\n\nSeveral \u201cextra-genomic\u201d factors also play an important\nrole in cancer causation and thus, arguably, ought to play at least a\npartial role in informing cancer taxonomy. For instance, it turns out\nchanges in microRNA in cancer cells\u2014non-coding RNA, which\naffects the expression of genes\u2014can affect cancer initiation,\nprogression, and responses to drugs (Hrovatin, et al. 2018). Life\nhistory (e.g. parity, or number of children, and age at first birth),\nenvironmental exposures, and histories of infection, and immune\nresponse, contribute differentially to cancer\u2019s age of onset,\nrate of progression, histopathology, and response to treatment. For\ninstance, infectious agents (e.g., HPV- or HCV-) are associated with\ncervical and liver cancers, and some proportion of esophageal cancers\n(Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Morgan, 2022). Indeed, for several\ndecades, the primary cause of cancer was thought to be viral, and\ninquiry into viral origins of cancer in part led to many insights into\ncancer causation, whether originating in viruses or not (see, e.g.,\nMorgan, 2022). Cancers of the prostate and breast are associated with\nhormones, which are in turn affected by parity.\n\u201cPregnancy-associated\u201d breast cancers are cancers that\narise during or shortly after pregnancy (see, e.g., Schedin 2006). The\n\u201csame\u201d cancer in the same tissue or organ can be\nclassified as either \u201csomatic,\u201d or\n\u201cfamilial\u201d\u2014due in part to whether the patient\npossesses inherited mutations that raise a risk of some cancers, such\nas those with Li Fraumeni syndrome. Smoking associated lung cancers\nand non-smoking associated lung cancers are distinct genetically,\nepigenetically, and phenotypically (e.g., in gross pathology, course\nof progression, as well as response to treatment).\n\nWhich of these several causal factors ought to figure centrally in\nclassification? Depending upon how fine-grained a characterization of\nthe causal basis of cancer one adopts, there could be hundreds or\nthousands of cancer types and subtypes. It\u2019s far from clear\nwhether there is one obvious choice of causal basis or distinctive\nproperties that best reflects anything like a \u201cnatural\u201d\ndivision of type and subtypes. Indeed, the case of cancer raises the\nlarger question of whether one can or should expect a univocal\nclassification of diseases, more generally. Are diseases, particularly\nmultifactorial ones such as cancer, \u201cnatural\u201d kinds? Or,\nare they simply ways of carving up the world that we happen to find\nuseful? \n\nSeveral philosophers have weighed in on these matters (see, e.g.,\nEreshefsky & Reydon 2015; Lange 2007; Broadbent 2009 and 2014;\nWilliams 2011; Khalidi 2013; Sorenson 2011, Bechtel, 2019). The\nquestions these authors are addressing are both epistemic\u2014what\nwarrants choice of criteria of classification of disease\u2014and\nmetaphysical\u2014given diseases like cancer lack essential\nproperties (or, properties belonging all and only to each type), is it\ncorrect to think of diseases as \u201cnatural kinds\u201d? Such\ndebates turn on more fundamental questions, such as whether there are\nany general criteria for \u201cnaturalness\u201d of scientific\ncategories, and if so, whether to take underlying causal or\nconstitutive bases, mechanisms, networks, or mere similarity or\n\u201cfeature matching\u201d as sufficient (Slater, 2014; Bechtel,\n2019; Boniolo, et. al., 2021; Boniolo et al., 2023). \n\nSome philosophers have expressed skepticism about whether cancer, or\nindeed, diseases, per se, are natural kinds. Lange (2007) for\ninstance, argues that, \u201ca disease is a natural kind of\nincapacity that features in interesting function-analytic explanations\nof other unhealthful incapacities\u201d(Lange, 2007, 266). Thus,\ncancer is not a \u201cnatural kind,\u201d in his view, because the\n\u201ctypical patterns of disruption of cell birth and death\u201d\ncharacteristic of cancer are multiply realized. Lange claims that\ninsofar as categories like \u201cbreast cancer\u201d or \u201clung\ncancer\u201d seem to be increasingly replaced in modern medicine by\nmolecular subtyping, and molecular subtypes are not \u201cnatural\nkinds of incapacity,\u201d they are not distinct diseases. Indeed,\nmany \u201cdisease kinds\u201d lack unifying\n\u201cfunction-analytic\u201d explanations. Thus, modern medicine\nhas, in a sense, led to the \u201cend of diseases\u201d as natural\nkinds. In a similar vein, but for very different reasons, Sorenson\n(2011) argues that diseases are \u201cpara-natural\u201d kinds.\nInsofar as diseases are \u201cdeficiencies,\u201d or\n\u201cdepartures from the norm,\u201d they lack the\n\u201cintegrity\u201d or \u201cinternal nature\u201d\ncharacteristic of natural kinds. Sorenson thus suggests that diseases\nare \u201creflections\u201d of natural kinds of process. They\n\u201cinherit the lawfulness and projectability of the natural kinds\nthat shape them.\u201d In other words, both Lange and Sorenson seem\nsimilarly skeptical that diseases like cancer have the integrity or\nexplanatory role of natural kinds.\n\nIn contrast, while Broadbent (2009, 2014), Williams (2011), and\nKhalidi (2013) agree that diseases like cancer lack essential\nproperties, disease classifications are natural classifications,\ninsofar as they pick out distinctive \u201cdeviations from normal\nfunctional ability,\u201d or homeostatic property clusters.\nBroadbent\u2019s (2009, 2014) \u201ccontrastive\u201d model of\ndisease classification takes diseases to be distinct in light of\ndistinctive causes. Where there is a difference in at least one of a\nset of causes shared by \u201ccontrols\u201d and \u201ccases\u201d\n(where cases have distinct \u201cparts and processes deviating\n(negatively) from normal functional ability\u201d), we have a\ndistinct disease. Broadbent takes this account to explain why, for\ninstance, \u201ccervical cancer is a disease, but HPV-itis is\nnot.\u201d Though, this case raises an interesting question as to\nwhether potential, rather than overt, dysfunction is more central to\ndisease classification. In public health contexts, it is often\nimportant to control \u201casymptomatic,\u201d or potentially\ndysfunctional states. Strains of HPV that do not currently cause\ncancer could well evolve the capacity to do so. So, perhaps from a\npublic health perspective, \u201cHPV-itis\u201d is a perfectly\nlegitimate disease category, in service of deploying interventions\nthat limit the spread of HPV more generally. That is, from a\npreventive medicine perspective, what matters is that a disease\ncategory is a good one for predicting and intervening, even where\nfunctional disruption does not always (or even most of the time)\neventuate. Which choice of classification we ought to make in\ndemarcating disease types might depend not only on which contrast we\nare interested in explaining retrospectively, but also which kind of\nintervention we wish to promote prospectively.\n\nKhalidi (2013) argues that cancer might be a homeostatic property\ncluster kind, on the grounds that cancer is driven by\n\u201chomeostatic\u201d mechanisms\u2014namely, mutations to\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d genes, or genes that play a\n\u201cgatekeeping\u201d role in preventing or permitting the\nemergence of a tumor. Acquisition of mutations to specific\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d genes, on this view, serve a function akin to\nBoyd\u2019s (1999) \u201chomeostatic mechanisms,\u201d in that they\npermit the further acquisition of \u201challmark\u201d properties of\ncancer cells. Khalidi is drawing upon a very common view of cancer,\narticulated by two famous cancer researchers, Hanahan and Weinberg\n(2000, 2011). They identify what they take to be the\n\u201challmarks\u201d of cancer: \u201ca small number of molecular,\nbiochemical, and cellular traits\u2014acquired\ncapabilities\u2014shared by most and perhaps all types of human\ncancer.\u201d They identified these \u201csix essential alterations\nin cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth\u201d\nas: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth\nsignals, evasion of apoptosis (cell death), sustained angiogenesis\n(the ability to develop a blood supply), tissue invasion and\nmetastasis (Hanahan & Weinberg 2000, 57). By way of example of a\ncaretaker, TP53 is called a tumor suppressor, because it\ncarries the function of responding to signals associated with cell\ndamage by typically inducing apoptosis, or cell death. It is one of\nthe only genes mutated in a majority of cancers sequenced (Bailey, et\nal. 2018). Thus, Weinberg (2013) characterizes it as \u201cmaster\nguardian and executioner,\u201d in that it prevents further mutations\nby inducing cell death where there are signs of trouble. On\nKhalidi\u2019s view, one ought to understand disruption of these very\ncapacities as \u201chomeostatic mechanisms\u201d for cancer.\n\nAt first blush, this seems a vivid case of a homeostatic property\ncluster kind; on Khalidi\u2019s view, it is these distinctive\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d mutations that permit or promote cancer.\nHowever, where we take a mechanism \u201cfor cancer\u201d to begin\nand end is in large part a pragmatic matter (Craver 2009); arguably,\none might carve up the \u201chomeostatic mechanisms for\u201d cancer\nto yield many or few cancer subtypes (Plutynski, 2018). Hanahan and\nWeinberg\u2019s initial picture has been complicated since 2001. In\n2011, Hanahan and Weinberg updated their hallmarks to include four\nmore: \u201cgenome instability, which generates the genetic diversity\nthat expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters\nmultiple hallmark functions\u2026 reprogramming of energy\nmetabolism, and evading immune destruction.\u201d And, \u201cIn\naddition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of\ncomplexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal\ncells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by\ncreating the tumor microenvironment\u201d (2011, 646). In other\nwords, hallmarks of cancer appear to no longer involve all and only\nintrinsic properties of cancer cells, but also dynamic interactions\nbetween cancer cells and the immune system and extra-tumor\nenvironment. This may not be such a serious challenge to\nKhalidi\u2019s view that caretaker mutation are mechanisms for\ncancer. One could, arguably, just expand the mechanisms for\nhomeostasis to the tumor microenvironment. However, such a strategy is\ncomplicated by the context-sensitivity of causes of cancer, discussed\nabove. Many cells on the surface of the skin as we age possess as many\nmutations to \u201ccaretaker\u201d genes as those in a breast tumor,\nbut most such skin cells are shed and never eventuate in disease\n(Martincorena, et al. 2015). The \u201csame\u201d mechanisms may\nwell lead to harm in one context, and be entirely harmless in\nanother.\n\nSeveral recent efforts at cancer classification use network,\n\u201cdeep learning\u201d methods or AI to mine data to identify\npatterns of association or clusters of common features within and\nacross different cancer types. These methods have been used to address\nthe so-called \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d problem: i.e.,\nsort through enormous amounts of genomic data, and speed development\nof tools for both diagnosis and treatment. Recent philosophical work\nexplores a variety of methodological and conceptual challenges facing\nuse these methods. While some are optimistic about the use of such\ntools in classification of cancers and other diseases, others are more\nskeptical (Boniolo & Nathan, 2016; Boniolo and Campagner, 2019a,\n2019b; Bechtel, 2019; Shrager, et. al., 2019; Hey, et. al., 2019;\nChin-Yee and Upshur, 2019; Green et al., 2022; Plutynski, 2018;\nPlutynski, 2022). Skepticism comes from several sources. First, some\nraise methodological concerns about representativeness of samples,\nsample quality and purity, batch effects, and the fact that methods of\nboth sequence analysis and data labeling and curation are constantly\nbeing updated, such that data gathered even five years past may need\nrevisiting. Others warn that different ways of labeling the same\ngenetic information can lead to contradictory results in clinical\ntrials of novel cancer drugs, or mistaken inferences about likely\nprogression or treatment benefit (Hey, 2015, 2019; Hey, et. al., 2016,\n2019). Some worry that genomic data is a static representation of gene\nexpression profile at a single point in time, but cancer is a dynamic\nprocess, shaped in part by the \u201ctumor microenvironment\u201d\n(TME) \u2013 the environment surrounding a tumor. If we are\ninterested in determining how cancers progress, or are likely to\nrespond to treatment, we arguably need to take multiple samples at\nseveral points in time, and even broaden consideration of relevant\ncausal factors outside the (local) tumor environment, to the\n\u201ctumor organismal environment\u201d (TOE) (Laplane, et. al.,\n2018, 2019b). How best to integrate as wide as possible an array of\ngenomic, extra-genomic, and clinical information is not obvious, as\nwell as how best to take into consideration the dynamic features of\ncancer progression.\n\nThe larger issues raised by this case is whether there is one way to\nprivilege choice of causal basis for classifying disease. Different\nchoice of temporal or spatial scale, or more or less fine-grained\ncharacterization of causal processes, might yield multiple,\noverlapping disease classifications. While some may be willing to bite\nthis bullet, and indeed, endorse pluralism and non-hierarchical\nclassifications (see, e.g., Khalidi 1998, 2013), others might be\nconcerned that this would yield too permissive an array of disease\ntypes, or inconsistent classifications, thus complicating scientific\ncommunication. More generally, this case raises some interesting\npuzzles about the aims and methods of classification in the biomedical\nsciences more generally. Given that genomic features of cancer are\nunlikely to unproblematically yield a single natural taxonomy, we\nmight become skeptical of reductive pictures of disease classification\nand explanation. It seems that classifications of disease like cancer\nform a kind of \u2018hybrid\u2019\u2014they are intended to capture\nnatural regularities and their causes, but also to be of use for a\nwide array of agents with different purposes. It\u2019s unclear\nwhether all these purposes can be served by one method or set of\nclassificatory criteria.\n1.2 Cancer\u2019s Variable Natural History\n\nA major complication surrounding classification in the case of cancer\nis that cancers have variable disease course (Foulds 1958; Cairns\n1975; Lynch 2007; Bertolaso & Dupr\u00e9 2018; Plutynski, 2018).\nNot all cancers progress uniformly to metastasis and death; some\ngrowths progress slowly or not at all. Some very common cancers (in\nthe prostate and thyroid) are either slow growing, or tend to remain\n\u201cindolent\u201d (Esserman, et al. 2014; Siegel, et al. 2017).\nThere is some disagreement in the medical community about how to\ncharacterize such cases; it\u2019s unclear whether they are best\nviewed as very slow growing precancerous lesions, or perhaps ought not\nbe characterized as cancer, at all (Schwartz, 2014). Such cases also\nraise a host of practical questions about the merits of screening, and\nthe risk of overdiagnosis\u2014the diagnosis of disease that might\nnever have progressed in the lifetime of the patient (see, e.g.,\nWalker & Rogers 2016; Hofman 2017; Esserman, et al. 2014; Welch\n& Black 2010). They also raise interesting philosophical questions\nabout the nature of disease.\n\nSome philosophers (Schwartz 2014), drawing upon the biostatistical\ntheory of disease as departure from age and sex-typical function\n(Boorse 1977), argue that we ought to classify such early-stage\ncancers as risk factors, rather than disease. Such growths are not\ndisease, on this view, because they are not atypical and do not yet\nimpair function\u2014in fact as many as one half of men over 60 have\nsome lesions of the prostate (Welch & Black 2010).\nReclassification of such cancers as mere risk factors, Schwartz\nargues, will prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Other\nphilosophers (e.g., Reid 2017) argue that this approach fails to\nacknowledge how the practice of diagnosis is itself a sort of\nrisk-benefit calculation, informed in part by our knowledge of the\nprevalence of early-stage or indolent disease, and in part by more or\nless precautionary values. It seems this debate is not only a\nscientific one, but also a normative one; much like debates about PTSD\nor obesity, there are normative dimensions to how we diagnose and\nclassify disease. Labeling can have both positive and negative\nconsequences for patients, clinicians, insurers, not to mention\ndevelopers and producers of screening, medical device, and\npharmaceuticals (Ereshefsky 2009). Overdiagnosis of early-stage\ndisease can lead to serious harms; treating a condition that may or\nmay not progress to invasive disease in the lifetime of a patient is\ncostly and harmful.\n\nOne hope driving the precision medicine research program is that the\nidentification of biomarkers of aggressive disease will resolve these\nambiguities with respect to early stage disease, as well as identify\ntargets of effective treatment (see, e.g., Collins, et al. 2005).\nHowever, as we have seen, interpreting genomic data has been far from\nstraightforward, and classifying cancer types and subtypes by appeal\nto genomic information alone can lead to a loss of important\ninformation. While genomic and molecular data is no doubt useful, it\nis not necessarily decisive. \n\nIn sum, much like genes and species, diseases like cancer lack\nessences, are heterogeneous, blur together at the edges, are caused in\nmany different ways, and have variable dynamics. Perhaps inconsistent\nclassifications are simply to be expected in such cases. That this is\nso does not (necessarily) show that we ought to give up on realism\nabout disease kinds; indeed, perhaps we ought to endorse\n\u201cpromiscuous realism\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 1995). As knowledge\nhas grown, and practical interests shift, classifications can multiply\nand even cross-classify the same kinds. This is nothing to fear, so\nlong as the kinds we countenance do the predictive or explanatory work\nintended for them, in the context intended. Others have a somewhat\nless permissive view, however, though there remains a good deal of\ndispute over how and which empirical constraints should govern\nclassification of \u201cscientific kinds,\u201d whether or not these\ncategories count as examples of \u201cnatural\u201d kinds (Slater\n2014; Ereshefsky & Reydon 2015). (See the entry on\n scientific pluralism.)\n\nGiven the complex causal pathways and heterogeneity of cancer, perhaps\nit is not surprising that, as Bertolaso (2016) argues, the history of\nattempts to define cancer have floundered. Either cancer is defined so\nvaguely as to include non-pathological states, or so narrowly as to\nrule out cases that might otherwise be included. Among the many\ndefinitions she canvases are: \u201cabnormal proliferation,\u201d\n\u201cunregulated growth,\u201d \u201ca disease of cell\ndifferentiation rather than multiplication,\u201d \u201cthe result\nof destruction of tissue architecture,\u201d \u201ca systems biology\ndisease,\u201d \u201cblocked ontogeny,\u201d a disease of\n\u201csuppressed (sic) immune function,\u201d a\n\u201cmetabolic\u201d and \u201cgenomic\u201d disease. Such a\nvariety of definitions is due to the fact that cancer has many causes,\nand involves many different types of dysregulation, at a variety of\ntemporal and spatial scales. Suffice it to say, it is no small\nchallenge to identify defining features of cancer, let alone arriving\nat a unified \u201ctheory\u201d of disease etiology.\n\nOne might well ask, however, whether the lack of a unified theory of\ncancer is a cause for concern. Is this a sign of immature science?\nKincaid has argued to the contrary (2008), \u201cbiomedical science\ncan make significant progress without precise definitions of disease,\nwithout full-fledged theories of disease and of normal biological\nfunctioning, and without disease entities being natural kinds\u201d\n(p. 368). Kincaid argues that \u201cThere is no clear definition of\nwhat constitutes a cancerous cell in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. However, no one thinks that cancer research should stop\nuntil we get this definition settled, or that creating linguistic\nuniformity is important for understanding the science. The science\ncertainly makes progress nonetheless\u2026 Likewise, there is no\nparsimonious theory of the disease and the normal functioning from\nwhich it is a deviation. Instead, we have piecemeal causal\nexplanations\u201d (p. 373). Kincaid is correct. Arguably, given the\ncontext-dependence or local constraints on cancer causation, (and\nperhaps also, diseases more generally) piecemeal reductive\nexplanations are often the best we can do (Schaffner, 2006).\n\nThe question of what function such a unified theory might serve is a\nmatter of some debate. A particular source of contention surrounds the\nmerits of the research program unified by a search for genetic\nmechanisms associated with cancer cell behavior (Strauss, et. al.,\n2021). This research program has received many different names: the\n\u201concogene paradigm,\u201d (Bishop 1995; Morange 1997)\n\u201cvision,\u201d (Morange 1997), \u201ctheory,\u201d or\n\u201cparadigm,\u201d (Sonnenschein & Soto 2008; Soto and\nSonnenschein, 2004, 2005), \u201cmodel\u201d (Temin 1974; Vogelstein\n& Kinzler 1993), \u201ctheory-method package\u201d (Fujimura\n1987, 1992), and \u201cframework\u201d (Blasimme, et al. 2013). Some\ncontend that focus on genetic mechanisms is a \u201cfailed\u201d\nparadigm, or a \u201cdegenerating\u201d (as opposed to\n\u201cprogressive\u201d) research program. Resolving such debates\nseems to require first that we have some measure of progress \u2013\nhardly a straightforward matter, given the variety of goals of a\nscientific research program, and their transformations, over time.\nWhile some see the central goal of research as the generation of true\ntheories, others focus on the generation of novel experimental\ntraditions, the generation of fruitful lines of inquiry, the\ngeneration of local (as opposed to general) explanations of particular\npatterns or processes, or useful ways of classifying data. A more\nmodest way of framing the question surrounding the\n\u201concogene\u201d paradigm\u2019s failure or success might be to\nfocus on how commitment to this \u201cexplanatory framework\u201d\nhas been useful in some ways, less so in others. \n\nFor instance, Blasimme, et al. (2013) characterize the search for\noncogenes as an \u201cexplanatory framework\u201d: \u201ccausal\npatterns, schemata (in the sense of Darden 2002), intuitions,\nhypotheses, evidential standards and various bits of evidence and data\ncoming from different experimental settings and instrumental\ndevices,\u201d which \u201cestablish selective and local criteria of\ncausal relevance that drive the search for, characterization and use\nof biological mechanisms.\u201d Rather than consisting of sets of\nlaws or general principles, such frameworks help generate strategies\nin the search for causes, and narrow the field of inquiry. Blassime,\net al. argue that \u201cexplanatory frameworks allow for changes of\nscientific perspective on the causal relevance of mechanisms without\nnecessarily fully replacing previous explanatory frameworks\u201d (p.\n375). Explanatory frameworks, in other words, can\n\u201ccoexist\u201d or be \u201cgradually displaced,\u201d rather\nthan stand in mutually exclusive relations with one another. As new\nquestions arose, and new information was discovered, this explanatory\nframework became elaborated. Depending upon how permissive or\nrestrictive our characterization of this framework, it need not be\nviewed as at odds with, for instance, attention to other causal\nfactors in cancer, as discussed below.\n2. Explaining Cancer: Theories, Models and Mechanisms\n\nWhat does it mean to explain cancer? The question is ambiguous, and\nfraught. For, by \u201ccancer\u201d one could have several targets\nof explanation in mind: the general process of transformation of a\ncell into a \u201ccancer cell,\u201d a very general characterization\nof the process of carcinogenesis as a whole, the process of invasion\nand metastasis in solid tumors in particular, the emergence and roles\nof intratumor heterogeneity, differential rates of incidence of\ndifferent cancer types, patterns of cancer incidence or mortality in\ndifferent environments, socioeconomic groups, races, ages, or sexes.\nEach of these explanatory targets arguably calls for quite different\nkinds of explanation, and not merely different explanatory\ninformation. The fact that these explanations are different in kind\nmay (in part) explain why there appears to be such a variety of views\namongst philosophers concerning the aim and character of explanation\nin cancer research, drawing upon a long history of debate among\nphilosophers of biology concerning norms of explanation (See the\nentries on\n scientific explanation\n and\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n Perhaps not surprisingly, also, there is also a history of dispute\namongst cancer scientists about competing research agendas and norms\nof explanation.\n2.1 The Mechanistic Picture of Cancer\n\nFor most of the last twenty or so years of the 20th Century\nand the first decades of the 21st, the central concern of\nthe majority of cancer researchers has been identification of\nmechanisms at the cell and molecular level that regulate cell birth\nand death. Two characteristic features of cancer cells are their\nuncontrolled growth, and failure to undergo cell death. This is often\nassociated with changes to the \u201ccellular machinery,\u201d or\nmutations and associated disruption of causal pathways that affect\nregulation of cell division or cell death (Hanahan & Weinberg\n2000). The \u201csomatic mutation theory\u201d (sometimes, SMT) or \u201cmultistage\u201d\ntheory of cancer, is roughly the view that changes in cells that lead\nto these disruptions in regulation are due to a series of mutations,\nchromosomal alterations, and epigenetic changes to cells acquired\nduring somatic cell division over the course of a lifetime. Onset of\ncancer, on this view, may be accelerated either by inheritance of\n\u201concogenes\u201d or \u201ctumor suppressors,\u201d or by\ndamage to DNA, for instance, due to smoking or UV radiation.\n\nThis picture of cancer was pieced together over decades from various\nsources of evidence\u2014from Virchow\u2019s observations of\nchromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells, to epidemiological patterns\nof incidence in cancer, to the discovery of the \u201csrc\u201d\ngene\u2014one of the first mutations found to be associated with\ncancer. This vision of cancer as the product of oncogenes replaced a\n\u201cregulatory\u201d view of cancer, according to which cancer was\na \u201cbreakdown in normal constraints on growth\u201d (for a\nhistory, see, e.g., Morange 1993, 1997, 2003). The \u201concogene\nparadigm\u201d arose at the same time that some of the first\nbioengineering technologies, which enabled early cancer researchers to\nuse the techniques of molecular biology to study genes associated with\ncancer progression (Fujimura 1987). While the SMT is often associated\nwith a reductionist research program (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology),\n in the sense that many cancer scientists within this program seek to\ndecompose the system of interest and understand the parts in operation\nin relative isolation, not all early advocates of the multistage\ntheory were cell and molecular biologists. Two of the first advocates\nof the theory\u2014Armitage and Doll\u2014were epidemiologists. They\nfound that curves of average lifetime incidence of lung cancer in\nsmokers appeared to have the same shape as that of nonsmokers, simply\nshifted to earlier ages. This suggested that cancer could arise from a\nrate-limited series of events acquired over the life course. Since it\nwas known that mutations could be acquired during somatic cell\ndivision (where \u201csomatic\u201d mutuations are acquired over the\ncourse of a lifetime, and \u201cheritable\u201d mutations refer to\nmutations in germ cells), and chromosomes of cancer cells were\ndisrupted, the obvious implication seemed to be that cancer cells were\nin part a product of somatic mutations. Since the 1980s, hundreds of\ngenes have been identified, mutations to which are associated with the\nhallmarks of cancer. Carcinogenesis, on this view, results from damage\nto DNA, or errors in the process of cell division, as well as either\nendogenous factors (various hormonal or other factors that promote\ncell growth), or exogenous factors (infection, and inflammation),\nwhich over time can lead to dysregulated cell growth.\n\nIn one paradigmatic example, Vogelstein and his group collected tissue\nsamples (premalignant polyps) from patients with a familial or\ninherited form of bowel cancer (FAP, or familial adenomatous\npolyposis). They discovered that mutations to genes associated with\nvarious cancers accumulated in series of steps, what has been called\nthe \u201cVogelstein cascade.\u201d The study of familial or\nstrongly inherited forms of cancer (cancers that appear at relatively\nyoung ages, and occur in families) has enabled the identification of\nseveral genes, mutations to which (whether inherited or acquired\nduring somatic cell division) play a role in cancer: APC, RB, and p53\n(associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, retinoblastoma, and\nLi Fraumeni syndrome, respectively).\n\nThis picture of explaining cancer might be expected to resonate quite\nwell with the picture of scientific explanation advocated by what has\nbeen called the \u201cnew mechanists.\u201d According to this view,\none of the central aims of biological scientists is the identification\nof mechanisms. The biological sciences do seem to be unique in their\nfocus on mechanisms, rather than laws or general principles, of the\nsort (typically imagined) to be central to the physical sciences (See\nthe entry on\n mechanisms in science).\n A mechanistic explanation identifies parts and processes that\ntypically yield specific outcomes of interest (Machamer, et al. 2000).\nIf we wish to understand regulation of apoptosis (cell death), for\ninstance, we might identify particular genes and proteins that play an\nimportant role in cell senescence, and determine how their activity\nand organization yield (or fail to yield) a given outcome. This\nmechanistic picture of the aims and character of explanation in the\nbiological sciences seems prima facie to characterize current cancer\nresearch quite well, or at least the past 25 years of this\nresearch.\n\nHowever, several philosophers have argued that this picture fails to\ncapture the diverse explanatory strategies carried out by cancer\nscientists (Green, et. al., 2018; see also next section). Indeed, even\nadvocates of the mechanistic perspective have argued that it needs to\nbe amended to accommodate the complex causal processes involved in\ncancer\u2019s etiology. For instance, according to Bechtel (2018), a\nlinear picture of mechanisms for cancer requires\n\u201cexpanding\u201d so as to accommodate the complex organization\nof mechanisms. He characterizes the mechanisms associated with\napoptosis, for instance, as made up of two types:\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d mechanisms. Failure to\nrespond to signals promoting apoptosis in cancer may be a result of\ndisruption in either one (or both) such mechanisms. Attention to the\ncomplex negative feedback processes of control and constraint\naffecting primary mechanisms is essential to explaining the emergence\nof cancer. As evidence of the significance of such control mechanisms,\nhe points out how cancer researchers identify regulatory networks or\nfeedback loops, associated with specific functions. Bechtel\u2019s\ndistinction between \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d\nmechanism raises some interesting conceptual and methodological\nquestions about the role of \u201corganization\u201d in functional\nexplanation, and how organization may be key to biological\n\u201cautonomy.\u201d Cancer may be a case study drawing attention\nto the relationships between structural organization and functional\nbehavior in biological systems, tracking insights going back to\nAristotle, and continuing in the work of Kant, Bernard and Piaget\n(see, e.g., Mossio & Bich, 2017; Mossio, et. al., 2009;\nMont\u00e9vil & Mossio 2015).\n\nThe kinds of pathways Bechtel identifies in cancer might either be\nrepresented as \u201cpurposive\u201d in some sense (in that\n\u201ccontroller\u201d versus \u201cprimary\u201d mechanism are\nre-oriented in cancer in service of promoting unlimited growth of\ncells), or as breakdowns in purposive organization (in that these same\nmechanisms typically promote survival of the organism as a whole).\nRelatedly, the same mechanisms might well serve as\n\u201ccontroller\u201d in one context, and \u201cprimary\u201d in\nanother. That is, this distinction itself may be relatively fluid, or\ncontext dependent. In recent work by Bich and Bechtel (2022), and\nothers (see, e.g., Bich, et. al., 2016), this manner in which\norganization and \u2018self-organization\u2019 of biological systems\nis a product or co-regulation of multiple mechanisms, with larger\nimplications for a variety of diferent biological systems, is\ndeveloped further.\n2.2 Complicating the Mechanistic Picture: Tissue Organization, Stem Cells and Systems Theory\n\nCritics of the somatic mutation theory and the search for mechanisms\nof cancer at the cell and molecular level have raised a variety of\nobjections, some methodological, some conceptual, and some empirical.\nIndeed, some critics combine all three. In the late 1990s, and early\n2000s, Soto and Sonnenschein proposed an alternative to the\n\u201csomatic mutation theory\u201d (SMT), the Tissue Organization\nField Theory (or, TOFT) (Sonnenschein & Soto 2000). They object\nnot only to reductionist methodology of advocates of SMT, but also to\nthe empirical claim that mutations are in fact causes of cancer. They\nargue instead that cancer is a product of \u201calterations in the\ncommunication among cells and tissues that affect tissue\narchitecture\u201d (2013, p. 90). On this view, mutations do not\n\u201clead the way\u201d in cancer, but instead follow upon\ndisruptions to tissue organization. It is these alterations of\npatterns of interaction between cells that leads to \u201cdownward\ncausation effects\u201d on cells and cellular components, inducing\naneuploidy and mutations (Soto & Sonnenschein 2006; Sonnenschein\n& Soto 2008). Let us address their arguments, turning first to\nmethodological concerns about warranted inference from cell culture or\nmodel organism work to general claims about cancer etiology.\n\nGiven that the development of cancer is an immensely complex causal\nprocess that cannot be observed directly, many scientific claims about\ncancer\u2019s causes are based on indirect inference, using model\norganisms or cells in culture. For instance, tumors are grown in nude\nmice using xenotransplantation, or tumors are observed to grow in mice\nin which \u201cdriver genes\u201d are \u201cknocked out.\u201d\nSoto and Sonnenschein have argued that these artificial experimental\ncircumstances render judgments about the causal efficacy of mutations\nin cancer suspect. They are raising methodological questions about the\nscope and limitations of model organism work. Soto and Sonnenschein\nfurther argue that there are other equally adequate explanations of\ncancer\u2019s emergence, and these explanations can accommodate\nphenomena that the SMT cannot. For instance, they claim that cancer\ncells\u2019 normalization when placed in healthy tissue cannot be\nexplained by the SMT. Tissue organization, on their view, exerts\n\u201cdownward causation\u201d on cancer cells, preventing or\npromoting their development into a tumor. Their claims about\n\u201cdownward causation\u201d have led philosophers to weigh in on\nthe debate (Malaterre 2011; Bertolaso 2016; Green 2021). Malaterre\n(2011) argues that advocates of TOFT need not commit to downward\ncausation (interpreted as an appeal to non-reductive physicalism, or\nemergent properties). Instead, he argues, dynamic relationships\nbetween variables that supervene over molecular and cellular\nactivities can do the same work, via a \u201chigher level,\u201d or\nless granular explanation of cancer etiology.\n\nDo such cases genuinely count as downward causation in, for instance,\nKim\u2019s (2000) sense? After all, strictly speaking, the idea that\ncausation is synchronic across the whole and part of the same entity\nseems contradictory. Soto and Sonnenschein propose that the kind of\ncausation they are invoking is not synchronic, but \u201cdiachronic\nemergence\u201d: \u201ccellular and tissue events occurring before\nthe expression of a particular set of genes takes place may act\ndownwardly modifying the expression of these genes at a later\ntime\u201d (Soto, et al. 2008, 271). This, however, seems to be not\nas radical a metaphysical thesis as talk of downward causation may\ninitially suggest. This seems instead a form of constraint. Green\n(2021) takes \u201cdownward causation\u201d in such contexts to\nrefer to : \u201cthe role of solid-state tissue properties in tumor\nprogression \u2026 understood as constraining relations between\ntissue-scale and micro-scale variables\u201d (p. 1). While this\nsuggestion is \u201ca \u2018weaker\u2019 form of downwards\ncausation than the one Kim (2000) and others oppose,\u201d and so\ndeparts from standard use of the expression, the advantage of this\nweaker notion that it better captures what scientists have in mind\nwhen arguing for the \u201cnecessity of higher-scale features for the\nrealization and understanding of biological phenomena.\u201d\nSimilarly, Bertolaso (2016) argues that cancer is an instance of\nsynchronic reflexive emergence\u2014\u201ca different mode of\ncausation. In such a mode, effects are not expressed in terms of a\nprogression of events, but of maintenance of states at different\nlevels of biological organization\u201d (Bertolaso 2016, p. 95).\n\nIt seems that each of these authors is pointing to an important role\nfor structural organization of tissues in the maintenance of\nhomeostasis or conversely in carcinogenesis. It seems such examples do\nnot point to \u201cdownward causation,\u201d in Kim\u2019s sense,\nbut instead suggest that we simply cannot predict or explain cancer\nsolely in terms of properties of \u201cmicro-\u201d level parts but\nneed to expand our understanding of the causes of cancer to include\nmaintenance of tissue integrity. That is, the case of cancer seems to\nrequire a richer, more integrative and interdisciplinary approach to\ninvestigating causation at multiple levels.\n\nIt seems that each of these authors is pointing to an important role\nfor structural organization in the maintenance of homeostasis as\nplaying an important role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, evidence provided\nby Bissell\u2019s lab (Weaver, et al. 1997, 2002) seems to indicate\nthat structural features of the extracellular matrix somehow either\nprevent the emergence of disease, or can accelerate it (on\nBissell\u2019s lab, see Plutynski 2018b). It seems such examples do\nnot point to \u201cdownward causation,\u201d but instead suggest\nthat we need to expand our understanding of the causes of cancer to\ninclude maintenance of tissue integrity. That is, the case of cancer\nseems to require a richer, more integrative and interdisciplinary\napproach to investigating cancer.\n\nSoto, Sonnenschein, and others have argued that the SMT and TOFT are\nmutually incompatible and cancer research needs a paradigm shift\n(Bizzarri and Cuccina, 2016). Others argue that they can be fruitfully\nintegrated (Bertolaso, 2011; Marcum 2005; Malaterre, 2007; Bedessem\nand Ruphy, 2015; Baxendale, 2019). Today, SMT and TOFT represent two\nextremes along a continuum of views about the central causal role of\ngenetic mutations in cancer. Most researchers grant that mutations are\none among many other causal factors in cancer.\n\nFor instance, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is now considered\nanother key factor (see Maman and Witz, 2018 for a historical review).\nHowever, there are some open questions about what falls within the\nTME\u2019s spatial and temporal boundaries, and what causal relevance\nspatial organization and temporal order have for cancer (Rondeau et\nal. 2019; Laplane et al., 2018, 2019b). Some interesting ambiguous\ncases are provided by nutrition (Sholl 2022) and by the microbiota\n(Sholl et al. 2022). Increasingly, there are indications that changes\nin the microbiome (both of cancer, and of the organism as a whole) may\nplay an important role in cancer initiation and progression,\nsuggesting that data about the microbiome may be relevant to\ndiagnosis, prognosis, and choice of therapies (Sholl et al. 2022).\nMoreover, given that microbes can be transmitted vertically (during\ncell division) as well as horizontally (between neighboring cells),\nand are themselves subject to evolution, Sepich-Poore et al. (2022)\nsuggest reconsidering clonal evolution in cancer as a multispecies\nprocess. Experimental study of the role of microbes in cancer is\ndifficult, however, raising several questions about pragmatic and\nepistemic trade-offs. The complexity and heterogeneity on both sides\nof the microbiome-cancer relationship makes generating robust causal\nhypotheses difficult (Parke and Plutynski, 2023).\n\nAnother major research program that in some ways challenges a\nmechanistic picture of cancer is the \u201ccancer stem cell\u201d\ntheory (CSC). Fagan (2016) characterizes the notion of a cancer stem\ncell, as well as the current state of the field, as follows:\n\nCancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be a small subpopulation of\nself-renewing stem cells within a tumor or blood-borne cancer, which\nare responsible for maintaining and growing the malignancy. This idea\nhas significant clinical implications. If the CSC model is correct,\nthe current clinical strategy of seeking to eradicate all\ncancer cells should be revised, to specifically target CSC.\n\n\nThe cancer stem cell theory in part is descended from the view that\ncancers are in several ways akin to ordinary tissue (though\ndistorted), containing a mixture of proliferating stem cells and their\nmore differentiated progeny. This view played an important role in\ncancer research in the 1960s and 1970s and is sometimes called the\n\u201cdevelopmental\u201d theory of cancer, in light of the fact\nthat it takes cancer to be a disease of \u201cdevelopment,\u201d or\ncellular differentiation in particular (Pierce & Speers 1988,\nMorange 2015, Laplane 2014). This model of cancer etiology was revived\nin the 90s, when Lapidot, Bonnet, and Dick identified \u201cleukemic\nstem cells\u201d (Lapidot, et al. 1994, Bonnet and Dick 1997), and\nwas expanded upon in the early 2000s with the identification of an\nanalogous cell population in breast cancer, suggesting that CSCs are a\ngeneral feature of all cancers (Al-Hajj, et al. 2003). The notion that\nthere are subpopulations of cells within a tumor that play a\ndistinctive role\u2014either in initiating a cancer, or in seeding\nnew cancers, has been influential in current research, suggesting new\navenues for both treatment and prevention.\n\nHistorically the cancer stem cell theory (CSC) was framed in\nopposition to the somatic mutation theory and the clonal evolution\nmodel, according to which cancer cells diversify and evolve through\nthe acquisition of mutations (e.g. Reya, et al. 2001; Wicha, et al.\n2006; Shipitsin, et al. 2007). But soon it appeared that rather than\nsee the two theories as mutually exclusive, we might see the two as\ncomplementary, in the process of integration, or overlapping models.\nFagan (2016) argues that on a \u201cmodel-based\u201d approach,\nit\u2019s not clear that these two theories are inconsistent. Laplane\n(2018) has pointed out how the CSC can serve to supplement the\nevolutionary perspective. The presence and number of cancer stem cells\ncan affect the rate and nature of evolutionary change in a population\nof cancer cells. Essentially, if all cells in a tumor are descended\nfrom one or a few cancer stem cells, this restricts population size,\nand thus suggests that to a large extent cancer progression is driven\nby drift, rather than selection. Lyne et al. (2021) develop this\nargument with a mathematical model, and question the ubiquitous\nassumption that linear evolution, in which each new clone arises from\nthe latest one and tend to almost outcompete it, is the output of\nnatural selection. Such inference can only be warranted if the number\nof contributing stem cells is high enough to prevent clonal evolution\nby drift.\n\nThere are several open questions about the causal role of stem cells\nin both preventing and promoting cancer. Cairns (1975) originally\nproposed the hypothesis that the hierarchical organization of tissues,\nwith the tissue stem cells producing all the other cells, may prevent\ncancer, by allowing only a few relatively protected cells to serve as\nprogenitors in somatic cell division, thus reducing the risk of\naccumulated mutations (Cairns 1975). More recently, a similar idea led\nto the claim that the risk of cancer is mostly a matter of bad luck,\nproportional to the number of stem cell divisions in each tissue\n(Tomasetti and Vogelstein 2015; Tomasetti et al. 2017). This has led\nto a vivid debate on the explanatory relevance of the variation in the\nnumber of stem cell divisions by tissues in the variation of the\nlifetime risk of cancer in these tissues. However, the lack of\nconceptual clarity and argumentative consistency of the initial papers\nand its critics has hindered the debate (Plutynski 2021b). \n\nDiscussion of the role and nature of cancer stem cells, however, is\ncomplicated by the fact that there is a great deal of dispute around\nwhat counts as a cancer stem cell (for questions about what counts as\na stem cell, outside of cancer, see Fagan\u2019s work, especially\nFagan 2013 and Fagan 2021). Laplane (2016), Fagan (2016), and Germain\n(2014) draw attention to the fact that the concept of cancer stem cell\nis multiply ambiguous, in at least the following ways:\n\nFirst, when we speak of cancer stem cells, we may be referring to\ntheir capacities, or to their historical role or genealogy, i.e., to\nthe fact that they were the cells from which other cancer cells\noriginate. That is, some take cancer stem cells to be defined in terms\nof their distinctive capacities and some in terms of their\nrelationship to other cells\u2014in particular, to their\nancestor-descendent relationships in a population of cells in a tumor.\nThe \u201ccancer stem cell model\u201d is sometimes simply taken to\nrefer to any model of a tumor that treats the population of cells as\nhaving a hierarchical relationship, where one or a few cells propagate\nthe tumor, whether or not those cells have distinctive properties that\ncause them to stand in that relationship.\nSecond, there are several different kinds of historical role that\nCSCs might play: They may be all and only those cells that initiate a\ncancer under natural conditions, they may be those cells which\npropagate a cancer in situ, or they may be those cells that are\ncapable of propagating a cancer in an experimental animal.\nXenotransplantation experiments used to assess CSCs are \u201chighly\nartificial\u201d contexts, that may or may not warrant the\nconclusions researchers claim to establish. Xenotransplantation, for\ninstance, has been used to articulate and test hypotheses about\n\u201cintrinsic tumorigenicity\u201d of CSCs. The problem with using\nthese tools, however, is that the matter of when and whether a cell is\n\u201ctumorigenic\u201d varies across different backgrounds. For\nexample, CSCs may develop tumors in some mouse models and not others,\ndepending on their immune deficiency. Which experimental context is\nrelevant to understanding how and why cancer is caused by CSCs thus\ndepends upon which causes we wish to isolate, and how.\nThird, some take the concept of CSC to be restricted to normal\nstem cells, which some believe are the most likely precursors to\ncancer. Others hold that cells that originate a tumor have stem-like\nproperties but may or may not derive from normal stem cells.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that some populations of cells in a tumor appear\nto have \u201cstemness\u201d properties\u2014the ability to renew\noneself. What is less clear is whether these capacities are context\nsensitive, and how and by which cells they may be acquired. The\nplasticity of many types of cancer cells suggests that they may\nacquire a stemness phenotype, and even shift back to non-stem\nphenotype. Given this, it appears that the CSC is just one of a\ncontinuum of general views, some of which take only specific types of\ncells to be precursors to cancer and others which grant that many\ndifferent types of cells have the potential to develop such\nproperties. That is, the real question at issue is whether the cells\nthat initiate a tumor are in some way distinctive or require\ndistinctive precursors, and how properties of stemness are acquired.\nWhether stemness is intrinsic or acquirable, niche-dependent or\nindependent, moreover, will drastically change the therapeutic\nstrategy. The CSC model (the idea that CSC are at the origin of cancer\ndevelopment, resistance to treatment, and relapse) might be true and\nyet CSC-targeting strategy might fail. Indeed, what kind of property\n\u201cstemness\u201d is may vary across cancers, and even over time\nwithin a cancer (Laplane and Solary 2019a; Laplane 2016).\n\nIn sum, there appear to remain several open questions about the nature\nof cancer stem cells, and more generally, how to best intervene upon\ncancer to successfully eradicate the disease. According to the model\nof the disease inherited from the latter third of the 20th Century,\nsomatic mutations, acquired over a lifetime, to the acquisition of\ncancer\u2019s \u201challmarks.\u201d So, the best strategy for\nintervention may be targeting specific pathways associated with these\nhallmarks. In contrast, according to the TOFT, changes in tissue\norganization yield carcinogenesis. Thus, the best strategy for\nintervention might be finding ways to intervene in the tissue\nmicroenvironment, so as to create an environment less hospitable to\nthe growth of cancer cells. According to the cancer stem cell theory,\ncancer arises in cells that have distinctive properties: continuous\nrenewal, and indefinite growth, permitting the emergence of new\ndisease. On this view, eradicating these stem cells seems essential to\ncancer treatment. Philosophical work on cancer causation and\nexplanation can better illuminate the competing presuppositions of\ndifferent approaches, clarify their commitments, and offer insights\ninto fruitful integration of new data. It is already clear that\nphilosophical discussions of ambiguities in how we define and measure\nstemness is essential to understanding how best to prevent recurrence\nand treat the disease (Clevers 2016).\n3. Cancer as a Byproduct: Evolution, Development, and Aging\n\nDobzhansky (1973) wrote that \u201cnothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in light of evolution.\u201d Can evolutionary thinking shed\nlight on cancer? After all, cancer is ordinarily understood to be a\ncase of failure of otherwise functional controls on cell birth and\ndeath. At first pass, this view seems fundamentally at odds with\ntaking an evolutionary perspective on cancer. For, how can something\nthat is an exemplary case of \u201cdysfunction\u201d count as an\nevolutionary process or product of adaptive evolution? Moreover, how\nought we to square this picture of cancer with the fact that cancer\ncells seem to co-opt developmental processes\u2014i.e., the process\nof \u201cde-differentiation\u201d typical of early embryonic cells?\nIs cancer a byproduct of development? Finally, cancer seems to\nincrease in incidence as we age. Is cancer simply a byproduct of\naging? Relatedly, if\u2014as some argue\u2014aging itself is\nselected for (a contested question!), is cancer in some sense\n\u201cadaptive\u201d? All these perspectives on cancer require us to\nperhaps rethink the nature of function and dysfunction, or at very\nleast, what such terms mean in the context of discussion of cancer.\nSome argue that there is a straightforward sense to be made of\nscientists\u2019 talk of cancer cells performing\n\u201cfunctions,\u201d insofar as they are involved in activities\nthat contribute to the self-maintenance and continued presence of the\nsystems of interest, namely cancer cells (Goldwasser, 2023,\nforthcoming). This sense of \u201cfunction\u201d is a\nnon-evolutionary, but part-function account. On the other hand, some\nargue that cancer is a product of evolutionary trade-offs in fitness\nat different temporal and spatial scales over the course of our life\nand evolutionary history. On this view, the best perspective to take\non cancer\u2019s \u201cfunctions\u201d may be a\n\u201cmultilevel\u201d evolutionary perspective\u2014i.e., thinking\nof evolution by natural selection as operating at different temporal\nand spatial scales, both sequentially, and in some cases,\nsimultaneously, sometimes yielding unfortunate \u201ccross-level\nbyproducts\u201d of selection at one temporal and spatial scale, for\nentities or processes at other temporal or spatial scales (cf. Okasha\n2006). Can such apparently contradictory accounts of cancer\u2019s\n\u201cfunctional\u201d status be reconciled?\n\nFirst, it is relatively uncontroversial that understanding a\nspecies\u2019 evolutionary history, and the selective trade-offs they\nface over the course of their life history, can inform our\nunderstanding of how and why they are more or less vulnerable to\ndisease. For instance, some species are more vulnerable to cancer than\nothers. Why? Comparative biology\u2014the comparison of different\nspecies\u2014may help us identify mechanisms associated with disease\nvulnerability, onset and progression, when they arose, where and why\nthey are shared, as well as how they have diverged (Aktipis, et al.\n2015; Aktipis, 2020). Comparing and contrasting how development,\nimmunity, and other mechanisms of suppression of cancer across species\ncan help cancer researchers identify targets of opportunity for either\ntreatment or prevention of cancer. In addition, we can look to unique\nfeatures of our own evolutionary history in order to explain patterns\nof disease incidence, suggesting selective \u201cmismatches\u201d\nwith our ancestral environment, a kind of \u201cbyproduct\u201d\nexplanations of our vulnerability to diseases. This enterprise is\nbroadly characterized as \u201cevolutionary medicine\u201d (Crespi\n& Summers 2005; Gluckman, et al. 2009; Stearns & Koella 2007;\nSun, et al. 2014).\n\nWhile the broad principles behind evolutionary medicine are relatively\nuncontroversial\u2014we all are evolved organisms after\nall\u2014philosophers of biology have been skeptical of particular\nclaims about how our evolutionary history has shaped our vulnerability\nto disease, either because evidence in support of evolutionary\n\u201cmismatch\u201d with our ancestral environment is both scant\nand disputed, or because many arguments in evolutionary medicine make\n\u201cadaptationist\u201d assumptions, i.e., assumptions that a\ngiven trait is adaptive, or selectively advantageous, founded on at\nbest \u201cjust so\u201d stories (Valles 2012; see also Murphy\n2006). Others offer more nuanced accounts of the variety of senses in\nwhich evolutionary \u2018mismatch\u2019 explanations go forward, and\nare supported by a variety of evidence (Bourrat and Griffiths\nforthcoming).\n\nOf course, there are better and worse such arguments; the best\narguments consider not only the widest array of evidence, but also\ntrade offs in fitness, as well as the role of constraints arising out\nof development and life history. Selective trade-offs are long known\nto play a causal role in disease. In the case of cancer, some have\nspeculated that traits adaptive early in life may yield fitness costs\nlater in life. A vivid example may be early rapid growth, which can\nboth increase reproductive fitness, but also apparently increase risk\nof prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women (Giles, et. al.,\n2003; Ahlgren, et. al., 2004; Summers, et al., 2008; Alvarado, 2013;\nBoddy, et. al., 2015). In contrast, \u201cmismatch\u201d hypotheses\nsuggest that traits that may have been adaptive in the past leave us\nvulnerable to disease in our current environment. For instance, many\nadvocates of evolutionary medicine have argued that the high\ncorrelation between nulliparity and cancer risk might be explained by\nour evolutionary history. The argument relies on the hypothesis that\nwomen in the evolutionary past were pregnant for much of their lives,\nstarting at an earlier age; breast development and differentiation was\nthus adapted to a lifetime of frequent pregnancy and nursing. Delaying\nor avoiding pregnancy thus changes the developmental processes typical\nfor our species, which could increase breast cancer risk. Of course,\nsuch hypotheses are contentious; there is always the potential for\nconfounding causes (in this case, of increased cancer risk due to a\nvariety of risk factors at work in modern society) (Greaves 2001).\nNonetheless, in a 1970 case-control study conducted at eight different\nlocations around the globe, a WHO group led by McMahon et al.,\nestimated that \u201cbreast cancer risk for women having their first\nbirth under the age of 20 years is about half that for nulliparous\nwomen,\u201d and that \u201cwomen having their first child when aged\nunder 18 years have only about one-third the breast cancer risk of\nthose whose first birth is delayed until the age of 35 years or\nmore.\u201d Evolutionary \u201cbyproduct\u201d explanations appeal\nto our evolutionary history to explain this observation. Both the\nabove arguments may be making speculative assumptions about the\nadaptive advantage of size or early age of sexual maturity in our\nevolutionary past. Sex differences in various aspects of cancer risk,\nmortality, and progression thus provide an interesting case study for\ndeveloping more sophisticated means of both defining and\noperationalizing sex differences in scientific research, and testing\nhypotheses about role of sex in disease (Mauvais-Jarvis, et. al.,\n2020, DiMarco, et. al., 2022)\n\nAnother type of \u201cbyproduct\u201d explanation of\ncancer\u2014though one that appeals to a much more distant event in\nour evolutionary history\u2014is that cancer is a product (or perhaps\nbyproduct, or re-enactment) of the emergence of multicellularity. At\none point in the very distant past, single celled organisms formed\ncollectives that cooperate; these collectives eventually became\nmulticellular organisms. Any collective of cells, especially\ncollectives whose survival and reproductive success depends on\nfunctional organization, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown in\ncooperative organization. On this view, then, cancer is a product of\nbreakdown in mechanisms that permitted the emergence of\nmulticellularity\u2014the mechanisms that protect us from\n\u201crevolt from within\u201d are not error-free, and over time\nwill fail. Such discussions raise interesting questions about the\nnature of individuality (For a vivid discussion, see, e.g., Okasha\n2006; Godfrey-Smith 2009; Bouchard & Huneman 2013; Clarke 2011,\n2013; Love & Brigandt 2017; Bueno, et al. 2019; Pradeu 2012, 2013,\n2016, 2019). Pradeu (2019, chapter 4) has distinguished two ways in\nwhich the immune system can contribute to cancer seen as a breakdown\nof individuality: either through a breakdown of its normal functioning\n(e.g. the immune system should eliminate cancer cells but fails to do\nso) or \u201cthe immune system acts normally and immune-mediated\ndecohesion is due to an abnormal context\u201d (e.g. the tumor\nproduces an abnormal context that stimulates an immune response such\nas healing when there is no wound to heal).\n\nAccording to some (Greaves & Maley 2012; Merlo, et al. 2006) the\nevolutionary picture of cancer dovetails nicely with the somatic\nmutation theory; somatic cells divide and acquire mutations during our\nlifetimes; some of these mutations involve failures in regulatory\npathways that ordinarily \u201cenforce\u201d functional\norganization, and thus cooperation. In this way, an evolutionary\nperspective\u2014understanding how evolution of multicellularity\nrequired the emergence of cooperative organization\u2014is essential\nto understanding cancer. Moreover, on this view, cancer itself may be\nviewed as an evolutionary process\u2014the emergence of adaptive\nfeatures of cancer cells, where these \u201cadaptations\u201d enable\nshort term \u201cfitness,\u201d or relative success at survival and\nreproduction. Several scientists have developed theoretical models of\nthis process, linking it to empirical data, e.g., on the emergence of\nchemotherapy resistance (Frank 2007; Wodarz & Komarova 2015). On\nthis view, cancer is both a process and byproduct of multi-level\nselection, where selection may be understood as operating at several\nlevels of biological organization simultaneously, or sequentially\n(Damuth & Heisler 1988; Lean & Plutynski 2016). That is,\ncancer cells may bear adaptations, and they are also evolutionary\nbyproducts of selective processes at other levels of organization. It\nappears that cancer cells co-opt or hijack otherwise adaptive features\nof organisms. Signaling pathways that are ordinarily in service of\nadaptive functions in early stages of development or wound healing are\nreactivated in (some) cancer cells, in service of the transition to\nmetastasis.\n\nThis is a classic example of a cross-level selective byproduct (Okasha\n2005, 2006). Traits advantageous at one level in the organization of\nmulticellular organisms may be coopted by component parts. Some of the\ncapacities that invasive cancer cells acquire (the capacity to invade\nand metastasize) are in fact due to a change in phenotype from\nepithelial to mesenchymal type cells, and losing adhesive properties\nenables such cells to invade the lymph and blood system. Lean and\nPlutynski (2016) have argued that cancer may in some ways parallel the\npatterns of emergence of multicellularity as characterized by Damuth\nand Heisler (1988), shifting over the course of emergence of disease\nfrom a simple selective process between individual cells to several\nkinds of multilevel selective process (MLS1 to MLS2). Critics contest\nthat the process of metastasis only weakly mimics MLS2, however\n(Germain & Laplane 2017).\n\nWhether or in what sense cancer cells are \u201cselfish\u201d or\n\u201ccheat\u201d is a topic of debate (Aktipis 2020; Okasha\nforthcoming; Pradeu et al. 2023). Critics argue that the analogy is\nmisleading, given that non-transmissible cancers are evolutionary\ndead-ends (Gardner, 2015; Shpak and Lu, 2016). Okasha (2021) argues\nthat cancer cells could be genuine case of cheaters if the atavistic\ntheory is true (which is by itself a matter of debate), i.e., if\ncancer cells revert to a unicellular mode of life that have been\nrepressed during the transition to multicellularity. To be sure, there\nare both analogies and disanalogies between evolution in whole\norganisms, and the evolving population of cancer cells in a tumor\n(Germain 2012).  However, thinking of cancer as a dynamic,\nevolutionary process, has great potential for applications in cancer\ntreatment, and perhaps also, in prevention. For instance, some have\nsuggested that we might give young girls drugs or nutritional\nsupplements that remodel the breast in ways akin to pregnancy, as a\nway to prevent the emergence of breast cancer (Katz, et\nal. 2015). Others suggest that modeling the evolution of multi-drug\nresistance may help prevent one of the major causes of cancer\nmortality. Drugs can be more or less effective in different patients\nand lose their effectiveness over time. An evolutionary perspective on\ncancer may shed light on how drug resistance comes about, in patients\nwith more or less intratumor heterogeneity (Greaves 2001, 2007; Frank\n& Nowak 2004; Merlo, et al. 2006; Greaves & Maley, 2012).\n\nA third type of byproduct explanation for cancer is the view that\ncancer is a disease of aging\u2014that is, cancer incidence by and\nlarge increases as we age, perhaps in part as a byproduct of\nbreakdowns in mechanisms associated with immune response and tissue\nintegrity. This claim raises some broader questions about how we\nassess function and dysfunction, or how we assess function at\ndifferent temporal and spatial scales of analysis, as well as how we\nunderstand the role of the immune system and the integrity of the\norganism as an individual. Indeed, all evolutionary and byproduct\nexplanations of cancer raise similar philosophical questions about\nhypothesis testing, as well as definitions of \u201cfunction\u201d\nand \u201cindividuality,\u201d both at the individual and group\nlevel, and over the course of one\u2019s life history. On the\nevolutionary view of cancer, for instance, cancer cells are in some\nsense highly adaptive (Hausman 2012; Germain 2012; Godfrey-Smith\n2009). One relatively controversial view of aging, first proposed by\nAugust Weisman, is that aging has the evolutionary\nadvantage\u2014effectively clearing the way for the young. If indeed\ncancer is a necessary byproduct of aging, and aging is selected for,\nthen on one view, cancer may be thought of as adaptive. Such a view\nraises a variety of questions about evidence and adaptationist\nexplanations.(see the entry on\n \u201cadaptationism\u201d).\n \n4. The Science-Value Interface and Aims of Cancer Research\n\nThere are several ways in which biomedical and public health research\non cancer intersects with debates about the proper role of values in\nscience. First, epidemiological and toxicological research is used in\nsupport of regulatory policy and toxic tort law. Decisions about when\nand what is \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d have significant public health\nimport, and thus raise a variety of philosophical questions about\nevidence, values, risk, precaution, and communication of scientific\nresults (Mayo & Hollander 1994; Cranor, 1993, 2006, 2011, 2017;\nValles, 2018; Elliott & Resnick, 2014; John, 2018).\n\nEvidence for claims about carcinogenicity is often indirect, and\nunderdetermination is rife. In establishing claims about\ncarcinogenicity, there are a variety of choices regarding methodology,\nsource and type of evidence, and standards of significance (Elliott,\n2011; Broadbent, 2013; Valles, 2018, 2021). Even optimally done\nepidemiological studies, or toxicological studies at best lend high\nprobability to claims about health risk, in part because such studies\noften \u201cblack box\u201d the intermediate causes. In such\ncontexts, there is \u201cinductive risk\u201d, or the risk of error\neither in over- or under-estimation of actual risk of cancer, and\nthus, room for values to play a role. Several philosophers of science\nhave weighed in on this matter of when and whether values ought to\nplay a role in such contexts, whether precautionary judgments are\nappropriate, as well as whether \u201copening\u201d the black box is\nalways ideal (see, e.g., Mayo 1988; Douglas 2000, 2009; Brown 2013;\nSteel 2007, 2010, 2015; Elliott 2011; Shrader-Frechette 1993, 1994,\n2002, 2004; Mitchell 2009; Russo & Williamson, 2007; Broadbent,\n2011; DiMarco, 2021). As one might imagine, there is also a\nsubstantive history of debate among epidemiologists, public health\nscientists, scholars of the law, around when we have good reason to\nclaim that X or Y is carcinogenic, or what counts as good evidence,\ngoing back to the dispute between Doll and Hill and their detractors\nregarding the causal link between smoking and lung cancer (Hill,\n1965). For a compelling history of this literature, see, e.g., Proctor\n(1996), or more recently, Oreskes and Conway (2011), or Shostack\n(2013). Problems of underdetermination are no less rife in the context\nof assessments of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of cancer screening and\nprevention (see, e.g., Solomon 2015; Stegenga 2018; Plutynski 2017)\n(For a discussion, see the entry on\n philosophy of medicine.)\n\nSecond, much of basic cancer research\u2014e.g., research on the cell\nand molecular bases of the disease\u2014is supported by federal\nfunds, which are allocated in the hopes that such research will\n(eventually) yield better health outcomes. Yet, the relationship\nbetween \u201cbench and bedside\u201d is indirect, and shaped by\neconomic, social, and political factors, some more pernicious than\nothers (Prasad, 2020; Tabery, 2023). So, it\u2019s unclear whether\nand how \u201cbasic\u201d cancer science ought to be evaluated in\nlight of whether or how it leads to better health outcomes. However,\nthis is hard to avoid, particularly when so many lives depend upon a\nresearch program\u2019s promised outcomes.\n\nThis whole matter is complicated by the fact that the study of cancer\nis itself big business. Cancer pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and\ncancer research are major drivers of the economy. The average annual\nprice for a new cancer medicine is rising rapidly and now approaches\n$150,000 (Booth, et. al., 2022); and some estimate cost of cancer care\nis globally to be in the region of $458 billion by 2030 (Callahan\n& Darzi, 2015). These high costs brings into focus several ethical\nconcerns regarding the economics of cancer prevention and care.\nCritics have raised questions about the quality of research and\nregulatory standards, economic incentives misaligned with promoting\noverall quality of life, misleading representation of public health\nand clinical information, and rising costs and downstream impact on\nunderserved populations, and equity in access to care (World Health\nOrganization, 2022). Several have expressed concerns regarding whether\nthe vast funds invested in cancer research\u2014at least during the\npast 25 years or so\u2014have shifted mortality rates sufficiently to\nwarrant the expense. According to one line of thinking, the centrality\nof cancer in biomedical research is a product of several historical,\neconomic, institutional, and social forces in combination, some of\nwhich are self-perpetuating, primarily driving by commercial interests\n(Proctor 1996; Fujimura 1996; Clarke & Fujimura 2014; World Health\nOrganization, 2022). Ever since Nixon\u2019s 1971 call for a\n\u201cwar\u201d on cancer, advertised implications for cancer\ntreatment or prevention have been used to bolster much of basic\nresearch into genetics, genomics, and cell and molecular biology,\nfostering investment in biotechnology. Some have argued that this has\nled to an unduly excessive, or disproportionate fear of cancer as a\ndisease, an excess of anxiety, and perhaps also unnecessary or\nunwarranted use of medical screening and testing (Aronowitz 2007,\n2009, 2015; Welch & Black, 2010).\n\nOn the other hand, cancer research has led to important innovations in\nscience and medicine with impacts much wider than cancer itself. In\nthe U.S., excessive regulations on research by, e.g., the FDA on the\ndesign and conduct of clinical trials for approval of drugs, some\nargue, may in part be slowing research. Some argue that we ought to\nlift restrictions on such tests for novel and more\n\u201cprecise\u201d (or targeted) drugs that might benefit very few.\nSuch matters are of course intertwined with larger debates around when\nand whether we have sufficient evidence to claim that, e.g., this or\nthat mode of intervention is effective (Ashcroft 2002; Cartwright\n2011; Howick 2011; Stegenga 2015; Teira 2011; Teira, et al. 2015;\nGonz\u00e1lez-Moreno, et al. 2015; Deaton & Cartwright\n2018).\n\nOne area where such questions are particularly fraught is\n\u201cprecision\u201d medicine. In service of this end, several\ntools and technologies have been developed. One is simply sequencing\nof individual cancers, with the idea that a more fine-grained analysis\nof the molecular and genomic features of each cancer promotes more\neffective prediction and control of cancer risk, enables detection of\ncancers at much earlier stages, and promotes less debilitating, more\ntargeted treatments. But it comes with the risk of overdiagnosis and\novertreatment (Vogt, et. al., 2019). With sensitive technologies and\nmore fine-tuned risk information, the practice of medicine has been\nshifting from diagnosis (and treatment) of disease, to constant\nsurveillance and intervention on disease risk, as well as higher rates\nof overdiagnosis and overtreatment (diagnosis and treatment for a\nproto-disease state that may never have progressed in the lifetime of\na patient) (Welch, et al. 2011; Esserman, et al. 2014). Other tools of\nprecision medicine include models such as organoids and\npatient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Organoids are 3D cultures developed\nfrom tumor samples of individual patients, in service of developing\npatient-specific drug screening (Huang et al. 2015; Ooft et al. 2019;\nSachs et al. 2018). PDXs are immunodeficient mice engrafted with human\ntumors that are used as surrogate models. Use of these technologies\nhas both immense potential benefit and carries some risks. On the one\nhand, attention to the particular genetic variation unique to a given\npatient variation will presumably allow for more targeted, effective\nprognoses and therapies (Boniolo, 2017). On the other hand, use of\nthese tools involves both setting aside the assumption that sample\nsize is an important component in clinical trials, and assuming or\nhoping that the organoid or mouse model is representational of the\ntarget (Lillie et al. 2011; Green et al. 2019, 2021, 2022). Some\nquestion whether the methods of testing new drugs in oncology suffer\nfrom systematic problems, leading to less successful outcomes than\nhoped or advertised. In particular, some have argued that surrogate\nendpoints used in many clinical trials fail to predict which drugs\nimprove overall survival, accelerated approval is granted for drugs\nthat do not meet the criterion of serving an \u201cunmet\u201d need,\napproval is granted for drugs that are tested against poor\ncomparators, in unrepresentative populations, or approved for minimal\nimprovements in surrogate outcomes, enthusiasts hype drugs before\ndemonstrated to be effective, and that there is a revolving door\nbetween the FDA and the very same pharmaceutical companies that seek\napproval for new drugs. Moreover, it seems pharmaceutical prices are\nnot determined by clinical benefit, nor are they justified by research\nand development costs (Prasad, 2020; Prasad & Gale 2016; Prasad,\net al. 2016; Beneduce & Bertolasao, 2022). Such skepticism should\nraise genuine concerns\u2014especially given the hopes of patients\nand families hanging upon the promises of such treatments, and the\noverall costs of both cancer care, and precision medicine research.\nHowever, there are several solutions that have been proposed (Prasad,\n2020), such as eliminating consulting payments from the pharmaceutical\nindustry to researchers, conducting trials to study outcomes that\nmatter to patients (such as overall mortality, as opposed to surrogate\noutcomes), comparing tested drugs to the current standard of care (as\nopposed to poor comparators), testing drugs in populations that are\naverage type of people with cancer (not exceptionally healthy), or by\nand large promoting more affordable drugs (globally).\n\nIn sum, current practices of cancer research, screening and treatment\nraise a number of both methodological and ethical questions: Is\ninvestment in precision medicine likely to yield the benefits\npromised? When is medical intervention on disease risk (rather than\ndisease itself) unduly excessive? What exactly does it mean to speak\nof effective medical intervention? Is overdiagnosis and overtreatment\na serious harm, or is it simply an inevitable byproduct of an\notherwise effective strategy\u2014treating disease risk? How ought\nclinicians to communicate about risk and benefit of novel targeted\ninterventions to patients, especially where there are gray areas of\nbenefit and harm? Are the (frequently) excessive costs of, and\ninequitable access to, cancer care, matters of justice?\n\nCancer research\u2014and especially the hope and hype surrounding\nprecision medicine\u2014provides a focused lens through which to\nconsider problems central to critical examination of the concepts and\nmethods of the biomedical sciences. That is, cancer and the scientific\nstudy of cancer illustrate challenges facing disease classification,\nfuzzy borders between disease versus health, the problems with genetic\nessentialism, the ever-present reference class problem and ever\npromised solutions, as well as specific ways in which\nunderdetermination of evidence in biomedicine shapes matters of\njustice in public health. Moreover, it provides a case study in how\nmatters of evidence, disease status, and questions of values and\njustice are deeply intertwined.\n",
