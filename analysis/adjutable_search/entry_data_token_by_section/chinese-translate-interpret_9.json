    "main_text": "Why Interrogate Chinese Philosophical Texts? || The Chinese Approach\n3.4 The Chinese Approach\n Chinese scholars working in the field of Chinese philosophy have\nmuch in common with their Western peers, but the differences are even\ngreater, at least at present. In the first place, with few exceptions\nthe Chinese would not see themselves as comparativists. They will read\nclosely comparative works on Aristotle and Confucius, but basically\nfor what they can learn about the latter, not the former. This is not\nchauvinism. To be concerned with how Confucius might illuminate the\nthought of Aristotle is to do philosophy, but not Chinese\nphilosophy, and that is what they are about\nConfucianism looms large in their work. Some scholars are working\nwith Daoist and other texts unearthed from Mawangdui and elsewhere\n(Cao Feng), and a few are essaying Chinese themes against a Western\nmodel (Yang Guorong). But Confucianism is still seen as the embodiment\nand expression of Chinese culture, and is enjoying a renaissance of\ninterest and scholarship\u2014and general popularity\u2014not seen\nsince the May 4th Movement of 1919. A few Chinese\nphilosophers are asking what contribution Confucianism might make to\nphilosophy in a global context, but most of them are concentrating on\nits relevance to China today\u2014and tomorrow.\nA second difference between Chinese philosophers and Western\ncomparativists is that the Chinese do their work in accordance with\ntheir own \u201cgrammar\u201d, their own questions, definitions of\nproblems, methodology, patterns of argument and standards of\njustification. They, too, have inherited a tradition over two\nmillennia old, with a monumental amount of material\u2014there are\nover 8000 commentaries on the Analects alone\u2014but the\nquestions and problems are seldom those of the West, except in those\nsections of university philosophy departments that specialize in\nWestern philosophy. and there are not inconsequential differences in\nmethodology, patterns of arguments and styles of justification as\nwell.\nAmong the questions contemporary Chinese scholars are asking is the\nextent to which Confucianism might legitimately be considered a\nreligion. Are there resources in the texts to suggest making it a\nstate religion? (Kang Xiaoguang). Shouldn\u2019t the focus be on\nspiritual practice, not theory? (Pang Fei). What kind of constitution\nbest reflects Confucianism in today\u2019s world? (Jiang Qing). Is\nConfucianism better studied today against the background of Western\nphilosophy? (Zhang Longxi). Or must it be studied in its own cultural\ncontext? (Zhang Xianglong).\nThis is important work, which clearly has much of political as well\nas philosophical import, although the politics do not seem to be\ninspired by nationalism of any sort (although recapturing cultural\npride is clearly in evidence). Some of it will appear conservative to\nWestern eyes, as when the editor of an anthology on The\nRenaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China says that\n\u201cOne finds in these essays \u2026 only sparse attention to the\nWestern notion of human rights\u201d (Fan 2011: 2). Others envisage a\n\u201cprogressive\u201d Confucianism (Angle 2012: 1), which,\nunsurprisingly, includes more Western elements. The bulk of\ncontemporary philosophical scholarship in China is not, however, of\nmuch direct interest to Western philosophers (or the general public),\nwhich is why there is such a disparity between translations of work\ndone by the comparativists into Chinese (a lot) and Chinese\nscholarship rendered into English (very little). The Chinese can and\ndo study the work of their Western counterparts fairly closely,\nlargely for the insights that work provides on their own\ntradition. Coming the other way we have few works in English: the\npolitical text of Jiang Qing (2012) and some works on aesthetics by Li\nZehou (2006, 2009). There is little else, and what there is tends to\nbe articles in specialized anthologies (Fan 2011) or journals of\ntranslation (Contemporary Chinese Thought, The Journal of\nChinese Humanities).\nIn sum, textual exegesis and translation in Chinese philosophy is a\ncultural practice, but it is usually practiced differently in different\ncultures.  The situation is changing slowly, but probably will not\nchange very much for some time.\n",
