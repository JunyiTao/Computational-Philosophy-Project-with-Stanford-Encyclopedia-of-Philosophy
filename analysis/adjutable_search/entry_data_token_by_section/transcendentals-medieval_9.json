    "main_text": "The Transcendental \u2018One\u2019\n7. The Transcendental \u2018One\u2019\n\n\nThe place of the concept of unity in the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals is determined by two defining moments in particular:\n(i.) the relation between transcendental and categorical unity, or\nmetaphysical and mathematical unity, i.e. the one as the principle of\nnumber; (ii.) the integration of the (Neo-)Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions of thought on unity.\n\n\nAlready in Aristotle, the assertion of the transgeneric character of\nthe one, that runs through the categories in the same way as the\nconcept of \u2018being\u2019, and hence is convertible with it, is\nlinked with the designation of \u2018indivisibility\u2019 as the\nproper meaning of unity, and is connected with the categorical one: it\nis \u201cthe first measure of a kind, and above all of quantity; for\nit is from this that it has been extended to the other\ncategories.\u201d (Aristotle, Metaph. X, c. 1, 1052 b 18\u201319.) In his\nmost influential, yet highly controversial elaboration on the concept\nof unity, Ibn Sina agrees with Aristotle that \u2018one\u2019 is\nco-extensional with \u2018being\u2019 and differs from it in its\nconcept; he adds, however, that just like being, unity is not part of\nthe substance of a thing, and hence accidental in the sense of\nextra-essential, a feature that he combines with its being accidental\nin the sense of being the principle of number in the category of\nquantity. Already Ibn Rushd criticized Ibn Sina for this confusion of\nthe metaphysical \u2018one\u2019 with the mathematical\n\u2018one\u2019. The different reactions in the Latin medieval\ndoctrines of the transcendentals reflect the differences in their\ninternal systematics. Aquinas accuses Ibn Sina of being deceived by the\nequivocity of the one, confusing the one that is convertible with being\nand the one that is the principle of number. The point for Aquinas is\nthat the one that is convertible with being adds only something\nconceptual to being, i.e. the negation of division; whereas the one\nthat is the principle of number adds something real, i.e. the relation\nto a measure, as a consequence of which the extension of the concept of\nbeing is narrowed down to the category of quantity. Duns Scotus,\nhowever, agrees with the position that he ascribes to Ibn Sina, namely\nthat being and the one are not essentially convertible, and therewith\nexpresses the major divergence of his doctrine of the transcendentals,\nin which the transcendentals do not add merely something conceptual to\n\u2018being\u2019, but something really distinct, in the sense in\nwhich a property is really distinct from the subject. The argument,\nhowever, that Duns Scotus provides for his position, namely the\nobservation that if \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 were\nessentially convertible, then multitude would be devoid of reality, is\nloyal to a major inspiration of Aquinas\u2019 reflection on\ntranscendental unity. Aquinas is also concerned to grant a positive\nmeaning to multitude and even accords a transcendental dimension to\nmultitude.\n\n\nAlthough the positive appreciation of multitude in medieval\ndoctrines of the transcendentals stands in clear contrast to the\nNeoplatonic reflection on the \u2018One\u2019, these doctrines tried\nto synthesize the Platonic and the Aristotelian traditions of\nspeculation on unity, the so-called henological and ontological\ntraditions, by integrating the transcendental and the transcendent\ndimensions of the \u2018one\u2019. This integration becomes evident\nin the doctrines of the transcendentals formulated by Aquinas and\nMeister Eckhart, and in Renaissance-Platonism, e.g. the treatise De\nente et uno by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. This same\nNeoplatonic tradition also inspired, however, a major critique of the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals, as formulated in the commentary of\nBerthold of Moosburg on the Elementatio theologica of\nProclus and in the works of Nicolas of Cusa.\n",
