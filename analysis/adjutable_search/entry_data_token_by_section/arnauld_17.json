In such\ncases, the soul \u201cdetermines itself\u201d to will or not will\nthe good in question. The human soul is said to have this power with\nrespect to any particular good it apprehends, as long as the\nparticular good does not encompass all the good toward which the will\ntends. Arnauld cites I\u2013IIae, 13, 6 as part of the Thomistic origin of\nhis theory:\n\nMan does not choose of necessity. And this is because that which is\npossible not to be, is not of necessity\u2026. For man can will and\nnot will, act and not act; again, he can will this or that, and do\nthis or that. The reason of this is seated in the very power of the\nreason. For the will can tend to whatever the reason can apprehend as\ngood. Now the reason can apprehend as good, not only this, viz.\n\u201cto will\u201d or \u201cto act,\u201d but also this, viz.\n\u201cnot to will\u201d or \u201cnot to act.\u201d Again, in all\nparticular goods, the reason can consider an aspect of some good, and\nthe lack of some good, which has the aspect of evil: and in this\nrespect, it can apprehend any single one of such goods as to be chosen\nor to be avoided. The perfect good alone, which is happiness, cannot\nbe apprehended by the reason as an evil, or as lacking in any way.\nConsequently man wills happiness of necessity, nor can he will not to\nbe happy, or to be unhappy\u2026 Therefore man chooses not of\nnecessity, but freely. (cited at OA, 10:630\u201331)\n\n\nArnauld follows Aquinas in saying that the will is not free with\nregard to two objects, first, happiness, apprehended as the ultimate\nobject of volition, and, second, God, seen face to face by the blessed\nin heaven. In these two cases, one wills (or loves) the object with\n\u201cnecessity of nature,\u201d and hence not freely. In all other\ncases, the will is free, and when one wills, one does so\n freely.[38]\n Arnauld provides a compact formula for this theory: \u201cThe best\nand shortest notion one can have of free will is to say with St.\nThomas that it is a potestas ou facultas ad opposita\u201d\n(Letter to Bossuet, juillet 1693, OA,\n 3:662).[39]\n",
