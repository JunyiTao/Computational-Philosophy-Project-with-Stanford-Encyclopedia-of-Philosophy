    "main_text": "Locke\u2019s natural law theory: the basis of moral obligation || Morality as Natural Law\n2.1 Morality as Natural Law\n\nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke writes that\n\u201call the requisites of a law are found in natural law\u201d\n(Locke 1663\u20134, 82). But, what, for Locke, is required for\nsomething to be a law? Locke takes stock of what constitutes law in\norder to establish the legalistic framework for morality: First, law\nmust be founded on the will of a superior. Second, it must perform the\nfunction of establishing rules of behavior. Third, it must be binding\non humans, since there is a duty of compliance owed to the superior\nauthority that institutes the laws (Locke 1663\u20134, 83). Natural\nlaw is rightly called law because it satisfies these\nconditions. For Locke, the concept of morality is best understood by\nreference to a law-like authority structure, for without this, he\nargues, moral rules would be indistinguishable from social\nconventions. In one his later essays, \u201cOf Ethic in\nGeneral\u201d, Locke writes\n\n[w]ithout showing a law that commands or forbids [people], moral\ngoodness will be but an empty sound, and those actions which the\nschools here call virtues or vices may by the same authority be called\nby contrary names in another country; and if there be nothing more\nthan their decisions and determinations in the case, they will be\nstill nevertheless indifferent as to any man\u2019s practice, which will by\nsuch kind of determinations be under no obligation to observe them.\n(Locke 1687\u201388, 302)\n\n\nFor Locke, then, moral law is, by definition, an obligatory set of\nrules, because it reflects the will of a superior\nauthority.\n\nMoral rules are obligatory because of the authority structure out of\nwhich they arise. But, this is not the only story Locke has to tell\nregarding the nature of our obligation to divine moral dictates. The\nset of moral rules that reason deduces are taken by Locke to be\nreflective of human nature. The rules that govern human conduct are\nspecifically tailored to human nature, and our duty to God involves\nrealizing our natures to the fullest degree. There is a noticeable\ndegree of teleology in Locke\u2019s theory, which is worth pausing to\nconsider in its content and its implications.\n",
