    "main_text": "The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories || Classical mechanics\n4.1 Classical mechanics\n\nDespite the common belief that classical mechanics (the theory that\ninspired Laplace in his articulation of determinism) is perfectly\ndeterministic, in fact the theory is rife with possibilities for\ndeterminism to break down. One class of problems arises due to the\nabsence of an upper bound on the velocities of moving objects. Below\nwe see the trajectory of an object that is accelerated unboundedly,\nits velocity becoming in effect infinite in a finite time. See\n Figure 2:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An object accelerates so as to\nreach spatial infinity in a finite time\n\n\nBy the time t = t*, the object has literally disappeared from\nthe world\u2014its world-line never reaches the t = t*\nsurface. (Never mind how the object gets accelerated in this way;\nthere are mechanisms that are perfectly consistent with classical\nmechanics that can do the job. In fact, Xia (1992) showed that such\nacceleration can be accomplished by gravitational forces from only 5\nfinite objects, without collisions. No mechanism is shown in these\ndiagrams.) This \u201cescape to infinity,\u201d while disturbing,\ndoes not yet look like a violation of determinism. But now recall that\nclassical mechanics is time-symmetric: any model has a time-inverse,\nwhich is also a consistent model of the theory. The time-inverse of\nour escaping body is playfully called a \u201cspace\ninvader.\u201d\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A \u2018space invader\u2019\ncomes in from spatial infinity\n\n\nClearly, a world with a space invader does fail to be deterministic.\nBefore t = t*, there was nothing in the state of things to\nenable the prediction of the appearance of the invader at t =\nt*\n +.[3]\n One might think that the infinity of space is to blame for this\nstrange behavior, but this is not obviously correct. In finite,\n\u201crolled-up\u201d or cylindrical versions of Newtonian\nspace-time space-invader trajectories can be constructed, though\nwhether a \u201creasonable\u201d mechanism to power them exists is\nnot\n clear.[4]\n\nA second class of determinism-breaking models can be constructed on\nthe basis of collision phenomena. The first problem is that of\nmultiple-particle collisions for which Newtonian particle mechanics\nsimply does not have a prescription for what happens. (Consider three\nidentical point-particles approaching each other at 120 degree angles\nand colliding simultaneously. That they bounce back along their\napproach trajectories is possible; but it is equally possible for them\nto bounce in other directions (again with 120 degree angles between\ntheir paths), so long as momentum conservation is respected.)\n\nMoreover, there is a burgeoning literature of physical or\nquasi-physical systems, usually set in the context of classical\nphysics, that carry out supertasks (see Earman and Norton (1998) and\nthe entry on\n supertasks\n for a review). Frequently, the puzzle presented is to decide, on the\nbasis of the well-defined behavior before time t =\na, what state the system will be in at t =\na itself. A failure of CM to dictate a well-defined result\ncan then be seen as a failure of determinism.\n\nIn supertasks, one frequently encounters infinite numbers of\nparticles, infinite (or unbounded) mass densities, and other dubious\ninfinitary phenomena. Coupled with some of the other breakdowns of\ndeterminism in CM, one begins to get a sense that most, if not all,\nbreakdowns of determinism rely on some combination of the following\nset of (physically) dubious mathematical notions: {infinite space;\nunbounded velocity; continuity; point-particles; singular fields}. The\ntrouble is, it is difficult to imagine any recognizable\nphysics (much less CM) that eschews everything in the set.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A ball may spontaneously start\nsliding down this dome, with no violation of Newton\u2019s laws.\n(Reproduced courtesy of John D. Norton and Philosopher\u2019s\nImprint)\n\n\nFinally, an elegant example of apparent violation of determinism in\nclassical physics has been created by John Norton (2003). As\nillustrated in\n Figure 4,\n imagine a ball sitting at the apex of a frictionless dome whose\nequation is specified as a function of radial distance from the apex\npoint. This rest-state is our initial condition for the system; what\nshould its future behavior be? Clearly one solution is for the ball to\nremain at rest at the apex indefinitely.\n\nBut curiously, this is not the only solution under standard Newtonian\nlaws. The ball may also start into motion sliding down the\ndome\u2014at any moment in time, and in any radial direction. This\nexample displays \u201cuncaused motion\u201d without, Norton argues,\nany violation of Newton\u2019s laws, including the First Law. And it\ndoes not, unlike some supertask examples, require an infinity of\nparticles. Still, many philosophers are uncomfortable with the moral\nNorton draws from his dome example, and point out reasons for\nquestioning the dome\u2019s status as a Newtonian system (see e.g.\nMalament (2007)).\n",
