    "main_text": "Counterfactual Accounts\n5. Counterfactual Accounts\n\nWe are concerned then with a contrast between two ways the behavior of\nagents is causally relevant to upshots. One suggestion is to say that\nwhen the agent is positively relevant to the upshot, the upshot would\nnot have occurred if the agent had never existed. Suppose, for\nexample, the victim dies because I push his head under water. He\nwouldn\u2019t have died if I had never existed. On the other hand,\nsuppose he is in deep water and cannot swim and I don\u2019t save\nhim. He would have drowned anyway if I had never existed. In these two\ncases, the counterfactual account draws the line in the intuitively\ncorrect way.\n\nHowever, suppose that the youngest son of a King squanders his\ninheritance and begs his elder brother, the new King, for food. The\nnew King refuses and the younger brother starves to death. If the\nelder brother had never existed, the younger brother would have\ninherited the throne and would not have starved to death. Yet, it is\nclear that the new King merely allows his brother to die and does not\nkill him (Kagan 1989, 96). \n\nThis may lead us to revise the counterfactual test and ask whether the\nupshot would have happened if the agent had not been present.\nHoward-Snyder (2002) argues that this narrower counterfactual also\nfails. She asks us to \u201csuppose an SS officer, Franz, tortures\nsomeone to death. But this is standard practice in the Gestapo. If\nFranz had stayed home with a sore throat, or if Franz had never\nexisted, his pal Hans would have done the torturing, in the same way,\nat the same time Franz did. If the counterfactual account is correct,\nthen Franz is negatively relevant to the victim\u2019s death by\ntorture. That is, Franz merely allowed the death to occur\u201d\n(Howard-Snyder 2002). Yet, it is very clear that Franz killed the\nvictim. Moreover, as Howard-Snyder points out \u201cthe fact that\nHans was waiting in the wings in no way diminishes Franz\u2019s\nwrongdoing in this case.\u201d (Howard-Snyder 2002).\n\nAlan Donagan (1977) suggests a similar account of the distinction. To\ndetermine whether the agent is positively or negatively relevant to an\nupshot, we should consider what would have happened if the agent had\nnot acted at the relevant moment, or what would have happened if the\nagent had \u2018abstained from intervening in the course of\nnature\u2019. It isn\u2019t entirely clear what we are supposed to\nimagine when we imagine this but perhaps it\u2019s that the agent is\nasleep or in a trance or in some other way unable to exercise her\nagency. Now\u2014with respect to some behavior that led to some\nupshot, we might ask: would that upshot have occurred if the agent had\nabstained from intervening in the course of nature? If it would have,\nthe agent allowed the upshot. If it would not have, then she did it\n(her relevance to the upshot is positive).\n\nBennett offers the following counterexample to Donagan\u2019s\naccount: Suppose that an alarm will go off if Henry pushes a button\nwhich requires a fairly specific movement. Henry is subject to a\nbarely controllable muscular spasm which, if allowed to run its\ncourse, would jerk his hand up, hitting the button and setting off the\nalarm. Bennett argues that on Donagan\u2019s account Henry counts as\npositively relevant to the alarms silence (as keeping it silent)\nwhereas intuitively he seems to have merely refrained from setting the\nalarm off (Bennett 1995, p.\n 113).[13]\n\n\nAfter discussing, and dismissing, a similar stream of counterfactual\naccounts, Kagan notes we may be tempted to refine the counterfactual\ntest still further. We may want to say that an agent does harm when\nthe harmful upshot would not have occurred if the given reaction had\nnot occurred. However, on this account the distinction between doing\nand allowing simply disappears. For in the classic cases of merely\nallowing harm, the harm would not have occurred if the agent had acted\ndifferently. Suppose I watch Maude drown. If I had reacted\ndifferently, if I had not refused to save her, then she would not have\ndrowned. Thus this revised test still fails to capture the intuitive\ndistinction (Kagan 1989, pp. 97\u201398).\n\nCounterfactual accounts may be used to support the claim that doing\nharm is worse than allowing harm on the grounds that, on such\naccounts, allowing harm is simply a matter of not interfering or\nletting nature take its course. The underlying thought seems to be\nthis: if something bad happens when you do not exist (or are not\npresent or are unable to exercise your agency) then you aren\u2019t\nresponsible for it. If we turn our attention to another world where\nyou do exist (or are present or able to exercise your agency), but\nwhich is otherwise exactly like the first, it seems that your\ncontribution to, and thus your responsibility for, the upshot is the\nsame. Thus we should not hold you responsible in the second case\neither. Bennett (1995) argues that this is a mistake. If some bad\nupshot occurs when you do not exist or cannot exercise your agency,\nthen you are not responsible for it. Your agency is not involved and\nthe bad upshot\u2019s occurrence implies nothing about the morality\nof your behaviour. But this is simply not true in the other cases. In\nthese cases, you could have prevented the bad upshot and did not. The\nbad upshot is a consequence of how you exercised your agency and does\nhave implications for the morality of your behaviour. \u201c Only a\nmuddle could lead anyone to think that \u2018I could have prevented\nit, but I did not\u2019 is significantly like \u2018I had nothing to\ndo with it\u2019\u201d (Bennett 1995, 119).\n",
