    "main_text": "Beneficence in Business Ethics || Corporate Beneficence\n7.2 Corporate Benefit-Paternalism\n\n\nPaternalism is often found in the practices of business and in\ngovernment regulation of business. For example, many businesses require\nemployees to deduct money from their salary for a retirement account;\nthey may also deduct salary money to pay for a life insurance policy.\nIf employees do not want these \u201cbenefits,\u201d they are not\nfree to reject them. Paternalism is here assumed to be an appropriate\nliberty-limiting principle. Another commonplace example comes from the\nconstruction industry and the chemical industry. If an employee wishes\nnot to wear a particular suit, mask, or other protective device, the\ncompany (and perhaps also the government) will compel it anyway, often\n(though not always) for paternalistic reasons.\n\n\nAn ongoing example of paternalism is the restriction for\npaternalistic reasons (there might be other reasons as well) of various\npictures, literature, or information\u2014often violent\ndepictions\u2014on the internet, in bookstores, and in video stores.\nCustomers may wish to purchase or receive information about these\nproducts, but paternalism thwarts their preferences. Arguments are put\nforward maintaining that those exposed to violent conduct will harm\nthemselves by such exposure\u2014for example, pornography\nmight reinforce their emotional problems or render them incapable of\nlove and other distinctively human relationships.\n\n\nA classic problem of paternalism in business ethics derives from the\nprinciple of caveat emptor\u2014Latin for \u201clet the\nbuyer beware.\u201d This property-law-derived principle is a general\nprinciple governing sales: A buyer is responsible for determining any\nunfitness in a product and is not due any form of refund or exchange\nunless the seller has actively concealed the unfitness. The buyer is\nfree to make the purchase or not make it. Paternalistic restrictions on\npurchasing have the objective that buyers not harm themselves or not\nfail to receive benefits that they otherwise might not receive. For\nexample, the control and inspection of pharmaceutical products and\ncontrolled substances\u2013through government policies and licensed\npharmacies\u2014has often been justified by appeal to paternalism.\nMany believe that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. is\nfundamentally a paternalistic agency that operates to protect the\npublic even while some members of the public do not want or approve of\nthe protections afforded.\n\n\nAs the marketplace for products has grown more complex and the\nproducts more sophisticated, buyers have become increasingly dependent\nupon salespersons to know their products and to tell the truth about\nthem. An enduring question in business ethics is whether a\nsalesperson\u2019s role should be viewed as that of paternalistic protector\nof the interests of the buyer. Suppose, for example, that a consumer\nwants a sprinkler system in his yard to water his grove of evergreens.\nHe loves the sound and look of sprinklers. However, these sprinklers\nare worthless for appropriate watering of the roots of his evergreens:\nThe owner needs drip-hose for his large collection of pine, spruce,\ncedar, and cypress. Should a salesperson insist on selling only\ndrip-hose, refusing to sell sprinkler heads; or should the salesperson\nacquiesce to the customer\u2019s preference for sprinklers?\n\n\nTraditionally salespersons have not viewed their obligations of\nbeneficence in this way, but perhaps paternalistic beneficence would be\na commendable change of practice.\n",
