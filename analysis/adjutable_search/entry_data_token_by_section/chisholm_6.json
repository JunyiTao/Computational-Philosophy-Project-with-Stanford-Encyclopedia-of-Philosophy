    "main_text": "Metaphysics III \u2014 The Ontology of Events, States of Affairs, and Facts\n7. Metaphysics III \u2014 The Ontology of Events, States of Affairs, and Facts\n\nConsider the following list of kinds of things:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nTimes\nPlaces\nPropositions\nConcrete, individual events, or \u201chappenings\u201d\nFacts\nSets\n\n\nWe can imagine a metaphysician making a grand claim about this list.\nHe could say that there really are things in each of those eight\ncategories. Furthermore, he could say, there is no redundancy in the\nlist: there is nothing that belongs in more than one of the\ncategories. Finally, this metaphysician could claim that the list is\ncomplete: everything that exists falls into one or another of the\ncategories in the list. In this way our metaphysician would have\nendorsed a fairly robust ontological\n scheme.[2]\n\nThroughout quite a long period of time, Chisholm would have maintained\nthat the imagined ontological scheme violates Occam\u2019s Razor,\nsince it affirms the existence of more fundamental kinds of things\nthan we really need. More specifically, he would have thought that he\ncould accomplish considerable pruning by replacing three of these\nproposed categories with a single new category \u2014 \u201cstates\nof affairs\u201d. He thought he could explain all talk of\npropositions (category 5) by appeal to states of affairs of a certain\nsort. Similarly, he thought he could explain all talk of concrete\nevents (category 6) by appeal to states of affairs of a different\nsort. Facts (category 7) would turn out to be nothing more than true\npropositions.\n\nUnderlying Chisholm\u2019s efforts here was a methodological view\nabout ontological commitment. Suppose there is a certain statement\nthat we take to be true; suppose that statement seems to require the\nexistence of entities of a certain type. We then must admit entities\nof that type into our ontology unless we can find a way of\nparaphrasing the statement in such a way as to preserve our original\nmeaning, but to avoid any implication of the existence of the entities\nin question. As Chisholm puts it:\n\n\u2026 from the fact that a true sentence seems to commit\nus to a certain type of thing it does not follow that there is in fact\nthat type of thing. For perhaps what the sentence tells us can be\nre-expressed in such a way that it no longer even seems to commit us\nto the type of thing in question. ([P&O], 116)\n\n\nThus, Chisholm undertook to provide paraphrases for sentences about\nconcrete events, propositions, and facts. In each case, he provided a\nparaphrase that involved states of affairs (and some other items, such\nas times). But since the project turns crucially on various claims\nabout states of affairs, Chisholm took special pains to explain\nprecisely what he took a state of affairs to be.\n\nAs examples of states of affairs, Chisholm mentions such things as\nthe author of Marmion being knighted and the author of\nWaverly being knighted. Chisholm takes these to be two different\nstates of affairs; each of them existing necessarily; neither of them\ndepending for its existence on the existence of any contingent thing.\nThus, each of these states of affairs would exist even at a possible\nworld in which there is no author of Marmion or Waverly. Furthermore,\naccording to Chisholm, states of affairs may occur,\nobtain, or take place. They serve as the objects of\nsuch attitudes as belief, hope, and mere consideration. Some of them\nserve as causes and effects. In affirming the existence of states of\naffairs, Chisholm took himself to be aligned with Frege (who,\naccording to Chisholm, used the term \u2018Gedanke\u2019\nfor entities of this sort).\n\nChisholm did not want to define states of affairs as things that can\npossibly occur, since he thought that some of them could not possibly\noccur. So he proposed instead to say that p is a state of\naffairs if and only if it is possible that there is someone who\naccepts p. Even if it\u2019s impossible for p to\noccur, it is still possible for there to be someone who accepts it. As\nJaegwon Kim pointed out (Kim 1979), there is something a bit odd about\nthe fact that Chisholm attempted to define \u2018state of\naffairs\u2019 at all, since this is supposed to be a fundamental item\nin his ontology. Furthermore, as Kim also pointed out, the definition\nis of questionable value, since there is considerable disagreement\nabout the nature of the items that we \u201caccept\u201d. Some take\nthem to be sentences; others may take them to be mental items of some\n sort.[3]\n Chisholmian states of affairs are presumably intended to be neither\nlinguistic nor psychological.\n\nFor Chisholm, entailment is not a merely logical notion. If\np entails q, then not only does p logically\nimply q, it must also be the case, necessarily, that whoever\naccepts p also accepts q. Chisholm makes use of this\ndistinctive \u201cintentional\u201d concept of entailment to explain\nthe identity conditions of states of affairs. Where p and\nq are states of affairs, p is the same state of\naffairs as q if and only if p entails q and\nq entails p. This explains why Chisholm said that\nthe state of affairs of the author of Marmion being knighted\nis distinct from the state of affairs of the author of Waverly\nbeing knighted, even if the author of Waverly happens to be the\nauthor of Marmion. So, for Chisholm, states of affairs are very\nfine-grained entities.\n\nConsider the state of affairs that is expressed by the sentence\n\u2018Someone is walking\u2019. Chisholm wanted to say that this\nstate of affairs occurs whenever someone walks, and fails to occur at\ntimes when no one is walking. Other states of affairs are not like\nthis. For them, it is impossible to sometimes occur and sometimes fail\nto occur. Chisholm claims that this provides the opportunity for an\nontological reduction. We can define a proposition as a state\nof affairs of this latter sort \u2014 it is impossible for there to\nbe times when it occurs and other times when it does not occur. A\ntrue proposition is thus one that occurs; and a\nfalse proposition is one that does not occur. Chisholm thinks\nthat we may understand the principles of logic to be about these\npropositions. By saying that a fact is a true proposition,\nChisholm gains yet another ontological reduction ([P&O], 123).\n\nChisholm thought that in some cases it makes sense to speak of the\nlocation at which a state of affairs occurs. Suppose John walks in\nChicago at a certain time. Then Chisholm would be willing to say that\nthe state of affairs of John\u2019s walking occurs in\nChicago and at that time. Furthermore, some states of affairs entail\ncertain properties. The state of affairs of John\u2019s\nwalking entails the property of walking because (i) if\nthe state of affairs occurs, then something has the property of\nwalking, and furthermore, whoever accepts the state of\naffairs believes that something has the property. This gives Chisholm\nthe ammunition he needs to explain what an event is and\nthereby to effect another ontological reduction.\n\nAmong states of affairs, there are some that (i) occur, and (ii) are\nnot propositions. Furthermore, among these states of affairs, some\n(iii) entail contingent intrinsic properties that may be exemplified\nonly by individual\n things.[4]\n Chisholm says that an event is a state of affairs that\nsatisfies all of these conditions. These are intended to play the role\nin Chisholm\u2019s ontology that concrete individual events play in\nthe ontologies of philosophers who accept concrete events as\nfundamental entities.\n\nThis way of conceiving events yields certain (possibly surprising)\nresults. For one, every event occurs. For another, events happen at\ntimes and places. Furthermore, as Chisholm sees it, when an event\noccurs, there must be some individual thing or things somehow\nparticipating in the occurrence of the event. These are the things\nthat have the properties entailed by the event. The event is said to\nbe \u201cconcretized\u201d by those things. Finally, events may\nrecur. John\u2019s walking occurs when and where\nJohn walks; it occurs only if John has the property of\nwalking. It can occur on many different occasions and in many\ndifferent places. It may be an effect of some causes, and it may be a\ncause of some effects. Chisholm goes on to discuss the role of events\nin perception, causation, and explanation.\n\nHe presents an ingenious system for counting events (\u201cJohn was\ninjured while taking his third walk of the day\u201d) that makes use\nof the concepts of time, place, and concretization. Chisholm\u2019s\nefforts in this project were described by one of his philosophical\nopponents as \u201cbreathtaking\u201d (Davidson 1970, 31).\n\nWe can see, then, that around the time of [P&O], Chisholm probably\nwould have accepted an ontological scheme more like this:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nTimes\nPlaces\nStates of affairs (some of which are event-like; some of which are\nproposition-like; and some of which are fact-like)\nSets\n\n\nAs time went by, Chisholm became dissatisfied with this picture. One\nmain source of difficulty, as he saw it, was the commitment to\ntimes. Furthermore, in spite of their utterly central place\nin this ontology, he began to feel uneasy about states of affairs.\nSome of his concern evidently arose as a result of conversations with\nhis colleague Jaegwon Kim, who had developed a different theory of\nevents. On Kim\u2019s theory, if we have a suitable object\na, property F, and time t, and a\nhas F at t, then there is an event,\na\u2019s having F at t. An event is the having of a\nproperty by a thing at a time.\n\nIn his paper \u201cEvents without Times: An Essay in Ontology\u201d\n(1990), Chisholm presented a new and even more sparse ontological\nscheme. As the title indicates, times were banished. Furthermore,\nstates of affairs disappeared, replaced by the new category of\nstates. A Chisholmian state is in some ways like a Kimian\nevent. If we have a suitable contingently existing object, a,\nand we have a suitable property, F, then, if a\nactually has F, then there is the state a\u2019s\nbeing F. A state such as this is an event. If a\ndoesn\u2019t have F, then there is no such state. There are\nno non-occurring states.\n\nThere are several things to note about these events:\n\nFirst, Chisholm uses the terms \u2018substrate\u2019 and\n\u2018content\u2019 to indicate the object and property involved in\nan event. The substrate must be a contingently existing thing. The\ncontent must be a property that the substrate has contingently. Each\nevent is said to have its substrate and content essentially. So if\nthere was such an event as Plato\u2019s writing of the\nRepublic, then that event essentially involved Plato and the\nproperty of writing the Republic. The event itself could not\nhave occurred with a different substrate or content. Nor could it have\nfailed to have its \u201ccategorial\u201d property of being an\nevent.\n\nSecond, since Chisholm has banished times from his ontology, there are\nno times in a Chisholmian state. In this respect, Chisholm\u2019s\nview differs from Kim\u2019s. This might seem to leave open the\npossibility that a Chisholmian state could occur for a while, then\nstop occurring, and then start occurring again. If a state could do\nsuch a thing, then states would be relevantly like the now-banished\nstates of affairs. But Chisholm denies this possibility. He says that\nif he was reading earlier, then stopped reading, and then started\nreading again, we have two distinct states with Chisholm as\nsubstrate and reading as content. Since there are no\n\u201ctimes\u201d Chisholm is careful to avoid saying that what\ndistinguishes these two states is their time of occurrence. When we\nsay, informally, that an event recurs, all we mean is that its\nsubstrate has had its content before.\n\nThird, by the time of \u201cEvents without Times\u201d, Chisholm had\nbecome a presentist. He also was taking tense very seriously. To say\nthat there is such a thing as x is equivalent to saying that\nthere is such a thing as x now. On this view it\nwould be wrong to say that there is such a thing as Socrates; equally,\nit would be wrong to say that Socrates is such that he formerly\nexisted but no longer does. Nevertheless, Chisholm constructed\ningenious (sometimes convoluted and unintuitive) paraphrases that\nenable us to say everything we need to say about Socrates and others\nno longer among us.\n\nSo the new ontological scheme looks more like this:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nStates; some of which are event-like\nSets\n\n\n[OM] contains a final summing up of Chisholm\u2019s metaphysical\nsystem. In [OM] Chisholm pares away still further. Among other things,\nhe proposes to get rid of sets in favor of attributes.\n",
