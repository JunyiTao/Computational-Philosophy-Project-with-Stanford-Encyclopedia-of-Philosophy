But some\nphilosophers have expressed skepticism about the morality of\nforgiveness as such. For example, some \u201cperfectionist\u201d\nviews of morality might see forgiveness, not as having intrinsic moral\nvalue, but as having only instrumental or remedial value. A\nperfectionist view might hold that whatever attitudes or actions we\novercome or forbear in forgiveness were not morally good in the first\nplace: to feel resentment, for example, admits of moral error. And so\nif one is in a position to forgive, this would reveal only that\nsomething morally sub-par had already occurred in how a victim\nresponded to being wronged. Forgiveness might be thought then as just\nthe mechanism by which we expunge those already morally mistaken\nreactions. Griswold argues that something like this perfectionist\nscheme can be found in the ancients from Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics,\nand the Epicureans (2007: 2\u201314). And though his views on what we\nnow call forgiveness are complicated, Nietzsche might be understood as\n\u201cseeing forgiveness as part of a moral system that must be\nrejected in toto\u201d (Griswold 2007: 15; cf. Blustein\n2014: 23\u201330).\n\nModern-day skeptics about moral responsibility and blameworthiness\nmight also be committed to a remedial view of the moral status of\nforgiveness (see, e.g., Pereboom 2014). If no one is morally\nresponsible and blameworthy for what they do, then morally reactive\nattitudes like resentment will likely be inappropriate for both\nepistemic and moral reasons. But if forgiving requires that one hold a\nwrongdoer morally responsible and blameworthy for what they have done,\nthey are making a kind of moral mistake. Forgiving\u2014understood as\ngiving up one\u2019s morally reactive attitudes or blaming\nbehaviors\u2014might be what is required to reverse that mistake, but\nthe need to forgive itself is evidence that something has already gone\nwrong as regards one\u2019s reactions to being wronged. According to\nMartha Nussbaum (2016), another modern critic of forgiveness, not only\ndoes forgiveness respond to an already normatively problematic\nattitude (i.e., resentment), it also takes on in its\n\u201ctransactional\u201d form a kind of morally suspect\ndown-ranking: the victim demands apology and humility from the\nwrongdoer thereby bringing her low until the victim is ready to move\non from her anger.\n\nOne contemporary critic of the positive moral status of forgiveness is\nJohn Kekes (2009), who argues that the \u201cstandard view\u201d\n(viz. that forgiveness is always or at least sometimes\nmorally good) is \u201cseriously flawed\u201d. The reason is simple:\n\u201cwhen blaming wrongdoers is reasonable, there is no reason to\nforgive them; and when blaming them is unreasonable, there is nothing\nto forgive\u201d (2009: 488; cf. Kolnai 1973; Zaibert 2009; Hallich\n2013). On Kekes\u2019 view, whether blame is reasonable depends on\n(1) whether the blamer\u2019s belief about having suffered\nundeserved, unjustified, and non-trivial harm is true; (2) whether the\nemotion such harm elicits is appropriate; (3) whether the motive (for\nblaming) is commensurate with the harm; and (4) whether the (blaming)\naction, if there is one, remains within the limits set by the\nblamer\u2019s relevant belief, emotion, judgment, and motive (2009:\n501). And so if someone has done nothing blameworthy, then\n\u201cneither blame nor forgiveness is appropriate\u201d (2009:\n501). On the other hand, if someone has done something blameworthy,\nthen \u201cblame [of the right kind and degree] is appropriate and\nforgiveness is not\u201d (2009: 501). Either way, to forgive would be\nto do something morally inappropriate.\n\nKekes\u2019 argument relies on at least two crucial assumptions.\nFirst, it assumes that forgiveness requires giving up the judgment\nthat one has been the victim of undeserved, unjustified and\nnon-trivial harm, a judgment that is \u201cat the core of\nblame\u201d (2009: 498, contrast Pettigrove 2012: 6\u20137, fn. 12).\nIf an account of forgiveness had no such requirement, however, then\nforgiveness would not be inappropriate simply because it required one\nto adopt a false belief about the past. Second, the argument assumes\nthat when a wrongdoer is blameworthy, then either blame or forgiveness\nis appropriate, but not both. Yet if one can forgive while still\njudging truly that the wrongdoer did wrong, then it may be appropriate\neither to continue to blame or to instead forgive.\nBlameworthiness may provide reasons that merely justify\nblame, even if forgiveness is also justified (Warmke &\nMcKenna 2013).\n",
