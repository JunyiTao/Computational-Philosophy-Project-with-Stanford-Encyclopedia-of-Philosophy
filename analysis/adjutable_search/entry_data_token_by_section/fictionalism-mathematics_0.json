    "main_text": "The Argument For Fictionalism || The Main Argument\n1.1 The Main Argument\n\nThe main argument for fictionalism proceeds essentially by trying to\neliminate all of the alternatives to fictionalism. The argument can be\nput like this:\n\nMathematical sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 should be read\nat face value; that is, they should be read as being of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 and, hence, as making\nstraightforward claims about the nature of certain objects; e.g.,\n\u20184 is even\u2019 should be read as making a straightforward\nclaim about the nature of the number 4. But\nIf sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 should be read at face\nvalue, and if moreover they are true, then there must actually exist\nobjects of the kinds that they\u2019re about; for instance, if\n\u20184 is even\u2019 makes a straightforward claim about the nature\nof the number 4, and if this sentence is literally true, then there\nmust actually exist such a thing as the number 4. Therefore, from (1)\nand (2), it follows that\nIf sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are true, then there are\nsuch things as mathematical objects. But\nIf there are such things as mathematical objects, then they are\nabstract objects, i.e., nonspatiotemporal objects; for instance, if\nthere is such a thing as the number 4, then it is an abstract object,\nnot a physical or mental object. But\nThere are no such things as abstract objects. Therefore, from (4)\nand (5) by modus tollens, it follows that\nThere are no such things as mathematical objects. And so, from (3)\nand (6) by modus tollens, it follows that\nSentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are not true (indeed,\nthey\u2019re not true for the reason that fictionalists give, and so\nit follows that fictionalism is true).\n\n\nThe three inferences in this argument are all pretty clearly valid,\nand so the only question is whether the four basic premises\u2014(1),\n(2), (4), and (5)\u2014are true. And the nice thing about the way\nthis argument is set up is that each of these premises is supposed to\nget rid of a different alternative to fictionalism. So the argument in\n(1)\u2013(7) is actually a shell of a much longer argument that includes\nsubarguments in favor of the basic premises and, hence, against the\nvarious alternatives to fictionalism.\n\nGiven this, we can say that there are five alternatives (or if\nyou\u2019d rather, five categories of alternatives) to\nfictionalism. Those who reject (1) can be called paraphrase\nnominalists; those who reject (2) can be called\ndeflationary-truth nominalists; those who reject (4) are\neither physicalists or psychologists; and those who\nreject (5) are platonists. In order to motivate their view,\nfictionalists need to provide arguments against all of these\nviews.\n\nThe easiest part of the fictionalist\u2019s job here is arguing\nagainst the various anti-platonist views. All of these\nviews\u2014paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth nominalism,\nphysicalism, and psychologism\u2014can be understood (as fictionalism\ncan) as reactions to platonism. Platonism is a very attractive view\nbecause it provides an extremely natural and pleasing account of\nmathematical practice and mathematical discourse. But despite this,\nmany philosophers do not endorse platonism because they cannot bring\nthemselves to accept its ontology. In other words, they simply\ndon\u2019t believe that there are any such things as abstract\nobjects. Because of this, much of the work that\u2019s been done in\nthe philosophy of mathematics has been dedicated to attempts to avoid\nplatonism. In particular, paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth\nnominalism, physicalism, and psychologism can all be understood in\nthese terms. They all attempt to undermine the platonistic view of the\ntruth conditions of mathematical sentences. But as will become clear\nbelow, there are serious problem with all of these views. And this is\nwhere fictionalism comes in: it grants the platonistic view of the\ntruth conditions of mathematical sentences but still denies the\nplatonist\u2019s ontological thesis that there exist abstract\nobjects. This makes fictionalism different from other anti-platonist\nviews in an important way. We can appreciate this by noting that\nplatonism involves two different theses, one semantic and the other\nontological. The semantic thesis is an empirical hypothesis about the\ntruth conditions of ordinary mathematical utterances, and the\nontological thesis is a deeply metaphysical hypothesis about the\nexistence of abstract objects. Every version of anti-platonism rejects\nthe platonist\u2019s ontological hypothesis, and all of the\nnon-fictionalistic versions of anti-platonism reject the semantic\nthesis as well. Fictionalism is the only anti-platonistic view that\ndoesn\u2019t reject the semantic thesis. And this is why fictionalism\ncan seem more attractive than the other versions of\nanti-platonism\u2014because the platonist\u2019s semantic hypothesis\nis extremely plausible and well-motivated. Thus, the versions of\nanti-platonism that reject this hypothesis can seem implausible and\nunmotivated.\n\nSo, again, the easy part of the argument for fictionalism (or at any\nrate, the easier part) is carried out by providing arguments\nfor premises (1), (2), and (4)\u2014or equivalently, by providing\narguments against the various non-fictionalistic versions of\nanti-platonism, i.e., paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth\nnominalism, physicalism, and psychologism. The next three subsections\n(1.2\u20131.4) discuss these four views as well as some arguments\nthat fictionalists might mount against them. Section 1.5 covers the\nmore difficult part of the fictionalist\u2019s argument\u2014i.e.,\npremise (5) and the question of how fictionalists might argue against\nplatonism.\n",
