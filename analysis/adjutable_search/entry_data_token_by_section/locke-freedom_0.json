    "main_text": "Actions and Forbearances\n1. Actions and Forbearances\nFor Locke, the question of whether human beings are free is the\nquestion of whether human beings are free with respect to their\nactions and forbearances. As he puts it:\n[T]he Idea of Liberty, is\nthe Idea of a Power in any Agent to do or forbear any Action,\naccording to the determination or thought of the mind, whereby either\nof them is preferr\u2019d to the other. (E1\u20134 II.xxi.8: 237)\n\n In order to understand Locke\u2019s conception of freedom, then,\nwe need to understand his conception of action and forbearance.\nThere are three main accounts of Locke\u2019s theory of action.\nAccording to what we might call the \u201cDoing\u201d theory of\naction, actions are things that we do (actively), as\ncontrasted to things that merely happen to us (passively). If\nsomeone pushes my arm up, then my arm rises, but, one might say, I did\nnot raise it. That my arm rose is something that happened to\nme, not something I did. By contrast, when I signal to a\nfriend who has been looking for me, I do something inasmuch\nas I am not a mere passive recipient of a stimulus over which I have\nno control. According to some interpreters (e.g., Stuart 2013: 405,\n451), Locke\u2019s actions are doings in this\nsense. According to the \u201cComposite\u201d or\n\u201cMillian\u201d theory of action, an action is \u201c[n]ot one\nthing, but a series of two things; the state of mind called a\nvolition, followed by an effect\u201d (Mill 1974 [1843]: 55). On this\nview, for example, the action of raising my hand is composed of (i)\nwilling to produce the effect of my hand\u2019s rising and (ii) the\neffect itself, where (ii) results from (i).  According to some\ninterpreters (arguably, Lowe 1986: 120\u2013121; Lowe 1995:\n141\u2014though it is possible that Lowe\u2019s theory applies only\nto voluntary actions), Locke\u2019s actions are composite in\nthis sense. Finally, according to what we might call the\n\u201cDeflationary\u201d conception of action, actions are simply\nmotions of bodies or operations of minds.\nSome of what Locke says suggests that he holds the\n\u201cDoing\u201d theory of action: \u201cwhen [a Body] is set in\nmotion it self, that Motion is rather a Passion, than an Action in\nit\u201d, for \u201cwhen the Ball obeys the stroke of a\nBilliard-stick, it is not any action of the Ball, but bare\npassion\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.4: 235\u2014see also E4\u20135 II.xxi.72:\n285\u2013286). Here Locke is clearly working with a sense of\n\u201caction\u201d according to which actions are opposed to\npassions. But, on reflection, it is unlikely that this is what Locke\nmeans by \u201caction\u201d when he writes about\nvoluntary/involuntary actions and freedom of action.  For Locke\ndescribes \u201ca Man striking himself, or his Friend, by a\nConvulsive motion of his Arm, which it is not in his\nPower\u2026to\u2026forbear\u201d as \u201cacting\u201d (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.9: 238), and describes the convulsive leg motion caused by\n\u201cthat odd Disease called Chorea Sancti Viti [St.\nVitus\u2019s Dance]\u201d as an \u201cAction\u201d (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.11: 239). It would be a mistake to think of these convulsive\nmotions as \u201cdoings\u201d, for they are clearly things that\n\u201chappen\u201d to us in just the way that it happens to me that\nmy arm rises when someone else raises it. Examples of convulsive\nactions also suggest that the Millian account of Locke\u2019s theory\nof action is mistaken. For in the case of convulsive motion, there is\nno volition that one\u2019s limbs move; indeed, if there is volition\nin such cases, it is usually a volition that one\u2019s\nlimbs not move. Such actions, then, cannot be composed of a\nvolition and the motion that is willed, for the relevant volition is\nabsent (more on volition below).\nWe are therefore left with the Deflationary conception of action,\nwhich is well supported by the text. There are, Locke says, \u201cbut\ntwo sorts of Action, whereof we have any Idea, viz.\nThinking and Motion\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.4: 235\u2014see also E1\u20135\nII.xxi.8: 237 and E4\u20135 II.xxi.72: 285); \u201cThinking, and\nMotion\u2026are the two Ideas which comprehend in them all\nAction\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxii.10: 293). It may be that, in the sense in\nwhich \u201caction\u201d is opposed to \u201cpassion\u201d, some\ncorporeal motions and mental operations, being produced by external\ncauses rather than self-initiated, are not actions. But that is not\nthe sense in which all motions and thoughts are \u201ccalled and\ncounted Actions\u201d in Locke\u2019s theory of action\n(E4\u20135 II.xxi.72: 285). As seems clear, convulsive motions are actions\ninasmuch as they are motions, and thoughts that occur in the mind\nunbidden are actions inasmuch as they are mental operations.\nWhat, then, according to Locke, are forbearances? On some\ninterpretations (close counterparts to the Millian conception of\naction), Locke takes forbearances to be voluntary not-doings (e.g.,\nStuart 2013: 407) or voluntary omissions to act (e.g., Lowe 1995:\n123). There are texts that suggest as much:\n\nsitting still, or holding one\u2019s peace,\nwhen walking or speaking are propos\u2019d, [are]\nmere forbearances, requiring\u2026the determination of\nthe Will. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.28: 248)\n\n However, Locke distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary\nforbearances (E2\u20135 II.xxi.5: 236), and it makes no sense to\ncharacterize an involuntary forbearance as an involuntary voluntary\nnot-doing. So it is unlikely that Locke thinks of forbearances as\nvoluntary not-doings. This leaves the Deflationary conception of\nforbearance, according to which a forbearance is the opposite of an\naction, namely an episode of rest or absence of thought. On this\nconception, to say that someone forbore running is to say that she did\nnot run, not that she voluntarily failed to run. Every forbearance\nwould be an instance of inaction, not a refraining.\nIn E2\u20135, Locke stipulates that he uses the word\n\u201caction\u201d to \u201ccomprehend the forbearance too of any\nAction proposed\u201d, in order to \u201cavoid the multiplying of\nwords\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.28: 248). The reason he so stipulates is not\nthat he literally takes forbearances to be actions (as he\nputs it, they \u201cpass for\u201d actions), but that most\neverything that he wants to say about actions (in particular, the\ndistinction between voluntary and involuntary actions, and the account\nof freedom of action) applies pari passu to forbearances (see\nbelow).\n",
