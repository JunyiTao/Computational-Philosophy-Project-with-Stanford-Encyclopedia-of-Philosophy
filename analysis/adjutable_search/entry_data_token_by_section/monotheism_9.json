    "main_text": "Are the \u201cMonotheistic Traditions\u201d Really Monotheistic? || Christianity and the Trinity\n7.2 Christianity and the Trinity\n\n\nThe question of the Trinity\u2019s compatibility with monotheism is best\napproached by seeing how that doctrine fares in the light of the three\nstrongest arguments for God\u2019s uniqueness\u2014the arguments from\nGod\u2019s sovereignty, from his omnipotence, and from the demand for total\ndevotion.\n\n\nThe crucial premise of the first argument is that God\u2019s will is the\ncausally necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of\ncontingent beings. (Or, alternatively, a causally necessary condition\nof the existence of every contingent being and the causally sufficient\ncondition [in the strong sense] of the existence of at least one of\nthem. For the sake of brevity we will focus exclusively on the simpler\ncase, however.) The argument from sovereignty can be deployed against\nthe Trinity only if the relevant property is regarded as an attribute\nof each member of the Trinity rather than of the Trinity as a whole\n(that is, of the Trinity considered as a single concrete entity). The\nWestern or Augustinian Tradition does not. On the contrary, the divine\nintellect and will are aspects of a single divine essence that subsists\nin three \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201chypostases.\u201d It is thus\nfalse that there are three distinct creative wills, and therefore false\nthat there are three distinct creative wills each of which is a\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition of the existence of\ncontingent beings.\n\n\nAnother view, though, is implicit in the position of many second and\nthird century church fathers, some western Christian Platonists, and\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church as a \n  whole.[1] \n The Trinitarian views of Ralph\nCudworth (1617\u201388) are fairly typical of this position. There are three\nhypostases or \u201cpersons.\u201d Each has its own individual\nessence. But all share a common specific or generic essence (namely,\ndivinity), so that each member of the Trinity is eternal, necessarily\nexistent, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the like.\n\n\n\u201cThere is not a trinity of [independent] principles,\u201d\nhowever, \u201cbut \u2026 only one principle or fountain of Godhead\n[the Father] \u2026 from which the other[s, namely, the Son and the\nHoly Spirit] are derived.\u201d They together constitute one entity\n(\u201cone entire divinity\u201d), as \u201cthe root, and the stock\nand the branches\u201d constitute \u201cone tree,\u201d or as the\nsun, the light, and its splendor are \u201cundivided\u201d and form\none thing. Indeed, there is so \u201cnear a conjunction\u201d\nbetween the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as can be found nowhere else\nin nature. The relations between them are necessary and eternal; they\nare \u201cindivisibly and inseparably united.\u201d Moreover, each\nperson inheres or indwells in the others, and they are all \u201cad\nextra one and the same God, jointly concurring in all the same\nactions,\u201d they being all \u201cone creator\u201d (Cudworth,\n598, 616\u201320).\n\n\nOn the surface, the argument from sovereignty appears to preclude\nthe \u201cPlatonic Trinity.\u201d For, on Cudworth\u2019s view, the wills\nof the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are necessarily concurrent.\nFor example, \u201cThe Father wills that s\u201d entails\n\u201cThe Son wills that s,\u201d and vice versa. Because the\ncreative volition of any member of the Trinity entails that the other\ntwo will the same thing, if any one of them wills the\nexistence of a contingent being, then they all will it. So if\ntheir concurrent willings are a causally sufficient condition of\nthe existence of contingent beings, then the Father\u2019s (or the Son\u2019s or\nthe Holy Spirit\u2019s) willing the existence of contingent beings is itself\na causally sufficient condition of the existence of contingent beings\n(since it entails the concurrent willing). And, of course, the creative\nvolition of any member of the Trinity is also a necessary\ncausal condition of the existence of contingent beings. It would seem,\nthen, that there are three creative volitions, each\nof which is a causally sufficient and causally necessary condition of\nthe existence of contingent beings. There are thus three sovereign\ncreative wills, and this appears to contradict the monotheistic claim\nthat sovereignty is necessarily unique.\n\n\nAppearances may be deceiving, however. For even though the Father\u2019s\n(or the Son\u2019s or the Holy Spirit\u2019s) willing that s entails\nthat s, the Father\u2019s volition isn\u2019t, by itself,\nsufficient for s\u2019s occurrence. For s won\u2019t occur\nunless the Son and Holy Spirit also will it. It is therefore\nnot causally sufficient for the occurrence of s in\nthe strong sense of sufficient condition employed in the argument from\nsovereignty, namely, that x is a causally sufficient\ncondition of y in the strong sense if and only if, given\nx alone, y exists or occurs. In that sense,\nthere is only one causally sufficient condition of the\nexistence of contingent beings, and that is the joint\noperation of the\nnecessarily concurrent wills of the Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. So there is, as Cudworth says, only \u201cone creator.\u201d\nIt thus isn\u2019t clear that either the premises or conclusion of the\nargument from divine sovereignty precludes the existence of the\nPlatonic Trinity.\n\n\nNor does the omnipotence proof rule out the existence of the\nTrinity, since the hypostases are not distinct persons in the\nnontechnical sense of \u201cperson\u201d employed in that` argument.\nThey are not distinct persons in the ordinary sense of\n\u201cperson\u201d because their wills can\u2019t conflict. Either there\nis only one will (which is part of the one divine essence) or the\n(distinct) wills of the three hypostases necessarily concur.\n\n\nFinally, the third argument precludes the existence of the Trinity\nonly if each member is, in abstraction from the others, an appropriate\nobject of total devotion and unconditional commitment. In spite of the\naberrations of some Christians, it is reasonably clear that the object\nof the Christian\u2019s ultimate concern is the Trinity as a whole,\nand not one or more of its members considered in isolation. Christian\nattitudes towards the Father, for example, are inseparable from\nChristian attitudes towards the Son. Christ is worshiped as\nthe Son of the Father, for instance, and the Father is worshiped\nas the one who fully reveals himself in Christ. It follows\nthat Christians are only committed to regarding the triad as\nthe appropriate object of theistic attitudes, and that the argument\nfrom the appropriateness of these attitudes therefore cannot be used to\nshow that a trinity of divine \u201cpersons\u201d is impossible.\n",
