    "main_text": "The Motivational Tradition in Affective Science and Its Opponents || Basic Emotion Theory: Emotions as Evolved Affect Programs\n8.1 Basic Emotion Theory: Emotions as Evolved Affect Programs\n\nBasic emotion theory emerged in the 1970s from the pioneering work of\nSilvan Tomkins, whose orienting insight was that \u201cthe primary\nmotivational system is the affective system\u201d (Tomkins 2008: 4).\nTomkins proposed that there are nine basic or innate affects\ncontrolled by inherited programs: interest, enjoyment, surprise, fear,\nanger, distress, shame, contempt and disgust. Their motivational power\ncomes from their feeling pleasurable or painful, with such hedonic\nfeelings emerging from the perception of facial changes providing\n\u201cmotivating feed-back\u201d (Tomkins 2008: 623).\n\nTomkins\u2019 theory of basic affects was followed by two related\ndevelopments. The first was the birth of modern-day basic emotion\ntheory, with its consuming attention for the universality of facial\nexpressions, present especially in the work of Paul Ekman (Ekman et\nal. 1972; Ekman 1980, 1999a, 2003; Ekman & Friesen 1969) and\nCarrol Izard (1971, 1977, 1992, 2007). The second was the emergence of\nthe evolutionary psychology approach to emotions understood as\nsolutions to recurrent evolutionary problems, with prominent\ncontributions by Plutchick (1980) and Tooby and Cosmides (2008) (see\nalso Shand 1920 and McDougall 1908 [2001] for earlier examples of\nevolutionary theories of emotions).\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the two approaches have progressively merged,\nalthough evolutionary psychologists are more inclined than basic\nemotion theorists to conclude that a given emotion solves an\nevolutionary problem merely on the basis of plausibility arguments.\nAccording to Ekman (1999a: 46), \u201cemotions evolved for their\nadaptive value in dealing with fundamental life tasks\u201d such as\n\n\n\n[f]ighting, falling in love, escaping predators, confronting sexual\ninfidelity, experiencing a failure-driven loss in status, responding\nto the death of a family member. (Tooby & Cosmides 2008: 117; see\nalso Keltner & Haidt 2001)\n\n\nThey have adaptive value because they quickly mobilize and coordinate\nresources needed to successfully deal with life tasks, and because\nthey communicate socially relevant information via bodily expressions.\nAs soon as a basic emotion program is activated, a \n\n\ncascade of changes (without our choice or immediate awareness) occurs\nin split seconds in: the emotional signals in the face and voice;\npreset actions; learned actions; the autonomic nervous system activity\nthat regulates our body; the regulatory patterns that continuously\nmodify our behavior; the retrieval of relevant memories and\nexpectations; and how we interpret what is happening within us and in\nthe world. (Ekman & Cordaro 2011: 366)\n\n\nFrom this follows the central empirical hypothesis of traditional BET:\nthere should be bodily signatures for each basic emotion consisting of\nhighly correlated and emotion-specific changes at the level of facial\nexpressions, autonomic changes and preset and learned actions. More\nspecifically, Ekman defined basic emotions in terms of (a) distinctive\nuniversal signals, (b) distinctive physiology, (c) distinctive\nthoughts, memories and images, (d) distinctive subjective experiences,\n(e) predictable developmental appearance, (f) homologous presence in\nother primates, (g) automatic appraisals tuned to distinctive\nuniversals in antecedent events, (h) quick onset, brief duration, and\nunbidden occurrence (Ekman 1999a: 5). Some basic emotion theorists\nhave also suggested that basic emotions are associated with\ndistinctive hardwired neural circuits (e.g., Izard 2011; Levenson\n2011; Panksepp 1998, 2000).\n\nArmed with this definition, Ekman proceeded to argue that we have\nempirical evidence for six basic affect programs (happiness, sadness,\nanger, fear, disgust, and surprise), later on expanding the list to\ninclude states whose basic status is likely to be proven in the future\nsuch as amusement, contempt, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride\nin achievement, relief, satisfaction, wonder, ecstasy, sensory\npleasure, and shame (Ekman & Cordaro 2011). Scientifically-minded\nphilosophers often restrict their discussions of emotions to the basic\naffect programs, since these are argued to be the only natural kinds\nso far discovered in the affective domain (Griffiths 1997; DeLancey\n2002).\n\nThe main source of evidence for basic affect programs arguably comes\nfrom cross-cultural studies on facial expressions that use a\nrecognition technique first described by Darwin (1872). It consists of\nshowing pictures of emotional expressions and asking observers what\nemotions they express from a list of six to ten emotion terms in the\nobserver\u2019s language. As reported by Ekman (1999b), experiments\nof this sort have so far been performed with observers from dozens of\ncountries, revealing significant agreement on which emotion is\nportrayed (the recognition rates are strongest for happiness, sadness\nand disgust). This being said, membership to a given culture increases\nrecognition of expressions from that culture, which has led some to\nargue that emotional expressions are a universal language with\ndifferent dialects (Elfenbein et al. 2007).\n\nIn combination with complementary data on the production of facial\nexpressions (Matsumoto et al. 2008), the recognitional data have been\ntaken to speak in favor of the hypothesis that affect programs are\nevolutionary adaptations producing the same mandatory facial changes\nin all cultures, although culturally specific display rules can\npartially mask such cross-cultural universality.\n\nThe evidence for universality has been criticized on methodological\nand conceptual grounds. Methodologically, it has been argued that the\nexperiments are defective because they rely on a forced choice\nparadigm which inflates consensus and because they rely on\necologically unrealistic stimuli such as actors\u2019 posed faces\n(Russell 1994). Conceptually, it has been argued that the evolutionary\nhypothesis that selection would favor the production of mandatory\nfacial expressions is implausible, because in conflict situations it\nmay not be in the evolutionary interest of the emoter to let observers\nknow about what emotions they are experiencing (e.g., communicating\nfear during a confrontation). And even if there were universality of\nrecognition and production of emotional expressions, alternative\nexplanations like species constant learning would be able to account\nfor the data (Fridlund 1994).\n",
