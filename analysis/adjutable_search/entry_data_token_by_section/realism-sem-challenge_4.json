    "main_text": "The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism || Radical Skepticism\n3.3 Radical Skepticism\n\nAccording to Hilary Putnam, the metaphysical realist subscribes not\njust to the belief in a mind-independent world but also to the thesis\nthat truth consists in a correspondence relation between words (or\nmental symbols) and things in that mind-independent world. Call this\nthesis correspondence truth (after Devitt 1991). More\nimportantly, metaphysical realists aver that an ideal theory of the\nworld could be radically false, Putnam contends:\n\u2018radical\u2019 in the sense that all (or\nalmost all) of the theory\u2019s theses could fail to hold. Such a\nglobal failure would result if we were to be\n\u2018brains-in-a-vat\u2019 our brains manipulated by mad scientists\n(or machines, as in the movie The Matrix) so as to dream of\nan external world that we mistake for reality. Call this thesis\nradical skepticism.\n\nIt is widely believed that states of affairs that are truly\nmind-independent do engender radical skepticism. The skeptic contends\nthat for all we could tell we could be brains in a vat\u2014brains\nkept alive in a bath of nutrients by mad alien scientists. All our\nthoughts, all our experience, all that passed for science would be\nsystematically mistaken if we were. We\u2019d have no bodies although\nwe thought we did, the world would contain no physical objects, yet it\nwould seem to us that it did, there\u2019d be no Earth, no Sun, no\nvast universe, only the brain\u2019s deluded representations of such.\nAt least this could be the case if our representations derived even\npart of their content from links with mind-independent objects and\nstates of affairs. Since realism implies that such an absurd\npossibility could hold without our being able to detect it, it has to\nbe rejected, according to anti-realists.\n\nA much stronger anti-realist argument due to Putnam uses the\nbrain-in-a-vat hypothesis to show that realism is internally\nincoherent rather than, as before, simply false. A crucial assumption\nof the argument is semantic externalism, the thesis that the reference\nof our words and mental symbols is partially determined by contingent\nrelations between thinkers and the world. This is a semantic\nassumption many realists independently endorse.\n\nGiven semantic externalism, the argument proceeds by claiming that if\nwe were brains in a vat we could not possibly have the thought that we\nwere. For, if we were so envatted, we could not possibly mean by\n\u2018brain\u2019 and \u2018vat\u2019 what unenvatted folk mean by\nthese words since our words would be connected only to neural impulses\nor images in our brains where the unenvatteds\u2019 words are\nconnected to real-life brains and real-life vats. Similarly, the\nthought we pondered whenever we posed the question \u201cam I a brain\nin a vat?\u201d could not possibly be the thought unenvatted folk\npose when they ask themselves the same-sounding question in English.\nBut realism entails that we could indeed be brains in a vat. As we\nhave just shown that were we to be so, we could not even entertain\nthis as a possibility, Putnam concludes that realism is incoherent\n[Putnam 1981]. For this argument to work, however, Putnam must be\nassuming a rather restrictive form of modal rationalism: we could be\nbrains in a vat only if in the circumstance that we were envatted, we\ncould conceive that we were envatted.\n",
