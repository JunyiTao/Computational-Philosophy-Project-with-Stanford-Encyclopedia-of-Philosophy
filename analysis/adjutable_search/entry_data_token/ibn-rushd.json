Life and Works\n1.1 Life\n\nAb\u016b al-Wal\u012bd Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ahmad Ibn Rushd was born in\nCordova in 1126. He belonged to an influential Andalusian family,\nfamous for its judicial power and for its scholarship in the religious\nsciences. His father was a prominent judge, but the most important\nfigure in the family was his grandfather, who also bears his name, Ibn\nRushd, and so the philosopher is called \u201cthe grandson\u201d\n(al-\u1e25af\u012bd) to distinguish him from his grandfather\n(al-jadd). The latter was both a well-known judge and a famed\njurist, being the author of many books in jurisprudence following the\nM\u0101lik\u012b school.\n\nUnlike\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n and\n al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\n Ibn Rushd did not write an autobiography, and as a result many\naspects of his life are obscure and will remain so unless new\ndocuments are discovered. The limited information we have from his\nbiographers unanimously agrees on his good conduct, his diligence in\nscience, and his fairness as a judge, while noting his interests in\nphilosophy and his adoption of certain \u201caudacious\u201d views.\nThe surviving historical sources tell us much about his teachers in\nthe religious sciences, but, with the exception of medicine, we know\nlittle about those who taught him in other fields. He was certainly\nnot a disciple of either of his famous Andalusian contemporaries,\n Ibn B\u0101jja\n or Ibn Tufayl, although he read their philosophical works. (Puig 1992\nand Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999 discuss the intellectual circles around Ibn\nRushd.)\n\nIbn Rushd was 22 when the Almohads came to power in the western\nMaghreb and Andalusia. Given that the Ibn Rushds had been prominent in\ncircles close to the previous Almoravid dynasty, it was imperative for\nthe grandson to express in his writings, and perhaps even in person,\nhis commitment to the new rulers and the Almohad creed\n(da\u02bfwa) conceptualized by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn\nT\u016bmart (d. 1130). Some surviving testimonies suggest that Ibn\nRushd did in fact adopt Ibn T\u016bmart\u2019s creed at some point in\nhis life (see Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999).\n\nGiven the social position of his family, Ibn Rushd soon found himself\nin the ruling circles of Marrakesh and close to the princes, or at\nleast some of them, in Andalusia. He engaged in debates on\nphilosophical and theological issues with this inner circle, and there\nis a record of a meeting with Ab\u016b Ya\u02bfq\u016bb Y\u016bsuf (r.\n1163\u201384), the second Almohad ruler, who officially asked Ibn\nRushd to comment on Aristotle\u2019s works and render them\naccessible. Later he became chief physician to the caliph in\nMarrakesh.\n\nNevertheless, Ibn Rushd\u2019s relationship with the Almohad creed\nwas complex and seems to have evolved (Geoffroy 1999; Ben Ahmed\n2020c). Recently discovered revisions to his al-Kashf \u02bfan\nman\u0101hij al-adilla contain paragraphs where Ibn Rushd shows a\nsort of critical distance towards Ibn Tumart\u2019s creed. These\nparagraphs, when added to his harsh criticism of the Almohads in his\ncommentary on Plato\u2019s Republic, may help us understand\nthe evolution he underwent during his intellectual life. They may shed\nlight in particular on the disgrace he suffered at the end of his\ncareer, when, for reasons that remain unclear, he fell out of favor\nwith the Almohads and was exiled in Lucena, 60 km southeast of\nCordova. According to one account, his death took place while he was\nconfined to a residence in Marrakesh in 1198. (The definitive\nbiography, in Arabic, is Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999. For more on the\nhistorical context see Urvoy 1998 and Ben Ahmed 2020c.)\n1.2 Works\n\nIbn Rushd remained productive for at least four decades. He was the\nauthor of a large corpus that extends over medicine, logic and\nphilosophy in all its branches, including natural philosophy,\nastronomy, metaphysics, psychology, politics, and ethics. His work\nalso includes the sciences of Islamic religion: jurisprudence\n(fiqh), the foundations of Islamic law (us\u016bl\nal-fiqh), the foundations of religion (us\u016bl\nal-d\u012bn), and the science of the Arabic language, including\ngrammar. With important exceptions, most of his works are available in\nthe original Arabic. For those works that have been lost, while\nreaders await the day of their rediscovery, they must generally make\ndo with medieval translations in Hebrew or Latin.\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s work deploys various methods and styles. Many\ntreatises are in the form of a commentary, most famously and\nextensively on Aristotle\u2014covering nearly the whole Aristotelian\ncorpus\u2014but also on Galen\u2019s medical treatises, as\nwell as on other philosophers such as Plato, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and\nIbn B\u0101jja. Many other treatises, devoted to specific issues, are\nnot in commentary form. (For a detailed inventory of texts and\ntranslations see \u00a710.1.)\n\nThe focus of his commentaries was Aristotle because no one has yet\nsurpassed his achievement: \u201cno one who has come after him to\nthis our time\u2014and this is close to 1500 years later\u2014has\nbeen able to add a word worthy of attention to what he said\u201d\n(LongPhys proem; Harvey 1985, 83). Scholarship going back to\nthe nineteenth-century has divided the commentaries into three\nkinds:\n\nthe epitome or short commentary (jaw\u0101mi\u02bf),\nwhich he favored at the start of his career;\nthe paraphrase or middle commentary (talkh\u012b\u1e63),\nseemingly composed throughout his career;\nthe literal or long commentary (shar\u1e25 or\ntafs\u012br), dating to his later years.\n\n\nInasmuch as Ibn Rushd routinely wrote different kinds of commentaries\non the same Aristotelian treatise, some such distinction seems\nnecessary. But recent scholarship has doubted whether this neat\nthreefold distinction adequately captures Ibn Rushd\u2019s complexly\nvaried approach (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b 1986a; Druart 1994; Gutas 1993).\nAt a minimum, it omits important categories of work, such as compendia\n(mukhta\u1e63arat), treatises (maq\u0101l\u0101t),\nand answers to questions (mas\u0101\u02beil), to say nothing\nof the important treatises that focus on religious questions.\n\nThe most prominent of those independent religious treatises are\n\nThe Decisive Treatise (Fa\u1e63l\nal-Maq\u0101l), an argument for the value of philosophy to\nIslam;\nThe Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tah\u0101fut\nal-Tah\u0101fut), a direct response to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhose work had achieved considerable influence at the time in\nAndalusia (Di Giovanni 2019);\nThe Exposition of the Methods of Proof concerning Religious\nDoctrines (al-Kashf \u02bfan man\u0101hij al-adilla f\u012b\n\u02bfaq\u0101\u02beid al-milla), a philosophically nuanced\nalternative to the teachings of Ash\u02bfarite theology.\n\n\nThese works, which seem to have had little influence on medieval\nChristian thought, have traditionally been seen as\n\u201ctheological\u201d and contrasted with his supposedly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d works: the commentaries on Aristotle that\ncirculated throughout medieval and Renaissance Europe in Latin and\nHebrew translation. The latter were thought to be demonstrative, and\naimed at the elites, whereas the former were said to be merely\ndialectical, and so aimed at a popular audience. Accordingly Ibn\nRushd\u2019s true position supposedly had to be sought in these\nAristotelian commentaries.\n\nThis distinction has affected the direction of scholarship, causing\ngreat attention to be given to the \u201cphilosophical\u201d works,\nwhich were thought to represent most truly his thought, and leaving\nthe \u201ctheological\u201d treatises to be comparatively neglected.\nEven where the latter are widely taught, they are set apart from his\nsupposedly more philosophical commentaries. The result, ever since the\ninitial research of Renan (1852), has been a segmented and fragmentary\nview of the Rushdian corpus that marginalizes important aspects of his\nthought.\n\nAn important correction to this tendency appears in Jamal Al-D\u012bn\nAl-\u02bfAlaw\u012b (1986a), who defends the unity and coherence of\nthe Rushdian corpus. He proposes that Ibn Rushd\u2019s works form a\nunity where there is no room to distinguish between what is a\ncommentary on another text and what is an ostensibly original work.\nWith this, Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b attempted to close a gap in a body of\nwork that should rightly be seen as continuous, and to reconnect texts\nthat have been disassociated from their contexts.\n2. Logic and Methodology\n\nThe general character of Ibn Rushd\u2019s philosophy is illuminated\nby his overarching picture of logic. Most broadly, he understands it\nas the study of the conditions and rules that rightly guide the mind\ntoward the conception (ta\u1e63awwur) of essences and the\nassent (ta\u1e63d\u012bq) to propositions\n(CompLogic 1.1). Glossing Aristotle\u2019s famous remark\nthat \u201cit is the mark of the educated person\u201d to seek the\nappropriate level of precision in any inquiry, Ibn Rushd clarifies\nthat the educated person is \u201cone who has been instructed in the\nart of logic\u201d (ParaEthics I.3, 3C).\n\nIn keeping with the weight he accords the subject, Ibn Rushd commented\nseveral times on each work in Aristotle\u2019s logical\nOrganon. Near the start of his career, he wrote a\nCompendium of Logic that includes Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and follows the usual Arabic practice of including\nthe Rhetoric and Poetics as part of an expanded\nOrganon (Black 1990). Later, he wrote a series of longer\nparaphrases of this same corpus (but treated the Isagoge\nseparately, on the grounds that it is neither an introduction to nor\neven a part of logic). Toward the end of his life, he devoted one of\nhis five long commentaries to the Posterior Analytics.\n\nIn line with the approach of his predecessors, Ibn Rushd divided\nlogical processes into five types of argument: demonstrative,\ndialectical, rhetorical, poetical, and fallacious. These inferences\nare not distinguished by their forms, which are the same, but by their\nmatter, that is, by their premises. The premises of demonstrative\narguments are necessary (Thom 2019), the premises of dialectical\narguments are generally accepted, the premises of rhetoric are\ngenerally received, the premises of poetic arguments are imaginative,\nand the premises of sophistical arguments are deceiving.\n\nFor Ibn Rushd, the center of logic and its very purpose is\ndemonstration, for it is the only procedure that leads to certainty in\nphilosophy: it is \u201cthe most perfect kind of reflection\n(na\u1e93ar), using the most perfect kind of inference\n(qiy\u0101s)\u201d (Decisive Treatise 3).\nAccordingly, even in the context of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nhe begins his commentary by announcing that his goal is \u201cto\nabstract such scientific arguments attributable to Plato as are\ncontained in the Republic by removing from it its dialectical\narguments.\u201d However, this does not mean that non-demonstrative\narguments are useless. Generally, where one kind of argument is not\neffective, other kinds of arguments should be used. Dialectic offers a\npath toward demonstration and to science, which, although it does not\nobtain certainty, is close to it. Rhetoric contributes, through its\nparadigms and enthymemes, to reinforcing and promoting demonstrative\nevidence. The study of sophistical reasoning is useful in assessing\nthe faulty argumentative methods of the theologians (the\nmutakallim\u016bn, that is, practitioners of\nkal\u0101m).\n\nIn light of the high status of demonstration, Ibn Rushd considered it\nwith great care in his commentaries. He devoted a compendium, a\nparaphrase and a long commentary to the Posterior\nAnalytics\u2014which he calls the Book of Demonstration\n(Kit\u0101b al-Burh\u0101n)\u2014and wrote separate\ntreatises on various special issues. The long commentary is probably\nthe most appropriate text for his positions on the components of\ndemonstration, its types, and its role in producing scientific\nknowledge. That commentary is also the occasion for a critical and\nsevere interaction with the two Islamic authorities in logic before\nhim, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101.\n\nThe purpose of examining demonstrative arguments is to understand the\nabsolute demonstration that gives complete certainty and constitutes a\nscience (LongPostAn I.7 {180}). There are, however, other\nkinds of demonstration, less certain than the absolute one, but still\ndemonstrative. In all, Ibn Rushd distinguishes three types\n(LongPostAn I.95 {348}):\n\nan absolute demonstration (burh\u0101n mu\u1e6dlaq),\nwhich establishes the existence of a thing on the basis of a cause\nthat is known prior to its effect;\na demonstration of existence (burh\u0101n al-wuj\u016bd),\nwhich he calls a sign (dal\u012bl), which establishes a\nthing\u2019s existence without any grasp of its cause (see\nElamrani-Jamal 2000);\na demonstration of the cause (burh\u0101n al-\u02bfilla\nor burh\u0101n al-sabab), which establishes the cause once\nthe effect\u2019s existence is known. (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b\n1986b)\n\n\nIn mathematics, it is generally possible to frame absolute\ndemonstrations, because the premises both supply the cause and are\nbetter known than their conclusions. In the natural sciences, however,\nand even in metaphysics, this ideal situation is generally not\nachievable. Here we begin with the accidental sensible features of\nthings, and so extensive use must be made of the demonstration of\nexistence (EpiPhys 1.105 {9}; Sylla 1979; Cerami 2014). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, whose views are often the target of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\nlogic, had denied that these count as a demonstration at all, on the\ngrounds that they establish no substantial connection between the\nposterior cause and the prior effect. Ibn Rushd rejects this view\n(LongPostAn I.95 {349}), but admits that the demonstration of\nexistence is less reliable than the other demonstrations. Certainty\ncomes in degrees, and the differentiation in certainty between these\ndemonstrations is one of the reasons why some sciences are superior to\nothers (ParaPostAn \u00a788\u20139).\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s enthusiasm for demonstration does not prevent him\nfrom valuing other logical arts, and he was particularly concerned\nwith the place of dialectic. Broadly speaking, according to Aristotle,\ndialectic has three main uses: as intellectual training, as a path\ninto the demonstrative sciences of philosophy, and as a means of\nconversing with ordinary people (Topics I.2). But Ibn Rushd\ndevotes less space and shows less interest in this third feature of\ndialectic, and one wonders whether this is due to his critical\nreaction to the discursive practices of the\nmutakallim\u016bn. Despite the many considerations that make\ndialectic more suitable when dealing with ordinary people, Ibn Rushd\nsuggests that rhetorical and poetic statements are preferable\n(ParaTop I.5C {31}; Ben Ahmed 2010-2011, 299\u2013302,\n307\u201317). Hence their inclusion in the expanded Organon.\nThe significance of rhetoric and poetics is a result he establishes in\npolitical science, but maintains even when it comes to teaching and\nanchoring theological truths. The bad example set by the dialectical\nsyllogisms of the mutakallim\u016bn shows how dialectical\nmethods, in discussion with ordinary people, are actually\ndisadvantageous.\n\nUnder the influence of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn Rushd puts\nemphasis on the need to introduce dialectic as a method\n(\u1e6dar\u012bq), a set of rules, techniques, and warnings\n(Ben Ahmed 2020a, 262\u20137). This conception of dialectic makes it\ndistinct from both demonstration and sophistical reasoning, as well as\nfrom ordinary conversations. When used well, dialectic is a communal\nenterprise and so again different from other arts, such as\ndemonstration, where there is no need for more than one party. A\nsuccessful \u201cpartnership\u201d in dialectic is one where each\nparty does their best to commit themselves to the rules. From this\nperspective, it becomes evident that the questioner is not simply an\nadversary seeking to defeat his opponent, but rather a partner and a\ncollaborator with the respondent in the search for knowledge. Any\ndebate that is motivated by the pursuit of victory or by deriving\npleasure from defeating one\u2019s opponent is a debate that cannot\nfall under the method of dialectic. He writes, \u201cthe communal\nenterprise (al-\u02bfamal al-mushtarak) can be achieved in\nits utmost perfection only by both partners. They can have something\nin common when their aim is the assessment and the deduction of the\ntruth, or the realization of their training. Thus, the respondent\nshould perfect his response if he intends that aim, because the basest\nof the partners is the one who aims at the obstruction of the communal\nenterprise. But if their aim is to struggle against and defeat the\nother, then they will have nothing in common\u2026. This is not the\nmethod of dialectic\u201d (ParaTop 8.132D {233}; Ben Ahmed\n2020a, 267)\n\nAt the far reaches of the logical arts, the connection to the genuine\nsyllogism becomes remote. So, even while Ibn Rushd recognizes that\npoetics is a syllogistic art, he says that it lacks the power of a\nreal syllogism and is thus unproductive (CompLogic 12.3). In\nhis paraphrase of the Poetics, he avoids using the term\n\u201cpoetic syllogism\u201d altogether.\n\nIn the realm of jurisprudence, Ibn Rushd is famous for his position on\nthe logical and epistemological value of juridical inferences, which\nin his view produce nothing more than opinion\n(\u1e93ann). Even when confronted with the\nsurprising insertion of the word for jurisprudence (fiqh)\ninto the Arabic translation of the Prior Analytics 68b10, Ibn\nRushd chooses totally to ignore it. In his juridical writings, he\nopenly denies the accuracy of the term \u2018syllogism\u2019\n(qiy\u0101s) for what jurists had become accustomed to\ncalling their juridical inferences (al-maq\u0101y\u012bs\nal-fiqhiyya or qiy\u0101s shar\u02bf\u012b).\nWhen jurists speak of qiy\u0101s, it is important to\nrecognize that the term bears quite a different meaning\n(Abridgement 299 {130\u20131}; Bou Akl 2019). In particular,\ncontrary to what happens in the syllogism, the qiy\u0101s of\nthe jurists does not have the power to deduce the unknown from the\nknown. And even in those cases where Ibn Rushd seems to accept\njuridical inference, he does not make use of logical vocabulary, but\ninstead deploys the terms used by most of the jurists before him.\nRather than engage in a \u201csyllogistification\u201d of the\njuridical inference, he focuses on the semantic and linguistic origins\nof juridical rules. For Ibn Rushd, every science has its own\ncharacteristics; therefore, anyone who tried to study logic while\nstudying jurisprudence would fail at studying both\n(Abridgement 123 {37\u201338}).\n3. Metaphysics\n\nThe divisions between metaphysics, natural philosophy, psychology, and\ntheology are permeable for Ibn Rushd, and the systematic character of\nhis thought makes it difficult to treat any part in isolation. (See\nthe start of EpiMeta for his division of the sciences.) Here\nour method of proceeding is to begin with the most general principles\nof being, and then to turn, in the next section, to their causal\nrelationships.\n\nOf the various kinds of being, substances are what exist in the most\nproper sense (EpiMeta 4.138 {125}). Among substances, the\nmost familiar are concrete individuals like dogs and stones\n(EpiMeta 2.58 {43}). But these are composite entities, and\nsince the principles of a substance are themselves even more properly\nconsidered to be substances (EpiMeta 1.31 {15\u201316};\nLongAnima II.8), the most fundamental substances in the\nsensible realm are the metaphysical ingredients of composite\nsubstances, matter and form (LongMeta VII.44 {960}).\n\nUnderlying all change, and enduring through it, is homogeneous matter,\ndefined simply by its potentiality\u2014that is, its potential to\nserve as subject for any earthly form (SubstOrb 1.50).\nConceived of without form, it is perpetually enduring and numerically\none everywhere: \u201call transient bodies share this body that is\nnumerically one\u201d (SubstOrb 2.87), because it is\n\u201cdeprived of the divisions of individual forms\u201d\n(LongMeta XII.14 {1473}). Ibn Rushd worries in predictable\nways about the reality of this so-called prime matter (m\u0101dda\n\u02be\u016bl\u0101). On the one hand, he consistently counts it\nas a substance (e.g., ParaAnima 2.115). On the other hand,\nmatter so-conceived is a \u201cpure privation\u201d and \u201cdoes\nnot exist outside of the soul\u201d (LongMeta XII.14\n{1473\u20134}). He offers the less-than-perspicuous compromise\nformula that prime matter lies \u201chalfway, as it were, between\nabsolute non-being and actual being\u201d (quasi medium inter\nnon-esse simpliciter et esse in actu) (LongPhys I.70;\nParaPhys I.3.3.276).\n\nMatter exists only when actualized by form, but the first form it\nreceives is not the nature of the composite substance (dog, stone,\netc.) but instead the \u201cindeterminate dimensions\u201d\n(al-ab\u02bf\u0101d ghayr al-ma\u1e25d\u016bdat) that give\nmatter its corporeal character: \u201cthe three dimensions that\nconstitute the nature of body are the first state in matter, and\nmatter cannot be devoid of them in any instance of generation: not\nthat they exist in matter in actuality, but rather in some kind of\npotentiality different from the potentiality in which matter is\nconstituted\u201d (ParaGC I.4.26 {32}; SubstOrb\n1.55). In postulating a persisting extended substratum beneath all\nphysical change, Ibn Rushd has been said to take a step toward the\nres extensa of seventeenth-century mechanical philosophy\n(Hyman 1965). But his conception of matter, far from making further\nforms unnecessary, explains how multiple forms can be instantiated in\nthe same material stuff: \u201cthe presence of dimension in prime\nmatter is a prerequisite for the existence of contraries\u201d\n(EpiMeta 3.126 {112}). Since forms, by their nature, are\nalways individuals\u2014universals, Ibn Rushd insists, do not exist\noutside the soul (EpiMeta 2.73\u20135\n{57\u20139})\u2014the theory does not require a \u201cprinciple of\nindividuation\u201d for form. Extended matter does, however, serve as\nwhat might be called a principle of multiplication. If the material\nrealm were not extended, \u201cthere would exist in it only one form\nat a given time\u201d (SubstOrb 1.60; Di Giovanni 2007).\n\nAlongside matter, the other internal principle of composite substances\nis form, and so form too counts as a substance (LongAnima\nII.2), and indeed is substance in the most proper sense of the term\n(Amerini 2008; Di Giovanni 2012). Substantial forms can be\ndistinguished from accidents in that a subject (a dog, a stone)\nendures through the gain and loss of its accidents, whereas when the\nsubstantial form of the subject departs, the subject ceases to exist\nor exists only homonymously (ParaAnima 2.120)\u2014as one\nmight speak of cremating one\u2019s grandfather. Interpreters have\ndisagreed on whether Ibn Rushd allows a single substance to have\nmultiple substantial forms. But at least sometimes he seems to suppose\nthat one substance has just one form, as when he holds that \u201cif\nprime matter were to have its own form, it would receive no other\nform, while enduring, but would immediately be corrupted as soon as\nthat other form were generated\u201d (LongPhys I.69; see\nSubstOrb 1.50). If elsewhere he seems to suggest that any\nnecessary feature of a thing will count as a substantial form of it,\nthis may mean merely that a substantial form is a composite of\nmultiple discrete, incomplete constituents (Di Giovanni 2011; Cerami\n2015, 521\u20134). Ibn Rushd is clear, at any rate, that the essence\n(dh\u0101t) or quiddity (m\u0101hiyya) of a thing is\naccounted for entirely by its form, rather than by its form and matter\n(LongMeta VII.34 {896}). Thus, \u201cform is the primary\nsubstance only because it is the cause of the determinate substance\nand the determinate substances come to be substance only by it\u201d\n(LongMeta VII.5 {761k}).\n\nAccidents, which can come and go from a substance, are inseparable\nfrom that substance, and are caused by it (EpiMeta 2.56 {42};\nLongMeta XII.25 {1532\u20133}), but are not themselves a\npart of the substance (LongAnima II.4; Tah\u0101fut\nI.6.216 {359}). They do not have existence in an absolute sense, but\nonly relationally (LongMeta XII.3 {1415}; EpiMeta\n1.28 {12}), and indeed Ibn Rushd generally does not refer to them as a\nform (\u1e63\u016bra), preferring to reserve that term for\nthe substantial form.\n\nThe earthly realm we have been describing is just one small and\nrelatively insignificant part of what there is. Much more exalted, and\na much worthier subject of intellectual contemplation, is the eternal\nheavenly domain. Here Ibn Rushd broadly follows standard premodern\ncosmology in describing the eight celestial spheres of the moon, the\nsun, the five planets, and the fixed stars. These spheres are solid,\ntransparent bodies, spinning around the earth, luminous only at those\npoints where the sphere thickens (SubstOrb 2.92). Celestial\nbodies are composites of matter and form, but of an utterly different\nkind. Their matter is actually existent, incorruptible and\nindivisible, with a determinate size and shape (SubstOrb\n2.82; LongMeta XII.10 {1447}). Celestial matter is in\npotentiality only with regard to motion, and that motion, although\ngenerally circular, is extremely complex, with as many as 55 distinct\nmotions identifiable among the eight spheres (LongMeta XII.48\n{1679}). Each of these distinct motions requires a distinct\nactualizing form (EpiMeta 4.147 {135}; LongMeta\nXII.43 {1645}), but these are not material forms, inhering in the\ncelestial matter (since that matter is already actualized). Instead,\nthese celestial forms are separate and, like all forms not inhering in\nmatter, they are therefore intellectual: \u201cif there are these\nforms that have existence inasmuch as they are not in matter, then\nthese are necessarily separate intellects, since there is no third\nkind of existence for forms qua forms\u201d\n(EpiMeta 4.150 {139}; Incoherence I.6 {338}). In\naddition to intellects, these forms have desires, and indeed are aptly\nreferred to as souls (LongMeta XII.36 {1593};\nSubstOrb 1.71, 2.81). It is this desire, rather than any sort\nof physical contact, that moves the spheres, with the beauty of its\ncelestial intelligence serving as a final cause, and its desire\nefficiently moving the sphere. Far from being cold bodies in empty\nspace, these spheres are \u201calive, full of pleasure, and delighted\nin themselves\u201d (EpiMeta 4.162 {152}). Adding to their\ndelight is their partial understanding of and desire for the first and\nunmoved mover, which moves all of the spheres through their desire for\nthis highest cause (LongMeta XII.44 {1649\u201350};\nEpiMeta 4.154 {142}). (For this cosmology in its historical\ncontext, see Wolfson 1962 and Endress 1995.)\n4. Natural Philosophy\n\nThe previous section followed the order of discovery, beginning with\nwhat is better known to us. Here we start with what is causally prior,\nand so begin with the First Cause. (On Ibn Rushd\u2019s method of\ninquiry see Cerami 2015 ch. 7.) Although the existence of some kind of\nFirst Cause was undisputed, religious and philosophical authorities\ndisagreed about the nature of creation. The most common view was that\nthe world came into existence, from God, after having not existed, but\nIbn Rushd follows Aristotle in supposing that the world has always\nexisted, eternally. His strategy for explaining how an eternal world\ncan have a First Cause turns on distinguishing between two kinds of\ncausal orderings, essential and accidental.\n\nCauses that are essentially ordered are simultaneous, such that the\nprior stages are a condition for the effect\u2019s ongoing existence,\nas when waves move a ship, the wind moves the waves, and the wind is\nmoved by elemental forces (QPhys 7.25 {235};\nIncoherence I.1 {59}). In such a series there must be a first\ncause, because an endless such series would be actually infinite all\nat once, which Ibn Rushd regards as impossible (Incoherence\nI.4 {275}). The series could, moreover, never reach its end, since\ncausal agency cannot pass through an infinitely long series in a\nfinite time (LongPhys VII.6; QPhys 7.25 {235}). This\nFirst Cause cannot itself be something in motion, given the\nAristotelian dictum that everything that is in motion must be moved by\nanother (LongPhys VII.1; QPhys 7.30 {236}). In\nprinciple, Ibn Rushd allows that there could be many unmoved movers\n(QPhys 7.35 {238}), but at a minimum there must be one such\nthing that is immovable, and eternally so, because otherwise some\nstill prior mover would be required to move the supposedly first\nmover, and this would lead again to an essentially ordered infinity of\nmovers (EpiMeta 4.139 {126}). (For the intricate details see\nTwetten 2007.)\n\nAn accidental ordering takes place over time, as when rain comes from\na cloud, the cloud comes from vapor, and vapor comes from a prior rain\n(Incoherence I.4 {268}). Such an ordering is circular,\ninasmuch as the materials from one stage are corrupted and reused in a\nlater stage, and so there is no threat of an actual infinity. There is\nthus nothing incoherent about such a series extending infinitely far\ninto the past and infinitely far into the future, and indeed Ibn Rushd\nargues that such an infinity can be proved in various ways (Davidson\n1987). One fundamental proof arises from the nature of the First\nCause. Since it is itself unmoved\u2014that is, wholly\nchangeless\u2014its causal agency must likewise be eternal. \u201cA\nthing lacking the potential for change and alteration cannot be\nchanged at any time, since if it were then its alteration would be by\ncause of itself, and so there would be alteration without the\npossibility for it\u201d (LongCaelo I.103). It is, for Ibn\nRushd, incoherent to posit an eternally existing, changeless\nactuality, which suddenly springs into agency after having not acted\nfor an eternity. In general, \u201cthe effect of a cause cannot be\ndelayed after the causation\u201d (Incoherence I.1 {15}).\nSimilar considerations show that the world\u2019s future existence\nmust likewise be eternal (Incoherence 1.1 {22}).\n\nFor the reasons just rehearsed, an eternal and unchanging First Mover\nentails an eternal and unchanging first thing moved, and observation\nsuggests that this must be the outermost sphere of the stars, whose\ndiurnal rotation in turn moves everything within its ambit:\n\u201cthere is a moved thing that is first by nature, which moves the\nwhole, and which terminates every movement whose mover is\nexternal\u2026. The mover of this [first] moved thing is, of itself,\nnot a body and is absolutely and essentially unmoved\u201d\n(EpiPhys 8.242 {141}). Past this first ceaseless motion, the\ncausal story becomes increasingly complex, under the influence of the\ncelestial intelligences. Ibn Rushd is suspicious of the unrealistic\nconvolutions of Ptolemaic cosmology, preferring to honor the\nprinciples of Aristotelian physics even where that leaves a gap\nbetween theory and observation (Sabra 1984; Endress 1995). A\nstrikingly personal remark describes how he had once aspired to close\nthat gap, but has now, in his old age, abandoned the project\n(LongMeta XII.45 {1664}). Anticipating the modern rise of\nscientific specialization, he yields the field to those who devote\nthemselves solely to this one science (LongMeta XII.48\n{1679}).\n\nThe spheres move eternally in majestic circles simply because it\nbefits their lofty existence to do so (EpiMeta 4.152 {140},\nLongMeta XII.36 {1595}, Incoherence I.15 {484}), but\nthese motions have a subordinate effect of signal importance to us:\nthey sustain the very existence of our sublunary world. Most\nbasically, the motion of the celestial spheres\u2014although they are\nnot themselves hot (SubstOrb 2.95)\u2014gives rise to heat\nin the fiery region immediately beneath the lunar sphere, and from\nheat and its contrary, cold, arise the four elements: earth, air,\nfire, water. \u201cThe existence of the celestial body entails\nnecessarily the existence of the elements \u2026 as preserving,\nefficient, formal, and final cause\u201d (EpiMeta 4.171\n{161}; Incoherence I.3 {261}). The bodies that furnish our\nsublunary realm are various elemental mixtures, in which the elements\nthemselves endure in an attenuated state, as the material strata above\nprime matter (EpiMeta 1.48 {32}; LongCaelo III.67;\nEpiGC I.121 {22\u20133}; see Maier 1982 ch. 6). The\nqualities of these elements\u2014hot, cold, wet, dry\u2014\u201care\nthe causes of all natural things that come into being and pass\naway\u201d (Incoherence II.1 {525}). The entire system so\ndepends on the celestial spheres that \u201cif the motion of the\nheavens were destroyed, \u2026 the world in its totality would be\ndestroyed\u201d (SubstOrb 4.117; Kashf 5.112\n{191}).\n\nMatter is, at least potentially, infinitely divisible, but at the\nlevel of elements and mixed bodies we can refer to the smallest body\ncapable of still being a body of that kind\u2014the minimum\nnaturale\u2014e.g., \u201cthe minimal possible magnitude of\nfire\u201d (EpiPhys 7.212 {114}, Glasner 2009 ch. 8; Cerami\n2015, 429\u201336). Any sort of mixed body requires a substantial\nform to actualize it, but Ibn Rushd\u2019s view of how such forms\nemerge evolves. His early works hold that, at least at the level of\nliving things, substantial forms cannot be generated by wholly natural\nprocesses, but require a celestial \u201cgiver of forms,\u201d the\nAgent Intellect (EpiMeta 4.171 {162}). His later view is more\nthoroughly naturalistic, and argues that prime matter contains the\npotentiality for all substantial forms, which need only be actualized\nby a natural agent, along with the usual cooperation of the celestial\nbodies (LongMeta VII.31 {883}, XII.18.109 {1499}; see\nDavidson 1992 ch. 6; Freudenthal 2002; Cerami 2015 chs.\n8\u20139).\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s naturalistic conception of generation and corruption\nis of a piece with one of his most famous philosophical stances, his\nrejection of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s occasionalism. On this\ntheological tradition, \u201cwhen a man moves a stone by leaning\nagainst it and pushing it, he does not push it, but it is the Agent\nwho creates the motion\u201d (LongMeta XII.18.112 {1504}).\nIbn Rushd heaps scorn on this view in the Incoherence,\nresting his case most fundamentally on the link between a\nthing\u2019s causal role and its defining nature: \u201cit is\nself-evident that things have essences and attributes that determine\nthe special functions of each thing and through which the essences and\nnames of things are differentiated. If a thing did not have its\nspecific nature, it would not have a special name nor a definition,\nand all things would be one\u201d (II.1 {520}). (For discussion of\nthis argument see Kogan 1985 ch. 3.)\n\nFor further details see the entry on\n Ibn Rushd\u2019s natural philosophy\n and the entry on\n causation in Arabic and Islamic thought.\n5. Psychology\n\nIn the Aristotelian tradition, Ibn Rushd postulates a special sort of\nsubstantial form\u2014a soul\u2014to account for living substances.\nEven in the mundane case of plants, the complexities of their\noperations require a special principle beyond what would be adequate\nfor nonliving things: nutrition, for instance, \u201cis ascribed to\nthe soul because it is impossible for it to be ascribed to the powers\nof the elements\u201d (LongAnima II.14). His theory of the\nsoul\u2019s operations distinguishes, most basically, between the\nnutritive, sensory, and rational levels. Judging from his casually\nflexible terminology, he sees no real difference between treating\nthese as different souls within a single living thing or as parts of a\nsingle soul\u2014parts characterized as a power (quwwa) or\nprinciple (mabda\u02be). Judging again from his varying\nformulations, he thinks there can be no definitive list of how many\nsuch powers of the soul there are. The question he does regard as\nmeaningful is whether a power is distinguished solely in terms of its\nfunction, or also in terms of its substrate\u2014as he puts it,\nwhether it \u201cdiffers from the other powers in subject as well as\nin intention (ma\u02bfn\u0101), or only in intention\u201d\n(LongAnima III.1; ParaAnima \u00b6276). Each of the\nfive external senses, for instance, has its own subject, a sensory\norgan, whereas some of the higher sensory operations have dedicated\norgans, in the brain, whereas other operations, such as recollection\n(Black 1996) and choice (Phillipson 2013), are mere functions produced\nby multiple powers working in conjunction. This question of\n\u201csubject\u201d is particularly vexed, as we will see, for the\npowers of intellect.\n\nThe \u201cfoundation\u201d of cognition at all levels is its\npassivity (LongAnima II.54). This is particularly clear for\nthe five external senses, which have as their objects the material\nqualities of the external world. Color, for instance, the proper\nobject of sight, is an elemental mixture on the surface of bodies\n(ParaParv I.10 {15}), which acts on an illuminated medium and\nthen the organ of the eye, making its recipient at each stage be like\nthe color itself. The general (although not perfect) reliability of\nthe process\u2014that a sense with respect to its proper sense object\n\u201cdoes not err in regard to it for the most part\u201d\n(LongAnima II.63)\u2014is a product of the natural\nworld\u2019s causal regularity. Indeed, the passivity of the five\nsenses is such that Ibn Rushd, when speaking most carefully, seems to\ntreat these organs as themselves simply the corporeal media through\nwhich sensible qualities are conveyed to the one true principle of\nsensation, the common sense (al-\u1e25iss al-mushtarak). He\nwrites, for instance, that \u201cthrough the innermost of all the\ncurtains of the eye, the common sense can perceive the form\u201d\n(ParaParv I.19 {30}); here is where we pass from a purely\ncorporeal stage to \u201cthe first of the spiritual stages\u201d\n(ParaParv II.26 {42\u20133}). The lesson he draws from\nAristotle\u2019s notoriously obscure treatment of common sense\n(De anima 425b12ff) is that the principle of sensation is\n\u201cone in number and multiple in extremities and organs,\u201d\nlike a point at the center of a circle (ParaAnima \u00b6260).\nOnly here is perception both self-aware and capable of assimilating\nthe objects of multiple sensory modalities. All subsequent cognition\nis dependent on the information collected at this stage. (See Black\n2019 for the theory\u2019s strict empiricism.)\n\nTo account for the functional role of common sense, Ibn Rushd accepts\nits traditional\u2014even antiquated\u2014location at the heart,\nwith the concession that common sense has its origin there, but\nterminates in the brain (ParaParv II.36 {59}). This brings\nsensible forms to the higher sensory powers, of which he recognizes\nthree that are distinct within the human brain both in function and in\nsubject:\n\nimagination (al-mutakhayyila, al-khay\u0101l);\nthe cogitative power (al-mufakkira, al-mumayyiza);\nmemory (al-\u1e25\u0101fi\u1e93a,\nal-dh\u0101kira).\n\n\nThese faculties, listed in order from the anterior to the posterior of\nthe brain\u2019s supposed three chambers (ParaParv II.26\n{42}), account for much of human cognition. Most basically (for\ndetails see LongAnima II.63, III.6; Blaustein 1984;\nHansberger 2019), imagination allows us to form sensory images taken\nfrom sensation even when we are not presently sensing an object. The\ncogitative power refines these images so as to allow a distinct grasp\nof the \u201cindividual contents\u201d (al-ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b\nal-shakh\u1e63iya, known in the Latin tradition as\n\u201cintentions\u201d) that are confusedly contained within sensory\nexperience. Memory stores and recalls these images. Ibn Rushd\nexplicitly argues (Incoherence II.2 {546-7}) that the\ncogitative power can do all the work that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 had split\nbetween a cogitative power and a further estimative power\n(al-quwwa al-wahmiyya). The overall process\nis compared to the gradual \u201cabstracting and cleansing\u201d of\nthe rind, eventually leaving just the fruit itself (ParaParv\nII.26 {43}), these fruits being the \u201csubstantial\ndifferences\u201d between individuals (LongAnima II.65).\nNonhuman animals, because they lack a cogitative power entirely, are\nincapable of moving beyond superficial sensory appearances\n(LongAnima III.57).\n\nIn keeping with his broadly naturalistic orientation, Ibn Rushd allows\nthe brain a much larger share of the cognitive load than one finds in\nmost premodern philosophers. But the \u201cfruit\u201d these\ncorporeal powers yield is always a representation of a particular\nindividual. To think abstractly\u2014to have universal\nconcepts\u2014requires the powers of intellect, and here is where his\nnaturalism notoriously comes to an end. Ibn Rushd, though he deploys a\nbewildering variety of terms for different aspects of intellect,\nultimately endorses just two intellectual powers distinct both in\nfunction and subject:\n\nan agent intellect (\u02bfaql al-fa\u02bf\u02bf\u0101l),\nwhich illuminates imagined intentions, making them universal;\na material intellect (\u02bfaql al-hay\u016bl\u0101ni),\nwhich receives those abstracted forms and thereby\nthinks\u2014fittingly described as \u201cmaterial\u201d not because\nit is corporeal but because it is a matter-like potentiality for\nreceiving forms in the intelligible domain.\n\n\nFollowing what was then the dominant Aristotelian view, he treats the\nagent intellect as a single, separate, eternal substance, and spends\nlittle time arguing for this doctrine, or even explaining how it\n\u201cilluminates\u201d imagined intentions (LongAnima\nIII.17\u201318; Davidson 1992, pp. 315\u201318). In contrast, he\ndiscusses the material intellect at length in various treatises, with\nhis views evolving dramatically over time (see Taylor 2009). Here we\nfocus only on his final considered view of the subject, as set out in\nthe Long Commentary, according to which the material\nintellect, like the agent intellect, is a single, separate, eternal\nsubstance (LongAnima III.5).\n\nIbn Rushd recognized the audacity of supposing that human beings share\nin a single intellect, writing that \u201cthis claim came to me after\nlong reflection and intense care, and I have not seen it in anyone\nelse before me\u201d (CommAlex, p. 30). Indeed, he himself\nhad once called such a view \u201crepulsive\u201d\n(ParaAnima \u00b6282). Still, we can understand why he was\neventually drawn to it in light of his commitment to three\npropositions:\n\nHuman beings think abstractly;\nAbstract thought is impossible for corporeal beings;\nHuman beings are corporeal.\n\n\nAlthough the trio is jointly contradictory, each claim is individually\nplausible: (A) seems obvious; (B) follows from the familiar\nAristotelian argument that a power capable of understanding all bodies\nmust itself contain the nature of no body (LongAnima III.4);\n(C) is a consequence of Ibn Rushd\u2019s eventual conclusion that the\nvarious strategies for situating an immaterial power within a human\nbeing\u2014his own and that of earlier commentators\u2014were all\nfailures. The genius of his ultimate position was to find a way for\nall three claims to be embraced. In one sense, human beings are\nindividual composites of matter and substantial form, and so wholly\ncorporeal. Although he consistently describes both the material and\nthe agent intellect as parts of the human soul (e.g.,\nLongAnima III.5 {406}), they are souls and actualities only\nequivocally: they are not the actuality of a body (LongAnima\nII.7, II.21, III.5 {396\u20137}). When human beings are conceived in\nthis narrow way, (C) is true and (A) is false.\n\nBut of course there must be some sense in which (A) is true. Ibn Rushd\ninsists that, even though we all share the material intellect, its\nthinking can count as my thinking. To explain this, he\nappeals to Aristotle\u2019s doctrine that \u201cthe soul never\nthinks without an image\u201d (De anima III.7, 431a17;\nWirmer 2008, 367\u201375). The material intellect, although separate,\nis dependent both for its function and for its very existence on\nreceiving imagined intentions from individual human beings\n(CommAlex p. 29); it is eternal only because the human\nspecies is eternal (LongAnima III.5 {407}). Each of us,\ntherefore, partially controls the operation of this separate material\nintellect. Its operation is to think, but inasmuch as we each\ncontrol our imagination, and the imagination is what triggers thought,\nit is appropriate to think of the thoughts we trigger as our\nthoughts, and to think of the two shared intellects, agent and\nmaterial, as each a part of our soul (LongAnima II.60,\nIII.18, III.36 {500}). With this, Ibn Rushd offers the first developed\nstatement of the\n extended-mind\n thesis: that a being\u2019s cognitive system extends beyond the\nindividual organism. When human beings are conceived in this extended\nway, (A) is true and (C) is false.\n\nEven if this extended conception of a human being is allowed, that\nstill leaves a question about why these two separated intellects must\neach be singular, and so shared by all human beings. Ibn Rushd\u2019s\nanswer depends in part on an argument against private concepts: that\nwithout concepts that are literally shared, teachers could not convey\nknowledge to students (LongAnima III.5 {411\u201312}; Ogden\nforthcoming). He also argues that an intellect individuated by a\ncorporeal subject would receive individualized forms\n(LongAnima III.5 {402}; Ogden 2016). Accordingly, he thinks\nthe domain of actually intelligible concepts, and of the intellects in\nwhich those objects exist, must be entirely separate from the material\nrealm, and cannot be individuated by matter. And, as we have seen in\nthe previous two sections, he is for independent reasons committed to\nthe existence of such a realm, among the celestial spheres.\nAccordingly, the human intellectual powers can be identified as the\nlowest members of this hierarchy (LongAnima III.19; Davidson\n1992, 223\u201331; Taylor 1998).\n\nFor further information see the entry on\n Arabic and Islamic psychology and philosophy of mind.\n6. Religion\n6.1 God\n\nIbn Rushd believes that God\u2019s existence can be demonstrated\nthrough a complex argument from Aristotelian physics, establishing the\nexistence of a first cause (see \u00a75). As with physical arguments\nin general, the argument is a mere sign (dal\u012bl),\nstarting from empirical features of the world that are better known to\nus even if causally posterior (LongMeta 12.5 {1423}; see\n\u00a72) He rejects the a priori metaphysical arguments of\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (Davidson 1987 ch. 10; Bertolacci 2007) and of the\nAsh\u02bfarite theologians (Kashf 1), all of which he thinks\nnot only fall short of being demonstrative but also fail to be\npersuasive to ordinary people. For them, one should follow the example\nof the Qur\u02be\u0101n and deploy arguments from design\n(Kashf 1.33\u201338 {118\u201322}).\n\nIn keeping with Aristotle\u2019s remarks in Metaphysics\nXII.7, Ibn Rushd suggests that God serves not as an efficient cause,\nbut only as a final and formal cause. Efficient causality prevails\namong natural bodies, when one actually moving body brings another\nbody from potential to actual motion. The heavenly bodies, however,\nare already actual, and eternally so, and so in this domain efficient\ncausation has no place (PossibConj 14.86). The relationship\nof First Cause to the celestial spheres, then, is that of intelligible\nto intellect\u2014that is, the eternal thoughts of the First Cause\nare the forms that serve as final causes inspiring the celestial\nintelligences (LongMeta XII.36 {1592}; XII.44 {1652};\nLongCaelo IV.1.654; Incoherence I.14 {481};\nConjunction Epistle 1, par. 3-4). God, being wholly\nimmaterial, cannot directly act on the sublunary material realm at\nall, but plays a causal role only through the mediation of the\ncelestial spheres: \u201cthe temporal cannot proceed from an\nabsolutely eternal being, but only from an eternal being which is\neternal in its substance but temporal in its movements, namely, the\ncelestial body\u201d (Incoherence I.13 {467}).\n(Interpretation here is more contentious than this brief summary\nsuggests. For various approaches see Kogan 1985 ch. 5; Davidson 1992,\n227\u201330; Adamson 2019; Twetten forthcoming.)\n\nGod alone, among intellectual beings, has no further object of\nintellectual contemplation that might serve as his final cause. On the\ncontrary, \u201cthe First Form thinks of nothing outside\nitself\u201d (LongAnima III.5 {410}; EpiAnima 219\n{93}; EpiMeta 4.158 {147}; LongMeta XII.51 {1700}).\nThis helps account for God\u2019s unique simplicity as a pure mind,\nalways fully actualized by nothing other than God. It leads to\nquestions, however, about the sense in which God can be said to have\nknowledge of the created world. This is \u201cthe most powerful\ndoubt\u201d regarding this conception of God (EpiMeta 4.159\n{148}), and it threatens to lead to the view al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b had\nbranded as heretical: that God does not know particulars\n(Incoherence II.4 {587}). Ibn Rushd denies that he is\ncommitted to this consequence. God has knowledge of the created world\nin his own manner, neither in universal nor particular, not as if his\nthoughts are caused by the world, but rather as the cause of the world\n(Incoherence I.3 {226-7}, I.13 {462};\n\u1e0cam\u012bma 7; LongMeta XII.51\n{1707\u20138}). The divine mind\u2019s \u201cthinking its own self\nis identical with its thinking all existence\u201d\n(Incoherence I.11 {435}).\n\nFor terms to apply to God and creatures in a non-univocal way\n(bi-ishtir\u0101k) is a common state of affairs for Ibn Rushd\n(LongMeta XII.39 {1620\u20134}). It arises, for instance,\nnot just in the case of knowledge but also in the case of will. For,\nsince God \u201cis exempt from passivity and change,\u201d He does\nnot exercise will in the usual sense of the term (Incoherence\nI.3 {148}). Still, in another sense God is \u201can intending and\nwilling agent\u201d (Kashf 5.80 {163}) in virtue of the\nspecial causal relationship that God has to the world. Similarly, Ibn\nRushd affirms, in a special sense, that God is the creator of the\nworld (QPhys 3; Kashf 5.78\u201391\n{161\u2013173}), and that God exercises providence\n(\u02bfin\u0101ya) over all existent beings, though he denies\nthat any individual enjoys a special divine providence\n(LongMeta XII.37 {1607}, XII.52; EpiMeta\n4.176\u201381 {166\u201371}). It is difficult to assess the degree\nto which, on this account, either God\u2019s will or the world is\nnecessitated (Belo 2007; Hourani 1962; Taylor 2014).\n\nThe various strands of Ibn Rushd\u2019s conception of God are set out\non one hand against Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s insufficiently\nAristotelian philosophy, and on the other hand against Ash\u02bfarite\ntheology (kal\u0101m). His systematic examination of the\nAsh\u02bfarites in al-Kashf establishes at length that their methods\nare sophistical and delusional, drawing on two basic resources: the\nintention of Islamic law and Aristotle\u2019s philosophy (Arfa Mensia\n2019). But even where Ibn Rushd is examining the\nmutakallim\u016bn and offering rival interpretations of\nreligious texts, it is not his intention to set philosophy at the\nservice of any kind of theology. Instead these writings are more\nappropriately classified as philosophical considerations on religious\ntexts and theological issues.\n\nProphecy is a good example of how Ibn Rushd distinguishes himself both\nfrom the theologians and from previous philosophical approaches\n(Taylor 2018). The trustworthiness of prophecy is foundational to\nIslam: \u201cthe sending forth of prophets is based on the fact that\nrevelation comes down to them from heaven, and on this our religion is\nbased\u201d (Kashf 4.58 {142}). The Ash\u02bfarites had\nrelied primarily on miracles to establish the veracity of the Prophet\nMuhammed. Ibn Rushd evaluates this approach from his Aristotelian\nbackground. His first step is to situate the miraculous\n(mu\u02bfjiz) as a tool of persuasion belonging to the art of\nrhetoric, standing to the prophetic claim as an extrinsic argument\n(Ben Ahmed 2012). Analogously, when I swear that something is true,\nthe oath I advance has no intrinsic connection to what is claimed as\nbeing true. The Ash\u02bfarites conceive of the relation between being\nprophetic and a miracle as that of a quality to its act. The miracle\nmust be, in principle, an act that is generated from that quality,\njust as the act of healing the sick emanates from the quality of being\na physician (Kashf 5.95\u20136 {177}). Accordingly, the\nproof that I am a prophet is that I can produce an extra-ordinary act,\nsuch as walking on water, turning a stick into a snake, or splitting\nthe moon. Ibn Rushd responds by identifying a miracle as merely\n\u201can external sign\u201d of prophecy. The act that more closely\ndemonstrates prophecy is to establish a law that is useful for people.\nThus it is the Qur\u02be\u0101n that proves Muhammad\u2019s veracity:\n\u201cBecause of the universality of the teaching of the Precious\nBook and the universality of the laws contained in it\u2014by which I\nmean their liability to promote the happiness of all\nmankind\u2014this religion is common to all mankind\u201d\n(Kashf 5.103 {184}). A miracle alone, in contrast, is at best\ncomplementary, and an argument from miracles is merely persuasive or\nrhetorical. (See further Arfa Mensia 1999, Ben Ahmed 2012).\n6.2 Law\n\nThe Decisive Treatise argues forcefully that philosophy\nshould have a prominent place in religious reflection, and\nspecifically in Islamic law (shar\u012b\u02bfa). This stance,\nalongside his devotion to Aristotelian demonstration (see \u00a72),\nmight raise the question of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\n\u201crationalism\u201d: Does he regard philosophy as having some\nkind of priority in religious contexts? But this question is not Ibn\nRushd\u2019s, inasmuch as he establishes no hierarchy between\nphilosophy and true religion. The law can serve as a kind of preamble\nto philosophy, addressed to a much wider audience and containing clues\nto guide the philosopher in theoretical matters. But there is no\nquestion of priority. As he famously writes, in a passage that\n(perhaps tellingly) echoes Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics\nI.32, \u201cSince the law is true, \u2026 we, the Muslim community,\nknow firmly that demonstrative reasoning does not lead to disagreement\nwith what the law sets down. For truth does not oppose truth, but\nrather agrees with and bears witness to it\u201d (Decisive\nTreatise 12; see Taylor 2000).\n\nThe implicit target of the Decisive Treatise is\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s notorious fatwa against metaphysics. By\ncharacterizing philosophy in narrowly metaphysical terms, as a science\nthat leads from artifacts back to the Artisan through demonstrative\nmethods, Ibn Rushd means to show that God cannot be demonstrably known\nwithout these methods. To prohibit this path to knowledge from those\nwho are capable of it is an injustice both to God and to these\nscholars. In his Long Commentary on the Metaphysics (I.2\n{10}), he goes so far as to distinguish between two types of\nshar\u012b\u02bfa, one general for everyone or most people,\nand the other \u201cspecific\u201d to the philosophers. This might\nsuggest that philosophy, for those capable of it, transcends the\nteachings of Islamic law (Taylor 2012), but it is not at all clear\nthat Ibn Rushd ever commits himself to such a claim. Here in\nLongMeta, he may be speaking of shar\u012b\u02bfa\nonly loosely, as a \u201cway\u201d or \u201cmethod.\u201d And even\nif he does mean that philosophy is literally a\nshar\u012b\u02bfa, it does not follow that it is a law that\ncompetes against religion. After all, the specific stands to the\ngeneral as something that is complementary, not conflicting.\n\nTo be sure, the general shar\u012b\u02bfa of Islam is\npartially subject to the interpretation of philosophers, since they\nare the only ones who have the arsenal, namely demonstration, to bring\nout its hidden meanings, allegories, signs, and symbols. In the end,\nhowever, this serves shar\u012b\u02bfa itself, and cannot do otherwise\nsince, as Ibn Rushd never tires of declaring, Islamic Law is true and\nit calls on everyone, including philosophers, to follow its\nprescriptions (e.g., Incoherence II.4; Decisive\nTreatise 11). Philosophers pursue one path to this\ntruth\u2014the most exalted path available to human beings\u2014but\nthere are other paths, such as the rhetorical and dialectical, that\nalso arrive at this truth.\n\nFor all of Ibn Rushd\u2019s involvement in esoteric questions of\nAristotelianism, he was, at the same time, a practicing judge, deeply\nconcerned with jurisprudential theory. Ibn Rushd\u2019s principal\nwork in this domain is the Distinguished Jurist\u2019s\nPrimer, a lengthy handbook on the causes of the jurists\u2019\ndisputes and a comparison between the rationales for decision-making\nby different Sunni schools of jurisprudence. Its originality lies in\nthe rational mechanisms that Ibn Rushd employs to establish general\nrules for understanding agreements and disagreements among jurists. He\nwrites that \u201cour intention in these matters is only the rules\ngoverning the law, not an enumeration of the branches, which would\nhave no end\u201d (Jurist\u2019s Primer 26.241 {ii.202}).\nSo rather than focus on counting the differences that exist between\njurists and schools of jurisprudence, Ibn Rushd attempts to explain\nthese differences by referring them to their principles, rules, and\nthe causes that regulate them. By following the points of disagreement\nbetween the jurists and deducing the causes of this disagreement, and\nthen bringing them back to the general principles and rules equivalent\nto a general maxim rooted in his soul (Jurist\u2019s Primer\n24.179, 220\u20131 {ii.148, 184-5}), the assiduous jurist\n(al-mujtahid) becomes capable of deciding about the unknown\nsituations he will face.\n\nWhat makes these general rules so important is the imitative and\nrepetitive style of jurisprudence in Ibn Rushd\u2019s day, which had\nbeen overwhelmed by a focus on individual cases and the endless\nbranching of views. Thus, either the jurist works according to a rule\nthat distinguishes similar cases from others, or he works according to\nordinary common sense to produce controversial answers. This is what\nthe writings of the Malikites suffered from in his time. Ibn Rushd\ninsists on establishing jurisprudential maxims that make\nunderstandable the disagreement among schools of jurisprudence and\njurists and provide the diligent jurist with basic mechanism for\nmaking decisions regarding emerging problems and cases.\n7. Medicine\n\nWritings in medicine occupy an important place in Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncareer. The practice of medicine was not his profession: \u201cit is\nthis part of medicine that I believe restrains me from being perfect\nin this art. And that I haven\u2019t had much practice\u201d\n(Kulliyy\u0101t VII.517). Even so, he left many interesting\ntexts: a Commentary on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Medical\nPoem, his al-Kulliyy\u0101t (General Principles of\nMedicine), and various writings and commentaries on Galen.\nIndeed, it has been suggested that, near the end of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncareer, he was forced to set aside his philosophical project of\nwriting the long commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s texts, and turn\ninstead to Galen\u2019s text on medicine (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b\n1986a).\n\nThe commentary on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 challenges the usual conception\nof a rivalry between the two great Islamic philosophers. He says that\nhe chose to comment on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Poem\nbecause it is \u201cbetter than many of the introductions written in\nmedicine\u201d (CommIbnS\u012bn\u0101 40). Even so, during\nthe last decade of Ibn Rushd\u2019s life, it is Galen who becomes one\nof his principal authorities. Still, Galen is often a target of\ncriticism. In al-Kulliyy\u0101t, for example, a work that he\nrepeatedly revised (G\u00e4tje 1986), the revisions often move in a\ndirection that is increasingly critical of Galen\n(Kulliyy\u0101t II.162, II.184, etc.).\n\nMedicine, for Ibn Rushd, is an art rather than a science, concerned\nwith practice rather than theory (Chandelier 2019). According to the\nprologue of al-Kulliyy\u0101t,\n\nThe art of medicine is an art that acts (sin\u0101\u02bfa\nf\u0101\u02bfila) based on true principles; we seek through it to\npreserve the health of the human body and to eliminate disease as much\nas possible in each body. So the goal of this art is not to heal\nwithout fail (l\u0101 budda), but rather to act\nappropriately, to the appropriate extent and time, while waiting to\nachieve its goal, as with the art of navigation and the command of an\narmy. (prol. 127)\n\n\nThis definition is based on the famous division of the arts into what\nbelongs to the sphere of necessity and what belongs to the sphere of\npossibility. The art of medicine does not belong to the sphere where\nconsequences follow actions necessarily, as with arts like carpentry.\nIn medicine, even if the physician acts based on scientific\nprinciples, the intended end does not necessarily follow. As he puts\nit, \u201cApparently, we do not have any of the premises that bring\nus certainty in many of these pursuits. But even so we must try,\ninsofar as we are able\u201d (Kulliyy\u0101t II.208). The\npractical dimension of medicine is similarly central to his commentary\non Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, which begins with Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nstatement that \u201cMedicine is preserving health and curing\ndisease,\u201d and comments: \u201cThis is the definition of\nmedicine, and its completion would be to say that medicine is an art\nwhose action is preserving health and curing disease, based on science\nand experience\u201d (CommIbnS\u012bn\u0101 46; see also\nKulliyy\u0101t prol.131). As one may notice, Ibn Rushd\ninsists on acting in both texts.\n\nThe purpose of al-Kulliyy\u0101t, according to its prologue,\nis to draw from the art of medicine\n\na summary (jumla), sufficiently concise and brief to serve as\nan introduction for those who would like to explore the parts of the\nart, and also as a memorandum (tadhkira) for those who would\nlike to reflect on the art. We seek those statements that correspond\nto the truth, even if they contradict the opinions of people who\nbelong to the art. (prol. 127)\n\n\nHowever, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is not a book of medical\ngeneralities, as some translations tend to suggest. It is rather a\nbook on the universals of medicine (kulliyy\u0101t f\u012b\nal-\u1e6dibb), as its title suggests\u2014that is, on the\nfoundations, principles, and basic rules that regulate medical theory\nand practice. It thus provides the foundations\n(us\u1e6duqs\u0101t) of the medical art\n(Kulliyy\u0101t III.282).\n\nIn the same vein, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is far from being a\ntextbook (kunn\u0101sh); it is rather written against the\ntradition of textbooks that prevailed in the art of medicine. It is a\ndefense of the art of \u201csyllogistic\u201d medicine against\nexperiential medicine. He says: \u201cAs for those who limit\nthemselves to the method of the textbooks without knowing the\nuniversal method, they will certainly make mistakes, as do the doctors\nof our time. As for limiting oneself to universal matters, this may be\npossible if the doctor is very skilled. Therefore, one of the\nconsidered conditions of perfection in the arts is that the craftsman\nhave the power to deduce what he needs to deduce\u201d\n(Kulliyy\u0101t VII.552). The status of experience in\nmedicine is limited but not entirely excluded: \u201cOnce the\nuniversals of the art of medicine are acquired, one needs the\nexperience from which particular premises are acquired in order to be\nused in each particular case. These premises cannot be written in a\nbook, because they are unlimited\u201d (Kulliyy\u0101t\nVII.517). Ibn Rushd makes an exception, however, in criticizing the\nmanuals and textbooks on medical particulars, for Ab\u016b Marw\u0101n\nIbn Zuhr, whose al-Tays\u012br can be trusted because the\nparticulars it contains conform to the universal teachings of\ntheoretical medicine (Kulliyy\u0101t VII.583).\n\nIn sum, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is an attempt to advance medical\npractice from the level of the infinite particulars, which cannot be\nassembled in a book, to the level of the rules\n(q\u0101n\u016bn) and established principles\n(dust\u016br) that govern them (Kulliyy\u0101t\nIII.282). It is an attempt to upgrade medical discourse to the level\nof a science, linking its premises and principles to the Aristotelian\nnatural sciences (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b 1986a, 180). This holistic\nmethodology is characteristic of how Ibn Rushd approached the arts and\nsciences of his time. It shows his inclination to organize them in a\nway that protects them from chaos and elevates them to the level of\nscientific practice, established on the basis of universal principles\nand foundations. Particular cases, since they are unlimited, cannot be\ndealt with unless there are general laws that help us to deduce\ndecisions about particulars on the basis of principles and\nfoundations.\n8. Ethics and Politics\n\nThe sciences, for Ibn Rushd, fundamentally divide into the theoretical\n(na\u1e93ar\u012bya), which is aimed at knowledge\n(\u02bfilm), and the practical (\u02bfamal\u012bya),\nwhich is concerned with voluntary action (Republic I.21;\nLongPhys proem). The chief practical science is politics,\nwhich Ibn Rushd sees as dividing, much like medicine, into a more\ntheoretical and a more practical part. The first and more theoretical\npart examines voluntary actions in general, their associated\ndispositions (the virtues and vices), and the relationships between\nthese elements. The second, more practical part examines how these\ndispositions become established within souls and how they are\nperfected and impeded (Republic I.21). The first part is\nfound in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, and the second\npart in his Politics. Although Ibn Rushd composed a\ncommentary on the first of these, and although he knew the second was\navailable in Arabic elsewhere, he complains that it \u201chas not yet\nreached us on this peninsula\u201d (ParaEthics X.160G).\nAccordingly, he chose to comment on Plato\u2019s Republic as\nan alternative source for the second part of political science.\n\nFollowing the Nicomachean Ethics, Ibn Rushd takes the goal of\nhuman life to be happiness (Hourani 1962). For ordinary people, the\nultimate guide to happiness is the Qur\u02be\u0101n, which exhibits\nmiraculous wisdom in the rules it sets out to promote human\nflourishing (see \u00a76.1). But the ultimate human happiness, for\nthose who are capable of it, is to become perfect in the theoretical\nsciences (LongPhys proem). Such perfection arrives when human\nbeings conjoin themselves to the separate Agent Intellect, which is to\nsay that they pass from a partial conception of intelligible objects\nto a conception of the Agent Intellect itself. At this point a human\nbeing in some sense takes on an \u201ceternal existence\u201d\n(PossibConj 5.41; LongPhys proem), and is\n\u201cmade like unto God\u201d (LongAnima III.36 {501}),\nand even \u201cbecomes one of the eternal, incorporeal beings\u201d\n(PossibConj 5.40). This notion of conjunction\n(itti\u1e63\u0101l) had a complex history among earlier\nAristotelians, and Ibn Rushd\u2019s views about what it involves, and\nwhether it is possible, developed over time (Davidson 1992,\n321\u201356; Black 1999). The texts here are complicated, but suggest\nthat he rejected al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s complaint that\nconjunction is nothing other than \u201can old woman\u2019s\ntale\u201d (PossibConj 14.85; Epistle 1 par. 40),\nand that he accepted it as, in some sense, the goal of human life, one\nthat would be achieved through contemplation, with the assistance of\nprayer and the Qur\u02be\u0101n (PossibConj\n15.103\u20134).\n\nA perfect, conjoined grasp of the theoretical sciences carries with\nit, necessarily, the complete possession of the moral virtues. One so\npossessed will be perfect both in intellectual understanding and in\n\u201cthe activity proper to him\u201d (LongAnima III.36\n{500, 501}). If this sort of moral excellence is not much on display\nin those we see make the greatest claims to the possession of science,\nthis only testifies to the poverty of their achievements\n(LongPhys proem). The perfection Ibn Rushd describes,\nhowever, through conjunction with the Agent Intellect, seems to entail\nsomething other than personal immortality. For he expressly refuses,\nagainst al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, to endorse bodily resurrection\n(Incoherence II.4 {580\u20136}), and yet he also insists\nthat the human soul is individuated in virtue of its body. So, as he\nexplicitly concludes, \u201cif the soul does not die when the body\ndies, or if there is anything of this kind within the soul, then it\nmust, once it has left the bodies, be one in number\u201d\n(Incoherence I.1 {29}). So\u2014although scholarship is not\nunanimous on this point\u2014it seems that Ibn Rushd, whatever he\nmight have thought about conjunction, did not mean for the promise of\nthe soul\u2019s immortality to extend to each of us as\nindividuals (Taylor 1998).\n\nJust as the theoretical part of medicine has as its aim the more\npractical business of preserving health and curing disease, so too, in\nthe political sphere, the first part has as its end the perfection of\nthe second part. This is to say that the goal of ethical inquiry is\nultimately \u201cthe governance of cities\u201d (ParaEthics\nI.3, 3F). This instrumental conception of ethics looks strange from\nthe perspective of later European philosophy, but it is what Aristotle\nhimself expressly affirms at Nicomachean Ethics I.2, and it\ncomports well with Ibn Rushd\u2019s orientation away from individual\nhuman beings as the ultimate locus of value in the universe.\n\nFrom the start, Ibn Rushd announces that the goal of his commentary on\nthe Republic will be to strip away the parts that are merely\ndialectical, so as to identify the claims that achieve the level of\ndemonstrative science (Republic I.21). Accordingly, he\nattends very selectively to the ten books that comprise Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, dispensing entirely with the first and tenth books\nand the first half of the second book, and merging the rest into three\nbooks. The first presents political science and reflects on the\ncomponents of the virtuous city, especially the guards. The second\nconsiders virtuous governments and the qualities of the ruler of the\nvirtuous city and the philosopher. The third is devoted to\nnon-virtuous governments, comparisons between them, and the transition\nfrom one to another.\n\nThe Platonic text is subjected to two parallel frameworks. The first\nis Aristotelian, both in its overarching theoretical\nframework\u2014replacing the dialectical and dialogical character of\nthe Platonic text with Aristotle\u2019s ethical and logical framework\n(Butterworth 1986)\u2014and in its particular details, as when Ibn\nRushd emphasizes the role of logic rather than mathematics in the\ntraining of the guards and the ruler of the virtuous city\n(Republic II.76\u20137). The second is the contextualization\nof this text in the Islamic and Andalusian environment. Ibn Rushd\ntakes the Umayyad, Almoravid, and Almohad dynasties as examples of\nmany of the issues he deals with in the text, and harshly criticizes\nthe current Almohad reign (e.g., Republic III.103) as well as\nthe position of the philosopher at the time, which he compares to\nbeing surrounded by ferocious monsters (Republic II.64). This\ncritical attitude is particularly notable when he discusses how women,\nsharing the same natures as men, are suited to the same activities,\nfit to serve as guardians, philosophers, and rulers. Yet, as things\nare, these capacities are not fostered: \u201csince women in these\ncities are not prepared with respect to any of the human virtues, they\nfrequently resemble plants. Their being a burden upon the men in these\ncities is one of the causes of poverty\u201d (Republic\nI.54).\n\nIt is clear that Ibn Rushd comments on the Republic only for\nlack of Aristotle\u2019s superior work. At the end of his paraphrase\non the Nicomachean Ethics, he describes the shortcomings in\nPlato\u2019s treatise, and criticizes Ibn B\u0101jja for having\njudged the Republic as the perfect treatise on the virtuous\ncity. What is less clear is exactly what Ibn Rushd\u2019s own textual\nsources were. Did he deal directly with Plato\u2019s text, with the\nassistance of Galen, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, and Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric? Or was the Platonic text not in his hands, which\nmeans that he was commenting on Galen\u2019s Compendium on\nPlato\u2019s Politics, with the help of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nand Aristotle? While the use of Aristotle\u2019s and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s texts is clear, the question of his\naccess to Plato remains obscure (Mahdi 2016).\n9. Reception\n\nOur focus has been Ibn Rushd. But in studying this subject one cannot\nhelp but notice the strange way in which modern scholarship has\nconcerned itself more with the later reception of his ideas than\naround Ibn Rushd himself. Here we briefly consider the reception of\nhis thought in Muslim, Jewish, and Christian contexts.\n9.1 Arabic\n\nIbn Rushd is often described as a philosopher who failed to attract\nthe attention of his first audience, resulting in the death of his\nphilosophy at the hands of its intended Islamic readers, a state of\naffairs that is said to have continued until its revival in the\nideological debates of the Arab Renaissance (nah\u1e0da)\n(K\u00fcgelgen 1994, al-J\u0101bir\u012b 1998). To be sure, Ibn\nRushd\u2019s influence in Muslim contexts cannot compare to the\noverwhelming influence of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, nor even to Ibn\nRushd\u2019s own influence in Europe. Still, the commonly heard claim\nthat he had no influence on Islamic thought is false.\n\nFirst, recent scholarship has shown that Ibn Rushd had successors. Ben\nShar\u012bfa (1999) identifies 39 direct disciples of Ibn Rushd, most\nof whom were faithful, and some of whom continued his work in\nphilosophy and related sciences.\n\nSecond, after Ibn Rushd\u2019s death, his works were hardly ignored\nby the leading scholars in Andalusia and Morocco. Theologians,\nmathematicians, suf\u012bs, historians, physicians, philosophers and\nliterary figures used Ibn Rushd\u2019s works extensively. In medicine\nand logic, his influence on Ibn \u1e6cuml\u016bs has recently become\napparent (Ibn \u1e6cuml\u016bs 2020; Ben Ahmed 2016, 2017, 2019c,\n2020a). His influence also extended to Ash\u02bfarite theology, as\nwhen Ab\u016b al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j Y\u016bsuf al-Mikl\u0101t\u012b\nquoted Ibn Rushd\u2019s epitome on the Metaphysics and the\nIncoherence of the Incoherence to refute the philosophers\n(\u1e24amd\u0101n 2005). The same can be said of certain Maghrebi\nmathematicians who benefited from the conceptual arsenal provided by\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophical writings. In this context, one can\ncite the example of Ibn Hayd\u016br al-T\u0101dil\u012b, who put\nforward the concept of \u201cthe one\u201d (al-w\u0101hid)\nas crystallized by Ibn Rushd (Ibn Hayd\u016br 2018). Ibn\n\u1e6cuml\u016bs, al-Mikl\u0101ti, Ibn \u02bfAm\u012bra\nal-Makhz\u016bm\u012b, and Ibn Hayd\u016br, among others, appropriate\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophical analysis without naming him, whereas\nIbn Sab\u02bf\u012bn on occasion uses Ibn Rushd\u2019s writings\nwithout name even while in other places he criticizes him by\nname\u2014thus complicating the task of identifying the texts used.\nSome of these texts, in particular in jurisprudence and religion, were\npart of the curriculum in Andalusia until its fall (Ben Shar\u012bfa\n1999; Akasoy 2008; Ben Ahmed 2019b). Indeed, in Muslim contexts, some\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s works have been in constant use from the\nlatter\u2019s lifetime until today. They formed part of the training\nof scholars such as Ibn al-Tilims\u0101n\u012b and Ibn Khald\u016bn,\nas well as part of the curriculum of important teachers such as\nAb\u016b \u02bfAbd al-L\u0101h al-\u0100bil\u012b (Ibn\nal-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb 1975, iii: 507; Ibn Khald\u016bn 2004).\n\nThird, evidence has emerged that some of Ibn Rushd\u2019s books were\ntransmitted east, to Egypt and the Levant, and used by philosophers\nand scholars there. In addition to copies of the Kashf and\nthe Incoherence found in Turkey, Egypt, and India, and the\ntestimony of\n Maimonides,\n who from Egypt was able to acquire most of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncommentaries (Davidson 2005, 108\u201310), we can identify the spread\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s ideas among some philosophers, as is the case\nwith the theory of the unity of truth adopted by\n Abd al-Lat\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\n (Ben Ahmed 2019a). Moreover, some of Ibn Rushd\u2019s philosophical\nand metaphysical positions concerning causality and location were\nadopted by thinkers who were generally regarded as enemies of\nphilosophical and rational thought, as is the case with Ibn Taymiyya,\nwho made extensive and explicit use of Ibn Rushd\u2019s texts and\nadopted some of his positions in his crystallization of his conception\nof the history of philosophy and kal\u0101m (Ben Ahmed 2019b,\n2020b, 2020d; Hoover 2018).\n\nFourth, we now also have evidence that Ibn Rushd\u2019s texts reached\nIran in the sixteenth century and became widely known to scholars in\nthe seventeenth century. The catalogues indicate that dozens of them\nwere transcribed during this time. The large number of copies reflects\nanother phenomenon that we should not continue to ignore: the demand\nfor the teaching of these books and their use by students and teachers\nin madrasas in Safavid Iran. Some thinkers and philosophers used them\nin their debates and teaching. Suffice it to mention here Abd\nal-Razz\u0101q al-L\u0101h\u012bj\u012b, Mullah Rajab \u02bfAl\u012b\nTabr\u012bz\u012b, and Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e6c\u0101hir\nWa\u1e25\u012bd al-Zam\u0101n Qazw\u012bn\u012b (Endress 1999, 2001,\n2006; Pourjavady and Schmidtke, 2015; Ben Ahmed forthcoming).\n9.2 Hebrew\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophy quickly found a second home in Judaism,\nwhere it became so prominent as even to supplant Aristotle as the\nparamount authority in philosophy and science (Harvey 2000). The first\nand critical event was Maimonides\u2019 acquisition of Ibn\nRushd\u2019s commentaries, perhaps around 1190. His subsequent praise\nof this work precipitated a four-century fascination with Ibn Rushd\namong Jewish philosophers (Harvey 1992), especially focusing on his\ncommentaries but even extending to some of his religious\ntreatises.\n\nAs Jewish authors began to write increasingly in Hebrew, Ibn\nRushd\u2019s texts followed, thanks to a series of Arabic-to-Hebrew\ntranslations from 1230 onward (see Zonta 2010 and, in more detail,\nTamani and Zonta 1997, 31\u201349). By 1340, virtually all of the\ncommentaries were available in Hebrew, even while very little of\nAristotle himself was translated. In parallel with this process,\nJewish authors began to write commentaries on Ibn Rushd, giving rise\nto a extensive series of \u201csupercommentaries\u201d (Glasner\n2011). The leading example of this phenomenon is\n Gersonides\u2019\n series of supercommentaries on Ibn Rushd in the 1320s (Glasner\n1995).\n\nThe extent to which Ibn Rushd took precedence over other sources of\nAristotelianism is quite startling. A typical example is Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera, whose introduction to his thirteenth-century encyclopedia\nclarifies that \u201call that I write are the words of Aristotle as\nexplained in the commentaries of the scholar Averroes, for he was the\nlast of the commentators and he incorporated what was best from the\n[earlier] commentaries\u201d (in\n Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera \u00a74).\n Each of the various types of Rushdian commentary had their champions\nat different times. Here is the advice of Moses Almosnino from the\nsixteenth-century: \u201cdo not squander your time with the epitomes\nand middle commentaries of Averroes, but read only the long\ncommentaries, for if you read the long commentaries carefully you will\nhave no need to read any other book in order to understand anything of\nnatural science\u201d (in Harvey 1985, 61).\n\nOther important figures from the thirteenth century are\n Isaac Albalag\n and\n Isaac Polqar.\n Prominent fourteenth-century figures are Gersonides and Moses Narboni\n(see Hayoun 2005), whose commentary on Ibn Rushd\u2019s theory of\nconjunction has been translated into English along with Ibn\nRushd\u2019s epistle. Prominent names from the fifteenth century\ninclude Abraham Bibago and\n Elijah Del Medigo\n (see Hayoun 2005). Sixteenth-century figures such Abraham de Balmes\nattempt more accurate Latin translations of Ibn Rushd, drawing on\nearlier Arabic-to-Hebrew translations (Ivry 1983, Hasse 2016).\n\nSee also the entries on the\n influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on Judaic thought\n and the\n influence of Islamic thought on Maimonides.\n9.3 Latin\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s influence on Christian Europe, from the early\nthirteenth-century through the Renaissance, was massive, and has been\nextensively studied. Translations from Arabic into Latin began with\nMichael Scott, around 1220, and by the middle of the century most of\nthe Aristotelian commentaries had been translated (Burnett 2010,\n820\u201321; Hasse 2016, 341\u201357). Almost immediately after the\nwork of translation began his ideas grew in influence (Gauthier 1982),\nand already by the 1230s he is known as \u201cthe Commentator.\u201d\nConcerns quickly arose, however, over certain contentious claims, and\nby the 1260s the term \u2018Averroist\u2019 was used in a pejorative\nsense, particularly with regard to the unicity of the intellect\n(Kuksewicz 1968; see \u00a75 above), the eternity of the world (Dales\n1990; see \u00a74), and the threat of determinism (Martin 2015, see\n\u00a76.1). Even usually temperate authors such as Thomas Aquinas\nroused themselves to heated invective in considering these doctrines,\nand in 1270, and again in\n 1277,\n lists of condemned propositions were directed at the arts faculty at\nthe University of Paris, many concerning views associated with Ibn\nRushd (Brenet 2015; Wippel 1995).\n\nThe situation was, however, more complex than a simple opposition\nbetween the \u201cAverroists\u201d and their opponents. At a\nminimum, the field divides into three groups. First are those whose\nenthusiasm for a Rushdian reading of Aristotle leads them take boldly\nheterodox views in tension with Christianity. Leading figures here are\nSiger of Brabant,\n Boethius of Dacia,\n and John of Jandun (Brenet 2003). Even in this case there are doubts,\nhowever, regarding whether Ibn Rushd is the prime impetus behind their\nviews; Van Steenberghen (1980) prefers the label \u201cradical\nAristotelianism.\u201d Second are those at the opposite extreme,\nopposing not only Ibn Rushd\u2019s most radical ideas but even\nAristotelianism itself, as when Peter John Olivi complains of\nAristotle that \u201cwithout reason he is believed, as the god of\nthis age\u201d\n (Peter John Olivi \u00a73).\n Bonaventure becomes a leading figure in this movement (Mahoney 1988).\nThird are the great majority of philosophers in between, including\nThomas Aquinas and other leading figures of the age, who reject Ibn\nRushd\u2019s readings of Aristotle when they conflict with Church\nauthority, even while in most matters they continue to rely on\n\u201cthe Commentator.\u201d Thus a papal decree from 1341 calls on\nthe arts faculty at Paris to follow \u201cthe science of Aristotle\nand his commentator Averroes, and other ancient commentators and\ninterpreters of Aristotle, except in cases that run counter to the\nfaith\u201d (in Putallaz 2010, 111).\n\nWhere that third group agrees most fundamentally with Ibn Rushd is in\nthe conviction that the way forward in philosophy, at least in\ngeneral, is to adhere faithfully to the mind of Aristotle (\u00a71.2\nabove). Here Ibn Rushd looms particularly large over the history of\nEuropean philosophy, all the way through the Renaissance (Akasoy and\nGiglioni 2010, Hasse 2016). During these later years his name\ncontinues to be divisive: large numbers of theologians make common\ncause with the new breed of humanists against a persistent line of\n\u201cAverroists\u201d who continue to defend even Ibn Rushd\u2019s\nmost notorious doctrines. The most controversial figures are now\nItalian, and often associated with the University of Padua, such as\n Paul of Venice,\n Pietro Pomponazzi, Agostino Nifo, and\n Giacomo Zabarella.\n Yet even while fierce debate endures over the unity of the intellect\nand other such causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, the general run\nof scholars and students continues, page by page, to rely on Ibn Rushd\nas the paramount guide to Aristotle. New editions, new\nsupercommentaries, and even whole new translations appear until nearly\nthe end of the sixteenth century, most famously the Junta editions of\nAristotle with Ibn Rushd\u2019s commentaries, from 1552 and again\n1562, which remain in use to this day.\n\nWhere Ibn Rushd\u2019s influence is perhaps even more important, but\nless easy to pin down, concerns the relationship between philosophy\nand religion (Klima 1998, Marenbon 2007, Normore 1995). The most\ndistinctive feature of the \u201cAverroists\u201d is their\ninclination to pursue philosophical arguments to their logical\nconclusion, regardless of Church doctrine. To be sure, this has close\naffinities with Ibn Rushd\u2019s insistence that philosophy should\ninform religious study (see \u00a76.2), but in the censorious context\nof premodern Christianity such an approach was especially perilous.\nFigures like Siger of Brabant would stake out boldly heterodox-looking\nclaims, only to backtrack and insist that they were merely describing\nwhat pure philosophical reason would show, not defending these views\nas true. Often they would later disavow even their earlier strictly\nphilosophical claims. The autonomy of reason, against the claims of\nreligion, was not a principle that could be easily defended at this\ntime.\n\nFor further information see the entry on the\n influence of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on the Latin West.\n A particularly valuable collection of papers is found in\nNiew\u00f6hner and Sturlese (1994).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
