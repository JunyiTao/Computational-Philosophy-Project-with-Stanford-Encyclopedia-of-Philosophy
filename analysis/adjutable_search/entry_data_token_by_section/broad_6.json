    "main_text": "Perception || The Theory of Representative Perception\n2.5 The Theory of Representative Perception\n\nThe position Broad reaches is the following. A perceptual experience\nhas a certain intentional content. It differs from thought- and\nbelief-episodes by including a sensory phase, and it is primarily this\nthat is responsible for the distinctive phenomenology of perception.\nThe sensory phase consists of sensations. These decompose into acts of\nsensing and object sensed, sensa. A sensum has the phenomenal\nproperties that the perceived object (sensibly) appears to\nhave\u2014red or warm or squeaky. An act of sensing a sensum\nconstitutes an immediate acquainting awareness of the sensum in\nquestion. Although our perceptual experiences seem to grant\nus an acquaintance with the facing surfaces of material objects, sensa\nare the only items we are acquainted with.\n\nThe intentional content\u2014the external reference\u2014of a\nperceptual experience is in a certain sense based upon sensa\n(thought not in the sense that there is a train of swift\ninference leading from the presence of a sensum to the mind to a\ncertain perceptual belief). (1923, pp. 246\u20137.) It is this\ncontent which represents the environment as featuring a physical\nobject so-and-so. Sensa are clearly incapable of carrying such\ncontent. Furthermore, from the very nature of the case the general\nnotion of physical object \u201ccannot have been derived by\nabstraction from observed instances of it, as the notion of\n\u2018red\u2019 no doubt has\n been.\u201d[9]\n In fact, general concept of a physical object \u201cis not\n\u2018got out of\u2019 experience until it has been \u2018put\ninto\u2019 experience. It is best described as an innate principle of\ninterpretation which we apply to the data of sense-perception\u201d\n(1925, p. 217).\n",
