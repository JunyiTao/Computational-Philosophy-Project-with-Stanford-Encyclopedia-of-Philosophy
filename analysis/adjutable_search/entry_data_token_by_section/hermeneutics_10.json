    "main_text": "Hermeneutics and Existence || Difficulties of Self-Interpretation\n3.2 Difficulties of Self-Interpretation\n\nHeidegger maintains that such self-interpretation of existence is\nfraught with difficulties. One reason, he believes, is that structures\nof being in the world are made inconspicuous by the very involvement\nin the world that they enable. He famously makes this case in the\ncourse of his phenomenological considerations of the way we find human\nexistence \u201cinitially and for the most part,\u201d namely, in\nthe undifferentiated \u201caverageness\u201d of everyday existence\n(Heidegger, Being and Time, 43; \u00a7 20). In this\naverageness of everyday existence, Heidegger argues, the structure of\nthe world is given through the purposes we have, the referential\nrelations that comprise the situations in which we attempt to realize\nthese ends, and the things we employ in the service of these ends. In\nthe averageness of everyday existence, our access to this structure is\ngranted not through reflection on it but, instead, through our\nordinary affairs, as we cognize the structure indirectly through the\nthings (Zeuge, useful things or tools) that we employ to\ncarry out our projects (Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7\u00a7 14\u201318; see also Heidegger, Ontology,\n\u00a7 20). Yet, as he argues, in this form of cognizance,\n\u201ccircumspection\u201d (Umsicht), the structure of the\nworld itself recedes from view precisely by our absorption in those\nprojects (Heidegger, Being and Time, 69).\n\nHeidegger maintains that the self-interpretation of existence is made\ndifficult, moreover, because being in the world always also entails\nbeing with others. In this, Heidegger argues that in the averageness\nof everyday existence, we tend to interpret ourselves not by what\ndifferentiates us from others, but, instead, by what can be attributed\nindifferently to anyone. Such interpretations may be attractive\nbecause accessible to anyone, but they come at the price of being\ndistorting and reductive. In the averageness of everyday existence,\nthe sense of self that comes into focus through self-interpretation is\nnot a self in its singular possibilities to be. It is rather a sense\nof self characterized by circumscribed possibilities, which, for\nHeidegger, finds expression in the pronoun \u2018they,\u2019 or\n\u2018one\u2019 (das Man)\u2014so that we interpret our own possibilities\nrestrictively in terms of what \u2018one\u2019 thinks, what\n\u2018one\u2019 does, and no more (see Heidegger Being and\nTime, \u00a7 27; see also Heidegger, Ontology, \u00a7\n6).\n\nAnother, related difficulty of self-interpretation concerns the\nhistorical transmission of interpretations. In this, Heidegger\nmaintains that, as interpretations of existence are passed down from\ntradition, the \u201coriginal sources\u201d of concrete, existential\nconcern, come to be covered over (Heidegger, Ontology, 59).\nIndeed, for this reason, Heidegger calls for a\n\u201cdestruction\u201d or, perhaps, \u2018de-structuration\u2019\n(Destruktion) of interpretations of being and the being of\nexistence that have been passed down from the history of Western\nphilosophy (see Heidegger, Being and Time, \u00a76).\nThis, to be sure, is a call that has important implications for the\nstudy of the history of philosophy, one that has been influential for\nphilosophers such as Jacques Derrida, John Sallis, and Claudia\nBaracchi.\n",
