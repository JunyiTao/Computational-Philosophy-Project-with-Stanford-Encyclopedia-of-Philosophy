    "main_text": "Contemporary Approaches and Debates || Care, Vulnerability, Affect\n2.5 Care, Vulnerability, Affect\n\nMany of the recent developments in feminist political philosophy have\nfollowed on the heels of feminist critiques or reinterpretations of\nthe Western philosophical canon. Earlier works by Wendy Brown (1988),\nAlison Jaggar (1989), Genevieve Lloyd (1984 [1993]), Susan Moller Okin\n(1979, 1989), Carole Pateman (1988, 1989), and others, revealed the\nmasculinist foundations of mainstream political theory. As Okin put\nit,\n\n\n[It] has proved to be no simple matter to integrate women into a\ntradition of theorizing created by, for, and about men. (Okin 1998:\n118)\n\n\nAs she goes on to say,\n\n\nGreat value has been placed on things traditionally associated with\nmen\u2014on the allegedly transcendent nonphysical realm, on\nexcessive individualism, on reason as all-important, and on the\nso-called manly virtues\u2014including competitiveness and\naggression. At the same time, the realm of things traditionally\nassociated with women\u2014concern with physical needs and\nnurturance, emotionality, cooperation (with other people and with\nnature)\u2014have been much more inclined to be denigrated. (Okin\n1998: 119)\n\n\nRather than attempting to align their theories with those values of\nindividualism, rationality, and abstraction associated with\nmasculinity (and classical liberalism), many feminist thinkers have\ninstead sought to revalue traditionally denigrated values associated\nwith femininity.\n\nA prime example is care ethics (see the discussion in the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n Drawing on Carol Gilligan\u2019s pathbreaking research in moral\npsychology (Gilligan 1982), which showed that the dominant conception\nof moral development and subjectivity was really a reflection of a\nparticular, masculine style of moral reasoning, feminist political\ntheorists challenged dominant conceptions of political\nsubjectivity, judgment, and action. Just as Gilligan and other\nfeminist ethicists emphasized that styles of moral reasoning\nassociated with women were not inferior because of their\ndistinctiveness from masculinist models\u2014and that distinctiveness\nincludes an emphasis on emotions like empathy and care, responsiveness\nto need, and an awareness of one\u2019s connection with others and\nthe natural world\u2014feminist political philosophers argued that\nways of looking at and organizing the world informed by care are not\ninferior or pathological. This spurred new approaches to theorizing\nfoundational political concepts that are at odds with liberal\npolitical theory in particular. First and foremost, political\ntheorists influenced by the care ethics tradition insist that\npolitical subjects are not independent, but fundamentally\n(inter)dependent, enmeshed in complex networks of relation\nnecessary for survival. This means that as political agents, we do not\nact on our own, but rely on others who are themselves dependent. This\ntransformed view of the self has both theoretical and practical\nimplications. From a care perspective, agency is relational, and\nindividuals are nonsovereign and heteronomous. Taking up insights\nabout our varied proximity to states of dependency throughout the\ncourse of life arising in the field of disability studies, thinkers\nlike Judith Butler have argued that vulnerability is both an enabling\nand constraining feature of our ontological condition and one that is\noften politically induced in particular populations, marking them as\n\u201cprecarious\u201d (Butler 2004, 2015). In her 2017 book The\nRight to Maim, Jasbir Puar draws on similar theoretical\napproaches in disability studies and biopolitics to analyze and\ncritique the ways that the liberal nation-state\n\u201cdebilitates\u201d populations in order to discipline and\ncontrol them (Puar 2017). This recent work marks an interest among\nfeminist political theorists in exposing the myriad ways that\ncontemporary liberal and neoliberal frameworks care-lessly intensify\nand/or manipulate vulnerability. Along with disability, these thinkers\nseek to expose the ways that gender, race, ethnicity, immigration\nstatus, and age are complexly enmeshed in these scenes of abandonment\n(see also Fineman 2008 [2011]; Fraser 2022; Povinelli 2011; Collins\n1990 [2000]). From a policy standpoint, care has also been front and\ncenter for feminist political thinkers, especially in the wake of the\nCOVID-19 global pandemic, which exposed the radical insufficiency of\nour infrastructures of care. The authors of The Care\nManifesto (known as \u201cThe Care Collective\u201d, 2020)\nexplore how we might reorganize our institutions and relationships to\nmeet the moment, including reclaiming public spaces, making healthcare\nfor all a reality, and taking action to protect the natural world.\n\nSome of the foundations and consequences of the care ethics approach\nhave also produced serious skepticism from feminist political\nphilosophers. First, there is the question of whether and, if so, how\nwomen-as-care-givers have distinct virtues. Feminists as a whole have\nlong distanced themselves from the idea that women have any particular\nessence, choosing instead to see femininity and its accompanying\nvirtues as social constructs, dispositions that result from culture\nand conditioning, not biological givens. So for care ethicists to\nchampion the virtues that have inculcated femininity seems also to\nchampion a patriarchal system that relegates one gender to the role of\ncaretaker. The care ethicists\u2019 answer to this problem has often\nbeen to flip the hierarchy. That is, to claim that the work of the\nhousehold is more meaningful and sustaining than the work of the\npolis. But critics, such as Drucilla Cornell, Mary Dietz, and Chantal\nMouffe, argue that such a revaluation keeps intact the dichotomy\nbetween the private and the public and the old association of\nwomen\u2019s work with childcare (Butler & Scott [eds.] 1992;\nPhillips [ed.] 1998: 386\u2013389).\n\nFeminist political theorists associated with the care tradition have\nexplored how the distinct values that arise from practices of care\nmight transform our political concepts, aims, and organizations. How\nmight those activities and values typically relegated to the private\nrealm provide an alternative to the traditional emphases in moral and\npolitical philosophy on impartiality, rationality, and universal\nprinciples of justice in the public realm? The care approach\nchallenged the default to abstract principles in political philosophy,\nleading to intense debates between liberals who advocated universal\nideals of justice and care ethicists who advocated attention to the\nparticular, to relationships, to care. In Gilligan\u2019s early work,\nfor instance, the care approach is presented as opposed to\nwhat she terms \u201cthe justice approach\u201d, giving the\nimpression that the two approaches are separate and mutually exclusive\nstyles of moral reasoning (Gilligan 1982). By the 1990s, however, many\ncare ethicists had revised their views. Rather than seeing care and\njustice as mutually exclusive alternatives, they began to recognize\nthat attention to care should be accompanied by attention to fairness\n(justice) in order to attend to the plight of those with whom we have\nno immediate relation (Koggel 1998). Moreover, they recognized that\nthe need to evaluate existing practices or systems of care requires\napplying principles of justice like equality and fairness (Held [ed.]\n1995; Kittay 2002; Schutte 2002).\n\nLike care, the history of Western philosophy has largely disregarded\nthe role of emotion in political life, in particular because\nemotionality is frequently associated with women and racialized\nothers. However, feminist political philosophers have insisted on the\nimportance of this intersection (for example Hall 2005, Krause 2008,\nand Nussbaum 2013). Building on the contributions of feminist care\nethicists and difference feminists who worked to show the significance\nof positive affects typically associated with femininity in ethical\nencounters\u2014such as love, interest, and care\u2014(see Held\n[ed.] 1995; Tronto 1993), other thinkers worried that this appraisal\nmerely reified a false (gendered) dichotomy between reason and\nemotion, mind and body. Instead, early work by Alison Jaggar (1989),\nElizabeth Spelman (1989 and 1991), Genevieve Lloyd (1984 [1993]),\nElizabeth Grosz (1994), and others argued that reason is both embodied\nand emotion-laden, and that emotion has epistemic and moral value.\nBuilding on this work, feminist political theorists have argued that\nunderstanding the role of emotion and affect is crucial for\nunderstanding a number of important political phenomena: motivation\nfor action (Krause 2008), collective action and community formation\n(Beltr\u00e1n 2009 & 2010; Butler 2004 & 2015), solidarity\nand patriotism (Nussbaum 2006 and 2013), as well as vulnerability\n(Fineman 2008 [2011]), racism and xenophobia (Ahmed 2004 [2014]; Anker\n2014; Ioanide 2015). Meanwhile, others examine the political\nsignificance of specific emotions, for instance: shame (Ahmed 2004\n[2014]), grief (Butler 2004), anger (Cherry 2021; Spelman 1989; Lorde\n1984), fear (Anker 2014), empathy (Hirji 2022), and love (Nussbaum\n2013).\n\nMore recently, many feminist critics have turned their attention to\nthe ways that neoliberalism demands resiliency and self-reliance in\nthe face of increasing precarity. Some borrow from Michel\nFoucault\u2019s late work on biopolitics, examining how neoliberal\ndemands for autonomy, self-sufficiency, self-discipline, and\nself-investment impact individuals on the level of subjectivity,\nmaking both life and the possibility of political action to transform\nthe conditions of life increasingly untenable. Individuals, they\nargue, are met with increasing vulnerability to economic forces and\nfewer resources to overcome vulnerability due to social isolation and\nlimited access to social services (Butler 2015; Povinelli 2011). Some\nfeminists study how subjectivity, affect, and morality accommodate\nthese neoliberal trends. For instance, this shows up in how the demand\nto \u201covercome vulnerability\u201d via the contemporary emphasis\non individual \u201cresilience\u201d attempts to transform\nvulnerable persons, especially women, into productive neoliberal\nsubjects (James 2015), how productive emotions like\n\u201chappiness\u201d are encouraged and unruly ones like\n\u201cwillfulness\u201d are discouraged (Berlant 2011; Ahmed 2014),\nor how the targeted discourse around \u201cself-care\u201d can\ncontribute to individualist consumer culture that diminishes\nwomen\u2019s capacities for collective action (Ahmed 2017). Instead,\nmany feminist critiques challenge neoliberal individualism by\nreasserting that agency need not be synonymous with autonomy, and\npropose nonsovereign or relational accounts of the agentic subject\ninstead (Butler 2015). Along with care, some theorists have turned to\ncontemplative practices like meditation (in the Zen Buddhist\ntradition, for instance) to recover important resources for democratic\nlife (Mariotti 2020).\n",
