    "main_text": "Developments in England || Hobbes\n4.1 Hobbes\n\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, we find Hobbes giving the\ntraditional definition of consciousness:\n\n\nWhen two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to\nbe CONSCIOUS of it one to another; which is as much as to know it\ntogether. And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one\nanother, or of a third; it was, and ever will be reputed a very evil\nact, for any man to speak against his conscience; or to\ncorrupt or force another to do so\u2026. Afterwards, men made use of\nthe same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own secret\nfacts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is rhetorically said,\nthat the conscience is a thousand witnesses. (Leviathan\n7.4)\n\n\nThe etymological sense of consciousness of shared knowledge\nis preserved here and connected with the function of conscience as a\nwitness. Indeed, it is important to Hobbes to preserve this public\nsense of consciousness/conscience, since he viewed the private\njudgments of conscience to be \u201crepugnant to civil society\u201d\n(Leviathan 29.7).\n\nAnd yet, quite apart from the term consciousness, it seems that Hobbes\nhas an account of phenomenal awareness:\n\n\n[I]f the appearances be the principles by which we know all other\nthings, we must needs acknowledge sense to be the principle by which\nwe know those principles, and that all the knowledge we have is\nderived from it. And as for the causes of sense, we cannot begin our\nsearch of them from any other phenomenon than that of sense itself.\nBut you will say, by what sense shall we take notice of sense? I\nanswer, by sense itself, namely, by the memory which for some time\nremains in us of things sensible, though they themselves pass away.\nFor he that perceives that he hath perceived, remembers. (De\nCorpore 25.1, p. 389; for some discussion of this text, see Frost\n2005)\n\n\nWe must be cautious about attributing a theory of consciousness (in\nthe modern day sense) to Hobbes here. In particular, we should be\ncautious of what is meant by sensing that we have sensed, since\nsensation is itself an appearance, which, presumably, one\nwould be aware of. But these appearances are connected together into a\nsingle experience by memory. As Hobbes says in Leviathan,\n\u201cmuch memory, or memory of many things, is called\nexperience\u201d (2.4). But phenomenal awareness seems to be\na property of sensation itself, for Hobbes. Hobbes resists the\nimplication of a higher-order account of consciousness in his\nobjections to Descartes\u2019s Mediations (cf. CSM II,\n122\u2013123 / AT VII 173; for discussion of the relation of Hobbes\nand Descartes on the topic of consciousness, see Ross 1988).\n",
