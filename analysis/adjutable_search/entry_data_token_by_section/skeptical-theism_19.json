    "main_text": "Moral Objections || All-things-considered Value\n6.2 All-things-considered Value\n\nSome have objected that skeptical theism is committed to\nall-things-considered value skepticism (Jordan 2006, Hasker\n2010, Ekstrom 2021: ch. 4). Crudely put, the all-things-considered\nvalue of something\u2014a state of affairs, action, attitude,\netc.\u2014is the overall value or disvalue of it and all of its\nconsequences. Some have argued that if skeptical theism is true, then\nit is frequently not reasonable to make all-things-considered value\njudgements about specific things, that is, specific states of affairs,\nactions, attitudes, etc. Given skeptical theism, we are frequently\nreasonable in judging that some specific thing is on its own valuable\nor disvaluable, good or bad. But, the objection goes, we are not\nreasonable in judging that things have all-things-considered value.\nAgain, this objection might be extended to cases of obligations, since\nbeing unable to make reasonable all-things-considered value judgments\nmay also undermine knowledge of our obligations (see next\nsection).\n\nIn response, some skeptical theists concede their position undermines\ncertain ways of arriving at all-things-considered value judgments (cf.\nBergmann 2009: 379\u201380, 389; 2012: 25\u20136). Specifically,\njust as skeptical theistic claims undermine Rowe\u2019s nosseum\ninferences, so too they will undermine nosseum inferences that certain\nthings are all-things-considered valuable or disvaluable. But\nskeptical theists might also maintain that this all-things-considered\nvalue skepticism is unproblematic. One reason why it might be\nunproblematic is that there are reasons for accepting\nall-things-considered value skepticism independently of skeptical\ntheism. For instance, no one knows all of the causal consequences of\ntheir action. Thus, no one knows all of the valuable or disvaluable\nconsequences of their actions. Thus, no one knows the\nall-things-considered value of their actions. This line of reasoning\nsupports all-things-considered value skepticism, but does not assume\nthat skeptical theistic critiques are successful.\n",
