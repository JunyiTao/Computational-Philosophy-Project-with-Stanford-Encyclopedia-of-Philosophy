    "main_text": "Socrates vs. Callicles\n6. Conclusion: Thrasymachus, Callicles, Glaucon, Antiphon\n\nOne way to compare the two varieties of immoralism represented by\nThrasymachus and Callicles is to ask why Plato chose to represent the\nformer position in the Republic and the latter in the\nGorgias. The obvious answer is that the differences between\nthe two put them in very different relations to Socrates and his\ndefense of justice, suitably calibrated to the ambitions of the works\nin question. Socrates and Callicles are antitheses: they address the\nsame questions and give directly conflicting answers. Each offers a\npositive account of the real nature of justice, grounded in a broader\nconception of human nature and the nature of things. Indeed, viewed at\na high level of abstraction, and if we allow Socrates the fuller\npositive theory provided in the Republic, their positions are\nremarkably similar. For in the Republic we see that Plato in\nfact agrees with Callicles that the many should be ruled by the\nsuperior few\u2014i.e., the intelligent and courageous\u2014and\nthat it is only natural and just for the latter to have greater\nhappiness and pleasure than the many. Where they differ is in the\ncontent they give to this shared schema. From the point of view of\nSocrates or Plato, Callicles is wrong about nature (including human\nnature); wrong about what intelligence and virtue actually consist in;\nwrong about what the point and purpose of political rule is; and wrong\nabout the nature of the good at which the superior man aims. His\nversion of the immoralist challenge is thus, for all its tremendous\nrhetorical power, less philosophically threatening than it might be;\nfor it depends on a rather rich positive theory (of the good, human\nnature, human virtue, and politics) which Plato thinks he can show to\nbe false. Thrasymachus, by contrast, presents himself as more of a\nsocial critic: while persuasively debunking justice as conventionally\nunderstood, he fails to offer any account of real virtue in its stead.\nThe closest he comes to presenting a substitute norm is in his praise\nof the expertly rational real ruler\u2014an ideal which is pursued\nand developed more fully both by Callicles in the Gorgias and\nby Socrates in the Republic itself. \n\nSo where the Gorgias presents a mirroring and confrontation\nbetween two complete ethical stances, the immoralist and the Socratic,\nthe Republic depicts a complex dialectical progression from\nthe one to the other. It also gestures towards the Calliclean\nalternative with Glaucon\u2019s speech in Book II. Glaucon presents\nhis attack on justice as a restatement of Thrasymachus\u2019 position\n(358c); but it represents a considerable advance in theoretical\nsophistication, and the differences bring it closer to Callicles. Like\nCallicles, Glaucon concerns himself explicitly with the nature and\norigin of justice, classifying it as a merely instrumental good (or a\nnecessary evil) and locating its origins in a social contract. By\nnature we are all pleonectic; but since we stand to lose more than we\ncould gain from unbridled pleonexia we have entered into a\ncompact neither to do nor to allow injustice. As the famous\n\u2018ring of Gyges\u2019 thought-experiment is supposed to show,\nhowever, nobody has any real commitment to acting justly when they\nthink they can get away with injustice; for if someone can commit\ninjustice undetected there is no reason for him not to. Thus Glaucon\nagrees with Callicles in identifying justice as a matter of\nconvention, and in holding that it conflicts with our nature. At the\nsame time, he remains with Thrasymachus in not articulating any\nalternative moral norm; and he departs from both in not relying on the\ndubious division of mankind into two essentially different kinds, the\nallegedly \u2018strong\u2019 and the \u2018weak\u2019. He thus\nseems to represent the immoralist challenge in a fully developed yet\nstreamlined form, shorn of unnecessary complications and theoretical\nassumptions and reducible to a simple, pressing question: given the\nmerely conventional character of justice and the constraints it places\non our pleonectic nature, why should any one of us be just, whenever\ninjustice would be to our advantage? \n\nThis is also the challenge posed by the sophist Antiphon, in the\nsurviving fragments of his discussion of justice in On Truth\n(see Pendrick 2002 for the texts of Antiphon, and Gagarin and Woodruff\n1995 or Dillon and Gergel 2003 for translation). Antiphon argues that\njustice is only ever a matter of following the laws of one\u2019s own\ncommunity; and that there is no good reason for anyone to obey those\nlaws when they can break them without fear of detection and\npunishment. For nature too has its laws, which conflict with those of\nsociety, and violation of these is punished infallibly.\nAntiphon\u2019s text and meaning are unclear at some crucial points,\nbut the idea seems to be that the laws of society require us to act\nagainst our own interests, by constraining our animal natures and\nlimiting our natural desires and pleasures; and that it is foolish to\nobey these laws when we can get away with following nature instead.\nWithout wanting to deny the existence of other contemporary figures\nworking similar terrain, we can easily read Callicles, Thrasymachus,\nand Glaucon as Plato\u2019s disentangling and disambiguation of\nAntiphon\u2019s ideas into three possible positions, distinguished to\nclarify the various philosophical forms that a broadly immoralist\nstance might take. Thrasymachus represents the essentially negative,\ncynical, and debunking side of the immoralist stance, grounded in\nempirical observations of the ways of the world. At the same time his\nidealization of the \u2018real ruler\u2019 suggests that this is an\nunstable and incomplete position, liable to progress to a Calliclean\n\u2018heroic\u2019 form of immoralism. Callicles represents\nimmoralism as a new morality, dependent on the contrasts between\nnature and convention and between the strong and the weak. Glaucon\nshows that the immoralist challenge has no need of the latter (nor,\nfor that matter, of Thrasymachus\u2019 ideal of the real ruler).\nImmoralism is for everybody: we are all complicit in the social\ncompact which establishes law as a brake on self-interest, and we all\nhave reason to cheat on it when we can. This, Plato\u2019s\npresentation suggests, is ultimately the most challenging form of the\nimmoralist stance; and it is probably the closest to its historical\noriginal in Antiphon himself. Whether the whole argument of the\nRepublic suffices to defeat it remains a matter of live\nphilosophical debate.\n",
