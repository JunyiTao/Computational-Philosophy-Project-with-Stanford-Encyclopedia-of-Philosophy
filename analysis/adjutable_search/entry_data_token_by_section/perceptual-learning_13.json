    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning || Cognitive Penetration\n3.2 Cognitive Penetration\n\nRecall that cases of cognitive penetration are cases where one\u2019s\nbeliefs, thoughts, or desires influence one\u2019s perception (see\nMacpherson 2012: 24). One role of perceptual learning in the\nphilosophical literature has been to explain away putative cases of\ncognitive penetration. For instance, it might seem at first glance\nthat Siegel\u2019s pine tree case is a case of cognitive penetration,\na case where one\u2019s newly acquired concept of a pine tree\ninfluences one\u2019s perception. Connolly (2014b) and Arstila (2016), however, have\nboth argued that the best way to understand Siegel\u2019s pine tree\ncase is not as a case of cognitive penetration, but rather through the\nparticular mechanisms of perceptual learning. Connolly counts it as a\ncase of attentional weighting, while Arstila understands it as\ninvolving both unitization and differentiation. \n\nOne reason why perceptual learning is a good instrument for explaining\naway putative cases of cognitive penetration is the following. In\ncases of perceptual learning, it is the external environment that\ndrives the perceptual changes. As Raftopoulos puts it,\n\u201cperceptual learning does not necessarily involve cognitive\ntop-down penetrability but only data-driven processes\u201d (2001:\n493). For putative cases of cognitive penetration, the strategy for\nthe perceptual learning theorist is to show how the perceptual changes\ninvolved may have been data-driven instead of top-down. Several\nphilosophers have used this strategy at times, including Pylyshyn\n(1999: section 6.3), Brogaard and Gatzia (2015: 2), as well as Stokes\n(2015: 94), and Deroy (2013) might be interpreted in that way as\nwell.\n\nOne exception to the trend of explaining away putative cases of\ncognitive penetration in terms of perceptual learning is Cecchi\n(2014). Cecchi argues that a particular case of perceptual\nlearning\u2014that found in Schwartz, Maquet, and Frith\n(2002)\u2014should count as a case of cognitive penetration. The\nstudy in question found changes in the primary visual cortex due to\nlearning, and also that these changes were brought about by higher\nareas in the brain influencing the primary visual cortex. Because the\nperceptual changes were the result of top-down influence, Cecchi\nargues that this case of perceptual learning should count as a case of\ncognitive penetration.\n",
