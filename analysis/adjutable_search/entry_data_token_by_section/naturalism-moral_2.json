    "main_text": "Descriptivism and Reductivism || Descriptivism\n2.1 Descriptivism\n\nMany philosophers have found it intuitive that there is a distinction\nbetween terms like \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018bad,\u2019\n\u2018right,\u2019 \u2018wrong,\u2019 or \u2018reason,\u2019 on\nthe one hand and terms like \u2018pink,\u2019 \u2018shiny,\u2019\n\u2018bigger than a bread box,\u2019 or \u2018pleasurable\u2019 on\nthe other. The terms on the first list are called normative\nterms while the terms in the second list are descriptive\nterms. It is (mostly) uncontroversial that moral terms are\nnormative terms; so, if we refer to moral properties using moral terms\n(contra some expressivists and some error theorists), some normative\nterms refer to moral properties. Moral descriptivism is the\nview that some descriptive terms refer to moral properties as well\n(Heathwood 2009).\n\nMoral descriptivism is closely related to moral naturalism. Let us\nassume, as seems plausible, that the things that scientists\ninvestigate are things that can be referred to with descriptive\nlanguage. Good science doesn\u2019t moralize, it just says how things\nare. If this assumption is correct, then analytic naturalism entails\ndescriptivism. If moral claims are synonymous with scientific claims\nand scientific claims are made using descriptive language, then moral\nclaims are synonymous with descriptive claims. Moral terms refer to\nmoral properties; any synonymous terms would refer to those same\nproperties; therefore, there are descriptive terms that refer to moral\nproperties.\n\nSynthetic naturalists can be descriptivists, too. According to\nsynthetic descriptivism, there are descriptive terms that refer to\nmoral properties, but this is not so in virtue of any analytic\nrelation between normative and descriptive terminology. Rather, the\nsynthetic descriptivist argues for the existence of synthetic property\nidentity claims. The paradigm synthetic property identity is\n\u201cwater is H2O.\u201d \u2018Water\u2019 and\n\u2018H2O\u2019 are just two different labels for the\nsame thing. But \u2018H2O\u2019 is not the definition of\n\u2018water;\u2019 that water is H2O was not, and could\nnot have been, discovered by pure conceptual analysis. It is a\nsynthetic truth known a posteriori. Synthetic descriptivists hold that\ndescriptive terms which refer to moral properties reveal synthetic\nproperty identities, just as in the case of water and\nH2O.\n\nHowever, even though analytic naturalism entails descriptivism and\nsynthetic naturalism is consistent with descriptivism, Naturalism as\nDescriptivism is false. The first problem is that many supernatural\nterms are descriptive. So it\u2019s possible that moral properties\nare supernatural (e.g. divine) properties and descriptive terms refer\nto those moral, supernatural properties. In this case, descriptivism\nwould be true and naturalism false (Sturgeon 2009).\n\nAnother serious problem for Naturalism as Descriptivism is that, while\nanalytic naturalism entails descriptivism, synthetic naturalism\ndoesn\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason why facts that can be\nempirically investigated and fit comfortably with a scientific\nworldview must be referred to with descriptive terminology. A\nnaturalist can say that goodness is a natural property that is known\nvia empirical methods and features in causal explanations, and the\nonly term that refers to goodness is \u2018goodness.\u2019 Jonathan\nDancy calls this non-descriptivist naturalism \u201cone-term\nnaturalism,\u201d since one-term naturalists say that there is only\none term \u2013 a moral term \u2013 that refers to moral properties\n(Dancy 2006).\n\nIncidentally, because naturalism doesn\u2019t entail descriptivism,\none common challenge to naturalism fails: \u201cYou say that goodness\n(e.g.) is a natural property, but which natural property is it?\u201d\nFor a naturalist may reply: \u201cGoodness is a natural property. The\nonly natural property that goodness is identical to is itself:\ngoodness.\u201d This is a coherent and complete answer to the\nchallenge (Sturgeon 2003). The challenger seems to be demanding that\nthe naturalist pick out the property of goodness using descriptive\nterminology. This is an apt challenge to descriptivism but not to\nnaturalism. One-term naturalists are not descriptivists (V\u00e4yrynen\n2021).\n\nBut while Naturalism as Descriptivism seems like a non-starter,\nperhaps descriptivism is an interesting view in its own right. We\nmight even prefer to talk about descriptivism rather than naturalism\nin light of our difficulties with characterizing naturalism.\nUnfortunately, there are also problems with characterizing\ndescriptivism.\n\nOne problem is that it\u2019s actually rather easy to refer to moral\nproperties with descriptive terminology. Goodness was the primary\nsubject of G.E. Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica. So the phrase\n\u2018the subject of Principia Ethica\u2019 refers to\ngoodness, and that phrase uses only descriptive terminology. But this\nisn\u2019t a proof of descriptivism; descriptivists want some\nstronger relation between descriptive language and moral properties.\nBut it\u2019s hard to say what that stronger relation might be.\n\nA second problem is the existence of \u201cthick\u201d normative\nterminology, which apparently expresses both descriptive and normative\nconcepts, or perhaps concepts that are both descriptive and normative.\nCommon examples include \u2018brave\u2019 (and other virtue terms),\n\u2018cruel,\u2019 or even, perhaps, \u2018pleasurable\u2019\n(Roberts 2017, 212). Frank Jackson (1998) proposes that thick\nterminology, and any other terminology about which there could be\ndoubt as to classification, should be considered normative. Perhaps\nthat solves the problem.\n\nA third problem concerns our method for characterizing normative and\ndescriptive terminology. We started out with two contrasting lists of\nterminology, saying that one of the lists was a list of normative\nterminology and the other list, the \u201ceverything else\u201d\nlist, was a list of descriptive terminology. But our list of normative\nterminology was incomplete. Normative terminology includes everything\non that list and all other terminology that is similar. But what does\nall this normative terminology have in common in the first place? What\nmakes a term normative? One way of characterizing normative\nterminology is broadly functional: normative terminology expresses\nthoughts which regulate our actions in certain ways. But embracing a\nfunctional account of normative terminology cedes much ground to\nexpressivists, who hold that the meaning of normative terminology just\nis to express action-regulating states. And characterizing normative\nterminology in functional terms also deprives moral realists (and thus\nmoral naturalists) of one of their main arguments for realism, since\nthe existence of moral facts may no longer be read directly off of the\nsemantics of moral terms (Eklund 2017). For that reason, some realists\nprefer to characterize normative terminology in referential terms:\nnormative terminology is terminology that refers to normative\nproperties (Hernandez and Laskowski 2021). But if we give a\nreferential characterization of normative terminology, it\u2019s no\nlonger obvious how to draw our distinction between normative and\ndescriptive terminology. If a bit of terminology that we would\nintuitively put on the list of descriptive terminology ends up\nreferring to a moral property (which happens, according to\ndescriptivists!), then that terminology is ipso facto normative. So on\na referential account, which terms count as normative and which count\nas descriptive is not discoverable by simple reflection on the\nmeanings of the terms, but must instead involve substantial ethical\nand metaethical theorizing. A referential account of normative\nterminology would also threaten to render descriptivism incoherent,\nsince any terminology which referred to a moral property would be\nnormative rather than descriptive.\n",
