    "main_text": "Modality and Existence || The Existence of the Necessary Principle\n4.2 The Existence of the Necessary Principle\n\n\u201cConsidered in themselves\u201d (i\u1e0f\u0101\nu\u02bftubira bi-\u1e0f\u0101ti-hi), the things that find place\nin existence (al-um\u016br allat\u012b tad\u1e2bulu f\u012b\nl-wu\u01e7\u016bd) are subject to \u201ctwo divisions in the\nintellect\u201d: they are either \u201cnot necessarily\nexistent\u201d, and therefore possible, or \u201cnecessarily\nexistent\u201d (inherently impossible things do not exist and are\nexcluded from the analysis: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6, 37,\n6\u201310).\n\nOn this basis, Avicenna deduces the properties of what is in itself\nnecessarily existent. The first is being uncaused. It is in fact\n\u201cevident\u201d (\u1e93\u0101hir:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6, 38, 1) that the necessary has no\ncause: to have a cause means to exist by virtue of something else, and\nwhat exists by virtue of itself cannot exist by virtue of another, nor\ncan it exist by virtue of itself and at the same time not exist by\nvirtue of itself. The second property is uniqueness: the necessary has\nno \u201chomologue\u201d: there is nothing that\u2014even if\nequivalent to it as regards its definition\u2014could exist together\nwith it and thus occupy the same rank of existence, without being\neither its cause or its effect. Two necessary beings would in fact\neither both be caused (and therefore both non-necessary), or refer to\na cause that would make only one of them exist; but in the latter\ncase, they could no longer be defined as equivalent or homologous\n(mutak\u0101f\u012b al-wu\u01e7\u016bd): one would be\npossible and caused, while the other\u2014in the absence of another\nexternal cause\u2014would be its cause (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nI, 6, 39, 17\u201342, 7). Indeed, as shown by the discussion of the\nrelations between form and matter (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t II,\n4), and also soul and body (see the psychological part of the Book\nof the Healing, the Kit\u0101b al-nafs;\nAvicenna\u2019s De anima, V, 4), the co-existence of two\nthings always implies the action of a cause that makes them exist\n(Lizzini 2004).\n\nOther properties (see Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7) are\nattributable to a being necessary in itself: unity, simplicity and\nthen non-relativity, immutability, non-multiplicity and\nnon-association with anything other than itself (these properties,\namong others, are discussed in terms of negative\nattributes\u2014\u1e63if\u0101t\u2014of the Principle in\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII (4, 347, 10\u2013348, 6; 5, 354,\n9\u201314). The various and complex justifications Avicenna uses in\nthis respect are all reducible\u2014as he himself observes\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 46, 4\u20135)\u2014to a single\ngeneral line of argumentation, which shows that two supposed necessary\nbeings could not be distinguished one from the other: if they were to\nbe distinguished by virtue of an essential property, they would be\nessentially different and therefore both not necessarily existent in\nthemselves; if they were to be distinguished by virtue of an\naccidental property, they would imply the existence of an external\ncause and would be equally\u2014each of them\u2014not necessary\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 43, 4\u201346, 5; 46,\n6\u201347, 5).\n\nThe Necessarily Existent is therefore absolutely one, indivisible and\nunique (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47, 6\u20139; cf. VIII,\n4, 5) and the properties of the possible are deducible as opposite to\nthese (e contrario) (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47,\n10\u201319): the possible is caused and twofold\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47, 18\u201319); in itself it\ndoes not exist and therefore always receives existence from something\nelse. The hypothesis of a possible existent thing, which can both\nexist and not exist, leads necessarily to positing a cause that makes\nit necessary (by virtue of another). If the possible were not rendered\nnecessary by its cause, but\u2014given the cause and its relationship\nto it\u2014were still possible, it would be continuously in a state\nin which it could exist and not exist. But since it exists (the\nanalysis concerns existing things), its relation to the cause must be\nnecessary. Analogously, if the cause were in its turn possible, it\nwould refer to a further cause that would explain the existence of\nboth the caused thing and its cause. If even this further cause were\npossible, it would perforce have recourse to a third one, and so on.\nOne could not proceed ad infinitum (as an Aristotelian,\nAvicenna accepts only a potentially infinite series of causes) and\ncould consequently not explain the actual existence of a thing: the\nthing would still be possible and therefore non-existent.\n\nThe arguments of Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 6\u20137\u2014which\nare in part both reminiscent of and influential for those of the\nKal\u0101m (Rudolph 1997; Alper 2004)\u2014could be interpreted as an\nontological proof of God\u2019s existence (Hourani 1972; Morewedge\n1979; Marmura 1980; Davidson 1987), especially when seen in relation\nto an earlier passage of Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, where\nAvicenna attributes to metaphysics the power to establish the\nexistence (i\u1e6fb\u0101t) of God without recourse to sense\ndata (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 3, 21). Undeniably, Avicenna\noffers here a description of the status of necessary existence and a\ndeduction of its properties.\n",
