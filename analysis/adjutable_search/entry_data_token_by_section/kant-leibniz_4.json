    "main_text": "Space and Time\n5. Space and Time\n\nLeibniz held a relational theory of space and time. Without things\nthere would be no space, and without events there would be no time.\nSpace and time are not containers into which things and events may be\ninserted but which could have remained empty. In the Third Letter\nto Clarke (G 7:364), Leibniz maintains that \u201cwithout the\nthings placed in it, one point of space does not absolutely differ in\nany respect whatsoever from another point of space.\u201d An even\nmore ambitious positive proposal makes space the \u201corder of\nco-existents\u201d and time the \u201corder of successions\u201d (G\n7: 363), or a \u201cwell-founded phenomenon.\u201d\n\nDespite his admiration for Newton, his presentation of a purported\nproof of absolute space in the essay On the Basis of the\nDifference of Regions in Space of 1768 (2: 378), and his claim in\nthe First Critique that two distinct but absolutely identical portions\nof space were possible (KRV A 264/ B320), Kant rejected absolute space\nand absolute motion in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience. Consistently, however, he rejected Leibniz\u2019s claim\nthat space was founded on the order of relations of substances. To the\nclaim that space emerged somehow from the underlying monadic reality\nseemed to Kant to imply that the truths of mathematics\u2014in this\ncase three-dimensional geometry\u2014depended on the existence of a\nworld of things and events, which was absurd. Leibniz, Kant, suggests,\nhad noticed that things appear to interact causally and to determine\none another\u2019s behaviour. This led him to insist that space was\n\u201c a certain order in the community of substances, and\u2026\ntime\u2026 the dynamic sequences of their states,\u201d confusedly\napprehended (KRV A 275f/B 331f). However, the composition of bodies\nfrom monads as basic elements presupposes their juxtaposition in space\n(20:278). If we confusedly perceive monads as physical objects in\nspace, what would it be like to apprehend the monads distinctly as not\nin space but as the foundation of space? (4:481f)\n\nKant\u2019s conviction that the existence of incongruent counterparts\nproved that \u201cspace in general does not belong to the properties\nor relations of things in themselves\u201d (4: 484) is not easy to\nunderstand, but his basic argument in the 1768 essay is that\nLeibniz\u2019s view does not enable one to distinguish between a left\nhanded glove and a right handed glove, insofar as the relations of all\nthe parts to one another are the same in both cases. Yet if God had\ncreated just one glove, it would have been one or the other. Hence\nspace does not depend on relations between things in space.\nNewton\u2019s conception of space as a huge container does not\ncontribute to the solution of the problem: Consider a container in\nwhich a single glove is floating. Is it a right-handed glove or a\nleft-handed glove? We can insert various new items into this\nspace-container, e.g., an anorak, a scarf, a shoe, but only the\ninsertion of a human observer into the space will permit an answer.\nSpace, Kant, decides, is related to directionality or orientation. The\nhuman observer experiences himself as intersected by three planes and\nas having three sets of \u201csides\u201d, which he describes as up\nand down, back and forward, and right and left. Right-handedness and\nleft-handedness are not merely anthropic concepts since nature itself\ninsists on handedness in twining plants and the shells of snails (2:\n380). But which direction is right and which is left can only be\nestablished by a conscious, embodied being. As he expresses it in the\nProlegomena, \u201cThe difference between similar and equal\nthings which are not congruent\u2026cannot be made intelligible by\nany concept, but only by the relation to the right and left hands,\nwhich immediately refers to intuition\u201d (4: 286). How spheroid\nbeings with hands would distinguish between \u201cfront\u201d and\n\u201cback\u201d is not however clear. It is not clear whether this\norientational analysis implies that wherever there is space there must\nalso be sentient beings with pairs of incongruent parts, as well as\ntop-bottom and back-front asymmetry.\n\nIn the Inaugural Dissertation \u00a715, Kant tries to move\nbeyond the dichotomy of taking space and time to be either substances\nor phenomena, taking space instead to belong to the\n\u201cform\u201dof sensible intuition. As he expresses it in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, \u201cSpace and time are [our\nsensibility\u2019s] pure forms\u2026\u201d (KRV A42/B60). They are\n\u201cmerely subjective conditions of all our intuition.\u201d\n(ibid., A 49/B 66). [See the entry on\n Kant\u2019s views on space and time.]\n\nFor Leibniz, each monad experiences an individual succession of\nappetites and experiences that God has endowed it with from the\ncreation of the world. Being fated in this way, though acting always\nunder their own \u201cspontaneous\u201d power, the monads would seem\nto be deprived of meaningful agency and beneficiaries or victims of\nseemingly unjust rewards and punishments. Kant believed that locating\nspace and time in us rather than in the world was an absolute barrier\nagainst the determinism that threatened the notion of moral\nresponsibility (A 5:97\u20138; 102).\n",
