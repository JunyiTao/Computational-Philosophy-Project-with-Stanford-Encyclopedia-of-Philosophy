    "main_text": "Noetics \u2014 Epistemology and Psychology\n4. Noetics \u2014 Epistemology and Psychology\n\nMulla Sadra applies his metaphysics to problems in psychology and\neschatology as well. Just as the totality of existence is singular\nwith degrees of intensity, similarly intellect and the soul are\nsingular realities with grades of intensity, since there is an\nintimate connection among existence, the intellect, and the soul as\nthe concrete, intellectual, and psychic aspects of being. This entails\na thoroughgoing pan-psychism in which for Mulla Sadra all existents\nare sentient beings that aspire to be \u201cmore intense\u201d than\nthey are, to a higher ontological level. Everything that exists thus\npossesses consciousness. Since all levels of intellect are connected,\nknowledge is an existential relationship of identity and the cognition\nof certainty in which the intellecting subject becomes identified with\nthe intellected object (ittihad al-\u2018aqil\nwa-l-ma\u2018qul). Further, he uses his doctrine of modulation\nto explain physical resurrection, a theological doctrine that\ntraditionally could not be philosophically demonstrated. He\ndistinguishes two levels of resurrection that involve two\n\u201ctypes\u201d of body, a purely physical one and an\n\u201cimaginal\u201d body that is as real as the physical. The\nimaginal body is at first resurrected and can be demonstrated. This is\npredicated upon the existence of an ontological state of being known\nas the imaginal (mithali) that mediates between an\nintelligible world of concepts and the sensible world of things. It is\nused to explain those traditions that discuss abstract concepts such\nas fear and desire as having physical or corporeal features in\nresurrection. Concepts from the intelligible world can mimic the\nphysicality of this world through the mediation of the imaginary realm\nof being.\n",
