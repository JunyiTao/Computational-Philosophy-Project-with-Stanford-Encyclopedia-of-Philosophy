    "main_text": "The Return || The Circle of Existence\n5.1 The Circle of Existence\n\nWhen the theologians discussed the Return, they tried to prove the\naccuracy of the Koranic depictions of the Day of Resurrection, hell,\nand paradise, mainly by appealing to the authority of God\u2019s\nword. They had little to say about the actual nature of the soul, the\nstructure of the cosmos, or the ontological status of the posthumous\nrealms. In contrast, both philosophers and Sufis were intensely\ninterested in these issues, as well as in the complementary question\nof the Origin (mabda\u2019). Origin and Return became major\nthemes in both schools of thought, but, in contrast to the\nphilosophers, Sufis highlighted the exemplary role of Muhammad. Thus,\nfor example, they drew a favorite image from a Koranic verse related\nto the Prophet\u2019s \u201cnight journey\u201d\n(isr\u00e2\u2019, also called the\nmi\u2018r\u00e2j or \u201cladder\u201d), when he was\ntaken up through and beyond the heavens to encounter God: \u201cHe\nwas two-bows\u2019-length away, or closer\u201d (53:9). In Arabic\nthe word qaws or bow, like Latin arcus, also means\nthe arc of a circle, so the two bows can be understood as two arcs.\nThese came to be called \u201cthe descending arc\u201d (al-qaws\nal-nuz\u00fbl\u00ee), that is, the path of increasing\ndelimitation and darkness that leads away from the Origin, and\n\u201cthe ascending arc\u201d (al-qaws\nal-su\u2018\u00fbd\u00ee), the ever-increasing disengagement\n(tajarrud) and luminosity of the soul on the path of the\nReturn.\n",
