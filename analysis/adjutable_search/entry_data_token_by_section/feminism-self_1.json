Reclamation of Feminine Identities and Women\u2019s Status\n\nThese oversights necessitate reconceptualizing the self in at least\ntwo respects. To account for features of the self that have been\ntraditionally overlooked, such as interdependence and vulnerability,\nthe self must be understood as socially situated and relational. To\naccount for the self\u2019s ability to discern and resist ingrained\ncultural norms, the moral subject must not be reduced to the capacity\nfor reason. For many feminists, to acknowledge the self\u2019s\ndependency is not to devalue the self but rather to value\nvulnerability (Code 2011), as well as to call into question the\nsupposed free agency of a self that implicitly corresponds to a\nmasculine ideal.\n\nYet one might worry that revaluing dependency risks perpetuating\nderogatory views of women as victim and men as agents and/or\nentrenching a gender binary that divides values into masculine and\nfeminine. A focus on dependency and care may additionally risk\nconflating women with mothers and nurturers in what Patrice DiQuinzio\nhas called \u201cessential motherhood\u201d (1999). Arguing that\nmoral virtues truly have no gender, Mary Wollstonecraft regards\n\u201cfeminine\u201d virtues as perversions of these true virtues\nand laments women\u2019s conscription into a bogus ideal\n(Wollstonecraft 1792). Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir labels women\nunder patriarchy \u201cmutilated\u201d and \u201cimmanent\u201d\n(Beauvoir 1949 [2011]). Socialized to objectify themselves, women are\nsaid to become narcissistic, small-minded, and dependent on\nothers\u2019 approval. Excluded from careers, waiting to be chosen by\ntheir future husbands, taken over by natural forces during pregnancy,\nand busy with tedious, repetitive housework, women never become\ntranscendent agents. For Beauvoir, they often resist the burden of\nresponsibility for their own freedom.\n\nThis portrayal of women as abject victims of the patriarchal family\nhas been challenged and modulated in contemporary feminist philosophy.\nWe shall review three major reclamation strategies: (1) revaluing the\ntraditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d activities of mothering and other\nmodes of social bonding through the development of care ethics and\neros ethics; (2) rethinking autonomy by moving beyond the two\ntraditional models described above; and (3) reclaiming sexual\ndifference through a symbolic analysis of female identity.\n\nFeminists argue that pregnancy, birth, and mothering reveal important\nfeatures of the self, even for humans who do not have these\nexperiences themselves. Two overlapping philosophical\napproaches\u2014an ethics of care and an ethics of eros\u2014have\nrevalued the significance of the mother in ways that bear on the issue\nof the self. Both traditions emphasize that pregnancy and/or mothering\nreveal that agency is frequently co-constituted and dynamic. The care\ntradition varies among those who aim to value dependency work and/or\nreconceptualize autonomy so that autonomy and dependency are\ncompatible (Gilligan 1982 and 1987; Ruddick 1989; Kittay 1999; Held\n2006; Lindemann 2014). Care ethics emphasizes the value of care work\nand character virtues that reflect vulnerability. An ethics of eros\ndraws from traditions of \u201cothermothering\u201d and emancipatory\ndiscourses of generative libidinal drives and/or cultivating a social\neros of connection (Collins 1990; Irigaray 1993; Willett 1995, 2001, 2008, 2014, 2019; Lorde 2007). Social\nbonds may reflect a dynamic of kinship, political solidarity, or\ncommunity engagement outside the nuclear family paradigm (Collins\n1990; Nzegwu 2006). This tradition of eros foregrounds complicated\nmodes of interdependency that spiral out of the autonomy/dependency\nbinary and emphasize thick networks of social belongings. An ethics of\neros emphasizes the revitalizing affects of preconscious energy and\nconnectedness, and their creative potential for political subversion\nand communal practices. Here, the self is a multilayered phenomenon\nwith a dynamic set of roles and interconnected desires.\n\nHistorically, the relation between mother and child was either\nexcluded altogether from philosophical discourse or taken as mere\npreparation for a full expression of ethical selfhood. Prevalent\nWestern views commonly invoke a tale of early dependency on the family\nfollowed by the eventual achievement of autonomy through narratives of\nseparation and acquiring virtues of self-determination. In contrast,\nfeminists in the care ethics and eros traditions revalue the\nmother-child relationship as a way of figuring the interdependency of\nthe self. The infant\u2019s development of creative communicative\nskills through affect attunement and face-to-face play explains the\nlifelong intensity of social bonds (Willett 1995, 2001, and 2014; Welsh 2013). Alternative traditions of\nmaturation may feature instead a multiplicity of social roles,\npractices, and connections. Hilde Lindemann argues that caregiving\nexhibits key features of what she calls the practice of\npersonhood of knowing when and how to hold and let go of parts of others identities (Lindemann 2014). Patricia Hill Collins\noffers glimpses of an erotic ethics of interconnectivity in her\ncharacterization of the fluidity of \u201cothermothers\u201d for\nblack American communities (Collins 1990). Collins cites Audre\nLorde\u2019s distinct rendering of the term \u201ceros\u201d as not\nprimarily sexual or narrowly maternal, but rather as an energetic\ndrive that oppressive systems attempt to appropriate, but which may be\nregenerated through creative social practices. Cynthia Willett,\nexpanding upon critical traditions of eros, argues that the laughing\nmother provides a subversive complement to the long-suffering,\nself-sacrificing maternal ideal (Willett and Willett 2019), while Mary\nRawlinson advocates the generativity of mothers as an alternative to\nthe proprietary notion of the modern self (Rawlinson 2016). Because\nall people are cared for by an adult or adults, and every individual\nis shaped by this emotionally charged interaction, the self is\nessentially formed in and through its relations with its caregivers\n(Chodorow 1981). For Chodorow, the rigidly differentiated,\ncompulsively rational, and stubbornly independent self is a masculine\ndefensive formation\u2014a warped form of the relational\nself\u2014that develops as a result of fathers\u2019 negligible\ninvolvement in childcare.\n\nCaring for a child involves a range of activities governed by a\ndistinct set of values: protecting and caring for a fragile existence\nand expanding the sense of self while acknowledging the limits of\none\u2019s power and the unpredictability of events, being sensitive\nto the other\u2019s very different viewpoint, and learning to love\nwhile struggling against traumatic social conditions, inadequate\nsocial services, and invasive governmental and medical interventions\n(Collins 1990; Brown 1998). The practice of motherhood calls upon a\nwide range of interpersonal, political, and reflective skills that go\nwell beyond the deliberative reasoning that dominates traditional view\nof the self. For instance, the ability to empathize with others and\nimaginatively reconstruct their unique viewpoints is vital to moral\nwisdom, but ethics that base moral judgment on an abstract conception\nof personhood marginalize this skill (Meyers 1994). Care and eros\nethicists revalue that which is traditionally deemed\nfeminine\u2014feeling, intimacy, and nurturance\u2014in order to\nreclaim the venues traditionally associated with women and to open up\na broader way of conceiving of the moral self.\n\nSome feminists seek to rebalance autonomy with care, while others do\naway with autonomy altogether. For some, autonomy is an androcentric\nrelic of modernism (Jaggar 1983; Addelson 1994; Hekman 1995; Card\n1996). Others assert women\u2019s need for autonomous\nself-determination (Lugones and Spelman 1983; de Lauretis 1986; King\n1988; Govier 1993). Mothering itself frequently involves the need to\ncarve space and time away from one\u2019s child (LaChance Adams\n and Lundquist 2012). It may also\ninvolve a reclamation of spirited independence in the \u201cfearless\nfighter\u201d role that women reclaim as part of a maternal ethos in\nsome cultures and/or oppressive conditions (Nzegwu 2006; Lorde 2007).\nIn this vein, a number of feminists present accounts of autonomy that\ndo not devalue the interpersonal capacities that are conventionally\ncoded feminine (Mackenzie 2014 and 2017; Nedelsky 1989; Meyers 1989\nand 2000; Benhabib 1999; Benjamin, 1988; Weir 1995). In feminist accounts, autonomy is not conflated\nwith self-sufficiency and free will, but rather is seen to be\nfacilitated by supportive relationships and to be a matter of degree\n(Friedman 1993). Feminist accounts also stress the autonomous\nindividual\u2019s need for constructive feedback and the co-creation\nof selves with others (Brison 2002 and 2017; Cavarero 1997; Alcoff\n2017; Ahmed 2017). A feminist view opens the space for considering\nautonomy an ongoing and improvisational process of self-discovery,\nself-definition, and self-direction, rather than endorsing a set of\ndesires and goals chosen exclusively by the individual (Meyers 1989\nand 2000).\n\nIn addition to caregiving practices such as mothering, some feminists\nhave attended to the potential of pregnancy for reconsidering autonomy\nand independence. Additionally, pregnancy draws attention to a\nuniquely intimate embodiment of self-other imbrication. Iris Marion\nYoung argues that pregnancy is a testament to the split subject or\nself. For Young, pregnancy disrupts the integrity of the body. In\npregnancy, the boundary between self and other breaks down, and one\nexperiences one\u2019s \u201cinsides as the space of another\u201d\n(Young 1990). In contrast with Young, Gail Weiss suggests that\npregnancy allows us to re-envision the integrity of the body: instead\nof positioning the pregnant body as a breakdown of the traditional\nunified self, pregnancy reveals that bodily integrity is always\nalready fluid and expansive (Weiss 1999). As Talia Welsh points out,\nthe experiences of those who are pregnant reveal that selfhood is\nneither unified nor genderless (Welsh 2013). It may even be that\npregnancy offers a \u201cmetaphysically and phenomenologically\nprivileged\u201d situation for investigating the interrelation\nbetween self and other (Rodemeyer 1998).\n\nWhile pregnancy affords opportunities for positively demonstrating the\nmultiplicity of the self, it may also shed light on the violations\nthat women face in patriarchal societies. Young points out that the\ninterventions of obstetric medicine into women\u2019s bodies alienate\nwomen from themselves through pathologizing their conditions,\nsubjecting women to invasive medical technologies, and rendering women\npassive in the birthing process (Young 1990). The devaluation and\nsurveillance of black and brown pregnant bodies, such as in\nstate-induced abortions, call for greater empowerment of women rather\nthan an automatic praise of vulnerability (Brown 1998). In the last\nfew decades, medical technologies, such as sonography and fetal and\nneonatal surgery, have sometimes faced those who are pregnant with\nwrenching choices that test their agential resilience and capacities\nto care (Feder 2014; LaChance Adams and Lundquist 2012). Jennifer\nScuro suggests that all pregnancies involve a death within the self\nbecause all end in an expulsion of the other\u2019s body from oneself\n(Scuro 2017). All\npregnancy thus dislodges presumptions of the self-possessed subject.\nAt the same time, this expulsion of the other is not always a\nbirth\u2014pregnancy sometimes ends in miscarriage, when it does not\nend in abortion\u2014and so pregnancy should be dissociated from\nchildbirth.\n\nAs is evident from this analysis of pregnancy, feminist theories of\nselfhood frequently combine philosophical analysis with social\ncritique and the testimony of lived experience. The latter has an\nespecially long history within phenomenology, where feminist\nphilosophers have been describing women\u2019s experiences for the\npast century. Because phenomenology as a whole strongly emphasizes the\nbody and first-person experience, it fits methodologically with many\nof the goals of feminism. Specifically, phenomenological theories of\nembodiment emphasize the agential nature of the lived body, resisting\ntraditional conceptions from philosophy that make the body the mere\ninstrument of the mind. At the same time, feminist phenomenologists\nresist the abstract nature of traditional phenomenological methods.\nFor feminist phenomenology, different selves are differently\npositioned in ways that matter, and cannot be abstracted from their\nsocial roles into a transcendental domain of inquiry. This stands in\nopposition with classical phenomenology, which tended to promulgate a\nuniversalized notion of the ego that elided differences between\nbodies. Early women phenomenologists, such as Edith Stein and Gerda\nWalther, frequently analyze how traditionally feminine-coded values\nsuch as empathy and community play a part in women\u2019s everyday\nlives and moral development (Stein 1996; Walther 1923). Most\ninfluentially, Simone de Beauvoir argues that the human condition is\nambiguous: experience involves \u201cimmanence\u201d, or\nembeddedness within one\u2019s historico-cultural and interpersonal\nsituation, and \u201ctranscendence\u201d, or radical freedom with\nrespect to one\u2019s choices and future. While all humans shared\nthis condition according to Beauvoir, she claims that women have been\noverwhelmingly associated with immanence, and thus have not been\nencouraged to claim their own freedom (Beauvoir 1949 [2011]). This\nmeans that their selves are generally overdetermined by their\nsituations and contexts\u2014what biology and others claim them to\nbe. For Beauvoir, women should reassert their transcendence through\nproductive projects. Beauvoir thus puts an existentialist spin on both\nphenomenology\u2019s emphasis on situation and some feminists\u2019\nreclamation of autonomy. For Beauvoir, \u201cwoman\u201d is a\ncategory imposed by society; women\u2019s selves, then, are also in\nlarge part imposed on them by society, and women would do well to\nfashion their own selfhood through claiming their freedom. Yet this\nfreedom is always co-determined in situation with others.\n\nIn recent decades, feminist phenomenologists have further investigated\nthe living body as a site of selfhood that both reflects cultural\nnorms and can provide a site of resistance to them. Taking inspiration\nfrom Beauvoir\u2019s claims about ambiguity, feminist\nphenomenologists undertake a wide range of investigations into\ndimensions of women\u2019s bodily existence. Iris Marion Young, for\ninstance, has drawn attention to the way that women\u2019s bodily\nmodes of expression reflect cultural norms of immanence and\nobjectification (Young 1990). Sandra Bartky shows that women are\nencouraged to take themselves as sexual objects, which alienates them\nfrom their lived bodies and encourages them to see their bodies and\nselves as passive (Bartky 1990). The phenomenology of embodiment is\nthus not separate from nexuses of social power (Oksala 2016). At the\nsame time, phenomenological attention to conditions such as pregnancy\n(described above) may illuminate a more positive side of the fractious\nnature of women\u2019s selves: the self, here, is multiplicitous.\nConflict among roles is constitutive of the self, and it is especially\nsalient among women in patriarchal societies (Weiss 2008). Latina\nfeminist phenomenology has been particularly active in recent decades\nin reconceptualizing this multiplicitous self, as we will see in\ngreater detail in the following section.\n\nFeminist phenomenology also emphasizes the way that sexual violations\ntrade on the interdependent, vulnerable, and gendered nature of the\nself. Sexual violence is taken by many feminists not merely to be one\nform of physical violence among others, but rather to be a denial of\nself (Cahill 2001; Brison 2002). The body for phenomenology is the\ndynamic site of the self, and can only be reduced to an object under\noppressive social conditions (Beauvoir 1949 [2011]; Cahill 2001). As\nsuch, sexual violence cuts to the very heart of the self. Rape, for\ninstance, alters selfhood (Cahill 2001; Brison 2002; Alcoff 2017).\n\nPhenomenology is not the only site of feminist philosophy that\nunderscores the body and resists the mind/body dualism characteristic\nof modern notions of autonomous selfhood. The contemporary fields of\naffect theory and new materialism have pushed feminist conceptions of\nembodiment and selfhood even beyond a recognition of situated\nrelationality, sometimes arguing for a radical rupture of the\nself/other distinction. Sara Ahmed and Teresa Brennan suggest that\naffects and emotions neither go from the \u201cinside out\u201d nor\ncome from the \u201coutside in\u201d; rather, emotions may be found\nwithin the very atmosphere of the social (Ahmed 2004; Brennan 2004).\nRanjana Khanna sees affects as openings onto the other both\n\u201cwithin\u201d the self and beyond it (Khanna 2012). For\nfeminist new materialisms, the body is not an individual expressive\nwhole (as it remains in phenomenology); rather, the body is a\n\u201csexually preconstituted, dynamic bundle of relations\u201d\n(Braidotti 2006) that is interconnected with the environment through\nintensities and flows (Grosz 1994). Feminist materialism often\npositions itself in contrast to poststructuralism because of the\nformer\u2019s emphasis on the material body, but both of these\napproaches underscore the radical heterogeneity, or even nonexistence,\nof the self. And the new materialist focus on the body, following the\n\u201ccyborg\u201d theory of Donna Haraway, suggests that biological\nbodies are not set in opposition to technology; rather, they are\ndensely imbricated. Feminist materialism seeks to dislocate identities and\nfocus on becomings (Braidotti 2016).\n\nNew materialism in particular has been influenced by the work of\npoststructuralist Luce Irigaray, who draws on the imagery of the\nfemale body to offer an alternative to masculine models of autonomy.\nIrigaray plays off the symbol of the vaginal lips to figure a mode of\nselfhood in which the body is always already two, a self-touching\norganism that is multiplicitous (Irigaray 1985b and 1993). Through this gesture,\nIrigaray reclaims the association of the feminine with the body in the\nface of masculine dreams of separatist autonomy. Through her strategy\nof \u201cmimesis\u201d, Irigaray utilizes the very stereotypes that\nhave been used against women in order to undermine them: she plays on\nthe traditional conception of woman as the \u201cother\u201d, the\nmere body, the passive \u201cmirror\u201d of the male subject. She\ndepicts an erotic love of self that affirms difference within oneself\nand allows the self-differentiating subject to connect with others.\nShe also resists the very idea of identity as presuming a unified,\nphallocentric model of selfhood (Irigaray 1985b).\n\nThese and other reclamations of female identities have prompted a\nnumber of significant reconceptualizations of the self as relational\nand multilayered.\n",
