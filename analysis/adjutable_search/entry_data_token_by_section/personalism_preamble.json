    "main_text": "\nAlthough it was only in the first half of the twentieth century\nthat the term \u2018personalism\u2019 became known as a designation\nof philosophical schools and systems, personalist thought had\ndeveloped throughout the nineteenth century as a reaction to perceived\ndepersonalizing elements in Enlightenment rationalism, pantheism,\nHegelian absolute idealism, individualism as well as collectivism in\npolitics, and materialist, psychological, and evolutionary\ndeterminism. In its various strains, personalism always underscores\nthe centrality of the person as the primary locus of investigation for\nphilosophical, theological, and humanistic studies. It is an approach\nor system of thought which regards or tends to regard the person as\nthe ultimate explanatory, epistemological, ontological, and\naxiological principle of all reality, although these areas of thought\nare not stressed equally by all personalists and there is tension\nbetween idealist, phenomenological, existentialist, and Thomist\nversions of personalism.\n",
