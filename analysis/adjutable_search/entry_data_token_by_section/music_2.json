The most discussed issues\nwithin this field have been the metaphysical nature of works of\nWestern classical music (the \u201cfundamentalist debate\u201d), and\nwhat it is to give an \u201cauthentic performance\u201d of such\nworks. Recently there has been growing interest in the ontologies of\nother Western musical traditions, such as rock and jazz, and\ndiscussion of the methodology and value of musical ontology. (For more\ndetailed overviews of these debates, see Matheson & Caplan 2011,\nand Nussbaum 2021.)\n",
