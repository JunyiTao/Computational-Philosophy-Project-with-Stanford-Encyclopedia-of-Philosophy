    "main_text": "Equality Among Whom?\n5. Equality Among Whom?\n\nJustice is primarily related to individual actions. Individual persons\nare the primary bearers of responsibility (the key principle of\nethical individualism). This raises two controversial issues in the\ncontemporary debate.\n\nOne could regard the norms of distributive equality as applying to\ngroups rather than individuals. It is often groups that rightfully\nraise the issue of an inequality between themselves and the rest of\nsociety, as with women and racial and ethnic groups. The question\narises of whether inequality among such groups should be considered\nmorally objectionable in itself, or whether even in the case of\ngroups, the underlying concern should be how individuals (as members\nof such groups) fare in comparative terms. If there is a worry about\ninequalities between groups of individuals, why does this not\ntranslate into a worry about inequalities between members of the\ngroup?\n\nA further question concerns whether the norms of distributive equality\n(whatever they are) apply to all individuals, regardless of where (and\nwhen) they live. Or rather, do they only hold for members of\ncommunities within states and nations? Most theories of equality deal\nexclusively with distributive equality among people in a single\nsociety. There does not, however, seem to be any rationale for that\nlimitation. Can the group of the entitled be restricted prior to the\nexamination of concrete claims? Many theories seem to imply this,\nespecially when they connect distributive justice or the goods to be\ndistributed with social cooperation or production. For those who\ncontribute nothing to cooperation, such as the disabled, children, or\nfuture generations, would have to be denied a claim to a fair share.\nThe circle of persons who are to be the recipients of distribution\nwould thus be restricted from the outset. Other theories are less\nrestrictive, insofar as they do not link distribution to actual social\ncollaboration, yet nonetheless do restrict it, insofar as they bind it\nto the status of citizenship. In this view, distributive justice is\nlimited to the individuals within a society. Those outside the\ncommunity have no entitlement to social justice. Unequal distribution\namong states and the social situations of people outside the\nparticular society could not, in this view, be a problem of social\ndistributive justice (Nagel 2005). Yet here too, the universal\nmorality of equal respect and the principle of equal distribution\ndemand that all persons consider one another as prima facie equally\nentitled to the goods, unless reasons for an unequal distribution can\nbe advanced. It may be that in the process of justification, reasons\nwill emerge for privileging those who were particularly involved in\nthe production of a good, but there is no prima facie reason to\nexclude from the outset other persons, such as those from other\ncountries, from the process of distribution and justification (Pogge\n2002). That may seem most intuitively plausible in the case of natural\nresources (e.g. oil) that someone discovers by chance on or beneath\nthe surface of his or her property. Why should such resources belong\nto the person who discovers them, or on whose property they are\nlocated? Nevertheless, in the eyes of many if not most people, global\njustice, i.e., extending egalitarian distributive justice globally,\ndemands too much from individuals and their states (Miller 1998; but\ncf. Caney 2005). Alternatively, one might argue that there are other\n\u2018special relations\u2019 between members of one society that do\nnot exist between members of different societies. Nationalism is an\nexample for such a (controversial) thesis that may provide a case for\na kind of local equality (Miller 1995). For further discussion,\nsee the entry on \n global justice.\n\nAnother issue is the relationship between generations. Does the\npresent generation have an egalitarian obligation towards future\ngenerations regarding equal living conditions? One argument in favor\nof this conclusion might be that people should not end up unequally\nwell off as a result of morally arbitrary factors. However, the issue\nof justice between generation is notoriously complex (Temkin\n1992). For further discussion, see the entry on \n intergenerational justice.\n",
