How can a\ncharioteer guide powerful horses spooked by fear? More, in broken\nhealth, addressed these questions (<August 1534> letter of\nMargaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW 1311.17\u201320]), in\nthe last years of his life, even as he himself faced the prospect of\ntorture (16 January 1534/5 letter to Master Leder [EW\n1329.20\u201321]) as well as the most painful and shameful death that\nEngland had devised (1535 Bag of Secrets [EW\n1360.76\u201386]). Prior to his imprisonment, when counting the\ncosts, More confessed to being scandalized by his own resistance to\nsuffering (1534 letter 210 to Margaret Roper [EW\n1325.59\u201362]), yet he also confessed that despite \u201csuch\nfear and heavy pensiveness \u2026 I never in my mind intended to\nconsent\u201d to do anything that would go against \u201cmine own\nconscience\u201d (1534 letter 211 to Margaret Roper [EW\n1327.77\u201381]). But he saw close friends\u2014under fears and\npressures similar to those he faced\u2014consent to what earlier they\nhad strongly rejected in conscience (August 1534 letter of Margaret\nRoper to Alice Alington [EW 1311\u201320], 1534 letters to\nWilson [EW 1320\u201323]).\n\nAgainst this background, More wrote his last Socratic dialogue, A\nDialogue of Comfort against Tribulation (1534). It focuses on the\nrole of reason in preparing the soul to be guided in a time of great\ntrial by a reason enlightened by faith and strengthened by grace. As\nMore explained later in his final work, The Sadness of\nChrist, \u201cin a human being, reason ought to reign like a\nking\u201d (1535 [EW 1289.30]). But if this ought to be the\ncase, why does it rarely turn out that way? Even Christ\u2019s human\nnature rebelled to the point that he sweated blood and pleaded that\nthe cup of suffering might pass; even angels and the first human\nbeings with all of their special gifts failed (EW\n1027\u201337). In response to this challenge, More argued that human\nbeings are created to be responsible for learning how to govern freely\ntheir own God-given faculties of memory, intellect, and will\u2014and\nhe warned that they will fail \u201call for \u2026\nnegligence\u201d in using their freedom properly (EW\n1035.75, 87.141; 1153.62; 1182.26; 1259.79\u201382, 1260.23,\n1273.64).\n\nIn A Dialogue of Comfort, terrified young Vincent comes\nseeking advice from wise old Antony. Vincent is obsessed with fears\nfor himself, his family, and his country as the Turks prepare to\nreturn to Hungary after having killed and tortured many Hungarians\njust one year before.\n\nVincent is so distraught that it takes Antony two and a half books to\ncalm him down enough to address the first and most important of his\nconcerns. In those books, Antony exhibits a skillful Socratic\nstrategy, leading Vincent to sufficient self-knowledge so that he can\nbegin the work of self-government. Antony confirms, for example, that\nessential seeds are planted in the garden of Vincent\u2019s soul\n(EW 1116.5, 9; 1232.59\u201363; also EW 4.120,\n479.53\u201369) and reveals to him those seeds that are missing or\ninsufficiently cultivated (EW 1126.48ff, 1185.39\u201342,\n1237.49\u201386). Antony even has Vincent play the part of a rich man\nas a way of leading him to deeper self-knowledge (EW\n1211\u201314), since a thorough knowledge of self is foundational to\nenable the active cultivation of his own soul that Vincent will\npromise to undertake at the end of this Dialogue.\n\nAfter two and a half books of conversation, Antony judges that Vincent\nhas achieved sufficient \u201ccomfort and courage\u201d that he can\nnow help Vincent \u201cmore quietly consider\u201d the \u201csorest\npart\u201d of his fears, the fears he brought up early in Book 1\n(EW 1219.64\u201371). Antony deliberately postponed this\nconsideration (EW 1125.57) until Vincent\u2019s soul was\nsufficiently calm, recognizing that it is not possible to\n\u201cexamine the weight and substance\u201d of his greatest terrors\n\u201cwhen the heart is \u2026 taken up and oppressed with the\ntroublous affection of heavy sorrowful fear\u201d (EW\n1219.67\u201371). For reason to reign, the soul must have a certain\nlevel of equanimity\u2014an insight reinforced in More by Lucian and\nSeneca among others (EW 20.16n2 1164.42\u201343, 1219.66,\n1224.25, 1380.45\u201350; EW 1221.30 for Seneca), and by his\nown experience.\n\nWhat More does in A Dialogue of Comfort is to show how\ndifficult it is to achieve enough self-knowledge to begin the training\nneeded for self-government, because true self-government requires\nunderstanding reason\u2019s essential but insufficient\nrole\u2014hence the dialogue\u2019s insistence on the need for\nGod\u2019s grace and revelation. Antony explains that, created with\nreason and free will, every human being is obliged to undertake this\nmost important and most difficult project of self-government\n(EW 1255.29\u201331).\n\nVincent began Book 1 with images of tempestuous storms, cruel torture,\nand tyrannical oppression\u2014images that obsessed and deeply\ndisturbed his soul and the souls of his friends (EW 1112.36,\n50\u201351, 56\u201357; EW 1112.53, 70\u20137;\n1113.3\u20137, 21\u20132). Appropriately then, Antony repeatedly\nuses the images of sailing in storms or of riding spirited and\npowerful horses. Part of sailing is knowing when and how to lower the\nsails in a storm (EW 1123.7\u20139) and training oneself to\ndeal with fear in the face of losing the ship when it is buffeted by\nwinds (EW 1135.60\u20133, 1163.70\u201379,\n1175.6\u201312). Part of guiding powerful horses is learning how to\nuse bridle and bit (EW 1232.71\u20134), just as one learns\nto discipline the temperament of one\u2019s own soul (EW\n1168.24\u201330, 1175.71\u20131176.13).\n\nUltimately Antony helps Vincent see and appreciate the indispensable\nroles played by reason in tempering the soul by coming to learn and\nmaintain those habits necessary for reason to rule. But self-knowledge\nalso reveals the limits of fallible reason and therefore the need for\nit to be supported by prayer and grace\u2014a topic treated again in\nMore\u2019s final book, The Sadness and Weariness and Fear and\nPrayer of Christ.\n\nVincent (whose name means \u201che who conquers\u201d) ends A\nDialogue of Comfort by resolving to transform his affections from\nlove of earthly goods to spiritual goods. To do so, he not only writes\ndown Antony\u2019s counsels in Hungarian but also translates them\ninto multiple languages to imprint them in his mind and imagination,\nworking to fulfill Antony\u2019s requirement of \u201csufficient\nminding\u201d (EW 1241.60).\n\nMore was imprisoned for the last sixteen months of his life and was\nexecuted for high treason on 6 July 1535. His last works and days put\nto the test his earlier theory of philosophy as a preparation for\ndeath. How theory and practice aligned in his life and thought is part\nof the intrigue of studying this Renaissance figure whom Erasmus\ndescribed as a \u201cman for all seasons\u201d.\n",
