    "main_text": "Justice and Climate Policies || Population\n7.2 Population\n\nSome philosophers have argued that a commitment to preventing\ndangerous climate change requires adopting policies designed to limit\nor reduce world population size (Cafaro 2012; Cripps 2015). Their\nargument is that population growth is one of the main factors\ncontributing to climate change. Other things being equal, more people\nresult in more emissions, so, given the direness of the situation\npolicies need to be implemented which will sufficiently lower world\npopulation size. Some\u2014like Sarah Conly\u2014argue, on this\nbasis, each couple has a right to no more than one child (Conly 2016).\n\n\nAssessing such arguments requires a combination of empirical,\nnormative and political analysis. A first step would be to consider\nall the determinants of climatic harms and to have a\nquantitative analysis of their effects and the extent to which their\necological footprint could be reduced. Such an analysis would include\nnot simply the number of people, but also (1) the levels of\nconsumption, (2) the extent of waste, (3) the nature of the energy\nsystem (does it use renewables or not?), (4) the distribution of\naccess to clean technology, (5) the extent to which energy efficiency\nprogrammes are in place, (6) the extent to which fossil fuels are\nbeing subsidised, (7) the nature of the public transport system, (8)\nthe urban infrastructure and the spatial organisation of cities, (9)\nbuilding design, (10) the extent to which deforestation is reversed,\nand programmes of afforestation and reforestation are pursued, and so\non (Caney 2020). To make a case for a Conly-style conclusion one would\nthen have to show that either:\n\nthe above are insufficient, or\nthe above are (singly or in combination) sufficient but constitute\na less desirable kind of response than limiting procreative choice,\nor, perhaps\nthe above may be sufficient and more desirable than Conly\u2019s\nresponse but they are less politically feasible.\n\n\nAnother challenge facing Conly\u2019s conclusion is that it needs to\nshow that the optimal response turns out to be 1 child per couple and\nthat the same constraint applies equally to all irrespective of the\nsize of their ecological footprint.\n\nEthical concerns about attempts to limit world population have long\nbeen expressed. For example, Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva argued in\nEcofeminism (1993 [2014]) that programmes to limit world\npopulation reinforce control of women\u2019s bodies. Furthermore,\nthey object to proposals to curb world population growth that do not\ncall into question the high consumption lifestyles of affluent\ncountries, and instead convey the morally misleading message that\nresponsibility for the environmental crisis lies with low-emitting\ndeveloping countries (Mies & Vandana 1993 [2014: chapter 19]).\n",
