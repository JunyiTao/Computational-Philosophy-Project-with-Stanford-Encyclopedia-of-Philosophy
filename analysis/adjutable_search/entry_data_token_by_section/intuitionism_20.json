    "main_text": "Philosophy || Phenomenology\n6.1 Phenomenology\n\nThe connection between Intuitionism and Phenomenology, the philosophy\ndeveloped by Edmund Husserl, has been investigated by several authors,\nduring Brouwer\u2019s lifetime as well as decades later. Hermann Weyl\nwas among the first to discuss the relation between Brouwer\u2019s\nideas and the phenomenological view on mathematics. Like Brouwer, Weyl\nspeaks in his book Das Kontinuum (Chapter 2) about the\nintuitive continuum, but Weyl\u2019s notion is based on the\nphenomenology of (the consciousness of) time. Weyl later feels that\nBrouwer\u2019s development of real analysis is more faithful to the\nidea of the intuitive continuum than his own (Weyl 1921) and therefore\nplaces himself at Brouwer\u2019s side, at least regarding this aspect\n(van Atten 2002).\n\nVan Atten (2003 en 2007) uses phenomenology to justify choice\nsequences as mathematical objects. The author (2002) is critical about\nBrouwer\u2019s justification of choice sequences, which is the motive\nto look for a philosophical justification elsewhere. Choice sequences\noccur in the work of Becker (1927) and Weyl, but they differ from\nBrouwer\u2019s notion, and Husserl never discussed choice sequences\npublicly. Van Atten explains how the homogeneity of the\ncontinuum accounts for its inexhaustibility and nonatomicity, two key\nproperties of the intuitive continuum according to Brouwer. Using the\nfact that these two essential properties are present in the definition\nof choice sequences, one arrives at a phenomenological justification\nof them. \n",
