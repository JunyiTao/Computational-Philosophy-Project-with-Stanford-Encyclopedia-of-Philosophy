    "main_text": "Tradition\n11. Paradox of the In-between\n\nThere is a creative tension at play within Gadamer\u2019s aesthetic\nthinking. On the one hand, Gadamer stalwartly defends the autonomy of\nthe artwork and, on the other, despite his resistance to any\nsubsumption of art within philosophy, he insists that aesthetics\nshould be absorbed within hermeneutics, which has\u00a0for the most\npart been understood as a theoretical enterprise. This tension\nreplicates aspects of the so-called hermeneutic circle.\nSchleiermacher, for example, argues that it is only possible to grasp\nan individual\u2019s personal utterances if one can understand the\ngeneral structure of the language which that individual operates\nwithin. Conversely, general structures are only intelligible in terms\nof particular exemplifying utterances. Wilhelm Dilthey operates within\na similar part-whole structure\u2013\u2013namely, an\nindividual\u2019s personal experiences will mean little to the reader\nunless they can be contextualised within a historical context. A\nmovement between part and whole also takes place in Gadamer\u2019s\nthinking. The artwork is initially presented in its singularity. But\nthen, the particular is illuminated by being brought under a\nsubject-matter. To engage with artworks discursively is to bring\ngeneralizations about a work to bear, placing it in a wider context of\nassociations. The movement to the wider level of generalization also\nreturns the spectator to the particular, since generalization enables\nan understanding of what is singular about a work by locating it\nwithin a broader background. This double hermeneutic movement is\nhighly characteristic of Gadamer\u2019s aesthetic. It recognises that\nthe cognitive dimension of aesthetic experience is, like all\nlinguistic experience, both centrifugal and centripetal in nature.\nWhen a work addresses us its impact is centrifugal: it upsets and\ntransforms what we customarily recognise. It awakens us to the\nhermeneutical sublime, to what lies beyond but nevertheless shapes our\nnormal range of understanding. Thus, Gadamer can argue\nthat\u00a0\u201csomething is a poetic structure when everything\npre-structured is taken up into a new, unique form \u2026 as if it\nwere being said for the first time to us in particular\u201d (GW 8,\n62). Yet this estranging moment initiates a centripetal return, a\nhomecoming. \u201cThe poem and the art of language generally as a\nheard or written text is always \u2026 something like a recognition\nin every single word\u201d (GW 8, 62). Yet the question remains: is\nthe passage from the immediacy of the given artwork to theoretical\ncontemplations about its subject matter not an instance of moving from\nthe particular givenness of a work to a more abstract level of\nreflection about its subject-matter? Does not the contemplative\nmovement away from the work betray its particularity and suggest that\nthe sense of a work lies beyond it in its concept? Were Gadamer to\nhave fallen into this impasse, an idealist and\nrepresentationalist account of art would be forced upon him. The\nvehemence of his resistance to these stances suggests that something\nother than a simple shift from the particular immediacy of a work to a\ntheoretical contemplation of its content must be at play.\n\nThe accusation of inconsistency requires the assumption that the\naesthetic experience of a work, on the one hand, and its\ncontemplation, on the other, are separable. However, it is in\nGadamer\u2019s mind part of an intense experience that it impels us\ntowards seeking to bring it into words. Experience endeavours to bring\nitself into words. These words will by virtue of their semantic\nassociations place the experience in a wider context (the centrifugal)\nand at the same time these words will, because of their poetic\ncapacity for singularity, make the experience clearer and more\ndistinct.\n\nExperience is not wordless to begin with, subsequently becoming an\nobject of reflection by being named, by being subsumed under the\nuniversality of the word. Rather experience itself seeks and finds\nwords that express it. We seek the right word\u2014i.e., the word\nthat really belongs to the thing (or experience) so that in it the\nthing comes into language. (TM 417)\n\n\nThis suggests that Gadamer is not applying a hermeneutic method to\naesthetic experience but seeking to expose the hermeneutical movement\nfrom part to whole within aesthetic experience. In other\nwords, the claim that aesthetics should be taken up within\nhermeneutics is not an attempt to reduce aesthetics to another idiom.\nIt announces an endeavor to articulate the hermeneutic dynamic of\naesthetic experience itself. Let us briefly recapitulate the\nargument.\n\nThe tension in Gadamer\u2019s position arises from (1) asserting\nart\u2019s autonomy and (2) demanding that aesthetics be subsumed\nwithin hermeneutics. Undoubtedly, the weight of argument is on the\nlatter. He systematically criticizes Kantian aesthetics for its\nnarrow-minded concentration on the subjectivity of momentary pleasures\nand offers in its place a substantial reconstruction of the cognitive\ncontent of art\u2019s address. In other words, Gadamer switches the\nstatus of autonomy from the sensible irreducibility of a work to its\nhermeneutic autonomy. This entails the argument that a work which\nchallenges our outlook does so because it is enigmatic by nature: it\ngives rise to difficulties of meaning and interpretation which cannot\nbe explained away by a more fundamental level of understanding. The\nautonomous work that stands in itself is a work that both\npresents a meaning and at the same time holds\nsomething back. It is in other words always pointing beyond\nitself but within itself. This substantiates Gadamer\u2019s\nclaim that the hermeneutical constitution of an autonomous work\nresists theoretical reduction. In the essay \u201cWord and\nPicture,\u201d he expresses sympathy with Schleiermacher\u2019s\nremark, \u201cI hate all theory that does not grow out of\npractice\u201d (GW 8, 374). However, as has been argued, the\ntranscendent dimensions of meaning which a work speculatively invokes\nare not outside the work but immanent within it. In other words, we do\nnot need a special hermeneutic method to access the withheld but just\na deeper, more attentive contemplative acquaintance. When Gadamer\nspeaks of being attentive to what an artwork says, of discerning its\nenigmatic quality, and of becoming aware of its speculative\nresonances, he is indeed speaking in a hermeneutical idiom, but this\nis most clearly not a case of Gadamer submitting aesthetic experience\nto an externally derived theory. To the contrary, Gadamer is trying to\ndraw out the hermeneutical dynamics of aesthetic experience itself.\nThus the tension between the immediacy of experience and reflection\nupon the content of that experience is not a tension between\nexperience, on the one hand, and theory on the other. It is a tension\nwithin aesthetic experience between what an artwork invokes of its\nsubject-matter and how what is invoked changes the character of that\nwhich invokes it. What hermeneutical reflection reveals of aesthetic\nexperience is nothing extraneous to such experience but a further\ndisclosure of what is held within it. To conclude, if aesthetic\nexperience is hermeneutical in that artworks speculatively illuminate\nmeanings beyond what is immediately disclosed, hermeneutical\nexperience should equally be taken up by aesthetics in that\nsubject-matters only manifest their presence in the singular and\nparticular.\n",
