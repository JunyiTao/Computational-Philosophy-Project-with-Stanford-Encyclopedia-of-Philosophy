The Sanskrit term \u2018\u0101tman\u2019\nproperly translated as self stands for whatever it is that is the\nessence of individual humans (manu\u1e63ya) or the\npsychophysical complex (pudgala) which includes the mind,\nbody and sense organs. There is disagreement among the philosophical\nschools about whether the essence is a substantial soul or pure\nconsciousness and whether there is such an essence at all. The\nBuddhist no-self theorists and the C\u0101rv\u0101ka materialists deny\nthat there is any such essence, the psychophysical complex is all\nthere is. Finding an equivalent term across the classical Indian\nphilosophical schools that properly can be translated as person is a\nbit more challenging. The concept of \u2018pudgala\u2019\nused to signify the psychophysical complex as whole in Buddhist\nphilosophy is properly translated as person. But\n\u2018pudgala\u2019 is not used with this strict meaning\nacross the philosophical spectrum. The Jaina philosophers use it as an\nequivalent for matter or material object. There are several terms in\nSanskrit, for example, \u2018j\u012bva-\u0101tma\u2019,\n\u2018puru\u1e63a\u2019,\n\u2018manu\u1e63ya\u2019 which are often used to indicate\npersons, but these terms have wider meanings and do not apply strictly\nto persons. The lack of an exact equivalent in Sanskrit does not,\nhowever, mean that the concept of personhood was not central to\nclassical Indian philosophies other than Buddhism.\n\nA primary concern that motivated most philosophers in ancient India\nwas to find the best way forward in an individual person\u2019s quest\nfor liberation from suffering. All living beings are trapped in the\ncycle of birth and rebirth (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) which\naccording to most classical Indian philosophers, is characterised by\nsuffering. The highest goal of life is liberation\n(mok\u1e63a or nirv\u0101\u1e47a). Except the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka materialists who believed that death is the end and\nthere is nothing like rebirth or liberation, all other philosophical\nschools believed in the possibility of liberation in this life or in\nfuture lifetimes. The ultimate aim of the classical Indian philosophy\nteachings is thus to help individual persons attain liberation or at\nleast a better life in this life and future lifetimes. Most classical\nIndian philosophers agreed that our ignorance about \u201cwho we\nreally are\u201d is the source and the means to bringing an end to\nsuffering. Thus, metaphysical debates about the nature of individual\npersons and the universe and our place in it are central to the\nclassical Indian philosophical traditions. These debates, however,\ntended to focus on the essence of persons, the self\n(\u0101tman) or the soul substance.\n\nThis is in contrast with contemporary Western philosophy where\nquestions about personal identity and its normative significance are\nat the forefront at least since Parfit (1984). In Section 2, we turn\nbriefly to the contemporary debates about personal identity and\nreflect on how they might benefit from paying attention to the\ndiscussions of personhood in classical Indian philosophy. But before\nwe attempt that, in Sections 1 and 2, we describe the different\nconceptions of personhood in classical Indian philosophy. As I said,\nthere is not much explicit discussion of personhood, so most of the\ntime I draw out the conceptions of persons from other discussions that\nimplicitly refers to persons.\n", "toc": [{"#ClasIndiConcPers": "1.

Classical Indian Conceptions of Persons\n1.1 Vedic Conception of Persons: Upani\u1e63ads\n\nHindu philosophical schools develop their philosophical position as an\nattempt to interpret and defend the various metaphysical theses that\nare found in the Vedas (the foundational Hindu scriptures) and more\nspecifically the Upani\u1e63ads. The Upani\u1e63ads, literally\n\u201cthe last chapters, parts of the Veda\u201d, are often thought\nof as expressing the crux or the purpose of the Veda. The concept of\n\u0101tman (soul, self) as the essence of individual persons\nand knowledge of that \u0101tman is the central focus in all of the\nUpanishads. The self (\u0101tman) is primarily conceived of\nin the Upani\u1e63ads as a pure subject of experiences, detached from\nthe objects of its consciousness, enduring and changeless and separate\nand independent of its mental and physical states. In the\nB\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, the sage\nY\u0101j\u00f1avalkya says\n\n\nThe sages call it the eternal self. It is neither big nor small,\nneither long nor short, neither hot nor cold, neither bright nor dark,\nneither air nor space. It is without attachment, without taste, smell,\nor touch, without eyes, ears, tongue, mouth, breath, or mind, without\nmovement, without limitation, without inside or outside. It consumes\nnothing, and nothing consumes it.\n\nThe Self is the seer, Gargi, though unseen; the hearer, though\nunheard; the thinker, though unthought; the knower, though unknown.\nNothing other than the Self can see, hear, think, or know (BU 3.7, 8,\n11).\n\n\nThis picture of the self as a witnessing subject is in sharp contrast\nwith another Upani\u1e63adic conception: that of persons as agents,\nthe doers and the enjoyers of the fruits of their actions. This\nconception of persons is also found in the\nB\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad:\n\nWhat a man turns out to be depends on how he acts and on how he\nconducts himself. If his actions are good, he will turn into something\ngood. If his actions are bad, he will turn into something bad. A man\nturns into something good by good action and into something bad by bad\naction. And so people say: \u201cA person here consists simply of\ndesire.\u201d A man resolves in accordance with his desire, acts in\naccordance with his resolve, and turns out to be in accordance with\nhis action. (BU 4.4, 5)\n\n\nAnd again, in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, we find\ntalk of person as an embodied soul. Chapter 5 explains the cycle of\nbirth and rebirth of individual persons as process of soul (self)\nbecoming embodied as a result of being entangled in the material\nqualities (Gu\u1e47as):\n\nOnly he [the person] who gets attached to the pleasurable qualities of\nthings does work for the sake of its fruits, and enjoys the fruits of\nhis own deeds. Though really the master of the senses, he becomes\nbound by Gu\u1e47as, and assuming various forms, wanders\nabout the three paths as a result of his own deeds.\n\n\nBy desire, contact, sight and delusion, the embodied soul assumes\nsuccessively various forms in various places according to his deeds,\njust as the body grows nourished by showers of food and drink.\n\n\nThe embodied soul chooses many forms, gross and subtle, based on the\nqualities belonging to himself, to the actions and to the mind. The\ncause of their combination is found to be still another. (\u015aVU 5.\n7, 10, 11)\n\n\nThe agential conception of persons assumes the Vedic doctrine of\nkarma, so it deserves to a short explication. The doctrine of\nkarma has two dimensions: a moral cosmology and a\npsychological dimension (Phillips 1997, 329). According to the thesis\nof moral cosmology, actions have immediate as well as non-immediate\nconsequences. The latter embody a moral dimension: good actions result\nin rewards, bad actions in punishments in the form of karmic\nresidues which ripen and bear fruit in this lifetime or in future\nlifetimes. According to the psychological thesis, actions create a\ntendency, a disposition to repeat that act. The two dimensions\ntogether might seem to entail fatalism, bad actions result in\nacquisition of bad karmic residues and bad habits that\ndispose the agent to repeat the same offences with the result that the\nagent is doomed to inferior rebirths with no possibility of liberation\nfrom the cycle of birth and rebirth. This impression is mistaken. The\nindividual person is free at all times to break the bad habits and\nperform novel good actions in accordance with duty (dharma)\nand thereby inculcate the right dispositions that incline the agent to\ngood actions and superior births and finally liberation. There is an\nimportant caveat though, \u201cduty has to be performed for the sake\nof duty alone\u201d not because of attachment to pleasures or fruits\nof actions because that results in bondage of the soul to the material\nqualities and many different rebirths follow. The quality of the\ndeeds, good or bad, determines the kind of embodiment (physical and\npsychological characteristics, caste), length of life, quality of\nexperiences, dreams and much else that is to be endured by person\nwhile it is entrapped in the cycle of birth and rebirth. Although the\nsoul is thought of as the controller of the senses, once it is\nembodied, the qualities of material form have the habit of taking over\nand driving individual persons on account of their attachments to\nsensual pleasures. And it is on account of the quality of its actions\nand their karmic fruits, in this birth, that the embodied\nsoul is reborn in (another) new form. The only way out of suffering in\nthe perpetual the cycle of birth and rebirth is knowledge the real\nnature of the individual person and its entanglement in the material\nworld.\n\nThe Upani\u1e63adic philosophers recognize the conception of the self\nas the pure detached subject of experiences separate and unaffected by\nthe material world (niv\u1e5btti) and the person as an\nactive agent engaged with the material world\n(prav\u1e5btti). The niv\u1e5btti tradition is the\nexemplified in the later Upani\u1e63adic renunciant tradition and is\nalso developed by Hindu schools such as the Ved\u0101nta and\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga. In contrast the prav\u1e5btti\ntradition exemplified in the Vedic ritualistic tradition is\ndeveloped by the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 schools. This difference in emphasis is\nalso brought out in the various paths to liberation: the path of\naction (karma yoga) and the path of knowledge\n(j\u00f1\u0101na yoga). The niv\u1e5btti\ntradition stresses the importance of knowledge of the self\n(\u0101tma-vidy\u0101) sometimes equated with mystical\nawareness of Brahman (brahma-vidy\u0101). This, according to\nUpani\u1e63ads, is the most promising route to the supreme good,\nliberation (mok\u1e63a). But it is not exclusive or\nindependent of karma yoga, because knowledge of the self will\nresult in transformation of a person\u2019s attitudes towards sensual\npleasure and earthly goods, and desires which contribute to action.\nAnd conversely, the training in karma yoga together with the\ndoctrine of rebirth and transmigration will result in a transformation\nof how the person views the self.\n\nThe Upani\u1e63adic conception of person is that of an\n\u2018embodied soul\u2019. The soul is essence of the person and it\nis what makes us the same person over time (possibly even across\nlifetimes). The Hindu schools defend what is contemporary philosophers\ncall the Non-Reductionist view of persons. According to the\nNon-Reductionist view, the continued existence of persons is a deep,\nfurther fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity, and\na fact that holds completely or not at all (Parfit 1984, 445). Parfit\nnotes that a Cartesian Ego, would be one such entity. The soul\n(\u0101tman) as described by the Vedas and explicated by\nHindu would be another. These ideas from the Upani\u1e63ads are\ndeveloped into various conceptions of persons by the Hindu\nphilosophical schools which will be discussed in turn Sections 1.2 and\n1.3 before we turn to unorthodox conceptions in Section 1.4.\n1.2 Spiritual Conceptions of Persons\n\nThe Ved\u0101nta and S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga is the most important\nschool that develop the spiritual and mystical insights in the\nUpani\u1e63ads. The Advaita Ved\u0101nta is well-known for upholding\nmonism, there is only one reality and that is Brahman. Furthermore,\nthe Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophers argue that the individual self\nand the supreme Self (Brahman) are identical. The plurality\nof the external world of everyday experience is explained away as an\nillusory projection (m\u0101y\u0101), a cosmic illusion which\nis a product of our ignorance. The nature of this self is simply pure\nconsciousness. Self, according to the Advaita Ved\u0101nta is not to\nbe understood as a substance that has the property of consciousness\nbut rather it is consciousness itself, the principle of illumination\nor manifestation (praka\u0304s\u0301a). This consciousness\nmanifests all things. Just as without the sunlight, the universe would\nbe shrouded in darkness, similarly without consciousness nothing would\nbe known or manifested\u2019 (Gupta 2003: 31\u20132; cf. 106).\nAccording to the Advaitins,\n\nconsciousness has no form, no content; its only function, like that of\nlight, is to show the object on which it is focused\u2026. The\nAdvaitins argue that, that which manifests everything cannot have the\nform of any particular thing; manifestation is its only function.\n(Gupta 2003: 119\u201320)\n\n\nThe Advaita Veda\u0304nta thesis is that this consciousness is what a\nperson is at the most fundamental level, the self\n(a\u0304tman). But as far as my sense of myself as a person\nis concerned, I take myself to be a psychophysical thing among others,\nhaving certain properties and relations, such as belonging to a\ncertain family (caste, according to the Hindus) and having a certain\nsocial role. The Advaita Veda\u0304nta philosophers argue that this\nsense of self is a result of a false identification with aspects of\nthe projected world. Person (an empirical self in their terminology)\nin their sense has no ultimate reality, it is merely another\nprojection of the cosmic illusion. Though the person is ordinarily\nexperienced as a particular entity in the world and standing in\nmanifold relations to other entities, it is dismissed as a product of\nignorance. Their concern is with the \u2018self/supreme Self\u2019\nidentity and with self-knowledge as the most promising route to\nliberation (mok\u1e63a). Once we understand the true nature\nof ourselves, primarily through the study of the Upani\u1e63ads\ncomplemented by the practice of meditation, we will grasp that essence\nof an individual (a\u0304tman) is identical with the real\nSelf (Brahman). The person or empirical self will fall away\nas merely an illusory projection of consciousness.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga schools draw inspiration for their\nmetaphysics of persons from the Upani\u1e63ads and develop the\ninsight that the real essence of a person is the soul or in\nS\u0101\u1e43khya terminology, the Spirit (puru\u1e63a).\nBut unlike the Veda\u0304nta, the S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga\nphilosophers do not regard the multiplicity of true persons as a mere\nillusion. They speak of the absolute puru\u1e63a\n(\u012b\u015bvara) and individual puru\u1e63as\n(j\u012bvas). Verse 18 of the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 offers a proof and\nexplanation for the existence of multiplicity of real persons\n\nThe incidence of birth and death and the action of the sense faculties\ndifferent for different individuals; all people not having the same\ninclinations at the same time; the thoughts arising out of the action\nof the three gu\u1e47as being different for different people \u2013\nit follows that souls (puru\u1e63as) are many (each person\nhaving a separate soul). (Translation adapted from Radhanath Phukan\n1960).\n\n\nEvery individual person (j\u012bva) is a manifestation or\ninstantiation of the absolute puru\u1e63a, which is present\nas an undivided whole in every person. The puru\u1e63a is\nthus the universal aspect in virtue of which we are persons. But each\nindividual person is also a finite particular. The particular aspect\nof an individual person is derived from the material form or nature\n(prak\u1e5bti ) which supplies the physical body and its\nadjuncts (sense organs, etc.). Nature (prak\u1e5bti) works\nthrough three gu\u1e47as which are its functional forces,\nknown as existence or beingness (sattva), force of bringing\nabout change (rajas), and force for restrains change\n(tamas). Sattva exhibits the physical characteristic\nof buoyancy and illumination, and the psychological characteristic of\npleasure. Rajas exhibits the physical characteristic of\nstimulation and movement and the psychological characteristics of pain\nand passion. Tamas exhibits the physical characteristic of\nweight and resistance and the characteristics of dejection and\ndespondency. The disturbance in the equipoise of the three\ngu\u1e47as starts the process of evolution which is the\nprocess of creation. As explained in the quote above, each individual\nperson is a unique composition of gu\u1e47as that determine\nher physical and psychological characteristics, for example those with\na predominance of tamas will be naturally disposed to resist\nchange and activity.\n\nAccording to S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers, the relation between\nprak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a in an individual\nperson is said to be eternal and irresolvable. This raises a problem\nfor the S\u0101\u1e43khya, namely, how are we to explain the bondage\n(coming together) of prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a\n(soul), and how is the final release liberation of\npuru\u1e63a possible? The clue lies in understanding the\nprocess of evolution. Verse 21 of the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 offers a succinct\nanswer:\n\nFor the sake of puru\u1e63a\u2019s perception of\nprak\u1e5bti and for the sake of his release, a union of the\ntwo takes place, which resembles the union of the lame and the blind\n(translation adapted from Majumdar 1930, 77).\n\n\nThe author of the K\u0101rik\u0101 makes use of an analogy\noften exploited in classical Indian philosophy, of the union of the\nlame and the blind who happen to encounter each other and decide to\ncooperate for their mutual benefit which is to reach their desired\ndestination (metaphorically liberation). The lame man (soul) mounts\nthe shoulders of the blind man (matter) and directs both to the\ndesired destination. And, just as the blind man and the lame man part\ncompany when they reach their mutual destination, so do soul and\nmatter. Creation of an individual person results from the desire to\nperceive and experience prak\u1e5bti and her manifestations\nin the form of sensual pleasures derived from material objects.\nCreation is more properly understood as evolution of\nprak\u1e5bti to reveal her many forms to the soul for the\nsake of his enjoyment, even though the union of prak\u1e5bti\nand puru\u1e63a is eternal. Bondage results in the soul\nbeing tricked by the various forms of prak\u1e5bti\nespecially the ego-sense (aha\u1e43k\u0101ra) and the\nphysical body to the extent of identifying with these material forms\nas part of the soul. This identification results in the soul\nforgetting its true nature and being totally spell-bound by\nprak\u1e5bti and the many pleasures afforded by material\nforms. This forgetfulness results in alienation of the soul which\ncauses in unhappiness and misery. Most of us, ordinary persons, are in\nfact in this situation. But because the enjoyment of the material\nforms and the union of matter and soul is tainted with suffering and\npain, persons seek liberation. The way out for an individual person is\nto dispel the delusion of the soul by developing the right kind of\npsychical conditions. The right kind of psychical development requires\nproper moral and religious training though it may take an inordinately\nlong time, possibly many rebirths. The end of the delusion also means\nthe end of bondage and with it goes all unhappiness and misery.\nLiberation of the soul consists in indifference towards the\nmanifestation of prak\u1e5bti and with it the renunciation\nof many sensual pleasures and material objects. The puru\u1e63a thus\nreturns to its native enlightened state of bliss. (For an elaborate\naccount of such a delusion and its consequences, see the\n\u015a\u0101ntiparvan of the M\u0101h\u0101bh\u0101rata, Chapter 302\n(verse 41\u201349) and Chapter 303).\n\nThe Yoga school shares much with the S\u0101\u1e43khya regarding the\nnature of the true self and the individual person, differing in its\nemphasis on the yogic practices (psychophysical techniques centering\non meditation) as the means of discovering the true nature of the real\nself. The S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga philosophers disagree with the\nAdvaitic thesis that individual persons (j\u012bvas) are only\ndelusions, but agree that the true self, the essence of the person is\nthe soul or consciousness untainted by matter. There is no value to\ndevelopment of persons as such, according to these spiritual\nphilosophies, the only activity worthy of pursuit is the search for\nthe true self.\n1.3 Worldly Persons\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers differ from the philosophers of Advaita-Ved\u0101nta in\nthat they emphasise the reality of distinct many distinct individual\npersons (j\u012bva). However, because of their allegiance to\nthe Vedas there is not much explicit discussion of persons, the focus\nis on the search for is the essence of persons (\u0101tman)\nand their pursuit of the highest good, liberation\n(mok\u1e63a). Ordinary persons are embodied souls, according\nto these philosophers. The soul (\u0101tman) is the essence\nof the person; the mind, body and the senses are merely adjuncts. The\nsoul is a distinct and independent substance, possessing the property\nof consciousness. The philosophers belonging to\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\ntraditions, contra the spiritual philosophers, emphasized that the\nsoul is not just an experiencer but more importantly an agent \u2013\na knower and a doer and enjoyer (of karmic consequences).\nBut, one may ask how might a disembodied separate soul substance be a\ndoer and knower and enjoyer? We return this question below in the\ndiscussion of these views.\n\nThe focus of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is on the self rather\nthan the person. The individual self (j\u012bva-\u0101tma is\ntheir preferred term) occupies a central place in the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ontology. Selves are really distinct\nindividuals and do not merge into one ultimate reality at liberation.\nMuch attention has been paid to the Ny\u0101ya arguments for the\nexistence of the self, the ways of knowing the self, the\ncharacteristics of the self and the means to liberation. Let us begin\nby noting Nya\u0304ya-su\u0304tra 1.1.10, which provides the\nfamous \u2018characteristics of the self\u2019 as well as the basis\nof the inferential proof for the existence of the self:\n\nDesire, aversion, volition (prayatna), pleasure, pain, and\ncognition are characteristics of the self. (NS 1.1.10)\n\n\nDasti writes that for Nya\u0304ya, agency is a special expression of\nthe self\u2019s different capacities and potentialities, which\ncoherently ties together all its distinctive characteristics (2013,\n114). Dasti is right to emphasise that the Ny\u0101ya self is much\nmore than a subject of experience, that it is more importantly an\nagent \u2013 a doer and a knower. But Dasti and others in\ncontemporary literature fail to emphasise that the distinctive\nqualities (vi\u015be\u1e63a) of the self, desire, cognition,\npain, etc., are transitory and come into existence only when the self\nis in contact with the mind-sense organs-body complex. The\nsubstance-quality distinction which is the hallmark of Ny\u0101ya\nontology, and an important tool that accounts for all the goods\nafforded by the Ny\u0101ya postulation of the self as distinct\nsubstance. As Dasti puts it:\n\nNya\u0304ya\u2019s account of personhood involves substances and\nproperties: an enduring substantial self with its fluctuating,\nworld-engaging properties like memory, awareness, and volition allow\nfor full personhood. Like Sa\u0304m\u0323khya, Nya\u0304ya allows for\na self which endures through time, survives bodily death, and\nparticipates in ultimate liberation. But like the Buddhists,\nNya\u0304ya\u2019s person is directly engaged in the world. We are\nhere now (2013: 135).\n\n\nDasti rightly uses the term personhood as signifying the self together\nwith its properties and talks about person (rather than the self) as\ndirectly engaged in the world, but he fails to note that the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account is plagued with problems.\nProblems arise when we pay attention to the fact that according to the\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, although the self is a substance which is\nseparate from the mind-sense organs-body complex, the self is totally\ndependent on this complex for its functionality. The mind-sense\norgans-body contact is needed to engender cognition, desire, etc., the\nself cannot bring cognition into being by itself. Reflection and\nmemory too require the self to be in contact with the mind. Even the\neffort of the self is induced by the mind-sense-body contact, so it\nseems that the self cannot initiate any activity by itself. Self by\nitself is causally impotent (this is, indeed, exactly the Buddhist\nargument against the existence of the Ny\u0101ya self). It seems that\nthe self by itself is just a bearer of its distinctive qualities which\nare induced by mind-sense organs-body contact. It is merely the\npassive observer of activity and remote carrier of the mediate\n(karmic) consequences of actions. Therefore, it is not the\nself by itself but the embodied self or person that is the agent, doer\nand originator of all actions and the enjoyer of the results of the\naction.\n\nFurthermore, the distinctive qualities of the self are not its\nessential qualities. The self is without its qualities temporarily\nduring sleep and similar states and loses these qualities permanently\nin the state of liberation (mok\u1e63a). The self in the state of\nliberation is totally lacking in consciousness, Dravid describing it\nas \u2018an insentient stone-like condition\u2019 (1995, 1). The\nfirm separation between the self and its qualities means that even\nthough the latter are always changing, the self is totally unaffected\nby these changes. The Buddhist objects if the self remains totally\nunaffected by changes in its qualities it would not be able to\nregister the changes, that is to say that the self by itself would not\nbe able to perceive those changes (Watson, 2018, 337). This robs the\nself of its status as the cognizer (j\u00f1\u0101t\u1e5b);\nit is rather the embodied worldly self or persons that perceive. So,\nit seems that the Ny\u0101ya self by itself can\u2019t even be an\nexperiencer. To ensure that self can really live up to its job\ndescription as an agent and experiencer the Ny\u0101ya discussion\nshould have been focused on the embodied wordly self or person that is\nthe agent (kart\u1e5b), enjoyer (bh\u014dkt\u1e5b)\nand cognizer (j\u00f1\u0101t\u1e5b), rather than the\nself.\n\nMost Ny\u0101ya philosophers claim that the agential self is not\nperceived but can only be inferred from the actions of the body. The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers offer the analogy of\ninferring the driver of a chariot when you see it moving along the\nroad, avoiding potholes and other moving vehicles and persons. The\nanalogy might remind us of Descartes\u2019 analogy of a sailor in the\nship. But as Descartes pointed out in the sixth Meditation that the\nconnection between self (conceived of as the referent of\n\u2018I\u2019) and body has to be much more intimate than that of a\nsailor in the ship, otherwise the self would not feel pain when the\nbody was hurt, but would merely perceive the damage just as a sailor\nperceives by sight if his ship is broken (Cottingham, 1996, 56). The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika self in the driver\u2019s seat,\nindependent and separate from the chariot (body), doesn\u2019t quite\ndo justice to the relationship between the self and its body.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya philosophers have two options at this point. They must\ngive up on the notion of the self as a separate substance untouched by\nits qualities. The talk of the remote self needs to be replaced with\nembodied selves (or persons). Or, they need to conceive of the self in\nthe way the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 do as more\nclosely connected with its qualities, so that it can undergo\nmodification. The second option is available, but does it suffice? We\nwill revisit this question after drawing out the conception of person\nimplicit in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\n\nThe stated goal of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 is to interpret the\nstatements of the Vedas, and thus to provide specific guidance to\nHindus for performing the rituals and sacrifices they enjoin. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers agree with other Hindu\nschools that the true self that we cognize in self-recognition is a\nsingle thing that remains identical over time and thus it cannot be\nidentified with the mind, body and the sense organs (See Taber 1992\nfor the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 argument for a self). There is\nnot much discussion of their notion of a person directly in the texts.\nHowever, there is implicit discussion of wordly persons in the context\nof the performance of duty (dharma) and religious rituals. A\nperson is one who performs the rituals and follows the\ndharma, the doer of the deeds and enjoyer of the fruits of\nthe deeds in accordance with the karma doctrine. Every religious\nritual or sacrifice, according to the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers, is said to have a specific result and characterized by\nan eligible persons (adhik\u0101ra) (Freschi, et al. 2019).\nThe eligibility identifies the person who is enjoined by the Vedas to\nperform a religious ritual or sacrifice, has the means to perform it\nand will be the bearer of the karmic result accrued on\naccount of the performance. This is particularly relevant in the\ncontext of Vedic sacrifices, since they always include many\nperformers. An eligible person (adhik\u0101rin) is the one\nwho is enjoined by the Vedas to perform the sacrifice and entitled to\nits result; the former implies that one can hear or read a Vedic\ninjunction and understand oneself as the addressee, which, in turn,\nimplies that one belongs to one of the social groups that is\ntraditionally expected to study the Vedas. Being eligible further\nimplies having physical ability (see Exegetic Aphorisms\n6.1.42) and material resources (Exegetic Aphorisms\n6.7.18\u201320) to organize the performance of a sacrifice (Freschi,\net al. 2019). The latter, the entitlement to the result of the\nsuccessful performance of a sacrifice is automatically guaranteed by\nthe law of karma. This notion of a person implicit in this discussion\nof injunctions by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers suggests\nthat persons are embodied beings, belonging to a certain social class,\npossessing material wealth or otherwise, the bearers of\nkarmic residues and the enjoyers of karmic\nresults.\n\nThe Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, specifically\nKum\u0101rila, argues that the self can undergo transformation even\nthough it is eternal. Pleasure, pain etc. are qualities of the self,\nchanges in these qualities entail a change in the self, but it is mere\nqualitative change. The self can be transformed but it remains\nnumerically identical through the change in its qualities. Some\naspects of the self are permanent, for example its consciousness,\nexistence and substantiality, but other aspects such as pleasure, pain\netc. undergo change. The self, Kum\u0101rila says, can be compared to\na piece of gold that can be remoulded into a necklace or earrings or a\ngold coin. The stuff of which the self is composed is eternal, just\nlike the eternal gold atoms. The self can change, but to count as the\nsame self there can be no change in whatsoever in its essence, it must\nremain the very same substance. In this sense, the self remains a pure\nsubject untainted by physicality. The Vedic assumption that the self\nis a separate soul substance is difficult to square with the\nconception of the self as cognizer, agent and the enjoyer. The Hindu\nphilosophers who want to maintain this conception must reject the\nassumption of an eternal separate soul substance. An embodied self or\nperson, by contrast, is a more suitable candidate for it can be the\ncognizer and characterized by agency and by enjoyment.\n2. Unorthodox Conceptions of Persons\n2.1 Jaina\n\nAmong the non-Hindu traditions, we begin with Jaina conception of\npersons because it is closest to the Hindu conception, specifically\nthat of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and\nS\u0101\u1e43khya schools. Like the S\u0101\u1e43khya, the Jainas\nare essentially dualistic. The universe is constituted by two kinds of\nthings: living (j\u012bva) and non-living\n(aj\u012bva) akin to puru\u1e63a anf\nprak\u1e5bti. The self is described in Jaina from the\nnoumenal and the phenomenal points of view. From the ultimate or\nnoumenal points of view the self or the soul is pure and perfect,\ncharacterised by pure consciousness. It is a simple, immaterial and\nformless substance. From the phenomenal point of view, the soul is\ndescribed as life force (pr\u0101na) which in conjunction the\nnon-living forces is manifested in various life forms, including human\npersons. The Jainas posit only four non-living (aj\u012bva)\nforces: matter or pudgala which is manifested as karma, time, space\nand movement (Kalghatgi, 1965). The coming together of these things is\nthe Jaina conception of life as pervading all aspects of the natural\nworld. Each life-form stands within a hierarchy of ascent from\nelemental beings, microbes and plants, worms, insects and the array of\nfish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals all the way to persons. The\nnature of the next birth is dependent of the actions performed in the\nimmediate past body, plants and microbes can be reborn higher up in\nthe hierarchy, or mammals can be demoted to lower forms. Persons too\ndepending on whether their actions are virtuous or vicious can be\nreborn in a heavenly realm, or suffer torture in one of the seven\nhells. Persons at the top of the hierarchy, are unique in that they\nare able to perform the karmic necessary purgations to attain\nfreedom or liberation (kevala), the highest end which is\nbreak free from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The story so far is\nnot very different from what we find in the Hindu texts, except that\nkarma is literally a material force.\n\nThe Jainas also agree with the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 that the essence and the qualities of the\nself are not totally separate from each other. They are two aspects of\nthe same thing: one and the same self substance is unchanging and\neternal when viewed from one point of view, and changing when viewed\nfrom another point of view. Its permanence is indexed to its essence\nand its impermanence to its qualities to allow for the very same self\nto be transformed through the cycle of birth and rebirth. Though there\nis much similarity between Jaina and the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view, there is a curious difference. The\nJainas think that though the self is immaterial, it changes it size\naccording to the body with which it is associated. The self, so to\nsay, fits the body it is housed in.\n\nAgain, though there is not much explicit discussion of persons in the\nJaina tradition, the notion of a person is present as a moral agent\nwith the capacity for attaining the highest freedom or liberation.\nPersons alone have the capacity to escape the cycle of birth and\nrebirth. Moral agency requires sensitivity to the nature of our world,\naccording to which all living beings are said to be interconnected.\nThis brings with it a moral obligation to respect all living beings\nincluding plants and not be unscrupulous in using natural resources.\nWhat makes us the same person over time is the soul substance, so the\nJainas would also be classified as Non-Reductionists about persons in\ncontemporary parlance.\n2.2 Buddhist\n\nThe next group of philosophers to consider in this section are the\nBuddhists. The Buddhist tradition is unique in having a clear concept\nof a person as distinct from a self. Mark Siderits sums up the\nBuddhist distinction between persons and selves succinctly: \u201cBy\n\u2018self\u2019 (a\u0304tman) they understand whatever\ncounts as the essence of the psychophysical complex, while by\n\u2018person\u2019 (pudgala) they understand the\npsychophysical complex as a whole\u201d (2019, 303). It is well-known\nthat the Buddhists reject the self, but it is not so well known that\nsome Buddhists defended the reality of persons. There are many\ndifferent Buddhist schools and the most well-known for an ardent\ndefenders of persons, against fellow Buddhists, are called\nPudgalav\u0101dins or personalists. The main impetus for the\nintroduction of persons in Buddhist philosophy, in the absence of\nselves, is the need for a bearer of moral responsibility. We need a\nbearer to support the notion of moral responsibility, which is a\nconstitutive element of their theory of karma and rebirth. Buddhists\nbelieve in rebirth without appeal to transmigration of self. All\nBuddhists allude to the Buddha\u2019s talk of persons in the\nBha\u0304raha\u0304rasu\u0304tra (the su\u0304tra on\nthe bearer of the burden) as one of the most important reasons to\nconsider the question about the reality of persons. The text reads as\nfollows:\n\nI am going to teach you, O monks, the burden, the taking up of the\nburden, the laying down of the burden, and the bearer of the burden.\nListen to it, pay attention carefully and well. I am going to speak.\nOf what does the burden consist? It consists of the five constituents\nto which one clings. Which five? The constituent to which one clings\nthat consists of corporeality, [and] the [four] constituents to which\none clings that consist of [affective] sensation, ideation, the\nconditioning factors, and cognition. Of what does the taking up of the\nburden consist? It consists of craving, which leads to rebirth [and]\nwhich, accompanied by desire for joys, takes delight here and there.\nOf what does the laying down of the burden consist? It is the total\nelimination, the abandonment, the removal, the exhaustion, the\navoidance, the cessation, the extinction, and the disappearance of\nthat very craving which leads to rebirth [and] which, accompanied by\ndesire for joys, takes delight here and there. Of what does the bearer\nof the burden consist? One could say: \u2018A person\u2019, i.e.,\nthat sir who has such a name, who has such an origin(/birth), who\nbelongs to such a family(/lineage), who has such a livelihood, who\nexperiences such pleasure and pain, who has such a long life span, who\nremains for such a long time, whose life has such an end. [I have\nthus] answered to what I [promised to] say, i.e., \u201cI am going to\nteach you, O monks, the burden, the taking up of the burden, the\nlaying down of the burden, and the bearer of the burden\u201d. The\nBlessed One said this. Having said this, the Sugata, the Teacher,\nfurther said this: \u201cHaving laid down the heavy burden, one would\nnot take up another one, [for] taking up the burden is suffering,\n[while] laying down the burden is bliss. Having, due to the exhaustion\nof all fetters, eliminated all craving [and] thoroughly known all\nsubstrates [of existence], one no [longer] falls into rebirth.\u201d\n(Eltschinger 2014: 457).\n\n\nThe originality of this su\u0304tra lies in introducing the\nnotion of a burden-bearer (bha\u0304raha\u0304ra) defined as\na \u2018person\u2019 (pudgala). In the text, the term\n\u2018burden\u2019 is interpreted as desire or craving that is the\nroot cause of morally wrong action, which in turn is the cause of\nrebirth and suffering according to the Buddhist doctrine of karma. The\nperson is introduced in the original su\u0304tra as the\nbearer of moral desert.\n\nThe controversy over persons raged among Indian Buddhists for more\nthan a millennium. The question is whether the \u2018person\u2019 in\nthe su\u0304tra is to be interpreted as ultimately real, as\nPudgalava\u0304dins (Personalists) did, or, as only conventionally\nreal, as the mainstream Abhidharma Buddhists did. According to the\nAbhidharma doctrine, the only things that are ultimately real are the\nindivisible, momentary physical and mental dharmas (best understood as\ntropes; see Ganeri 2001). Everything else that can be decomposed into\nparts, physically or conceptually, is only conventionally real.\nSiderits explains the \u0100bhidharmika position thus:\n\nA statement is said to be ultimately true iff it corresponds to how\nthings are independently of the concepts one happens to employ. Such a\nstatement can neither assert nor presuppose the existence of any\ncomposite entity\u2026 . Many entities in people\u2019s folk\nontology are not ultimately real: chariots, forests, trees, pots, and\nso on. Such entities are said to be conventionally real, mere\nconceptual fictions. (2019: 314)\n\n\nDifferent schools in the Indian Buddhist tradition have different\nstrategies for making sense of the Buddha\u2019s thought and talk of\npersons. The Pudgalava\u0304dins are alone in holding that persons are\nultimately or substantially real. The dispute between the\nPudgalava\u0304dins and their opponents is not just an attempt to lay\nclaim to \u2018what the Buddha taught\u2019, but it is also\nmotivated by philosophical considerations about consistency with the\nno-self doctrine and other important Buddhist theses, for example\nimpermanence, dependent origination, and the karma theory.\nThe Pudgalava\u0304din position on persons is best placed in the\nEmergentist camp, they try to steer a middle path between Hindu\nNon-Reductionism (eternalism) and Abhidharma Buddhist Reductionism\n(annihilationism) (Ganeri, 2012; Carpenter, 2015). They regard persons\nas emergent entities not reducible to mental and psychological and\nmental atoms (dharmas), although they depend on those atoms.\nThe Abhidharma and Madhyamaka traditions hold very different views\nabout persons.\n\nAccording to the M\u0101dhyamikas, the pragmatic usefulness of\nperson-talk is important as a catechetic device for teaching the\ndoctrine to the uninitiated. The Buddha\u2019s talk about persons and\nother continuing entities in the su\u0304tras is aimed at ordinary\npeople who, due to ignorance are beset with the false view of a self.\nAs Vincent Eltschinger puts it, \u201cthese preliminary and merely\nprovisional teachings are meant to offer a transition between the\nadhesion to worldly beliefs and the intuition of universal\nemptiness\u201d (2014, 470). The Pr\u0101sa\u1e47gika\nM\u0101dhyamikas not only deny the inherent existence of persons at\nthe ultimate level but also deny the inherent existence of persons at\neven the conventional level. In doing so the Pr\u0101sa\u1e47gikas\ntake themselves to be faithful to the original teachings of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\ndenies both that the person is the same as the psychophysical\nconstituents to which the Buddhist Reductionists try to reduce it and\nthat it is other than those constituents in the way that the Hindu\nNon-Reductionists claim. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna warns: \u201cBeyond good\nand evil, profound and liberating, this [doctrine of emptiness] has\nnot been tasted by those who fear what is entirely groundless.\u201d\nIn contemporary terms, Madhymaka position can be likened to minimalism\n(Perrett, 2002). As Johnston argues in \u201cthe particular case of\npersonal identity, minimalism implies that any metaphysical view of\npersons which we might have is either epiphenomenal or a redundant\nbasis for our practice of making judgements about personal identity\nand organizing our practical concerns around this relation\u201d\n(Johnston 1997, 150).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and his follower Candrak\u012brti denied that\npersons are reducible to the aggregates and that they are distinct\nfrom the aggregates. They are irrealists about selves and persons.\nAccording to Candrak\u012brti the proper explanation of this is that\nour everyday conception of self or person consists in \u2018an\nappropriative act of laying claim to the elements of the\npsycho-physical aggregate, an act that does not require there to be\nany object that is the person, nor any of the usual apparatus of\nreference to things. The term \u2018I\u2019 does not refer to selves\nor persons. In support of Candrak\u012brti\u2019s view, Ganeri notes\nthat that Reductionist accounts fail to explain the significance of\nthe distinction between the anticipation of one\u2019s own future\npain and the concern one feels for the future pain of another (2007,\n195). He further claims that irrealists are able to avoid this problem\nby substituting for a positive account of the metaphysics of persons\nan account of how one\u2019s sense of self arises from the\npsycho-physical stream. According to this irrealist account, in spite\nof appearances the function of person-talk is not to talk about\npersons, or selves, but to appropriate experiences, emotions, and\nbodies.\n\nThe \u0100bhidharmikas, on the other hand, did not think of\n\u2018person\u2019 as a useful pragmatic device or skillful means\nbut emphasized that it is nothing but a conventional designation, a\nmere name for a group of psychophysical aggregates, ultimately the\ncollections of dharmas The Abhidharma position has been classified by\nSiderits as Reductionism. Parfit claims that on the Reductionist view,\n\u201cpersons do exist. But they exist only in the way in which\nnations exist. Persons are not, as we mistakenly believe fundamental.\nThis view in this sense is more impersonal\u201d (1984, 445).\nSo-called Abhidharma Reductionism about persons was first championed\nby Mark Siderits in his classic paper \u201cBuddhist\nReductionism\u201d (1997, see also Perett 2002). More recently, this\ninterpretation has been challenged in literature. Chadha (2021) argues\nthat Vasubandhu\u2019s Abhidharma is best construed as an\nEliminativism about persons. Vasubandhu\u2019s argument against the\nPudgalav\u0101dins is based on the causal efficacy principle:\neverything that is real or substantial (dravya) is causally\nefficient, having specifiable cause-and-effect relations with other\nentities (see, for example, Gold 2015). Everything else is a\nconceptual construct, a mere convention (praj\u00f1apti),\nand thus should be rejected as only conventionally real.\nVasubandhu\u2019s uses the same principle to argue against the self\nas posited by the Hindu philosophers (in particular the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika). Selves too, according to Vasubandhu,\nare only conventionally real.\n\nWhat does Vasubandhu mean by saying that persons are only\nconventionally real? The term person is just a collective term for a\ngroup of aggregates, ultimately collection of physical and mental\ndharmas, just as milk is a term for a collection of tropes\u2014such\nas whitishness, liquidness, and potability. For Vasubandhu, only\ndharmas or tropes exist ultimately or substantially. All other things\nexist in name only. Siderits explains the idea thus: \u2018The point\nabout \u201cchariot\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d is that they are\nopaque enumerative expressions: when taken at face value they seem to\ndenote individual entities, only further analysis shows them to be\nways of referring to a plurality of entities in a certain\narrangement\u2019 (2019: 313). So, persons, chariots and pots are\nconceptual fictions. Siderits adds, \u2018The idea here is that the\nenumerative term \u201cpot\u201d represents a concept that has\nproven useful for creatures with certain interests (in this case, for\nstorage) and certain cognitive limitations (such as the inability to\ntrack all the many parts)\u2026 . Now conventional truths do\ntypically guide one to successful practice. This would be difficult to\nexplain if the truth-makers for conventionally true statements\nconsisted of nothing but mere conceptual fictions. Thus conventionally\nreal entities are said to supervene on ultimately real entities\u2019\n(2019: 314\u201315). The idea of conventional realities like persons\nbeing useful fictions was introduced in Siderits (1997) as a faithful\ninterpretation of Abhidharma. Recently, this too has been contested\n(Chadha 2021). Some conventional entities may well be useful fictions,\nfor example, chariots, armies and nations. But persons cannot be on\nthat list. Persons inherit the work of the selves, so they are just as\ndangerous as selves. The Buddhist Eliminativist about selves cannot\nand should not condone persons.\n2.3 C\u0101rv\u0101ka\n\nThe last group of philosophers to consider in this section are the\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas. C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers are materialists in\nthe classical Indian tradition and the most ardent critics of the\nVedas and scriptural authority among the heterodox schools. They deny\nthe existence of the self, as the essence of the person and with it\nthe possibility of transmigration and rebirth. They are the only\nphilosophers in the classical Indian tradition that rejected the\ndoctrine of karma and liberation or freedom. Death of the\nbody is the end of the person. The C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers are\nbest thought of as defending animalism or the biological view of\npersonal identity. The C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers argued that a\nperson, just like everything else in the world, is just a body, an\naggregate of material elements qualifies by consciousness.\nConsciousness is an emergent property of the four material elements\n(earth, water, fire and air) in a specific proportion. The\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas offer the analogy of an Indian after dinner treat\ncalled \u201cpaan\u201d which releases red colour when\nchewed even though none of its ingredients (betel leaf, chopped\nbetelnut (areca) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide)), are red. Just\nso consciousness emerges when several material elements come together\nin a specific proportion that constitutes a person. Their view is\nsurprisingly close to modern day physicalism. They did not believe in\nthe existence of the soul as the essence of the individual person or\nany other immaterial substance. The main argument against the\nexistence of the self rests on an epistemological principle:\nperception is the only source of knowledge. The argument can be stated\nthus:\n\nP1: The self cannot be perceived.\n\nP2: Whatever exists must be perceived.\n\nC: The self does not exist.\n\n\nAnother argument offered by the C\u0101rv\u0101kas for the claim that\na person is identical with the body is a linguistic argument. Consider\nsentences: \u201cI am youthful\u201d, \u201cI am stout\u201d. In\nthese sentences the \u201cI\u201d refers to the body. Linguistic\narguments were quite common in classical Indian philosophy because of\nthe influence of the grammarians and also because the Indian\nphilosophers paid attention to common speech behaviour which\npresumably expresses what common sense teaches us. With respect to the\nconception of a self, philosophers in the Indian tradition paid\nattention to the usages employing the first-person pronoun as data\nthat any philosophical theory of the self must account for. The\nNy\u0101ya philosophers also relied on arguments from language to\nrespond to the C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers. The Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers claim that the referent of \u2018I\u2019, whatever it\nis, appears in our consciousness as something internal. Therefore,\n\u2018I\u2019 cannot refer to the body. Furthermore, the word\n\u2018I\u2019 in each person\u2019s mouth refers to (picks out,\ndenotes) that person uniquely. The referent of \u2018I\u2019 cannot\nbe a generic body (material object) because it does not refer to the\nbody of another person. Nor can \u2018I\u2019 refer to one\u2019s\nown body because properties of the body (physical characteristics) are\nnot sufficient to identify a unique person. Any physical property, for\nexample, the shape of the body is an essential property of the body,\nbut other bodies can have exactly the same shape. If the term\n\u2018I\u2019 referred properties of the body, two persons who have\nexactly the same shape would be equally good candidates for the\nreferent of a given use of \u2018I\u2019 by either of them.\nTherefore, \u2018I\u2019 cannot refer to the body. And lastly, the\nNaiy\u0101yikas challenged the C\u0101rv\u0101kas to account for\nphrases like \u2018my body\u2019. Such phrases suggest that there is\na distinction between me and the body, it implies that there is\nsomething, the referent of \u2018I\u2019, a self, which has or\npossesses a body. The C\u0101rv\u0101kas dismiss such phrases as\n\u2018my body\u2019 are mere metaphors and do not indicate that\nthere is a self that is separate from the body. It is worth noting\nthat the Naiy\u0101yikas and other Hindu philosophers have a similar\nproblem accounting for statements such as \u201cI am fat\u201d,\n\u201cI am tall\u201d etc.\n\nTo conclude, it is worth noting that apart from Abhidharma Buddhism\nand Advaita Ved\u0101nta, most Buddhist philosophers and other\nclassical Indian philosophers accept that persons are real.\n3. What do we need persons for?\n\nContemporary philosophical investigation into questions about the\nnature of persons and personal identity may seem very far from these\nancient discussions in classical Indian philosophy. The\nNon-Reductionist view so popular among the mainstream Hindus is not in\nfavour these days. The most important reason to deny that we are\nseparately existing non-physical soul substances is that such things\nare impossible to trace through space-time. If we are essentially\nnon-physical souls, there still would be no way to know that you now\nare one and the same person that committed the crime at an earlier\ntime. If judgments about personal identity were grounded on judgements\nabout the identities of immaterial souls, then personal identity would\nbe completely mysterious (Perry 1978, 402\u20133). It is true that we\nsometimes lack epistemic access to metaphysical truths. But if this\nwere the right metaphysical theory it should undermine all confidence\nin our judgments of identity in a way that seems bizarre (Shoemaker\nand Tobia, forthcoming). That might seem bizarre from a contemporary\npoint of view, but the Hindu Non-Reductionists are not going to be\nworried by these objections. Most classical Indian philosophers,\nexcept the C\u0101rv\u0101kas, agree that ignorance about our own\nnatures\u2014 about who and what we are\u2014is the cause of our\nbondage in the cycle of birth and rebirth and the suffering that comes\nwith it. The Upani\u1e63adic sages were no strangers to metaphors and\nmysteries. Their strategy was to heighten the mystery associated with\nknowledge, \u201cnot so much in a self\u2010serving secretiveness or\na disinclination to share the knowledge that gives them power but as\nresponse to a deep respect for the power of that knowledge, and a\nrecognition of the need not to be frivolous either with the knowledge\nitself or with its potential recipients\u201d (Ganeri 2007,13). The\nKatha Upani\u1e63ad puts it thus: \u201cHidden in all the beings,\nthis self is not visibly displayed. Yet, people of keen vision see him\nwith eminent and sharp minds.\u201d (KU 3.12).\n\nMost contemporary philosophers assume that Reductionism is true. The\nReductionists draw inspiration from Locke, perhaps the first\nphilosopher in the history of Western philosophy to put forward a\nversion of the psychological continuity view that was developed by\nParfit. But there is another more important point that Locke brought\ncentre-stage to the discussion about personal identity: theorizing\nabout persons is motivated by a distinctive normative concern about\nmoral responsibility. Locke writes:\n\nIn this personal Identity is founded all the Right and Justice of\nReward and Punishment; Happiness and Misery, being that, for which\nevery one is concerned for himself\u2026the Apostle tells us, that\nat the Great Day, when every one shall receive according to his\ndoings, the secrets of all Hearts shall be laid open. The Sentence\nshall be justified by the consciousness all Persons shall have, that\nthey themselves in what Bodies soever they appear, or what Substances\nsoever that consciousness adheres to, are the same, that committed\nthose Actions, and deserve that Punishment for them. (Locke 1690\n[1975, 341\u2013347])\n\n\nIn the classical Indian context, as we have seen above, it is the same\nconcerns that led to the search for an eternal soul as the essence of\npersons by the Hindu philosophers and also motivated the Buddhist\npersonalists to introduce persons (pudgala) as\n\u2018burden-bearers\u2019. Classical Indian philosophers did not\ninvoke God but relied on karma to dole out just rewards and\npunishments in the course of the cycle of birth and rebirth. Normative\nconcerns about responsibility are thus an important motivating concern\nacross the East-West divide.\n\nContemporary philosophers, however, have broadened the scope of\nnormative concerns beyond that of moral responsibility. Shoemaker\n(2007, 318\u20139) helpfully presents a list of practical concerns\nthat are presumably grounded in personal identity which includes moral\nresponsibility but adds many more: anticipation of future experiences;\nspecial self-concern for one\u2019s own future self; surviving death\nand anticipation of the afterlife; compensation, maximizing utility\nintrapersonally but not interpersonally; self-conscious emotions\n(pride, regret, etc.); special non-derivative concern and\nother-regarding emotions I have for a certain limited network of\npeople, all of whom bear certain sorts of special relations to me;\nfirst-person reidentification and self-regarding emotions I have for\nmy past and future self. This long list is likely to put pressure on\nany single criterion of personal identity.\n\nThe psychological continuity criterion originally proposed by Locke\nand developed most famously by Parfit (1984) does well to account for\nmoral responsibility and anticipation of the afterlife and survival\nbut falls short on compensation and maximizing utility\nintrapersonally. The animalist or biological continuity criterion does\nnot fare well in accounting for concern about moral responsibility,\nbut it does much better on compensation and special non-derivative\nconcern and other-regarding emotions I have for a certain limited\nnetwork of people, all of whom bear certain sorts of special relations\nto me (DeGrazia 2005). These are not the only competitors though. Some\nmight suggest, as do Tierney et al., that we can be pluralists about\npersonal identity. Rather \u2018empirical evidence and philosophical\nthought experiments indicate that judgments about personal identity\nare regimented by two different criteria, one in terms of\npsychological traits and one that largely conforms to biological\ncriteria\u2019 (Tierney et al. 2014, 198). Shoemaker (2007) goes\nfurther to settle for a wide-ranging pluralism in the face of the\ndisunity of our practical concerns. But Shoemaker stops short of\ngiving up on persons and person-related concerns in the hope that\nthere is a theory (or theories!) of the relation between personal\nidentity and our person-related practices and concerns. He says,\n\u2018several concessions may be required, including admission,\nperhaps, of (a) the irrelevance of certain powerful and popular\ncriteria of personal identity for (at least some of) our practices and\nconcerns, (b) the ultimate disunity of these practices and concerns\n(such that multiple types of theories of the relation between them and\nthe metaphysics may be called for), and/or (c) the possibility of\ndifferent types of rational grounding\u2014justification and\nrendering-possible\u2014where justification may actually be off the\ntable altogether for some practices and concerns\u2019 (2007,\n354).\n\nSome others though develop a different approach to the problem of\npersonal identity which upends the debate between the supporters of\nanimalism and psychological continuity theorists. One example of such\nan approach is the \u201ccharacterisation\u201d criterion that has\nbeen recently developed by Marya Schectman (2014). In her words,\npersonal identity \u201cjust consists in the fact that the person\nbefore us now is viewed as, treated as, and acts as the same locus of\nnormative concerns as the [previous] person\u201d (Schectman 2014,\n152). Although Schectman has only four normative concerns in mind from\nthe above list (moral responsibility, special self-interested concern,\ncompensation, and survival), her move ensures that these normative\nconcerns trump any metaphysical considerations. According to\nSchectman, a person is, whatever it is, that is the locus of our\nnormative concerns. Another recent view that deserves a mention in\nthis context is the Minimalist view, defended in a series of papers by\nMark Johnston (1987, 1992, 1997). According to Minimalism, the\nmetaphysical \u201cdeep\u201d facts of personal identity are\nirrelevant to the justification of our person-related practices and\npractical concerns. Our practices are grounded not on a metaphysics of\npersons but on our circumstances and needs. Johnston writes: \u201cin\nthe particular case of personal identity, minimalism implies that any\nmetaphysical view of persons which we might have is either\nepiphenomenal or a redundant basis for our practice of making\njudgements about personal identity and organizing our practical\nconcerns around this relation\u201d (Johnston 1997, 150). The\ncharacterisation criterion and Minimalism extol the primacy of our\nnormative practices and concerns suggesting the latter\n\nmay actually authoritatively constrain, shape, or even be immune or\nirrelevant to one\u2019s theory of personal identity. This is a\ngeneral methodological dispute about the proper direction of\nargumentation in the arena of personal identity and ethics. (from\nsection 7 of the entry\n personal identity and ethics,\n Winter 2021 Edition)\n\n\nThis is, however, not the only dispute. The biggest problem is that we\nhave no settled conception of persons or personal identity. I\u2019ve\ndiscussed four different views here, and there are many more. There\nseems to be no clear winner.\n\nRevisionism about personal identity has been popular since\nParfit\u2019s Reasons and Persons. But contemporary\nphilosophers stop short of questioning our normative concerns and\npractices. Parfit flirted with revisionism about normative concerns\nabout practices in proposing the Extreme Claim, according to which,\none\u2019s moral and prudential concerns cannot be grounded without a\ndeep separate fact about personal identity. But Parfit thinks that\nanother view is also defensible. This view results from the\ncombination of reductionism with the Moderate Claim, which says that\nour moral and prudential concerns may well be grounded in what does\nmatter in personal identity. This, according to Parfit, is\npsychological connectedness and/or continuity (1984, 311). Parfit\nbelieved that the Extreme Claim is defensible, he retracted it only\nbecause he did not have an argument to defend it. But if we run with\nthe Extreme Claim it entails that our person-related practices and\nconcerns are ungrounded, period. This opens the door for\nreconsideration of our person-related practices. However, this option\nis ignored in contemporary philosophy. Philosophers, as we saw, are\nwilling to consider pluralism about criteria of personal identity,\npluralism about theories of the relation between personal identity and\nperson-related practices. Shoemaker, as we saw above, is also willing\nto consider the disunity of practices. But no one is willing to\nconsider revising the practices themselves. But why are the practices\nconsidered sacrosanct? P.F. Strawson balks at such a question. He\nwrites, \u2018I shall reply, first, that such a question could seem\nreal only to one who had utterly failed to grasp the purport of\n\u2026 the fact of our natural human commitment to ordinary\ninter-personal attitudes. This commitment is part of the general\nframework of human life, not something that can come up for\nreview\u2019 (1974: 14, emphasis added). Strawson is not only\nclaiming that it is hard for us to give up our interpersonal attitudes\nand concerns, but he also thinks to give up these would be to give up\non our humanity.\n\nA thoroughgoing revisionist willing to explore the consequences of\nendorsing the Extreme Claim would reconsider some of our\nperson-related concerns and practices and attitudes. That is exactly\nthe strategy adopted by the Abhidharma Buddhist Reductionist. Buddhist\nReductionists are willing to revisit our ordinary normative practices\nand concerns, especially those to do with self-concern and the special\nconcern that we have for those we love dearly. The Buddhists do\nrecognize that it is built-in precondition of our form of life that we\nhave self-concern and special concern for our loved ones. That is why\nthe Buddhists do not recommend giving up on this self-concern or\nspecial concern for our loved ones. Rather they recommend expanding\nsimilar concern to all others, including one\u2019s enemies. And they\ndo not think that such an expansion comes easy to us given our human\nnature: it has to be inculcated by extensive training in\n\u2018spiritual exercises\u2019 which include meditation, knowledge\nof the Buddhist texts and insight. This expansion is not to be thought\nof as the giving up of one\u2019s humanity, as feared by Strawson,\nrather the idea is to enlarge our humanity.\n\nIt is important for us to realise that any set of norms or value\nsystem is not immune to revision, just because it is, as Strawson\nputs, \u2018part of the general framework of human life\u2019. The\nproblem is that there is no such \u2018general\u2019 framework. The\nnormative concerns and practices of human societies are varied, and\nnot such as to be weighed systematically against each other. The\npractices we regard as important because they are \u2018part of the\ngeneral framework of human life\u2019 cannot be justified as having\nbeen chosen by ideally rational beings. Persons as moral beings are a\nproduct of our histories and culturally constrained preferences.\nImagine being in a world in which the Buddhist thesis of the no self\nwas widely held. Or consider a culture where the really significant\nentities are family lines, and it is axiomatic that children are\njustly to be held responsible for their parents\u2019 wrongdoing.\nWhat evidence is there against such a code, or in favour of\n\u2018our\u2019 belief that persons are separate individuals,\nresponsible for their own crimes. It is therefore not clear that we\nshould assume that all normative systems must include some special\nconcern for one\u2019s future self and those that we love dearly. The\nanticipation of one\u2019s own future self or one\u2019s survival\nare also up for question. These important assumptions that often goes\nunnoticed because they basically treated as \u201cpart of the general\nframework\u201d. Buddhist philosophy invites us to ask the question:\nIs there such a framework?\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Carpenter, Amber, 2015. \u201cPersons Keeping Their Karma\nTogether,\u201d in <em>The Moon Points Back: Analytic Philosophy and\nAsian Thought</em>, J.
