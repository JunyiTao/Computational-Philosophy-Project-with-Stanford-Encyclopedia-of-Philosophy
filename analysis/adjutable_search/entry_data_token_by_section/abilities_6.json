    "main_text": "Hypothetical theories of ability\n3. Hypothetical theories of ability\n\nThe bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the\nhistorical and contemporary literature have been what we might call\nhypothetical theories. On such views, to have an ability is\nfor it to be the case that one would act in certain ways if\none were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories\ndepending on how one understands the volitions in question and how\nexactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but\nnonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family.\nGiven their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of\ntheories of ability with them.\n",
