    "main_text": "\n\nThis article considers several questions concerning the philosophy of\ndeath.\n\nFirst, it discusses what it is to be alive. This topic arises\nbecause to die is roughly to lose one\u2019s life.\n\nThe second topic is the nature of death, and how it bears on\nthe persistence of organisms and persons.\n\nThe third topic is the harm thesis, the claim that\ndeath can harm the individual who dies. Perhaps the most influential\ncase against the harm thesis was made by Epicurus. His argument is\ndiscussed, as is a contemporary response, the deprivationist defense\nof the harm thesis.\n\nThe fourth topic is a question that seems to confront\nproponents of the harm thesis, especially those who offer some version\nof the deprivationist defense: if a person is harmed by her death, at\nwhat time does her death make her worse off than she otherwise would\nbe? Some answers are considered.\n\nFifth is further issues that may lead us to doubt the harm\nthesis. One is a further question about deprivationism: we are not\nalways harmed by what deprives us of things; what makes some of these\nworrisome and not others? Next is a question concerning the fact that\nthere are two different directions in which our lives could be\nextended: into the past (our lives could have been longer if they\nbegan earlier), or into the future (they could have been longer if\nthey ended later). Assuming the former does not matter to us, why\nshould the latter?\n\nThe sixth topic concerns events that occur after a person has\ndied: is it possible for these events to harm her?\n\nSeventh is a controversy concerning whether extreme long\nlife, even immortality, would be good for us. Of particular interest\nhere is a dispute between Thomas Nagel, who says that death is an evil\nwhenever it comes, and Bernard Williams, who argues that, while\npremature death is a misfortune, it is a good thing that we are not\nimmortal, since we cannot continue to have our current characters and\nremain meaningfully attached to life forever.\n\nA final controversy concerns whether or not the harmfulness\nof death can be reduced. It may be that, by adjusting our conception\nof our well-being, and by altering our attitudes, we can reduce or\neliminate the threat death poses us. But there is a case to be made\nthat such efforts backfire if taken to extremes.\n",
