    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || New-Wave Sociology of Science and the Realist Reaction\n1.7 New-Wave Sociology of Science and the Realist Reaction\n\nLeft relatively untouched by historicist philosophers during the\nBattle of the Big Systems was the internal/external distinction. The\nphilosophers, consonant with traditional sociology of science (e.g.,\nMerton 1973) and sociology of knowledge more generally, defended a\nkind of \u201cinertial principle\u201d (Fuller 1989: xiii et\npassim): social and psychological factors such as economic and\npolitical interests and psychological dispositions should be brought\ninto play only to explain deviation from the rational path. This\ndistinction began to erode already in Kuhn, who stressed the social\nfactors internal to the organization of science itself:\nscience education, the strong role of scientific communities with\ntheir distinctive cultures, etc. (See also Lakatos on comprehensive\ntheories of rationality that can turn apparent external considerations\ninto internal ones, and Hull 1988 on career advancement.)\n\nIn the 1970s, new-wave sociologists of science quickly rejected the\ndivision of labor implied by the inertial principle and took sociology\nfar beyond where Kuhn had left it (much to his chagrin). These\nsociologists insisted that sociology, via social interests and other\nsocial motivational causes, had much to say about the internal,\ntechnical content of science\u2014so much, in fact, that it was not\nclear that there was any room left for the rational explanations of\nthe philosophers. The Edinburgh Strong Programme founded by David\nBloor and Barry Barnes (see Bloor 1976), the Bath relativist school of\nHarry Collins and Trevor Pinch (Collins 1981), and later\nconstructivist work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979), Karin\nKnorr-Cetina (1981), Steve Shapin (1982), Shapin and Simon Schaffer\n(1985), and Andy Pickering (1984) were important early developments.\n(See Shapin 1982 for a helpful discussion.)\n\nSince the new sociology of science was also heavily based on\nhistorical case studies, we find more radical historicisms challenging\nless radical ones. Although the sociologists often disagreed among\nthemselves, as the philosophers did, the general thrust of their work\nwas that the philosophical historicists had failed to take\nsocio-political context into account and thus were still too much\nwedded to the old, abstract, acausal ideals of rationality,\nobjectivity, and progress toward truth. Much sociological work was\nexplicitly anti-realist and relativist, at least as a methodology.\n\nMost philosophers of science strongly rejected the new sociology as\nrelativist and irrationalist, the non-historicists among them adopting\nversions of strong realism, according to which mature science can\nknowingly, on internalist grounds, arrive at theoretical truth and\ngenuine reference to theoretical entities, or closely enough. The\neventual upshot was \u201cthe Science Wars\u201d of the 1990s. By\nnow (2017), the sides in this dispute have mellowed, fruitful\nconversations are taking place, and some degree of reconciliation has\noccurred (see Labinger & Collins 2001). Work by feminists in\nscience studies such as Donna Haraway (2004) and feminist philosophers\nof science such as Helen Longino (1990, 2001) and Miriam Solomon\n(2001) have rejected assumptions common to both sides in the debate,\nthereby opening the way to their more pluralistic, interactive, and\nless hierarchical options. Distinct prominent approaches to social\nepistemology by philosophers include Fuller 1988, Goldman 1999, and\nRouse 2002. (See the entries on\n social epistemology,\n scientific method,\n scientific realism,\n and the\n social dimensions of science\n as well as the feminist entries referenced above.)\n\nSome of the sociological work had a postmodern cast, and so did\ncontributions by some philosophers. For example, Richard Rorty\u2019s\nversion of historicist pragmatism rejected correspondence theories of\ntruth and the related idea that we humans have some\nnaturalized-theological obligation faithfully to represent\nmetaphysical nature with our science. He spoke suggestively but\nvaguely of major transformations in the sciences (or anywhere else in\nculture), such as that achieved by Galileo, as the invention of a new\n\u201cvocabulary\u201d that worked well enough for certain purposes\nto catch on, but not as new truths established by logical reasoning. As\nfor rationality itself, it is a matter of maintaining an honest, civil\n\u201cconversation\u201d:\n\n\nOn a pragmatist view, rationality is not the exercise of a faculty\ncalled \u201creason\u201d\u2014a faculty which stands in some\ndeterminate relation to reality. Nor is [it] the use of a method. It\nis simply a matter of being open and curious, and of relying\non persuasion rather than force. (1991: 62).\n\n\nSo rationality is not the key to scientific success, and it has as\nmuch to do with rhetoric as with logic. Pragmatists, he said, prefer\nto speak of the success or failure of problem-solving efforts, rather\nthan rationality or irrationality (1991: 66).\n\nA view sometimes ascribed to Rorty\u2019s hero Dewey is that\nrationality is not an a priori, universal method of thinking\nand acting properly; rather, it is like a box of intellectual tools,\neach of which, as humans have learned from craft experience, work better than\nothers in various situations, the result being what might be called a\n\u201cteleonormative\u201d conception of rationality.\n",
