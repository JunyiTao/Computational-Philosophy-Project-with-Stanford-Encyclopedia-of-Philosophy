    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || Which Principle of Distribution?\n5.2 Which Principle of Distribution?\n\nSo far, the right principle for distributing personal relationship\ngoods has received little attention: views ranged from requiring equal\naccess to love and care (Lynch et al. 2009) to sufficient access to\nsocially decent relationships (Brownlee 2013, 2016a); or, perhaps\n\u201cdifferent principles govern the distribution of different\nrelational opportunities\u201d (Cordelli 2015a: 103).\n\nBrownlee thinks that, in order to respect the human right against\nsocial deprivation it is enough to have \u201cminimal opportunities\nfor non-threatening, decent, or supportive social interaction\u201d\n(Brownlee 2013, 206) rather than relationships with friends or loved\nones. She doubts that equality of social connection is valuable in\nitself; yet, the rich arguments that she provides concerning the\nimportance of personal relationship goods suggest that justice\nrequires more than the securing of the human right she advocates. And\nher worry that requiring equality instead of sufficiency could lead to\nleveling down can be assuaged by adopting a prioritarian\nprinciple.\n\nIn this context, it is important to know that sufficiency may ensure\nthe full benefits to which personal relationship goods are\ninstrumental: Some empirical research indicates that, while social\nisolation is a major risk factor, there is little or no variation\nacross moderate to high levels of social relationships (House\n2001).\n",
