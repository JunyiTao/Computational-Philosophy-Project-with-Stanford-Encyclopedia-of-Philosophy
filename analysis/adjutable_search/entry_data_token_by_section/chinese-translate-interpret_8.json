    "main_text": "Why Interrogate Chinese Philosophical Texts? || The Contrastive Approach\n3.3 The Contrastive Approach\n The comparative approach to exegesis in Chinese philosophy\nobviously leaves much room for consideration of differences as well,\nwhich are often as illuminating as the similarities, and at times even\nmore so. This approach also tends to enrich philosophy overall by\nincreasing its scope, reach, and capacity for self-correction; there\nis no better cure for culture-boundedness than steeping oneself in\nanother.  And in that way\u2014as well as many\nothers\u2014comparative philosophers of China may hope to engage in\nfruitful dialogue with other philosophers ignorant of non-Western\ncultures in general, Chinese in particular.\nAll of these laudable consequences of the comparative approach\nnotwithstanding, there is another way to interrogate Chinese texts\nwhich merits attention because it is equally capable of illuminating\nthem. This latter approach places the Western tradition more in the\nbackground while engaged in research, interpretive and translation\nefforts. That is to say, the translating philosopher must be open to\nthe text as it is, not within the contexts determined by the nature of\nthe questions addressed to it in the vocabulary of Western philosophy.\nThis critical stance is not urging philosophers to approach a text as\na tabula rasa, for such cannot be done. It is to urge that\nphilosophers attend very carefully to the lexicon for translating\nChinese into English, for that lexicon may be construed as\na theory of sorts, and an increasingly poor one; it is a\ntheory that Chinese philosophy is pretty much like Western philosophy,\nand consequently the vocabulary of the one can be carried over to the\nother without undue distortion (Hansen 1992: 17).\nBut no translation is innocent, nor any interpretation. The form of\nour questions determine the range of the possible answers we can\nobtain. Thus, if we ask what view of the inner life Confucius held, we\nalmost surely will not be able to see that perhaps he didn\u2019t\nhold any such view, or even think about having an \u201cinner\nlife\u201d, as Herbert Fingarette argued in his famous book on the\nMaster (1972). Asking which theory of propositional truth early\nDaoists held makes it difficult to see, as Hansen argued, that the\nearly Daoists (and all other early Chinese thinkers) had little\ninterest in propositional truth, but in language as praxis-guiding\nbehavior, as we noted earlier\n(\u00a72.2, and will take up again\nin \u00a74.3 ). There are multiple\ncosmologies in Western philosophy, beginning with the several put\nforth by the Greeks, all of them conforming to a logical order. But we\nshouldn\u2019t ask which one of them early Chinese cosmology most\nnearly resembles if Hall and Ames are right in claiming that Chinese\ncosmology is best described as an aesthetic order not a\nlogical one (1987: 16). It might be that the early Confucians\ndidn\u2019t have any ethical theory, but based their\ndescriptions, analyses and evaluations of human activity on the basis\nof their roles (Rosemont and Ames 2009; Ames 2011; Rosemont 2015).\nThese suggestions clearly do not fit well with the standard\n\u201cgrammar\u201d and presuppositions of the Western philosophical\ntradition. It makes no sense to ask what contribution Chinese thought\ncan make to the mind-body problem if the dichotomy is altogether\nabsent their writings, nor to seek light on the nature of\npropositional truth if its propositional content was not a factor in\ntheir thinking about language.\nOne problem with this approach to interrogating Chinese texts is\nthat it thus reduces the opportunities for comparative philosophers to\nengage in genuine dialogue with their Western-oriented brethren, and\nmakes it easier to continue using the shibboleth that Chinese thought\n\u201cisn\u2019t really philosophy\u201d. On the other hand, the\ncontrasters will insist that the comparative approach robs the Chinese\nof their own voice, forcing them into a philosophical milieu that is\nnot theirs. This can be seen in the frequency with which the\ncomparisons tend to be asymmetrical: when something is lacking, or an\nargument missing, or some other deficit is seen, the Chinese side is\nat fault. But the plausibility of the charge rests almost solely on\nassuming the Western definition of the problem and approach to it. And\nin the end, just how plausible is it to think that all\nthe real problems of philosophy, and all the methods for\ndealing with them, have been advanced in a single civilization?\nThese sketches of the comparative and contrastive approaches to the\nexegesis of Chinese philosophical texts have been just that: sketches;\nthere are many more examples of each kind, and a number of comparative\nphilosophers combine the two. And it must be remembered that much work\nhas been done by scholars not trained in philosophy, increasing the\nnumber of ways of approaching the texts. Good exemplars of the variety\nof approaches to the field are introductory works on Chinese\nphilosophy, which tend to combine both some comparative and\ncontrastive elements, and differ in thrust as their authors foreground\nthe Chinese elements, or emphasize philosophy\n(especially analytic) in their narratives. Two examples of the former\nare Lai (2008) and Wen (2012); coming down more firmly on the\nphilosophy side are Van Norden (2011) and Liu (2006). The field is\nthus fairly fluid as it continues to come into its own, which readers\nshould celebrate and not bemoan because of the variety of perspectives\non the Chinese tradition on offer, all based on solid scholarly work\nfrom one discipline or another. We shall return briefly to these\nissues in \u00a74.3.\n",
