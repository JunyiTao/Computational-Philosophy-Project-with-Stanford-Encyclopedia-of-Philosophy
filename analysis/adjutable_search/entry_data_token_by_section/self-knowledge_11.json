    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || \n3.4 Empiricist Transparency Accounts\n\nTransparency accounts are inspired by the idea discussed above in\nconnection with Gareth Evans\u2019 famous remark: that if asked\nwhether you believe that there will be a third world war, you answer\nby directly considering the likelihood of a third world war. The\nmetaphor of transparency expresses the notion that one \u201clooks\nthrough\u201d the (transparent) mental state to directly consider\nwhat it represents.\n\nSome philosophers use the idea that mental states are \u201ctransparent\u201d to\nadvance rationalist or agentialist accounts of self-knowledge, which\nare non-empiricist (see 3.6\n and 3.7).\n The current subsection concerns transparency accounts that see\nEvans\u2019 procedure as generating empirical justification or\nwarrant for self-ascriptions (Dretske 1994; Fern\u00e1ndez 2003,\n2013; Byrne 2005, 2018).\n\nDretske describes self-knowledge as \u201ca form of perceptual\nknowledge that is obtained\u2014indeed, can only be obtained\u2014by\nawareness of non-mental objects\u201d (Dretske 1994: 264). E.g., I\ncan know that I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s snowing only by\ninference from my awareness of a non-mental object, such as the\nfalling snow. This account secures first-person privilege, since my\nawareness of the snow would not similarly support an inference about\nanyone else\u2019s mental state. The account requires that we rely on\nbackground beliefs to justify the inference from seeing snow to\nI\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s snowing. One worry about\nthis account is that it\u2019s not clear that the relevant background\nbeliefs will be available or justified (Aydede 2003).\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s version of the transparency account avoids\nthis worry by taking self-knowledge to be non-inferential. He argues\nthat a single state can serve as the basis for both the belief that\np and the belief that one believes that p. For\nexample, seeing snow falling will ordinarily result in the belief that\nit\u2019s snowing; this visual experience may also form the basis for\nthe self-ascription I believe that it\u2019s snowing.\nFern\u00e1ndez (2013) labels this \u201cthe bypass model\u201d, to\nindicate that it takes self-attributions of belief to be based\ndirectly on the basis for the first-order belief,\n\u201cbypassing\u201d the first-order belief itself. The\nself-ascription is justified in a way that is \u201cpartly\ninternalist\u201d (ibid.: 44) in that I have access to the basis for\nmy belief that I believe that it\u2019s snowing, namely the fact that\nI (seem to) see falling snow. The account is also \u201cpartly externalist\u201d\n(ibid): my self-ascription is warranted because my perceptual state\nthat is its basis tends to correlate with the belief that it\u2019s\nsnowing.\n\nThe bypass method is exclusively first-personal, since only I can base\na belief directly on my perceptual state. And it is more\nsecure than others\u2019 knowledge of my mental states. Others know\nmy states only by inference\u2014from my behavior, and/or their\nobservations of the evidence available to me. But self-knowledge that\nsatisfies the bypass model is non-inferential, since the\nself-ascription (e.g., the belief that I believe that it\u2019s\nsnowing) is not inferred from its basis (e.g., seeing falling\nsnow).\n\nBy contrast, Byrne\u2019s (2005, 2018) transparency account is\nexplicitly inferentialist. He claims that we know our beliefs by\nreasoning according to the \u201cdoxastic schema\u201d (Gallois\n1996). \n\n\\[\\frac{p}{\\mbox{I believe that } p}\\]\n\n\nByrne argues as follows. To reason in accord with the doxastic schema\nis to infer I believe that p from the premise p; one\ndoes not infer from a premise unless one believes the premise; so such\nreasoning will yield true self-ascriptions. The doxastic schema is\nthus\n self-verifying.[5]\n And it is self-verifying regardless of whether the premise is\njustified, or even whether the thinker regards it as justified.\n\nByrne\u2019s main thesis, that self-knowledge is achieved through use\nof the doxastic schema, rests on two basic claims. The first claim is\nthat it\u2019s independently plausible that we actually use the\ndoxastic schema (as Evans\u2019 remarks suggest). The second claim is\nthat the hypothesis that we use the doxastic schema best explains the\nspecial security and asymmetry of self-knowledge. On his proposal, the\nspecial epistemic security of self-knowledge is a matter of\nexternalist warrant: the doxastic schema is not only self-verifying\nbut also yields self-ascriptions that are \u201csafe\u201d in that\nthey could not easily have been\n false.[6]\n The asymmetry of self-knowledge consists in the fact that following\nthis schema will not yield knowledge of others\u2019 states.\nReasoning from it\u2019s snowing to you/they believe\nthat it\u2019s snowing will not reliably yield true\nbeliefs about others\u2019 beliefs.\n\nOne objection to transparency accounts is that answering the question\n\u201cDo you believe that p?\u201d by directly considering\nwhether p may not shed light on what one believed before the\nquestion arose (Shah and Velleman 2005). For example, to answer the\nquestion \u201cDo you believe that there will be a third world\nwar?\u201d by considering geopolitical matters may produce a new\nbelief rather than revealing a pre-existing belief. In general,\nreflection on accessible evidence about whether p may\nactually change a pre-existing belief on this issue (Wilson and Kraft\n1993). The transparency theorist cannot avoid this worry by\nstipulating that, when considering whether p, one should not\ndraw a new conclusion. Avoiding new conclusions would require\nalready knowing one\u2019s beliefs, that is, which conclusions one\nhad already drawn.\n\nTransparency theorists can respond by arguing that the objection\nmisconstrues the aim of these accounts. The objection charges that the\naccount may not explain first-person access: how it is that,\nif you believe that p, you can know that you do. Transparency\naccounts may be intended to address a different question, namely, what\nkind of exclusively first-personal method could deliver\nself-ascriptions that constitute knowledge. And even if considering\ngeopolitical matters produced a new belief that a third world war is\nlikely, the inference that Byrne describes\u2014from a third\nworld war is likely to I believe that a third world war is\nlikely\u2014would arguably yield self-knowledge. Still, the\nobjection exposes a possible limitation of transparency accounts.\nBecause they cannot distinguish newly-formed judgments from previous\ndispositional beliefs, they cannot account for our apparent ability to\nknowledgeably answer the question \u201cDo you believe that\np?\u201d, where that question concerns what one believes at\nthe time the question is posed (Gertler 2011b).\n\n\nAnother objection concerns these accounts\u2019 presumption that\nself-knowledge need not meet epistemically internalist conditions on\nknowledge. Boyle (2011) targets Byrne\u2019s view on this point,\narguing that even if the inference from p to I believe\nthat p reliably yields true (and safe) self-ascriptions, this\ninference cannot explain self-knowledge since it will not appear\nreasonable to the thinker: after all, in general the fact\nthat p doesn\u2019t imply that I believe\nthat p. Fern\u00e1ndez addresses this worry, in arguing\nthat beliefs formed through the bypass method will seem reasonable to\nthe subject. Other critics argue that the transition from p\nto I believe that p is not a genuine inference. Valaris\n(2011) argues that, unlike genuine inferences, this transition cannot\nbe used in hypothetical contexts\u2014e.g., when one reasons from a\npremise one doesn\u2019t believe, to see what follows from\nit. Barnett (2016) argues that this transition violates plausible,\nbroadly evidentialist restrictions on inferences.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez limits his account to explaining self-knowledge of\nbeliefs and desires, while Byrne extends his account to encompass\nself-knowledge of all of our mental states. Critics express skepticism\nabout extending the transparency account beyond beliefs: to desires\n(Ashwell 2013a, 2013b), to thoughts or intentions (Samoilova 2016), or\nto beliefs held with less than 100% confidence (Tang 2017).\n",
