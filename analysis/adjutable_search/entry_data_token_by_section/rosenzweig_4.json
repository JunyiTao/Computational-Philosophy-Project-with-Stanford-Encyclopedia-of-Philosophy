    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || 1913: Near-Conversion and Return\n1.4 1913: Near-Conversion and Return\n\n\nRosenzweig moved to Leipzig for the winter and summer semesters of\n1913. There, while still conducting his research on Hegel, he studied\nmathematics and jurisprudence, and began what was to become a close\nfriendship with a young lecturer in jurisprudence, Eugen Rosenstock.\nThe two began to meet regularly to discuss philosophical and\ntheological matters. At stake for Rosenzweig appear to have been\nquestions closely linked to those he had contemplated during the\nBaden-Baden experiment and which remained on his mind as he\ninvestigated Hegel\u2019s coming of age in Hegel und der\nStaat: how can our radical subjectivity or selfhood be reconciled\nwith our grasp of the world? and how must the divine be conceived such\nthat it be understood as grounding and unifying both selfhood and\nworldliness? The failure at Baden-Baden had led Rosenzweig to question\nhis earlier historicist view that individual subjects might find their\nfulfillment as subjects in the world by joining together to form a\nzeitgeistig unity, worshipping in the Zeitgeist\n\u201cthe God revealing itself in the here and now.\u201d But how\nelse was the relationship between self and world to be grasped? This\nquestion appears to have been the source of some existential disquiet\nfor Rosenzweig, and heading into the summer of 1913, he appears to have\nentertained certain Gnostic notions that one could only realize\none\u2019s selfhood, and ground that selfhood in a relation to the\ndivine, through a denial of the world. But on July 7, 1913, Rosenzweig\nengaged in an all-night discussion with Rosenstock and his\n(Rosenzweig\u2019s) cousin Rudolf Ehrenberg, which Rosenzweig would\nlater look back on as the transformative event in his life. Over the\ncourse of this night, Rosenstock convinced Rosenzweig not only to\nrethink the significance of Christianity\u2014Rosenzweig apparently\ncame into that evening with a view of \u201ctrue\u201d Christianity\nas inherently anti-worldly, while Rosenstock stressed\nChristianity\u2019s redemptive work in the world\u2014but even that\na Christian life grounded in revelation and devoted to the mission of\nredeeming the world through history represented the only\ncoherent and compelling path to the kind of reconciliation of selfhood\nand worldliness which Rosenzweig sought. Rosenstock\u2019s challenge\nprecipitated a crisis in Rosenzweig: he later claimed to have spent the\nhours after the conversation alone in his room, pistol at hand,\n\u201cface to face with the Nothing.\u201d He emerged from the\nexperience determined to convert to Christianity in order thereby to\ntake up his place in the historical realization of redemption in the\nworld.\n\n\nThree months later, having returned to Berlin in October of 1913,\nRosenzweig reversed his decision, this as a result of a new conception\nof Judaism which would remain central to his thought for the rest of\nhis life. Through its mission of neighborly love, Rosenzweig continued\nto maintain, Christianity carries out the redemptive realization of\nunity in the world. But Judaism also has a vital role to play in the\nworld\u2019s redemption. The Jewish people lives in large part closed\noff from the rest of the world; but in its insular communal life,\nRosenzweig now claims, it anticipates the ultimate redemption, and\nthereby represents to the rest of the world the goal they must ever\npursue. Having arrived at a manner of grasping the reconciliation of\nthe self and the world in history that was common to Christianity and\nJudaism, Rosenzweig no longer saw himself compelled to convert, and\ninstead committed himself to a return to the Judaism that was his by\nbirth.\n",
