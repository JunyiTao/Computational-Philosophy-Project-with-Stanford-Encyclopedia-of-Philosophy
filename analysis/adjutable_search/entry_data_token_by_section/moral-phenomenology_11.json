    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics || Monism vs. pluralism\n3.2 Monism vs. pluralism\n\nThis distinction cuts across the deontology/consequentialism/virtue\nethics distinctions. A monistic moral theory of right action takes\nthere to be a single right-making feature of actions, while pluralist\nviews take there to be more than one. According to one sort of\nhedonistic act utilitarian ethical theory, there is a single\nfundamental descriptive property\u2014an action\u2019s utility,\nunderstood as the net balance of pleasure versus pain it would bring\nabout\u2014that explains why some actions are wrong (they fail to\nmaximize utility) and others are not. This kind of monistic theory is\nopposed by such pluralist theories as Ross\u2019s ethics of prima\nfacie duty, according to which there is a multiplicity of\nbasic right (and wrong)-making features; Ross identified\nseven: fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence,\nself-improvement, and non-maleficence. How might considerations of\nmoral phenomenology be brought to bear on this dispute?\n\nOne sort of phenomenological argument appeals to the difference\nbetween experiences of regret and remorse. Assume (along with those\nwho marshal this argument) that it makes sense to regret finding\noneself in circumstances involving difficult moral choices, while it\nmakes sense to feel remorse about having acted wrongly. Suppose, then,\nthat in the past a co-worker had intervened to save your job from a\nvindictive administrator who unjustly wanted you fired for personal\nreasons not related to how well you did your job. Now, some years\nlater you both find yourselves in new positions. You are asked by a\nsupervisor your opinion of your co-worker\u2019s suitability for\ntheir current position and your honest opinion is that they are not\nsuitable. On Ross\u2019s ethical theory, both the prima\nfacie duty of gratitude and the prima facie duty of\nfidelity apply to this situation and one must choose which of them is\nmost stringent in these particular circumstances. Suppose you choose\nto answer truthfully about your colleague\u2019s job performance.\nBesides the regret you feel about finding yourself in this difficult\nsituation, on Ross\u2019s view, whichever choice you make, it is\nfitting for you to feel some remorse for not having complied with the\nprima facie duty of gratitude, which was in force when you\nmade your decision. By contrast, on a monist theory like hedonistic\nutilitarianism where the only right-making feature of actions is their\nutility, it is not fitting to feel remorse if being truthful in this\ncircumstance brings about a higher degree of utility than lying. In\nchoosing to truthfully express one\u2019s opinion, one does not leave\nundone a duty that was in force, even if overridden. Thus, on a\nmonistic view, the conflict is only apparent, while on a pluralist\nview it is genuine. The argument, then, is that a pluralist view\naccommodates people\u2019s experiences of remorse (not mere regret)\nin such circumstances, thus making sense of agonizing moral decisions\n(as Michael Gill 2012 labels such cases) as they are normally\nexperienced (see also McNaughton 1988: chap. 13).\n\nWhat Ross\u2019s theory takes for granted is that in any circumstance\nwhere one might do something out of gratitude (and similarly for all\nof the basic Rossian prima facie duties) the fact that the\nact would be an expression of gratitude is always relevant in\nassessing one\u2019s moral obligations, and always counts as a\nfavoring reason for expressing gratitude, even if in some\ncircumstances like the one just described, it is overridden. This\nreveals a commitment to what is called \u201creasons atomism\u201d\nwhich is opposed by holistic conceptions of reasons, our next\ntopic.\n",
