The puzzle is that\nalthough idealizations seem to provide real epistemic benefits, the\nbenefits cannot apparently be identified with truth, because to the\nextent that they falsify or mispresent the world, idealizations often\nfail to reflect the truth. For example, idealizations often appeal to\nentities that do not and perhaps cannot exist\u2014fully rational\nagents, frictionless planes, etc. Or they subtract important worldly\nelements from their accounts\u2014e.g., long range inter-molecular\nforces.\n\nYet if idealizations provide epistemic benefits, and we cannot readily\nthink of the benefits in terms of truth, then how exactly should we\nthink about them? According to some philosophers, we should think not\nin terms of truth but rather in terms of understanding. Understanding\nis the epistemic benefit we receive from idealizations, and\nunderstanding and truth can come apart. On this view, understanding\n(unlike knowledge) can therefore be \u201cnon-factive\u201d (Elgin\n2004, 2017; Potochnik 2017; cf. Sullivan & Khalifa 2019).\n\nFor instance, Elgin asks us to consider a paint sample we might see in\na hardware store\u2014say, of the shade jonquil yellow (Elgin 2017:\n187). While the sample might in fact be subtly different than the\nactual shade, and hence in that sense misrepresent it, it nonetheless\nseems to provide epistemic access to the shade. Idealizations such as\nthe Ideal Gas Law or Snell\u2019s law work are then held to work in a\nsimilar way. They represent not by mirroring but rather by\nexemplifying certain aspects of the target system, and via the\nmechanism of exemplification enable understanding of the system (Elgin\n2017).\n\nOthers agree that idealizations enable scientists to understand the\nworld even though, strictly speaking, the\u00a0idealizations\nmisrepresent their target systems. According to Angela Potochnik\n(2017), this is because the systems studied by scientists are\nenormously complex networks of causal patterns and interactions.\nParticular interests and cognitive limitations will lead scientists to\nfocus on some of these causal patterns and neglect others, and they\nmight get those particular patterns right. In the process, however,\nthey will misrepresent the actual messy complexity of the target\nsystem, and the understanding of phenomena that results will thereby\nbe non-factive.\n\nFor Strevens, idealizations enable understanding because they draw\nattention to the difference makers that bring about the thing to be\nexplained (Strevens 2017). More exactly, idealizations help us to\nappreciate the factors that make a difference to bringing about the\nphenomena we want to explain, and to identifying the factors that do\nnot make a difference. The Ideal Gas Law helps us to understand the\nBoylean behavior of a gas, for example, even though the law imagines\nthat there are zero long-range forces at work, because the existence\nof those long-rage forces does not make a difference to the derivation\nof the Boylean behavior: they are insignificant enough that their\nvalues can be set to zero without loss.\n\nOne difference between theorists such as Strevens and Potochnik may\nlie in the nature of the explanandum. For Potochnik, it seems clear\nthat the thing to be explained is a concrete, coarse-grained\nphenomenon: the behavior of a gas in a container, for example. For\nStrevens, it is a more abstract, fine-grained, and high-level event:\nthe expansion of the gas. Thus for Strevens the thing to be explained\nis something along the lines of: that the gas expanded, not\nhow it expanded. If one were to hold the explanandum\nconsistent, there might be notable agreement between these views\n(though see Potochnik 2016 for further discussion).\n",
