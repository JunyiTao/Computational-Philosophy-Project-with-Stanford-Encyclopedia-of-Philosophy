    "main_text": "Transcendental idealism || The two-aspects interpretation\n3.2 The two-aspects interpretation\n\nThe two-aspects reading attempts to interpret Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism in a way that enables it to be defended\nagainst at least some of these objections. On this view,\ntranscendental idealism does not distinguish between two classes of\nobjects but rather between two different aspects of one and the same\nclass of objects. For this reason it is also called the one-world\ninterpretation, since it holds that there is only one world in\nKant\u2019s ontology, and that at least some objects in that world\nhave two different aspects: one aspect that appears to us, and another\naspect that does not appear to us. That is, appearances are aspects of\nthe same objects that also exist in themselves. So, on this reading,\nappearances are not mental representations, and transcendental\nidealism is not a form of\n phenomenalism.[11]\n\nThere are at least two main versions of the two-aspects theory. One\nversion treats transcendental idealism as a metaphysical theory\naccording to which objects have two aspects in the sense that they\nhave two sets of properties: one set of relational properties that\nappear to us and are spatial and temporal, and another set of\nintrinsic properties that do not appear to us and are not spatial or\ntemporal (Langton 1998). This property-dualist interpretation faces\nepistemological objections similar to those faced by the two-objects\ninterpretation, because we are in no better position to acquire\nknowledge about properties that do not appear to us than we are to\nacquire knowledge about objects that do not appear to us. Moreover,\nthis interpretation also seems to imply that things in themselves are\nspatial and temporal, since appearances have spatial and temporal\nproperties, and on this view appearances are the same objects as\nthings in themselves. But Kant explicitly denies that space and time\nare properties of things in themselves.\n\nA second version of the two-aspects theory departs more radically from\nthe traditional two-objects interpretation by denying that\ntranscendental idealism is at bottom a metaphysical theory. Instead,\nit interprets transcendental idealism as a fundamentally\nepistemological theory that distinguishes between two standpoints on\nthe objects of experience: the human standpoint, from which objects\nare viewed relative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human\ncognitive faculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible\nintuition); and the standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which\nthe same objects could be known in themselves and independently of any\nepistemic conditions (Allison 2004). Human beings cannot really take\nup the latter standpoint but can form only an empty concept of things\nas they exist in themselves by abstracting from all the content of our\nexperience and leaving only the purely formal thought of an object in\ngeneral. So transcendental idealism, on this interpretation, is\nessentially the thesis that we are limited to the human standpoint,\nand the concept of a thing in itself plays the role of enabling us to\nchart the boundaries of the human standpoint by stepping beyond them\nin abstract (but empty) thought.\n\nOne criticism of this epistemological version of the two-aspects\ntheory is that it avoids the objections to other interpretations by\nattributing to Kant a more limited project than the text of the\nCritique warrants. There are passages that support this\n reading.[12]\n But there are also many passages in both editions of the\nCritique in which Kant describes appearances as\nrepresentations in the mind and in which his distinction between\nappearances and things in themselves is given not only epistemological\nbut metaphysical\n significance.[13]\n It is unclear whether all of these texts admit of a single,\nconsistent interpretation. \n",
