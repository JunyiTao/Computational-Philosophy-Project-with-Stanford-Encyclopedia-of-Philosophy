Natural Philosophy\n\n\nIf pre-established harmony fails to account for the world\u2019s\ncontingency, it must be asked whether Ward\u2019s theory of\ninteracting monads can explain nature\u2019s order and regularity. The\nelement of contingency that pervades the world is immediately accounted\nfor by the assumption that the ultimate constituents of reality are\n\u2018living\u2019 subjects, but how do orderly processes emerge?\nWard formulates this question as follows: \u201cCan we conceive such\nan interaction of spontaneous agents\u2026, taking on the appearance\nof mechanism?\u201d (1927: 239).\n\n\nThe solution consists in interpreting nature after a social analogy.\nThe following thought-experiment illustrates the idea: \u201cLet us\nimagine a great multitude of human beings, varying in tastes and\nendowments as widely as human beings are known to do, and let us\nsuppose this multitude suddenly to find themselves, as Adam and Eve\ndid, in an ample Paradise enriched sufficiently with diverse natural\nresources to make the attainment of high civilization possible\u201d\n(1911: 54). It is obvious to Ward that such individuals would\ngradually achieve a hierarchical, specialized form of social\norganization. To a hypothetical external observer, the initial phases\nof the new life of the selected individuals will appear utterly\nchaotic, but in due course order and regularity would emerge:\n\u201c\u2026in place of an incoherent multitude, all seemingly\nacting at random, we should have a social and economic organization,\nevery member of which had his appropriate place and function\u201d\n(55\u201356).\n\n\nIt is after this fashion that nature should be understood. Consider\nan apparently inert object such as a piece of rock. This is not an\naggregate of material atoms, but a society of active subjects. Starting\nout from a state of mutual isolation, Ward speculates, a plurality of\nmonads might end up finding a satisfactory modus vivendi.\nThese monads might then continue to stick together\u2014either because\nthey are unwilling to break out of the social structures in which they\nare embedded, or because they have become unable to do so. To clarify\nthis concept, Ward appeals to an ingenious simile:\n\n\n\u2026as there are some individuals who are restless, enterprising\nand inventing to the end of their days, so there are others who early\nbecome supine and contented, the slaves of custom and let well alone.\nThe simpler their standard of well-being and the less differentiated\ntheir environment the more monotonous their behavior will be and the\nmore inert they will appear. (60)\n\n\nThus, monads might get imprisoned within a form of life in the same\nway in which persons might get imprisoned in their habits. While the\nmore energetic monads will try to escape routine, other will acquiesce\nin it. It is the passivity and repetitiveness of the monad\u2019s\nbehavior that generates \u2018the appearance of mechanism.\u2019\n\n\nIn spite of the rejection of pre-established harmony, this\nconception still owes much to Leibniz\u2019s teaching. On Ward\u2019s\nview, the physical objects apprehended in ordinary experience are the\nappearance to us of a structured conglomerate, or societal whole, of\nliving subjects (1927: 239). Such appearances are not illusions. Our\nimmediate sensations fail to reproduce the object\u2019s real internal\nconstitution, yet they do point toward realities actually existing\nindependently of the perceiving subject. Ward\u2019s metaphysical\nidealism thus comes with a form of epistemological realism, while his\nconception of every-day physical objects is virtually identical with\nLeibniz\u2019s notion of phenomena bene fundata.\nStated in Kantian terminology, physical objects are the appearances to\nus of things whose noumenal being or intrinsic nature is\nmental or experiential. According to Ward (1911: 392), Kant too was\nforcefully drawn to this position, even in his critical phase and in\nspite of his notorious claim that noumena lie outside the\ncategories of the understanding and sensible intuition.\n\n\nWard\u2019s social account of the natural world provides the\nfoundation for an original account of natural laws that he conceived of\nas statistical, evolved and transient. In\nthe first place, in a universe that is ultimately social, natural laws\nmust be of the like of economic or anthropological laws; as such, they\nhold for groups of monads rather than for individual ones and are\nstatistical generalizations rather than eternally fixed decrees.\nSecondly, natural laws are to be regarded as the products of evolution\nbecause they record the habitual behavior of groups of socialized\nmonads, and habits have to be acquired or \u2018learned\u2019 over\ntime. Thirdly, it is a historical platitude that societies emerge and\ndecay. Since the natural laws dominating a given epoch depend upon that\nepoch\u2019s social order, natural laws cannot be regarded as\nimmutable; like all finite realities, they too are likely to change in\nthe course of cosmic history.\n\n\nAnother notable Cambridge thinker and Leibnizian scholar, Charles\nDunbar Broad, nicely summarized Ward\u2019s conception with the\nfollowing words:\n\n\n\u2026it seems quite impossible to explain the higher types of\nmental fact materialistically, whilst it does not seem impossible to\nregard physical and chemical laws as statistical uniformities about\nvery large collections of very stupid minds. (Broad 1975: 169)\n\n\nWard\u2019s account might be profitably compared with a similar one\nprovided by Charles Sanders Peirce in his important essay of 1891,\n\u2018The Architecture of Theories.\u2019 Here, Peirce advocates the\nview that \u201cthe only intelligible theory of the universe is that\nof objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits\nbecoming physical laws\u201d (153). Furthermore, he contends that\n\u201cthe only possible way of accounting for the laws of nature and\nfor uniformity in general is to suppose them results of evolution. This\nsupposes them not to be absolute, not to be obeyed precisely. It makes\nan element of indeterminacy, spontaneity, or absolute chance in\nnature\u201d (148).\n\n\nDespite the analogies, a major point of controversy is represented\nby Peirce\u2019s tychism\u2014the doctrine hinted at in the\njust quoted passage that \u2018absolute chance\u2019 (tyche)\nis of the essence of the universe. The disagreement is not as to\nwhether there is a level of reality that escapes external\ndetermination\u2014a striking anticipation of Heisenberg\u2019s\nindeterminacy principle that both Peirce and Ward endorse. The question\nis as to how that most fundamental level is to be understood. In a\npassage that can only be interpreted as a reply to Peirce, Ward\nwrites:\n\n\nSome pluralists, very ill advisedly as I think, have identified this\nelement [contingency, what is unpredictable in the world] with pure\nchance and even proposed to elevate it to the place of a guiding\nprinciple under the title of \u2018tychism\u2019 [\u2026] But every\nact of a conative agent is determined by\u2014what may, in a wide\nsense, be called\u2014a motive, and motivation is incompatible with\nchance, though in the concrete it be not reducible to law. (1911:\n76)\n\n\nThis critique rests upon the argument that\u2014since monads are\n\u2018subjects\u2019 in the full sense of the term\u2014they cannot\nact at random; specifically, monads act either in order to secure\nself-preservation or to achieve self-realization. This doctrine is\nphenomenologically well-grounded. Our own psychic life provides us with\nan immediate grasp of the inner life of a monadic creature, and it is\nclear to Ward that we do experience ourselves as motivated in this\nway.\n\n\nIn sum, for Ward it is the \u2018teleological\u2019 that grounds\nthe \u2018mechanical.\u2019 A monad always aims at self-preservation\nand self-realization; this is the simplest way in which the\nmonad\u2019s conatus\u2014or will to live\u2014manifests\nitself. At the same time, self-preservation and self-realization are\ntwo fundamental metaphysical parameters, the defining features of each\nmonad\u2019s \u2018character.\u2019 If the need for\nself-preservation predominates, the monad will acquiesce in its\nacquired status. These are Broad\u2019s \u2018stupid minds\u2019 and\nrepresents the conservative elements in nature. Per contra,\n\u2018intelligent\u2019 monads actively seek self-realization. Their\nimportance in the cosmic scheme cannot be underestimated; eventually,\nit is their craving for novelties that powers evolution and prevents\nhistory from coming to a halt.\n",
