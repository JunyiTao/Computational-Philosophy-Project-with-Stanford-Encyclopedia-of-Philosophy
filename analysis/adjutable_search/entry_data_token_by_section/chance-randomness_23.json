    "main_text": "Chance, Randomness, and Determinism || Randomness and Determinism\n7.2 Randomness and Determinism\n\n\nWe could give an argument for P2 if it could be shown that, from the\nabove definition of determinism, we could conclude (i) that only\nrandom sequences could occur under indeterminism, and (ii) that random\nsequences could only occur under indeterminism. However, both parts of\nthis claim are problematic.\n\nTheorem 8 (Humphreys 1978). There is a theory which\nis deterministic in the sense of Montague which has as a model a\nsystem which produces sequences which are random in the sense of von\nMises/Church.\n\n\nThe proof of this theorem relies on the fact that a theory can be\nnon-trivially deterministic without being computable. There is an\narithmetically definable function which governs the evolution of the\nsystem over time (in Humphrey\u2019s construction, the instantaneous state\nof the system is an arithmetically definable function of the time,\nwhich ensures that any two models agreeing at one time will agree at\nall times, guaranteeing determinism). But the function is not\neffectively computable, so no algorithm can produce the sequence of\n states that this system goes\n through.[26]\n The physical\nsignificance of such uncomputable functions is not clear (though see\nPour-El and Richards 1983), but the possibility of a deterministic\nphysics which features such equations of motion is enough to undermine\na close connection between randomness and indeterminism. This shows\nthat claim (ii) above is false.\n\n\n Moreover, since we\u2019ve already seen\n (\u00a74.1)\n that it is possible for a chancy and indeterministic process to produce\na non-random sequence of outcomes, and such a sequence would not be\nrandom, we also have a counterexample to claim (i). Claim (i) could be\nsaved if we made a more robust claim about what could happen under\nindeterminism. There is a sense in which, while it is possible that a\nfair coin could land heads an infinite number of times, it would\nnot. That is, the counterfactual \u2018If I tossed the coin an\ninfinite number of times, it wouldn\u2019t land all heads\u2019 is\napparently true. There is some question whether the counterfactual\nreally is true; Lewis (1979a) and Williams (2008) argue that it is,\nwhile Hawthorne (2005)  argues that it is not. But if it is, the way lies open to\ndefend a modified counterfactual version of P2:\n\nP\\(2'\\):\n\nA possible sequence of outcomes is random iff it is not the case that,\nwere an indeterministic process to be repeated infinitely, it would not\nproduce that sequence of outcomes.\n\n\nBut this is highly controversial; and the problem for claim (ii)\nwould still stand.\n\n\nIf we are to accept this argument, then, we shall have to take P2 as\nan independent truth about randomness. Analyses of randomness as\nindeterminism, which take P2 to be analytic, have been given: to their\ndetriment, if the foregoing observations are correct. Hellman (1978:\n83) suggests that randomness is \u2018roughly interchangeable with\n\u201cindeterministic\u201d\u2019, while Ekeland (1988: 49) says\n\u2018the main feature of randomness is some degree of independence\nfrom the initial conditions. \u2026 Better still, if one performs\nthe same experiment twice with the same initial conditions, one may\nget two different outcomes\u2019.\n\n\nHowever, it has been argued that this view of randomness as\nindeterminism makes it difficult to understand many of the uses of\nrandomness in science (Eagle 2005: \u00a73.2). This view entails that\nrandom sampling, and random outcomes in chaotic dynamics, and random\nmating in population genetics, etc., are not in fact random, despite\nthe plausibility of their being so. It does not apparently require\nfundamental indeterminism to have a randomised trial, and our\nconfidence in the deliverances of such trials does not depend on our\nconfidence that the trial design involved radioactive decay or some\nother fundamentally indeterministic process. Indeed, if Bohmians or\nEverettians are right (an open epistemic possibility), and quantum\nmechanics is deterministic, this view entails that nothing is actually\nrandom, not even the most intuitively compelling cases. This kind of\nview attributes to scientists a kind of error theory about many of\ntheir uses of the term \u2018random\u2019, but as yet the\nphilosophical evidence adduced to convict scientists of this pervasive\nerror is not compelling.\n\n\nOne reason for the continuing attractiveness of the thesis that\nrandomness is indeterminism may be the fact that, until quite\nrecently, there has been a tendency for philosophers and other to\nconfuse unpredictability and indeterminism. Laplace\u2019s original\nconception of determinism was an epistemic one:\n\n\n[A]n intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which\nnature is animated and the respective situation of all the [things\nwhich] compose it\u2014an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit\nthese data to analysis\u2014it would embrace in the same formula the\nmovements of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the\nlightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as\nwell as the past, would be present to its eyes. (Laplace 1826:\np. 4)\n\n\nThis kind of account still resonates with us, despite the fact that\nwith the Montague-Earman definition we now have a non-epistemic\ncharacterisation of determinism. Since random sequences will, almost\nalways, be unpredictable, it is clear why we might then taken them to\nbe indeterministic. But once we keep clear the distinction between\npredictability and determinism, we should be able to avoid this\nconfusion (Bishop, 2003; Schurz, 1995; Werndl, 2009).\n",
