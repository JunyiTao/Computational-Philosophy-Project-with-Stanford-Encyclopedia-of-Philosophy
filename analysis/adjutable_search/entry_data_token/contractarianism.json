The political theory of\nauthority claims that legitimate authority of government must derive\nfrom the consent of the governed, where the form and content of this\nconsent derives from the idea of contract or mutual agreement. The\nmoral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their\nnormative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement.\nContractarians are skeptical of the possibility of grounding morality\nor political authority in either divine will or some perfectionist\nideal of the nature of humanity. Social contract theorists from the\nhistory of political thought include Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and\nRousseau. The most important contemporary political social contract\ntheorist is John Rawls, who effectively resurrected social contract\ntheory in the second half of the 20th century, along with David\nGauthier, who is primarily a moral contractarian. There is no\nnecessity for a contractarian about political theory to be a\ncontractarian about moral theory, although most contemporary\ncontractarians are both. It has been more recently recognized that\nthere are two distinct strains of social contract thought, which now\ntypically go by the names contractarianism and\n contractualism.\n\nContractarianism, which stems from the Hobbesian line of social\ncontract thought, holds that persons are primarily self-interested,\nand that a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the\nmaximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally\n(where the moral norms are determined by the maximization of joint\ninterest) and to consent to governmental authority. Contractarianism\nargues that we each are motivated to accept morality \u201cfirst\nbecause we are vulnerable to the depredations of others, and second\nbecause we can all benefit from cooperation with others\u201d\n(Narveson 1988, 148). Contractualism, which stems from the Kantian\nline of social contract thought, holds that rationality requires that\nwe respect persons, which in turn requires that moral principles be\nsuch that they can be justified to each person. Thus, individuals are\nnot taken to be motivated by self-interest but rather by a commitment\nto publicly justify the standards of morality to which each will be\nheld. Where Gauthier, Narveson, or economist James Buchanan are the\nparadigm Hobbesian contractarians, Rawls or Thomas Scanlon would be\nthe paradigm Kantian contractualists. The rest of this entry will\nspecifically pertain to the contractarian strain wherever the two\ndiverge.\n", "toc": [{"#FundElemCont": "1.

Fundamental Elements of Contractarianism\n\nThe social contract has two fundamental elements: a characterization\nof the initial situation, called variously the \u201cstate of\nnature\u201d by the modern political philosophers, the\n\u201coriginal position\u201d by Rawls (1971, 17\u201322,\n118\u2013193), or the \u201cinitial bargaining position\u201d by\nGauthier (1986, 14\u201316, 131\u2013134, passim), and a\ncharacterization of the parties to the contract, particularly in terms\nof their rationality and motivation to come to agreement. The initial\nsituation posits what in bargaining theory is called the \u201cno\nagreement position,\u201d the situation to which the individuals\nreturn in case of failure to make an agreement or contract. This\nsituation may be more or less hostile, and more or less social,\ndepending on how the theorist characterizes human life in the absence\nof rules of morality or justice. But crucial to all contractarian\ntheories, there is some scarcity or motivation for competition in the\ninitial situation and there is some potential for gains from social\ninteraction and cooperation. \n\nIn contemporary normative contractarian theories, that is, theories\nthat attempt to ground the legitimacy of government or theories that\nclaim to derive a moral ought, the initial position represents the\nstarting point for a fair, impartial agreement. While contractualists\njustify the requirement of a fair, impartial agreement by reasons\nexternal to the contract, contractarians hold that the success of the\ncontract in securing cooperative interaction itself requires that the\nstarting point and procedures be fair and impartial.\n\nSome of the more recent literature focuses on how contractarian\ntheories can ensure the fairness and impartiality of the initial\nbargaining situation without appealing to any external, independent\nmoral norms as the contractualist does. For the contractarian, all\nmoral norms are supposed to be the result of agreement by rational\nagents, but if the contractarian has to appeal to prior moral norms in\norder to secure agreement then it\u2019s not clear what sort of work the\nagreement is actually doing in establishing the content of the moral\nnorms. At the same time, if there are no constraints at all over the\ninitial situation then the outcome agreed to may fail to be a moral\noutcome, and may instead be an outcome according to the principle, as\nRawls puts it, \u201cto each according to his threat\nadvantage\u201d (1971, 141). Two potential strategies are to argue that\nassumptions designed to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the\ninitial situation, such as the assumption that the contractors are\nsymmetrically situated, either follow as a condition of rationality or\nare justified on strategic grounds. The idea that certain assumptions\nlike symmetry follow as implications from the exercise of rationality\nhas attracted recent criticism on grounds that such assumptions\nrepresent substantive constraints theoretically inaccessible to\ncontractarians (Thrasher 2014). Others have attempted to defend the\npresence of such assumptions in contractarian theory (Thoma\n2015).\n\nSome points of controversy among contractarians concern the role of\nthe initial situation in the theory: is it to be considered an actual\nhistorical situation, a possible historical moment, or is the contract\nsituation completely hypothetical? David Hume (1987/1777, 470\u20131)\nwas the first to raise the decisive objection to any normative moral\nor political theory based on a historical contract: the consent of\none\u2019s ancestors do not bind oneself. Contemporary political\nphilosophers have raised similar concerns about a hypothetical\ncontract: insofar as the agreement is hypothetical then it\ncannot be said to represent agreement at all (Dworkin 1975). In\nresponse to these sorts of objections, some contractarians defend the\nhypothetical contract on heuristic grounds by insisting that the point\nof the contract device is not to directly bind the contractors but\nrather to provide a kind of thought experiment by which to discover\nthe requirements of practical rationality (Gauthier 1986, ch. VII).\nThat is, they argue that if one is rational, and among rational others\nin circumstances in which agreement is both possible and beneficial,\nthen rationality requires that one abide by the terms of the contract.\nWhile mainstream contractarian theories are hypothetical contract\ntheories, an interesting and powerfully subversive use of\ncontractarianism (Mills 1997; Pateman 1989; Pateman & Mills\n2007\u2014see section on Subversion of Contractarianism below) reads\nthe contract situation as historical agreements to erect and maintain\nwhite supremacy and patriarchy or male dominance. These latter\ncontractarian theories are not justifications of the status quo, of\ncourse, but rather explanations and condemnations, and therefore do\nnot face Hume\u2019s objection. Other questions that divide contemporary\ncontractarians include: What are the ideal conditions and who are the\nideal contractors that will make obligatory the outcomes of the\ncontract for actual persons? What is the content of the hypothetical\nagreement?\n\nThe second element of a contractarian theory characterizes the\npotential contractors. There are two subparts to this: first,\ncontractors have minimal other-directed desires or preferences, and\nsecond, contractors have a capacity for rational interaction with\nothers. Contractarian (as opposed to contractualist) theories embrace\na high standard for motivating making (and keeping) agreements. They\navoid assuming that persons have preferences for moral behavior as\nsuch in order to ground rules of morality or justice in rational\nself-interest. Since persons\u2019 interests do not necessarily include the\nwell-being of others, the main challenge for contractarianism is to\nshow that even without such other-directed preferences, it would be\nrational to be moral. Such self-directed preferences are called\n\u201cnon-tuistic\u201d (Gauthier 1986, 87). However, there are\nreasons to think that narrowing the preferences of contractors to\ninclude only non-tuistic preferences is neither necessary nor helpful\nin grounding morality. One reason is because such a restriction of\npreferences means that actual persons will not be willing to comply\nwith the bargain that is made, under the assumption that they do not\nhave such narrowly construed preferences (Hubin 1991). On the other\nhand, allowing positive tuistic preferences to play a role in\nbargaining on morality and justice may create the possibility for\nindividuals to be exploited for their fellow feelings (Dimock 1999).\nThis is especially a problem for women, as Dimock points out, since in\nmost cultures women are trained from childhood by sexist norms and\ngender roles to prefer the well-being of others to their own. Negative\ntuistic preferences pose a different challenge as a type of moral\nskepticism for either theorists who would exclude them or those who\nwould include them in a contractarian theory (Superson 2009). The\nformer group include Rawls and Gauthier, who have argued that negative\ntuistic preferences (envy, jealousy, spite, vengeance) make\ncooperation for mutual advantage impossible and therefore are\nirrational (Rawls 1971, 142\u2013150, 530\u2013534; Gauthier 1986,\n311, 329). But this response significantly narrows the scope of\napplication of the theory, since such emotions are common. The latter\ngroup faces the challenge of showing how mutual advantage overcomes\nthese negative, other-directed emotions.\n\nSecond, persons are presumed to be instrumentally rational and so\ncapable of understanding how the satisfaction of their desires can be\nhelped by cooperative social interaction. Contractarians characterize\npractical rationality instrumentally, subjectively, and\npreferentially. Acting rationally entails maximizing satisfaction of\none\u2019s own subjective preferences. Contractarians rely on the crucial\nfact about humans that we are able to cooperate to produce more than\neach working alone, thus making it rational to cooperate under at\nleast some terms. Self-interest and rationality imply a desire to\ncooperate provided that cooperators can do so without sacrificing\ntheir self-interest. The desire to benefit from cooperation in turn\nmakes persons rationally concerned about their reputations for\nadhering to the moral norms that make cooperation possible and\nrational. (See\n feminist perspectives on the self\n (Section 1, Critique) for a critique of this conception of the\nrational person.)\n\nContractarians seek to show that without rules of justice for\ncooperation, persons are worse off by their own lights. Hence it is\nrational to adopt some rules for morality and justice. These two\naspects of the contractarian individual\u2014self-interest and the\nability to benefit from interaction with others\u2014along with the\nconditions of moderate scarcity imply what Rawls following Hume called\nthe \u201ccircumstances of justice\u201d: the conditions under which\nrules for justice could be both possible and necessary (1971,\n109\u2013112). Justice, and a social contract, is only possible where\nthere is some possibility of benefit to each individual from\ncooperation.\n\nContractarian social contract theories take individuals to be the best\njudges of their interests and the means to satisfy their desires. For\nthis reason, there is a close connection between liberalism and\ncontractarianism. However, that is not to say that all contractarian\nthought is liberal. Hobbes, for example, argued in favor of what Jean\nHampton has called the \u201calienation contract\u201d (1986, 3,\n103, 256\u2013265), that is, a contract on the part of a people to\nalienate their rights to adjudicate their own disputes and\nself-defense to a sovereign, on the grounds that that was the only way\nto keep the peace given the nature of the alternative, which he\nfamously characterized as life that would be \u201csolitary, poore,\nnasty, brutish, and short.\u201d Thus, given a bad enough initial\nsituation, contractarianism may lead to the legitimation of\ntotalitarianism. Another point of criticism that arises from the\ncharacterization of the parties to the contract is that they must be\nable to contribute to the social product of interaction, or at least\nto threaten to destabilize it. This is because each individual has to\nbe able to benefit from the inclusion of all those included. But this\nthreatens to leave many, such as the severely disabled, the global\npoor, and animals outside the realm of justice, an implication that\nsome find completely unacceptable (Kittay 1999; Nussbaum 2006).\n\nSocial contract theories also require some rules to guide the\nformation of agreement. Since they are prior to the contract, there\nmust be some source of prior moral norms, whether natural, rational,\nor conventional. The first rule that is normally prescribed is that\nthere must be no force or fraud in the making of the agreement. No one\nis to be \u201ccoerced\u201d into agreement by the threat of\nphysical violence. The reasoning for this is quite straightforwardly\nprudential: if one is allowed to use violence, then there is no real\ndifference between the \u201ccontract\u201d arrived at and the state\nof nature for the threatened party, and hence no security in the\nagreement. However, there is a fine line between being coerced by the\nthreat of violence into giving up one\u2019s rights and being convinced by\nthe threat of penury to make an unfavorable agreement. For this reason\ncontractarians like Gauthier are able to argue for a fair and\nimpartial starting point for bargaining that will lead to secure and\nstable agreements. The second rule of contract is that each individual\nwho is a legitimate party to the contract must agree to the rules of\njustice, which are the outcomes of the contract.\n2. The Metaphor of Contract\n\nThe metaphor of the social contract requires some interpretation in\norder to apply it to the situation of morality or politics. The\ninterpretation can be specified by determining answers to three\nquestions. First, what is the agreement on? Possible answers include\nthe principles of justice (Rousseau, Rawls), the design of the basic\nsocial institutions (Rawls), the commitment to give up to a sovereign\ngovernment (some or all of) one\u2019s rights (Hobbes, Locke), the adoption\nof a disposition to be (conventionally) moral (Gauthier, Hampton). The\nsecond question is how the agreement is to be thought of: as a\nhypothetical agreement? An actual historical agreement? An implicit\nhistorical situation? The third question is whether the contract\ndevice is to be used as justification or explanation. As discussed\nabove, normative contractarianism uses the contract device primarily\nas justification, but it may be that Hobbes and Locke thought that\nthere was an explanatory element to the contract device. As will be\ndiscussed below (Subversive Contractarianism), an important\ncontemporary contractarianism uses an implicit contract to explain the\norigin of oppression. \n3. Answering the Moral Skeptic\n\nA brief sketch of the most complete and influential contemporary\ncontractarian theory, David Gauthier\u2019s, is in\norder. Gauthier\u2019s project in Morals By Agreement is to\nemploy a contractarian approach to grounding morality in rationality\nin order to defeat the moral skeptic. (However, Anita Superson (2009)\npoints out that Gauthier attempts to answer only the skeptic who asks\n\u201cwhy should I be moral?\u201d but leaves both the motive\nskeptic, who argues that it is enough to act morally but need not be\nmotivated by morality, and the amoralist, who denies that there is any\nsuch thing as morality, that is, that there are true moral\nstatements.)  It is generally assumed that humans can have no perfect\nnatural harmony of interests (otherwise morality would be largely\nsuperfluous), and that there is much for each individual to gain\nthrough cooperation. However, moral constraint on the pursuit of\nindividual self-interest is required because cooperative activities\nalmost inevitably lead to a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: a situation in\nwhich the best individual outcomes can be had by those who cheat on\nthe agreement while the others keep their part of the bargain. This\nleads to the socially and individually sub-optimal outcome wherein\neach can expect to be cheated by the other. But by disposing\nthemselves to act according to the requirements of morality whenever\nothers are also so disposed, they can gain each others\u2019 trust\nand cooperate successfully.\n\n\nThe contractarian element of the theory comes in the derivation of the\nmoral norms. The compliance problem\u2014the problem of justifying\nrational compliance with the norms that have been accepted\u2014must\ndrive the justification of the initial situation and the conduct of\nthe contracting situation. It is helpful to think of the contract\nsituation as a bargain, in which each party is trying to negotiate the\nmoral rules that will allow them to realize optimal utility, and this\nhas led philosophers to apply a number of bargaining solutions to the\ninitial contract situation. Gauthier\u2019s solution is the \u201cminimax\nrelative concession\u201d (1986, ch. V). The idea of minimax relative\nconcession is that each bargainer will be most concerned with the\nconcessions that she makes from her ideal outcome relative to the\nconcessions that others make. If she sees her concessions as\nreasonable relative to the others, considering that she wants to\nensure as much for herself as she can while securing agreement (and\nthereby avoiding the zero-point: no share of the cooperative surplus)\nand subsequent compliance from the others, then she will agree to it.\nWhat would then be the reasonable outcome? The reasonable outcome,\naccording to this view, is the outcome that minimizes the maximum\nrelative concessions of each party to the bargain (Gauthier 1986, ch.\nV).\n\nIn a more recent article and in contrast to his previous view,\nGauthier rejects the idea that the problem of grounding morality in\nrationality should be framed as a bargaining problem at all\n(2013). When the problem is framed in this way, the solution depends\non assuming that the parties participating in the contract\nnegotiations are all rational maximizers. Under his revised view,\nhowever, he neither sees the problem as a bargaining problem nor the\nparties as (constrained) rational maximizers; instead, he conceives of\nthem as Pareto-optimizers. As Pareto-optimizers or rational\ncooperators, the parties seek to produce a Pareto-optimal outcome,\nwhich is an outcome where it is not possible to increase the payoff to\none party without decreasing the payoff to another party. If it is\npossible to move to another outcome to increase the payoff accruing to\none party without decreasing the payoff to another party, then the\ncurrent outcome is not Pareto-optimal. It is important to note that\nthis change is not meant to attach additional motives to the parties\nin addition to the motive of self-interest. Rational cooperation,\naccording to Gauthier, provides an alternative conception of what\nconstitutes rational action. Rational cooperators do not want to leave\nthe additional benefits of cooperation on the table.  How do these\nchanges solve the original problem of grounding morality in (this\nconception of) rationality? The answer is to calculate the payoffs for\neach outcome in terms of cooperative benefits or the absence of\ncooperative benefits. For example, the cooperative minimum is a payoff\nwhich provides one party with none of benefits generated through\ncooperation. In contrast, the cooperative maximum is the payoff which\naffords a single party all of the possible benefits generated through\ncooperation. The potential cooperative gain is the difference between\nthese two. The actual cooperative gain is then the difference between\nits payoff and the party\u2019s cooperative minimum. Next, the actual\ncooperative gain is then to be divided by the party\u2019s potential\ncooperative gain. This generates the party\u2019s proportionate gain,\nwhich shows the actual gain as a proportion of the party\u2019s\npotential gain from cooperation. Each outcome is then represented as a\nproportionate gain from cooperation. Finally, the goal is to select\nthat outcome generating the maximum minimum proportionate gain to any\nsingle party. This principle, which Gauthier calls maximin\nproportionate gain, selects a Pareto-optimal outcome that would be\nrational for parties to select.\n\n\nEqually important to the solution as the procedure is the starting\npoint from which the parties begin. For some contractarians (like\nGauthier) there is no veil of ignorance\u2014each party to the\ncontract is fully informed of their personal attributes and holdings.\nHowever, without the veil of ignorance, contractors will be aware of\nthe differences in bargaining power that could potentially affect the\noutcome of the bargain. It is important, then, that the initial\nposition must have been arrived at non-coercively if compliance to the\nagreement is to be secured. A form of the \u201cLockean\nproviso\u201d (modeled after Locke\u2019s description of the initial\nsituation of his social contract): that one cannot have bettered\nhimself by worsening others, may turn out to be beneficial in cases\nwithout a veil of ignorance. In sum, the moral norms that rational\ncontractors will adopt (and comply with) are those norms that would be\nreached by the contractors beginning from a position each has attained\nthrough her own actions which have not worsened anyone else, and\nadopting as their principle for agreement the rule of minimax relative\nconcession (Gauthier 1986, ch. VII).\n\nOn one line of thought, contractarianism produces liberal individuals\nwho seem well suited to join the kind of society that Rawls envisioned\n(Gauthier 1986, ch. XI). On another line, the Hobbesian contractarian\nargument leads towards the sparse government of libertarianism\n(Narveson 1988). The controversy here turns on the primary motivation\nfor individuals to make agreements and cooperate. As we said before,\nthere are two such motivations for the Hobbesian contractarian: fear\nof the depredations of others and benefits from cooperation with\nothers. Libertarianism results when the first of these is primary,\nwhereas when the second is primary, the kind of reciprocity and\nsupportive government that will be discussed in the final section\nbecomes possible.\n4. Critiques of Normative Contractarianism\n\nMany critiques have been leveled against particular contractarian\ntheories and against contractarianism as a framework for normative\nthought about justice or morality. (See the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract.)\n Jean Hampton criticized Hobbes in her book Hobbes and the Social\nContract Tradition, in a way that has direct relevance to\ncontemporary contractarianism. Hampton argues that the\ncharacterization of individuals in the state of nature leads to a\ndilemma. Hobbes\u2019 state of nature as a potential war of all against all\ncan be generated either as a result of passions (greed and fear, in\nparticular) or rationality (prisoner\u2019s dilemma reasoning, in which the\nrational players each choose to renege on agreements made with each\nother). But if the passions account is correct, then contractors will\nstill be motivated by these passions after the social contract is\ndrawn up, and so will fail to comply with it (Hampton 1986). And if\nthe rationality account is correct, then rational actors will not\ncomply with the social contract any more than they will cooperate with\neach other before it is made.\n\nThis critique has an analog for theories (such as Gauthier\u2019s) that\nclaim that without the contract individuals will be stuck in some\nsocial sub-optimal situation that is bad enough to motivate them to\nmake concessions to each other for some agreement, yet the reason for\ntheir inability to cooperate without the contract cannot continue to\noperate after the contract is made. A potential solution to this\nproblem is to argue that individuals will choose to dispose themselves\nto be constrained (self-interest) maximizers rather than\nstraightforward (self-interest) maximizers, that is, to retrain\nthemselves not to think first of their self-interest but rather to\ndispose themselves to keep their agreements, provided that they find\nthemselves in an environment of like-minded individuals (Gauthier\n1986, 160\u2013166). But this solution has been found dubitable by\nmany commentators (see Vallentyne 1991).\n\nHampton also objects to the contemporary contractarian assumption that\ninteraction is merely instrumentally valuable. She argues that if\ninteraction were only valuable for the fruits of cooperation that it\nbears for self-interested cooperators, then it would be unlikely that\nthose cooperators could successfully solve the compliance problem. In\nshort, they are likely not to be able to motivate morality in\nthemselves without some natural inclination to morality.\nInterestingly, Hampton agrees with Gauthier that contractarianism is\nright to require any moral or political norms to appeal to individuals\u2019\nself-interest as a limitation on self-sacrifice or exploitation of any\nindividual.\n\nTwo further critiques can be raised against contractarianism\n(Southwood 2010). According to the normativity objection,\ncontractarian morality is not sufficiently other-regarding because it\nmotivates morality by appeal to one\u2019s self-interest rather than any\nconcern of others. Because of this, the theory gives one no reason to\nfeel guilt or remorse for wrongdoing, but rather, at most,\nself-directed anger or disappointment at acting irrationally.\nSouthwood\u2019s objection can be seen as one way of filling out Superson\u2019s\nclaim, mentioned above, that Gauthier\u2019s theory cannot respond to the\nmotive skeptic. This objection overlooks the fact that some appeal to\nothers\u2019 concerns is built into both the Lockean Proviso and the\nbargaining theory from which the content of the moral norms are\nderived. Furthermore, Kantian moral theory would seem to be subject to\nthe same objection insofar as it appeals to autonomous rationality as\nthe motive for acting morally. Gauthier can be seen as providing a\nresponse to the objection in the final chapter of Morals by\nAgreement, where he describes the \u201cliberal\nindividual,\u201d whose moral psychology is shaped by living the\nmoral life that mutual advantage contractarianism prescribes. \n\nAccording to the impartiality objection, all human persons are owed\ncertain duties regardless of their powers or abilities, and because it\nrelies on an instrumental and subjective conception of practical\nreason, contractarianism cannot explain how this would be\nso. Contractarianism, on the contrary, holds it to be irrational to\ntreat truly powerless persons equally, since it is not mutually\nadvantageous to do so. This problem, which is similar to the exclusion\nproblem discussed above and in section 6 below, is a serious problem.\nGauthier\u2019s Lockean Proviso was meant to rule out taking historical\npatterns of dominance into account, but even if all such dominance\nrelations were eliminated and bargaining were conditioned on\nundominated assets, the inequality in natural talents and abilities\nwould reintroduce the possibility of dominance.\n\nContractarianism has also been criticized on racial grounds (Williams\n1991). Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and\ncarry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while\nwhite men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory,\nBlacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and\nirrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are\ndependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors\nand others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be\nexcluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by\nother critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and\nmore recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are\ndependents such as children and disabled people left out of\nconsideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers\u2019 needs\nand interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as\nwell.\n5. Subversive Contractarianism\n\nA descriptive use to which contractarianism has been put is to exploit\nthe exclusionary, in-group/out-group nature of the contractarian\nproject to illuminate the phenomenon of oppression. Carole Pateman\u2019s\nThe Sexual Contract (1989) uses contractarian theory to argue\nthat there has been an implicit contract among men to enforce\npatriarchy. She calls her approach a \u201cconjectural\nhistory,\u201d which she uses both to illuminate the actual history\nof patriarchal oppression of women and the ideology of social contract\ntheory. Similarly, Charles Mills argues in The Racial\nContract (1997) that whites have had an actual, historical,\nsometimes explicit, though often only implicit, contract to enforce\nwhite supremacy. The arguments are similar in their contractarian\noutlines, though they differ in the historical and factual details.\nAccording to both philosophers\u2019 theories, there are moral, political,\nand epistemological terms of the contract, and its effect has been to\nallow one group of persons effectively to dominate, subordinate, and\nexploit another group. The moral terms require the dominant group to\nevaluate the lives of their group more highly than those of the\nsubordinated, the political to deprive the subordinate group of\neffective political power, and the epistemological terms require the\nmembers of the dominant group to see themselves as intellectually\nsuperior to the dominated. The social contract then can be seen as a\njustification by the parties to the contract of their interaction, and\nof their exploitation of those who are not parties to the contract,\nbut only if the fundamental division of in-group and out-group is\naccepted. If the racial and sexual contracts were to be shown to be\nrational, they would constitute prima facie critiques of normative\ncontractarianism, since they would then seem to justify racism and\nsexism. Pateman and Mills have more recently teamed up in Contract\nand Domination (2007) to explore their similarities and ways in which\nthey diverge. Pateman extends her critique of the ideology of contract\nto the case of colonial appropriation of native peoples\u2019 lands with\nwhat she calls the \u201csettler contract.\u201d Mills also extends\nhis analysis both in scope to include gender and class, and to give a\nnormative application of the descriptive contract to the issue of\nreparations for slavery. He calls this more general contract the\n\u201cdomination contract.\u201d While Pateman holds that\ncontractarianism essentially permits domination, Mills holds that\ncontract theory can be salvaged by beginning with a more realistic\nnon-ideal starting point and asking how existing injustice ought,\nrationally be eliminated. However, his positive theory is\ncontractualist rather than contractarian, as it begins with the\npremise of moral equality.\n\nSeveral of the critiques surveyed above, then, center on the\nquestions: who is allowed to be a party to the contract, and how are\nthose who are excluded from the contract to be treated? On the\nnormative contractarian view, it is only rational to include all of\nthose who can both benefit and reciprocate benefits to others.\nNormative contractarianism, then, on the assumption that non-whites\nand women can both benefit and reciprocate benefits to others, shows\nthe sexual and racial contracts to be fundamentally irrational.\nGauthier, in fact, explicitly argued that his contractarianism aids\nthe feminist project of ending exploitative intimate relationships.\nContractarian morality disapproves of relationships that are not\nmutually advantageous without assuming ties of affection. He writes,\n\u201csociality \u2026 becomes a source of exploitation if it\ninduces persons to acquiesce in institutions and practices that but\nfor their fellow-feelings would be costly to them\u201d (1984, 11).\nThis theme is taken up in some defenses of feminist contractarianism\n(Hampton 1993). In the debate over contractarianism in feminist\nthought, there is a concern that contractualists beg the question of\nintrinsic value, and it is thought, in contrast, that (Hobbesian)\ncontractarianism can underwrite feminist claims about the exploitative\nnature of caring relationships without the intrinsic value assumption\n(Sample 2002). Lastly, in the hands of some philosophers social\ncontract theory becomes a device for combating oppression, especially\ngender oppression, by uncovering adaptive preferences formed under\nconditions of oppression (Walsh 2015).\n6. Disability, Animals, Reciprocity, and Trust\n\nDisability rights activists, however, would still seem to have a\nserious complaint to lodge against normative contractarianism, since\nit is surely the case that there are persons who cannot reciprocate\nbenefits to others. Such persons would be, on the normative\ncontractarian view, beyond the scope of the rules of justice. Recent\nliterature on disability argues that, to the contrary,\ncontractarianism can be inclusive of the disabled. For example, it may\nbe argued that in fact most disabled persons and all caregivers would\nbe included in the bargaining group for clear strategic reasons\n(Becker 2005). The basic contractarian insight that cooperation is\nmutually advantageous implies that whenever someone can be included as\na contributing cooperator there are gains to be realized for all. Many\ndisabled people are either already capable of contributing or could be\nso with accommodation or rehabilitation, and thus it is to the\nadvantage of society to provide accommodations or rehabilitation at\nsome level, requiring reciprocal contributions from those thus\nbenefited. For those disabled persons who cannot be rehabilitated,\ncontractarianism provides a different solution, namely a\n\u201cmutually advantageous\u201d social insurance scheme that\noffers a dignified standard of care for anyone who needs it (Becker\n2005). One might object that the currently healthy contractors would\nnot see the need to pay premiums as high as the already disabled,\nsince they have a lower probability of needing the care. For this\ninsurance scheme to work (and to avoid adverse selection problems),\neveryone would need to agree to equal premiums without prior knowledge\nof their condition. But it is hard to see how a contractarian can\njustify this agreement. A contractualist, on the other hand, could\nargue that such an agreement could not be reasonably rejected. This\nline of argument would have to show that a similar argument could not\nbe made for any form of bad luck, on pain of this view devolving into\negalitarianism.\n\nSuch a view thus raises the objection that there is a level of need\nfor rehabilitation or accommodation that goes beyond any possible\nfuture expected contribution for a given disabled person. And disabled\npersons are not well placed to hold out a threat to destabilize\nsociety, so the motivation to contract with them must be the expected\nbenefit. Relying on only ideas of mutual advantage and reciprocity\nwould continue to leave these people\u2014the\n\u201coutliers\u201d\u2014outside the contract, languishing below\nan acceptable level of functioning which they could, given another\nmoral theory, rightfully claim. According to some, contracting need\nnot be essentially adversarial (Francis & Silvers 2005). Since the\nbenefits of mutual agreement are best achieved by \u201cpromoting\nstable compliance with mutual expectations\u201d (Francis &\nSilvers 2005, 60), the essential element of contract is the\ndevelopment of trust, and the deeper and more widespread the trust,\nthe lower the enforcement costs to contracting.  Granting the\nimportance of trust development, then, the disabled are as capable of\ncontributing to this climate, perhaps more so because of their greater\nvulnerability, as the able-bodied. By this they mean that disabled\npersons who rely on others for care can decide to put aside fears of\nbetrayal or neglect and remain positive and forward looking, and\nthereby bring about a positive affective climate in themselves and\ntheir caregivers. This affective work toward trust building becomes\ntheir contribution to the social good. Thus by focusing on the\nmotivation of cooperation for mutual advantage rather than fear of the\ndepredations of others, a more inclusive and positive contractarian\npolitical theory comes into view. This view depends on the assumption\n(similar to one made by Gauthier) that our moral psychology is such\nthat, once we develop our disposition to cooperate, we lose the\ndisposition to cheat on agreements we have made or harm others to\nsatisfy our immediate self interest. As mentioned earlier, this\nassumption has often been questioned by critics of\ncontractarianism.\n\nThe case for including animals within the scope of the rules of\njustice produced by the contract is more difficult to make because,\nunlike the disabled who may only require and depend on appropriate\naccommodations in order to reciprocate, animals may be considered\nincapable of reciprocating benefits to others and are also incapable\nof rational interaction. If contractarianism is at all able to account\nfor the moral standing of animals, then it has to do so in a more\nindirect way than in the case of the disabled. It may be possible to\nground the moral standing of animals as part of a contract agreed to\nby other contractors who are capable of rational interaction (Cohen\n2007, 2009). Suppose that Bob agrees to form a contract with Jane only\non the condition that Jane also attributes direct moral standing to\nBob\u2019s pet dog, Rosko. As a result of the contract between Bob and\nJane, Rosko gains intrinsic moral standing that imposes correlative\nmoral duties on Jane. If Jane were to harm Rosko in some way, she\nwould not only violate a duty to Rosko\u2019s owner, Bob, but she would\nalso violate a duty that she has to Rosko who possesses\nintrinsic moral standing of his own. In this way bilateral agreements\nbetween contractors could potentially extend the scope of the rules of\njustice to apply to beings both incapable of rational interaction and\narguably incapable of reciprocating benefits to others.\n\nDeriving the moral standing of beings from agreements reached by other\ncontractors not only assumes that contractors have tuistic\npreferences, an assumption rejected by many contractarians, but it\nalso potentially makes the moral standing of those beings contingent\non the nature of the tuistic preferences and interests held by others\n(Tanner 2013). Contractors may agree to protect only certain kinds of\nanimals, and they may make agreements to protect animals only when\ndoing so does not conflict with their own, more narrowly construed\ninterests. As a result, the status of those who cannot participate in\nthe initial situation for various reasons, such as the disabled and\nanimals, remains a contentious issue in contractarian thought.\n",
