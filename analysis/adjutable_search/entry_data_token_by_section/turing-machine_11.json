    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues Related to Turing Machines || Thesis, Definition, Axioms or Theorem\n3.2 Thesis, Definition, Axioms or Theorem\n\nAs is clear, strictly speaking, Turing\u2019s thesis is not provable,\nsince, in its original form, it is a claim about the relationship\nbetween a formal and a vague or intuitive concept. By consequence,\nmany consider it as a thesis or a definition. The thesis would be\nrefuted if one would be able to provide an intuitively acceptable\neffective procedure for a task that is not Turing-computable. This\nfar, no such counterexample has been found. Other independently\ndefined notions of computability based on alternative foundations,\nsuch as\n recursive functions\n and abacus machines have also been shown to be equivalent to Turing\ncomputability. These equivalences between quite different formulations\nindicate that there is a natural and robust notion of computability\nunderlying our understanding. Given this apparent robustness of our\nnotion of computability, some have proposed to avoid the notion of a\nthesis altogether and instead propose a set of axioms used to sharpen\nthe informal notion. There are several approaches, most notably, an\napproach of structural axiomatization where computability itself is\naxiomatized (Sieg 2008) and one whereby an axiomatization is given\nfrom which the Church-Turing thesis can be derived (Dershowitz &\nGurevich 2008).\n",
