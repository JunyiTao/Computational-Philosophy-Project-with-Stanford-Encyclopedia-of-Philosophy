    "main_text": "\n\nRoderick Milton Chisholm is widely regarded as one of the most\ncreative, productive, and influential American philosophers of the\n20th Century. Chisholm worked in epistemology, metaphysics,\nethics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and other areas.\nHis work constitutes a grand philosophical system somewhat in the\nmanner of Leibniz or Descartes. Chisholm continually refined \u2014\nand sometimes utterly revised \u2014 his views. He was a prolific\nwriter. The bibliography of his written work in [LLP] contains\ncitations of 320 items, including journal articles, reviews, and\nbooks. His work in epistemology alone would probably guarantee his\nposition as an outstanding figure in American philosophy. Yet he made\nmajor contributions in several areas of metaphysics and ethics as\nwell. As a result, it would be impossible to give a comprehensive\naccount of Chisholm\u2019s system in a brief article. Thus, in this\narticle we attempt to present no more than a sketch of some of\nChisholm\u2019s most distinctive and important views. We do not claim\nto present his \u201cfinal, authoritative view\u201d in any area.\nNor do we discuss the critical secondary literature concerning his\nviews.\n",
