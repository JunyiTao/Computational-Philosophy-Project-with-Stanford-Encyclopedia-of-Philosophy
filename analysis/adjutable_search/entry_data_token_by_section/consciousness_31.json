    "main_text": "Metaphysical theories of consciousness || Dualist theories\n8.1 Dualist theories\n\nDualist theories regard at least some aspects of\nconsciousness as falling outside the realm of the physical,but specific\nforms of dualism differ in just which aspects those are. (See the entry\n on\n dualism.)\n\nSubstance dualism, such as traditional Cartesian dualism\n(Descartes 1644), asserts the existence of both physical and\nnon-physical substances. Such theories entail the existence of\nnon-physical minds or selves as entities in which consciousness\ninheres. Though substance dualism is at present largely out of favor,\nit does have some contemporary proponents (Swinburne 1986, Foster 1989,\n1996).\n\nProperty dualism in its several versions enjoys a greater\nlevel of current support. All such theories assert the existence of\nconscious properties that are neither identical with nor reducible to\nphysical properties but which may nonetheless be instantiated by the\nvery same things that instantiate physical properties. In that respect\nthey might be classified as dual aspect theories. They take\nsome parts of reality\u2014organisms, brains, neural states or\nprocesses\u2014to instantiate properties of two distinct and\ndisjoint sorts: physical ones and conscious, phenomenal or qualitative\nones. Dual aspect or property dualist theories can be of at least three\ndifferent types.\n\nFundamental property dualism regards conscious mental\nproperties as basic constituents of reality on a par with fundamental\nphysical properties such as electromagnetic charge. They may interact\nin causal and law-like ways with other fundamental properties such as\nthose of physics, but ontologically their existence is not dependent\nupon nor derivative from any other properties (Chalmers 1996).\n\nEmergent property dualism treats conscious properties as\narising from complex organizations of physical constituents but as\ndoing so in a radical way such that the emergent result is something\nover and above its physical causes and is not a priori\npredictable from nor explicable in terms of their strictly physical\nnatures. The coherence of such emergent views has been challenged (Kim\n1998) but they have supporters (Hasker 1999).\n\nNeutral monist property dualism treats both conscious\nmental properties and physical properties as in some way dependent upon\nand derivative from a more basic level of reality, that in itself is\nneither mental nor physical (Russell 1927, Strawson 1994). However, if\none takes dualism to be a claim about there being two distinct realms\nof fundamental entities or properties, then perhaps neutral monism\nshould not be classified as a version of property dualism in so far as\nit does not regard either mental or physical properties as ultimate or\nfundamental.\n\nPanpsychism might be regarded as a fourth type of property\ndualism in that it regards all the constituents of reality as having\nsome psychic, or at least proto-psychic, properties distinct from\nwhatever physical properties they may have (Nagel 1979). Indeed\nneutral monism might be consistently combined with some version\nof panprotopsychism (Chalmers 1996) according to which the\nproto-mental aspects of micro-constituents can give rise under\nsuitable conditions of combination to full blown consciousness. (See\nthe entry on\n panpsychism.)\n\nThe nature of the relevant proto-psychic aspect remains unclear, and\nsuch theories face a dilemma if offered in hope of answering the Hard\nProblem. Either the proto-psychic properties involve the sort of\nqualitative phenomenal feel that generates the Hard Problem or they do\nnot. If they do, it is difficult to understand how they could possibly\noccur as ubiquitous properties of reality. How could an electron or a\nquark have any such experiential feel? However, if the proto-psychic\nproperties do not involve any such feel, it is not clear how they are\nany better able than physical properties to account for qualitative\nconsciousness in solving the Hard Problem.\n\nA more modest form of panpsychism has been advocated by the\nneuroscientist Giulio Tononi (2008) and endorsed by other\nneuroscientists including Christof Koch (2012). This version derives\nfrom Tononi's integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness\nthat identifies consciousness with integrated information which can\nexist in many degrees (see section 9.6 below). According to IIT, even\na simple indicator device such as a single photo diode possesses some\ndegree of integrated information and thus some limited degree of\nconsciousness, a consequence which both Tononi and Koch embrace as a\nform of panpsychism. \n\n\nA variety of arguments have been given in favor of dualist and other\nanti-physicalist theories of consciousness. Some are largelya\npriori in nature such as those that appeal to the supposed\nconceivability of zombies (Kirk 1970, Chalmers 1996) or versions of the\nknowledge argument (Jackson 1982, 1986) which aim to reach an\nanti-physicalist conclusion about the ontology of consciousness from\nthe apparent limits on our ability to fully understand the qualitative\naspects of conscious experience through third-person physical accounts\nof the brain processes. (See Jackson 1998, 2004 for a contrary view;\nsee also entries on\n zombies,\n and\n qualia: the knowledge argument.)\n Other arguments for dualism are made on more empirical grounds, such\nas those that appeal to supposed causal gaps in the chains of physical\ncausation in the brain (Eccles and Popper 1977) or those based on\nalleged anomalies in the temporal order of conscious awareness (Libet\n1982, 1985). Dualist arguments of both sorts have been much disputed\nby physicalists (P.S. Churchland 1981, Dennett and Kinsbourne\n1992).\n",
