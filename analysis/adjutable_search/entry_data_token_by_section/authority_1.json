In\nthis section, we will review a number of different ideas that have been\nunderstood to come under this idea of legitimate political\nauthority.\n\n\nIt is important here to note the distinction between theoretical and\npractical authority. A theoretical authority in some area of\nintellectual inquiry is one that is an expert in that area. Theoretical\nauthorities operate primarily by giving advice to the layman, which\nadvice the layman is free to take or not. The judgments of theoretical\nauthorities give people reasons for belief while the judgments of\npolitical authorities are normally thought to give people reasons for\naction. Theoretical authorities do not normally impose duties on\nothers, although they might give advice on what a person's duty is.\n\n\nMost theorists of political authority view it as a species of\npractical authority rather than theoretical authority, though this\nview is not held by all . Those who hold that political authority is a\nspecies of practical authority maintain that political authorities\nissue directives that give people reasons for action and not reason\nfor belief. The thought is that political authorities impose duties on\ntheir subjects and thereby give them reasons for action. These\ntheorists argue that it is the function of political authorities to\nget people to act in certain ways so as to solve various collective\naction problems such as a variety of different types of coordination\nproblems, assurance problems and free rider problems. There have been\nsome dissenting views on this of late. Some have argued that the\naccount of practical reason required by the idea that political\nauthority is a practical authority is incoherent and so they have\nopted for the idea that political authorities, when legitimate, are\ntheoretical authorities regarding the existence and nature of the\nduties and reasons for action that people have (Hurd 2001). Since this\nview is unusual this entry will concentrate on conceptions of\npolitical authority that treat it as a species of practical\nauthority.\n\n\nThe rest of this section will discuss a number of different analyses\nof political authority. There are three basic types of conceptual\naccount of legitimate political authority: legitimate political\nauthority as justified coercion, legitimate political authority as the\ncapacity to impose duties, and legitimate political authority as the\nright to rule. First, many people have understood legitimate political\nauthority as a political authority that is justified in coercing the\nsubjects of its authority. The notion of justification here is a moral\none. The thought is that a political authority might have moral\njustification in coercing those who come under its authority. This is\na particularly thin conception of legitimate authority. For instance,\na state can have this kind of authority when it legitimately occupies\na territory as a result of a just war. It is morally justified in\ncoercing the inhabitants of the occupied territory.\n\n\nThe moral justification of a group of people in coercing others may\nbe more or less systematic. For instance, a group of people may be\nmorally justified in engaging in just a few actions of coercing others.\nOr a group may be morally justified in engaging in coercion more\ngenerally as in the case of a morally justified military\noccupation.\n\n\nThis notion of authority need not involve duties on the part of the\npopulation that is being coerced. Indeed, they may be justified in\ntrying to escape coercion. This could be the case in a military\noccupation of a country that is justified on the grounds that it is\nnecessary to stop a third country from engaging in morally indefensible\naggression. This conception of morally justified coercion therefore\ninvolves no conception of a moral community among persons. In this\nfirst conception of authority as justified coercion, the authority may\nnot even issue commands let alone make laws. It may simply justifiably\nissue threats and offers. The difference between legitimate and\nillegitimate political authority on this account is that the actions of\nthe illegitimate political authority are not morally justified while\nthe coercive actions of the legitimate authority are justified.\n\n\nA second conceptual account of legitimate political authority\nimplies that those over whom authority is exercised have some kind of\nduty with regard to the authority. Or the authority has the moral power to\nimpose duties on the subjects. This duty can be merely a duty not to\ninterfere with the activities of the political authority. Or it can\ninvolve the more significant duty to obey the authority. This\nconception of authority involves the authority and the subjects in a\nweak kind of moral relationship. The authority is justified in issuing\nthe commands and attempting to force people to comply with the commands\nwhile the subjects have some kind of duty not to interfere with these\nactivities or comply with the commands.\n\n\nThe duty of the subjects need not be owed to the authority. It may\nmerely be that the subjects have a duty to obey where that duty is not\nowed to anyone in particular or where that duty is owed ultimately to\npeople who are not the authority. For instance, if one thinks that one\nis likely better to respect others' rights by complying with the\nauthority's directives, the action is ultimately owed to those\nothers.\n\n\nSome have stressed the idea that the holding of justified political\nauthority may only involve a duty on the part of others not to\ninterfere with the political authority and they argue that the duty of\nnon-interference is much weaker than a duty to obey (Morris 1998). It\nis not clear how great the difference between these two duties is in\npractice at least as far as citizens are concerned. For many cases of\nfailing to obey an authority are cases of interference with the\nauthority. An analogy may be helpful here. If one is playing a game of\nbaseball with an umpire and one refuses to comply with the directives\nof the umpire, one is in effect interfering with the umpire's carrying\nout of his duties by not complying with the directives of the\numpire.\n\n\nWhile a duty to obey seems to imply a duty not to interfere, there\nare cases of duties of non-interference that are not duties to obey,\nsuch as the duties of foreign powers not to interfere in the activities\nof a legitimate state. Furthermore, the duty to obey is clearly the\nmore contentious issue in the question of authority since it requires\nthat one make one's actions conform to the specific directives of the\nauthority.\n\n\nA third conceptual account of authority or set of conceptions of\nlegitimate authority involves the idea that the authority has a right\nto rule. Strictly speaking, an authority can have a right to rule\nwithout the subjects having a duty to comply. The authority may have a\n\u201cjustification\u201d right to rule (Ladenson 1980). This means\nthat the authority has a permission to issue commands and make rules\nand coerce others to comply and its possession of this right is\njustified on moral grounds. This \u201cjustification right\u201d is\nnot much more than the first notion we discussed above.\n\n\nA more robust right to rule includes a duty owed to the authority on\nthe part of the subjects not to interfere with the activities of the\nauthority. The subjects owe it to the authority not to interfere with\nit. This is connected with the right of the authority to rule. Finally,\nan authority can have a right to rule in the sense that it may issue\ncommands and make rules and require subjects to comply with these rules\nand commands and the subjects have duties, which they owe to the\nauthority, to comply with the rules and commands.\n\n\nThe distinction between a right to rule that is correlated with a\nduty not to interfere and one that is correlated with a duty to comply\ncomes in handy when we consider the difference between the duties owed\nto a legitimate political authority by the subjects of that authority\nand the duties owed to it by other states and persons who are not\nsubject to that authority. A state with a right to rule in the\nstrongest sense may be owed obedience by its subjects but it is usually\nowed only a duty of non-interference by those who are not a part of the\nstate such as other states and persons in other states. It is\nworthwhile drawing a distinction here between internal legitimacy and\nexternal legitimacy (Buchanan 2004).\n\n\nIt is not a useful aim of philosophers or political thinkers to\ndetermine which one of these conceptual accounts of political\nauthority is the right one. Each one of them grasps a kind of\nlegitimacy of political authority that is worth taking into account\nand distinguishing from the others. The idea of legitimate authority\nas justified coercive power is a suitable way of getting at the\nauthority of hostile but justified occupation powers. And the idea of\nlegitimate authority as an authority that has a right to rule over\nsubjects who owe obedience to the authority and that has a right not\nto be interfered with by foreigners is surely an importantly distinct\nand perhaps ideal type of authority, which is rarely implemented. The\nkind of legitimacy that is merely correlated with duties to obey or\nnot to interfere is a useful intermediate category between those\ntwo.\n\n\nWhat is worth noting is that the idea of legitimate authority as a\nright to rule in the strong sense described above does describe a kind\nof ideal of political community. The idea of legitimate authority as a\nright to rule to which citizens owe obedience gives each citizen a\nmoral duty to obey, which it owes to the authority. So this form of\nlegitimacy is grounded in a moral relationship between the parties that\ngoes beyond the fact that they are fellow human beings. The\nestablishment of a robust right to rule depends on the fact that each\ncitizen rightly takes as a reason for obedience that it has a moral\nduty owed to the authority. Since a legitimate political authority with\na right to rule is predicated on the fact that citizens have moral\nreasons grounded in the right to rule to obey it, the right to rule\nengages citizens at a deep moral level. The exercise of political power\nis founded in a moral relationship between moral persons that\nrecognizes and affirms the moral personality of each citizen.\n\n\nBy contrast, a society in which it is merely the case that\ncoercion is justified is one in which the subjects are permissibly\ntreated as means to morally defensible purposes. The subjects do not\nowe anything to the authority or have any duties to obey it. So, in the\ncase of an authority as merely justified coercion, the subjects'\nreasons for obedience are merely their desires to avoid punishment. And\nthat is the level at which the authority deals with them. Such a\nsociety does not engage the subjects as moral persons, it merely\nattempts to administer the activities of persons so as to bring about\nin a morally justified way a desirable outcome. At the extreme, a\nprisoner of war camp or even a hostile but justified military\noccupation gives the authorities justification for coercion. The people\nwho are subjected to that treatment often have no duties to obey and\nthey do not regard each other or the authorities as members of a\nunified political community. They are merely fellow human beings. To\nthe extent that a political society is best when it involves the mutual\nrecognition and affirmation of the moral status of each person, the\nkind of society that involves merely justified coercion of some by\nothers is a pale shadow.\n\n\nAnd the intermediate form of political authority is incomplete in\nthe respect in which the exercise of political power involves the\nmutual recognition and affirmation of the status of each person. It is\nthe case that subjects have duties but those duties are not essentially\nconnected to anything in the authority. The subjects instead act more\nin accordance with reasons that are independent of the authority when\nthey obey the authority. So to the extent that a society ruled by an\nauthority that has the right to rule is an ideal of a moral community,\nthe other types of authority are lesser forms of a morally ideal\npolitical community.\n",
