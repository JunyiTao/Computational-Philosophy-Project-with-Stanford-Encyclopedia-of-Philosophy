    "main_text": "The Welfare State\n6. The Welfare State\n\nNeoliberals support modest taxation, the redistribution of wealth, the\nprovision of public goods, and the implementation of social insurance,\nembracing a state somewhat more expansive than one where government\nprotects people from foreign powers and domestic criminals, produces\npublic goods, and provides limited services for the poor. For\ninstance, Hayek (Caldwell 2004: 291), Friedman (Butler 1985: 206), and\nBuchanan (1975: 35\u201352) favor government provision of public\ngoods because markets will under-produce public goods, and so\ngovernment should act even if it will sometimes fail (Butler 1985:\n206).\n\nOf course, neoliberals are skeptical of government regulation, largely\nbecause they think regulatory bodies tend to be turned from good\npurposes to bad ones (2007: 93). This is a consistent theme of\nFriedman\u2019s (1962a [2002: 137\u2013160]) work, especially in his\ncriticisms of occupational licensure. And the analysis of rent-seeking\nis one of Buchanan\u2019s main ideas, shared by his long-time\nco-author Gordon Tullock. Large bureaucracies turn too much power over\nto administrators, power that practically begs to be misused by\nspecial interests (Butler 1983: 209). And, of course, neoliberals all\noppose Keynesian fiscal policy, especially debt-financed stimulus\n(Buchanan 1987: 456; Butler 1985: 186). But these concerns are\nconsistent with embracing the welfare state.\n\nHayek is quite friendly to various government interventions. In\nThe Road to Serfdom, Hayek (1944 [2007]) defends\ncountercyclical monetary policy, government construction of\ntransportation infrastructure, social insurance for natural disasters,\ngovernment health insurance, a basic minimum income, and strict\nregulations with respect to working hours, health and safety on the\njob, poisons, deforestation, harmful agricultural methods, noise,\nsmoke, and the prices of goods and services that are natural\nmonopolies (1944 [2007: 22, 43\u20134, 133\u20135, 217]; Burgin\n2012: 90\u20131). Similarly, The Constitution of Liberty\nsays government should prevent of depressions and provide pensions,\nmedical care, and money for education in the form of vouchers (1960\n[2011: 264, 276, 286, 294, 379]). Hayek repeatedly stresses that\nthe\n\n\nold formulae of laissez faire or non-intervention do not provide us\nwith an adequate criterion for distinguishing between what is and what\nis not admissible in a free system. (1960 [2011: 231]; also see Hayek\n1944 [2007: 71]; 1973: 62; 1979: 41)\n\n\nHayek even supports a basic income:\n\n\n\u2026 the assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone\n\u2026 appears not only to be a wholly legitimate protection against\na risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in\nwhich the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of\nthe particular small groups into which he was born. (1979: 55)\n\n\nWhile Hayek\u2019s use of the term \u201clegitimate\u201d is\nimprecise and may only somewhat overlap with the use of the term in\ncontemporary political philosophy, he apparently thinks that\ngovernments are morally required to engage in welfare-state measures.\nGovernments should pursue poverty relief not only because it is\nbeneficial but because it is the right thing to do. Hayek worries that\nsocial safety nets can get out of control, but he supports them anyway\n(Caldwell 2004: 291).\n\nWhile Friedman is the most libertarian of the three (Burgin 2012:\n213), he never advocates abolishing the redistribution of wealth for\nsome purposes, claiming that government ought to \u201crelieve acute\nmisery and distress\u201d (Friedman 1951 [2012: 7]). Government\nshould\n\n\nprotect members of the community who cannot be regarded as\n\u201cresponsible\u201d individuals, principally children and the\ninsane. (Butler 1985: 206)\n\n\nAnd again,\n\n\nGovernment relief of poverty, the liberal will support and welcome,\nprimarily on the explicitly paternalistic ground of taking care of the\nirresponsible. (Friedman 1974b [2012: 23])\n\n\nOne of his most famous policy proposals is a negative income tax,\nwhere the poor would receive cash transfers if their incomes were low\nenough, financed by positive income taxes on the rich and middle class\n(Friedman 1962a [2002: 191\u20134]). Friedman (1960 [2002:\n191\u20132]) thought this policy was legitimate to reduce poverty\nbecause pure private charity may invite free-riding. He (1962a [2002:\n85\u2013107]) is also the inventor of the school-voucher policy, and\nhe (1974b [2012: 20]) supported compulsory education so long as\ngovernment does not control the\n schools.[9]\n Friedman worried that the welfare state would be too bureaucratic and\nauthoritarian, however, which is why he favored replacing most\nwelfare-state programs with cash transfers.\n\nTwo more points about Friedman on poverty relief. First, Friedman\nthinks that\n\n\n[t]here are no natural rules and definitions of property. There is\nultimately an essentially arbitrary element to where we draw the line.\n(1974a [2017: 86])\n\n\nThis is a point usually stressed by critics of libertarianism on the\nground that property rights are conventional, not natural, and so\ncannot morally prohibit redistribution (Murphy & Nagel 2002). This\npassage suggests that Friedman\u2019s political philosophy does not\ninclude a natural right of private property as an impediment to\nredistribution. Second, Friedman sees his defense of the welfare state\nas a part of his non-ideal theory, not his ideal. He supports vouchers\nand the negative income tax\n\n\nnot because these are necessarily part of my ideal utopia[n] society\nbut because they seem to me the most effective steps, given where we\nare, in moving toward where we want to go. (Burgin 2012: 175)\n\n\nIn fact, Friedman (1974a [2017: 79]) has sympathies with anarchism,\nthough he thinks it is not \u201ca feasible social structure\u201d.\nThis is consistent describing neoliberalism as a non-ideal theory.\nWhile in ideal theory, Friedman is a libertarian, or at least more\nlibertarian than most other neoliberals, his non-ideal theory is\nneoliberalism.\n\nBuchanan is both the hardest to pin down on the welfare state and the\nmost egalitarian. He has virtually nothing to say about government\npoverty relief. Buchanan\u2019s contractarianism nonetheless embraces\nsome redistribution, as he thinks his social contract would yield\nunanimous agreement on having a \u201cproductive\u201d\nstate, which provides many tax-financed goods, and could also provide\nsocial insurance (Buchanan 1975: 124). Buchanan also defends a\nprinciple of equal opportunity, which he thinks requires a 100 percent\ninheritance tax that would prevent the formation of an aristocracy.\nPresumably this principle could justify other forms of\nredistribution.\n\nNeoliberals stridently reject one of the most common rationales for\nthe welfare state, namely pursuing an egalitarian conception of social\njustice. Hayek is clearest on this point, given his total rejection of\nthe very idea of social justice, which he understands, somewhat\npeculiarly, as a set of moral principles that govern the\njustifiability of specific distributions of economic resources, though\nnot moral principles that govern the functioning of an economic system\nas a whole. Hayek (1978: 78) thinks that the idea of social justice is\nconfused in that justice cannot be applied to specific market outcomes\nbecause they are not the result of direct, conscious choices. Social\njustice is an incoherent idea, much like the idea of a \u201cmoral\nstone\u201d. Hayek thinks it imperative that the state not be used to\nachieve a precise income distribution (Caldwell 2004: 350):\n\n\nany policy aiming directly at a substantive ideal of distributive\njustice must lead to the destruction of the Rule of Law. (1944 [2007:\n79])\n\n\nYet Hayek has an idiosyncratic understanding of social justice. He\nthinks it requires the that certain specific economic outcomes be\nimposed, rather than that a society\u2019s moral, legal, and\npolitical rules work to the advantage of all. Hayek supports\nthe latter requirement. Hayek says that the \u201cmost desirable\norder of society\u201d is\n\n\none which we would choose if we knew that our initial position in it\nwould be decided purely by chance (such as the fact of our being born\ninto a particular family). (1978: 132)\n\n\nIf Hayek sounds like Rawls, it is no coincidence. Hayek\u2019s\nreading of Rawls\u2019s earlier papers (not A Theory of\nJustice) led him to believe he had no quarrel with Rawls, for\nRawls\n\n\nacknowledges that the task of selecting specific systems of\ndistributions of desired things as just must be abandoned. (1978:\n 100)[10]\n\n\nThus, Hayek seems to share Rawls\u2019s concept of social\njustice, though not his conception of it. And this concept of\nsocial justice is compatible with liberty. The pursuit of social\njustice only implies the destruction of the rule of law if our\nconception of social justice requires us to tinker with particular\neconomic outcomes (Hayek 1960 [2011: 85]). These points are by now\nwell-understood by Hayek\u2019s defenders (Tomasi 2012:\n142\u2013150).\n\nBuchanan and Friedman are less focused on rejecting social justice,\nbut their positions resemble Hayek\u2019s. Buchanan\u2019s\ncontractarianism leads him to hold that a society\u2019s\ndistributions are fair if they are the product of rules that all agree\nto, and otherwise not, so if pursuing distributive justice means\nbreaking the constitutional rules that we have agreed to, it is\nproblematic. But social contracts may have redistributive rules. If\npeople agree to redistributive rules, then redistribution is\njustified. In this way, Buchanan is closer to Rawls than Hayek is.\n\nFriedman has much less to say about social justice. He mostly stresses\nthat only some kinds of equality are desirable. Friedman (1980 [2017:\n144]) often says, for instance, that we should only seek equality of\nopportunity, not equality of outcome (Butler 1985: 218). But he also\nfeels the need to argue that markets do not have an inherent tendency\nto produce very unequal outcomes. Friedman (1955 [2017: 14]) says\nthat\n\n\nthe way to reduce inequality \u2026 is not by the misleading\npalliative of sharing the wealth but by improving the workings of the\nmarket, strengthening competition, and widening opportunities for\nindividuals to make the most of their own qualities.\n\n\nDifferences in economic power do not argue for a redistributive state\nbut for more capitalism:\n\n\nThe virtue of free enterprise capitalism is that it sets one\nbusinessman against another and is thus the most effective device for\ncontrol. (1974a [2017: 84])\n\n\nFree markets undermine monopoly economic power, whereas government\ngenerates it (Butler 1985: 210).\n",
