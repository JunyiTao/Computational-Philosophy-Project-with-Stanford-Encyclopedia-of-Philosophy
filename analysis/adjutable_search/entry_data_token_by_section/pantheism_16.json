Thus theism is\nnot itself a religion, although it lies at the core of many religions,\nand neither is pantheism itself a religion, although a core of\npantheistic belief has unquestionably grounded the religion of many\npeople.\n\nNo doubt many pantheists self-consciously and deliberately reject\ntheism, while many theists strongly reject pantheism. But to conclude\nfrom this that pantheism should be understood as essentially\nopposed to theism would seem precipitous (like concluding mutual\nincompatibility from the fact that many Christians oppose socialism\nand many socialists oppose Christianity). Without being drawn into\ndoctrinal questions well outside the purview of this essay, two points\nmay be made. Many philosophers who have put forward pantheist beliefs\nhave thought there was no need for anyone who accepted them to abandon\ntraditional religion (for example, Spinoza, Hegel, or Edward\nCaird\u2014who argues that \u201cthe religious consciousness is not\nthe consciousness of another object than that which is present in\nfinite experience and science, but simply a higher way of knowing the\nsame object,\u201d (1892, 464) but whom nonetheless considered\nhimself Christian.) From the other side, many committed theologians\nhave advanced positions with deeply pantheistic implications (e.g. the\n\u2018Christian Pantheism\u2019 of Teilhard de Chardin or the\n\u2018Ethical Pantheism\u2019 of Albert Schweitzer.)\n\nIt is sometimes objected that pantheism cannot really be religious on\nthe grounds that it can make no sense to direct at the cosmos\nthe religious attitudes and emotions\u2014worship, love,\ngratitude\u2014which are more normally directed towards a\nperson (Levine 1994, 315). (This is, of course, to assume that\nthe pantheistic God is not personal; a claim which, as we\nhave seen, many pantheists would reject.) Worship is commonly an\nexpression of dependence on a personal creator God, but, even if we\ndon\u2019t approve of their doing so, people worship many other\nthings, such as money, fashion, the State, or idols, without\nnecessarily assuming that these have residing within them some\nconscious spirit or other. Love is more usually felt towards people,\nbut Wordsworth described himself as a \u2018lover of nature\u2019\n(Tintern Abbey; see Hoque 2014), while Byron thought it\npossible to love his country but not his countrymen (Byron 1854, 25).\nWe typically thank a person, but it is possible also to feel gratitude\nwhich transcends any feeling to particular individuals to an\ninstitution (such as a college, community, or even State) which has\nnurtured you. In each case there remains room for doubt whether these\nattitudes are really equivalent to the sort of emotions more typically\nassociated with religion, but equally it is hard to see on what\nlegitimate grounds emotions might excluded from consideration as\n\u2018not properly religious.\u2019\n\nIn most religions prayer is not simply the expression of worship,\nlove, and gratitude, but an act in which we petition the deity for\nintercession. We can petition the theistic God, but can we petition\nthe universe itself? Most pantheists have thought not, but where the\ncosmos is conceived as personal, or at least moral, room may exist to\ndevelop such ideas. Construing the entire universe as a conscious\nbeing, Fechner argues that it makes perfect sense to petition it; the\nonly difference being that normal requests must be expressed since the\nobject to which they are directed lies outside of us, but in the case\nof God this is unnecessary since we exist already within him (Fechner\n1946, 242\u20136). Even if not personal, so long as it could be said\nthat the universe exhibits a moral narrative structure there is no\nreason to insist that that structure be independent of the moral needs\nor requests of creatures within it (Mander 2007).\n\nA common mark of religion is its soteriological character, its\nrecognition that the human condition is somehow unsatisfactory or\n\u2018fallen\u2019 and its offer to overcome this state through a\nprocess of human transformation, be the result of that renovation\nenduring happiness or some more elevated state of blessedness or\nnirvana. Can pantheism respond to this? Can it offer the\nbeliever hope for a better life?\n\nIf all that is hoped for is the well-being that comes from a more\nethical mode of existence, then pantheism is perfectly able to offer\nthis, supporting a value system which eschews selfishness in favour of\na wider concern. For example the American poet Robinson Jeffers\nsuggests that \u201cthere is peace, freedom, I might say a kind of\nsalvation, in turnings one\u2019s affections outwards towards this\none God, rather than inwards on one\u2019s self, or on\nhumanity\u201d (Jeffers 2009, 365) But some other pantheists have\nsought to offer something further. Pantheist systems with a\nteleological structure (such as those discussed in Section Four above)\nreadily lend themselves to soteriology on a grand scale; for example,\nwhile to Spinoza the highest state of human happiness consists in the\nintellectual love of God (a state not dissimilar to the Beatific\nVision), Hegel outlines a developmental scheme whose climax consists\nin the full and explicit self-manifestation of God.\n\nIn many traditional religions salvation has been linked to\nimmortality. Against this, it has been common among pantheists to\nargue that what is distinctive about pantheism is precisely its\ndisavowal of any hope for personal immortality. However, some have\nargued that a measure of endurance may be found in so far as we\nrecognize our real identity with, either the eternal universe (for\nexample, Schopenhauer 1851, 267\u201382) or, perhaps more\nspecifically with the ongoing life of our community (for example, John\nCaird 1880). A small number of pantheistic thinkers have attempted to\ndevelop more genuinely personal senses of immortality. For example,\nSpinoza controversially claims that \u201cThe human mind cannot be\nabsolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains which\nis eternal\u201d (Ethics e5p23). Josiah Royce, in his early\nAbsolute Idealist phase, attempted to argue that if our finite will,\nwhich in this life is never quite satisfied, is itself but a part of a\ngreater infinite will that is eternally satisfied, then that can only\nmean that we must find our share of that satisfaction \u201cin a life\nthat is not this present mortal life\u201d (Royce 1906, 147).\n",
