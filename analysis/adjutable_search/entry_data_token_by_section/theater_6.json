The\nobservation is that the pull of Boal\u2019s case is felt because the\ninteraction between spectators and performers can be explained as\nconsisting only of the ordinary uses of one\u2019s sensory apparatus.\nSecond, Boal\u2019s \u201cinvisible theatre\u201d prompts the\nnon-skeptical question, namely, how do spectators grasp and understand\nthe content of theatrical performances in either of the two\nclasses?\n\nA straightforward answer to the question is given in terms of the\nobservation, namely, \u201cby means of the senses\u201d. This answer\ninvokes an idea of human perception and attention that is\nnaturalistic, requiring us to appeal to nothing more than the basic\nfeatures of perception and attention that are studied empirically by\npsychologists and neuropsychologists. This leaves room for\nphilosophers of theater\u2014and other philosophers of art\u2014to\ndiscuss what the objects of attention and perception are in\ntheatrical performances and other forms of art. For example, one\nsuggestion that might be made with regard to theater and performances\nis that the objects attended to in them are the gestures, sounds, and\nspeeches presented by performers and the props, sets, and so on,\ndisplayed in the performance (Melinger and Levelt 2004; Novack and\nGoldin-Meadow 2017); and the mechanism by which this happens is\ndeliverable by standard empirical psychology (Rutherford and Kuhlmeier\n2013). Moreover, it will be useful to philosophers of art and\naesthetics to note that most perception is, as our colleagues in\nneuroscience and neuroaesthetics say, \u201ccross-modal\u201d,\ninvolving information delivered by more than one sense modality\n(Driver and Spence 2004; Kastner 2004; Nanay 2012; Seeley 2013). But,\nassuming this is on the right track, what does a spectator then\ndo with her perceptions of gestures, sounds, and speeches, in\norder to understand the content of the performance she has\nwitnessed?\n\nOne framework, or model, for understanding what is done when a\nspectator grasps or understands a performance might be supplied by\nusing signaling theory, much as that theory has been developed as a\nmodel for understanding social relations and social norms (Skyrms\n2010; Wagner 2015, and see the entry on\n social norms).\n The rough idea is that a sender, in this case a performer, signals a\ncontent to a receiver, the spectator, a content which the spectator\ncannot see at the moment (e.g., how the performance will go, what to\nexpect next, what kind of thing to expect). And then the receiver\nperforms some action\u2014and indeed that action can be as minimal as\ntheatrical spectators\u2019 actions often are\u2014which indicates\nto the performer whether or not they have understood the signal.\nPerhaps unlike standard signaling games, the relevant actions in this\ncase are reasoned to by the spectators from the data they are\ngiven in the performance. Accordingly, this enhanced model would\nrequire spectators to update their expectations upon being presented\nwith new signals, or new data (Perfors et al. 2011). And because the\nsame data can be used to increase one\u2019s credence in an\nexpectation and to help one determine the right category in\nwhich to place one\u2019s expectations, this model would also allow\nfor prior knowledge to play the kind of role in the understanding of a\nperformance that seems appropriate (Tenenbaum et al. 2011). It would\nallow for both \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop down\u201d\nguidance of perception and reception that comports well with a\npriori as well as empirical reasoning about theatrical and other\nkinds of perception and reception. This would include\nevent-segmentation in narrative understanding and scene gist\ndetection, as two fairly low-level examples (Zacks et al. 2007; Larson\nand Loschky 2009). It would also include such higher levels examples\nas recognition of styles and genres in performance (Walton 1970; Saltz\n2006; Liao and Protasi 2013).\n\nNone of the details in this view are settled, nor is there agreement\nthat it is even on the right track as a way to account for what it is\nthat spectators understand in watching a theatrical performance.\nJerrold Levinson has suggested an account for musical\nunderstanding and No\u00ebl Carroll has put forth another for\nunderstanding the movies created in the Hollywood system\n(Levinson 1997; Carroll 1986a, 2008). Yet no alternative to the\naccount just sketched has been set forth with respect precisely to\ntheatrical performances.\n\nLevinson\u2019s is a \u201cconcatenationist\u201d account of what\nit is to understand and enjoy music. In its boldest form, Levinson\nwrites, concatenationism is a conjunction of four propositions.\n\n\nMusical understanding centrally involves neither aural grasp of a\nlarge span of music as a whole, nor intellectual grasp of large-scale\nconnections between parts; understanding music is centrally a matter\nof apprehending individual bits of music and immediate progression\nfrom bit to bit.\nMusical enjoyment is had only in the successive parts of a piece\nof music, and not in the whole as such, or in relationships of parts\nwidely separated in time.\nMusical form is centrally a matter of cogency of succession,\nmoment to moment and part to part.\nMusical value rests wholly on the impressiveness of individual\nparts and the cogency of the successions between them, and not on\nfeatures of large-scale form per se; the worthwhileness of experience\nof music relates directly only to the former. (Levinson 1997:\n13\u201314)\n\n\n\nLevinson\u2019s account is developed and refined in considerable\ndetail over the course of his book. And there are two features of this\naccount that bear special mention here. One is the fact that each\nlistener must update her expectations about what is going to happen in\nthe music at each moment of listening. The other is that no\nlarge-scale musical structures are invoked in this story\u2014and in\nthis latter regard it is, perhaps, best described as a bottom-up\nonly tale of musical perception.\n\nCarroll\u2019s view is an \u201cerotetic\u201d (or\nquestion-and-answer) theory of movie comprehension. The shape of this\nview is as follows: the data a movie-goer encounters generate the\nquestions which the movie-goer consciously or unconsciously asks, the\nmovie-goer waits for new data that supplies answers to those\nquestions, and then the movie-goer updates and comprehends. What makes\nthe view distinctive\u2014and what has generated some controversy\nabout it\u2014is what the view depends on: the creation of so-called\n\u201cHollywood style\u201d film conventions. By means of those\nconventions the problem of attention focus is resolved. For the\nconventions themselves (for example, variable framing) are the very\ndevices in which specatorial attention is directed (Carroll 1985:\n188). This set of effects has resulted in what is rightly called the\n\u201ctyranny of movies\u201d with respect to visual attention\n(Loschky et al. 2015) and is clearly a top-down theory.\n\nHowever, the problem of focusing spectator attention looms large as a\nproblem in theatrical performances and is one of the crucial questions\nthat a theater company faces in developing a performance (Chaikin\n1972). The data are presented by the performance, but the data are\nwhatever the spectator experiences. They may be data about\nevents that are transpiring outside of and prior to the performance.\nThey may be about the kind of events transpiring in or\noutside of the performance. Rather than asking questions and waiting\nfor the performance to deliver data to supply answers to those\nquestions, spectators are engaged in updating their expectations from\nthe onset of the data. Crucial to this process is that a spectator\nmust determine where to focus her attention. Spectators enter a venue\nof presentation with at least some expectations already in place.\nSpectators who are experienced may have quite a few expectations about\nthe performance but, if they are not experienced theater-goers, they\nwill have very few of such expectations. What is needed is a model\nthat is consistent with at the least the first observation about the\n\u201cconcatenationist\u201d theory of musical comprehension that\nLevinson presented\u2014the need to update in the moment. It should\nalso be consistent with much of Carroll\u2019s \u201cerotetic\u201d\ntheory of the comprehension of Hollywood Style movies, but it needs to\nbe wider in its application than Carroll\u2019s view, which seems\ntailored to movies where the attention focal point is much easier to\nmanage than it is in the theater. And, it should offer an explanation\nof how a spectator determines the kind of performance with\nwhich she is confronted.\n",
