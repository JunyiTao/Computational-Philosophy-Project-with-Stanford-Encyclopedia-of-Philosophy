    "main_text": "The Late Period || John Wyclif\n4.2 John Wyclif\n\nPerhaps one of the genuinely new theories to emerge from this late\nperiod is that of John Wyclif, who wrote a Summary of\nInsolubles (Summa insolubilium),\n [31]\n probably in the early 1360s, and included another discussion of\ninsolubles in his Continuation of the Logic (Logicae\ncontinuatio), III.8. The theory is essentially the same in the\ntwo treatments.\n\nFor Wyclif, the key to resolving insolubles is to recognize various\nsenses in which propositions can be true or false. There are three\nmain senses of \u2018true\u2019, and accordingly of\n\u2018false\u2019:\n\nIn the transcendental sense, truth is convertible with being, so\nthat any proposition is true in this sense, no matter what it\nsignifies. This sense can be disregarded in discussing insolubles.\nNothing (that is, no being) is false in the sense that it fails to be\ntrue in this sense.\nIn a second sense, a proposition is true if and only if what it\n\u201cprimarily signifies\u201d exists. These \u201cprimary\nsignificates\u201d are neither substances nor accidents, but rather\n\u201cbeings of reason\u201d. It is perhaps plausible to interpret\nan existing primary significate as analogous to a \u201cfact\u201d\nin the modern philosophical sense. A proposition is false in this\nsecond sense if and only if its primary significate fails to\nexist.\nIn a third sense, a proposition is true if and only if what it\nprimarily signifies exists and is independent of the\nproposition itself. It is false in this third sense if and only if its\nprimary significate either fails to exist or else exists but depends\non the proposition itself.\n\n\nThe \u201cindependence\u201d required by the third kind of truth is\nan obscure and difficult matter. But here is how it applies to\ninsolubles:\n\nWhere a = \u2018a is false\u2019, its primary\nsignificate either exists or does not. If it does, then in any event\nit is not independent of a in the sense required by the third\nkind of truth. In either case, then, a will be false\nin the third sense. If the word \u2018false\u2019 in a is\ntaken in the second sense, therefore, a\u2019s primary\nsignificate does exist, since it is a fact that a is false in\nthe third sense. In short, the insoluble is true in the second sense,\nbut false in the third sense.\n\nOur present understanding of Wyclif\u2019s theory does not go much\nbeyond this. Many questions and problems remain. For instance, if the\nword \u2018false\u2019 in a is not taken in the third sense\nbut in the second, the paradox seems to emerge all over again\nin a form that cannot be handled by this theory.\n\nWhatever its virtues or defects, Wyclif\u2019s theory had some\ninfluence on later authors. Robert Alyngton\u2019s own\nInsolubilia, for instance, from around 1380, explicitly\nappeals to Wyclif\u2019s theory. Its influence can also be seen in\nPeter of Mantua\u2019s account (see\n Section 4.4\n below) and in an anonymous late treatise preserved in a Prague\nmanuscript (see Wyclif [W-SI]: xxiv\u2013xxv.)\n",
