    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning || The Theory-Ladenness of Observation\n3.4 Modularity\n\nAccording to the modular view of the mind (Fodor 1983), the basic systems involved\nin perception are encapsulated from information outside of it,\nexcluding its inputs (see Robbins 2015, for a summary of modularity).\nIt might then seem at first glance that cases of perceptual learning\nchallenge the view that the mind is modular, at least insofar as they\ninvolve the modulation of perception through any background theory\nthat the subject has. However, it is important to note that Fodor\nhimself seems to allow for such cases of perceptual learning. While he\nthinks that perception is synchronically impenetrable, he allows for\nthe possibility of diachronic penetration, that is, cases where\n\u201cexperience and training can affect the accessibility of\nbackground theory to perceptual mechanisms\u201d (1984: 39).\n\nWhy think that a modular view of the mind should allow for diachronic\npenetration? When Fodor allows for diachronic penetration, he does so\nbecause the alternative is to say that all modular systems are\nspecified endogenously (1984: 39). Fodor admits that this alternative\nwould be too extreme, and he points out, for instance, that children\nlearn something from hearing a language. In other words, the modules\nfor language are not just specified endogenously. However, Fodor is\nconservative about the scope of diachronic penetration, suggesting\nthat it may only happen within strict limits, perhaps limits that are\nthemselves endogenously defined (1984: 39\u201340).\n\nOther philosophers have argued that diachronic penetration of\nperception undermines modularity. Churchland (1988), for instance,\nsees Fodor\u2019s allowance of diachronic penetration as\n\u201cgrudgingly conceded,\u201d and he argues that diachronic\npenetration is in fact widespread, rather than something that happens\nwithin strict limits (p. 176). One such case, raised by Churchland, is\nthe case of perceiving music. Churchland argues that a person who\nknows the relevant music theory and vocabulary \u201cperceives, in\nany composition whether great or mundane, a structure, development,\nand rationale that is lost on the untrained ear\u201d (1988: 179).\nFodor replies that it is unclear whether such cases are genuinely\nperceptual (1988: 195). He suggests another possibility, which is that the\nperson who knows the relevant music theory does not perceive it\ndifferently, but rather forms different beliefs about the music.\nFurthermore, even if the case is genuinely perceptual, Fodor replies\nthat it could be that a trained ear results simply from repeated\nexposure to the relevant music, rather than through knowledge of\ntheory (1988: 195).\n",
