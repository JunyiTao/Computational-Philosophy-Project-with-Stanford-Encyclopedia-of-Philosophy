    "main_text": "From Bivalent to Triadic Logic || Truth table of a three-valued system\n3.2 Why the third value?\n\nIn Peirce\u2019s own words:\n\n\nTriadic Logic is that logic, which though not rejecting entirely the\nPrinciple of Excluded Middle, nevertheless recognizes that every\nproposition, S is P, is either true or false, or else\nhas a lower mode of being such that it can neither be determinately\nP, nor determinately not-P, but is at the limit between\nP and not P. (Ms 339, copied from Fisch & Turquette\n1966: 75)\n\n\nWhen do we have value L (indeterminate) for the proposition\n\u201cS is P\u201d? Sometimes S, Peirce says,\nhas a lower mode of being P and is at the limit between\nP and not P. The crux of the matter is how to interpret\nthe two phrases\u2014\u201clower mode of being P\u201d and\n\u201cbeing at the limit between P and not P\u201d.\nExisting literature offers two different explanations\u2014modality\nversus continuity.\n\nFisch and Turquette, upon the discovery of Peirce\u2019s notes on\ntriadic logic, locate the root of indeterminacy in potentiality. That\nis, indeterminacy is the semantic value assigned to an unrealized\nsituation; hence, we can say neither \u201cS is\nP\u201d nor \u201cS is not P\u201d at this\npoint. Potentiality, according to this view, cannot be captured by\ndyadic logic. If so, Peirce\u2019s triadic logic is directly related\nto modality talk, which Fisch and Turquette conclude:\n\n\nEssentially, Peirce seems to be saying that triadic logic may be\ninterpreted as a modal logic which is designed to deal with the\nindeterminacies resulting from that mode of being which Peirce has\ncalled \u201cPotentiality\u201d and \u201cReal Possibility\u201d.\nUnder such an interpretation, dyadic logic becomes a limiting case of\ntriadic modal logic resulting from removing indeterminacy and being\ndetermined entirely by \u201cActuality\u201d. (Fisch & Turquette\n1966: 79)\n\n\nAccording to the modality interpretation, Peirce\u2019s \u201clower\nmode of being P\u201d means P not being actual, and\nPeirce\u2019s third value L, being potential, is \u201cat the\nlimit between P (i.e., T) and not P (i.e.,\nF)\u201d. Later in the paper, suggesting a possible relation\nbetween Peirce\u2019s triadic logic and MacColl\u2019s implication\n(as opposed to material implication), the authors make an interesting\nremark: \n\n\nConsidering MacColl\u2019s rejection of Russell\u2019s material\nimplication, it is interesting to notice also that MacColl\u2019s\n\u201cDef. 13\u201d gives what is now called \u201cC. I.\nLewis\u2019s strict implication\u201d. (Fisch & Turquette 1966:\n83) \n\n\nEven though the connection was not pursued further in their paper, one\ncannot help realizing that their modality interpretation is boosted by\na relation to MacColl\u2019s implication since C. I. Lewis\u2019\nstrict implication is a beginning of modal logic. However, equating\nPeirce\u2019s triadic logic with modal logic, the modality view needs\nto explain the relation between Peirce\u2019s Gamma graph lecture in\n1903c (which is about\nmodality) and the triadic logic notes written in 1909 ([Ms 339] 340v, 341v, 344r).  Modal logic explored in Gamma\ngraphs is the extension of classical logic, which required new\nvocabulary, e.g., broken cuts and tincture. Modal logic does not have\nto be non-standard. On the other hand, triadic logic does not add any\nvocabulary, but brings in different interpretations, and becomes\nnon-standard logic. On a slightly different note, Fisch and\nTurquette\u2019s suggests Peirce\u2019s tychism (the view that\nindeterminacy is part of the reality) as a motivation for\nPeirce\u2019s invention of triadic logic. If so, Peirce\u2019s\ntriadic logic is a reflection of his own metaphysics.\n\nChallenging the modality view, Robert Lane proposes the continuity\ninterpretation for Peirce\u2019s triadic logic. According to Lane,\nPeirce\u2019s indeterminate value L has nothing to do with\nmodality, hence, Peirce\u2019s development of triadic logic is not\nanother mechanism for modal logic, but with Peirce\u2019s\nsynechism\u2014the doctrine \u201cthat all that exists is\ncontinuous\u201d (c. 1897b [CP 1.172])! How does Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophy of continuity justify the third value?\n\nFirst, Lane makes a distinction between the principle of excluded\nmiddle (PEM, henceforth) being false with regard to a\nproposition and PEM not being applied to a proposition. If\nPEM is true or false, it means the principle is applied to it. And,\nLane claims that PEM is applied to only non-general and non-modal\npropositions, citing the following passages from Peirce:\n\n\nanything is general in so far as the principle of excluded\nmiddle does not apply to it and is vague in so far as the\nprinciple of contradiction does not apply to it. (1905: 488 [CP\n5.448])\n\nan assertion is said to be made in \u201cthe mode of necessity\u201d\nif, and only if, the affirmation and the denial that [sic] which is so\nasserted could conceivably be both alike false. Thus if a\nperson says \u201cIt will certainly rain tomorrow\u201d, it\nmay be alike false that it is certain to rain and that it is certain\nnot to rain. (1910b: 26\u201328, Ms 678)\n\n\nIf a proposition is either general or expresses necessity, PEM is not\nfalse, but is not applied. Hence, focusing on individual and non-modal\npropositions, Lane draws our attention to a special nature of a\npredicate in L-propositions. Lane calls the kind of the\nproperty which results in L-propositions a\n\u201cboundary-property\u201d. Here is Peirce\u2019s own example of\na boundary-property:\n\n\nThus, a blot is made on the sheet. Then every point of the sheet is\nunblackened or blackened. But there are points on the boundary line,\nand those points are insusceptible of being unblackened or of being\nblackened, since these predicates refer to the area about S and a line\nhas no area about any point of it. (Ms 339: 344r, quoted in Lane 1999:\n294)\n\n\nThose points on the boundary line are neither black nor non-black.\nConsider the propositions \u201cPoint O is black\u201d and\n\u201cPoint O is not black\u201d (where point O is on\nthe boundary line of a black blot). Neither of them is true, but\nfalse, either. These are prime examples of Peirce\u2019s\nL-proposition. Using Peirce\u2019s own truth-tables in the\nprevious subsection, let\u2019s compute the truth value of\n\u201cPoint O is black or point O is not\nblack\u201d.\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be the value of \u201cPoint O is black\u201d,\nwhich is L.\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(\\bar{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(\\Theta(\\alpha, \\bar{\\alpha})\\)  \n\n\nL\nL\nL  \n\n\nNote that PEM is applied, but not true, period.\n\nLane\u2019s following conclusion would be welcomed by many Peirce\nscholars:\n\n\n[B]oundary-propositions were important to Peirce because continuity\nwas important to him;\u2026this [the thought that an actual\nbreach of continuity possesses neither of the properties that are the\nboundary properties relative to that breach] led him to think that\nboundary-propositions are neither true nor false. To accommodate such\npropositions, and thus the phenomenon of continuity, within the bounds\nof formal reasoning, was, I contend, the motivation behind\nPeirce\u2019s experiments in triadic logic. (Lane 1999: 304)\n\n\nRegardless of endorsement of the continuity talk, some might not\nwelcome metaphysics getting into logic. Moreover, if Peirce\u2019s\nsynechism is not embraced, Peirce\u2019s triadic logic, which Lane\nargues is an attempt to formalize the continuity phenomenon, might\nlose its force.\n\nThe previous two sections showed that Peirce\u2019s relational logic\nand graphical systems push us further both in what we do with logic\nand how we do logic so that we may formalize more and we may formalize\nin more diverse ways. Triadic logic, as explained at the beginning of\nthis section, is neither just a monotonic extension to get further nor\nan alternative to get to the same place. By extending semantic\nentities, we have a different logic, for example, PEM being not true.\nThat is why we call triadic logic a non-standard logic. However,\nPeirce\u2019s way of introducing the third value gives us some pause.\nFirst of all, unlike with contemporary triadic logic, Peirce does not\ndiscard PEM completely:\n\n\nTriadic Logic\u2026not rejecting entirely the Principle of Excluded\nMiddle,\u2026 (Ms 339: 344r, copied from Fisch & Turquette 1966:\n75)\n\nI do not say that the Principle of Excluded Middle is downright\nfalse; (1909: 21\u201322 [NEM 3/2: 851], quoted in Fisch\n& Turquette 1966: 81)\n\n\nFor certain (not all) properties, because of the way things are, we\nfind ourselves caught at limits between clearly P and clearly\nnon-P. If we want to formalize those cases as well, the third\nvalue, L, is needed to express the indeterminacy of boundary\ncases. Hence, Peirce himself does not think triadic logic is a new\nlogic, but an addition or extension of the existing dyadic logic:\n\n\nThe recognition [that there is an intermediate ground between\npositive assertion and positive negation which is\njust as Real as they are] does not involve any denial of existing\nlogic, but it involves a great addition to it. (1909: 21\u201322 [NEM\n3/2: 851], quoted in Fisch & Turquette 1966: 81)\n\n\nIf we accept Peirce\u2019s suggestion literally, his triadic logic is\nnot a typical form of non-standard logic but Peirce\u2019s another\nway to extend the territory of logic, along with his relational\nlogic.\n",
