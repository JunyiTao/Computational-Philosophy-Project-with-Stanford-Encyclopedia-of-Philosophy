    "main_text": "Philosophy of psychology, education, and the social sciences || Philosophy of psychology\n5.1 Philosophy of psychology\n\nVienna became an international capital of psychological research while\nlogical empiricism started to develop a scientific epistemology and an\nepistemology of science with normative demarcation goals.\nFreud\u2019s psychoanalysis was more popular than J.B. Watson\u2019s\nAmerican behaviorism and Gestalt psychology was dominant neither in\npsychology nor scientific philosophy. The members of the Vienna Circle\ncollectively adopted its framework of scientism and anti-metaphysics,\nof logic and empiricism, and aimed to select their intellectual allies\nand targets accordingly. Yet, individually, they tailored their\nconsiderations of the different sciences to their respective agendas,\nshifting projects and development. In the Vienna Circle manifesto, the\nofficial programmatic position was to point to the defects of much\ncontemporary psychological language, plagued by metaphysical burden,\nconceptual imprecision and logical inconsistency. The emphasis on\nperception selected behaviorist psychology as intellectual ally\nconsistent with the Circle\u2019s scientific world-conception\n(Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929/1973, 314-5, Hardcastle 2007).\n\nHans Reichenbach, Carnap and Schlick\u2019s ally in Berlin, was the\nleader of the Berlin Society for Scientific Philosophy, also known as\nthe Berlin Circle, and hence was in personal and intellectual\ninteraction with Wolfgang K\u00f6hler in Berlin. Eventually he would\nmention Gestalt theory in his writings in 1931, in \u2018Aims of\nModern Philosophy of Nature\u2019. There he raised the question of\nthe philosophical problems of psychology and focused on Gestalt theory\nas \u2018a recent development\u2019 that \u2018subsumes\npsychological events under the concept of Gestalt (\u2026) an\norganized arrangement of experiences\u2019 (Reichenbach 1931/1959,\n88).\n\nLike Kant, Popper was interested in a transcendental and regulative\nphilosophy, and, more so than Kant, he hailed science as the paradigm\nof intellectual activity. But by 1928 he was still holding a\ncommitment to inductivism. In 1928 Popper finished his doctoral\ndissertation, \u2018On the Methodological Problem of Cognitive\nPsychology\u2019. There, Popper set out to understand the relations\nbetween logic, biology and psychology in the production of knowledge\nand, to that effect, to outline the methodological preconditions of\ncognitive psychology. Two alternative views of psychology were\navailable to Popper through his two doctoral examiners, Karl\nB\u00fchler and Moritz Schlick.\n\nSchlick represented Gestalt theory as psychology within the reductive\nframework of physicalism, that is, rejecting the existence of\nautonomous entities, laws and methods of psychology.\nB\u00fchler\u2019s career was central to Austrian psychology and to\nRed Vienna culture. After an assistantship with Stumpf in his\nBerlin\u2019s laboratory, B\u00fchler had emerged, along with Otto\nSelz and Max Wertheimer, from the research laboratory of Ostwald\nK\u00fclpe in W\u00fcrtzburg. With K\u00fclpe he had engaged in\nempirical research on thought processes\u2014contra Wundt\u2019s\natomistic psychology-, with special attention to imageless thought and\nthe importance of language. He subsequently moved with K\u00fclpe to\nBonn and eventually replaced him in Munich in 1915. In 1912\nB\u00fchler had originally contributed to Gestalt psychology with the\ndiscussion of simple Gestalt forms involved in the perception of\nproportions of geometrical figures and ended concentrating on his\ncognitive phenomenon of the \u2018aha experience\u2019, a sudden\ninsight in problem solving. Interested in the same phenomenon,\nCharlotte Malachowski was encouraged by Stumpf to join B\u00fchler in\nMunich, where she became his wife. They collaborated on a project to\nstudy the mental development of children, ending with intelligent\nlearning through language. The results appeared in his The Mental\nDevelopment of the Child (1918), which immediately became the\nstandard reference on the subject.\n\nIn Vienna, Otto Gl\u00f6ckel, founder of the world-renowned Vienna\nSchool Reform movement and president of the Vienna School Board,\noffered to fund for the B\u00fchlers a psychological laboratory. After\nKarl B\u00fchler had lost to K\u00f6hler the appointment to the Berlin\nposts, he ended up assuming in 1923 the directorship of the newly\nfunded Psychological Institute of Vienna. From the Institute the\nB\u00fchlers became central to Red Vienna culture. They taught at the\nPedagogical Academy of Vienna. In addition, she focused on children\neducation and psychological welfare. His interest in language and\nphilosophy brought him closer to Schlick (Wittgenstein\u2019s sister\nMargaret organized social occasions for Wittgenstein, the B\u00fchlers\nand the Schlicks to meet) and he encouraged his students to attend\nVienna Circle seminars (Egon Brunswick, Elsa Frankel, Marie Jahoda,\nPaul Lazersfeld, Rudolf Ekstein and Edith Weisskopf). Then in 1927 he\npublished Die Krise der Psychologie (The Crisis of\nPsychology). In the book, B\u00fchler argued that the problem of\nexplaining the social significance of language showed that psychology\nhas lost the complexity and richness required to synthesize three\nlevels of psychology: experience, behavior and intellectual structure\n(B\u00fchler 1927, Hacohen 2000 and Humphrey 1951). A framework was\nneeded for unifying the different narrow \u2018schools\u2019 of\npsychology: Behaviorism, Gestalt theory, psychoanalysis,\nassociationism, and humanistic psychology. They were deficient in\ntheir narrow domain of application. The unity of psychology demanded\nmethodological pluralism at the point of cooperation.\n\nAround this time, Popper\u2019s interest in the scientific character\nof psychology was still bound to the notion that induction is the\nempirical method of the natural sciences (ter Hark 2002, and Gattei\n2004, 453). He developed his interest in psychology in his second\nthesis, on the method of cognitive psychology, of 1928 (the first was\non the inductive basis of pedagogy). Popper argued against\nSchlick\u2019s views rejecting the reciprocal interaction between\nbody and mind: physicalism was impractical and psychophysical\nparallelism empirically unverifiable. The choice between\nSchlick\u2019s physicalism and B\u00fchler\u2019s pluralism was not\nlogically decidable. Psychology was better off autonomous, discovering\nempirically new laws and phenomena that only subsequently might or\nmight not prove reducible to material interpretation. Moreover, he was\nprimarily concerned with his own epistemological project, descriptive\nand regulative, regarding the production of scientific knowledge.\nPopper reasoned by analogy with B\u00fchler\u2019s problem regarding\nlanguage: Gestalt psychology was too narrow to establish the\nconditions of possibility of cognitive psychology and the logic of\nintellectual structures. He was further interested in the Viennese\nOtto Selz\u2019s holistic and functional notion of \u2018total\ntask\u2019, based on a psychological mechanism of trial and error\n(this notion would inspire not only Popper\u2019s pedagogy, but\nelements of his scientific methodology of hypotheses and\nfalsification, conjectures and refutations). His heart and mind were\nset against the sufficiency of Gestalt psychology.\n\nIn the Aufbau Carnap associated Watson\u2019s behaviorism\nwith a physicalist basis for a construction system, whereas Gestalt\npsychology was better suited to provide an empirical basis for the\nepistemological system (which was to reflect the origin of the\nconcepts in our system of knowledge) (Carnap 1928). Carnap was\nconcerned, in a neo-Kantian fashion, with the question of the\nconstitution of the world; and he tried to combine the strengths of\nempiricist and Kantian epistemologies in a system that was\nmetaphysically neutral. One of the many possible logical constructions\n\u2014borrowing Russell\u2019s terminology\u2014or constitution\nsystems of knowledge was to accommodate the epistemic value of\nindividual experience while preserving the objective form of\nscientific knowledge (Friedman 1999). It is there that in order to\nrepresent experience scientifically, he chose, following Schlick,\nGestalt theory. Experience contributed a complex holistic\nstream\u2014a \u2018true\u2019, \u2018organic\u2019\nwhole\u2014out of which the elementary empirical concepts must be\nabstracted, by the process he called quasi-analysis. Unlike for\nStumpf, but like for Wertheimer and K\u00f6hler, for Carnap elementary\nsensations were only abstractions\u2014he wrote of quasi-analysis\nthrough classes of recollected experiences\u2014from experiential\nGestalts. In the book he explicitly referred to K\u00f6hler\u2019s\narticle \u2018Gestaltprobleme und Anf\u00e4nge einer Gestalttheorie,\n\u00dcbersichtsreferat\u2019 (1925) and Wertheimer\u2019s survey\nUeber Gestalttheorie (1925) (Carnap (1928), sects. 62 and\n109; besides Husserl\u2019s, the influence of Meinong\u2019s\nGestalt-based philosophy deserves careful exploration).\n\nLike Wittgenstein and Popper, both prior to but especially during the\nRed Vienna period, Neurath was interested in education and cognitive\npsychology (like Popper, also in connection with socialist political\nand social goals). He quickly gained notoriety with his visual method\nof communication, known as ISOTYPE or Vienna Method. Neurath\u2019s\ncrusade for unified science against speculative metaphysics and the\nconnected challenge of understanding the social and objective nature\nof scientific knowledge drove him in 1931 to adopt physicalism as the\nchief constraint on scientific concepts and theories. Physicalism, in\na sense broader than Carnap and Schlick\u2019s doctrine of the same\nterm, was the materialist view that science speaks only of observable\nevents, things and processes in space and time. This view set a\n(normative) bridge intended to unify the truly scientific natural and\nthe social sciences, yet it did not require any reduction to physics.\nRadical empiricism, by contrast, would only impose the primacy of the\nsubjective, the source of contentiousness, dogmatism and\narbitrariness, which he abhorred in speculative metaphysical\ndoctrines. Neurath rejected, along these lines, the language of the\nunconscious and the ego, subjective mental states devoid of material\n-physiological-, perceptual or operational correlates. \n\nThe metaphysical or semantic policing of psychological vocabulary took\nplace at two levels: as a science integrated within the unity of the\nsciences according to principles of physicalism, and as part of the\nscientific representation of relevant perception in the form of\nprotocol sentences. As a matter of psychology of perception and\nlanguage, all events and processes, all perceptual, speech and thought\nterms involved in the production of empirical data were to be taken\nphysicalistically, e.g., as descriptions of spatio-temporal structures\ninvolving behavior or bodily\u2014anatomical and physiological-\nchanges under given observed conditions (Neurath 1931/1983, 55).\n\nFrom the point of view of Neurath\u2019s physicalism or enlightened\nempiricism, the goal was to achieve a unity of empirical formulations\nin psychology. The only acceptable psychological positions were the\nkinds of behaviorism championed by J.B. Watson, E.C. Tolman, and F.B.\nSkinner and physiological theories (Neurath 1931a/1983, 50;\n1931b/1983, 55; 1932a/1983, 63, 67, and 73). Yet he also drew some\ndistance between physicalism and behaviorism by declaring the latter\nboth too narrow and too broad, and containing non-physicalist notions\n(Neurath 1936/1983, 164). He came to distinguish behaviorism, in this\nnarrow sense, from \u2018behavioristics\u2019, the emphasis on\nperceptual considerations of behavior within the framework of\nphysicalism (Neurath 1933/1987, 13). Neurath mentioned Gestalt theory\nas one of the schools of psychology alongside behaviorism and\npsychoanalysis disrupting the unity of psychology as a discipline\n(implicitly echoing B\u00fchler\u2019s earlier lamentations; Neurath\n1937/1983, 172\u20133, and 1933/1987, 15), but he did not mention\nGestalt as an example of scientific psychology (a few statements on\nthis point in Cat 2005 are regrettably mistaken or else misleading).\nHe merely pointed to the promise of its empirical contributions to\nscientific behaviorism with a rejection of its talk of holistic\nproperties as metaphysical danglers (Neurath 1933/1987, 17\u20138).\n\n",
