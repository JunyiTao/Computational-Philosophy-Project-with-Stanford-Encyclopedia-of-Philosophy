    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || The Cultural Construction of Race\n3.4 The Cultural Construction of Race\n\nHow should we understand the connection between racialized\nidentities and the production of cultures? \u201cCivilizations and\npeoples are not\u2026coterminous with races,\u201d as Leonard Harris\nreminds us (Harris 1999, 445). Yet there are links. For Alain Locke, as\nHarris explains, socially created races can be defined in relation to\n\u201cbeliefs, habits, customs, and informal institutional\nregulations,\u201d but these are the products of group agency rather\nthan innate: it is civilizations and peoples that decide what traits to\nencourage given particular historical circumstances (Harris 1999,\n444\u20135). While it is a mistake to see races as causes of\ncultural formations, it is also a mistake to assume that racialized\ngroup histories play no role in the \u201cbeliefs, habits,\ncustoms\u201d that play a role in surviving adversity, or, on the\nother hand, in conquering.\n\nPerhaps the most philosophically rich discussion and debate over\nrace and culture came out of the anti-colonial movement that put\nforward the concept of Negritude in the midst of anti-colonial\nstruggles in Africa and the French Caribbean. Negritude was the name\ngiven for the concept of \u201cblack culture.\u201d For some\ntheorists, such as L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dor Senghor, biologically\ncaused racial identities have cultural products that, because of their\nbiological origin, have limited transformational potential. But for\nother theorists, the production of black culture is essentially to be\nunderstood within the history of colonialism (Mosley 1999, 75).\n\nFor both Aim\u00e9 and Suzanne C\u00e9saire, Negritude was the\ncultural fruit of the historical process of intellectual\ncross-fertilization known as m\u00e9tissage. Within this\ndynamic history, new cultural forms developed that could offer\nintellectual nourishment to the developing social movements striving\nfor self-determination (Denean Sharpley-Whiting 2003, 117). \u201cFor\nus, the problem is not to make a utopian and sterile attempt to repeat\nthe past, but to go beyond\u2026It is a new society that we must\ncreate, with the help of all our brother slaves, a society rich with\nall the productive power of modern times, with all the fraternity of\nolden days\u201d (C\u00e9saire 1955 [1972, 31]). Thus, Negritude articulated\na new set of norms and values that aimed to depart from Europe\u2019s\nbarbarism. Rejecting colonialism involved turning toward rather than\naway from the historical tie to indigenous African cultures. This would\nprove to be a productive relation, since these cultures were neither\nmodern nor liberal by Europe\u2019s lights but communal, cooperative,\nand anti-capitalist, with their own forms of democracy (C\u00e9saire\n1955 [1972, 23]). Decolonization required not simply nation-building but a\nreassessment and realignment of cultural forms and related social ideas\nabout human possibilities (Getachew 2019). Negritude was the name given\nto this endeavor.\n\n To be sure, Negritude has sustained decades of critical debate\nconcerning the dangers of cultural homogenization (Sealey 2018; \nAppiah 1992; \nWilder 2015; Mosley 1999). Another line of debate concerned the\nchampioning of emotion, intuition and myth in indigenous cultures, and\nwhether this only played into the hands of white supremacists. Senghor\nresponded that the point is to redefine the sphere of emotion and the\nimportance of myth as a feature of every society. Du Bois (1903 [1997]) also\nexpressed and affirmed the idea of a specific form of spirituality,\ninspired in part by Hegel. Eventually these ideas would find resonance\nin the idea of \u201csoul\u201d as the cultural form of a people,\nanother conception with an indelible racial connotation.\n\nNegritude was motivated by the project Aime C\u00e9saire called\n\u201cdisalienation\u201d: to overcome the denigration of Africa and\nthe forced assimilation into the culture of the colonizer\n(T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 1999). Yet to be clear, disalienation for\nC\u00e9saire did not require a denial of m\u00e9tissage.\nHis own writings were influenced by the French poetry and literature he\nhad imbibed as a student, but C\u00e9saire insisted that his project\nwas to \u201ccreate a new language, one capable of communicating the\nAfrican heritage\u201d (C\u00e9saire 1955 [1972, 67]). In the colonial\ncontext of Martinique, the use of French did not need to stop but what\nwas most important was to develop \u201ca new means of\nexpression\u201d that would be \u201cAntillean French, a black French\nthat, while still being French, had a black character\u201d (ibid.).\nNegritude aimed to allow the expression of a full range of memory,\naffect, orientation, and sensibilities across the domain of many\ndiverse ethnic, religious, and language communities from which the\nslaves were kidnapped.\n\nThe emphasis on the historical construction of cultural differences\nand social identities led to diverse conclusions by different\ntheorists. Sartre came to defend the concept of Negritude against its\ndetractors, but his defense portrayed it as a transitional stage in a\nHegelian dialectical moment that would lead to a future without racial\ndifferences. (Sartre 1948 [1988]; Bernasconi 1995, 2006) Such a future may be\none that many anti-racists, people of color among them, aspire to\n(Williams 1997). But the problem, as Fanon put it, was that Sartre was\nwielding a universal historical teleology in which sacrifices of\ncollective identification and historical memory were disproportionately\ndistributed (Fanon 1959 [1967]). It is the Black man who must \u201crenounce\nthe pride of his color\u2026[accept] the twilight of his\nnegritude\u2026in order to find the dawn of the universal\u201d\n(Sartre 1948 [1988, 329]). This formulation maintained the conception of\nuniversal humanism held by the French colonizers. Fanon rejected the\nidea that negritude was simply a stage, and retorted that \u201cIt is\nthe white man who creates the Negro. But it is the Negro who creates\nnegritude\u201d (Fanon 1959 [1967, 47]).\n\nEdouard Glissant took the concept of metissage and applied\nit to the way in which we approach historical understanding to argue\nthat the danger with historical approaches lies with the assumption of\na singular history that unifies us all (Sealey 2020). \u201cOne of the\nmost disturbing consequences of colonization could well be this notion\nof a single History\u2026The struggle against a single History for\nthe cross-fertilization of histories means repossessing both a true\nsense of one\u2019s time and identity\u2026\u201d (Glissant 1989,\n93).\n\nAs Kris Sealey argues, homogenized teleologies such as Sartre\npresumes puts a stranglehold on the political imagination. Yet Fanon\nand Amilcar Cabral both worried that in some forms Negritude itself\ndownplayed dynamism, internal conflicts, and the heterogeneity of the\ndiasporic experience. Both suggested that the imaginary projections of\nhomogeneous cultural identities based on shared racialization were the\nproduct of alienated middle classes seeking an authenticity they had\nlost. While recognizing that the group specificity of cultural\nformations and ideas remained vital, they, together with Kwame Nkrumah,\nheld that we need to retain a capacity to develop historically informed\ncritiques of anti-racist philosophies (Nkrumah 1964; Cabral 1973).\n",
