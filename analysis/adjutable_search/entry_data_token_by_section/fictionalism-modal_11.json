    "main_text": "Other Concerns || Incompleteness\n4.2 Incompleteness\n\nFictions are often incomplete: they are silent about some issues. The\nSherlock Holmes stories make no representation one way or the other\nabout the exact population of India, or whether the number of hairs on\nDr Watson\u2019s head is odd or even. Arguably, the modal fiction\nwill be incomplete too: there will be some propositions such that\nneither they nor their negations will be true according to the\nfiction. This prospect raises several worries.\n\nFirst, there is the \u201cincompleteness problem\u201d discussed by\nRosen in Rosen 1990, pp. 341\u2013345. There are some modal issues\n(and corresponding issues about the nature of possible worlds) that a\nrealist may well be silent on: not because they believe there is no\nanswer, but rather because they believe themselves ignorant of the\nanswer. A fictionalist who treats the realist\u2019s theory as a\nfiction, on the other hand, will be silent upon the same issues\n\u2014 but this can lead to a more serious problem. If the fiction is\nsilent on an issue (Rosen\u2019s example concerns the size of\nworlds), it is not that the issue is unknown \u2014 it is that the\nfiction does not represent a fact of the matter one way or the other.\nSo it might appear for the fictionalist there is not an unknown modal\nfact \u2014 either the claim is false because the corresponding\nworlds-claim is not true according to the fiction, or something\ninvolving a truth-value gap is going on. Rosen also discusses what\neffect this might have on modal claims corresponding to such silences.\nA detailed discussion and critique of Rosen on this issue can be found\nin the following supplementary document:\n\n [Rosen\u2019s Incompleteness Worry]\n \n\nWhat is uncontentious is that modal fictionalists operating with\nfictions which are incomplete in the way, e.g., that the fiction of\nRosen 1990 is, will face difficulties, or at least departures from\northodoxy which will be found unattractive by some. Woodward 2012\noffers an approach that ensures modal claims are indeterminate in\ntruth value when the fiction of possible worlds is apparently silent\nabout corresponding questions about possible worlds, through offering\na treatment of the fiction on which it is indeterminate what the\nfiction itself represents in these cases. Skiba 2017 criticises both\nthe approach taken in the note above and the approach Woodward offers,\nand suggests one way out for the modal fictionalist is to endorse\napparently contradictory sentences that threaten to follow, but to\ntreat these apparent contradictions as only apparent, since\nunder analysis the modal sentences that appear to contradict each\nother really express compatible propositions about the modal\nfiction.\n\nAnother \u201cincompleteness\u201d worry in the literature is that\nexpressed in Nolan 1997a. This is also a worry that the modal fiction\nwill not represent as much as is desirable, though the concern is not\nconfined to those areas in which realists might confess ignorance.\n(The concern resembles an objection Lewis brings against \u201csparse\nlinguistic ersatzism\u201d in Lewis 1986, pp. 142\u2013165.) A modal\nfiction, to be adequate, must represent a very great deal about\npossible worlds, since there are infinitely many claims about possible\nworlds that must be part of the content of the fiction, if there are\nto be enough possible-worlds claims to correspond to all the modal\nclaims we would accept. Only a tiny proportion of the propositions\nabout possible worlds needed will be able to be stated explicitly by\nthe modal fictionalist: constraints of time and space and publication\ncosts will mean that the fictionalist will need to describe the\nfictional worlds in only a few volumes, while an exhaustive explicit\ndescription of even a single possible world as complex as our actual\nworld is beyond our finite resources.\n\nWhat modal fictions will presumably have, however, are generalisations\nabout possible worlds: for instance, principles of recombination and\nplenitude, principles about what truths are respected by all worlds,\nand so on. The modal fictionalist might reasonably hope that these\ngeneralisations imply all of the specific claims needed by\nthe fiction. Implication is, however, a modal notion: not that this is\nautomatically a problem, but it will be a problem for the\n\u201cstrong\u201d modal fictionalist, who seeks to reductively\nanalyse modality in terms of what is true according to the fiction.\nThe strong modal fictionalist\u2019s analysis will be circular if he\nhas to appeal to something like implication (or related modal notions)\nto spell out what claims are represented as true by the fiction, as it\nseems he must if the bulk of the claims are to be represented only\nimplicitly. It seems that a strong modal fictionalist will be stuck\nwith a radically incomplete fiction, if he relies only on what his\nmodal fiction explicitly says, or he faces the task of specifying the\nimplicit content of the modal fiction without recourse to modal\nnotions like implication.\n\nA strong modal fictionalist could attempt to capture non-explicit\ncontent in ways that did not rely on modal resources: one way this\ncould be attempted would be to offer a syntactic account (or some\nother non-modal account) of some sort of consequence relation, and to\nstipulate that the fiction is to be considered closed under the\nrelation thus specified. However, this is not easy to do in such a way\nthat all of the necessary semantic consequences are indeed\n\u201cconsequences\u201d of the explicit generalisations given.\nFurthermore, success at this project threatens to undermine the strong\nmodal fictionalist\u2019s project in another way: for if it was\npossible to give a specification of a relation of\n\u201cconsequence\u201d without relying on primitive modal notions,\nand that did the work of semantic consequence, then this would offer\nan analysis of \u201cbroadly logical\u201d consequence (and\npresumably related notions, such as logical necessity and possibility)\ndirectly, rather than in terms of what was true according to a modal\nfiction, thus making the strong modal fictionalist\u2019s analysis of\nmodality in terms of the fiction redundant. So the strong modal\nfictionalist faces a serious challenge in providing a fiction capable\nof representing what is needed for his theory to be adequate.\n4.3 Which Fiction Should Be Employed?\n\nAn essential part of an adequate modal fictionalist theory is a\nspecification of the fiction of possible worlds which is to be\nemployed. As well as selecting one of the many potential candidate\nstories about worlds, it is also essential to provide an explanation\nand justification of the choice. This is very rarely done by modal\nfictionalists (Armstrong 1989 provides an exception). This is not to\nsay that it cannot be done, or cannot be done plausibly: but\njustifying the choice of fiction is not something that can be\nneglected if a modal fictionalist theory is to be convincing.\nChristopher Peacocke (Peacocke 1999, p. 154) charges Rosen\u2019s\nmodal fictionalist with \u201cfetishism\u201d unless the\nfictionalist can say what is so distinctive about the particular\nfiction chosen.\n\nAs with so many other challenges, timid modal fictionalism can\nimmediately provide the outlines of an answer to this question.\n(Though it is to be remembered that timid modal fictionalism is able\nto avoid so many theoretical difficulties only because the fiction is\nnot asked to do much theoretical work). If the truths of possibility\nand necessity (and conditionality, and other modal truths) obtain\nwithout dependence on the content of the modal fiction, it is surely\nreasonable to suppose that whichever fiction it is correct to employ,\nit must respect those independently obtaining modal truths. Strong\nmodal fictionalists must also ensure that the contents of the fiction\nare associated with the modal claims they wish to make in the\nappropriate way, of course, but this will be of less help to them in\nestablishing the content of the modal fiction. For if the content of\nthe modal fiction is to explain the truth of the modal claims, it must\nbe able to be fixed independently, on pain of circularity. This is\nespecially so if the strong modal fictionalist holds, as one well\nmight, that it is our understanding of the modal fiction that provides\n(perhaps implicitly) our epistemic access to which modal claims are\ntrue and which false. Giving a non-circular specification of the\ncontent of the modal fiction is one of the very difficult challenges\nfacing the strong modal fictionalist.\n\nWhile strong modal fictionalists cannot appeal to an independently\nconstituted body of modal truths, one thing they can do is insist that\nthe modal fiction respect our ordinary modal judgments: that\nis, that by and large if we accept a modal claim as true, the\nassociated claim involving possible worlds will be true according to\nthe modal fiction. (Rosen 1990, p. 337, speaks of the desideratum that\nmodal fictionalism \u201cratify a substantial body of prior\nmodal opinion\u201d.) This is presumably not to forbid any departures\nfrom our pre-theoretic modal judgements, should they be required, but\nit would provide a way even for the strong fictionalist to rule out\ngratuitous departures from our modal opinions.\n\nThe next obvious source of content for the modal fiction is the\nliteral truth about our actual world (Rosen 1990, p. 335). The\naddition of all literally true non-modal propositions (in a suitable\nsense of \u201cnon-modal\u201d) to the fiction as part of its\ndescription of the actual world is useful, since it provides a rich\nsource of content that can be extended by, for instance, a principle\nof recombination, to yield claims about non-actual worlds. It would\nalso seem to be required, for if the fiction fails to be committed to\nthe actual world verifying a certain non-modal truth q, the\ninference from q to Actually-q and back will be\njeopardised. Some particular non-modal truths may prove especially\nuseful: Armstrong 1989, pp. 138\u2013139 mentions analytic truths,\ntruths in virtue of the meanings of terms, in this connection. One can\neither add the actual-world non-modal content by including an\n\u201cencyclopedia\u201d in the fiction, as Rosen does, or one could\nallow it in by, for example, stipulating as extra bridge-laws\nbiconditionals of the form:\n\nP iff According to PW, at the actual world, P\n\n\nfor all non-modal propositions P.\n\nAs well as conformity with our pre-theoretic modal judgements and\ninclusion of an encyclopedia of actual non-modal truths, Rosen 1990\nmentions another source of information to apply in specifying the\nmodal fiction. We have practices of forming modal beliefs involving\nimagining situations in accord with principles of recombination,\nnon-arbitrariness, and so on (p. 339-40). Rosen points out that while\na realist has the challenge of explaining why this practice of\nimagining should be a guide to modal truth, the fictionalist need not\nface this challenge if those practices are part of the process of\nconstructing the fiction of possible worlds. If the constraints, or\nlimits, on our imaginative practices when considering hypothetical\nsituations are vital in our practice of making many of our modal\njudgements, it would make sense to similarly constrain the modal\nfiction.\n\nThere are no doubt many other sorts of constraints which a modal\nfictionalist may appeal to in order to narrow down the class of\nfictions about possible worlds which are acceptable for her purposes.\nEven after all of these constraints are in place, however, there may\nstill be the theoretical possibility that more than one fiction about\npossible worlds (complete or incomplete) satisfies them equally well.\nA fictionalist facing a choice between equally deserving fictions\nwould need to address the issue of what attitude to take to other\nmodal fictionalists who choose differently. (Should they be judged\nincorrect? Correct, because judgements about the content of the modal\nfiction are relative to which (acceptable) fiction is adopted? Or\nshould they be judged to be talking about something else?). Or perhaps\nthe fictionalist could find some way to avoid making the choice of one\nsingle fiction. Woodward 2011 explores one way to avoid making this\nchoice: he suggests modifying the fictionalist biconditional to relate\nmodal claims to a range of acceptable fictions, allowing for\nsome truth-value gaps when the acceptable fictions diverge from each\nother.\n\nIf the fictions disagreed sufficiently, there may even be fictions\nwhich meet the constraints but which differ on matters which are\nlinked through the fictionalist\u2019s biconditionals with literal\nmodal claims. (This is only possible if the modal truths themselves\nare not being appealed to as constraints on acceptable fictions, so is\nnot a problem which faces the timid modal fictionalist). If the\nconstraints are not enough to uniquely determine the truth-value of\nevery modal claim, then not only the determinacy of the content of the\nfiction but the determinacy of the truth-value of some modal claims is\nat stake. Are those modal claims true or false, or neither? Might they\nbe fiction-relative, so there are no-fault disagreements about\nthem?\n\nThis is not the place to attempt to settle the matter of whether\nconstraints are likely to uniquely determine a modal fiction, nor\nwhether it would be genuinely objectionable if they did not do so.\nRather, the issues are mentioned as ones to be kept in mind when\nformulating or defending a modal fictionalist theory.\n4.4 The Theoretical Primitives of Modal Fictionalism\n\nMetaphysical theories often rely on resources which are taken as\n\u201cprimitive\u201d: roughly, theoretical resources which are not\nto be further explained or analysed. Different theories of the same\nsubject matter will often take different resources to be primitive,\nand while it is a difficult question to decide whether one set of\nprimitives is better or worse than another, evaluation of the relative\nsimplicity, naturalness, or other merits of theoretical primitives is\npart of the evaluation of rival theories. This sort of comparison can\ncan be especially relevant in areas where disputes between rival\ntheories are not to be settled easily by experiment or observation.\nSuch disputes make up one of the battlegrounds between fictionalists\nand their rivals, with anti-fictionalists claiming that the unanalysed\ntheoretical resources which fictionalists rely on render fictionalist\ntheories unattractive, or at least relatively unattractive compared to\nsome rival or other.\n\nThe central piece of theoretical machinery the modal fictionalist\nemploys is the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator. When\nit is glossed in tempting ways, as \u201cif PW were true, then\n\u2026\u201d or \u201cit follows from PW that \u2026\u201d, it\nseems to be a modal notion: and if this is not to be further\nexplained, the modal fictionalist cannot use the fiction of possible\nworlds and its contents as the basis of an analysis of modality in\nterms of something else. (This sort of analysis is sometimes known as\na reductive analysis.) This will only be of concern to some\nmodal fictionalists, of course \u2014 timid fictionalists will not\nhave been looking for a reductive analysis of modality based on their\nfiction in the first place \u2014 and some timid fictionalists such\nas Divers 1999b explicitly endorse modal explanations of the\nfictionalist operator (Divers 1999b, p. 335). Such fictionalists may\nbe happy to take advantage of possible analyses of \u201caccording to\nthe fiction\u201d operators in modal terms, and in so doing provide\nan answer to the question of how to understand such expressions: but\non the other hand, their position may not be attractive to someone\nprimarily concerned to analyse modal operators. (Even timid\nfictionalism is compatible with a reductionist account of modality, of\ncourse, since the timid fictionalist may seek to explain modality in\nsome other terms. It is just that it is not hospitable to reductionist\naccounts of modality in terms of possible worlds).\n\nA fictionalist who wishes to provide an analysis of modality, on the\nother hand, had better not take their \u201caccording to PW\n\u2026\u201d operator to be analysed in terms of standard modal\ndevices, or alternatively in terms of possible worlds (see Rosen 1990,\npp. 344\u2013345). The canonical version of the theory that Rosen\npresents takes the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator to\nbe a primitive one: that is, one which is not to be further analysed,\nin modal or non-modal terms (Rosen 1995, p. 70). Rosen points out that\none might think that his favoured prefix is a modal locution, and if\nso even his position cannot be said to entirely reduce the modal in\nfavour of the non-modal (Rosen 1990, pp. 344-345). Nevertheless, as he\npoints out, it may still be thought to be some theoretical advance to\nbe able to explain all of the other modal notions using only this one.\nIt is hard to know how the issue of whether or not \u201caccording to\nPW\u2026\u201d should count as a modal operator is to be decided:\nin any case, it will not be further pursued here.\n\nRegardless of its status as a modal locution, Rosen recognizes that it\nis a very unsatisfying primitive: the notion of a proposition being\ntrue according to PW is an unlikely one to be considered basic and\nunanalysable. Whether or not this is a fatal flaw of Rosen\u2019s\nproposal is, he acknowledges, \u201ca matter of somewhat delicate\njudgement\u201d (Rosen 1990, p. 349). What he does have to say about\nit, however, is that arguably many realists about possible worlds have\nalso not provided a satisfactory analysis of the \u201caccording to\nthe fiction \u2026\u201d operator, and so face the same\n challenge.[7]\n\n\nThe issue of whether \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d is a\nsatisfactory theoretical primitive is presumably partly to be settled\nby seeing what rival theories are possible, and what primitives they\nneed to rely on to account for modality and for fiction. Beyond that,\nhow to settle disputes about the relative attractiveness of primitives\nis a difficult issue in philosophical methodology. Taking such an\napparently complex operator to be unanalysable looks unattractive\n(Nolan 1997a, pp. 273\u2013274), but the position is perhaps not\nuntenable. A better option for the modal fictionalist interested in\nanalysing modality in terms of the modal fiction might be to attempt a\nnon-modal explanation of what is true according to fiction. In any\ncase, this problem, like many problems for modal fictionalism, does\nnot arise for the timid modal fictionalist. For those fictionalists\nfor which it is a problem, however, the unattractiveness and\nunintuitiveness of taking \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d or a\nsimilar device to be primitive remain a largely unaddressed\nchallenge.\n4.5 Does Modal Fictionalism Deliver Possible Worlds Semantics?\n\nJohn Divers in Divers 1995 argues that modal fictionalism cannot\ndeliver the benefits of the standard possible worlds semantics for\nmodal discourse. There is a discussion of Divers\u2019s argument in\nthe following supplementary document: \n\n [Modal Fictionalism and Possible Worlds Semantics]\n \n4.6 Three More Concerns\n\nModal fictionalism has attracted a range of other objections and\nconcerns. Some of these can be generalised to other fictionalist\nprojects; some generalise to other approaches to possible worlds; and\nsome seem to rely on specific features of modal fictionalist\nproposals. Rather than trying to describe each controversy in detail,\nI will briefly outline three with some references for those who wish\nto track down the relevant\n literature.[8]\n\nThe Threat from Abstractionism: Fictionalists seem to\nneed fictions, in the sense of stories or story-like entities. Some\nrealists about possible worlds treat possible worlds themselves as\nrepresentational entities of the same general sort that fictions seem\nto be: these theorists are \u201cabstractionists\u201d in the\nterminology of van Inwagen 1986, or \u201cersatzers\u201d in the\nterminology of Lewis 1986. Abstractionists may take worlds to be\nconstructions out of sentences, or perhaps more commonly identify\nworlds with maximal propositions or with constructions out of\npropositions (e.g. sets of propositions). Once we have representations\nthat are rich enough to represent every possibility, fictionalists\nneed to explain why they prefer to be be fictionalists rather than\nidentifying possible worlds with the appropriate representations.\n\nAbstractionist realism seems more straightforward than fictionalism in\na number of ways, so fictionalists, particularly platonist\nfictionalists, risk being victims of their own success and collapsing\ninto a kind of realism. (Nolan 1997a p 272 mentions this worry.) Rosen\n1990, particulary on pp 328\u20139, mentions some motivations for a\nfictionalist to not be an abstractionist. Turp 2011 discusses a\nsimilar challenge: on many accounts of the ontology of fiction,\nfictional worlds would themselves be some sort of existing abstract\nobject, of the sort that a fictionalist who wishes to reject\nabstractionism seems committed to rejecting. Finally, Dombrovszki 2017\nendorses the existence of the possible worlds postulated by a modal\nfiction: in his \u201chybrid modal fiction\u201d possible worlds are\ncreatures of fiction but nevertheless exist (much as so-called\n\u201cfictional realists\u201d hold that Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object that exists). If Dombrovszki is right, this is not so\nmuch a threat from abstractionism as an opportunity to be a modal\nfictionalist and a realist about possible worlds at the same time.\n\nConcern About Concern: Rosen 1990 (pp 349\u2013354)\ndiscusses an \u201cargument for concern\u201d against modal\nfictionalism, analogous to an argument from concern famously offered\nby Saul Kripke against David Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory. (Kripke\n1980 p 45) Hubert Humphrey, upon losing an election, cares that he\ncould have won. On the face of it, he does not care that someone like\nhim elsewhere in reality does win. Yet according to David\nLewis\u2019s analysis of what it is for Humphrey to have possibly\nwon, his possibly winning amounts to a \u201ccounterpart\u201d of\nHumphrey winning a (counterpart) election in another possible\nworld.\n\nLikewise, Humphrey presumably does not care very much whether a\nspecial story about him claims that he wins in an alternative\nuniverse. Rosen, along with many other philosophers, thinks that this\nwould not directly show there was any problem with a theory that\naccounted for the possibility of Humphrey winning in terms of the\ngoings-on in another concrete universe, or the contents of a\ndistinctive fiction: Humphrey might care about a fact without\nrealising what the analysis of that fact involves (Rosen 1990 p 349).\nRosen instead suggests there may be a \u201cpragmatic\u201d cost to\nthe view: those who come to accept it may have to revise substantially\nwhat they care about, either by caring more about the goings-on of a\nstory, or less about what could have happened. There is also the\nquestion of why we should care about what happens in any of the\nplausible candidate fictions: this perhaps touches on the question of\nchoosing a fiction discussed in 4.3, above.\n\nLewis 1986 pp 195\u2013197 argues that a version of the argument from\nconcern can be at least raised about any realist possible worlds\ntheory account of possibility: and, he would likely add, any\nfictionalist account as well. If Humphrey is unfamiliar with\npossible-worlds-jargon, he may not take himself to have any concern\nwith possible worlds when it hurts that he could have won. Of course,\ntheorists may wish to offer reasons why some accounts do better in\nrespecting the facts about what we are concerned with than others. (Or\nindeed give general reasons why no argument from concern is a\nchallenge to theories of possibility.)\n\nAbout Aboutness: Armour-Garb (2015, 1212\u20131218)\nraises a concern for a modal fictionalist seeking an \u201celliptical\nrendering\u201d of modal claims in terms of a claim about what is true\naccording to a fiction of possible worlds. It is that the modal claims\nwe begin with are not about the same things as the paraphrases in\nterms of a fiction of possible worlds. For example, instead of the claim that possibly, there are blue swans, which seems to be about swans and their color, we in effect get a claim about a fiction (we get a claim that means \u201caccording to MF, there are blue swans in a possible world\u201d). \n This is a problem, according to\nArmour-Garb, because the point of modal claims involves them being\nabout the things they normally seem to be about, so the modal\nfictionalist\u2019s substitute is inadequate. A theorist could, of\ncourse, endorse the fictionalist biconditional without thinking that\nmodal claims are about a fiction of worlds at all. Rosen 1990 does\ntalk, in the case of strong modal fictionalism, of an\n\u201canalysis\u201d of modal claims in terms of claims about what\nis true according to the modal fiction, so modal fictionalists who\nwant to follow him in this need to be clear about whether they think\nthis analysis gives the meaning of the modal claims they use. And if\nthe analysis is intended to give the meaning of modal expressions, they should make clear why\nit does not change the subject from what we took ourselves to be\nsaying all along.",
