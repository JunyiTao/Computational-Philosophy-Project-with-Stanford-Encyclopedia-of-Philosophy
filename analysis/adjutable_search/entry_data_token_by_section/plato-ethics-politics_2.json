    "main_text": "Introduction: The Question and the Strategy || The Adopted Strategy\n1.3 The Adopted Strategy\n\n\nThe difficulty of this task helps to explain why Socrates takes the \ncurious route through the discussion of civic justice and civic \nhappiness. Socrates can assume that a just city is always more \nsuccessful or happy than an unjust city. The assumption begs no questions, \nand Glaucon and Adeimantus readily grant it. If Socrates can then \nexplain how a just city is always more successful and happy than an \nunjust city, by giving an account of civic justice and civic \nhappiness, he will have a model to propose for the relation between personal justice and flourishing.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 strategy depends on an analogy between a city and a person.\nThere must be some intelligible relation between what makes a city\nsuccessful and what makes a person successful.  But to answer the\nRepublic\u2019s question, Socrates does not need any particular\naccount of why the analogy holds, nor does he need the\nanalogy to hold broadly (that is, for a wide range of\ncharacteristics). It works even if it only introduces an account of\npersonal justice and happiness that we might not have otherwise\nentertained.\n\n\nAlthough this is all that the city-person analogy needs to do,\nSocrates seems at times to claim more for it, and one of the abiding\npuzzles about the Republic concerns the exact nature and\ngrounds for the full analogy that Socrates claims. At times Socrates\nseems to say that the same account of justice must apply to both\npersons and cities because the same account of any predicate\n\u2018F\u2019 must apply to all things that are F (e.g.,\n434d\u2013435a). At other times Socrates seems to say that the same account\nof justice must apply in both cases because the F-ness of a whole is\ndue to the F-ness of its parts (e.g., 435d\u2013436a). Again, at times\nSocrates seems to say that these grounds are strong enough to permit a\ndeductive inference: if a city\u2019s F-ness is such-and-such, then a\nperson\u2019s F-ness must be such-and-such (e.g., 441c). At other times,\nSocrates would prefer to use the F-ness of the city as a heuristic for\nlocating F-ness in persons (e.g., 368e\u2013369a). Plato is surely right to\nthink that there is some interesting and non-accidental relation\nbetween the structural features and values of society and the\npsychological features and values of persons, but there is much\ncontroversy about whether this relation really is strong enough to\nsustain all of the claims that Socrates makes for it in\nthe Republic (Williams 1973, Lear 1992, Smith 1999, Ferrari\n2003).\n\n\nStill, the Republic primarily requires an answer to Glaucon \nand Adeimantus\u2019 question, and that answer does not depend logically \non any strong claims for the analogy between cities and persons. \nRather, it depends upon a persuasive account of justice as a personal\nvirtue, and persuasive reasons why one is always happier being just \nthan unjust. So we can turn to these issues before returning to \nSocrates\u2019 remarks about the successful city.\n",
