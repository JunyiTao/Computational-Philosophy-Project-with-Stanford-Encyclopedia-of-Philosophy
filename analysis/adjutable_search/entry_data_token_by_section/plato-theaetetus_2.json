Overall Interpretations of the Theaetetus\n\n\nThe Theaetetus is a principal field of battle for one of the\nmain disputes between Plato\u2019s interpreters. This is the dispute\nbetween Unitarians and Revisionists.\n\n\nUnitarians argue that Plato\u2019s works display a unity of doctrine and a\ncontinuity of purpose throughout. Unitarians include Aristotle,\nProclus, and all the ancient and mediaeval commentators; Bishop\nBerkeley; and in the modern era, Schleiermacher, Ast, Shorey,\nDi\u00e8s, Ross, Cornford, and Cherniss.\n\n\nRevisionists retort that Plato\u2019s works are full of revisions,\nretractations, and changes of direction. Eminent Revisionists include\nLutoslawski, Ryle, Robinson, Runciman, Owen, McDowell, Bostock, and\nmany recent commentators.\n\n\nUnitarianism is historically the dominant interpretive tradition.\nRevisionism, it appears, was not invented until the text-critical\nmethods, such as stylometry, that were developed in early\nnineteenth-century German biblical studies were transferred to\nPlato.\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, a different brand of Revisionism has\ndominated English-speaking Platonic studies. This owes its impetus to a\ndesire to read Plato as charitably as possible, and a belief that a\ncharitable reading of Plato\u2019s works will minimise their dependence on\nthe theory of Forms. (Corollary: Unitarians are likelier than\nRevisionists to be sympathetic to the theory of Forms.)\n\n\nUnitarianism could be the thesis that all of Plato\u2019s work is,\nreally, Socratic in method and inspiration, and that Plato should be\ncredited with no view that is not endorsed in the early dialogues.\n(In some recent writers, Unitarianism is this thesis: see\nPenner and Rowe (2005).) But this is not the most usual form of\nUnitarianism, which is more likely to \u201cread back\u201d the\nconcerns of the Phaedo and the Republic into the\nSocratic dialogues, than to \u201cread forward\u201d the studied\nagnosticism of the early works into these more ambitious later\ndialogues. Likewise, Revisionism could be evidenced by the\nobvious changes of outlook that occur, e.g., between the\nCharmides and the Phaedo, or again between the\nProtagoras and the Gorgias. But the main focus of\nthe Revisionist/Unitarian debate has never been on these\ndialogues. The contrasts between the Charmides and the\nPhaedo, and the Protagoras and the Gorgias,\ntell us little about the question whether Plato ever abandoned the\ntheory of Forms. And that has usually been the key dispute between\nRevisionists and Unitarians.\n\n\nHence the debate has typically focused on the contrast between the\n\u201cthe Middle Period dialogues\u201d and \u201cthe Late\ndialogues.\u201d  Revisionists say that the Middle Period dialogues\nenounce positive doctrines, above all the theory of Forms, which the\nLate dialogues criticise, reject, or simply bypass. The main place\nwhere Revisionists (e.g., Ryle 1939) suppose that Plato criticises the\ntheory of Forms is in the Parmenides (though some\nRevisionists find criticism of the theory of Forms in the\nTheaetetus and Sophist as well). The main places\nwhere Revisionists look to see Plato managing without the theory of\nForms are the Theaetetus and Sophist.\n\n\nRyle\u2019s Revisionism was soon supported by other Oxford Plato scholars\nsuch as Robinson 1950 and Runciman 1962 (28). Revisionism was also\ndefended by G.E.L. Owen. More recently, McDowell 1976, Bostock 1988,\nand Burnyeat 1990 are three classic books on the Theaetetus\nof a decidedly Revisionist tendency.  (McDowell shows a\nparticularly marked reluctance to bring in the theory of Forms\nanywhere where he is not absolutely compelled to.)\n\n\nRevisionists are committed by their overall stance to a number of more\nparticular views. They are more or less bound to say that the\nlate Plato takes the Parmenides\u2019 critique of the theory of\nForms to be cogent, or at least impressive; that the\nSophist\u2019s theory of \u201cthe five greatest\nkinds\u201d (Sophist 254b\u2013258e) is not a development of the\ntheory of Forms; and that the Timaeus was written before the\nParmenides, because of the Timaeus\u2019 apparent defence\nof theses from the theory of Forms. Their line on the\nTheaetetus will be that its argument does not support the\ntheory of Forms; that the Theaetetus is interesting precisely\nbecause it shows us how good at epistemology Plato is once he\nfrees himself from his obsession with the Forms.\n\n\nSome of these Revisionist claims look easier for Unitarians to dispute\nthan others. For example, Plato does not think that the arguments of\nParmenides 130b\u2013135c actually disprove the theory of\nForms. Rather, it is obviously Plato\u2019s view that Parmenides\u2019 arguments\nagainst the Forms can be refuted. See Parmenides 135a\u2013d,\nwhere Plato explicitly says\u2014using Parmenides as his\nmouthpiece\u2014that these arguments will be refuted by\nanyone of adequate philosophical training. (Whether anyone \u201cof\nadequate philosophical training\u201d is available is, of course,\nanother question.)\n\n\nAnother problem for the Revisionist concerns Owen 1965\u2019s proposal,\nadopted by Bostock 1988, to redate the Timaeus to the Middle\nPeriod, thus escaping the conclusion that Plato still accepted the\ntheory of Forms at the end of his philosophical career. The trouble\nwith this is that it is not only the Timaeus that the\nRevisionist needs to redate. In quite a number of apparently Late\ndialogues, Plato seems sympathetic to the theory of Forms: see e.g.,\nPhilebus 61e and Laws 965c.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Revisionist claim that the Theaetetus\nshows Plato doing more or less completely without the theory of Forms\nis very plausible. There are no explicit mentions of the Forms at all\nin the Theaetetus, except possibly (and even this much is\ndisputed) in what many take to be the philosophical backwater of the\nDigression. The main argument of the dialogue seems to get along\nwithout even implicit appeal to the theory of Forms. In the\nTheaetetus, Revisionism seems to be on its strongest ground\nof all.\n\n\nThe usual Unitarian answer is that this silence is studied. In the\nTheaetetus, Unitarians suggest, Plato is showing what\nknowledge is not. His argument is designed to show that\ncertain sorts of alternatives to Plato\u2019s own account of knowledge must\nfail. Plato demonstrates this failure by the \u2018maieutic\u2019\nmethod of developing those accounts until they fail. Thus the\nTheaetetus shows the impossibility of a successful account of\nknowledge that does not invoke the Forms. \n\n\nThe fault-line between Unitarians and Revisionists is the deepest\nfissure separating interpreters of the Theaetetus. It is not\nthe only distinction among overall interpretations of the dialogue. It\nhas also been suggested, both in the ancient and the modern eras, that\nthe Theaetetus is a sceptical work; that the\nTheaetetus is a genuinely aporetic work; and that the\nTheaetetus is a disjointed work. However, there is no space\nto review these possibilities here. It is time to look more closely at\nthe detail of the arguments that Plato gives in the distinct sections\nof the dialogue.\n",
