Restoration Cambridge and Latitudinarianism\n\nThe year after the appearance of the Immortality of the\nSoul, More published his Explanation of the Grand Mystery of\nGodliness (1660). Although Richard Ward tells us that More vowed\nto write this book during a \u201cdangerous fit of Sickness, if it\nshould please God to recover him from it\u201d (Ward 2000, 335),\nthere is every reason to suppose that, after the Immortality,\nMore felt he had said enough about the philosophical background to his\nbeliefs, and fully intended to turn to an explication of his faith.\nFurthermore, the decision to write an exposition of his religious\nideas may have been influenced by the political upheaval following the\ndeath of Oliver Cromwell in 1659, and the restoration of the monarchy.\nMore had taken the Engagement late in 1650 (engaging to be true and\nfaithful to the Commonwealth of England) (Gabbey 1992, 113\u20134)\nand was therefore in a precarious position on the reinstatement of the\nexiled and ejected fellows who had refused the Engagement.\n\nBy this time More\u2019s anti-Calvinism and his emphasis upon\nrational theology ensured that he was branded as a\n\u201cLatitude-man\u201d by more conservative divines, and with the\nreturn of the exiles to Cambridge the Latitudinarians came to be seen\nas potentially subversive in both politics and religion (Crocker\n2003). If More did write his Grand Mystery of Godliness\npartially as a response to his precarious situation in Cambridge he\ndid not engage in dissimulation of his beliefs. Evidently More\nbelieved that his position was so reasonable that a clear statement of\nhis beliefs would win over his critics and result in his complete\nrehabilitation. More\u2019s chief purpose in the book was to persuade\nbelievers that there are only a few essential doctrines of the Church,\nall other details of one\u2019s faith being indifferent to\none\u2019s salvation, and that all that was required of a good\nChristian was to recognise and adhere to these essentials (which was\nthe hallmark of Latitudinarianism).\n\nUnfortunately, but perhaps predictably, More\u2019s stratagem did not\nwin over all his readers. For one thing, there were too many people at\nCambridge who had a vested interest in bringing him down (as a leading\nLatitudinarian), and for another, More, typically, could not prevent\nhimself from introducing more theological niceties into his discussion\nthan were compatible with his irenic purposes. In particular, while\ndiscussing the dual nature of Christ, as both human and divine, More\ncould not forebear from bringing in the doctrine of the pre-existence\nof souls, and suggested that Christ\u2019s human soul had been in\nperpetual union with the Father for all eternity (and was in this\nrespect uniquely different from other human souls). More also went on\nto use his own theory of the three \u201cvehicles\u201d of the soul,\naetherial, aerial, and terrestrial (which he had introduced in\nConjectura Cabbalistica and developed more fully in the\nImmortality of the Soul), as a way of persuading doubters of\nthe reasonableness of accounts of Christ\u2019s resurrection and\nascension.\n\nJoseph Beaumont (1616\u20131699), who had been established as Master\nof Jesus College after the Restoration but had just moved to become\nMaster of Peterhouse, privately circulated a manuscript raising ten\nmajor objections against More\u2019s Grand Mystery of\nGodliness in 1663. More was evidently beleaguered by more\nwidespread opposition in Cambridge at this time, and Edward, Lord\nConway, at the urging of his wife, Anne, arranged a preferment for\nMore in Ireland. More weathered the storm, however, even after his\nApology of Dr Henry More (1664), a response to Beaumont and\nother critics, elicited Some Observations on the Apologie of Dr.\nHenry More (1665) from an unconvinced Beaumont. More\u2019s\nideas drew further implicit criticism the following year from Samuel\nParker (1640\u20131688), later to become Bishop of Oxford (1686), in\nhis A Free and Impartial Censure of the Platonick Philosophie\n(1666).\n\nMore\u2019s position improved as Latitudinarianism came to be seen\nmore sympathetically in Restoration England. Where it was once a\ndisparaging term for someone with a \u201cbroad swallow\u201d, who\nwould accept anything, and so was taken to be insincere in everything,\nit later came to be seen as a genuinely irenic position, and perhaps\nthe best hope for reconciling all factions. It has to be said,\nhowever, that as Latitudinarianism came to be seen in this more\npositive light, More was increasingly exposed, ironically, as too\nidiosyncratic, too much committed to rather outlandish theological\npositions, such as his Origenianism, to count as a typical\nLatitudinarian, who would insist only on a very few fundamental\ndoctrines, all of which were (supposedly) immediately acceptable to\nall Christians.\n\nOne aspect of this can be seen in More\u2019s attempts to offer the\ncorrect interpretation of the Revelation to St John, which must have\nreminded some contemporaries of the importance of prophecy and\nchiliastic claims to many of the radical sectarian groups of the\nInterregnum period. Perhaps this was another case of More\u2019s own\ntendency towards religious enthusiasm resurfacing. He pursued his\ninterpretation of prophecy in his Synopsis prophetica of 1664\nand the Exposition of the Seven Epistles to the Seven\nChurches of 1669 (and revisited these studies towards the end of\nhis life with a verse by verse analysis of the Revelation in\nApocalypsis apocalypseos, 1680, and other apocalyptic works)\n(Almond 1993, Hutton 1994). In keeping with his dualistic theology,\nMore rejected chiliastic or millenarian expectations of a Day of\nJudgement which would see a general resurrection of all the bodies of\npast ages, and argued instead for a more spiritual Second Coming and\nresurrection. Here again, More drew on his ideas about the aetherial\nand aerial vehicles of the soul, which he was able to link to the\nresurrection in heavenly and incorruptible form as conceived by St\nPaul (1 Corinthians 15, 45\u201355).\n\nIf More\u2019s apocalypticism was taking him away from the more\nconciliatory and irenic concerns of the increasing community of\nLatitudinarian thinkers in England, he showed no regrets. Indeed, from\nnow on More\u2019s theology was to develop along increasingly\nidiosyncratic, and dogmatic lines.\n",
