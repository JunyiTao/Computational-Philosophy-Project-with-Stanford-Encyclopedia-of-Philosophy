    "main_text": "The logic of definitions || Foundations of the traditional account\n2.2 Foundations of the traditional account\n\nThe traditional account of definitions is founded on three ideas. The\nfirst idea is that definitions are generalized identities; the second,\nthat the sentential is primary; and the third, that of reduction. The\nfirst idea\u2014that definitions are generalized\nidentities\u2014motivates the traditional account\u2019s inferential\nrules for definitions. These are, put crudely, that (i) any occurrence\nof the definiendum can be replaced by an occurrence of the definiens\n(Generalized Definiendum Elimination); and, conversely, (ii) any\noccurrence of the definiens can be replaced by an occurrence of the\ndefiniendum (Generalized Definiendum Introduction).\n\nThe second idea\u2014the primacy of the sentential\u2014has its\nroots in the thought that the fundamental uses of a term are in\nassertion and argument: if we understand the use of a defined term in\nassertion and argument then we fully grasp the term. The sentential\nis, however, primary in argument and assertion. Hence, to explain the\nuse of a defined term \\(X\\), the second idea maintains, it is\nnecessary and sufficient to explain the use of sentential items that\ncontain \\(X\\). (Sentential items are here understood to include\nsentences and sentence-like things with free variables, e.g., the\ndefiniens of (4); henceforth, these items will be called\nformulas.) The issues the second idea raises are, of course,\nlarge and important, but they cannot be addressed in a brief survey.\nLet us accept the idea simply as a given.\n\nThe third idea\u2014reduction\u2014is that the use of a formula\n\\(Z\\) containing the defined term is explained by reducing \\(Z\\) to a\nformula in the ground language. This idea, when conjoined with the\nprimacy of the sentential, leads to a strong version of the Use\ncriterion, called the Eliminability criterion: the definition\nmust reduce each formula containing the defined term to a formula in\nthe ground language, i.e., one free of the defined term. Eliminability\nis the distinctive thesis of the traditional account and, as we shall\nsee below, it can be challenged.\n\nNote that the traditional account does not require the reduction of\nall expressions of the extended language; it requires the\nreduction only of formulas. The definition of a predicate \\(G\\), for\nexample, need provide no way of reducing \\(G\\), taken in isolation, to\na predicate of the ground language. The traditional account is thus\nconsistent with the thought that a stipulative definition can add a\nnew conceptual resource to the language, for nothing in the ground\nlanguage expresses the predicative concept that \\(G\\) expresses in the\nexpanded language. This is not to deny that no new\nproposition\u2014at least in the sense of truth-condition\u2014is\nexpressed in the expanded language.\n",
