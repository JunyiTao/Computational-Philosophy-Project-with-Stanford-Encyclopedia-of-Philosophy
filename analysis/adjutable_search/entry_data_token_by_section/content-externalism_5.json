    "main_text": "Content Externalism || Narrow Content\n3.3 Narrow Content\n\nA fourth response to the arguments for content externalism involves\naccepting the force of those arguments but limiting their\nsignificance. According to this type of response, externalism is true\nof only one type of content, or of content understood in one\nparticular way. The kind of content susceptible to Putnam/Burge-style\nconsiderations is wide or broad content. But there\nis, some have argued, another type of content\u2014narrow\ncontent\u2014that is immune to these kinds of arguments. In the years\nimmediately following the publication of Putnam (1975), it was common\nto think of narrow content as phenomenal content (see, e.g.,\nFodor 1981, 1982; McGinn 1982). The motivation for this is the idea\nthat even if the contents of you and your twin\u2019s beliefs vary,\nthere is still something that you and your twin have in common. You\nboth believe, for example, that the colorless, odorless, transparent,\npotable etc. liquid in front of you is wet. This strategy faces at\nleast two problems. First, it conflicts with Burge\u2019s claim that\nhis type of counterfactual earth argument applies to all concepts\nknown by observational means, a category which includes properties\nsuch as being colorless, being odorless, etc. Second, even if the\nfirst objection can be avoided, it is not clear that we can purge\nthese phenomenal specifications of content of all concepts immune to\ntwin earth style considerations (for example, the concept of liquid as\nemployed in the above specification) whilst retaining sufficient\nresources to adequately specify the content of the belief.\n\nFodor (1987) adopts a different strategy. He agrees that physically\nidentical individuals have different wide contents when embedded in\ndifferent contexts. However, Fodor suggests that their beliefs still\nhave the same narrow contents, which are functions from contexts to\nwide contents. You and your twin share this: a something (it is\nimpossible to specify what this is) which when plugged in to the\nearthly context yields the (broad) content that water is wet, but when\nplugged into the twin-earthly context yields the (broad) content that\ntwater is wet (a content expressed by the twin-earthly \u201cWater is\nwet\u201d, of course). This strategy has been objected to by\nStalnaker (1989) and Block (1991) on the grounds that narrow content,\nas conceived by Fodor, is not, in fact, content at all. If narrow\ncontents, as Fodor argues, map contexts of thinking onto\ntruth-conditions, they do not themselves have truth-conditions and\ntherefore fail to qualify as contents in any recognizable sense.\nAccording to Stalnaker (1989), narrow content is, therefore, nothing\nmore than syntax (understood as functional or computational\nrole).\n\nThere are two more recent developments in semantic theory that can\nbeen used to identify and defend a concept of narrow content. One of\nthese is two-dimensional semantics and its application to the\ncontents of propositional attitudes (Lewis 1981, Jackson 2007, and\nChalmers 2012). Chalmers, for example, argues that a generalized 2D\nsemantic framework can be used to isolate an a priori aspect of\nmeaning that will be shared by you and your twin. You and your twin,\non this view, always have a priori access to the truth-conditions of\nyour own thoughts or sentences. If correct, this entails that there is\na type or component of content that is not vulnerable to twin earth\nmanipulation and so might qualify as narrow.\n\nThe second development derives from the phenomenal intentionality\ntheory. Advocates of the idea of phenomenal intentionality seek\nto ground the intentionality of mental states in phenomenal\nconsciousness, the subjective, experiential features of those states.\nAccording to this view, phenomenal intentionality is basic, with any\nother forms of intentionality derivative upon this basic form (Horgan\n& Tienson 2002, Loar 2003, Kriegel 2013). According to many\narticulations of the phenomenal intentionality theory (e.g., Siewert\n1998; Kriegel 2007, 2011; and Farkas 2008), the content of your\nthought and that of your twin is the same and that content is narrow.\nThese attempts to construct a viable notion of narrow content have\nbeen systematically criticized by Yli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne (2018). If\nthey are correct, there is no form of content that can be easily\ncordoned off from the world, and a thoroughgoing form of content\nexternalism must, therefore, be true.
