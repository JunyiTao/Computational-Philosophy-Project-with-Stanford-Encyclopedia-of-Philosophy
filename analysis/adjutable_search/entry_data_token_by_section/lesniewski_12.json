    "main_text": "Personality and Legacy || Le\u015bniewski as a Person\n6.1 Le\u015bniewski as a Person\n\n \nNormally the character of an academic is of marginal relevance to his\nor her work. In the case of Le\u015bniewski there is reason to think\notherwise. The extreme rigor that he applied in logic, the\nunflinchingly high standards he set himself and others, his blank\nincomprehension of intellectual, formal and linguistic inexactness,\nand his willingness to let academic disagreement sour his\nrelationships with colleagues, all speak of an unusual rigidity. This\nseems to have been deeply anchored: of his school days we know little\nother than that he was intolerant of exceptions to any rule, whether\nor not the rule was sensible. After one of his early Polish essays was\ntypeset with a spelling mistake in the title\n(\u2018\u015brodku\u2019 instead of \u2018\u015brodka\u2019), he\nalways quoted the incorrect title, because to correct it would have\nbeen to break the rule that quotation must be literal and exact. In\nhis early years he nursed the project of translating Anton Marty\u2019s\nrambling and polemical 1908 treatise Untersuchungen zur\nGrundlegung der allgemeinen Grammatik und Sprachphilosophie\n[Investigations on the Founding of General Grammar and Philosophy\nof Language]. He never got beyond the second word of the title,\n\u2018zur\u2019, which is admittedly not easily captured in all its\nnuances\u2014it can mean \u2018toward\u2019 as well as\n\u2018on\u2019 or \u2018about\u2019. Having carried a copy of the\nbook around for some time and asked all his friends and colleagues how\nthey would translate \u2018zur\u2019, he gave up. No doubt his\ninterests shifted, but the incident demonstrates both his\npunctiliousness and his inflexibility.\n\nBiographical material about Le\u015bniewski is fairly sparse, and it\nis even harder to gain a clear idea of what he was like as a person. Jadacki (2016) contains much new information about Le\u015bniewski, his family, and his relationships with colleagues and contemporaries, but even here the man behind the words and (invariably unsmiling) photographs is not easily discernible.\nA photograph of him in Twardowski\u2019s seminar in 1913 shows a short,\ndapper man with a goatee and a flamboyant neckscarf, as described by\n\u0141ukasiewicz. In later photographs from the same period he lacks the\ngoatee but retains a moustache. Two well-known later photos show a\nstiffly-posed, stocky, clean-shaven man in a business suit with the\nslicked-back hair of the period, looking more like a bank manager than\na professor of logic, except for an intense stare. Le\u015bniewski was\nknown to be a fierce critic of what he considered unclear, which was\npretty well everything. His stock complaint was that he could not\nunderstand what speakers were saying, or writers were writing. In the\nlight of his pathological inability to see beyond the literal meaning\non the page to any intended but inaccurately expressed meaning this is\nunsurprising, but also unendearing. In the early 1920s Marjan\nBorowski, the editor of\nPrzegl\u0105d Filozoficzny, complained to Twardowski that\npeople were afraid to submit papers or give talks in Warsaw because\nthey were fearful of being criticised by Le\u015bniewski, though he\nadded with some glee that the scourge of God had risen up against him\nin the shape of one Tajtelbaum \u2013 the young Tarski. Even the\nphlegmatic Twardowski found his former student irritating: in a diary\nentry for 12 August 1930 he complains, \u201cIn general those who\nbehave according to Lesniewski\u2019s model ask very arbitrarily for\nanalysis where it is convenient to them\u2014if, however, one of them\nasks for analysis where it is not convenient to him, they turn to\nintuition. And if the opposer in the discussion sometimes tries to\nturn to intuition, they reply \u2018We don\u2019t understand what\nyou consider to be intuitively given\u2019.\u201d Twardowski\u2019s 1921\npaper \u2018Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia\u2019 is a plea for\nphilosophers not to put symbols above things, and while its ostensible target is the French physicist Henri Bouasse, it is clearly implicitly directed\nagainst \u0141ukasiewicz and Le\u015bniewski and their students.\n\n Le\u015bniewski was however not lacking in a certain heavy humor.\nLejewski reported that he once mocked a Warsaw Professor of Classics\nfor wearing sunglasses (then rather rare): \u201cIs the world too dazzling for\nhim?\u201d He was equably resigned to his lectures being sparsely\nattended because of their extreme technicality. One semester,\nunexpectedly many students turned up at the first lecture. He looked\naround the room in surprise and asked \u201cWhat are you all doing\nhere? I am not Bergson.\u201d For those who were just there for the\nsake of doing a course and clocking up their attendance he quietly\nsigned off their lecture books straight away, and told them not to\nworry about coming again. The few die-hards came for the sake of the\nlogic. Le\u015bniewski would enter the lecture room with a briefcase\nstuffed with papers, root around, find where he had got to and\ncarry on, writing formulas and explaining how they were derived. When\nQuine visited some of these lectures, he was able to follow them\ndespite knowing no Polish.\n Le\u015bniewski married in 1913: his wife Zofia Prewysz-Kwinto\ncame of a landed family from Kimborciszki (Kimbarti\u0161k\u0117) in rural\nLithuania. They had no children. Before World War I Le\u015bniewski\nseems to have had the means to travel around to different German\ncities to study, and to spend time after his doctorate in Paris, San\nRemo and St. Petersburg.\n\n Le\u015bniewski inspired devotion in a very small coterie of students,\na few of whom stayed fiercely loyal, but sooner or later he ended up\nalienating nearly everyone, either through his robust professional\nopinions, or his manner, or his political views. He started out as a\nradical socialist\u2014his decision to spend the war in Russia was\npartly personal and partly political\u2014but after the excesses of\nthe October Revolution and its aftermath he rejected socialism. From\nthe 1920s he supported the authoritarianism of J\u00f3zef\nPi\u0142sudski, but from about 1930 his views took on a darker\nanti-Semitic tinge. An unsavory letter written to Twardowski in 1935\ncomplains of \u201cfilthy tricks\u201d being played on him \u201cby\ncertain Jew-boys or their foreign friends\u201d, declares a personal\nantipathy to Tarski, whose career he would not obstruct, but admits he\n\u201cwould be extraordinarily pleased if some day I were to read in\nthe newspapers that he was being offered a full professorship, for\nexample in Jerusalem, from where he could send us offprints of his\nvaluable works to our great profit.\u201d Tarski had been passed over\nfor the chair in Lw\u00f3w, which went to Chwistek on the strength of\npraise from Russell, even though the Varsovians, including\nLe\u015bniewski, had supported Tarski. Tarski certainly felt aggrieved\nand no doubt suspected anti-Semitic motives, but like Le\u015bniewski\nhe was prickly and sensitive about matters of priority. It is in\nretrospect mildly grotesque to see how carefully Le\u015bniewski and\nTarski dance around each other in their prefaces and acknowledgements,\nneither wishing to give public offence to the other. Despite their\ndisagreements and suspicions however, they long continued to meet once a week,\nwith no one else present, to discuss logic.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s antipathy towards set theory was so vehement and\nhis criticisms so intemperate that it led to a break in relations with\nhis set-theoretically minded mathematical colleagues Sierpi\u0144ski\nand Kuratowski; he resigned from the editorial board of Fundamenta\nMathematicae, with the result that he was no longer able to\npublish his own work there. By the end of his life, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\nonly surviving close friend was the saintly patient and faithful\nKotarbi\u0144ski, who alone of his colleagues visited him in hospital\nin his last illness. They had been born just days apart in\n1886. The cancer that killed Le\u015bniewski was no doubt exacerbated\nby smoking: cigars and a large pipe. During the operation he was\nconscious and without anaesthetic because of the dangers and he was\nallowed to smoke even then to distract himself from the pain. But he\ndid not recover, and died sitting in his favourite armchair, brought\nspecially into the hospital.\n",
