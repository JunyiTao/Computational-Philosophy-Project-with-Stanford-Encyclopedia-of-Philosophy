    "main_text": "Empirical Findings || Neuroscience\n3.3 Neuroscience\n\nA great deal of experimental work has been devoted to identifying the\ndedicated brain regions or network of brain regions that are reliably\ninvolved in ToM tasks (see Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2013 for an\noverview). This empirical work usually takes the form of correlative\nfMRI neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, TMS, studies.\nSchuwerk, Langguth, and Sommer (2014) report on findings that have\nbeen employed using both of these methods to test a diverse range of\nsubjects of different genders, ages, and cultural backgrounds.\n\nBased on accumulated evidence, it is now claimed that five regions of\nthe brain are specifically and reliably active in ToM tasks. These\nregions have been identified as (1) the left and right temporoparietal\njunction (LTPJ and RTPJ); (2) the left and right dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex (DLPFC); (3) the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG);\n(4) the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC); and (5) the\nposterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) (Schuwerk et al. 2014).\n\nThe idea that mindreading involves a large-scale network respects\nApperly\u2019s (2010) warning against over-emphasizing the importance\nof any single brain region and assigning it the function of\n\u201cmindreading\u201d per se. Focusing too narrowly on single\nbrain regions, it is argued, overlooks the importance of a broader set\nof neural regions that must work together in concert, on the\nassumption that many such regions serve their own important or even\nindispensable mindreading functions.\n\nData-driven meta-analyses of networks seek to reveal the more\nspecialized functional contributions of specific brain regions within\na broader neural network. For example, it has been claimed that TMS\nstudies can identify the specific contribution of particular regions\nto overall ToM tasks (Kalbe et al. 2010). Reportedly, TMS studies\nsuggest that the medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC), for example, plays\na part in enabling subjects to distinguish their perspective from that\nof others. By contrast, other findings suggest that the R-TPJ brain\nregion is selectively enlisted for tasks requiring the\ninterpretatively complex attribution of mental states to others (Mahy,\nMoses, & Pfeifer 2014). For example, Saxe and Wexler (2005) found\nthat R-TPJ activity is increased compared to other regions. This\nhappens when the professed beliefs or desires of story protagonists\nconflict with a subjects\u2019 background expectations about what\nthese characters ought to believe or desire. Moreover, this region is\nnot similarly recruited for other tasks that involve assessing other,\nmore general, socially relevant facts about persons.\n\nImportantly, it appears that the relevant selectivity of this brain\nregion comes late in the day, emerging \u201cin the R-TPJ between\nages 6 and 11 years\u201d (Saxe 2009: 1206). Citing work by\nKobayashi, Glover, and Temple (2007), in their systematic examination\nof the neural evidence of major theories of ToM acquisition, Mahy,\nMoses, and Pfeifer (2014) also emphasize that\n\n\nalthough 8-to-12-year-old children significantly engage TPJ\nbilaterally in ToM stories \u2026 younger children do not always\nshow this selective TPJ recruitment. (2014: 70)\n\n\nThere is some consensus that the TPJ is recruited and involved in FP\nmodes of understanding minds in later stages of development. There is\nalso evidence that there no single, dedicated neural network at play\nin ToM-related tasks across all stages of development (Gweon et al.\n2012). In a bid to make sense of these findings, Saxe and colleagues\ntake seriously the\n\n\nrecent hint that middle childhood is a critical time for interactions\nbetween language and theory of mind. (Saxe 2009: 1207)\n\n\nThese findings present a prima facie challenge for approaches\nthat assume ToMs are innate and early-maturing (see Saxe 2009; Mahy,\nMoses, & Pfeifer 2014).\n\nImportantly, it is worth noting that even the TPJ is not deployed only\nor solely in ToM tasks. Commenting on this lack-of-specificity problem\nconcerning the TPJ, Apperly (2010) reports the following conclusions\nreached in a meta-review of neuroimaging studies: the so-called\n\u201cmindreading network\u201d was implicated not only in\nmindreading tasks but also in tasks involving information recall,\ngeneral reasoning, and inductive reasoning in uncertain conditions. It\nturns out that many tasks that do not appear to inherently involve ToM\nnevertheless evoke activity in the TPJ, violating the specificity\ncriterion (see Mahy, Moses, & Pfeifer 2014).\n\nSome, such as Rosenberg (2018), are sanguine that, taken together, the\nneuroscientific findings provide\n\n\nevidence that the theory of mind is localized to a small number of\nspecific brain regions acting together as a mental module. (2018:\n60)\n\n\nThese considerations also allow for the possibility that mindreading\nis, at best, enabled by a loose confederation of brain areas that pull\ntogether in widescale networks to complete ToM task as opposed to\nconsisting of a stable dedicated brain network (Anderson 2014).\n\nToM-focused neuroscience is still developing. A recent verdict on the\nstate-of-the-art summarizes the current situation:\n\n\nAlthough functional neuroimaging techniques have been widely used to\nestablish the neural correlates implicated in ToM, the specific\nmechanisms are still not clear.
