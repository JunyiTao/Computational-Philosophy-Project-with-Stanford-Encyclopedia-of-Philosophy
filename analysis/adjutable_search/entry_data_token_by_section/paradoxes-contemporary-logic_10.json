Logical developments and paradoxes until 1930\n\nIn the period until 1930, the problem of paradoxes led naturally to\nand was subsumed under the investigation of logical calculi (its final\nby-product being the Hilbert-Ackermann textbook of\n1928). This in turn opened the way to the\nsimplification of type theory, to important generalizations of the\nnotion of set, and to an almost final axiomatic elaboration of set\ntheory (along the Zermelian route, but also following the new path\nopened up by Johann von Neumann). The basic logical tool is\nessentially axiomatic formal analysis.\n",
