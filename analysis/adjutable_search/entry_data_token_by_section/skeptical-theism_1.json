    "main_text": "Outweighing Goods and Noseeum Inferences || Basic Outweighing Goods Argument\n1.1 Basic Outweighing Goods Argument\n\nA simple thought is that if God exists, there would be no evil. After\nall, God could prevent any evil there is; God would know about any\nevil there is; and God would want to prevent any evil there is. But\nthis simple thought is too simple. For even if God exists, it need not\nbe the case that God wants to prevents any evil there is. For God may\nhave a justifying reason for permitting evil.\n\nFrequently, in life, agents are justified in permitting evil if there\nis some reason that justifies their permission of it. A common and\nwell-known kind of reason is that the permission of the evil is\nnecessary for either bringing about some greater good or preventing\nsome worse evil from occurring. (We\u2019ll use the term\n\u2018outweighing goods\u2019 to refer inclusively to the greater\ngoods or worse evils.) Indeed, the complexity of trading off\npermitting evils for outweighing goods is not just a part of\nconsequentialist thinking but pervades most ordinary ethical and legal\nthinking. There may be other kinds of reasons that justify an agent in\npermitting evil. (For instance, perhaps the agent does not have the\nappropriate authority to prevent the evil or the actions necessary to\nprevent the evil would go against the agent\u2019s character or\npersonal projects.) But justifying reasons involving outweighing goods\nhave dominated discussions of arguments from evil; so this entry will\nfocus on them. Keeping these points in mind, one important argument\nfrom evil is this (compare Rowe 1979, 1984, 1986; Martin 1978):\n\nNot-Outweighed\n\nN-O1.1\nIf God exists, then for any evil e, God is justified in\npermitting e only if God\u2019s permission of e is\nnecessary for some outweighing good.\nN-O1.2\nThere is at least one evil e such that God\u2019s\npermission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood.\nN-O1.3\nTherefore, there is no God.\n\n\n\nThis argument is deductive; thus, defenses of it focus primarily on\nthe premises. N-O1.1 is seen as a\nplausible claim articulating God\u2019s obligations to the rest of\nus. N-O1.2 is an existential claim,\nstating that some evil is, crudely put, not outweighed. A\nstraightforward way of defending it is existential generalization:\nfind specific evils such that God\u2019s permission of them\nis not necessary for some outweighing good, and then generalize to\nN-O1.2.\n",
