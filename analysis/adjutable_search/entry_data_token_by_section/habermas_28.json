Habermas took up the term and developed\nhis own distinct interpretation of it beginning with the\n\u201chistorians\u201d dispute\u2019 of 1986. Constitutional\npatriotism is the theory that in modern states the constitution can,\nand should, take the place of the nation as focus of citizens\u2019\nfeelings of collective identity and the source of their civic\nsolidarity. While originally concerned with specifically post-war West\nGerman questions about history and national identity (1988a), and thus\ndrawing on a rational reconstruction of the postnational form of\nidentification developed in the divided Germany, Habermas later\napplied the theory to modern states more generally, and to the\nEuropean Union in particular (1998c).\n\nNational identity, for Habermas, is a product of the modern era,\ndating from the time of the French Revolution and the later Romantic\nmovement. It was constructed by linguists, historians, and writers and\npropagated through the education system and the public sphere. As\nsuch, the nation is intermediate between traditional and\npost-traditional forms of identity (1988a: 5\u20137; 1992b [1996b:\n494\u20135]). In a traditional society, collective identity is\naccepted unreflexively, as are the society\u2019s conventional\nmorality and worldviews. It is a supposedly natural, pre-political\ngiven. Collective identity in post-traditional society, in contrast,\nis adopted in a reflexive manner, in light of reasons given in the\npublic sphere. While in reality post-traditional, the nation is\nreified as traditional and quasi-natural, and projected into a distant\npast. From the beginning, the nation played a political role in\ngenerating civic solidarity among strangers. National identity\nestablishes an abstract level of solidarity, transcending the\nface-to-face associations which bind people in traditional society:\nvillages, clans, and localities. The feeling that they belong to the\nsame nation motivates individuals to make sacrifices for others who\nthey have never met, whether in terms of redistributive taxation or\nmilitary service (1998c [2001a: 64\u20135]). This was crucial for the\nviability of democratic republics at the transition from traditional\nto post-traditional society. Nationhood provides the cultural\nsubstrate for the \u201cnation of citizens\u201d who govern\nthemselves democratically (1996a essay 4 [1998a: 117\u20138]). But,\nfor a number of reasons, the nation is less and less able to play this\nrole today. For one, all contemporary nation states are increasingly\nmulti-ethnic and multicultural, undermining the idea that a\npurportedly homogeneous collective identity can act as the substrate\nfor democracy. For another, the dangers of extreme ethnonationalism\nare all too obvious: they generate in-group/out-group distinctions\nthat can lead to discrimination, racism, and at the limit to ethnic\ncleansing and genocide. Finally, nation states themselves are\nincreasingly powerless in the face of factors outside their control,\nsuch as global capitalism and climate change. This \u201cpostnational\nconstellation\u201d requires a different form of social integration\n(1998c [2001a: 58\u2013112]).\n\nLuckily, according to Habermas, the relationship between\nconstitutional democracy and the nation is historically contingent\n(1992b [1996b: 495]; 1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132\u20133]; 1998c [2001a:\n76]). A modern society does not need anything as substantial as a\nshared religion, way of life, or repository of values to serve as the\nbasis of collective identity. A democratic political system can\ngenerate its own civic solidarity. Supposing that individuals have\nprogressed from a traditional to a post-traditional level of identity\nand are willing to adopt a more reflexive understanding of their\nidentity, the constitution can replace the nation as a source of civic\nsolidarity and attachment. The democratic procedure of\nconstitution-making not only produces legitimacy, as described in the\ndiscourse theory of law and democracy, but can also serve as the basis\nof belonging. The goal of constitutional patriotism is not, then, to\neliminate national identity, but rather to decentre\nit and deprive it of its political function. In concrete terms,\nconstitutional patriotism involves citizens developing critical and\nreflexive loyalties and attachments to their country\u2019s\nconstitution and the moral principles encoded therein. What results\nfrom this is a collective identity with a political function.\nCitizens\u2019 status as joint makers and interpreters of the same\nconstitution takes the place of their shared natality and status as\nco-nationals. This view is constitutional in that it revolves\naround the work of making, interpreting, and reflecting on the\nconstitution, which takes place in the public sphere. It is\npatriotic in that it has a binding effect on the community of\ncitizens, furnishing them with civic solidarity and a collective\nidentity. The formation of constitutional-patriotic identity,\nsignificantly, takes place at the level of opinion- and will-formation\nin the public sphere. Unlike supposedly natural and pre-political\nnational identity, it is formed in the light of rational discourse\n(2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 76\u20139]).\n\nCritics of constitutional patriotism argue that it is either too\n\u201cthin\u201d to play the role Habermas assigns to it, or too\n\u201cthick\u201d to really be postnational and open to all, as he\nclaims (Hayward 2007: 186\u20139). The first criticism is that the\nuniversal moral principles encoded in constitutions are too abstract\nand affectively thin to generate a sense of personal loyalty and\ncollective belonging among citizens, compared to the thick bonds of\nnational identity (1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132]; Canovan 2000). Habermas\nrejects this criticism. Citizens interpret the principles found in\ntheir constitution\u2014which represent universal moral and political\nnorms of democracy and human rights, and might be found in any\nliberal-democratic constitution\u2014in the light of their\ncommunity\u2019s unique historical experience. They internalize\nthese principles, not abstractly, but in the context of the history of\ntheir country (1996a essay 8 [1998a: 225\u20136]). Constitutional\nprinciples become part of the \u201cdense web\u201d of a\nsociety\u2019s (and an individual\u2019s) historical experiences and\npre-political values (2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 77\u20138]). It follows\nthat each country\u2019s constitutional patriotism will be different,\ninflected by the particular past that country has worked\nthrough\u2014Habermas notes that French constitutional patriotism,\nmarked by a tradition of revolutionary democracy, will be different to\nGerman constitutional patriotism, marked by the historical failure to\nproduce a working democracy (1992h: 240\u20131). Far from being an\nabstract, bloodless construct as critics have alleged, Habermas sees\nconstitutional patriotism as intimately connected to each\ncommunity\u2019s particular history and culture, and to its concerns\nabout identity and the common good\u2014its ethical-political\nself-understanding.\n\n\nThe same universalistic content must each time be appropriated from\nout of one\u2019s own specific historical life-situation, and become\nanchored in one\u2019s own cultural form of life. Every collective\nidentity, even a post-national one, is much more concrete than the\nensemble of moral, legal and political principles around which it\ncrystallizes. (1992h: 241)\n\n\nThe second criticism is that supposedly constitutional-patriotic\nidentity is, in reality, the thick identity of the dominant majority\nculture, albeit disguised (Laborde 2002: 593\u20139).\nHabermas\u2019s argument that constitutional principles are\ninterpreted in the light of particular histories plays into this\ncriticism. If a particular country\u2019s constitutional patriotism\nis so closely bound up with its ethical-political self-understanding,\nthen the language, culture, beliefs, and values of that\ncountry\u2019s majority culture will make a deep impression on it.\nConstitutional patriotism consequently collapses into civic\nnationalism. At the same time, Habermas\u2019s claim that the\nconnection between national identity and constitutional democracy is\nmerely contingent holds open the possibility that, even if they have\noverlapped in the past and the present, an ongoing learning process\nmay lead to the two being fully decoupled in the future (1998c [2001a:\n101\u20132]). A further question, articulated by Andrea Baumeister\namong others, is whether the liberal-democratic values which are to be\ninterpreted in the light of national histories are, in fact, as widely\naccepted as Habermas believes (Baumeister 2007: 491\u20135). If not,\nconstitutional patriotism may be more particularistic and Eurocentric\nthan it at first appears, raising questions about how those who do not\nadhere to such values are to be integrated into\nconstitutional-patriotic polities.\n\nHabermas\u2019s longstanding support for a European constitution\n(2001c [2006g]; 1996a essay 6 [1998a]) can be explained by his hope\nthat a European constitutional patriotism would provide the civic\nsolidarity that would allow the transnational polity of the European\nUnion to fulfil its democratic potential (2004 chapter 6 [2006c]).\n",
