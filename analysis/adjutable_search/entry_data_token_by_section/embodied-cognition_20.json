    "main_text": "The Reach of Embodied Cognition || Moral Cognition\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nThis article aims to convey a sense of the breadth of topics that fall\nwithin the field of embodied cognition, as well as the numerous\ncontroversies that have been of special philosophical interest. As\nwith any nascent research program, there remain questions about how\nembodied cognition relates to its forebears, in particular\ncomputational cognitive science and ecological psychology. Some of the\nhardest philosophical questions arising within embodied cognition,\nsuch as those concerning representation, explanation, and the very\nmeaning of \u2018mind\u2019, are of a sort that any theory of mind\nmust address.  Apart from philosophical challenges to the conceptual\nintegrity of embodied cognition there loom psychological concerns\nabout the replicability of some of the most-cited findings within\nembodied cognition; although, in fairness, worries about replicability\nhave recently arisen in many areas of psychology (Goldhill 2019;\nLakens 2014; Maxwell, Lau, and Howard 2015; Rabelo et\nal. 2015). Whatever the future of embodied cognition, careful study of\nits aims, methods, conceptual foundations, and motivations will\ndoubtless enrich the philosophy of psychology.\n",
