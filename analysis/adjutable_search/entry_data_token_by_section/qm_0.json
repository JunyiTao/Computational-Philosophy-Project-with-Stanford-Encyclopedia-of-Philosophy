    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\n\nPhysical systems are divided into types according to\ntheir unchanging (or \u2018state-independent\u2019) properties, and\nthe state of a system at a time consists of a complete\nspecification of those of its properties that change with time (its\n\u2018state-dependent\u2019 properties). To give a complete\ndescription of a system, then, we need to say what type of system it is\nand what its state is at each moment in its history. \n\n\nA physical quantity is a mutually exclusive and\njointly exhaustive family of physical properties (for those who know\nthis way of talking, it is a family of properties with the structure of\nthe cells in a partition). Knowing what kinds of values a quantity\ntakes can tell us a great deal about the relations among the properties\nof which it is composed. The values of a bivalent quantity, for\ninstance, form a set with two members; the values of a real-valued\nquantity form a set with the structure of the real numbers. This is a\nspecial case of something we will see again and again, viz.,\nthat knowing what kind of mathematical objects represent the elements\nin some set (here, the values of a physical quantity; later, the states\nthat a system can assume, or the quantities pertaining to it) tells us\na very great deal (indeed, arguably, all there is to know) about the\nrelations among them.\n\n\nIn quantum mechanical contexts, the term\n\u2018observable\u2019 is used interchangeably with\n\u2018physical quantity\u2019, and should be treated as a technical\nterm with the same meaning. It is no accident that the early developers\nof the theory chose the term, but the choice was made for reasons that\nare not, nowadays, generally accepted. The state-space\nof a system is the space formed by the set of its possible\n states,[2]\n i.e., the physically possible ways of\ncombining the values of quantities that characterize it internally. In\nclassical theories, a set of quantities which forms a supervenience\nbasis for the rest is typically designated as \u2018basic\u2019 or\n\u2018fundamental\u2019, and, since any mathematically possible way\nof combining their values is a physical possibility, the state-space\ncan be obtained by simply taking these as\n coordinates.[3]\n So, for instance, the state-space of a classical mechanical system\ncomposed of \\(n\\) particles, obtained by specifying the values of\n\\(6n\\) real-valued quantities \u2014 three components of position, and\nthree of momentum for each particle in the system \u2014 is a\n\\(6n\\)-dimensional coordinate space. Each possible state of such\na system corresponds to a point in the space, and each point in the\nspace corresponds to a possible state of such a system. The situation\nis a little different in quantum mechanics, where there are\nmathematically describable ways of combining the values of the\nquantities that don\u2019t represent physically possible states. As we will\nsee, the state-spaces of quantum mechanics are special kinds of vector\nspaces, known as Hilbert spaces, and they have more internal structure\nthan their classical counterparts.\n\n\nA structure is a set of elements on which certain\noperations and relations are defined, a mathematical\nstructure is just a structure in which the elements are\nmathematical objects (numbers, sets, vectors) and the operations\nmathematical ones, and a model is a mathematical\nstructure used to represent some physically significant structure in\nthe world.\n\n\nThe heart and soul of quantum mechanics is contained in the Hilbert\nspaces that represent the state-spaces of quantum mechanical systems.\nThe internal relations among states and quantities, and everything this\nentails about the ways quantum mechanical systems behave, are all woven\ninto the structure of these spaces, embodied in the relations among the\nmathematical objects which represent\n them.[4]\n This means that\nunderstanding what a system is like according to quantum mechanics is\ninseparable from familiarity with the internal structure of those\nspaces. Know your way around Hilbert space, and become familiar with\nthe dynamical laws that describe the paths that vectors travel through\nit, and you know everything there is to know, in the terms provided by\nthe theory, about the systems that it describes.\n\n\nBy \u2018know your way around\u2019 Hilbert space, I mean\nsomething more than possess a description or a map of it; anybody who\nhas a quantum mechanics textbook on their shelf has that. I mean know\nyour way around it in the way you know your way around the city in\nwhich you live. This is a practical kind of knowledge that comes in\ndegrees and it is best acquired by learning to solve problems of the\nform: How do I get from A to B? Can I get there without passing through\nC? And what is the shortest route? Graduate students in physics spend\nlong years gaining familiarity with the nooks and crannies of Hilbert\nspace, locating familiar landmarks, treading its beaten paths, learning\nwhere secret passages and dead ends lie, and developing a sense of the\noverall lay of the land. They learn how to navigate Hilbert space in\nthe way a cab driver learns to navigate his city.\n\n\nHow much of this kind of knowledge is needed to approach the\nphilosophical problems associated with the theory? In the beginning,\nnot very much: just the most general facts about the geometry of the\nlandscape (which is, in any case, unlike that of most cities,\nbeautifully organized), and the paths that (the vectors representing\nthe states of) systems travel through them. That is what will be\nintroduced here: first a bit of easy math, and then, in a nutshell, the\ntheory.\n",
