Philosophical Positions\n\nIn his early philosophy, the most significant and influential position\nadopted by \u0141ukasiewicz is his anti-psychologism in logic. This\nwas influenced by Frege, Husserl and Russell. It manifested itself\nterminologically in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s replacement of the\ntraditional term s\u0105d (judgement), used by Twardowski, by\nthe term zdanie (sentence). This change of perspective and\nterminology was adopted by subsequent Polish logicians en\nmasse. After 1920, \u0141ukasiewicz is very sparing in his\nstatements regarding philosophy and philosophical problems. His\nabiding commitment to indeterminism we have noted. His main comments\nand indeed ire are reserved for those who criticise the place of\nmathematical logic (or logistic, as it was then known) in philosophy\nand thought in general. He noted certain convergences in method and\nstyle between the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw School and the Vienna\nCircle, but criticised the latter for their conventionalism and\nrejection of all metaphysics and for their attempt to turn substantive\nproblems into linguistic ones. Despite its abstractness, logic is no\nmore detached from reality than any other science, and it is\nconstrained to conform to aspects of the world. It was his conviction\nthat determinism was false that drove his rejection of bivalent logic.\nWhile maintaining the metaphysical neutrality of logic, he admitted\nlater in the 1930s that whereas he had earlier been a nominalist, he\nwas now a platonist. The source of this conviction is stated at the\nend of his 1937 polemic \u201cIn defence of logistic\u201d:\n\nwhenever I work even on the least significant logistic problem, for\ninstance, when I search for the shortest axiom of the propositional\ncalculus, I always have the impression that I am facing a powerful,\nmost coherent and most resistant structure. I sense that structure as\nif it were a concrete, tangible object, made of the hardest metal, a\nhundred times stronger than steel and concrete. I cannot change\nanything in it; I do not create anything of my own will, but by\nstrenuous work I discover in it ever new details and arrive at\nunshakable and eternal truths. (SW, 249)\n\n\nRarely has the motivation for platonism been so eloquently stated.\n\nIn the philosophy of logic, one of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s most\ndeep-seated convictions, one that he shared with the other logicians\nof the Warsaw School, was that logic has to be extensional, that it is\nthe study of the calculi not of linguistic meanings or psychological\njudgements but of the truth-values, whether just the classical two or\nmore besides. His view is that sentences denote truth-values, and that\nlogic is the science of such logical values, not of sentences (which\nis grammar) or of judgements (which is psychology), or of contents\nexpressed by propositions, or of objects in general (ontology). He\ndoes not justify this position, but simply accepts and assumes it. As\nwe saw, it has far-reaching consequences for his treatment of modal\nlogic, forcing it to be many-valued.\n\nIn addition to the general attitude to scientific philosophizing that\nhe derived from Twardowski, there is one identifiable source of some\nother of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s philosophical stances regarding\nlogic, or if not a source, at least a point of convergent convictions.\nOne is the rejection of a \u201csupertruth\u201d above ordinary\ntruth. This comes out especially clearly in the modal logic \u0141.\nThe other is his liking for degrees of possibility intermediate\nbetween truth (1) and falsity (0), by contrast with the\nnon-quantitative third case of possibility (or in \u0141 twin third\ncases). An exactly similar distinction between two kinds of\npossibility, \u201cunincreasable\u201d, without degrees, and\n\u201cincreasable\u201d, with infinite degrees, can be found in\nMeinong\u2019s massive 1915 treatise \u00dcber M\u00f6glichkeit\nund Wahrscheinlichkeit. Like \u0141ukasiewicz, Meinong does not\naccord propositions a dignity of necessity higher than truth, and\ndespite having the most ample ontology known to philosophy,\nMeinong\u2019s object theory lacks objects described as necessary: he\nnever mentions God, and ideal objects such as numbers are taken by him\nto subsist, not to exist or subsist necessarily. It is perhaps not\nincidental that on returning to Lw\u00f3w after his visit to Graz,\n\u0141ukasiewicz spoke in 1910 about the law of excluded middle,\nconcluding that like the principle of contradiction it is not\nfundamental, and has practical rather than logical significance. He\nconjectured that it failed for general objects like the triangle in\ngeneral, which is neither equilateral nor not equilateral. Meinong\naccepted such objects, which he called \u201cincomplete\u201d, and\nhad in fact adopted the idea from \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s teacher\nTwardowski. \u0141ukasiewicz also regarded the application of the\nprinciple to real objects as \u201cconnected with the universal\ndeterminism of phenomena, not only present and past ones but also\nfuture ones. Were someone to deny that all future phenomena are today\nalready predetermined in all respects, he would probably not be able\nto accept the principle in question.\u201d The seeds of three-valued\nlogic were already germinating in 1910, after the visit to Graz.\n\nMeinong employed the many values of increasable possibility to give an\naccount of probability. While \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s procedure in\nhis 1913 monograph was based on a different idea, he continued to be\npulled towards the idea that infinite-valued logic might be able to\nshed light on probability. At the very latest by 1935, with the\npublication of a short article on probability and many-valued logic by\nTarski, he knew that the most straightforward approach, that of\nidentifying probabilities with truth-values between 0 and 1, would not\nwork. The reason is that because of probabilistic dependence,\nprobability is not extensional: if \\(p\\) is the proposition that it\nwill rain in Dublin tomorrow and \\(Np\\) is its negation, the\nprobability of the contradictory conjunction \\(KpNp\\) is 0, but if\n\\(p\\) has degree of truth \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\), so does \\(Np\\), and so\n\\(\\tval{KpNp} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) in both \u0141\\(_3\\)\nand \u0141\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\).\nDespite this, as late as 1955\n\u0141ukasiewicz could still muse,\n\nI have always thought that only two modal systems are of possible\nphilosophic and scientific importance: the simplest modal system, in\nwhich possibility is regarded as having no degrees at all, that is our\nfour-valued model system, and the \u21350-valued system\nin which there exist infinitely many degrees of possibility. It would\nbe interesting to investigate this problem further, as we may find\nhere a link between modal logic and the theory of probability.\n(AS, 180)\n\n",
