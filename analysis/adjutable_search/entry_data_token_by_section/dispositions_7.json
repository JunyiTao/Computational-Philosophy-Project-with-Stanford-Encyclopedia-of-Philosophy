    "main_text": "The Dispositional/Categorical Distinction || Entailment\n2.1 Entailment\n\nWhat is it about dispositions that sets them apart from categorical\nproperties? Traditionally it is suggested that ascriptions of\ndispositions do, whilst ascriptions of categorical properties do not,\nentail certain counterfactual conditionals:\n\nEntailment. \n\\(F\\) is a disposition iff there are an associated stimulus\ncondition and manifestation such that, necessarily, \\(x\\)\nhas \\(F\\) only if \\(x\\) would produce the manifestation if\nit were in the stimulus condition.\n\n\nAmong the philosophers who have supported Entailment, or\nsomething like it, are Carnap (1936\u20137), Ryle (1949), Goodman\n(1954), Quine (1960), Mackie (1973), Prior (1985), and Armstrong,\nMartin & Place (1996), Mumford (1998), Choi (2005b, 2008,\n2012).\n\nIf disposition ascriptions do not entail corresponding counterfactual\nconditionals, then Entailment is hopeless. Note\nthat the apparent counterexamples to SCA may seem\nto show just that. But let\u2019s leave this claim aside for the sake of\nargument. Still Entailment might be disputed on the\nground that ascriptions of dispositions are not unique in this regard.\nMellor (1974) takes an allegedly paradigmatic categorical property,\ntriangularity, and claimed that if \\(x\\) is triangular,\nthen if its corners were correctly counted, the result would be\nthree. Entailment therefore seems to predict that\n\u2018triangular\u2019 expresses a disposition. And as for\n\u2018triangular\u2019 so, presumably, for any predicate that might\nbe thought to express a categorical property.\n\nMellor\u2019s suggestion, though, is liable to the problems of\nreverse-finks and maskers. One can easily set up an analogous case to\nan example of reverse-finks or maskers that shows that Mellor\u2019s\nconditional is not entailed by \u2018\\(x\\) is\ntriangular\u2019: \\(x\\) is triangular but if its\ncorners were about to be counted a sorcerer would change its shape so\nthat the result of counting would not be three. Further, Prior (1982,\n1985) argues that if we are to understand \u2018correctly\u2019 in\nthe antecedent of Mellor\u2019s conditional as referring to\nthe method of counting, as opposed to the result of\ncounting, then his claim is false. For there are possible worlds in\nwhich quirky laws of nature ensure that counting always gives the\nwrong result. (Bird (2003, 2009) gives a useful discussion of the\ngeneral lessons that should be drawn from the debate between Prior and\nMellor.)\n\nBut it might be suggested that these problems for Mellor\u2019s claim can\nbe handled by introducing a ceteris paribus clause\nin much the same fashion as, as we have seen in\n section 1.5,\n some philosophers do with respect to conventional dispositions. The\nsuggestion is that the stimulus condition of triangularity is not\nsimply \\(x\\)\u2019s corners being correctly counted\nbut \\(x\\)\u2019s corners being correctly counted under certain\nstandard conditions. Although \u2018\\(x\\) is\ntriangular\u2019 may not entail Mellor\u2019s conditional as it stands, it\ndoes entail that if \\(x\\)\u2019s corners were correctly\ncounted under certain standard conditions, it would give\nthe result of three, where the standard conditions are understood to\nrule out cases where reverse-finks or maskers operate or quirky laws\nof nature obtain. Notwithstanding this defence of Mellor\u2019s claim,\nhowever, Choi argues that it is still hopeless, to which we will turn\nbelow.\n",
