    "main_text": "Collateral Consequences\n10. Further Issues\n\nA number of further important questions are relevant to theorising\nabout punishment, which can only be noted here.\n\nFirst, there are questions about sentencing. (See generally Robinson\n1987; Morris and Tonry 1990; von Hirsch 1993; Tonry 1996; von Hirsch\nand Ashworth 2005; Ashworth, von Hirsch and Roberts 2009; Frase 2012.)\nWho should decide what kinds and what levels of sentence should be\nattached to different offences or kinds of offence: what should be the\nrespective roles of legislatures, of sentencing councils or\ncommissions, of appellate courts, of trial judges, of juries? By what\ncriteria should such decisions be made: how far should they be guided\nby a retributivist principle of proportionality, requiring punishments\nto be \u2018proportionate\u2019 in their severity to the seriousness\nof the crime; how far by consequentialist considerations of efficient\ncrime-prevention? What kinds of punishment should be available to\nsentencers, and how should they decide which mode of punishment is\nappropriate for the particular offence? Considerations of the meaning\nof different modes of punishment should be central to these questions\n(see e.g., Lippke 2007, Hoskins 2013).\n\nSecond, there are questions about the relation between theory and\npractice \u2014 between the ideal, as portrayed by a normative theory\nof punishment, and the actualities of existing penal practice. Suppose\nwe have come to believe, as a matter of normative theory, that a\nsystem of legal punishment could in principle be justified \u2014\nthat the abolitionist challenge can be met. It is, to put it mildly,\nunlikely that our normative theory of justified punishment will\njustify our existing penal institutions and practices: it is far more\nlikely that such a theory will show our existing practices to be\nradically imperfect \u2014 that legal punishment as it is now imposed\nis far from meaning or achieving what it should mean or achieve if it\nis to be adequately justified (see Heffernan and Kleinig 2000). If our\nnormative theorising is to be anything more than an empty intellectual\nexercise, if it is to engage with actual practice, we then face the\nquestion of what we can or should do about our current practices. The\nobvious answer is that we should strive so to reform them that they\ncan be in practice justified, and that answer is certainly available\nto consequentialists, on the plausible assumption that maintaining our\npresent practices, while also seeking their reform, is likely to do\nmore good or less harm than abandoning them. But for retributivists\nwho insist that punishment is justified only if it is just, and for\ncommunicative theorists who insist that punishment is just and\njustified only if it communicates an appropriate censure to those who\ndeserve it, the matter is harder: for to maintain our present\npractices, even while seeking their radical reform, will be to\nmaintain practices that perpetrate serious injustice (see Murphy 1973;\nDuff 2001, ch. 5).\n\nFinally, the relation between the ideal and the actual is especially\nproblematic in the context of punishment partly because it involves\nthe preconditions of just punishment. That is to say, what makes an\nactual system of punishment unjust(ified) might be not its own\noperations as such (what punishment is or achieves within that\nsystem), but the absence of certain political, legal and moral\nconditions on which the whole system depends for its legitimacy (see\nDuff 2001, ch. 5.2). Recent scholarship on punishment has increasingly\nacknowledged that the justification of punishment depends on the\njustification of the criminal law more generally, and indeed the\nlegitimacy of the state itself (see s. 2 above). For example, if the\nstate passes laws criminalising conduct that is not justifiably\nprohibited, then this calls into question the justification of the\npunishment it imposes for violations of these laws. Questions of\ncriminalisation are thus directly relevant to punishment\u2019s\njustification (see Husak 2008). Similarly, if the procedures by which\ncriminal justice officials apprehend, charge, and prosecute\nindividuals are unjustified, then the subsequent inflictions of\npunishment will be unjustified as well (see Ristroph 2015 and 2016; on\nspecific aspects of criminal procedure, see, e.g., Loader 2014 on\npolicing, Lippke 2011 on plea bargaining, Duff et al 2007 on criminal\ntrials, Flanders 2013 on pardons). More broadly, if a states tolerates\n(or worse, encourages) serious social injustices, then this may\nundermine the state\u2019s standing to punish offenders who are also\nvictims of such injustices (see, e.g., Matravers 2006; Duff 2007;\nHolroyd 2010; Chau 2012; Howard 2013).\n",
