    "main_text": "The Late Period\n4. The Late Period\n\nThe period of greatest innovation and sophistication in the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature seems to have been the second quarter\nof the fourteenth century. After about 1350, less original work is\nknown. Insolubles continued to be discussed, but it seems that for the\nmost part the theories adopted were variations or elaborations of the\nones already seen. Paul of Venice (1499), writing in about\n1396\u20137, in the final section of his Logica Magna, lists\nfifteen theories in addition to his own, supplementing\nBradwardine\u2019s list of nine with later developments, but most\nfrom before 1350 (see Spade 1973: 82\u20134). This later period is\nnot yet fully researched, however, so it is too early for a clear\nverdict.\n",
