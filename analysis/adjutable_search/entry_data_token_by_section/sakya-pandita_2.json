    "main_text": "Epistemology and Philosophy of Language: The Treasury of Reasoning || Concept Formation in the Treasury\n2.2 Concept Formation in the Treasury\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s strict nominalism rejects the reality of cognitive\nand linguistic objects, which makes him an \u201cillusionist\u201d\nabout the mind. Where Daniel Dennett (1991) criticizes the \u201cCartesian\ntheater\u201d model of the mind, in which images play across a mental\nscreen, Buddhist philosophers criticize the \u201cduality\u201d that\nconstitutes the subject/object binary. The notion of a cognitive\nobject, for this tradition, is intertwined with the false reification\nof the self, a cardinal Buddhist error. There could only be mental\nobjects if there were mental subjects; viewing subjects and mental\nobjects are attributable, together, to the tendency of ordinary beings\nmistakenly to project a \u201cself\u201d. Moreover, the utility of\nconcepts for language and thought would require that they be\nunchanging against the backdrop of the Buddhist view that all things\nare impermanent; if, as Sapa\u1e47 argues, they were impermanent,\nthey would be mind-dependent, and hence private objects (see Stolz\n2006). What needs to be explained, therefore, is not the reality of\nconcepts, but the causes that bring about their seeming to\nappear and function.\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists believe that this fundamental error is\nrooted in beginningless karmic tendencies. Our minds have been\nconditioned by our previous actions, and we experience the world\nthrough their capacities and strictures. Our karmic conditioning\nprovides the conceptual nexus through which we think and communicate\nwith other beings who have similar karma and therefore similar\nconceptual tendencies. This karmic basis of conceptualization and\nlanguage, which finds them both to be pragmatically beneficial while\nfundamentally erroneous, is the lynchpin of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\nphilosophical position in the Treasury. Against his\ncontemporaries, who rely upon concepts and linguistic objects being\nquasi-real entities in order to account for cognition and language,\nSapa\u1e47 explains the utility of concepts, and the linguistic\nentities to which they are tied, with reference to the same process\nthat makes them erroneous: the never-ending causal flow of karma. Like\nfloating hairs that appear due to ophthalmic disease, cognitive\nobjects are nothing but a failure in the system, and have no\nindependent reality.\n\nSapa\u1e47 is perhaps uniquely attuned to how decisively it is\nkarma that underwrites the doctrine of apoha, the\nBuddhist approach to concept formation in the light of emptiness. Not\neven Dharmak\u012brti, whose epistemology courted Buddhists of the\n\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na, was willing to be as vividly pragmatist.\nBe that as it may, Sapa\u1e47 makes constant reference to\nDharmak\u012brti and is reasonably seen to have provided a faithful\nextension of his views. Above all, Sapa\u1e47 maintains without\nexception the key ontological distinction in Buddhist epistemology\nbetween real, causally effective momentary particulars that are the\npotential objects of perception, and false conceptual constructions\nthat are the seeming objects of cognition. Where all of reality is\ndivided into these categories, we can see even by the definitions that\nconcepts and abstract objects must be unreal. Chapa and his followers\nspoke of intermediate categories of various kinds\u2014cognitive and\nperceptual objects that are not simply momentary bare\nparticulars\u2014and Sapa\u1e47 and his followers targeted them as\ninsufficient to a Buddhist view.\n\nThe motivation for these intermediate positions is not difficult to\nsee. With such a strict division between momentary perceptual\nparticulars and erroneous linguistic concepts, it is difficult to\nexplain how we could ever arrive at anything like knowledge. This is\nwhere Dign\u0101ga\u2019s doctrine of apoha is supposed to\nhelp. Although there are no real concepts and no linguistic\nuniversals, there are apparent universals that we\nmistakenly\u2014but pragmatically\u2014superimpose on real things.\nWe create concepts not by identifying some real quality or similarity\nthat is shared across distinct entities, but by ignoring most of their\ndifferences and \u201cexcluding\u201d non-members of a set from a\nconceptual field, outside a pragmatically beneficial boundary. A key\nquestion that arises to challenge this possibility is, How can a\nfallacious boundary be pragmatically beneficial? Why, for instance, is\na concept or a word recognized and shared by various people, if there\nis no real similarity among the objects to which it refers? The\nanswer, which as I\u2019ve said Sapa\u1e47 gives more explicitly\nthan any other thinker, is karma. The mistake of\nsuperimposing what is falsely taken to be a real general concept on an\nactually real particular which it is taken to represent works\nfor beings that tend to see things the same way:\n\nWith propensities beginninglessly habituated, and having generated the\npower for an error to appear, on the occasion of the sign, without\ndistinguishing the concepts and the particulars, one imputes the sign,\n\u201cThis is a pot\u201d. Later, if one says, \u201cPour the water\nin the pot\u201d, without asking, \u201cPour the water in the\nindividual pot, or pour it into the concept pot?\u201d one\nunderstands the object of engagement to be the very thing\n itself.[7]\n\n\nKarma also provides the answer to the question of how an unreal\nconcept can be stable in a changing mind, and across references to\ndistinct, changing entities. The answer is that concepts are no more\nstable than the \u201cself\u201d is a real, stable entity. Still,\ndue to karma, we have certain tendencies to experience the world in\nsimilarly-patterned modes. Through Buddhist practice, it is possible\nto overcome these; through Buddhist epistemology, it is possible to\nunderstand their erroneous yet beneficial applications. This expresses\na version of the Buddhist karmic causal theory of meaning that has\nbeen noted in Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thought (see Gold 2006 and Tzohar\n2017a, 2017b).\n",
