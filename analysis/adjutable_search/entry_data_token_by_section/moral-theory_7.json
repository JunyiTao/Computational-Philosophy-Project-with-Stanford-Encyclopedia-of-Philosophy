    "main_text": "Criteria\n4. Decision Procedures and Practical Deliberation\n\n\nAnother function of moral theory is to provide a decision procedure\nfor people to follow so as to best insure they perform right\nactions. Indeed, some writers, such as R. M. Hare hold action guidance\nto be the function of the moral principles of the theory (Hare\n1965). This raises the question of what considerations are relevant to\nthe content of such principles \u2013 for example, should the\nprinciples be formulated taking into account the epistemic limitations\nof most human beings? The requirement that moral principles be action\nguiding is what Holly Smith terms the \u201cUseability Demand\u201d:\n\u201c\u2026an acceptable moral principle must be useable for\nguiding moral decisions\u2026\u201d (Smith 2020, 11). Smith\nenumerates different forms satisfaction of this demand can take, and\nnotes that how one spells out a principle in order to meet the demand\nwill depend upon how the moral theorist views moral success. For\nexample, whether or not success is achieved in virtue of simply making\nthe right decision or if, in addition to making the right decision,\nthe agent must also have successful follow-through on that\ndecision.\n\nThere has been enormous debate on the issue of what is involved in\nfollowing a rule or principle, and some skepticism that this is in fact\nwhat we are doing when we take ourselves to be following a\nrule. (Kripke 1982) Some virtue theorists believe that it is moral\nperception that actually does the guiding, and that a virtuous person\nis able to perceive what is morally relevant and act accordingly\n(McDowell 1979).\n\nAs discussed earlier in the section on criteria, however, this is\nalso controversial in that some theorists believe that decision\nprocedures themselves are not of fundamental significance. Again,\nobjective consequentialist who believes that the fundamental task of\ntheory is to establish a criterion for right argues that decision\nprocedures will themselves be established and evaluated on the basis of\nhow well they get us to actually achieving the right. Thus, the\ndecision-procedures are derivative. Others, such as subjective\nconsequentialists, will argue that the decision-procedures\nspecify the criterion in the sense that following the\ndecision-procedure itself is sufficient for meeting the\ncriterion. For example, an objective consequentialist will hold\nthat the right action maximizes the good, whereas the subjective\nconsequentialist might hold that the right action is to try to\nmaximize the good, whether or not one actually achieves it (Mason 2003\nand 2019). Following the decision-procedure itself,\nthen, is the criterion. \n\nThe distinction between criterion and decision-procedure has been\nacknowledged and discussed at least since Sidgwick, though it was also\nmentioned by earlier ethicists. This distinction allows ethical\ntheories to avoid wildly implausible implications. For example,\nif the standard that the theory recommends is \u2018promote the\ngood\u2019 it would be a mistake to think that \u2018promote the\ngood\u2019 needs to be part of the agent\u2019s\ndeliberation. The consequentialist might say that, instead, it is\nan empirical issue as to what the theory is going to recommend as a\ndecision-procedure, and that recommendation could vary from context to\ncontext. There will surely be circumstances in which it would be\nbest to think in terms of meeting the standard itself, but again that\nis an empirical issue. Likewise, it is open to a Virtue Ethicist\nto hold that the right action is the one the virtuous agent would\nperform in the circumstances, but also hold that the agent\u2019s\ndeliberative processes need not make reference to the standard. \nPretty much all theories will want to make some space between the\nstandard and the decision-procedure in order to avoid a requirement\nthat agent\u2019s must think in terms of the correct standard, in\norder to act rightly, or even act with moral worth. There is a\ndistinction to be made between doing the right thing, and doing the\nright thing for the right reasons. Doing the right thing for\nthe right reasons makes the action a morally worthy one, as it exhibits\na good quality of the will. It is possible for a theory to hold\nthat the \u2018good will\u2019 is one that understands the underlying\njustification of an action, but that seems overly demanding. If\nconsequentialism is the correct theory, then demanding that people must\nexplicitly act intentionally to maximize the good would result in fewer\nmorally worthy actions than seems plausible. The \u2018for the\nright reasons\u2019 must be understood as allowing for no explicit\ninvocation of the true justifying standard.\n\nThis has led to the development of theories that advocate\nindirection. First, we need to distinguish two ways that\nindirection figures into moral philosophy. \n\nIndirection in evaluation of right action.\nIndirection in that the theory does not necessarily advocate the\nnecessity of aiming for the right action.\n\n\nTo use Utilitarianism as an example again, Rule Utilitarianism is an\nexample of the first sort of indirection (Hooker 2000),\nSophisticated Consequentialism is an example of the second\nsort of indirection (Railton 1984). One might hold that some\nversions of Aristotelian Virtue ethics, such as Rosalind\nHursthouse\u2019s version, also are of the first type, since\nright action is understood in terms of virtue. One could imagine\nan indirect consequentialist view with a similar structure: the\nright action is the action that the virtuous person would perform,\nwhere virtue is understood as a trait conducive to the good, instead of\nby appeal to an Aristotelian notion of human flourishing.\n\nThe second sort relies on the standard/decision-procedure\ndistinction. Railton argues that personal relationships are good\nfor people, and explicitly trying to maximize the good is not a part of\nour relationship norms, so it is likely good that we develop\ndispositions to focus on and pay special attention to our loved\nones. The account is open to the possibility that people who\ndon\u2019t believe in consequentialism have another way of deciding\nhow to act that is correlated with promotion of the good. If the\ncriteria a theory sets out need not be fulfilled by the agent guiding\nherself with the reasons set out by the criteria, then it is termed\nself-effacing. When a theory is self-effacing, it has\nthe problem of alienating a person from the justification of her own\nactions. A middle ground, which is closer to Railton\u2019s\nview, holds that the correct justification is a kind of\n\u201ctouchstone\u201d to the morally good person \u2013 consulted\nperiodically for self-regulation, but not taken explicitly into\nconsideration in our ordinary, day-to-day lives. In this way, the\ntheory would not be utterly self-effacing and the agent would still\nunderstand the moral basis for her own actions.\n",
