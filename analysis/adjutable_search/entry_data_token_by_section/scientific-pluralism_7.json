    "main_text": "Ontologies, Classifications and Concepts\n4. Ontologies, Classifications and Concepts\n\nMetaphysical realism is often formulated as the idea of one\nfundamental description of reality as it is in itself. Given such an\nappeal to an \u201cabsolute conception\u201d of \u201cthe world as\nit is independent from our experience\u201d (Williams 1985 [2011:\n139]), science may appear as the best candidate for a purely objective\ndescription of the world that is independent of subjective human\ninterpretation. In contrast with such a monist ideal of one absolute\n\u201cview from nowhere\u201d (T. Nagel 1986), pluralist\nphilosophers have emphasized the diversity of scientific concepts and\nontologies that are influenced by heterogenous interests and values of\nscientists. A substantial part of contemporary philosophy of science\naims to make sense of this plurality and its implications both for\nphilosophical debates and scientific practices.\n",
