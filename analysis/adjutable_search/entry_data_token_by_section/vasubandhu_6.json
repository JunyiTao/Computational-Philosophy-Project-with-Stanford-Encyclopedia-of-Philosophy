    "main_text": "Approaches to Scriptural Interpretation\n3. Approaches to Scriptural Interpretation\n\nVasubandhu was a master of Buddhist scripture. A great number of\nscriptural commentaries are attributed to him, and we find Vasubandhu\nciting scripture literally hundreds of times throughout his\nphilosophical works. (P\u0101s\u0101dika 1989) Furthermore, Vasubandhu\nis one of very few Indian or Tibetan authors to have written a\ntreatise dedicated to the interpretation and exposition of Buddhist\nscripture, called the Proper Mode of Exposition\n (Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti).[31]\n Here is not the place for a thorough survey of this material, which\nawaits future research. It is, however, worth sketching a\ncharacteristic pattern in Vasubandhu\u2019s citation of scripture,\nand noting its relation to his view of scripture in the Proper\nMode of Exposition.\n\nLike other scholastic philosophers, Vasubandhu often cites scriptures\nin support of an argument. Unlike many others, however, Vasubandhu\nregularly presents a scriptural passage as a potential\ncounter-argument, only to refute the traditional interpretation of the\npassage. The opponent\u2019s interpretation, moreover, is quite often\nthe most literal or direct reading of the passage in question. One of\nVasubandhu\u2019s characteristic philosophical moves, then, is to\nargue in favor of a secondary interpretation of a given scriptural\npassage that might, on its face, be thought to disprove his view.\n\nA prominent, paradigmatic example of this use of scriptural citation\ntakes place in the Twenty Verses Commentary. As will be\ndiscussed below (in the section concerning defense of appearance\nonly), this text is dedicated to proving the central\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra thesis of \u201cappearance only\u201d\n(vij\u00f1aptim\u0101tra)\u2014that is, that everything in\nthe many worlds of living beings is only apparent, with no real\nexistence outside of perception. A central challenge to this\nidealistic view, then, comes from the objector\u2019s simple\nstatement that, \u201cIf the images of physical forms, and so on,\nwere just consciousness, not physical things, then the Buddha would\nnot have spoken of the existence of the sense bases of physical form,\nand so on.\u201d (Vi\u1e43\u015b 5) Vasubandhu thus adduces\nthe Buddha\u2019s word as the basis of the objection. Then, he turns\nto further scriptures to account for, and explain away, this extremely\nwell-founded Buddhist doctrine.\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s response to his internal objector is to explain\nthat the passages in question need to be understood as spoken with a\n\u201cspecial intention\u201d (abhipr\u0101ya\u2014on\nwhich, see Broido 1985, Collier 1998 and Tzohar 2018). Furthermore, in\naddition to defending the idea of reinterpreting scripture in general,\nVasubandhu defends the act of reinterpretation in this case. In fact,\nwe may distinguish four separate elements of the argument: (1)\nVasubandhu explains the Buddha\u2019s general practice of speaking\nwords that are not technically true, but are beneficial to his\nlisteners. (2) He proves that such interpretations are sometimes\nnecessary, by providing two passages that without such a reading would\nprove the Buddha to have contradicted himself. (3) He provides an\nexplanation of the Buddha\u2019s \u201cspecial intention\u201d in\nthe passage under discussion\u2014that is, he declares what the\nBuddha actually believes on the topic. And, (4) he suggests\nwhy, in this case, the Buddha might have chosen to speak the words he\ndid, instead of simply saying what he really believed.\n\nFor (1) and (2), Vasubandhu explains that the Buddha\u2019s statement\nthat \u201cthere is a self-generated living being\n(satva)\u201d must be taken as having a \u201cspecial\nintention,\u201d so as to prevent its contradicting his statement\nthat \u201cthere is no self or living being (satva), only\nentities with causes.\u201d (Vi\u1e43\u015b 5) Vasubandhu\nsays that the Buddha spoke the first statement in the context of\nexplaining karma, in order to indicate that the continuity of the\nmental series was not \u201ccut off\u201d (uccheda). If the\nBuddha had taught about the no-self doctrine at the time he delivered\nthe discourse on \u201cthe self-generated living being,\u201d his\nlisteners would have been led to this false view that the mental\nstream comes to an end at death. Such a false view is often translated\nas \u201cnihilism,\u201d and among Buddhists it is considered far\nmore dangerous than the false belief in a self, because it entails the\nfurther false view that our moral actions have no afterlife\n consequences.[32]\n If you believe that, then you are liable to act in a way that\nwill lead you to hell.\n\nThe danger of nihilism is perhaps the primary justification for the\nBuddha\u2019s having spoken words that were technically untrue.\nVasubandhu provides a similar example in the \u201cDisproof of the\nPerson\u201d section of the Treasury. (See the section\nconcerning disproof of person.) There, Vasubandhu was arguing with the\nPersonalists, who pointed to a scripture in which the Buddha remained\nsilent when asked whether or not the person existed after death. The\nPersonalists, of course, saw this as evidence that the Buddha affirmed\nthe ineffability of the person. Vasubandhu says, in response, that the\nBuddha explained quite clearly (to \u0100nanda, his disciple, after\nthe questioner left) why there had been no good way to answer. To\naffirm a self would be to imply a false doctrine, but to deny the self\n(in this case, stating the truth) would cause the confused questioner\nto fall into a still greater falsehood: Namely, the thought of\nformerly having had a self, but now having none. This is the view,\nonce again, of the self being \u201ccut off\u201d or\n\u201cdestroyed\u201d (uccheda), the view that leads to\nmoral nihilism.\n\nThe danger of the false view of \u201cdestruction\u201d is an\nextreme case, in which the Buddha is silent so as not to have to lead\nhis disciple into a dangerous view. To what degree can this paradigm\nbe extended to suggest other, perhaps less dire, cases in which the\nBuddha may have neglected to speak frankly? For Vasubandhu,\napparently, the presence of a contradiction between two statements\nfrom the Buddha is one key. The Buddha cannot have literally meant\nboth that there was no living being (satva)\nand that living beings (satva) came into being in a\nparticular bodily form. A similar contradiction is brought to bear in\nthe discussion with the Personalists, during their argument over the\nfunctionality of memory in the absence of an enduring self. There,\nVasubandhu cites a scripture in which the Buddha says that whoever\nclaims to remember past lives is only remembering past aggregates in\nhis own continuum\u2014a quote which vitiates the Personalists\u2019\ncitation of the Buddha having said of his own past life, \u201cI was\nsuch-and-such a person, with such-and-such a form.\u201d\n\nTo return to the case at hand from the Twenty Verses\nCommentary, although Vasubandhu does not indicate a direct\ncontradiction in the Buddha\u2019s words, he does explain (3) what he\ntakes to be the truth behind the Buddha\u2019s statements about the\n\u201csense bases of physical form, and so on.\u201d The literal\nmeaning of the twelve sense bases, recall, is simply the listing of\nthe six sensory organs and their six sensory objects. The truth behind\nthis, for Vasubandhu, is the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra causal story, which\ntells how conscious events arise from karmic seeds within the\nmind\u2019s own continuum. Each consciousness comes into being with a\nparticular subject/object appearance imprinted upon it by its karmic\nseed. There are no subjects and no objects, only \u201cdual\u201d\nappearances. It is this causal story that was the \u201cspecial\nintention\u201d\u2014the real truth\u2014behind the Buddha\u2019s\nwords affirming the sense bases. Of course, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\ncausal story denies the functionality of the senses, and so the\n\u201cspecial intention\u201d is a direct contradiction of the\nliteral meaning of the sense bases.\n\nIn response to this supposed explanation, the opponent asks for the\nBuddha\u2019s justification for speaking in this way, and (4)\nVasubandhu provides two separate reasons, targeted at two different\nlevels of listeners. For students who do not yet understand the truth\nof appearance-only, the Buddha taught the sense bases in order to help\nthem to understand the absence of self in persons. This seems to\ncohere with Vasubandhu\u2019s Treasury argument that uses\nthe sense bases as a way to explain away the apparent self. For\nstudents who do understand the truth of appearance-only, the\ndoctrine of the sense bases is useful for helping them to\nunderstand the absence of self in the elements\u2014that is, in the\nsense bases\n themselves.[33]\n Thus, for Vasubandhu, the Buddha\u2019s teachings are still useful,\neven when they are understood to have been spoken from a provisional\nstandpoint.\n\nPerhaps this point can be extended still further. For Vasubandhu,\nwhile scriptures are always valid sources of knowledge, to excavate\ntheir meaning often requires in-depth, sophisticated, philosophical\nreasoning. We find Vasubandhu mocking his opponents, in one place in\nthe Treasury, for understanding \u201cthe words\u201d\nrather than \u201cthe meaning\u201d of a scriptural passage in\nquestion. (204.1) Vasubandhu often argues against his opponents\u2019\noverly literal interpretations of scripture as a crucial part of his\nargument against their philosophical positions. When he turns to a\nformal analysis of expository method and theory, Vasubandhu defends\nthis broad, rationalist approach to scripture.\n\nIn the Proper Mode of Exposition, Vasubandhu defends the\nlegitimacy of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras against a\n\u201c\u015ar\u0101vaka\u201d opponent, and defends their\nfigurative, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra interpretation against a\nM\u0101dhyamika opponent. Cabezon (1992) usefully summarizes\nVasubandhu\u2019s arguments here in three general categories:\nArguments based on the structure of the canon; arguments based on\ndoctrinal contents; and arguments based upon \u201cintercanonical\ncriteria for authenticity.\u201d As we have seen in his\nTreasury and Twenty Verses arguments, Vasubandhu\nargues that na\u00efvely to require that all scriptures be interpreted\nliterally is to insist that the Buddha repeatedly contradicted\nhimself. He cites many internal references to lost or unknown texts,\nand argues that this shows that no lineage or school can claim to have\na complete canon. Unlike his M\u0101dhyamika opponents, Vasubandhu\nbelieves that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras must be read under a\n\u201cspecial intention,\u201d so as to prevent the danger of\nnihilism. As Cabezon writes, both the \u015ar\u0101vaka and Madhyamaka\nposition share an over-emphasis on literal readings.\nVasubandhu\u2019s emphasis on \u201ccorrect exegesis\u201d (a\nliteral translation of Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti) shows the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra to be the school of greatest hermeneutical subtlety\nand sophistication.\n",
