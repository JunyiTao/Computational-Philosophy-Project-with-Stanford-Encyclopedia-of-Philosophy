    "main_text": "The highest good and practical postulates || The postulates of pure practical reason\n6.2 The postulates of pure practical reason\n\nKant argues that we can comply with our duty to promote the highest\ngood only if we believe in the immortality of the soul and the\nexistence of God. This is because to comply with that duty we must\nbelieve that the highest good is possible, and yet to believe that the\nhighest good is possible we must believe that the soul is immortal and\nthat God exists, according to\n Kant.[26]\n\n\nConsider first Kant\u2019s moral argument for belief in immortality.\nThe highest good, as we have seen, would be a world of complete\nmorality and happiness. But Kant holds that it is impossible for\n\u201ca rational being of the sensible world\u201d to exhibit\n\u201ccomplete conformity of dispositions with the moral law,\u201d\nwhich he calls \u201choliness,\u201d because we can never extirpate\nthe propensity of our reason to give priority to the incentives of\ninclination over the incentive of duty, which propensity Kant calls\nradical evil (5:122, 6:37). Kant claims that the moral law\nnevertheless requires holiness, however, and that it therefore\n\u201ccan only be found in an endless progress toward that complete\nconformity,\u201d or progress that goes to infinity (5:122). This\ndoes not mean that we can substitute endless progress toward complete\nconformity with the moral law for holiness in the concept of the\nhighest good, but rather that we must represent that complete\nconformity as an infinite progress toward the limit of holiness. Kant\ncontinues: \u201cThis endless progress is, however, possible only on\nthe presupposition of the existence and personality of the same\nrational being continuing endlessly (which is called the immortality\nof the soul). Hence the highest good is practically possible only on\nthe presupposition of the immortality of the soul, so that this, as\ninseparable with the moral law, is a postulate of pure practical\nreason\u201d (ibid.). Kant\u2019s idea is not that we should imagine\nourselves attaining holiness later although we are not capable of it\nin this life. Rather, his view is that we must represent holiness as\ncontinual progress toward complete conformity of our dispositions with\nthe moral law that begins in this life and extends into infinity.\n\nKant\u2019s moral argument for belief in God in the Critique of\nPractical Reason may be summarized as follows. Kant holds that\nvirtue and happiness are not just combined but necessarily combined in\nthe idea of the highest good, because only possessing virtue makes one\nworthy of happiness \u2013 a claim that Kant seems to regard as part\nof the content of the moral law (4:393; 5:110, 124). But we can\nrepresent virtue and happiness as necessarily combined only by\nrepresenting virtue as the efficient cause of happiness. This means\nthat we must represent the highest good not simply as a state of\naffairs in which everyone is both happy and virtuous, but rather as\none in which everyone is happy because they are virtuous\n(5:113\u2013114, 124). However, it is beyond the power of human\nbeings, both individually and collectively, to guarantee that\nhappiness results from virtue, and we do not know any law of nature\nthat guarantees this either. Therefore, we must conclude that the\nhighest good is impossible, unless we postulate \u201cthe existence\nof a cause of nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground\nof this connection, namely the exact correspondence of happiness with\nmorality\u201d (5:125). This cause of nature would have to be God\nsince it must have both understanding and will. Kant probably does not\nconceive of God as the efficient cause of a happiness that is rewarded\nin a future life to those who are virtuous in this one. Rather, his\nview is probably that we represent our endless progress toward\nholiness, beginning with this life and extending into infinity, as the\nefficient cause of our happiness, which likewise begins in this life\nand extends to a future one, in accordance with teleological laws that\nGod authors and causes to harmonize with efficient causes in nature\n(A809\u2013812/B837\u2013840; 5:127\u2013131, 447\u2013450).\n\nBoth of these arguments are subjective in the sense that, rather than\nattempting to show how the world must be constituted objectively in\norder for the highest good to be possible, they purport to show only\nhow we must conceive of the highest good in order to be subjectively\ncapable both of representing it as possible and of fulfilling our duty\nto promote it. But Kant also claims that both arguments have an\nobjective basis: first, in the sense that it cannot be proven\nobjectively either that immortality or God\u2019s existence are\nimpossible; and, second, in the sense that both arguments proceed from\na duty to promote the highest good that is based not on the subjective\ncharacter of human reason but on the moral law, which is objectively\nvalid for all rational beings. So while it is not, strictly speaking,\na duty to believe in God or immortality, we must believe both in order\nto fulfill our duty to promote the highest good, given the subjective\ncharacter of human reason.\n\nTo see why, consider what would happen if we did not believe in God or\nimmortality, according to Kant. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant seems to say that this would leave us without any\nincentive to be moral, and even that the moral law would be invalid\nwithout God and immortality (A813/B841, A468/B496). But Kant later\nrejects this view (8:139). His mature view is that our reason would be\nin conflict with itself if we did not believe in God and immortality,\nbecause pure practical reason would represent the moral law as\nauthoritative for us and so present us with an incentive that is\nsufficient to determine our will; but pure theoretical (i.e.,\nspeculative) reason would undermine this incentive by declaring\nmorality an empty ideal, since it would not be able to conceive of the\nhighest good as possible (5:121, 143, 471\u2013472, 450\u2013453).\nIn other words, the moral law would remain valid and provide any\nrational being with sufficient incentive to act from duty, but we\nwould be incapable of acting as rational beings, since \u201cit is a\ncondition of having reason at all [\u2026] that its principles and\naffirmations must not contradict one another\u201d (5:120). The only\nway to bring speculative and practical reason \u201cinto that\nrelation of equality in which reason in general can be used\npurposively\u201d is to affirm the postulates on the grounds that\npure practical reason has primacy over speculative reason. This means,\nKant explains, that if the capacity of speculative reason \u201cdoes\nnot extend to establishing certain propositions affirmatively,\nalthough they do not contradict it, as soon as these same propositions\nbelong inseparably to the practical interest of pure reason it must\naccept them [\u2026,] being mindful, however, that these are not its\ninsights but are yet extensions of its use from another, namely a\npractical perspective\u201d (5:121). The primacy of practical reason\nis a key element of Kant\u2019s response to the crisis of the\nEnlightenment, since he holds that reason deserves the sovereign\nauthority entrusted to it by the Enlightenment only on this basis.\n",
