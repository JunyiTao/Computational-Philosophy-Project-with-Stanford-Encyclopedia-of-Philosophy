    "main_text": "How to Characterize Quotation || Quotation Identified Semantically\n1.3 Quotation Identified Semantically\n\nAnother tempting strategy is to say that an expression is quoted if it\nis mentioned. There are two problems with this\ncharacterization.\n\nSeveral theorists want to distinguish between mention and\nquotation (see\n Section 3.5).\n This definition would rule their theories out by stipulation.\nThis characterization is no clearer than the intuitive distinction\nbetween use and mention, and matters become even more complicated as\nsoon as we do try to characterize \u2018mention\u2019 and\n\u2018use\u2019. Isn\u2019t \u2018bachelor\u2019 in (4) in some\nsense used to refer to itself? If the response is that it is used, but\nnot with its normal semantic value, then we are left with the\nchallenge of defining \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018abnormal\u2019\nsemantic values. That, again, leads immediately to controversy.\n\n\nIn order to remain as neutral as possible, we will stick with a simple\nidentification-through-examples strategy, and emphasize that it is an\nopen question as to how to identify the sort of linguistic devices to\nwhich the subject in (4) belongs.\n",
