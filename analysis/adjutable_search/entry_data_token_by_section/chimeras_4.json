    "main_text": "The Human Dignity Argument\n5. The Human Dignity Argument\n\n\nAlthough an evaluation of chimeric research in terms of human\ndignity was first put forward by Josephine Johnston and Christopher\nEliot (2003), since then Philip Karpowicz, Cynthia Cohen, and Derek van\nder Kooy (2004, 2005, Cohen 2007) have been the main proponents of this\nview, and I will follow them here.\n\n\nAn approach to chimeric research in terms of human dignity needs to\nprovide an account of (a) what human dignity is, (b) what kinds of\nindividuals have human dignity, (c) what moral implications human\ndignity has, in terms of generating moral prohibitions, requirements,\nor presumptions, and (d) what constraints those moral implications\nplace on chimeric research.\n\n\nHuman dignity is a kind of \u201cunconditioned and incomparable\nworth\u201d (Karpowicz et al. 2005, 119) and individuals with dignity\nare therefore \u201cuniquely valuable and worthy of respect\u201d\n(ibid., 120). Human dignity, understood in this rarefied way,\nis distinct from the common kind of dignity manifested by someone who\nresponds to difficult circumstances in a dignified manner. Although a\nperson can be stripped of this common kind of dignity by being placed\nin degrading circumstances such treatment would be said to violate,\nnot eliminate or diminish, human dignity in the rarefied sense; thus\nthe two concepts are distinct. Indeed, the individual\u2019s dignity in the\nrarefied sense is often alleged to explain what is problematic about\neliminating this common kind of dignity.\n\n\nHuman dignity is grounded in the possession of certain morally\nvaluable cognitive and emotive capacities, and it is because these\ncapacities are valuable that individuals with human dignity are\nthemselves valuable. Accounts of which capacities are relevant vary,\nbut typically include the following: reasoning, autonomous choice,\ncomplex communication, participation in social relations, sympathy, and\nempathy. Those who possess such dignity-grounding capacities have human\ndignity.\n\n\nWhat kind of moral implications does human dignity have? Although it\nis common to invoke human dignity in condemning a wide range of\nnefarious and odious practices, proponents of human dignity are\nnotoriously vague both on the general principles generated by human\ndignity and on how those principles tell against the activities in\nquestion (Macklin 2003). Part of the vagueness lies in the fact that\nproponents of human dignity frequently use language that implies that\nhuman dignity itself is the subject of the wrong (e.g.: \u201ctorture\nundermines human dignity\u201d, \u201chuman cloning denigrates human\ndignity\u201d), but if we instead understand such language as\nshorthand for saying that an individual with human dignity is wronged,\nand is wronged in a way relating to that individual\u2019s\ndignity-grounding capacities, then the following moral implications\nseem plausible. If an individual with human dignity is uniquely\nvaluable and worthy of respect because she possesses morally valuable\ndignity-grounding capacities, then there would be a presumption\nagainst interfering with the development, maintenance, or exercise of\nher dignity-grounding capacities. More strongly, there might even be a\npositive duty to support the development, maintenance, and exercise of\nher dignity-grounding capacities. The proponent of human dignity is\nalso likely to hold that dignity-grounding capacities and the\nindividuals that possess them have a kind of moral value not\nsusceptible to utilitarian or, more broadly, consequentialist\ntrade-offs. Hence, these presumptions will not be rebuttable merely by\nappeals to increased utility or value. This does not, of course,\ncommit the proponent of human dignity to the claim that the\npresumptions are absolute, but it does mean that the presumptions will\nprobably correspond to rights with a relatively high degree of\nstringency.\n\n\nHow, then, do considerations of human dignity give rise to an\nobjection to certain kinds of chimeric research? Karpowicz et al. say\nthe following:\n\n\n\nBy giving nonhumans some of the physical components necessary for\ndevelopment of the capacities associated with human dignity, and\nencasing these components in a nonhuman body where they would either\nnot be able to function at all or function only to a highly diminished\ndegree, those who would create human-nonhuman chimeras would denigrate\nhuman dignity. The torturer or the enslaver of human beings denies them\nthe option of exercising the capacities associated with human dignity.\nThe creator of the human-nonhuman chimera would do even\nworse\u2014he or she knowingly would diminish or eliminate the\nvery capacities associated with human dignity. (ibid.,\n120\u2013121)\n\n\n\nSo, human dignity generates not only a moral prohibition on denying\npeople with human dignity the option of exercising the capacities\nassociated with human dignity, it also generates a moral prohibition\non diminishing or eliminating those capacities themselves. Chimeric\nresearch, especially the introduction of an undissociated mass of\nhuman stem cells into an animal blastocyst-stage embryo\n(ibid., 126), has the potential to run afoul of this second\nmoral prohibition because such a transplant raises the possibility of\nconferring upon an individual some of the physical components\nnecessary (presumably, biologically necessary) for the development of\ndignity-grounding capacities, but without enabling the individual to\nsignificantly exercise those capacities. Such research, Karpowicz et\nal., maintain, therefore diminishes or eliminates those capacities,\nand is therefore unethical.  As an admittedly fantastical example of\nresearch that would run afoul of the prohibition, Karpowicz et\nal. consider transplanting an entire human brain into a nonhuman\nprimate: \u201cthe decision to manufacture a nonhuman research\nsubject with a human brain and, at most, diminished capacities for\nvarious forms of human-like cognition and action would violate human\ndignity\u201d (ibid., 123).\n\n\nThere are two main problems with the Human Dignity Argument.\n\n\nTo see the first problem, notice that despite the terminology of\nhuman dignity, whether some non-human animals have the\ncapacities that ground human dignity and whether some humans lack the\ncapacities that ground human dignity are empirical questions. As to\nthe former, Karpowicz et al. maintain that \u201c[t]he family of\ncapacities associated with human dignity seem to belong uniquely to\nhuman beings\u201d (ibid., 122); as to the latter, they\nmaintain that \u201cthose who are human and yet display a limited\nsubset of these capacities, say, the newborn infant or the person with\nsevere disabilities, still have human dignity\u201d (ibid.,\n121). These answers are inconsistent.  If the dignity-grounding\ncapacities of a human infant are sufficient to give it human dignity,\nthen the many non-human animals with the same or greater degree of\ndignity-grounding capacities have human dignity as\nwell. Alternatively, if a chimpanzee\u2019s lack of dignity-grounding\ncapacities is sufficient to imply that it does not have human dignity,\nthen the even more meager dignity-grounding capacities of a human\ninfant are also sufficient to imply that it does not have\nhuman dignity.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this objection does not presuppose any\nparticular amount of dignity-grounding capacities as being necessary or\nsufficient for human dignity. Given the fact that some non-human\nanimals possess the kind of cognitive and emotive capacities cited by\nKarpowicz et al. to a greater degree than some humans, it cannot be the\ncase that (a) those capacities determine whether an individual has\nhuman dignity, (b) that all humans have human dignity, and (c) that no\nnon-human has human dignity. This is true no matter how strict or\nlenient one wishes to be regarding how many of the dignity-grounding\ncapacities an individual must possess to have human dignity.\n\n\nThe second problem for the Human Dignity Argument lies in its claim\nthat dignity-grounding capacities have been diminished or eliminated\nwhenever (a) we give an individual some of the physical components\nbiologically necessary for the development of dignity-grounding\ncapacities and (b) we do not give it significant opportunity to\nexercise those capacities. Consider that having adequate blood pressure\nis a physical component biologically necessary for dignity-grounding\ncapacities. Stitching a wound on a mouse so that it regains adequate\nblood pressure, then, counts as giving it some of the physical\ncomponents biologically necessary for the dignity-grounding capacities,\nbut it fails to provide the mouse with a body sufficient for the\nsignificant exercise of those capacities. It is clearly false to\nmaintain that such a medical procedure diminishes or eliminates those\ncapacities or, more generally, that such a procedure violates human\ndignity in any way. Or, consider again DeGrazia\u2019s views about the\ncapacities of great apes. If he is right about those capacities,\nwhenever we provide for the biological needs of a great ape while\nfailing to provide them with intensive linguistic training, then we\nprovide them components necessary for dignity-grounding capacities\nwithout the opportunity for exercising them. It is implausible that\nsuch an activity is unethical, as implied by the Human Dignity\nArgument, but even if it were, considerations of human dignity seem\nirrelevant here.\n\n\nLater, Karpowicz et al. mention not the physical components\n\u201cnecessary\u201d for the dignity-grounding capacities, but\nrather those \u201cespecially associated\u201d or \u201cclosely\nconnected\u201d with the dignity-grounding capacities. This raises\nthe possibility that the physical capacities at issue are those\nsufficient for the possession of the dignity-grounding capacities. But\nresearch that confers the physical capacities sufficient for the\npossession of the dignity-grounding capacities ipso facto confers the\ndignity-grounding capacities themselves, in which case the research\nhas not diminished or eliminated the dignity-grounding capacities of\nthe animal research subject. Quite the opposite, the research secured\nthose capacities for the subject (Palacios-Gonz\u00e1lez 2015, 493).  More\ngenerally, the proponents of the human dignity argument face a dilemma\nthat limits their argument\u2019s relevance. On the one hand, if the\nintroduction of human stem cells into a non-human confers\ndignity-grounding capacities onto an animal that would otherwise not\nhave them, then the charge that such research diminishes or eliminates\nthose capacities is false. On the other hand, if the introduction\ndoes not confer dignity-grounding capacities, then the charge\nthat such research diminishes or eliminates those capacities is also\nfalse, as the capacities were never there to begin with.\n\n\nConsiderations of human dignity could ground an objection to research\nin which the subject possesses the dignity-grounding capacities at the\nstart of the research, but then has them eliminated or diminished\nduring the course of the research. Such research would certainly be\nobjectionable, but this cannot be the objection that Karpowicz et\nal. have in mind since they believe that non-humans do not have human\ndignity at the start of the research. Finally, considerations of human\ndignity could ground an objection to research in which, although the\nsubject does not possess the dignity-grounded capacities at the start,\nthe research brings it about that the subject comes to possess those\ncapacities but also prevents it from having the significant\nopportunity to exercise those capacities. The problem in such a case\nis not, pace Karpowicz et al., the elimination or diminution of those\ncapacities, but is rather the treatment of the subject after those\ncapacities have been acquired. This objection overlaps with the\nobjection implied by the Moral Status Framework, discussed in the next\nsection. The difficulty for the human dignity version of this\nobjection is to explain why the problematic feature of such research\nis best understood in terms of human dignity as opposed to moral\nstatus, autonomy, rights, and interests (Macklin 2003, DeGrazia\n2007).\nConsiderations of human dignity occupy a central place within\nGerman law: Germany\u2019s Basic Law says that \u201cHuman dignity shall\nbe inviolable.\u201d For extensive discussion of chimeras within the\nGerman legal context, see the German Ethics Council report,\n\u201cHuman-Animal Mixtures in Research\u201d (Deutscher Ethikrat,\n2013 [2011]). \n",
