    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nR.G. Collingwood was born in 1889 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, at the\nsouthern tip of Windermere. His father, W.G. Collingwood, was an\narchaeologist, artist, and acted as John Ruskin\u2019s private\nsecretary in the final years of Ruskin\u2019s life; his mother was\nalso an artist and a talented pianist. When he was two years old the\nfamily moved to Lanehead, on the shore of Coniston Water, close to\nRuskin\u2019s house at Brantwood.\n\nCollingwood was taught at home until the age of thirteen when he went\nto preparatory school and the following year to Rugby School. In 1908\nhe went up to University College, Oxford, to read Literae\nHumaniores. He was elected as a Fellow of Pembroke College,\nOxford, while still taking his final examinations.\n\nOn beginning his philosophical studies in 1910 he came under the\ninfluence of the Oxford realists, especially E.F. Carritt and John\nCook Wilson. Until around 1916 he was a professed realist; however,\nhis realism was progressively undermined by his close engagement with\ncontinental philosophy, especially the work of Benedetto Croce and\nGiovanni Gentile. This was partly the result of his friendship with\nJ.A. Smith, Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy from 1910\nto 1935. In 1913 he published an English translation of Croce\u2019s\nThe Philosophy of Giambattista Vico; he was later to\ntranslate many other works by both Croce and Guido de Ruggiero. Both\nCroce and de Ruggiero were personal as well as philosophical friends,\nalthough his relationship with de Ruggiero was closer.\n\nMuch of Collingwood\u2019s early work was in theology and the\nphilosophy of religion, under the influence of \u201cThe Group\u201d\nor \u201cCumnor Circle\u201d, a gathering of Church of England\nmodernists. In 1916 he published an essay on \u201cThe Devil\u201d\nin a collection produced by this group, and also his first book\nReligion and Philosophy.\n\nAt the same time Collingwood was engaged in practical archaeological\nwork, spending his summers from 1912 onwards directing excavations of\nRoman sites in the north of England. Although he sometimes described\nhis archaeology as a hobby, he nonetheless became an authority on the\nhistory and archaeology of Roman Britain, conducting many excavations,\nwriting hundreds of papers, and systematically working his way around\nthe country recording and transcribing Roman inscriptions.\n\nDuring the First World War Collingwood applied for a commission in the\narmy but was rejected because of his poor eyesight. Having been a keen\ncadet at Rugby School and an enthusiast for the National Service\nLeague, this came as a blow. From January 1916 onwards Collingwood\nspent most of his time living and working in London in the\nIntelligence Section of the Admiralty; although he continued to see\npupils in Oxford weekly, he gave no lectures between 1916 and 1919. He\nleft the Admiralty in June 1919 and resumed lecturing in January 1920.\nDuring his time at the Admiralty he was the main author of two book\nlength reports: A Manual of Belgium and the Adjoining\nTerritories (1918); and A Manual of Alsace-Lorraine\n(1919). A spin off from this work was his entry on Luxemburg\nin the Encyclopaedia Britannica (12th ed.,\n1921).\n\nIn late 1919 Collingwood wrote an extensive survey of the history of\nthe ontological proof, together with an analysis of the argument. This\nsurvey was given as a series of lectures in the early 1920s. He drew\non this material in some of his later work, especially in Faith\nand Reason (1928), An Essay on Philosophical Method\n(1933) and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). In 1924\nCollingwood wrote Speculum Mentis. This was a dialectic of\nwhat he termed \u201cforms of experience\u201d: art, religion,\nscience, history, and philosophy. During this period he was also\nlecturing on ethics, Roman history, the philosophy of history, and\naesthetics: his Outlines of a Philosophy of Art (based on his\nlectures) was published in 1925.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and early 1930s Collingwood was also heavily\nengaged in historical and archaeological work, publishing The\nArchaeology of Roman Britain in 1930 and several editions of\nRoman Britain. The culmination of this work was his survey of\nRoman Britain in Roman Britain and the English Settlements\n(1936) and his contribution to Tenney Frank\u2019s Economic\nSurvey of Ancient Rome (1937). To add to his self-imposed burden\nof overwork, his abilities as a linguistically versatile polymath (he\nwas able to read scholarly work in English, French, Spanish, Italian,\nGerman, Dutch, Latin, and Greek) were in great demand from 1928\nonwards in his capacity as a Delegate to the Clarendon Press.\n\nPartly as a result of serious overwork coupled with insomnia,\nCollingwood\u2019s health went into decline from the early 1930s. In\nApril 1931 he suffered complications arising from chicken pox and\nbegan to suffer from high blood pressure. He was granted leave of\nabsence by the university; following his return, in the autumn of\n1932, he began writing an important new book, regarded by many as the\npinnacle of his philosophical achievement\u2014An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method (1933). This had its origins in the\nmethodological introduction to the lectures on moral philosophy he had\ndelivered annually throughout the preceding decade. The Essay\nwas a sustained investigation of the nature of philosophical reasoning\nthrough an examination of the distinctive character of philosophical\nconcepts. Following publication of the Essay, Collingwood\nfocused his philosophical energies on the philosophy of history and\nthe philosophy of nature. The lectures he delivered at this time later\nformed the basis of the posthumously published The Idea of\nHistory (1946) and The Idea of Nature (1945).\n\nIn 1935 Collingwood succeeded J.A. Smith as Waynflete Professor of\nMetaphysical Philosophy and moved from Pembroke to Magdalen College.\nHe delivered his inaugural lecture on The Historical\nImagination in October of that year. He had been elected as a\nFellow of the British Academy in 1934 and delivered a lecture on\nHuman Nature and Human History to the Academy in May 1936.\nThese two lectures were later incorporated into The Idea of\nHistory.\n\nIn 1937 Collingwood wrote The Principles of Art (1938);\nwhilst correcting the proofs he suffered a stroke, the first of many\nto come. From this time onwards he was conscious that he was writing\non borrowed time. His An Autobiography (1939) records his\ndetermination to put on record an account of the work he hoped to do\nbut might not live to complete. During a recuperative voyage to the\nDutch East Indies in 1938\u20139 he wrote An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940) and began work on what he regarded as his\nmagnum opus, The Principles of History (not published until\n1995). In 1939 he sailed around the Greek islands with a group of\nRhodes scholars studying at Oxford\u2014a journey memorably\nrecollected and evoked in The First Mate\u2019s Log (1940).\nOn his return to Oxford Collingwood lectured on moral and political\nphilosophy and worked at The New Leviathan (1942) which he\nsaw as his contribution to the war effort. He wrote the book against a\nbackground of increasingly debilitating strokes.\n\nR.G. Collingwood died in Coniston on 9 January 1943; he was nearly 54.\nHe is buried in Coniston churchyard in an unassuming grave between his\nparents and John Ruskin. He was succeeded in the Waynflete Chair by\nGilbert Ryle.\n",
