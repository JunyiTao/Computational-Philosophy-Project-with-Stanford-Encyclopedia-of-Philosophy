    "main_text": "\n\nWhile moral reasoning can be undertaken on another\u2019s behalf, it\nis paradigmatically an agent\u2019s first-personal (individual or\ncollective) practical reasoning about what, morally, they ought to do.\nPhilosophical examination of moral reasoning faces both distinctive\npuzzles \u2013 about how we recognize moral considerations and cope\nwith conflicts among them and about how they move us to act \u2013\nand distinctive opportunities for gleaning insight about what we ought\nto do from how we reason about what we ought to do. \n\nPart I of this article characterizes moral reasoning more fully,\nsituates it in relation both to first-order accounts of what morality\nrequires of us and to philosophical accounts of the metaphysics of\nmorality, and explains the interest of the topic. Part II then takes\nup a series of philosophical questions about moral reasoning, so\nunderstood and so situated. \n",
