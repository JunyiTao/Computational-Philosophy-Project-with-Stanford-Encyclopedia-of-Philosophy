    "main_text": "Some later work || Return of the reversibility objection\n5.2 Return of the reversibility objection\n\n\nThe first occasion on which Boltzmann returned to the reversibility\nobjection is in (1887b). This paper delves into a discussion between\nTait and Burbury about the approach to equilibrium for a system\nconsisting of gas particles of two different kinds. The details of the\ndebate need not concern us, except to note that Tait raised the\nreversibility objection to show that taking any evolution approaching\nequilibrium one may construct, by reversal of the velocities, another\nevolution moving away from equilibrium. At this point Boltzmann\nentered the discussion:\nI remark only that the objection of Mr. Tait regarding the\nreversal of the direction of all velocities, after the special state\n[i.e., equilibrium] has been reached, [\u2026] has already been\nrefuted in my [(1877a)]. If one starts with an arbitrary non-special\nstate, one will get [\u2026] the to special state (of course,\nperhaps after a very long time). When one reverses the directions of\nall velocities in this initial state, then, going backwards, one will\nnot (or perhaps only during some time) reach states that are even\nfurther removed from the special state; instead, in this case too, one\nwill eventually again reach the special state. (WA III,\n304)\n\n This reply to the reversibility objection uses an entirely different\nstrategy from his (1877a). Here, Boltzmann does not exclude the\nreversed motions on account of their vanishing probability, but rather\nargues that, sooner or later, they too will reach the equilibrium\nstate. \n\n\nNote how much Boltzmann's strategy has shifted: whereas previously the\nidea was that a gas system should approach equilibrium because of the\nH-theorem; Boltzmann's idea is now, apparently, that\nregardless of the behavior of \\(H\\) as a function of time,\nthere are independent reasons for assuming that the system approaches\nequilibrium. Boltzmann's contentions may of course very well be true.\nBut they do not follow from the H-theorem, or by ignoring its\nexceptions, and would have to be proven otherwise.\n",
