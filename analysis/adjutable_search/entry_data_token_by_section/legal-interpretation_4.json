    "main_text": "What Legal Interpretation Seeks || A Provision\u2019s Contribution to the Content of the Law\n2.3 A Provision\u2019s Contribution to the Content of the Law\nOn this position, theories of legal interpretation seek to discover how determinants of the content of the law, such as the ratification of the Constitution or the enactment of a bill, affect the content of the law. Increasingly, there is a perceptible trend toward recognizing this position.[11] On this approach, the linguistic meanings of legal texts are obviously a highly relevant factor, but theories of legal interpretation seek more than just the linguistic meaning of legal texts; they seek to ascertain the law. Theories of legal interpretation do not, however, purport to offer guidance on other issues, such as how to make discretionary decisions not controlled by legal standards or whether to follow the law.\nThe most important arguments in favor of this understanding of legal interpretation are the main arguments against the linguistic-meaning and dispute-resolution understandings. If legal interpretation is to resolve many disputes, and judges are in general bound to follow the law, then (assuming that there often are relevant legal standards) legal interpretation must at least yield the content of the law. On the other hand, theories of legal interpretation do not include components that would be necessary if they were theories of how to resolve disputes generally. Similarly, though the term \u201clegal interpretation\u201d is often used loosely and is sometimes used in a way that encompasses activities such as creating law interstitially, when the different activities necessary to resolve disputes are carefully distinguished, few would classify all of them as part of legal interpretation. For example, it would stretch the term beyond recognition to categorize deciding whether to refuse to follow the law as legal interpretation.\nMoreover, if we use the term \u201clegal interpretation\u201d for the entire process of resolving disputes, it will not pick out a theoretically unified subject. What is involved in, for example, ascertaining the content of the law is extremely different from what is involved in fashioning new legal standards, making discretionary decisions, and deciding whether to refuse to apply the law. Understanding legal interpretation as seeking a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law has the great advantage that it gives legal interpretation a theoretically unified subject matter.\nOne objection is that many of the arguments that courts and theorists make suggest that they are engaged in a broader enterprise than merely ascertaining the law (a point closely related to the argument, noted in section 3.2, that the typically eclectic approach to evaluating methods of legal interpretation favors the dispute-resolution understanding of legal interpretation). For example, Justice Scalia, the most prominent advocate of textualism, often argued that any other approach would leave judges less constrained and make them more likely to decide cases in accordance with their personal preferences (e.g., 1997, 17\u201318, 23). And early originalists, including Scalia and Robert Bork, used similar kinds of arguments to advocate originalism (Bork 1971, 7; Scalia, 1989, 862\u201363).\nIn the influential textualist and originalist movements, however, there has been a discernible trend away from arguments about restraining judges and toward arguments that textualism and originalism accurately identify the content of the law. Berman (2018, 1340\u201344) identifies this trend in originalist scholarship. (See also Whittington 2004, 608\u201309.) As Randy Barnett puts it, \u201cthe original meaning of the text provides the law that legal decision-makers are bound by\u201d (Barnett 2013, 417). See, e.g., Calabresi and Prakash 1994, 552; Bork, 1990, 5, 144. Similarly, textualists seem to be gravitating towards the idea that \u201cthe text is the law.\u201d Scalia 1997, 22; Scalia and Garner 2012, 383, 397\u201398; Easterbrook, 2017, 82. As Berman (2018, 1343 n. 60) points out, however, Scalia was not consistent in this regard. See Scalia and Garner 2012, xxviii\u2013xxix, 22, 364\u201366, 394\u201396.\nOn the other hand, as noted, prominent new originalists insist that the term \u201cconstitutional interpretation\u201d should be used for identifying the meaning of the constitutional text. As they officially draw the interpretation/construction distinction, however, it contains no stage at which a court ascertains the content of the law; when a court is not interpreting, it is engaged in constitutional construction, which is supposed to be a creative and political process of constructing meaning (Barnett 2013, 619; 1999, 645\u201346; Whittington 1999a, 7). See section 3. A charitable reading of the new originalists might therefore take them to assume that a provision\u2019s contribution is constituted by the meaning of the text or simply to equate a provision\u2019s contribution with \u201cthe meaning of the text.\u201d In that case, the new originalists may be understood, despite their rhetoric, as taking legal interpretation to seek a provision\u2019s contribution.[12] (In addition, as we will see in section 4.2, what the new originalists\u2019 take to be the meaning of the text \u2013 \u201cpublic meaning\u201d \u2013 is probably best understood as not a kind of linguistic meaning at all.)\nResistance to understanding legal interpretation as the search for a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law may be due in some quarters to a tacit assumption that there is no clear line between searching for a provision\u2019s contribution to the law and creating legal norms or finding ways of resolving disputes when there is no applicable first-order law. Although many lawyers and judges seem to be attracted to some version of this assumption, it\u2019s not entirely clear how to make sense of it. On the face of it, the factors and decisions relevant to ascertaining the content of the law are very different from those relevant to fashioning legal norms or to deciding how to resolve disputes not controlled by legal norms.\nOne possibility is that lawyers and judges have a tendency, encouraged by early 20th century movements like logical empiricism and American legal realism, to confuse uncertainty with indeterminacy. (See the entry on logical empiricism.) There is often uncertainty about how a provision contributes to the content of the law. Any interesting legal interpretation begins from such uncertainty. If one confuses such uncertainty with indeterminacy, then one will conclude that legal interpretation includes cases in which it is indeterminate how the relevant provisions contribute to the content of the law \u2013 and therefore that legal interpretation must not be limited to ascertaining the content of the law.\nA related point is that much legal interpretation seems to involve value judgments. If one assumes a metaphysics of law according to which the content of the law cannot depend on such value judgments \u2013 as some legal theorists do \u2013 then one will think that legal interpretation must not be merely a search for provisions\u2019 contributions to the law.\nThese issues cannot be pursued further here. The discussion in sections 3 and 4 of different substantive theories of legal interpretation will not assume a particular view of legal interpretation\u2019s constitutive aim. Section 5 develops the point that the plausibility of particular substantive theories, and the aptness of arguments for and against them, depends on legal interpretation\u2019s constitutive aim.\n",
