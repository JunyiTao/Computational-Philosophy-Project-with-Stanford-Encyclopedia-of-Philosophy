    "main_text": "Historical Background\n1. Historical Background\n\nIt is useful to begin with a brief historical background. Science and\nscientific thought have long functioned in Latin America as beacons of\ncivic hope and progress amidst multiple recurrent frustrations that\nvary in kind and texture from place to place. In most of the region,\nthe Enlightenment ideals that fueled independence movements of the\nearly nineteenth century were quickly disappointed by the chaos and\ngeneral barbarism that followed in much of the region until the 1860s.\nIt was different in Brazil, where emancipation from Europe occurred\ngradually and orderly during the century, but there too problems\ngrew as did also tensions between the economic elite and the\ncountry\u2019s leading liberal thinkers.\n\nReacting against expanding frustration, many Latin Americans saw a\nsolution in the \u201cscientific\u201d ways of thinking dominant in\nthe industrialized countries. In the 1850s a progressive philosophy\nwas in full flight in the larger world, ready-made for Latin American\nvisionaries: French Positivism, a doctrine of progress and secular\nreligion, centered on hope in modern science, led by Auguste Comte.\nCommitted to fighting the temptations of barbarism, the positivists\nsought to continue the project of the Enlightenment. Against the\nimpulsive approach to decision-making then prevailing in most of Latin\nAmerica, local positivists sought to extend scientific thought to\nphilosophy and political action, convinced it would promote\nobjectivity, rational consensus, publicly accessible cumulative truth\nin all spheres, along the material success characteristic of modern\nscience. Between about 1870 and 1910 positivism took strong hold in\nmuch of Latin America, with an agenda that called for methodological\nimprovement in the local practice of the natural sciences, medicine,\nand education, also greatly influencing activity in philosophy,\nhistory, art, and law (see, e.g., Frondizi 1943, Zea 1943\u201344,\nNachman 1977, Quintanilla 2006). In Argentina, scientism and\nComte\u2019s philosophy had influential defenders, notably Domingo\nFaustino Sarmiento, many scientists (e.g., paleontologist Florentino\nAmeghino), physician-philosophers (e.g., Jos\u00e9 Ingenieros and\nAlejandro Korn), educators (e.g., Pedro Scalabrini), and lawyers\n(e.g., Carlos Octavio Bunge, whose nephew Mario A. Bunge would become\nan international figure in philosophy of science in the following\ncentury). A conviction these thinkers shared stated that a modern and\nefficient system of public education was indispensable for achieving\nthe desired transformations. Interest in advancing the positivist approach\ngrew to religious heights especially in Brazil, where it was\nchampioned by distinguished political figures, notably Miguel de\nLemos, a reorganizer of the country\u2019s curriculum and a decisive\nforce in the construction of the first Humanity Temple for the\npropagation of Comte\u2019s ideas in the world. When Brazil became a\nrepublic in 1889, positivist doctrine made its way to the new flag,\nthe motto \u201cOrder and Progress\u201d lifted from Comte\u2019s\nwritings\u2014in Syst\u00e8me de Politique Positive\n(1851), the preliminary discourse\u2019s conclusion begins with the\nwords \u201cLove for principle, order for base, and progress for\naim\u201d (L\u2019amour pour principe, l\u2019ordre pour base, et le\nprogr\u00e8s pour but; p. 321).\n\nThe influence of positivism in Mexico was nearly as strong,\nparticularly in education, as exemplified by the labors of the\nrespected chemist and medical doctor Gabino Barreda, who banned\nreligion and traditional philosophy from the school curriculum and\ncentralized access to higher education and culture. In Chile, the\nbrothers Jorge and Enrique Lagarrigue were two leading advocates of\nComte\u2019s philosophy and his Humanity Religion. In Colombia, Rafael\nNu\u00f1ez, an educational reformer and three times president of\nColombia, actively promoted positivism, as did in Peru (with touches\nof Herbert Spencer\u2019s evolutionism) such figures as Javier Prado,\nManuel Gonz\u00e1lez Prada, Celso Bambar\u00e9n, and Manuel\nVicente Villar\u00e1n. In Bolivia, positivism also had influential\ndefenders from the 1870s through the 1890s, notably a circle of\nwriters, \u201cC\u00edrculo Literario\u201d, in whose\njournal works by Charles Darwin, Luis Dumont, Ernst H. P. A.  Haeckel\nand other naturalists appeared in translation.\n\nWith all this intellectual and progressive enthusiasm in the air,\nhopes of imminent general improvement ran high, but\n\u201cpositive\u201d results were slow in coming. The expectations\nof economic advancement and civic improvement did not materialize as\nadvertised. To compound matters, the devastation caused by the Great\nWar in Europe badly compromised social faith in the products of\nscience. Positivism waned accordingly in Latin America, replaced in\nthe 1920s by a more radical social thought, especially Marxism, as well\nas approaches distrustful of naturalist reasoning (Bergsonian\nspiritualism, phenomenology, and later existentialism). Metaphysics\nunbridled by standard logic became dominant in many university\ncircles.\n Reactions to excessively \u201chigh philosophy\u201d began to\narise in the 1940s, helped by the arrival of thinkers from Europe, for\nexample Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca in the cases of Ecuador,\nMexico, and Venezuela, Hans Lindemann in Argentina, and Gilles-Gaston\nGranger in Brazil. Along the way came a revival of interest in logic,\nscience-friendly epistemology, and the study of conceptual structures.\nThanks to these developments, when philosophy of science became a\nprofessional field in the late 1940s, Latin America had some\nscientists and philosophers ready and willing to fully join their\ncounterparts in Europe and North America. Since then, for the past\nseventy years, a number of philosophers of science based in Latin\nAmerica, often in uncooperative environments, have managed to produce\nwork of the highest international standards (something not so clearly\napparent in the developing world in other branches of international\nphilosophy).\n\nBy the mid 1990s, academic centers in Latin America began to benefit\nfrom the kind of world-wide interaction made possible by the Internet,\nelectronic libraries, and improved forms of institutional support for\nintegration and travel. With geographical and institutional barriers\ngreatly reduced, the field expanded considerably. Over the last\nthree decades virtually every theme in philosophy of science would\ndevelop a presence in works produced in Latin America. Dialogue and\ncollaboration between researchers now transcend the traditional local\nboundaries. This new global environment makes less relevant the\ntraditional geographical approach to philosophical production in the\nregion. Accordingly, Sections 3 and 4, devoted to activity from the\nmid 1990s on, structure the subject around themes, concepts, and\nprinciples (rather than around geography and individuals).\n",
