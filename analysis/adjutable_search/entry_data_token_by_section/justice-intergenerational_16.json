First, the non-identity-problem does not arise with\nrespect to surviving victims of wrongs. The harm done to surviving\nvictims can be understood in accordance with the common understanding\nof harm: the past wrongdoing caused these people to be worse off than\nthey would have been in the absence of that act or policy. These\nindividuals would be fully compensated for the harm done to them where\nit the case that as a result of compensation undertaken they are as\nwell off as they would be if the policy had not been carried out.\n\nSecond, consider the case of people having been wrongfully expelled\nfrom their homeland and not having received compensation for the\nwrongs inflicted upon them. For their descendants it might well be\ntrue that they would not exist had their parents and (great-)\ngrandparents not been expelled. However, the descendants can be said\nto be victims of the additional wrong that their parents did not\nreceive compensation for the wrongs inflicted upon them. The\nindividual descendants can be said to have been harmed from conception\nor birth because of the lack of sufficient compensation to their\nparents (Sher 2005; and see Butt 2006, Cohen 2009, and Herstein 2008).\nAgain, the harm done to them can be understood in accordance with the\ncommon understanding of harm: If those entities which stand under the\nobligation to provide compensation to the first generation of\ndisplaced persons do not (entirely) fulfill their obligations, they\nthereby harm the descendants of the first generation of displaced\npeople by making those descendants worse off than they would otherwise\nbe\u2014that is, if (sufficient) compensation had been provided by\nthe first generation. This line of argument can be extended to the\nsecond, third, fourth etc. generation: generation X of\ndisplaced people would be fully compensated for the harm done to them\nwere it the case that as a result of compensation undertaken the\npeople of generation X are as well off as the people of this\ngeneration would be if the first generation of displaced people had\nreceived the compensation they were entitled to. While it is clear\nthat thus understood the later generations\u2019 claims to\ncompensation do not have to contend with the non-identity-problem\n(Sher 2005), what is owed to them will depend on how best to\nunderstand the counterfactual relevant to determine the amount of\ncompensation owed.\n\nHow best to understand the relevant counterfactual is an intricate\nproblem (cf. Sher 1979, 1981). Let us take note of two issues. First,\nthe legitimacy of people\u2019s claims to compensation arguably can\ndepend upon their actions (and inactions) and the impact these have on\ntheir well-being. Of course, these actions (and inactions) can\nnormatively be attributed to people only insofar as they make the\ndecision to act (or not act) under certain conditions, for example,\nspecified in terms of rational and autonomous agency. If so, then the\nstrength of later generations\u2019 claim to compensation\u2014owing\nto the failure of providing sufficient compensation to the first\ngeneration that suffered the initial harm\u2014may wane over time.\nThe more the descendants\u2019 well-being can be attributed to\nactions or inactions for which they themselves or members of the\nintermediate generations are responsible, the less the hypothetical\nstate of affairs that would obtain had the direct victims received\nadequate compensation is relevant for the determination of the claims\nof the indirect victims (assuming we could know what that state would\nbe) (Sher 1981). This insight is likely to be of little practical\nsignificance for the claims to compensation of the first couple of\ngenerations of descendants for the direct victims. The harm done to\ntheir ancestors is not ancient. Thus, the descendants\u2019 claim to\ncompensation\u2014based on the harm inflicted on them due to the\nfailure of providing adequate compensation for the initial\nharm\u2014is likely to be strong.\n\nSecond, the claims to compensation may be thought to increase over\ntime. Historical injustices may well have resulted in ongoing\nsystemically unequal distributions of life chances due to the\ninheritance of the benefits stemming from historical injustices on the\nside of the descendants of the perpetrators (see Butt 2013). These\ndifferences can be considered relevant for how much compensation is\nowed to currently living indirect victims.\n",
