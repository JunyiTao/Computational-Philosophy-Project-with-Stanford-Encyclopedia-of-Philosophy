Developments in the Philosophy of Neuroscience\n\nThe distinction between \u201cphilosophy of neuroscience\u201d and\n\u201cneurophilosophy\u201d came to be better clarified over the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century, due primarily to more\nquestions being pursued in both areas. Philosophy of neuroscience\nstill tends to pose traditional questions from philosophy of science\nspecifically about neuroscience. Such questions include: What is the\nnature of neuroscientific explanation? And, what is the nature of\ndiscovery in neuroscience? Answers to these questions are pursued\neither descriptively (how does neuroscience proceed?) or normatively\n(how should neuroscience proceed)? Some normative projects in\nphilosophy of neuroscience are \u201cdeconstructive\u201d,\ncriticizing claims about the topic made by neuroscientists. For\nexample, philosophers of neuroscience have criticized the conception\nof personhood assumed by researchers in cognitive neuroscience (cf.\nRoskies 2009). Other normative projects are constructive, proposing\nnew theories of neuronal phenomena or methods for interpreting\nneuroscientific data. Such projects often integrate smoothly with\ntheoretical neuroscience itself. For example, Chris Eliasmith and\nCharles Anderson developed an approach to constructing\nneurocomputational models in their book Neural Engineering\n(2003). In separate publications, Eliasmith has argued that the\nframework introduced in Neural Engineering provides both a\nnormative account of neural representation and a framework for\nunifying explanation in neuroscience (e.g., Eliasmith 2009).\n\nNeurophilosophy continued to apply findings from the neurosciences to\ntraditional, philosophical questions. Examples include: What is an\nemotion? (Prinz 2004) What is the nature of desire? (Schroeder 2004)\nHow is social cognition made possible? (Goldman 2006) What is the neural basis of\nmoral cognition? (Prinz 2007) What is the neural basis of happiness?\n(Flanagan 2009) Neurophilosophical answers to these questions are\nconstrained by what neuroscience reveals about nervous systems. For\nexample, in his book Three Faces of Desire, Timothy Schroeder\n(2004) argued that our commonsense conception of desire attributes to\nit three capacities: (1) the capacity to reinforce behavior when\nsatisfied, (2) the capacity to motivate behavior, and (3) the capacity\nto determine sources of pleasure. Based on evidence from the\nliterature on dopamine function and reinforcement learning theory,\nSchroeder argued that reward processing is the basis for all three\ncapacities. Thus, reward is the essence of desire.\n\nDuring the first decade of the twenty-first century a trend arose in\nneurophilosophy to look toward neuroscience for guidance in moral\nphilosophy. That should be evident from the themes we\u2019ve just\nmentioned. Simultaneously, there was renewed interest in moralizing\nabout neuroscience and neurological treatments (see Levy 2007; Roskies\n2009). This new field, neuroethics, thus combined both\ninterest in the relevance of neuroscience data for understanding moral\ncognition, and the relevance of moral philosophy for acquiring and\nregulating the application of knowledge from neuroscience. The\nregulatory branch of neuroethics initially focused explicitly on the\nethics of treatment for people who suffer from neurological\nimpairments, the ethics of attempts to enhance human cognitive\nperformance (Schneider 2009), the ethics of applying \u201cmind\nreading\u201d technology to problems in forensic science (Farah and\nWolpe 2004), and the ethics of animal experimentation in neuroscience\n(Farah 2008). More recently both of these fields of neuroethics has\nseen tremendous growth. The interested reader should consult the\n neuroethics entry\n in this Encyclopedia.\n\nTrends during the first decade of the twenty-first century in\nphilosophy of neuroscience included renewed interest in the nature of\nmechanistic explanations. This was in keeping with a general trend in\nphilosophy of science (e.g., Machamer, Darden, and Craver 2000). The\napplication of this general approach to neuroscience isn\u2019t\nsurprising. \u201cMechanism\u201d is a widely-used term among\nneuroscientists. In his book, Explaining the Brain (2007),\nCarl Craver contended that mechanistic explanations in neuroscience\nare causal explanations, and typically multi-level. For example, the\nexplanation of the neuronal action potential involves the action\npotential itself, the cell in which it occurs, electro-chemical\ngradients, and the proteins through which ions flow across the\nmembrane. Thus we have a composite entity (a cell) causally\ninteracting with neurotransmitters at its receptors. Parts of the cell\nengage in various activities, e.g., the opening and closing of\nligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels, to produce a pattern of\nchanges, the depolarizing current constituting the action potential. A\nmechanistic explanation of the action potential thus countenances\nentities at the cellular, molecular, and atomic levels, all of which\nare causally relevant to producing the action potential. This causal\nrelevance can be confirmed by altering any one of these variables,\ne.g., the density of ion channels in the cell membrane, to generate\nalterations in the action potential; and by verifying the consistency\nof the purported invariance between the variables. For challenges to\nCraver\u2019s account of mechanistic explanation in neuroscience,\nspecifically concerning the action potential, see Weber 2008, and\nBogen 2005.\n\nAccording to epistemic norms shared implicitly by neuroscientists,\ngood explanations in neuroscience are good mechanistic explanations;\nand good mechanistic explanations are those that pick out invariant\nrelationships between mechanisms and the phenomena they control. (For\nfuller treatment of invariance in causal explanations throughout\nscience, see James Woodward 2003. Mechanists draw extensively on\nWoodward\u2019s \u201cinterventionist\u201d account of cause and\ncausal explanations.) Craver\u2019s account raised questions about\nthe place of reduction in neuroscience. John Bickle (2003) suggested\nthat the working concept of reduction in the neurosciences consists of\nthe discovery of systematic relationships between interventions at\nlower levels of biological organization, as these are pursued in\ncellular and molecular neuroscience, and higher level behavioral\neffects, as they are described in psychology. Bickle called this\nperspective \u201creductionism-in-practice\u201d to contrast it with\nthe concepts of intertheoretic or metaphysical reduction that have\nbeen the focus of many debates in the philosophy of science and\nphilosophy of mind. Despite Bickle\u2019s reformulation of reduction,\nhowever, mechanists generally resist, or at least relativize, the\n\u201creductionist\u201d label. Craver (2007) calls his view the\n\u201cmosaic unity\u201d of neuroscience. Bechtel (2009) calls his\n\u201cmechanistic reduction(ism)\u201d. Both Craver and Bechtel\nadvocate multi-leveled \u201cmechanisms-within-mechanisms\u201d,\nwith no level of mechanism epistemically privileged. This is in\ncontrast to reduction(ism), ruthless or otherwise which privileges\nlower levels. Still we can ask: Is mechanism a kind of\nreductionism-in-practice? Or does mechanism, as a position on\nneuroscientific explanation, assume some type of autonomy for\npsychology? If it assumes autonomy, reductionists might challenge\nmechanists on this assumption. On the other hand, Bickle\u2019s\nreductionism-in-practice clearly departs from inter-theoretic\nreduction, as the latter is understood in philosophy of science. As\nBickle himself acknowledges, his latest reductionism was inspired\nheavily by mechanists\u2019 criticisms of his earlier \u201cnew\nwave\u201d account. Mechanists can challenge Bickle that his\ndeparture from the traditional accounts has also led to a departure\nfrom the interests that motivated those accounts. (See Polger 2004 for\na related challenge.) As we will see in\n section 8 below,\n these issues surrounding mechanistic philosophy of neuroscience have\ngrown more urgent, as mechanism has grown to dominate the field.\n\nThe role of temporal representation in conscious experience and the\nkinds of neural architectures sufficient to represent objects in time\ngenerated interest. In the tradition of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology,\nDan Lloyd (2002, 2003) and Rick Grush (2001, 2009) have separately\ndrawn attention to the tripartite temporal structure of phenomenal\nconsciousness as an explanandum for neuroscience. This structure\nconsists of a subjective present, an immediate past, and an\nexpectation of the immediate future. For example, one\u2019s\nconscious awareness of a tune is not just of a time-slice of\ntune-impression, but of a note that a moment ago was present, another\nthat is now present, and an expectation of subsequent notes in the\nimmediate future. As this experience continues, what was a moment ago\ntemporally immediate is now retained as a moment in the immediate\npast; what was expected either occurred or didn\u2019t in what has\nnow become the experienced present; and a new expectation has formed\nof what will come. One\u2019s experience is not static, even though\nthe experience is of a single object (the tune). These earlier works\nfound increased relevance with the rise of \u201cpredictive\ncoding\u201d models of whole brain function, developed by\nneuroscientists including Karl Friston (2009) less than a decade\nlater, and brought to broader philosophical attention by Jakob Hohwy\n(2013) and Andy Clark (2016). \n\nAccording to Lloyd, the tripartite structure of consciousness raises a\nunique problem for analyzing fMRI data and designing experiments. The\nproblem stems from the tension between the sameness in the object of\nexperience (e.g., the same tune through its progression) and the\ntemporal fluidity of experience itself (e.g., the transitions between\nheard notes). At the time Lloyd was writing, one standard means of\nanalyzing fMRI data consisted in averaging several data sets and\nsubtracting an estimate of baseline activation from the composites.\n [17]\n This is done to filter noise from the task-related hemodynamic\nresponse. But as Lloyd points out, this then-common practice ignores\nmuch of the data necessary for studying the neural correlates of\nconsciousness. It produces static images that neglect the\nrelationships between data points over the time course. Lloyd instead\napplies a multivariate approach to studying fMRI data, under the\nassumption that a recurrent network architecture underlies the\ntemporal processing that gives rise to experienced time. A simple\nrecurrent network has an input layer, an output layer, a hidden layer,\nand an additional layer that copies the prior activation state of\neither the hidden layer or the output layer. Allowing the output layer\nto represent a predicted outcome, the input layer can then represent a\ncurrent state and the additional layer a prior state. This assignment\nmimics the tripartite temporal structure of experience in a network\narchitecture. If the neuronal mechanisms underlying conscious\nexperience are approximated by recurrent network architecture, one\nprediction is that current neuronal states carry information about\nimmediate future and prior states. Applied to fMRI, the model predicts\nthat time points in an image series will carry information about prior\nand subsequent time points. The results of Lloyd\u2019s (2002)\nanalysis of 21 subjects\u2019 data sets, sampled from the publicly\naccessible National fMRI Data Center, support this prediction.\n\nGrush\u2019s (2001, 2004) interest in temporal representation is part\nof his broader systematic project of addressing a semantic problem for\ncomputational neuroscience, namely: how do we demarcate study of the\nbrain as an information processor from the study of any other complex\ncausal process? This question leads back into the familiar territory\nof psychosemantics (see\n section 3 above),\n but now the starting point is internal to the practices of\ncomputational neuroscience. The semantic problem is thereby rendered\nan issue in philosophy of neuroscience, insofar as it asks: what does\n(or should) \u201ccomputation\u201d mean in computational\nneuroscience?\n\nGrush\u2019s solution drew on concepts from modern control theory. In\naddition to a controller, a sensor, and a goal state, certain kinds of\ncontrol systems employ a process model of the actual process\nbeing controlled. A process model can facilitate a variety of\nengineering functions, including overcoming delays in feedback and\nfiltering noise. The accuracy of a process model can be assessed\nrelative to its \u201cplug-compatibility\u201d with the actual\nprocess. Plug-compatibility is a measure of the degree to which a\ncontroller can causally couple to a process model to produce the same\nresults it would produce by coupling with the actual process. Note\nthat plug-compatibility is not an information relation.\n\nTo illustrate a potential neuroscientific implementation, Grush\nconsiders a controller as some portion of the brain\u2019s motor\nsystems (e.g., premotor cortex). The sensors are the sense organs\n(e.g., stretch receptors on the muscles). A process model of the\nmusculoskeletal system might exist in the cerebellum (see Kawato\n1999). If the controller portion of the motor system sends spike\ntrains to the cerebellum in the same way that it sends spikes to the\nmusculoskeletal system, and if in return the cerebellum receives spike\ntrains similar to real peripheral feedback, then the cerebellum\nemulates the musculoskeletal system (to the degree that the mock\nfeedback resembles real peripheral feedback). The proposed unit over\nwhich computational operations range is the neuronal realization of a\nprocess model and its components, or in Grush\u2019s terms an\n\u201cemulator\u201d and its \u201carticulants\u201d.\n\nThe details of Grush\u2019s framework are too sophisticated to\npresent in short compass. (For example, he introduces a host of\nconceptual devices to discuss the representation of external objects.)\nBut in a nutshell, he contends that understanding temporal\nrepresentation begins with understanding the emulation of the timing\nof sensorimotor contingencies. Successful sequential behavior (e.g.,\nspearing a fish) depends not just on keeping track of where one is in\nspace, but where one is in a temporal order of movements and the\ntemporal distance between the current, prior, and subsequent\nmovements. Executing a subsequent movement can depend on keeping track\nof whether a prior movement was successful and whether the current\nmovement is matching previous expectations. Grush posits\nemulators\u2014process models in the central nervous\nsystem\u2014that anticipate, retain, and update mock sensorimotor\nfeedback by timing their output proportionally to feedback from an\nactual process (Grush 2005).\n\nLloyd\u2019s and Grush\u2019s approaches to studying temporal\nrepresentation are varied in their emphases. But they are unified in\ntheir implicit commitment to localizing cognitive functions and\ndecomposing them into subfunctions using both top-down and bottom-up\nconstraints. (See Bechtel and Richardson 1993 for more details on this\ngeneral explanatory strategy.) As we mentioned a few paragraphs above,\nboth anticipated in important and interesting ways more recent\nneuroscientific and philosophical work on predictive coding and the\nbrain. Both developed mechanistic explanations that pay little regard\nto disciplinary boundaries. One of the principal lessons of\nBickle\u2019s and Craver\u2019s work is that neuroscientific\npractice in general is structured in this fashion. The ontological\nconsequences of adopting this approach continue to be debated.\n",
