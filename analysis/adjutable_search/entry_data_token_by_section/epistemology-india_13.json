    "main_text": "Analogy and Other Candidate Sources || Gesture and Rumor\n8. \u201cSuppositional Reasoning\u201d (tarka)\n\nMany classical Indian philosophers held that apparent certification\nmay not be enough to warrant belief in some instances. Even if our\nbeliefs/cognitions have indeed been generated by processes that would\nbe counted knowledge sources did they not face counterconsiderations,\nin facing counterconsiderations\u2014in being reasonably\nchallenged\u2014they are not trustworthy and do not guide\nunhesitating effort and action.  There is a social dimension to\nknowledge, where reasoning reigns resolving controversy in ways over\nand above the sources. These are the ways of tarka,\n\u201chypothetical\u201d or \u201csuppositional reasoning.\u201d\nParadigmatically, tarka is called for in order to establish a\npresumption of truth in favor of one thesis that has putative source\nsupport against a rival thesis that also has putative source support,\na thesis and a counterthesis both backed up by, for example,\napparently genuine inferences (the most common situation) or by\ncompeting perceptual or testimonial evidence. By supposing the truth\nof the rival thesis and (in Socratic style) showing how it leads to\nunacceptable consequences or breaks another intellectual norm, one\nrepossesses a presumption of truth, provided\u2014the classical\nepistemologists never tire of emphasizing\u2014provided one\u2019s own\nthesis does indeed have at least the appearance of a knowledge source\nin its corner. The consensus across schools is that such arguments are\nnot in themselves knowledge-generators, but they can swing the balance\nconcerning what it is rational to believe.\n\nSuppositional reasoning is what a philosopher is good at, drawing out\nof implications of opposed views and testing them against mutually\naccepted positions, according to, broadly speaking, criteria of\ncoherence but also of simplicity. Here we come to the vital center of\nthe life of a classical philosopher, which is reflected in honorific\nappellations and book titles, dozens of which use \u2018tarka\u2019 as\nin \u201cCrest Jewel of Reasoning\u201d\n(tarka-\u015biro-ma\u1e47i).\n\nUdayana (Ny\u0101ya, eleventh century) appears to inherit a sixfold\ndivision of tarka according to the nature of the error in an\nopponent\u2019s position, and expressly lists five types (a sixth,\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d or \u201copposition,\u201d either being\nassumed as the most common variety, or subsumed under Udayana\u2019s fifth\ntype, \u201cunwanted consequence\u201d). Philosophers from other\nschools present distinct but overlapping lists. The Ny\u0101ya\ntextbook-writer, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha, of the early seventeenth\ncentury, mentions ten, Udayana\u2019s five plus five more, many of which\nare used by the Advaitin \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a (probably\nUdayana\u2019s younger contemporary) among other reasoners. They are: (1)\nself-dependence (begging the question), (2) mutual dependence (mutual\npresupposition), (3) circularity (reasoning in a circle), (4) infinite\nregress, and (5) unwanted consequence (including contradiction\npresumably)\u2014Udayana\u2019s five\u2014plus (6) being presupposed by\nthe other, the first established (a form of \u201cfavorable\u201d\nsuppositional reasoning), (7) (hasty) generalization, (8)\ndifferentiation failure, (9) theoretic lightness, and (10) theoretic\nheaviness.\n\nIt is tarka that establishes a presumption against\nskepticism.  Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (fourteenth century): \u201cWere a\nperson P, who has ascertained thoroughgoing positive\ncorrelations (F wherever G) and negative correlations\n(wherever no G, no F), to doubt that an effect might\narise without a cause, then\u2014to take up the example of smoke and\nfire\u2014why should P, as he does, resort to fire for smoke (in the\ncase, say, of a desire to get rid of mosquitoes)?  (Similarly) to food\nto allay hunger, and to speech to communicate to another\nperson?\u201d (Translation from Phillips 1995: 160\u2013161, slightly\nmodified.) The argument, which is found in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra and other works (e.g.,\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, preamble to\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.1), is that without the\nconfidence that presupposes knowledge, we would not act as we do.\n",
