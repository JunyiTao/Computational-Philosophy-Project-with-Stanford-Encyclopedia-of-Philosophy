Sequent Calculus: later developments/applications\n\n\nGentzen's doctoral thesis marked the birth of structural proof \ntheory, as contrasted to the old axiomatic proof theory of Hilbert. A\nremarkable step ahead in the development of systems of sequent \ncalculus was taken by Oiva Ketonen in his doctoral thesis of 1944. \nKetonen, a student of mathematics and philosophy in Helsinki, went to\nG\u00f6ttingen in 1938 to study proof theory with Gentzen\u2014being the closest to a student the latter ever had. The connection \nseems to have been established by Ketonen's philosophy professor Eino\nKaila who had met Gentzen in 1936 in M\u00fcnster. Ketonen \nrecollected later that Gentzen was \u201ca sympathetic young man of \nfew words\u201d who gave him an introduction to the \nproof-theoretical systems and results. Ketonen's best-known discovery\nis a sequent calculus for classical propositional logic the logical \nrules of which are all invertible, meaning that whenever a sequent is\nof a form that matches the conclusion of a logical rule, the \ncorresponding premisses, defined uniquely from the given sequent and \nthe rule, are also derivable. The reverse is immediate (just apply \nthe rule). Rules L& and L\u2283, for example, are modified into\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n \u00a0L&\n\n\nA & B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\n \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, A \u00a0 B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n \u00a0L\u2283\n\n\nA \u2283 B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is just one left rule for conjunction (and dually just one \nright rule for disjunction). The left implication rule has what are \ncalled \u201cshared contexts\u201d: the assumptions and cases in \nthe conclusion, except for the formula with the connective, are \nrepeated identically in both premisses. Ketonen's idea was to define \na system of proof search: one starts from a given sequent to be \nderived, chooses a formula in it, and writes the premisses of a rule \nthat can conclude the given sequent. By invertibility, the question \nof derivability is replaced by one or two equivalent questions of \nderivability on simpler sequents. The new rules are needed to ensure \nuniquely defined premisses in such \u201croot-first\u201d \ndecomposition.\n\n\nKetonen's proof of invertibility of the logical rules of his sequent \ncalculus used the structural rule of cut. Later Kurt Sch\u00fctte \n(1950) and Haskell Curry (1963) gave direct proofs of invertibility, \nthe latter with the explicit result that the inversions are height\npreserving: if a given sequent is derivable in at most n\nsteps, the premisses in a rule that can conclude that sequent also \nhave a derivation in at most n steps.\n\n\nHow much of Ketonen's work stems from suggestions on the part of \nGentzen remains unknown, because no correspondence has been found. \nKetonen writes in the preface of his thesis that \u201cDr. G. \nGentzen of G\u00f6ttingen directed me towards the problem area of \nthis work\u201d. The thesis was Ketonen's only original work in \nlogic, saved from oblivion by a long review that Bernays wrote of it \nfor The Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1945.\n\n\nOne person who knew Ketonen's calculus in the late 1940s was Evert \nBeth. When Beth later, in 1955, presented his well-known tableau \ncalculus, he seems to have forgotten the origin of the tableau \ncalculus as a reformulation of the one of Ketonen, but refers instead\nto Kleene's influential Introduction to Metamathematics of \n1952. Kleene had taken up Ketonen's calculus from the Bernays' review \nand also treated intuitionistic sequent calculus in which \ninvertibility is more restricted than in the classical calculus. With\nKleene's book, Gentzen's sequent calculi became generally known and \naccessible.\n\n\nKleene's work of the early 1950s also pioneered a remarkable \ndevelopment in sequent calculus, namely the \n\u201ccontraction-free\u201d classical and intuitionistic calculi \ntoday denoted by G3c and G3i. These calculi have the \nproperty that none of Gentzen's original \u201cstructural \nrules\u201d are needed. The rule of \u201cweakening\u201d permits \nthe addition of superfluous cases and assumptions, and the rule of \n\u201ccontraction\u201d the deletion of one copy of a formula if \ntwo were present in a list, as in\n\n\n\n\nWeakening\n\n\n\nContraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n \u00a0Wk\n\n\nA, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\nA, A, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n  \u00a0Ctr\n\n\nA, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalogous rules permit weakening and contraction in the right, \nsuccedent parts of sequents. Weakening is made an eliminable rule by \nletting initial sequents have the form \nA, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394,\nA  instead of Gentzen's \nA \u2192 A. Contraction is likewise made \neliminable by a suitable formulation of the rules. The import is that\nin root-first proof search, no rules need be applied that would \nproduce a duplication of a formula in a premiss. Without this result,\nnon-termination of proof search would not follow.\n\n\nThe classical calculus has the property, mentioned above, of \nheight-preserving invertibility of its logical rules. Albert Dragalin\nrefined in the late 1970s the calculus into one in which the \nstructural rules are moreover \u201cheight-preserving \nadmissible\u201d, meaning that whenever the premiss of such a rule \nis derivable, the conclusion is derivable without the rule and with \nat most the same size (maximum number of rule instances in a \nderivation branch) of derivation. This property has profound effects \non cut elimination: in permuting cut up, Gentzen had to restore the \noriginal contexts (the \u0393's and \u0394's) through weakenings \nand contractions. With the height-preserving admissibility of these \nrules, the size of a derivation does not increase when the rules are \napplied. Dragalin gave also an intuitionistic multisuccedent calculus\nwith the same type of admissibility of the structural rules. \nTroelstra, finally, gave in the textbook Basic Proof Theory \n(2000, first ed. 1996) a single-succedent intuitionistic calculus \nwith height-preserving admissibility of weakening and contraction. \nThe contraction-free sequent calculi are powerful tools for the \nanalysis of formal derivations. Many difficult research results in \nlogic become just exercises through the control over the structure of\nproofs that the G3-calculi permit.\n\n\nThe earliest application of sequent calculus in mathematics was in \nthe proof theory of arithmetic, in Gentzen's thesis and in a decisive\nway in the 1938 proof of the consistency of arithmetic. Troelstra \nmentions Ketonen's work as \n\n\nan early analysis of cutfree proofs\nin Gentzen calculi with axioms; but he considers the form of cutfree \nderivations in the pure calculus where axioms are present in the \nantecedent of the sequents derived. (Troelstra and \nSchwichtenberg 2000: 142)\n\n\n The axioms that Ketonen considers are \nthose of projective and affine geometry, the former taken from \nSkolem's 1920 paper discussed in the first section above. Ketonen \nwanted to formulate Skolem's formal rules of proof within sequent \ncalculus. However, Ketonen's work was mostly known only through its \nreview by Bernays and only the logical part on sequent calculus was \nexplained in detail there.\n\n\nA second way to apply the sequent calculus is to let sequents that\nbegin derivation branches have, in addition to initial sequents, also\nthe form \u2192 A,\nin which A is an axiom, or an instance of a universal\naxiom. Now, by Gentzen's \u201cextended Hauptsatz\u201d, cuts in\nderivations can be permuted up until one of their premisses is an\naxiom, but these cuts on axioms remain. Another, newer method is to\nconvert axioms into extra rules that are added to the logical rules of\nsequent calculus, with full cut elimination maintained (as explained\nin Negri and von Plato 2001, chapter 6, and in Troelstra and\nSchwichtenberg's 2000, chapter 4.7).\n",
