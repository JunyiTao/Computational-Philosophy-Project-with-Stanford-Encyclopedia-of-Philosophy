    "main_text": "\n\n\nEmbodied Cognition is a wide-ranging research program drawing from\nand inspiring work in psychology, neuroscience, ethology, philosophy,\nlinguistics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Whereas traditional\ncognitive science also encompasses these disciplines, it finds common\npurpose in a conception of mind wedded to computationalism: mental\nprocesses are computational processes; the brain, qua\ncomputer, is the seat of cognition. In contrast, embodied cognition\nvariously rejects or reformulates the computational commitments of\ncognitive science, emphasizing the significance of an agent\u2019s\nphysical body in cognitive abilities. Unifying investigators of\nembodied cognition is the idea that the body or the body\u2019s\ninteractions with the environment constitute or contribute to cognition\nin ways that require a new framework for its investigation. Mental\nprocesses are not, or not only, computational processes. The brain is\nnot a computer, or not the seat of cognition.\n\n\nOnce a fringe movement, embodied cognition now enjoys a fair amount of\nprominence. Unlike, say, ecological psychology, which has faced an\nuphill battle for mainstream acceptance, embodied cognition has gained\na substantial following. The appointment of researchers who take an\nembodied perspective to cognition would, today, raise few eyebrows.\nEmbodied cognition has been the subject of numerous articles in\npopular outlets. Moreover, there is not an area of cognitive\nscience\u2014perception, language, learning, memory, categorization,\nproblem solving, emotion, social cognition\u2014that has not received\nan embodied \u201cmake-over.\u201d\n\n\nNone of this is to say, of course, that embodied cognition does not\nface hard questions, or has escaped harsh criticism. The numerous and\nsometimes incompatible claims it makes about the body\u2019s role in\ncognition and the myriad methods it employs for understanding this role\nmake it ripe for philosophical reflection. Critics charge embodied\ncognition with embracing a depleted conception of cognition, or with\nnot offering a genuine replacement to computational cognitive science,\nor with claiming that bodies play a constitutive role in cognition when\nin fact their role is merely causal. Proponents have responded to all\nof these objections. A welcome byproduct of these debates is a new\nperspective on some old philosophical questions concerning what minds\nare, what concepts are, and how to understand the nature and\nsignificance of representation.\n",
