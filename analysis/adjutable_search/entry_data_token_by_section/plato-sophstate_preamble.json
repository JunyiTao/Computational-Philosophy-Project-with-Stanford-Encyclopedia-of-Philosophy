    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman are late Platonic \ndialogues, whose relative dates are established by their stylistic \nsimilarity to the Laws, a work that was apparently still \n\u201con the wax\u201d at the time of Plato\u2019s death (Diogenes \nLaertius 3.37). These dialogues are important in exhibiting Plato\u2019s\nviews on method and metaphysics after he criticized his own most \nfamous contribution to the history of philosophy, the theory of \nseparate, immaterial forms in the Parmenides. The \nStatesman also offers a transitional statement of Plato\u2019s \npolitical philosophy between the Republic and the \nLaws. The Sophist and Statesman show the \nauthor\u2019s increasing interest in mundane and practical knowledge. In \nthis respect they seem more down-to-earth and Aristotelian in tone \nthan dialogues dated to Plato\u2019s middle period such as the \nPhaedo and the Republic. This entry will focus on \nmethod and metaphysics.\n",
