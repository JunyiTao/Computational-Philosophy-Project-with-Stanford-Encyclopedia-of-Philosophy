    "main_text": "Philosophy and the Galenic Corpus || Corpus and Curriculum\n2.2 Corpus and Curriculum\nThe role of philosophy in Galen will be better understood through a consideration of the order of his own books which the author suggests to the aspiring doctor, a sort of ideal curriculum of study which at the same time implies an \u201corder of knowledge\u201d, a conceptual relationship between different intellectual areas, and is set out especially in My Own Books (Lib. Prop.) and The Order of My Own Books (Ord. Lib. Prop.); see Singer 2019b.\nFirst comes demonstration. Knowledge of demonstration is necessary for reliable scientific knowledge and for the discernment of fallacious arguments. But it is noteworthy that Galen envisages two possible pathways for this first phase of the curriculum (Ord. Lib. Prop. 1\u20132). For one who aspires to true knowledge, a thorough grounding in Galen\u2019s logical magnum opus, Demonstration, is essential. But there is a more practical compromise: the less logically ambitious or adept may\u2014taking as his starting-point the \u201cintroductory\u201d methodological work, Sects for Beginners (SI)\u2014proceed to the next stage without that thorough grounding. Some logical training is envisaged here too; but Galen is optimistic about the ability of the non-philosophical layperson to arrive at the truth on the basis of common conceptions and a basic ability to follow arguments (such ability being contrasted with the tendency of sectarian philosophers to create or succumb to sophistic fallacies); key here is that the person in question should have acquired a solid education in the traditional Greek \u201cfundamentals\u201d, which involved mathematics and logic (Aff. Pecc. Dig. II.3; Lib. Prop. preface). But this latter person will\u2014following a Platonic distinction\u2014only be able to aspire to correct opinion, not to secure knowledge.\nThe next stage is represented by anatomy, which is in turn followed by the study of the function (chreia), capacities (dunameis) and activities of the parts which anatomy reveals. Capacities both \u201cof nature\u201d (phusikai) and \u201cof the soul\u201d (psuchikai) are considered here: the important work Natural Capacities (Nat. Fac.) is especially relevant to the former, PHP and The Motion of Muscles (Mot. Musc.) to the latter; study of UP should follow here too.\nGalen then proceeds\u2014under the heading \u201cnecessary to read before the The Method of Healing\u201d\u2014to take a new starting-point, in physical theory. Study of the fundamental elements of the cosmos and biological world, discussed in Elements according to Hippocrates (Hipp. Elem.), should be followed by their study in the specifically animal, and human, context, in Mixtures (Temp.)\u2014a major and very influential work of Galenic theory. From this point there is again a dual pathway: the third book of Temp., with its discussion of the nature of change brought about by drugs, may lead into specialist pharmacological study; alternatively, the latter may be bypassed in favour of a series of works on health and disease in the human body, which in turn lead into works on clinical practice, and on diagnostic and prognostic procedures.\nGalen thus envisages an intellectual progression from the study of the abstract and fundamental to the particular and individual, and recommends that, at least ideally, a secure knowledge of demonstration should underlie the whole paedagogic procedure. In clinical and diagnostic/prognostic contexts, however, knowledge will be stochastic and \u201cfor the most part\u201d, not secure and certain as in the context of the propositions provided by demonstrations.\nThere are then also works and areas of enquiry which stand outside this curriculum, and which Galen lists under separate headings. Such, in particular, are the works of ethics; Galen lists more than 25, of which only two (Aff. Pecc. Dig. and Ind.) survive in full, although PHP also contains much relevant material. (Some of the titles are tantalizing, in terms of what we have lost from Galen\u2019s ethics: What Follows from Each Chosen Aim in Life; The Epicureans; Against Favorinus\u2019 Attack on Socrates.)\nAlso outside the main curriculum is a huge body of works on logic and linguistic matters\u2014again, nearly all lost. The titles testify to an exceptional engagement, not only with logical and methodological questions, but also with specific texts of \u201cthe ancients\u201d in logic: those of Aristotle and his school, especially, but also those of the Stoics; and further texts were devoted to Plato\u2019s argumentation.\n",
