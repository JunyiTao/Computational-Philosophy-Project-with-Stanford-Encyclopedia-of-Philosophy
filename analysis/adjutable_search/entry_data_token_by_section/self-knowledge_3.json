    "main_text": "The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge || Agency\n1.3 Agency\n\nMany of our mental states, such as itches and tickles, are states we\nsimply undergo. But some argue that others are active. \u201cOur\nrational beliefs and intentions are not mere mental attitudes, but\nactive states of normative commitment\u201d (Korsgaard 2009: 39).\nThis idea inspires the claim, central to many versions of agentialism,\nthat the truly distinctive kind of self-knowledge is knowledge of\nthese \u201cactive states of normative commitment\u201d\n (see 3.7).\n Such self-knowledge is distinctive because believing and intending\nare things we do. According to these agentialists, this means\nthat rational beliefs and intentions are not known simply through\nobservation, which is the means by which we know other empirical\nphenomena (including sensations). \n",
