    "main_text": "Other Topics and Approaches || Social epistemology\n6.1 Social epistemology\n\nAs we have seen, NE is motivated by a variety of concerns about the\nmethods and ideals of TE\u2014for instance, a reliance upon the a\npriori, an apsychological, \u201ccurrent time slice\u201d\n(Goldman 2011) approach to understanding knowledge or justification, a\ntendency to overlook or idealize the resources and abilities that\nactual epistemic subjects possess, and so on. Another aspect of TE\nthat has recently come under much scrutiny is its tendency to treat\nsubjects in rather individualistic terms\u2014i.e., as\ndivorced from their social environment. This too is seen as a serious\ndistortion, given that people\u2019s lives, epistemic and otherwise,\nare importantly shaped by social forces. (Indeed, according to some,\neven this way of putting it is misleading, since it paints individuals\nas explanatorily prior to the social in epistemic matters.) Worth\nnoting here is that even paradigm instances of NE might be charged\nwith being unduly focused on the individual\u2014e.g., with looking to\nindividual psychology as being especially relevant to epistemology, at\nthe expense of areas of empirical study with a more social orientation\n(cf. Grandy 1994: 346\u2013348).\n\nSocial epistemology (SE) is a large and diverse area of\nresearch aimed at countering the individualism of TE by studying\nepistemic phenomena from a properly social perspective. (Sample\noverviews of SE are Schmitt 1994 and Goldman and Blanchard 2015.\nGoldman and Whitcomb 2011 is an up-to-date collection of papers on SE;\nand Lackey 2014 is a volume of new papers on collective epistemology\nspecifically.) Just as with NE, different specific theories and\ntheorists within SE maintain closer or more distant relations to TE.\nSome social epistemologists maintain a view of the individual as the\nprimary locus of epistemic achievement, for example, while others\ntreat entities other than individuals, such as groups or corporations,\nas having epistemic properties. Some theorists evaluate various social\nprocesses and institutions in terms of some more general, non-social\nfeature (e.g., reliability), while others think that the relevant\ngood-making features are not so reducible. Some retain truth as the\nprimary epistemic goal; others propose some non-traditional goal. And\nso on. Across these various approaches, however, many practitioners\nwithin SE are motivated by concerns similar to those that animate NE,\nand many of the forms and themes within NE\n (Section 1.2)\n appear here as well. (In terms of the theoretical choice points\nmentioned just above, Goldman 1999b, for example\u2014as he does with\nrespect to NE per se\u2014tends to occupy the more\n\u201cconservative\u201d positions; the SE of Martin Kusch 2002, for\ninstance, rejects many of the core assumptions of TE; and Helen\nLongino\u2019s 2002 views are, arguably, intermediate between the\ntwo.)\n",
