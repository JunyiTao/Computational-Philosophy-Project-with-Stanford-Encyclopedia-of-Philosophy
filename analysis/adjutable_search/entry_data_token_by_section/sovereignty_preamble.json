    "main_text": "\n\nSovereignty, though its meanings have varied across history, also has\na core meaning, supreme authority within a territory. It is a\nmodern notion of political authority. Historical variants can be\nunderstood along three dimensions \u2014 the holder of sovereignty,\nthe absoluteness of sovereignty, and the internal and external\ndimensions of sovereignty. The state is the political institution in\nwhich sovereignty is embodied. An assemblage of states forms a\nsovereign states system.\n\nThe history of sovereignty can be understood through two broad\nmovements, manifested in both practical institutions and political\nthought. The first is the development of a system of sovereign states,\nculminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporaneously,\nsovereignty became prominent in political thought through the writings\nof Machiavelli, Luther, Bodin, and Hobbes. The second movement is the\ncircumscription of the sovereign state, which began in practice after\nWorld War II and has since continued through European integration and\nthe growth and strengthening of laws and practices to protect human\nrights. The most prominent corresponding political thought occurs in\nthe writings of critics of sovereignty like Bertrand de Jouvenel and\nJacques Maritain.\n",
