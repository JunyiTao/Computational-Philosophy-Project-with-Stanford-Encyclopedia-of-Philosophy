    "main_text": "Meta-mathematics || Lawless sequences\n5.3 Lawless sequences\n\nThere exist axiomatizations of the lawless sequences, and they all\ncontain extensions of the continuity axioms (Kreisel 1968, Troelstra\n1977). In particular in the form of the Axiom of Open Data stating\nthat for \\(A(\\alpha)\\) not containing other nonlawlike parameters\nbesides \\(\\alpha\\):  \n\n\\[\n\n A(\\alpha) \\rightarrow \\exists n \\forall \\beta \\in \\alpha (\\overline{n}) A(\\beta). \n\n\\]\n\n\nIn (Troelstra 1977), a theory of lawless sequences is developed (and\njustified) in the context of intuitionistic analysis. Besides axioms\nfor elementary analysis it contains, for lawless sequences,\nstrengthened forms of the axioms of open data, continuity,\ndecidability and density (density says that every finite sequence is\nthe initial segment of a lawless sequence). What is especially\ninteresting is that in these theories quantifiers over lawless\nsequences can be eliminated, a result that can also be viewed as\nproviding a model of lawlike sequences for such theories. Other\nclassical models of the theory of lawless sequences have been\nconstructed in category theory in the form of sheaf models (van der\nHoeven and Moerdijk 1984). In (Moschovakis 1986), a theory for choice\nsequences relative to a certain set of lawlike elements is introduced,\nalong with a classical model in which the lawless sequences turn out\nto be exactly the generic ones.\n",
