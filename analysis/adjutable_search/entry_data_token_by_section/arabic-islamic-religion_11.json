    "main_text": "Prophecy and Miracles || Prophecy\n4.1 Prophecy\n\nConcerning the first issue of justifying and explaining prophecy,\nproponents of prophecy were faced with a challenge. Since humans are\nrational, presumably they can acquire knowledge of reality and the\nrules of conduct regarding their individual and social life on their\nown. Thus, one may ask, \u201cWhy are prophets necessary for\nacquiring true beliefs and proper rules of conduct?\u201d Indeed,\nMuslims did encounter opposition to their belief in prophecy, ranging\nfrom those who claimed it was redundant\u2014at least as the,\nadmittedly hostile, reports about Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b\nrelate\u2014to those who thought it was simply impossible\u2014a\nposition that Muslim theologians ascribed to Ibn al-R\u0101wand\u012b\n(b. ca. 815) and the Bar\u0101hima, arguably the Brahmans of\nIndia (see Stroumsa 1999). Detractors of prophecy formulated the\nproblem regarding the need for prophecy as a dilemma (A. H.\nR\u0101z\u012b Proofs of Prophecy: 24\u20136 &\n131\u20134; Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 165; Nasaf\u012b TA: vol.\nII, 1\u20133). If, on the one hand, that which a prophet teaches on\nthe basis of revelation agrees with that which reason can show, there\nis no need for prophecy. If, on the other hand, that which a prophet\nteaches is inaccessible to reason, then it is not rational, and so to\nbe rejected. The argument continues that it seems impossible that God\nshould act in vain, but if he were to send prophets, he would be\nacting in vain, since the presence of prophets is either redundant or\ntheir message is in a sense irrational.\n\nTheologians and certain Muslim philosophers both wanted to justify and\nto explain prophecy in light of this challenge. Theologians preferred\nto show why, despite the above dilemma, prophecy is possible and not\nvain: If anything, it is a sign of God\u2019s grace. Certain\nphilosophers aimed to show that in addition to prophecy\u2019s being\npossible, there is a natural explanation for it grounded in natural\nphilosophy. While both groups\u2019 approaches are significantly\ndifferent, they share a common feature. Both recognized that human\ncognitive capacities differ and that not all humans are equal with\nregard to those capacities. Indeed, most humans need the symbolic and\nsimplified message of a prophet to reach genuine knowledge of the key\nreligious, ethical and social elements necessary for a devout\nlife.\n\nJuwayn\u012b followed by his student Ghaz\u0101l\u012b are\nrepresentatives of the theologians (Juwayn\u012b\nal-Irsh\u0101d, 302\u20137 = Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n165\u20137 and Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 188\u201395;\nalso see Griffel 2004). For them, it is reasonable that different\nindividuals with different intellectual capacities may know one and\nthe same truth in different ways. One way, however, need not make\nanother way redundant, let alone impossible. Also, even if on their\nown some humans can learn certain specific religious claims, reaching\nthem frequently is difficult and requires a lengthy and diligent\ninquiry, which not all either are willing to do or even capable of\ndoing. Hence, these theologians conclude, it is appropriate, although\nnot obligatory, that God makes such truths available through prophets\nin order that people who do not have the time nor capacity to pursue\nsuch an inquiry still can learn about God and things divine. In this\nrespect, prophecy, far from being vain, is a sign of God\u2019s grace\nand concession to human diversity and weakness.\n\nThe philosophers\u2019 have multiple strategies when treating\nprophecy. For example, Ibn Rushd maintains that while philosophy and\nscience provide the most complete theoretical account of the\nworld and God\u2019s relation to it, prophecy and religion more\ngenerally provide a practical knowledge of what is good and\nright with respect to one\u2019s actions (see Taylor 2018). Ibn Rushd\nmakes this point when identify which kinds of purported miracles are\ngenuine signs of a prophet. He likens a prophet to a physician. If two\nindividuals were both to claim to be physicians, and one says,\n\u201cHere is my proof\u201d, and then walks on water, whereas the\nother heals the sick, it is the latter\u2019s proof that is truly\nrelevant and convincing that he is a physician. Similarly, if two\nindividuals claim to be prophets, and so bearers of a message about\nwhat God wants of us in order to live well and devoutly, and one gives\nas proof some seemingly supernatural act, while the other provides\nlaws and knowledge that actually allow one to live well and devoutly,\nit is the latter who is the genuine prophet (Ibn Rushd\nExpositions, 104\u20135). It is noteworthy that like\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn Rushd distinguishes between philosophers\nand those incapable of grasping philosophical proof. As for prophetic\nmessages, the latter group needs only know that prophecy conveys what\nis necessary for living a religious life, while any theoretical\naccount of prophecy must be withheld from them. The fact is that it is\nunclear whether Ibn Rushd has or even thinks that there can be a\ntheoretical account of prophecy, since in his works exclusively for\nphilosophers (mu\u02beawwal) he is prone to be completely\nsilent or at most raises unanswered puzzles about prophecy.\n\nA theoretical account of prophecy and the mechanism through which it\npurportedly occurs are seen in the works of F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State: ch.\n14 and Avicenna DA: 5.6 = MR07: 204\u20135; also see Walzer 1957 and\nMarmura 1964). Both philosophers would agree with Ibn Rushd that the\nprimary aspect of prophecy and revelation is grounded in the need for\nlaws and political institutions. That is because these laws and\npolitical institutions delineate and support actions directed toward\nthe proper end of humans, namely, happiness or flourishing\n(sa\u02bf\u0101da), which intimately involves a knowledge of\nGod (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Tanb\u012bh = MR07:\n104\u201320 Avicenna MetaH: 10.2). Unlike Ibn Rushd, they\nadditionally want to provide a theoretical account of prophecy. This\ntheoretical account attempts to show that far from being a\nsupernatural act, as the theologians believe, prophecy is a natural\nphenomenon and as such has a naturalistic explanation. This attempt at\na naturalistic explanation of prophecy is grounded in both their\nemanationist metaphysics and philosophy of mind (see entry on\n Arabic and Islamic psychology and philosophy of mind).\n The details of their positions are complex, so the following is\nsimply to provide a general sense of their strategy.\n\nAs seen, for F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, there\nemanates from God the order of the good in the form of a cascade of\ngrades of dependent or possible existents, each of which can itself be\na source of emanation and a principle of a lower grade. Human\ncognition is itself part of this overflowing: Human intellects receive\nthis emanation once they are suitably prepared and to the extent that\nthey are capable, which in turn perfects the intellects so that they\ncome to have knowledge of our world and God. Next, as noted earlier,\nthe philosophers recognize varying degrees among human cognitive\ncapacities. At the very apex of these varying degrees of capacity is\nthe intellect and imaginative power of prophets. The prophets\u2019\ncognitive powers are wholly and perfectly disposed to receive this\nemanation, and to the greatest extent possible for humans they grasp\nthe divine order of the good as it emanates from God. Moreover, from\ntheir intellects the cascade of emanation continues, now entering into\ntheir imagination such that they sensibly experience as symbols and\nimages what they perfectly know through receiving this ultimately\ndivine emanation. It is these symbols and images that the prophets use\nto convey God\u2019s proverbial plan to those who are otherwise\nincapable of acquiring this knowledge. While the above presentation\noverly emphasizes the \u2018metaphysical\u2019 aspect of their\ntheory of prophecy, the fact is that the bulk of the theory is\ndiscussed and developed in natural philosophy, particularly in works\ncorresponding with Aristotle\u2019s De anima and discussions\nin the novel reworking of the Arabic version of Aristotle\u2019s\nParva Naturalia (for the Arabic verion of the Parva\nNaturalia see Hansberger 2010). In a real sense, the aim is to\nnaturalize prophecy. Thus, prophecy, for these philosophers, is\npossible precisely because it is the natural, even necessary, outcome\nof certain rare, but wholly natural, psychological processes.\n",
