    "main_text": "Incommensurability and World-Change\n4. Incommensurability and World-Change\nThe standard empiricist conception of theory evaluation regards our\njudgment of the epistemic quality of a theory to be a matter of\napplying rules of method to the theory and the evidence. Kuhn\u2019s\ncontrasting view is that we judge the quality of a theory (and its\ntreatment of the evidence) by comparing it to a paradigmatic\ntheory. The standards of assessment therefore are not permanent,\ntheory-independent rules. They are not rules, because they involve\nperceived relations of similarity (of puzzle-solution to a\nparadigm). They are not theory-independent, since they involve\ncomparison to a (paradigm) theory. They are not permanent, since the\nparadigm may change in a scientific revolution. For example, to many\nin the seventeenth century, Newton\u2019s account of gravitation, involving\naction at a distance with no underlying explanation, seemed a poor\naccount, in that respect at least, when compared, for example, to\nPtolemy\u2019s explanation of the motion of the planets in terms of\ncontiguous crystalline spheres or to Descartes\u2019 explanation in\nterms of vortices. However, later, once Newton\u2019s theory had become\naccepted and the paradigm by which later theories were judged, the lack\nof an underlying mechanism for a fundamental force was regarded as no\nobjection, as, for example, in the case of Coulomb\u2019s law of\nelectrostatic attraction. Indeed, in the latter case the very\nsimilarity of Coulomb\u2019s equation to Newton\u2019s was taken to be in its\nfavour.\nConsequently, comparison between theories will not be as\nstraightforward as the standard empiricist picture would have it,\nsince the standards of evaluation are themselves subject to\nchange. This sort of difficulty in theory comparison is an instance of\nwhat Kuhn and Feyerabend called\n\u2018incommensurability\u2019. Theories are incommensurable when\nthey share no common measure. Thus, if paradigms are the measures of\nattempted puzzle-solutions, then puzzle-solutions developed in\ndifferent eras of normal science will be judged by comparison to\ndiffering paradigms and so lack a common measure. The term\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 derives from a mathematical use,\naccording to which the side and diagonal of a square are\nincommensurable in virtue of there being no unit that can be used to\nmeasure both exactly. Kuhn stressed that incommensurability did not\nmean non-comparability (just as the side and diagonal of a\nsquare are comparable in many respects). Even so, it is clear that at\nthe very least Kuhn\u2019s incommensurability thesis would make theory\ncomparison rather more difficult than had commonly been supposed, and\nin some cases impossible.\nWe can distinguish three types of incommensurability in Kuhn\u2019s\nremarks: (1) methodological\u2014there is no common measure because\nthe methods of comparison and evaluation change; (2)\nperceptual/observational\u2014observational evidence cannot provide a\ncommon basis for theory comparison, since perceptual experience is\ntheory-dependent; (3) semantic\u2014the fact that the languages of\ntheories from different periods of normal science may not be\ninter-translatable presents an obstacle to the comparison of those\ntheories. (See Sankey 1993 for a useful discussion of Kuhn\u2019s changing\naccounts of incommensurability.)\n",
