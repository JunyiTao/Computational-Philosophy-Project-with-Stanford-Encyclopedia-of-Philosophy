    "main_text": "\n\nFeminist epistemology and philosophy of science studies the ways in\nwhich gender does and ought to influence our conceptions of knowledge,\nknowers, and practices of inquiry and justification. It identifies how\ndominant conceptions and practices of knowledge attribution,\nacquisition, and justification disadvantage women and other\nsubordinated groups, and strives to reform them to serve the interests\nof these groups. Various feminist epistemologists and philosophers of\nscience argue that dominant knowledge practices disadvantage women by\n(1) excluding them from inquiry, (2) denying them epistemic authority,\n(3) denigrating \u201cfeminine\u201d cognitive styles, (4) producing\ntheories of women that represent them as inferior, or significant only\nin the ways they serve male interests, (5) producing theories of\nsocial phenomena that render women\u2019s activities and interests,\nor gendered power relations, invisible, and (6) producing knowledge\nthat is not useful for people in subordinate positions, or that\nreinforces gender and other social hierarchies. Feminist\nepistemologists trace these failures to flawed conceptions of\nknowledge, knowers, objectivity, and scientific methodology. They\noffer diverse accounts of how to overcome these failures. They also\naim to (1) explain why the entry of women and feminist scholars into\ndifferent academic disciplines has generated new questions, theories,\nmethods, and findings, (2) show how gender and feminist values and\nperspectives have played a causal role in these transformations, (3)\npromote theories that aid egalitarian and liberation movements, and\n(4) defend these developments as epistemic advances. \n\nThe central concept of feminist epistemology is of situated knowledge:\nknowledge that reflects the particular perspectives of the knower.\nFeminist philosophers explore how gender situates knowing subjects.\nThey have articulated three main approaches to this\nquestion\u2014feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and\nfeminist empiricism\u2014which have converged over time. Conceptions of\nhow gender situates knowers also inform feminist approaches to the\ncentral problems of the field: grounding feminist criticisms of\nscience and feminist science, defining the proper roles of social and\npolitical values in inquiry, evaluating ideals of objectivity, and\nreforming practices of epistemic authority and epistemic virtue.\n",
