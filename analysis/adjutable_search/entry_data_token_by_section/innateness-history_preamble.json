    "main_text": "\n\n\nWe are as we are and we live as we do because of the interplay of our\ninherent natures and the world around us. This much is\nuncontroversial. But one may wonder about the extent of the\ncontributions of the two broad factors and about the nature of the\ninteractions. This is where the innateness controversy begins. In the\nhistory of philosophy, the focus of the innateness debate has been on\nour intellectual lives: does our inherent nature include any ideas,\nconcepts, categories, knowledge, principles, etc, or do we start out\nwith blank cognitive slates (tabulae rasae) and get all our\ninformation and knowledge from perception? Nativists defend some\nvariant of the first option, while Empiricists lean towards the\nsecond.\n\n\nTo modern ears this sounds like a straightforward empirical question\nthat can only be addressed scientifically. But even if we grant\nthat the philosophical controversy was to some extent\npremature \u2013 like Greek speculations about the ultimate constituents\nof the world \u2013 it is important to understand that the question\nloomed large in philosophy not only because of its inherent interest,\nbut primarily because of what followed \u2013 or was thought to\nfollow \u2013 from the competing positions. The innateness\nquestion was taken as a lynchpin in settling questions in morality,\nreligion, epistemology, metaphysics, and so on.\n\n\nA survey of the philosophical career of innateness reveals that\nalthough it is an easy doctrine to attack, it is a hard one to\nkill. Innateness has been in the philosophical limelight in two\nperiods \u2013 each time flaring, and then receding. In the ancient\nworld, it played a pivotal role in Plato\u2019s philosophy, but was\nexcluded from the Aristotelian system that came to dominate subsequent\nphilosophical thinking. In the 17th and 18th century, it was\nrevived. It played an important role in Descartes\u2019 theory of\nknowledge, Locke mounted a sustained assault against it at the very\nbeginning of his Essay, and Leibniz produced a detailed rebuttal\nagainst Locke. But the Lockean Empiricist approach carried the day,\nand innateness was written off as a backward and discredited\nview. Nineteenth century Kantianism, although potentially friendlier\nto innateness, left it on the sidelines as philosophically\nirrelevant. Recently, however, prompted by Noam Chomsky\u2019s claims\nthat findings in linguistics vindicate Nativism against Empiricism\n(see Chomsky 1965 for an early example), innateness has made a strong\ncomeback; it is once again the subject of philosophical and scientific\ncontroversy.\n",
