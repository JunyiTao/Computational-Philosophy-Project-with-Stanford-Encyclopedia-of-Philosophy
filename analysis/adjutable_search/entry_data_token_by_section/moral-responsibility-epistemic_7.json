    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism || Capacitarianism\n3.4 Capacitarianism\n\nThe fourth type of response to the regress argument is the one that\ndeparts more radically from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness. According to it, agents can be directly blameworthy not\nonly for actions and omissions performed out of moral ignorance, but\nalso for actions and omissions performed out of factual ignorance;\nthat is, for fully unwitting wrongful conduct. (Recall that\nquality-of-will theorists restrict their claims to morally ignorant\nwrongdoing. Again, exceptions are Angela Smith 2005 & 2017 and\nBj\u00f6rnsson 2017b.) Since what all the adherents to this position\nhave in common is the idea that blameworthiness in these cases is\nlargely (though not exclusively) explained by the presence of certain\ncapacities possession of which makes the agent capable of acquiring\nthe relevant awareness, their position can be dubbed\n\u2018capacitarianism\u2019. In their view, the best formulation of\nthe EC is disjunctive (Sher 2009: 87): agents satisfy the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility either if they are aware of the\nrelevant factual and moral considerations or if they should and\ncould be aware of them given the available evidence, the\nopportunity to adequately process it, and their cognitive capacities.\nCapacitarians differ on what else (if anything) has to be added to the\nsecond disjunct, but they all agree that a central element in the\nexplanation of blameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing is the fact\nthat the agent should and could have known better than she did\n(FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017; Sher 2009; Clarke 2014 & 2017a, b;\nMurray 2017; Rudy-Hiller 2017; Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray &\nVargas 2018 [Other Internet Resources]; Vargas 2018 [Other Internet\n Resources]).[10]\n\nAn important motivation for this view is to account for cases in which\npeople seem to be blameworthy for unwitting omissions despite the fact\nthat: i) the omissions and attendant failures of awareness\naren\u2019t explicable in terms of ill will; and ii) blameworthiness\ncan\u2019t be traced back to a previous failure to discharge some\nobligation (Sher 2017b). Staple cases of this sort are forgetting\ncases, such as this one (see also Clarke 2014: 164\u20135):\n\n\nHot Dog. Alessandra, a soccer mom, has gone to pick up her\nchildren at their elementary school. As usual, Alessandra is\naccompanied by the family\u2019s border collie, Bathsheba, who rides\nin the back of the van. Although it is very hot, the pick-up has never\ntaken long, so Alessandra leaves Sheba in the van while she goes to\ngather her children. This time, however, Alessandra is greeted by a\ntangled tale of misbehavior, ill-considered punishment, and\nadministrative bungling which requires several hours of indignant\nsorting out. During that time, Sheba languishes, forgotten, in the\nlocked car. When Alessandra and her children finally make it to the\nparking lot, they find Sheba unconscious from heat prostration. (Sher\n2009: 24)\n\n\nIn this example, Alessandra is intuitively blameworthy for omitting to\nlet the dog out of the van. But her wrongful omission is fully\nunwitting: she\u2019s unaware not only of its wrongness but even of\nthe fact that she\u2019s omitting to do something she ought to do in\nthe first place. Importantly, as the case is described there is no\nreason to think that Alessandra\u2019s omission stems from ill will\ntowards the dog or towards those who love the dog, such as her\nchildren (Sher 2009: 37, 91; see also Clarke 2017a: 246; King 2009:\n584\u20135; Amaya & Doris 2015: 266; Murray 2017: 516). Rather,\nwhat explains her failure of awareness isn\u2019t flawed character\ntraits or lack of regard for morally significant interests, but simply\nthe cognitive and emotional load placed upon her by the unusual\nsituation at the school (Sher 2009: 131), which, by assumption,\nwasn\u2019t overwhelming enough to excuse her for her omission (see\nAmaya & Doris 2015: 263). Finally, it\u2019s implausible to try\nto account for Alessandra\u2019s blameworthiness by positing a\nprevious failure to discharge some obligation of due care\u2014like\nsetting the alarm on her phone to remind her of the dog\u2014since\nthe situation was unpredictable (Sher 2009: 35\u20136) and intending\nto let the dog stay in the car for a couple of minutes doesn\u2019t\nseem to be wrong (cf. Nelkin & Rickless 2017a who claim that in\nthis sort of cases there usually is a previous violation of\nan obligation related to preventing the episode of forgetfulness). The\nomission in question is just a regrettable but, according to\ncapacitarians, culpable mistake (Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray 2017:\n516). So if intuitions about responsibility in this sort of cases\naren\u2019t misleading, neither awareness nor ill will are necessary\nfor blameworthiness. (Levy [2017] and Talbert [2017b] offer\nempirically-based error theories according to which intuitions in\nthese cases are misleading because people tend to\nmisattribute lack of moral concern to unwitting wrongdoers based\nsolely on the consequences of their actions, and this mistaken\nattribution is then used as grounds for blaming them. But Murray\net al. [2019] provide contrary empirical evidence suggesting\nthat what drives ordinary people to assign responsibility in\nforgetting cases is mainly the presence of an adequate opportunity to\nremember rather than the level of concern the forgetful agent\ndisplayed toward what she was supposed to do.)\n\nThe challenge for capacitarians is then to explain three things: i)\nwhat norms support the claim that unwitting wrongdoers\nshould have known better; ii) what capacities\njustify the assumption that unwitting wrongdoers could have\nknown better; and iii) why its being true that an unwitting wrongdoer\nshould and could have known better grounds responsibility for\nunwitting\n wrongdoing.[11]\n\nBefore going into the details of how capacitarians answer these\nquestions, let\u2019s see what theses of the regress argument are\ndenied by them. All capacitarians (with the exception of FitzPatrick,\nsee fn. 10) reject theses i and iii, since they are united in the\nbeliefs that blameworthiness for unwitting conduct can be direct and\nneedn\u2019t trace back to culpable ignorance (against thesis i), and\nalso that factual awareness\u2014and a fortiori occurrent\nand de dicto moral awareness\u2014isn\u2019t necessary for\ndirect responsibility (against thesis iii). Since capacitarians\nusually focus on factual rather than on moral ignorance, they usually\nleave thesis iv (Parity) untouched (but see Sher 2017a). However, they\nseem to be committed to accepting it, given that a crucial aspect of\nthe capacitarian view is that agents are excused for their unwitting\nwrongdoing whenever isn\u2019t reasonable to expect them to know\nbetter due to an unfavorable epistemic situation (Sher 2017a; Clarke\n2017a: 242; Murray 2017: 515, 521; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 408). But since\nsometimes a situation is epistemically unfavorable for forming correct\nmoral beliefs (FitzPatrick 2017: 34\u20136), it follows from\nthe capacitarian view that at least in some such circumstances agents\nare excused for not knowing better in moral matters (FitzPatrick 2008:\n602). Finally, there is disagreement among capacitarians whether\nthesis ii (that blameworthiness for ignorance is necessarily\nderivative) is true or not. Clarke (2014: 171, 173; 2017a:\n245\u20136) tentatively accepts it, since he thinks that failures of\nawareness aren\u2019t culpable if they don\u2019t result from a\nculpable benighting action or omission. At the same time, he denies\nthat culpability for ignorant wrongdoing necessitates culpability for\nthe underlying ignorance (Clarke 2017a: 246), thus avoiding the\nregress in the volitionists\u2019 argument. In Clarke\u2019s view,\nthen, an agent can be blameworthy for an unwitting wrongful action\neven if the ignorance from which she acts isn\u2019t culpable, as\nlong as such ignorance is substandard\u2014and therefore faulty\n(Clarke 2017a: 245). (Note that the soundness of this move rests on\nthe defensibility of the distinction between culpable and faulty\nignorance. See Rudy-Hiller [2017: 416] for criticism.) By contrast,\nRudy-Hiller (2017: 413) rejects thesis ii, since he claims that an\nagent is directly blameworthy for her ignorance if she is capable of\ngaining the required awareness and there is no significant impediment\nto the exercise of the relevant cognitive capacities.\n\nLet\u2019s return now to the three central questions capacitarians\nmust answer to give plausibility to their view. The first concerns the\nnature of the norms of awareness supporting the claim that certain\nunwitting wrongdoers should have known better. The central function of\nthese norms is to set a standard against which failures of awareness\nare evaluated to determine which ones are defective and which\ndon\u2019t. When failures of awareness aren\u2019t defective, it\nisn\u2019t the case that the involved agents should have known better\nand thus they are excused for their unwitting wrongdoing.\nCapacitarians agree that norms of awareness are sensitive to the\nagent\u2019s cognitive capacities and circumstances (Sher 2009: 110;\nClarke 2014: 167; Murray 2017: 516; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 413; FitzPatrick\n2017: 37). They also agree that these norms are derivative, in the\nsense that both their content (the considerations agents should be\naware of) and their normative force (their bindingness on agents) come\nfrom another set of norms, namely moral ones. In other words,\nit\u2019s because awareness of certain considerations is necessary\nfor fulfilling moral obligations that such awareness can be demanded\nof agents (Sher 2009: 111\u20132; Murray 2017: 515).\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that the norms of awareness capacitarians\nrely on to substantiate should-have-known allegations aren\u2019t\nduties of inquiry. While norms of awareness directly demand awareness\nof relevant considerations, duties of inquiry impose obligations to\nundertake information-gathering actions that contribute to the\noccurrence of such awareness (Rosen 2004: 302; 2008: 600\u20131; H.\nSmith 2014; Wieland 2017a: 6\u20138). In other words, while norms of\nawareness are concerned with agents\u2019 states of mind,\nduties of inquiry are concerned with agents\u2019\n activities.[12]\n This naturally generates the following worry concerning norms of\nawareness: given that \u201cbecoming aware is not something we do but\nsomething that happens to us\u201d (Sher 2009: 112; see also Rosen\n2004: 302; 2008: 600), one might wonder whether the should-have-known\ncriterion can be used to undergird blameworthiness after all. If\nfailures of awareness escape the agent\u2019s direct control, how\ncould it be true that such involuntary failures partly explain direct\nresponsibility for unwitting wrongdoing? (Nelkin 2011: 679\u201380;\nNelkin & Rickless 2015).\n\nCapacitarians have different responses to this worry. Sher (2009:\n147\u20138) ultimately rejects the control condition on moral\nresponsibility in favor of an origination requirement (see below).\nClarke, who holds on to the control condition, denies that norms of\nawareness give rise to moral obligations; in his view, they merely set\na standard for evaluating failures of awareness as faulty or not\n(2014: 167). Rudy-Hiller (2017: 418) advances a notion of control\naccording to which agents do have responsibility-relevant control over\ntheir states of awareness and so they can be morally obligated to\nremember or notice morally significant considerations. Finally, Murray\n(2017) describes, and offers empirical evidence for, a distinctive\n\u2018vigilance\u2019 capacity that enables agents to become aware\nof relevant considerations and which, according to him, affords them\ndirect control over the degree of awareness they display.\n\nThe second central question for capacitarians is which capacities make\nit true that an unwitting wrongdoer could have known better. Clarke\noffers the following characterization of them:\n\n\nSome are capacities to do things that are in a plain sense active: to\nturn one\u2019s attention to, or maintain attention on, some matter;\nto raise a question in one\u2019s mind or pursue some line of\ninquiry; to make a decision about whether to do this or that. Others,\nthough capacities to do things, aren\u2019t capacities whose exercise\nconsists in intentional action. These include capacities to remember,\nto think of relevant considerations, to notice features of one\u2019s\nsituation and appreciate their normative significance, to think at\nappropriate times to do things that need doing. (2017a: 242)\n\n\nCapacitarians then appeal to the idea of unexercised capacities to\nexplain why certain unwitting wrongdoers could have been aware of\nrelevant considerations: it\u2019s because those wrongdoers possess\nthe requisite cognitive capacities, but failed to exercise them\ndespite the absence of significant impediments, that they could have\nknown better (Clarke 2017a: 242; 2017b: 67; Murray 2017: 520;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407; Vargas 2018: 15 [Other Internet\nResources]).\n\nSeveral objections can be raised at this point. First, notice that\neven cognitive capacities that issue in intentional actions (such as\nraising a question in one\u2019s mind) don\u2019t provide direct\ncontrol over awareness of relevant considerations but only\nfavor its occurrence, which remains out of one\u2019s\ncontrol (Rosen 2004: 302; Montmarquet 1999: 845). So, under the\nassumption that control is required for responsibility, it remains\nunclear how failures of awareness contribute to explaining direct\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing (Nelkin & Rickless 2015.\nFor a similar objection stated in terms of choice rather than control,\nsee Moore & Hurd 2011: 164). Second, and relatedly, the claim that\npossession of these capacities ground reasonable expectations of the\nsort that are relevant for attributions of responsibility (Clarke\n2017a: 242; 2017b: 67) can be disputed, for since the exercise of some\nof these capacities isn\u2019t under our control, whether they are\ndisplayed or not is a chance occurrence and chance occurrences\ncan\u2019t ground reasonable expectations (Levy 2017: 255. Clarke\n2017a: 249\u201350 offers a brief response to this objection).\n\nThird and finally, it has been doubted whether capacitarians have a\nconvincing story about what it takes to have the relevant unexercised\ncognitive capacities (Levy 2014: 124\u20135; Moore & Hurd 2011:\n160\u20131). Sher, for instance, relies on a counterfactual account\nof capacities, according to which saying that someone was capable of\nnoticing, remembering, thinking of something, etc., \u201cis only to\nsay that he would have remembered [noticed, thought of] in an\nappropriate range of alternative situations\u201d (2009:\n114, italics added). The crucial task is of course to define what the\nappropriate range is, since, intuitively, one doesn\u2019t have a\ncapacity to X if one would only very rarely successfully X in a range\nof relevant scenarios. For instance, it might be argued that\nAlessandra can\u2019t be credited with the possession of the relevant\ncognitive capacity if we assume, plausibly, that she would only very\nrarely remember the dog in a range of similar situations to the one\nshe actually confronted. If one were to respond that it suffices for\nattributing the relevant unexercised capacity that there is a\ncounterfactual scenario in which Alessandra does remember the dog,\nthis would objectionably lower the bar for attributing unexercised\ncapacities, with the consequence that many intuitively blameless\nunwitting wrongdoers would turn out to be blameworthy after all (Levy\n2014: 125). (See Vargas 2013 [ch. 7] and Vargas 2018 [Other Internet\nResources] for a version of the counterfactual account that attempts\nto give more precision to the \u2018appropriate range\u2019\ncriterion for attributing unexercised capacities.)\n\nAlternatively, some capacitarians attribute unexercised capacities by\nappealing not to counterfactual scenarios but to the agent\u2019s\npast performances in similar situations (Clarke 2014: 166; 2017a: 244;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407\u20138). This move raises problems of its own,\nhowever, since, on the one hand, an agent might possess a relevant\ncognitive capacity\u2014for instance a quite good capacity to\nremember certain considerations\u2014despite the fact that she often\nfails to exercise it perhaps because she doesn\u2019t care much about\nthose considerations (Nelkin & Rickless 2015; see also Nelkin\n& Rickless 2017a: 112\u20133). On the other hand, an\nagent\u2019s past performances aren\u2019t necessarily a good proxy\nfor attributing her a certain unexercised capacity now, since\ndespite her previous successes she might have lost the relevant\ncapacity in the meantime and so it would be unfair to fault her for\nher current lack of awareness (Sher 2009: 109).\n\nThe third central question for capacitarians is why the truth of the\nshould-and-could-have-known-better clause contributes to explaining\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing and what, if anything, has to\nbe added to the explanation. Sher states the worry in this way:\n\n\nthe reason the agent\u2019s actual awareness seems significant is\nthat it implies that the act\u2019s being wrong or foolish is among\nthe total set of considerations in light of which he chose to perform\nit. To whatever extent his choice was in this way knowing as well as\nwilling, the act, qua instance of wrong or foolish behavior, is in a\nsuitably deep sense his own. However, and in stark contrast, when an\nagent merely should be aware that he is acting wrongly or foolishly,\nthere is no comparably direct connection between the wrongness or\nfoolishness of what he does and his informed will. Hence, where no\nactual awareness is involved, the standard rationale for holding him\nresponsible does not appear to be available. (Sher 2009: 74)\n\n\nAnother way of putting the worry is this: since attributions of\nresponsibility are usually anchored in some morally relevant feature\nof the agent to which awareness contributes, such as choice or\ngood/ill will (Amaya & Doris 2015: 254), an account of\nresponsibility for unwitting wrongdoing in which neither choice nor\nthe agent\u2019s quality of will are implicated runs the risk of\nappearing ad hoc (King 2009: 587). So the challenge for\ncapacitarians is to show that their account isn\u2019t ad\nhoc and, at the same time, to provide a \u201cmorally plausible\ndesert basis for blame\u201d in cases of unwitting wrongdoing (Moore\n& Hurd 2011: 160).\n\nWe\u2019ll focus on Sher\u2019s response to this challenge.\nConcerning the charge of ad hocness, Sher argues that, quite\ngenerally, the crucial morally relevant feature implicated in\nattributions of responsibility isn\u2019t choice, control, or quality\nof will but origination, understood as an appropriate causal\nrelation between the agent and her action\u2019s right-/wrong-making\nfeatures (Sher 2009: 147; 2017b: 9\u201310). So, in Sher\u2019s\nview, in order to appropriately praise or blame an agent for an action\nit must be the case that its relevant moral features are suitably\nconnected to her (Sher 2009: 82). One way in which this suitable\nconnection occurs is when the agent is aware of those features and\nchooses to perform the action in light of them, thus making the action\n\u201cin a suitably deep sense his own\u201d (2009: 74). Another way\n(in the case of wrong\n acts)[13]\n in which the suitable connection occurs is when the agent\u2019s\nunawareness of the action\u2019s wrong-making features is defective\nin the sense indicated above and such unawareness is caused\nby the agent\u2019s constitutive attitudes, dispositions, and traits.\nWhen this is the case, Sher claims, the action\u2019s wrongness is\nsuitably connected to the agent and so\u2014assuming that she\nsatisfies other non-epistemic conditions as well\u2014she can\njustifiably be held responsible for her unwitting wrongdoing (2009:\n86\u20138, 118). For instance, if we assume that Alessandra could\nhave recalled the dog, and also that her failure to do so was caused\nby constitutive features of her psychology such as her solicitousness\nto her children and her anxiety about conflict (2009: 92), she\nsatisfies Sher\u2019s EC and so she\u2019s blameworthy for her\nunwitting omission (assuming, again, that she satisfies other\nnon-epistemic conditions as well). Thus, by appealing to a single\nnotion\u2014origination\u2014that allegedly grounds responsibility\nboth in cases of witting and unwitting wrongdoing, Sher meets the\ncharge of ad hocness.\n\nThis isn\u2019t enough, however, for it still must be shown that this\npurely causal origination relation is a morally plausibly desert basis\nfor blame. Sher (2009) claims that it is, because the psychological\nfeatures he classifies as constitutive of the agent\u2014her cares,\nvalues, beliefs and emotional makeup, but also her patterns of mental\nassociation, \u201cthe speed and accuracy of [her] inferences and\ndecision-making\u201d (2009: 86) and even \u201cthe relevant\nneurophysiological mechanisms\u201d (2009: 122) that produce her\nthoughts and actions\u2014\u201csustain her normal patterns of\nintellectual functioning\u201d (2009: 122) and make her a responsible\nagent (2009: 121), and so in reacting to her failures of awareness\n(and subsequent wrongdoing) caused by those psychological features we\nare reacting to the whole person as the source of those failures\n(2009: 92). Sher (2009: 91; 2017b: 10) emphasizes that the\npsychological features that cause failures of awareness and explain\nthe agent\u2019s blameworthiness needn\u2019t be moral flaws\nthemselves. For instance, Alessandra\u2019s solicitousness to her\nchildren isn\u2019t a moral flaw; it may even be a good\ntrait, and yet it remains true that if it caused Alessandra\u2019s\nunawareness it partially explains her blameworthiness for her\nomission. In sum, Sher\u2019s view is that the origination relation\nexplains why blaming unwitting wrongdoers is appropriate because it\nensures that the whole person was implicated in the wrongdoing for\nwhich she is blamed.\n\nHowever, many authors have found this aspect of Sher\u2019s position\nproblematic. Levy claims that while it\u2019s very plausible that\norigination is a condition on moral responsibility, it\nisn\u2019t plausible to think \u201cthat responsibility\nconsists in origination\u201d (2014: 127). The fact that an\nagent\u2019s failure of awareness causally originates in her\npsychology doesn\u2019t seem to warrant blaming her for the action or\nomission\u2019s wrongness, since the latter isn\u2019t\nlinked to her in a way the shows anything about the quality of her\nwill (Levy 2014: 128; see also Talbert 2017a: 57; Bj\u00f6rnsson\n2017b: 143). Similarly, while agreeing with Sher that agents can\nsometimes be held directly responsible for their failures of awareness\nand subsequent wrongdoing, Angela Smith (2010) argues that this is so\nonly when those failures exhibit a rational connection to the\nagent\u2019s evaluative judgments. By contrast, a purely\ncausal connection of the sort Sher defends \u201ccannot\nestablish the right kind of connection between an agent and\nher wrongdoing\u201d to justify blaming her for it (A. Smith 2010:\n523). Finally, Moore and Hurd (2011: 184) object that while the moral\nrelevance of conscious choice for blameworthiness is intuitively\nclear, it isn\u2019t at all clear how the fact that the agent\u2019s\n\u201cpsychophysical apparatus that characteristically causes her\nchosen actions also caused her on this occasion to do this unchosen\naction\u201d could analogously make blame appropriate. They thus\ndispute Sher\u2019s (2009: 140) contention that conscious choice and\nfailures of awareness (caused in the way he indicates) are equally\ngood ways of satisfying the origination relation and grounding\n blameworthiness.[14],\n [15]\n",
