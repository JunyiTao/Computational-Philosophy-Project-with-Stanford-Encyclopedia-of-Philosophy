Ontological challenges of developmental evolution\n\nMany ontological debates on the relation between development and\nevolution focus on the organism as the central unit, which both\ndevelops and evolves, in contrast to, for example, genes or\npopulations. Several theories have tried to clarify the nature of this\norganismic unit: According to one influential view, the organism is a\nseries of integrated processes during a life cycle (Bonner 1965;\nNicholson & Dupr\u00e9 2018; Fusco 2019a; DiFrisco 2019), with\ncomplex and reciprocal relationships between the whole organism and\nits parts (Gilbert & Sarkar 2000; Esposito 2016; Peterson 2017).\nCentral elements of this view are based on an organicist framework\ndeveloped by Kant, which states that in organisms \u201cthe parts,\nwith respect to both form and being, are only possible through their\nrelationship to the whole\u201d and \u201cthat the parts bind\nthemselves mutually into the unity of a whole in such a way that they\nare mutually cause and effect of one another\u201d (Kant 1790/1793\n[1902: 373]; see also Lenoir 1982). Haraway (2008) highlights the\nlatter idea of reciprocal interaction between organisms\u2019 parts\nby saying: \u201cReciprocal induction is the name of the game\u201d\n(2008: 228) and it is \u201creciprocating complexity all the way\ndown\u201d (2008: 42).\nThese ideas of life cycle integration and\nubiquitous reciprocity suggest a more processual and organism-centered\nontological perspective on the organism. This view is becoming\nimportant in studies of evolution. For example, in order to understand\nhow nervous systems evolve one need to consider that the nervous\nsystem of the developing organism has different functions than the\nadult nervous system and may be used to coordinate body construction\nas it develops (M. Levin 2019; Fields et al. 2020). That developing\nsystems show exaptation and competition and that evolving systems show\ncooperation has allowed Fields and Levin (forthcoming) to suggest that\ndevelopmental and evolutionary processes can be integrated on a\nscale-free level through the language of information processing and\ncommunication.\n\nA second ontological consideration states that developing and evolving\norganisms are integrated collective individuals, so-called holobionts\nor \u2018meta-organisms\u2019 (Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg\n2008; Bosch & McFall-Ngai 2011; Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber 2012;\nsee also O'Malley 2017; Baedke et al. 2020a). Therefore, our\ndiscussions about evolution must take into consideration that each\norganism is a consortium having numerous genomes, not just one, as\ntraditionally assumed. Mathematical modeling of the evolution of\nholobionts that take this diversity into consideration is just\nbeginning (Roughgarden et al. 2018; Osmanovic et al. 2018; Roughgarden\n2020). This new ontological framework states that symbiosis is the\nnorm; it is not peripheral. These symbionts can act at different\nstages of the life cycle and are seen to scaffold development\n(Griesemer 2014; Chiu & Gilbert 2015; Minelli 2016). In\n\u2018scaffolding,\u2019 each developmental stage is made possible\nby entities and processes that catalyze these activities, which allows\nnovel and evolutionary relevant processes to occur at lower\ndifficulties and costs.\n\nA third ontological point concerns the exact nature of the link\nbetween development and evolution. Two approaches have been put\nforward: One draws on the idea that the biological entity that is\ncausally efficacious in both realms can only be found on the level of\nintegrated collectives of symbiotic interactions. Following in the\ntradition of Leibnitz\u2019 notion of compossibility as well as\nMargulis\u2019 (1999) claim that we live on a \u2018symbiotic\nplanet,\u2019 this view argues that symbiotic collectives are not\nonly essential units of development but also of evolution. This leads\nto a view of evolution that is not centered on interspecies conflict\nand competition between individuals (Huxley 1888; Williams 1966;\nDawkins 1976). Instead the entities that evolve are cooperative\nco-developing collectives (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016;\nRoughgarden et al. 2018; for discussion, see Peacock 2011;\nSu\u00e1rez 2018).\n\nA different ontological framework links\ndevelopment and evolution through the entity of the acting organism\n(Nicholson 2014, 2018; Walsh 2015; for discussion, see Pradeu 2016;\nBaedke 2019a, 2019b). These approaches usually are less related to\nsymbiosis research than to studies on niche construction or maternal\neffects. Here the organism (e.g., a beaver that builds a dam or an\nearthworm that processes the soil) is constructed as a self-determined\nagent that through its behavior modulates the selection pressures\nacting on it (Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Uller & Helanter\u00e4\n2019). Thus, so the argument goes, it can bias and direct population\ndynamics. The holobiont perspective and the niche construction\nperspective join together when one appreciates that the microbes and\nthe host form each other\u2019s environment. Here, the host and the\nmicrobes scaffold each other\u2019s development and evolution (Chiu\n& Gilbert 2015, 2020). \n\nWhether or not we consider collectives or organismic individual agents\nas the core entities partaking both in development and evolution,\nattempts to integrate the two realms have to show in each case that,\nin fact, it is the same unit that develops and evolves. In\nother words, if we want to unify development and evolution through the\nunit of the biological individual (being the one entity that partakes\nin both) this unit needs to meet criteria of both physiological (e.g.,\nmetabolic) and evolutionary individuality (see the entry on\n  biological individuals).\nEvolutionary individuals have been traditionally conceptualized as\nreproductive units with differential fitness and shared lineages\n(so-called \u2018Darwinian individuals\u2019; see Godfrey-Smith\n2009) or as units of selection (\u2018interactors\u2019; see Hull\n1980). Unfortunately, both of these units do not always coincide\n(Godfrey-Smith 2013; Pradeu 2016). For example, some organisms (holobionts) form developing\nbut no reproductive units, as they include a multitude of lineages\n(e.g., microbial ones). Other possible units of selection (like genes\nor populations) are not identical with physiological individuals.\nThus, a physiological individual may not necessarily be an\nevolutionary unit or vice versa.\n\nThis brings us to a fourth ontological point: developmental\nplasticity, which is considered to bias or even guide evolutionary\ntrajectories (West-Eberhard 2003; Radersma et al. forthcoming). The\nconcept of plasticity states that development can be regulated in\nimportant ways by the environment. This rules out genetic determinism\n(but not necessarily environmental determinism; see Waggoner and Uller\n2015). In the original conception of phenotype production (i.e.,\ndevelopment), Wilhelm Johannsen (1909) had pointed out that the phenotype\nis the product of both the genotype and environmental circumstance, and\nWoltereck (1909; see also Sarkar 1999) argued that what was inherited\nis the \u201cReaktionsnorm\u201d, a potential to generate\nphenotypic variations in response to environmental agents. In line with this view, many\nembryology texts in the late 1800s (e.g., Hertwig 1894) had promulgated the\nperspective that development demanded both the interactions between\nembryonic cells and the further interactions of those cells with the\nenvironment (see Nyhart 1995).\n\nDespite this history, developmental plasticity was marginalized as\ngenetic explanations came to the fore in the mid-20th century (Sarkar\n1998; Keller 2002). Against this background, embryologists such as\nLewis Wolpert (1994) could ask whether an organism\u2019s phenotype\ncould be computed if we had the total description of the egg. Due to\nthe above findings on organism-environment interaction (see section\n3), a different view emerged that more seriously considers the\nenvironmental-responsiveness and plasticity of the developing\nphenotype. This view includes a shift from externalist to internalist\nor constructionist understandings of the organism-environment\nrelationship (Godfrey-Smith 1996). While the externalist view \u2013\nthe orthodox view in evolutionary theory \u2013 conceptualizes\nproperties of organisms as a result of their environments (i.e.\nnatural selection targeting genetic programs), the internalist view\nsees \u201cone set of organic properties in terms of other internal\nor intrinsic properties of the organic system\u201d (Godfrey-Smith\n1996: 30). According to these two accounts, organisms occupy an\nenvironment that covaries with them or that is largely independent of\ntheir variation. The above research in developmental evolution\nsuggests a switch from an externalist to a constructionist\nperspective, in which the organism actively molds its internal states\nand responds to and alters its external environment (see Laland et al.\n2014, 2015). In addition, in this framework also the causal role of\nthe environment becomes more complex. It now includes the idea that\nthe environment has active agency that can determine the phenotype.\nRather than conceptualizing the environment as nothing but a passive\nfilter for evolution, in this view the environment plays a role in\nactuating the phenotype in addition to selecting it (Moczek 2015;\nGilbert & Epel 2015).\n",
