    "main_text": "The Harm Principle and Free Speech || John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle\n2.1 John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle\n\nGiven that Mill presented one of the first, and still perhaps the most\nfamous liberal defense of free speech, I will focus on his arguments\nin this essay and use them as a springboard for a more general\ndiscussion of free expression. In the footnote at the beginning of\nChapter II of On Liberty, Mill makes a very bold statement:\n\n\nIf the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there\nought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a\nmatter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be\nconsidered. (1978, 15)\n\n\nThis is a very strong defense of free speech; Mill tells us that\nany doctrine should be allowed the light of day no matter\nhow immoral it may seem to everyone else. And Mill does mean\neveryone: \n\nIf all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person\nwere of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in\nsilencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be\njustified in silencing mankind. (1978, 16)\n\n\nSuch liberty should exist with every subject matter so that we have\n\u201cabsolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,\npractical or speculative, scientific, moral or theological\u201d\n(1978, 11). Mill claims that the fullest liberty of expression is\nrequired to push our arguments to their logical limits, rather than\nthe limits of social embarrassment. Such liberty of expression is\nnecessary, he suggests, for the dignity of persons. If liberty of\nexpression is stifled, the price paid is \u201ca sort of intellectual\npacification\u201d that sacrifices \u201c the entire moral courage of the human\nmind\u201d (1978, 31).\n\nThese are powerful claims for freedom of speech, but as I noted above,\nMill also suggests that we need some rules of conduct to regulate the\nactions of members of a political community. The limitation he places\non free expression is \u201cone very simple principle\u201d (1978,\n9), now usually referred to as the harm principle, which states\nthat\n\n\u2026the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any\nmember of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm\nto others. (1978, 9)\n\n\nThere is a great deal of debate about what Mill had in mind when he\nreferred to harm; for the purposes of this essay he will be taken to\nmean that an action has to directly and in the first instance invade\nthe rights of a person (Mill himself uses the term rights, despite\nbasing the arguments in the book on the principle of utility). The\nlimits on free speech will be very narrow because it is difficult to\nsupport the claim that most speech causes harm to the rights of\nothers. This is the position staked out by Mill in the first two\nchapters of On Liberty and it is a good starting point for a\ndiscussion of free speech because it is hard to imagine a more liberal\nposition. Liberals are usually willing to contemplate limiting speech\nonce it can be demonstrated that it does invade the rights of\nothers.\n\nIf we accept Mill's argument we need to ask \u201cwhat types of\nspeech, if any, cause harm?\u201d Once we can answer this question,\nwe have found the appropriate limits to free expression. The example\nMill uses is in reference to corn dealers: he suggests that it is\nacceptable to claim that corn dealers starve the poor if such a view\nis expressed in print. It is not acceptable to make such statements to\nan angry mob, ready to explode, that has gathered outside the house of\nthe corn dealer. The difference between the two is that the latter is\nan expression \u201csuch as to constitute\u2026a positive\ninstigation to some mischievous act,\u201d (1978, 53), namely, to\nplace the rights, and possibly the life, of the corn dealer in danger.\nAs Daniel Jacobson (2000) notes, it is important to remember that Mill\nwill not sanction limits to free speech simply because someone is\nharmed. For example, the corn dealer may suffer severe financial\nhardship if he is accused of starving the poor. Mill distinguishes\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate harm, and it is only when speech\ncauses a direct and clear violation of rights that it can be limited.\nThe fact that Mill does not count accusations of starving the poor as\ncausing illegitimate harm to the rights of corn dealers suggests he\nwished to apply the harm principle sparingly. Other examples where the\nharm principle may apply include libel laws, blackmail, advertising\nblatant untruths about commercial products, advertising dangerous\nproducts to children (e.g. cigarettes), and securing truth in\ncontracts. In most of these cases, it is possible to show that harm\ncan be caused and that rights can be violated.\n",
