    "main_text": "The Psychological Basis for a Theory of Value || Good and Evil as Modes of Thinking\n3.2 The Psychological Basis for Perfectionism\n\n\nThe meaning of \u2018perfection\u2019 (perfectio) in\nvarious passages of the Ethics is obscured by the fact that\nSpinoza uses the term both in what he takes to be its common meaning\nand also in a narrow, formal sense. In some passages, such as IV\nPreface, Spinoza treats perfection, like good and evil, to be a label\nthat people apply to things, to be explained in terms of those\npeople\u2019s use of the label: people call a thing perfect which conforms\nto the model of the thing that they create for themselves. In other\npassages, however, Spinoza treats perfection as whatever is \u201cpositive\u201d\nor \u201creal\u201d in a thing, a genuine property, and this concept forms part\nof his formal apparatus (IId6).\n\n\nBoth senses of the term occur in Spinoza\u2019s analysis of human\nperfection. At IV Preface Spinoza invokes a concept of perfection\nbased upon a model of human nature that we set before ourselves. And\nSpinoza describes perfection of the human mind in terms of its power\nof thinking, as we have already seen, at IIIp11 and its scholium: the\nmind\u2019s power of thinking is its perfection; joy is an increase in that\npower or a passage to a greater perfection; and sadness is a decrease\nin that power or a passage to a lesser perfection.\n\n\nThus Spinoza has two different accounts of human perfection which\nmight contribute to the perfectionist language of the ethical argument\nthat he develops in various ways in Parts IV and V. Although the first\naccount contributes to both Spinoza\u2019s formal definitions of good and\nevil and also, probably, to the \u201cfree man\u201d propositions of Part IV, it\nis perhaps the second account which is of greater importance. It,\nafter all, resonates with Spinoza\u2019s account of the good at IIIp39s,\nand so comes to form part of a consistent moral view: if the good is\nany form of joy (IIIp39s) and joy is the passage to a greater\nperfection (IIIp11s), then the good is whatever makes us more\nperfect. On the other hand, the first account might imply a different\nset of norms from IIIp39s: it seems that we may have different models\nof human nature that we set before ourselves, and that they may or may\nnot include the various things that give us joy. Perhaps the formal\naccount of perfection at IId6 and later at IIIp11 give Spinoza a means\nof reformulating the idea of perfection as a model of human nature in\na way which reconciles the two senses of the term: the ideal we set\nbefore ourselves will be a person who possesses the greatest possible\npower of action. This would be, in effect, to correlate our\nsystematically distorted ways of perceiving ourselves\u2014as free\nagents pursuing as an end a model of human nature\u2014with the\ncauses that really determine our actions.\nOf course, the question of what an outside observer may infer from\nanother person\u2019s use of moral language, for example that what a person\nfinds good is something in which she anticipates pleasure or that\nmakes her more powerful, is different from the questions of what a\nperson using moral language takes that language to mean or what\nSpinoza takes moral language to mean. The analyses discussed here\ninvite reductionist interpretations, on which, for example\n\u201cgood\u201d just means pleasant, but the thesis that people\nconsistently find pleasant things good is perfectly consistent with\nany number of different theses about what they mean by that\ndesignation and about what it really means to be good. Reconciling\nSpinoza\u2019s psychological theses about moral language use in Part III of\nthe Ethics with what appear to straightforward, richer and\nnon-reductive theses about morality in Parts IV and V is one of the\nbiggest challenges facing interpreters of Spinoza.\n\nFurther Reading: Curley 1988, Delahunty\n1985, Garrett 1996, Yovel 1999, LeBuffe 2010a, Chapters 8 and 9, and\nKisner 2010 offer accounts of Spinoza\u2019s ethical language as it relates\nto his psychology.
