    "main_text": "Coincidence || Temporary Coincidence\n4.1 Temporary Coincidence\n\nIn some puzzle cases it seems that two objects occupy the same place\nat the same time, but not forever: one or both of them exist either\nbefore or after the period of coincidence. For example, suppose you\ntake a lump of clay, and by moulding and shaping it create a statue,\nwhich you place proudly on a plinth. What\u2019s on the plinth? Well,\nthe statue is. Is the original lump of clay also on the plinth? It\nseems so: you didn\u2019t destroy or even damage the lump of clay\njust by changing its shape. So are there are two statue-shaped things\non the plinth, a statue and a lump of clay? On the one hand it seems\ndaft to count these as two different objects. But on the other hand\nthey do seem different: the lump of clay is older than the statue, for\nexample, and perhaps it makes sense to describe the statue as\n\u2018well-made\u2019 or as \u2018yet another derivative bit of\nart-as-therapy\u2019, while the lump of clay is neither well-made nor\nderivative: it was just dug out of the garden. These differences\nsuggest that the lump of clay and the statue are two different things,\noccupying the same place at the same time.\n\nThis argument is sometimes expressed using Leibniz\u2019s Law, the\nprinciple which says that if objects differ in their properties, they\ncannot be one and the same thing. Leibniz\u2019s Law should be\ndistinguished from the more controversial Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles, which says that if objects share all their properties,\nthey must be one and the same thing. (See the separate entry on the\n identity of indiscernibles.)\n\nSimilar examples of temporary coincidence can arise when objects gain\nor lose parts. Tibbles the cat is made of the usual catty parts,\nincluding a tail, and a tail-complement, i.e., all of Tibbles except\nfor her tail. A tail-complement is a slightly strange object, but\nit\u2019s rather like a torso, i.e., all of an animal except for its\nlimbs and head. Tibbles has a whimsical owner, who names the\ntail-complement \u2018Tib\u2019. One eventful day, Tibbles loses her\ntail in an accident: she shrinks to become exactly the same size and\nshape as Tib. On the one hand it seems daft to count Tibbles and Tib\nas two different objects after the accident. But on the other hand\nthey do seem different: Tibbles has been a cat for years, unlike Tib,\nand Tibbles is her owner\u2019s favourite animal, while perhaps we\ncannot say this of Tib. These differences suggest that, after the\naccident, Tibbles and Tib are two different things occupying the same\nplace at the same time.\n\n(Related problems about cats and their parts are dealt with in the\nseparate entry on the\n problem of the many.)\n\nWhat have these puzzles about temporary coincidence got to do with\ntemporal parts? If we accept that statues, lumps of clay, cats, tails\nand tail-complements all have temporal parts, then we can tell a\ncoherent story about these cases. This should tempt us to believe in\ntemporal parts, unless endurantists can come up with a good story of\ntheir own. Let\u2019s look at the perdurantist and endurantist\nstories in turn.\n\nCentral to the perdurantist account of temporary coincidence is the\nclaim that, while it is bizarre to think that two distinct objects\ncould entirely coincide, there is nothing bizarre about two objects\npartially coinciding by sharing a part, and nothing bizarre about an\nobject partially coinciding with one of its own parts. Recall the\nexample of you and your conjoined twin. If you share a hand, there is\nno puzzle about how you can both be in the same glove without jostling\nfor space: you and your twin partially coincide by sharing a part. And\nthink of your left foot: there is no mystery about how you and your\nfoot can both be in the same sock, nor about how you can be partially\nin the same place as your own foot. According to perdurantists, cases\nof temporary coincidence involve objects which partially overlap by\nsharing temporal parts, or objects which partially overlap because one\nis a temporal part of the other (we can think of this as a limiting\ncase of sharing parts).\n\nThink of the lump of clay and the statue. Suppose you formed the lump\nout of smaller bits on Monday, made it into a statue on Wednesday,\nthen smashed the thing to pieces on Sunday. According to\nperdurantists, the lump of clay is a week-long four-dimensional\nobject, and the statue is a five-day-long four-dimensional object.\nIndeed, the statue is a temporal part of the lump of clay, composed of\nsome of the instantaneous temporal parts which compose the lump. Now,\nhow many statue-shaped things are on the plinth on Thursday? Well, the\nlump of clay and the statue both have a temporal part sitting on the\nplinth on Thursday, so they\u2019re both partially on the plinth on\nThursday. But neither the lump nor the statue is wholly there on the\nplinth on Thursday. This explains both our intuition that\nthere\u2019s only one object there (there\u2019s just the one\narty-looking temporal part at any given moment) and our intuition that\nthe statue and the lump are different objects with different\nproperties (they occupy different four-dimensional regions).\n\nMuch the same can be said for Tib and Tibbles. Tib and Tibbles are\nboth long-lasting four-dimensional objects, according to\nperdurantists. Before the accident, at any given moment a temporal\npart of Tib is a spatial part of a temporal part of Tibbles. After the\naccident, Tib and Tibbles share temporal parts. But there\u2019s no\nmystery as to how Tib and Tibbles can coincide after the accident yet\nstill be different things: neither the whole Tib nor the whole Tibbles\nis there, just some of their shared temporal parts.\n\nObjections to the perdurance account of temporary coincidence focus on\nmore general (alleged) difficulties for perdurantism; on whether the\naccount can generalise to cope with all coincidence problems (see\n section 4.2);\n and on whether it can explain why we are happy to call the statue but\nnot the lump \u2018well-made\u2019 or \u2018derivative\u2019.\nThere are also specific objections to the perdurance account of cases\nof temporary coincidence which involve people (see\n section 9\n for these). What can endurantists come up with instead?\n\nOne popular endurantist option is simply to accept that two different\nobjects can wholly occupy exactly the same location at the same time.\nThis view is sometimes called the \u2018standard account\u2019 of\ncoincidence. The relationship between wholly-coinciding objects is\noften called \u2018constitution\u2019, and so the slogan of the\nstandard account is \u2018constitution is not identity\u2019. The\nlump of clay constitutes the statue, so they do not have to jostle for\nspace, but they are distinct objects, so they can differ in their age,\nin whether they are derivative, and so on. (Beware: the\nsimilar-sounding \u2018composition is not identity\u2019 usually\nrepresents the quite different view that a whole is not identical to\nits several parts.)\n\nThe examples we have seen so far involve coincidence between objects\nof different kinds: a cat and a tail-complement, a statue and a lump\nof clay. According to some versions of the standard account,\nconstitution is always a one-way relationship: the lump constitutes\nthe statue, but not vice versa. Accounts without this restriction can\nbe sympathetic to coincidence between objects of the same kind. This\nmay occur, for example, if objects of the same kind can\n\u2018merge\u2019 without losing their identity, or if what looks\nlike a single object can \u2018divide\u2019 into two of the same\nkind (some versions of the \u2018ship of Theseus\u2019 problem have\nthis form). The most intriguing imagined cases of fusion and fission\ninvolve people, and will be discussed briefly in\n section 9.\n (The claim that same-kind coincidence is impossible is sometimes\ncalled \u2018Locke\u2019s thesis\u2019.)\n\nOpponents of the standard account make the following objections: it\nrequires just too many objects (a particular problem in vague cases,\nsee\n section 5);\n it entails that when a 1kg statue is constituted by a distinct 1kg\nlump, the result ought to weigh 2kg; and, most seriously, it fails to\nexplain how two distinct objects, made of the same parts and matter,\narranged in the same way and at the same place and time, can be\ndistinct objects with different properties. How could all these facts\nabout the arrangement of parts fail to fix the facts about the\nwhole?\n\nDefenders of the standard account make various responses.\u00a0\nRegarding the \u2018too many objects\u2019 accusation, some point\nout that perdurantists require even more objects when you count up all\nthe temporal parts, some attempt to establish principled limits on how\nmany objects are required, and others simply accept the\nmultitude.\u00a0 After all, it\u2019s not so bad having all those\nobjects when you realise they don\u2019t all need separate locations.\nThe response to the objection about mass turns on an analogy with\nordinary parts and wholes: your various internal organs and limbs\nweigh several kilos each, but we wouldn\u2019t expect these to show\nup on the scales in addition to your total body mass, since you are\nmade of the same stuff as your organs and limbs. Likewise, supposedly,\nalthough the lump and the statue are distinct 1kg objects, we\nshouldn\u2019t expect these to show up separately on the scales,\nsince they are made of the same stuff.\n\nExplanations of how coinciding objects can have different properties\nvary with different versions of the standard account. Some claim that\ncoinciding objects share all their parts (and are parts of one\nanother). Others claim that, for example, the arm of the statue is not\npart of the lump of clay, although there may be an arm-shaped lump of\nclay which constitutes the statue-arm and is part of the bigger lump\nof clay. But a couple of themes recur in defences of the standard\naccount: first, there is an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Why\nexpect all the properties of a composite object to be\ndetermined by the identity, properties and interrelations of its\npresent parts? Second, there is the point that, although the standard\naccount entails that objects made of the same parts may differ, there\nis no arbitrariness here. Not every object made of suitably-arranged\nparticles of clay is a lump of clay, for some are statues, but\nwhenever there are suitably-arranged particles of clay, there is a\nlump of clay.\n\nThose who find these explanations unsatisfactory and thereby reject\nthe standard account needn\u2019t become perdurantists, however, for\nthere are several less-popular endurantist accounts of temporary\ncoincidence. Perhaps identity can be temporary: the statue and the\nlump are identical once the statue exists, although the lump was not\nalways identical to the statue; Tib and Tibbles begin as\nnon-identical, and become identical. This proposal requires us to\nchange our views of identity, and of the connection between identity\nand sharing of properties. Or perhaps objects can be destroyed more\neasily than we had realised: the lump of clay ceases to exist when the\nstatue is created (it is replaced by a new, statue-shaped lump of\nclay, made from the same clay particles); the cat\u2019s\ntail-complement ceases to exist when it is separated from the\ntail.\n\nOr perhaps we should be more restrictive about the kinds of object we\naccept into our ontology. After all, a tail-complement seemed like a\ndubious object from the beginning, and if there is no such thing as\nTib, we don\u2019t have to explain what relationship holds between\nTib and Tibbles (we may grandly deny that cats have \u2018arbitrary\nundetached parts\u2019). Similarly, perhaps it is a mistake to think\nthat there literally are such things as statues and lumps of clay, as\nopposed to mere quantities of stuff or pluralities of particles.\nRestrictive ontologies come in different strengths: accepting only\npartless objects and living organisms; accepting only partless objects\nand those composite objects which are \u2018greater than the sum of\ntheir parts\u2019; accepting only partless objects; accepting only\n\u2018stuff\u2019 or matter and not objects at all; accepting only\n\u2018proper\u2019 objects and not quantities of stuff.\u00a0\nDifficulties here include reconciling such radical claims with our\neveryday beliefs, and, for the more moderate versions, ensuring that\neach and every possible case of coincidence really has been ruled\nout.\n\nFurther discussion of these and other options can be found in the\nseparate entry on\n relative identity.\n",
