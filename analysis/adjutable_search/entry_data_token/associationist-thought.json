What is Associationism?\nAssociationism is a theory that connects learning to thought based\non principles of the organism\u2019s causal history. Since its early\nroots, associationists have sought to use the history of an\norganism\u2019s experience as the main sculptor of cognitive\narchitecture. In its most basic form, associationism has claimed that\npairs of thoughts become associated based on the organism\u2019s past\nexperience. So, for example, a basic form of associationism (such as\nHume\u2019s) might claim that the frequency with which an organism\nhas come into contact with Xs and Ys in one\u2019s\nenvironment determines the frequency with which thoughts\nabout Xs and thoughts about Ys will arise together\nin the organism\u2019s future.\nAssociationism\u2019s popularity is in part due to how many\ndifferent masters it can serve. In particular, associationism can be\nused as a theory of learning (e.g., as in behaviorist theorizing), a\ntheory of thinking (as in Jamesian \u201cstreams of thought\u201d),\na theory of mental structures (e.g., as in concept pairs), and a theory\nof the implementation of thought (e.g., as in connectionism). All these\ntheories are separable, but share a related, empiricist-friendly\ncore. As used here, a \u201cpure associationist\u201d will refer to\none who holds associationist theories of learning, thinking, mental\nstructure, and implementation. The \u201cpure associationist\u201d\nis a somewhat idealized position, one that no particular theorist may\nhave ever held, but many have approximated to differing degrees (e.g.,\nLocke 1690/1975; Hume 1738/1975; Thorndike 1911; Skinner 1953; Hull\n1943; Churchland 1986, 1989; Churchland and Sejnowski 1990; Smolensky\n1988; Elman 1991; Elman et al. 1996; McClelland et al. 2010; Rydell\nand McConnell 2006; Fazio 2007).\nOutside of these core uses of associationism the movement has also\nbeen closely aligned with a number of different doctrines over the\nyears: empiricism, behaviorism, anti-representationalism (i.e.,\nskepticism about the necessity of representational realism in\npsychological explanation), gradual learning, and domain-general\nlearning. All of these theses are dissociable from core associationist\n thought (see section 7). While one\ncan be an associationist without holding those theses, some of those\ntheses imply associationism to differing degrees. These extra\ntheses\u2019 historical and sociological ties to associationism are\nstrong, and so will be intermittently discussed below.\n2. Associationism as a Theory of Mental Processes: The Empiricist Connection\nEmpiricism is a general theoretical outlook, which tends to offer a\ntheory of learning to explain as much of our mental life as possible.\nFrom the British empiricists through Skinner and the behaviorists\n (see the entry on behaviorism) the main focus\nhas been arguing for the acquisition of concepts (for the\nempiricists\u2019 \u201cIdeas\u201d, for the behaviorists\n\u201cresponses\u201d) through learning. However, the mental\nprocesses that underwrite such learning are almost never themselves\n posited to be learned.[1]\nSo winnowing down the amount of mental\nprocesses one has to posit limits the amount of innate machinery with which the\ntheorist is saddled. Associationism, in its original form as in\nHume (1738/1975), was put forward as a theory of mental processes.\nAssociationists\u2019 attempt to answer the question of how many\nmental processes there are by positing only a single mental\n process: the ability to associate \nideas.[2]\nOf course, thinkers execute many different types of cognitive acts,\nso if there is only one mental process, the ability to associate, that\nprocess must be flexible enough to accomplish a wide range of\ncognitive work. In particular, it must be able to account for learning\nand thinking. Accordingly, associationism has been utilized on both\nfronts. We will first discuss the theory of learning and then, after\nanalyzing that theory and seeing what is putatively learned, we will\nreturn to the associationist theory of thinking.\n3. Associationism as a Theory of Learning\nIn one of its senses, \u201cassociationism\u201d refers to a\ntheory of how organisms acquire concepts, associative structures,\nresponse biases, and even propositional knowledge. It is commonly\nacknowledged that associationism took hold after the publishing of\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n (1690/1975).[3]\nHowever, Locke\u2019s comments on associationism were terse (though\nfertile), and did not address learning to any great degree. The first\nserious attempt to detail associationism as a theory of learning was\ngiven by Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature\n (1738/1975).[4]\nHume\u2019s associationism was, first and foremost, a theory\nconnecting how perceptions (\u201cImpressions\u201d) determined\ntrains of thought (successions of \u201cIdeas\u201d). Hume\u2019s\nempiricism, as enshrined in the Copy\n Principle,[5]\ndemanded that there were no Ideas in the mind that were not first\ngiven in experience. For Hume, the principles of association\nconstrained the functional role of Ideas once they were copied from\nImpressions: if Impressions IM1 and IM2 were associated in\nperception, then their corresponding Ideas, ID1 and ID2 would also\nbecome associated. In other words, the ordering of Ideas was\ndetermined by the ordering of the Impressions that caused the Ideas\nto arise.\nHume\u2019s theory then needs to analyze what types of associative\nrelations between Impressions mattered for determining the ordering\nof Ideas. Hume\u2019s analysis consisted of three types of\nassociative relations: cause and effect, contiguity, and\nresemblance. If two Impressions instantiated one of these associative\nrelations, then their corresponding Ideas would mimic the same\n instantiation.[6]\nFor instance, if Impression IM1 was cotemporaneous with Impression\nIM2, then (ceteris paribus) their corresponding Ideas, ID1\nand ID2, would become associated.\nAs stated, Hume\u2019s associationism was mostly a way of\ndetermining the functional profile of Ideas. But we have not yet said\nwhat it is for two Ideas to be associated (for that\n see section 4). Instead, one can see\nHume\u2019s contribution as introducing a very influential type of\nlearning\u2014associative learning\u2014for Hume\u2019s theory\npurports to explain how we learn to associate certain Ideas. We\ncan abstract away from Hume\u2019s framework of ideas and his\naccount of the specific relations that underlie associative learning,\nand state the theory of associative learning more generally: if two\ncontents of experiences, X and Y, instantiate some\nassociative relation, R, then those contents will become\nassociated, so that future activations of X will tend to\nbring about activations of Y. The associationist then has\nto explain what relation R amounts to. The Humean form of\nassociative learning (where R is equated with cause and\neffect, contiguity, or resemblance) has been hugely influential,\ninforming the accounts of those such as Jeremy Bentham, J.S. Mill,\n and Alexander Bain (see, e.g., the entries on\n John Stuart Mill and\n 19th Century Scottish Philosophy).[7]\nAssociative learning didn\u2019t hit its stride until the work of\nIvan Pavlov, which spurred the subsequent rise of the behaviorist\nmovement in psychology. Pavlov introduced the concept of classical\nconditioning as a modernized version of associative learning. For\nPavlov, classical conditioning was in part an experimental paradigm\nfor teaching animals to learn new associations between stimuli. The\ngeneral method of learning was to pair an unconditioned stimulus (US)\nwith a novel stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is just a stimulus\nthat instinctively, without training, provokes a response in an\norganism. Since this response is not itself learned, the response is\nreferred to as an \u201cunconditioned response\u201d (UR). In\nPavlov\u2019s canonical experiment, the US was a meat powder, as the\nsmell of meat automatically brought about salivation (UR) in his\ncanine subjects. The US is then paired with a neutral stimulus, such\nas a bell. Over time, the contiguity between the US and the neutral\nstimulus causes the neutral stimulus to provoke the same response as\nthe US. Once the bell starts to provoke salivation, the bell has\nbecome a \u201cconditioned stimulus\u201d (CS) and the salivating,\nwhen prompted by the bell alone, a \u201cconditioned response\u201d\n(CR). The associative learning here is learning to form new\nstimulus-response pairs between the bell and the\n salivation.[8]\nClassical conditioning is a fairly circumscribed process. It is a\n\u201cstimulus substitution\u201d paradigm where one stimulus can\nbe swapped for another to provoke a\n response.[9]\nHowever, the responses that are provoked are supposed to remain unchanged; all that\nchanges is the stimulus that gets associated with the response. Thus,\nclassical conditioning seemed to some to be too restrictive to\nexplain the panoply of novel behavior organisms appear to\n execute.[10]\nEdward Thorndike\u2019s research with cats in puzzle boxes\nbroadened the theory of associative learning by introducing the notion\nof consequences to associative learning. Thorndike expanded the notion\nof associative learning beyond instinctual behaviors and sensory\nsubstitution to genuinely novel behaviors. Thorndike\u2019s\nexperiments initially probed, e.g., how cats learned to lift a lever\nto escape the \u201cpuzzle boxes\u201d (the forbearer to\n\u201cSkinner boxes\u201d) that they were trapped in. The\ncats\u2019 behaviors, such as attempting to lift a lever, were not\nthemselves instinctual behaviors like the URs of Pavlov\u2019s\nexperiments. Additionally, the cats\u2019 behaviors were shaped by\nthe consequences that they brought on. For Thorndike it was because\nlifting the lever caused the door to open that the cats learned the\nconnection between the lever and the door. This new view of learning,\noperant conditioning (for the organism is \u201coperating\u201d on\nits environment), was not merely the passive learning of Pavlov, but a\nspecies-nonspecific, general, active theory of learning.\nThis research culminated in Thorndike\u2019s famous \u201cLaw of\nEffect\u201d (1911), the first canonical psychological law of\nassociationist learning. It asserted that responses that are\naccompanied by the organism feeling satisfied will, ceteris\nparibus, be more likely to be associated with the situation in\nwhich the behavior was executed, whereas responses that are\naccompanied with a feeling of discomfort to the animal\nwill, ceteris paribus, make the response less likely to\noccur when the organism encounters the same\n situation.[11]\nThe greater the positive or negative feelings produced, the greater\nthe likelihood that the behavior will be evinced. To this Thorndike\nadded the \u201cLaw of Exercise\u201d, that responses to situations\nwill, ceteris paribus, be more connected to those situations\nin proportion to the frequency of past pairings between situation and\nresponse. Thorndike\u2019s paradigm was popularized and extended by\nB.F. Skinner (see, e.g., Skinner 1953) who stressed the notion not\njust of consequences but of reinforcement as the basis of\nforming associations. For Skinner, a behavior would get associated\nwith a situation according to the frequency and strength of\nreinforcement that would arise as a consequence of the behavior.\nSince the days of Skinner, associative learning has come in many\ndifferent variations. But what all varieties should share with their\nhistorical predecessors is that associative learning is supposed to\nmirror the contingencies in the world without adding additional\nstructure to them (see section 9 for some examples of when supposedly associative theories smuggle in extra structure). The question of what contingencies associative\nlearning detects (that is, one\u2019s preferred analysis of what the\nassociative relation R is), is up for debate and changes\nbetween theorists.\nThe final widely shared, though less central, property of\nassociative learning concerns the domain generality of associative\nlearning. Domain generality\u2019s prevalence among associationists\nis due in large part to their traditional empiricist allegiances:\nexcising domain-specific learning mechanisms constrains the amount of\ninnate mental processes one has to posit. Thus it is no surprise to\nfind that both Hume and Pavlov assumed that associative learning could\nbe used to acquire associations between any contents, regardless of\nthe types of contents they were. For example, Pavlov writes,\nAny natural phenomenon chosen at will may be converted\ninto a conditioned stimulus. Any ocular stimulus, any desired sound,\nany odor, and the stimulation of any portion of the skin, whether by\nmechanical means or by the application of heat or cold never failed to\nstimulate the salivary glands. (Pavlov 1906: 615)\nFor Pavlov the content of the CS\ndoesn\u2019t matter. Any content will do, as long as it bears the\nright functional relationship in the organism\u2019s learning\nhistory. In that sense, the learning is domain general\u2014it\nmatters not what the content is, just the role it plays (for more on\nthis topic, see\n section 9.4).[12]\n4. Associationism as a Theory of Mental Structure\nAssociative learning amounts to a constellation of related views\nthat interprets learning as associating stimuli with responses (in\noperant conditioning), or stimuli with other stimuli (in classical\nconditioning), or stimuli with valences (in evaluative\nconditioning).[13] Associative learning accounts raise the question: when\none learns to associate contents X and Y because,\ne.g., previous experiences with Xs and Ys\ninstantiated R, how does one store the information\nthat X and Y are associated?[14] A highly contrived\nsample answer to this question would be that a thinker learns an\nexplicitly represented unconscious conditional rule that states\n\u201cwhen a token of x is activated, then also activate a\ntoken of y\u201d. Instead of such a highly intellectualized\nresponse, associationists have found a natural (though by no means\n necessary, see section 4.2) complementary\nview that the information is stored in an associative\nstructure.\nAn associative structure describes the type of bond that connects\n two distinct mental states.[15]\n An example of such a structure is the\n associative pair \nsalt/pepper.[16]\n The associative structure is defined, in\nthe first instance, functionally: if X and Y form\nan associative structure, then, ceteris paribus, activations\nof mental state X bring about mental state Y\nand vice versa without the mediation of any other\npsychological states (such as an explicitly represented rule telling\nthe system to activate a concept because its associate has been\n activated).[17]\nIn other words, saying that two concepts are associated amounts to\nsaying that there is a reliable, psychologically basic causal\nrelation that holds between them\u2014the activation of one of\nthe concepts causes the activation of the other. So, saying that\nsomeone harbors the structure\n salt/pepper amounts to saying that\nactivations of salt will cause activations of\n pepper (and vice\nversa) without the aid of any other cognitive states.\nAssociative structures are most naturally contrasted with\npropositional structures. A pure associationist is opposed to\npropositional structures\u2014strings of mental representations that\nexpress a proposition\u2014because propositionally structured mental\nrepresentations have structure over and above the mere associative\nbond between two concepts. Take, for example, the associative\nstructure\n green/toucan. This structure does not predicate green onto\ntoucan. If we know that a mind has an associative bond between\n green\nand\n toucan, then we know that activating one of those concepts leads\nto the activation of the other. A pure associative theory rules out\npredication, for propositional structures aren\u2019t just strings of\nassociations. \u201cAssociation\u201d (in associative structures)\njust denotes a causal relation among mental representations, whereas\npredication (roughly) expresses a relation between things in the world\n(or intentional contents that specify external relations). Saying that\nsomeone has an associative thought\n green/toucan tells you something\nabout the causal and temporal sequences of the activation of concepts\nin one\u2019s mind; saying that someone has the thought\n\n there is a green toucan\n tells you that a person is predicating greenness of a\nparticular toucan (see Fodor 2003: 91\u201394, for an expansion of\nthis point).\nAssociative structures needn\u2019t just hold between simple\nconcepts. One might have reason to posit associative structures\n between propositional elements (see section 5)\n or between concepts and valences (see section 8). \nBut none of the proceeding is meant to imply that all\nstructures are associative or propositional\u2014there are other\nrepresentational formats that the mind might harbor (e.g., analog\nmagnitudes or iconic structures; see Camp 2007; Quilty-Dunn forthcoming). For instance, not all semantically\nrelated concepts are harbored in associative structures. Semantically\nrelated concepts may in fact also be directly associated (as in\ndoctor/nurse) or they may not\n (as in\n horse/zebra; see Perea and Rosa\n2002). The\ndifference in structure is not just a theoretical possibility, as these\ndifferent structures have different functional profiles: for example,\nconditioned associations appear to last longer than semantic\nassociations do in subjects with dementia (Glosser and Friedman\n1991).\n4.1 Associative Symmetry\nThe analysis of associative structures implies that, ceteris\nparibus, associations are symmetric in their causal effects: if a\nthinker has a bond between\n salt/pepper,\n then\n salt should bring about\npepper just as well as\n\n pepper brings about\n salt (for extensive discussion of the symmetry point see Quilty-Dunn and Mandelbaum 2019). But all else is\nrarely equal. For example, behaviorists such as Thorndike, Hull, and\nSkinner knew that the order of learning affected the causal sequence\nof recall: if one is always hearing \u201csalt and pepper\u201d then\nsalt will be more poised to\n activate\n pepper than\n pepper to activate\nsalt. So, included in the ceteris paribus clause in the\nanalysis of associative structures is the idealization that the\nlearning of the associative elements was equally well randomized in\norder.\nSimilarly, associative symmetry is violated when there are\ndiffering amounts of associative connections between the individual\nassociated elements. For example, in the\n green/toucan case, most\nthinkers will have many more associations stemming from\n green than\nstemming from\n toucan. Suppose we have a thinker that only associates\ntoucan with\n green,\n but associates\n green with a large host of other\nconcepts (e.g.,\n grass,\n\n vegetables,\n tea,\n\n kermit,\n seasickness,\n\n moss,\nmold,\n lantern,\n\n ireland, etc). In this case one can expect that\n\n toucan\nwill more quickly activate\n green than\n\n green will activate\n toucan, for\nthe former bond will have its activation strength less weakened\namongst other associates than the latter will.\n4.2 Activation Maps of Associative Structure\nAn associative activation map (sometimes called a \u201cspreading\nactivation\u201d map, Collins and Luftus 1975) is a mapping for a\nsingle thinker of all the associative connections between\n concepts.[18]\nThere are many ways of operationalizing associative connections. In\nthe abstract, a psychologist will attempt to probe which concepts (or\nother mental elements) activate which other concepts (or\nelements). Imagine a subject who is asked to say whether a string of\nletters constitutes a word or not, which is the typical goal given to\nsubjects in a \u201clexical decision task\u201d. If a subject has\njust seen the word \u201cmouse\u201d, we assume that the concept  mouse was activated. If the subject is then quicker to say that, e.g.,\n\u201ccursor\u201d is a word than the subject is to say that\n\u201ctoaster\u201d is, then we can infer that\n cursor was primed,\nand is thus associatively related to \n mouse, in this thinker. Likewise,\nif we find that \u201crodent\u201d is also responded to\nquicker, then we know that\n rodent is associatively related to\nmouse. Using this procedure, one can generate an\nassociative mapping of a thinker\u2019s mind. Such a mapping would\nconstitute a mapping of the associative structures one harbors.\nHowever, to be a true activation map\u2014a true mapping of what\nconcepts facilitate what\u2014the mapping would also need to include\ninformation about the violations of symmetry between concepts.\n4.3 Relation Between Associative Learning and Associative Structures\nThe British Empiricists desired to have a thoroughgoing pure\nassociationist theory, for it allowed them to lessen the load of\ninnate machinery they needed to posit. Likewise, the behaviorists also\ntended to want a pure associationist theory (sometimes out of a\nsimilar empiricist tendency, other times because they were radical\nbehaviorists like Skinner, who banned all discussion of mental\nrepresentations). Pure associationists tend to be partial to a\nconnection that Fodor (2003) refers to as \u201cBare-Boned\nAssociation\u201d. The idea is that the current strength of an\nassociation connection between X and Y is\ndetermined, ceteris paribus, by the frequency of the past\nassociations of X and Y. As stated, Bare-Boned\nAssociation assumes that associative structures encode, at least\nimplicitly, the frequency of past associations of X\nand Y, and the strength of that associative bond is\ndetermined by the organism\u2019s previous history of\nexperiencing Xs and\n Ys.[19]\n In other words, the learning history of\npast associations determines the current functional profile of the\n corresponding associative \nstructures.[20]\nAlthough the picture sketched\nabove, where associative learning eventuates in associative\nstructure, is appealing for many, it is not forced upon\none, as there is no a priori reason to bar any type of\nstructure to arise from a particular type of learning. One may, for\nexample, gain propositional structures from associative learning (see\nMitchell et al. 2009 and Mandelbaum 2016 for arguments that\nthis is more than a mere logical possibility). This can happen in two\nways. In the first, one may gain an associative structure that has a\nproposition as one of its associates. Assume that every time\none\u2019s father came home he immediately made dinner. In such a\ncase one might associate the proposition\n daddy is home with the\nconcept\n dinner (that is one might acquire: \ndaddy is home/dinner). However,\n one might also just have a propositional\nstructure result from associative learning. If every time one\u2019s\nfather came home he made dinner, then one might just end up learning\nif daddy is home then dinner will come soon, which is a propositional\nstructure.\n4.4 Extinction and Counterconditioning\nThere is a different, tighter relationship between associative\nlearning and associative structures concerning how to modulate an\nassociation. Associative theorists, especially from Pavlov onward,\nhave been clear on the functional characteristics necessary to\nmodulate an already created association. There have been two generally\nagreed upon routes: extinction\nand counterconditioning. Suppose that, through associative\nlearning, you have learned to associate a CS with a US. How do we\nbreak that association? Associationists have posited that one breaks\nan associative structure via two different types of\nassociative learning (/unlearning). Extinction is the name\nfor one such process. During extinction one decouples the external\npresentation of the CS and the US by presenting the CS without the US\n(and sometimes the US without the CS). Over time, the organism will\nlearn to disconnect the CS and US.\nCounterconditioning names a similar process to extinction,\nthough one which proceeds via a slightly different method.\nCounterconditioning can only occur when an organism has an\nassociation between a mental representation and a valence, as\nacquired in an evaluative conditioning paradigm. Suppose that one\nassociates\n ducks with a positive valence. To break this association\nvia counterconditioning one introduces ducks not with a lack of\npositive valence (as would happen in extinction) but with the\nopposite valence, a negative valence. Over multiple\nexposures, the initial representation/valence association weakens,\n and is perhaps completely \nbroken.[21]\nHow successful extinction and counterconditioning are, and how they\nwork, is the source of some controversy, and some reason to see both methods as highly ineffectual (Bouton 2004). Although the traditional\nview is that extinction breaks associative bonds, it is an open\nempirical question whether extinction proceeds by breaking the\npreviously created associative bonds, or whether it proceeds by\nleaving that bond alone but creating new, more salient (and perhaps\ncontext-specific) associations between the CS and other mental states (Bouton 2002, Bendana and Mandelbaum forthcoming). Additionally, reinstatement, the spontaneous\nreappearance of an associative bond after seemingly successful\nextinction, has been observed in many contexts (see, e.g., Dirikx et\nal. 2004 for\n reinstatement of fear in \nhumans).[22]\nOne fixed point in this debate is that one reverses associative\nstructures via these two types of associative learning/unlearning, and\nonly via these two pathways. What one does not do is try to\nbreak an associative structure by using practical or theoretical\nreasoning. If you associate\n salt with\n pepper, then telling you that\nsalt has nothing to do with pepper or giving you very good reasons\nnot to associate the two (say, someone will give you $50,000 for not\nassociating them) won\u2019t affect the association. This much has at\nleast been clear since Locke. In the Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding, in his chapter \u201cOn the Association of\nIdeas\u201d (chapter XXIII) he writes,\n\nWhen this combination is settled, and while it lasts, it is not in\nthe power of reason to help us, and relieve us from the effects of it.\nIdeas in our minds, when they are there, will operate according to\ntheir natures and circumstances. And here we see the cause why time\ncures certain affections, which reason, though in the right, and\nallowed to be so, has not power over, nor is able against them to\nprevail with those who are apt to hearken to it in other\ncases. (2.23.13)\n\nLikewise, say one has just eaten lutefisk and then vomited. The\nsmell and taste of lutefisk will then be associated with feeling\nnauseated, and no amount of telling one that they shouldn\u2019t be\nnauseated will be very effective. Say the lutefisk that made one\nvomit was covered in poison, so that we know that the lutefisk\nwasn\u2019t the root cause of the\n sickness.[23]\nHaving this knowledge won\u2019t dislodge the association. In\nessence, associative structures are functionally defined as being\nfungible based on counterconditioning, extinction, and nothing\nelse. Thus, assuming one sees counterconditioning and extinction as\ntypes of associative learning, we can say that associative learning\ndoes not necessarily eventuate in associative structures, but\nassociative structures can only be modified by associative\nlearning.\n5. Associative Transitions\nSo far we\u2019ve discussed learning and mental structures, but\nhave yet to discuss thinking. The pure associationist will\nwant a theory that covers not just acquisition and cognitive\nstructure, but also the transition between thoughts. Associative\ntransitions are a particular type of thinking, akin to what William\nJames called \u201cThe Stream of Thought\u201d (James\n1890). Associative transitions are movements between thoughts that are\nnot predicated on a prior logical relationship between the elements of\nthe thoughts that one connects. In this sense, associative transitions\nare contrasted with computational transitions as analyzed by the\nComputational Theory of Mind (Fodor 2001; Quilty-Dunn and Mandelbaum 2018,2019; see\n the entry on Computational Theory of Mind). \nCTM understands inferences as truth preserving\nmovements in thought that are underwritten by the formal/syntactic\nproperties of thoughts. For example inferring the conclusion\nin modus ponens from the premises is possible just based on\nthe form of the major and minor premise, and not on the content of the\npremises. Associative transitions are transitions in thought that are\nnot based on the logico-syntactic properties of thoughts. Rather, they\nare transitions in thought that occur based on the associative\nrelations among the separate thoughts.\nImagine an impure associationist model of the mind, one that\ncontains both propositional and associative structures. A\ncomputational inference might be one such as inferring \nyou are a g from the thoughts \nif you are an f, then you are a g, and \nyou are an f. However, an associative\ntransition is just a stream of ideas that needn\u2019t have any\nformal, or even rational, relation between them, such as the\ntransition from \nthis coffee shop is cold to russia should annex idaho, \nwithout there being any intervening thoughts. This transition\ncould be subserved merely by one\u2019s association of\n idaho and\ncold, or it could happen because the two thoughts have tended to\nco-occur in the past, and their close temporal proximity caused an\nassociation between the two thoughts to arise (or for many other\nreasons). Regardless of the etiology, the transition doesn\u2019t\noccur on the basis of the formal properties of the\n thoughts.[24]\nAccording to this taxonomy, talk of an \u201cassociative\ninference\u201d (e.g., Anderson et al. 1994; Armstrong et al. 2012)\nis a borderline oxymoron. The easiest way to give sense to the idea of\nan associative inference is for it to involve transitions in thought\nthat began because they were purely inferential (as understood by the\ncomputational theory of mind) but then became associated over\ntime. For example, at first one might make the modus ponens\ninference because a particular series of thoughts instantiates\nthe modus ponens form. Over time the premises and conclusion of that\nparticular token of a modus ponens argument become associated\nwith each other through their continued use in that inference and now\nthe thinker merely associates the premises with the conclusion. That\nis, the constant contiguity between the premises and the conclusion\noccurred because the inference was made so frequently, but the\ninference was originally made so frequently not because of the\nassociative relations between the premises and conclusion, but because\nthe form of the thoughts (and the particular motivations of the\nthinker). This constant contiguity then formed the basis for an\nassociative linkage between the premises and the conclusion. [25]\nAs was the case for associative structures, associative transitions\nin thought are not just a logical possibility. There are particular\nempirical differences associated with associative transitions versus\ninferential transitions. Associative transitions tend to move across\ndifferent content domains, whereas inferential transitions tend to\nstay on a more focused set of contents. These differences have been\nseen to result in measurable differences in mood: associative thinking\nacross topics bolsters mood when compared to logical thinking on a\nsingle topic (Mason and Bar 2012).\n6. Associative Instantiation\nThe associationist position so far has been neutral on how\nassociations are to be implemented. Implementation can be seen at a\nrepresentational (that is psychological) level of explanation, or at\nthe neural level. A pure associationist picture would posit an\nassociative implementation base at one, or both, of these\n levels.[26]\nThe most well-known associative instantiation base is a class of\nnetworks called Connectionist networks (see\n the entry on connectionism). \nConnectionist networks are sometimes pitched at the\npsychological level (see, e.g., Elman 1991; Elman et al. 1996;\nSmolensky 1988). This amounts to the claim that models of algorithms\nembedded in the networks capture the essence of certain mental\nprocesses, such as associative learning. Other times connectionist\nnetworks are said to be models of neural activity (\u201cneural\nnetworks\u201d). Connectionist networks consist in sets of nodes,\ngenerally input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Input nodes\nare taken to be analogs of sensory neurons (or sub-symbolic sensory\nrepresentations), output nodes the analog of motor neurons (or\nsub-symbolic behavioral representations), and hidden nodes are\n stand-ins for all other\n neurons.[27]\n The network consists in these nodes\nbeing connected to each other with varying strengths. The topology of\nthe connections gives one an associative mapping of the system, with\nthe associative weights understood as the differing strengths of\nconnections. On the psychological reading, these associations are\nfunctionally defined; on the neurological reading, they are generally\nunderstood to be representing synaptic conductance (and are the\nanalogs of dendrites).[28] Prima facie, these networks are\npurely associative and do not contain propositional elements, and the\nnodes themselves are not to be equated with single representational\nstates (such as concepts; see, e.g., Gallistel and King 2009).\nHowever, a connectionist network can implement a classical Turing\nmachine architecture (see, e.g., Fodor and McLaughlin\n1990; Chalmers 1993). Many, if not most, of the\nadherents of classical computation, for example proponents of CTM,\nthink that the brain is an associative network, one which implements a\nclassical computational program. Some adherents of CTM do deny that\nthe brain runs an associative network (see, e.g., Gallistel and King\n2009, who appear to deny that there is any scientific level of\nexplanation that association is intimately involved in), but they do\nso on separate empirical grounds and not because of any logical\ninconsistency with an associative brain implementing a classical\nmind.\nWhen discussing an associative implementation base it is important\nto distinguish questions of associationist structure from questions of\nrepresentational reality. Connectionists have often been followers of\nthe Skinnerian anti-representationalist tradition (Skinner 1938).\nBecause of the distributed nature of the nodes in connectionist\nnetworks, the networks have tended to be analyzed as associative\nstimulus/response chains of subsymbolic elements. However, the\nquestion of whether connectionist networks have representations which\nare distributed in patterns of activity throughout different nodes of\nthe network, or whether connectionist networks are best understood as\ncontaining no representational structures at all, is orthogonal to\nboth the question of whether the networks are purely associative or\ncomputational, and whether the networks can implement classical\narchitectures.\n7. Relation between the Varieties of Association and Related Positions\nThese four types of associationism share a certain empiricist\nspiritual similarity, but are logically, and empirically, separable.\nThe pure associationist who wants to posit the smallest number of\ndomain-general mental processes will theorize that the mind consists\nof associative structures acquired by associative learning which enter\ninto associative transitions and are implemented in an associative\ninstantiation base. However, many hybrid views are available and\nfrequently different associationist positions become mixed and\nmatched, especially once issues of empiricism, domain-specificity, and\ngradual learning arise. Below is a partial taxonomy of where some\nwell-known theorists lie in terms of associationism and these other,\noften related doctrines.\nPrinz (2002) and Karmiloff-Smith\n(1995) are examples of\nempiricist non-associationists. It is rare to find an associationist\nwho is a nativist, but plenty of nativists have aspects of\nassociationism in their own work. For example, even the arch-nativist\nJerry Fodor maintains that intramodular lexicons contain associative\nstructures (Fodor 1983). Similarly, there are many non-behaviorist\n(at least non-radical, analytic, or methodological behaviorist)\nassociationists, such as Elman (1991), Smolensky (1988), Baeyens (De\nHouwer and Baeyens 2001), and modern day dual process theorists such as\nEvans and Stanovich (2013). It is quite difficult to find a\nnon-associationist behaviorist, though Tolman approximates one\n(Tolman 1948). Elman and Smolensky also qualify as\nrepresentationalist associationists, and Van Gelder (1995) as an\nanti-representationalist non-associationist. Karmiloff-Smith\n(1995) can be\ninterpreted as, for some areas of learning, a proponent of gradual\nlearning without being associationist (some might also read\ncontemporary Bayesian theorists, e.g., Tenenbaum et al. 2011 and\nChater et al. 2006 as holding a similar position for some areas of\nlearning). Rescorla (1988) and Heyes (2012) claim to be\nassociationists who are pro step-wise, one shot learning (though\nRescorla sees his project as a continuation of the classical\nconditioning program, others see his data as grist for the\nanti-associationist, pro-computationalist mill, see Gallistel and\nKing 2009; Quilty-Dunn and Mandelbaum 2019). Lastly, Tenenbaum and his contemporary Bayesians\ncolleagues sometimes qualify as holding a domain-general learning\nposition without it being\n associationist.[29]\n8. Associationism in Social Psychology\nSince the cognitive revolution, associationism\u2019s influence\nhas mostly died out in cognitive psychology and\npsycholinguistics. This is not to say that all aspects of associative\ntheorizing are dead in these areas; rather, they have just taken on\nmuch smaller, more peripheral roles (for example, it has often been suggested that\nmental lexicons are structured, in part, associatively, which is why\nlexical decision tasks are taken to be facilitation maps of\none\u2019s lexicon). In other areas of cognitive psychology (for\nexample, the study of causal cognition), associationism is no longer\nthe dominant theoretical paradigm, but vestiges of associationism still persist (see Shanks 2010 for an overview of associationism\nin causal cognition). Associationism is also still alive in the\nconnectionist literature, as well as in the animal cognition\ntradition.\nBut the biggest contemporary stronghold of associationist\ntheorizing resides in social psychology, an area which has\ntraditionally been hostile to associationism (see, e.g., Asch 1962,\n1969). The ascendance of associationism in social psychology has been\na fairly modern development, and has caused a revival of\nassociationist theories in philosophy (e.g., Madva and Brownstein 2019). The two\nareas of social psychology that have seen the greatest renaissance of\nassociationism are the implicit attitude and dual-process theory\nliterature. However, in the late 2010s social psychology has begun to take a critical look at associationist theories (e.g., Mann et al. 2019).\n8.1 Implicit Attitudes\nImplicit attitudes are generally operationally defined as the attitudes tested on implicit tests such as the Implicit Association Test\n(Greenwald et al. 1998), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne et\nal. 2005), the Sorted Paired Feature Task (Bar-Annan et al. 2009) and\nthe Go/No-Go Association Task (Nosek and Banaji 2001). Implicit attitudes are contrasted with explicit attitudes, attitudes operationalized as the one\u2019s being probed when one gives an explicit response like a marking on a Likert scale, feeling thermometer, or in free report. Such operationalizations leave open the question of whether there are any natural kinds to which explicit and implicit attitudes refer. In general implicit attitudes are characterized as being mental\nrepresentations that are unavailable for explicit report and inaccessible to consciousness (cf. Hahn et al. 2014; Berger 2020).\n\nThe default position among social psychologists is to treat implicit attitudes as\nif they are associations among mental representations (Fazio 2007), or\namong pairs of mental representations and valences. In particular,\nthey treat implicit attitudes as associative structures which enter\ninto associative transitions. Recently this issue has come under much\ndebate. In an ever expanding series of studies De Houwer and his collaborators have taken to show that associative learning is, at base, relational, propositional contingency learning; i.e., that all putatively associative learning is in fact a nonautomatic learning process that generates and evaluates propositional hypotheses (Mitchell et al. 2009; De Houwer 2009, 2011, 2014 2019; Hughes et al. 2019). Other researchers have approached the question also using learning as the entrance point to the debate, demonstrating effects that non-associative acquisition creates stronger attitudes than associative acquisition (Hughes et al. 2019). For example, one might demonstrate that learning through merely reading an evaluative statement creates a stronger implicit attitude than repeated associative exposures (Kurdi and Banaji 2017, 2019; Mann et al. 2019). Other researchers have championed propositional models not based on learning, but instead based on how implicit attitudes change regardless of how they are acquired. For instance, Mandelbaum (2016) argued that logical/evidential interventions modulate implicit attitudes in predictable ways (e.g., using double negation to cancel each other out), while others have used diagnosticity to show that implicit attitudes update in a non-associationistic, propositional way (e.g., after reading a story about a man who broke into a building and appeared to ransack it you learn that we jumped into save people from a fire and immediately change your opinion of the man from negative to positive; Mann and Ferguson 2015; Mann et al. 2017; Van Dessel et al. 2019). (For more on implicit attitudes see the entry\non\n  implicit bias).\n8.2 Dual Process Theories\nAssociative structures and transitions are widely implicated in a\nparticular type of influential dual-process theory. Though there are\nmany dual-process theories in social psychology (see, e.g., the papers\nin Chaiken and Trope 1999, or the discussion in Evans and Stanovich\n2013), the one most germane to associationism is also the most\npopular. It originates from work in the psychology of reasoning and\nis often also invoked in the heuristics and biases tradition (see,\ne.g., Kahneman 2011). It has been developed by many different\npsychological theorists (Sloman 1996; Smith and Decoster 2000; Wilson\net al. 2000;\nEvans and Stanovich 2013) and, in parts, taken up by\nphilosophers too (see, e.g., Gendler 2008; Frankish 2009; see also\nsome of the essays in Evans and Frankish 2009).\nThe dual-process strain most relevant to the current discussion\nposits two systems, one evolutionarily ancient intuitive system\nunderlying unconscious, automatic, fast, parallel and associative\nprocessing, the other an evolutionarily recent reflective system\ncharacterized by conscious, controlled, slow,\n\u201crule-governed\u201d serial processes (see, e.g., Evans and\nStanovich 2013). The\nancient system, sometimes called \u201cSystem 1\u201d, is often\nunderstood to include a collection of autonomous, distinct\nsubsystems, each of which is recruited to deal with distinct types of\nproblems (see Stanovich 2011 for a discussion of\n\u201cTASS\u2014the autonomous set of systems\u201d). Although\ntheories differ on how System 1 interacts with System\n 2,[30] the\ntheoretical core of System 1 is arguing that its processing is\nessentially associative. As in the implicit attitude debate, dual\nsystems models have recently come under fire (see Kruglanski 2013;\nOsman 2013; Mandelbaum 2016; De Houwer 2019), though they remain very\npopular.\n9. Criticisms of Associationism\nAssociationism has been a dominant theme in mental theorizing for\ncenturies. As such, it has garnered an appreciable amount of\ncriticism.\n9.1 Learning Curves\nThe basic associative learning theories imply, either explicitly or\nimplicitly, slow, gradual learning of associations (Baeyens et al.\n1995). The learning process can be summarized in a learning curve\nwhich plots the frequency (or magnitude) of the conditioned response\nas a function of the number of reinforcements (Gallistel et al. 2004:\n13124). Mappings between CRs and USs are gradually built up over\nnumerous trials (in the lab) or experiences (in the world). Gradual,\nslow learning has come under fire from a variety of areas (see sections 9.3 and 9.4.1). However, here we just\nfocus on the behavioral data. In a series of works re-analyzing animal\nbehavior, Gallistel (Gallistel et al. 2004; Gallistel and King 2009)\nhas argued that although group-level learning curves do\ndisplay the properties of being negatively accelerated and gradually\ndeveloping, these curves are misleading because\nno individual\u2019s learning curve has these\nproperties. Gallistel has argued that learning for individuals is\ngenerally step-like, rapid, and abrupt. An individual\u2019s learning\nfrom a low-level of responding to asymptotic responding is very quick.\nSometimes, the learning is so quick that it is literally one-shot\nlearning. For example, after analyzing multiple experiments of animal\nlearning of spatial location Gallistel writes\nThe learning of a spatial location generally\nrequires but a single experience. Several trials may, however, be\nrequired to convince the subject that the location is predictable from\ntrial to trial. (Gallistel et al. 2004: 13130)\nGallistel argues that the reason the group learning curves look to\nbe smooth and gradual is that there are large individual differences\nbetween subjects in terms of when the onset latency of the step-wise\ncurves begin (Gallistel et al. 2004: 13125); in other words, different\nanimals take different amounts of time for the learning to\ncommence. The differences between individual subject\u2019s learning\ncurves are predicated on when the steps begin and not by the speed of\nthe individual animal\u2019s learning process. All individuals appear\nto show rapid rises in learning, but since each begins their learning\nat a different time, when we average over the group, the rapid step-wise\nlearning appears to look like slow, gradual learning (Gallistel et\nal. 2004: 13124).\n9.2 The Problem of Predication\nThe problem of predication is, at its core, a problem of how an\nassociative mechanism can result in the acquisition of\nsubject/predicate structures, structures which many theorists believe\nappear in language, thought, and judgment. The first major discussion\nof the problem appears in Kant (1781/1787), but variants of the basic\nKantian criticism can be seen across the contemporary literature (see,\ne.g., Chomsky 1959; Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Fodor 2003; Mandelbaum\n2013a; for the details of the Kantian argument see the entry\n on Kant\u2019s Transcendental Argument).\nFor a pure associationist, association is \u201csemantically\ntransparent\u201d (see Fodor 2003), in that it purports to add no\nadditional structure to thoughts. When a simple concept, X\nand a simple concept Y, become associated one acquires the\nassociative structure X/Y. But X/Y\nhas no additional structure on top of their contents. Knowing\nthat X and Y are associated amounts to knowing a\ncausal fact: that activating Xs will bring about the\nactivation of Ys and vice versa. However, so the\nargument goes, some of our thoughts appear to have more structure than\nthis: the thought\n birds fly predicates the property of flying onto\nbirds. The task for the associationist is to explain how associative\nstructures can distinguish a thinker who has a single (complex)\nthought\n birds fly from a thinker who conjoins two simple thoughts in\nan associative structure where one thought,\n birds, is immediately\nfollowed by another,\n fly. As long as the two simple thoughts are\nreliably causally correlated so that, for a thinker, activations of\nbirds regularly brings about\n fly, then that thinker has the\nassociative structure\n birds/fly. Yet it appears that thinker\nhasn\u2019t yet had the thought\n birds fly. The problem of predication\nis explaining how a purely associative mechanism could eventuate in\ncomplex thoughts. In Fodor\u2019s terms the problem boils down to how\nassociation, a causal relation among mental representations, can\naffect predication, a relation among intentional contents (Fodor\n2003).\nA family of related objections to associationism can be interpreted\nas variations on this theme. For example, problems of productivity,\ncompositionality, and systematicity for associationist theorizing\nappear to be variants of the problem of predication (for more on these\n specific issues see the entries on the\n Language of Thought Hypothesis and\n  on compositionality). If\nassociation doesn\u2019t add any additional structure to the mental\nrepresentations that get associated, then it is hard to see how it can\nexplain the compositionality of thought, which relies on structures\nthat specify relations among intentional contents. Compositionality\nrequires that the meaning of a complex thought is determined by the\nmeanings of its simple constituents along with their syntactic\narrangements. The challenge to associationism is to explain how an\nassociative mechanism can give rise to the syntactic structures\nnecessary to distinguish a complex thought like\n\n birds fly from the\ntemporal succession of two simple thoughts\n\n birds and\n fly. Since the\ncompositionality of thought is posited to undergird the productivity\nof thought (thinkers\u2019 abilities to think novel sentences of\narbitrary lengths, e.g.,\n green birds fly,\n giant green birds fly,\ncuddly giant green birds fly, etc.), associationism has problems\nexplaining productivity.\nSystematicity is the thesis that there are predictable patterns\namong which thoughts a thinker is capable of entertaining. Thinkers\nthat can entertain thoughts of certain structures can always entertain\ndistinct thoughts that have related structure. For instance, any\nthinker who can think a complex thought of the form \u201cX\ntransitive verb Y\u201d can think \u201cY\ntransitive verb X\u201d.[31] Systematicity entails that we\nwon\u2019t find any thinker that can only think one of those\ntwo thoughts, in which case we could not find a person who could think\naudrey wronged max, but not\n\n max wronged audrey. Of course, these two\nthoughts have very different effects in one\u2019s cognitive\neconomy. The challenge for the associationist is to explain how the\nassociative structure\n audrey/wronged/max can be distinguished from the\nstructure\n max/wronged/audrey, while capturing the differences in those\nthoughts\u2019 effects.\nAssociationists have had different responses to the problem. Some\nhave denied that human thought is actually compositional, productive,\nand systematic, and other non-associationists have agreed with this\ncritique. For example, Prinz and Clark claim \u201cconcepts do not\ncompose most of the time\u201d (2002: 62), and Johnson (2004) argues\nthat the systematicity criterion is wrongheaded (see Aydede 1997 for\nextended discussion of these issues). Rumelhart et al. offer a\nconnectionist interpretation of \u201cschemata\u201d, one which is\nintended to cover some of the phenomenon mentioned in this section\n(Rumelhart et al. 1986). Others have worked to show that classical\nconditioning can indeed give rise to complex associative structures\n(Rescorla 1988). In defense of the associationist construal of complex\nassociations Rescorla writes,\nClearly, the animals had not simply coded the RH\n[complex] compound in terms of parallel associations with its\nelements. Rather they had engaged in some more hierarchical\nstructuring of the situation, forming a representation of the compound\nand using it as an associate. (Rescorla 1988: 156)\n\n\nWhether or not associationism has the theoretical\ntools to explain such complex compounds by itself is still debated\n(see, e.g., Fodor 2003; Mitchell 2009; Gallistel and King 2009; Quilty-Dunn and Mandelbaum 2019).\n9.3 Word Learning\nMultiple issues in the acquisition of the lexicon appear to cause\nproblems for associationism. Some of the most well known examples are\nreviewed below (for further discussion of word learning and\nassociationism see Bloom 2000).\n9.3.1 Fast Mapping\nChildren learn words at an incredible rate, acquiring around 6,000\nwords by age 6 (Carey 2010: 184). If gradual learning is the rule,\nthen words too should be learned gradually across this time. However,\nthis does not appear to be the case. Susan Carey\ndiscovered the phenomenon of \u201cfast mapping\u201d, which is\none-shot learning of a word (Carey 1978a, 1978b; Carey and Bartlett\n1978). Her most influential example investigated children\u2019s\nacquisition of \u201cchromium\u201d (a color word referring to olive\ngreen). Children were shown one of two otherwise identical objects,\nwhich only differed in color and asked, \u201cCan you get me the\nchromium tray, not the red one, the chromium one\u201d (recited in\nCarey 2010: 2). All of the children handed over the correct tray at\nthat time. When the children were later tested in differing contexts,\nmore than half remembered the referent of\n\u201cchromium\u201d. These findings have been extended\u2014for\nexample, Markson and Bloom (1997) showed that they are not specific to\nthe remembering of novel words, but also hold for novel facts.\nFast mapping poses two problems for associationism. The first is\nthat the learning of a new word did not develop slowly, as would be\npredicted by proponents of gradual learning. The second is that in\norder for the word learning to proceed, the mind must have been aided\nby additional principles not given by the environment. Some of these\nprinciples such as Markman\u2019s (1989) taxonomic, whole object, and\nmutual exclusivity constraints, and Gleitman\u2019s syntactic\nbootstrapping (Gleitman et al. 2005), imply that the mind does add structure to what is\nlearned. Consequently, the associationist claim that learning is just\nmapping external contingencies without adding structure is\nimperiled.\n9.3.2 Syntactic Category Learning\n\u201cMotherese\u201d, the name of the type of language that\ninfants generally hear, consists of simple sentences such as\n\u201cNora want a bottle?\u201d and \u201cAre you tired?\u201d.\nThese sentences almost always contain a noun and a verb. Yet, the\ninfant\u2019s vocabulary massively over-represents nouns in the first\n100 words or so, while massively under-representing the verbs (never\nmind adjectives or adverbs, which almost never appear in the first 100\nwords infants produce; see, e.g., Goldin-Meadow, Seligman, and Gelman\n1976). Even more surprising is that the over-representation of\nnouns to verbs holds even though\nthe incidence of each word (that is, the token\nfrequency) is higher for the verbs than for the nouns in the common\nset used by mothers. (Snedeker and Gleitman 2004: 259, citing data\nfrom Sandhoffer, Smith, and Luo 2000)\n\nMoreover, children hear a preponderance of\ndeterminers (\u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d) but don\u2019t\nproduce them (Bloom 2000). These facts are not specific to English,\nbut hold cross-culturally (see, e.g., Caselli et al. 1995). The\ndisparity between the variation of the syntactic categories infants\nreceive as input and produce as output is troublesome to\nassociationism, insofar as associationism is committed to the learned\nstructures (and the behaviors that follow from them) merely\npatterning what is given in experience.\n9.4 Against the Contiguity Analysis of Associationism\nContiguity has been a central part of associationist analyses since\nthe British Empiricists. In the experimental literature, the problem\nof figuring out the parameters needed for acquiring an association due to the contiguity of its relata has sometimes\nbeen termed the problem of the \u201cWindow of Association\u201d\n(e.g., Gallistel and King 2009). Every associationist theory has to specify what temporal window two properties must instantiate in order for those properties to be associated.[32]\nA related problem for contiguity theorists is that if the domain\ngenerality of associative learning is desired, then the window needs\nto be homogenous across content domains. The late 1960s saw\npersuasive attacks on domain generality, as well as the necessity and\nsufficiency of the contiguity criterion in general.\n9.4.1 Against the Necessity of Contiguity\nResearch on \u201ctaste aversions\u201d and\n\u201cbait-shyness\u201d provided a variety of problems with\ncontiguity in the associative learning tradition of classical\nconditioning. Garcia observed that a gustatory stimulus (e.g.,\ndrinking water or eating a hot dog) but not an audiovisual stimulus (a\nlight and a sound) would naturally become associated with feeling\nnauseated. For instance, Garcia and Koelling (1966) paired an\naudiovisual stimulus (a light and a sound) with a gustatory stimulus\n(flavored water). The two stimuli were then paired with the rats\nreceiving radiation, which made the rats feel nauseated. The rats\nassociated the feeling of nausea with the water and not with the\nsound, even though the sound was contiguous with the water. Moreover,\nthe delay between ingesting the gustatory stimulus and feeling\nnauseated could be quite long, with the feeling not coming on until 12\nhours later (Roll and Smith 1972), and the organism needn\u2019t even\nbe conscious when the negative feeling arises. (For a review, see\nSeligman 1970; Garcia et al. 1974). The temporal delay shows that the\nCS (the flavored water) needn\u2019t be contiguous with the US (the\nfeeling of nausea) in order for learning to occur, thus showing that\ncontiguity isn\u2019t necessary for associative learning.\nGarcia\u2019s work also laid bare the problems with the domain\ngeneral aspect of associationism. In the above study the rat was\nprepared to associate the nausea with the gustatory stimulus, but\nwould not associate it with the audiovisual stimulus. However, if one\nchanges the US from feeling nauseated to receiving shocks in perfect\ncontiguity with the audiovisual and gustatory stimuli, then the rats\nwill associate the shocks with the audiovisual stimulus but not with\nthe gustatory stimulus. That is, rats are prepared to associate\naudiovisual stimuli with the shock but are contraprepared to associate\nthe shocks with the gustatory stimulus. Thus, learning does not seem\nto be entirely domain general (for similar content specificity\neffects in humans, see Baeyens et al.\n 1990).[33]\nLastly, \u201cThe Garcia effect\u201d has also been used to show\n problems in the learning curve (see section 9.1). \n\u201cTaste aversions\u201d are the phenomena whereby an\norganism gets sick from ingesting the stimulus and the taste (or odor,\nGarcia et al. 1974) of that stimulus gets associated with the feeling\nof sickness. As anyone who has had food poisoning can attest, this\nlearning can proceed in a one-shot fashion, and needn\u2019t have a\ngradual rise over many trials (taste aversions have also been observed\nin humans, see, e.g., Bernstein and Webster 1980; Bernsetin 1985;\nLogue et al. 1981; Rozin 1986).\n9.4.2. Against the Sufficiency of Contiguity\nKamin\u2019s famous blocking experiments (1969) showed that not\nall contiguous structures lead to classical conditioning. A rat that\nhas already learned that CS1 predicts a US, will not learn that a\nsubsequent CS2 predicts the US, if the CS2 is always paired with the\nCS1. Suppose that a rat has learned that a light predicts a shock\nbecause of the constant contiguity of the light and shock. After\nlearning this, the rat has a sound introduced which only arises in\nconjunction with the light and the shock. As long as the rat had\npreviously learned that the light predicts the shock, it will not\nlearn that the sound does (as can be seen on later trials that have\nthe sound alone). In sum, having learned that the CS1 predicts the US\nblocks the organism from learning that the CS2 predicts the\n US.[34] So even\nthough CS2 is perfectly contiguous with the US, the association\nbetween CS2 and the US remains unlearned, thus serving as a\ncounterexample to sufficiency of\n contiguity.[35]\nSimilarly Rescorla (1968) demonstrated that a CS can appear only\nwhen the US appears and yet still have the association between them be\nunlearnable. If a tone is arranged to bellow only when there are\nshocks, but there are still shocks when there are no tones (that is,\nthe CS only appears with the US, but the US sometimes appears without\nthe CS), no associative learning between the CS and the US will occur.\nInstead, subjects (in Rescorla 1968, rats) will only learn a\nconnection between the shock and the experimental\nsituation\u2014e.g., the room in which the experiment is carried\nout.\nIn large part because of the problems discussed in 9.4, many\nclassical conditioning theorists gave up the traditional\nprogram. Some, like Garcia, appeared to give up the classical\ntheoretical framework altogether (Garcia et al. 1974), others, such\nas Rescorla and Wagner, tried to usher the framework into the modern\nera (see, Rescorla and Wagner 1972; Rescorla 1988), where\nconditioning is seen as sensitive to base rates and driven by\ninformational \npick-up.[36] \nWhether this movement is interpreted as\na substantive revision of classical conditioning (Rescorla 1988;\nHeyes 2012) or a wholesale abandoning of it (Gallistel and King 2009)\nis debatable.\n9.5 Coextensionality\nThe Rescorla experiment also demonstrates another problem in\nassociative theorizing: the question of why some property is singled\nout as a CS as opposed to different, equally contemporaneously\ninstantiated properties. Put a different way, one needs a principle\nto say what the \u201csame situation\u201d amounts to in\ngeneralizations such as Thorndike\u2019s laws. For instance, if a CS\nand a US, say a tone and a shock, are perfectly paired so that they\nare either both present or both absent, the organism won\u2019t\nassociate the location it received shocks (e.g., the experimental\nsetting) with getting shocked, it will just associate the tone with\nthe shocks. But in the condition where the US occurs without the CS,\nbut the CS does not occur without the US, the organism will gain an\nassociation between the shocks and the location. However, in both\ncases the location is present on every trial.[37] In contrast to shocks,\nx-ray radiation, when used as a US, never appears to become\nassociated with location, even if they are always perfectly paired\n (Garcia et al. \n1972).[38]\nThe problem of saying which properties become associated when\nmultiple properties are coinstantiated sometimes goes by the name the\n\u201cCredit Assignment Problem\u201d (see, e.g., Gallistel and\n King 2009).[39]\nSome would argue that this problem is a symptom of a larger issue:\ntrying to use extensional criteria to specify intentional content\n(see, e.g., Fodor 2003). Associationists need a criterion to specify which\nof the coextensive properties will in fact be learned, and which\nnot.\nAn additional worry stems from the observation that sometimes the\nlack of a property being instantiated is an integral component of\nwhat is learned. To deal with the problem of missing properties,\ncontemporary associationists have introduced an important element to\nthe theory: inhibition. For example, if a US and a CS only appear\nwhen the other is absent, the organism will learn a negative\nrelationship holds between them; that is, the organism will learn\nthat the absence of the CS predicts the\n US.[40] Here\nthe CS becomes a \u201cconditioned inhibitor\u201d of the US.\nInhibition, using associations as modulators and not just activators,\nis a central part of current associationist thinking. For example, in\nconnectionist networks, inhibition is implemented by the activation\nof certain nodes inhibiting the activation of other nodes. Connection\nweights can be positive or negative, with the negative weight\nstanding in for the inhibitory strength of the association.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, J., K.
