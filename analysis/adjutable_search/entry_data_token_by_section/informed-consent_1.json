    "main_text": "Why informed consent?\n2. Why informed consent?\n\nPlato attacks political democracy by drawing an analogy to the medical\narena: \u201cWhen a man is ill\u2026 to the physician he must go,\nand he who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern\u201d\n(Plato Republic, VI 489B\u2013C, 180). Nowadays it is common\nto reject both Plato\u2019s anti-democratic politics and his medical\nethics. A central defense of political democracy against Plato\u2019s\nattack rests on the\n Condorcet jury theorem,\n which underwrites the \u201cwisdom of the masses.\u201d But why\nreject Plato\u2019s medical ethics? In the medical arena there are no\nmasses, and yet the informed consent requirement gives a single\nnon-expert\u2014the patient or the research participant\u2014veto\npower over some interventions, even against the will of many expert\nphysicians. Why not take Plato\u2019s, or\nHippocrates\u2019s, approach in the medical arena? Why require\ninformed consent, disallowing even a mass of medical experts to make\nthe final decision on matters that fall within their fields of\nexpertise\u2014medical treatment and medical investigation? The main\narguments for informed consent revolve around:\n\n\nprotection,\nautonomy,\nprevention of abusive conduct,\ntrust,\nself-ownership,\nnon-domination, and\npersonal integrity.\n\n\n",
