    "main_text": "Nonlocality\n13. Nonlocality\n\nBohmian mechanics is manifestly nonlocal. The velocity, as expressed\nin\n the guiding equation,\n of any particle of a many-particle system will typically depend upon\nthe positions of the other, possibly distant, particles whenever the\nwave function of the system is entangled, i.e., not a product of\nsingle-particle wave functions. This is true, for example, for the\nEPR-Bohm wave function, describing a pair of spin-1/2 particles in the\nsinglet state, that Bell and many others analyzed. Thus Bohmian\nmechanics makes explicit the most dramatic feature of quantum theory:\nquantum nonlocality, as discussed in Section 2. \n\nIt should be emphasized that the nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics\nderives solely from the nonlocality, discussed in\n Section 2,\n built into the structure of standard quantum theory. This nonlocality\noriginates from a wave function on configuration space, an abstraction\nwhich, roughly speaking, combines\u2014or binds\u2014distant\nparticles into a single irreducible reality. As Bell has stressed,\n\n\nThat the guiding wave, in the general case, propagates not in ordinary\nthree-space but in a multidimensional-configuration space is the\norigin of the notorious \u201cnonlocality\u201d of quantum\nmechanics. It is a merit of the de Broglie-Bohm version to bring this\nout so explicitly that it cannot be ignored. (Bell 1980, reprinted\n1987c: 115) \n\n\nThus the nonlocal velocity relation in the guiding equation is but one\naspect of the nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics. There is also the\nnonlocality, or nonseparability, implicit in the wave function itself,\nwhich is present even without the structure\u2014actual\nconfigurations\u2014that Bohmian mechanics adds to orthodox quantum\ntheory. As Bell has shown, using the connection between the wave\nfunction and the predictions of quantum theory about experimental\nresults, the elimination of this nonlocality, if possible at all, is extremely difficult (see\n Section 2).\n\nThe nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics can be appreciated perhaps most\nefficiently, in all its aspects, by focusing on the\n conditional wave function.\n Suppose, for example, that in an EPR-Bohm experiment particle 1\npasses through its Stern-Gerlach magnet before particle 2 arrives at\nits magnet. Then the orientation of the Stern-Gerlach magnet for\nparticle 1 will significantly affect the conditional wave function of\nparticle 2: If the Stern-Gerlach magnet for particle 1 is oriented so\nas to \u201cmeasure the \\(z\\)-component of spin\u201d, then after\nparticle 1 has passed through its magnet the conditional wave function\nof particle 2 will be an\n eigenvector\n (or eigenstate) of the \\(z\\)-component of spin (in fact, belonging to\nthe eigenvalue that is the negative of the one \u201cmeasured\u201d\nfor particle 1), and the same thing is true for any other component of\nspin. You can dictate the kind of spin eigenstate produced\nfor particle 2 by appropriately choosing the orientation of an\narbitrarily distant magnet. As to the future behavior of particle 2,\nin particular how its magnet affects it, this of course depends very\nmuch on the character of its conditional wave function; hence the\nchoice of orientation of the distant magnet strongly influences\nthat behavior.\n\nThis nonlocal effect upon the conditional wave function of particle 2\nfollows from combining the standard analysis of the evolution of the\nwave function in the EPR-Bohm experiment with the definition of the\nconditional wave function. (For simplicity, we ignore permutation\nsymmetry.) Before reaching any magnets the EPR-Bohm wave function is a\nsum of two terms, corresponding to nonvanishing values for two of the\nfour possible joint spin components for the two particles. Each term\nis a product of an eigenstate for a component of spin in a given\ndirection for particle 1 with the opposite eigenstate (i.e., belonging\nto the eigenvalue that is the negative of the eigenvalue for particle\n1) for the component of spin in the same direction for particle 2.\nMoreover, by virtue of its symmetry under rotations, the EPR-Bohm wave\nfunction has the property that any component of spin, i.e., any\ndirection, can be used in this decomposition. (This property is very\ninteresting.)\n\nDecomposing the EPR-Bohm wave function using the component of spin in\nthe direction associated with the magnet for particle 1, the evolution\nof the wave function as particle 1 passes its magnet is easily\ngrasped: The evolution of the sum is determined (using the\n linearity of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation)\n by that of its individual terms, and the evolution of each term by\nthat of each of its factors. The evolution of the particle-1 factor\nleads to a displacement along the magnetic axis in the direction\ndetermined by the (sign of the) spin component (i.e., the eigenvalue),\nas described in the fourth paragraph of\n Section 11.\n Once this displacement has occurred (and is large enough) the\nconditional wave function for particle 2 will correspond to the term\nin the sum selected by the actual position of particle 1. In\nparticular, it will be an eigenstate of the component of spin\n\u201cmeasured by\u201d the magnet for particle 1. (For a more\nexplicit and detailed discussion see Norsen 2014.)\n\nThe nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics has a remarkable feature: it is\nscreened by quantum equilibrium. It is a consequence of the\n quantum equilibrium hypothesis\n that the nonlocal effects in Bohmian mechanics don\u2019t yield\nobservable consequences that can be controlled\u2014we can\u2019t\nuse them to send instantaneous messages. This follows from the fact\nthat, given the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, the observable\nconsequences of Bohmian mechanics are the same as those of orthodox\nquantum theory, for which instantaneous communication based on quantum\nnonlocality is impossible (see Eberhard 1978). Valentini (1991)\nemphasizes the importance of quantum equilibrium for obscuring the\nnonlocality of Bohmian mechanics. (Valentini [2010a] has also\nsuggested the possibility of searching for and exploiting quantum\nnon-equilibrium. However, in contrast with thermodynamic\nnon-equilibrium, we have at present no idea what quantum\nnon-equilibrium, should it exist, would look like, despite claims and\narguments to the contrary.)\n",
