    "main_text": "Expanding Horizons || Statuses Other Than Knowledge\n10.4 Epistemic Emotions\n\nIt\u2019s uncontroversial to say that many virtues are emotional\ndispositions, even if they involve behavior in addition to emotion. As\nmentioned above, intellectual courage disposes its bearer to\nappropriate fear and confidence in matters epistemic. Alfano (2016b:\nchapter 4) suggests that, because we are able to individuate emotions\nmore clearly than virtues, it might be helpful to index virtues to the\nemotions they govern. If this is on the right track, then intellectual\nvirtues could be distinguished and structured by cataloguing what\nMorton (2010; see also Morton 2014, Stocker 2010, and Kashdan &\nSilvia 2011) calls epistemic emotions. These include such\nstates as curiosity, fascination, intrigue, hope, trust, distrust,\nmistrust, surprise, doubt, skepticism, boredom, puzzlement, confusion,\nwonder, awe, faith, and epistemic angst. Note that some of these\nemotions are referred to by words that are also used to refer to their\ncontrolling virtues. As Morton says, \u201cthe words often do triple\nduty. Character links to virtue links to emotion\u201d (2010).\n\nVE can benefit from theorizing about epistemic emotions in at least\nthree ways. One benefit of theorizing intellectual virtues via\nepistemic emotions is that doing so furnishes practitioners with a\nsort of \u201cto do list\u201d: many of the virtues related to the\nemotions mentioned in the previous paragraph are unexplored or\nunderexplored. These virtues are ripe for the picking. Another benefit\nof the lens of epistemic emotion is that it helps to make sense of\nintellectual virtues as dispositions to motivated inquiry rather than\njust static belief. Emotions are, after all, motivational states, and\nepistemic emotions in particular direct us to seek confirmation,\ndisconfirmation, and so on. This point is related to but more specific\nthan Michael Brady\u2019s (2013: 92) idea that emotions in general\nmotivate inquiry because they \u201ccapture and consume\u201d\nattention, thereby motivating inquiry into their own eliciting\nconditions. For instance, fear captures and consumes the attention of\nthe fearful person, directing him to find and understand the\n(potential) threat or danger.\n\nFinally, epistemic emotions help to make sense of the motivations and\npractices of scientists. For example, Thagard (2002) mined James\nWatson\u2019s (1969) autobiographical account of the discovery of the\nstructure of DNA for emotion terms; the most common related to\ninterest and the joy of discovery, followed by fear, hope, anger,\ndistress, aesthetic appreciation, and surprise. In addition, the\nliterature on the demarcation between science and pseudo-science,\nalong with the literature on scientific revolutions, is peppered with\nthe language of emotion\u2014especially epistemic emotion. Popper\n(1962) talks of scientists\u2019 attitudes to their hypotheses as one\nof \u201chope\u201d rather than belief. He distinguishes science\nfrom pseudoscience by sneering at the \u201cfaith\u201d\ncharacteristic of the latter and praising the \u201cdoubt\u201d and\nopenness to testing of the former. He argues that the \u201cspecial\nproblem under investigation\u201d and the scientist\u2019s\n\u201ctheoretical interests\u201d determine her point of view.\nLakatos (1978) contrasts scientific knowledge with theological\ncertainty that \u201cmust be beyond doubt\u201d. Kuhn (1962) says\nthat the attitude scientists have towards their paradigms is one of\nnot only belief but also \u201ctrust\u201d. He claims that\nscientists received the discovery of x-rays \u201cnot only with\nsurprise but with shock\u201d, going on to say that \u201cthough\nthey could not doubt the evidence, [they] were clearly staggered by\nit\u201d.\n\nIn times of crisis, says Kuhn, scientists are plagued by\n\u201cmalaise\u201d. Such malaise has recently become most evident\nin social psychology\u2019s replication crisis. For example, two\npre-registered replications of the so-called \u201cego-depletion\neffect\u201d recently found that, despite decades of positive studies\nand successful meta-analyses, there appears to be no such effect\n(Hagger et al. 2016; Lurquin et al. 2016). A science journalist\nwriting for Slate magazine described these findings as\n\u201cnot just worrying\u201d but \u201cterrifying\u201d, because\nthey suggest that an entire field of research is\n\u201csuspicious\u201d (Engber 2016, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The article quotes Evan Carter, one of the young scientists in the\nthick of the crisis, saying,\n\n\nAll of a sudden it felt like everything was crumbling. I basically\nlost my compass. Normally I could say, all right there have been 100\npublished studies on this, so I can feel good about it, I can feel\nconfident. And then that just went away.\n\n\nOn his blog, social psychologist Michael Inzlicht (2016, see\n Other Internet Resources)\n writes that despite being\n\n\nin love with social psychology [\u2026] I have so many feelings\nabout the situation we\u2019re in, and sometimes the weight of it\nbreaks my heart. [\u2026] it is only when we feel badly, when we\nacknowledge and, yes, grieve for yesterday, that we can allow for a\nbetter tomorrow.\n\n\nHe goes on to say, \u201cThis is flat-out scary\u201d, and,\n\u201cI\u2019m in a dark place. I feel like the ground is moving\nfrom underneath me and I no longer know what is real and what is\nnot\u201d. Practitioners of VE may be in a position to offer aid and\ncomfort to afflicted scientists, or at least an accurate description\nof what ails them.\n",
