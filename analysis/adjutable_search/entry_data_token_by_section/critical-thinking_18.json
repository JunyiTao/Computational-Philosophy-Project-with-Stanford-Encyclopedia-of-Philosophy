    "main_text": "Controversies || The Generalizability of Critical Thinking\n12.1 The Generalizability of Critical Thinking\n\nMcPeck (1981) attacked the thinking skills movement of the 1970s,\nincluding the critical thinking movement. He argued that there are no\ngeneral thinking skills, since thinking is always thinking about some\nsubject-matter. It is futile, he claimed, for schools and colleges to\nteach thinking as if it were a separate subject. Rather, teachers\nshould lead their pupils to become autonomous thinkers by teaching\nschool subjects in a way that brings out their cognitive structure and\nthat encourages and rewards discussion and argument. As some of his\ncritics (e.g., Paul 1985; Siegel 1985) pointed out, McPeck\u2019s\ncentral argument needs elaboration, since it has obvious\ncounter-examples in writing and speaking, for which (up to a certain\nlevel of complexity) there are teachable general abilities even though\nthey are always about some subject-matter. To make his argument\nconvincing, McPeck needs to explain how thinking differs from writing\nand speaking in a way that does not permit useful abstraction of its\ncomponents from the subject-matters with which it deals. He has not\ndone so. Nevertheless, his position that the dispositions and\nabilities of a critical thinker are best developed in the context of\nsubject-matter instruction is shared by many theorists of critical\nthinking, including Dewey (1910, 1933), Glaser (1941), Passmore\n(1980), Weinstein (1990), Bailin et al. (1999b), and Willingham\n(2019).\n\nMcPeck\u2019s challenge prompted reflection on the extent to which\ncritical thinking is subject-specific. McPeck argued for a strong\nsubject-specificity thesis, according to which it is a conceptual\ntruth that all critical thinking abilities are specific to a subject.\n(He did not however extend his subject-specificity thesis to critical\nthinking dispositions. In particular, he took the disposition to\nsuspend judgment in situations of cognitive dissonance to be a general\ndisposition.) Conceptual subject-specificity is subject to obvious\ncounter-examples, such as the general ability to recognize confusion\nof necessary and sufficient conditions. A more modest thesis, also\nendorsed by McPeck, is epistemological subject-specificity, according\nto which the norms of good thinking vary from one field to another.\nEpistemological subject-specificity clearly holds to a certain extent;\nfor example, the principles in accordance with which one solves a\ndifferential equation are quite different from the principles in\naccordance with which one determines whether a painting is a genuine\nPicasso. But the thesis suffers, as Ennis (1989) points out, from\nvagueness of the concept of a field or subject and from the obvious\nexistence of inter-field principles, however broadly the concept of a\nfield is construed. For example, the principles of\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning hold for all the varied fields in\nwhich such reasoning occurs. A third kind of subject-specificity is\nempirical subject-specificity, according to which as a matter of\nempirically observable fact a person with the abilities and\ndispositions of a critical thinker in one area of investigation will\nnot necessarily have them in another area of investigation.\n\nThe thesis of empirical subject-specificity raises the general problem\nof transfer. If critical thinking abilities and dispositions have to\nbe developed independently in each school subject, how are they of any\nuse in dealing with the problems of everyday life and the political\nand social issues of contemporary society, most of which do not fit\ninto the framework of a traditional school subject? Proponents of\nempirical subject-specificity tend to argue that transfer is more\nlikely to occur if there is critical thinking instruction in a variety\nof domains, with explicit attention to dispositions and abilities that\ncut across domains. But evidence for this claim is scanty. There is a\nneed for well-designed empirical studies that investigate the\nconditions that make transfer more likely.\n\nIt is common ground in debates about the generality or\nsubject-specificity of critical thinking dispositions and abilities\nthat critical thinking about any topic requires background knowledge\nabout the topic. For example, the most sophisticated understanding of\nthe principles of hypothetico-deductive reasoning is of no help unless\naccompanied by some knowledge of what might be plausible explanations\nof some phenomenon under investigation.\n",
