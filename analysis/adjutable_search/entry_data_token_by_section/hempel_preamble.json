    "main_text": "\n\nCarl G. Hempel (1905\u20131997) was the principal proponent of the\n\u201ccovering law\u201d theory of explanation and the paradoxes of\nconfirmation as basic elements of the theory of science. A master of\nphilosophical methodology, Hempel pursued explications of initially\nvague and ambiguous concepts, which were required to satisfy very\nspecific criteria of adequacy. With Rudolf Carnap and Hans\nReichenbach, he was instrumental in the transformation of the dominant\nphilosophical movement of the 1930s and 40s, which was known as\n\u201clogical positivism\u201d, into the more nuanced position known\nas \u201clogical empiricism\u201d. His studies of induction,\nexplanation, and rationality in science exerted a profound influence\nupon more than a generation of philosophers of science, many of whom\nbecame leaders of the discipline in their own right.\n",
