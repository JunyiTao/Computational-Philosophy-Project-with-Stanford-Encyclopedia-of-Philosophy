    "main_text": "Arguments for Propositions || The Metaphysics 101 Argument\n4.3 The Metaphysics 101 Argument\n\nOur focus here will be on a different sort of argument. Here is a\nspeech the basic character of which should be familiar to\nundergraduate students of metaphysics:\n\nWhen someone has a belief, we can distinguish what she\nbelieves from her believing it. I have a belief that\nHomer wrote The Iliad, for example. We can distinguish\nwhat I believe in believing that Homer wrote The\nIliad\u2014the content of my belief\u2014from my believing\nthat Homer wrote The Iliad. What I believe in believing this is\nsomething you believe, too. What we both believe is the proposition\nthat Homer wrote The Iliad. This same proposition may be\nasserted, doubted, etc. And, in fact, this proposition is true: Homer\nwrote The Iliad. So, there are propositions, and they are the\ncontents of beliefs and other attitudes and they are the bearers of\ntruth and falsity.\n\n\nOne might attempt to regiment these remarks, somewhat artificially, to\ntake the form of an argument, which we will dub the Metaphysics\n101 argument:\n\n\nWith respect to any belief, there is what is believed and\nthe believing of it, and these are distinct.\nWhat is believed is something that may be rejected, denied,\ndisbelieved, etc. by multiple subjects, and is something that may be\ntrue or false.\nThere are beliefs.\nSo, there are propositions (i.e, sharable objects of the attitudes\nand bearers of truth-values).\n\n\n\nFurther tinkering might improve the argument in certain ways. Our\nconcern, however, is whether the argument goes seriously awry.\n\nThe Metaphysics 101 Argument is not metalinguistic. It does not rely\non premises about English. This can be verified by noting that the\nargument looks just as good after it is translated into other\nlanguages. Nevertheless, it might be claimed that the argument derives\nits apparent force from a seductive mistake about how English (and\nother languages) function. Perhaps this is another case of what\nWittgenstein called \u201clanguage on\n holiday.\u201d[7]\n",
