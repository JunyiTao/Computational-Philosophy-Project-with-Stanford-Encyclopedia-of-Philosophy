    "main_text": "What are preferences over prospects?\n1. What are preferences over prospects?\n\nThe two central concepts in decision theory are preferences\nand prospects (or equivalently, options). Roughly\nspeaking, when we (in this entry) say that an agent\n\u201cprefers\u201d the \u201coption\u201d \\(A\\) over \\(B\\) we\nmean that the agent takes \\(A\\) to be more desirable or choice-worthy\nthan \\(B\\). This rough definition makes clear that preference is a\ncomparative attitude. Beyond this, there is room for argument about\nwhat preferences over options actually amount to, or in other words,\nwhat it is about an agent (perhaps oneself) that concerns us when we\ntalk about his/her preferences over options. This section considers\nsome elementary issues of interpretation that set the stage for\nintroducing (in the next section) the decision tables and expected\nutility rule that for many is the familiar subject matter of decision\ntheory. Further interpretive questions regarding preferences and\nprospects will be addressed later, as they arise.\n\nLet us nonetheless proceed by first introducing basic candidate\nproperties of (rational) preference over options and only afterwards\nturning to questions of interpretation. As noted above, preference\nconcerns the comparison of options; it is a relation between options.\nFor a domain of options we speak of an agent\u2019s preference\nordering, this being the ordering of options that is generated by\nthe agent\u2019s preference between any two options in that\ndomain.\n\nIn what follows, \\(\\preceq\\) represents a weak preference\nrelation. So \\(A\\preceq B\\) means that the agent we are interested in\nconsiders option \\(B\\) to be at least as preferable as option \\(A\\).\nFrom the weak preference relation we can define the strict\npreference relation, \\(\\prec\\), as follows: \\(A\\prec B\\Leftrightarrow\nA\\preceq B \\ \\& \\ \\neg (B\\preceq A)\\), where \\(\\neg X\\) means\n\u201cit is not the case that \\(X\\)\u201d. The indifference\nrelation, \\(\\sim\\), is defined as: \\(A\\sim B \\Leftrightarrow A\\preceq\nB \\ \\& \\ B\\preceq A\\). This represents that the agent we are\ninterested in considers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to be equally preferable.\n\nWe say that \\(\\preceq\\) weakly orders a set \\(S\\) of options\nwhenever it satisfies the following two conditions:\n\nAxiom 1 (Completeness)\n\nFor any \\(A, B\\in S\\): either \\(A\\preceq B\\) or \\(B\\preceq A\\).\n\nAxiom 2 (Transitivity)\n\nFor any \\(A, B, C\\in S\\): if \\(A\\preceq B\\) and \\(B\\preceq C\\) then\n\\(A\\preceq C\\).\n\nThe above can be taken as a preliminary characterisation of rational\npreference over options. Even this limited characterisation is\ncontentious, however, and points to divergent interpretations of\n\u201cpreferences over prospects/options\u201d.\n\nStart with the Completeness axiom, which says that an agent can\ncompare, in terms of the weak preference relation, all pairs of\noptions in \\(S\\). Whether or not Completeness is a plausible\nrationality constraint depends both on what sort of options are under\nconsideration, and how we interpret preferences over these options. If\nthe option set includes all kinds of states of affairs, then\nCompleteness is not immediately compelling. For instance, it is\nquestionable whether an agent should be able to compare the option\nwhereby two additional people in the world are made literate with the\noption whereby two additional people reach the age of sixty. If, on\nthe other hand, all options in the set are quite similar to each\nother, say, all options are investment portfolios, then Completeness\nis more compelling. But even if we do not restrict the kinds of\noptions under consideration, the question of whether or not\nCompleteness should be satisfied turns on the meaning of preference.\nFor instance, if preferences merely represent choice behaviour or\nchoice dispositions, as they do according to the \u201crevealed\npreference theory\u201d popular amongst economists (see Sen 1973),\nthen Completeness is automatically satisfied, on the assumption that a\nchoice must inevitably be made. By contrast, if preferences are\nunderstood rather as mental attitudes, typically considered judgments\nabout whether an option is better or more desirable than another, then\nthe doubts about Completeness alluded to above are pertinent (for\nfurther discussion, see Mandler 2001).\n\nMost philosophers and decision theorists subscribe to the latter\ninterpretation of preference as a kind of judgment that explains, as\nopposed to being identical with, choice dispositions and resultant\nchoice behaviour (see, e.g., Hausman 2011a, 2011b; Dietrich and List,\n2016a & 2016b; Bradley 2017; although see also Thoma 2020b and\nVredenburgh 2020 for recent defences of \u201crevealed preference\ntheory\u201d, at least in the context of empirical economics).\nMoreover, many hold that Completeness is not rationally required,\nsince they think that rationality makes demands only on the judgments\nan agent actually holds, but says nothing of whether a judgement must\nbe held in the first place. Nevertheless, following Richard Jeffrey\n(1983), most decision theorists suggest that rationality requires that\npreferences be coherently extendible. This means that even if\nyour preferences are not complete, it should be possible to complete\nthem without violating any of the conditions that are rationally\nrequired, in particular Transitivity.\n\nThis brings us to the\n Transitivity axiom,\n which says that if an option \\(B\\) is weakly preferred to \\(A\\), and\n\\(C\\) weakly preferred to \\(B\\), then \\(C\\) is weakly preferred to\n\\(A\\). A recent challenge to Transitivity turns on heterogeneous sets\nof options, as per the discussion of Completeness above. But here a\ndifferent interpretation of preference is brought to bear on the\ncomparison of options. The idea is that preferences, or judgments of\ndesirability, may be responsive to a salience condition. For example,\nsuppose that the most salient feature when comparing cars \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) is how fast they can be driven, and \\(B\\) is no worse than \\(A\\)\nin this regard, yet the most salient feature when comparing cars \\(B\\)\nand \\(C\\) is how safe they are, and that \\(C\\) is no worse than \\(B\\)\nin this regard. Furthermore, when comparing \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), the most\nsalient feature is their beauty. In such a case, some argue (e.g.,\nTemkin 2012) that there is no reason why Transitivity should be\nsatisfied with respect to the preferences concerning \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and\n\\(C\\). Others (e.g., Broome 1991a) argue that Transitivity is part of\nthe very meaning of the betterness relation (or objective comparative\ndesirability); if rational preference is a judgment of betterness or\ndesirability, then Transitivity is non-negotiable. With respect to the\ncar example, Broome would argue that the desirability of a fully\nspecified option should not vary, simply in virtue of what other\noptions it is compared with. Either the choice context affects how the\nagent perceives the option at hand, in which case the description of\nthe option should reflect this, or else the choice context does not\naffect the option. Either way, Transitivity should be satisfied.\n\nThere is a more straightforward defence of Transitivity in preference;\na defence that hinges on the sure losses that may befall anyone who\nviolates the axiom. This is the so-called money pump argument\n(see Davidson et. al. 1955 for an early argument of this sort, but for\nrecent discussion and revision of this argument, see Gustafsson 2010\n& 2013). It is based on the assumption that if you find \\(X\\) at\nleast as desirable as \\(Y\\), then you should be happy to trade the\nlatter for the former. Suppose you violate Transitivity; for you:\n\\(A\\preceq B\\), \\(B\\preceq C\\) but \\(C\\prec A\\). Moreover, suppose you\npresently have \\(A\\). Then you should be willing to trade \\(A\\) for\n\\(B\\). The same goes for \\(B\\) and \\(C\\): you should be willing to\ntrade \\(B\\) for \\(C\\). You strictly prefer \\(A\\) to \\(C\\), so you\nshould be willing to trade in \\(C\\) plus some sum \\(\\$x\\) for \\(A\\).\nBut now you are in the same situation as you started, having \\(A\\) and\nneither \\(B\\) nor \\(C\\), except that you have lost \\(\\$x\\)! So in a\nfew steps, each of which was consistent with your preferences, you\nfind yourself in a situation that is clearly worse, by your own\nlights, than your original situation. The picture is made more\ndramatic if we imagine that the process could be repeated, turning you\ninto a \u201cmoney pump\u201d. Hence, the argument goes, there is\nsomething (instrumentally) irrational about your intransitive\npreferences. If your preferences were transitive, then you would not\nbe vulnerable to choosing a dominated option and serving as a money\npump. Therefore, your preferences should be transitive.\n\nWhile the aforementioned controversies have not been settled, the\nfollowing assumptions will be made in the remainder of this entry: i)\nthe objects of preference may be heterogeneous prospects,\nincorporating a rich and varied domain of properties, ii) preference\nbetween options is a judgment of comparative desirability or\nchoice-worthiness, and iii) preferences satisfy both Completeness and\nTransitivity (although the former condition will be revisited in\n Section 5).\n The question that now arises is whether there are further general\nconstraints on rational preference over options.\n",
