    "main_text": "\n\nInformation is a rich commodity. It is perhaps the richest of them\nall. It is by now almost post-truistic that interested parties, from\nindividuals, to large-scale globalised private actors and nation\nstates, will go to extraordinary lengths to protect and to acquire\ninformation. If we allow ourselves to engage in a little armchair\netymology, then something\u2019s being in formation is just\nfor it to to be non-random. Indeed this armchair etymology gets\nstraight to the heart of how it is that we often speak of information,\nas a contrast to randomisation. Indeed \u201csignal-to-noise\nratio\u201d may be restated as \u201cinformation-to-noise\nratio\u201d, hence the ubiquity of the refrain \u201cThat is not\ninformation, it is just noise\u201d.\n\nAnother way of putting this is to say that information is a non-random\ndistinction with a difference. Information supervenes on patterned\ndeviations, and getting information from one\u2019s environment\ndepends on one being able to recognise and exploit these patterns.\nThat one part of our environment may carry information about another\npart of our environment depends on our environment behaving in\nreliable, non-randomised way. Our ability to use information at one\npart of our environment to access information at another part of it\ndepends not only on our ability to recognise patterned regularities,\nbut on our ability to recognise connections between such\nregularities.\n\nFor example, for us to access the distal information that there is\nfire from the proximal information that there is smoke, we must be\naware of the correlation between smoke and fire. That we do is marked\nby maxims such as \u201dsmoke means fire\u201d. Such correlations of\nnatural meaning between events in the world is studied by the\nMathematical Theory of Communication (MTC) due to Shannon and Weaver\n(see the entry on\n information).\n This is the \u201cindustry standard\u201d account of information,\nas analysed by communications engineers. What of the information\nencoded by natural language however? What of information in this more\nconcretely semantic sense? A semantic conception of information will\nnot investigate the mere surprise value of a signal given the\nlikelihood of the signal itself (as does MTC). Instead, it will\ninvestigate the nature of the information carried by, or encoded by\nthe messages transmitted themselves. Another way of approaching the\nissue is to understand such semantic conceptions of information to be\nconcerned with the investigation of the informational content\nof a piece of language of some sort. Such pieces of language\nmight be propositions, singular terms, descriptions, and so on.\n\nThe first theory of such a semantic conception of information that was\narticulated in detail was Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information. It is fitting then that we start here in\n section 1.\n In\n section 1.1\n we will see how the theory of semantic information has some\nconsequences for certain types of statements, namely logical truths\nand contradictions, that many have found counterintuitive. In\n section 1.2\n we will see how Floridi responds to these problems, as well how\nothers have extended and responded to Floridi\u2019s proposal that we\naccept the veridicality thesis\u2014that information be\nfactive. A number of such responses are motivated by realist and\nnaturalist considerations with regard to the ontology of semantic\ninformation. In\n section 2\n we will look at semantic conceptions of information that take\nnaturalist metaphysics seriously. Here we will see how Fodor, Dretske,\nEvans, Lewis, Recanati, and Jackson propose and defend semantic\nconceptions of information that turn on modes of presentation, and\nthat are broadly naturalist insofar as they attempt to subsume\ninformation within causal relations of various sorts. Any causal\ntheory of meaning or knowledge will face the problem of accounting for\nthe meaning of, and our epistemic access to, abstract objects.\n\nMost of the theories of broadly semantic information outlined in\n section 2\n appeal to information channels in one sense or another (with a\nchannel being a relation allowing information the flow from one state\nto another). In\n section 3\n we will look at theories of information channels directly. (For a\ndetailed examination of the formal properties of the theory of\ninformation channels, as well as how it is that the theory connects\nwith other issues in logic and information more generally, see the\nentry on\n logic and information.)\n We will see how the original theory of information channels due to\nBarwise and Perry emerged from Austin\u2019s theory of semantic\ncontent, as well as how it is that the theory of information channels\nhas been developed and extended in order to give a semantics for\ninformation flow itself, as well as informational semantics for\nnatural language fragments and epistemic phenomena.\n",
