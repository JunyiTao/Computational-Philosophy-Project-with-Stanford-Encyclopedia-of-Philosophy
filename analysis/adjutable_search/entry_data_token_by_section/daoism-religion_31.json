    "main_text": "Views of the Human Body || Terminology\n7.1 Terminology\n\nThe ordinary Western understanding of the body as physical frame or\nstructure cannot convey the complexity of the premodern Chinese view.\nThis view revolves around three main terms. The first, ti, or\n\u201cbody\u201d, refers to the corporeal frame as an ordered whole\nmade of interdependent parts; it denotes the physical body made of\nskin, flesh, limbs, bones, muscles, tissues, vessels, and all other\nmaterial components. The second term, xing, or\n\u201cform\u201d, is best understood\u2014at least in a Daoist\nperspective\u2014in contrast to the idea of\n\u201cformlessness\u201d (wuxing), which pertains to the\nDao. In this sense, \u201cform\u201d refers to the embodiment as the\nfeature that identifies each entity in the \u201cworld of\nform\u201d, distinguishing it from\u2014and relating it to\u2014all\nother entities. Therefore the \u201cform\u201d, rather than the\n\u201cbody\u201d, is the principle of individuality at the physical\nlevel. The third term, shen, is the most comprehensive: it\ndenotes the human being in all of its physical and non-physical\naspects. Shen often is best translated as\n\u201cperson\u201d and at times can also be rendered as\n\u201coneself\u201d. For example, an expression such as\nxiushen means \u201ccultivating one\u2019s person\u201d or\n\u201ccultivating oneself\u201d; it refers to cultivating not only\nthe body, but the entire person. (Explications of these terms, some of\nwhich differ from the understanding suggested here, are found in Kohn\n1991: 241\u201347; Sivin 1995: 14; Despeux 1996: 88\u201389;\nEngelhardt 2000: 95\u201396.)\n\nEach facet of the \u201cbody\u201d mentioned above requires the\nother two, but the variety of concepts embraced by these terms raises\nthe question of which among them is at the center of the Daoist\ndiscourse. It could hardly be said that Daoism focuses on the physical\nbody: as shown below, several loci at the basis of Daoist\npractices\u2014for instance, the three Cinnabar Fields\n(dantian)\u2014do not even exist at the purely physical\nlevel. In other cases, the loci at the basis of Daoist practices have\ncorporeal counterparts, but their emblematic functions are more\nsignificant than those performed by the body parts themselves. The\nmain example is the five viscera (wuzang). In its discourse\non the viscera, Daoism shows little or no interest in the physical\norgans per se; the viscera serve, instead, as material\nsupports for the network of correspondences that tie the human being\nto its immediate and remote surroundings: society and cosmos.\n",
