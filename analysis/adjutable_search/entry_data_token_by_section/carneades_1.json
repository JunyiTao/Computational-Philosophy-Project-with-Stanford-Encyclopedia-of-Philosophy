    "main_text": "Epistemology and Academic Skepticism || Academic Skepticism\n2.1 Academic Skepticism\n\nHistories of philosophy typically speak, as I did above, of a\n\u2018skeptical turn\u2019 in the Academy or of the \u2018skeptical\nAcademy\u2019. Ancient authors called the school of Arcesilaus and\nhis successors the \u2018New Academy\u2019 to distinguish it from\nthe \u2018Old Academy\u2019 of his predecessors. Some cautions and\nqualifications are in order, however. The term \u2018skeptic\u2019\nwas not used by the Academics, but was the most prominent of several\ndescriptions bestowed on themselves by the members of the Pyrrhonian\nschool. It was applied only later to the Academics on the basis of a\nlong-recognized affinity between the two schools. In the original\nmeaning of the term, a skeptic is an inquirer or investigator, but it\ncame to be associated in particular with theses calling into question\nthe possibility of knowledge and recommending suspension of judgment\ntogether with the arguments put forward in support of them. The sense\nof \u2018skeptic\u2019 and \u2018skeptical\u2019 most familiar to\nus has its origin in this use of the term. There is a corresponding\ntension in accounts of the Academy, and in the philosophical activity\nthey seek to describe. \n\nThis activity took the form of argument on both sides of the question\n(in utramque partem). The speeches for and against justice\nthat Carneades delivered during the philosophers\u2019 embassy to\nRome was an instance. Most often, however, Academics in this period\nleft the defense of a theory to its proponents and argued against it,\ncreating an opposition in this way. The Academy\u2019s method of\nargument was, in the first instance, dialectical, like that of\nSocrates in Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues. An argument is\ndialectical in the relevant sense when one party, the questioner, puts\nquestions to another, questions that when affirmed by the answerer\nbecome premises in an argument to a conclusion that contradicts a\nthesis of the answerer\u2019s. This conclusion, deduced as it is from\npremises chosen by the questioner because the answerer is committed to\nthem or will otherwise find them hard to resist, is not one to which\nthe questioner need be committed in propria persona. In\ndrawing them out, he remains detached, uncovering difficulties\ninternal to his interlocutor\u2019s position without committing\nhimself to a position of his own. The side usually taken by the\nAcademics in epistemological debates was that of the skeptic, in the\nsense of one who challenges the possibility of knowledge.\n\nThere are numerous testimonies to the effect that the Academics\nregarded argument on both sides of the question as a method of\ninquiry, and argued as they did the better to discover the truth,\ni.e., to further skeptical ends in the original acceptance of the term\n(cf. Cicero, Acad. 2.7. 60, 76; N.D.1.11; Plutarch,\nStoic. Repugnan. 1037C). But opposing arguments to each other\ncan be also be used to lend support to skepticism in the sense of a\nskeptical position by calling the possibility of knowledge\ninto question and commending the suspension of judgment. And sometimes\nthe Academics are said to have created such oppositions with this end\nin view, i.e., it seems, to support a skeptical position to which they\nwere committed (Cicero Acad. 1.46). And a set of arguments\ndirectly to the\u2013in our sense\u2013skeptical conclusions that\nnothing can be known and that one should suspend judgment occupied a\nplace of central importance in the Academy\u2019s practice of\nargument. The Academics seemed to their opponents to be attached to\nthe skeptical conclusions of these arguments. And this seems to have\nbeen true of at least some Academics. Nonetheless these arguments seem\nat least at first and in the hands of some New Academics to have been\nput forward in a dialectical spirit.\n\nThe principal target of the arguments was the epistemology of the\nStoics, and it was out of their engagement on that front that the form\nof the skeptical position defended by the Academics first emerged. The\nStoics maintained that it is possible for human beings to achieve a\ncondition of wisdom entirely free of opinion, i.e., false or insecure\nbelief. According to them, all of a wise human being\u2019s judgments\nare instances of knowledge, based on an unshakable grasp of the truth.\nKnowledge of this kind was possible according to them because there\nexist so-called cognitive impressions (katal\u00eaptikai\nphantasiai), which function as the criterion of truth (cf. Frede,\n1999; Sedley, 2002). A cognitive impression they define as an\nimpression from what is, stamped and impressed in exact accordance\nwith what is, and such as could not be from what is not. This seems to\nmean, in the paradigm case of a perceptual impression, that it is an\nimpression that arises in conditions which:\n\nEnsure that, by capturing its object with perfect accuracy, it is\ntrue, and\n\n\nAt the same time impart to it a clarity and distinctness that\nbelong only to impressions that arise in these conditions.\n\n\nAccording to the Stoics, by restricting one\u2019s assent in the\nperceptual sphere to impressions of this kind, one can avoid ever\nassenting to a false perceptual impression, a key necessary condition\nif one is to attain knowledge. As the criterion of truth, cognitive\nimpressions are the ultimate basis of all knowledge, by confining\none\u2019s assent to which, and meeting certain further conditions,\nthe Stoics maintained, one can avoid error and opinion entirely.\n\nThe Academics appealed to the skeptic\u2019s stock in trade, dreams,\nmadness, optical illusions and divinely inspired visions, in order to\nargue that the special character allegedly proper to cognitive\nimpressions was not in fact peculiar to impressions produced in the\nrequired truth-guaranteeing way, but could also be found in false\nimpressions (Cicero, Acad. 2.49\u201354, 79\u201382,\n88\u201390; Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos\n[henceforwad S.E. M] 7.402\u20138 = Long and Sedley\n[henceforward L&S] 40H). If so, impressions that arise in the\nspecified conditions, though true, will be indistinguishable from\nfalse impressions\u2014so far as any intrinsic, discriminable\ncharacter is concerned. Therefore they will not be cognitive, and not\nbeing cognitive, they will not be able to serve as a criterion. That\nthere are no cognitive impressions is the first of the two\npropositions most closely associated with ancient skepticism. And\nsince it then follows, on Stoic assumptions, that nothing can be\nknown, this was often taken to be equivalent to the claim that nothing\ncan be known. The second skeptical proposition, that one ought to\nsuspend judgment, the Academics deduced from the first together with\nthe Stoic doctrine that the wise do not hold (mere) opinions (S.E.\nM 7.155\u20137 = L&S 41C). On Stoic assumptions, assent\nto an impression that is not cognitive (either in the strict sense or\nin a broader sense which covers impressions that, though not\nperceptual, nonetheless afford an equally secure grasp of their\ncontents), is sufficient to make the resulting judgment an opinion.\nTherefore, in the absence of cognitive impressions, one can avoid\nopinion only by suspending judgment entirely.\n\nOn a strictly dialectical interpretation, the skeptical propositions\nfor which the Academics argued need not tell us anything about what\nphilosophical views, if any, they accepted themselves. The skeptical\nposition that comprises these two claims\u2014that knowledge is not\npossible and that one ought to suspend judgement about\neverything\u2014is an unwelcome consequence of Stoic views and\npresents the Stoics with a problem that it is their responsibility to\nsolve, not the Academy\u2019s.\n\nTo be sure, Arcesilaus and other Academics, Carneades above all,\ndefended the possibility of a life without knowledge and without\nassent (Plutarch, Adversus Colotem 1122A\u2013F = L&S]\n69A). But that need not show that they somehow held a skeptical\nposition. Instead their aim may have been to counter the Stoic charge\nthat the Academic arguments for the skeptical propositions must be\nfaulty because they render rational action impossible. And\nArcesilaus\u2019 account of how one can act in the absence of\nknowledge and without assent is so heavily dependent on Stoic\ndoctrines that it looks very much like an effort to show the Stoics\nthat their system already contained the resources necessary to explain\nhow action was possible for the skeptic as envisaged in the\nAcademy\u2019s arguments.\n\nNevertheless, there is evidence that at some stage in the\nschool\u2019s history, even if they did not use the term\n\u2018skeptic\u2019, some Academics were skeptics in the sense that\nthey adopted one or both of the two skeptical propositions as the\ncorrect philosophical position in propria persona. Whether\nCarneades endorsed a positions of his own and, if so, which ones is\nunclear and was already a matter of dispute in the Academy. He is\nknown to have championed different positions on the same question in\ndifferent contexts. It is plain nonetheless that he prepared the way\nfor his successors to take this step (see below).\n\nLater ancient writers sometimes speak of Carneades founding the third\nor New Academy (giving \u2018New Academy\u2019 which elsewhere\ncovers the whole of the Academy from Arcesilaus\u2019 time a narrower\nmeaning) which followed the second or Middle Academy of Arcesilaus and\nthe first or Old Academy of Plato and his earliest successors. (The\ndistinction between Academies was meant to signal changes in\nphilosophical doctrine or approach, not changes in the school as an\ninstitution.) The New Academy in this narrower sense seemed, to both\nancient philosophers and modern historians, to differ from the Middle\nchiefly in two respects. Carneades appeared to favor a mitigated form\nof skepticism, which admitted the possibility of well-founded opinions\nif not of certain knowledge. And he tackled issues in, and sometimes\ndefended positions about, logic, ethics, natural philosophy and\ntheology as well as epistemology, which had been the focus of\nArcesilaus\u2019 attention. \n\nIt is likely that Carneades refined and added to the stock of\nskeptical arguments employed in the Academy. They come in two groups.\nThe first focus on the allegedly peculiar character, a kind of\nclarity, and strikingness, that belongs only to impressions that arise\nin the way specified by the definition of the cognitive impression,\nwhile the second tackle the requirement that cognitive impressions be\ndistinct (Acad. 2.54\u20138, 84\u20136; S.E. M\n7.408\u201311 = L&S 40H). Arguments of the second type are based\non the idea, denied by the Stoa, that two object might be exactly\nalike. If this were true, then even if impressions that captured their\nobjects with complete accuracy by arising in the specified ideal\nconditions did possess a clarity that it was possible to acquire in no\nother way, it would not be possible to avoid errors of identification\nby confining one\u2019s assent to impressions with the required\nclarity. One could, for instance, mistake someone for his identical\ntwin. The only sure way to avoid error would then be to suspend\njudgment.\n",
