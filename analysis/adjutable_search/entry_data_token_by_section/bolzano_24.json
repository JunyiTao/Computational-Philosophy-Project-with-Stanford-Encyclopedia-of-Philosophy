Political and Social Philosophy\n\nIn a series of writings Bolzano was concerned also with political,\nsocial, national, economic questions and generally with philosophy of\nstate. The central one of these writings was no doubt his\n\u201cbooklet\u201d On the Best State (Bolzano 1932).\nTherein he summarized his political philosophy systematically and\ndeveloped his conception of an ideal state. For Bolzano, the main\nquestion to be answered in this connection is: How can we eliminate or\nat least reduce human suffering and evil in the world most\neffectively? It was the question which, according to Bolzano\u2019s\nown statement, occupied him with the greatest frequency, intensity and\nenthusiasm above all others (Bolzano 1932, III). Some suffering of\nhuman beings and some evil in the world are unavoidable, due to our\nfinite nature, and therefore cannot be excluded even in an ideal state\nwith optimal arrangements. Much suffering and evil, however, could be\nprevented by means of expedient political arrangements (Bolzano 1932,\n3 f.). It is the fault of poor arrangements in all civil constitutions\nthus far, according to Bolzano, that the human condition is so\ndeplorable. In On the Best State, Bolzano therefore devotes\nhimself to the question as to how a state would have to be most\nexpediently arranged or how a perfect state would have to look\n(Bolzano 1932, V, 1). The leading principle that Bolzano applies in\nanswering this question is his supreme moral law: The political\narrangements are to be made in such a manner that the general welfare\nor virtue and happiness are all advanced as far as possible (Bolzano\n1932, III, 7 f.). From it he tried to derive all the rules and\nregulations needed in a well-organized state.\n\nIn 28 chapters Bolzano describes how the best state looks and\ntherefore also how the currently existing states should be\narranged. In these chapters Bolzano treats the following topics: 1.\nthe citizens of the state, its size and its divisions; 2. legislation;\n3. government; 4. compulsory institutions; 5. liberty; 6. equality; 7.\nfreedom of thought and of religion; 8. education and instruction; 9.\ncare for health and for life; 10. property; 11. money; 12. occupations\nand life styles; 13. productive activities; 14. trade; 15. scholars;\n16. books and censorship; 17. fine arts; 18. nourishment; 19.\nclothing; 20. housing; 21. gender specific institutions; 22.\nsatisfaction of the pursuit for honor; 23. travels; 24. enjoyments;\n25. disputes among citizens; 26. taxes and state expenditures; 27.\nrewards and punishments; 28. death.\n\nA mere comparison of the chapters in terms of their size is revealing:\nThe longest chapter by far is the tenth, concerning property, followed\nby the chapter on taxes and state expenditures and the chapter on\nrewards and punishments. From this it is clear that the unequal\ndivision of possessions was Bolzano\u2019s greatest concern; it was\nfor him the main root of evil, which was to be removed by means of a\njust redistribution. Bringing about a certain equality regarding the\nrights and duties of citizens is an important concern for Bolzano. How\nlittle Bolzano cares for the principle of liberty, however, becomes\nmanifest already by the fact that the chapter on liberty is the second\nshortest chapter in his booklet (the shortest being the one on\ntravelling). The constitution of Bolzano\u2019s best state turns out\nto be a very ambivalent mixture of regulations which make an\nimpression of being very progressive with respect to the desired\nequality for the citizens, but extremely objectionable with respect to\nthe liberties conceded to them. \n\nBolzano did not shy away from taking up also practical problems in\npublications and writing about them, for instance, about the\nimprovement of poorhouses and about the elimination of misery and\npoverty in the population of Prague. Bolzano treated these and many\nother questions of practical relevance also in his \u201cedifying\naddresses\u201d (Erbauungsreden), of which the first\ncollection was published already in 1813 (in a second edition 1839),\nand five volumes were published posthumously. The first volume of the\ncomplete critical edition of all of Bolzano\u2019s\nErbauungsreden appeared in 2007 (Bolzano 2007a).\n",
