    "main_text": "Anti-Absolutism || The Myth of the Given in Experience\n2.1 The Myth of the Given in Experience\nGoodman\u2019s philosophy\u2014especially his epistemology\u2014is\nusually considered to be in opposition to the philosophy of the\nLogical Positivists, and of Rudolf Carnap in particular. But this\ncharacterization overlooks an important continuity between the\nphilosophy of the Logical Positivists and Goodman\u2019s work. The received\nview, that Goodman\u2019s main work, The Structure of Appearance\nwas intended as an anti-foundationalist reconception of\nCarnap\u2019s Der logische Aufbau der Welt (cf. Elgin 2001;\nHellman 1977) is particularly misleading here.\nIn fact, Goodman was quite aware that Carnap\u2019s work was itself\nanti-foundationalist in the same respect as his. Already in his\ndissertation thesis A Study of Qualities (which was later\ndeveloped into The Structure of Appearance), Goodman\nwrites:\n\n[\u2026] Carnap has made it clear that what we take as ground\nelements [for a constitutional system] is a matter of choice. They are\nnot dignified as the atomic units from which others must be built;\nthey simply constitute one possible starting point. [\u2026] In\nchoosing erlebs, Carnap is plainly seeking to approximate as closely\nas possible what he regards the original epistemological state\n[\u2026] Yet whether it does so or not is no test of the\nsystem. [\u2026] Hence [\u2026] argument concerning whether the\nelements selected are really primitive in knowledge is extraneous to\nthe major purpose of the system. (SQ, 96\u201398)\n\nThe quote makes it obvious that Goodman himself did not consider\nhis constructionalist approach in A Study of Qualities as an\nepistemological alternative to Carnap\u2019s. Insofar as criticism of a\nfoundationalist epistemology does play a role in The Structure of\nAppearance or A Study of Qualities, this criticism was\nrather directed at the philosophy of C.I. Lewis, who was Goodman\u2019s\nteacher at Harvard. Lewis indeed held the view that empiricism must\npresuppose the incorrigibility and indubitability of what is given in\nexperience. According to Lewis, I might need to revise, for example,\nthat I saw a plane crossing the sky when I learn that what I mistook\nfor a plane was Superman. However, nothing can make me revise that\nthere was a blue and a red spot in the center of my visual field that\nthen led to the (false) belief that there was a plane.\nA Study of Qualities, on the other hand, begins with the\nargument that even the simplest judgments of this sort\u2014as the\none about a blue and a red spot in the center of my visual\nfield\u2014might be revised in the light of new evidence. My judgment\nthat I had a blue spot in the middle of my visual field a few seconds\nago when I looked at a ripe apple under normal conditions might be\nrevised when I now judge that I have a red spot in my visual field,\nlooking at the same object under the same conditions and know that it\ncould not have changed its color. However, if such revisions can be\nmade in retrospect, nothing of the \u201cgiven\u201d is indubitable\nor incorrigible. Judgments about qualia, in this sense, are decrees;\nwhich judgments are accepted is a matter of the overall coherence of\nmy system of beliefs and my other qualia judgments. \n\nThe literal unverifiabilty of such quale-recognition is,\nnevertheless, in the last analysis beyond question. If I say the green\npresented by that grass now is the same as the green presented by it\nat a certain past moment, I cannot truly verify that statement because\nI cannot revive that past moment. The statement therefore constitutes\nan arbitrary and supreme decree. But a decree, simply because it is\narbitrary, is not therefore necessarily haphazard. My\nquale-identifications are influenced; I do not feel equally inclined\nto identify the color presented by the grass now with the color\npresented by a cherry a moment ago, though such a decree if made would\nbe equally supreme and unchallengeable on strict grounds. We are all\nmuch in the same position of absolute but sane monarchs; our\npronouncements are law, but we use our heads in making them. (SQ, 17;\ncmp. SA (2nd ed.), 134)\n\nAlso in this respect Goodman is following Carnap and the logical\nempiricists. C.I. Lewis emphasizes this in his \u201cLogical\nPositivism and Pragmatism\u201d (Lewis 1941). There he explains that\nthe main difference between the empiricism of the pragmatists and the\nempiricism of the logical positivists (especially the Carnap\nof Philosophy and Logical Syntax (1935)) is that the latter\nwere ready to analyze empirical knowledge fully in the so-called\n\u201cformal mode\u201d. Accordingly, they analyze empirical\nknowledge as more or less coherent systems of accepted sentences, some\nof which are \u201cprotocols\u201d, some are sentences of\nmathematics and logic, some are generalizations, etc. In particular,\nthe formal mode would not distinguish between statements such as\n\u201cThis object looks red\u201d and \u201cThis object is\nred\u201d.\nFor Lewis, this sort of empiricism is not worthy of the name. After\nall, the experiential element does not seem to show up at all in this\nkind of formal analysis. Lewis claims instead that a proper empiricism\nmust treat sentences of the form \u201cThis looks red.\u201d as\nspecial, indubitable statements. We might err when classifying things\nas being red, but we cannot err when it comes to recognizing things as\nlooking red. This is \u201cthe given\u201d in experience, the\nphenomenal states we find ourselves in when making\nexperiences. Without such an indubitable element, Lewis fears that our\nepistemology would necessarily collapse into a coherence theory of\ntruth (Lewis 1952).  Goodman, on the other hand, is ready to bite that\nbullet when throwing away the indubitable given. Lewis, the major\nadvocate of pragmatism, comments on this move by Goodman that his\n\u201cproposal is, I fear, a little more pragmatic than I dare to\nbe\u201d (Lewis 1952, 118).\nIndeed, Goodman\u2019s early and later philosophy is\nanti-foundationalist. This is truly a characteristic of his work on\ninduction, metaphysics, logic and even the languages of art. It\nshould, however, not be interpreted as a counter program to logical\npositivism.  What Goodman did\u2014in all these areas\u2014is better\nunderstood as a continuation and enlargement of Carnap\u2019s program. This\nis obvious if we consider Goodman\u2019s relativism and irrealism. It is\nalso apparent when we think about his pluralism in logic and his\ninsistence that there are more cognitively valuable representation\nsystems than just the sciences, namely the languages of\nart. His anti-foundationalism therefore is more than just a\nrestatement that there is no \u201cbedrock\u201d for\nknowledge\u2014as was argued by Karl Popper and Otto Neurath,\nbut also that there are no fundamental ontological objects, that there\nare no fundamental logical principles, and that there are no\nprivileged representation systems.  All of these echo Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nfamous Principles of Tolerance (Carnap 1934): tolerance with regards\nto ontology, to logical principles, and to representation systems in\ngeneral. \n",
