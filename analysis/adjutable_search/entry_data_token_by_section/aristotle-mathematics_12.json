    "main_text": "Unit (monas) and Number (arithmos) || Background\n10.1 Background\n\n\nGreek mathematicians tend to conceive of number (arithmos) as\na plurality of units. Perhaps a better translation, without our deeply\nentrenched notions, would be \u2018count\u2019. Their conception\ninvolves: \n\nA number is constructed out of some countable entity, unit\n(monas).\nNumbers are more like concatenations of units and are not sets. To\ndraw a contrast with modern treatments of numbers, a Greek pair or a\ntwo is neither a subset of a triple, nor a member of a triple. It is a\npart of three. If I say that ten cows are hungry, then I am not saying\nthat a set is hungry. Or to point to another use of \u2018set\u2019, my 12 piece\nteaset is in a cabinet, not in an abstract universe. So too, these ten\nunits are a part of these twenty units: \n\n\n\nOne (a unit) typically is not a number (but Aristotle is ambivalent\non this), since a number is a plurality of units.\nAt least in theoretical discussions of numbers, a fractional part\nis not a number.\nIn other words, numbers are members of the series: 2, 3, \u2026,\nwith 1 conceived as the \u2018beginning\u2019 (arch\u00ea)\nof number or as the least number.\nIn early Greek mathematics (5th century), numbers were represented\nby arrangements of pebbles. Later (at least by the 3rd century BCE)\nthey were represented by evenly divided lines.\n\n\n\nFor Aristotle and his contemporaries there are several fundamental\nproblems in understanding number and arithmetic:\n\nThe precision problem of mathematicals is similar in the case of\ngeometrical entities and units (see Section 6). Consider, for example,\nPlato's discussion of incompatible features of a finger as presenting\none or two things to sight. Aristotle deals with the problem in his\ndiscussion of measure (see Section 10.1).\nThe separability problem is the same as for geometry (see Section\n6).\nThe plurality problem of mathematicals (Section 6) is similar in\nthe case of geometrical entities and units, with some differences. To\ncount \u2018perceptible\u2019 units, or rather units from abstraction\n(cf. Section 7.1), one needs some principle of individuating units,\nwhat one is counting, whether cows or categories of predication.\nAristotle says that one can always find an appropriate classification\n(we may assume that some classifications would be fairly convoluted,\nbut that this is at best an aesthetic and not a logical problem). For\nunits, one will use the same principle that allows one to individuate\ntriangles. This is why Aristotle can describe a point as\nunit-having-position. Arithmetic involves the study of entities qua\nindivisible.\nThe unity problem of numbers: This problem\nbedevils philosophy of mathematics from Plato to Husserl. What makes a\ncollection of units a unity which we identify as a number? It cannot be\nphysical juxtaposition of units. Is it merely mental stipulation?\n\n\n\nAristotle does not seem bothered by:\n\nThe overlap problem: What guarantees that when I\nadd this 3 and this 5 that the correct result is not 5, 6, or 7, namely\nthat some units in this 3 are not also in this 5.\n\n\n\nAristotle presents three Academic solutions to these problems. Units\nare comparable if they can be counted together (such as the ten cows in\nthe field). Units are not comparable, if it is conceptually impossible\nto count them together (a less intuitive notion). \n\nIncomparable Units: Form numbers are conceived as\nordinals, with units conceived as being well ordered. What makes this\nnumber 3 is not that it is a concatenation of three units, but that its\nunit is the third unit in this series of units. Hence, it is simply\nfalse that there is a unity of the first three units forming a number\nthree. What makes an ordinary concatenation, e.g., a herd of cows, ten\ncows is that they can be counted according to the series of\nForm-numbers. The notion of incomparable numbers lacks the basic\nconception of numbers as concatenations of units.\nComparable/Incomparable Units: Form numbers are,\nof course, special. Each is a complete unity of units. For example, the\nForm of 3 is a unity of three units. Since it is a unity, it cannot be\nan accident that these three units form this unity. They are comparable\nwith each other in the sense that together they comprise Three Itself\nand perhaps cannot be conceived separately. Hence, they cannot be parts\nof any other Form number. We cannot take 2 units from the Three Itself\nand add them to 4 units in the Six itself, to get a Form-number of the\nSeven itself. Myles Burnyeat once suggested an analogy with a sequence\nof playing cards of one suit, say\n diamonds.[1]\n Each card from ace (unit) to ten contains the appropriate diamonds\n(from 1 to 10) on each card, unified by their being on their\nparticular card. Yet we don't count up two diamonds from the deuce and\ntwo from the trey, but treat each card as a complete unity.\nComparable Units: These are intermediate or\nmathematical numbers (see Section 6). There is a unlimited number of\nunits (enough to do arithmetic), which are arranged and so forth.\nComparable numbers solve the plurality problem, but not the unity\nproblem.\n\n\n\nAristotle reports that some Academics opted for a version of\nIncomparable or Comparable/Incomparable Units to solve the unity\nproblem and introduced comparable units as the objects of mathematical\ntheorems, e.g., given some comparable units, they are even if they can\nbe divided in half, into two concatenations corresponding to\n(participating in) the same Form-number.\n",
