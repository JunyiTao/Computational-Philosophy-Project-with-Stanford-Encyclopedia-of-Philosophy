    "main_text": "\n\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 was a mathematician, theoretical physicist and a\nphilosopher of science famous for discoveries in several fields and\nreferred to as the last polymath, one who could make significant\ncontributions in multiple areas of mathematics and the physical\nsciences. This survey will focus on Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nphilosophy. Concerning Poincar\u00e9\u2019s scientific legacy, see\nBrowder (1983) and Charpentier, Ghys, Lesne (2010).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophy is primarily that of a scientist\noriginating in his own daily practice of science and in the scientific\ndebates of his time. As such, it is strongly influenced by the\nreflections of Ernst Mach, James Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.\nHowever, his thinking is also strongly influenced by the philosophical\ndoctrines of his time (those of Emile Boutroux, who was his\nbrother-in-law, but also of Jules Lachelier, William James, etc.), and\nis imbued with the neokantism that was very much in vogue.\nNevertheless, one must not assume that Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\n\u201cKantian\u201d vocabulary is exactly that of the German\nphilosopher, given that Poincar\u00e9 often radically changes the\nmeaning of Kant\u2019s terms.\n\nIn 1880, he collaborated with \u00c9mile Boutroux on the edition of\nLeibniz\u2019 Monadology, providing an article comparing the\nphysics of Descartes and Leibniz. It was not until the 1890s, however,\nthat he became a central actor in the French philosophical scene,\nnotably through his continuous involvement in the Revue de\nm\u00e9taphysique et de morale (in which he published some\ntwenty articles) and his participation in the organization of a large\nnumber of events: the celebration of the centenary of the birth of\nDescartes, the International Congress of Philosophy of 1900, and the\ninternational edition of the works of Leibniz.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is best known for his critique of logicism and for his\ngeometric conventionalism. The two traditions interpreting\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s work thus reflect, on the one hand, a\nphilosophy of mathematics that endorses his intuitionist tendency and\nhis polemics against logicism or formalism, and, on the other hand,\nhis conventionalism both in the philosophy of science and in a broad\nlinguistic sense. In reality, these intuitionistic and formal aspects\nare two sides of the same coin, given that Poincar\u00e9 always\nsupports a single position aimed at a reconstruction of the process of\nunderstanding scientific theories (see Heinzmann 2010). Neither\nformalistic nor intuitionist nor empiricist, Poincare opens a path\nlying between a realist and an anti-realist theory of mathematical\nknowledge.\n\nAfter providing a short biographical sketch, we will present\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views organized as follows:\n",
