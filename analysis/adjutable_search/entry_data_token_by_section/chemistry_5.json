    "main_text": "Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination || Modern Problems about Mixtures and Compounds\n1.5 Modern Problems about Mixtures and Compounds\n\nContemporary theories of chemical combination arose from a fusion of\nancient theories of proper mixing and hundreds of years of\nexperimental work, which refined those theories. Yet even by the time\nthat Lavoisier inaugurated modern chemistry, chemists had little in\nthe way of rules or principles that govern how elements combine to\nform compounds. In this section, we discuss theoretical efforts to\nprovide such criteria.\n\nA first step towards a theory of chemical combination was implicit in\nLavoisier\u2019s careful experimental work on water. In his Elements of\nChemistry, Lavoisier established the mass proportions of hydrogen\nand oxygen obtained by the complete reduction of water to its\nelements. The fact that his results were based on multiple repetitions\nof this experiment suggests that he assumed compounds like water are\nalways composed of the same elements in the same proportions. This\nwidely shared view about the constant proportions of elements in\ncompounds was first explicitly proclaimed as the law of constant\nproportions by Joseph Louis Proust (1754\u20131826) in the first\nyears of the 19th century. Proust did so in response to Claude Louis\nBerthollet (1748\u20131822), one of Lavoisier\u2019s colleagues and\nsupporters, who argued that compounds could vary in their elemental\ncomposition.\n\nAlthough primarily a theoretical and conceptual posit, the law of\nconstant proportions became an important tool for chemical analysis.\nFor example, chemists had come to understand that atmospheric air is\ncomposed of both nitrogen and oxygen and is not an element. But was\nair a genuine compound of these elements or some looser mixture of\nnitrogen and oxygen, that could vary at different times and in\ndifferent places? The law of constant proportions gave a criterion for\ndistinguishing compounds from genuine mixtures. If air was a compound,\nthen it would always have the same proportion of nitrogen and oxygen\nand it should further be distinguishable from other compounds of\nnitrogen and oxygen such as nitrous oxide. If air was not a genuine\ncompound, then it would be an example of a solution, a\nhomogenous mixture of oxygen and nitrogen that could vary in\nproportions.\n\nBerthollet didn\u2019t accept this rigid distinction between solutions and\ncompounds. He believed that whenever a substance is brought into\ncontact with another, it forms a homogeneous union until further\naddition of the substance leaves the union in excess. For example,\nwhen water and sugar are combined, they initially form a homogenous\nunion. At a certain point, the affinities of water and sugar for one\nanother are saturated, and a second phase of solid sugar will form\nupon the addition of more sugar. This point of saturation will vary\nwith the pressure and temperature of the solution. Berthollet\nmaintained that just as the amount of sugar in a saturated solution\nvaries with temperature and pressure, the proportions of elements in\ncompounds are sensitive to ambient conditions. Thus, he argued, it is\nnot true that substances are always composed of the same proportions\nof the element and this undermines the law of constant proportions.\nBut after a lengthy debate, chemists came to accept that the evidence\nProust adduced established the law of constant proportions for\ncompounds, which were thereby distinguished from solutions.\n\nChemists\u2019 attention was largely directed towards the investigation of\ncompounds in the first half of the 19th century, initially with a view\nto broadening the evidential basis which Proust had provided. For a\ntime, the law of constant proportions seemed a satisfactory criterion\nof the occurrence of chemical combination. But towards the end of the\n19th century, chemists turned their attention to solutions.\nTheir investigation of solutions drew on the new science of\nthermodynamics, which said that changes of state undergone by\nsubstances when they are brought into contact were subjected to its\nlaws governing energy and entropy.\n\nAlthough thermodynamics provided no sharp distinction between\ncompounds and solutions, it did allow the formulation of a concept for\na special case called an ideal solution. An ideal solution\nforms because its increased stability compared with the separated\ncomponents is entirely due to the entropy of mixing. This can be\nunderstood as a precisification of the idea of a purely mechanical\nmixture. In contrast, compounds were stabilized by interactions\nbetween their constituent components over and above the entropy of\nmixing. For example, solid sodium chloride is stabilized by the\ninteractions of sodium and chlorine, which react to form sodium\nchloride. The behavior of real solutions could be compared with that\nof an ideal solution, and it turned out that non-ideality was the rule\nrather than the exception. Ideality is approached only in certain\ndilute binary solutions. More often, solutions exhibited behavior\nwhich could only be understood in terms of significant chemical\ninteractions between the components, of the sort characteristic of\nchemical combination.\n\nLong after his death, in the first decades of the 20th century,\nBerthollet was partially vindicated with the careful characterization\nof a class of substances that we now call Berthollides. These are\ncompounds whose proportions of elements do not stand in simple\nrelations to one another. Their elemental proportions are not fixed,\nbut vary with temperature and pressure. For example, the mineral\nw\u00fcstite, or ferrous oxide, has an approximate compositional\nformula of FeO, but typically has somewhat less iron than oxygen.\n\nFrom a purely macroscopic, thermodynamic perspective, Berthollides can\nbe understood in terms of the minimization of the thermodynamic\nfunction called the Gibbs free energy, which accommodates the\ninterplay of energy and entropy as functions of temperature and\npressure. Stable substances are ones with minimal Gibbs free energy.\nOn the microscopic scale, the basic microstructure of ferrous oxide is\na three-dimensional lattice of ferrous (Fe2+) and oxide\n(O2-) ions. However, some of the ferrous ions are replaced\nby holes randomly distributed in the crystal lattice, which generates\nan increase in entropy compared with a uniform crystal structure. An\noverall imbalance of electrical charge would be created by the missing\nions. But this is countered in ferrous oxide by twice that number of\nions from those remaining being converted to ferric (Fe3+)\nions. This removal of electrons requires an input of\nenergy, which would make for a less stable structure were it not for\nthe increased entropy afforded by the holes in the crystal structure.\nThe optimal balance between these forces depends on the temperature\nand pressure, and this is described by the Gibbs free energy function.\n\n\nAlthough the law of constant proportions has not survived the\ndiscovery of Berthollides and more careful analyses of solutions\nshowed that chemical combination or affinity is not confined to\ncompounds, it gave chemists a principled way of studying how elements\ncombine to form compounds through the 19th century. This\naccount of Berthollides also illustrates the interplay between\nmacroscopic and microscopic theory which is a regular feature of\nmodern chemistry, and which we turn to in the next section.\n\nChemistry has traditionally distinguished itself from classical\nphysics by its interest in the division of matter into different\nsubstances and in chemical combination, the process whereby substances\nare held together in compounds and solutions. In this section, we have\ndescribed how chemists came to understand that all substances were\ncomposed of the Periodic Table\u2019s elements, and that these elements are\nactual components of substances. Even with this knowledge,\ndistinguishing pure substances from heterogeneous mixtures and\nsolutions remained a very difficult chemical challenge. And despite\nchemists\u2019 acceptance of the law of definite proportions as a criterion\nfor substancehood, chemical complexities such as the discovery of the\nBerthollides muddied the waters.\n",
