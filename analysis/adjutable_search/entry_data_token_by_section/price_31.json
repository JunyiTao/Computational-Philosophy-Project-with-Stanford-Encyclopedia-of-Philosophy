The level of guarantee, however,\nis below that of knowledge claims, which he takes Austin to have shown\nto be performatory and convey a guarantee of truth. Price leaves it\nunclear whether publicly self-ascribed beliefs can count both as\nguarantees and as self-descriptions of one\u2019s state of mind\n(e.g., as being that of belief).\n\nSecond, Price (1969: 42f) suggests that knowledge-ascriptions are\nnormally dispositional, ascribing to subjects a condition explicable\nin counterfactual terms. He notes that we have ways of ascribing what\nis actually factual knowledge in indirect forms\u2014for example,\n\u201cS knows where A is\u201d\u2014but if such an\nascription is to be true it requires that S knows that p\nwhere p is of the form \u201cA is at place so and\nso\u201d (1969: 49\u201350). A different kind of\nknowledge-ascription is \u201cknowledge-by-acquaintance\u201d (see\n \u00a73.7),\n which he understands as knowledge of items, say a place or a person,\nwhich he takes to ground knowledge-by-description, meaning what we\nhave been told in general terms. Knowledge-by-description is only\ngenuine if we can relate the descriptions to what we can sense, the\nrealm of acquaintance. Both Russell earlier and Strawson later\ndeveloped in their own ways this link, though Price credits Jane\nAusten (1811: ch. 21) with drawing the distinction 100 years before\nRussell (1969: 63). Third, Price (1969: 50) follows Ryle:\n\u201cknow-how\u201d ascriptions are in some sense practical and not\nreducible to factual claims.\n\nFinally, Price (1969: ch. 3) defends a variant of the standard account\nof propositional knowledge: in many cases the condition for\nknowing that p is that the subject S believes with full\ncertainty that p, and has conclusive reasons for thinking that\np, and p is true. However, this analysis only applies\nwhere the conviction is generated by inference. Where S simply\nobserves that p, e.g., that something is red or that\nshe\u2019s having a pain, no reasons or inference is involved. The\nanalysis of knowledge in such cases, according to Price, cannot centre\non belief. Thus, knowledge isn\u2019t analysed in just one way.\nEarlier, Price (1930b: 200) claims that knowledge is a\n\u201cdirect\u201d cognitive relation to its objects and is a\n\u201cstate where the distinction between sure and unsure does not\narise at all\u201d.\n",
