    "main_text": "Semantics and Modality || Carnap\u2019s New Priorities\n6.2 Carnap\u2019s New Priorities\n\nThere are two main changes leading from the linguistic frameworks of\nthe Logical Syntax to the \u201csemantic systems\u201d of\nMeaning and Necessity: Carnap took the semantic turn,\nallowing for a relation of reference or designation; and beyond that\nhe allowed for intensional operators which he supplied with a new\nintensional semantics.\n\nFrom Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (1939) (and\nIntroduction to Semantics, 1942) Carnap had taken up\nTarski\u2019s conception of semantic truth. The principle of\ntolerance in the Logical Syntax remained intact, but in the\nfollowing refined form: the syntactic rules of formation can be chosen\nfreely; if the syntactical rules of transformation (derivation,\ninference) are determined prior to the semantic rules, they may be\ndetermined freely as well, but the semantic rules will have to be\nselected such that the transformation rules are sound with respect to\nthem; vice versa, if the semantic rules are chosen prior to\nthe transformation rules, the former may be determined freely, in\nwhich case the latter will need to match the former by being sound\nwith respect to them (see, e.g., section 12 of Carnap 1939).\nCompletely new questions arose, e.g., whether the rules of inference\nof classical propositional logic would determine the semantics of the\nstandard logical connectives uniquely (given certain\nconstraints): this novel type of categoricity question was answered in\nthe negative by Carnap (1943). (In recent years, this part of\nCarnap\u2019s work has sparked a lively debate: see, e.g.,\nRaatikainen 2008, Murzi & Hjortland 2009.) Semantics became just\nas important in Carnap\u2019s work for the construction of formal\nlanguages as syntax had been in the Logical Syntax.\n\nSecondly, Carnap extended Tarski\u2019s extensional semantics by a\nnew intensional one, in which the truth values of sentences with\noperators creating intensional contexts (such as a sentential operator\nfor necessity) can also be determined compositionally. Carnap\u2019s\ninvention of what would become \u201cpossible worlds\nsemantics,\u201d which he showed one could spell out in an\nextensional metalanguage, had a decisive influence on the development\nof modal logic and intensional semantics. Even though there are\nsignificant differences between modern \u201cKripke semantics\u201d\n(which is rightly associated with Saul Kripke\u2019s work),\nCarnap\u2019s intensional semantics is still a possible worlds\nsemantics in the sense that it evaluates formulas at possible worlds\n(\u201cstate-descriptions\u201d in Carnap\u2019s terminology), and\nthe semantic rule for Carnap\u2019s operator \u2018N\u2019\nfor (logical) necessity invokes universal quantification over worlds:\n\\(N(A)\\) holds in state-description s if and only if\nA holds in every state-description (see \u00a741 of\nMeaning and Necessity; the differences and similarities to\nKripke semantics are explained in detail in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 1)).\n On the side of theoretical linguistics, Richard Montague\u2019s\nlater intensional semantics for natural language built on\nCarnap\u2019s semantics (see Partee 2011).\n\nAs discussed in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 2),\n he partially weakened his early radical thesis of extensionality by\nthe time of Meaning and Necessity.\n",
