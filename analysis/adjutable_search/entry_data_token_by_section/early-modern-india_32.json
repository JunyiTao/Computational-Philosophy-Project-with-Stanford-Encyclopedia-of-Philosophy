The Manual of Reason defines these items as\nfollows (TS 83): \u201cthose entities which reside in the eternal\nsubstances [i.e. the atoms] and function as their differentiators are\ncalled vi\u015be\u1e63a\u201d. The idea is that, just as a\ncow and a horse are distinct entities, as they have distinct\nproperties, so too even two atoms of the same substance, e.g. earth,\nmust differ with respect to at least one property. Each atom,\ntherefore, possesses a \u2018differentium\u2019 unique to itself,\nwhich serves to distinguish it from any other atom of the same type.\nThe assumption, then, is that any two non-identical items are\ndistinguished by virtue of possessing distinct properties. This is the\ncontraposed version of Leibniz\u2019 Law that Indiscernibles are\nIdentical, that (\u2200P)(Px \u2261\nPy) \u2192 (x = y), where\n\u201cP\u201d ranges over properties. The principle faces\ntriviality unless certain constraints are placed on the range of\nproperties quantified over. For example, if the property\n\u201c\u2026 = y\u201d is permitted, the principle states\nvacuously that identicals are identical. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nimplicitly restrict the principle to intrinsic, non-relational\nproperties of the objects concerned, ruling out, for example,\n\u2018being at a certain spatial or temporal location\u2019 as being\na property capable of discriminating two otherwise identical objects.\nThus, the claim seems to be that no two objects, including atoms, can\nbe intrinsically identical. This is how Leibniz himself appears to\nhave understood his Law, saying that \u201cIt is always necessary\nthat beside the difference of time and place there be internal\nprinciples of distinction\u2026.thus although time and place serve\nin distinguishing things, we do not easily distinguish them by\nthemselves,\u201d and that \u201cThere is no such thing as two\nindividuals indiscernible from each other. Two drops of water, or\nmilk, viewed with a microscope, will appear distinguishable from each\nother\u201d.\n\nThe principle is, admittedly, as strong one. Wittgenstein\n(Tractatus 5.5302) points out that it entails the logical\nimpossibility of a universe containing two identical spheres; Wiggins\nnotes that it implies the logical impossibility of even a single\nsphere (or any other symmetrical object), since it entails the\nidentity of the two hemispheres (and so on until one reaches a\ngeometrical point). More to the point, as the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nimplicitly realised, it implies the logical impossibility of more than\none atom of a given substance (having a certain velocity, spin, etc.).\nRather than reject the principle, however, they instead introduced new\nintrinsic properties, the basic differentia, thereby avoiding the\nunpalatable consequence.\n",
