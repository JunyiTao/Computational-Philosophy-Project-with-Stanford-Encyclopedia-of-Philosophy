    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea of justice occupies centre stage both in ethics, and in legal\nand political philosophy. We apply it to individual actions, to laws,\nand to public policies, and we think in each case that if they are\nunjust this is a strong, maybe even conclusive, reason to reject them.\nClassically, justice was counted as one of the four cardinal virtues\n(and sometimes as the most important of the four); in modern times\nJohn Rawls famously described it as \u2018the first virtue of social\ninstitutions\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p.3; Rawls, 1999, p.3). We might\ndebate which of these realms of practical philosophy has first claim\non justice: is it first and foremost a property of the law, for\nexample, and only derivatively a property of individuals and other\ninstitutions? But it is probably more enlightening to accept that the\nidea has over time sunk deep roots in each of these domains, and to\ntry to make sense of such a wide-ranging concept by identifying\nelements that are present whenever justice is invoked, but also\nexamining the different forms it takes in various practical contexts.\nThis article aims to provide a general map of the ways in which\njustice has been understood by philosophers, past and present.\n\nWe begin by identifying four core features that distinguish justice\nfrom other moral and political ideas. We then examine some major\nconceptual contrasts: between conservative and ideal justice, between\ncorrective and distributive justice, between procedural and\nsubstantive justice, and between comparative and non-comparative\njustice. Next we turn to questions of scope: to who or what do\nprinciples of justice apply? We ask whether non-human animals can be\nsubjects of justice, whether justice applies only between people who\nalready stand in a particular kind of relationship to one another, and\nwhether individual people continue to have duties of justice once\njustice-based institutions have been created. We then examine three\noverarching theories that might serve to unify the different forms of\njustice: utilitarianism, contractarianism, and egalitarianism. But it\nseems, in conclusion, that no such theory is likely be successful.\n\nMore detailed discussions of particular forms of justice can be found\nin other entries: see especially\n distributive justice,\n global justice,\n intergenerational justice,\n international distributive justice,\n justice and bad luck,\n justice as a virtue, and\n retributive justice.\n",
