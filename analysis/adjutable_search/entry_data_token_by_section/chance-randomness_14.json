    "main_text": "Randomness Without Chance || Short Sequences\n5.1 Short Sequences\n\n\nFor many short sequences, even the most efficient prefix-free code\nwill be no shorter than the original sequence (as prefix-free codes\ncontain information about the length of the sequence as well as its\ncontent, if the sequence is very short the most efficient code may well\nbe the sequence itself prefixed with its length, which will be longer\nthan the sequence). So all short sequences will be Kolmogorov random.\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but if randomness indicates a lack of\npattern or repetition, then sequences which are too short to display\npattern or repetition must be random. Of course it will not usually be\nuseful to say that such sequences are random, mostly because in very\nshort sequences we are unlikely to talk of the sequence at all, as\nopposed to talking directly about its constituent outcomes.\n\n\nBecause of the modal aspect of RCT, for most processes there will\npossibly be a long enough sequence of outcomes to overcome any\n\u2018accidental\u2019 randomness due to actual brevity of the\noutcome sequence. But for events which are unrepeatable or seldom\nrepeatable, even the merely possible suitable reference classes will be\nsmall. And such unrepeatable events do exist\u2014consider the Big\nBang which began our universe, or your birth (your birth, not\nthe birth of qualitatively indistinguishable counterpart), or the death\nof Ned Kelly. These events are all part of outcome sequences that are\nnecessarily short, and hence these events are part of Kolmogorov random\nsequences. But it is implausible to say that all of these events\nhappened by chance; no probabilistic theory need be invoked to predict\nor explain any of them. In the case of Kelly\u2019s death, for example,\nwhile it may have been a matter of chance when he happened to die, it\nwas not chance that he died, as it is (physically) necessary that he\ndid. So there are random sequences\u2014those which are essentially\nshort\u2014in which each outcome did not happen by chance.\n\n\nThe natural response is to reject the idea that short sequences are\napt to be random. The right hand side of RCT makes room for this, for\nwe may simply insist that unrepeatable events cannot be repeated often\nenough to give rise to an adequate sequence (whether or not the\ninadequate sequence they do in fact give rise to is random). The\nproblem here is that we can now have chance without randomness, if\nthere is a single-case unrepeatable chance event. Difficulties in fact\nseem unavoidable. If we consider the outcomes alone, either all short\nsequences are random or none of them are; there is no way to\ndifferentiate on the basis of any product-based notion between\ndifferent short sequences. But as some single unrepeatable events are\nchancy, and some are not, whichever way we opt to go with respect to\nrandomness of the singleton sequences of such events we will discover\ncounterexamples to one direction or another of RCT.\n",
