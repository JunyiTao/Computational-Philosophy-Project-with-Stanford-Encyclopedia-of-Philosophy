    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The Legal Issues\n8.3 Property Rights\n\nSpecial problems arise if the property involved is such that the use\nof it involves consuming it\u2014e.g., food. In that case, it appears\nthat there is no real difference between ownership and even temporary\nuse. For things like food, using them amounts for practical purposes\nto owning them; they cannot be recalled after they are used. In short,\nfor John XXII, it follows that it is impossible fully to live the life\nof absolute poverty, even for the individual person (much less for a\npermanent institution like the Franciscan order). The institution of\nproperty, and property \u201crights,\u201d therefore began in the\nGarden of Eden, the first time Adam or Eve ate something. These\nproperty rights are not \u201cnatural\u201d rights; on the contrary,\nthey are established by a kind of positive law by God, who gave\neverything in the Garden to Adam and Eve.\n\nOckham disagreed. For him, there was no \u201cproperty\u201d in the\nGarden of Eden. Instead, Adam and Eve there had a natural right to use\nanything at hand. This natural right did not amount to a\nproperty right, however, since it could not have been used as\nthe basis of any kind of legal claim. Both John XXII and Ockham seem\nto agree in requiring that \u201cproperty\u201d (ownership) be a\nmatter of positive law, not simply of natural law. But John says there\nwas such property in the Garden of Eden, whereas Ockham claims there\nwas not; there was only a natural right, so that Adam and\nEve\u2019s use of the goods there was legitimate. For Ockham,\n\u201cproperty\u201d first emerged only after the Fall when, by a\nkind of divine permission, people began to set up special positive\nlegal arrangements assigning the legal right to use certain things to\ncertain people (the owners), to the exclusion of anyone else\u2019s\nhaving a legal right to them. The owners can then give\npermission to others to use what the owners own, but that permission\ndoes not amount to giving them a legal right they could appeal to in a\ncourt of law; it can be revoked at any time. For Ockham, this is the\nway the Franciscans operate. Their benefactors and donors do not give\nthem any legal rights to use the things donated to them\u2014i.e., no\nright they could appeal to in a court of law. Rather the donation\namounts only to a kind of permission that restores the original\nnatural (not legal) right of use in the Garden of\n Eden.[56]\n",
