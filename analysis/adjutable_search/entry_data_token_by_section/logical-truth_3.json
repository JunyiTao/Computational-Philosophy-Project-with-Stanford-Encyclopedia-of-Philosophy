    "main_text": "The Mathematical Characterization of Logical Truth || Derivability\n2.2 Derivability\n\nWe just noted that the Fregean logician's formalized grammar amounts\nto an algorithm for producing formulae from the basic artificial\nsymbols. This is meant very literally. As was clear to mathematical\nlogicians from very early on, the basic symbols can be seen as (or\ncodified by) natural numbers, and the formation rules in the\nartificial grammar can be seen as (or codified by) simple computable\narithmetical operations. The grammatical formulae can then be seen as\n(or codified by) the numbers obtainable from the basic numbers after\nsome finite series of applications of the operations, and thus their\nset is characterizable in terms of concepts of arithmetic and set\ntheory (in fact arithmetic suffices, with the help of some\ntricks).\n\nExactly the same is true of the set of formulae that are derivable in\na formalized deductive calculus. A formula \\(F\\) is derivable in a\nFregean calculus \\(C\\) just in case \\(F\\) is obtainable from the\naxioms of \\(C\\) after some finite series of applications of the rules\nof inference of \\(C\\). But the axioms are certain formulae built by\nthe process of grammatical formation, so they can be seen as (or\ncodified by) certain numbers; and the rules of inference can again be\nseen as (or codified by) certain computable arithmetical operations.\nSo the derivable formulae can be seen as (or codified by) the numbers\nobtainable from the axiom numbers after some finite series of\napplications of the inference operations, and thus their set is again\ncharacterizable in terms of concepts of standard mathematics (again\narithmetic suffices).\n\nIn the time following Frege's revolution, there appears to have been a\nwidespread belief that the set of logical truths of any Fregean\nlanguage could be characterized as the set of formulae derivable in\nsome suitably chosen calculus (hence, essentially, as the set of\nnumbers obtainable by certain arithmetical operations). Frege himself\nsays, speaking of the higher-order language in his\n\u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d, that through formalization (in the\nthird sense above) \u201cwe arrive at a small number of laws in\nwhich, if we add those contained in the rules, the content of all the\nlaws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state\u201d (Frege 1879,\n\u00a713). The idea follows straightforwardly from Russell's\nconception of mathematics and logic as identical (see Russell 1903,\nch. I, \u00a710; Russell 1920, pp. 194\u20135) and his thesis that\n\u201cby the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other\npremises of a general logical nature (\u2026), all mathematics can\nbe strictly and formally deduced\u201d (Russell 1903, ch. I,\n\u00a74). See also Bernays (1930, p. 239): \u201c[through\nformalization] it becomes evident that all logical inference\n(\u2026) can be reduced to a limited number of logical elementary\nprocesses that can be exactly and completely enumerated\u201d. In the\nopening paragraphs of his paper on logical consequence, Tarski (1936a,\n1936b) says that the belief was prevalent before the appearance of\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (see subsection 2.4.3 below for\nthe bearing of these theorems on this issue). In recent times,\napparently due to the influence of Tarskian arguments such as the one\nmentioned towards the end of subsection 2.4.3, the belief in the\nadequacy of derivability characterizations seems to have waned (see\ne.g. Prawitz 1985 for a similar appraisal).\n",
