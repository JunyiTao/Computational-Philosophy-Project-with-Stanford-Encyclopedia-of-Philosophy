    "main_text": "Hui Shi\n5. Hui Shi\n\nHui Shi (fl. 313 B.C.E.) is a complex figure, familiar and indistinct\nby turns. He is mentioned in at least eight early texts. Only two, the\nXunzi and the Zhuangzi \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d\nessay, give any information about his philosophical views, and they\nmerely attribute a series of theses to him without recording his\narguments. For a review of biographical information about him, see the\nsupplementary document.\n\nLife of Hui Shi\n\n\nWe have no direct evidence of Hui Shi\u2019s views on language and\nmeaning. But as Graham points out (1989: 81), a story preserved in a\nHan dynasty text suggests that he may have held a view similar to that\nof the Mohists (Canon B70) (see the entries on\n Mohism\n and the\n Mohist Canons).\n Language enables us to communicate by indicating that the objects\nreferred to are similar to things we already know, the kinds of\nobjects conventionally denoted by those words.\n\nA client said to the King of Liang, \u201cIn talking about things,\nHui Shi is fond of using analogies. If you don\u2019t let him use\nanalogies, he won\u2019t be able to speak.\u201d The King said,\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d The next day he saw Hui Shi and said, \u201cI\nwish that when you speak about things, you speak directly, without\nusing analogies.\u201d Hui Shi said, \u201cSuppose there\u2019s a\nman here who doesn\u2019t know what a dan is. If he says,\n\u2018What are the features of a dan like?\u2019 and we\nanswer, saying, \u2018The features of a dan are like a\ndan,\u2019 then would that communicate it?\u201d The King\nsaid, \u201cIt would not.\u201d \u201cThen if we instead answered,\n\u2018The features of a dan are like a bow, but with a\nbamboo string,\u2019 then would he know?\u201d The King said,\n\u201cIt can be known.\u201d Hui Shi said, \u201cExplanations are\ninherently a matter of using what a person knows to communicate what\nhe doesn\u2019t know, thereby causing him to know it. Now if you say,\n\u2018No analogies,\u2019 that\u2019s inadmissible.\u201d The King\nsaid, \u201cGood!\u201d (Shuo Yuan, Ch. 11; cf. Graham\n1989: 81)\n\n\nAs we would expect from mainstream Chinese theories of language and\ndisputation, Hui Shi is accustomed to explaining things by appeal to\nanalogies. Indeed, his answer to the king is itself an analogy, or at\nleast an illustrative example (the Chinese word for\n\u201canalogy,\u201d pi, refers to both). We can also\nnotice from the story that in seeking to learn about something\nunknown, one does not ask for a definition of the object, but\nfor a description of what its features \u201care like.\u201d The\nstandard response is to cite a familiar analogue and then point out\nthe differences between the unknown object and the familiar one.\nCommunication proceeds not by knowing \u201cmeanings,\u201d but by\nknowing how to distinguish similar from different kinds of\n things.[10]\n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d is overwhelmingly critical of Hui Shi:\n\nHui Shi daily applied his wits in disputation with the others, but\nonly in comparison with the disputers of the world was he exceptional,\nthat\u2019s the bottom of it.\u2026Weak in virtue, strong on\nexternal things, his path was crooked. Viewed from the perspective of\nthe Way (dao) of Heaven and Earth, Hui Shi\u2019s abilities\nwere like the labors of a mosquito or gnat. Even with respect to\nexternal things, what use were they? (cf. Graham 1981: 285)\n\n\nThe text concludes that he wasted his talents \u201cchasing after the\nmyriad things,\u201d in his many directions of inquiry, instead of\nconcentrating on a single path. As a result, he only \u201cended with\na name for being good at disputation.\u201d This dismissal is less an\nobjective evaluation of Hui Shi\u2019s inquiries than an expression\nof the intellectual orientation of the essay\u2019s Han dynasty\nauthor, who values only moral cultivation and commitment to an ethical\nand political dao (way), not inquiry for inquiry\u2019s\nsake. It seems likely that we would have considered Hui Shi\u2019s\nexplanations of \u201cthe myriad things\u201d to be of great\ninterest. \n",
