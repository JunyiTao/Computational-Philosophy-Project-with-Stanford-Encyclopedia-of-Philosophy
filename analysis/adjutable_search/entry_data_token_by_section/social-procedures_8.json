The Logic of Communication\n\nCommunication protocols are important in distributed computing:\ncomputing with distributed systems, where a distributed system is a\nset of computers that are connected through a communication network.\nCommunication protocols are also interesting from a philosophical\nperspective, especially in the context of discussions of the value of\nprivacy (see entries on\n privacy\n and\n computing and moral responsibility).\n The formal approach can help in answering philosophical questions\nsuch as \u201cDoes more security automatically lead to less\nprivacy?\u201d.\n",
