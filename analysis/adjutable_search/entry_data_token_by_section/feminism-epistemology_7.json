Feminists regard\nthe following conceptions of objectivity as problematic: (a)\nSubject/object dichotomy: what is really (\u201cobjectively\u201d)\nreal exists independently of knowers. (b) Aperspectivity:\n\u201cobjective\u201d knowledge is ascertained through \u201cthe\nview from nowhere,\u201d a view that transcends or abstracts from our\nparticular locations. (c) Detachment: knowers have an\n\u201cobjective\u201d stance toward what is known when they are\nemotionally detached from it. (d) Value-neutrality: knowers have an\n\u201cobjective\u201d stance toward what is known when they adopt an\nevaluatively neutral attitude toward it. (e) Control:\n\u201cobjective\u201d knowledge of an object (the way it\n\u201creally\u201d is) is attained by controlling it, especially by\nexperimental manipulation, and observing the regularities it manifests\nunder control. (f) External guidance: \u201cobjective\u201d\nknowledge consists of representations whose content is dictated by the\nway things really are, not by the knower. These ideas are often\ncombined into a package of claims about science: that its aim is to\nknow the way things are, independent of knowers, and that scientists\nachieve this aim through detachment and control, which enable them to\nachieve aperspectivity and external guidance. This package arose in\nthe 17th-18th centuries, as a philosophical account of why Newtonian\nscience was superior to its predecessor. According to this account,\nthe predecessor science, which represented objects as intrinsically\npossessing secondary qualities and ends, confused the way things are\nin themselves with the ways they are related to emotionally engaged\nhuman knowers, who erroneously projected their own mental states and\nvalue judgments onto things. Adoption of the objective methods listed\nabove enabled the successor scientists to avoid these errors and\nachieve an \u201cabsolute\u201d conception of the universe (Williams\n1978). Feminists object to each element in this package as a normative\nideal and as a general description of how science works.\n\nSubject/object dichotomy. If the object of science is to\ngrasp things as they are, independent of knowers, then one must\nsharply distinguish the knower from the known. However, when the\nobjects of inquiry are knowers themselves, this dichotomy rules out\nthe possibility that knowers\u2019 self-understandings help\nconstitute the ways knowers are. It thus rules out the possibility\nthat some of our characteristics are socially constructed. This may\nlead people to make the projective errors objectivity is supposed to\navoid: attributing to the natures of the objects of study what are\nproducts of people\u2019s contingent beliefs and attitudes about\nthose objects (Haslanger 1995).\n\nAperspectivity. The ideal of aperspectivity supposes that if\none views things from no particular position, without any\npresuppositions or biases, then the only thing that guides\nbelief-formation is the object itself (external guidance). Feminists\nquestion the intelligibility of a \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d and\na presuppositionless, bias-free science, for both postmodernist\n(Haraway 1991) and pragmatist (Antony 1993) reasons. Knowers are\nsituated. The underdetermination of theories by evidence implies that\nbiases are needed to get theorizing off the ground. Rather than\nundertake a futile attempt to inquire without biases, we should\nempirically study which biases are fruitful and which mislead, and\nreform scientific practice accordingly (Antony 1993). Some feminist\ncritics also argue that the practice of objectivity\u2014assuming\nthat observed regularities reflect the intrinsic natures of things,\nand treating those things accordingly\u2014when adopted by those in\npower, produces the very regularities taken to vindicate that\nassumption. When male observers use their power to make women behave\nin accordance with their desires (for instance, to elicit female\nsubmission to their aggressive sexual advances), but assume their own\naperspectivity, they misattribute the behavior to women\u2019s\nintrinsic natures (feminine passivity) rather than to their own socially positioned power.  This process constitutes the\n\u201cobjectification\u201d of women. It harms women by legitimating\nthe sexist practices that reinforce the projection. It misrepresents\nobserved regularities as necessary, rather than socially contingent,\nas well as their cause (as generated by the intrinsic nature of the\nthings observed, rather than by the observer\u2019s own stance toward\nwhat is observed.) (MacKinnon 1999, Haslanger 1993).\n\nDetachment. The ideal of detachment, according to which\nscientists should adopt an emotionally distanced, controlling stance\ntoward their objects of study, is defended as necessary to avoid\nprojective error. Keller suggests that it is responsible for the\nsymbolically \u201cmasculine\u201d standing of science that\nmarginalizes women scientists, who are stereotyped as emotional. It\nreflects an androcentric perspective, serving men\u2019s neurotic\nanxieties about avoiding the \u201cfeminine\u201d (Keller 1985a,\nBordo 1987). Emotional distance may also have epistemic defects. A\n\u201cfeeling for the [individual] organism\u201d may sensitize a\nscientist to critical data (Keller 1983, Ruetsche 2004).\n\nValue-neutrality. The ideal of objectivity as\nvalue-neutrality is justified as a psychological stance needed to\nguard against temptations toward wishful thinking and dogmatic,\npolitically motivated or ideological reasoning. Feminists argue that\nthis ideal is self-deceptive and unrealistic (Potter 1993; Longino\n1990, 2001; Harding 1991, 1998; Wylie 1996). When scientists represent\nthemselves as neutral, this blocks their recognition of the ways their\nvalues have shaped their inquiry, and thereby evades critical scrutiny\nof these values. Value-neutrality ignores the many positive roles\nvalue judgments play in guiding the process and products of inquiry\nnoted above. Other procedures are available to block wishful thinking\nand political dogmatism on science, without requiring scientists to\nbracket their value judgments (Anderson 1995, 2004, Longino 2001).\n\nControl. Experimental contexts, in which scientists elicit\nregularities in the behavior of the objects of study by manipulating\nthem under controlled conditions, are often taken to generate\nepistemically privileged evidence about the objects of study. Such\nevidence is thought to ground knowledge of how the objects\n\u201creally are,\u201d in contrast with evidence about the objects\nof study generated through \u201csubjective\u201d methods, such as\nparticipant observation, dialogue, political engagement, and caring\nfor their needs. Feminists argue that control is a stance of social,\noften male, power. The epistemic privilege it enjoys reflects both\nandrocentrism and the prestige attached to the \u201cmasculine\u201d\n(Merchant 1980). The control ideal underrates the epistemic value of\nexperiences gained from loving or cooperative engagement with the\nobjects of study. Theories produced by control generate only a partial\nview of the potentialities of the objects of study, reflecting and\nserving interests in control over the objects, but not interests in\nengaging with the objects in other ways, or in enabling the objects of\nstudy, if human, to govern themselves (Tiles 1987).\n\nExternal guidance. External guidance assumes that to achieve\nknowledge of the way things \u201cobjectively\u201d are, one\u2019s\nbeliefs must be guided by the nature of the object, not by the biases\nof the knower. Feminists argue that the underdetermination of theories\nby evidence entails that theories cannot be purely externally guided.\nInquirers must make numerous choices concerning how to represent the\nobject of knowledge, how to interpret evidence, and how to represent\nthe conclusions drawn (Anderson 2004, Longino 1990, Nelson 1990). The\npretense that sound scientific theories are the products of purely\nexternal guidance obscures the forces shaping these choices and\nabsolves scientists from responsibility for defending them. For\nexample, feminists have paid particular attention to the ways\nmetaphors and narrative genres constrain scientific explanations\n(Haraway 1989, 1991, Martin 1996). The decision to narrate the\ntransition from ape to hominid as a heroic drama dictates a focus on\npresumptively male activities, such as hunting, as the engine of\nevolution, obscuring alternatives equally supported by the data, that\nfocus on presumptively female activity (balancing child care needs\nwith gathering) or on behaviors, such as language use, shared by both\nmales and females (Haraway 1989, Longino 1990).\n\nThese feminist criticisms of different conceptions of objectivity\nshare common themes. The problematic conceptions of objectivity\ngenerate partial accounts of the world, which they\nmisrepresent as complete and universal. The forms of partiality they\nunderwrite are either androcentric, symbolized as\n\u201cmasculine,\u201d or serve male or other dominant group\ninterests. They are justified by appealing to models of cognition that\nrepresent error and bias in terms of qualities gender symbolized as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d and attributed to women. Such conceptions of\nobjectivity, in recommending avoidance of the \u201cfeminine,\u201d\nexclude women from participation in inquiry or deprive them of\nepistemic authority. The problematic conceptions of objectivity ignore\nthe knowledge-enhancing, epistemically fruitful uses of purportedly\n\u201cfeminine\u201d approaches to theorizing. In attempting to\ntranscend their situatedness, inquirers following these ideals of\nobjectivity only mask it, commit the projective errors they seek to\navoid, and resist correction.\n\nFeminist Conceptions of Objectivity. Feminist\nconceptions of objectivity tend to be procedural. Products of inquiry\nare more objective, the better they are supported by objective\nprocedures. Some influential feminist conceptions of objectivity\ninclude the following:\n\nFeminist/nonsexist research methods. Some feminists have\noffered methodological guidelines for avoiding the sexist and\nandrocentric errors and biases that feminists have identified in\nmainstream science (Eichler 1988). More ambitiously, feminists have\nsought research methods that embody feminist values (Nielsen 1990,\nReinharz 1992).\n\nEmotional engagement. Some feminist theorists defend the\nepistemic fruitfulness of emotional engagement with the object of\nstudy. Emotions serve epistemic functions in normative inquiry,\nattuning observers to evaluatively relevant features of the world\n(Jaggar 1989, Little 1995, Anderson 2004). In social scientific\ninquiry, emotional engagement with the subjects of study may be\nnecessary both to elicit and interpret behaviors of scientific\ninterest. Ethnographers may need to win the trust of their subjects to\nget them to open up, and to achieve rapport with them to gain\nunderstanding. Keller (1985a) promotes an ideal of \u201cdynamic\nobjectivity,\u201d by which loving attention toward the object\nenhances perception of it. However, Longino (1993b) questions whether\nthis ideal is generally epistemically superior to other modes of\nengagement.\n\nReflexivity. Harding (1993) argues that the objectivity is\nadvanced by reflexivity, which demands that inquirers place themselves\non the same causal plane as the object of knowledge. They must make\nexplicit their situatedness and how that shaped their inquiry.\nReflexivity affirms the partiality of representations without denying\ntheir claim to truth. Inclusion of marginalized groups into inquiry\nimproves reflexivity, because the marginalized are more likely to\nnotice and contest features of accepted representations that reflect\nthe perspectives of the dominant. Harding\u2019s ideal of\n\u201cstrong objectivity\u201d includes both reflexivity and\ndemocratic inclusion as key features of more objective processes of\ninquiry.\n\nDemocratic discussion. Longino (1990, 2001) advances a\nconception of objectivity based on democratic discussion. Knowledge\nproduction is a social enterprise, secured through the critical and\ncooperative interactions of inquirers. The products of this social\nenterprise are more objective, the more responsive they are to\ncriticism from all points of view. Feminists build on a tradition\nincluding Mill, Popper, and Feyerabend (Lloyd 1997a) by offering (i) a\nmore articulate conception of \u201call points of view,\u201d\nstressing the influence of the social positions of inquirers on their\ntheorizing; and (ii) a greater stress on the importance of equality\namong inquirers. In Longino\u2019s account, a community of inquirers\nis objective if it: (1) offers public venues for the criticism of\nknowledge claims; (2) responds to criticisms by changing its theories\naccording to (3) publicly recognized standards of evaluation; and (4)\nfollows a norm of equality of intellectual authority among its\nmembers. The norm of equality has been refined to distinguish\nlegitimate differences of expertise from illegitimate exercises of\nsocial power (Longino 2001).\n\nPluralist Themes in Feminist Conceptions of\nObjectivity. Most feminist conceptions of objectivity\naccommodate both methodological and theoretical pluralism. Different\ncommunities of inquiry take an interest in different aspects of the\nworld, and develop partial theories to satisfy varied epistemic and\npragmatic values. Most feminists resist the thought that these varied\ntheories must eventually be unified into a single grand theory. As\nlong as different communities of inquiry are producing empirical\nsuccesses in accordance with publicly recognized standards, while\nholding themselves accountable to criticism from all sides, their\nproducts may each count as objective, however irreducibly plural the\ncontent of their theories may be (Longino 2001, Harding 1991, 1998).\nHowever, Intemann (2010) questions the value of unlimited pluralism.\nIf sexist and racist values have been found to be unjustified after\nsustained inquiry, then scientific theories informed by these values\nneed not be taken seriously.\n",
