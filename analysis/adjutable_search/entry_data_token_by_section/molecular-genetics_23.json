    "main_text": "Why is so much biological research centered on genes and DNA?\n7.  Conclusion\n\n\nThe philosophy of molecular genetics is a lively area of research that\nreflects much of the excitement and diversity in contemporary\nphilosophy of science. Philosophers examining the related areas of\ngenetics have different philosophical interests and adopt contrasting\napproaches. Some philosophical research is aimed at setting science\nstraight while other research is aimed at correcting our understanding\nof science. Some philosophers employ traditional methods of philosophy\nof science, for example the analyses of concepts and models, while\nothers are pioneering new philosophical approaches by drawing upon\nmethods from social science including survey studies. While some\nphilosophers focus their attention on fundamental theorizing, others\nare investigating the dynamics of empirical investigation. Research in\nthe philosophy of molecular genetics is also generating new ideas\nabout basic concepts of general philosophical interest including\nreductionism, information, and causation.\n",
