It is often presented\nas intermediate between resourcist and welfarist approaches, but it is\nperhaps accurate to present it as more general. A\n\u201cfunctioning\u201d is any doing or being in the life of an\nindividual. A \u201ccapability set\u201d is the set of functioning\nvectors that an individual has access to. This approach has attracted\na lot of interest in particular because it makes it possible to take\ninto account all the relevant dimensions of life, in contrast with the\nresourcist and welfarist approaches which can be criticized as too\nnarrow.\n\nBeing so general, the approach needs to be specified in order to\ninspire original applications. The body of empirical literature that\ntakes inspiration from the capability approach is now numerically\nimpressive. As noted in Robeyns (2006) and Schokkaert (2007b), in many\ncases the empirical studies are essentially similar, except for\nterminology, to the sociological studies of living conditions. But\nthere are more original applications, e.g., when an evaluation of\ndevelopment programs that takes account of capabilities is contrasted\nwith cost-benefit analysis (Alkire 2002) or when a list of basic\ncapabilities is enshrined in a theory of what a just society should\nprovide to all citizens (Nussbaum 2000). More generally, all studies\nwhich seek to incorporate multiple dimensions of quality of life into\nthe evaluation of individual and social situations can be considered,\nbroadly speaking, as pertaining to this approach.\n\nTwo central questions pervade the empirical applications. The first\nconcerns the distinction between capabilities and functionings. The\nlatter are easier to observe because individual achievements are more\naccessible to the statistician than pure potentialities. There is also\nthe normative issue of whether the evaluation of individual situations\nshould be based on capabilities only, viewed as opportunity sets, or\nshould take account of achieved functionings as well. The second\ncentral question is the index problem, which has also been raised\nabout Rawls\u2019 theory of primary goods. There are many dimensions\nof functionings and capabilities and not all of them are equally\nvaluable. The definition of a proper system of weights has appeared\nproblematic in connection to the difficulties of social choice\ntheory.\n\nRecent surveys on this approach and its applications can be found in\nAlkire (2016), Basu and Lopez-Calva (2011), Kuklys (2005), Robeyns\n(2006), Robeyns and Van der Veen (2007), Schokkaert (2009).\n",
