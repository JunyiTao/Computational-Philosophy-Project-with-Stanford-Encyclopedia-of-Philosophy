    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Memory: An Overview\n1. The Metaphysics of Memory: An Overview\n\nMore than any other area, the metaphysics of memory reflects the trend\ntowards interdisciplinarity noted above, and work in this area\nsometimes shades into philosophy of psychology (Rowlands 2009) and\nphilosophy of neuroscience (Bickle 2011). Relevant work in the\nphilosophy of psychology is discussed here as appropriate; for more\nspecialized work in the philosophy of neuroscience, see\nthe entry on that topic. The central\naim of mainstream research on the metaphysics of memory is to develop\na theory of remembering: a general but informative account of\nwhat it is for someone to remember something. As we will see, however,\nthere are multiple kinds of memory. It is unclear whether it is feasible to\ndevelop a theory of remembering that applies to all of these, and\nultimately it may prove necessary to develop multiple theories of\nremembering, corresponding to the multiple kinds of memory. (Something\nsimilar may go for the epistemology of memory [Teroni 2014].)\n\nThe particular kind of memory on which most recent work has focused\nhas gone by a number of names, but, adopting Tulving\u2019s\n(1972, 1985a) psychological terminology, philosophers increasingly refer to\nit as \u201cepisodic\u201d (e.g., Hoerl\n2007; Dokic 2014; Hopkins 2014; Perrin & Rousset 2014;\nSoteriou 2008). The terminology may be new, but the focus is not (Brewer 1996).\nEpisodic memory is, roughly, memory for the events of the personal past, and,\nstarting at least with Aristotle (Sorabji 2006) and continuing with early modern\nphilosophers including Locke (1998), Hume ([1739] 2011), and Reid ([1785] 2002),\nphilosophers have singled episodic memory out for special attention on the ground\nthat it provides the rememberer with a unique form of access to past events.\nFor some, indeed, only episodic memory truly merits the name\n\u201cmemory\u201d (Klein 2015; B.\nRussell 1921). Reflecting this focus, this entry will be concerned\nprimarily with theories of episodic remembering: accounts of\nwhat it is for someone to remember an event from his personal\npast.\n\nDue, perhaps, to their focus on episodic memory, philosophers have\ngenerally approached memory as a capacity exercised by single\nindividuals. But recent work in a variety of disciplines has begun to\nchallenge the individualistic approach, and the metaphysics of memory\nhas come to include issues arising from the tradition of research on\ncollective memory in the human and social sciences which traces back\nto Halbwachs ([1925] 1994; cf. Barash 2016; Michaelian\n& Sutton forthcoming) and which has recently given\nbirth to the multidisciplinary field of memory studies (Roediger\n& Wertsch 2008; Segesten &\nW\u00fcstenberg forthcoming). It has also come to\ninclude issues arising from the more recent tradition of research on\nexternal memory in cognitive science which views remembering through\nthe lens of distributed (Hutchins 1995) or extended (Clark\n& Chalmers 1998) theories of cognition.\nWhile the entry is concerned primarily with individual memory, these\nmore recent issues will be discussed as well.\n",
