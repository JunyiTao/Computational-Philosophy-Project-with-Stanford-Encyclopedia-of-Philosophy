    "main_text": "Information as Code\n3. Information as Code\n\nFor information to be computed, it must be handled by the\ncomputational mechanism in question, and for such a handling to take\nplace, the information must be encoded. Information as\ncode is a stance that takes this encoding-condition very\nseriously. The result is the development of fine-grained models of\ninformation flow that turn on the syntactic properties of the encoding\nitself.\n\nTo see how this is so, consider again cases involving information flow\nvia observations. Such observations are informative because we are not\nomniscient in the normal, God-like sense of the term. We have to go\nand observe that the cat is on the mat, for example, precisely because\nwe are not automatically aware of every fact in the universe.\nInferences work in an analogous manner. Deductions are informative for\nus precisely because we are not logically omniscient. We have\nto reason about matters, sometimes at great length, because we are not\nautomatically aware of the logical consequences of the body of\ninformation with which we are reasoning.\n\nTo come full circle\u2014reasoning explicitly with information\nrequires handling it, where in this case such handling is cognitive\nact. Hence the information in question is encoded in some manner,\nhence Information as code underpins the development of fine-grained\nmodels of information flow that turn on the syntactic properties of\nthe encoding itself, as well as the properties of the actions that\nunderpin the various information-processing contexts involved.\n\nSuch information-processing contexts are not restricted to explicit\nacts of inferential reasoning by human agents, but include\nautomated reasoning and theorem proving, as well as\nmachine-based computational procedures in general. Approaches to\nmodelling the properties of these latter information-processing\nscenarios fall under algorithmic information theory.\n\nIn\n section 3.1,\n we will explore a major approach to modelling the properties of\ninformation-processing within the information as code framework via\ncategorial information theory. In\n section 3.2,\n we will examine the more general approach to modelling information as\ncode of which categorial information theory is an instance, the\nmodelling of information as code via substructural logics. In\n section 3.3\n we will lay out the details of several other notable examples of\nlogics of information flow motivated by the information as code\napproach.\n",
