    "main_text": "\n\nMetaethical constructivism is the view that insofar as there are\nnormative truths, they are not fixed by normative facts that are\nindependent of what rational agents would agree to under some\nspecified conditions of choice. The appeal of this view lies in the\npromise to explain how normative truths are objective and independent\nof our actual judgments, while also binding and authoritative for\nus.\n\nConstructivism comes in several varieties, some of which claim a place\nwithin metaethics while others claim no place within it at all. In\nfact, constructivism is sometimes defended as a normative\ntheory about the justification of moral principles. Normative\nconstructivism is the view that the moral principles we ought to\naccept are the ones that agents would agree to or endorse were they to\nengage in a hypothetical or idealized process of rational\ndeliberation.\n\nMetaethical constructivist theories aim to account for the nature of\nnormative truths and practical reasons. They bear a problematic\nrelation to traditional classifications of metaethical theories. In\nparticular, there are disagreements about how to situate\nconstructivism in the realism/antirealism debate. These disagreements\nare rooted in further differences about the definition of metaethics,\nthe relation between normative and metaethical claims, and the\npurported methods pertinent and specific to metaethical inquiry. The\nquestion of how to classify metaethical constructivism will be\naddressed in what follows by focusing on the distinctive questions\nthat constructivist theories have been designed to answer. Section 1\nexplains the origin and motivation of constructivism. Sections\n2\u20134 examine the main varieties of metaethical constructivism.\nSection 5 illustrates related constructivist views, some of which are\nnot proposed as metaethical accounts of all normative truths, but only\nof moral truths. Sections 6 and 7 review several debates about the\nproblems, promise and prospects of metaethical constructivism.\n",
