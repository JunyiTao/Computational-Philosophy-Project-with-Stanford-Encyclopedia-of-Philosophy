    "main_text": "Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy || Role of Sanskrit Language\n1.3 Role of Sanskrit Language\nReflection on language in Indian philosophy, for the Brahminical, Veda-accepting traditions at least, begins and ends with the Sanskrit language, in what has been termed \u201cthe Sanskrit cosmopolis\u201d (Pollock 2006). It is not merely that Sanskrit is the vehicle for reflection on language, but the Sanskrit language itself is a target of inquiry. Pata\u00f1jali explains the reasons for this in his Great Commentary (Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya), a commentary on K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s 3rd century BCE commentary on P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s Eight Chapters. These reasons are largely centered on the preservation and correct performance of Vedic rituals. Along with these pragmatic aims, there comes the belief in a special metaphysical and epistemic status for Sanskrit\u2014it has natural (autpattika, intrinsic) connections to its referents, which other languages lack; thus, at least in the context of the Vedas, it can give us infallible knowledge about the world, without the corruption of fallible human intermediaries. This conception is not shared by all orthoprax thinkers, however, as Ny\u0101ya philosophers argue for the conventionality of language (NS 2.1.55).\nTraditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of Sanskrit, largely preferring to write in P\u0101li and Prakrit. At a certain point, however, and for unknown reasons, Buddhist thinkers such as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna begin to write in Sanskrit (Kelly 1996). Regardless of which language they employ, Buddhists reject the notion of an inherent connection between the Sanskrit language and reality\u2014indeed, they argue that no language has such a connection\u2014arguing as early on as the famous The Questions of King Milinda (Milindapa\u00f1h\u0101) that language is conventional. Still, the fact that Naiy\u0101yikas and Buddhists agree on the conventional nature of language shows that the religious prominence of Sanskrit does not necessarily entail specific philosophical commitments about its referential capacities. However, those who take on the assumption of an innate connection between Sanskrit word and referent then had explanatory burdens, such as how to explain linguistic innovation within Sanskrit and the referential capacities of non-Sanskrit languages.\n",
