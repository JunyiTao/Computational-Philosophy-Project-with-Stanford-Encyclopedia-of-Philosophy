    "main_text": "Type Causation || Net and Component Effects\n2.2 Net and Component Effects\n\nConsider the following case, adopted from Hesslow (1976): suppose that\nbirth control pills (B) prevent pregnancy (P).\nHowever, they can also have the unintended side-effect of thrombosis\n(T). So we might be inclined to accept the type causal claim\n\u201cbirth control pills cause thrombosis\u201d. But wait:\nanother potential cause of thrombosis is pregnancy. And birth\ncontrol pills inhibit pregnancy. The general structure of the case is\nas shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Hesslow\u2019s birth control\ncase [An\n extended description of figure 11\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBirth control pills directly promote thrombosis, but at the\nsame time, they prevent pregnancy, which itself promotes thrombosis.\nBy adjusting the probabilities, we can make it so that, overall,\ntaking birth control makes no difference to the probability of\nthrombosis. Then, we might be inclined to accept the type causal claim\n\u201cbirth control pills have no effect on\nthrombosis\u201d\u2014after all, your chances of getting thrombosis\nare exactly the same, whether or not you take birth control. Hitchcock\n(2001b) argues that cases like this require us to distinguish two\ndifferent kinds of effects which type causes can have: what he calls a\nnet effect, on the one hand, and what he calls component\neffect, on the other. In Hesslow\u2019s case, birth control\npills have no net effect on thrombosis. This is the sense in\nwhich it\u2019s true to say \u201cbirth control pills have no effect\non thrombosis\u201d. At the same time, birth control pills have a\ncomponent\u2014or path-specific\u2014effect on\nthrombosis. Along the path B \u2192 T, birth control\npromotes thrombosis. This is the sense in which it\u2019s true to say\n\u201cbirth control pills cause thrombosis\u201d. For further\ndiscussion, see Woodward (2003: \u00a72.3) and Weinberger (2019).\n",
