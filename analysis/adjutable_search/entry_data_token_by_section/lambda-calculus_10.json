    "main_text": "\\(\\lambda\\)-theories\n5. \\(\\lambda\\)-theories\n\nWe discussed earlier how the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus is a non-extensional\ntheory of functions. If, in the non-extensional spirit, we understand\n\\(\\lambda\\)-terms as descriptions, how should we treat equality of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-terms? Various approaches are available. In this section,\nlet us treat the equality relation = as a primitive, undefined\nrelation holding between two \\(\\lambda\\)-terms, and try to\naxiomatize the properties that equality should have. The task\nis to identity axioms and formulate suitable rules of\ninference concerning the equality of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-terms.\n\nSome obvious properties of equality, having nothing to do with\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, are as follows: \n\\[\\tag{Reflexivity}\n\\frac{}{X=X}\n\\]\n \n\\[\\tag{Symmetry}\n\\frac{X=Y}{Y=X}\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{Transitivity}\n\\frac{X=Y \\quad Y=Z}{X=Z}\n\\]\n\n\nAs is standard in proof theory, the way to read these rules of\ninference is that above the horizontal rule \\(\\frac{}{\\phantom{X=X}}\\)\nare the premises of the rule (which are\nequations) and the equation below the horizontal rule is the\nconclusion of the rule of inference. In the\ncase of the reflexivity rule, nothing is written above the horizontal\nrule. We understand such a case as saying that, for all terms \\(X\\),\nwe may infer the equation \\(X = X\\) from no premises.\n",
