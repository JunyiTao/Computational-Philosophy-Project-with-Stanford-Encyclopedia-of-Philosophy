    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nDeleuze was born in Paris to conservative, middle-class parents, who\nsent him to public schools for his elementary education; except for\none year of school in Normandy during the Occupation, he lived in the\nsame section of Paris his entire life. His personal life was\nunremarkable; he remained married to the same woman he wed at age 31,\nFanny (Denise Paul) Grandjouan, a French translator of D. H. Lawrence,\nand raised two children with her. He rarely traveled abroad, although\nhe did take a trip to the United States in 1975; for the most part he\nminimized his attendance at academic conferences and colloquia,\ninsisting that the activity of thought took place primarily in\nwriting, and not in dialogue and discussion. The most dramatic event\nin his life occurred early, when, during the Occupation,\nDeleuze\u2019s older brother was arrested by the Nazis for resistance\nactivities and deported; he died on the train to Auschwitz.\n\nWhen the Germans began their occupation of France in June 1940,\nDeleuze\u2019s family was on vacation in Normandy, and he spent a\nyear being schooled there. Deleuze traced his initiation into\nliterature and philosophy to his encounter with a teacher at Deauville\nnamed Pierre Halbwachs (son of the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs), who\nintroduced him to writers such as Gide and Baudelaire. Early on, he\nrecalled, philosophical concepts struck him with the same force as\nliterary characters, having their own autonomy and style. After the\nLiberation, Deleuze returned to Paris and undertook his\nkh\u00e2gne (an intensive year of preparatory studies) at\nthe well-known Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, and then studied the history of\nphilosophy at the Sorbonne. He was taught by Jean Hippolyte and\nFerdinand Alqui\u00e9, whom he \u201cloved and admired\nenormously,\u201d as well as by Georges Canguilhem and Maurice de\nGandillac. Like many of his peers he was as influenced by the writings\nof Jean-Paul Sartre as he was by the work of his academic mentors.\n\nDeleuze\u2019s historically oriented study at the Sorbonne led him to\ndevote his first book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953), to\nHume. In an era in which peers like Foucault and Derrida, students at\nthe \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, concentrated on \u201cthe\nthree \u2018H\u2019s\u201d (Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger),\nDeleuze\u2019s decision to write on empiricism and Hume was already a\nprovocation, early evidence of the heterodox tendencies of his\nthought. From 1953 to 1962\u2014which he later referred to as\n\u201ca hole in my life\u201d\u2014Deleuze published little, moving\namong various teaching positions in Paris and the provinces. It was\nalso during this time that he contracted the recurring respiratory\nailment that would plague him for the rest of his life. In 1962,\nNietzsche and Philosophy was published to considerable\nacclaim, cementing Deleuze\u2019s reputation in academic circles. He\nfollowed this initial success with Kant\u2019s Critical\nPhilosophy (1963); Proust and Signs (1964); and\nBergsonism (1966). In 1968 he published Difference and\nRepetition as his primary thesis for the doctorat\nd\u2019\u00c9tat, with Spinoza and the Problem of\nExpression as the secondary thesis.\n\nThe next year, 1969, proved to be an important one for Deleuze. First,\nhe found a permanent teaching position in Paris, at the experimental\ncampus of the University of Paris VIII in Vincennes (which later moved\nto its current location in St. Denis); he gave weekly seminars at this\ninstitution until his retirement in 1987. Second, he published another\nmajor text in his own name, Logic of Sense. But most\nimportantly, it was then that he met F\u00e9lix Guattari, a radical\npsychoanalyst and political militant, with whom he began a long\ncollaboration. Their first joint volume, Anti-Oedipus (1972),\nwas a best seller in France, a veritable succ\u00e8s de\nscandale, and thrust Deleuze into the limelight as a public\nintellectual. They followed this with Kafka: Toward a Minor\nLiterature (1975), and then a book which, at least in the eyes of\nsome, rivals Difference and Repetition for the title of\nDeleuze\u2019s masterwork, A Thousand Plateaus (1980).\n\nThe 1980s were a decade of independent works for Deleuze: Francis\nBacon: Logic of Sensation (1981); Cinema I: The\nMovement-Image (1983); Cinema II: The Time-Image (1985);\nFoucault (1986); and The Fold: Leibniz and the\nBaroque (1988). He then resumed his collaboration with Guattari\nfor their final joint work, What is Philosophy? (1991). His\nfinal years were spent in very ill health, although he did manage to\npublish a remarkable short essay, \u201cImmanence: A Life\u201d in\n1995, before taking his own life on November 4, 1995.\n",
