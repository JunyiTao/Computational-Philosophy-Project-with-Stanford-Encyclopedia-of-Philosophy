Stuff and Things and the Limits of Linguistically-Guided Metaphysics\n\nThe foregoing entry represents a detailed case-study of metaphysical\nviews which are heavily guided by syntactical, lexical, and semantic\nconsiderations, but freed from some of the methodological constraints\nand more narrow objectives of linguists and semanticists. Often in the\npreceding we have seen how the\n+MASS/+COUNT distinction was used to\nmotivate a parallel \u2018metaphysically serious\u2019 stuff/thing\ndistinction. The question to be briefly addressed here, after looking\nback on sixty years of work on the topic, is: to what extent is\nthe +MASS/+COUNT distinction up to\nthe tasks assigned to it by metaphysicians?\n\nSuch tasks often serve two main functions: constructive, and\nprohibitive. The constructive aspect is the idea that we can (and\nshould) \u2018read off\u2019 the correct (or what we think is the\ncorrect) ontology from our language use. The prohibitive aspect is the\nidea that if syntax, semantics, or lexical meaning prohibits (or\nrenders incoherent, or non-well-formed) certain constructions, then we\ncan not (or should not) be ontologically committed to what the\nimpermissible renderings would commit us to. Often the constructive\nand prohibitive work hand-in-hand, such as we have seen by noting how\nthe fact that \u2018wine\u2019 cannot be prefaced with numerals\n(without referring to kinds) has lead many to think that wine cannot\nbe a thing (prohibitive), and that, since wine exists, and can be\nmeasured, that it must be instead stuff (constructive).\n\nBut can the +MASS/+COUNT distinction do\nthis much metaphysical work in a reliable way?\n",
