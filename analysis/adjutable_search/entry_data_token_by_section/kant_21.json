    "main_text": "The unity of nature and freedom || The great chasm\n7.2 The purposiveness of nature\n\nIn the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant discusses four\nmain ways in which reflecting judgment leads us to regard nature as\npurposive: first, it leads us to regard nature as governed by a system\nof empirical laws; second, it enables us to make aesthetic judgments;\nthird, it leads us to think of organisms as objectively purposive;\nand, fourth, it ultimately leads us to think about the final end of\nnature as a\n whole.[28]\n\nFirst, reflecting judgment enables us to discover empirical laws of\nnature by leading us to regard nature as if it were the product of\nintelligent design (5:179\u2013186). We do not need reflecting\njudgment to grasp the a priori laws of nature based on our categories,\nsuch as that every event has a cause. But in addition to these a\npriori laws nature is also governed by particular, empirical laws,\nsuch as that fire causes smoke, which we cannot know without\nconsulting experience. To discover these laws, we must form hypotheses\nand devise experiments on the assumption that nature is governed by\nempirical laws that we can grasp (Bxiii\u2013xiv). Reflecting\njudgment makes this assumption through its principle to regard nature\nas purposive for our understanding, which leads us to treat nature as\nif its empirical laws were designed to be understood by us\n(5:180\u2013181). Since this principle only regulates our cognition\nbut is not constitutive of nature itself, this does not amount to\nassuming that nature really is the product of intelligent design,\nwhich according to Kant we are not justified in believing on\ntheoretical grounds. Rather, it amounts only to approaching nature in\nthe practice of science as if it were designed to be understood by us.\nWe are justified in doing this because it enables us to discover\nempirical laws of nature. But it is only a regulative principle of\nreflecting judgment, not genuine theoretical knowledge, that nature is\npurposive in this way.\n\nSecond, Kant thinks that aesthetic judgments about both beauty and\nsublimity involve a kind of purposiveness, and that the beauty of\nnature in particular suggests to us that nature is hospitable to our\nends. According to his aesthetic theory, we judge objects to be\nbeautiful not because they gratify our desires, since aesthetic\njudgments are disinterested, but rather because apprehending their\nform stimulates what he calls the harmonious \u201cfree play\u201d\nof our understanding and imagination, in which we take a distinctively\naesthetic pleasure (5:204\u2013207, 217\u2013218, 287). So beauty is\nnot a property of objects, but a relation between their form and the\nway our cognitive faculties work. Yet we make aesthetic judgments that\nclaim intersubjective validity because we assume that there is a\ncommon sense that enables all human beings to communicate aesthetic\nfeeling (5:237\u2013240, 293\u2013296). Beautiful art is\nintentionally created to stimulate this universally communicable\naesthetic pleasure, although it is effective only when it seems\nunintentional (5:305\u2013307). Natural beauty, however, is\nunintentional: landscapes do not know how to stimulate the free play\nof our cognitive faculties, and they do not have the goal of giving us\naesthetic pleasure. In both cases, then, beautiful objects appear\npurposive to us because they give us aesthetic pleasure in the free\nplay of our faculties, but they also do not appear purposive because\nthey either do not or do not seem to do this intentionally. Kant calls\nthis relation between our cognitive faculties and the formal qualities\nof objects that we judge to be beautiful \u201csubjective\npurposiveness\u201d (5:221). Although it is only subjective, the\npurposiveness exhibited by natural beauty in particular may be\ninterpreted as a sign that nature is hospitable to our moral interests\n(5:300). Moreover, Kant also interprets the experience of sublimity in\nnature as involving purposiveness. But in this case it is not so much\nthe purposiveness of nature as our own purpose or\n\u201cvocation\u201d as moral beings that we become aware of in the\nexperience of the sublime, in which the size and power of nature stand\nin vivid contrast to the superior power of our reason\n(5:257\u2013260, 267\u2013269).\n\nThird, Kant argues that reflecting judgment enables us to regard\nliving organisms as objectively purposive, but only as a regulative\nprinciple that compensates for our inability to fully understand them\nmechanistically, which reflects the limitations of our cognitive\nfaculties rather than any intrinsic teleology in nature. We cannot\nfully understand organisms mechanistically because they are\n\u201cself-organizing\u201d beings, whose parts are \u201ccombined\ninto a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect of their\nform\u201d (5:373\u2013374). The parts of a watch are also possible\nonly through their relation to the whole, but that is because the\nwatch is designed and produced by some rational being. An organism, by\ncontrast, produces and sustains itself, which is inexplicable to us\nunless we attribute to organisms purposes by analogy with human art\n(5:374\u2013376). But Kant claims that it is only a regulative\nprinciple of reflecting judgment to regard organisms in this way, and\nthat we are not justified in attributing objective purposiveness to\norganisms themselves, since it is only \u201cbecause of the peculiar\nconstitution of my cognitive faculties [that] I cannot judge about the\npossibility of those things and their generation except by thinking of\na cause for these acts in accordance with intentions\u201d\n(5:397\u2013398). Specifically, we cannot understand how a whole can\nbe the cause of its own parts because we depend on sensible intuition\nfor the content of our thoughts and therefore must think the\nparticular (intuition) first by subsuming it under the general (a\nconcept). To see that this is just a limitation of the human,\ndiscursive intellect, imagine a being with an intuitive understanding\nwhose thought does not depend, as ours does, on receiving sensory\ninformation passively, but rather creates the content of its thought\nin the act of thinking it. Such a (divine) being could understand how\na whole can be the cause of its parts, since it could grasp a whole\nimmediately without first thinking particulars and then combining them\ninto a whole (5:401\u2013410). Therefore, since we have a discursive\nintellect and cannot know how things would appear to a being with an\nintuitive intellect, and yet we can only think of organisms\nteleologically, which excludes mechanism, Kant now says that we must\nthink of both mechanism and teleology only as regulative principles\nthat we need to explain nature, rather than as constitutive principles\nthat describe how nature is intrinsically constituted (5:410ff.).\n\nFourth, Kant concludes the Critique of the Power of Judgment\nwith a long appendix arguing that reflecting judgment supports\nmorality by leading us to think about the final end of nature, which\nwe can only understand in moral terms, and that conversely morality\nreinforces a teleological conception of nature. Once it is granted on\ntheoretical grounds that we must understand certain parts of nature\n(organisms) teleologically, although only as a regulative principle of\nreflecting judgment, Kant says we may go further and regard the whole\nof nature as a teleological system (5:380\u2013381). But we can\nregard the whole of nature as a teleological system only by employing\nthe idea of God, again only regulatively, as its intelligent designer.\nThis involves attributing what Kant calls external purposiveness to\nnature \u2013 that is, attributing purposes to God in creating nature\n(5:425). What, then, is God\u2019s final end in creating nature?\nAccording to Kant, the final end of nature must be human beings, but\nonly as moral beings (5:435, 444\u2013445). This is because only\nhuman beings use reason to set and pursue ends, using the rest of\nnature as means to their ends (5:426\u2013427). Moreover, Kant claims\nthat human happiness cannot be the final end of nature, because as we\nhave seen he holds that happiness is not unconditionally valuable\n(5:430\u2013431). Rather, human life has value not because of what we\npassively enjoy, but only because of what we actively do (5:434). We\ncan be fully active and autonomous, however, only by acting morally,\nwhich implies that God created the world so that human beings could\nexercise moral autonomy. Since we also need happiness, this too may be\nadmitted as a conditioned and consequent end, so that reflecting\njudgment eventually leads us to the highest good (5:436). But\nreflection on conditions of the possibility of the highest good leads\nagain to Kant\u2019s moral argument for belief in God\u2019s\nexistence, which in turn reinforces the teleological perspective on\nnature with which reflecting judgment began.\n\nThus Kant argues that although theoretical and practical philosophy\nproceed from separate and irreducible starting points \u2013\nself-consciousness as the highest principle for our cognition of\nnature, and the moral law as the basis for our knowledge of freedom\n\u2013 reflecting judgment unifies them into a single, teleological\nworldview that assigns preeminent value to human autonomy.\n",
