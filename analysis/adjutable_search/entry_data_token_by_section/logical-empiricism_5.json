Indeed it is hard to\nindicate any conditions under which any parts of them would be\ndisconfirmed. Leibniz had called them truths of reason. Hume said that\nthey represented relations of ideas. Kant had held that the truths in\nthese areas were a priori. Mathematics and geometry were not analytic\nfor Kant, but logic was. Kant had two criteria of analyticity,\napparently thinking them equivalent. First, in subject-predicate\nsentences, an analytic sentence is one in which the concept of the\npredicate is contained in that of the subject. Second, an analytic\nsentence is one whose denial is self-contradictory. This seems to\ninclude not only the sentences whose surface logical form would be of\nthe required sort but also those that can be got from such logical\ntruths by making substitutions that were conceptually equivalent. The\nmore modern rough analog of this is to say that the analytic sentences\nare those that are true in virtue of logic and definition.\n\nFrege certainly developed logic beyond that which was available to\nKant, but he did not think of himself as changing the analytic status\nof it. Logic is after all the only avenue we have for giving meaning\nto the notion of (logical) contradiction. Of course Frege also\nattempted to reduce mathematics to logic (including both first and\nsecond order logic), and insofar as that reduction was successful it\nwould have implied that mathematics was analytic as well. Frege said\nlittle of geometry, but for him it was synthetic a priori.\n\nCarnap had not only studied with Frege, but like many of the logical\nempiricists he had started out as a neo-Kantian as well. So especially\nin view of Russell\u2019s relatively more successful attempt at\nreducing mathematics to logic, it was perhaps natural that Carnap\nwould consider both mathematics and logic as analytic. Geometry could\nbe handled in several different ways that we will not discuss here.\nBut from fairly early on there was widespread agreement among the\nlogical empiricists that there was no synthetic a priori, and that\nlogic and mathematics and perhaps much else that seemed impervious to\nempirical disconfirmation should be thought of as analytic. The point\nof drawing the analytic-synthetic distinction, then, is not to divide\nthe body of scientific truths or to divide philosophy from science,\nbut to show how to integrate them into a natural scientific whole.\nAlong the way the distinction clarifies which inferences are to be\ntaken as legitimate and which are not. If, as Carnap and Neurath were,\nyou are impressed by Duhemian arguments to the effect that generally\nclaims must be combined in order to test them, the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction allows you to clarify which combinations of claims are\ntestable.\n\nIf analytic, a sentence is true in virtue of the conventions of\nlanguage. In saying that, however, we must pause to confront two\nwidespread confusions. First, Quine alleges (1963, 385f) that the\nnotion of analyticity was developed and purports to explain for both\nKant and Carnap how certainty is possible. In fact certainty has\nlittle or nothing to do with analyticity for the leading logical\nempiricists. In saying that such claims are based on convention they\nwere explicitly calling attention to the revisability of conventions\nand the sentences that owed their meanings to those conventions.\nSecond, nowadays any talk of convention is likely to prompt the\nresponse: \u201cBut that cannot be! No proposition can be made true\nby our conventions or decisions.\u201d Unless it is a proposition\nabout conventions, this second sentence of the response is true. But\nit is also completely irrelevant. Analyticity applies to\nsentences rather than propositions. Our conventions and\ndecisions can and do affect what expressions mean and thus what\nsentences mean. Once the meaning is specified, it may well be that any\nsentence that has this meaning would be true even if, for example, the\npoint masses of the universe were arranged quite otherwise than they\nin fact are. These are the analytic sentences. No claim is being made\nthat meaning causes anything or that convention makes\nanything true. The \u201cmaking\u201d image here is out of place. It\nis just that in these cases the truth value of the sentence may well\nbe functionally dependent on meaning alone. If it is, then in this\nspecial sense, truth value depends on meaning, and that depends on\nconvention. Other sentences whose meanings are specified might well be\ntrue or false depending on how things in the external world, so to\nspeak, are arranged. In this other category of sentence the truth\nvalue is not functionally dependent on meaning alone. They are the\nsynthetic sentences. Now this puts matters extremely informally. But\nat least the nature of the confusions over certainty and convention\nshould be clear.\n\nIn the Logical Syntax of Language (1934/1937) Carnap defined\n\u2018analytic\u2019 in a new way in order to circumvent\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results. The method used was to\ndistinguish between a derivation relation (the relation that holds\nbetween some premises and what can be got from them in a finite number\nof steps) and a consequence relation. The latter is an essentially\nsemantic relation that holds between some premises and some other\nclaim such that on all valuations under which the premises are all\ntrue, so is that other claim. This definition bears a stronger\nresemblance to Tarski\u2019s account in (Tarski 1936b/1956). In any\ncase, Carnap is able to show that for any sentence of pure mathematics\neither it or its negation is a consequence of the null set of\npremises. This leaves G\u00f6del\u2019s results completely intact as\nthey concerned what is provable, that is, derivable from the null set\nof premises or from any one consistent axiomatization of mathematical\ntruths.\n\nAs noted above, another innovation of Logical Syntax is the\nPrinciple of Tolerance. While it reflects a long-standing attitude on\nCarnap\u2019s part, the principle itself is new. Later Carnap was to\nsay that the Principle of Tolerance was \u201cperhaps better called\nthe principle of conventionality\u201d (Carnap 1942, 247), that is,\nthe conventionality of linguistic forms. Tolerance stabilizes the\nverification principle as well as Carnap\u2019s empiricism, and it\nreinforces the idea that the analytic-synthetic distinction is always\nrelative to a particular language (Creath 2009).\n\nIn the late 1950s Carnap began exploring (1963a and 1966) how a notion\nof analyticity might be developed for novel theoretical terms where\nthe theories in which those terms are embedded are presented by means\nof a system of postulates. It is not clear that the account he\ndeveloped was intended to supersede his earlier account. In any case\nCarnap\u2019s suggestion is as follows (where for convenience terms\nare used autonomously): Let T be the totality of theoretical\npostulates, and C be the totality of mixed sentences (the\nsentences of the theory containing both antecedent and novel terms).\nAlso let R(TC) be the Ramsey sentence for\nTC, that is, the result of replacing each of the\nnon-observational terms in TC with predicate variables and\nclosing that open sentence with corresponding existential quantifiers.\nR(TC) \u2283 TC can, Carnap says, be thought\nof as the analytic sentence for the theory, that is, a sentence that\ngives to the theoretical terms of TC their meaning. Over the\nlast decade, this idea of Carnap\u2019s has provoked considerable\ndiscussion that has not yet been resolved. Whatever worries there may\nbe concerning this part of Carnap\u2019s view, they are distinct from\nthe more famous concerns raised by Quine.\n\nQuine began having doubts about analyticity about 1940, though he\nseems not to have been firmly committed against it until later. In any\ncase his doubts were not published until 1951 in his famous paper\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d. Quine\u2019s readers have\nunderstood his arguments in many different ways. The most general form\nof his complaint is that \u2018analytic\u2019 so far lacks the\nappropriate tie to observational criteria that Carnap\u2019s own\naccount of theoretical terms in empirical science would demand. More\nspecifically, where there has been an attempt at such a general\ncriterion it has resulted in either a \u201cdrastic failure as tended\nto admit all or no sentences as analytic, or there has been a\ncircularity\u201d (Quine 1963, 404) of a kind that defines\n\u2018analytic\u2019 in terms that themselves lack the appropriate\nempirical criteria and so can be accounted for only by appeal to\nanalyticity itself.\n\nThis complaint falls far short, as Quine well understood, of a proof\nthat Carnap\u2019s appeal to analyticity was doomed. First, it relies\non the demand that theoretical terms must satisfy some empirical\nsignificance criterion. Many people at the time, including some who\nfollowed Quine in rejecting analyticity, also rejected any general\nempirical significance demand for theoretical terms. Second, one could\naccept the demand for theoretical terms in physics or chemistry and\ndeny, as Carnap did, that the demand applied to his own work. This is\nbecause Carnap saw himself as working in an area within\nmetamathematics rather than in empirical linguistics. Third, Quine did\nnot pretend to have considered all of the possibilities for the\nexplication of analyticity. And so it may be possible to meet\nQuine\u2019s demands to the extent that they are legitimate. Fourth\nand finally, Quine seems in Roots of Reference (1974) to have\nprovided an explication for \u2018analytic\u2019 that meets his\ndemand for empirical/behavioral criteria without inducing either the\ndrastic failure or the circularity envisioned above.\n\nThere is another somewhat independent thrust to Quine\u2019s campaign\nagainst analyticity. In the last section of \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d\n(1951) Quine gives an extremely attractive sketch for an alternative\nepistemology that apparently makes no appeal to analyticity. Insofar\nas that sketch can be filled out successfully it would constitute a\ndispensability argument against analyticity. Whether it can be thus\nfilled out, however, remains to be seen.\n\nQuine\u2019s other provocative theses, including especially his\nclaims about the indeterminacy of translation, while relevant to his\nassessment of analyticity, would carry us too far afield to consider\ntheir ramifications here. As with most topics in philosophy there is\nno uniform agreement in the literature as to whether the notion of\nanalyticity is or can be made sufficiently clear for use in scientific\nphilosophy. Nor is there such agreement that Quine\u2019s\nepistemological sketch can be satisfactorily filled out. Both\napproaches have their defenders and their detractors. But between them\nthey seem to be the most promising avenues for integrating the\nlogic-mathematical part of science with the more straightforwardly\nempirical parts. Since Carnap is and Quine can be argued to be within\nthe logical empiricist tradition, this progress toward such\nunification can be counted as part of the legacy of the movement.\n",
