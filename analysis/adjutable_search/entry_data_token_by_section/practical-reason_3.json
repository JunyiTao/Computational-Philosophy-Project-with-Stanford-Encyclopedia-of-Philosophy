Instrumental and Structural Rationality\n\n Among the substantive norms of practical reason, those of\ninstrumental rationality have seemed least controversial to\nphilosophers.  Instrumental rationality, in its most basic form,\ninstructs agents to take those means that are necessary in relation to\ntheir given ends.  In the modern era, this form of rationality has\nwidely been viewed as the single unproblematic requirement of\npractical reason. The instrumental principle makes no assumptions\nabout the prospects for rational scrutiny of peoples\u2019 ends.  Rational\ncriticism of this kind apparently presupposes that there are objective\nreasons and values, providing standards for assessment of ends that\nare independent from psychological facts about what people happen to\nbe motivated to pursue. In line with the naturalistic attitude\nsketched in section 2, however, it may be doubted whether such\nindependent standards can be reconciled with the metaphysical\ncommitments of contemporary scientific practice. A world that is shorn\nof objective values or norms leaves no room for rational criticism of\npeoples\u2019 ends, but only for Weberian Zweckrationalit\u00e4t:\nthe rational determination of means to the realization of ends that\nare taken to be given, as a matter of human psychological fact.\n\n This line of thought can be traced back to the philosophy of David\nHume, who famously asserted that \u2018Reason is, and ought only to\nbe the slave of the passions\u2019 (Hume 1978, 415). Those attracted\nto the Humean approach should bear in mind, however, that instrumental\nrationality is itself the expression of an objective normative\ncommitment. The instrumental principle says that we are rationally\nrequired to take the means that are necessary to achieve our ends;\nif the principle represents a binding norm of practical reason, then\nwe are open to rational criticism to the extent we fail to exhibit\nthis kind of instrumental consistency, regardless of whether we want\nto comply with the principle or not.  If naturalism really entails\nthat there can be no objective norms or values, it may be wondered how\nan exception can possibly be made for the instrumental requirement. A\nmore consistently naturalistic position would be to reject even\nZweckrationalit\u00e4t in favor of a skeptical attitude towards\npractical reason in all its forms (Hampton 1998)\u2014an attitude\nthat may well correspond to the intentions of the historical Hume\n(compare Dreier 1997, Millgram 1995).  Further questions can be raised\nabout the plausibility of the suggestion that the instrumental norm\nexhausts the requirements of practical reason. The norm says that one\nshould take the means that are necessary relative to one\u2019s\npsychologically-given ends. But how can the fact that a given means\nexhibits this kind of necessity give a person reason to choose the\nmeans, if the end is not itself something it would be valuable to\nachieve in some way? The instrumental principle seems to function as a\nbinding norm of practical reason only if it is taken for granted that\nthere are additional, independent standards for the assessment of our\nends (Korsgaard 1997; Quinn 1993).\n\n\nMany proponents of the instrumental principle would agree that it does\nnot generate reasons for action. The fact that a given means is\nnecessary, relative to one\u2019s given ends, is not a reason to take the\nmeans. The instrumental principle functions, rather, as a structural\nrequirement on one\u2019s attitudes (Broome 1999, Broome 2004). Thus,\nsuppose one intends end E, and believes (truly) that E can be achieved\nonly if one intends to do M. It appears that there are two ways in\nwhich one could revise one\u2019s attitudes in response to these\nconsiderations, compatibly with the instrumental principle: one could\nform the intention to M, or one could abandon one\u2019s original intention\nto E. The instrumental principle, considered in itself, is indifferent\nas between these two possibilities; it should be understood as a\nwide-scope requirement, governing combinations of attitudes, rather\nthan a source of detachable normative conclusions about what one has\nreason to do. (Modus ponens represents a similar rational requirement\nin the domain of theoretical reason, governing combinations of\nbeliefs.)\n\n\nRational requirements of this kind have recently become a subject of\nlively philosophical debate. The idea that there are structural\nrequirements on our attitudes appears to be common ground among\nphilosophers who differ significantly in their views about the nature\nand scope of practical reason. It is accepted by most Humeans, for\ninstance, who believe that there is no scope for the rational\ncriticism of individual ends, and also by Kantians, who think that the\nrequirements of reason ultimately constrain us to choose in accordance\nwith the moral law. From the perspective of practical and theoretical\ndeliberation, we commonly grant the force of these structural\nrequirements, acknowledging a kind of rational pressure to bring our\nbeliefs and intentions into compliance with the instrumental principle\nand other standards of consistency and coherence.\n\n\nMany philosophers take such structural requirements at face value,\ngranting that practical reason is rightly governed by and responsive\nto these wide-scope demands. Indeed, it has influentially been argued\nthat standards of good reasoning, in both the practical and the\ntheoretical domain, derive exclusively from structural requirements of\nrationality of this kind (Broome 2013). But questions arise about this\napproach. For one thing, reasoning has a kind of directionality that\nis hard to make sense of solely in terms of the ideal of compliance\nwith wide-scope requirements. Thus it isn\u2019t good reasoning to\ngive up the intention to achieve end E solely because one lacks the\nintention to take the necessary means M, even though, as we have seen,\nrevising one\u2019s attitudes in this way brings about compliance\nwith the wide-scope requirement.\n\n\nHow, more generally, should we understand the relation between\nstructural requirements and our reasons for action and\nbelief? One view, held in common by Humeans and by some Kantian\nconstructivists (see sec. 2 above), is that reasons are fundamentally\nderivative from rational requirements. What one has reason to do, on\nthis view, is what one would desire or intend to do if one was fully\nrational (i.e. fully in compliance with the wide-scope structural\nrequirements that govern one\u2019s attitudes in combination).\n\n\nFor those who do not share this reductionist view, however, the status\nof rational requirements becomes more puzzling. One might hold that\npractical reason is ultimately answerable to two different kinds of\nconstraints: to rational requirements on the one hand, and to\nindependent facts about what one has reason to do on the other\nhand. But this position is potentially unstable. Once the independence\nof structural requirements from normative reasons is made clear, it is\nno longer obvious why we should care about whether our attitudes do or\ndo not comply with the structural requirements. On this view, there is\nnothing wrong with failing to take the necessary means to your end,\nunless the end itself is one that you have compelling reason to pursue\n(Raz 2005). More generally, it has been argued that there are no\nindependent requirements of structural rationality at all, and that\nthe appearance of such requirements within the deliberative point of\nview can be explained by substantive features of the reasons to which\nboth practical and theoretical reason are ultimately and properly\nresponsive (Kolodny 2005).\n",
