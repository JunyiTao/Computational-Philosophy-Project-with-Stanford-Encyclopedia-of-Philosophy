    "main_text": "Combining These Three Sources into a Concept of Causation in the Law || Summary of the differing concepts of causation in the law\n6. Conclusion\n\nAlthough it is possible to hold the view that causation in the law\nshares nothing with causation in science and in everyday life (save\nuse of the same word), such a view is very counterintuitive; some\nrelation between the two concepts of causation surely exists. That\nleaves two more plausible views of this relation. A strong view of\nthis relation would be that the concepts are the same. The three\nunified tests for legal causation last considered, and the two\nmetaphysical views of proximate causation earlier mentioned, all would\nmake such a strong relation plausible. A weaker view of this relation\nwould be to regard part of the law\u2019s concept of\ncausation\u2014\u201ccause-in-fact\u201d\u2014to be the same as\ncausation in science and everyday life, but to regard the other\npart\u2014\u201cproximate causation\u201d\u2014to be the\nconclusions of policy analyses having nothing to do with anything that\ncould be thought of as causation in any ordinary sense.\n\nTo decide which version of this relation is the correct one, one has\nto adjudicate between the various competing conceptions of causation\nin the law that we have examined. To have a baseline of comparison,\none must also resolve the many conundrums surrounding the search for\nthe true metaphysics of causation in philosophy; among other things,\nthis involves hiving off all the features of ordinary usage of\n\u201ccause\u201d that are merely pragmatic features of appropriate\nutterance rather than semantic features fixing the reference of the\nterm. These are daunting tasks to be done on both sides of the\nequation. To complete them, truly the lawyer must \u201cadventure\nhimself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of cause\u201d\n(Pollack 1901: 36). For philosophical lawyers and legal philosophers,\nthat will not be a cost but a benefit.\n",
