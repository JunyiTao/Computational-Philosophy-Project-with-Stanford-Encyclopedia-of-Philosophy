    "main_text": "\n\n\nRichard Sylvan (born Routley, 1935\u20131996) was an Australasian\nphilosopher who was instrumental in starting major schools in: logic\n(especially paraconsistent and relevant logic), metaphysics\n(especially Meinongian ontology), and ethics (especially environmental\nethics). In a large body of writing, Sylvan urged that, from logic to\necology, we are not now thinking well about big problems\u2014but\nthat we can and must do better. \u201cPhilosophers fiddle while the\nworld begins to burn,\u201d he wrote (Hyde 2014, vi). In response, he\nproposed a highly ambitious and radical philosophical project of\nre-evaluation, from foundations up, that has had ongoing impact in\nphilosophy (Casati, Mortensen & Priest 2018; Eckert (ed.) 2018;\nHyde (ed.) 2019, and Weber (ed.) 2019).\n\n\nSylvan is known for proposing and defending some highly controversial\nviews, arguing in favour of inconsistent theories, non-existent\nobjects, and non-human values. Such unorthodox claims were especially\nunpopular in the time Sylvan was writing, in the latter half of the\n20th century. But he thought it was vitally important, for\nphilosophy and for the world, that we take seriously ideas that run\nagainst conventions of the time. (As Robert Meyer put it, \u201cTo\nget the counter-suggestible Sylvan to defend some view, one needed\nfirst to remark that the view was now utterly discredited\u201d,\nMeyer 1996.) What were widely thought to be untenable positions, such\nas Meinongianism, or failed theories, such as Cantor/Frege na\u00efve\nset theory, attracted Sylvan\u2019s attention for what he thought of\nas restoration:\n\nA large part of my philosophical life has, so it appears, looking back\n(and also looking forward) consisted in rehabilitating abandoned\nphilosophical dwellings, habitats, and landscapes. (Preface, Sylvan\nms. Philosophical Rehabilitation, quoted in Hyde 2014,\n124)\n\n\n\nHis contributions are all systematically tied together in the\nservice of a single project, around meaning and value, recognizing the\nlegitimacy and status of marginalized entities; for the landscapes he\nsought to rehabilitate had been, in his view,\n\n\nlaid waste or damaged by predecessors\u2014too many of them, as\nthe predecessors adhered to an entirely defective set of\nvalues\u2026(ibid.).\n\n\nHe sought to make these philosophical landscapes viable by improving\nthe way we reason about them, thereby casting them in a new light that\nshowed their deep interconnectedness.\n\n\nThis entry will use the name \u2018Sylvan\u2019, even though he\ndid not begin using that name until 1983. All his work published before\nthen uses his original name of \u2018Routley\u2019.\n",
