    "main_text": "First Definition (D1): \u201cKnowledge is Perception\u201d: 151e\u2013187a || The \u201cCold Wind\u201d Argument; and the Theory of Flux: 152a\u2013160e\n6.2 The \u201cCold Wind\u201d Argument; and the Theory of Flux: 152a\u2013160e\n\n\nAt 152b1\u2013152c8 Socrates begins his presentation of Protagoras\u2019 view\nthat things are to any human just as they appear to that human by\ntaking the example of a wind which affects two people\ndifferently. Such cases, he says, support Protagoras\u2019\nanalysis: \u201cthat the wind is cold to the one who feels\ncold, but not cold to the one who does not feel\ncold.\u201d\n\n\nSome scholars (Cornford 1935, 33\u20134; Waterlow 1977) think that the\npoint of the argument is that both \u201cthe wind in itself\nis cold\u201d and \u201cthe wind in itself is not cold (but\nwarm)\u201d are true: \u201c\u2018Warm\u2019 and\n\u2018cold\u2019 are two properties which can co-exist in the same\nphysical object. I perceive the one, you perceive the other.\u201d\nThe trouble with this suggestion is that much of the detail of the\nProtagorean/Heracleitean position in 151\u2013184 seems to be generated by\nProtagoras\u2019 desire to avoid contradiction. If Cornford thinks\nthat Protagoras is not concerned to avoid contradicting\nhimself, then he has a huge task of reinterpretation ahead of him.\n\n\nRather, perhaps, the point of the argument is this: Neither \u201cThe\nwind in itself is cold\u201d nor \u201cThe wind in itself is\nwarm\u201d is true. If we had grounds for affirming either, we would\nhave equally good grounds for affirming both; but the conjunction\n\u201cThe wind in itself is cold and the wind in itself is\nwarm\u201d is a contradiction. This contradiction, says Protagoras,\nobliges us to give up all talk about \u201cthe wind in itself,\u201d\nand switch to relativised talk about the wind as it seems to\nme or to you, etc.  (The same contradiction pushes the\nPlato of the Republic in the opposite direction: it leads him\nto place no further trust in any relativised talk, precisely\nbecause such talk cannot get us beyond such\ncontradictions.)\n\n\nSo we have moved from D1, to Hm, to\nPS. At 152c8\u2013152e1 Socrates adds\nthat, in its turn, PS entails Heracleitus\u2019 view that\n\u201cAll is flux,\u201d that there are no stably existing\nobjects with stably enduring qualities. The reason\ngiven for this is the same thought as the one at the centre of the\ncold-wind argument: that everything to which any predicate can be\napplied, according to one perception, can also have the negation of\nthat predicate applied to it, according to an opposite perception with\nequally good credentials.\n\n\nAfter a passage (152e1\u2013153d5) in which Socrates presents what seem to\nbe deliberately bad arguments, eight of them, for Heracleitus\u2019 flux\nthesis, Socrates notes three shocking theses which the flux theory\nimplies:\n\nQualities have no independent existence in time and space\n(153d6\u2013e1).\nQualities do not exist except in perceptions of them\n(153e3\u2013154a8).\n(The dice paradox:) changes in a thing\u2019s qualities are not so much\nchanges in that thing as in perceptions of that thing\n(154a9\u2013155c6).\n\n\n\nThese shocking implications, Socrates says, give the phenomenal\nsubjectivist his reason to reject the entire object/quality\nmetaphysics, and to replace it with a metaphysics of flux.\n\n\nIn 155c\u2013157c the flux theory is used to develop a\nProtagorean/Heracleitean account of perception, to replace accounts\nbased on the object/property ontology of common sense. Socrates notes\nthe subversive implications of the theory of flux for the\nmeaningfulness and truth-aptness of most of our language as it\nstands. (He returns to this point at 183a\u2013b.) The ontology of the flux\ntheory distinguishes kinds of \u201cprocess\u201d\n(kin\u00easis), i.e., of flux, in two ways: as fast or slow,\nand as active or passive. Hence there are four such processes. On\nthese the flux theory\u2019s account of perception rests.\n\n\nA rather similar theory of perception is given by Plato in\nTimaeus 45b\u201346c, 67c\u201368d. This fact has much exercised\nscholars, since it relates closely to the question whether Plato\nhimself accepts the flux theory of perception (cp. Theaetetus\n157c5). The question is important because it connects with the\nquestion of whether the Revisionist or Unitarian reading of 151\u2013187 is\nright.  (For more on this issue, see Cornford 1935 (49\u201350); Crombie\n1963, II (21\u201322); Burnyeat 1990 (17\u201318); McDowell 1973 (139\u2013140),\nChappell 2005 (74\u201378).)\n\n\nAt 157c\u2013160c Socrates states a first objection to the flux theory.\nThis asks how the flux theorist is to distinguish false (deceptive)\nappearances such as dreams from the true (undeceptive) appearances of\nthe waking world. The flux theorist\u2019s answer is that such appearances\nshould not be described as \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019\nappearances to the same person. Rather they should be described as\ndifferent appearances to different people. According to the flux\ntheorist, we have the same person if and only if we have the same\ncombination of a perception and a perceiving (159c\u2013d). So there is no\nneed to call any appearances false. Thus we preserve the\nclaim that all appearances are true\u2014a claim which must be true\nif knowledge is perception in the sense that Socrates has taken that\ndefinition.\n\n\n160b\u2013d summarises the whole of 151\u2013160. Socrates shows how the\nexploration of Theaetetus\u2019 identification of knowledge with perception\nhas led us to develop a whole battery of views: in particular, a\nProtagorean doctrine of the incorrigibility of perception, and a\nHeracleitean account of what perception is. Thus \u201cperception has\none of the two marks of knowledge, infallibility\u201d (Cornford\n1935, 58); \u201cand, if we can accept Protagoras\u2019 identification of\nwhat appears to me with what is, ignoring the addition \u2018for\nme\u2019 and the distinction between being and becoming, the case\nwill be complete.\u201d\n",
