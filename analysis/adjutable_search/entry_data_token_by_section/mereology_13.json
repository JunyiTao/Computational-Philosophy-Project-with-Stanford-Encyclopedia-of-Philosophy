Formally this amounts in each case to dropping the\nsecond conjunct of the antecedent, i.e., to asserting the schema\nexpressed by the relevant consequent with the only proviso that there\nare some \u03c6-ers. In particular, the following schema is the\nunrestricted version of (P.15\u03c8,i), to the\neffect that every specifiable non-empty set of entities has a\nsumi: \n\n\n(P.15i)\nUnrestricted Sumi\n\n\u2203w\u03c6w \u2192\n\u2203zSiz\u03c6w. \n\n\nFor i=3, the extension of EM obtained by\nadding every instance of this schema has a distinguished pedigree and\nis known in the literature as General Extensional Mereology,\nor GEM. It corresponds to the classical systems of\nLe\u015bniewski and of Leonard and Goodman, modulo the underlying\nlogic and choice of primitives. The same theory can be obtained by\nextending EM with (P.152) instead, for in\nthe presence of extensionality the two schemas are equivalent. Indeed,\nit turns out that the latter axiomatization is somewhat redundant:\ngiven just Transitivity and Supplementation, Unrestricted\nSum2 entails all the other axioms, i.e.,\nGEM is the same theory as (P.2) + (P.4) +\n(P.152). By contrast, extending EM with\n(P.151) would result in a weaker theory (Figure 8), though\none can still get the full strength of GEM with the\nhelp of additional axioms. For example, Hovda (2009) shows that the\nfollowing will do: \n\n\n(P.17)\nFiltration\n\n(S1z\u03c6w \u2227 Pxz) \u2192\n\u2203w(\u03c6w \u2227 Owx). \n\n\n(in which case, again, Transitivity and Supplementation would suffice,\ni.e., GEM = (P.2) + (P.4) + (P.151) +\n(P.17)). For other ways of axiomatizatizing of GEM\nusing (P.151), see e.g. Link (1983) and Landman (1991)\n(and, again, Hovda 2009). See also Sharvy (1980, 1983), where the\nextension of M obtained by adding (P.151)\nis called a \u201cquasi-mereology\u201d. \n\n\nFigure 8. A model of EM +\n(P.152) but not of GEM.\n\n\nGEM is a powerful theory, and it was meant to be so\nby its nominalistic forerunners, who were thinking of mereology as a\ngood alternative to set theory. It is also decidable (Tsai 2013a),\nwhereas for example, M, MM, and\nEM, and many extensions thereof turn out to be\nundecidable. (For a comprehensive picture of decidability in\nmereology, see also Tsai 2009, 2011, 2013b.) Just how powerful is\nGEM? To answer this question, let us focus on the\nclassical formulation based on (P.153) and consider the\nfollowing generalized sum operator:\n\n\n(54)\nGeneral Sum\n\n\u03c3x\u03c6x =df\n\u2129zS3z\u03c6w. \n\n\nThen (P.153) and (P.5) can be simplified to a single axiom\nschema:\n\n\n(P.18)\nUnique Unrestricted Sum3\n\n\u2203x\u03c6x \u2192\n\u2203z(z=\u03c3x\u03c6x),\n\n\n\nand we can introduce the following definitions:\n\n\n(55)\nSum\n\nx + y =df \u03c3z(Pzx\n\u2228 Pzy) \n\n(56)\nProduct\n\nx \u00d7 y =df\n\u03c3z(Pzx \u2227 Pzy) \n\n(57)\nDifference\n\nx \u2212 y =df\n\u03c3z(Pzx \u2227 Dzy) \n\n(58)\nComplement\n\n~x =df \u03c3zDzx  \n\n(59)\nUniverse\n\nU =df \u03c3zPzz. \n\n\nNote that (55) and (56) yield the binary operators defined in\n(403) and (49) as special cases. Moreover, in\nGEM the General \u03c8-Product principle\n(P.16\u03c8) is also derivable as a theorem, with\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019 as weak as the requirement of mutual overlap, and\nwe can introduce a corresponding functor as follows:\n\n\n(60)\nGeneral Product\n\n\u03c0x\u03c6x =df\n\u03c3z\u2200x(\u03c6x \u2192\nPzx). \n\n\nThe full strength of the theory can then be appreciated by considering\nthat its models are closed under each of these functors, modulo the\nsatisfiability of the relevant conditions. To be explicit: the\ncondition \u2018DzU\u2019 is unsatisfiable, so U\ncannot have a complement. Likewise products are defined only for\noverlappers and differences only for pairs that leave a remainder.\nOtherwise, however, (55)\u2013(60) yield perfectly well-behaved\nfunctors. Since such functors are the natural mereological analogues\nof the familiar set-theoretic operators, with \u2018\u03c3\u2019 in\nplace of set abstraction, it follows that the parthood relation\naxiomatized by GEM has essentially the same\nproperties as the inclusion relation in standard set theory. More\nprecisely, it is isomorphic to the inclusion relation restricted to\nthe set of all non-empty subsets of a given set, which is to say a\ncomplete Boolean algebra with the zero element removed\u2014a result\nthat can be traced back to Tarski (1935: n. 4) and first proved in\nGrzegorczyk (1955:\n \u00a74).[22]\n\nThere are other equivalent formulations of GEM that\nare noteworthy. For instance, it is a theorem of every extensional\nmereology that parthood amounts to inclusion of overlappers:\n\n\n(61)\n Pxy \u2194 \u2200z(Ozx \u2192\nOzy).  \n\n\nThis means that in an extensional mereology \u2018O\u2019 could be\nused as a primitive and \u2018P\u2019 defined accordingly, as in\nGoodman (1951), and it can be checked that the theory defined by\npostulating (61) together with the Unrestricted Sum principle\n(P.153) and the Antisymmetry axiom (P.3) is equivalent to\nGEM (Eberle 1967). Another elegant axiomatization of\nGEM, due to an earlier work of Tarski\n (1929),[23]\n is obtained by taking just the Transitivity axiom (P.2) together with\nthe Sum2-analogue of the Unique Unrestricted Sum axiom\n(P.18). By contrast, it bears emphasis that the result of adding\n(P.153) to MM is not equivalent\nto GEM, contrary to the \u201cstandard\u201d\ncharacterization given by Simons (1987: 37) and inherited by much\nliterature that followed, including Casati and Varzi (1999) and the\nfirst edition of this\n entry.[24]\n This follows immediately from Pontow's (2004) counterexample\nmentioned at the end of Section 4.3, since the non-extensional model\nin Figure 4 satisfies (P.153), and was first noted in\nPietruszczak (2000, n. 12). More generally, in Section 4.2 we have\nmentioned that in the presence of the binary Product postulate\n(P.13\u03be), with \u03be construed as overlap, the Strong\nSupplementation axiom (P.5) follows from the weaker Supplementation\naxiom (P.4). However, the model shows that the postulate is not\nimplied by (P.153) any more than it is implied by its\nrestricted variants (P.15\u03c8,3). Apart from its relevance\nto the proper characterization of GEM, this result is\nworth stressing also philosophically, for it means that\n(P.153) is by itself too weak to generate a sum out of any\nspecifiable set of objects. In other words, fully unrestricted\ncomposition calls for extensionality, on pain of giving up\nboth supplementation principles. The anti-extensionalist\nshould therefore keep that in mind. (On the other hand, a friend of\nextensionality may welcome this result as an argument in favor of\nadopting (P.152) instead of (P.153), for we have\nalready noted that such a way of sanctioning unrestricted composition\nturns out to be enough, in MM, to entail Strong\nSupplementation along with the existence of all products and, with\nthem, of all sums; see Varzi 2009, with discussion in Rea 2010 and\nCotnoir 2016 . In this sense, the standard way of characterizing\ncomposition given in (35), on which (P.152) is based, is\nnot as neutral as it might seem. On this and related matters,\nindicating that the axiomatic path to \u201cclassical extensional\nmereology\u201d is no straightforward business, see also Hovda 2009\nand Gruszczy\u0144ski and Pietruszczak 2014.) \n\nWould we get a full Boolean algebra by supplementing\nGEM with the Bottom axiom (P.10), i.e., by positing\nthe mereological equivalent of the empty set? One immediate way to\nanswer this question is in the affirmative, but only in a trivial\nsense: we have already seen in Section 3.4 that, under the axioms of\nMM, (P.10) only admits of degenerate one-element\nmodels. Such is the might of the null item. On the other hand, suppose\nwe rely on the \u201cnon-trivial\u201d notions of genuine parthood\nand genuine overlap defined in (37)\u2013(38). And suppose we\nintroduce a corresponding family of \u201cnon-trivial\u201d\noperators for sum, product, etc. Then it can be shown that the theory\nobtained from GEM by adding (P.10) and replacing\n(P.5) and (P.153) with the following non-trivial\nvariants:\n\n\n(P.5G)\nGenuine Strong Supplementation\n\n\u00acPyx \u2192 \u2203z(GPzy \u2227\n\u00acGOzx) \n\n(P.153G)\nGenuine Unrestricted Sum3\n\n\u2203w\u03c6w \u2192\n\u2203z\u2200v(GOzv \u2194\n\u2203w(\u03c6w \u2227 GOwv)) \n\n\nis indeed a full Boolean algebra under the new operators (Pontow and\nSchubert 2006). This shows that, mathematically, mereology does indeed\nhave all the resources to stand as a robust and yet nominalistically\nacceptable alternative to set theory, the real source of difference\nbeing the attitude towards the nature of singletons (as already\nemphasized by Le\u015bniewski 1916 and eventually clarified in Lewis\n1991). As already mentioned, however, from a philosophical perspective\nthe Bottom axiom is by no means a favorite option. The null item would\nhave to exist \u201cnowhere and nowhen\u201d (as Geach 1949: 522 put\nit), or perhaps \u201ceverywhere and everywhen\u201d (as in Efird\nand Stoneham 2005), and that is hard to swallow. One may try to\njustify the gulp in various ways, perhaps by construing the null item\nas a non-existing individual (Bunge 1966), as a Meinongian object\nlacking all nuclear properties (Giraud 2013), as an Heideggerian\nnothing that nothings (Priest 2014a and 2014b: \u00a76.13), or as the\nultimate incarnation of divine omnipresent simplicity (Hudson 2006b,\n2009). But few philosophers would be willing to go ahead and swallow\nfor the sole purpose of neatening up the algebra. \n\nFinally, it is worth recalling that the assumption of atomism\ngenerally allows for significant simplifications in the axiomatics of\nmereology. For instance, we have already seen that\nAEM can be simplified by subsuming (P.5) and (P.7)\nunder a single Atomistic Supplementation principle, (P.5\u2032).\nLikewise, it is easy to see that GEM is compatible\nwith the assumption of Atomicity (just consider the one-element\nmodel), and the resulting theory has some attractive features. In\nparticular, it turns out that AGEM can be simplified\nby replacing any of the Unrestricted Sum postulates in\n(P.15i) with the more perspicuous\n\n\n(P.15i\u2032)\nAtomistic Sumi\n\n\u2203w\u03c6w \u2192\n\u2203zSiz(Av \u2227\n\u2203w(\u03c6w \u2227 Pvw)), \n\n\nwhich asserts, for any non-empty set of entities, the existence of a\nsumi composed exactly of all the atoms that\ncompose those entities. Indeed, GEM also provides the\nresources to overcome the limits of the Atomicity axiom (P.7)\ndiscussed in Section 3.4. For, on the one hand, the infinitely\ndescending chain depicted in Figure 6 is not a model of\nAGEM, since it is missing all sorts of sums. On the\nother, in GEM one can actually strenghten (P.7) in\nsuch a way as to require explicitly that everything be made entirely\natoms, as in\n\n\n(P.7\u2032)\nStrong Atomicity\n\n\u2203yAy \u2227\nPx\u03c3yAy. \n\n\n(See Shiver 2015.) It should be noted, however, that such advantages\ncome at a cost. For regardless of the number of atoms one begins with,\nthe axioms of AGEM impose a fixed relationship\nbetween that number, \u03ba, and the overall number of things, which\nis going to be 2\u03ba\u20131. As Simons (1987: 17)\npointed out, this means that the possible cardinality of an\nAGEM-model is restricted. There are models with 1, 3,\n7, 15, 2\u21350, and many more cardinalities,\nbut no models with, say, cardinality 2, 4, 6, or\n\u21350. Obviously, this is not a consequence of\n(P.15i) alone but also of the other axioms of\nGEM (the unsupplemented pattern in Figure 2, left,\nsatisfies (P.15i) for each i and has 2\nelements, and can be expanded at will to get models of any finite\ncardinality, or indefinitely to get a model with \u21350\nelements, as in Figure 2, center; see also Figure 8 for a supplemented\nnon-filtrated model of (P.151) with 4 elements and Figure\n7, right, for a supplemented non-extensional model of\n(P.153) with 6 elements). Still, it is a fact that in the\npresence of such axioms each (P.15i) rules out a\nlarge number of possibilities. In particular, every finite model of\nAGEM\u2014hence of GEM\u2014is\nbound to involve massive violations of what Comesa\u00f1a (2008)\ncalls \u201cprimitive cardinality\u201d, namely, the intuive thesis\nto the effect that, for any integer n, there could be exactly\nn things. And since the size of any atomistic domain can\nalways be reached from below by taking powers, it also follows that\nAGEM cannot have infinite models of strongly\ninaccessible cardinality. Such is, as Uzquiano (2006) calls it, the\n\u201cprice of universality\u201d in the context of Atomicity.\n\nWhat about \u00c3GEM, the result of adding the\nAtomlessness axiom (P.8)? Obviously the above limitation does not\napply, and the Tarski model mentioned in Section 3.4 will suffice to\nestablish consistency. However, note that every GEM\nmodel\u2014hence every \u00c3GEM model\u2014is\nnecessarily bound at the top, owing to the existence of the universal\nentity U. This is not by itself problematic: while the\nexistence of U is the dual the Bottom axiom, a top jumbo of\nwhich everything is part has none of the formal and philosophical\noddities of a bottom atom that is part of everything (though see\nSection 4.5 for qualifications). Yet a philosopher who believes in\ninfinite divisibility, or at least in its possibility, might feel the\nsame about infinite composability. Just as everything could be made of\natomless gunk that divides forever into smaller and smaller parts,\neverything might be mereological \u201cjunk\u201d\u2014as Schaffer\n(2010: 64) calls it\u2014that composes forever into greater and\ngreater wholes. (One philosopher who held such a view is, again,\nWhitehead, whose mereology of events includes both the Atomlessness\nprinciple and its upward dual, i.e.:\n\n\n(P.19)\nAscent\n\n\u2203yPPxy. \n\n\nSee Whitehead 1919: 101; 1920: 76). GEM is compatible\nwith the former possibility, and \u00c3GEM makes it\ninto a universal necessity. But neither has room for the latter.\nIndeed, the possibility of junk might be attractive also from an\natomist perspective. After all, already Theophilus thought that even\nthough everything is composed of monads, \u201cthere is never an\ninfinite whole in the world, though there are always wholes greater\nthan others ad infinitum\u201d (Leibniz, New\nEssays, I-xiii-21). Is this a serious limitation of\nGEM? More generally, is this a serious limitation of\nany theory in which the existence of U is a\ntheorem\u2014effectively, any theory endorsing at least the\nunrestricted version of (P.14\u03c8)? (In the absence of\nAntisymmetry, one may want to consider this question by understanding\nthe predicate \u2018PP\u2019 in (P.19) in terms of the stronger\ndefinition given in (20\u2032); see above, ad (P.8\u2032).)\nSome authors have argued that it is (Bohn 2009a, 2009b, 2010), given\nthat junk is at least conceivable (see also Tallant 2013) and admits\nof plausible cosmological and mathematical models (Morganti 2009,\nMormann 2014). Others have argued that it isn't, because junk is\nmetaphysically impossible (Schaffer 2010, Watson 2010). Others still\nare openly dismissive about the question (Simons 1987: 83). One may\nalso take the issue to be symptomatic of the sorts of trouble that\naffect any theory that involves quantification over absolutely\neverything, as the Unrestricted Sum principles in\n(P.15i) obviously do (see Spencer 2012, though his\nremarks focus on mereological theories formulated in terms of plural\nquantification). One way or the other, from a formal perspective the\nincompatibility with Ascent may be viewed as an unpleasant consequence\nof (P.15i), and a reason to go for weaker\ntheories. In particular, it may be viewed as a reason to endorse only\nfinitary sums, which is to say only instances of\n(P.12\u03be,i), or perhaps its unrestricted\nversion:\n\n\n(P.12i)\nFinitary Unrestricted Sumi\n\n\u2203zSizxy. \n\n\n(See Contessa 2012 and Bohn 2012: 216 for explicit suggestions in this\nspirit.) This would be consistent with the existence of junky worlds\nas it is consistent with the existence of gunky worlds. Yet it should\nbe noted that even this move has its costs. For example, it turns out\nthat in a world that is both gunky and junky (what Bohn calls\n\u201chunk\u201d) (P.12i) is in tension with the\nComplementation principle (P.6) for each i (Cotnoir 2014).\nMoreover, while (P.12i) is compatible with junky\nworlds, i.e., models that fully satisfy the Ascent axiom\n(P.19), it is in tension with the possibility of worlds containing\njunky structures along with other, disjoint elements (Giberman 2015).\n\n",
