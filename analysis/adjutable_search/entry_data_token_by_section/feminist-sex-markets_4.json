These markets tend to\nexploit the social vulnerabilities of others, lack informational\ntransparency, pose unacceptably high risks for some participants, or\ncontribute to the social marginalization of some groups. For example,\nmarkets in sexual services that (i) seek providers from stigmatized or\ndisempowered social classes, (ii) fail to create conditions for\ninformed consent, (iii) damage the health of participants, or (iv)\nreinforce pernicious stereotypes about women or other groups, are of\nquestionable value. Although these features of markets are usually\ncontingent, when they persist, states are justified in restricting or\nregulating such markets, especially if they can do so without\nproducing more harm than good (Satz 2010). Anne Phillips contends that\nmarkets in sexual services arise only under conditions of social\ninequality. She writes, \u201cthe inequality that attends such\nmarkets is not just contingent; it is an intrinsic feature\u201d\n(Phillips 2011: 738). People offer sexual intimacy, or bodily organs\nor substances, primarily as acts of compassion, and do not in ordinary\ncircumstances commoditize such bodily capacities. Phillips points out\nthat few customers in such markets would be willing to enter as\nsellers. Those who do market their sexual, reproductive, or other\nbasic bodily capacities do so only when background circumstance compel\nthem to do so.\n\nCarole Pateman argues that the work of a female prostitute is\ndifferent from other jobs, as it expresses the inferior social and\npolitical status of women. Moreover, because people\u2019s bodies and\nsexual capacities are an integral part of their identity as men and\nwomen, the woman who works as a prostitute sells her womanhood and\ntherefore herself (Pateman 1988: 207). Christine Overall similarly\nargues that prostitution is a transaction in which one person must be\ndefined as a social subordinate who caters to the desires of another.\nShe claims that the prostitute\u2019s work differs from that of other\nlow-status workers in that it is a form of labor that cannot be\nreciprocated (Overall 1992: 718). Elizabeth Anderson develops this\nidea and argues that the good of sex is\n\n\nrealized only when each partner reciprocates the other\u2019s gift\nin kind, offering her own sexuality in the same spirit in\nwhich she received the other\u2019s\u2014as a genuine offering of\nthe self. The commodification of sexual \u201cservices\u201d\ndestroys the kind of reciprocity required to realize human sexuality\nas a shared good,\n\n\nand may corrupt non-market sexual relationships by promoting the\nvaluation of women in terms of their market worth (Anderson 1993:\n154\u201355; see also Radin 1996: 133).\n\nAlthough Phillips, Pateman, Overall, and Anderson regard marketing\none\u2019s sexual capacities as inherently degrading and oppressive,\nother feminist theorists contend that these features of the work are\ncontingent. Shrage argues that sex markets, like other markets, often\nexploit sexist ideas that relegate women to subservient roles, and\ntheir existence in this form can perpetuate pernicious social myths\nthat stigmatize women. Yet, the background conditions of such markets\ncan change, especially as the norms of gender and sexuality evolve in\nways that are less sexist (Shrage 1989: 357). Debra Satz writes\nthat\n\n\nIf prostitution is wrong it is because of its effects on how men\nperceive women and on how women perceive themselves. In our society,\nprostitution represents women as the sexual servants of men. (Satz\n1995: 78)\n\n\nSatz suggests that the negative image of women promoted by\nprostitution \u201cshapes and influences the way women as a whole are\nseen\u201d (Satz 1995: 79). However, if the industry were\nrestructured to be less sexist, then its impact on society would be\ndifferent.\n\nMartha Nussbaum questions whether the sale of sexual services\ngenuinely damages the persons who provide them or women as a whole.\nNussbaum points out that, two centuries ago, the use of one\u2019s\nartistic talents for pay, such as singing or acting, was regarded as a\nform of prostitution (Nussbaum 1999: 277). Nussbaum acknowledges that\nsex workers are currently stigmatized for their profession, but\nquestions whether the stigma that attaches to their work is justified.\nBy tracing this stigma both to aristocratic prejudice toward waged\nlaborers and to moralistic attitudes and anxieties regarding female\nsexual expression, Nussbaum challenges the rational basis of this\nsocial stigma (Nussbaum 1999: 278\u201379, 286\u201388). She\nconcludes that feminists should oppose the stigmatization of sex work,\nrather than oppose sex work for its contribution to the stigmatization\nof women. Nussbaum also questions seven common claims against\nprostitution: that it involves excessive risks, the prostitute has\nlittle autonomy, it violates the prostitute\u2019s bodily integrity,\nprostitution has a destructive effect on non-commercial intimate\nrelationships, prostitution violates a person\u2019s inalienable\nright to her sexuality, it contributes to a male-dominated social\norder, and it relies on the economic coercion of workers. Nussbaum\nargues that the problems associated with prostitution are components\nof many other kinds of work and social practices, and that these\nproblems are not inherent to the work but are often a function of the\nprostitute\u2019s working conditions and treatment by others\n(Nussbaum 1999: 288\u201397, see also Moen 2012).\n\nScott Anderson resists the move to treat prostitution like other forms\nof work. He argues that normalizing prostitution undermines a\nperson\u2019s right to sexual autonomy, which is an important value\ndefended by radical feminists. Prostitutes waive their right to sexual\nautonomy because their jobs place them under contractual obligations\nto have sex, and thus diminish their control over when and with whom\nthey have sex. Anderson acknowledges that all jobs, to some degree,\ndiminish various forms of autonomy. He contends that sexual autonomy\nshould be valued differently from other forms, such as a\nperson\u2019s control over when and to whom they serve food, provide\na massage or dance, offer expert advice, or talk philosophy. He\nwrites\n\n\na person\u2019s sexuality almost always figures prominently as an\naspect of his or her self-conception, status in society, and economic\nand social prospects\u2026It is because sex plays such a pivotal\nrole in the lives of most adults\u2026that it creates its own\nspecial\u2026realm within which one can be more or less autonomous.\n(Anderson 2006: 386)\n\n\nAnderson here echoes Pateman\u2019s contention that our sexual\ncapacities and practices are an integral part of who we are as men and\nwomen. For this reason, a person\u2019s sexual autonomy should be\nnon-alienable, because to alienate it is to destroy a person\u2019s\nwholeness or integrity.\n\nIn response to Anderson, Hallie Liberto distinguishes three ways of\nalienating a right or good. First, one can waive a right to x (in\na weak sense) by granting someone access to x with the\nunderstanding that, at any moment, permission to use x can be\nrevoked. Second, one can waive a right to x (in a strong sense) by\ngranting someone access to x for a duration of time, with the\nunderstanding that permission to use x cannot be revoked during\nthis period (presumably if other terms of the lease are met). Third,\none can relinquish a right to x by transferring that right, as\nthrough a sale or gift. In this case, permission to use x is\ngranted permanently and cannot be revoked if other terms of the\ntransfer are met. Liberto points out that those who consider the\nmarketing of sexual services a legitimate form of work assume that the\nsex worker, like other workers, will only be alienating her right of\ncontrol over her body and sexual labor in a weak sense (Liberto 2009:\n141\u201343; see also Schwarzenbach 1991: 112). In a society in which\nany form of forced labor is prohibited (e.g., slavery, indentured\nservitude), workers are generally permitted to back out of labor\ncontracts, although in doing so they typically relinquish all expected\nbenefits (Shrage 2016).\n\nSex worker activists and advocates have long argued that they are not\npermanently alienating (selling) their sexual capacities, but rather\nare exchanging sexual labor for benefits (Schwarzenbach 1991:\n112\u201314). A sex worker\u2019s right to sexual autonomy is not\nundermined in contexts where she retains the right to withdraw from\nher labor contracts at any time (Tuana and Shrage 2003: 33; Shrage\n2016). Carol Leigh and Norma Jean Almodovar suggest that\nanti-prostitution laws undermine sexual autonomy by not allowing\nadults to enter mutually advantageous sexual agreements (Leigh 2004;\nAlmodovar 2002). Peter de Marneffe argues for limiting sex worker\ncontracts in ways similar to other forms of dangerous and potentially\nharmful work. Restricting and regulating prostitution would balance\nrespect for the autonomy of service providers (and consumers of sexual\nservices) with society\u2019s interest in protecting its members from\nharm (de Marneffe 2010).\n",
