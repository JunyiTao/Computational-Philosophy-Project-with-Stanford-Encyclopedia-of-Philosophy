Arguments for Value Incommensurability and Incomparability\n\nWhile recent research has focused on value incomparability and how to\ninterpret examples that have the structure described by the Small\nImprovement Argument, earlier research had less focus on the structure\nof value but focused more on substantial consideration that talks in\nfavor of incomparability. In this section, such considerations will be\ndiscussed.\n\nFirst, a note on terminology. Most of the arguments discuss something\nthat is similar to the phenomenon of incomparability but refer to the\nphenomenon in terms of \u201cincommensurability\u201d.  In this\nsection, the terminology of the discussed authors will be respected,\nand thus \u201cincommensurability\u201d will sometimes be used, even\nthough, the authors possibly refer to the phenomenon of\nincomparability.\n\nIt should be noted that value pluralism seems central for the\npossibility of incomparability. After all, the most direct argument\nagainst the possibility that values are incommensurable or\nincomparable is based on value monism (e.g., Mill 1861 [1979] and Sidgwick\n1874 [1981]). Donald Regan, for example, argues that \u201cgiven any two\nitems (objects, experiences, states of affairs, whatever) sufficiently\nwell specified so that it is apposite to inquire into their\n(intrinsic) value in the Moorean sense, then either one is better than\nthe other, or the two are precisely equal in value\u201d (Regan 1997,\n129).\n\nThis argument has been questioned. As Ruth Chang points out, by\nreferring to John Stuart Mill, that values may have both qualitative\nand quantitative aspects could in principle allow for value bearers to\nbe incomparable due to a difference in their qualitative features.\n(Chang 1997b, 16\u201317).\n\nFor purposes of this entry, it will not be assumed that value monism\nrules out incomparability. In any case, many philosophers argue for\nsome form of value pluralism (Berlin 1969, Finnis 1981, Nagel 1979,\nRaz 1986, Stocker 1990, Taylor 1982, Williams 1981). Although this\nentry will not assume value pluralism, most philosophers who argue for\nincommensurability or incomparability are value pluralists, so it will\nbe simpler to present their views by talking of separate values.\n",
