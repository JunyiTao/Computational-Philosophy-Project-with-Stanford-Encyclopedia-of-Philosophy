The dynamical approach,\na branch of evolutionary game theory, develops formal models of how\nstrategy choice evolves in a population whose members repeatedly play\nsome game against each another. In contrast with \u201cstatic\u201d\ngame theory (i.e., the study of equilibria), dynamical models\nincorporate an explicitly temporal parameter. The basic goal is to\nstudy the conditions under which dynamical models with various\nproperties tend to converge to static equilibria with various\nproperties.\n\n\nDynamical models of equilibrium selection differ along several\ndimensions. Does the model depict learning by individual players or\naggregate trends in the population as a whole? How much rationality\ndoes the model attribute to players? Is the model deterministic or\nstochastic? Do players have limited or unlimited memory of past events?\nHow much common knowledge do players have about the game\u2019s payoff\nstructure? Can players learn about the results of interactions in which\nthey do not participate? Do the same players participate in each round\nof play, or are the players repeatedly drawn anew from a larger\npopulation? Is that larger population modeled as finite or infinite? An\noverview of the burgeoning and forbiddingly technical literature on\nthese questions falls beyond the scope of this article. We confine\nattention here to three developments: replicator dynamics; fictitious\nplay; and sophisticated Bayesian learning. Interested readers should\nconsult the detailed surveys offered by Drew Fudenberg and David Levine\n(1998) and H. Peyton Young (2004).\n\nReplicator dynamics: In this deterministic model,\nintroduced by Peter Taylor and Leo Jonker (1978), the proportion of\nplayers choosing some strategy grows proportionally to the difference\nbetween that strategy\u2019s mean payoff and the mean payoff for the\npopulation as a whole. The model does not describe how the behavior of\nindividual players changes over time. Rather, the model describes\naggregate trends in the population as a whole.\n\n\nA stable steady state of a dynamical system is a state\n\\(s\\) with the following two features: once the system enters\n\\(s\\), it never leaves it; and once the system approaches\n\u201cclose enough\u201d to \\(s\\), then it always remains near\n\\(s\\). The basin of attraction of \\(s\\) is the set\nof states such that, if the dynamical system begins in one of those\nstates, then it will eventually converge towards \\(s\\). In many\ncases, the best way to understand a dynamical system is to construct a\n\u201cphase portrait\u201d diagramming its steady states and their\nbasins of attraction. In the case of interest to us here, the\n\u201cstate\u201d of a dynamical system is simply the proportion of\nplayers choosing each strategy.\n\n\nTwo easy formal results convey the flavor of research on replicator\ndynamics: every stable steady state of replicator dynamics is a Nash\nequilibrium; and every evolutionarily stable equilibrium is a stable\nsteady state of replicator dynamics.\n\n\nReplicator dynamics originated within evolutionary biology.\nSubsequently, game theorists such as Larry Samuelson (1997) have argued\nthat it illuminates social interaction among humans. Within philosophy,\nBrian Skyrms (1996, 1998) argues that replicator dynamics shows how\nconventions of property and linguistic meaning could evolve without any\nneed for Lewisian \u201csalience.\u201d He places particular emphasis\nupon signaling games, that is, games in which a sender wishes\nto communicate a message to a receiver, a message determining which\naction from among a fixed repertoire the receiver will perform. (See\n section 7.1 \n for more detail on signaling games.) For\ncertain signaling games, replicator dynamics almost always converges to\nan evolutionarily stable signaling convention. Which convention emerges\ndepends solely upon chance facts about players\u2019 initial\npropensities to adopt various strategies (i.e., the basin of attraction\nfrom which the system happens to begin). As Skyrms puts it,\n\u201c[w]hich signaling system is selected is a matter of chance,\nnot of salience\u201d (1996, p. 93).\n\n\nDespite the popularity of replicator dynamics, critics such as H.\nPeyton Young (1998) remain skeptical. The most natural motivation for\nreplicator dynamics is biological. We conceptualize players as animals\ngenetically programmed to exhibit certain behaviors. Creatures who\nachieve higher payoffs have higher reproductive fitness, and they pass\ntheir strategy choices along to their progeny. Natural selection\ntherefore causes certain behaviors to become more prevalent. Under\nthese assumptions, replicator dynamics seems plausible. But it is not\nclear that a comparable rationale applies to human interaction, since\nhumans generally act not based solely upon their genetic programming\nbut rather upon their beliefs and desires. Why should the choices of\nindividual human agents yield the pattern described by replicator\ndynamics?\n\n\nIn response to this worry, theorists try to derive replicator dynamics\nfrom models of individual adaptive behavior. Some models posit that\npeople tend to imitate the behavior of others, based either on how\npopular or how successful that behavior seems. Other models posit some\nkind of reinforcement mechanism. Neither approach accords very well\nwith the traditional preference among both philosophers and economists\nfor rational explanations. Samuelson (1997, p. 23) responds\nthat such approaches may nevertheless be appropriate \u201cif we are\ninterested in people, rather than ideally rational agents.\u201d But\nit is hardly obvious that our best cognitive science of actual human\npsychology will eschew rational explanation in favor of the\npsychological mechanisms currently being invoked to underwrite\nreplicator dynamics.\n\nFictitious play: George Brown (1951) introduced fictitious\nplay as \u201cpre-play\u201d reasoning, in which a player mentally\nsimulates repeated trials of a game against an imaginary opponent so\nas to predict her real opponent\u2019s actions. The phrase\n\u201cfictitious play\u201d has become a misnomer, because\nresearchers now typically apply it to models in which players learn\nbased upon their actual experience of repeated play. In paradigmatic\nfictitious play models, each player plays a \u201cbest reply\u201d\nto the observed historical frequency of her opponents\u2019 past actions.\nThis policy is rational if: the player assumes that each opponent\nplays some stationary (either pure or mixed) strategy; the player\nemploys Bayesian updating to determine the probability that each\nopponent will perform a given action in the next round; and the player\nseeks to maximize her expected payoff for that round based upon her\ncurrent probability distribution over her opponents\u2019 actions. It is\neasy to show that, if players engaged in fictitious play enter into a\nstrict Nash equilibrium, then they stay in it forever. Moreover, there\nare some circumstances (e.g., zero-sum two-person games) in which\nfictitious play converges to Nash equilibrium behavior. However, as\nLloyd Shapley (1964) first showed, there are games in which fictitious\nplay does not always converge to equilibrium behavior.\n\n\nThe literature explores many different variations on this theme. One\ncan restrict how many past trials the player remembers or how much\nweight the player places upon older trials. One can embed the player\nin a large population and restrict how much a player knows about\ninteractions within that population. One can introduce a\n\u201cneighborhood structure,\u201d so that players interact only\nwith their neighbors. One can introduce a stochastic element. For\ninstance, building on work of M. I. Friedlin and A. D. Wentzell (1984)\nand Michihiro Kandori, George Mailath, and Rafael Rob (1993),\nH. Peyton Young (1993, 1996, 1998) develops a model of how conventions\nevolve in which each player chooses a \u201cbest reply\u201d with\nprobability \\(1-\\varepsilon\\) and some random strategy with\nprobability \\(\\varepsilon\\). One can also generalize the fictitious play\nframework to accommodate correlated equilibrium. Peter Vanderschraaf\n(2001) explores a variant of fictitious play in which a player frames\nhypotheses about correlations between her opponents\u2019 strategies and\nexternal events. Applying this framework to convention, he argues that\nwe can treat the emergence of correlated equilibrium conventions as an\ninstance of rational belief-fixation through inductive\ndeliberation.\n\n\nFictitious play does not attribute knowledge of other people\u2019s\npayoffs or their rationality. It does not depict players as reasoning\nabout the reasoning of others. Instead, it depicts players as\nperforming a mechanical statistical inference that converts an\naction\u2019s observed historical frequency into a prediction about\nits future probability of recurrence. For this reason, critics such as\nEhud Kalai and Ehud Lehrer (1993) contend that fictitious play\nattributes to players insufficient recognition that they are engaged in\nstrategic interaction. For instance, a player who reasons in\naccord with fictitious play implicitly assumes that each opponent plays\nsome stationary (either pure or mixed) strategy. This assumption\noverlooks that her opponents are themselves updating their beliefs and\nactions based upon prior interaction. It also prevents players from\ndetecting patterns in the data (such as an opponent who plays one\nstrategy in odd-numbered trials and another strategy in even-numbered\ntrials). Moreover, fictitious play instructs a player to maximize her\nexpected payoff for the current round of play. This\n\u201cmyopic\u201d approach precludes maximizing one\u2019s future\nexpected payoff at the price of lowering one\u2019s current payoff\n(e.g., playing Hawk rather than Dove even if I expect my opponent to do\nlikewise, since I believe that I can eventually \u201cteach\u201d my\nopponent to back down and play Dove in future rounds).\n\nSophisticated Bayesian learning: This approach, initiated\nby Paul Milgrom and John Robert (1991), replaces the rather crude\nstatistical inference posited by fictitious play with a more refined\nconception of inductive deliberation. Specifically, it abandons the\nquestionable assumption that one faces stationary strategies from\none\u2019s opponents. Ehud Kalai and Ehud Lehrer (1993) offer a widely\ndiscussed model of sophisticated Bayesian learning. Players engaged in\nan infinitely repeated game constantly update probability distributions\ndefined over the set of possible strategies played by their opponents,\nwhere a strategy is a function from the set of possible histories to\nthe set of possible actions. At each stage, a player chooses an action\nthat maximizes the expected value of her payoffs for the\nentire future sequence of trials, not just for the present\ntrial. This approach allows a player to discern patterns in her\nopponents\u2019 behavior, including patterns that depend upon her own\nactions. It also allows her to sacrifice current payoff for a higher\nexpected long-term payoff. Kalai and Lehrer prove that their procedure\nalmost always converges to something approximating Nash equilibrium,\nunder the crucial assumption (the \u201cgrain of truth\u201d\nassumption) that each player begins by assigning positive probability\nto all strategies that actually occur.\n\n\nCritics such as John Nachbar (1997) and Dean Foster and H. Peyton Young\n(2001) argue that there is no reason to accept the \u201cgrain of\ntruth\u201d assumption. From this perspective, Kalai and Lehrer merely\npush the problem back to explaining how players converge upon a\nsuitable set of prior probabilities satisfying the \u201cgrain of\ntruth\u201d assumption. Although Kalai and Lehrer\u2019s proof\nactually requires only a somewhat weakened version of this assumption,\nthe problem persists: sophisticated Bayesian learning converges to Nash\nequilibrium only under special assumptions about players\u2019 prior\ncoordinated expectations, assumptions that players might well fail to\nsatisfy.\n\n\nSanjeev Goyal and Maarten Janssen (1996) develop this criticism,\nconnecting it with the philosophical problem of induction, especially\nNelson Goodman\u2019s grue problem. Robert Sugden (1998, 2011) further develops\nthe criticism, targeting not just sophisticated Bayesian learning but\nvirtually every other learning model found in the current\nliterature. As the grue problem highlights, there are many different\nway of extrapolating past observations into predictions about the\nfuture. In philosophy of science, the traditional solution to this\ndifficulty is that only certain predicates are\n\u201cprojectible.\u201d But Sugden argues that the difficulty is\nmore acute for strategic interaction, since successful coordination\nrequires shared standards of projectibility. For instance, suppose\nthat I repeatedly play a coordination game with an opponent who has\ntwo different strategy options: \\(s_{1}\\) and\n\\(s_{2}\\). Up until time \\(t\\), my opponent has\nalways played \\(s_{1}\\). I might \u201cproject\u201d\nthis pattern into the future, predicting that my opponent will\nhenceforth play \\(s_{1}\\). But I might instead project a\n\u201cgrueified\u201d pattern, such as: \u201cplay\n\\(s_{1}\\) until time \\(t\\), and then play\n\\(s_{2}\\).\u201d Which inductive inference I make\ndepends upon which predicates I regard as projectible. There is no\nguarantee that my opponent shares my standards of projectibility. In\neffect, then, convergence through inductive deliberation requires me\nand my opponent to solve a new coordination problem: coordinating our\nstandards of projectibility. According to Sugden, existing dynamical models implicitly assume\nthat players have already solved this new coordination problem. Sugden\nconcludes that a full explanation of equilibrium selection requires\nsomething like Lewis\u2019s notion of salience. In particular, it\nrequires shared psychological standards regarding which patterns are\nprojectible and which are not. Sugden urges, contra Skyrms, that\ndynamical models of convention cannot displace salience from its\ncentral role in understanding convention.\n\n\nAs the foregoing discussion indicates, the dynamical study of\nequilibrium selection is a diverse, fast-growing area of \nresearch.[7]\nMoreover, it raises difficult questions on the boundary between\neconomics and philosophy, such as how to analyze inductive reasoning,\nhow much rationality to attribute to social agents, and so on. It is\nundeniable that, in a wide variety of circumstances, people\nsuccessfully converge upon a single unique convention amidst a range of\nalternatives. It seems equally undeniable that we do not yet fully\nunderstand the social and psychological mechanisms that accomplish this\ndeceptively simple feat.\n",
