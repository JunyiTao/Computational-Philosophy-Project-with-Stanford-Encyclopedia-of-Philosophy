    "main_text": "The Naturalism Debate\n5. The Naturalism Debate\n\nEvolutionists were successful in court. Nevertheless, Laudan and\nfellow thinkers inspired the Creationists to new efforts, and\nsince the Arkansas court case, the philosophical dimension to the\nevolution/Creationism controversy has been much increased. In\nparticular, philosophical arguments are central to the thinking of the\nleader of today\u2019s creationists, Berkeley law professor, Phillip\nJohnson, whose reputation was made with the anti-evolutionary tract\nDarwin on Trial (1991). (Johnson\u2019s influence and importance\nis recognized by all and he has become leader emeritus. As we\nshall see, the task of leadership then got passed to younger people,\nespecially the biochemist Michael Behe and the\nphilosopher-mathematician William Dembski.) In respects, Johnson just\nrepeated the arguments of the Creation Scientists (those given in an\nearlier section) \u2013 gaps in the fossil record and so forth\n\u2014 but at the same time he stressed that the Creation/evolution\ndebate is not just one of science versus religion or good science\nversus bad science, but rather of conflicting philosophical positions.\nThe implication was that one philosophy is much like another, or\nrather the implication was that one person\u2019s philosophy is another\nperson\u2019s poison and that it is all a matter of personal opinion.\nBehind this one sees the lawyer\u2019s mind at work that, if it is all a\nmatter of philosophy, then there is nothing in the United States\nConstitution which bars the teaching of Creationism in schools. (For\nbetter or for worse, one sees the heavy hand of Thomas Kuhn here, and\nhis claim in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions that\nthe change from one paradigm to another is akin to a political\nrevolution, not ultimately fueled by logic but more by\nextra-scientific factors, like emotions and simple preferences. In the\nArkansas trial, Kuhn was as oft mentioned by the prosecutors as was\nPopper.)\n\nCrucial to Johnson\u2019s position are a number of fine distinctions. He\ndistinguishes between what he calls \u201cmethodological\nnaturalism\u201d and \u201cmetaphysical naturalism\u201d. The\nformer is the scientific stance of trying to explain by laws and by\nrefusing to introduce miracles. A methodological naturalist would\ninsist on explaining all phenomena, however strange, in natural terms.\nElijah setting fire to the water-drenched sacrifice, for instance,\nwould be explained in terms of lightning striking or some such thing.\nThe latter is the philosophical stance that insists that there is\nnothing beyond the natural \u2013 no God, no supernatural, no\nnothing. \u2018Naturalism is a metaphysical doctrine, which\nmeans simply that it states a particular view of what is ultimately\nreal and unreal. According to naturalism, what is ultimately real is\nnature, which consists of the fundamental particles that make up what\nwe call matter and energy, together with the natural laws that govern\nhow those particles behave. Nature itself is ultimately all there is,\nat least as far as we are concerned\u2019 (Johnson 1995, 37\u201338).\n\nThen there is someone that Johnson calls a \u2018theistic\nrealist.\u2019 This is someone who believes in a God, and that this\nGod can and does intervene in the natural world. \u2018God always has\nthe option of working through regular secondary mechanisms, and we\nobserve such mechanisms frequently. On the other hand, many important\nquestions \u2013 including the origin of genetic information and\nhuman consciousness \u2013 may not be explicable in terms of\nunintelligent causes, just as a computer or a book cannot be explained\nthat way\u2019 (p. 209). Johnson thinks of himself as a theistic\nrealist, and hence as such in opposition to metaphysical realism.\nMethodological realism, which he links with evolutionism, would seem\nto be distinct from metaphysical realism, but it is Johnson\u2019s claim\nthat the former slides into the latter. Hence, the evolutionist is the\nmethodological realist, is the metaphysical realist, is the opponent\nof the theistic realist \u2013 and as far as Johnson is concerned,\nthe genuine theistic realist is one who takes a pretty literalistic\nreading of the Bible. So ultimately, it is all less a matter of\nscience and more a matter of attitudes and philosophy. Evolution and\nCreationism are different world pictures, and it is conceptually,\nsocially, pedagogically, and with good luck in the future legally\nwrong to treat them differently. More than this, it is incorporated\ninto Johnson\u2019s argument that Creationism (a.k.a. Theistic Realism) is\nthe only genuine form of Christianity.\n\nBut does any of this really follow? The evolutionist would claim not.\nThe key notion in Johnson\u2019s attack is clearly methodological\nnaturalism. Metaphysical naturalism, having been defined as something\nwhich precludes theism, has been set up as a philosophy with a\nreligion-like status. It necessarily perpetuates the conflict between\nreligion and science. But as Johnson himself notes, many people think\nthat they can be methodological naturalists and theists.\nMethodological naturalism is not a religion equivalent. Is this\npossible, at least in a consistent way with intellectual integrity? It\nis Johnson\u2019s claim that it is not, for he wants the religion/science\nwar to be absolute with no captives or compromises.\n",
