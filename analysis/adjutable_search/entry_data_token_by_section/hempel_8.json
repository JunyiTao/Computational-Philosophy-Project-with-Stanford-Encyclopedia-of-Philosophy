    "main_text": "Scientific Reasoning || The Limits of Extensionality\n3.3 The Limits of Extensionality\n\nGoodman (1955) draws a distinction between universal conditional\ngeneralizations that can be confirmed by their instances and those\nthat cannot, where the former are said to be\n\u201cprojectible\u201d. Those that can be projected from examined\ncases to unexamined ones are those that have a history of past\nprojections. Thus, the predicate \u201cblack\u201d has many past\nprojections, but the predicate \u201cblite\u201d does not. Since a\nhistory of past projections enhances the projectibility of predicates\nonly when they are successful, the measure of a predicate\u2019s\ndegree of projectibility, which Goodman calls its degree of\nentrenchment, is the relative frequency of its successful use in\npast predictions. Hume observed that, no matter how consistently a\nregularity has held in the past, that provides no guarantee it will\ncontinue to hold in the future. Goodman nevertheless adopted the past\nas a guide, which qualifies as his solution to the linguistic version\nof Hume\u2019s problem of induction.\n\nSince Goodman is offering a pragmatic solution for (what most would\nassume to be) a syntactical and semantical problem, it may be useful\nto consider whether or not there might be a more promising approach.\nIn embracing Goodman\u2019s approach, Hempel was modifying his\nconception of lawlike sentences as extensional\ngeneralizations which are restricted to purely qualitative predicates\nwhich make no mention of specific individuals, specific places or\nspecific times, but which might, in special cases, reference samples\nor exemplars, such as the standard meter or the atomic clock (Hempel\n1965d: 269, where he also mentions Popper\u2019s notion of universal\npredicates). Goodman\u2019s account does not actually capture the\nconcept of laws but the rather restricted notion of hypotheses that\nhave been projected and are supposed to be laws. Laws themselves,\nafter all, exist even when they have not yet been discovered, as in\nthe case of Archimedes\u2019 principle before Archimedes,\nSnell\u2019s law before Snell, and Newton\u2019s before Newton. A\nmore promising approach lay in the direction of universals in\nPopper\u2019s sense, which are dispositions with subjunctive force,\nwhere laws can be characterized as unrestricted intensional\nconditionals.\n\nPopper (1965, 1968) championed falsifiability as a criterion of\ndemarcation that is more appropriate than verifiability as a criterion\nof meaningfulness, on the ground that what we need is a basis for\ndistinguishing scientific from nonscientific statements, where the\nlatter can still be meaningful, even when they are not scientific. He\nsuggested that laws should be understood as having the force of\nprohibitions, which are empirically testable by attempts to\nfalsify them. And he observed there are no \u201cparadoxes of\nfalsification\u201d to parallel the \u201cparadoxes of\nconfirmation\u201d. Even in the case of material conditionals, the\nonly falsifying instances are those that combine the truth of their\nantecedents with the falsity of their consequents. Relative to\n\u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\)\u201d, for example, the only potential\nfalsifiers are instances of \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d that are instances of\n\u201c\\(\\neg Bx\\)\u201d, and similarly for \u201c\\((x)(\\neg Bx\n\\supset \\neg Rx)\\)\u201d and for \u201c\\((x)(\\neg Rx \\vee\nBx)\\)\u201d, not to mention its subjunctive counterpart,\n\u201c\\((x)(Rx \\rightarrow Bx)\\)\u201d. The absence of paradox\nsuggested that Popper\u2019s approach to problems of demarcation and\nof cognitive significance might possess substantial advantages over\nthe alternatives.\n4. Scientific Explanations\n\nHempel\u2019s most important contributions to the theory of science\nhave been a series of explications of the structure of scientific\nexplanations. His methodology was such that, following the preliminary\nexamination of the linguistic and physical phenomena under\nconsideration, he would advance a semi-formal characterization, one\nwhich he would subsequently subject to formal characterization using\nthe resources of symbolic logic. The overarching theme of his work was\nthe conception of explanation by subsumption, where specific events\nare subsumed by corresponding laws (of physics, of chemistry, of\nbiology, and so forth). The conception of explanation by subsumption\nis rather ancient in its lineage, but Hempel advanced explicit\nformulations that drew distinctions between explanations of different\nkinds, especially those that invoke universal (or deterministic) laws,\nstatistical (or probabilistic) laws, and the explanation of laws by\nmeans of theories.\n\nHempel implemented the conception of subsumption by presuming that\nexplanations explain the occurrence of singular events by deriving\ntheir descriptions from premises that include at least one lawlike\nsentence, which thereby displays (what he called) their nomic\nexpectability. In the simplest cases, explanations assume the\nfollowing form:\n\n\n\n\nPremises:\n\\(L_1, L_2,\\ldots L_k\\) \n\n\\(C_1,\nC_2,\\ldots C_r\\) \n\nConclusion:\n\\(E\\) \n\n\n\nFigure 2. An Explanation Schema\n\n\nThus, in relation to Figure 2, \\(C_1\\), \\(C_2\\),\u2026, \\(C_r\\)\ndescribe specific conditions (referred to as \u201cinitial\u201d or\n\u201cantecedent\u201d) and \\(L_1\\), \\(L_2\\),\u2026, \\(L_k\\)\ngeneral laws, where \u201c\\(E\\)\u201d describes the\nevent to be explained. The explanation takes the form of an inductive\nor deductive argument, where the premises are called the\n\u201cexplanans\u201d and the conclusion the\n\u201cexplanandum\u201d.\n\nRichard Jeffrey (1969) noted that Hempel\u2019s conception harmonizes\nwell with Aristotle\u2019s definition of (what he called)\nunqualified scientific knowledge,\n\n\n[where] the premisses of demonstrated knowledge must be true, primary,\nimmediate, better known than and prior to the conclusion, which is\nfurther related to them as effect to cause. (Posterior\nAnalytics 1.71\u20132, as quoted in Jeffrey 1969: 104)\n\n\nA potentially even more illuminating comparison emerges from the\nperspective of Aristotle\u2019s theory of the four causes, where the\nlaws are the material cause, the antecedent conditions the efficient\ncause, the logical relation between the explanans and the explanandum\nthe formal cause and the explanandum the final cause (Fetzer 2000a:\n113\u2013114). There were important differences in their conceptions\nof law. Aristotle\u2019s general premises were definitional,\nnecessarily, whereas Hempel\u2019s were not. The following figure\nshows the parallel.\n\n\n\n\nThe Material Cause:\nThe Covering Law(s)\n\u00a0 \n\nThe Efficient Cause:\nThe Initial Conditions\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n\u00a0\nThe Formal Cause \n\nThe Final Cause:\nThe Explanandum  \n\n\n\nFigure 3. Hempelian Explanation in\nAristotelian Perspective\n\n\nIn the above figure, the use of the dotted line is meant to convey\nthat the analogy applies equally to deductive arguments (which would\nbe represented by a solid line) and inductive arguments (which would\nbe represented by a double line with a probability value\nattached).\n4.1 The Semi-Formal Explication\n\nFor Aristotle, the general premises of scientific explanations are\ngeneralizations that describe commensurately universal\nproperties of things of a subject kind, \\(K\\). Merely\nuniversal properties are ones that everything of kind \\(K\\)\nhas but could be without and remain a thing of that\nkind, just as every Honda might have Michelin tires. Aristotle\nreferred to such properties as \u201caccidental\u201d.\nCommensurately universal properties are ones that belong to everything\nof the kind as necessary attributes that they cannot be without. A\ntriangle, for example, has three lines and angles. Aristotle referred\nto them as \u201cessential\u201d. Because generalizations about the\nessential properties of things of a kind are \u201cproper\ndefinitions\u201d, they provide the basis for explanations that\nqualify as analytic. Hempel encompassed analytic generalizations\nwithin the scope of \u201cfundamental laws\u201d as defined in\nHempel and Oppenheim (1948), but he focused on those that were\nsynthetic.\n\nAnalytic explanations are common in the currents of daily life,\nespecially in the context of explaining how you \u201cknow\nthat\u201d something is the case. A mother might explain to her\nsingle daughter that she knows that John must be unmarried, because a\nfriend told her that John is a bachelor. Similar cases of analytic\nexplanations can occur in scientific contexts, such as knowing that\nthe element they are dealing with is gold because it has atomic number\n79, when gold is defined by its atomic number. Knowing why John is a\nbachelor, however, is another matter. Indeed, in Hempel (1965c), he\nwould distinguish between reason-seeking why-questions and\nexplanation-seeking why-questions, where the former seek\nreasons that justify believing that something is the case, as opposed\nto the latter, which are usually motivated by knowledge that a\nspecific event has occurred.\n\nIn his semi-formal explication of the requirements for adequate\nscientific explanations, Hempel specified four conditions of adequacy\n(CA) that have to be satisfied, namely:\n\n(CA-1)\nThe explanandum must be a deductive consequence of the explanans;\n\n(CA-2)\nThe explanans must contain general laws, which are required to\nsatisfy (CA-1);\n(CA-3)\nThe explanans must have empirical content and must be capable of\ntest; and, \n(CA-4)\nThe sentences of the explanans must be true. (Hempel &\nOppenheim 1948)\n\n\nThese conditions are intended to serve as requirements whose\nsatisfaction guarantees that a proposed explanation is adequate.\nHempel drew several distinctions over time between potential\nscientific explanations (which satisfy the first three conditions, but\npossibly not the fourth) and confirmed scientific\nexplanations (which are believed to be true but might turn out to be\nfalse). Hempel recognized that (CA-3) was a redundant condition, since\nit would have to be satisfied by any explanation that satisfied (CA-1)\nand (CA-2). Insofar as the explanandum describes an event that\noccurred during the history of the world, its derivation thereby\nimplies the explanans has empirical content.\n4.2 Ontic vs. Epistemic Conceptions\n\nHempel\u2019s conditions had many virtues, not least of which was\nthat they appeared to fit many familiar examples of scientific\nexplanations, such as explaining why a coin expanded when it was\nheated by invoking the law that copper expands when heated and noting\nthat the coin was copper. Hempel doesn\u2019t specify the form laws\nmay take, which could be simple or complex. Most of his examples were\nsimple, such as \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d, \u201cAll gold is\nmalleable\u201d, and so on. Others were quantitative, such as\nArchimedes\u2019 principle (A body totally immersed in a\nfluid\u2014a liquid or a gas\u2014experiences an apparent loss in\nweight equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces), Snell\u2019s\nlaw (During refraction of light, the ratio of the sines of the angles\nof incidence and of refraction is a constant equal to the refractive\nindex of the medium), and Newton\u2019s law of gravitation (Any two\nbodies attract each other with a force proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance\nbetween them), which he discussed.\n\nMore complicated examples can be found in standard sources, such as\nThe Feynman Lectures on Physics (Feynman et al.\n1963\u201365), the first volume of which is devoted to mechanics,\nradiation, and heat; the second, to electromagnetism and matter; and\nthe third, to quantum mechanics. Hempel explored the implications of\n (CA-4)\n for laws:\n\n\nThe requirement of truth for laws has the consequence that a given\nempirical statement \\(S\\) can never be definitely\nknown to be a law; for the sentence affirming the truth of \\(S\\)\nis tantamount to \\(S\\) and is\ntherefore capable only of acquiring a more or less high probability,\nor degree of confirmation, relative to the experimental evidence\navailable at any given time (Hempel and Oppenheim 1948: note 22,\nitalics added).\n\n\nHempel considered weakening condition\n (CA-4)\n to one of high confirmation instead of truth, but concluded that it\nwould be awkward to have \u201cadequate explanations\u201d that are\nlater superseded by different \u201cadequate\nexplanations\u201d with the acquisition of additional evidence and\nalternative hypotheses across time. He therefore retained the\ncondition of truth. Whether or not the conditions of explanatory\nadequacy should be relative to an epistemic context of confirmation\nrather than to an ontic context of truth would become an important\nquestion in coping with the requirements for probabilistic\nexplanations.\n\nNo aspect of Hempel\u2019s position generated more controversy than\nthe symmetry thesis, which holds that, for any adequate\nexplanation, had its premises\u2014its initial conditions and\ncovering laws\u2014been taken into account at a suitable prior time,\nthen a deductive prediction of the occurrence of the explanandum event\nwould have been possible, and conversely (Hempel & Oppenheim\n1948). Inferences from adequate explanations to potential predictions\nwere generally accepted, but not the converse. Critics, such as\nMichael Scriven (1962), advanced counter-examples that were based on\ncorrelations or \u201ccommon causes\u201d: the occurrence of a storm\nmight be predicted when cows lie down in their fields, for example,\nyet their behavior does not explain why the storm occurs. Sylvain\nBromberger offered the example of the length of the shadow cast by a\nflagpole, which is sufficient to deduce the height of the flagpole and\nthus satisfies Hempel\u2019s conditions but does not explain why the\nflagpole has that height (Bromberger 1966). Since logical relations\nare non-temporal, Hempel may have taken the symmetry thesis to be a\ntrivial consequence of his account, but deeper issues are involved\nhere.\n4.3 The Problem of Lawlikeness\n\nHempel observed that universal generalizations of the form,\n\u201c\\((x)(Fx \\supset\\) Gx)\u201d, are true if and only if\nlogically equivalent generalizations of the form, \u201c\\((x)(\\neg Fx\n\\vee Gx)\\)\u201d, are true. But if \u201c\\(Fx\\)\u201d stands for\nan uninstantiated property, such as being a vampire, then,\nsince \u201c\\(\\neg Fx\\)\u201d is satisfied by everything, regardless\nof the attribute \u201c\\(Gx\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(\\neg Gx\\)\u201d,\netc., that hypothesis\u2014and its logical equivalents\u2014are not\nonly universally confirmed but even qualify as \u201claws\u201d.\nThis is not surprising, from a logical point of view, since\nextensional logic is purely truth functional, where the truth value of\nmolecular sentences is a function of the truth values of its atomic\nconstituents. But it implies that an empirical generalization that\nmight be true of the world\u2019s history may or may not be\n\u201clawful\u201d, since it could be the case that its truth was\nmerely \u201caccidental\u201d. Hempel\u2019s endorsement of\nGoodman\u2019s approach to select generalizations that support\nsubjunctive conditionals, therefore, was not only consistent with the\ntradition of Hume\u2014who believed that attributions of natural\nnecessity in causal relations are merely \u201chabits of mind\u201d,\npsychologically irresistible, perhaps, but logically\nunwarranted\u2014but circumvented a disconcerting consequence of his\nexplication.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between sentences that\n\u201csupport subjunctives\u201d and those that \u201centail\nsubjunctives\u201d, when the selection of those that support\nsubjunctives is made on pragmatic grounds. Popper captured the crucial\ndifference between material (extensional) generalizations and\nsubjunctive (intensional) generalizations as follows:\n\n\nA statement may be said to be naturally or physically\nnecessary if, and only if, it is deducible from a statement\nfunction which is satisfied in all worlds that differ from our own, if\nat all, only with respect to initial conditions. (Popper 1965:\n433)\n\n\nIndeed, the existence of irreducibly ontic probabilistic phenomena,\nwhere more than one outcome is possible under the same initial\nconditions, would mean that the history of an indeterministic world\nmight be identical with the history of a deterministic one, where\ntheir differences were concealed \u201cby chance\u201d. Even a\ncomplete description of the history of the actual world might not\nsuffice to distinguish between them, where fundamental aspects of\ntheir causal structure would remain beyond empirical detection.\n\nThe difference between Popper\u2019s universal predicates and\nGoodman\u2019s paradoxical ones may derive from the consideration\nthat incorporating specific times into his definitions entails\nreference to specific moments of time \\(t\\), such as\nmidnight tonight, during the history of the actual world, a\npoint to which we are going to return. It follows that they cannot be\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in Popper\u2019s sense and do not even\nqualify as \u201cpurely qualitative\u201d in Hempel\u2019s, either.\nReliance upon material conditionals within first-order symbolic logic,\nmoreover, forfeits the benefits of synthetic subjunctives. If the\nhypothesis, \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d, is more adequately\nformalized as a subjunctive of the form, \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\rightarrow\nBx)\\)\u201d, where the truth of a subjunctive hypothetically assumes\nthat its antecedent condition is satisfied, that obviates the paradox:\nwhite shoes are not ravens, and Nicod\u2019s criteria apply Instances\nof \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(Bx\\)\u201d thereby confirm the\nhypothesis; instances of \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\neg\nBx\\)\u201d disconfirm it; and instances of \u201c\\(\\neg Rx\\)\u201d\nare epistemically neutral, precisely as Nicod said.\n5. Explanation, Prediction, Retrodiction\n\nHempel\u2019s critics\u2014both early and late\u2014have not always\nshown an appreciation for the full dimensions of his explication.\nMichael Scriven (1959), for example, once objected to \u201cthe\ndeductive model, with its syllogistic form, where no student of\nelementary logic could fail to complete the inference, given the\npremise\u201d (1959: 462), when no restriction is placed on the\ncomplexity of the relevant laws or the intricacy of these deductions\n(Hempel 1965c: 339). Similar objections have been lodged more recently\nby William Bechtel and Adele Abrahamsen (2005), for example, who\nclaim, in defense of \u201cthe mechanist alternative\u201d, that,\namong its many benefits,\n\n\ninvestigators are not limited to linguistic representations and\nlogical inference in presenting explanations but frequently employ\ndiagrams and reasoning about mechanisms by simulating them. (2005:\n421)\n\n\nHempel\u2019s conditions of adequacy, however, are capable of\nsatisfaction without their presentation as formal arguments.\n\nHempel remarks that his model of explanation does not directly apply\nto the wordless gesticulations of a Yugoslavian automobile mechanic or\nguarantee that explanations that are adequate are invariably\nsubjectively satisfying. His purpose was to formalize the conditions\nthat must be satisfied when an explanation is adequate without denying\nthat background knowledge and prior beliefs frequently make a\ndifference in ordinary conversational contexts. Jan might not know\nsome of the antecedent conditions, Jim might have misunderstood the\ngeneral laws, or features of the explanandum event may have been\nmissed by them both. Even when information is conveyed using diagrams\nand simulations, for example, as long as it satisfies conditions\n (CA-1)\n through\n (CA-4)\u2014no\n matter whether those conditions are satisfied implicitly or\nexplicitly\u2014an adequate scientific explanation is at hand. But it\nhas to satisfy all four of those requirements.\n\nDemonstrating that an adequate scientific explanation is at hand,\nhowever, imposes demands beyond the acquisition of information about\ninitial conditions and laws. In the examiner\u2019s sense of\nknowledge Ian Hacking identified (Hacking 1967: 319), to prove an\nadequate scientific explanation is available, it would be necessary to\nshow that each of Hempel\u2019s adequacy conditions has been\nsatisfied. It would not be enough to show, say, that one person is\nknowledgeable about the initial conditions, another about the covering\nlaws, and a third about the explanandum. It would be necessary to show\nthat the explanandum can be derived from the explanans, that those\nlaws were required for the derivation, and that the initial conditions\nwere those present on that occasion.\n (CA-1)\u2013(CA-4)\n qualifies as a \u201ccheck list\u201d to insure that a scientific\nexplanation is adequate.\n5.1 The Symmetry Thesis\n\nStudents of Hempel have found it very difficult to avoid the\nimpression that Hempel was not only defending the position that every\nadequate scientific explanation is potentially predictive but also the\nposition that every adequate scientific prediction is potentially\nexplanatory. This impression is powerfully reinforced in \u201cThe\nTheoretician\u2019s Dilemma\u201d (Hempel 1958), where, in the\ncourse of demonstrating that the function of theories goes beyond\nmerely establishing connections between observables, he offers this\npassage:\n\n\nScientific explanations, predictions, and postdictions all have the\nsame logical character: they show that the fact under consideration\ncan be inferred from certain other facts by means of specified general\nlaws. In the simplest case, the type of argument may be schematized as\na deductive inference of the following form [here substituting the\n\u201csimplest case\u201d for the abstract schemata presented in the\noriginal]:\n\n\n\n\n\\((x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\)\nExplanans \n\n\\(Rc\\)\n\n\n\\(Bc\\)\nExplanandum  \n\n\nFigure 4. A Covering-Law Explanation\n\n\n\u2026 While explanation, prediction, and postdiction are alike in\ntheir logical structure, they differ in certain other respects. For\nexample, an argument [like Figure 4 above] will qualify as a\nprediction only if [its explanandum] refers to an occurrence at a time\nlater than that at which the argument is offered; in the case of\npostdiction, the event must occur before the presentation of the\nargument. These differences, however, require no further study here,\nfor the purpose of the preceding discussion was simply to point out\nthe role of general laws in scientific explanation, prediction, and\npostdiction (Hempel 1958: 37\u201338).\n\n\nWhat is crucial about this passage is Hempel\u2019s emphasis on the\npragmatic consideration of the time at which the argument is\npresented in relation to the time of occurrence of the\nexplanandum event itself. Let us take this to be the observation\nthat \\(c\\) is black and assume that occurs at a\nspecific time \\(t_1\\). If the argument is presented prior to time\n\\(t_1\\) (before observing that \\(c\\) is black), then it\nis a prediction. If the argument is presented after time \\(t_1\\)\n(after observing that \\(c\\) is black), then it is a\npostdiction. Since explanations are usually advanced after the time of\nthe occurrence of the event to be explained, they usually occur as\npostdictions. But there is nothing about their form that requires\nthat.\n\nAs Hempel uses the term, reasoning is \u201cscientific\u201d when it\ninvolves inferences with laws. Indeed, this appears to be the\nprincipal ground upon which he wants to maintain that explanations,\npredictions, and postdictions share the same logical form. His\nposition here makes it logically impossible for explanations,\npredictions and postdictions to not have the same logical form. If\nthere are modes of prediction that are non-explanatory, such as might\nbe the case when they are based upon accidental generalizations, then\nthey would not thereby demonstrate that the symmetry thesis does not\nhold for the kinds of distinctively \u201cscientific\u201d\nexplanations that are the focus of his work. Scriven\u2019s cow\nexample, for example, does not show that the symmetry thesis does not\nhold for scientific explanations and scientific\npredictions, even if it shows that some ordinary predictions\nare not also ordinary explanations. But other\ncounter-examples posed greater threats.\n5.2 The Paradoxes of Explanation\n\nIndeed, in the process of drawing the distinction between\nexplanation-seeking and reason-seeking why-questions, Hempel (1965c)\nproposed a different kind of symmetry thesis, where adequate answers\nto explanation-seeking why-questions also provide adequate answers to\nreason-seeking why-questions, but not conversely. That was very\nappropriate, since the purpose of reason-seeking why-questions is to\nestablish grounds for believing that the event described by the\nexplanandum sentence has taken (or will take) place, while\nexplanation-seeking why-questions typically take for granted that we\nknow their explanandum events have already occurred. It follows that,\nwhile Hempel\u2019s conditions are meant to specify when we know\nwhy, they also entail how we know that.\n\nInsofar as Hempel focused on logically equivalent formulations of\nlawlike sentences in addressing the paradoxes of confirmation, some\nmay find it remarkable that he does not explore the consequences of\nlogically equivalent formulations in relation to explanations. We tend\nto assume we can explain why a specific thing \\(c\\) is\nblack on the grounds that it is a raven and all ravens are black. Yet\nwe would hesitate to explain why a specific thing is not a raven on\nthe ground that it is not black. We may refer to this as the\nparadox of transposition. Notice, the contention that one member\nof a class of logically equivalent hypotheses is explanatory but\nothers are not generates \u201cparadoxes of explanation\u201d that\nparallel the \u201cparadoxes of confirmation\u201d (Fetzer 2000a).\nFigure 5 offers an illustration:\n\\[ \\frac{\\begin{gathered} (x)(\\neg Bx \\supset \\neg Rx)\\\\ \\neg Bc\\end{gathered}}{\\neg Rc} \\]\n\n\nFigure 5. The Transposition Paradox\n\n\nEven if we accept the transposed form of \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset\nBx)\\)\u201d as the basis for an answer to a reason-seeking\nwhy-question\u2014in this case, how we know that\n\\(c\\) is no raven\u2014Figure 5 surely does not\nexplain why that is the case, which presumably has to do with\nthe genes of entity \\(c\\) and its developmental history\nas a living thing. If logically equivalent forms equally qualify as\nlawlike\u2014there\u2019s no basis in extensional logic to deny\nit\u2014then Hempel confronts a dilemma. In fact, by his own\nconditions of adequacy, this argument is not only explanatory but also\npredictive. It is not a \u201cpostdiction\u201d as he has\ndefined it above, but it appears to qualify as a\n\u201cretrodiction\u201d that does not explain its explanandum\nevent.\n\nSuppose Hempel were to resort to Goodman\u2019s approach and deny\nthat the negation of a purely qualitative predicates is also a purely\nqualitative predicate. That would mean that sentences logically\nequivalent to lawlike sentences\u2014which have the same\ncontent\u2014are not therefore also lawlike by invoking pragmatic\ndifferences in their degree of entrenchment and projectibility of\ntheir constituent predicates. An appeal to pragmatic considerations\nwithin this context has a decidedly ad hoc quality about it,\nwhich appears to contravene the spirit of the paradoxes of\nconfirmation, where Hempel insists that the counterintuitive cases are\nconfirmatory and their paradoxical character is merely psychological.\nEven if Hempel were to adopt this position and take for granted that\none member of a class of logically equivalent sentences can be lawlike\nwhile the others are not, another difficulty arises from the use of\nmodus tollens in lieu of modus ponens, as Figure 6\nexemplifies:\n\\[\\frac{\\begin{gathered} (x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\\\ \\neg Bc \\end{gathered}} {\\neg Rc} \\]\n\n\nFigure 6. The Modus Tollens Paradox\n\n\nHere we have a more threatening problem, since there is no apparent\nbasis for denying that an argument having this form satisfies\nHempel\u2019s criteria and therefore ought to be both explanatory\nand predictive. Similarly for temporally quantified arguments,\nwhere the fact that a match of kind \\(K\\) has not\nlighted at \\(t^*\\) would certainly not be adequate to explain why\nit was not struck at t, even though every match of kind \\(K\\)\nwill light when it is struck, under suitable\nconditions! Something serious thus appears to be wrong (Fetzer\n2000a).\n6. Inductive-Statistical Explanation\n\nIn his studies of inductive reasoning, Hempel (1960, 1962a, 1966b)\ndiscusses the ambiguity of induction, which arises because\nincompatible conclusions can appear to be equally-well supported by\ninductive arguments, where all the premises of both arguments are\ntrue. This problem has no analogue for deductive arguments:\ninconsistent conclusions cannot be validly derived from consistent\npremises, even if they are false. Inconsistent conclusions can receive\ninductive support from consistent premises, however, even when they\nare all true. Consider Hempel\u2019s illustration of conflicting\npredictions for a patient\u2019s recovery:\n\n(e1)\nJones, a patient with a sound heart, has just had an appendectomy,\nand of all persons with sound hearts who underwent appendectomy in the\npast decade, 93% had an uneventfully recovery.\n\n\nThis information, taken by itself, would surely lend strong support to\nthe hypothesis,\n\n(h1)\nJones will have an uneventful recovery. \n\n\nBut suppose that we also have the information:\n\n(e2)\nJones is an octogenarian with serious kidney failure; he just had\nan appendectomy after his appendix had ruptured; and in the past\ndecade, of all cases of appendectomy after rupture of the appendix\namong octogenarians with serious kidney failure, only 8% had an\nuneventful recovery.\n\n\nThis information by itself would lend strong support to the\ncontradictory of (h1):\n\n\\((\\neg\\)h1)\nJones will not have an uneventful recovery. (Hempel\n1966b) \n\n\nThus, Hempel observed, (e1) and (e2) are logically compatible and\ncould all be part of the evidence available when Jones\u2019\nprognosis is being considered. The solution Hempel endorsed was\nthe requirement of total evidence, according to which, in\nreasoning about the world, arguments must be based upon all the\navailable evidence, though he noted that evidence can be omitted when\nit is irrelevant and its omission does not affect the level of\nsupport. Here, when (e1) is combined with (e2), \\((\\neg\\)h1) is better\nsupported than (h1).\n6.1 The Requirement of Maximal Specificity\n\nHempel referred to statistical explanations as\n\u201cinductive-statistical\u201d in contrast with his prior\ndiscussion of \u201cdeductive-nomological\u201d explanations (Hempel\n1958). Because generalizations of both kinds are supposed to be\nlawlike, however, more appropriate names for them might have been\n\u201cuniversal-deductive\u201d and\n\u201cstatistical-inductive\u201d (or, perhaps,\n\u201cstatistical-probabilistic\u201d, respectively (Fetzer 1974).\nIn formalizing these arguments, Hempel symbolized statistical premises\nattributing a certain probability to outcome \\(G\\),\nunder conditions \\(F\\), by \u201c\\(P(G, F) =\nr\\)\u201d, where these explanations then assume this form:\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(G,F) = r\\) \n\n\\(Fc\\)\n\\([r]\\) \n\n\\(Gc\\)  \n\n\nFigure 7. An I-S Explanation Schema\n\n\nWhile Hempel initially interpreted the bracketed variable [\\(r\\)]\nas the measure of inductive support which the\nexplanans confers upon the explanandum, \\(Gi\\), (in conformity with\nthe requirement of total evidence)\u2014where the value of [\\(r\\)]\nequals that of \\(r\\)\u2014it\noccurred to him that, since inductive and deductive explanations are\ntypically offered on the basis of the knowledge that their explanandum\nevents have already occurred, viewing statistical explanations as\ninductive arguments whose purpose is to establish how we know that\nthey have occurred (or that they will occur) is not the correct\nperspective for understanding them:\n\n\nthe point of an explanation is not to provide evidence for the\noccurrence of the explanandum, but to exhibit it as nomically\nexpectable. And the probability attached to an I-S explanation is\nthe probability of the conclusion relative to the explanatory\npremises, not relative to the total class \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) [representing\nour total knowledge at that time]. (Hempel 1968, original\nemphasis)\n\n\nIn order to formalize this conception, he advanced the concept of\na maximally specific predicate related to \u201cGi\u201d in\n\\(\\mathbf{K},\\) where, when \u201c\\(P(G, F) = r\\)\u201d, then, if\nthe premises include a predicate stronger than \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d,\nsay, \u201c\\(M\\)\u201d, which implies the presence of more\nproperties than does \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d, then \\(P(G, M) = r,\\) where,\nas before, \\(r = P(G,F).\\) Thus additional predicates could be\nincluded in the explanans of an adequate scientific explanation,\nprovided that they made no difference to the nomic expectability of\nthe explanandum. Including the position of the moon or the day of the\nweek a match is struck, for example, might be irrelevant, but his\ncondition did not exclude them.  Wesley C. Salmon (1970), however,\nwould pursue this issue by arguing that Hempel had embraced the wrong\nstandard upon which to base explanatory relevance relations, where\nexplanations, in Salmon\u2019s view, strictly speaking, do not even\nqualify as arguments.\n6.2 Statistical Relevance vs. Causal Relevance\n\nSalmon offered a series of counterexamples to Hempel\u2019s approach.\nIn the case of I-S explanations, Hempel required that the nomic\nexpectability of the explanandum must be equal to or greater than .5,\nwhich preserved the symmetry thesis for explanations of this kind.\nThis implied that events with low probability could not be explained.\nThere were persuasive illustrations, moreover, demonstrating that\nexplanations could satisfy Hempel\u2019s criteria, yet not explain\nwhy their explanandum events occur. For example,\n\n(CE-1)\nJohn Jones was almost certain to recover from his cold within a\nweek, because he took vitamin C, and almost all colds clear up within\na week after administration of vitamin C. \n(CE-2)\nJohn Jones experienced significant remission of his neurotic\nsymptoms, for he underwent extensive psychoanalytic treatment and a\nsubstantial percentage of those who undergo psychoanalytic treatment\nexperience significant remission of neurotic symptoms. \n\n\nMost colds clear up within a week, with or without vitamin C, and\nsimilarly for neurotic symptoms. Salmon thought that this problem was\npeculiar to statistical explanations, but was corrected by Henry\nKyburg (1965), who offered examples of the following kind:\n\n(CE-3)\nThis sample of table salt dissolves in water, for it has had a\ndissolving spell cast upon it, and all samples of table salt that have\nhad dissolving spells cast upon them dissolve in water. \n(CE-4)\nJohn Jones avoided becoming pregnant during the past year, for he\nhas taken his wife\u2019s birth control pills regularly, and every\nman who regularly takes birth control pills avoids\npregnancy. \n\n\nFor Hempel, a property \\(F\\) is explanatorily\nrelevant to the occurrence of an outcome \\(G\\) if\nthere is a lawful relationship that relates \\(F\\) to\n\\(G\\). If table salt dissolves in water, so does\nMorton\u2019s table salt, Morton\u2019s finest table salt,\nMorton\u2019s finest table salt bought on sale, and so on. Salmon\nconcluded that Hempel\u2019s conception of I-S explanation was\nwrong.\n\nA student of Reichenbach (1938, 1949), Salmon had adopted and defended\nthe limiting frequency interpretation of physical probability, where\n\u201c\\(P(G/F) = r\\)\u201d means that \\(G\\) occurs\nwith a limiting frequency \\(r\\) in a reference class of\ninstances of \\(F\\), which has to be infinite for limits\nto exist (Salmon 1967, 1971). On this approach, a property \\(H\\)\nis explanatorily relevant to the occurrence\nof an attribute \\(G\\) within a reference class \\(F\\)\njust in case (SR):\n\n(SR)\n\\(P(G/F \\amp H) = m\\) and \\(P(G/F \\amp \\neg H) = n\\), where \\(m\n\\ne n\\);\n\n\nthat is, the limiting frequency for \\(G\\) in \\(F\\)-and-\\(H\\)\ndiffers from the limiting\nfrequency for \\(G\\) in \\(F\\)-and-not-\\(H\\).\nProperties whose presence does not make a difference\nto the limiting frequency for the occurrence of \\(G\\)\nin \\(F\\) would therefore qualify as statistically\nirrelevant. Relative frequencies were typically relied upon in\npractice, but in principle they had to be limiting.\n\nSalmon also rejected Hempel\u2019s requirement that the nomic\nexpectability of a statistical explanation must be equal to or greater\nthan .5, which led him to abandon the notion of explanations as\narguments. Even events of low probability were explainable within the\ncontext of Salmon\u2019s approach, which he compared with\nHempel\u2019s approach as follows:\n\n\nI-S model (Hempel): an explanation is an argument that\nrenders the explanandum highly probable;\n\nS-R model (Salmon): an explanation is an assembly of facts\nstatistically relevant to the explanandum regardless of the\ndegree of probability that results. (Salmon 1971, original\nemphasis)\n\n\nSalmon\u2019s work created a sensation, since Hempel\u2019s\ndominance of the philosophy of science, especially in relation to the\ntheory of explanation, now had a significant rival. The students of\nexplanation who recognized that probabilities as properties of\ninfinite classes posed substantial problems were few, and those who\nrealized that Salmon\u2019s position confronted difficulties of its\nown fewer still.\n\nSalmon was ingenious in devising \u201cscreening off\u201d criteria\nto insure that the properties cited in an S-R explanation were\nrestricted to those that were statistically relevant. He may have\nappreciated that the available evidence was restricted to relative\nfrequencies in finite sequences, but that could be discounted as\ntypical of the distinction between a context \\(\\mathbf{K}\\)\nrepresenting our total knowledge at that time and the truth condition,\nsince scientific knowledge is always tentative and fallible. A deeper\nproblem arose from the existence of properties that were statistically\nrelevant but not explanatorily relevant, however. If women whose\nmiddle initials began with vowels, for example, experienced\nmiscarriages with a different frequency than women whose middle\ninitials began with consonants\u2014even after other properties were\ntaken into account\u2014then that property would have to qualify as\nstatistically relevant and therefore explanatorily relevant\n(Fetzer 1974, 1981). This result implied that statistical relevance\ncannot adequately define explanatory relevance, and Salmon would\ngradually move toward the propensity approach in Salmon (1980,\n1989).\n6.3 Revising Hempel\u2019s Criteria of Adequacy\n\nThe advantage of propensities over frequencies are considerable,\nsince, on the propensity account, a probabilistic law no longer simply\naffirms that a certain percentage of the reference class belongs to\nthe attribute class. What it asserts instead is that every member of\nthe reference class possesses a certain disposition, which in the case\nof statistical laws is of probabilistic strength and in the case of\nuniversal laws of universal strength. On its single-case formulation,\nmoreover, short runs and long runs are simply finite and infinite\nsequences of single cases, where each trial has propensities that are\nequal and independent from trial to trial and classic theorems of\nstatistical inference apply.\n\nEven this intensional explication would still be vulnerable to the\nproblems of irrelevant properties and the modus tollens\nparadox but for the adoption of a condition to exclude the occurrence\nof predicates that are not nomically relevant to the explanandum event\nfrom the explanans of an adequate scientific explanation. This\ncriterion, known as the requirement of strict maximal\nspecificity, permits the reformulation of Hempel\u2019s four\nconditions of adequacy by replacing the redundant empirical content\ncondition with this new requirement (Fetzer 1981; Salmon 1989).\nExplanations not only display the nomic expectability of\ntheir explanandum events\u2014which, in the case of those that occur\nwith high probability, would enable them to have been predicted, as\nHempel proposed but\u2014more importantly\u2014explain them by\nspecifying all and only those properties nomically\nresponsible for their occurrence, even when they occur with low\nprobability (Fetzer 1992).\n\nBromberger\u2019s flagpole counterexample provides a severe test of\nthis requirement. The reason why the inference from the length of the\nshadow to the height of the flagpole is non-explanatory is because the\nlength of the shadow is not nomically responsible for the\nflagpole\u2019s height. Hempel\u2019s original conditions could not\ncope with situations of this kind, where inferences using laws support\npredictions and retrodictions that are not also explanations, even\nthough they satisfy all four. This alternative condition thus requires\nthat the properties cited in the antecedent of the lawlike premise(s)\nmust be nomically relevant to the explanandum or may not be included\nthere (Fetzer 1981, 1992). The height of the flagpole, but not the\nlength of the shadow, qualifies as nomically relevant, which resolves\nthe quandary\u2014at the expense of acknowledging classes of\narguments that are predictive or retrodictive but not\nexplanatory, even when they involve inferences from law(s) that\nsatisfy Hempel\u2019s original criteria. The reformulated conditions\nare:\n\n(CA-1*)\nThe explanandum must be a suitable logical consequence of the\nexplanans; \n(CA-2)\nThe explanans must contain general laws, which are required to\nsatisfy (CA-1*);\n(CA-3*)\nThe explanans must satisfy the requirement of strict maximal\nspecificity; and,\n(CA-4*)\nThe sentences\u2014both of the explanans and of the\nexplanandum\u2014must be true.\n\n\nBy formulating (CA-1*) in this way, the covering law conception of the\nsubsumption of singular events by general laws is preserved; but\nabandonment of the high-probability requirement led both Salmon (1971)\nand Alberto Coffa (1973) to question whether or not explanations still\nproperly qualify as \u201carguments\u201d. At the least, however,\nthey would appear to be special kinds of \u201cexplanatory\narguments\u201d, even when they involve low probabilities.\n\nThese revised conditions implicitly require abandoning Hempel\u2019s\ncommitment to extensional methodology to capture the notion of nomic\nresponsibility, but the benefits of an intensional approach appear to\nbe profound. As Salmon has observed,\n\n\n[on such an explication] the distinction between description and\nprediction, on the one hand, and explanation, on the\nother, is that the former can proceed in an extensional language\nframework, while the latter demands an intensional language framework.\nIt remains to be seen whether the intensional logic can be\nsatisfactorily formulated (Salmon 1989: 172, original emphasis).\n\n\nThis approach to explanation incorporates the causal relevance\ncriterion, according to which a property \\(H\\) is\ncausally relevant to the occurrence of an attribute \\(G\\)\nrelative to a reference property \\(F\\)\u2014within\nthe context of a causal\nexplanation\u2014just in case (CR):\n\n(CR)\n\\((Fxt \\amp Hxt) =m \\Rightarrow Gxt*\\) and \\((Fxt \\amp \\neg Hxt) =n\n\\Rightarrow Gxt*\\), where \\(m \\ne n\\);\n\n\nthat is, the propensity for \\(G\\), given \\(F \\amp H\\), differs from\nthe propensity for \\(G\\), given \\(F \\amp \\neg H\\), where the presence\nor absence of \\(H\\) affects the single-case causal tendency for\n\\(G\\). The universal generalization of sentential functions like these\nthus produces lawlike sentences, while their instantiation to\nindividual constants or to ambiguous names produces (what are known\nas) nomological conditionals (Fetzer 1981: 49\u201354). The\nintroduction of the probabilistic causal calculus \\(C\\), moreover,\nresponds to Salmon\u2019s concerns by providing a formalization\nwithin intensional logic that resolves them (Fetzer & Nute 1979,\n1980). Paul Humphreys (1985, 1989) has argued that \u201cpropensities\ncannot be probabilities\u201d because their causal\ndirectedness precludes satisfying symmetry conditions requiring\nprobabilities from effects to causes as well as from causes to effects\n(on the plausible assumption that there are no propensities for\neffects to bring about their causes). A more linguistically precise\ncharacterization would be that propensities cannot be \u2018standard\nprobabilities\u2019, which has no effect on their role in explanatory\ncontexts.\n7. The Problem of Provisos\n\nWhat may come as some surprise is that Hempel exposed yet another\nsignificant problem confronting the theory of scientific explanation.\nOne of the most remarkable features of his career is that he continued\nto publish original and innovative studies well into his eightieth\ndecade. Rather surprisingly, he authored a series of articles that\nmoved away from the influential conception of scientific theories as\nformal calculi combined with empirical\ninterpretations that had been characteristic of logical\nempiricism. In Hempel (1966a), at the time, the most widely adopted\nintroduction to the philosophy of science (which has been translated\ninto ten other languages), he advanced the novel explication of\nscientific theories as consisting of internal principles and\nbridge principles, where the lawlike hypotheses that\ndistinguish theories are linked to observation, measurement, and\nexperiment by principles expressed in various mixtures of ordinary and\nof technical language. Now antecedent understanding replaces explicit\ndefinability, which seems to have been, in part, a response to the\ndemise of the observational/theoretical distinction.\n\nEven more strikingly, Hempel (1988a,b) observed that the application\nof scientific theories presupposes the absence of factors that might\naffect the internal principles of the theory, which goes beyond the\ncontent of the theory itself. Deriving predictions and explanations\nfrom classical mechanics presupposes that bodies are being acted upon\nexclusively by gravitational forces, for example, where the presence\nof electromagnetic forces would invalidate those derivations. This is\nnot simply a matter of conducting tests \u201cunder suitable\nconditions\u201d, where the malleability of gold differs when struck\nby a hammer when at extremely cold temperatures (where the\ncombustibility of paper differs when the paper is wet, and so on),\nwhich are familiar examples of the various specific conditions that\nmust be identified in complete definitions of dispositional\npredicates. What Hempel noticed is that these properties may not only\nbe affected by conditions covered by the theory being applied but\ninvolve entirely different theories. He took this to mean that the\napplication of theories has to be accompanied by\n\u201cprovisos\u201d affirming that no properties beyond those\nspecified by the theory are present in a specific case.\n\nThe function of these provisos means that instrumentalist\nconstructions of scientific theories as mere calculating devices and\nprograms for the elimination of theoretical language by reduction to\nobservational language alone are misguided and cannot be sustained.\nAnd this is because, if other theoretical properties make a difference\nto the application of a particular theory, then the observational\nconsequences of that theory cannot be assumed to obtain in any\ninstance without provisos about other theoretical properties beyond\nthose specified by the theory, which requires separate investigation\non the basis of observation, measurement, and experiment. The\nconditions for testing, confirming or falsifying alternative\nhypotheses and theories is thereby rendered vastly more complex than\nhad previously been supposed. Strikingly, as an essential element of\nan adequate explanation, Coffa (1973) had advanced \u201cextremal\nclauses\u201d that assert that no factors other than those specified\nby the initial conditions of the explanans are relevant to the\noccurrence of the explanandum event. Indeed, Salmon points out that,\nsince the application of every law involves a tacit extremal (or\n\u201cceteris paribus\u201d) clause, any law can be protected from\nrefutation by discounting disconfirming evidence on the expedient of\nclaiming that, because the clause was not satisfied, the law is still\ncorrect, which is another way to accent the source of Hempel\u2019s\nconcern (Salmon 1989: 84\u201385).\n\nThese observations are related to the claim that \u201cthe laws of\nphysics lie\u201d, which has been suggested by Nancy Cartwright\n(1983). She has claimed that there are theoretical laws, which are\nsupposed to be \u201csimple\u201d but rarely if ever instantiated,\nand phenomenological laws, which are frequently instantiated but\ntypically if not always complex. Armstrong (1983: 137\u2013140) draws\na distinction between laws that are \u201ciron\u201d and have no\nexceptions and those that are \u201coaken\u201d and have no\nexceptions as long as no interfering conditions are present.\nIn his language, unless Cartwright has overlooked the possibility that\nsome laws might be both complex and true, she seems to be saying that\ntheoretical laws are \u201coaken\u201d laws for which there are no\n\u201ciron\u201d counterparts. If that is right, then she has failed\nto appreciate the distinction between counterfactual conditionals\n(which may be true in spite of having no instances) and mere\nindicative conditionals (which may be true because they have\nno instances). The \u201cprovisos\u201d problem implies that\nsatisfying the requirement of maximal specificity may be more\ndemanding than has been generally understood in the past. Either way,\nCartwright\u2019s theses appear to trade on an equivocation between\nthe non-existence of \u201ciron\u201d counterparts and their\nnon-availability: even if the \u201ciron\u201d laws within a domain\nare not yet known, it does not follow that those laws do not\nexist.\n8. Reflections on Rationality\n\nThe publication of Thomas S. Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions (1962), ironically, was among the\nhistorical developments that contributed to a loss of confidence in\nscience. Kuhn\u2019s work, which turned \u201cparadigm\u201d into a\nhousehold word, was widely regarded as assimilating revolutions in\nscience to revolutions in politics, where one theory succeeds another\nonly upon the death of its adherents. It was interpreted as having\ndestroyed the myth that philosophers possess some special kind of\nwisdom or insight in relation to the nature of science or the thought\nprocesses of scientists with respect to their rationality, almost as\nthough every opinion were on a par with every other. A close reading\nof Kuhn\u2019s work shows that these were not his own conclusions,\nbut they were enormously influential. And among the public at large\nand many social scientists, the tendency to no longer hold science in\nhigh esteem or to be affected by its findings has induced political\nramifications that are inimical to the general good. When our beliefs\nare not well founded, actions we base upon them are unlikely to\nsucceed, often with unforeseen effects that are harmful. Rational\nactions ought to be based upon rational beliefs, where science has\nproven to be the most reliable method for acquiring knowledge about\nourselves and the world around us.\n\nThis study supports the conclusion that Hempel\u2019s conception of\nscientific explanations as involving the subsumption of singular\nevents by means of covering laws was well-founded, even though his\ncommitment to an extensional methodology inhibited him from embracing\na more adequate account of natural laws. The symmetry thesis turns out\nto require qualification, not only with respect to predictions for\nevents that occur only with low probability, but also for\nretrodictions derived by modus tollens. The link that most\naccurately embodies the relationship between Hempel\u2019s work on\nexplanation and decision-and-inference, as we have seen, appears to be\nreflected by the Principal Principle, which formalizes the\nrecognition that subjective (or personal) probabilities, as degrees of\nbelief, should have the same values as corresponding objective\nprobabilities, when they are known. The values of propensities as\nproperties of laws, no doubt, should be given precedence over the\nvalues of frequencies, insofar as laws, unlike frequencies, cannot be\nviolated and cannot be changed and thus provide the more reliable\nguide.\n\nA recent trend presumes that the philosophy of science has been\nmisconceived and requires \u201ca naturalistic turn\u201d as a kind\nof science of science more akin to history or to sociology than to\nphilosophy. In studies published in the twilight of his career, Hempel\ndemonstrated that, without standards to separate science from\npseudo-science, it would be impossible to distinguish frauds,\ncharlatans, and quacks from the real thing (Hempel 1979, 1983).\nWithout knowing \u201cthe standards of science\u201d, we would not\nknow which of those who call themselves \u201cscientists\u201d are\nscientists and which methods are \u201cscientific\u201d, where the\nplace of explanation remains central within the context of inference\nto the best explanation (Fetzer 2002). The philosophy of science,\ntherefore, cannot be displaced by history or by sociology. Not least\namong the important lessons of Hempel\u2019s enduring legacy is the\nrealization that the standards of science cannot be derived from mere\ndescriptions of its practice alone but require rational justification\nin the form of explications satisfying the highest standards of\nphilosophical rigor.",
