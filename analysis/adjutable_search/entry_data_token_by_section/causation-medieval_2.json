    "main_text": "Causality and Motion || Local Motion\n1.2 Local Motion\n\nNow if we throw a body, then it is, in this framework, relatively\nunproblematic to account for the motion when it is in contact with our\nhand: what is difficult is to account for its continued motion\nthereafter.  Aristotle\u2019s theory accounts for it by saying that,\nwhen it is moving, a temporary vacuum is caused behind it, and, in\norder to fill in this vacuum, air rushes around from the front, thus\nleaving a void in front of the projectile which is filled by the\ncontinued motion of the projectile. This explanation was vulnerable to\na large number of objections \u2013 for example, it is clearly easier\nto throw a moderately heavy object, such as a stone, than a light\nobject, such as a bean, whereas light objects ought to be more\nsusceptible than others to motions of the air. And Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory, when confronted with the example of two stones thrown in\nopposite directions so as to pass near to one another, cannot\nconsistently say how the air is supposed to move in the neighbourhood\nof their close encounter. These objections were made by numerous\nmedieval authors, most significantly by John Buridan (De Caelo et\nMundo III, qu. 22, pp. 227ff.) and Nicole Oresme (Du ciel et\ndu monde II, ch. 25ff., pp. 525ff.).\n\nThis critique of Aristotle\u2019s theory of projectile motion did not\ncome out of nowhere. Aristotle relied on a concept of natural motion,\nand that, in turn, relied on a concept of natural place:\nnatural motion was motion towards the natural place of a body (i.e.\nmotion downwards in the case of earth, and motion upwards in the case\nof fire). (Aristotle, Physics IV.5, 212b30\u2013213a5) Ockham is\nalready quite equivocal about the concept of natural place: and this is\nfor several reasons.\n\nOne is that \u2013 as we shall see later \u2013 he is generally quite\nsuspicious about teleology, and the concept of natural place is\nbasically a teleological one. Correspondingly, Ockham attempts \u2013 not\nvery successfully \u2013 to explain the kinematics associated with natural\nplace in terms of efficient causality. (Ockham, Expositio\nPhysicorum IV, c6: Opera Philosophica V, p. 78; Goddu\n1984, pp. 122ff.).\nAnother reason is because of several examples which tend to\nundermine the difference between rest and motion. Ockham, and many\nother medievals, have reductionist accounts of place in terms of\ncontact between bodies; the place of a body is just the surfaces of the\nbodies surrounding it (Ockham, Expositio Physicorum IV, c6:\nOpera Philosophica V, pp. 55ff.). So, if we have a ship in a\nriver, which is flowing, is the place of the ship the surface of the\nsurrounding water? Is this, then, a moving place? And what, then, would\nbe the relation between that moving place and fixed places? Ockham\neventually decides that there are only fixed places, but his arguments\nare not very strong, and one is left with the impression that the very\nideas of rest and motion have become somewhat problematic. (Ockham,\nExpositio Physicorum IV, c7: Opera Philosophica V,\npp. 79ff.; cf. Goddu 1999)\nThe final reason is motivated by a theological example: we can\nsuppose that God could create another world than this, but, in that\ncase, what would the earth of that world do? Would it move towards the\ncentre of this world (which seems to us to be the natural\nplace of earth)? Or towards the centre of the other world? (Ockham, I\nSent., d. 44: Opera Theologica IV, pp. 655\u201356; Goddu\n1984, p. 124. See also Marsilius of Inghen, Si essent plures\nmundi (1992).)\n\n\n\nCorrespondingly, both Buridan and Oresme are sceptical, not only\nabout Aristotle\u2019s theory of projectile motion, but also about the\nrelated notions of natural place, motion, and rest. They both state \u2013\nOresme far more emphatically \u2013 that it would be consistent with all we\nobserve if the earth were to rotate while the heavens remained at rest;\nOresme and Buridan have, on these grounds, been described as\n\u201cprecursors of Galileo\u201d.\n\n\nHowever, what is more interesting for us are the alternative causal\naccounts that Buridan and Oresme adopted: they both said that\nprojectiles move violently because of a form inherent in them, which\nled them to move in a non-natural direction, and which naturally\ndecayed. This form was known as \u2018impetus\u2019, and was a common\ntheme in the philosophy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;\nsome version of an impetus theory goes back to the early thirteenth\ncentury (Wood 1992). There was, especially in the fourteenth century, a\nconsiderable amount of quantitative work on impetus which attempted to\nestablish such things as the law according to which impetus decayed\n(Weisheipl 1982, pp. 535ff.).\n\n\nWhat is significant here is that \u2013 despite the radical changes\nin cosmology \u2013 this is is still an extremely medieval\ntheory: causation is due to forms inhering in substances, and there is\na division of the substances involved into agents and\npatients. Instead of there being a single form involved in projectile\nmotion \u2013 the form of heaviness, responsible for natural motion\ndownwards \u2013 there are two, weight and impetus, and the two\nconflict. The basic ontology is still the same, and the division into\nagents and patients, though its details may have changed, still\npersists. Furthermore, despite persistent doubts, there is still\nsomething of a distinction between motion and rest, and motion can\nonly be the result of agency. Contrast this with Galileo\u2019s or\n\u2013 still more \u2013 Newton\u2019s account: here uniform motion\nand rest are treated on an equal footing, and, consequently, there can\nbe no unequivocal distinction between motion and rest. So, although\nBuridan and Oresme are \u2013 in some sense \u2013 precursors of\nGalileo, their causal ontology is still, in important respects,\nthoroughly medieval (Maier 1964).\n",
