    "main_text": "The Use of Religious Language || Praise and Prayer\n3.2 Praise and Prayer\n\nAlthough some caution is needed in placing work in continental\nphilosophy into the analytic classifications that inform this article,\nthe treatment of religious language by Jean-Luc Marion (1994, 1982\n[1995]) and Jacques Derrida (1992) appears sympathetic to the speech act\ntheories considered in this section. Speakers, according to Marion, in\nuttering indicative sentences about God praise God (and thereby\nexpress devotion, awe, and so on, towards God) rather than express\nbeliefs about God. Derrida is critical of Marion; not, however,\nbecause he endorses a face value approach but because he believes\nspeakers are better understood as voicing prayers to God rather than\npraise.\n\nMarion\u2019s theory is influenced by the apophatic idea that God\ncannot be accurately conceived of. Conceiving of something, according\nto Marion, involves placing some descriptive limitation or restriction\non that thing. God and other religious subjects, Marion claims, are\n\u201csaturated phenomena\u201d that cannot be captured by human\nconcepts: \n\n\nThat he is the given par excellence implies that \u201cGod\u201d is\ngiven without restriction, without reserve, without restraint.\n\u201cGod\u201d is given not at all partially, following this or\nthat outline \u2026 but absolutely, without the reserve of any\noutline, with every side open \u2026 (1994: 588) \n\n\nHowever, inspired by Dionysius\u2019 writings, he presents an\ninterpretation of religious discourse as referring to God without\nascribing properties to God. For example, \u201cGod is good\u201d\naddresses rather than describes God (1982 [1995, 76]). Marion calls\nthis non-objectifying and non-predicative way of talking about God\n\u201cpraise\u201d; it is a form of speech that is laudatory but\ncombined with a recognition (at least by the speaker) that the\nproperty that is apparently predicated of God is inappropriate. Praise\n\u201cfeeds on the impossibility or, better, the impropriety of the\ncategory\u201d (1982 [1995, 76]). In talking of God, therefore,\nspeakers praise God but recognise the inadequacy of the concepts they\nare using to represent God: the predicate expressions are not used\nwith the belief that they accurately represent God. In saying\n\u201cGod is good\u201d speakers do not, therefore, believe or\nassert that God is good. For further discussion see James\nSmith 2002.\n\nDerrida is sympathetic to Marion\u2019s account but raises the\nobjection that praising God (the \u201cencomium\u201d of God), on\nMarion\u2019s account, still involves predication: \n\n\nEven if it is not a predicative affirmation of the current type, the\nencomium preserves the style and the structure of a predicative\naffirmation. It says something about someone \u2026 [Praise] entails\na predicative aim, however foreign it may be to \u201cnormal\u201d\nontological predication. (1992: 137) \n\n\nDerrida proposes instead that religious talk about God should be\nunderstood as prayer rather than praise. Unlike praise, prayer is a\nform of address that, Derrida argues, is entirely non-descriptive.\nPrayer \u201cis not predicative, theoretical (theological),\nor constative\u201d (1992: 110). He elaborates:\n\n\nI will hold to one other distinction: prayer in itself, one may say,\nimplies nothing other than the supplicating address to the other,\nperhaps beyond all supplication and giving, to give the promise of His\npresence as other, and finally the transcendence of His otherness\nitself, even without any other determination; the encomium, although\nit is not a simple attributive speech, nevertheless preserves an\nirreducible relationship to the attribution. (1982 [1995, 111])\n\n\nDerrida\u2019s objection is unconvincing. (12) and (13), for example,\nappear to have the same \u201cstyle and structure\u201d:\n\n(12) God is\ngood.\n(13)The table is\nround.\n\n\nHowever, Marion\u2019s point is presumably that the similarity of\n(12) and (13) is purely superficial. Marion does not give specifics,\nbut one way of developing his is account is to take (12) to be\ncommunicating (something like):\n\n(14)Oh, God you are\ngood!\n\n\nWhere (14) is understood as an expression of (say) the speaker\u2019s\nrespect and admiration of God and the speaker recognises the\ndescriptive inadequacy of \u201cgood\u201d. Derrida is, in effect,\nreading too much into the surface appearance of utterances: (12) and\n(13) may look similar but they are not thereby speech acts of the same\ntype.\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of Derrida\u2019s and Marion\u2019s\naccounts are as yet largely unexplored in analytic philosophy. There\nare, however, some obvious challenges that need to be addressed. For\nexample, Marion claims in praising God the predicates that are\nascribed to God are recognised as inadequate by speakers.\nThis seems implausible. Speakers in many cases appear to believe what\nthey are saying about God. Marion might argue that such religious\nbelievers have false beliefs about God\u2019s nature, but to\nclaim that they do not have beliefs about God\u2019s nature that they\nintend to communicate seems to be a misrepresentation of\nspeakers\u2019 states of mind. Moreover, Derrida\u2019s own\nsuggestion that talk of God should be understood as prayer does not\nseem to have any advantage over the position his is criticising.\nPrayer also involves utterances that appear to represent God:\n\u201cOur Father, which art in heaven\u201d, for instance.\n",
