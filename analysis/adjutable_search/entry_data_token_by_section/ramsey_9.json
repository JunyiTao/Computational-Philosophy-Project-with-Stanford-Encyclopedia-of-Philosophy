    "main_text": "Laws and Theories || Theories\n8. Contributions to Mathematics\n\nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though two ideas he\nintroduced in his more philosophical papers (1926a, 1929b), also led\neventually to new lines of mathematical research. Each of these three\ncontributions has proved seminal and they are now rightly associated\nwith his name.\n\nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n\u201cTruth and Probability\u201d (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio \n\\[\\bel(p)= \\frac{\\alpha- \\gamma}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\]\n\n\nwhen, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \n\\[ \\alpha \\text{ (for certain)} \\]\n\n\nand the option \n\\[ \\beta \\text{ if } p \\text{ is true, } \\gamma \\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \\]\n\n\nare equally preferable.\n\nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain belief)\n\u201cThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\)\nby the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being\nconducted in terms of differences of value as defined\u201d. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n\u201cold-established\u201d idea of measuring one\u2019s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate further\non this connection it is implicit in the derivations that follow that\nRamsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that for any option\n\\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative), \\(\\xi\\) for\ncertain is equivalent to: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\xi + \\text{receive } (1-x)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\xi + \\text{receive } -xt, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the\noptions: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{receive } (1-\\bel(p))t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\text{receive } {-}\\bel(p)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n\u201cdiminishing marginal utility\u201d.)\n\nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given\n\\(q\\), for which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a\nsubject\u2019s degrees of belief are consistent in the sense of\nobeying these Laws of Preference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply\nstates, do not allow a [Dutch] book to be made against him by which he\nwould lose in any event) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the\n\u201cfundamental laws of probable belief (degrees of belief between\n0 and 1)\u201d, which he gives as: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\bel(p) + \\bel(\\neg p) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p\\mid q) + \\bel(\\neg p\\mid q) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) = \\bel(q\\mid p) \\cdot \\bel(p), \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) + \\bel(p \\wedge \\neg q) = \\bel(p). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183):\n\n\nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you.\n\n\nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955).\n\nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey\u2019s\nwriting.\n\nUnaware of Ramsey\u2019s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject\u2019s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such\na subject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would\nlater become know as Kolmogorov\u2019s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone.\n\nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016.\n\nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical paper\nGeneral Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM] 247):\n\n\nIf two people are arguing \u2018If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?\u2019 and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\); so\nthat in a sense \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u2019 and \u2018If \\(p\\), not\n\\(q\\)\u2018 are contradictories.\n\n\nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such as\nif \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent\u2019s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\).\n\nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey\u2019s Test:\n\nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q \\in\nK*p\\)\n\nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as a\ntest of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely.\n\nNot surprisingly then Ramsey\u2019s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey\u2019s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with G\u00e4rdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey\u2019s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey\u2019s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to:\n\nRamsey Test (RT):\n\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K *\np\\)\n\nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\).\n\nRamsey\u2019s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities.\n\nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems, respectively.\nThey can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet\u2019s much earlier\nSchubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole Principle\n(1832).\n\nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform \n\\[\\exists z_1, \\ldots, z_m \\forall x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\, \\theta(z_1, \\ldots, z_m,x_1, \\ldots, x_n),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley\u2019s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977).\n\nThis result of Ramsey\u2019s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel (1928) and solves the prospective\nSpectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of the above\nform, now referred to as the Bernays-Sch\u00f6nfinkel-Ramsey Class.\nThat is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the class of\ncardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be satisfied.\nAs a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if a sentence\nin this class is satisfiable in some structure. However it\nseems clear from the accompanying discussion that Ramsey was aware\nthat there was also a direct and simple proof of this fact.\n\nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey\u2019s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to Hilbert\u2019s\nEntscheidungsproblem though it is possible that the aim he\nactually had in mind was the related Spectrum Problem. Hilbert\u2019s\ngoal was later shown to be not achievable by the undecidability\nresults of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently Alan Turing (1937).\nIn fact Ramsey\u2019s positive contribution turned out to be the best\npossible in the sense that decidability fails once the order of the\nblocks of existential and universal quantifiers is reversed, see\nKalm\u00e1r & Sur\u00e1nyi 1950, and Mortimer 1975.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erd\u0151s and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNe\u0161et\u0159il & R\u00f6dl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC.\n\nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell\u2019s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910\u20131913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.\n",
