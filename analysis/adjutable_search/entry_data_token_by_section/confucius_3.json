    "main_text": "Virtues and Character Formation\n4. Virtues and Character Formation\n\nMany of the short passages from the Analects, and the\n\u201cThicket of Sayings\u201d passages excavated at Guodian,\ndescribe the development of set of ideal behaviors associated with the\nmoral ideal of the \u201cway\u201d (dao \u9053) of the\n\u201cgentleman\u201d (junzi \u541b\u5b50). Based on\nthe analogy between the way of Confucius and character ethics systems\nderiving from Aristotle, these patterns of behavior are today often\ndescribed using the Latinate term \u201cvirtue\u201d. In the second\npassage in the\nAnalects, the disciple You Ruo \u6709\u82e5 says a person who behaves with\nfilial piety to parents and siblings (xiao and di \u5f1f),\nand who avoids going against superiors, will rarely disorder society.\nIt relates this correlation to a more general picture of how patterns\nof good behavior effectively open up the possibility of following the\nway of the gentleman: \u201cThe gentleman works at the roots. Once\nthe roots are established, the way comes to life\u201d (1.2). The way\nof the gentleman is a distillation of the exemplary behaviors of the\nselfless culture heroes of the past, and is available to all who are\nwilling to \u201cwork at the roots\u201d. In this way, the virtues\nthat Confucius taught were not original to him, but represented his\nadaptations of existing cultural ideals, to which he continually\nreturned in order to clarify their proper expressions in different\nsituations. Five behaviors of the gentleman most central to the\nAnalects are benevolence (ren \u4ec1), righteousness\n(yi \u7fa9), ritual propriety (li \u79ae), wisdom (zhi \u667a),\nand trustworthiness (xin \u4fe1).\n\nThe virtue of benevolence entails interacting with others guided by a\nsense of what is good from their perspectives. Sometimes the\nAnalects defines benevolence generally as \u201ccaring for\nothers\u201d (12.22), but in certain contexts it is associated with\nmore specific behaviors. Examples of contextual definitions of\nbenevolence include treating people on the street as important guests\nand common people as if they were attendants at a sacrifice (12.2),\nbeing reticent in speaking (12.3) and rejecting the use of clever\nspeech (1.3), and being respectful where one dwells, reverent where\none works, and loyal where one deals with others (13.19). It is the\nbroadest of the virtues, yet a gentleman would rather die than\ncompromise it (15.9). Benevolence entails a kind of unselfishness, or,\nas David Hall and Roger Ames suggest, it involves forming moral\njudgments from a combined perspective of self and others.\n\nLater writers developed accounts of the sources of benevolent\nbehavior, most famously in the context of the discussion of human\nnature (xing \u6027) in the centuries after\nConfucius. Mencius (fourth century BCE) argued that benevolence grows\nout of the cultivation of an affective disposition to compassion\n(ceyin \u60fb\u96b1) in the face of another\u2019s\ndistress. The anonymous author of the late Warring States period\nexcavated text \u201cFive Kinds of Action\u201d (Wu xing\n\u4e94\u884c) describes it as building from the affection one\nfeels for close family members, through successive stages to finally\ndevelop into a more universal, fully-fledged virtue.  In\nthe Analects, however, one comment on human nature\nemphasizes the importance of nurture: \u201cBy nature people are\nclose, by habituation they are miles apart\u201d (17.2), a sentiment\nthat suggests the importance of training one\u2019s dispositions\nthrough ritual and the classics in a manner closer to the program of Xunzi (third century\nBCE). The Analects, however, discusses the incubation of\nbenevolent behavior in family and ritual contexts. You Ruo winds up\nhis discussion of the roots of the way of the gentleman with the\nrhetorical question: \u201cIs not behaving with filial piety to\none\u2019s parents and siblings the root of benevolence?\u201d\n(1.2). Confucius tells his disciple Yan Yuan \u984f\u6df5 that\nbenevolence is a matter of \u201covercoming oneself and returning to\nritual propriety\u201d (12.1). These connections between benevolence\nand other virtues underscore the way in which benevolent behavior does\nnot entail creating novel social forms or relationships, but is\ngrounded in traditional familial and ritual networks.\n\nThe second virtue, righteousness, is often described in the Analects relative to\nsituations involving public responsibility. In contexts where\nstandards of fairness and integrity are valuable, such as acting as\nthe steward of an estate as some of the disciples of Confucius did,\nrighteousness is what keeps a person uncorrupted. Confucius wrote that\na gentleman \u201cthinks of righteousness when faced with gain\u201d\n(16.10, 19.10), or \u201cwhen faced with profit\u201d (14.12).\nConfucius says that one should ignore the wealth and rank one might\nattain by acting against righteousness, even if it means eating coarse\nrice, drinking water, and sleeping using one\u2019s bent arm as a\npillow (7.16). Later writers like Xunzi celebrated Confucius for his\nrighteousness in office, which he stressed was all the more impressive\nbecause Confucius was extremely poor (\u201cWangba\u201d\n\u738b\u9738). This behavior is particularly relevant in official\ninteractions with ordinary people, such as when \u201cemploying\ncommon people\u201d (5.16), and if a social superior has mastered it,\n\u201cthe common people will all comply\u201d (13.4). Like\nbenevolence, righteousness also entails unselfishness, but instead of\ncoming out of consideration for the needs of others, it is rooted in\nsteadfastness in the face of temptation.\n\nThe perspective needed to act in a righteous way is sometimes related\nto an attitude to personal profit that recalls the previous\nsection\u2019s discussion of how Confucius taught his disciples to\nrecalibrate their sense of value based on their immersion in the\nsacrificial system. More specifically, evaluating things based on\ntheir ritual significance can put one at odds with conventional\nhierarchies of value. This is defined as the root of righteous\nbehavior in a story from the late Warring States period text\nMaster Fei of Han (Han Feizi \u97d3\u975e\u5b50). The tale relates how\nat court, Confucius was given a plate with a peach and a pile of\nmillet grains with which to scrub the fruit clean. After the\nattendants laughed at Confucius for proceeding to eat the millet\nfirst, Confucius explained to them that in sacrifices to the Former Kings,\nmillet itself is the most valued offering. Therefore, cleaning a\nritually base peach with millet: \n\n\nwould be obstructing righteousness, and so I dared not put [the peach]\nabove what fills the vessels in the ancestral shrine.\n(\u201cWaichu shuo, zuo shang\u201d\n\u5916\u5132\u8aaa\u5de6\u4e0a) \n\n\nWhile such stories may have been told to mock his fastidiousness, for\nConfucius the essence of righteousness was internalizing a system of\nvalue that he would breach for neither convenience nor profit.\n\nAt times, the phrase \u201cbenevolence and righteousness\u201d is\nused metonymically for all the virtues, but in some later texts, a\nbenevolent impulse to compassion and a righteous steadfastness are\nseen as potentially contradictory. In the Analects,\nportrayals of Confucius do not recognize a tension between benevolence\nand righteousness, perhaps because each is usually described as\nsalient in a different set of contexts. In ritual contexts like courts\nor shrines, one ideally acts like one might act out of familial\naffection in a personal context, the paradigm that is key to\nbenevolence. In the performance of official duties, one ideally acts\nout of the responsibilities felt to inferiors and superiors, with a\nresistance to temptation by corrupt gain that is key to\nrighteousness. The Records of Ritual distinguishes between the\ndomains of these two virtues: \n\n\nIn regulating one\u2019s household, kindness overrules righteousness.\nOutside of one\u2019s house, righteousness cuts off kindness. What\none undertakes in serving one\u2019s father, one also does in serving\none\u2019s lord, because one\u2019s reverence for both is the same.\nTreating nobility in a noble way and the honorable in an honorable\nway, is the height of righteousness. (\u201cSangfu\nsizhi\u201d \u55aa\u670d\u56db\u5236) \n\n\nWhile it is not the case that righteousness is benevolence by other\nmeans, this passage underlines how in different contexts, different\nvirtues may push people toward participation in particular shared\ncultural practices constitutive of the good life.\n\nWhile the virtues of benevolence and righteousness might impel a gentleman to adhere to ritual\nnorms in particular situations or areas of life, a third virtue of\n\u201critual propriety\u201d expresses a sensitivity to one\u2019s\nsocial place, and willingness to play all of one\u2019s multiple\nritual roles. The term li translated here as \u201critual\npropriety\u201d has a particularly wide range of connotations, and\nadditionally connotes both the conventions of ritual and etiquette. In\nthe Analects, Confucius is depicted both teaching and\nconducting the rites in the manner that he believed they were\nconducted in antiquity. Detailed restrictions such as \u201cthe\ngentleman avoids wearing garments with red-black trim\u201d (10.6),\nwhich the poet Ezra Pound disparaged as \u201cverses re: length of\nthe night-gown and the predilection for ginger\u201d (Pound 1951:\n191), were by no means trivial to Confucius. His imperative, \u201cDo\nnot look or listen, speak or move, unless it is in accordance with the\nrites\u201d (12.1), in answer to a question about benevolence,\nillustrates how the symbolic conventions of the ritual system played a\nrole in the cultivation of the virtues. We have seen how ritual shapes\nvalues by restricting desires, thereby allowing reflection and the\ncultivation of moral dispositions. Yet without the proper affective\nstate, a person is not properly performing ritual. In the\nAnalects, Confucius says he cannot tolerate \u201critual\nwithout reverence, or mourning without grief,\u201d (3.26). When\nasked about the root of ritual propriety, he says that in funerals,\nthe mourners\u2019 distress is more important than the formalities\n(3.4). Knowing the details of ritual protocols is important, but is\nnot a substitute for sincere affect in performing them. Together, they\nare necessary conditions for the gentleman\u2019s training, and are also\nessential to understanding the social context in which Confucius\ntaught his disciples.\n\nThe mastery that \u201critual propriety\u201d signaled was part of a\ncurriculum associated with the training of rulers and officials, and\nproper ritual performance at court could also serve as a kind of political\nlegitimation. Confucius summarized the different prongs of the\neducation in ritual and music involved in the training of his\nfollowers: \n\n\nRaise yourself up with the Classic of Odes. Establish\nyourself with ritual. Complete yourself with music. (8.8) \n\n\nOn one occasion, Boyu \u4f2f\u9b5a, the son of Confucius,\nexplained that when he asked his father to teach him, his father told\nhim to study the\nClassic of Odes in order to have a means to speak with\nothers, and to study ritual to establish himself (16.13). That\nConfucius insists that his son master classical literature and practices\nunderscores the values of these cultural products as a means of\ntransmitting the way from one generation to the next. He tells his\ndisciples that the study of the Classic of Odes prepares them\nfor different aspects of life, providing them with a capacity to: \n\n\nat home serve one\u2019s father, away from it serve\none\u2019s lord, as well as increase one's knowledge of the names of birds,\nanimals, plants and trees. (17.9) \n\n\nThis valuation of knowledge of both the cultural and\nnatural worlds is one reason why the figure of Confucius has\ntraditionally been identified with schooling, and why today his\nbirthday is celebrated as \u201cTeacher\u2019s Day\u201d in some\nparts of Asia. In the ancient world, this kind of education also\nqualified Confucius and his disciples for employment on estates and at\ncourts.\n\nThe fourth virtue, wisdom, is related to appraising people and\nsituations. In the Analects, wisdom allows a gentleman to\ndiscern crooked and straight behavior in others (12.22), and\ndiscriminate between those who may be reformed and those who may not\n(15.8). In the former dialogue, Confucius explains the virtue of\nwisdom as \u201cknowing others\u201d. The \u201cThicket of\nSayings\u201d excavated at Guodian indicates that this knowledge is\nthe basis for properly \u201cselecting\u201d others, defining wisdom\nas the virtue that is the basis for selection. But it is also about\nappraising situations correctly, as suggested by the master\u2019s\nrhetorical question: \u201cHow can a person be considered wise if\nthat person does not dwell in benevolence?\u201d (4.1). One\nwell-known passage often cited to imply Confucius is agnostic about\nthe world of the spirits is more literally about how wisdom allows an\noutsider to present himself in a way appropriate to the people on\nwhose behalf he is working: \n\n\nWhen working for what is right for the common people, to show\nreverence for the ghosts and spirits while maintaining one\u2019s\ndistance may be deemed wisdom. (6.22) \n\n\nThe context for this sort of appraisal is usually official service,\nand wisdom is often attributed to valued ministers or advisors to sage\nrulers.\n\nIn certain dialogues, wisdom also connotes a moral discernment that\nallows the gentleman to be confident of the appropriateness of good\nactions. In the Analects, Confucius tells his disciple Zi Lu\n\u5b50\u8def that wisdom recognizes knowing a thing as knowing it,\nand ignorance of a thing as ignorance of it (2.17). In soliloquies\nabout several virtues, Confucius describes a wise person as never\nconfused (9.28, 14.28). While comparative philosophers have noted that\nChinese thought has nothing clearly analogous to the role of the will\nin pre-modern European philosophy, the moral discernment that is part\nof wisdom does provide actors with confidence that the moral actions\nthey have taken are correct.\n\nThe virtue of trustworthiness qualifies a gentleman to give advice to\na ruler, and a ruler or official to manage others. In the\nAnalects, Confucius explains it succinctly: \u201cif one is\ntrustworthy, others will give one responsibilities\u201d (17.6, cf.\n20.1). While trustworthiness may be rooted in\nthe proper expression of friendship between those of the same status (1.4, 5.26),\nit is also valuable in interactions with those of different status. The disciple Zi Xia \u5b50\u590f explains its effect on superiors and\nsubordinates: when advising a ruler, without trustworthiness, the\nruler will think a gentleman is engaged in slander, and when\nadministering a state, without trustworthiness, people will think a\ngentleman is exploiting them (19.10). The implication is that a\nsincerely public-minded official would be ineffective without the\ntrust that this quality inspires. In a dialogue with a ruler from\nchapter four of Han\u2019s Intertextual Commentary the Odes,\nConfucius explains that in employing someone, trustworthiness is\nsuperior to strength, ability to flatter, or eloquence. Being able to\nrely on someone is so important to Confucius that, when asked about\ngood government, he explained that trustworthiness was superior to\neither food or weapons, concluding: \u201cIf the people do not find the\nruler trustworthy, the state will not stand\u201d (12.7). \n\nBy the Han period, benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety,\nwisdom and trustworthiness began to be considered as a complete set of\nhuman virtues, corresponding with other quintets of phenomena used to\ndescribe the natural world. Some texts described a level of moral\nperfection, as with the sages of antiquity, as unifying all these\nvirtues. Prior to this, it is unclear whether the possession of a\nparticular virtue entailed having all the others, although benevolence\nwas sometimes used as a more general term for a combination of one or\nmore of the other virtues (e.g.,\nAnalects 17.6). At other times, Confucius presented\nindividual virtues as expressions of goodness in particular domains of\nlife. Early Confucius dialogues are embedded in concrete situations,\nand so resist attempts to distill them into more abstract principles\nof morality. As a result, descriptions of the virtues are embedded in\nanecdotes about the exemplary individuals whose character traits the\ndialogues encourage their audience to develop. Confucius taught that\nthe measure of a good action was whether it was an expression of the\nactor\u2019s virtue, something his lessons share with those of\nphilosophies like Aristotle\u2019s that are generally described as\n\u201cvirtue ethics\u201d. A modern evaluation of the teachings of Confucius as\na \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d is articulated in Bryan W. Van\nNorden\u2019s Virtue Ethics and Consequentialism in Early Chinese\nPhilosophy, which pays particular attention to analogies between\nthe way of Confucius and Aristotle\u2019s \u201cgood life\u201d.\nThe nature of the available source materials about Confucius, however,\nmeans that the diverse texts from early China lack the systematization\nof a work like Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics.\n\nThe five virtues described above are not the only ones of which\nConfucius spoke. He discussed loyalty (zhong \u5fe0), which\nat one point is described as the minister\u2019s behavior toward a\nritually proper ruler (3.19). He said that courage (yong\n\u52c7) is what compels one to act once one has seen where\nrighteousness lies (2.24).  Another term sometimes translated as\n\u201cvirtue\u201d (de \u5fb7), is usually used to\ndescribe the authority of a ruler that grows out of goodness or favor\nto others, and is a key term in many of the social and political works\ndiscussed in the following section. Yet going through a list of all\nthe virtues in the early sources is not sufficient to describe the\nentirety of the moral universe associated with Confucius.\n\nThe presence of themes in the Analects like the ruler\u2019s\nexceptional influence as a moral exemplar, the importance of judging\npeople by their deeds rather than their words (1.3, 2.10, 5.10), or\neven the protection of the culture of Zhou by higher powers (9.5), all\nhighlight the unsystematic nature of the text and underscore that\nteaching others how to cultivate the virtues is a key aspect, but only\na part, of the ethical ideal of Confucius. Yet there is also a conundrum inherent in any attempt to derive abstract moral rules from the mostly dialogical form of the Analects, that is, the problem of whether the situational context and conversation partner is integral to evaluating the statements of Confucius. \nA historically notable example of an attempt to find a generalized moral rule in the Analects is the reading of a pair of\npassages that use a formulation similar to that of the \u201cGolden\nRule\u201d of the Christian Bible (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31) to\ndescribe benevolence: \u201cDo not impose upon others those things\nthat you yourself do not desire\u201d (12.2, cf. 5.12, 15.24). Read\nas axiomatic moral imperatives, these passages differ from the kind of\nexemplar-based and situational conversations about morality usually\nfound in the Analects. For this reason, some scholars,\nincluding E. Bruce Brooks, believe these passages to be\ninterpolations. While they are not wholly inconsistent with the way\nthat benevolence is described in early texts, their\ninterpretation as abstract principles has been influenced by their perceived similarity to the Biblical examples. In\nthe Records of Ritual, a slightly different formulation of a\nrule about self and others is presented as not universal in its scope,\nbut rather as descriptive of how the exemplary ruler influences the\npeople. In common with other early texts, the Analects\ndescribes how the moral transformation of society relies on the\npositive example of the ruler, comparing the influence of the\ngentleman on the people to the way the wind blows on the grass,\nforcing it to bend (12.19). In a similar vein, after discussing how the personal\nqualities of rulers of the past determined whether or not their\nsubjects could morally transform, the Records of Ritual\nexpresses its principle of reflexivity: \n\n\nThat is why the gentleman only seeks things in others that he or she\npersonally possesses. [The gentleman] only condemns things in others\nthat he or she personally lacks. (\u201cDaxue\u201d\n\u5927\u5b78) \n\n\nThis is a point about the efficacy of moral suasion, saying that a\nruler cannot expect to reform society solely by command since it is\nonly the ruler\u2019s personal example that can transform others. For\nthis reason, the ruler should not compel behaviors from his subjects\nto which he or she would not personally assent, something rather\ndifferent from the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d. \nHistorically, however, views that Confucius was inspired by the same Natural Theology as Christians, or that philosophers are naturally concerned with the generalization of moral imperatives, have argued in favor of a closer identification with the \u201cGolden Rule,\u201d a fact that illustrates the interpretative conundrum arising from the formal aspects of the Analects. \n",
