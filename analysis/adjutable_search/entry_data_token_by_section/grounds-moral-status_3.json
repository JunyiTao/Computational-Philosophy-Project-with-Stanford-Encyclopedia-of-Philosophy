    "main_text": "What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)? || Strong Reason to Aid\n2.2 Strong Reason to Aid\n\nWhile this is less commonly associated with FMS, some philosophers\nbelieve that there is a strong reason to provide aid to beings with\nFMS (e.g., Jaworska 2007 and Quinn 1984). This reason is not as strong\nas the stringent presumption discussed above. For example, the set of\ncircumstances which can override the reason to aid a being with FMS is\nmuch broader compared to the stringent presumption against killing.\nAlso, the reason not to aid might not silence many (or any) other\nconflicting considerations. As for which reasons override or are on a\npar with this strong reason to aid, there are many differing accounts\n(e.g., Greenspan 2010 and the entry on\n moral reasoning,\n section 2.5).\n\nThe strength of this reason to aid can also be understood in\ncomparison with the reason to aid beings with lesser moral status,\nsince beings with FMS merit the strongest reason to aid (see McMahan\n2002, pp. 223\u2013224, for a contrary interpretation of ordinary\nmoral intuitions). Imagine a context in which one is saving\nindividuals from a certain level of harm, such as pain, discomfort, or\ndeath. When faced with a choice of saving either a being with FMS or\none without FMS, barring further reasons that may complicate the moral\npicture (e.g., indirect consequences of saving the being without FMS\nfor other beings with FMS), there is a stronger reason to pick the\nbeing with FMS. Further, even in cases where aiding is not in fact\npossible or the reason to aid is overridden, it is a graver moral\nmisfortune, ceteris paribus, to leave a being with FMS\nunaided, as compared to a being without FMS. Of course, what aid is\nappropriate for a being depends on the context and on the\nbeing\u2019s stage of development. FMS is about the strength of the\nreason to aid and not about what type of aid to give.\n\nNote that even if FMS entails strong reasons to aid, the reverse is\nnot necessarily the case. Stronger reason to aid one being rather than\nanother does not necessarily entail that the aided being has a higher\nmoral status. See more general methodological cautions along these\nlines in section 2.4.\n",
