    "main_text": "Applications Outside Epistemology || Decision Theory\n6.1 Decision Theory\n\nShould you keep reading this section, or should you stop here and go\ndo something else? That all depends: what might you gain by continuing\nreading, and what are the odds those gains will surpass the gains of\ndoing something else instead? Decision theory weighs these\nconsiderations to determine which choice is best.\n\nTo see how the weighing works, let\u2019s start with a very simple\nexample: betting on the outcome of a die-roll. In particular,\nlet\u2019s suppose a 5 or 6 will win you $19, while any other outcome\nloses you $10. Should you take this bet? We can represent the choice\nyou face in the form of a table:\n\n\n\nRoll 1\u20134\nRoll 5 or 6 \n\nBet\n\u2212$10\n\\(+\\)$19 \n\nDon\u2019t bet\n$0\n$0 \n\n\nSo far, taking the bet looks pretty good: you stand to gain almost\ntwice as much as you stand to lose. What the table doesn\u2019t show,\nhowever, is that you\u2019re twice as likely to lose as to win:\n\\(2/3\\) vs. \\(1/3\\). So let\u2019s add this information in:\n\n\n\nRoll 1\u20134\nRoll 5 or 6 \n\nBet\n\\(\\substack{-$10\\\\ p=2/3}\\)\n\\(\\substack{+$19\\\\ p=1/3}\\) \n\nDon\u2019t bet\n\\(\\substack{-$0\\\\ p=2/3}\\)\n\\(\\substack{+$0\\\\ p=1/3}\\) \n\n\nNow we can see that the potential downside of betting, namely losing\n$10, isn\u2019t outweighed by the potential upside. What you stand to\nwin isn\u2019t quite twice what you\u2019d lose, but the probability\nof losing is twice as much. Formally, we can express this\nline of thinking as follows:\n\\[ (-10 \\times 2/3) + (19 \\times 1/3) = -1/3\n< 0\\]\n\nIn other words, when the potential losses and gains are weighed\nagainst their respective probabilities, their sum total fails to\nexceed 0. But $0 is what you can expect if you don\u2019t bet. So\nbetting doesn\u2019t quite measure up to abstaining in this\nexample.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic idea at the core of decision theory, but\nit\u2019s still a long way from being satisfactory. For one thing,\nthis calculation assumes money is everything, which it surely\nisn\u2019t. Suppose you need exactly $29 to get a bus home for the\nnight, and all you have is the $10 bill in your pocket, which on its\nown is no use (even the cheapest drink at the casino bar is $11). So\nlosing your $10 isn\u2019t really much worse than keeping\nit\u2014you might as well be broke either way. But gaining\n$19, now that\u2019s worth a lot to you. If you can just get the bus\nback home, you won\u2019t have to sleep rough for the night.\n\nSo we have to consider how much various dollar-amounts are worth\nto you. Losing $10 is worth about the same to you as losing $0,\nthough gaining $19 is much, much more valuable. To capture these\nfacts, we introduce a function, \\(u\\), which represents the\nutility of various possible outcomes. For you, \\(u(-$10)\n\\approx u(-$0)\\), but \\(u(+$19) \\gg u(-$0)\\).\n\nExactly how much is gaining $19 worth to you? What is\n\\(u(+$19)=\\ldots\\), exactly? We can actually answer this question if\nwe just set a scale first. For example, suppose we want to know\nexactly how much you value a gain of $19 on a scale that ranges from\ngaining nothing to gaining $100. Then we set \\(u(+$0)=0\\) and\n\\(u(+$100)=1\\), so that our scale ranges from 0 to 1. Then we can\ncalculate \\(u(+$19)\\) by asking how much you would be willing to risk\nto gain $100 instead of just $19. That is, suppose you had a choice\nbetween just being handed $19 with no strings attached vs. being\noffered a (free) gamble that pays $100 if you win, but nothing\notherwise. How high would the probability of winning that $100 have to\nbe for you to take a chance on it instead of the guaranteed $19? Given\nwhat\u2019s at stake\u2014making it home for the night vs. sleeping\nrough\u2014you probably wouldn\u2019t accept much risk for the\nchance at the full $100 instead of the guaranteed $19. Let\u2019s say\nyou\u2019d accept at most .01 risk, i.e., the chance of winning the\nfull $100 would have to be at least .99 for you to trade the\nguaranteed $19 for the chance at the full $100. Well, then, on a scale\nfrom gaining $0 to gaining $100, you value gaining $19 quite highly:\n.99 out of 1. (This method of measuring utility was discovered and\npopularized by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), though\nessentially the same idea was previously discovered by Ramsey (1964\n[1926]).)\n\nOur full decision theory relies on two functions then, \\(p\\) and\n\\(u\\). The probability function \\(p\\) reflects how likely you think\nthe various possible outcomes of an action are to obtain, while \\(u\\)\nrepresents how desirable each outcome is. Faced with a choice between\ntwo possible courses of action, \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), with two\npossible states the world might be in, \\(S\\) and \\(\\neg S\\), there are\nfour possible outcomes, \\(O_1,\\ldots,O_4\\). For example, if you bet $1\non a coin-flip coming up heads and it does comes up heads, outcome\n\\(O_1\\) obtains and you win $1; if instead it comes up tails, outcome\n\\(O_2\\) obtains and you lose $1. The general shape of such situations\nis thus:\n\n\n\n\\(S\\)\n\\(\\neg S\\) \n\n\\(A\\)\n\\(\\substack{u(O_1)\\\\ p(S)}\\)\n\\(\\substack{u(O_2)\\\\ p(\\neg S)}\\) \n\n\\(\\neg A\\)\n\\( \\substack{u(O_3)\\\\p(S)}\\)\n\\( \\substack{u(O_4)\\\\p(\\neg S)}\\) \n\n\nTo weigh the probabilities and the utilities against each other, we\nthen define the notion of expected utility:\n\nDefinition. The expected utility of act\n\\(A\\), \\(EU(A)\\), is defined: \n\n\\[ EU(A) = p(S)u(O_1) + p(\\neg S)u(O_2).\\]\n\n The expected\nutility of act \\(\\neg A\\), \\(EU(\\neg A)\\), is likewise:\n\n\\[ EU(\\neg A) = p(S)u(O_3) + p(\\neg S)u(O_4).\\]\n\n \n\n(Why \u201cexpected\u201d utility? If you faced the same decision\nproblem over and over again, and each time you chose option \\(A\\), in\nthe long run you could expect your average utility to be approximately\n\\(EU(A)\\).) The same idea extends to cases with more than two ways\nthings could turn out simply by adding columns to the table and\nmultiplying/summing all the way across. When there are more than two\npossible actions, we just add more rows and do the same.\n\nFinally, our decision theory culminates in the following norm:\n\nExpected Utility Maximization\n\nChoose the option with the highest expected utility. (In case of a\ntie, either option is acceptable.)\n\nWe haven\u2019t given much of an argument for this rule, except that\nit \u201cweighs\u201d the desirability of each possible outcome\nagainst the probability that it will obtain. There are various ways\none might develop this weighing idea, however. The one elaborated here\nis due to Savage (1954). It is considered the classic/orthodox\napproach in social sciences like economics and psychology.\nPhilosophers, however, tend to prefer variations on Savage\u2019s\nbasic approach: either the \u201cevidential\u201d decision theory\ndeveloped by Jeffrey (1965) or some form of\n \u201ccausal\u201d decision theory (see entry)\n (Gibbard and Harper 1978; Skyrms 1980; Lewis 1981; Joyce 1999).\n\nThese approaches all agree on the broad idea that the correct decision\nrule weighs probabilities and utilities in linear fashion: multiply\nthen add (see\n the entry on expected utility).\n A different approach recently pioneered by Buchak (2013, 2014) holds\nthat (in)tolerance for risk throws a non-linear wrench into this\nequation, however (see also Steele 2007). And taking account of\npeople\u2019s cognitive limitations has long been thought to require\nfurther departures from the traditional, linear model (Kahneman and\nTversky 1979; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993; Gigerenzer, Todd, and\nGroup 1999; Weirich 2004).\n",
