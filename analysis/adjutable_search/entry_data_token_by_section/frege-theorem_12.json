Frege\u2019s Analysis of Cardinal Numbers\n\nCardinal numbers are the numbers that can be used to answer the\nquestion \u2018How many \\(\\ldots\\) are there?\u2019, and Frege\ndiscovered that such numbers bear an interesting relationship to the\nnatural numbers. Frege\u2019s insights concerning this relationship\ntrace back to his work in Gl, in which the notion of\nan extension played very little role. The seminal idea of\nGl \u00a746 was the observation that a statement of\nnumber (e.g., \u201cThere are eight planets\u201d) is an assertion\nabout a concept. To explain this idea, Frege noted that one and the\nsame external phenomenon can be counted in different ways; for\nexample, a certain external phenomenon could be counted as 1 army, 5\ndivisions, 25 regiments, 200 companies, 600 platoons, or 24,000\npeople. Each way of counting the external phenomenon corresponds to a\nmanner of its conception. The question \u201cHow many are\nthere?\u201d is only properly formulated as the question \u201cHow\nmany \\(F\\)s are there?\u201d where a concept \\(F\\) is supplied. On\nFrege\u2019s view, the statements of number which answer such\nquestions (e.g., \u201cThere are \\(n\\) \\(F\\)s\u201d) tell us\nsomething about the concept involved. For example, the statement\n\u201cThere are eight planets in the solar system\u201d tells us\nthat the ordinary concept planet in the solar system falls\nunder the second-level numerical concept being\nexemplified by eight objects. \n\nIn Gl, Frege then moves from this realization, in which\nstatements of numbers are analyzed as predicating second-level\nnumerical concepts of first-level concepts, to develop an account of\nthe cardinal and natural numbers as \u2018self-subsistent\u2019\nobjects. He introduces a \u2018cardinality operator\u2019 on\nconcepts, namely, \u2018the number belonging to the concept \\(\nF\\)\u2019, which designates the cardinal number which numbers the\nobjects falling under \\(F\\). In what follows, we say this more simply\nas \u2018the number of \\(F\\)s\u2019 and use the simple notation\n\u2018\\(\\#F\\)\u2019. Note that the operator # behaves like the\n\\(\\epsilon\\) operator \u2013 when it is prefixed to a concept name\nlike planet (\\(P\\)), then \\(\\#P\\) (\u201cthe number of\nplanets\u201d) denotes an object; when it is prefixed to a variable\nlike \\(F\\), then \\(\\# F\\) ranges over the domain of objects (for each\nconcept that \\(F\\) can take as a value, \\(\\#F\\) denotes an object\nrelative to that concept). Frege offers both an implicit (i.e.,\ncontextual) and an explicit definition of this operator in\nGl. Both of these definitions require a preliminary\ndefinition of when two concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence or \u2018equinumerous\u2019. The notion of\nequinumerosity plays an important and fundamental role in the\ndevelopment of Frege\u2019s Theorem. After developing the definition\nof equinumerosity, we then discuss Frege\u2019s implicit and explicit\ndefinition of the number of \\(F\\)s. Only the former is needed for the\nproof of Frege\u2019s Theorem, however.\n",
