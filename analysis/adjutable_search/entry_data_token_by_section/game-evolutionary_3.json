    "main_text": "Why Evolutionary Game Theory? || The equilibrium selection problem\n4.1 The equilibrium selection problem\n\nThe concept of a Nash equilibrium (see the entry on\n game theory)\n has been the most used solution concept in game theory since its\nintroduction by John Nash (1950). A selection of strategies by a group\nof agents is said to be in a Nash equilibrium if each agent\u2019s\nstrategy is a best-response to the strategies chosen by the other\nplayers. By best-response, we mean that no individual can improve her\npayoff by switching strategies unless at least one other individual\nswitches strategies as well. This need not mean that the payoffs to\neach individual are optimal in a Nash equilibrium: indeed, one of the\ndisturbing facts of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma is that the only Nash\nequilbrium of the game\u2014when both agents defect\u2014is\n suboptimal.[6]\n\nYet a difficulty arises with the use of Nash equilibrium as a solution\nconcept for games: if we restrict players to using pure strategies,\nnot every game has a Nash equilbrium. The game \u201cMatching\nPennies\u201d illustrates this problem.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHeads\nTails \n\nHeads\n(0,1)\n(1,0) \n\nTails\n(1,0)\n(0,1) \n\n\nFigure 12: Payoff matrix for the game of\nMatching Pennies. (Row wins if the two coins do not match, whereas\nColumn wins if the two coins match).\n\n\nWhile it is true that every noncooperative game in which players may\nuse mixed strategies has a Nash equilibrium, some have questioned the\nsignificance of this for real agents. If it seems appropriate to\nrequire rational agents to adopt only pure strategies (perhaps because\nthe cost of implementing a mixed strategy runs too high), then the\ngame theorist must admit that certain games lack solutions.\n\nA more significant problem with invoking the Nash equilibrium as the\nappropriate solution concept arises because some games have\nmultiple Nash equilibria (see the section on\n Solution Concepts and Equilibria,\n in the entry on game theory). When there are several different Nash\nequilibria, how is a rational agent to decide which of the several\nequilibria is the \u201cright one\u201d to settle\n upon?[7]\n Attempts to resolve this problem have produced a number of possible\nrefinements to the concept of a Nash equilibrium, each refinement\nhaving some intuitive purchase. Unfortunately, so many refinements of\nthe notion of a Nash equilibrium have been developed that, in many\ngames which have multiple Nash equilibria, each equilibrium could be\njustified by some refinement present in the literature. The problem\nhas thus shifted from choosing among multiple Nash equilibria to\nchoosing among the various refinements.\n\nSamuelson (1997), in his work Evolutionary Games and Equilibrium\nSelection) expressed hope that further development of\nevolutionary game theory could be of service in addressing the\nequilibrium selection problem. At present, this hope does not seem to\nhave been realised. As section 2.1 showed, there are multiple\ncompeting concepts of evolutionary stability in play. Furthermore, as\nsection 3 showed, there is an imperfect agreement between what is\nevolutionary stable, in the dynamic setting, and what is evolutionary\nstable, in the static setting.\n",
