    "main_text": "The Argument For Fictionalism || Premise (4) and Physicalism and Psychologism\n1.4 Premise (4) and Physicalism and Psychologism\n\nPhysicalism is the view that our mathematical sentences and theories\nare about ordinary physical objects. John Stuart Mill (1843) developed\na view of this kind. On his view, mathematics is just a very general\nnatural science. Thus, for instance, according to Mill, the sentence\n\u20182 + 3 = 5\u2019 is not a claim about abstract objects (the\nnumbers 2, 3, and 5); rather, it\u2019s a claim about piles of\nphysical objects (in particular, it tells us that if we push a pile of\ntwo objects together with a pile of three objects, we\u2019ll get a\npile of five objects. (Phillip Kitcher (1984) and the early Penelope\nMaddy (1990) have also endorsed views with \u201cphysicalistic\nleanings\u201d, but in the end, neither is plausibly interpreted as\nfalling into this camp. Maddy\u2019s early view is better thought of\nas a non-traditional sort of platonism, because according to this\nview, mathematics is about nonphysical objects that exist in space and\ntime; and Kitcher\u2019s view is best thought of as a kind of\nparaphrase nominalism, because on his view, mathematical utterances\nturn out not to be about any actually existing objects.)\n\nThere are numerous problems with physicalistic views of mathematics.\nTo mention just one of these problems, physicalism seems completely\nincapable of accounting for various kinds of claims about infinities\nthat we find in mathematics. For instance, it is a theorem of set\ntheory that there are infinitely many transfinite cardinal numbers\nthat keep getting bigger and bigger without end. Thus, set theory is\ncommitted to the existence of infinite sets that are so huge that they\nsimply dwarf garden variety infinite sets, like the set of all the\nnatural numbers. There is just no plausible way to interpret this talk\nof gigantic infinite sets as being about physical objects.\n\nPsychologism is the view that mathematical sentences and theories are\nabout mental objects. Probably the most common version of this view\nholds that numbers are something like ideas in our heads, and ordinary\nmathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 provide\ndescriptions of these ideas. This view was popular in the late\n19th Century; it was endorsed by, e.g., the early Husserl\n(1891), as well as the intuitionists, Brouwer (1912, 1948) and Heyting\n(1956). But Frege (1884, 1893\u20131903) provided a host of arguments\nagainst the view and essentially buried it. To give just one argument\nhere, it seems that psychologism is just as incapable as physicalism\nis of dealing with the huge infinities in mathematics. As was just\nseen, standard set theories entail that there actually exist huge\ninfinities of mathematical objects. But it\u2019s just not believable\nthat there are that many ideas in our heads. Indeed, it seems clear\nthat there are only finitely many ideas in our heads. Therefore, it is\nnot plausible to maintain that the claims of set theory are made true\nby mental objects.\n\nIn response, one might claim that even if there aren\u2019t\ninfinitely many ideas in our heads, it seems likely that we have ideas\nof infinities in our heads. This is no doubt true\u2014there are such\nideas in our heads\u2014but this does not save psychologism from the\nabove objection. For our mathematical theories entail that there\nactually exist infinitely many different mathematical objects. E.g.,\nstandard theories of arithmetic entail that there is such a thing as\n1, and that there is such a thing as 2 (and that it\u2019s distinct\nfrom 1), and that there is such a thing as 3 (and that it\u2019s\ndistinct from both 1 and 2), and so on. So our mathematical theories\nare true descriptions of ideas in our heads only if there actually\nexist infinitely many different ideas in our heads. Thus, since there\naren\u2019t that many ideas in our heads, we cannot maintain that our\nmathematical theories are true descriptions of such things.\n\nAlternatively, one might respond to the above argument against\npsychologism by moving to a view according to which mathematical\nclaims are about ideas that we could construct, or\npossible mental objects, or some such thing. But this would\nnot be a psychologistic view, because on this view, the objects of\nmathematics would not be actual mental objects; they would be\npossible objects, which, presumably, are either abstract\nobjects or objects of some other metaphysically dubious kind.\n\nFinally, one might object to both of the arguments in this\nsubsection\u2014i.e., the arguments against physicalism and\npsychologism\u2014by saying something like this:\n\nThe arguments given here are supposed to motivate the idea that\nordinary mathematical sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are not\nplausibly interpreted as being about physical or mental\nobjects\u2014or more specifically, that they are better interpreted\nas being about (or at least purporting to be about) abstract objects.\nBut one might object here that, as an interpretation of ordinary\nmathematical discourse, the platonist/fictionalist view is no more\nplausible than physicalism or psychologism. For one might find it\nimplausible to suppose that when ordinary folk make mathematical\nclaims, they intend to be speaking about abstract objects.\n\nBut platonists and fictionalists are not committed to the thesis that\npeople have positive intentions to be talking about abstract objects.\nRather, they can say the following: (i) ordinary mathematical claims\nare best interpreted at face value\u2014and, hence, as making claims\nabout objects\u2014because typical mathematicians (and, indeed,\ntypical examples of ordinary folk) do not have positive intentions to\nbe speaking nonliterally when they utter mathematical sentences; and\n(ii) there are features of the intentions of typical mathematicians\nand typical folk, with respect to their mathematical utterances, that\nare inconsistent with the idea that these utterances are about\nphysical or mental objects; and (iii) there is nothing in the\nintentions of typical mathematicians or typical folk that is\ninconsistent with the idea that our mathematical sentences are about\nabstract objects. Thus, on this view, the platonist/fictionalist\nsemantic theory is better than other semantic theories of mathematical\ndiscourse because it\u2019s the only theory that\u2019s consistent\nwith the data\u2014not because mathematicians and ordinary folk have\npositive intentions to be speaking about abstract objects when they\nutter mathematical sentences.\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting, before moving on, that one can claim that\nthe existence of mathematical objects like numbers is dependent on\nus without endorsing a psychologistic view of these objects. For\none might claim that numbers are mind-dependent abstract\nobjects\u2014i.e., non-spatiotemporal objects that came into being\nbecause of the activities of human beings. Views of this general kind\nare endorsed by Liston (2003\u201304), Cole (2009), and Bueno\n(2009).) \n",
