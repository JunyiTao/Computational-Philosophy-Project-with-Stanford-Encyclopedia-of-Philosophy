    "main_text": "Ideas || Varieties of ideas\n4.1 Varieties of ideas\n\nSome ideas, called objectual (gegenst\u00e4ndlich)\nby Bolzano, have, or represent, one or more objects, for instance,\n[the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem], [raven]. Others are\nobjectless (gegenstandlos), e.g., [round square],\n[golden mountain], [not] (TS, \u00a767). Not recognizing\nempty collections, Bolzano says that objectless ideas have no\nextensions.\n\nIf an idea has exactly one object, it is called singular,\nand, if has more than one, general (\u00a768). Some general\nideas are complex, e.g., [star of the first magnitude]. Others,\nBolzano maintains, are simple: he thinks that [object] and [attribute]\nare likely such. In the case of singular ideas, similarly, he holds\nthat some are complex, e.g., [the most massive planet in our solar\nsystem], while others are simple. Appropriating Kant\u2019s term for\nhis own purposes, he calls the latter kind of ideas, that is, simple,\nsingular ideas, intuitions (\u00a772). Ideas that are not\nintuitions and do not have any intuitions among their parts are called\n(pure) concepts, while ideas that have both concepts and\nintuitions among their parts are called mixed (\u00a773).\n\nThose familiar with the role played by logically proper names in\nRussell\u2019s philosophy of logical atomism will have an easier time\nunderstanding Bolzano\u2019s use of the concept of an intuition.\nIntuitions are the counterpart in the realm of ideas in themselves to\nthe essentially indexical elements in language: they are best\nexpressed by using a bare demonstrative (\u2018this\u2019) and, in\nthe case of subjective human intuitions, always have particular\ncontemporaneous mental states as their objects. Any singular idea of a\ncontingently existing particular, moreover, must number intuitions\namong its parts. Intuitions thus serve as markers of empirical\ncontent. \n\nIf no part of a proposition is an intuition, it is called purely\nconceptual, otherwise intuitional. This distinction,\ndefined at the level of propositions in themselves, is prior to the\ndistinction between a priori and a posteriori\njudgements, and used to define it:\n\n\nIf the propositions from which a judgement M is deduced, as\nwell as those from which the former follow, down to the immediate\njudgements, are all purely conceptual propositions, then judgement\nM can be called a judgement from pure concepts, or\npure, or a priori. In all other cases it could be\nsaid to be drawn from experience or a posteriori\n(TS, \u00a7306, no.12). \n\n\nSome sciences, e.g., number theory or real analysis, consist entirely\nof purely conceptual propositions, and are accordingly called\npurely conceptual sciences. Though Bolzano optimistically\nheld that most purely conceptual truths could be known a\npriori, he refrains from claiming this of all of them, and\nclearly recognizes that many purely conceptual propositions, even in\nmathematics, are accepted based at least partly on empirical\n(intuitional) evidence (TS, \u00a7133; Bolzano 2004a: 53).\n\n",
