    "main_text": "Causalism and Causal Theories of Action || The Problem of Causal Deviance\n2.4 The Problem of Causal Deviance\n\nLet us take the following as the general form of a (reductive) causal\ntheory of action:\n\nAn event (bodily movement) B is an intentional action if and\nonly if it is an event caused by mental states [S1,\n\u2026 Sn].\n\n\nWe can immediately see how to generate counterexamples to any such\nformula: find cases in which there is a causal path from\n[S1, \u2026, Sn] to B, but not\nthrough the \u201dnormal\u201c causal path that would presumably\ngive rise to the bodily movement in a genuine case of action. This is\nthe problem of deviance for the causal theory of action; Davidson\nhimself was among the first who provided classical examples of such\ncausal deviance for his own account of action (but Frankfurt\n1978\u2019s presentation of the problem was particularly\ninfluential):\n\nA climber might want to rid himself of the weight and danger of\nholding another man on a rope, and he might know that by loosening his\nhold on the rope he could rid himself of the weight and danger. This\nbelief and want might so unnerve him as to cause him to loosen his\nhold, and yet it might be the case that he never chose to loosen his\nhold, nor did he do it intentionally. (Davidson 1973, 153\u20134)\n\n\nThis is a case of what is often called \u201dprimary deviance\u201c\n(Mele and Moser 1994), in which the bodily movements in question are\nnot even actions, but the causal theory seems to imply they are. In\ncontrast, in cases of \u201dsecondary deviance\u2019\u2019, the\ntheory misdescribes one of the consequences of the action as\nintentional when it clearly is not. The same Davidson paper provides\nan example of the latter:\n\nA man may try to kill someone by shooting at him. Suppose the killer\nmisses his victim by a mile, but the shot stampedes a herd of wild\npigs that trample the intended victim to death. Do we want to say the\nman killed his victim intentionally? (Davidson 1973, 152\u20133)\n\n\nThere are very many attempts to solve the problem of causal deviance\nfor a causal theory of action and we cannot cover in detail any of\nthem or mention all of them; here we\u2019ll just list a few\ninfluential strategies (and, of course, some solutions incorporate\nmore than one of these strategies). The first appeals to the notion of\na \u201cproximate cause\u201d (Mele 1992) such that an action is\nintentional only if, for instance, the formation of an intention to\n\u03c6 is the proximate cause of your \u03c6-ing. Another family of\nsolutions appeal to sensitivity and feedback conditions (Peacocke\n1979; Bishop 1989; Smith 2012): the climber\u2019s bodily movements\nwould not count as an intentional action because they would not be\nsensitive to variations in conditions and information on what needs to\nbe done (the climber would not release their hands differently if the\nrope turned out to be stickier or would not change their behaviour if\nthey were to realize that the rope had a safety latch fastened to\ntheir hips). A different type of approach (though with some relevant\nsimilarities to the latter) takes the central problem for the\nDavidsonian approach, the reason why the problem of deviance is\nendemic to Davidson\u2019s causalism, to be the attempt to understand\naction in terms of its causal antecedents, rather than its\nsustaining causes. For Frankfurt (1978) the relevant causal\nmechanisms involved must be guiding the action. Given that action is a\nform of purposive behaviour, we cannot hope to understand what\ndistinguishes action from mere bodily movements by focusing on what\nprecedes the action, rather than by what happens while\nthe agent is acting. As Setiya puts it:\n\nIn the case of basic action, the crucial concept is that of\nguidance: when an agent intentionally \u03c6s, he\nwants to \u03c6, and this desire not only causes but continues\nto guide behaviour towards its object. (It is this condition that\nfails in Davidson\u2019s example). (Setiya 2007, 32)\n\n\nIn the case of secondary deviance, a seemingly promising approach is\nto require that a \u201cnon-basic\u201d action counts as intentional\nonly if (roughly) it follows the agent\u2019s plan (Mele and Moser\n1994). Davidson\u2019s killer\u2019s plan to kill his enemy did not\ninvolve a stampede, and thus it should not count as intentional\naction.\n\nAnother strategy has been developed by \u201cempirically\ninformed\u201d philosophers, who hold that attention to the details\nof control mechanisms implemented at the cognitive level yields a\nresponse to the deviance problem. For example, it has been argued that\ncases of deviance involve lack of attention (Wu 2016), failures at the\nfine-grained level of motor (as opposed to distal and proximal)\nintentions (Mylopoulos and Pacherie 2019), or failures in the causal\npathways responsible for flexible agency (Shepherd 2021).\n\nNeedless to say, there is no agreed upon solution to the problem of\ndeviance (for general skepticism about the possibility of a solution\nsee Anscombe 1995; Vogler 2001; O\u2019Brien 2012; Levy 2013; Horst\n2015; Valaris 2015); on the other hand, philosophers have also argued\nthat competing accounts suffer from problems that parallel the problem\nof deviant causation for theories of action (Paul 2011b).\n",
