    "main_text": "Further aspects of medieval probability || Subjectivity and objectivity\n4.4 Subjectivity and objectivity\n\nThe question of whether medieval forms of probability were subjective\nor objective has long puzzled modern researchers (Kantola 1994). It is\ndifficult to come up with an answer, not least because medieval\nauthors did not employ the (characteristically modern) terminology of\nsubjectivity and objectivity with respect to judgments of\n probability.[43]\n Nevertheless, the discussion above of medieval uses of\nprobability-related terms sheds some light on matters of subjectivity\nand objectivity.\n\nAs has been shown, probabilis or verisimilis were\npredicates for the qualitative support a body of evidence gave to the\ntruth of a proposition or the fittingness of a sign. We have already\nseen what kinds of evidence for probability were accepted at the time.\nA subjective aspect of probability ascriptions thus consisted in a\nbelief obtained by the supporting relationship in a particular case.\nAn objective aspect depended on the actual existence of the supporting\nbasis.\n\nThis kind of objectivity does not make probability a feature of the\nworld or a theoretical construct based on facts of nature. Such\nstronger forms of objectivity underlie, for instance, a true\nproto-frequentist understanding of\n probability.[44]\n If probability means \u201cwhat frequently happens\u201d,\nprobability will often derive from objective features of the world. If\nfrequent occurrence of x is only an indicator for the\naffirmability of sentences about x, medieval\nproto-frequentist probability is not strongly objective in this way.\nNevertheless, at least the medieval semantic notion of probability\nseems to be objective in the strong sense. A proposition, the\npredicate of which mostly inheres in its subject, is at least in some\ncases objectively probable on ontological grounds from a scholastic\npoint of view. Facts of nature determine the degree to which\npredicates inhere in a subject, so that it becomes objectively\nprobable that a mother loves her child.\n\nMoreover, medieval probability ascriptions were in significant\nrespects inter-subjectively testable \u2013 and it is characteristic\nof scholasticism to assume that communities are in a position to\nassess individual claims of\n rationality.[45]\n Propositions can be identified as semantically probable through the\ncommon use of terms. A communitarian basis also existed for the\nendoxic notion of probability, which in principle derives from\nobservable majorities or a shared ascription of wisdom or expertise.\nEndoxic probability could thus become an instrument of social (and\nmoral) control. Yet, although collective control of endoxic\nprobability ascriptions may have existed, it was never absolute in the\nperiod under discussion. Often, no consensus concerning the relative\nweight of experts existed; and it therefore remained contentious which\nside was \u201clarger and more reasonable\u201d (maior et\nsanior) or even whether a proposition was supported by enough\nleading experts to count as probable. On these grounds, some\nperspectival variation became possible. Walter Burley wrote that a\nthing can be probable to one person and improbable to\n another.[46]\n This statement shows that a limited multi-perspectival variety of\nprobability ascriptions was acknowledged in the late Middle Ages.\n",
