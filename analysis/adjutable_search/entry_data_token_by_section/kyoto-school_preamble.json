    "main_text": "\n\nThe Kyoto School (Ky\u014dto-gakuha) is a group of\n20th century Japanese philosophers who drew on the\nintellectual and spiritual traditions of East Asia, those of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in particular, as well as on the methods\nand content of Western philosophy.\n\nAfter an introductory section, this article will focus on four\nquestions: How should the Kyoto School be defined? What is meant by\nits central philosophical concept of \u201cabsolute\nnothingness,\u201d and how did the Kyoto School philosophers\nvariously develop this Eastern inspired idea in dialogue and debate\nwith Western thought and with one another? What are the basics of\ntheir political writings, and the basis of the controversy surrounding\nthem? What is the legacy of the Kyoto School for cross-cultural\nthinking or \u201cworld philosophy\u201d?\n",
