    "main_text": "The New Traditionalism\n8. The New Traditionalism\n\n\nTo this point, we have been primarily concerned to articulate the\nstandard view and lay out the response offered to it by its liberal\ncritics. We have emphasized that there are important differences\nbetween these two views. While not trivial, these differences should\nnot be exaggerated, however. Both views are deeply committed to the\ncore components of liberal democracy, including the protection of\nbasic freedoms such as the freedom to practice religion as one sees\nfit. Furthermore, both views recognize the legitimacy of religious\nreasons in political deliberation, noting the role of such reasons in\nimportant social movements such as the civil rights movement. The main\ndifference between advocates of the standard view and their liberal\ncritics, we've contended, is how they view the\njustificatory role of these reasons. That said, the liberal\ncritics are not the only or even the most influential critics of the\nstandard view. Indeed, if the central argument of Jeffrey Stout's\nbook Democracy and Tradition is correct, the standard view\nhas generated a worrisome backlash among prominent Christian\ntheologians and political theorists. These theologians and political\ntheorists, who Stout labels the New Traditionalists, reject\nnot only the standard view, but also liberal democracy as\nsuch\u2014their assumption being that the standard view is a more or\nless inevitable outgrowth of liberal democracy. In spite of their\nfairly radical position, Stout contends that these thinkers need to be\ntaken seriously by the friends of democracy, as they exercise\nconsiderable influence in certain sectors of the academy and the\nculture at large.\n\n\n Suppose Stout is right to say that\nNew Traditionalists such as John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and\nStanley Hauerwas are widely influential in the academy and\nelsewhere. Should they be taken seriously by political\nphilosophers? That depends on what one understands the role of\npolitical philosophers to be. Suppose, however, we assume that\npolitical philosophers should be multidisciplinary in orientation,\nengaging with what sociologists, psychologists, and theologians write\nand say. If we assume this, then taking a multidisciplinary\napproach in this case seems to make sense. The topic under\nconsideration, after all, is the relation between religion and\npolitics, and theologians have had much to say about their\ninterrelations. Furthermore, while the approach that the New\nTraditionalists take to our topic is different from that taken by the\nadvocates of the standard view\u2014the New Traditionalists tell a\nhistorical narrative about the ills of liberal democracy\u2014the\nnarrative that they tell is a philosophical one. Indeed, it is a\nnarrative whose main lines will be familiar to most philosophers\nworking in ethics and political philosophy. It is natural to want\nto know whether this historical-philosophical narrative survives\nphilosophical scrutiny. We shall close, then, by considering the\nnarrative that the New Traditionalists tell about the emergence of\nmodern liberal democracies, highlighting the response offered to it by\nthe liberal critics.\n",
