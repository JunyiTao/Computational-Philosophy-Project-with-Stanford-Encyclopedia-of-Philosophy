Coase\n(1937, 1960) pioneered the literature on firms in economics. In\n\u201cThe Nature of the Firm\u201d, Coase examines the question of\nwhy firms exist at all: he argues that the function of firms is to\nlower transaction costs that would otherwise have to be incurred in\nforming contracts among individuals. Coase does not distinguish the\nquestion of the function of firms from the question of what firms are.\nBut subsequent work engages more directly with ontological questions,\nincluding eliminativism about firms (Alchian & Demsetz 1972), the\n\u201cnexus of contracts\u201d view (Jensen & Meckling 1976),\nthe \u201cproperty rights\u201d view (Grossman & Hart 1986, Hart\n& Moore 1990), and the \u201cresource view\u201d (Penrose 1959,\nBarney 1991, Conner & Prahalad 1996).\n\nWork on firms is also tied to theories of in institutions in\neconomics, spearheaded by Oliver Williamson, Douglas North, and Elinor\nOstrom. Williamson (1979, 1981, 1996) popularized a Coase-style\napproach with theories of how institutional structures such as\nmarkets, hierarchies, multidivisional corporations, and alliances\nsolve problems of transaction costs. Ostrom\u2019s influential work\non common pool resources treats institutions as sets of rules that\ncommunities put in place in order to change incentives and to induce\nsocially beneficial choices. The \u201cnew institutional\neconomics\u201d program develops this largely game-theoretic\nunderstanding of institutions, tying them to analyses of the nature of\nconventions and norms (see Shepsle 1986; Sugden 1986; North 1990;\nOstrom 1990, 1995; Binmore 1998; Schotter 2008; Guala 2016).\n\nRecent work in organizational sociology also focuses on systems of\nrules, with organizations analyzed in terms of their\n\u201cinstitutionalized\u201d features. Rather than the explicitly\nchosen rules discussed by economists, however, here systems of rules\nare regarded as tacit and non-intentionally followed (Powell &\nDiMaggio 2012). Sociological approaches have been developed for\ninterpreting organizations, largely focused on causal explanations for\ntheir structure, power, and influence. Work on the nature of\norganizations in sociology often involves analyzing them in terms of\nsocial components or properties (see Clegg, Hardy et al. 1996, Scott\n2014).\n",
