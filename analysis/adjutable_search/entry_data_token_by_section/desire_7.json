A desire for tea is a desire for a\ncertain state of affairs one has in mind: that one drink some tea. A\ndesire for a new pair of skates is likewise a desire for another state\nof affairs: that one own a new pair of skates. And so on. This idea is\nalso expressed with phrases such as \u2018desires are attitudes toward\npropositions\u2019 or \u2018desires have propositional\ncontent\u2019. Treating desires in this way makes it easy to see how\nthere could be logical relations between the contents of beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions.\n\n\nA competing way of thinking about desires holds that some or all\ndesires are desires for objects, not states of affairs. A desire for\ntea is simply for tea, not for any state of affairs involving the tea.\nThis competing way of thinking has the advantage that it takes\nseriously the way we ordinarily talk about desires and think about\nthem. It is far more natural to say that I desire tea than to say that\nI desire that I have some tea, and perhaps this naturalness is\nindicative of something deep about the nature of desire. Furthermore,\nit might well seem that non-human animals have desires without being\nable to grasp the propositions a grip on which we so readily attribute\nto human beings (Thagard 2006).\n\n\nA response, though, is that the natural phrasing conceals some of\nthe complexity inherent in desire, and that the non-human animals who\nhave desires have structure to their cognitive capacities that is\nexpressed by talking about propositional content. If Nora desires tea,\nthere is a fact of the matter about which of the following four states\nof affairs is one in which her desire is satisfied:\n\n\n\nNora possesses but does not drink a cup of tea in the near\nfuture.\n\n\nNora possesses but does not drink a cup of tea someday.\n\n\nNora drinks a cup of tea in the near future.\n\n\nNora drinks a cup of tea someday.\n\n\n\nIf it is (3) that would satisfy Nora's desire, then there\nseems much gained and little lost in saying that Nora's desire is\nfor a state of affairs: that she drink a cup of tea in the near future.\nAnd likewise, if an owl desires a vole it seems that there is a fact of\nthe matter about which of the counterpart states of affairs it is that\nwould satisfy the owl's desire (and the counterpart to (3) seems\nmost likely).\n\n\nEven if it is accepted that desires are for conceivable states of\naffairs, there are other complications remaining. Some have pointed to\nthe difficulties of specifying exactly what is desired: even if Nora\nwants to now drink a cup of tea, she might protest that she hasn't\nreceived what she wants if it turns out that the tea is very stale, or\nlaced with arsenic, or brought by a robber, or \u2026 (e.g., Lycan\n2012). Others have pointed to the difficulties generated by\nconditional desires, such as the desire to have beer later if one is\nnot too tired (e.g., McDaniel and Bradley 2008).\n",
