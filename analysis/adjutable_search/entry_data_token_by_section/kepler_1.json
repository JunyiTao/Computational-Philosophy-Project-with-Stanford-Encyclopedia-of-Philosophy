    "main_text": "Philosophy, theology, cosmology\n2. Philosophy, theology, cosmology\n\nThere is probably no such thing as \u201cKepler\u2019s\nphilosophy\u201d in any pure form. Nevertheless, many attempts to\ndeal with the \u201cphilosophy of Kepler\u201d have been made, all\nof which are very valuable in their own way. Some studies have\nconcentrated on a particular text (see, for instance, Jardine 1988,\nfor the Defense of Tycho against Ursus), or have followed\nsome particular ideas of Kepler over a longer period of his life and\nscientific career (see, for instance, Martens 2000, on Kepler\u2019s\ntheory of the archetypes). Others have tried to determine from a\nphilosophical point of view his place in the development of the\nastronomical revolution from the 15th to the\n17th centuries (Koyr\u00e9 1957 and 1961) or in the more\ngeneral context of the scientific movement of the 17th\ncentury (Hall, 1963 and especially Burtt, 1924). Still others have\ndiscussed a long list of philosophical principles operating in\nKepler\u2019s scientific world, and have claimed to have found, by\nmeans of such an analysis, compelling evidence for the interaction\nbetween science, philosophy, and religion (Kozhamthadam, 1994). If, in\nthe particular case of Kepler, philosophy is immediately related to\nastronomy, mathematics and, finally, \u201ccosmology\u201d (a notion\nwhich arises much later), the core of these speculations is to be\nsought in the spectrum of problems with which he dealt in his\nMysterium Cosmographicum and Harmonice Mundi (on\nthis topic, Field 1988 is one of the most representative works on\nKepler). In addition, because of the particular circumstances of his\nlife and his fascinating personality and genius, the literature on\nKepler is extremely wide-ranging, covering a spectrum from literary\npieces like Max Brod\u2019s Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott\n(1915)\u2014though still not free from mistakes concerning\nKepler\u2014to general introductions in the genre of historical\nnovels, and even fictional stories and charlatanry on astrology or,\nrunning for some years now, portraying him as the assassin of Tycho\nBrahe. However, according to recent reports, it is still a matter of\ncontroversy whether Tycho was assassinated at all (see the\n report at phys.org).\n\nKepler mastered, like the best scientists, the most complicated\ntechnical issues, especially in astronomy, but he always emphasized\nhis philosophical, even theological, approach to the questions he\ndealt with: God manifests himself not only in the words of the\nScriptures but also in the wonderful arrangement of the universe and\nin its conformity with the human intellect. Thus, astronomy represents\nfor Kepler, if done philosophically, the best path to God (see\nH\u00fcbner 1975; Methuen 1998 and 2009; Jardine 2009, Kirby 2019). As\nKepler at the core of his greatest astronomical work confesses (AN,\nPart II, chap. 7, KGW 6, p. 108, Engl. trans., p. 183), at the\nbeginning of his career he \u201cwas able to taste the sweetness of\nphilosophy \u2026 with no special interest whatsoever in\nastronomy.\u201d And, even in his later work, after having calculated\nmany ephemerides and different astronomical data, Kepler writes in a\nletter of February 17, 1619 to V. Bianchi: \u201cI also ask you, my\nfriends, that you do not condemn me to the treadmill of mathematical\ncalculations; allow me time for philosophical speculation, my only\ndelight!\u201d (KGW 17, let. N\u00b0 827, p. 327, lin. 249\u2013\n51).\n\nEspecially where Kepler deals with the geometrical structure of the\ncosmos, he always returns to his Platonic and Neoplatonic framework of\nthought. Thus, the polyhedral hypothesis (see Section 3 below) he\npostulated for the first time in his MC represents a kind of\n\u201cformal cause\u201d constituting the foundational structure of\nthe universe. In addition, an \u201cefficient cause,\u201d which\nrealizes this structure in the corporeal world, is also needed. This\nis, of course, God the Creator, who accomplished His work according to\nthe model of the five regular polyhedra. Kepler reinterprets the\ntraditional statements about the Creation as an image of the Creator\ngiving to the ancient ideas a more systematic and a quantitative\ncharacter. Even the doctrine of the Trinity could be geometrically\nrepresented, taking the center for the Father, the spherical surface\nfor the Son, and the intermediate space, which is mathematically\nexpressed in the regularity of the relationship between the point and\nthe surface, for the Holy Spirit. In Kepler\u2019s model, we have to\nbe able to reduce all appearances to straightness and curvature as\nproviding the foundation for the geometrical structure of the\nworld\u2019s creation. The very first category, through which God\nproduced a fundamental similitude of the created World to Himself, is\nthat of quantity (see MC, chapter 2, KGW pp. 23\u201326).\nFurthermore, quantity was also introduced into the human soul for the\nspecific purpose that this fundamental symmetry could be apprehended\nand known scientifically.\n\nThis kind of speculation also belongs to the basic principles of\nKepler\u2019s philosophical optics. In Chapter 1 of APO (\u201cOn\nthe Nature of Light\u201d), Kepler gives a new account of this\n\u201cTrinitarian Cosmogony.\u201d As he admits in a letter to\nThomas Harriot (1560\u20131621), his approach here is more\ntheological than optical (KGW 15, let. 394, p. 348, lin. 18). Similar\nto his speculations in MC, Kepler explains again the symmetry between\nGod and the Creation, but now he goes slightly beyond the limits of a\ntheologico-geometrical reflection. Firstly, he seems to assume that\nthe bodies of the world were provided in the Creation with some powers\nwhich enable them to exceed their geometrical limits and to act on\nother bodies (magnetic power is a good example of this). Secondly, the\nprinciple of symmetry introduced into matter constitutes \u201cthe\nmost excellent thing in the whole corporeal world, the matrix of the\nanimate faculties, and the chain linking the corporeal and spiritual\nworld\u201d (APO, Engl. trans., p. 19). Thirdly, as expressed by\nKepler in a wonderful, long Latin sentence, with multiple\nsubordinations, this principle \u201chas passed over into the same\nlaws (in leges easdem) by which the world was to be\nfurnished\u201d (ibid., p. 20; the original passage is in KGW 2, p.\n19: the marginal note in the edition is \u201clucis\nencomium\u201d). Finally, these reflections are concluded with a\nremark, in which\u2014as with Copernicus, Marsilio Ficino, and\nothers\u2014the central position of the Sun is legitimated because of\nits function in spreading light and, indirectly, life. Similar\nspeculations are still present in EAC (KGW 7, pp. 47\u201348 and\n267). It is also worth noting that these speculations are of vital\nimportance to the special way in which Kepler conceived of astrology\n(see, for instance, De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus\nwith Engl. trans. and commentary in Field 1984).\n",
