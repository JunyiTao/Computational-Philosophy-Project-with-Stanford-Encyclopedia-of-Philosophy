    "main_text": "Critiques of Rights || Critiques of Rights Doctrine\n7.2 Critiques of the Language of Rights\n\nThe language of rights can resist the charge that it is necessarily\ncomplicit with individualism. However, critics have accused rights\ntalk of impeding social progress:\n\n\nOur rights talk, in its absoluteness promotes unrealistic\nexpectations, heightens social conflict, and inhibits dialogue that\nmight lead toward consensus, accommodation, or at least the discovery\nof common ground. In its silence concerning responsibilities, it seems\nto condone acceptance of the benefits of living in a democratic social\nwelfare state, without accepting the corresponding personal and civic\nobligations\u2026. In its insularity, it shuts out potentially\nimportant aids to the process of self-correcting learning. All of\nthese traits promote mere assertion over reason-giving.\n\n\nGlendon (1991, 14) here draws out some of the detrimental practical\nconsequences of the connection between rights and conclusive reasons\nthat we saw above. Since rights assertions suggest conclusive reasons,\npeople can be tempted to assert rights when they want to end a\ndiscussion instead of continuing it. One plays a right as a trump card\nwhen one has run out of arguments. Similarly, the ready availability\nof rights language may lead parties initially at odds with each other\ntoward confrontation instead of negotiation, as each side escalates an\narms-race of rights assertions that can only be resolved by a superior\nauthority like a court. One line of feminist theory has picked up on\nthis line of criticism, identifying the peremptory and rigidifying\ndiscourse of rights with the confrontational masculine\n\u201cvoice\u201d (Gilligan 1993).\n\nIt is not inevitable that these unfortunate tendencies will afflict\nthose who make use of the language of rights. As we have seen, it may\nbe plausible to hold that each right is \u201cabsolute\u201d only\nwithin an elaborately gerrymandered area. And it may be possible to\nproduce deep theories to justify why one has the rights that one\nasserts. However, it is plausible that the actual use of rights talk\ndoes have the propensities that Glendon suggests. It seems no accident\nthat America, \u201cthe land of rights,\u201d is also the land of\nlitigation.\n\nAnother deleterious consequence of rights talk that Glendon picks out\nis its tendency to move the moral focus toward persons as\nrightholders, instead of toward persons as bearers of\nresponsibilities. This critique is developed by O\u2019Neill (1996,\n127\u201353; 2002, 27\u201334). A focus on rightholders steers moral\nreasoning toward the perspective of recipience, instead of toward the\ntraditional active ethical questions of what one ought to do and how\none ought to live. Rights talk also leads those who use it to neglect\nimportant virtues such as courage and beneficence, which are duties to\nwhich no rights correspond. Finally, the use of rights language\nencourages people to make impractical demands, since one can assert a\nright without attending to the desirability or even the possibility of\nburdening others with the corresponding obligations.\n\nCriticisms such as O\u2019Neill\u2019s do not target the language of\nrights as a whole. They aim squarely at the passive rights, and\nespecially at claim-rights, instead of at the active privileges and\npowers. Nevertheless, it is again plausible that the spread of rights\ntalk has encouraged the tendencies that these criticisms suggest. The\nmodern discourse of rights is characteristically deployed by those who\nsee themselves or others as potential recipients, entitled to insist\non certain benefits or protections.\n\nDescribing fundamental norms in terms of rights has benefits as well\nas dangers (Schneider 1986, Ackerly 2013). The language of rights can\ngive precise expression to elaborate structures of freedom and\nauthority. When embodied in particular doctrines, such as in the\ninternational human rights documents, the language of rights can\nexpress in accessible terms the standards for minimally acceptable\ntreatment that individuals can demand from those with power over them.\nRights are also associated with historical movements for greater\nliberty and equality, so assertions of rights in pursuit of justice\ncan carry a resonance that other appeals lack. Whether these benefits\nof using rights language overbalance the hazards remains a live\nquestion in moral, political, and legal theory.\n",
