Her conduct was caused by unreflective valuings.\n(In reality, Dewey stressed, hardly any of the valuings of adults are\nwholly primitive, as the valuings of infants are. So the illustration\nis only of a relatively unreflective valuing, one that incorporates a\nrelatively low level of understanding of the consequences of acting on\nit.) When she became aware of the fact that her consumption of ice\ncream was causing a problem, she investigated the problem,\narticulating its contours, with the aim of solving it, of finding some\nalternative that would \u201cwork,\u201d in the sense of enabling\nthe satisfactory resumption of activity. \u201cWorking\u201d need\nnot mean finding an alternative means to resuming the same valued\nactivity. Her activity has changed: now she aims to consume\nlactose-free ice cream. Her valuation activity has changed\nboth in the object toward which it is directed, and in its cognitive\ncharacter: it embodies an articulate understanding of what she is\ngoing after, which reflects her appraisals of its merits.\n\nThe result of such appraisal is the adoption of an end-in-view, the\ninstitution of a desire. Dewey\u2019s term\n\u201cdesire\u201d is closer to our \u201cintention\u201d or\n\u201cpurpose\u201d or even \u201cplan\u201d (TV 238) in denoting\na tendency toward action that the agent has adopted, rather than\nsimply a motive clamoring for our attention or moving us behind our\nbacks. Desire denotes a reflective, conscious valuing, not a mere\n\u201caffective-motor\u201d attitude, but an\n\u201caffective-ideational-motor activity,\u201d a\n\u201cunion of prizing and appraising\u201d (TV 218). It is a\ncognitive state. As the individual engages this new valuation, she\nexperiences the consequences of acting on it. Reflection upon these\nconsequences is then incorporated into more intelligent valuations, by\nway of further appraisals. The result of criticism is the refinement\nof taste \u2014 that is, a \u201crational liking\u201d (VEK 15), a\n\u201cliking for a reason\u201d (VORC 95). The novice and the\nconnoisseur may both value (like) the same object. But the latter has\na reflective and articulate grasp of the features of the object that\nare liked, plus enough experience with valuations of objects of that\ntype to have warranted confidence that these features merit liking.\nThat is, the connoisseur has enough experience to warrant confidence\nthat there are not further features of the object or consequences of\nvaluing it which, once appreciated, would reverse or detract from the\nliking. Desires (ends-in-view) do not exist in isolation from each\nother. We reflect on the consequences of attempting to jointly satisfy\nour desires. Appraisals of such consequences serve to modify desires\nso that they are coordinated with one another. Dewey called such\nsystematically coordinated desires \u201cinterests\u201d (TV\n207).\n",
