    "main_text": "What is Digital Art? || Digital Art: Presentation\n1.4 Digital Art: Presentation\n\nThe media theorists\u2019 worry about the impoverished digital image\nprimarily refers to the production of digital images with its\nreliance on sampling and quantization. But there are also analogous\nworries about the digital presentation of images, worries\nabout deep structural changes to analog images once they are displayed\ndigitally\u2014for example, on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen\nor when projected digitally on a flat surface. Of course one could\nsimply be interested in investigating these structural changes without\nbeing particularly worried about them. This shall be our approach.\n\nThe traditional method of film reel projection has been a remarkably\nstable and entrenched technology, remaining largely unchanged for over\na century. But digital projection has almost taken over, particularly\nin conjunction with the networked distribution of films. Although\nfilms\u2019 audiences may not be able to see the difference on screen\nbetween analog and digital projection, their expectations are\nchanging\u2014for example, about what can go wrong in the\npresentation of a film. A deeper assumption that has not changed, one\nthat is almost universal among film scholars, is that films\nfundamentally depend on an illusion. Cinema is the art of moving\nimages and thus its very existence depends on our being tricked into\nseeing a rapid succession of static images as a persistent moving\nimage. In the philosophy of film, there is a small debate about the\nstatus of cinematic motion\u2014whether it really is an illusion as\ncommonly assumed. An analysis of digital projection technology reveals\nnew complexities in this debate but ultimately provides additional\nreasons to stick with the popular illusionist view.\n\nTraditional and digital projection methods could not seem more\ndifferent: the former involves running a flexible film strip through a\nmechanical projector; the latter involves a complex array of\nmicromirrors on semiconductor chips, which, in combination with a\nprism and a lamp, generate projectable images from binary code.\nNevertheless, both are methods for generating the impression of a\ncontinuously illuminated, persistent moving image from a sequence of\nstatic images. Compared with traditional projection, however, digital\nprojection includes an extra step, whereby the images in the static\nsequence are generated from flashes of light. In order to generate\neach image in the digital projector, a light beam from a high-powered\nlamp is separated by a prism into its color components of red, blue,\nand green. Each color beam then hits a different Digital Micromirror\nDevice (DMD), which is a semiconductor chip covered with more than a\nmillion tiny, hinged mirrors. Based on the information encoded in the\nvideo signal, the DMDs selectively turn over some of the tiny mirrors\nto reflect the colored lights. Most of the tiny mirrors are flipped\nthousands of times a second in order to create the gradations of light\nand dark making up a monochromatic, pixellated image\u2014a mirror\nthat is flipped on a greater proportion of the time will reflect more\nlight and so will form a brighter pixel than a mirror that is not\nflipped on for so long. Each DMD reflects a monochromatic image back\nto the prism, which then recombines the colors to form the projected,\nfull-color image. This image\u2014if it were held for long enough on\nthe screen\u2014would be perceived as static. In order then to\nproduce the impression of motion in the projected, full-color image,\nthe underlying memory array of the DMDs has to update rapidly so that\nall the micromirrors are released simultaneously and allowed to move\ninto a new \u201caddress state\u201d, providing new patterns of\nlight modulation for successive images.\n\nThe two-stage process of digital projection, by which the moving image\nis created from a succession of static images that are themselves\ncreated by motion, draws attention to the metaphysical complexity of\nthe question of how movies move. In particular, one is unlikely to\ndetermine the status of the impression of motion that makes possible\nthe art of cinema unless one can determine the status of the imagery\nthat is seen to move. Given that motion involves an object occupying\ncontiguous spatial locations in successive moments of time, a moving\nobject must be re-identifiable over time. A moving image in a film,\narising as it does out of the rapid display of a succession of still\nimages, is not obviously a persistent object that can be seen to move.\nThen again, perhaps it is enough that ordinary viewers identify an\nimage\u2014say of a moving train\u2014 as the same image, for the\nmoving image to persist (Currie 1996). Alternatively, the moving image\ncould be thought to persist as a second-order physical entity\nconstituted by a sequence of flashing lights (Ponech 2006).\n\nThe second proposal immediately runs into trouble with digital\nprojection. If the traditionally projected moving image exists as a\nseries of flashes of light, in digital projection, other\n\u201cintermediate\u201d objects must be granted existence\u2014for\nexample, the stable point of light consisting of the rate of flashes,\nand gaps between them, of a single micromirror on the DMD. At the same\ntime, the moving image itself must be stripped of its existence since\nit does not consist of flashes of light. This is due to the fact that,\nin digital projection, there are no gaps between frames and so no\nunderlying, imperceptible alternation of light and dark. This leaves\nthe realist in the awkward position of claiming that the moving image\ngoes in and out of existence with the switch between analog and\ndigital projection technologies.\n\nThe first proposal, on which cinematic motion is a secondary quality,\nthreatens to destroy the distinction between the apparent and the\nillusory. It suggests a way of reinterpreting any case of perceptual\nillusion as a case involving the ascription of secondary qualities.\nThat is, unless it can be shown that there are independent means of\nchecking that we are mistaken about genuine illusions. But even if\nthis can be shown, a problem remains: While there may not be an\nindependent check for the motion of an image, there is likewise no\nindependent check for a genuine illusion of color. Given the contrived\nconditions of film viewing, there is more reason to think of cinematic\nmotion as akin to an illusory, than to a genuine, experience of color.\nWith the introduction of digital projection, the conditions are\narguably even more contrived. For it is not just movement in the image\nbut the image itself that is constituted by rapid flashes of light.\nAnd the technology involved is far less accessible than that of a\ntraditional mechanical projector in the sense that one cannot, just by\nlooking at the projection device, see (roughly) how it works. In this\nway, an analysis of digital movie projection serves to reinforce the\ntraditional assumption that cinema is an art of illusion. In addition,\nhowever, the analysis suggests that the illusion at the heart of\ncinema is particularly impenetrable\u2014akin to an illusion of\ncolor, and thus an illusion of a mere appearance that cannot be\nchecked (Thomson-Jones 2013).\n",
