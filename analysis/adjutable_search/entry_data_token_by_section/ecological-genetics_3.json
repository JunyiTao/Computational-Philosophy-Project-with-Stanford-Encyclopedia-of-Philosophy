    "main_text": "The Sewall Wright Effect\n4. The Sewall Wright Effect\n\nSeveral wing coloration variants segregating in a small natural\npopulation of the moth, Panaxia dominula (Fisher & Ford\n1947), were investigated using mark-recapture in one of the longest\ncontinuous studies of a single population in all of evolutionary\nresearch. The goal of Fisher and Ford was to determine whether\nyear-to-year fluctuations in the frequency of the variants\n(medionigra, a heterozygote, and bimaculata, a\nhomozygote) were better explained by natural selection or by random\ngenetic drift. (Banding patterns in the snail, Cepea\nnermoralis\u00b8were the topic of similar discussions of the\nrelative roles of natural selection and genetic drift [Cain &\nShephard 1954; Cain & Provine 1992; Millstein 2008, 2009].) They\ninferred from their analysis\n\n\nThe conclusion that natural populations in general, like that to which\nthis study is devoted, are affected by selective action, varying from\ntime to time in direction and intensity and of sufficient magnitude to\ncause fluctuating variations in all gene frequencies is in good\naccordance with other studies of observable frequencies in wild\npopulations. \u2026 We do not think, however, that it has been\nsufficiently emphasized that this fact is fatal to the theory which\nascribes particular evolutionary importance to such fluctuations in\ngene ratios as may occur by chance in very small isolated populations.\n\u2026\n\nThus our analysis, the first in which the relative parts played by\nrandom survival and selection in a wild population can be tested, does\nnot support the view that chance fluctuations can be of any\nsignificance in evolution. (Fisher & Ford 1947: 171, 172; quoted\nin Provine 1986: 423)\n\n\nWith this paper, Fisher and Ford moved the long-standing debate\nbetween Wright and Fisher over the relative roles of natural selection\nand random genetic drift in evolution from theory to nature. It is\nremarkable that, in the first such study with only eight years of\nobservations on a single locus with alternative alleles, they are\nconfident in rejecting Wright\u2019s theory and random genetic drift\nin its entirety.\n\nIn his response to their analyses, Wright (1948) pointed out, first,\nthat his theory of evolution explicitly involved the simultaneous\naction of several forces (selection, drift, mutation, and migration)\nand he emphatically rejected the paradigm of Fisher and Ford that\neither selection or drift alone had to be responsible for all\nof the observed fluctuation in gene frequencies (see the entry on\n population genetics).\n Wright noted that, in order to reach their statistical conclusion,\nFord and Fisher had to include gene frequency data from a decade\nbefore the more careful study, notably a period without any estimates\nof population size. Without this earlier data point, the average\nfluctuations were much smaller and not significant. He pointed out\nthat, like the mark-recapture estimates of population numbers, the\ngene frequencies themselves were estimates whose variation, based on\nthe reported sample sizes, accounted for more than half (55.2%) of the\nobserved variance that Fisher and Ford were trying to explain. He then\nshowed that, if one assumed only the unitary explanation of natural\nselection, then the observed gene frequency fluctuations were so large\neven without the sampling variance that the temporal\nvariations in the allelic selection coefficients must range from near\nlethality (or sterility) to tremendous advantage (i.e., from\n\u22120.50 to +0.50). However, Fisher and Ford (1947) provided no\nindication of comparable levels of temporal variation in any\nenvironmental factor acting as a selective agent. Wright argued that\nthe effective population sizes used in the analysis were almost\ncertainly too large, possibly by an order of magnitude, and that\nFisher and Ford had made no attempt to estimate the factors expected\nto reduce effective size, like temporal variation in breeding numbers,\nnon-random mortality among larvae (mortality clustered within families\nas might affect a species which experiences > 85% pupal mortality\nowing to viral infection), or other causes of the variance in\noffspring numbers (such as variation among females in egg numbers or\nvariation among males in mate numbers). In an unyielding reply, Fisher\nand Ford (1950) labeled chance or random fluctuations in gene\nfrequency, the Sewall Wright Effect, a term which has endured\nto the present day as a synonym for random genetic drift.\n\nWith a larger data set covering several more years, Ford (1975: 146)\nrevisited this exchange and argued that Wright remained wrong on each\ncount. Ford also showed that the selective advantage for the rarer of\nthe genes varied widely, from \u22120.10 to +0.20, and that there was\nno evidence of heterozygote advantage. He did not find, however, the\nexpected negative correlation between strength of selection and\npopulation size in these data. In the intervening decades, data from a\nvariety of other organisms and natural population had become available\nand its review led Ford to conclude: \n\n\nAs a result, it is no longer possible to attribute to random genetic\ndrift or to mutation any significant part in the control of evolution.\n(1975: 389) \n\n\nThus, throughout its founding period, ecological genetics was\nrelentlessly supportive of natural selection as unitary explanation\nfor evolutionary change. (Later laboratory research has shown that the\nexpression of the color patterns is sensitive or plastic to the\nthermal environment during development and thus the gene frequency\nestimates may be subject to significant measurement error, owing to\nthe misclassification of genotypes. This is yet another source of\nvariation, not accounted for in the Ford analyses. It tends to weaken\nthe link between genotype and phenotype and thereby weaken the\nrelationship between selection acting on phenotypes and the underlying\ngenotypes. In addition, empirical evidence has found, as Wright\nexpected, that temporal fluctuations in population size, large\nvariance among females in fecundity, and sexual selection reduce the\neffective number to less than half the Fisher-Ford estimate. In\naddition, more careful studies have reduced Ford\u2019s estimates of\nthe magnitude of the average genic selection coefficient by about two\nthirds [see Cook & Jones 1996].)\n",
