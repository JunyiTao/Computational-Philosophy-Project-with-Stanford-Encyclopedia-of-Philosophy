    "main_text": "Answering the Identification Question || Manipulation as Trickery\n2.2 Manipulation as Trickery\n\nA second approach to manipulation treats it as a form of trickery, and\nties it conceptually to deception. The connection between manipulation\nand deception is a common theme in both non-philosophical and\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation. In his 1980 book\nManipulatory Politics, Robert Goodin argues that manipulation\nis inherently deceptive, and offers this test for whether an influence\nis manipulative: \u201c1. Is the interference deceptive? 2. Is the\ninterference contrary to the putative will of those subject to\nit?\u201d (Goodin, 1980: 35). In the literature on advertising, the\ncharge that (at least some) advertising is manipulative often rests on\nthe claim that it creates false beliefs or misleading associations\n(e.g., linking the vitality of the Marlboro man to a product which\ncauses lung cancer). Similarly, in his discussion of promises, T. M.\nScanlon condemns manipulation as a means of inducing false beliefs and\nexpectations (Scanlon 1998: 298\u2013322). Shlomo Cohen offers a\nsomewhat different account of the relationship between manipulation\nand deception, according to which the distinction lies in the methods\nby which the target is induced to adopt a false belief (Cohen 2018).\nBut even on this more nuanced view, there is still a strong connection\nbetween manipulation and deception.\n\nOther views in this family treat manipulation as a broader category of\nwhich deception is a special case. Whereas deception is the deliberate\nattempt to trick someone into adopting a faulty belief, these versions\nof the trickery account see manipulation as the deliberate attempt to\ntrick someone into adopting any faulty mental state\u2014belief,\ndesire, emotion, etc.\n\nAn early example of this version of the trickery approach to\nmanipulation can be found in a 1980 paper by Vance Kasten, who writes\nthat\n\n\nmanipulation occurs when there is a difference in kind between what\none intends to do and what one actually does, when that difference is\ntraceable to another in such a way that the victim may be said to have\nbeen misled. (Kasten 1980: 54)\n\n\nAlthough many of Kasten\u2019s examples of misleading involve\ndeception, he also includes examples in which manipulation involves\ninducing the target to have inappropriate emotions like guilt. More\nrecently, Robert Noggle has defended a version of this more expansive\napproach, writing that\n\n\nThere are certain norms or ideals that govern beliefs, desires, and\nemotions. Manipulative action is the attempt to get someone\u2019s\nbeliefs, desires, or emotions to violate these norms, to fall short of\nthese ideals. (Noggle 1996: 44)\n\n\nThe norms or ideals in question will vary by mental state: a belief\nfalls short of its ideal if it is false; a pattern of attention falls\nshort of its ideal if excessive attention is being paid to something\nless relevant for choice at hand; an emotion falls short of its ideal\nif it is not appropriate to the situation (Noggle 1996: 44\u201347).\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Anne Barnhill writes that\n\n\nmanipulation is directly influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, desires,\nor emotions such that she falls short of ideals for belief, desire, or\nemotion in ways typically not in her self-interest or likely not\nin her self-interest in the present context. (Barnhill 2014: 73,\nemphasis original; for a similar view, see Hanna 2015)\n\n\nClaudia Mills offers a theory that can be considered as either a\nversion of, or a close relative to, the trickery account:\n\n\nWe might say, then, that manipulation in some way purports to be\noffering good reasons, when in fact it does not. A manipulator tries\nto change another\u2019s beliefs and desires by offering her bad\nreasons, disguised as good, or faulty arguments, disguised as\nsound\u2014where the manipulator himself knows these to be bad\nreasons and faulty arguments (Mills 1995: 100; see Benn 1967 and Gorin\n2014b for somewhat similar ideas).\n\n\nA similar picture of manipulation emerges from the work of the\npolitical theorist Keith Dowding (2016, 2018). Dowding does not\nattempt to characterize manipulation directly. Rather, he proposes\nideal conditions for persuasion in a deliberative\ndemocracy\u2014conditions that would exclude manipulation. These\nconditions prohibit appealing to reasons that the persuader does not\naccept, and appealing to emotions that the persuader does not share.\nThese prohibitions seem to suggest a characterization of manipulation\nas the attempt to influence the target by appealing to what the\nmanipulator sees as bad reasons or inappropriate emotions. This\npicture of manipulation is either a version of, or a close cousin to,\nthe picture of the manipulator as trying to trick the target into\nmaking choices based on faulty beliefs or inappropriate emotions.\n\nThus, while all versions of the trickery view retain the connection\nbetween manipulation and deception, some extend it to include tricking\nthe target into adopting any faulty mental state, including\nbeliefs, desires, emotions, etc. This view might be further expanded\nby adopting Michael Cholbi\u2019s observation that the phenomenon of\nego depletion might induce targets of manipulation to form faulty\nintentions (that is, intentions that do not reflect their considered\nvalues) because their resistance to temptation has been worn down\n(Cholbi 2014).\n\nThe trickery view can be motivated by appeal to various examples, one\nespecially fruitful set of which is Shakespeare\u2019s\nOthello. It seems natural to describe Shakespeare\u2019s\ncharacter Iago as a manipulator. The activities in virtue of which he\nmerits this label seem to involve various forms of trickery. For\nexample, through insinuation, innuendo and cleverly arranging\ncircumstances (like a strategically placed handkerchief) he tricks\nOthello into suspecting\u2014and then believing\u2014that his new\nbride Desdemona has been unfaithful. He then plays on Othello\u2019s\ninsecurities and other emotions to lead him into an irrational\njealousy and rage that both overshadow his love for Desdemona and\ncloud his judgment about how to react. The trickery view accounts for\nour sense that Iago manipulates Othello by noting that Iago tricks him\ninto adopting various faulty mental states\u2014false beliefs,\nunwarranted suspicions, irrational emotions, and so on.\n\nProponents of the trickery view disagree over several details, most\nnotably how to define a faulty mental state. Some proponents\nof the trickery view argue that manipulation occurs when the\ninfluencer attempts to induce what the influencer regards as\na faulty mental state into the target\u2019s deliberations (Mills\n1995; Noggle 1996; this idea is built into Dowding\u2019s account).\nOthers argue that we should define manipulation in terms of the\nattempt to introduce an objectively faulty mental state into\nthe target\u2019s deliberations (Hanna 2015: 634; see also Sunstein\n2016: 89). Anne Barnhill suggests that our usage of the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d is inconsistent on the question of whose\nstandards determine whether the influencer attempts to induce the\ntarget to adopt a faulty mental state (Barnhill 2014).\n\nAlthough the trickery account has considerable appeal, it faces an\nimportant challenge: It apparently fails to count as manipulative a\nwhole class of tactics that seem, intuitively, to be manipulative.\nTactics like charm, peer pressure, and emotional blackmail (tactics 1,\n5, and 9) do not seem to involve trickery. Yet it seems quite natural\nto regard them as examples of manipulation.\n",
