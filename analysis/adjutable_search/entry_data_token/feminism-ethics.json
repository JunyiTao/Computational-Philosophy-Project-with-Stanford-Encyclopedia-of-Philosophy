More specifically, feminist ethicists aim to\nunderstand, criticize, and correct: (1) the binary view of gender, (2)\nthe privilege historically available to men, and/or (3) the ways that\nviews about gender maintain oppressive social orders or practices that\nharm others, especially girls and women who historically have been\nsubordinated, along gendered dimensions including sexuality and\ngender-identity. Since oppression often involves ignoring the\nperspectives of the marginalized, different approaches to feminist\nethics have in common a commitment to better understand the\nexperiences of persons oppressed in gendered ways. That commitment\nresults in a tendency, in feminist ethics, to take into account\nempirical information and material actualities.\n\nNot all feminist ethicists correct all of (1) through (3). Some have\nassumed or upheld the gender binary (Wollstonecraft 1792; Firestone\n1970). They criticize and aim to correct the privileging of men as the\nmore morally worthy half of the binary, or argue against the\nmaintenance of a social order that oppresses others in gendered ways.\nMore recently, feminist ethicists have commonly criticized the gender\nbinary itself, arguing that upholding a fixed conception of the world\nas constituted only by \u201cbiological\u201d men and women\ncontributes to the maintenance of oppressive and gendered social\norders, especially when doing so marginalizes those who do not conform\nto gender binaries (Butler 1990; Bettcher 2014; Dea 2016a). Feminist\nethicists who are attentive to the intersections of multiple aspects\nof identity including race, class, and disability, in addition to\ngender, criticize and correct assumptions that men\nsimpliciter are historically privileged, as if privilege\ndistributes equally among all men regardless of how they are socially\nsituated. They instead focus more on criticizing and correcting\noppressive practices that harm and marginalize others who live at\nthese intersections in order to account for the distinctive\nexperiences of women whose experiences are not those of members of\nculturally dominant groups (Crenshaw 1991; Khader 2013). Whatever the\nfocus of feminist ethicists, a widely shared characteristic of their\nworks is at least some overt attention to power, privilege, or limited\naccess to social goods. In a broad sense, then, feminist ethics is\nfundamentally political (Tong 1993, 160). This is not necessarily a\nfeature of feminist ethics that distinguishes it from\n\u201cmainstream\u201d ethics, however, since feminist analyses of\nethical theory as arising from material and nonideal contexts suggest\nthat all ethics is political whether its being so is recognized by the\ntheorist or not.\n\nSince feminist ethics is not merely a branch of ethics, but is instead\n\u201ca way of doing ethics\u201d (Lindemann 2005, 4),\nphilosophers engaged in the above tasks can be concerned with any\nbranch of ethics, including meta-ethics, normative theory, and\npractical or applied ethics. The point of feminist ethics is, ideally,\nto change ethics for the better by improving ethical theorizing and\noffering better approaches to issues including those involving gender.\nFeminist ethics is not limited to gendered issues because the insights\nof feminist ethics are often applicable to analyses of moral\nexperiences that share features with gendered issues or that reflect\nthe intersection of gender with other bases of oppression. Feminist\nphilosophical endeavors include bringing investigations motivated by\nfeminist ethics to bear on ethical issues, broadly conceived.\n", "toc": [{"#FemiEthiHistBack": "1.

Feminist Ethics: Historical Background\n\nFeminist ethics as an academic area of study in the field of\nphilosophy dates to the 1970s, when philosophical journals started\nmore frequently publishing articles specifically concerned with\nfeminism and sexism (Korsmeyer 1973; Rosenthal 1973; Jaggar 1974), and\nafter curricular programs of Women\u2019s Studies began to be\nestablished in some universities (Young 1977; Tuana 2011). Readers\ninterested in themes evident in the fifty years of feminist ethics in\nphilosophy will find this discussion in section (2) below,\n\u201cThemes in Feminist Ethics.\u201d\n\nPrior to 1970, \u201cthere was no recognized body of feminist\nphilosophy\u201d (Card 2008, 90). Of course, throughout history,\nphilosophers have attempted to understand the roles that gender may\nplay in moral life. Yet such philosophers presumably were addressing\nmale readers, and their accounts of women\u2019s moral capacities did\nnot usually aim to disrupt the subordination of women. Rarely in the\nhistory of philosophy will one find philosophical works that notice\ngender in order to criticize and correct men\u2019s historical\nprivileges or to disrupt the social orders and practices that\nsubordinate groups on gendered dimensions. An understanding that sex\nmatters to one\u2019s ethical theorizing in some way is necessary to,\nbut not sufficient for, feminist ethics.\n\nSome philosophers and writers in almost every century, however,\nconstitute forerunners to feminist ethics. Representative authors\nwriting in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries\ndiscussed below explicitly address what they perceive to be moral\nwrongs resulting from either oppression on the basis of sex, or\nmetaethical errors on the part of public intellectuals in believing\nideal forms of moral reasoning to be within the capacities of men and\nnot women. In the early-to-mid-twentieth century, at the same time\nthat feminism became a more popularly used term in Europe and\nthe Americas, more theorists argued influentially for ending unjust\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. Some authors concertedly argued\nthat philosophers and theorists erred in their understanding of what\nseemed to be gendered differences in ethical and moral reasoning.\n1.1 Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Forerunners of Feminist Ethics\n\nIn the seventeenth century, some public intellectuals published\ntreatises arguing that women were as rational as men and should be\nafforded the education that would allow them to develop their moral\ncharacter. They argued that since females are rational, their unequal\naccess to learning was immoral and unjustifiable. They explored\nmeta-ethical questions about the preconditions for morality, including\nwhat sorts of agents can be moral and whether morality is equally\npossible for different sexes. For example, in 1694, Mary\nAstell\u2019s first edition of A Serious Proposal to the Ladies\nfor the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest was\npublished, advocating for access to education. It was controversial\nenough that Astell issued a sequel three years later, A Serious\nProposal, Part II, that challenged \u201cthose deep background\nphilosophical and theological assumptions which deny women the\ncapacity for improvement of the mind\u201d (Springborg,\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d in Astell 2002, 21). At the time, some\napparently attributed the first Serious Proposal not to\nAstell, but to Damaris Cudworth Masham, a one-time companion of John\nLocke, since such criticisms of the injustice of women\u2019s lot and\nthe background assumptions maintaining their subordinate situation\nwere familiar to Masham (Springborg, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d in\nAstell 2002, 17). Although Masham sharply disagreed with aspects of\nAstell\u2019s work, she too would later come to be credited with\n\u201cexplicitly feminist claims,\u201d including objections to\n\u201cthe inferior education accorded women\u201d (Frankel 1989,\n84), especially when such obstacles were due to \u201cthe ignorance\nof men\u201d (Masham 1705, 169, quoted in Frankel 1989, 85). Masham\nalso deplored \u201cthe double standard of morality imposed on women\nand men, especially \u2026 the claim that women's\n\u2018virtue\u2019 consists primarily in chastity\u201d (Frankel\n1989, 85).\n\nA century later, Mary Wollstonecraft, in her Vindication of the\nRights of Women ([1792] 1988), renewed attention to girls\u2019\nlack of access to education. Criticizing the philosophical assumptions\nunderpinning practices that denied girls adequate education,\nWollstonecraft articulated an Enlightenment ideal of the social and\nmoral rights of women as the equal of men. Wollstonecraft also\nbroadened her critique of social structures to encompass ethical\ntheory, especially in resistance to the arguments of influential men\nthat women\u2019s virtues are different from men\u2019s and\nappropriate to perceived feminine duties. Wollstonecraft asserted:\n\u201cI here throw down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual\nvirtues,\u201d adding that \u201cwomen, I allow, may have different\nduties to fulfil; but they are human duties, and the\nprinciples that should regulate the discharge of them \u2026 must be\nthe same\u201d (51). The revolutions of the Enlightenment age\nmotivated some men as well as women to reconsider inequities in\neducation at a time when notions of universal human rights were\ngaining prominence. As Joan Landes observes,\nMarie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet was an\nextraordinary advocate for the rights of women in France during the\nsame period who argued in 1790 for \u201cthe admission of women to\nthe rights of citizenship\u201d and \u201cwoman's equal humanity on\nthe grounds of reason and justice\u201d (Landes 2016). Like many\ntheorists of their time and places, including Catherine Macaulay\n(Tomaselli 2016), Olympe de Gouges, and Madame de Sta\u00ebl (Landes\n2016), Wollstonecraft and Condorcet granted that there were material\ndifferences between the sexes, but advanced moral arguments against\nethical double-standards on the basis of universal humanism. Yet the\nnotion of universal humanism tended to prioritize virtues\ntraditionally seen as masculine. Wollstonecraft, for example, argued\nagainst perceptions that women lacked men\u2019s capacities for\nmorality, but praised rationality and \u201cmasculinity\u201d as\npreconditions for morality (Tong 1993, 44). \n1.2 Nineteenth-Century Influences and Issues\n\nIn Europe and North America, nineteenth-century moral arguments\ncoalesced around material issues that would later be appreciated by\nfeminist ethicists as importantly intersecting. A remarkably diverse\narray of activist women and public intellectuals advanced recognizably\nfeminist arguments for women\u2019s moral leadership and greater\nfreedoms as moral imperatives. The resistance of enslaved women and\nthe political activism of their descendants, the anti-slavery\norganizations of women in Europe and North America, the attention to\ninequity in women\u2019s access to income, property, sexual freedom,\nfull citizenship, and enfranchisement, and the rise of Marxist and\nSocialist theories contributed to women\u2019s participation in\narguments for the reductions of militarism, unfettered capitalism,\ndomestic violence and the related abuse of drugs and alcohol, among\nother concerns.\n\nOffering the first occurrence of the term feminisme (Offen\n1988), the nineteenth century is characterized by a plurality of\napproaches to protofeminist ethics, that is, ethical theorizing that\nanticipated and created the groundwork for modern feminist concepts.\nThese include some theories consistent with the universal humanism of\nWollstonecraft and Condorcet and others emphasizing the differences\nbetween the sexes in order to argue for the superiority of feminine\nmorality. The most well-known of the former in philosophy are John\nStuart Mill\u2019s The Subjection of Women ([1869] 1987),\nwhich he credits Harriet Taylor Mill with co-authoring, and Harriet\nTaylor Mill\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Enfranchisement of Women\u201d\n(H. T. Mill [1851] 1998). Like their Enlightenment forerunners, Mill\nand Taylor argue that women ought to have equal rights and equal\naccess to political and social opportunities. As a utilitarian\nphilosopher, Mill further emphasizes the benefits to society and to\nthe human species of improving women\u2019s lives and social\nsituations. Mill expresses skepticism about claims that women are\nmorally superior to men, as well as claims that women have\n\u201cgreater liability to moral bias,\u201d emotionality, and poor\njudgment in ethical decision-making ([1869] 1987, 518 and 519). Mill\nand Taylor tend to overemphasize the roles of women who are wives.\nThey grant some differences between men and women that are\ncontroversial today; Mill\u2019s works especially emphasize the\nbenefits to family and domestic life as reasons to support the\nliberation of women from subjugation. Despite these views, both argue\nfor the benefits of women\u2019s liberation to scholarly and\npolitical spheres. For example, they describe differences in\nachievement and behavior to be the result mainly of women\u2019s\nsocial situations and education, making their view consistent with the\narguments of both the Enlightenment scholars noted above, and some,\nbut not all, of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors\ndiscussed below.\n\nAttitudes about the reasons for the moral goodness of such\nachievements differed. Some early utopian and Socialist movements in\nEurope that influenced women\u2019s rights activists in America and\nwould later influence British thinkers, including John Stuart Mill,\nlauded feminine virtues and women\u2019s importance, but did so in\nways that would reinforce views of women as \u201csuperior\u201d\nbecause of innate qualities of gentleness, love, spirituality, and\nsentimentality (Moses 1982). In contrast, other Socialist movements\nexpressed radical views of the equality of men and women not by\nattributing distinctive or greater moral virtues to women, but by\nchallenging systems of privilege due to sex, race, and class (Taylor\n1993). Although Mill and Taylor would later argue that \u201csexual\ninequality is an impediment to the cultivation of moral virtue,\u201d\nsome American activists such as Catherine Beecher forwarded a\n\u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d vision of men and women as\npsychologically and essentially different, a view \u201caccording to\nwhich female virtue is ultimately better than male virtue\u201d (Tong\n1993, 36 and 37). In the pivotal year of 1848, Frederick Douglass\ninsisted that \u201call that distinguishes man as an intelligent and\naccountable being, is equally true of woman\u201d (quoted in Davis\n2011, 51). In the same year, the Declaration of Sentiments\nwas signed at a women\u2019s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New\nYork, and socialist and anarchist revolutions took place in Europe.\nThe revolutionaries included public thinkers who advocated communal\nproperty and sexual equality, and who criticized the involvement of\nstate and church in marriage. Their arguments about practical and\nfeminist ethics influenced Emma Goldman and other turn-of-the-century\nthinkers.\n\nPhilosophical thinkers of different backgrounds gained greater access to education and printing presses in the nineteenth century, resulting in a plurality of approaches to the project of understanding, criticizing, and correcting how gender operates within our moral beliefs and practices. For example, the\nattachment of some protofeminist thinkers to the domestic virtues\nshaped their ethical recommendations. Some white and middle-class\nactivists argued for the end of slavery and, later, against the\nsubordination of emancipated women of color precisely on the grounds\nthat they wished to extend the privileges that white and middle-class\nwomen enjoyed in the domestic and private sphere, maintaining the\nsocial order while valorizing domestic feminine goodness. As Clare\nMidgley says, \u201cWomen\u2019s role was discussed in terms of\nfamily life. Emancipation would mark the end of the sexual\nexploitation of women and of the disruption of family life, and the\ncreation of a society in which the black woman was able to occupy her\nproper station as a Daughter, a Wife, and a Mother\u201d (Midgley\n1993, 351).\n\nIn contrast, some former slaves including Anna Julia Cooper and Ida B.\nWells-Barnett, and descendants of slaves including Mary Church\nTerrell, grounded their work for women\u2019s rights and arguments\nfor women\u2019s moral and sociopolitical equality in rather\ndifferent priorities, asserting more interest in equal protection of\nthe laws, economic liberation, political representation, and in\nWells-Barnett\u2019s case, self-defense and the exertion of the right\nto bear arms, as necessary to the very survival and liberation of\nBlack Americans (Giddings 2007). Cooper, who rightly criticized white\nfeminists for racist (and female-supremacist) statements when they\nwere offered as reasons to work for white women\u2019s voting rights\nrather than Black men\u2019s, advanced a view of virtues and truth as\nhaving masculine and feminine sides. A century before care ethics\nwould become a strain of academic feminist ethics, Cooper urged that\nboth masculine reason and feminine sympathy \u201care needed to be\nworked into the training of children, in order that our boys may\nsupplement their virility by tenderness and sensibility, and our girls\nmay round out their gentleness by strength and self-reliance\u201d\n(Cooper [1892] 2000, 60). Her timeless concern for the U.S. was that a\nnation or a people \u201cwill degenerate into mere emotionalism on\nthe one hand, or bullyism on the other, if dominated by either\nexclusively\u201d (61). Hers is a normative argument for appreciating\nthe contributions that both traditionally feminine and masculine\nvalues could offer to a well-balanced ethics.\n\nExplicitly arguing that standpoints matter to knowledge claims and\nmoral theorizing, Cooper insisted that historical knowledge necessary\nto a nation\u2019s self-understanding depends on the representation\nof Black Americans\u2019 voices, and especially the \u201copen-eyed\nbut hitherto voiceless Black Woman of America\u201d (Cooper [1892]\n2000, 2; Gines 2015). Manifesting Cooper\u2019s call for\nrepresentations, Wells-Barnett determinedly included accounts of girls\nand women killed by lynching along with the narratives of murdered men\nand boys, and challenged the \u201cracial-sexual apologies for\nlynching to trample the twin myths of white (female) sexual purity and\nblack (male) sexual savagery\u201d (James 1997, 80).\nWells-Barnett\u2019s investigative journalism led her to the blunt\nsuggestion that some of the sexual relationships giving rise to cover\nstories of rape as justifications for lynching were consensual\nrelationships between white women and Black men, while rapes of Black\nwomen and girls, \u201cwhich began in slavery days, still continues\nwithout reproof from church, state or press\u201d (quoted in Sterling\n1979, 81).\n1.3 Twentieth-Century Influences and Issues\n\nLike Wells-Barnett, anarchist and socialist writers, some from\nworking-class backgrounds, advanced frank arguments for differently\nunderstanding women\u2019s capacities and desires as sexual beings\nwith their own moral agency. Leaders included Emma Goldman, whose\nanarchism was developed as a response to Marx and Marxism (Fiala\n2018). Goldman argued for broader understandings of love, sexuality,\nand family, because she believed that traditional social codes of\nmorality resulted in the corruption of women\u2019s sexual\nself-understanding (112). Like Wells-Barnett, Goldman coupled\narguments against feminine sexual purity with attention to the sexual\nexploitation of, and trafficking in, women who did not enjoy the\nstate\u2019s protection (Goldman 2012). Some suffragists\u2019\n\u201cemphasis on female morality repulsed Goldman. Yet, while she\nridiculed the claim that women were morally superior to men \u2026\nshe also emphasized that women should be allowed and encouraged to\nexpress freely their \u2018true\u2019 femininity\u201d (Marso 2010,\n76).\n\nAlthough early twentieth-century protofeminists differed in their\nbeliefs as to whether men and women were morally different in\ncharacter, they generally shared a belief in Progressive ideals of\nmoral and social improvement if only humankind brought fair and\nrational thinking to bear on ethical issues. Progressive-era\npragmatists, including Wells-Barnett, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman, Jane\nAddams, and Alice Paul, \u201csaw the social environment as\nmalleable, capable of improvement through human action and philosophic\nthought\u201d (Whipps and Lake 2016). The beginning of the century\nwas characterized by remarkably optimistic thinking even on the part\nof more radical theorists who appreciated the deep harms of oppressive\nsocial organizations. Most of the Progressive activists and\nsuffragists of this era never described themselves with the new term,\n\u201cfeminist,\u201d but as the immediate forerunners of feminism,\nthey are described as feminists today.\n\nAlthough belief in the possibilities for change seems widely shared,\nProgressive-era feminists did not always share common ground regarding\nwomen\u2019s moral natures or how to achieve moral progress as a\nnation. For example, both Goldman and pro-suffrage Charlotte\nPerkins-Gilman argued for individual self-transformation and\nself-understanding as keys to women\u2019s better moral characters\n(Goldman 2012), while maintaining that a person\u2019s efforts were\nbest supported by a less individualistic and more communitarian social\nand political framework (Gilman 1966). While Goldman included greater\naccess to birth control and reproductive choice among the morally\nurgent routes to women\u2019s individual self-discovery, Gilman and\nmany feminists argued for women\u2019s access to contraception in\nways that reflected increasingly popular policies of eugenics in North\nand South America and Europe (Gilman 1932). Eugenics-friendly white\nwomen\u2019s contributions of feminist ethical arguments to disrupt\noppressive pronatalism or to avert the measurable costs of parenthood\nin sexist societies often took the form of deepening other forms of\nmarginalization, including those based on race, disability, and class\n(Lamp and Cleigh 2011).\n\nIn the U.S., the centrality of sex and gender issues in public ethics\nreached a high-water mark during the Progressive Era, moving one\nmagazine to write in 1914 that \u201cThe time has come to define\nfeminism; it is no longer possible to ignore it\u201d (Cott 1987,\n13). Unfortunately, this sentiment would decline with the start of\nWorld War I and the consequent demise of optimistic beliefs in the\npowers of human rationality to bring about moral progress. Yet\nthroughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, as economic difficulties,\nmilitary conflicts, and wealth disparity fluctuated internationally,\nwomen\u2019s groups and feminist activists in many countries would\nadvance, with some success, feminist and moral arguments for\nworkplace, professional, electoral, and educational access, for the\nliberalization of contraception, marriage, and divorce laws, and\nagainst militarism. Some of their gains in greater access to voting,\neducation, and prosperity may have contributed to the wide audience\nthat was receptive to Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s publications in\nEurope and, after translations were available, in North America.\n\nBeauvoir first self-identified as a feminist in 1972 (Schwarzer 1984,\n32), and consistently refused the label of a philosopher despite\nhaving taught courses in philosophy (Card 2003, 9). Yet beginning in\nthe 1950s, both her Ethics of Ambiguity ([1947] 1976) and\nThe Second Sex ([1949] 2010) were widely read and quickly\nappreciated as important to feminist ethics (Card 2003, 1). As works\nof existentialist morality, they emphasized that we are not all simply\nsubjects and individual choosers but also objects shaped by the forces\nof oppression (Andrew 2003, 37). Like the protofeminists described\nabove, Beauvoir focused on the embodied experiences and social\nsituations of women. In these pivotal works, she advanced the case\nthat embodiment and social situatedness are not only relevant to human\nexistence, but are the stuff of human existence, so crucial that\nphilosophy ought not ignore them (Andrew 2003, 34). In The Second\nSex, she argued that some men in philosophy managed the bad-faith\nproject of both ignoring their own sex-situatedness and yet describing\nwomen as the Other and men as the Self. Because men in philosophy take\nthemselves to be paradigmatically human and take it upon themselves to\ncharacterize the nature of womankind as different from men, Beauvoir\nsaid that men socially construct woman as the Other. Famously,\nBeauvoir said, \u201cone is not born, but rather becomes,\nwoman,\u201d that is, one may be born a human female, but \u201cthe\nfigure that the human female takes on in society,\u201d that of a\n\u201cwoman,\u201d results from \u201cthe mediation of another\n[that] can constitute an individual as an Other\u201d (Beauvoir\n[1949] 2010, 329). The embodied human female may be a subject of her\nown experiences and perceptions, but \u201cbeing a woman would mean\nbeing an object, the Other\u201d (83), that is, the objectified\nrecipient of the speculations and perceptions of men. Beauvoir\ndescribed a woman who would transcend this situation \u201cas\nhesitating between the role of object, of Other that is proposed to\nher, and her claim for freedom\u201d (84), that is, her freedom to\nassert her own subjectivity, to make her own choices as to who she is,\nespecially when she is not defined in relation to men. A woman\u2019s\nposition is therefore so deeply ambiguous\u2014one of navigating\n\u201ca human condition as defined in its relation with the\nOther\u201d (196)\u2014that if one is to philosophize about women,\n\u201cit is indispensable to understand the economic and social\nstructure\u201d in which women aim to be authentic or ethical,\nnecessitating \u201can existential point of view, taking into account\nher total situation\u201d (84). In other words, philosophers\nspeculating about women ought to take into account the obstacles to\nwomen\u2019s opportunities for subjecthood and choice that are\ncreated by those who constructed an oppressive situation for women to\nnavigate.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s positions\u2014that woman has been defined\nby men and in men\u2019s terms, that ethical theory must attend to\nwomen\u2019s social situation and their capacity to be moral\ndecision-makers, and that women\u2019s oppression impedes their\nknowing themselves and changing their situation\u2014reflect the\nconcerns of many forerunners of feminist ethics. Beauvoir\u2019s work\nprofoundly shaped the emergence of feminist ethics as a subfield of\nphilosophy at a time when philosophers more generally had moved away\nfrom the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tendencies to describe\nwomen as lacking morally worthy rational capacities. Instead, by the\nmiddle of the twentieth century, some influential philosophers in\nEurope and the Americas had moved toward approaches that often led to\ndescribing both gender and ethics as irrelevant to philosophical\ndiscourse (Garry 2017).\n2. Themes in feminist ethics\n\nIn the fifty years that feminist ethics has been a subject of\nphilosophical scholarship in (initially) Western and (increasingly)\ninternational discourse, theorists have considered metaethical,\ntheoretical, and practical questions. Questions that occupied scholars\nin preceding centuries, especially those regarding moral agents\u2019\nnatural (and gendered) capacities for moral deliberation, are\ncritically reconsidered in debates that arose in the 1970s and 1980s.\nOne main area of inquiry addresses whether and why there may be\nmeaningful differences in feminine and masculine priorities of care\nand justice in normative theory. Concern about feminist methods of\narticulating ethical theories arise during this time and continue.\nThese debates can be found in the scholarship of intersectionality,\nBlack feminist thought and women of color feminism, transnational\nfeminism, queer theory, disability studies, and twenty-first century\ncriticisms of feminist ethics. They are of special concern whenever\nfeminist ethicists seem to uphold a gender binary and simplistic\nconceptualizations of woman as a category. Questions about\nthe shortcomings of traditional ethical theories, about which virtues\nconstitute morally good character in contexts of oppression, and about\nwhich kinds of ethical theories will ameliorate gendered oppressions\nand evils generate critical scholarship in every decade.\n2.1 Gender binarism, essentialism, and separatism\n\nGender binarism, which is the view that there are only two\ngenders\u2014male and female\u2014and that everyone is only one of\nthem (Dea 2016a, 108), is assumed by most feminist ethicists in the\n1970s and 1980s (Jaggar 1974; Daly 1979). Some of these feminists\ncriticize male supremacy without thereby preferring female supremacy\n(Frye 1983; Card 1986; Hoagland 1988). They argue that although the\ncategories of \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d are\nphysiologically distinct, the potential of feminism to liberate both\nmen and women from oppressive gendered social arrangements suggests\nthat men and women do not have different moralities or separate\nrealities, and that we do not need to articulate separate capacities\nfor ethics (Jaggar 1974; Davion 1998).\n\nOther feminist ethicists offer radically different views. Mary Daly,\nfor example, argues in Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical\nFeminism that women were traditionally defined throughout\nintellectual history as being subversive of rationality, impartiality,\nand morality as traditionally conceived. Daly argues that women ought\nto embrace, as essential to women\u2019s natures and good, some of\nthe very qualities that she says men have ascribed to women as\nessential to women\u2019s natures and bad. Daly suggests valuing both\nwomen\u2019s capacities for childbearing and birth (as opposed to\ncapacities to engage in war and killing) and women\u2019s\nemotionality (versus rationality) (Daly 1979).\n\nRadical feminists and lesbian feminists who disagree with Daly as to\nwhether women\u2019s moral natures are innately better than\nmen\u2019s agree with Daly in arguing either for essentialism\n(Griffin 1978; cf. Spelman 1988 and Witt 1995) or for\nwomen\u2019s separation from men (Card 1988; Hoagland 1988). Some of\nthem argue that separatism allows a setting in which to create\nalternative ethics, rather than merely responding to the\nmale-dominated ethical theories traditionally discussed in the\nacademy. They also argue that separatism better fosters women\u2019s\nincreased connection to each other and denies men the access to women\nthat men might expect (Daly 1979; Frye 1983; Hoagland 1988).\n\nIn deep disagreement, philosophers such as Alison Jaggar argue against\nseparatism as being in any way productive of a different and morally\nbetter world. Jaggar maintains that \u201cwhat we must do instead is\nto create a new androgynous culture which incorporates the best\nelements of both \u2026, which values both personal relationships\nand efficiency, both emotion and rationality. This result cannot be\nachieved through sexual separation\u201d (Jaggar 1974, 288). Related\narguments for androgynous approaches to ethics are influential in\narguments supporting androgyny, gender bending, and gender-blending\nthat are prevalent in the 1990s (Butler 1990; Butler 1993), and\ngender-eliminativist and humanist approaches to feminist ethics and\nsocial philosophy that are prevalent in the twenty-first century\n(LaBrada 2016; Mikkola 2016; Ayala and Vasilyeva 2015; Haslanger\n2012).\n\nOne criticism of gender binarism is that its assumption marginalizes\nnonconforming individuals. In efforts described as promoting coalition\nbetween trans activists and non-trans feminists, some feminists argue\nthat we ought to examine the gender privilege inherent in presuming a\nbinary that reflects one\u2019s own experience better than the\nexperiences of others (Dea 2016a; Bettcher 2014). Yet such\n\u201cbeyond-the-binary\u201d approaches, in turn, have been\ncautioned against as well-intentioned but, at times, invalidating\ntrans identities, \u201cby invalidating the self-identities of trans\npeople who do not regard their genitals as wrong\u201d or \u201cby\nrepresenting all trans people as problematically positioned with\nregard to the binary\u201d (Bettcher 2013). Recognition of\n\u201creality enforcement\u201d and its interconnection with racist\nand sexist oppression may better defray the harms of normalizing a\ngender binary (Bettcher 2013).\n2.2 Ethic of care as a feminine or gendered approach to morality\n\nJaggar argues against separatism or separate gendered realities,\nnoting that there is no reason \u201cto believe in a sexual polarity\nwhich transcends the physiological distinction\u201d (Jaggar 1974,\n283). The work of psychologist Carol Gilligan therefore has great\ninfluence on philosophers interested in just such evidence for\nsubstantial sex differences in moral reasoning, despite the fact that\nGilligan herself does not describe these differences as polar. In her\nlandmark work, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and\nWomen\u2019s Development (1982), Gilligan disputes accounts of\nmoral development that do not take into account girls\u2019 moral\nexperiences (18\u201319), or that describe women as stuck at an\ninterpersonal stage short of full moral development as in the theories\nof Lawrence Kohlberg (30). Gilligan argues that Kohlberg wrongly\nprioritizes a \u201cmorality of rights\u201d and independence from\nothers as better than, rather than merely different from, a\n\u201cmorality of responsibility\u201d and intimate relationships\nwith others (19).\n\nGilligan\u2019s research follows Nancy Chodorow\u2019s in suggesting\nthat for boys and men, \u201cseparation and individuation are\ncritically tied to gender identity\u201d (Gilligan 1982, 8). Further,\nthe development of masculinity typically involves valuing autonomy,\nrights, disconnection from others, and independence, while seeing\nother persons and intimate relationships as dangers or obstacles to\npursuing those values. This perspective is referred to as the\n\u201cperspective of justice\u201d (Held 1995; Blum 1988). Women, in\nGilligan\u2019s studies, were as likely to express the perspective of\njustice as they were to express a perspective that valued intimacy,\nresponsibility, relationships, and caring for others, while seeing\nautonomy as \u201cthe illusory and dangerous quest\u201d (Gilligan\n1982, 48), in tension with the values of attachment. This perspective\nis known as the perspective of \u201ccare\u201d (Friedman 1991;\nDriver 2005).\n\nPhilosophers who apply Gilligan\u2019s empirical results to ethical\ntheory differ about the role that a care perspective should play in\nnormative recommendations. Nel Noddings\u2019s influential work,\nCaring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education\n(1984), argues for the moral preferability of a care perspective as\nboth feminine and, as she later says explicitly, feminist (Noddings\n2013, xxiv), orienting moral agents to focus on the needs of those one\ncares for in relational contexts rather than on abstract, universal\nprinciples. Like her historical predecessors discussed above, Noddings\nemphasizes the feminine \u201cto direct attention to centuries of\nexperience more typical of women than men\u201d (xxiv), in part to\ncorrect the extent to which \u201cthe mother\u2019s voice has been\nsilent\u201d (1). Noddings\u2019s normative theory endorses the\nmoral value of partiality that justifies prioritizing interpersonal\nrelationships over more distant connections. Virginia Held\u2019s\n(1993; 2006) and Joan Tronto\u2019s (1993) different applications of\nthe perspective of care endorse care as social and political rather\nthan limited to interpersonal relationships, and suggest that an ethic\nof care provides a route to realizing better societies as well as\nbetter treatment of distant others. Both Held and Sara Ruddick (1989)\nurge societal shifts to prioritize children\u2019s vulnerabilities\nand the perspectives of mothers as necessary correctives to moral and\npolitical neglect of policies that would ensure the well-being of\nvulnerable people in relationships requiring care. This concern is\nfurther elaborated in Eva Feder Kittay\u2019s attention to caregivers\nas \u201csecondarily\u201d or \u201cderivatively dependent\u201d\n(1999). In normative theory and applied ethics, care-work and caring\nin workplace relationships have come to receive more attention in\ntwenty-first century philosophy than previously, as appreciation for\nthe ethical demands of relational support-provision and\nclient-centered or helping professions come to be influenced by\nvariations on the ethic of care (Kittay 1999; Feder and Kittay 2002;\nTronto 2005; Lanoix 2010; Reiheld 2015).\n\nRobin Dillon observes that, \u201cCare ethics was for some time the\ndominant approach in feminist ethics and so feminist discussions of\nvirtue\u201d (2017b, 574). Although the ethic of care continues to be\nstrongly associated with feminist ethics, Gilligan\u2019s work in\npsychology and Noddings\u2019s work in philosophy were immediately\ncontested (Superson 2012). Some feminist ethicists have argued that\nthe ethic of care valorizes the burdened history of femininity\nassociated with caring (Card 1996). The complex history of femininity\nand caregiving practices were shaped in contexts of oppression that\nmay permit \u201cmoral damage\u201d to women\u2019s agency (Tessman\n2005). If that burdened feminine history includes attention to\nparticular relationships at the expense of attention to wider social\ninstitutions and systematic political injustice, then the ethic of\ncare runs the risk of lacking a feminist vision for changing\nsystematic and institutional forms of oppression (Hoagland 1990; Bell\n1993). Further worries about the ethic of care include whether\nunidirectional caring enables the exploitation of caregivers (Houston\n1990; Card 1990; Davion 1993), and whether such caring excludes moral\nresponsibilities to strangers and individuals we may affect without\nmeeting interpersonally (Card 1990), thereby risking an insular ethic\nthat ignores political and material realities (Hoagland 1990). Another\nconcern is whether we risk generalizing some women\u2019s\nprioritizing caring to all women, which disregards the complex\npluralism of many women\u2019s voices (Moody-Adams 1991). Finally,\npreoccupation with women\u2019s kinder and gentler feelings may\nprevent or distract from attention to women\u2019s capacities for\nharm and injustice, especially the injustices borne of racial and\nclass privilege (Spelman 1991).\n\nThe above criticisms tend to proceed from a view that it is\nproblematic that an ethic of care is predicated on seeing femininity\nas valuable. They suggest that critical feminist perspectives require\nus to doubt the value of femininity. However, it remains controversial\nwhether femininity is necessarily defined in relationship to\nmasculinity and is thereby an inauthentic or insufficiently critical\nperspective for feminist ethics, or whether femininity is a\ndistinctive contribution of moral and valuing agents to a feminist\nproject that rejects or corrects some of the errors and excesses of\nlegacies of masculinity (Irigaray 1985; Harding 1987; Tong 1993;\nBartky 1990).\n2.3 Intersectionality\n\nOne way that some philosophers offer to resolve the possible tension\nbetween conceptions of femininity and feminism is to bring\nintersectional approaches to the question as to whose femininity is\nbeing discussed. Concerns that femininity is antithetical to a\ncritical feminist perspective seem to presuppose a conception of\nfemininity as passive, gentle, obedient, emotional, and dependent, in\ncontrast with a conception of masculinity as its opposite. In a\nphilosophical tradition dominated by white and masculine philosophers,\ndescribing femininity as necessarily the opposite of one\u2019s\nconception of masculinity in a gender binary makes limited sense.\nScholars of intersectionality point out, however, that identities are\nnot binary: \u201cthe masculinity and femininity in play here are not\nracially unmarked (if only for the reason that gender is never\nracially unmarked)\u201d (James 2013, 752). The insights of\nphilosophers of Black Feminism, intersectionality, queer theory,\ncritical race theory, disability studies, and transfeminism, among\nothers, contribute to a view that there is no universal definition of\nfemininity or of the category of woman that neatly applies to all\nwomen. Some of these philosophers suggest that the distinctive moral\nand valuing experiences of women and individuals of all genders may be\nunjustly ignored or denied by a conception of women or femininity that\nturns out to be white, ableist, and cisgender (Crenshaw 1991; Collins\n1990; Wendell 1996; hooks 1992; Tremain 2000; Serano 2007; McKinnon\n2014). Intersectional approaches reject binaries such as\n\u201cmasculinity/femininity\u201d that tend to take the social\npositions of privileged people as generic. Minimally,\nintersectionality is \u201cthe predominant way of conceptualizing the\nrelation between systems of oppression which construct our multiple\nidentities and our social locations in hierarchies of power and\nprivilege,\u201d offering a remedy to histories of exclusions in\nfeminist theory (Carastathis 2014, 304).\n\nAlthough intersectional insights can be found in the works of writers\neven from the distant past, the predominance of intersectionality in\nfeminist ethics today is largely owed to Black feminists and critical\nrace theorists, who were the first to argue for the significance of\nintersectionality (Crenshaw 1989; Collins 1990; Gines 2014; Bailey\n2009). Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw describes intersectionality in\ndifferent senses: as an experience, an approach, and a problem\n(Crenshaw 1989; Crenshaw 1991). Crenshaw\u2019s description of\nintersectionality as an experience includes the phenomena of\noppressive practices and harms that occur at, and because of,\nintersections of aspects of identity. For example, when Black men, but\nnot any women, were permitted to work on a General Motors factory\nfloor, and white women, but not any Black persons, were permitted to\nwork in the General Motors secretarial pool, then Black women were\ndiscriminated against as Black women. That is, they were not permitted\nto have any job at General Motors due to living at an intersection of\ncategories of identity that are treated separately in the law\n(Crenshaw 1989). Crenshaw\u2019s description of intersectionality as\nan approach includes centering the lives and testimony of those whose\nexperiences with living at intersections of oppressions have been\nignored or denied in traditional philosophical and political theories\n(Crenshaw 1989; Crenshaw 1991; hooks 1984; Dotson 2014; Lorde 1990;\nLugones 1987; Lugones 2014). Crenshaw\u2019s description of\nintersectionality as a problem includes disrupting the traditional\noverlooking of Black women\u2019s experiences, and offering the\nexperiences and the approaches described above as challenges to the\ndoctrine that discrimination occurs only along one axis of identity\n(Crenshaw 1989, 141). Intersectionality is pursued in the interests of\nexpanding understandings of differences and accounting for the\nexperiences of people previously spoken for, if addressed at all,\nrather than consulted.\n\nNot all philosophers who embrace appreciation of the insights of\nintersectionality agree on whether it yields a distinct methodology,\nor a starting point for better inquiry, or a better conception of\nexperiences of oppression (Khader 2013; Garry 2011). Serene Khader\nsuggests that intersectional theories \u201care united by a critique\nof what Crenshaw (1991) calls \u2018additive\u2019 models of\nidentity\u201d that assume that individuals at intersections of\ntraditionally oppressed identity categories are \u201cnecessarily\nworse off than the individual facing a single oppression,\u201d as if\neach dimension on which one can be oppressed is easily separable in\ncategories traditionally conceived in isolation (Khader 2013, 75).\nInstead, \u201cintersectional theorists argue that the oppressions\nfacing multiply oppressed women co-constitute one another and situate\nthose women such that attempts to advance the interests of \u2018all\nwomen\u2019 may fail to advance theirs\u201d (Khader 2013, 75).\n\nIntersectionality is not without its critics in feminist ethics. For\nexample, Naomi Zack (2005) argues that an intersectional approach to\nconcepts such as that of woman successfully demonstrates\nproblems with essentialism with respect to women\u2019s natures, but\ndegrades the category of woman, \u201cmultiplying axes of analysis\nand thus gender categories beyond necessity\u201d (Bailey 2009, 21)\nto an extent that may thereby fragment attempts to advocate for women\n(Zack 2005; Ludvig 2006; Sengupta 2006). Some feminists who support\nintersectionality have responded to Zack\u2019s concerns by arguing\nthat everyday concepts such as woman include an array of\nidentities, including distinct gender identities that bear a family\nresemblance and include a range of manifestations (Garry 2011). Other\nfeminists have responded to Zack\u2019s concerns for feminist\nmovement or solidarity by arguing for the possibilities of working in\ncoalitions that do not require widely shared commonality, working to\nlearn from and about positions of difference, and cultivating more\nhumility and less arrogance in theorizing (Lorde 1984; Lugones 1987;\nReagon 2000; Bailey 2009; Carastathis 2014; Sheth 2014; Ru\u00edz\nand Dotson 2017). Other feminist ethicists raise tensions in\nintersectional theory that are not intended to undermine the approach\nbut to ask for elaboration of its details, including its very\ndefinition (Nash 2008). The appeal for these clarifications, however,\nmay reflect traditions that intersectionality is dedicated to\ndisrupting, since it is made in the context of the pursuit of\njustification, habits of opposition, and a narrow sense of\ndefinitional work that is typical in philosophy, a field that has a\nreputation for lacking appreciation for diverse practitioners (Dotson\n2013).\n2.4 Feminist criticisms and expansions of traditional moral theories\n\nIf there is a commonality between all of the above feminist ethicists,\nit is their interest in provoking reconsideration of ethical theories\nthat failed either to notice or to care when the perspective of the\nphilosopher so criticized was taken for either a generic truth about\nmoral theory or a gender-specific and false description of human\nnature. Elena Flores Ru\u00edz observes that \u201cprofessional\nphilosophy sleepwalks; its somnambulatory practices stroll\nsilently, policing checkpoints without the burden of consciousness of\nits actions and practices\u201d (2014, 199). In other words,\nphilosophers have at times presumed that they speak for many without\nsufficient attention to their own presumptions. Ru\u00edz\u2019s\nclaim is akin to Rosemarie Tong\u2019s observation made decades\nearlier, that traditional ethical theory demonstrates \u201ca sleepy\ninattentiveness to women\u2019s concerns\u201d (1993, 160). The\nprovocation to alertness is evident in feminist critiques of\ntraditional ethical theories such as deontology, consequentialism,\nsocial contract theory, and virtue ethics. Some feminist ethicists\nsympathetically extend canonical work to concerns that male theorists\ndid not address, while other feminist ethicists resoundingly reject\ntraditional ethical theories because the theories rely on a conception\nof moral agency or moral value with which they disagree.\n2.4.1 Deontology, rights, and duties\n\nSome feminist ethicists endorse deontological moral theories on the\ngrounds that granting women\u2014who have been subordinated in\nprivate and public spheres\u2014the same rights routinely granted to\nmen in positions of power would enable women\u2019s freedom and\nflourishing, especially in contexts of political liberalism. Feminist\nethicists have long argued that we should acknowledge women\u2019s\nequal capacities for moral agency and extend human rights to them\n(Astell 1694; Wollstonecraft 1792; Stanton [1848] 1997; Mill [1869]\n1987; Nussbaum 1999; Baehr 2004; Stone-Mediatore 2004; Hay 2013).\nWhile building on existing frameworks of liberalism, rights theory,\nand deontology, feminist ethicists have argued for granting rights\nwhere they have been previously neglected (Brennan 2010). They have\nargued for rights in the issues of enfranchisement (Truth [1867]\n1995), reproduction (Steinbock 1994), abortion (Thomson 1971), bodily\nintegrity (Varden 2012), women\u2019s and non-heterosexual\npeople\u2019s sexuality (Goldman 2012; Cuomo 2007), sexual harassment\n(Superson 1993), pornography (Easton 1995), violence against women\n(Dauer and Gomez 2006), rape (MacKinnon 2006), and more. While\nrecognizing limits to the universality of women\u2019s experiences,\nfeminist philosophers have argued for global human rights as a remedy\nfor gendered oppression and dehumanization (Cudd 2005; Meyers\n2016).\n\nFeminist criticism of duty-centered frameworks, or, deontology,\ninclude those articulated by authors of the ethic of care, who argue\nagainst an ethic of duty, especially Kantian ethics, on several\ngrounds. First, they claim that it proceeds from absolutist and\nuniversal principles which are unduly prioritized over consideration\nof the material contexts informing embodied experiences,\nparticularities, and relationships. Second, they claim that it\ninaccurately separates capacities for rationality from capacities for\nemotion, and that it wrongly describes the latter as morally\nuninformative or worthless most likely because of their traditional\nassociation with women or femininity (Noddings 1984; Held 1993; Slote\n2007). Moreover, an ethic of duty is likely to overly idealize moral\nagents\u2019 capacities for rationality and choice (Tronto 1995;\nTessman 2015). Some feminist ethicists embrace forms of obligation yet\nreject Kantian deontology when it denies the possibility of moral\ndilemmas (Tessman 2015). Feminists who argue that duties are socially\nconstructed, rather than a priori, ground the nature of obligations in\nthe normative practices of the nonideal world (Walker 1998; Walker\n2003).\n\nTransnational feminists, scholars of intersectionality, and\npostcolonial feminists argue that feminist advocates of global human\nrights routinely impose their own cultural expectations and regional\npractices upon the women who are purportedly the objects of their\nconcern (Mohanty 1997; Narayan 1997; Narayan 2002; Silvey 2009;\nNarayan 2013; Khader 2018a; Khader 2018b). Critical analyses of some\nfeminist deontologists\u2019 concerns include arguments that\nuniversal morals, rights, and duties are not the best bulwark against\nrelativist condonation of any and all possible treatments of women and\nsubordinated people (Khader 2018b) and suggest that advocacy of human\nrights is perhaps well-intentioned but \u201centangled with\nimperialist precommitments in the contemporary West\u201d (Khader\n2018a, 19).\n2.4.2 Consequentialism and utilitarianism\n\nSince John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill argued both for\nutilitarianism and against the subjection of women, one could say that\nthere have been feminists as long as there have been utilitarians. In\nThe Subjection of Women ([1869] 1987), Mill argues that the\ndesirable outcome of human moral progress generally is hindered by\nwomen\u2019s legal and social subordination. He adds that not only\neach woman\u2019s, but each man\u2019s personal moral character is\ndirectly harmed by the injustice of unequal social arrangements (Okin\n2005). Mill expresses special concern that \u201cthe object of being\nattractive to men had \u2026 become the polar star of feminine\neducation and formation of character,\u201d an immoral\n\u201cinfluence over the minds of women\u201d (Mill [1869] 1987,\n28\u201329), as well as an immoral influence on the understandings of\nthe boys and girls that such women raise. Consistent with the\nutilitarian principle that everyone counts equally and no single\nperson\u2019s preferences count more than another\u2019s, Mill\nargues that men and women are fundamentally equal in their capacities\nfor higher and lower pleasures and, arguably, in their\nresponsibilities and interests (Mendus 1994). Harriet Taylor likewise\nargues in The Enfranchisement of Women for the moral\nimprovement of humankind generally and \u201cthe elevation of\ncharacter [and] intellect\u201d that would permit each woman and man\nto be both morally better and happier, which are overlapping and\nimportant considerations to Taylor (1998, 65).\n\nContemporary feminist ethicists who address utilitarianism either\ncritique Mill\u2019s work in particular (Annas 1977; Mendus 1994;\nMorales 2005), or defend a feminist version of consequentialism\n(Driver 2005; Gardner 2012), or apply consequentialist aims to\nfeminist issues (Tulloch 2005; Dea 2016b). Some consequentialist\nfeminists provide reasons for thinking that utilitarianism can\naccommodate feminist aims because it is responsive to empirical\ninformation, can accommodate the value of relationships in good lives,\nand is appreciative of distinctive vulnerabilities (Driver 2005).\n\nCritics of utilitarianism include those who specifically resist the\nexpectation of utilitarian impartiality, insofar as impartiality in\ndecision-making ignores emotional connections or personal\nrelationships with particular beings. Feminists have advanced\ncriticisms of impartiality from the points of view of care ethics\n(Noddings 1984; Held 2006; Ruddick 1989), ecofeminist or environmental\nethics (Adams 1990; Donovan 1990; George 1994; Warren 2000), and\nanalytical social ethics (Baier 1994; Friedman 1994). Impartiality may\nyield implausible requirements to value the well-being of all equally\nregardless of one\u2019s commitments, material circumstances in a\nnonideal world, or obligations of caring (Walker 1998; Walker 2003).\nImpartiality as a desirable quality of moral agents may overly\nidealize moral agency (Tessman 2015) or tacitly presume a biased\nperspective in favor of adult, racially privileged, masculine agents\nin a formal or public sphere whose decisions are unencumbered by\nrelationships of unequal power (Kittay 1999).\n\nSome feminists criticize consequentialism for failing to capture the\nqualitatively problematic nature of oppressions that are not reducible\nto harms (Frye 1983; Card 1996; Young 2009). For example, Card argues\nthat even if certain behavior does not produce more harm than good,\nits symbolism could violate one\u2019s dignity. Her example is the\ncase of women being barred from Harvard\u2019s Lamont Law library\neven when helpful male classmates provided them photocopies of course\nreadings (2002, 104\u2013105). Card also objects on Rawlsian grounds\nthat the wrongness of slavery was not the balance of benefits and\nharms, contra consequentialism, but the fact that trade-offs could\nnever justify slavery (2002, 57).\n\nAnti-imperialist and non-Western feminists argue that Mill\u2019s\nviews in particular purport to be universal but include \u201cWestern\nEuropean biases and instrumental reasoning\u201d that establish\n\u201cproblematic rhetorical models for women\u2019s rights\narguments\u201d (Botting and Kronewitter 2012). For example, Eileen\nBotting and Sean Kronewitter argue that The Subjection of\nWomen contains several examples of primitivist and Orientalist\nrhetorical moves, such as associating \u201cthe barbarism of\npatriarchal marriage with Eastern cultures and religions\u201d (2012,\n471). They also object that Mill offers instrumental arguments for\nwomen\u2019s rights, such as favoring the reduction of men\u2019s\nselfishness and the increase in men\u2019s intellectual stimulation\nin marriage, as well as doubling mental resources for the higher\nservice of humanity (2012, 470), suggesting that women\u2019s\nliberation is secondary to greater purposes.\n2.4.3 Moral contractarianism\n\nSome feminist ethicists argue for forms of contractarian ethics, that\nis, the view \u201cthat moral norms derive their normative force from\nthe idea of contract or mutual agreement\u201d (Cudd and Eftekhari\n2018). Contractarian ethics permit moral agents to critically assess\nthe value of any relationship, especially family relationships that\nmay be oppressive on gendered dimensions (Okin 1989; Hampton 1993;\nSample 2002; Radzik 2005). Other feminist contractarians appreciate\nHobbes\u2019s social contract theory for its applicability to women\nin positions of vulnerability. For example, Jean Hampton endorses\nHobbes\u2019s view that \u201cyou are under no obligation to make\nyourself prey to others\u201d (Hampton 1998, 236). Hampton combines\ninsights of both Kant and Hobbes in her version of feminist\ncontractarianism, \u201cbuilding in the Kantian assumption that all\npersons have intrinsic value and thus must have their interests\nrespected\u201d (Superson 2012; see also Richardson 2007).\nContractarianism arguably corrects gross injustices and inequities\ntraceable to gendered oppressions and the most serious evils that are\nsocially constructed (Anderson 1999; Hartley and Watson 2010).\n\nSome feminists argue for the usefulness of contractarian ethics to\nevaluate one\u2019s adaptive preferences, that is, \u201cpreferences\nformed in unconscious response to oppression\u201d (Walsh 2015, 829).\nFor example, Mary Barbara Walsh argues that social contract theory\nmodels \u201cthe conditions of autonomous choice, independence and\ndialogical reflection,\u201d and therefore \u201cexposes preferences\nthat fail to meet\u201d the conditions of autonomy. Feminist\ncontractarianism may thereby generate new understandings of social\ncontracts grounded in appreciation of material conditions,\ncommitments, and consent (Stark 2007; Welch 2012). Feminist\ncontractarians whose moral theories are influenced by John\nRawls\u2019s political philosophy suggest that his methodology, which\ninvolves reasoning from behind a veil of ignorance to decide which\nrules persons are rational to agree to, promotes critical appraisal of\npreferences that one would not hold in a better world (Richardson\n2007, 414).\n\nFeminist critics of contractarianism also raise concerns about\nadaptive preferences. In the actual, nonideal conditions in which\nindividuals and groups develop, dominant perspectives and oppressive\nsocial arrangements can make persons come to prefer things that they\nwould not otherwise prefer, such that the resultant preferences, when\nsatisfied, are not for the agent\u2019s own good, and may even\ncontribute to her group\u2019s oppression (Superson 2012). Feminists\nwho are concerned that not all moral agents can meaningfully consent\nto contracts point to examples of women who are denied access to the\npublic sphere, the market, education, and information (Held 1987;\nPateman 1988). Others point out that traditionally, social contract\ntheory has not attended to the inclusion of the needs of children,\ndisabled community members, or their caregivers (Held 1987; Kittay\n1999; Edenberg and Friedman 2013). Feminist critics of\ncontractarianism tend to argue both for full consideration of needs\nborn of differences between bodies and social locations, and against\ndescribing gender, embodiment, or dependency as a mere secondary\ncharacteristic irrelevant to what a body in need of care requires to\nflourish and thus what a \u201creasonable man\u201d would choose\nbehind a veil of ignorance (Nussbaum 2006; Pateman and Mills\n2007).\n2.4.4 Virtue ethics\n\nSome feminist ethicists contend that virtue ethics, which focuses on\nliving a good life or flourishing, offers the best approach to\nensuring that ethical theory correctly represents the conditions\npermitting vulnerable bodies to flourish in oppressive contexts.\nAlthough virtue ethics is most notably associated with Aristotle,\nwhose idealized and masculine agent is not generally considered\nparadigmatically feminist (Berges 2015, 3\u20134), feminists and\ntheir forerunners have engaged critically for several centuries with\nquestions about which virtues and qualities of character would promote\na good life in the context of what we now describe as women\u2019s\nsubordination. Philosophers who argue for feminist ethical virtues\nraise concerns that sexist oppression presents challenges to the\nexercise of virtues on the part of women and gender non-conforming\npeople. Robin Dillon observes that feminist virtue ethics\n\u201cidentifies problems for character in contexts of domination and\nsubordination and proposes ways of addressing those problems, and it\nidentifies problems of unreflective theory and proposes\npower-conscious alternatives\u201d (2017a, 381). Because the history\nof traditional virtue ethics is freighted with past characterizations\nof virtues as either gendered or as universal but less accessible to\nwomen, Dillon proposes what she calls \u201cfeminist critical\ncharacter ethics\u201d as an alternative to feminist virtue ethics\n(2017a, 380). Advocates of feminist virtue ethics and critical\ncharacter ethics consider the relationships of gender to accounts of\ncharacter, virtues, vices, and good lives (Baier 1994; Card 1996;\nCuomo 1998; Calhoun 1999; Dillon 2017a; Snow 2002; Tessman 2005; Green\nand Mews 2011; Berges 2015; Broad 2015; Harvey 2018).\n\nLike the ethic of care, virtue ethics is often described as offering a\ntheory that is not beholden to abstract and universal principles\n(Groenhout 2014), but instead acknowledges \u201cthat moral reasoning\nmight be an extraordinarily complex phenomenon \u2026, a view on\nwhich what the ethical life requires of us cannot be codified or\nreduced to a single principle or set of principles\u201d (Moody-Adams\n1991, 209\u2013210). A further commonality between care and virtue\nthat is of interest to feminists is that \u201cvirtue theory, like\ncare ethics, rejects a simplistic dichotomy between reason and\nemotion, and does not begin from the assumption that all human beings\nare essentially equal\u201d (Groenhout 2014, 487). Ethical theories\nof virtue or character tend to appreciate the importance of emotions\nand interpersonal relationships to a person\u2019s moral development.\nSome virtue ethics also focus on what opportunities for virtue are\navailable to agents in particular social contexts, which is useful in\nfeminist ethics when it comes to delineating our responsibilities as\nrelational beings and as characters who may exhibit vices resulting\nfrom oppression (Bartky 1990; Potter 2001; Bell 2009; Tessman 2009a;\nSlote 2011; Boryczka 2012).\n\nIndeed, the ethic of care bears so many important similarities to\nvirtue ethics that some authors have argued that a feminist ethic of\ncare just is a form or a subset of virtue ethics (Groenhout 1998;\nSlote 1998; McLaren 2001; Halwani 2003). Others believe that at a\nminimum, care and virtue ethics should inform each other and are\ncompatible with each other (Benner 1997; Sander-Staudt 2006). Here,\ntoo, however, feminist ethicists disagree. Some contend that lumping\ntogether care and virtue might render the complexity of moral\nexperiences and available moral responses less understandable rather\nthan more articulate (Groenhout 2014). Others suggest that this\nconsolidation might overlook important theoretical distinctions,\nincluding the capacity for virtue ethics to be gender-neutral while\nthe ethic of care maintains a commitment to embodied, particular, and\ngendered experiences (Sander-Staudt 2006).\n\nVirtue ethics provides wider opportunities for feminist ethics to\nattend to virtues such as integrity and courage in oppressive contexts\nthat the ethic of care tends not to prioritize (Davion 1993;\nSander-Staudt 2006). Resistance itself may be a \u201cburdened\nvirtue,\u201d which is Lisa Tessman\u2019s term for virtues that\nallow moral agents, even ones damaged by oppression, to endure and\nresist oppression, permitting a form of nobility that falls short of\neudaimonia (Tessman 2005). Tessman argues that when agents\nlive under conditions of systemic injustice, their opportunities to\nflourish are blocked and their pursuits may even be hopeless. She\nsuggests that \u201cthe burdened virtues include all those traits\nthat make a contribution to human flourishing\u2014if they succeed in\ndoing so at all\u2014only because they enable survival of or\nresistance to oppression \u2026, while in other ways they detract\nfrom their bearer's well-being, in some cases so deeply that their\nbearer may be said to lead a wretched life\u201d (Tessman 2005, 95).\nFeminist ethicists have explored virtues that permit the sort of\n\u201cconditioned flourishing\u201d that Tessman describes (2009,\n14), extending discussion of the virtues to specific applications in\nnonideal circumstances in which vulnerability is fundamental to the\nnature of a moral agent (Nussbaum 1986; Card 1996; Walker 2003). For\nexample, feminists have argued for distinctive virtues in contexts\nsuch as whistleblowing and organizational resistance (DesAutels 2009),\nhealthcare (Tong 1998), and ecological activism (Cuomo 1998).\n\nFeminist criticisms of the limits of virtue ethics point to its\nemphasis on the personal as potentially problematic when it comes to\n\u201caccounting for the possibility of social criticism and\nresistance on the part of the self who is constituted by the very\nsocial relationships and cultural traditions that would be the target\nof her resistance\u201d (Friedman 1993). Virtue ethics may also\ninclude intrusive requirements to self-evaluate one\u2019s every\nfeeling or practice to an extent that an ethic of duty, for example,\nwould not require (Conly 2001). Some care ethicists, most notably Nel\nNoddings (1984), argue that virtue ethics can be overly self-regarding\nrather than attentive to the point of view of another, and that it\nlocates moral motivation in rational, abstract, and idealized\nconceptions of the good life rather than in the natural well-spring of\nmoral motivation that is generated by encounters with particular\npersons.\n2.5 Rejections of absolutism: pragmatism, transnational feminism, and nonideal theory\n\nAs is evident from the foregoing, feminist ethics is not monolithic.\nFeminists have sometimes clashed over being essentialist or\nanti-essentialist. Some feminist work is authored by members of\nprivileged groups, while other feminist work is written by and attends\nto concerns of those in marginalized groups. Some feminists have\nlocated solidarity in commonality, while others advocate coalition in\nthe presence of intersectionality. The different approaches of\nfeminists to ethics raise questions as to whether feminist ethics can\nbe either universalist or absolutist. Feminists have observed that\njust as some men in the history of philosophy have falsely\nuniversalized from their own experience to describe the experiences of\nall humans, some feminists have presumed false universal categories of\nwomen or feminists that elide differences between women or presume to\nspeak for all women (Grimshaw 1996; Herr 2014; Tremain 2015).\nRelatedly, some feminist philosophers have criticized absolutism in\nethical theory, that is, the prioritization of rigorous applications\nof principles to ethical situations regardless of the particularities\nof context or the motivations of the individuals affected, in part\nbecause absolutism, like universalism, takes the absolutists\u2019\npriorities to be rational for all (Noddings 1984; Baier 1994).\nFeminist ethicists who have endorsed visions of universal human rights\nas liberating for all women have been criticized by other feminists as\nengaging in absolutism in ways that may prescribe solutions for women\nin different locations and social situations rather than attending to\nthe perspectives of the women described as needing such rights (Khader\n2018b; Herr 2014).\n\nThe predominant association of feminist ethics with an ethic of care,\nwhich is dichotomous with traditional ethical theories on many levels,\ntogether with decades of feminist critiques of the work of canonical\nabsolutist theorists, might lead to a perception that feminist ethics\nis fundamentally opposed to universalism and absolutism in ethics.\nThis perception, however, is not built into the nature of feminist\nethics, which has been employed to understand, criticize, and correct\nthe role of gender in our moral beliefs and practices by\ndeontologists, utilitarians, contractarians, and virtue ethicists, who\nhold some universal principles or absolute requirements to be basic to\ntheir views. However, it is evident that the preponderance of\nscholarship in feminist ethics tends to prioritize all of the\nfollowing: the moral contexts in which differently situated and\ndifferently gendered agents operate, the testimony and perspectives of\nthe situated agent, the power relationships and political\nrelationships manifest in moral encounters, the vulnerabilities of\nembodied actors that yield a plurality of approaches to ethical\nsituations, and the degrees of agency or capacity that are shaped by\nexperiences with oppression and misogyny. Such priorities tend not to\nresult in relativism, though they certainly depart from rigid forms of\nabsolutism. Feminist ethics is often expressed in morally plural ways,\nincluding pragmatism (Hamington and Bardwell-Jones 2012),\ntransnationalism (Jaggar 2013; Herr 2014; McLaren 2017; Khader 2018b),\nnonideal theory (Mills 2005; Schwartzman 2006; Tessman 2009b; Norlock\n2016), and disability theory (Wendell 1996; Garland-Thomson 2011;\nTremain 2015).\n\nThe following sub-entries included under \u201cfeminism\n(topics)\u201d in the\n Table of Contents\n to this Encyclopedia are relevant to the multiplicity of\napplications of feminist ethics:\n\nfeminist perspectives on autonomy\nfeminist perspectives on class and work\nfeminist perspectives on disability\nfeminist perspectives on globalization\n\nfeminist perspectives on objectification\nfeminist perspectives on power\nfeminist perspectives on rape\nfeminist perspectives on reproduction and the family\nfeminist perspectives on science\nfeminist perspectives on sex and gender\nfeminist perspectives on sex markets\nfeminist perspectives on the body\nfeminist perspectives on the self\nfeminist perspectives on trans issues\n\n\nSee also the entries in the Related Entries section below.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Carol J., 1990, <em>The Sexual Politics of Meat: A\nFeminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory</em>, London: Bloomsbury.", "Anderson, Elizabeth S., 1999, \u201cWhat is the Point of\nEquality?\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 109: 287\u2013337", "Andrew, Barbara S., 2003, \u201cBeauvoir\u2019s Place in\nPhilosophical Thought,\u201d in C.
