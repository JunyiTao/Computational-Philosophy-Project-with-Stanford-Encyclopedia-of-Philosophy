    "main_text": "Group rights: corporate and collective\n4. Group rights: corporate and collective\n\nThe various approaches to group rights described in the previous\nsection share a common feature. Each supposes that ascribing a right\nto a group entails conceiving the group as moral entity in its own\nright: the group must possess a moral standing that is not reducible\nto the standing of its members. That is why arguments about group\nrights frequently assume the same character as arguments about the\nascription of rights to foetuses or the dead or future generations or\nnon-human animals. In each case, the central issue is whether we\nshould allow that the relevant entity has the moral standing necessary\nfor it to bear rights.\n\nIf, for groups, we answer that question affirmatively, we shall\nconceive group rights analogously with individual rights. A group\nright, like an individual right, will be a right held by a single\nunitary entity. The right of a group will be \u201cits\u201d right\nrather than \u201ctheir\u201d right. Indeed, we might think of a\ngroup right as the right of a \u201cgroup-individual\u201d. Groups\nmight bear duties in the same fashion. A group, as a single integral\nentity, can possess duties just as it can possess rights, and those\nduties may derive from group rights. For example, each nation\u2019s right\nof self-determination is most obviously directed at other nations who,\nas nations, have corresponding duties to respect one another\u2019s rights.\n(It remains logically possible, of course, that duties stemming from\ngroup rights will fall upon individual persons, just as it is possible\nthat the rights of individual persons will generate duties for groups.\nOn the relatively neglected subject of group duties, see Collins,\n2019.)\n\nThis might be described as the \u201ctraditional\u201d conception of\ngroup rights, in that it describes the way in which group rights have\nbeen most commonly understood. In recent years, however, some\nproponents of group rights have conceptualised them quite differently.\nThey have understood a group right as a right that is the shared or\njointly held right of a set of individuals. In this conception, a\ngroup right is still properly so-called because the individuals who\nmake up the right-holding group possess a right together that none of\nthem possesses separately. The right is not a mere aggregation of\nrights held individually by the members of the group. But, a group\nright conceived in this way does not entail giving a moral status to\nthe group qua group that is separate from that of its members\nseverally. Rather, the moral standing that underwrites the group right\nis the moral standing of the several individuals who jointly hold the\nright. The group right is therefore conceived as \u201ctheir\u201d\nright rather than \u201cits\u201d right (Jones 1999a).\n\nThe distinction between these two conceptions has frequently passed\nunnoticed and there is no agreed vocabulary that marks it. The term\ncorporate will be used here to describe the traditional\nconception, since that conception presents a right-holding group as a\nunitary entity. The term collective will be used to describe\nthe conception of a group right as a shared or joint right, since it\nconceives a right-holding group as a \u201ccollection\u201d of\nindividuals, albeit a collection that is bound together in a way that\nenables them to hold their right collectively. (Note that, contrary to\nthis usage, many proponents of the \u201ccorporate\u201d conception\nof group rights use the term \u201ccollective\u201d to describe\nthose rights; e.g. Galenkamp 1993, Jovanovi\u0107 2012, McDonald 1991,\nNewman 2011.)\n\nJoseph Raz has provided the most influential statement of the\ncollective conception. According to Raz, if a right is to be a\ncollective right, it must satisfy three conditions:\n\nFirst, it exists because an aspect of the interest of human beings\njustifies holding some person(s) to be subject to a duty. Second, the\ninterests in question are the interests of individuals as members of a\ngroup in a public good and the right is a right to that public good\nbecause it serves their interest as members of that group. Thirdly,\nthe interest of no single member of that group in that public good is\nsufficient by itself to justify holding another person to be subject\nto a duty. (1986, 208)\n\n\nRaz\u2019s conception of a collective right is tied to his interest theory\nof rights according to which, as we have seen, X has a right if X has\nan interest that suffices to ground another\u2019s duty (1986, 166). Thus,\na group of individuals has a collective right if their shared interest\nis sufficient to ground a duty in others, and if the interest of any\nsingle member of the group is insufficient by itself to ground that\nduty. When these conditions are satisfied, the group of individuals\npossess a right together that none of them possesses separately. In\nfact, Raz argues that the interests that ground a right are not\nnecessarily limited to the interests of the right-holder; they can\nalso include interests that others have in the right-holder\u2019s having\nthe right (1986, 245\u201363; 1994, 44\u201359; 1995). For example,\nthe right of journalists not to disclose their sources is grounded not\nonly in their own interests but also in the public\u2019s interest in their\nhaving that right. That consideration can also apply to collective\nrights. The rights of a group in respect of its culture, for example,\nmight be grounded not only in the interests of the group\u2019s members in\ntheir culture but also in the interests of \u201coutsiders\u201d in\nthe continued existence of the group\u2019s culture.\n\nSome other theorists whose approach to group rights is consistent with\nwhat is described here as the \u201ccollective\u201d conception are\nNathan Brett (1991), Allen Buchanan (1993, 1994), Leslie Green (1991),\nVinit Haksar (1998), Lesley Jacobs (1991) and Seumas Miller (2001,\n2010). (See also Margalit and Raz 1990.) The collective conception\nneed not be tied to an interest theory of rights. Miller, for example,\ngives an account of the collective conception that owes nothing to\nthat theory (2001, 210\u201333). But the ascendancy of the interest\ntheory of rights in recent years has meant that those who have adopted\nthe collective conception have frequently followed Raz in combining it\nwith the interest theory. (For criticism of the collective theory so\nconceived, see Griffin 2008, 261\u2013265; Preda 2013.) Moreover,\nthat theory does provide a ready-made account of what it is that\nindividuals share\u2014interests\u2014that makes them a\nright-holding group. The way that interests can accumulate across\nindividuals also helps to explain how it is that a group of\nindividuals can have a right, as a group, that none of them possesses\nsingly. For Raz, the number of individuals in a group can affect both\nwhether the group has a right and how weighty its right is (1986, 187,\n209). Others are less comfortable with that \u201caggregative\u201d\nfeature of Raz\u2019s conception; yet the relevance of numbers is often\nhard to dismiss. Consider, for example, the claim of a linguistic\nminority that its language should be usable, and provided for, in the\npublic domain. Given the public costs of meeting that claim, it would\nseem implausible to hold that we should take no account of the size of\na linguistic minority (of which there may be several) in deciding\nwhether the claim amounts to a right.\n\nThe fact that, on the collective conception, the individual members of\na group hold their right jointly does not entail that the right must\nbe grounded in an interest that an individual could have as an\nindependent individual. Some goods take a necessarily collective form,\nso that they cannot be made available to an individual in isolation\nfrom others; for example, the good constituted by a group\u2019s culture or\nits communal form of life. Yet it still makes perfect sense to hold\nthat a group right to those goods is morally grounded in the interests\nof the several individuals who make up the relevant group and that the\nright is held jointly by those individuals. Thus, even though the\ncollective conception gives no moral standing to a group independently\nof its members, it can still account for groups\u2019 having rights to\ngoods that are necessarily non-individual in form.\n\nAt the same time, there is nothing in the logic of the collective\nconception that limits the possible objects of group rights to\nnon-individualizable goods. Nor, if we adopt the interest theory, need\nthe right-holding group be a group in virtue of anything other than\nthe shared interest that grounds their right. The second condition\nthat Raz stipulates for a collective right suggests that individuals\nmust be members of a group before they can go on to have interests of\na sort that might ground a collective right. Miller, too, makes\nmembership of a social group a defining condition of a joint right\u2019s\nbeing a collective right (2001, 211). But it is not clear why we\nshould hold that a set of individuals can have a collective right only\nif they constitute a group in virtue of something other than their\nshared interest. \n\nConsider the following example. A city is characterised by very heavy\ntraffic that poses a danger to its pedestrians. The city\u2019s pedestrians\nhave an interest in there being a network of walkways so that they can\nmove around the city in safety. Each pedestrian, as an individual, has\nan interest in those walkways, but the interest of just one pedestrian\nis insufficient to create a duty for the city authorities to construct\nthe walkways. However, the shared interest of all pedestrians may well\nsuffice to ground that duty, in which case pedestrians will have a\ncollective right that the authorities should construct and maintain\nthe walkways. The point of this example is not to insist that, in\nthese circumstances, pedestrians would indeed have that right. Rather\nit is to show that (a) a group might have a right to a good that is\nintelligible as a good for an independent individual, and (b) a\nright-holding group need be a group only in virtue of the shared\ninterest that grounds their right. The group need not be\ninstitutionalised as a group, nor need it be distinguished by a common\nascriptive feature. (In the example given, the fact that the\nright-sharing individuals are identifiable as\n\u201cpedestrians\u201d contributes nothing to their having a\ncollective right independently of their interest in being able to walk\naround the city safely, .)\n\nThe collective conception can, then, make sense of group rights both\nto goods that would be intelligible as goods for independent\nindividuals and to goods that are intelligible only as goods enjoyed\ncollectively with others. It is often supposed that, if a good takes a\nnecessarily collective form (e.g. the collective good of possessing a\ncommon culture), the interest in that good can be understood only as\nthe irreducible interest of a group. That is associated with the\nsupposition that, if the shared interest generates a group right, the\nright-holding group must also be understood as an irreducible moral\nentity. Both suppositions are mistaken. Even in the case of a shared\nor collective interest, the interests that do the moral work in\ngenerating a right are entirely intelligible as the interests of the\nseveral individuals who make up the group and whose good is at stake.\nSimilarly, the moral standing necessary for the individuals, as a\ngroup, to have a right to the shared good can be the standing of the\nseveral individuals who compose the group. Thus, vindicating group\nrights need not entail showing that the right-holding group has either\ninterests or a standing that is not reducible to those of its\nmembers.\n\nAt the same time, there is a limit to the range of cases the\ncollective conception can encompass. As was mentioned earlier, there\ncan be cases in which the interest of a group logically precedes that\nof its members and in which the members have interests simply because,\nqua members, they share in the interest of the group. For example, a\nfootball club may have the stated aim of being as successful as\npossible in playing against rival clubs. The club will then have an\ninterest in whatever will promote that aim, including fielding the\nstrongest team possible in each game. I, as a member of the club, will\nshare in its interests. So, for example, if it is in the club\u2019s\ninterest to drop me from its team because I am not playing well\nenough, that will also be in my interest qua member. That interest qua\nmember may conflict with a personal interest that I have in remaining\na team player, but arguably that does not disturb my interest qua\nmember. If we understand the interest that grounds a group\u2019s right as\nan interest that the group has independently of its members, and if we\nunderstand the members\u2019 interests as mere derivatives of that group\ninterest, we must understand both the interest and the right of the\ngroup according to the corporate model. The group right cannot be\nunderstood adequately as a product of the aggregated interests of the\nindividuals who populate the group (Newman 2011, 57\u201382).\n\nFor the same reason, the collective conception cannot easily make\nsense of a group right as a right possessed by a group whose identity\nis unaffected by changes in its membership. As Newman points out\n(2011, 59\u201360), if we conceive a group right as a right held\njointly by those who compose the group, each change in the group\u2019s\nmembership must entail a change in the identity of the right-holding\ngroup. On the other hand, that may not be an objection. Groups, such\nas cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, are often\nshifting amorphous entities and we may have to get used to the idea\nthat right-holding groups can be groups that have constantly changing\ncompositions. Practically, that may be of little consequence for group\nrights provided that there is a reasonable continuity of interest\namongst the group\u2019s members, so that the content of the right is not\ndisturbed by every change in membership.\n\nFinally, note three things about the distinction between corporate and\ncollective rights. First, the limits of the collective conception\nidentified above stem from its unwillingness to conceive a group\nseparately from its members. They do not stem from an inability of the\ncollective conception to make sense of necessarily shared or\ncollective interests\u2014interests that individuals can have only\nalong with others. Secondly, we can most readily conceive a group\nseparately from its members when it is formally constituted as an\ninstitution, as in the case of a football club or a university. But\nonce we separate a group from its members in that way, we run into the\nissue of whether we should really ascribe the right to an institution\nor an organisation rather than to a group (Sheehy 2006, 159\u2013167,\n175\u2013195). Presumably it is for that reason that people do not\nnormally describe the rights of Congress or Parliament or the Supreme\nCourt as \u201cgroup rights\u201d. Thirdly, it is logically possible\nto interpret some group rights as corporate and others as collective,\nso that we are not obliged to commit ourselves exclusively to just one\nof these conceptions.\n",
