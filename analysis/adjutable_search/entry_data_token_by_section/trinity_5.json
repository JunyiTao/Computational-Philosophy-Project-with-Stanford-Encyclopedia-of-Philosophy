    "main_text": "One-self Theories || Divine Life Streams\n1.5 Divine Life Streams\n\nBrian Leftow sets the agenda for his own one-self theory in an attack\non \u201csocial\u201d, that is, multiple-self theories. (See\nsections\n 2\n and\n 3.1\n below.) In contrast to these, he asserts that\n\n\u2026there is just one divine being (or substance), God\u2026[As\nThomas Aquinas says,] God begotten receives numerically the same\nnature God begetting has. To make Aquinas\u2019 claim perfectly\nplain, I introduce a technical term, \u201ctrope\u201d. Abel and\nCain were both human. So they had the same nature, humanity. Yet each\nalso had his own nature, and Cain\u2019s humanity was not identical\nwith Abel\u2019s\u2026 A trope is an individualized case of an\nattribute. Their bearers individuate tropes: Cain\u2019s humanity is\ndistinct from Abel\u2019s just because it is Cain\u2019s, not\nAbel\u2019s. With this term in hand, I now restate Aquinas\u2019\nclaim: while Father and Son instance the divine nature (deity), they\nhave but one trope of deity between them, which is\nGod\u2019s\u2026bearers individuate tropes. If the Father\u2019s\ndeity is God\u2019s, this is because the Father just is God.\n(1999, 203\u20134)\n\n\nLeftow characterizes his one-self Trinity theory as\n\u201cLatin\u201d, following the recent practice of contrasting\nWestern or Latin with Eastern or Greek or \u201csocial\u201d Trinity\ntheories. Leftow considers his theory to be in the lineage of some\nprominent Latin-language theorists. (See the supplementary document on\nthe history of trinitarian doctrines,\n section 3.3.2,\n on Augustine, and\n section 4.1,\n on Thomas Aquinas.) In a later discussion Leftow adds that this\nTrinity\u00a0theory needn\u2019t commit to trope theory about\nproperties. Rather, whether or not properties are tropes,\n\u201c\u2026the Father\u2019s having deity = [is numerically\nidentical to] the Son\u2019s having deity. For both are at bottom\njust God\u2019s having deity.\u201d (Leftow 2007, 358)\n\nLeftow makes an extended analogy with time travel; just as a dancer\nmay repeatedly time travel back to the dance stage, resulting in a\nwhole chorus line of dancers, so God may eternally live his life in\nthree \u201cstreams\u201d or \u201cstrands\u201d (2004,\n312\u201323). Each Person-constituting \u201cstrand\u201d of\nGod\u2019s life is supposed to (in some sense) count as a\n\u201ccomplete\u201d life (although for any one of the three,\nthere\u2019s more to God\u2019s life than it) (2004, 312). Just as\nthe many stages of the time-traveling dancer\u2019s life are united\ninto stages of her by their being causally connected in the right way,\nso too, analogously, the lives of each of the three Persons count as\nbeing the \u201cstrands of\u201d the life of God, because of the\nmysterious but somehow causal inter-trinitarian relations (the Father\ngenerating the Son, and the Father and the Son spirating the Spirit)\n(313\u20134, cf. 321\u20132, Leftow 2012a, 313).\n\nTime-travel does not require that entities are four-dimensional\n(2012b, 337). If a single dancer, then, time travels to the past to\ndance with herself, this does not amount to one temporal part of her\ndancing with a different temporal part of her. If that were so,\nneither dancer would be identical to the (whole, temporally extended)\nwoman. But Leftow supposes that both would be identical to her, and so\nwould not be merely her temporal parts. He holds that if time travel\nis possible, a self may have multiple instances or iterations at a\ntime. His theory is that the Trinity is like this, subtracting out the\ntime dimension. God, in timeless eternity, lives out three lives, or\nwe might say exists in three aspects. In one he\u2019s Father, in\nanother Son, and in another the Holy Spirit. But they are all one\nself, one God, as it were three times repeated or multiplied.\n\nLeftow argues that his theory isn\u2019t any undesirable form of\n\u201cmodalism\u201d (i.e. a heretical one-self theory)\nbecause\n\nNothing in my account of the Trinity precludes saying that the\nPersons\u2019 distinction is an eternal, necessary, non-successive\nand intrinsic feature of God\u2019s life, one which would be there\neven if there were no creatures. (2004, 327)\n\n\nLeftow wants to show what is wrong with the following argument (2004,\n305\u20136; cf. 2007, 359):\n\nthe Father = God\nthe Son = God\nGod = God\nthe Father = the Son (from 1\u20133)\nthe Father generates the Son\nGod generates God (from 1, 2, 5).\n\n\nCreedal orthodoxy requires 1\u20133 and 5, yet 1\u20133 imply the\nunorthodox 4, and 1, 2 and 5 imply the unorthodox (and necessarily\nfalse) statement 6. So what to do? Lines 1\u20134 seem perfectly\nclear, and the inference from 1\u20133 to 4 seems valid. So too does\nthe inference from 1, 2, and 5 to 6. Why should 6 be thought\nimpossible? The idea is that whatever its precise meaning,\n\u201cgeneration\u201d is some sort of causing or originating,\nsomething in principle nothing can do to itself. One would expect\nLeftow, as a one-self trinitarian, to deny 1 and 2, on the grounds\nthat neither Father nor Son are identical to the one self which is\nGod, but rather, each is a mode of God. But Leftow instead argues that\npremises 1 and 2 are unclear, and that depending on how they are\nunderstood, the argument will either be sound but not heretical, or\nunsound because it is invalid, 4 not following from 1\u20133, and 6\nnot following from 1, 2, and 5.\n\nThe argument seems straightforward so long as we read\n\u201cFather\u201d and \u201cSon\u201d as merely singular\nreferring terms. But Leftow asserts that they are also definite\ndescriptions \u201cwhich may be temporally rigid or non-rigid\u201d\n(Leftow 2012b, 334\u20135). A temporally rigid term refers to a being\nat all parts of its temporal career. Thus, if \u201cthe president of\nthe United States\u201d is temporally rigid, then in the year 2013 we\nmay truly say that \u201cThe president of the United States lived in\nIndonesia\u201d, not of course, while he was president, but it is\ntrue of the man who was president in 2013, that in his past, he lived\nin Indonesia. If the description \u201cpresident of the United\nStates\u201d (used in 2013) is not temporally rigid, then it\nrefers to Barack Obama only in the presidential phase of his life, and\nso the sentence above would be false.\n\n\u201cThe Father\u201d, then, is a disguised description, something\nlike \u201cthe God who is in some life unbegotten\u201d (2012b, 335)\n(For \u201cthe Son\u201d we would substitute \u201cbegotten\u201d\nfor the last word.) Because the \u201c=\u201d sign can have a\ntemporally non-rigid description on one or both sides of it, then\nthere can be \u201ctemporary identities\u201d, that is, identity\nstatements which are true only at some times but not others. Leftow\ngives as an example the sentence \u201cthat infant = Lincoln\u201d;\nthis is true when Lincoln is an infant but false when he has grown up.\nSuch identity statements can only be true or false relative to times,\nor to something time-like (2004, 324). If the terms\n\u201cFather\u201d and \u201cSon\u201d are temporally rigid, or at\nleast like such a term in that each applies to God at all portions of\nhis life (which isn\u2019t temporally ordered), then 4 does\nfollow from 1\u20133. But 4, Leftow argues, is theologically\ninnocuous, as it means something like \u201cthe God who is in some\nlife the Father is also the God who is in some life the Son\u201d\n(2012b, 335). This is \u201ccompatible with the lives, and so the\nPersons, remaining distinct,\u201d seemingly, distinct instances of\nGod (each of which is identical to God), and Leftow accepts 1\u20134\nas sound only if 4 means this (ibid.).\n\nIf the terms \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cSon\u201d are temporally\nnon\u2013rigid, or at least like such a term in\nthat each applies to God relative to some one portion of his life but\nnot relative to the others, then the argument is unsound. Relative to\nthe Father-strand of God\u2019s life, 1 will be true but 2 will be\nfalse. Relative to the Son-strand, 2 will be true, but 1 will be\nfalse. 3 and 5 will be true relative to any strand, but in any case,\nwe will not be able to establish either 4 or 6.\n\nLeftow\u2019s theory crucially depends on a concept of\nmodes\u2013intrinsic, essential, eternal ways God is, that is, lives\nor life-strands. But he does not identify the\n\u201cpersons\u201d of the Trinity with these modes. Rather, he\nasserts that the modes somehow constitute, cause, or give rise to each\nPerson\u00a0(2007, 373\u20135). Like theories that reduce these\nPersons\u00a0to mere modes of a self, Leftow\u2019s theory has it\nthat what may appear to be three selves actually turn out to be one\nself, God. But they, all (apparently) three of them, just are\n(are numerically, absolutely identical to) that one self, that is, God\nthrice over or thrice repeated.\n\nSome philosophers object that Leftow\u2019s time-travel analogy is\nunhelpful because time-travel is impossible (Hasker 2009, 158).\nSimilarly, one may object that Leftow is trying to illuminate the\nobscure (the Trinity) by the equally or more obscure (the alleged\npossibility of time travel, and timeless analogues to it). If\nLeftow\u2019s one-self theory is intended as a literal interpretation\nof trinitarian language, a \u201crational reconstruction\u201d\n(Tuggy 2011a), this would be problematic; but if he means it merely as\nan apologetic defense (i.e. we can\u2019t rule out that the Trinity\nmeans this, and this can\u2019t be proven incoherent) then the fact\nthat some intellectuals believe in the possibility of time travel\nsupports his case.\n\nOne may wonder whether Leftow\u2019s life stream theory is really\ntrinitarian. Do not his Persons\u00a0really, so to speak, collapse\ninto one, since each is numerically identical to God? Isn\u2019t this\nmodalism, rather than trinitarianism? (McCall 2003, 428) Again, one\nmay worry that Leftow\u2019s concept of God being\n\u201crepeated\u201d or having multiple instances or iterations is\neither incoherent or unintelligible. And how can such Persons be fully\nGod or fully divine when they exist because of something which is more\nfundamental, God\u2019s life-strands? (Byerly 2017, 81)\n\nWilliam Hasker objects that assuming Leftow\u2019s theory,\n\nIn the Gospels, we have the spectacle of God\u2013as\u2013Son\npraying to himself, namely to God\u2013as\u2013Father.\nPerhaps most poignant of all\u2026 are the words of abandonment on\nthe cross, \u201cMy God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d On the view\nwe are considering, this comes out as \u201cWhy have\nI\u2013as\u2013Father forsaken\nmyself\u2013as\u2013Son?\u201d (Hasker 2009, 166)\n\n\nIn reply, Leftow argues that if we accept the coherence of time travel\nstories, we should not be bothered by the prospect of \u201cone\nperson at one point in his life begging the same person at another\npoint\u201d (2012a, 321). About the cry of abandonment on the cross,\nLeftow urges that the New Testament reveals a Christ who (although\ndivine and so omniscient) did not have full access to his knowledge,\nspecifically knowledge of his relation to the Father, and so Christ\ncould not have meant what Hasker said above. Instead, he \u201cwould\nhave been using the Son\u2019s \u2018myself\u2019 and\n\u2019I,\u2019 which\u2026 pick out only the Son\u201d (2012a,\n322).\n\nHasker also objects that Leftow\u2019s one\u2013self theory\ncollapses the interpersonal relationships of the members of the\nTrinity into God\u2019s relating to himself, and suggests that in\nLeftow\u2019s view, God would enjoy self\u2013love, but not\nother\u2013love, and so would not be perfect (2009, 161\u20132,\n2012a, 331). (On this sort of argument see sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.5\n below.) Leftow replies that the self\u2013love in question would be\n\u201crelevantly like love of someone else\u201d and so, presumably,\nof equal value (2012b, 339).\n\nDoes the theory imply \u201cpatripassianism\u201d, the traditionally\nrejected view that the Father suffers? (After all, the Son suffers,\nand both he and the Father are identical to God.) Leftow argues that\nnothing heretical follows; if his analysis is right \u201cthen\nclaiming that the Father is on the Cross is like claiming that The\nNewborn [sic] is eligible\u00a0to join the AARP [an organization for\nretirees]\u201d, that is, true but misleading (2012b, 336).\n",
