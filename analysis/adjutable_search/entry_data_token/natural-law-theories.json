That is not to say that legal theory can be adequately identified\nand pursued independently of moral and political theory. Nor is it to\ndeny that there are worthwhile natural law theories much more\nconcerned with foundational issues in ethics and political theory than\nwith law or legal theory. A sample of such wider and more foundational\ntheories is the entry \n  Aquinas\u2019 moral, political, and legal philosophy.\nIn the present entry, \u201cnatural law theory\u201d\nis to be taken as shorthand for natural law theories just insofar as\nthey bear on law and are theories of or about it. This focus has the\nimportant incidental effect that many historically important\ndifferences between natural law theorists can be omitted, differences\nwhich pertain more to the foundations of normativity than to the\nnature and functions (\u201cthe concept\u201d) of positive\nlaw.\n\n\nLegal theorists who present or understand their theories as\n\u201cpositivist\u201d, or as instances of \u201clegal\npositivism\u201d, take their theories to be opposed to, or at least\nclearly distinct from, natural law theory. Natural law theorists, on\nthe other hand, did not conceive their theories in opposition to, or\neven as distinct from, legal positivism (contra Soper 1992 at\n2395). The term \u201cpositive law\u201d was put into wide\nphilosophical circulation first by Aquinas, and natural law theories\nof his kind share, or at least make no effort to deny, many or virtually\nall \u201cpositivist\u201d theses\u2014except of course the bare\nthesis that natural law theories are mistaken, or the thesis that a norm is the content of an act of will. Natural law theory\naccepts that law can be considered and spoken of both as a\nsheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of\nreasons for action that can be and often are sound as reasons and\ntherefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them. This dual\ncharacter of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan\n\u201cUnjust laws are not laws.\u201d Properly understood, that\nslogan indicates why\u2014unless based upon some skeptical denial\nthat there are any sound reasons for action (a denial which can be set\naside because defending it is self-refuting)\u2014positivist\nopposition to natural law theories is pointless, that is redundant:\nwhat positivists characteristically see as realities to be affirmed\nare already affirmed by natural law theory, and what they\ncharacteristically see as illusions to be dispelled are no part of\nnatural law theory. But because legal theories conceived of by their\nauthors as positivist are, by and large, dominant in the milieux of\nthose likely to be reading this entry, it seems appropriate to refer\nto those theories along the way, in the hope of overcoming\nmisunderstandings that (while stimulating certain clarifications and\nimprovements of natural law theorizing) have generated some needless\ndebate.\n\n\nThe point made in the preceding paragraph is made in another way by\nOrrego (Orrego 2007). When the accounts of adjudication and\njudicial reasoning proposed by contemporary mainstream legal theories\nare added to those theories\u2019 accounts of (the concept of) law, it\nbecomes clear that, at the level of propositions (as distinct from\nnames, words and formulations), those theories share (though not\nalways without self-contradiction) the principal theses about law\nwhich are proposed by classic natural law theorists such as Aquinas:\n(i) that law establishes reasons for action, (ii) that its rules can\nand presumptively (defeasibly) do create moral obligations that did\nnot as such exist prior to the positing of the rules, (iii) that that\nkind of legal-moral obligation is defeated by a posited rule\u2019s serious\nimmorality (injustice), and (iv) that judicial and other\nparadigmatically legal deliberation, reasoning and judgment includes,\nconcurrently, both natural (moral) law and (purely) positive\nlaw. Orrego\u2019s point seems to be confirmed by, e.g., the adjacent entry\non Legal Positivism (Green and Adams 2019).  Contemporary\n\u201cpositivist\u201d theories are, it seems, natural law theories,\ndistinguished from the main body of natural law theory (a) by their\ndenial that the theory of law (as distinct from the theory or\ntheories of adjudication, judicial duty, citizens\u2019 allegiance, etc.)\nnecessarily or most appropriately tackles the related matters just\nlisted, and accordingly (b) by the incompleteness of their theories of\nlaw, that is, the absence from them (and usually, though not always,\nfrom their accounts of those related matters) of systematic critical\nattention to the foundations of the moral and other normative claims\nthat they make or presuppose.\n\n\nIn short: a natural law theory of (the nature of) law seeks both to\ngive an account of the facticity of law and to answer questions that\nremain central to understanding law. As listed by Green 2019 (having\nobserved that \u201cNo legal philosopher can be only a legal\npositivist\u201d), these further questions (which \u201clegal positivism\ndoes not aspire to answer\u201d) are: What kinds of things could\npossibly count as the merits of law? What role should law play in\nadjudication?  What claim has law on our obedience?  What laws should\nwe have?  And should we have law at all?  All these questions, though\norganized and articulated a little differently, are under\nconsideration in the present entry.\n", "toc": [{"#EnaPosSocFacMadReaForAct": "1.

Enabling positivity: social facts made reasons for action\n\n\nThe fulcrum and central question of natural law theories of law is:\nHow and why can law, and its positing in legislation, judicial\ndecisions, and customs, give its subjects sound reason for acting in\naccordance with it? How can a rule\u2019s, a judgment\u2019s, or an\ninstitution\u2019s legal (\u201cformal,\u201d \u201csystemic\u201d)\nvalidity, or its facticity or efficacy as a social phenomenon (e.g.,\nof official practice), make it authoritative in its subject\u2019s\ndeliberations? \n\n\nThe sense and force of these questions, and the main features of the\nkind of answer given by natural law theories, can be given a\npreliminary indication. On the one hand, natural law theory holds that\nlaw\u2019s \u201csource-based character\u201d\u2014its dependence upon\nsocial facts such as legislation, custom or judicially established\nprecedents\u2014is a fundamental and primary element in\n\u201claw\u2019s capacity to advance the common good, to secure human\nrights, or to govern with integrity\u201d (cf. Green and Adams 2019).\nOn the other hand (cf. Green 2003), the question \u201cwhether\nlaw is of its very nature morally problematic\u201d has from the\noutset been the subject of consideration by leaders of the tradition.\n(The first issue that Aquinas takes up about human law in his set-piece\ndiscussion of law, Summa Theologiae, I-II, q. 95 a. 1, is\nwhether human law [positive law] is beneficial\u2014might we not do\nbetter with exhortations and warnings, or with judges appointed simply\nto \u201cdo justice\u201d, or with wise leaders ruling as they see\nfit? And see I.3 below.)  Classic and leading contemporary texts of\nnatural law theory treat law as morally problematic, understanding it\nas a normally indispensable instrument of great good but one that\nreadily becomes an instrument of great evil unless its authors\nsteadily and vigilantly make it good by recognizing and fulfilling\ntheir moral duties to do so, both in settling the content of its rules\nand principles and in the procedures and institutions by which they\nmake and administer it. Natural law theories all understand law as a\nremedy against the great evils of, on the one side anarchy\n(lawlessness), and on the other side tyranny. And one of tyranny\u2019s\ncharacteristic forms is the co-optation of law to deploy it as a mask for\nfundamentally lawless decisions cloaked in the forms of law and\nlegality.\n1.1 Basic reasons for action and the need for governmental authority\n\n\nIf one thinks perceptively and carefully about what to pursue (or\nshun) and do (or forbear from), one can readily understand and assent\nto practical propositions such as that life and health, knowledge, and\nharmony with other people are desirable for oneself and anyone\nelse. The intrinsic desirability of such states of affairs as one\u2019s\nflourishing in life and health, in knowledge and in friendly relations\nwith others, is articulated in foundational, underived principles of\npractical reasoning (reasoning towards choice and action). Such first\nprinciples of practical reasoning direct one to actions and\ndispositions and arrangements that promote such intelligible goods,\nand that directiveness or normativity is expressed by \u201cI\nshould\u2026\u201d or \u201cI ought\u2026\u201d in senses which\nalthough truly normative are only incipiently moral.\n\n\nA natural law moral theory will give an account of the way in which\nfirst principles of practical reason take on a moral force by being\nconsidered, not one by one but in their united\n(\u201cintegral\u201d) directiveness. That integral directiveness is\ngiven specific (albeit highly general) articulation in principles such\nas the injunction to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself; or the Golden\nRule of doing for others what you would want them to do for you and\nnot doing to others what you would not have them do to you; or the\n\u201ccategorical imperatives\u201d to respect, and treat as\nintrinsically valuable, humanity (the basic aspects of human\nflourishing) in oneself and in others, so that each of one\u2019s\ncommunities is treated as a kingdom of ends\u2014of persons each\nends in themselves. Such high-level but far from contentless moral\nprinciples can be given further specificity in two ways (1) by\nidentifying what, given some broadly stable features of human reality,\nthey entail (see 1.2\u20134), and (2) by a rational but more or less\nnon-deductive selection among alternative specifications, a selection\nnamed by Aquinas determinatio (plural,\ndeterminationes) (see 1.5). Political communities\nare a kind of institution whose rational status as a normally\ndesirable and obligatory objective of and context for collaborative\naction (and forbearance) can easily be seen to be entailed by the\nfoundational practical and moral principles. In such communities, the\nnormal means for making the needed determinationes is the\ninstitution of governmental authority acting in the first instance\nthrough legislation and other forms of law-making, i.e., acting as a\nsocial-fact source of positive (posited) law.\n\n\nThe political-theoretical part of natural law theory explains and\nelaborates the grounds and proper forms of governmental authority. It\nexplains the similarities and differences between the practical\nauthority of rulers (including democratic electors acting as selectors\nof representatives or as plebiscitary decision-makers) and the\ntheoretical authority of experts and persons of sound judgment. It\nshows the grounds for instituting and accepting practical authority as\nan almost invariably necessary means for preventing forms of harm and\nneglect which, because contrary to the high-level moral principles (at\nleast as they bear on relationships between persons), involve\ninjustice. Political theory subsumes, as one of its branches, legal\ntheory. As legal theory, political theory explains the normal\ndesirability that governmental authority in political communities be\nexercised within the framework of (in the classic slogan) a\n\u201crule of law and not of men\u201d (1.3).\n1.1.1 Why \u201cnatural\u201d law? Naturalistic fallacy?\n\n\nWhat does the mainstream of natural law theory intend by using the\nword \u201cnatural\u201d in that name for the theory?  The shortest\naccurate answer is \u201cof reason,\u201d as in \u201cthe law of\nreason\u201d or \u201cthe requirements of reason.\u201d Aquinas is\nparticularly clear and explicit that in this context,\n\u201cnatural\u201d is predicated of something (say, a law, or a\nvirtue) only when and because that of which it is predicated is in\nline with reason, practical reason, or practical reason\u2019s\nrequirements: see Finnis 1980, 35\u20136. Moreover, he employs,\nthrough all his works, a methodological axiom: X\u2019s nature is\nunderstood by understanding X\u2019s capacities, which are\nunderstood by understanding their act[uation]s, which are understood\nby understanding their objects. But the objects of chosen acts are the\nintelligible intrinsic goods (aspects of human flourishing) which we\nare directed to by practical reason\u2019s first principles.  So the\nequation, in this context, of \u201cnatural\u201d and\n\u201crational\u201d and its cognates is no mere confusion, but\ngrounded in a sophisticated distinction between ontology and\nepistemology: in the order of being, what is good and reasonable for\nus is a resultant of what is foundational, our given nature; but in\nthe order of coming to know, our knowledge of our nature is in\nsignificant part a resultant of our understanding of what kinds of\npossible objects of choice are good.\n\n\nThough the core of classic and mainstream natural law theory is thus\nuntainted by any \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d (Finnis 2018,\n2.4.2), non-practical knowledge of facts counts, in that theory, in\nvarious ways. Knowledge of the factual possibility of (say) acquiring\nknowledge, or of losing or saving life, is a datum (not really a\npremise) for the understanding that such a possibility is also an\nopportunity\u2014that actualizing the possibility would be\ngood for oneself and others. Other kinds of relevant facts\ninclude the facts about certain human radical capacities and their\nabsence in other animals\u2014these facts are the data for the\ninsight into the sense and bounds of the class (persons, human beings)\nof \u201cothers\u201d in \u201cgood for oneself and others.\u201d\nOr again, facts about the limited supply of resources and the limited\nstrength of human will (the need for incentives, etc.) make (1.5)\nappropriation of resources to particular owners a normal requirement\nof justice to non-owners and owners alike.\n1.2 Political authority as remedy for anarchy, injustice and impoverishment\n\n\nThe texts that are earliest (e.g., the Platonic or pseudo-Platonic\nMinos: Lewis 2006) and most foundational (e.g., Plato\u2019s\nGorgias, Republic and Laws, and Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics) in the tradition of natural law theory remind their\nreaders of the evident evils of anarchy: a condition of things in\nwhich no person or body of persons efficaciously claims or is accepted\nwidely as having authority to restrict the use of violence, theft and\nfraud, and in which any conventional norms of conduct are made hollow\nby irresolvable disputes about their content and/or their\napplication. In such a state of affairs, the more strong, cunning and\nruthless prey on the less, education of children (which calls for\nresources outside the family) is difficult to accomplish, and economic\nactivity remains stunted by the insecurity of holdings and the\nunreliability of undertakings. There is evident need for persons who\nwill articulate and enforce standards of conduct which will tend to\npromote the common good of bodily security, stable access to\nresources, cooperation in economic and educational activities, and\nrectification (by punishment, compensation and restitution) of at\nleast the grosser inter-personal injuries of commission and\nneglect. To articulate that need is to state the reasons for\ninstituting and supporting political authority, notably state\ngovernment and law, on condition that these institutions carry on\ntheir legislative, executive and judicial activities substantially for\nthe common good of the inhabitants of the relevant territory, rather\nthan in the interests of a segment of the population unfairly\nindifferent or hostile to the interests and wellbeing of other\nsegments.\n1.3 Rule of law as remedy for the dangers in having rulers\n\n\nAristotle (Politics III.15.1286a\u2013IV 4 1292a) vigorously\ndebates the question whether political authority is better exercised\nthrough a \u201crule [primacy, supremacy] of law\u201d or \u201ca\nrule of men,\u201d say of one best person, or a democratic assembly,\nor indeed (Rhetoric I 1 1354a32\u2013b16) a court. He takes\nhis arguments to suggest the answer that in almost all societies, on\nalmost all occasions and issues, it is preferable that government be\nby or in accordance with law, since (i) laws are products of reason(s)\nnot passion(s), (ii) the sovereignty of a ruler or assembly tends to\ntyranny (i.e., rule in interests of a section, not common good), (iii)\nequality demands that each mature person have some share in governing,\nand (iv) rotation of offices and office-holders is desirable and can\nhardly be managed without legal regulation. So for Aristotle, the\ncentral case of practical authority is government of a polis\nby law and legally regulated rulers.\n\n\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 account of human positive law treats the central\ncase of government as the self-government of a free people by the\nrulers and institutions which that people has appointed for that\npurpose, and the central case of law is the co-ordination of willing\nsubjects by law which, by its public character (promulgation),\nclarity, generality, stability and practicability, treats those\nsubjects as partners in public reason (Summa Theologiae I-II\nq. 90 a. 4c; q. 95 a. 3c; q. 96 a. 1; q. 97 a. 2). For he defines law\nas universal (in the logician\u2019s sense of \u201cuniversal\u201d)\npractical propositions conceived in the reason of the ruler(s) and\ncommunicated to the reason of the ruled so that the latter will treat\nthose propositions, at least presumptively, as reasons for \naction\u2014reasons as decisive for each of them as if each had conceived\nand adopted them by personal judgment and choice.\n\n\nLon Fuller 1969, acknowledging Aquinas\u2019 lead in this discussion of\nformal and procedural aspects of legal system, pulls together Aquinas\u2019\nscattered and fragmentary remarks about them into an orderly list of\neight elements of the rule of law, that is of la\nprimaut\u00e9 du droit, the legal system of a\nRechtsstaat. He shows that these hang together as a set of\ndesiderata (or requirements) because they are implications or\nspecifications of the aspiration and duty to treat people as\npresumptively entitled\u2014as a matter of fairness and\njustice\u2014to be ruled as free persons, fundamentally the equals of\ntheir rulers, not puppets or pawns to be managed and kept in order by\nmanipulation, uncertainty, fear, etc. The normal result of such\nfairness in the procedures of making and maintaining the law will be\nto strengthen the law\u2019s efficacy, too. Unfortunately, the surface of\nFuller\u2019s text gives more prominence to effectiveness than to fairness,\nand many critics (e.g., Hart, Dworkin), overlooking the moral\nconnotations of Fuller\u2019s allusions to reciprocity between\nrulers and ruled, thought his book\u2019s title, The Morality of\nLaw, a misnomer. This thesis has been elaborated more carefully\nand on a different basis by Raz 1979 and Kramer 2004a and 2004b:\nalthough the rule of law (and compliance with it) can be morally\nimportant and even a moral virtue (because normally necessary for\nfully just government in a just society, and especially for\nalleviating dangers that arise from the existence of political\nauthority, and of law itself), it is nonetheless in itself morally\nneutral since (in states which employ the forms of law) it will\nnormally be needed even by deeply unjust rulers for advancing their\nimmoral purposes. It is like a sharp knife, whose sharpness makes it\napt for life-saving surgery but equally for stealthy callous murders\n(Raz 1979, 224\u20136).\n\n\nFinnis 1980 (273\u20134) and Simmonds 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 have\nchallenged the quasi-empirical claim that even vicious tyrants need or\nfind it apt, for the efficacy of their domination, to comply with the\nrequirements of the rule of law. The eighth of Fuller\u2019s elements of\nthe rule of law, viz. adherence by the rulers to their own rules in\ntheir conduct of government, is especially obstructive, rather than\nsupportive, of a tyranny\u2019s purposes. But the focus of Fuller\u2019s\nconcern, and the most fruitful locus of debate, is not so much on\nhistorical or sociological phenomena or causalities as on the\n\u201cinternal,\u201d practical reasons at stake. If the rulers\nsomewhere do not respect the rights and interests of some of their\nsubjects in relation to issues of substance (life, bodily security,\nfreedom, property, and so forth), why should the rulers\u2014what\nreason have they to\u2014respect their subjects\u2019 rights or interests\nin the matters of procedure involved in the rule of law (giving them\nfair notice of what is expected of them, and adhering as rulers to the\npromulgated law when assessing these subjects\u2019 conduct and in other\ngovernmental dealings with those subjects)?  A more or less\ninconsistent willingness of rulers to tie their own hands by\nscrupulous adherence to procedural justice while yet being\nsubstantively unjust, is of course psychologically possible. But\nFuller\u2019s primary concern, like that of the wider tradition of natural\nlaw theory, is with rationality and the specific implication of fully\ncoherent reasonableness: morally reasonable judgment and\nchoice.\n1.4 Ius gentium\u2014ius cogens\u2014mala in se\u2014human rights: legal rules and rights posited because morally necessary parts of any legal system\n\n\nFuller offered a merely procedural natural law theory, though he did\nnot deny that a substantive natural law theory is possible and\nappropriate. And indeed there is no sufficient reason to follow him in\nrestricting the range of practical-theoretical reflection on what is\nneeded for a political society worthy of the self-restraints and\nacceptance of responsibilities that the law requires of those to whom\nit applies. For it is clear that the procedures and institutions of\nlaw are in the service of substantive purposes: the restriction of\nviolence, theft and fraud, the recovery of things misappropriated from\ntheir lawful owners or possessors, and of losses wrongfully imposed,\nprotection of intangible goods such as reputation against unwarranted\ndefamation, and of the immature, the mentally disabled and other\nvulnerable people against sexual or other exploitation, and so forth.\n\n\n\nThat portion of our positive law which consists of legal principles or\nrules giving effect to purposes such as those just listed was often\nnamed, by natural law theories, ius [or jus]\ngentium. Minted by jurists of classical Roman law such as\nGaius (c. 165 AD), this name\u2014literally \u201cthe law of\npeoples\u201d\u2014alludes to the set of rules and principles found\nin similar if not identical forms in virtually all legal systems. The\nreason for their ubiquity is, generally speaking, that any reasonable\nconsideration of what it takes for individuals, families and other\nassociations to live together in political society, tolerably well,\nwill identify these principles and rules as necessary. In modern law\nthey are picked out, in principle, by names such as \u201cthe general\nprinciples of law recognized by civilized nations\u201d (Statute of\nthe International Court of Justice, art. 38), ius\ncogens erga omnes (literally \u201claw that is\ncompelling [obligatory without agreement or enactment or other forms\nof adoption] in relation to [for/on, \u2018against\u2019]\neveryone\u201d), \u201chigher law\u201d, or \u201cfundamental\nhuman rights.\u201d In Aquinas\u2019s theory of law, they are referred to\nas conclusions (entailments) of the very highest-level, most\ngeneral moral principles. In the common law tradition, the legal\nwrongs picked out by such principles have been called mala in\nse, as distinct from mala prohibita\u2014things wrong\nin themselves as distinct from things wrong only because prohibited by\n(positive) law\u2014and this distinction remains, for good reason, in\nuse in judicial reasoning.\n\n\nSome legal theories speak of these principles and rules as belonging\nto law by a kind of \u201cconceptual\u201d necessity. Hart (1961)\ncan be so read. But even Hart\u2019s account, on closer examination,\nidentifies the relevant necessity not as conceptual or linguistic but\nas an instance of the rational necessity of means needed to secure\npurposes which are non-optional. It was for this reason that Hart\nspoke of them as constituting \u201cthe minimum content of natural\nlaw.\u201d He would have expressed his own meaning more perspicuously\nhad he spoken instead of \u201cthe minimum content of positive law,\nthe minimum set of principles which, because rationally necessitated\n\u2014given certain fundamental \u2018truisms\u2019 about human\nnature and the human predicament\u2014for the securing of purposes\nshared by all survivable human societies, can be called natural\nlaw.\u201d The fact is that these elements of our law are both\npositive (made and part of official practice) and natural (rationally\nrequired for at least minimal human flourishing).\n\n                 \nThese issues are discussed further in Section 3 below.\n1.5 \u201cPurely positive law\u201d: determinationes and their legal-moral authority for citizens and judges (facts made reasons for action)\n\n\nNatural law theory of law has its most distinctive characteristic in\nits account of purely positive law which, though\n\u201centirely\u201d dependent for its legal status on the fact that\nit has been authoritatively posited by some persons(s) or institution,\nnonetheless shares in law\u2019s characteristic of entailing\u2014albeit\npresumptively and defeasibly\u2014a moral obligation of\ncompliance. About these rules of a positive legal system, Aquinas says\nthat, though they certainly should be, and be presumed to have been,\n\u201cderived from natural law\u201d, they have their legal\nforce only from their part in this posited system (ex\nsola lege humana vigorem habent: ST I-II, q. 95\na. 3).\n\n\nHis explanation, slightly updated: this very large part of our law\ncould reasonably have been different, in the way that every detail of\na maternity hospital could have been somewhat different and large\nportions of the design could have been very different, even though\nsome features (e.g., that the doors and ceilings are more than two feet\nhigh) are entailed by the commission to build a town maternity\nhospital, and every feature has some rational connection with\nthe commission. The kind of rational connection that holds even where\nthe architect has wide freedom to choose amongst indefinitely many\nalternatives is called by Aquinas a determinatio of\nprinciple(s)\u2014a kind of concretization of the general, a\nparticularization yoking the rational necessity of the principle with\na freedom (of the law-maker) to choose between alternative\nconcretizations, a freedom which includes even elements of (in a\nbenign sense) arbitrariness.\n\n\nOnce the determinatio is validly made, fulfilling the\ncriteria of validity provided by or under the relevant legal system\u2019s\nconstitutional law, it changes the pre-existing state of the law by\nintroducing a new or amended legal rule and proposition(s) of law. The\nnew or amended legal rule gives judges, other officials, and citizens\na new or amended reason for action (or forbearance). The fact that the\nnew or amended rule depends upon the social-fact source constituted or\nemployed by the act of determinatio does not entail that a\nnormative reason (an \u201cought\u201d) is being illogically derived\nfrom a bare fact (an \u201cis\u201d). Rather, the new or amended\nrule is normative, directive and (where that is its legal meaning )\nobligatory because that social fact can be the second premise\nin a practical syllogism whose first premise is normative:\n\u201cthere ought to be a maternity hospital in this town,\u201d\n\u201cpeople ought to be protected against homicidal assault,\u201d\n\u201cpeople ought to be required to contribute to the public\nexpenses of appropriate governmental functions\u201d, \u201cvictims\nof assault, theft, broken contracts, negligence, etc., ought to be\ncompensated,\u201d \u201croad traffic should be regulated to reduce\ndamaging collisions,\u201d and so forth. The moral normativity of the\nprinciple is replicated in the more specified rule created by the\ndeterminatio, even though the latter is not an entailment of\nthe former. \n\n\nThat is to say: the concretized rule is (morally as well as legally)\nnormative because such normativity is (presumptively and defeasibly)\nentailed by the (moral) principle that the common good (whose\nfundamental content is given by the foundational principles of\npractical reason: 1.1) requires that authoritative institutions take\naction to specify, apply and enforce some rules on the relevant\nmatters. Social facts make a positive legal rule a reason for action\nbecause the desirability of authority as a means of securing common\ngood, and the desirability of the \u201crule of law and not of\nmen,\u201d are standing and potent reasons for acknowledging such\nfacts as an instance of valid legislation giving presumptively\nsufficient reason for compliance. Purely positive law that is legally\nvalid is (presumptively and defeasibly) valid and binding \nmorally\u2014has the moral form or meaning of legal \nobligatoriness\u2014when and because it takes its place in a scheme of practical\nreasoning whose proximate starting point is the moral need for justice\nand peace, and whose more foundational starting-point is the range of\nbasic ways in which human wellbeing can be promoted and protected, the\nway picked out in practical reason\u2019s first principles.\n\n\nThus, in relation to the settled positive law, natural law\ntheory\u2014as is acknowledged by a number of legal positivists,\n(e.g., Raz 1980, 213; Gardner 2001, 227)\u2014shares the principal\nthesis of contemporary legal positivists, that laws depend for their\nexistence and validity on social facts.\n1.5.1 \u201cPresumptive\u201d and \u201cdefeasible\u201d obligatoriness\n\n\nThe legal-moral obligation or obligatoriness of a legal rule is\ncounterpart to the legal-moral authority or authoritativeness of its\nauthor (enacter) or other source. The idea of authority has been\nclarified by contemporary legal theorists such as Raz and Hart, by\nreflection upon the kind of reasons for action purportedly given to\npotentially acting subjects by an exercise of practical authority. The\nrelevant kind of practical reason has been variously called\nexclusionary, peremptory or pre-emptive, and content-independent. The\ncore idea is that subjects are instructed to treat the proffered\nreason (say, a statutory provision, or a judicial order), in their\ndeliberations towards choice and action, as a reason which does not\nsimply add to the reasons they already have for acting one way rather\nanother, but rather excludes and takes the place of some of those\nreasons. And this exclusionary, peremptory or pre-emptive force is\nowed not to the inherent attractiveness to reason of the (content of\nthe) proffered reason, but to the status of its author or other source\nas one entitled\u2014for example, by its role in a constitutional\nscheme of governance for the solution of a political community\u2019s\ncoordination problems\u2014to be obeyed, complied with, treated as\nauthoritative. See e.g., Raz 1986, 35\u201369. This\ncontent-independence of authoritative reasons entails their\npresumptive obligatoriness. The defeasibility of that presumption is\nentailed by the dependence of such reasons\u2019 peremptory, pre-emptive or\nexclusionary force upon a background of presupposed basic human needs\nand goods, and of basic moral principles and norms, a background which\nentails that if a purportedly authoritative proffered (posited) reason\nconflicts sufficiently clearly with those standing needs, goods,\nprinciples or norms its exclusionary force is exhausted or overcome\nand the purported obligatoriness defeated.\n\n\nLess abstractly put, both the effectiveness of laws as solutions to\ncoordination problems and promoters of common good, and the fairness\nof demanding adherence to them, are dependent upon their being treated\nboth by the subjects and the administrators of the legal system as\nlegally and morally entitled, precisely as validly made law, to\nprevail against all other reasons save competing moral\nobligations of greater strength. It is this entitlement that is\nnegated by the serious injustice of a law or legal system: see 3 and 4\nbelow.\n2. Human persons are not law\u2019s creatures but its proper point\n\n\nTalk of human flourishing\u2019s or wellbeing\u2019s aspects, and of principles\nof practical reason, should not be allowed to distract attention from\nan important truth, implicit both in classical Greek and Roman\nphilosophical and juristic treatments of justice and in modern\njuristic attributions of human rights. Indeed, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948) links the two traditions of\ndiscourse by placing at the head of its articulation of human rights\nthe core (\u201call human beings are born free and equal in dignity\nand rights\u201d) of the Roman juristic saying (Institutes\n1.2.2) that \u201cby nature, from the outset, all human beings were\nborn free and equal,\u201d a saying about iustitia, justice\nas a ground and standard for ius, law. The same Roman law\ntexts, promulgated as permanent law by Justinian 533\u2013535 AD,\nstate more than once that law\u2019s point (its \u201cfinal\u201d\ncausa, explanatory reason) is the human persons for whose\nsake it is made, that is, all human persons until the time\nwhen the ius gentium, the common law of peoples, was\ndistorted by wars and slavery. Law, fit to take a directive place in\npractical reasoning towards morally sound judgment, is for the sake of\nhuman persons: all the members of the community regulated by that law\nand all other persons within that law\u2019s ambit.\n\n\nThat thesis falls within those parts of legal theory that are\nacknowledged but not much explored by contemporary legal\npositivists. It was ignored and in effect denied by earlier forms of\nlegal positivism more ambitious to cover the whole of legal\nphilosophy, e.g., Kelsen\u2019s. Kelsen denied that persons were known\neither to law or to a proper legal theory or science of law, except\ninsofar as they were made the subject of a posited legal rule. But\nagainst this restriction, which has misled some courts which have\ntreated Kelsenian legal science as a guide to judicial reasoning, it\ncan be said (Finnis 2000) that the fundamental equality and dignity of\nhuman beings should defended as part of a rationally sound\nunderstanding (concept) of law. This defense requires an account of\nthe difference between capacities which are activated here and now, or\nare more or less ready to be so actuated, and radical\ncapacities such as exist in the epigenetic primordia of even very\nyoung human beings, and in the genetic and somatic constitution of\neven the severely disabled.  Though such an account makes possible a\ndefense of the fundamental equality of human beings, and thus a\nhumanist legal theory, the point of the account is not to privilege a\nbiological species as such, but to affirm the juridical significance\nof the status of persons\u2014substances of a rational\nnature\u2014as inherently the bearers (subjects) of\nrights of a kind different and more respect-worthy and\nend-like than the rights which are often, as a matter of\ntechnical means, attributed by law to animals, idols, ships\nor other objects of legal proceedings.\n3. Legal principles to remedy defective positive law\n3.1  Adjudicating between exclusive and inclusive legal positivism\n\n\nThe so-called positivist thesis that all law depends for its existence, validity\nand obligatoriness on its social-fact source(s) is often accompanied,\nas in Raz\u2019s \u201cexclusive legal positivism\u201d (Raz 1980,\n212\u201324; Raz 1985), by the thesis that judges, as the\n\u201cprimary law-applying institutions,\u201d have a duty (moral,\nif not also legal) to decide certain sorts of case (e.g., cases where\nthe existing legal rule would by work injustice) by\napplying moral principles or rules which warrant amending or\neven abandoning part of the existing law.  \u201cInclusive\u201d\nlegal positivists temper this by holding that the judicial duty and\nauthorization to depart from existing law by applying moral rules or\nprinciples is restricted to those classes of case where an existing\nsocial-fact sourced legal rule directs the court do so; the effect of\nsuch a directive, it is said, is to include within the legal system\nthe moral rules or principles (if any) thus pointed to.\n\n\nNatural law theory concurs with Raz and Gardner in rejecting the\ninclusivist restriction as ungrounded, but dissents from them in\nholding (as Dworkin does too: Dworkin 1978, 47) that any moral rule or\nprinciple which a court is bound to apply (or reasonably can apply), precisely as\na court, can reasonably be counted or acknowledged as a law, i.e., as a\nrule or principle which should be considered already part of our\nlaw. Against positivists generally, it holds that (i) little or\nnothing turns on whether or not moral principles binding on courts\nprecisely as courts should be called part of our law; but (ii) if\nsomething does turn on the name\u2014if, for example, it be\nrecalled that courts cannot \u201ctake judicial notice\u201d of any\nrule or principle not \u201cpart of our law\u201d (and so, as in\nrespect of rules of foreign law, have to hear evidence of the rule\u2019s\nexistence and content)\u2014it is sounder to say that judicially\napplicable moral rules and principles (unlike applicable foreign law)\nare ipso iure (i.e., precisely as morally and judicially\napplicable) rules of law. Such rules belong to the ius\ngentium portion of our law.\n\n\nDoes this amount to acknowledging that natural law theory is\nsignificantly less concerned than contemporary legal positivist\ntheories to establish the precise boundaries and content of the\nsocial-fact sourced (posited, purely positive) law of our community?\nNot really. For (i) contemporary legal positivist theories have\nabandoned the thesis of \u201cclassical\u201d legal positivists such\nas Bentham that judges and citizens alike should (as a matter of\npolitical-moral obligation) comply with the positive law of their\ncommunity: their treatises or essays on legal theory explicitly or\nimplicitly commend to judges as much as citizens the Hartian\n\u201cThis is law; but it is too iniquitous to be applied or\nobeyed\u201d (Hart 1961, 203; 1994, 208) rather than the Benthamite\n\u201cUnder a government of laws \u2026 obey punctually and \u2026\ncensure freely\u201d (Bentham 1776); so the concern of contemporary legal positivists to distinguish\nposited law from other standards for sound and legitimate adjudication\nturns out, in the last analysis (and despite appearances), to be\nmerely provisional. And on the other hand (ii) natural law theories\nhold as strongly as any positivist theory that sound and legitimate\nadjudication gives priority to a conscientious and craftsmanlike\nattention to social-fact sources and to rules and principles pedigreed\nby such sources, sets them aside only if and to the extent that they\nare \u201ctoo iniquitous to be applied\u201d, and tailors the\nresultant new rule so as to cohere as far as possible with all the\nother (not too iniquitous) doctrines, rules and principles of the\nparticular legal system in which the judge has jurisdiction.\n3.1.1  A test case: the Nuremberg question\n\n\nThe persons known as major German war criminals were tried in 1945 for\noffenses specified in an agreement (\u201cthe London Agreement and\nCharter of 8 August 1945\u201d) made between the states governing\nGermany since its surrender to them. The judges held that the\ndefendants had at all relevant times been bound by (and in many\ninstances had acted in violation of) the principles or rules specified\nin the London Charter, such obligations being derived not, of course,\nfrom the agreement (which was made subsequent to the acts in\nquestion), but rather, as to some of the crimes alleged, from\ninternational law and, as to the alleged \u201ccrimes against\nhumanity,\u201d from the \u201celementary dictates of\nhumanity.\u201d To hold the defendants responsible for violating\nthese rules and dictates, and reject any argument that their acts\u2019\ncompliance with German law could make them lawful acts, was not (so\nthe tribunal ruled) to violate the principle of law and justice that\nno one should be punished except for violation of law.\n\n\nThe result of these rulings might be accounted for (i) by exclusive\npositivism: the tribunal was morally authorized to apply moral rules,\nnotwithstanding that the rules so applied were not rules of law either\nat the time of the crimes or the time of the prosecution. But the\nterms of the rulings (as just summarized) can be accounted\nfor (ii) by inclusive positivism: the Charter was positive law for the\ntribunal and directed it to apply moral rules which by virtue of that\nlegal direction were also legal rules. Still, (iii) natural law\ntheory\u2019s account seems the most explanatory: the moral rules applied\nwere also rules of the \u201chigher law\u201d applicable in all\ntimes and places (and thus in Germany and its territories, before as\nafter the Charter) as a source of argumentation and judgment\n\u201caccording to law\u201d when the social-fact sources which are\nthe normally dominant and quasi-exclusive source of law are, in\njustice, inadequate and insufficient guides to fulfilling obligations\nsuch as the judicial obligation to do justice according to law, or\neveryone\u2019s obligation to behave with elementary humanity even when\nunder orders not to\u2014even if those orders have intra-systemic\nlegal validity according to the formal or social-fact criteria of some\nexisting legal system. And if one has doubts about victors\u2019 justice,\nthose very doubts can likewise appeal to principles of the same higher\nlaw, ius gentium, or law of reason and humanity.\n3.2 Natural law and (purely) positive law as concurrent dimensions of legal reasoning\n\n\nNatural law theory of law thus finds itself, in this respect,\napproximated to by Ronald Dworkin\u2019s account of law and adjudication,\nnot only in frontier situations like Nuremberg but also in the\nday-to-day working of a sophisticated legal system. Normal\nadjudication and judicial reasoning has two dimensions or criteria for\ndistinguishing correctness from incorrectness in judgments. One\ndimension comprises social-fact sources (statutes, precedents,\npractice, etc.), called by Dworkin \u201clegal materials.\u201d The\nother dimension comprises moral standards, presumptively those\nprevalent in the judge\u2019s community but in the last analysis just those\nstandards that the judge can accept as in truth morally sound. An\ninterpretation of our law which is morally sounder will be legally\ncorrect even if it fits the legal materials less closely than\nalternative interpretations, provided that it fits those social-fact\nsources \u201cenough.\u201d The moral standards thus applied, which\nDworkin (in line with natural law theory) treats as capable of being\nmorally objective and true, thus function as a direct source of law (or justification for judicial decision)\nand, in a certain sense, as already law, except when their fit with\nthe whole set of social-fact sources in the relevant community is so\nweak that it would be more accurate (according to Dworkin) to say that\njudges who apply them are applying morality not law (and thus, if they\nsaid they were applying law, would be mistaken or lying\u2014a lie\nwhich Dworkin considers sometimes commendable). Dworkin 1978,\n326\u20137, 340. \n\n\nA theory of law which, unlike Dworkin\u2019s, places itself plainly in the\ntradition of natural law theorizing will be likely to depart from\nthese positions in two ways. (i) It will not accept Dworkin\u2019s thesis\nthat even in very hard cases there is one uniquely correct answer in\nlaw; it will deny his assumption that there is a uniquely correct and\nrationally identifiable measure of how much fit with existing legal\nmaterials (social-fact sources) is \u201cenough\u201d (necessary and\nsufficient) to license using moral standards to identify the legally\ncorrect interpretation of the law. In the absence of such a single\nmeasure, legal reasoning must often\u2014and in very hard cases,\nusually\u2014be content to show that two or three alternative\ninterpretations are distinguished from an indefinitely large number of\nother interpretations by being correct, that is, not wrong (albeit not\nuniquely correct).  (ii) When judges, in order to avoid grave\ninjustice, depart from the settled understanding of the law (and\nperhaps from the clear terms of a decree) and apply an alternative,\nmorally mandated interpretation, regarding themselves as licensed to\ndo so by the higher law of reason, nature and humanity, they need not\nbe lying if they say that in doing so they are both rectifying\nand applying the law (of their state). See 4 below.\n3.3  Implications of the rule-of-law need for positivity\n\n\nIn line with Dworkin\u2019s two-dimensions account (thus qualified),\nnatural law theory will assent to the thesis that Green makes\ncharacteristic of legal positivism:\n\n\n[1] the fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent\nis never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law,\nand [2] the fact that [a law] is unjust, unwise, inefficient or\nimprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting [that it is\nlaw].\n\n\nFor as to [1]: what the rule of law and not of men calls for is the\ninstitution of legal system, a corpus iuris, and so\nwhat a principle of morality (natural law) or ius gentium\nimplies would be an appropriate rule of law is, nevertheless, not yet\na part of our law\u2014still less is a mere \u201cpolicy\u201d\nmade law by being \u201cprudent\u201d or\n\u201cefficient\u201d\u2014unless its content, conceptualization and form\nare so shaped, whether in judicial or other juristic thinking or in\njudgment or legislation, as to cohere with the other parts\n(especially neighboring parts) of our law. \n\n\nAs to [2]: A natural law theory, mindful of the normal desirability of\na rule of law and not of judges (see 1.3), may well be more cautious\nthan Dworkin himself is in departing from the settled (social-fact\nsource-based) law.  On those occasions where such a departure is\nmorally warranted, the theory will suggest that the judge is\nauthorized to proceed according to the higher and perennial law of\nhumanity, the ius gentium or set of universal principles of\nlaw and justice common to all civilized peoples, which deprives\nsettled law\u2014more precisely, what has been accepted in the\njurisdiction as being settled law\u2014of its directiveness for\nsubjects and judges alike. Is this moral authorization also\n\u2018legal\u2019 and \u201caccording to law\u201d?  Is the\nsettled law which the judge is morally authorized to set aside thereby\nbeing treated, even prior to the judge\u2019s handing down of judgment, as\nnot law?  The following section argues that that question should be\nanswered both Yes and No.\n4. \u201cLex iniusta non est lex\u201d? Do seriously unjust laws bind? Legally?\n\n\nIn such a case, does the law as settled by social-fact sources, in\nlosing its directiveness for judges and citizens, lose also its legal\nvalidity?  The answer depends upon the discursive context in which the\nquestion arises. If a course of reflection or discourse makes it\nappropriate to acknowledge the rule\u2019s \u201csettled\u201d or\n\u201cposited\u201d character as cognizable by reference to\nsocial-fact sources, one can say that it is legally valid though too\nunjust to be obeyed or applied. Or if the discursive context makes it\nappropriate instead to point up its lack of directiveness for judges\nand subjects alike, one can say that the rule, despite its links to\nsocial-fact sources, is not only not morally directive but is also\nlegally invalid. Each way of speaking tells an important part of the\ntruth, or rather, tells the truth with an emphasis which differs from\nthe other\u2019s.\n\n                 \nThe meaning of \u201can unjust law is not a law\u201d is essentially\nidentical to Hart\u2019s \u201cThis is law but too iniquitous to be\napplied or obeyed\u201d (or availed of as a defense). The excitement\nand hostility aroused amongst modern legal theorists (notably Hart) by\nthe former way of speaking is unwarranted. No one has difficulty in\nunderstanding locutions such as \u201can invalid argument is no\nargument,\u201d \u201ca disloyal friend is not a friend,\u201d\n\u201ca quack medicine is not medicine,\u201d and so\nforth. \u201cLex iniusta non est lex\u201d has the same\nlogic; it acknowledges, in its opening words, that what is in question\nis in certain important respects\u2014perhaps normally and\npresumptively decisive respects\u2014a law, but then in\nits withdrawal or denial of that predicate it affirms that, since\njustice is the very point of having and respecting law at all, this\nparticular law\u2019s deficiency in justice deprives it of the decisive\nsignificance which all law purports to have. It is thus law only in a\nsense that should be judged\u2014especially when law is regarded, as\nby Hart himself, as a kind of reason or purported reason for \naction\u2014to be a distorted and secondary, non-central sense.\n\n\nNote:  Classical political theory, as expounded by Plato, Aristotle and\nAquinas, makes regular use of this distinction between central and\nperverted or otherwise marginal instances of an analogical concept or\nterm, and so Aquinas never says simply \u201cunjust law is not\nlaw\u201d but rather \u201cunjust law is not straightforwardly or\nunqualifiedly [simpliciter] law\u201d or \u201cis a\nperversion of law\u201d, and similar statements. Still, he does\nelsewhere say that \u201can unjust judgment [of a court] is not a\njudgment\u201d and it seems clear that he might similarly have used\nthe simplified or slogan-form locution, about law, as short-hand. \n\n\n\n\nAll this seems to have been overlooked by Hart in his polemic (Hart\n1961, 204\u20137; 1994, 208\u201312) against \u201clex iniusta\nnon est lex.\u201d Hart\u2019s argument that use of the slogan must\ntend to discourage or confuse the moral critique of law seems\nhistorically and logically indefensible. The slogan is unintelligible\nsave as an expression of and incitement to engaging in such critiques;\nit can scarcely be rejected without first misquoting it, as Hart and\nthose who employ his argument almost invariably do, averting their\ngaze from the slogan\u2019s first predication and implied assertion: that the\nunjust rule in question is a rule of law.\n\n\nSome theories have adopted certain main tenets of natural law theory,\nand professed to be natural law theories, but have asserted that even\nthe most unjust laws create an obligation to obey which is both legal\nand moral. Kant\u2019s (see Alexy 2002, 117\u2013121) is such a theory: a\nlegal system can consist entirely of positive law but must be\n\u201cpreceded by a natural law that establishe[s] the legislator\u2019s\nauthority\u2026to bind others simply by his arbitrary action.\u201d\nBut this purported natural-law basic norm looks not to the justice of\nthe content of the posited legal rules, but exclusively to the need\nfor legal certainty and civic peace, which Kant takes to exclude any\nright to resist unjust laws and any denial that they are fully\nlegal. Alexy has pointed out the confusions and inconsistencies in\nKant\u2019s attempts to evade the classic position that laws whose\ninjustice is sufficiently grave can and should be denied to have the\nlegal character predicable of laws that citizens and courts, precisely\nas courts, are morally and juridically entitled to treat as\u2014or\nas if they are\u2014not law. In this as in many other respects,\nseventeenth and eighteenth century philosophical developments (like\ntheir twentieth and twenty-first century counterparts) were not so\nmuch progress as regress. But precisely how the classic position\nitself should be formulated, explained and applied today is debated\nbetween Alexy, Finnis and others (Alexy 2013; Finnis 2014; Crowe 2019).\n5. Can general theories of law be value-free? moral-value-free?\n\n\nDescriptions of the valuations made by particular persons or societies\ncan of course be value-free. Doubtless the historian, detective or\nother observer thinks there is some value in making the investigation\nand resultant description, but that valuation in no way need enter\ninto the description. Still less need the description either approve\nor disapprove of the valuations which it reports.  But the situation\nis different if one\u2019s aspiration is to offer a general\naccount of human practices or institutions, such as law,\nfriendship, constitutions, and so forth. Here one confronts the\nnecessity of selecting and prioritizing not merely the investigation\nitself but rather some one set of concepts (and corresponding terms)\nfrom among (or over and above) the range of terms and concepts already\nemployed in the self-understanding of the individuals and groups under\n(or available for) study.\n\n\nWhere the subject-matter of the projected descriptive general\naccount is some practice or institution devised by (more or less\nadequate exercises of) reason, and addressed to the rational\ndeliberations of individuals and groups, there will normally be no\ngood reason not to prioritise those forms of the practice or\ninstitution which are more rational, more reasonable, more responsive\nto reasons, than other forms of the \u201csame\u201d or analogous\npractices and institutions. The standard for assessing reasonableness\nfor this theoretical purpose is, in the last analysis, the set of\ncriteria of reasonableness that the descriptive theorist would use in\ndealing with similar practical issues in his or her own life.\n\n\nThis necessity of value-laden selection of concepts and terms for use\nin a general theory of social realities such as law is evidenced in\nthe work of Max Weber, prophet of \u201cvalue-free\u201d social\nscience. His account, for example, of forms of domination\n(Herrschaft) identifies three pure, central, characteristic\ntypes (Idealtypen): charismatic, traditional, and rational\n(bureaucratic, legal). But the accounts of the first two types are\nalmost entirely in terms of how they differ from the rational type,\nwhose rationality is self-evident to Weber and his readers on the\nbasis of their own knowledge of human goods (basic aspects of human\nwellbeing) and related practical truths. See Finnis 1985,\n170\u201372. Natural law theory, as one sees it practiced already in\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics and Politics, makes these\nvaluations by the theorist overt and explicit (not hidden and\nembarrassed), and subjects them to rational scrutiny and debate.\n\n\nRaz, Dickson, and others accept that some such valuation is necessary,\nbut deny that it is moral: Dickson 2001. But once one begins to deal\nin reasons, can anything other than good reasons count?  If moral\nreason is nothing more than practical reason at full stretch, fully\ncritical and adequate as reason, moral reasons will have a decisive\nplace in concept-formation in social science including descriptive\ngeneral theory of law. And this will not have the effect feared by\nHart, viz. of leaving the study of wicked laws or institutions to some\nother discipline: Hart 1961, 205; 1994, 209. On the contrary, they are\na subject of lively attention in such a theory, precisely because of\ntheir opposition to legal systems of a (substantively and\nprocedurally) morally good kind. Aristotle\u2019s Politics, though\nnot methodologically flawless overall, is a primary witness to this\nsort of clear-eyed acknowledgment and depiction of unreasonable social\nforms, practices and institutions within a descriptive theory oriented\nby the moral judgments of the theorist.\n\n                 \nStill, descriptive social theory is only a subordinate aspect of\nnatural law theories of law. Their primary focus is typically on\nidentifying the conditions under which law is justified, both in the\nsense in which law can and should be preferable to anarchy or tyranny\nor even benevolent \u201crule of men,\u201d and in the sense in\nwhich this or that legal principle, institution or rule can be judged\nto be preferable to alternative reasons or purported reasons for\naction. As Green 2003 says:\n\n\nEvaluative argument is, of course, central to the philosophy of law\nmore generally. No legal philosopher can be only a legal\npositivist. A complete theory of law requires also an account of what\nkinds of things could possibly count as merits of law (must law be\nefficient or elegant as well as just?); of what role law should play\nin adjudication (should valid law always be applied?); of what claim\nlaw has on our obedience (is there a duty to obey?); and also of the\npivotal questions of what laws we should have and whether we should\nhave law at all. Legal positivism does not aspire to answer these\nquestions, though its claim that the existence and content of law\ndepends only on social facts does give them shape.\n\n\nMight it not be better to say: no legal philosopher need, or should,\nbe a legal positivist?  For law\u2019s dependence upon social facts is\nfully acknowledged, and also accounted for, in natural law theories of\nlaw. And this is not a \u201cconcession\u201d by natural law\ntheorists, for their main positions were clearly articulated by\nAquinas, many centuries before legal positivism emerged with its\nchallenge to (what it took to be) natural law theory.  Positivist\ncritiques of natural law theory, when they do not rest upon scepticism\nabout the possibility of moral judgment, a scepticism implicitly\ndisavowed in the above passage, rest on misunderstanding of passages\nfrom the works of natural law theorists. On such misunderstandings,\nsee Finnis 1980, 23\u201355; Soper 1992.\n\n\nAgain: How could such fundamental questions as \u201cShould we have\nlaw at all?\u201d be \u201cgiven shape\u201d by the positivist\nthesis that law\u2019s existence and content depends only on social facts?\nDoes not Green\u2019s claim invert the reasonable order of inquiry and\nreflection?  Basic human needs and circumstances powerfully suggest to\npeople in virtually all times and places that they should make and\nuphold some norms of the kind we call law, norms which will depend\ndirectly and for the most part on social facts such as custom,\nauthoritative rule-making, and adjudication. Legal philosophy retraces\nand clarifies, critically, that elemental practical reasoning,\nsomewhat as Hart did in Hart 1961, where he constructs a\ndescriptive-explanatory account of law (i.e., refines his and our\nconcept or understanding of law) by explaining how rules differ from\nhabits, how powers have different functions and social value from\nobligations and so are not aptly reducible to obligations (and so also why power-conferring rules are distinct from duty-imposing rules), and how\n\u201cprimary\u201d rules for outlawing gross violence, theft and\nfraud need, by reason of their lack of certainty in content\nand application and their immobility, to be supplemented by\n\u201csecondary\u201d rules of recognition, adjudication and change,\nthe remedial supplementation that shifts a society into the domain and\nrule of law and legal system. May not those elements in Hart\u2019s book be\ntaken as an instance of natural law legal theory done in a primarily\ndescriptive (rather than primarily justificatory) mode, and with\nincomplete scrutiny of the resources of practical reason, resources\nbeing drawn upon by the whole explanatory general description of law?\nDoes not Hart\u2019s description, despite its incompleteness, work as well\nas it does precisely because it disinters some elementary\njustifications conceived and put to use by the people whose\nactivities provide the material for the descriptions?  Does he not\nshare the deep methodology of Aristotle and the natural law tradition\n(Finnis 2003) in making his identification of what law is (of\n\u201cthe concept of law\u201d) depend upon his account of\nwhy law is a reasonable response to common human needs?\n\nAgain, the question perhaps most central to a general theory of law,\nnamely whether law can have a nature, and if so whether it is to be\nunderstood on the model of artefacts, or alternatively by study of concepts\n(\u201cconceptual analysis\u201d), seems to tackled with most\nexplicitness and attention to different and related kinds of\nsubject-matter by theorists working in the philosophical tradition\nthat is or concerns the topic of this entry: Murphy 2015; Finnis\n2020.\n\nNone of this is to say that a sound legal theory of the kind explained\nin this entry need be called \u201cnatural law theory.\u201d Like\nall philosophy, it should be done by considering propositions, not\nlabels.\n6. Other elements of natural law theory\n\n\nIntended to be part of a comprehensive theory of practical reasons\nthat are fit to direct us to the common good of each of our\ncommunities and its members, any natural law theory of law brings to\nbear on law all the theses proposed and defended in natural law\ntheory\u2019s moral and political parts and in a sound understanding of the\nhuman makeup and of the lasting characteristics of our circumstances.\nSo, besides the questions listed by Green as quoted in section 5\nabove, issues such as the following three (see others in Finnis 2002)\nare treated by natural law theory as integral to legal science, theory\nor philosophy.\n6.1 Intention in action and utterance\n\n\nRules of law are propositions of practical reason, apt for being taken\nas directive in the deliberations of law\u2019s individual subjects towards\njudgment, choice (decision), and action (including chosen\nforbearance). So a sound theory of law will have an integrated and\ncritical understanding of the structure of chosen action, particularly\nof the relationships between the intending of ends, the adoption of\nmeans, the dual character of almost all ends as also means, and of\nalmost all means as also ends, and the necessity and normal\npossibility of freely choosing between options which embody or promise\nbenefits and disadvantages incommensurable (incompletely\ncommensurable) (Finnis 1997) with the benefits and disadvantages of\nthe alternative options. Such an understanding will clarify the often\nsomewhat crude accounts given in criminal law dogmatics (case law and\ntextbooks) of actus reus andmens rea, accounts which\noften fail to distinguish been action as a physically or\nconventionally demarcated chunk of behavior and action as the carrying\nout of the choice of an option, that is of a proposal shaped and thus\ngiven a privileged description in the deliberations of the acting\nsubject. The difference between intended or chosen means (or ends) and\nforeseeable or even fully foreseen effects\n(\u201cside-effects\u201d), like the consequent difference between\nthe moral and, presumptively, legal standards applicable respectively\nto intended and not-intended effects, is psychologically and morally\nreal. But it is often distorted by a simplistic legal dogmatics too\naverse to the (very real) risk that defendants will prevaricate about\nwhat they had in mind. What counts, and can often be inferred despite\nprevarication, is the act-description under which the behavior chosen\nwas attractive to the defendant in his or her actual deliberations (as\ndistinct from rationalizing act-descriptions adopted to present that\nmotivation in a better light).\n\n\nThe reality of intention in the distinct but related field of\ncommunication of meaning will also be explored and defended by a\nnatural law theory of law. This does not involve an unqualified and\nsimple originalism in constitutional interpretation, or a simple\ndenial of the characteristic insistence of legal dogmatics that the\nintention of the parties to agreements or declarations is to be\nascertained \u201cobjectively (not subjectively),\u201d that is, by\nreference to what a reasonable observer would have taken the statement\nin issue to mean. For: such an observer (and thus the\n\u201cobjective\u201d viewpoint) will presumptively have given\nprimacy in this interpretation to what (as far as the observer can\ndiscern in the circumstances of the statement\u2019s making [= utterance])\nthe statement\u2019s author actually (\u201csubjectively\u201d) meant (=\nintended to express/state).\n6.2  Responsibility and punishment\n\n\nCriminal responsibility (guilt) is primarily for acts and consequences\nintended by the offender. Liability for negligence is relatively\nexceptional in modern criminal law, though the predominant form of\nliability in modern law of compensation (\u201ccivil\nlaw\u201d). (The duties and standards of care used to attribute\ntortious/delictual/civil liability are in part straightforwardly moral\nand in part conventional\u2014in neither part are they securely\nsource-based in the sense of sources given unconditional primacy in\nlegal positivism.)\n\n\nThe legal enunciation of rules of criminal law (mostly\n\u201cprohibitions\u201d) has as its primary goal the elimination or\nat least discouraging of the specified kinds of action (or\nomission). In this phase of the legal institution of criminal law and\npunishment, the goal can be called deterrence. The fact that this goal\nworks partly by enforcement and application of the threatened sanction\nin the event of violation and conviction does not, however, entail\nthat deterrence is the formative or even the primary end of\npunishment. Indeed, the institution of punishment has its primary\nsense and justification, not in deterrence, but in the restoration of\nthat presumptively fair balance of burdens and advantages which\noffenders upset, precisely in choosing to prefer their own purposes\nand advantage to restraining their action so as to avoid violating the\nlaw. In preferring that self-preferential option, offenders help\nthemselves to an advantage over all who do restrain themselves so as\nto respect the law. The offenders thereby upset the presumptively fair\nbalance of advantages and burdens between themselves and the\nlaw-abiding. The primary purpose of punishment thus can reasonably be\nto restore that disturbed balance by depriving convicted offenders of\ntheir unfairly gained advantage\u2014excess freedom of \naction\u2014by imposing upon them measures, punishments, whose precise\npurpose is to restrict their freedom of action, whether by fines or\nimprisonment, proportionately to the degree to which they indulged\ntheir self-preference. Punishment in that way seeks to ensure that,\nover the span of time running from before the offence to the\nundergoing of the penalty, no one gains an advantage over fellow\ncitizens by offending.\n\n\nThus, while compensation in civil law (tort, delict, etc.) rectifies\nthe disturbed balance of advantages and burdens as between tortfeasors\nand their victims, punishment in criminal (penal) law\nrectifies the relationship between offenders and all the\nlaw-abiding members of the community. This retributive\njustification (general justifying aim) of punishment explains why\nmental competence and mens rea are standard legal\npre-conditions of criminal guilt and liability to punishment. It is\ncompatible with concurrent goals of deterrence, protection and reform,\nas bonus side-effects of the retributive sentence, and as organizing\naims of specific measures and features e.g., of a prison regimen. It\nboth presupposes and reinforces the reality that the political\ncommunity in question stands to offenders and law-abiding alike as\nour community.\n6.3 Each legal system is of and for a particular political community\n\n\nExamination of (i) how one legal system becomes independent of another\nby lawful processes and (ii) how parts of a legal system (e.g., its\nconstitution, or its rules for identifying office-holders) are\nreplaced by the unlawful processes of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or\nrevolution demonstrates (see Raz 1979, 100\u2013109) that the\nidentity of a subsisting legal system as one and the same system of\nlegal norms cannot be explained (or even coherently described) by an\naccount which refers only to the norms and their inter-relationships\nas validating norms and validated norms. The non-momentary identity of\na legal system is a function of the subsisting identity of the\ncommunity whose legal system it is. Legal theory is sub-alternated to\nthe historical understanding (including self-understanding) of a\ncommunity and its members as being this\ncommunity\u2014paradigmatically, this nation-state\u2014rather\nthan some accidental sequence or agglomeration of persons and events,\nand this understanding must be in some substantial measure\nnon-dependent upon the legal norms that the community may succeed in\nconstituting for itself and its members. Doubtless the shared purpose\nof living together under a rule of law, and the shared memory of a\nshared acknowledgment or recognition of such laws as our laws, are\nnormally important components of such a shared understanding of\npolitical-communal and legal identity. But other shared purposes,\nmemories and dispositions to act must be also be substantially\npresent, if the phenomena of lawful independence and revolutionary\nconstitutional change are to be as they are.\n\n\nThe not uncritical realism of natural law theory, evidenced in its\napproach to the realities of intention as distinct from foresight and\ninattention, and of self-preferential choice and the differing\nrelationships between (i) offender and law-abiding and (ii) tortfeasor\nand victim, similarly enables it to undertake a critical reflection,\nwithin legal theory broadly understood, on the kinds of community\ncapable of sustaining and being ordered in part by a legal system.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexy, Robert, 2002, <em>The Argument from Injustice: A Reply to\nLegal Positivism</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, \u201cSome Reflections on the Ideal\nDimension of Law and on the Legal Philosophy of John Finnis\u201d,\n<em>American Journal of Jurisprudence</em>, 58: 97.", "Bentham, Jeremy, 1776, <em>A Fragment on Government</em>,\ned.
