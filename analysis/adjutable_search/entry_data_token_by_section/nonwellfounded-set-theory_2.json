    "main_text": "Circular Phenomena in Set Theory || Infinite trees\n1.2 Infinite trees\n\n We want to move from streams to a more complicated example, infinite\ntrees.  Some of the points that we make will be closely related to\nwhat we have seen for streams, and some will raise new issues.\n\n Here is a class of objects which we shall call\n trees:[4]\n\nThe variables x and y alone are trees.\nIf t is a tree, then adding a single node labeled \u2022\nas a new root with t as its only subtree gives a tree.\nIf s and t are trees, then adding a single node\nlabeled * as a new root with s as the left subtree and\nt as the right subtree again gives a tree.\nA tree is that which can be obtained by applying the operations any number of times (including infinite applications).\n\n\n Trees may be specified by tree systems (of equations).  Here\nis one such system:\n\n\n\n (6)\n \n \n\n\ns\u00a0\u00a0\n \u2248 \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\u00a0\u00a0\n \u2248\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022|s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\u00a0\u00a0\n \u2248 \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Again, we use the \u2248 notation in variables for which we want to\nsolve, and we superscript variables with a dagger in the solution.  In\nthis case, the one and only solution of this system might be pictured\nas\n\n\n\n\ns\u2020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n =\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\u2020\u00a0\u00a0\n = \n\u2022|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\u2020\u00a0\u00a0\n = \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It will be useful to recast the definition of our trees in terms of\npairs and triples:\n\nThe symbols x and y alone are trees.\nIf t is a tree, then\n\u27e8\u2022,\u2009t\u27e9 \n is  a tree.\nIf s and t are trees, then\n\u27e8*,\u2009s,\u2009t\u27e9 \n is a tree.\nTrees may be \u201cinfinitely deep\u201d.\n\n\n Then our system above is\n\n\n\ns\n \u2248 \n\u27e8*,\u2009t,\u2009u\u27e9 \n\n\nt\n \u2248 \n\u27e8\u2022,\u2009s\u27e9 \n\n\nu\n \u2248 \n\u27e8*,\u2009x,\u2009y\u27e9 \n\n\n\n\n So now we have something that looks more like what we have seen with\nstreams.  But with streams we had an unraveled form, and so we might\nwonder what the unraveled form of trees is.  To some extent, it would\nbe the pictures that we have already seen.  In particular, one could\ntake a tree as we have defined them and give a description of how one\nwould construct the picture.  (The full construction would take forever,\nof course, but the same is true of our work on streams.)  Conversely,\ngiven a picture, one could set down a tree system for it, where a\n\u201ctree system\u201d is a system of equations as in equation (6).\n(In general, the tree system would be infinite, but if you find a\nregular structure in the picture, then the system could be\nfinite.)\n\n On the other hand, pictures are not entirely respectable as standard\nmathematical objects, despite the work that has gone on and continues\nto go on to rehabilitate them.  For work on trees, one would need a\nmore complicated set of definitions.  We are not going to present any\nof this.\n\nMore \u2018cheating\u2019. Let Tr be the\nset of trees that we have been discussing.  Then our definition in\nterms of Tr would have:\n\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0 Tr\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\n {x, y} \u222a ({\u2022} \u00d7 Tr) \u222a\n  ({*} \u00d7 Tr \u00d7 Tr).\n \n\n Now again the standard modeling in set theory gives us a problem: one\ncan prove in ZF set theory that Tr has no solution whatsoever. \nAnd\nthis runs afoul of our pictures and intuition.  The standard way out\nis to change the equals sign = in (7) to something else.  For most\nmathematical work this is perfectly fine, but it is the kind of move\nwe explore in this entry.\n",
