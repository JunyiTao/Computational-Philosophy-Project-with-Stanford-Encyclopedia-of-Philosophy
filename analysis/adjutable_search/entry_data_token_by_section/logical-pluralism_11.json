    "main_text": "Logical Pluralism via Linguistic Pluralism || The Principle of Tolerance\n4.1 The Principle of Tolerance\n\nIn \u00a717 of The Logical Syntax of Language, Carnap\nwrites:\n\n\nIn logic there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to build his own\nlogic, i.e. his own language, as he wishes. All that is required of\nhim is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods\nclearly, and give syntactical rules instead of philosophical\narguments. (Carnap 1937: \u00a717)\n\n\nTwo kinds of tolerance are expressed in this passage. The more famous\nis Carnap\u2019s tolerance for different languages, and it is\nmotivated both by the thought that verbal disputes are not really\ntheoretical disputes about the domain we are describing. At best they\nare practical disputes about the most useful and efficient ways to use\nwords, given our goals, and by the thought that such practical matters\nare best left to those working in the relevant field. As Carnap wrote\nlater,\n\n\nLet us grant to those who work in any special fields of investigation\nthe freedom to use any form of expression which seems useful to them.\nThe work in the field will sooner or later lead to the elimination of\nthose forms which have no useful function. Let us be cautious in\nmaking assertions and critical in examining them, but tolerant in\npermitting linguistic forms. (Carnap 1950 [1958: 221], emphasis\nin original)\n\n\nThe second kind of tolerance is a tolerance for different\nlogics, something that is naturally construed as a kind of\nlogical pluralism. The phrase \u201ceveryone is at liberty to build\nhis own logic\u201d suggests that no-one would be making a mistake in\nso doing. And it seems clear from the phrase that immediately\nfollows\u2014\u201ci.e., his own language\u201d\u2014that Carnap\ntakes the two kinds of toleration to be extremely close, perhaps he\neven thinks that linguistic tolerance and logical tolerance amount to\nthe same thing.\n\nIt might not be obvious to a modern reader why that is the case. Why\ncould we not be tolerant of alternative languages, which seems only\nsensible, without thereby committing ourselves to being tolerant of\nalternative logics? Moreover, logicians who disagree about which\nsentential logic is correct (e.g., classical or intuitionist) seem to\nbe able to use the same language (containing \u2227, \u2192, \u00ac,\netc.) even while they suppose that one logic is right for that\nlanguage, and one logic wrong. If that position is coherent, then one\nside must have made a mistake after all, implying they were not really\n\u201cat liberty to build their own logic\u201d.\n\nThat view seems at least an open possibility, though whether two rival\nlogicians are really advocating different logics for the same language\ncan be difficult to determine. It will not be sufficient that they are\nusing the same symbols, since they might each be using the symbols\nwith different meanings in which case they will be using different\nlanguages. But what more, beyond using the same expressions, is\nrequired?\n\nThis is a question to which there are many rival answers, even for the\nmost basic logical constants. Perhaps the expressions must denote the\nsame truth-function, or have the same intension, or share a mode of\npresentation, or a character, or a conceptual role. But The\nLogical Syntax of Language was published (in German) in 1934,\nbefore the innovations of Grice, Gentzen, Montague, Kaplan, Lewis,\nPutnam or Kripke, (and, moreover before Tarski\u2019s (1936 [1956])\n\u201cOn the Concept of Logical Consequence\u201d (Schurz 1999)) and\nin an environment in which Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus was a powerful influence. Carnap has quite\ndefinite and explicit ideas about both meaning and logic, and these\nhelp to explain why he thinks linguistic tolerance leads straight to\nlogical tolerance. In the foreword to The Logical Syntax of\nLanguage he writes:\n\n\nUp to now, in constructing a language, the procedure has usually been,\nfirst to assign a meaning to the fundamental mathematico-logical\nsymbols, and then to consider what sentences and inferences are seen\nto be logically correct in accordance with this meaning. Since the\nassignment of the meaning is expressed in words, and is, in\nconsequence, inexact, no conclusion arrived at in this way can very\nwell be otherwise than inexact and ambiguous. The connection will only\nbecome clear when approached from the opposite direction: let any\npostulates and any rules of inference be chosen arbitrarily; then this\nchoice, whatever it may be, will determine what meaning is to be\nassigned to the fundamental logical symbols. (Carnap 1937: xv)\n\n\nAccording to Carnap then, the right way to specify a language is to\npick some expressions, and then give the rules of inference for them.\nIt is this specification which gives the expressions their meanings,\nand so, first, there is no question of their being the wrong rules for\nthe expressions\u2014everybody is at liberty to build his own logic,\nto choose whatever rules he likes\u2014and second, to be tolerant\nabout language choice is already to be tolerant about choice of\nlogic\u2014for languages so-conceived come with different logics\nalready \u201cbuilt in\u201d.\n\nOne of Carnap\u2019s reasons for accepting logical pluralism is that\nhe saw it as making space for innovation in logic. In the foreword to\nThe Logical Syntax of Language he writes:\n\n\nUp to the present, there has been only a very slight deviation, in a\nfew points here and there, from the form of language developed by\nRussell which has already become classical. For instance, certain\nsentential forms (such as unlimited existential sentences) and rules\nof inference (such as the law of excluded middle), have been\neliminated by certain authors. On the other hand, a number of\nextensions have been attempted, and several interesting, many-valued\ncalculi analogous to the two-valued calculus of sentences have been\nevolved, and have resulted finally in a logic of probability.\nLikewise, so-called intensional sentences have been introduced and,\nwith their aid a logic of modality developed. The fact that no\nattempts have been made to venture still further from the classical\nforms is perhaps due to the widely held opinion that any such\ndeviations must be justified\u2014that is, the new language-form must\nbe proved to be \u201ccorrect\u201d and to constitute a faithful\nrendering of \u201cthe true logic\u201d.\n\nTo eliminate this standpoint, together with the pseudo-problems and\nwearisome controversies with arise as a result of it, is one of the\nchief tasks of this book. (Carnap 1937: xiv\u2013xv)\n\n\nThis passage highlights several features of Carnap\u2019s logical\npluralism and philosophy of logic more generally. It seems clear that\nhe intended his logical pluralism to be both\n\u201chorizontal\u201d\u2014that is, to allow for different logics\nat the same level, such as classical and intuitionist sentential\nlogics\u2014as well as \u201cvertical\u201d\u2014allowing for\nlogics for new kinds of expression, such as intensional logics and\nsecond-order logic (the terminology is from Eklund 2012). Furthermore\nthe passage expresses a \u201clogic-first\u201d approach, and\nrejects a \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d approach, suggesting that\nrather than trying to figure out which is the best logic a\npriori from first principles (the \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d\napproach), we should let logicians develop languages as they like, and\nthen make our judgements based on how things turn out.\n\nThe most obvious contrast here is with W. V. O. Quine, who criticised\nsecond-order logic as \u201cset-theory in sheep\u2019s\nclothing\u201d and rejected tense and modal logics on philosophical\ngrounds (Quine 1986: ch. 5; 1953a; 1953b [1966]; Burgess 1997; 2009).\nSuch a stand-off is quite intriguing, given Quine\u2019s rejection of\nsuch \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d approaches in epistemology more\ngenerally.\n",
