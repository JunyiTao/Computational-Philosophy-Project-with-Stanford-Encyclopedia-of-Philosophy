    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and the Imitation Game\n1. Turing (1950) and the Imitation Game\n\nTuring (1950) describes the following kind of game. Suppose that we\nhave a person, a machine, and an interrogator. The interrogator is in\na room separated from the other person and the machine. The object of\nthe game is for the interrogator to determine which of the other two\nis the person, and which is the machine. The interrogator knows the\nother person and the machine by the labels \u2018X\u2019\nand \u2018Y\u2019\u2014but, at least at the beginning of\nthe game, does not know which of the other person and the machine is\n\u2018X\u2019\u2014and at the end of the game says either\n\u2018X is the person and Y is the machine\u2019\nor \u2018X is the machine and Y is the\nperson\u2019. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to the\nperson and the machine of the following kind: \u201cWill X\nplease tell me whether X plays chess?\u201d Whichever of the\nmachine and the other person is X must answer questions that\nare addressed to X. The object of the machine is to try to\ncause the interrogator to mistakenly conclude that the machine is the\nother person; the object of the other person is to try to help the\ninterrogator to correctly identify the machine. About this game,\nTuring (1950) says:\n\nI believe that in about fifty years\u2019 time it will be possible to\nprogramme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109,\nto make them play the imitation game so well that an average\ninterrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the\nright identification after five minutes of questioning. \u2026 I\nbelieve that at the end of the century the use of words and general\neducated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to\nspeak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.\n\n\nThere are at least two kinds of questions that can be raised about\nTuring\u2019s predictions concerning his Imitation Game. First, there\nare empirical questions, e.g., Is it true that we now\u2014or will\nsoon\u2014have made computers that can play the imitation game so\nwell that an average interrogator has no more than a 70 percent chance\nof making the right identification after five minutes of questioning?\nSecond, there are conceptual questions, e.g., Is it true that, if an\naverage interrogator had no more than a 70 percent chance of making\nthe right identification after five minutes of questioning, we should\nconclude that the machine exhibits some level of thought, or\nintelligence, or mentality?\n\nThere is little doubt that Turing would have been disappointed by the\nstate of play at the end of the twentieth century. Participants in the\nLoebner Prize Competition\u2014an annual event in which computer\nprogrammes are submitted to the Turing Test\u2014 had come nowhere\nnear the standard that Turing envisaged. A quick look at the\ntranscripts of the participants for the preceding decade reveals that\nthe entered programs were all easily detected by a range of\nnot-very-subtle lines of questioning. Moreover, major players in the\nfield regularly claimed that the Loebner Prize Competition was an\nembarrassment precisely because we were still so far from having a\ncomputer programme that could carry out a decent conversation for a\nperiod of five minutes\u2014see, for example, Shieber (1994). It was\nwidely conceded on all sides that the programs entered in the Loebner\nPrize Competition were designed solely with the aim of winning the\nminor prize of best competitor for the year, with no thought that the\nembodied strategies would actually yield something capable of passing\nthe Turing Test.\n\nAt the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century, it is\nunclear how much has changed. On the one hand, there have been\ninteresting developments in language generators. In particular, the\nrelease of Open AI\u2019s GPT-3 (Brown, et al. 2020, Other Internet\nResources) has prompted a flurry of excitement. GPT-3 is quite good at\ngenerating fiction, poetry, press releases, code, music, jokes,\ntechnical manuals, and news articles. Perhaps, as Chalmers speculates\n(2020, Other Internet Resources), GPT-3 \u201csuggests a potential\nmindless path to artificial general intelligence\u201d. But, of\ncourse, GPT-3 is not close to passing the Turing Test: GPT-3 neither\nperceives nor acts, and it is, at best, highly contentious whether it\nis a site of understanding. What remains to be seen is whether, within\nthe next couple of generations of language generators \u2013 GPT-4 or\nGPT-5 \u2013 we have something that can be linked to perceptual\ninputs and behavioural outputs in a way that does produce something\ncapable of passing the Turing Test. (For further discussion, see\nFloridi and Chiriatti (2020).)\n\nOn the other hand, as, for example, Floridi (2008) complains, there\nare other ways in which progress has been frustratingly slow. In 2014,\nclaims emerged that, because the computer program Eugene\nGoostman had fooled 33% of judges in the Turing Test 2014\ncompetition, it had \u201cpassed the Turing Test\u201d. But there\nhave been other one-off competitions in which similar results have\nbeen achieved. Back in 1991, PC Therapist had 50% of judges\nfooled. And, in a 2011 demonstration, Cleverbot had an even\nhigher success rate. In all three of these cases, the size of the\ntrial was very small, and the result was not reliably projectible: in\nno case were there strong grounds for holding that an average\ninterrogator had no more than a 70% chance of making the right\ndetermination about the relevant program after five minutes of\nquestioning. Moreover\u2014and much more importantly\u2014we must\ndistinguish between the test the Turing proposed, and the particular\nprediction that he made about how things would be by the end of the\ntwentieth century. The percentage chance of making the correct\nidentification, the time interval over which the test takes place, and\nthe number of conversational exchanges required are all adjustable\nparameters in the Test, despite the fact that they are fixed in the\nparticular prediction that Turing made. Even if Turing was very far\nout in the prediction that he made about how things would be by the\nend of the twentieth century, it remains possible that the test that\nhe proposes is a good one. However, before one can endorse the\nsuggestion that the Turing Test is good, there are various objections\nthat ought to be addressed.\n\nSome people have suggested that the Turing Test is chauvinistic: it\nonly recognizes intelligence in things that are able to sustain a\nconversation with us. Why couldn\u2019t it be the case that there are\nintelligent things that are unable to carry on a conversation, or, at\nany rate, unable to carry on a conversation with creatures like us?\n(See, for example, French (1990).) Perhaps the intuition behind this\nquestion can be granted; perhaps it is unduly chauvinistic to insist\nthat anything that is intelligent has to be capable of sustaining a\nconversation with us. (On the other hand, one might think that, given\nthe availability of suitably qualified translators, it ought to be\npossible for any two intelligent agents that speak different languages\nto carry on some kind of conversation.) But, in any case, the charge\nof chauvinism is completely beside the point. What Turing claims is\nonly that, if something can carry out a conversation with us, then we\nhave good grounds to suppose that that thing has intelligence of the\nkind that we possess; he does not claim that only something that can\ncarry out a conversation with us can possess the kind of intelligence\nthat we have.\n\nOther people have thought that the Turing Test is not sufficiently\ndemanding: we already have anecdotal evidence that quite unintelligent\nprograms (e.g., ELIZA\u2014for details of which, see Weizenbaum\n(1966)) can seem to ordinary observers to be loci of intelligence for\nquite extended periods of time. Moreover, over a short period of\ntime\u2014such as the five minutes that Turing mentions in his\nprediction about how things will be in the year 2000\u2014it might\nwell be the case that almost all human observers could be taken in by\ncunningly designed but quite unintelligent programs. However, it is\nimportant to recall that, in order to pass Turing\u2019s Test, it is\nnot enough for the computer program to fool \u201cordinary\nobservers\u201d in circumstances other than those in which the test\nis supposed to take place. What the computer program has to be able to\ndo is to survive interrogation by someone who knows that one of the\nother two participants in the conversation is a machine. Moreover, the\ncomputer program has to be able to survive such interrogation with a\nhigh degree of success over a repeated number of trials. (Turing says\nnothing about how many trials he would require. However, we can safely\nassume that, in order to get decent evidence that there is no more\nthan a 70% chance that a machine will be correctly identified as a\nmachine after five minutes of conversation, there will have to be a\nreasonably large number of trials.) If a computer program could do\nthis quite demanding thing, then it does seem plausible to claim that\nwe would have at least prima facie reason for thinking that\nwe are in the presence of intelligence. (Perhaps it is worth\nemphasizing again that there might be all kinds of intelligent\nthings\u2014including intelligent machines\u2014that would not pass\nthis test. It is conceivable, for example, that there might be\nmachines that, as a result of moral considerations, refused to lie or\nto engage in pretence. Since the human participant is supposed to do\neverything that he or she can to help the interrogator, the question\n\u201cAre you a machine?\u201d would quickly allow the interrogator\nto sort such (pathological?) truth-telling machines from humans.)\n\nAnother contentious aspect of Turing\u2019s paper (1950) concerns his\nrestriction of the discussion to the case of \u201cdigital\ncomputers.\u201d On the one hand, it seems clear that this\nrestriction is really only significant for the prediction that Turing\nmakes about how things will be in the year 2000, and not for the\ndetails of the test itself. (Indeed, it seems that if the test that\nTuring proposes is a good one, then it will be a good test for any\nkinds of entities, including, for example, animals, aliens, and analog\ncomputers. That is: if animals, aliens, analog computers, or any other\nkinds of things, pass the test that Turing proposes, then there will\nbe as much reason to think that these things exhibit intelligence as\nthere is reason to think that digital computers that pass the test\nexhibit intelligence.) On the other hand, it is actually a highly\ncontroversial question whether \u201cthinking machines\u201d would\nhave to be digital computers; and it is also a controversial question\nwhether Turing himself assumed that this would be the case. In\nparticular, it is worth noting that the seventh of the objections that\nTuring (1950) considers addresses the possibility of continuous state\nmachines, which Turing explicitly acknowledges to be different from\ndiscrete state machines. Turing appears to claim that, even if we are\ncontinuous state machines, a discrete state machine would be able to\nimitate us sufficiently well for the purposes of the Imitation Game.\nHowever, it seems doubtful that the considerations that he gives are\nsufficient to establish that, if there are continuous state machines\nthat pass the Turing Test, then it is possible to make discrete state\nmachines that pass the test as well. (Turing himself was keen to point\nout that some limits had to be set on the notion of\n\u201cmachine\u201d in order to make the question about\n\u201cthinking machines\u201d interesting:\n\nIt is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of engineering\ntechnique to be used in our machine. We also wish to allow the\npossibility that an engineer or team of engineers may construct a\nmachine which works, but whose manner of operation cannot be\nsatisfactorily described by its constructors because they have applied\na method which is largely experimental. Finally, we wish to exclude\nfrom the machines men born in the usual manner. It is difficult to\nframe the definitions so as to satisfy these three conditions. One\nmight for instance insist that the team of engineers should all be of\none sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably\npossible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin\n(say) of a man. To do so would be a feat of biological technique\ndeserving of the very highest praise, but we would not be inclined to\nregard it as a case of \u2018constructing a thinking machine\u2019.\n(435/6)\n\n\nBut, of course, as Turing himself recognized, there is a large class\nof possible \u201cmachines\u201d that are neither digital nor\nbiotechnological.) More generally, the crucial point seems to be that,\nwhile Turing recognized that the class of machines is potentially much\nlarger than the class of discrete state machines, he was himself\nvery confident that properly engineered discrete state\nmachines could succeed in the Imitation Game (and, moreover, at the\ntime that he was writing, there were certain discrete state\nmachines\u2014\u201celectronic computers\u201d\u2014that loomed\nvery large in the public imagination).\n",
