    "main_text": "Quantum Properties || Conjunction and Disjunction\n2.2 Conjunction and Disjunction\nThe conjunction \\(P\\land Q\\), or \\(P\\) AND \\(Q\\), of two classical\nproperties corresponds to the intersection \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\) of the sets\nthat represent them on the phase space, and the indicator for this set\nis the product \\(P(\\gamma)Q(\\gamma)\\) of the two indicator\nfunctions. What about the quantum case? In quantum logic \\(P\\land Q\\) is\nidentified with the intersection \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\) of the two Hilbert\nsubspaces, which is itself a subspace and thus a quantum property. The\nhistories interpretation identifies \\(P\\land Q\\) with the product \\(PQ\\)\nof the projectors \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) provided the two\nprojectors commute, that is, provided \\(PQ=QP\\). When and only\nwhen this condition is fulfilled is the product \\(PQ\\) itself a\nprojector, and it projects onto the subspace \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\), in\nagreement with quantum logic. However, if \\(PQ\\neq QP\\) the conjunction\n\\(P\\land Q\\) is undefined or meaningless in the sense\nthat the histories interpretation assigns it no meaning. In the same\nway the disjunction \\(P\\lor Q\\), the nonexclusive \\(P\\) OR \\(Q\\), is\nrepresented by the projector \\(P+Q-PQ\\) when \\(PQ=QP\\), but is otherwise\nundefined.\nThe refusal to define the conjunction or disjunction when \\(PQ\\neq\nQP\\) should be thought of as a syntactical rule, analogous to that in\nordinary logic that says an expression like \\(P\\land\\lor\\, Q\\) is\nmeaningless because it has not been formed according to the rules used\nto construct meaningful sentences. In this connection it is important\nto distinguish \u201cmeaningless\u201d from \u201cfalse\u201d. A\nproposition which is false is meaningful and its negation is true,\nwhereas the negation of a meaningless statement is equally\nmeaningless. Once the commutativity restriction for meaningful\ncombinations of quantum propositions or properties is in place the\nusual logical rules apply together with the intuition that goes along\nwith them. This will be further codified using the single framework\nrule defined in subsection 3.4\nbelow.\n",
