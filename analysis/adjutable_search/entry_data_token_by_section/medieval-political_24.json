    "main_text": "William of Ockham || Secular Power also Limited\n13.3 Secular Power also Limited\n\nBesides disagreeing with Marsilius over the status of Peter and the\nextent of the pope\u2019s power, Ockham rejected his thesis that a\ncommunity cannot be well governed unless all coercive power is\nconcentrated in one sovereign authority (Octo quaestiones\n3.3, in Letter: 309ff.) Ockham argues that, on the contrary,\nsuch concentration is dangerous and incompatible with freedom. Just as\nhe had argued that the extreme version of the doctrine of papal\nfullness of power would make Christians the pope\u2019s slaves,\ncontrary to the gospel liberty, so he argues that the corresponding\ndoctrine of fullness of power for the emperor would be incompatible\nwith the best form of government, in which subjects are free persons\nand not slaves. Accordingly, Ockham argues for limitations on the\npower of the secular ruler. He glosses the famous absolutist texts of\nthe Roman law (see above\n \u00a76\n and\n note 28).\n That the emperor is \u201creleased from the laws\u201d (legibus\nsolutus) is not true, because he is bound not only by natural and\ndivine law but also by the law of nations (a branch of human positive\nlaw), according to which some are not slaves but\n free.[72]\n \u201cWhat pleases the prince has the force of law\u201d, but only\nwhen it is something reasonable and just for the sake of the common\ngood and when this is manifestly expressed\n (3.2 Dialogus 2.26\u201328).\n",
