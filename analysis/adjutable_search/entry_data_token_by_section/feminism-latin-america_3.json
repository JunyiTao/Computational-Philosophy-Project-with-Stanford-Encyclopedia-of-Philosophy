Transitions from military regimes and\nprocesses of democratization as well as peace negotiations provide the\ncontext in which women\u2019s mobilization emerges across Latin\nAmerica. The plurality of political conditions gave way to the\ndevelopment of diverse feminist ideas. The feminism of this time, also\ncommonly referred to as neofeminism, was particularly attuned to the\nbody (Bartra 2001: 1). Grounded in the pre-1970 history of Latin\nAmerican feminism, neofeminism strove toward the validation of\nwomen\u2019s rights, but specifically centered on women\u2019s\nfreedom over their bodies. The neofeminist perspective translated into\nmobilizing on issues of abortion, motherhood, sexual autonomy, rape,\nand abuse (Bartra 2001: 1).\n\nContemporary Latin American feminism surged during politically somber\ntimes, especially under the presence of military regimes or nominal\ndemocracies that repressed civil liberties often in the name of\nnational security (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). Hence, as a\nsocial movement, Latin American feminism was born with an\nintrinsically oppositional and occasionally clandestine character\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). As international organizations\nattempted to influence national health and population policies and\ngovernments to control women\u2019s bodies, the foci of Latin\nAmerican feminisms grew more complex (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992:\n403).\n\nOne notable characteristic of feminism during this time is the\nrecognition of womanhood as a shared status. Women during these\ndecades found identity in their status of womanhood and their shared\ncondition that differentiated them from men (Gargallo 2004: 88). They\nrejected \u201cman\u201d as the standard model around which their\npolitical action organized. The push for social and political\ntransformation focused less on equality (e.g., the right to vote) and\nmore on a desire for liberty, denying notions of femininity as\nsubordinate to masculinist constructions of humanity (Gargallo 2004:\n111). Latin American feminism of the late 20th century\nencouraged encounters between women that recognized them as subjects,\nwith their own histories, and on their own terms (Gargallo 2004:\n88).\n1.4.1 The 1970s\n\nAmid military regimes, the 1970s were characterized by a mobilization\nof women that took motherhood to be a political category. In some\ncountries, women resisted state repression as mothers of those who had\ndisappeared at the hands of the state (Gargallo 2004: 113). The\nCoMadres (Comit\u00e9 de Madres) of El Salvador formed in 1977 to\ninvestigate the disappearance of missing relatives. They photographed\nthe bodies of people found in the streets of El Salvador in order to\naid in identification. In the same year, the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres\nde Plaza de Mayo in Argentina organized as mothers to search for their\ndisappeared children as a result of state terrorism enacted by the\nmilitary dictatorship that spanned the years of 1976\u20131983. In\nMexico, critical stances on motherhood were initiated by the\nneofeminist group Mujeres en Acci\u00f3n Solidaria (MAS), which\nprotested the sanctifying myth of motherhood on the eve of\nMother\u2019s Day at El Monumento a la Madre (a monument honoring\nmothers) in Mexico City. They resisted the myth that a woman\u2019s\nrole in society should be circumscribed to motherhood\n(Guti\u00e9rrez 2012: 42). The protest continued in the years that\nfollowed.\n\nThe push to disconnect motherhood from womanhood set the stage for a\nseparation between the reproductive capacities of women\u2019s bodies\nand their sexual health (Gargallo 2004: 114). Claims to the\ndecriminalization of abortion emerged under access to reproductive\nrights that sought to give women control over their own bodies. Thus,\nthe right to abort was defended on the grounds of a woman\u2019s\nright to individual autonomy (Gargallo 2004: 114). In 1976, El\nMovimiento Nacional de Mujeres, along with other autonomous feminist\ngroups, organized one of the first congresses on the decriminalization\nof abortion that maintained the interruption of pregnancy as a\nwoman\u2019s decision that should be made accessible through all\ninstitutions of public health (Gargallo 2004: 114). In the years that\nfollowed, feminists in Mexico used a variety of symbolic strategies in\ntheir fight for the legalization of abortion. They dressed in black to\npublicly mourn the women who had died as a result of clandestine\nabortions (Garagallo 2004: 115). Today, abortion remains tiered in\naccess throughout Latin America. Countries such as Chile, Nicaragua,\nDominican Republic, and El Salvador prohibit abortion entirely, even\nunder conditions where it would save a woman\u2019s life. In\ncountries like Mexico, Guatemala, Panam\u00e1, and Venezuela\nabortion is legal only under conditions where it saves the life of the\nwoman. However, in countries like Argentina, Costa Rica, and Ecuador\nabortion is legal to the extent that it preserves the physical health\nof the woman. In some countries, conditions of rape are understood as\npart of the preservation of physical health (e.g., Argentina), while\nin others, the extension is made to allow abortion to the extent that\nit preserves the mental health of the woman (e.g., Colombia). Cuba,\nUruguay, and Puerto Rico are places that have legalized abortion\nwithout any restrictions that would require some particular reason.\nAlthough the battle for access to abortion began during the 1970s, it\ncontinues to be a contested political issue especially in places where\naccess is entirely denied or restricted by other factors: physical\nhealth, mental health, or life preservation. Moreover, in places like\nPuerto Rico, the question of abortion is intricately bound up with\nhistories of forced sterilization, making the issue more politically\ncharged and complex.\n\nAs a time characterized by state repression, the 1970s were also a\ntime of awakening for many women who demanded social change (Bartra\n2001: 6). Latin American feminists not only challenged patriarchy by\ndefining themselves as distinct political subjects, but also\nchallenged male paradigms of domination expressed through the\nmilitaristic and counter-insurgent state. The reality of state\nrepression made Latin American feminisms distinct in their ability to\nunveil the patriarchal foundations of militarism and institutionalized\nviolence (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). The intimate\nrelationship between patriarchy and military state repression is best\nelucidated by the intersection between Chilean feminist activism and\nthe push for democratization in Julieta Kirkwood\u2019s famous\nphrase: \u201cDemocracia en el pa\u00eds, en la casa y en la\ncama\u201d, which translates to: \u201cDemocracy in the nation, in\nthe house, and in the bed\u201d (Kirkwood 1986: 14). Latin American\nfeminism of the 1970s was linked to an activism that believed\nauthoritarian regimes found their roots where patriarchal oppression\ntrickled into the \u201cprivate\u201d sphere. By the late 1970s,\nopposition movements emerged throughout Latin America, joined by women\nfrom all walks of life defying their historical exclusion from\npolitical life (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 398\u2013399).\n\nThe heterogeneity of contemporary Latin American feminism can be\ntraced to the diverse political conditions from which its activism\nemerged. Nevertheless, a theme can be found in the commitment to\nchange the social relations of production, including reproduction.\nThroughout the region, women collectively participated in movements to\nengender human rights by seeking better access to education,\nhealthcare, and urban services as well as resistance to military state\nrepression (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 401). Latin America\u2019s\neconomic dependence and political repression during these years set\nthe stage for a distinct militant feminist activism that would\ncontinue to spread into the decade of the 1980s.\n1.4.2 The 1980s\n\nThe 1980s were characterized by the expansion of feminist theory and\npractice. Feminists started focusing on specialized activities that\ndeepened their vision of politics, culture, and society. The number of\nfeminist magazines, films, and video collectives increased.\nFurthermore, the number of centers for rape victims and abused women,\nas well as feminist health collectives, lesbian groups, and other\nspecifically gendered projects grew during this time (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 404). As feminists increased their activities\nin feminist projects, they began creating more civil society\norganizations or NGO\u2019s (non-government organizations)\n(Mill\u00e1n 2014: 154).\n\nOne of the most important events to mark the 1980s was the first\nEncuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe held in\nBogot\u00e1, Colombia. The Encuentros (\u201cEncounters\u201d), as\nthey came to be called in short, served as regional critical forums\nfor debates about feminist politics and the movement\u2019s overall\nrelationship to social justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. The\nattendees of the First Encuentro came together on the heels of\ngeographic and political isolation with a desire to carve out a path\nfor autonomous politics. Over the years, the Encuentros extended the\nmap of feminist politics (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 405).\n\nThe First Encuentro convened in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, over the\ncourse of four days in July 1981; more than two hundred women from\nover fifty organizations attended. The region-wide gathering brought\ntogether many strands of feminism, creating a heterogeneous movement\nwith considerable tensions and conflicts. For instance, during the\nplanning stages of the meeting, heated discussions emerged between\nindependent/autonomous feminists, often identified as\naut\u00f3nomas or feministas, and militant\npolitical feminists affiliated with political parties (e.g.,\nsocialist), often referred to as militantes. Independent\nfeminists expressed concern over the possibility that feminists\naligned with political parties might try to impose sectarian agendas\ndiverting attention from issues central to feminist organizing (e.g.,\nreproductive rights) (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 407).\n\nThe most widely attended Encuentro of 1981, \u201cFeminism and\nPolitical Struggle\u201d, focused on the autonomy of the feminist\nmovement, double militancy (concurrent participation in a political\nparty and the feminist movement), and feminism and imperialism\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). The response to the session\nexemplified the diversity of ideas involved in the feminist struggle.\nAll of the participants agreed that women suffer a specific oppression\nby virtue of their womanhood, which is exacerbated by class. Their\nagreement translated into particular demands: equal pay, end of the\ndouble workday, and the right to safe abortion as well as the right to\nchoose motherhood (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). Furthermore,\nit was clear that the political parties of the time across the region\nwere not centered on these demands in their claims for social change.\nTwo notable positions were developed in response to the session. The\nfirst position maintained that neither capitalism nor socialism on\ntheir own could end women\u2019s oppression. Women\u2019s liberation\nneeded to be articulated outside the networks of party-affiliated\nactivism that would make demands for complete social transformation to\nalter oppressive relations. They held that severing the\nmilitante and the feminista was to misunderstand\nfeminist politics, which is a comprehensive political praxis. The\nfocus of feminist political activism needed to be in targeted feminist\norganizations, since the revolutionary Left tended to place men in the\ncenter (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 409). The second position held\nthat feminism on its own could not be revolutionary because of its\ninherent commitment to socialism. They thought feminism should be an\norganic outgrowth of socialist struggles that could not be separated\nfrom struggles against class oppression. Double militancy, on this\nview, was a practical difficulty, but one that could be overcome\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 409).\n\nThe 1981 Encuentro reflected the larger social and political\nconditions out of which Latin American feminisms were evolving. The\nconflict between the feministas and the militantes\nexemplified the divergences in Latin American feminisms during the\n1980s. However, it also reflected the genesis of Latin American\nfeminist ideas in women\u2019s political activism. So, although mired\nin conflict, the Encuentros signaled the intimate ties between ideas\nregarding gender struggle and the political conditions that give rise\nto those ideas.\n\nThe Second Encuentro, held in Lima, Per\u00fa in July 1983,\nthematically focused on patriarchy, a controversial topic\ngiven its association with imperialist American and European\nfeminisms. The Encuentro reflected a shift in feminist claims,\nidentifying that sexism was not just an outcome of capitalism, but\nrather shaped by a patriarchal sex/gender system that functioned\nautonomously (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 412). Moreover, the\nSecond Encuentro experienced a public response to the visibility of\nlesbian identity within Latin American feminisms, forcing many\nheterosexual women to confront their homophobia (Saporta Sternbach et\nal. 1992: 412). The meeting also pushed the topic of racism, which\nresurfaced in subsequent years both in the Encuentros and the larger\nlandscape of Latin American feminist ideas that launched staunch\ncritiques on the omission of race and racism from dominant feminist\nconversations.\n\nThe growth of the Encuentros testified to the growth of feminisms\nthroughout the region. The Fourth Encuentro held in Taxco, Mexico\n(1987) brought together 1,500 women. As the end of the decade was\nnearing, the Fourth Encuentro reflected increased complexity in Latin\nAmerican feminist politics, which was made palpable by the recurrence\nof the question: \u201cWho is a feminist?\u201d (Saporta Sternbach\net al. 1992: 421). The discussion reflected divergences in what\nconstituted feminist politics and whether general community organizing\nwas sufficient to characterize feminist organizing, particularly where\ncommunity groups were controlled by the church or local political\nparties (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). Nevertheless, a key\npoint remains that when the Encuentros began in 1981, feminism was\nstill a \u201cdirty word\u201d, but by 1987, feminism had gained\nlegitimacy and was validated in Leftist political circles, notably in\nthe Nicaraguan revolution (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). The\nEncuentros continued to demonstrate the diverse growth of Latin\nAmerican feminisms as a thriving and expansive map of ideas grounded\nin different strands of political activism. Although the Encuentros\ncontinue to the present day, the Encuentros of the 1980s were\nsignificant developments which reflected an evolving social movement\nwith tense but important relationships among revolutionary struggles,\nfeminist goals, and claims for social justice.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic peaked, sexual\npolitics became increasingly conservative. Sex, once viewed as a\npolitical act that could blur the private/public divide and subvert\ntraditional gender roles, became fraught with difficulty. Young\nfeminists came of age at a time when sexual education shifted toward\nnarratives of the risks of sex and not its disruptive political\npotential (Gargallo 2004: 123\u2013124). Furthermore, the closing of\nthe decade saw the continued linking between feminism and NGOs that\nwould be characteristic of the institutionalization of feminism in the\n1990s. For some, institutionalization entailed de-radicalization of\nfeminist politics in Latin America and the Caribbean (Gargallo 2004:\n125).\n1.4.3 The 1990s\n\nLatin American feminisms during the 1990s are characterized by a focus\non gender equality and non-discrimination within the confines of\ninstitutions governed by neoliberal policies (Coba & Herrera 2013:\n18). As a result, they are referred to as liberal feminisms not\ngrounded in resistance, but rather in their adaptation to a neoliberal\ninfrastructure that was ushered in throughout the region.\nNeoliberalism had a distinct impact on women\u2019s activism and the\ndevelopment of feminist ideas. Women were one of the most affected\ngroups with the shifts in economic policies, and the phrase\n\u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d accurately captured the\ndetrimental impact on women\u2019s lives. Many women joined the\nmenial labor force (e.g., maquilas, agricultural labor)\nwithout any labor rights or access to fair wages (Gargallo 2004:\n117).\n\nAt the same time, feminist activists started coupling their efforts\nwith organizations that targeted policy change in favor of women and\noperated with a distinct language about violence, health, and human\nrights in tune with liberal politics (Gargallo 2004: 125). The concept\nof the autonomous individual reigned as the explanatory framework for\ndevelopment. Under the umbrella of individuality, people were\nresponsible for their own survival and development which were\ndependent on their initiative in a market economy (Coba & Herrera\n2013: 18). In this context, the activist politics that had once\ncharacterized feminist organizing shifted to less radicalized\norganizational institutions. A substantial portion of the feminist\nmovement that transitioned to institutions did so without critiquing\neconomic policies and neoliberalism (Bastian Duarte 2012: 157).\nInstitutionalized feminists started working alongside governments and\nagencies, which prioritized change in public policy but did not seek\nto investigate the roots of inequality that justified the need for\npolicy change. Moreover, conditions emerged where NGO\u2019s were\nable to offer specialized resources for women. In doing so, they\npromoted far-reaching gender discourse that was standardized with the\nuniversalizing criteria of the United Nations. With their hands tied\nby donors, these organizations were not necessarily mindful of the\npriorities of local organizations or their populations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 157). As a result, the infrastructure of institutionalization\nexacerbated existing power imbalances across ethnic and class\nlines.\n\nAmong the institutions participating in the institutionalization of\nfeminisms was the academy. From the late 1980s well into the 1990s,\nwomen\u2019s studies programs started organizing throughout\nuniversities. Moreover, the study of feminist philosophy more broadly\nstarted finding its way into curricula as the activism of earlier\ndecades pressured universities to support women\u2019s and gender\nstudies (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 400). The decade marked\nthe professionalization of feminism. Feminism, which had once been an\norienting force of activism, became employable and profitable (Bartra\n2001: 11). However, this is not to discredit the tremendous effort\nthat the development of university programs required. As university\nprograms became institutional fixtures, they also served as\ncounter-hegemonic spaces where resistance could be facilitated.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the initiation of journals and formal publications.\nIn 1990, Debate Feminista was launched by Marta Lamas. It\nremains one of the most impactful journal publications on intellectual\nfeminisms. In 1991, La Correa Feminista was created to bring\ntogether the thoughts of autonomous and radical feminists. It ran\nuntil 1998 when the editors self-assessed the journal\u2019s goals\nand decided to launch Creatividad Feminista, an online\npublication which ran until 2008, when its daughter site,\nMamaMetal, was created. Finally, La Doble Jornada\nsprang as a feminist supplement to La Jornada, Mexico\u2019s\nleading Leftist newspaper, and ran from 1986\u20131998 (Mill\u00e1n\n2014: 156).\n\nDuring this time, Latin American feminisms began to privilege the use\nof the category gender or the gender perspective\nover patriarchy as the conceptual framework from which to\ntalk about the situation of women. The shift to using language of\ngender is largely owed to the importation of North American\nfeminist ideas. In the Latin American context, Gayle Rubin\u2019s\nwork received substantial attention as evidenced by numerous\ntranslations as well as by extensive commentary on its complex\nunderstanding of the sex/gender system (Gargallo 2004: 21). However,\nit is important to note that the term was already being deployed by\nscholars and carried with it a variety of connotations (Schutte 1998b:\n88).\n\nGender was translated to Spanish as\n\u201cg\u00e9nero\u201d, which to many was a poor translation.\nG\u00e9nero, which translates to English as\n\u201cspecies\u201d or \u201ckind\u201d, traveled to the Latin\nAmerican context via academic publishing and sparked debate on its\naptness to map onto the feminist conditions of the region. The gender\nperspective, which employs the paradigm of radical individualism\ncharacteristic of the decade, comes to stand alongside the concept of\nempowerment as one that can specifically target women\u2019s needs.\nThe language of gender and empowerment was used by the United Nations\nas part of their universalizing goals for women during the 1995 World\nConference on Women held in Beijing, a moment which marked mounted\ntensions around the de-politicization of Latin American feminisms\n(Bastian Duarte 2012: 157).\n\nThe use of the themes of gender and empowerment was further deployed\nby newly democratized states. Feminist activists found themselves in a\ndifferent relationship to the state as it adopted the language of\ngender. Once a vehicle of repression, especially under\nmilitary rule, Latin American feminists now had to contend with a\ndrastically different engagement with the role of the state, one that\nhad co-opted the very terms of a movement that was initiated in\nopposition to its repression. Newly formed liberal democracies\nunderstood women as potential markets for modernizing and development,\nthus deploying the language of gender and empowerment (Alvarez 1998:\n271). However, the way in which the state managed poverty as part of\nits modernizing mission was mired in individualism with little focus\non communities.\n\nPolitical and economic transitions influenced the development of\nfeminist ideas. Activism became institutionalized and the feminist\nmovement grew in various directions. As the 90s came to a close, what\nstarted out as a spontaneous social movement with radical ideas about\npatriarchy, militarism, and democratization found its way into the\nhalls of institutions and organizations that stifled feminist\nactivism. The institutionalization of feminism was so profound that\nits political promise seemed lost. However, as the opening of the\n21st century demonstrates, this was not the case.\nInstitutionalization was not without critique, and the early 2000s\nmarked the emergence of new voices that took liberal dominant\nfeminisms to task by focusing on anti-neoliberal and decolonial\ncritique which began to call out the hegemonic practices of Latin\nAmerican feminisms.\n",
