    "main_text": "\u201cHumans\u201d, Slogans and the Traditional Package || Unpacking the Traditional Package\n1.2 Unpacking the Traditional Package\n\nWe can usefully distinguish four types of claim that have been\ntraditionally made using the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d. As\na result of a particular feature of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, to\nwhich we will come in a moment, these four claims are associated with\nfive different uses of the expression. Uses of the first type seem to\nhave their origin in Plato; uses of the second, third and fourth type\nare Aristotelian; and, although uses of the fifth type have\nhistorically been associated with Aristotle, this association seems to\nderive from a misreading in the context of the religiously motivated\nMediaeval reception of his philosophy.\n\nA first, thin, contrastive use of the expression \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is provided by the application of a thin, generic\nconcept of nature to humans. In this minimal variant, nature is\nunderstood in purely contrastive or negative terms. Phusis is\ncontrasted in Plato and Aristotle with techn\u0113, where the\nlatter is the product of intention and a corresponding intervention of\nagency. If the entire cosmos is taken to be the product of divine\nagency, then, as Plato argued (Nadaf 2005: 1ff.), conceptualisations\nof the cosmos as natural in this sense are mistaken. Absent divine\nagency, the types of agents whose intentions are relevant for the\nstatus of anything as natural are human agents. Applied to humans,\nthen, this concept of nature picks out human features that are not the\nresults of human intentional action. Thus understood, human nature is\nthe set of human features or processes that remain after subtraction\nof those picked out by concepts of the non-natural, concepts such as\n\u201cculture\u201d, \u201cnurture\u201d, or\n\u201csocialisation\u201d.\n\nA second component in the package supplies the thin concept\nwith substantial content that confers on it explanatory power.\nAccording to Aristotle, natural entities are those that contain in\nthemselves the principle of their own production or development, in\nthe way that acorns contain a blueprint for their own realisation as\noak trees (Physics 192b; Metaphysics 1014b). The\n\u201cnature\u201d of natural entities thus conceptualised is a\nsubset of the features that make up their nature in the first sense.\nThe human specification of this explanatory concept of nature aims to\npick out human features that similarly function as blueprints for\nsomething like a fully realised form. According to Aristotle, for all\nanimals that blueprint is \u201cthe soul\u201d, that is, the\nintegrated functional capacities that characterise the fully developed\nentity. The blueprint is realised when matter, i.e., the body, has\nattained the level of organisation required to instantiate the\nanimal\u2019s living functions (Charles 2000: 320ff.; Lennox 2009:\n356).\n\nA terminological complication is introduced here by the fact that the\nfully developed form of an entity is itself also frequently designated\nas its \u201cnature\u201d (Aristotle, Physics 193b;\nPolitics 1252b). In Aristotle\u2019s teleological\nmetaphysics, this is the entity\u2019s end, \u201cthat for the sake\nof which a thing is\u201d (Metaphysics 1050a; Charles 2000:\n259). Thus, a human\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d, like that of any\nother being, may be either the features in virtue of which it is\ndisposed to develop to a certain mature form or, thirdly, the\nform to which it is disposed to develop.\n\nImportantly, the particularly prominent focus on the idea of a fully\ndeveloped form in Aristotle\u2019s discussions of humans derives from\nits dual role. It is not only the form to the realisation of which\nhuman neonates are disposed; it is also the form that mature members\nof the species ought to realise (Politics 1253a).\nThis normative specification is the fourth component of the\ntraditional package. The second, third and fourth uses of\n\u201cnature\u201d are all in the original package firmly anchored\nin a teleological metaphysics. One question for systematic claims\nabout human nature is whether any of these components remain plausible\nif we reject a teleology firmly anchored in theology (Sedley 2010:\n5ff.).\n\nA fifth and last component of the package that has\ntraditionally been taken to have been handed down from antiquity is\nclassificatory. Here, the property or set of properties named by the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d is that property or property set\nin virtue of the possession of which particular organisms belong to a\nparticular biological taxon: what we now identify as the species taxon\nHomo sapiens. This is human nature typologically\nunderstood.\n\nThis, then, is the traditional package:\n\n\nComponent\nVariant of human nature \n\nTP1\ncontrastive \n\nTP2\nblueprint explanatory \n\nTP3\nexplanatorily\u00a0teleological \n\nTP4\nnormatively\u00a0teleological \n\nTP5\nclassificatory or taxonomic \n\n",
