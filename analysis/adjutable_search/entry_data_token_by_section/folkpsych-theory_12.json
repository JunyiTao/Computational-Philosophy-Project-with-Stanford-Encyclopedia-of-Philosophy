    "main_text": "Philosophical Challenges to Theory Theory || Pluralism\n4.5 The Narrative Practice Hypothesis\n\nThe Narrative Practice Hypothesis, or NPH, offers a thoroughgoing\nchallenge to TT. In its original formulation, it incorporates versions\nof the challenges to TT issued by phenomenological critics and FP\npluralists. Inspired by Bruner (1990), the NPH holds that folk\npsychology is a kind of narrative practice and hypothesizes that our\nFP competence is fostered by engaging in socially supported\nstory-telling activities (Hutto 2004, 2007, 2008).\n\nThe NPH maintains that engaging in specific kinds of narrative\npractices is the normal route by which human beings come to\nunderstand, explain and make sense of actions done for reasons in FP\nterms. It is through such narrative practices that we normally become\nacquainted with mental attitudes or predicates (e.g., belief, desire,\nhope, fear) and learn of the complex ways such attitudes can\ninter-relate. The NPH is consistent with the fact that FP practice is\nquite variable. We call on many kinds of mental states, other than\nbeliefs and desires\u2014such as hopes, fears, and other more basic\nkinds of perceptions, emotions\u2014as well as character traits and\nnon-psychological attributes when making sense of why someone may have\nacted. The NPH assumes that fuller and more complete explanations of\naction will give details of the person\u2019s character, situation,\nand history\u2014in short, more of the person\u2019s\n\u201cstory\u201d.\n\nThe primary function of FP, according to the NPH, is the hermeneutic\nunderstanding and justification of action through normalizing\nexplanations. It assumes that such explanations cannot be understood\nas backward-looking retrodictions that mirror forward-looking\npredictions. Following Andrews (2003), the NPH thus challenges the\nassumption that prediction and explanation are symmetrical. In\nagreement with the mindshaping hypothesis, the NPH assumes that any\ntheorizing we do about minds, by calling on generalizations, is\nperipheral and parasitic on the more primary narratively based ways of\nunderstanding reasons for action. The NPH assumes theorizing only\noccurs in third-personal contexts and that core FP understanding upon\nwhich FP predictions and explanations are based need not be grounded\nin any kind of ToM.\n\nThe NPH acknowledges that our FP competence is structured. Yet it\nmaintains that FP structure derives from the patterns embedded in the\nambient narratives found in our socio-cultural environments and not,\nsay, from the pattern of a set of internalized rules stored in\nthe brains of individuals. The NPH advances the view that we acquire\nour structured FP competence through dealing with special kinds of\nnarratives\u2014FP narratives\u2014when appropriately supported by\ncaregivers. A range of empirical findings lend apparent support to the\nNPH (see Astington 1990, 1996; Astington & Jenkins 1999; Richner\n& Nicolopoulou 2001; Nelson 2003, 2007).\n\nFP narratives are a special sub-set of narratives\u2014those that\nmake mention of and show how mental states figure in the lives,\nhistory, and larger projects of their owners. Like all narratives, FP\nnarratives depict a particular series of events in the lives of\ncertain protagonists. Yet FP narratives differ from other kinds of\nnarratives in that they explicitly showcase the various psychological\nstates and attitudes. The NPH predicts that if cultures diverge\nsignificantly in their narrative practices, then we should expect to\nfind different patterns, tendencies, and proficiencies in the use of\nFP across those cultures (Hutto 2008).\n\nUltimately, the NPH holds that FP competence\u2014our facility with\nFP forms and norms\u2014is grounded in non-representational\ncapacities that have been structured by social interactions and\nnarratives. This proposal rejects the intellectualist individualism\nthat is standardly assumed in mainstream cognitive science and\nproposes instead that FP competence is a kind of enculturated know-how\n(McGeer forthcoming). Some, however, for example, Overgaard and\nMichael (2015), object that to be workable as an account of FP\ncompetence the NPH has no choice but to assume that a ToM, and not\njust enculturated practical know-how, is acquired via engaging in the\nrelevant narrative practices.\n",
