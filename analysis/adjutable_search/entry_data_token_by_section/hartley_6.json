    "main_text": "Language as Algebra\n7. Language as Algebra\n\nGiven that meaning is a property of complete expressions, Hartley is\nquick to point out that individual words often lack definite, shared\nmeanings. Such indefiniteness is, in Hartley\u2019s view, hardly a\ndefect, but rather a valuable feature of language. Hartley writes that\nlanguage is \u201cone species of algebra,\u201d and algebra\n\u201cnothing more than the language \u2026 peculiarly fitted to\nexplain quantity of all kinds\u201d (OM 1, 80).\n\nThe algebraic quality of language is especially important in\nscientific practice. Like x and y in algebra,\nscientific terms, such as Hartley\u2019s \u201cvibrations\u201d or\ncontemporary physicists\u2019 \u201cparticles,\u201d stand for\nunknowns, for which vibrating strings or grains of sand provide only\nloose and misleading analogies. Their presence is necessary for the\npractice of scientific discovery. Scientists employ\n\u201calgebraic\u201d terms in order to discern correlations and\npatterns that might otherwise remain unobserved: \u201cBringing an\nunknown quantity into a relation answers, in philosophy, to the art of\ngiving names, expressing nothing definite \u2026 and then inserting\nthese names \u2026 in all the enunciations of the phenomena, to see\nwhether, from a comparison of these terms with each other, something\ndefinite in manner, degree, or mutual relation might result\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 87).\n\nIn such scientific practice, the more algebraic\u2014i.e., free from\nassociation with sense \u201cimpressions\u201d\u2014words are the\nbetter. (Thus \u201cquark\u201d is an inspired choice.) Hume\u2019s\nadvice, to use only terms referring to clear\n\u201cimpressions,\u201d if followed, would bring the practice of a\nscience to a halt.\n\nHowever, to turn this around, the utility of words for unknowns\ndepends upon their proper use within ongoing practices. For examples\nof how to conduct scientific inquiry, Hartley turns to mathematical\nmethods, and he includes an extensive discussion of these in\nproposition 87 of volume 1 of the Observations, which is\ntitled: \u201cTo deduce Rules for the Ascertainment of Truth, and\nAdvancement of Knowledge, from the Mathematical Methods of considering\nQuantity.\u201d\n\nOne deduction involves the comparison of scientific investigation to\nthe use of the rule of the false position in arithmetic: \u201cHere a\nfirst position is obtained, which, though not accurate, approaches,\nhowever, to the truth. From this, applied to the equations, a second\nposition is deduced, which approaches nearer to the truth than the\nfirst; from the second a third, etc.\u201d Hartley adds that\n\u201cthis is indeed the way, in which advances in science are\ncarried on; and scientific persons are aware, that it is and must be\nso\u201d (OM 1, prop. 87).\n\n\u201cI frame no hypotheses.\u201d Thus had Newton famously written\nin the Principia. Hartley responds directly: \u201cIt is in\nvain,\u201d he writes, \u201cto bid an inquirer form no\nhypothesis\u201d (OM 1, prop. 87). Remember that Hartley was\na practicing physician; on the basis of ambiguous symptoms and\nfallible medical knowledge, he was every day \u201cframing\nhypotheses,\u201d making diagnoses. The question, for Hartley,\nconcerns the degree of confidence we may place in our hypotheses. How\ndo we measure how far our \u201cfirst position\u201d is from the\ntruth, when we don\u2019t know what the truth is? And how do we\nmeasure the degree to which the degree of error in our second and\nthird positions has diminished?\n\nIn this regard, what is most interesting in proposition 87 is\nHartley\u2019s discussion of probability. Hartley appears to have\nbeen one of a small circle of mathematicians who read, and understood,\npapers making fundamental contributions to the theory of probability\nby Abraham De Moivre (1667\u20131754) and Thomas Bayes\n(1702\u201361). De Moivre developed a theorem that allows for the\ndetermination of the degree of convergence between the frequency of\nobserved events and the underlying probability ratio, for any finite\nnumber of events. More important is \u201cthe solution to the inverse\nproblem,\u201d which Hartley says \u201can ingenious friend\u201d\ncommunicated to him. This would be Bayes\u2019s\ntheorem\u2014customarily attributed to Thomas Bayes\u2014which deals\nwith determining the probability with which probability ratios can be\ninferred from observed outcomes, and which provides (a still\ncontroversial) foundation for statistical inference. In his discussion\nof probability theory, and other mathematical topics, Hartley is\nprimarily interested in methods for moving from observation to\nexplanation, of assessing the likeliness\u2014i.e,\nbelievability\u2014of hypotheses.\n\nHartley, like Hume, thought that belief was largely a matter of\nsentiment. \u201cRational assent\u201d is a matter of the strength\nof the association between a sentence (or even some of the words in\nit!) and the word \u201ctrue\u201d (OM 1, prop. 86)\n\u201cPractical assent,\u201d a person\u2019s willingness to act,\ndepends on the vividness the proposition\u2014and such can even make\n\u201can interesting event, supposed doubtful, or even fictitious,\n\u2026 appear like a real one,\u201d thereby pulling rational\nassent after it. (Hartley notes, dryly, \u201cthe foundation of\nassent is still the same. I here describe the fact only.\u201d) But\nHartley was not content to stop here, an exponent of an urbane\nskepticism. Belief and assent are matters of feeling, of sentiment,\nyes\u2014but there are mathematical ways of thinking about the\nprobabilities of belief. And people who think mathematically make\nbetter physicians and scientists. (How many trials of an unproven\ntreatment for bladder stones does one have to run, to reach a\nthreshold degree of belief in the results?) In this regard, it is fair\nto say that Hartley was one of the first Bayesians.\n\nOne other consequence of Hartley\u2019s practice-oriented,\n\u201calgebraic\u201d approach to language concerns the validity of\nalternate languages. In the \u201cpopular\u201d language we use\nevery day, we talk of our choices, intentions, and resolutions, but in\nthe \u201cphilosophical\u201d language of the Observations,\nHartley proposed we think in terms of \u201cphilosophical\nnecessity\u201d\u2014in which every \u201cvoluntary\u201d action\nis \u201cexcited by an associated circumstance\u201d (OM 1,\n70). Some people had, and have, no use for such talk: it denies the\nfreedom (and indeed, the existence) of the will. Hartley argues that\nthe use of two incommensurable languages, \u201cpopular\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d is not a problem, provided that we use\nthem separately and consistently: \u201cinsuperable difficulties will\narise\u201d only \u201cif we mix these languages\u201d (OM 2, prop.\n15). Both languages work, in their own contexts of practice.\n\nHartley had a warrant for this affirmative approach to languages in\nhis scientific and mathematical training: Newton wrote the\nPrincipia in the language of geometry, but the\n\u201cmathematical principles of natural philosophy\u201d could be\nequally (and better?) expressed in the \u201calgebraic\u201d\nlanguage of the calculus\u2014for which there were rival notations.\nSimilarly, Hartley championed a new \u201cnotation\u201d for the\nEnglish language\u2014his friend John Byrom\u2019s shorthand, which\nhe saw as a reform that would make our written language more closely\napproximate a \u201cphilosophical\u201d one. When he began work on\nthe Observations, he conceived of the project as\ndemonstrating that language about \u201cself-interest,\u201d the\n\u201ccommon good,\u201d and the \u201cwill of God\u201d were\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing. The project was thus as much\nmoral and religious as it was scientific.\n",
