    "main_text": "Quaker thought and practice || Anti-clericalism and anti-authoritarianism\n2.2 Anti-clericalism and anti-authoritarianism\n\n\nFell\u2019s anti-clericalism (her opposition to the professional\nclergy) is typical of Quaker texts of the period. In her view, the\nlight is the only teacher or spiritual guide that anyone requires for\nsalvation. The divine law is not written in paper and ink but rather\nwith the spirit of the living God. Fell says that \u201cThough ye may\nget all the words of the whole Scripture in your brains and\ncomprehension, so long as ye deny the light, and turn your minds from\nthe light, and seek to know these things without you, ye shall never\nknow them\u201d (Fell 1656b, 3). The light of Christ makes everyone\ncapable of interpreting scripture for themselves, without the need for\nan education in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin. This claim is made most\nforcefully in A Touch-Stone: or, A Perfect Tryal by the\nScriptures, in which Fell says that preachers of the light need\nnot be \u201cLearned Men, such as have been at Oxford or\nCambridge\u201d (Fell 1667b, 18). The apostles, after all,\ndid not have degrees from prestigious universities, yet no one doubts\nthat they taught the word of God.\n\n\nOn these grounds, Fell rails against those who have \u201cset up\nSchooles of Learning, as they call them; and educated youth up in that\ndarkness, and kept them studying and divining in their brains, till\nmany have studied themselves out of their Wits\u201d (Fell 1667b,\n38\u201339). She encourages suspicion toward human religious authority and\nurges readers to question their ministers. \u201cTry your\nTeachers,\u201d she says, and do not \u201cbow to mens wills and\nworships contrary to the command of Christ Jesus\u201d (Fell\n1655, 1; 1660b, 3). If ministers are not in the light, then they do not\nspeak the word of God. Hence, no matter how well-educated or elevated\nin rank our ministers might be, we must not take their word on trust.\n\u201cFear ye not the reproaches of men,\u201d she says,\n\u201cneither be ye afraid of their revilings\u201d (Fell 1668, 6).\nOn the whole, it is always better for the individual to offend other\nhuman beings rather than God himself.\n\n\nFell maintains that most university-educated interpreters of\nscripture invariably lead others away from God to their own inventions\nand imaginations. She says that\n\n\n\nThe first thing that I except against in matter and form of their\nWorship: Viz. All sorts of Preachers and Teachers that are out\nof Christ and his Apostles Spirit, Doctrine and Rule, is the taking a\npart or portion of Scripture for a Text, and adding to thereto their\nown Inventions, which they study out of their own brain, and also\nbringing other Authors, who have done the like, many of them not\nChristians but Heathens. (Fell 1667b, 21)\n\n\n\nThis anti-learning bent distances Fell from later religious\nfeminists, such as Mary Astell, who called for the higher education of\nwomen in her Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1694). For\nAstell, women can attain wisdom and virtue only if they are taught to\nimprove their natural reasoning skills through the study of religion\nand philosophy. In her plea for a female academy, she cites the works\nof Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole, and Henry\nMore, as exemplary philosophical-theological texts. For Fell, however,\nreligious worship is about the individual directing herself to the\nlight and keeping to it; it does not consist in a dependence or\nreliance upon others\u2019 words and meanings. Such worship can be\nperformed by anyone, anywhere, at any time.\n",
