    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Moral Facts\n1.7 Moral Facts\nG.E. Moore\u2019s well-known \u201copen question\u201d argument\nis designed to show that moral facts cannot possibly be identical to\nnatural facts. Suppose that the natural properties of some situation\nare completely specified. It will always remain an open question,\nargued Moore, whether that situation is morally good or bad (Moore\n1903).\nMoore took this argument to show that moral facts constitute a\ndistinct species of non-natural fact. However, any such non-naturalist\nview of morality faces immediate difficulties, deriving ultimately\nfrom the kind of causal closure thesis discussed above. If all\nphysical effects are due to a limited range of physically-grounded\nnatural causes, and if moral facts lie outside this range, then it\nfollow that moral facts can never make any difference to what happens\nin the physical world (Harman 1986). At first sight this may seem\ntolerable (perhaps moral facts indeed don\u2019t have any physical\neffects). But it has awkward epistemological consequences. For beings\nlike us, knowledge of the spatiotemporal world is mediated by physical\nprocesses involving our sense organs and cognitive systems. If moral\nfacts cannot influence the physical world, then it is hard to see how\nwe can have any knowledge of them.\nThe traditional non-naturalist answer to this problem is to posit a\nnon-natural faculty of \u201cmoral intuition\u201d that gives us\nsome kind of direct access to the moral realm (as explained in Ridge\n2014: Section 3). However, causal closure once more makes it\ndifficult to make good sense of this suggestion. Presumably at some\npoint the posited intuitive faculty will need to make a causal\ndifference in the physical world (by affecting what people say and\ndo, for example). And at this point the causal closure argument will\nbite once more, to show that a non-natural intuitive faculty would implausibly imply that some of our actions are strongly overdetermined by two metaphysically independent antecedents.\nMoral non-naturalism has had something of a revival in recent years, with defenders including Russ Shaffer-Landau (2003), Ralph Wedgwood (2007), Derek Parfit (2011) and David Enoch (2011). Still, the challenge of accounting for our access to non-natural moral facts remains, and it is debatable whether any of these writers has found a satisfactory alternative to a causally problematic faculty of intuition. Perhaps the most developed suggestion is Enoch\u2019s (2011) appeal to the indispensability of non-natural moral facts to moral reasoning, a line of argument that is analogous to Hilary Putnam\u2019s case for non-natural mathematical objects, to be discussed in the next section below. But Enoch\u2019s appeal arguably faces many of the same general objections as Putnam\u2019s argument, as well as objections specific to the moral realm (see Leng 2016).\nIn light of the difficulties facing moral non-naturalism, most\ncontemporary moral philosophers opt instead for some species of\nnaturalist view. We can divide the naturalist options here into two\nbroad categories: irrealist and realist. Irrealist moral naturalists\naim to account for moral discourse by offering naturalist accounts of\nthe social and linguistic and practices that govern it, but without\nsupposing that moral utterances report on moral facts with a\nsubstantial independent existence (Joyce 2015). By contrast,\nnaturalist moral realists agree with moral non-naturalists that\nsubstantial moral facts exist, but seek to locate them in the natural\nrealm rather than in some sui generis non-natural realm\n(Lenman 2014).\nBoth these broad categories have further sub-divisions. Among the\nirrealists, we can distinguish explicitly non-cognitivist views like\nemotivism and prescriptivism which deny that moral judgements express\nbeliefs (Hare 1952, Blackburn 1993, Gibbard 2003) from cognitivist\nviews that accept that moral judgements do express beliefs but deny a\nsubstantial reality to the putative facts to which they answer; and\namong the latter cognitivist views we can distinguish error-theoretic\nfictionalist options which view moral judgements as simply false\n(Mackie 1977, Kalderon 2005) from projectivist options which hold that\nmoral discourse is sufficiently disciplined for its judgements to\nqualify for a species of truth even though they do not report on\nindependently existing causally significant facts (Wright 1992, Price\n2011). \nNaturalist moral realism also comes in different varieties. In\nrecent debates two versions have figured prominently; \u201cCornell\nrealism\u201d, which includes moral facts among the causally\nsignificant facts but resists their type-reducibility to non-moral\nfacts (Sturgeon 1985, Boyd 1988), and \u201cmoral\nfunctionalism\u201d which is happy to equate moral facts with\nstraightforwardly descriptive facts (Jackson 1998). \nAny kind of moral naturalist realist needs to reject Moore\u2019s\nopen question argument. There are two alternatives here. One is to\ninsist that Moore\u2019s posited openness is relatively superficial,\nand that there is no principled barrier to inferring moral facts a\npriori from the non-moral natural facts, even if such inferences\nwill sometimes require a significant amount of information and reflection. The\nother is to argue that the constitution of moral facts by non-moral\nnatural facts is an a posteriori matter, akin to the relation\nbetween water and H2O, and that therefore Moore\u2019s\nopenness only points to a conceptual gap, not a metaphysical one\n(Ridge 2014: Section 2).\nThis sub-section has focused on morality. But there are other\ntopics which arguably involve matters of value, such as aesthetics, the normativity of theoretical and practical reason, and so on. The constraints placed\non theories of moral facts by naturalist considerations will\napply, mutatis mutandis, in these areas too, militating\nagainst theories that posit non-natural value-bearing facts and in\nfavour of naturalist alternatives, of either a realist or irrealist\nstripe.\n",
