    "main_text": "Method in Science\n2. Method in Science\n\nLike many other English thinkers, Kilvington was a leader in three\nmain disciplines: terminist logic, mathematical physics, and the new,\n\u201cmathematical\u201d theology. Methods and procedures developed\nin the first two disciplines were used in the third. The application\nof the terminist logic and the refutation of the Aristotelian\nprohibition against metabasis resulted in Kilvington\u2019s\nbroad use of logic and mathematics in all branches of inquiry to gain\ncertain knowledge. Four types of measurements were involved in his\nresearch. The predominant form of measurement by limits, i.e., by the\nbeginning and ending of successive or permanent things\n(incipit/desinit), by the first and last instants of the\nbeginning and ending of continuous processes (de primo et ultimo\ninstanti), and by the intrinsic and extrinsic limits of\ncapacities of passive and active potencies (de maximo et\nminimo), does not appear to be straightforwardly mathematical,\nthough it raises mathematical considerations insofar as it prescribes\nmeasure for natural processes, such as changing the elements, heating,\nchanging the speed of motion, acquiring knowledge, getting better or\nforming the habit to perform meritorious deeds. The second type of\nmeasurement, by latitude of forms, describes processes in which\naccidental forms are intensified or diminished in terms of the\ndistribution of natural qualities such as heat or whiteness or moral\nqualities such as love, grace, sin, will, or desire. In his\nmeasurement of the intension and remission of forms, Kilvington is\ninterested in determining how the highest degree of a quality can be\nintroduced into a subject already possessing the same quality to a\ncertain degree by undergoing an alteration, and consequently in\nestablishing the possibility of a most intense or diminished degree\nof, e.g., heat and cold, or virtue and vice. The third type of\nmeasurement, the strictly mathematical, employs a new calculus of\ncompounding proportions to measure speed in local motion or speed in\nthe distribution of love. Finally, the fourth type of measurement\ndescribes a \u2018rule\u2019 permitting the comparison of\ninfinities, treated as infinite sets containing infinite subsets, and\ndetermining which of them is equal, lesser, or greater.\n\nKilvington\u2019s concept of infinity is one of his greatest\nachievements. He takes for granted Ockham\u2019s definition of a\ncontinuum, according to which each continuum is a being that contains\nan actually infinite number of smaller and smaller proportional parts.\nWhen we are given any continuum, we are also given its halves, the\nhalves of these halves and, consequently, Ockham claims, an infinite\nnumber of its parts. The actual infinity is not understood here as an\nactually infinite continuum \u201cthat is so great that there cannot\nbe any greater one\u201d. Thus, it is impossible for a process of\ninfinite division to be accomplished, for if it were accomplished, it\nwould no longer be infinite, but finite. For Ockham, an actually\ninfinite continuum is a set of actually existing parts which could be\nenumerated without end. Kilvington supports Ockham\u2019s view in all\nhis works, starting from Sophismata up to the commentary on\nthe Sentences. Ockham, however, never gives any mathematical\nproof for this statement and limits himself to exploring Duns\nScotus\u2019s geometrical arguments against indivisibility.\nKilvington puts more effort into demonstrating that infinite\nproportional parts actually exist in a continuum (S\n42[43]:\u00a0112\u201315; Kretzmann 1990b: 307; see also Jung &\nPodko\u0144ski 2009a; Podko\u0144ski 2016). In his philosophical and\ntheological works, Kilvington provides many examples proving that\ninfinite sets are not equal, that is, that they are not of the same\ndensity. He also explains how to establish a one-to-one correspondence\nof the elements of such infinite sets. Kilvington affirms that all\ncreated infinities, being infinite, are equal \u2018in\nmultitude.\u2019 This, however, does not imply that infinities are\nnecessarily equal \u2018in magnitude\u2019, since two created\ninfinities can be at once equal and unequal with respect to multitude\nof their parts or their dimensions. Infinities can also be\n\u2018qualitatively\u2019 unequal because there is a qualitative\ndifference between God\u2019s infinity and every created\nbeing\u2019s infinity. God as the most perfect is the only being\nabsolutely infinite, whereas creatures as contingent beings can only\nbe relatively infinite. As Podko\u0144ski affirms \u201cKilvington\nmust have been convinced that an infinite set can be put in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with infinite subsets. And it is worth noting that this\nparadoxical feature of infinite sets nowadays serves as a criterion of\ndetermining them\u201d (see Podko\u0144ski 2009: 142).\n\nKilvington employs all types of measurement to describe different\ncases both real and imaginable. Having adopted Ockham\u2019s\nontological minimalism, he claims that absolutes, i.e., substances and\nqualities, are the only subjects that undergo changes. Therefore, such\nnotions as \u2018motion,\u2019 \u2018time,\u2019\n\u2018latitude,\u2019, and \u2018degree\u2019 do not have any\nrepresentation in reality and only serve as tools for the faultless\ndescription of the processes of various changes. Thus, Kilvington\ncontrasts things that are really distinct with things distinguishable\nonly in reason, i.e., in the imagination. Imaginary cases are\ndescriptions of hypothetical situations; to be imaginable means to be\npossible, i.e., not such as to generate a contradiction. Everything\nimaginable must be logically possible within a natural framework. So\nwe can imagine the void and formulate the rules of motion in it,\nbecause there is no contradiction either on the part of nature or on\nthe part of God for the void to exist. Any theory, whether it\ndescribes an imaginary case or an observed phenomenon, must be\ncoherent. Therefore, logic and mathematics are the best methods to\ndescribe any reality: factual or imaginable.\n\nThere are four levels in Kilvington\u2019s secundum\nimaginationem analyses. These levels may be classified according\nto their increasing abstraction and decreasing probability. On the\nfirst level, there are imaginary cases which are potentially\nobservable and which might occur in nature, such as Socrates\u2019\nbecoming white. On the second level are imaginary cases which cannot\nbe observed, even though they belong to the natural order. These cases\nillustrate the necessary consequences of the application of rules\nproperly describing natural phenomena\u2014the best example being the\nEarth\u2019s rectilinear motion, which is caused by its desire to\nunite the center of gravity with its own center. On the third level\nare cases not observable but theoretically possible, such as reaching\ninfinite speed in an instant. The fourth level concerns cases that are\nonly theoretically possible. Kilvington uses the last two groups of\nimaginable, i.e., hypothetical cases to reveal inconsistencies in\nreceived theories, especially from Aristotle, demonstrating\nmathematically the paradoxes that arise from Aristotle\u2019s laws of\nmotion. If hypothetical cases do not involve contradiction, there is\nno reason to reject them or exclude them from the realm of speculation\n(see Jung 2016).\n\nKilvington\u2019s secundum imaginationem analyses go\ntogether with his ceteris paribus method: he assumes that all\ncircumstances in the case being considered are the same, and that only\none or two chosen factors, which change during the process, cause\nchanges in the results.\n",
