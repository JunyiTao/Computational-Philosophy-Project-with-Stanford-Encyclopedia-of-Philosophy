    "main_text": "The Private Language Argument Expounded || Preliminaries\n3.1 Preliminaries\n\nAs already noted, the private language sections of Philosophical\nInvestigations are usually held to begin at \u00a7243 (though\nwe shall see that Wittgenstein relies on points made much earlier in\nthe book). The methodological issues canvassed above arise at the\noutset, in the interpretation of \u00a7243\u2019s crucial second\nparagraph.\n\nOn a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading, Wittgenstein begins to\nclarify what kind of philosophically important notion of private\nlanguage is to be examined, i.e., one that is necessarily private and\nwhich refers to one\u2019s immediate private sensations. In the remarks\nthat follow, Wittgenstein argues that the idea of such a private\nlanguage is nonsensical or incoherent because it is a violation of\ngrammar (i.e., Wittgenstein draws on his substantive views on\nmeaning). \n\nOn a resolute/Pyrrhonian reading, it is emphasized that the reader is\nasked in the first sentence of the second paragraph whether one can\nactually imagine a language for one\u2019s inner experiences, for\nprivate use. Wittgenstein at this point reminds the interlocutor that\nwe already use ordinary language for that. But the interlocutor\nquickly replies in the last three lines of \u00a7243 that what he is\nasking is whether we can imagine a private language that refers to\nwhat only the speaker can know. In the following sections,\nWittgenstein examines \u2018whether there is a way of meaning the\nwords of the penultimate sentence [of \u00a7243] that does not simply\nreturn us to a banality, whether in fact his interlocutor means\nanything in particular with those words\u2019 (Mulhall 2007, p. 18).\nThe question is whether the notion of a language \u2018which only I\nmyself can understand\u2019 can be given any substantial meaning to\nbegin with. On this latter reading, \u00a7\u00a7258 and 270, for\nexample, are attempts to give the interlocutor what he says he wants,\nbut which, in the end, amount to nothing (in the case of 258) or bring\nus back to a publicly understandable language (in the case of\n270).\n\nAs we saw above, in section 1.2, it is not clear that we must choose\nbetween these two readings. On either, the point of the private\nlanguage argument is that the idea is exposed as unintelligible when\npressed\u2014we cannot make sense of the circumstances in which we\nshould say that someone is using a private language.\n\nSo, having introduced the idea of a private language in the way\nalready quoted, Wittgenstein goes on to argue in a preliminary\ndiscussion (\u00a7\u00a7244\u2013255) that there are two senses of\n\u2018private\u2019 which a philosopher might have in mind in\nsuggesting that sensations are private, and that sensations as they\nare talked about in natural languages (such as English and German) are\nin fact private in neither of them. He then turns, at \u00a7256, to\nthe question whether there could be a private language at all. He\ncontinues to talk of sensations, and of pain as an example, but one\nshould remember that these are not our sensations, the\neveryday facts of human existence, but the supposed exemplars of\nphilosophical accounts of the everyday facts. Thus, for\ninstance, they might be the sensations of something like a Cartesian\nsoul (perhaps one associated with a physical body, as indicated in\n\u00a7\u00a7257 and 283), something which has no publicly available\nmental life and whose \u201cexperiences\u201d are accordingly\nprivate. (It is worth noting that the earlier Anscombe translation is\nmisleading here: in \u00a7243, for example, where the idea of a\nprivate language is introduced, it loses the crucial contrast, so\nevident in the original German, between the ordinary human beings\ndescribed as solitary speakers in the first paragraph and the second\nparagraph\u2019s mysterious \u2018one\u2019 who is the\n\u2018speaker\u2019 of a private language and whose nature is\ncarefully left unclear. See the recent 4th edition translation of this\nparagraph, a relevant part is in the first sentence of this article,\nto find a version closer to the original German.) Consistent with this\npoint is that in \u00a7256 Wittgenstein suggests that one cannot\narrive at the idea of a private language by considering a natural\nlanguage: natural languages are not private, for our sensations are\nexpressed. But neither can we arrive at the idea by starting with a\nnatural language and just subtracting from it all expression of\nsensations (temporary paralysis is clearly not in question), as he\nconsiders next, for as he says in \u00a7257, even if there could be\nlanguage in such a situation as this where teaching is impossible, the\nearlier argument of Philosophical Investigations\n(\u00a7\u00a733\u201335), concerning ostensive definition, has shown\nthat mere \u201cmental association\u201d of one thing with another\nis not alone enough to make the one into a name of the other. Naming\none\u2019s sensation requires a place for the new word: that is, a notion\nof sensation. The attempt to name a sensation in a conceptual vacuum\nmerely raises the questions of what this business is supposed to\nconsist in, and what is its point. But, for the sake of\ngetting to the heart of the matter, Wittgenstein puts the first of\nthese questions on one side and pretends that it is sufficient for the\nsecond to imagine himself in the position of establishing a private\nlanguage for the purpose of keeping a diary of his sensations.\n\nHowever, to investigate the possibility of the imagined diary case by\nexploring it from the inside (the only way, he thinks, really to\nexpose the confusions involved) requires him to use certain words when\nit is just the right to use these words which is in question. Thus he\nis forced to mention in \u00a7258 examples like ostensive definition,\nconcentrating the attention, speaking, writing, remembering, believing\nand so on, in the very process of suggesting that none of these can\nreally occur in the situation under consideration (\u00a7261).\n\nThis difficulty has often gone unnoticed by commentators on the\nargument, with particularly unhappy results for the understanding of\nthe discussion of the diary example. Fogelin [1976], for instance, a\nparadigm representative of Orthodoxy, treats this as a case where\nhe himself, a living embodied human being, keeps a diary and\nrecords the occurrences of a sensation which he finds it impossible to\ndescribe to anyone else. But we are not to assume that the description\nof the keeping of the diary is a description of a possible or even\nultimately intelligible case. In particular, we are not to think of\nsuch a human being\u2019s keeping a real diary, but of something like the\nCartesian internal equivalent. It is thus vital to the argument that\nthe diary case is presented in the first person, without our pressing\nthe question, \u2018Who is speaking?\u2019 At this stage we are\nsimply not to worry about whether the diary story ultimately makes\nsense or not. But the fact that it may not make sense must be\nremembered in reading what follows, which in strictness should\nconstantly be disfigured with scare quotes. (We shall, as we have\nalready, occasionally supply them as a reminder, reserving double\nquotes for this purpose.)\n\nTo summarize the argument\u2019s preliminary stage: In \u00a7256\nWittgenstein asked of the \u201cprivate language\u201d,\n\u2018How do I use words to signify my sensations?\u2019,\nand reminded us in \u00a7257 that we cannot answer \u2018As we\nordinarily do\u2019. So this question, which is the same question as\n\u2018How do I obtain meaning for the expressions in a \u201cprivate\nlanguage\u201d?\u2019 is still open; and the answer must be\nindependent of our actual connections between words and\nsensations. In the attempt to arrive at an answer, and explore the\nquestion in its full depth, he temporarily allows the use of the\nnotions of sensation and diary-keeping (despite the objections of\n\u00a7257), and imagines himself in the position of a private linguist\nrecording his sensations in a diary. The aim is to show that even if\nthis concession is made, meaning for a sensation-word still cannot be\nsecured and maintained by such a linguist. The crucial central part of\nthe argument begins here, at \u00a7258.\n",
