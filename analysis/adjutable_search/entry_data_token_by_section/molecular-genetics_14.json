    "main_text": "What is a gene? || Using a survey-based approach to identifying gene concepts\n4.5  Using a survey-based approach to identifying gene concepts\n\n\nStotz and Griffiths (2004) believe that the variety of gene concepts\nused throughout the biological sciences calls for a more systematic\nand explicitly empirical approach. They point out that individual\nphilosophers cannot grasp all the intricacies of the different\ncontexts across the broad range of biological sciences in which gene\nconcepts are employed. They have embarked upon an ambitious project to\nsurvey practicing scientists in an attempt to help identify how\nscientists actually conceive of genes. Their interest extends\nfar beyond understanding \u201cmolecular genetics.\u201d They hope\nto learn about the concepts employed in many different areas and\ncontexts of biology by spotting differences in the way biologists from\ndifferent areas (and biologists in different age groups, sexes, etc.)\nanswer sophisticated questionnaires.\n\n\nAn initial motivation behind Stotz and Griffith's project was to test\nphilosophical accounts of the gene concept. As Griffiths asked, if\ntheir survey-based study revealed that scientists don't actually\nthink of genes in the way set out by a philosophical account, then\nwhat value could the account possibly have? There are, however, a\nnumber of daunting, practical difficulties with using a questionnaire\nto learn how a person is thinking, especially if the person's thinking\ninvolves the use of multiple concepts and/or is sometimes or somewhat\nmuddled (Waters 2004b). It is also difficult to survey appropriate and\nrepresentative samples of scientists. Griffiths and Stotz are aware of\nthese difficulties and have refined their project through successive\nsurveys.\n\n\nEven if Stotz and Griffith's survey succeeds in identifying how\nscientists in different areas of biology actually think about genes in\ndifferent contexts, it does not follow that their findings would\nprovide an appropriate test of the classical, molecular, or process\nmolecular gene concepts. The aim of the proponents of these concepts\nis to re-interpret the knowledge of contemporary genetics by replacing\nsloppy thinking based on unclear concepts with more rigorous thinking\nin terms of precise concepts. Showing that scientists' actual\nthinking does not align with the precise application of these concepts\nwould not refute the analysis supporting the classical gene or\nmolecular gene concepts and it would not undermine the argument\nmotivating the proposal for the new process molecular gene\nconcept.\n\n\nAlthough it appears that survey-based findings would not provide an\nappropriate test of philosophical analyses of gene concepts, they\nmight provide, as Stotz and Griffiths claim, important information\nrelevant to those conducting philosophical research on gene concepts.\nFor example, if such surveys find significant differences in the way\nevolutionary biologists and developmental geneticists answer questions\nabout what counts as gene, philosophers might examine whether the\ncontexts in which these biologists practice call for different gene\nconcepts. Survey results could provide a useful heuristic for\nconducting concept analyses.\n",
