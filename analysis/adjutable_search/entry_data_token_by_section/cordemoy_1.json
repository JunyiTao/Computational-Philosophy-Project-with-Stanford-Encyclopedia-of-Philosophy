    "main_text": "Atomism\n2. Atomism\n\nDescartes had held that the essence of body is extension, and that as\na result matter can be divided without end. If it is the nature of a\nbody to take up space in three dimensions, that is, to have width,\nlength, and height, then we can always conceive of that width, length,\nor height being divided. Further, according to Cartesian metaphysics,\nextension is the principle attribute of body, and as such cannot exist\nindependently of body (nor can body exist independently of it). Thus\naccording to Descartes, anywhere there is extended space, there is\nbody occupying that space, making the existence of a void impossible.\nAnd so it is surprising to find Cordemoy, whose metaphysics is in most\nother respects quite Cartesian, arguing at the beginning of the\nDiscernement for the existence of both indivisible atoms and\nempty space.\n\nThe First Discourse of the Discernement opens with five\nclaims about bodies which lay the ground for Cordemoy\u2019s physics\n(which he goes on to discuss in Discourses Two and Three). He tells us\nthat bodies are: (1) limited in their extension, and this limit is\ncalled the \u2018figure\u2019 of the body; (2) inasmuch as each body\nis a substance, bodies are not divisible into smaller bodies, nor are\nbodies penetrable by other bodies; (3) the relation a body has to\nother bodies is called its \u2018place\u2019; (4) a change in this\nrelation is the motion of the body; and (5) when the relation\ncontinues unchanged, the body is at rest. Cordemoy then declares that\nmatter is clearly and distinctly understood as an assembly of bodies.\nProperly considered, bodies are parts of matter, and depending how\nthese bodies are related to each other determines what sort of portion\nof matter the collection is: if they are very near each other, it is a\nheap (un tas); if they are \u201cchanging their position\nincessantly\u201d (1968, 96), it is a fluid (une liqueur);\nand if the bodies are not moving and cannot be separated from each\nother, it is a mass (une masse).\n\nWhile not stated explicitly, Cordemoy\u2019s reason for accepting\natomism seems to be based on his understanding of the concept of\nsubstance. Following Descartes, Cordemoy takes substance to be that\nwhich requires nothing else for its existence. Strictly speaking, this\nwould make God the only substance, but in the created world, Descartes\nheld that we may consider minds and body to be substances in a\nqualified sense. Each of these substances has a principle attribute\ndistinguishable from it only by reason. It is this attribute through\nwhich we conceive the substance, and it is that to which all of the\nsubstance\u2019s other properties are referred. For minds this\nattribute is thought, and for body it is, as mentioned above,\nextension.\n\nWith regard to body, Cordemoy warns that we must be careful to avoid\nthe mistake made by other Cartesians, who have conflated what are in\nfact two distinct things, namely, \u2018bodies\u2019 and\n\u2018matter\u2019. The former are, according to Cordemoy, the true\nextended substances, while the latter are assemblages, or\ncollections, of the former. The key point is that as substances,\nbodies must be simple: if bodies had parts, they would depend on those\nparts to be what they are, and in this way the parts would threaten a\nbody\u2019s very status as a substance. Thus we are led to atomism on\nstrictly a priori grounds: in positing bodies as substances, we are\nprecluded from attributing parts to them, for if we did, they would no\nlonger be substances. Matter on this account is divisible not because\nits nature is extension and any extension can always be divided, but\nrather because it is composed of bodies which can be separated from\neach other, though each one is itself indivisible.\n\nThe reason for this confusion between body and matter is due, says\nCordemoy, to an over-reliance on the senses: \u201cwe have a very\nclear idea of body, and as we know that they are extended substances,\nwithout thinking clearly we join this notion which we have of body to\nthat which we have of matter. Taking a mass for a body, we consider it\nas a substance, believing that all that we see is only the same\nextension. And because all that we see as extended is divisible, we\nthus join the notion of that which is extended to the notion of that\nwhich is divisible, such that we believe divisible all that is\nextended\u201d (1968, 97). The bodies being too small to be\nperceived, we can be misled into thinking that a collection of bodies,\nthat is, matter, is the true extended substance, and from\nmatter\u2019s divisibility wrongly conclude that material substance\ncan therefore be divided.\n\nCordemoy also maintains the possibility of a void, that is, space\nwhich is truly empty, and as before, his argument is based on his\nunderstanding of the concept of substance. If we have three contiguous\nbodies and the one in the middle is destroyed in an instant, we will,\nCordemoy claims, be left with an empty space between the two remaining\nbodies (that is, the two would not instantaneously rush together).\nThese two bodies, being substances, possess a metaphysical\nindependence from what happens to other bodies. For Cordemoy, to hold\notherwise would disqualify bodies (atoms) from being substances, on\nhis understanding of the concept of substance. Likewise, if one could\nremove all of the matter filling a vase, the sides of the vase,\npace Descartes and others, would not collapse, according to\nCordemoy. The bodies that compose the sides are each themselves\nsubstances, and as such are ontologically independent of what happens\nto other bodies (for again, if they were not, they would not qualify\nas a substance).\n\nCordemoy concludes the First Discourse with a discussion of three\ninconveniens, problems with which Descartes\u2019 plenum\ntheory must deal but which Cordemoy\u2019s atomism escapes. The first\ninvolves a distinction between two concepts, \u2018indefinite\u2019\nand \u2018infinite\u2019, which Cordemoy claims amount to the same\nthing: \u201cWhen I ask [the Cartesians] if this substance, which\nthey believe to be divisible, is divisible to infinity, as it seems to\nme their supposition would give them to understand, they respond that\nit is not, but that it is divisible indefinitely. When I begged them\nto explain this indefinite division to me, I was led to understand it\nin the same way that the whole world understands the infinite\u201d\n(1968, 99). Descartes was (usually) careful to distinguish between\nthat to which we cannot see or comprehend an end, which he termed\n\u2018indefinite\u2019, and that which we know in a positive way to\nbe without limit, which he termed \u2018infinite\u2019. The\ndivisibility of matter is for Descartes indefinite, while only God can\nproperly be said to be infinite. Cordemoy\u2019s complaint is that if\n\u2018indefinite\u2019 and \u2018infinite\u2019 really amount to\nthe same thing\u2014and he thinks according to the Cartesians\u2019\nown account they do\u2014then \u201cthere is something\ninconceivable\u201d (ibid.) in claiming that bodies are\ndivisible ad infinitum, since this would threaten their\nstatus as substances. (Clearly, though, this objection goes through\nonly given a prior acceptance of Cordemoy\u2019s atomism.)\n\nThe second and third inconveniens both deal with Descartes\ntheory of the individuation of physical bodies. For Descartes, bodies\nare individuated in terms of motion: an individual body is that\nportion of matter which moves together, that is, which changes place\nwith respect to the bodies which are its neighbors. Cordemoy\u2019s\nfirst question is how, on this account, can we individuate a body at\nrest: \u201cAccording to their doctrine, we cannot conceive of a body\nat rest between other bodies, because supposing that it is touching\nthem, this doctrine teaches that together with them it makes only one\nbody. Yet it seems to me that we have a very clear and very natural\nidea of a body perfectly at rest between other bodies, where nothing\nis in motion, and what I say of each body accords perfectly well with\nthis idea\u201d (1968, 99). It is, then, our clear conception of a\nbody at rest between other bodies but at the same time distinct from\nthem which signals trouble for the Cartesians theory. Cordemoy, on the\nother hand, faces no such problem, since for him the only\ntrue physical individuals are bodies/atoms; all other\n\u2018bodies\u2019 are rightly called matter, and are individuals\nonly in a loose sense of the word.\n\nThe third problem raised by Cordemoy concerns a body which has its\ndifferent parts in motion in different directions, such as a tree and\nits branches being blown in the wind. According to Descartes\u2019\nown definition of a physical individual, we would seem to have a\nproblem, since the different parts are changing differently with\nrespect to the other individuals which would be considered its\nneighbors. In such cases, it would seem to \u201cfollow that when\nneighboring bodies push it in different spots along opposing lines,\nthey will divide it in as many ways as it is pushed\u201d\n(ibid.). As with the second complaint, this violates the\nclear idea we have of the object as one thing. And as before, Cordemoy\nnotes that no such problem arises for his atomism.\n\nCordemoy was, as mentioned previously, alone among Descartes\u2019\nfollowers in his acceptance of atomism. One of his harshest critics\nwas his fellow Cartesian Dom Robert Desgabets, who accused Cordemoy of\ngiving ammunition to the enemies of Descartes, namely the Gassendists,\nthemselves atomists. Desgabets had been sent a copy of the\nDiscernement by Clerselier, and quickly responded to it with\nhis Lettre \u00e9crite a M. Clerselier touchant les nouveaux\nraisonnements pour les atomes et le vide contenus dans le livre du\ndiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me (A Letter written to M.\nClerselier concerning the new arguments for atoms and the void\ncontained in the book on the distinction of the body and the\nsoul). In addition to his accusation of betraying the true\nphilosophy, Desgabets defends the intelligibility of the\nindefinite/infinite distinction and offers several criticisms of\nCordemoy\u2019s position. He notes that in Cartesian terms, as\ndistance is a mode, it can only exist as a mode of a substance. Thus\nwherever we have a distance, it must be a distance of\nsomething, and as distance is expressed quantitatively, that\nsomething can always be divided, even if only by God. The same line of\nthinking shows the impossibility of the void: if it is claimed that\nbetween two points there is only empty space, there is nothing there\nwhich could posses any properties, including length. So of what is the\nlength between the two points a property? Cordemoy did not respond to\nDesgabets in print, but the Benedictine would seem to have raised some\nimportant questions for anyone holding atomism grounded upon a\nCartesian metaphysics.\n",
