    "main_text": "Anthropogenic Climate Change\n5. Anthropogenic Climate Change\n\nThe idea that humans could change Earth\u2019s climate by emitting\nlarge quantities of carbon dioxide and other gases is not a new one\n(Fleming 1998; Weart 2008 [2017, Other Internet Resources]). In the\nlate nineteenth century, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated\nthat doubling the levels of carbonic acid (i.e., carbon dioxide) in\nthe atmosphere would warm Earth\u2019s average surface temperature by\nseveral degrees Celsius (Arrhenius 1896). By the mid-twentieth\ncentury, oceanographer Roger Revelle and colleagues concluded: \n\n\nBy the year 2000, the increase in atmospheric CO2 \u2026\nmay be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps marked change in\nclimate. (quoted in Oreskes 2007: 83\u201384) \n\n\nIn 1988, climate scientist James Hansen famously testified to the U.S.\nCongress that global warming was already happening. The same year, the\nWorld Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment\nProgram established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) \n\n\nto provide policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific\nbasis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for\nadaptation and mitigation. (IPCC 2013a) \n\n\nDrawing on the expertise of the international climate science\ncommunity, the IPCC has delivered assessment reports roughly every\nfive years since\n 1990.[3]\n\nBecause IPCC reports usefully synthesize a huge body of scientific\nresearch, they will be referenced frequently in what follows. The discussion\nwill focus primarily on questions about the physical climate system,\nrather than questions about the impacts of climate change on societies\nor about climate policy options; the latter, which are also addressed\nby the IPCC, call for expertise that extends well beyond climate\nscience (see IPCC 2014).\n Section 5.1\n discusses detection and attribution research, which is concerned with\nthe following questions: In what ways has Earth\u2019s climate\nchanged since pre-industrial times? How much have human activities,\nespecially human emissions of greenhouse gases, contributed to the\nchanges?\n Section 5.2\n considers the projection of future climate change, with special\nattention to debates about the interpretation of model-based\nprojections.\n Section 5.3\n provides a brief overview of several recent controversies related to\nthe methods and conclusions of climate change research. Finally,\n Section 5.4\n notes some of the ethical questions and challenges raised by the\nissue of anthropogenic climate change.\n",
