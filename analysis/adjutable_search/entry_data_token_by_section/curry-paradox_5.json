    "main_text": "Constructing Curry Sentences || Curry\u2019s Second Method, and Truth-Theoretic Curry Sentences\n2.2 Curry\u2019s Second Method, and Truth-Theoretic Curry Sentences\n\nDespite his remark about the \u201cEpimenides paradox\u201d, a form\nof the Liar paradox, Curry\u2019s second method is a variant\nof a related semantic paradox, Grelling\u2019s\n paradox.[9]\n In its original form, Grelling\u2019s paradox considers a property\npossessed by many words, namely the property a word has when it\nfails to exemplify the property it stands for (Grelling\n& Nelson 1908). For example, the\nword \u201coffensiveness\u201d has that property: it fails to\nexemplify the property it stands for, since it isn\u2019t offensive\n(see entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic).\n In effect, Curry considers instead the property a word has provided\nit exemplifies the property it stands for only if time is\ninfinite. Now suppose that our theory introduces a name \\(u\\) for\nthis property. Curry then shows how to construct a sentence that\n(speaking informally) says that the name \\(u\\) exemplifies the\nproperty it stands for. He shows that this sentence will serve as a\nCurry sentence for a theory of properties and the denotation of\n names.[10]\n\n\nThough this method of obtaining a Curry sentence is based on a\nsemantic feature of expressions, it still relies on property\nabstraction. Nonetheless, it can be viewed as a precursor to a wholly\nsemantic version. (Rather than consider the above-introduced property,\none could consider the predicate \u201capplies to itself only if time\nis infinite\u201d.) Accordingly, as Geach\n(1955) and L\u00f6b (1955) were\nthe first to show, Curry sentences can be obtained using semantic\nprinciples alone, without any reliance on property abstraction. Their\nroute corresponds to the informal argument, in\n section 1.1,\n involving the self-referential sentence \\(k\\) that reads \u201cIf\n\\(k\\) is true then time is infinite.\u201d\n\nFor this purpose, let \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\) be a theory of truth, where\n\\(T\\) is the truth predicate. Assume the \u201ctransparency\u201d\nprinciple\n\n\n(Truth) For every sentence \\(\\alpha\\), the sentences\n\\(T\\langle \\alpha \\rangle\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\).\n\n\nTo obtain a Curry sentence using this principle, assume there is a\nsentence \\(\\xi\\) that is \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\n {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\).[11]\n Then it follows immediately from (Truth) that\n\n\n\\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) and \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\)\nare intersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\).\n\n\nIn other words, \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) is a Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\).\n\nGeach notes that the semantic paradox that results from a sentence\nlike \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) resembles \u201cthe Curry paradox in\nset theory\u201d. L\u00f6b, who doesn\u2019t mention Curry\u2019s\nwork, credits the paradox to a referee\u2019s observation about the\nproof of what is now known as L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem concerning\nprovability (see entry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems).\n The referee, now known to have been Leon Henkin (Halbach\n& Visser 2014: 257), suggested\nthat the method L\u00f6b used in his proof \u201cleads to a\nnew derivation of paradoxes in natural language\u201d, namely the\ninformal argument of\n section 1.1\n above.[12] \n",
