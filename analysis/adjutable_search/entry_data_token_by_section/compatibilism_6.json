    "main_text": "Classical Compatibilism || The Classical Compatibilist Conditional Analysis\n2.2 The Classical Compatibilist Conditional Analysis\n\nConsider the following incompatibilist objection to the classical\ncompatibilist account of free will:\n\nIf determinism is true, and if at any given time, an unimpeded agent\nis completely determined to have the wants that she does have, and if\nthose wants causally determine her actions, then, even though she does\ndo what she wants to do, she cannot ever do otherwise. She\nsatisfies the classical compatibilist conditions for free will. But\nfree will requires the ability to do otherwise, and determinism is\nincompatible with this. Hence, the classical compatibilist account of\nfree will is inadequate. Determinism is incompatible with free will\nand moral responsibility because determinism is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise.\n\nThe classical compatibilist account of freedom set out thus far can be\nthought of as accounting for one-way freedom, which fixes\nonly on what a person does do, not on what alternatives she had to\nwhat she did. The incompatibilist challenge at issue here is that such\nfreedom, even if necessary, is insufficient in the absence of a\nfurther freedom to do other than as one does. \n\nClassical compatibilists have responded by arguing that determinism\nis compatible with the ability to do otherwise. To show this,\nthey attempted to analyze an agent\u2019s ability to do otherwise in\nconditional terms (e.g., Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, p.73; Ayer 1954; or Hobart 1934). Since\ndeterminism is a thesis about what must happen in the future given\nthe actual past, determinism is consistent with the future being\ndifferent given a different past. So the classical\ncompatibilists analyzed any assertion that an agent could have done\notherwise as a conditional assertion reporting what an agent would\nhave done under certain counterfactual conditions. These conditions\ninvolved variations on what a freely willing agent wanted (chose,\nwilled, or decided) to do at the time of her freely willed action.\nSuppose that an agent freely willed X. According to the\nclassical compatibilist conditional analysis, to say that, at\nthe time of acting, she could have done Y and not X\nis just to say that, had she wanted (chosen, willed, or\ndecided) to do Y and not X at that time,\nthen she would have done Y and not done X.\nHer ability to have done otherwise at the time at which she acted\nconsisted in some such counterfactual truth.\n\nBut given that a determined agent is determined at the time of action\nto have the wants that she does have, how is it helpful to state what\nshe would have done had she had different wants than the wants that\nshe did have? Assuming the truth of determinism, at the time at which\nshe acted she could have had no other wants than the wants that her\ncausal history determined her to have. \n\nIn response, the classical compatibilist holds that that the\nconditional analysis brings into relief a rich picture of freedom. In\nassessing an agent\u2019s action, the analysis accurately\ndistinguishes those actions she would have performed if she wanted,\nfrom those actions she could not have performed even if she wanted.\nThis, the classical compatibilist held, effectively distinguishes\nthose alternative courses of action that were within the scope of the\nagent\u2019s abilities at the time of action, from those courses of\naction that were not. This just is the distinction between what an\nagent was free to do and what she was not free to do. This is not at\nall a superficial freedom; it demarcates what persons have within\ntheir control from what falls outside that purview.\n\nDespite the classical compatibilists\u2019 ingenuity, their analysis\nof could have done otherwise failed decisively. The classical\ncompatibilists wanted to show their incompatibilist interlocutors that\nwhen one asserted that a freely willing agent had alternatives\navailable to her\u2014that is, when it was asserted that she could\nhave done otherwise\u2014that assertion could be analyzed as a\nconditional statement, a statement that is perspicuously compatible\nwith determinism. But as it turned out, the analysis was refuted when\nit was shown that the conditional statements sometimes yielded the\nimproper result that a person was able to do otherwise even though it\nwas clear that at the time the person acted, she had no such\nalternative and therefore was not able to do otherwise in the\npertinent sense (Chisholm 1964, in Watson (ed.) 1982, pp.26\u20137;\nor van Inwagen 1983, pp. 114\u20139). Here is such an example:\n\nSuppose that Danielle is psychologically incapable of wanting to touch\na blond haired dog. Imagine that, on her sixteenth birthday, unaware\nof her condition, her father brings her two puppies to choose between,\none being a blond haired Lab, the other a black haired Lab. He tells\nDanielle just to pick up whichever of the two she pleases and that he\nwill return the other puppy to the pet store. Danielle happily, and\nunencumbered, does what she wants and picks up the black Lab.\n\nWhen Danielle picked up the black Lab, was she able to pick up the\nblond Lab? It seems not. Picking up the blond Lab was an alternative\nthat was not available to her. In this respect, she could not have\ndone otherwise. Given her psychological condition, she cannot\neven form a want to touch a blond Lab, hence she could not pick one\nup. But notice that, if she wanted to pick up the blond Lab,\nthen she would have done so. Of course, if she wanted to pick\nup the blond Lab, then she would not suffer from the very\npsychological disorder that causes her to be unable to pick up blond\nhaired doggies. The classical compatibilist analysis of \u2018could\nhave done otherwise\u2019 thus fails. According to the analysis, when\nDanielle picked up the black Lab, she was able to pick up the\nblonde Lab, even though, due to her psychological condition, she\nwas not able to do so in the relevant respect. Hence, the\nanalysis yields the wrong result.\n\nSo even if an unencumbered agent does what she wants, if she is\ndetermined, at least as the incompatibilist maintains, she could not\nhave done otherwise. Since, as the objection goes, freedom of will\nrequires freedom involving alternative possibilities, classical\ncompatibilist freedom falls.\n",
