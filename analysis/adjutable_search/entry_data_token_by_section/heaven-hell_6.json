    "main_text": "Free\u2013will Theodicies of Hell || Moral Freedom and Rationality\n3.1 Moral Freedom and Rationality\n\nGiven the New Testament imagery associated with Gehenna, the Lake of\nFire, and the outer darkness\u2014where there is \u201cweeping and\ngnashing of teeth\u201d\u2014the question is not how\nsomeone in a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception could\nfreely choose separation from the divine nature over union with it;\nthe question is instead how someone could both experience\nsuch separation (or the unbearable misery of hell, for example)\nand freely choose to remain in such a state forever. This is\nnot a problem for the Augustinians because, according to them, the\ndamned have no further choice in the matter once their everlasting\npunishment commences. But it is a problem for those free-will theists\nwho believe that the damned freely embrace an eternal destiny apart\nfrom God, and the latter view requires, at the very least, a plausible\naccount of the relevant freedom. \n\nNow, as already indicated, those who embrace a free-will theodicy of\nhell typically appeal, in the words of Jonathan Kvanvig, to \u201ca\nlibertarian account of human freedom in order to provide a complete\nresponse to\u201d the problem of hell (Kvanvig 2011, 54). But of\ncourse such a \u201ccomplete response\u201d would also require a\nrelatively complete account of libertarian freedom. According to\nKvanvig, \u201csome formulation of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities (PAP) correctly describes this notion of [libertarian]\nfreedom\u201d; and, as he also points out, this \u201cprinciple\nclaims that in order to act freely one must be able to do\notherwise\u201d (48). But at most PAP merely sets forth a necessary\ncondition of someone acting freely in the libertarian sense, and it\nincludes no requirement that a free choice be even minimally rational.\nSo consider again the example, introduced in section 2.1 above, of a\nschizophrenic young man who kills his loving mother, believing her to\nbe a sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother; and this\ntime suppose further that he does so in a context in which PAP obtains\nand he categorically could have chosen otherwise (perhaps because he\nworries about possible retaliation from other sinister space aliens).\nWhy suppose that such an irrational choice and action, even if not\ncausally determined, would qualify as an instance of acting freely?\nEither our seriously deluded beliefs, particularly those with\ndestructive consequences in our own lives, are in principle\ncorrectable by some degree of powerful evidence against them, or the\nchoices that rest upon them are simply too irrational to qualify as\nfree moral choices.\n\nIf that is true, then not just any causally undetermined choice, or\njust any agent caused choice, or just any randomly generated selection\nbetween alternatives will qualify as a free choice for which the\nchoosing agent is morally responsible. Moral freedom also requires a\nminimal degree of rationality on the part of the choosing agent,\nincluding an ability to learn from experience, an ability to discern\nnormal reasons for acting, and a capacity for moral improvement. With\ngood reason, therefore, do we exclude lower animals, small children,\nthe severely brain damaged, and perhaps even paranoid schizophrenics\nfrom the class of free moral agents. For, however causally\nundetermined some of their behaviors might be, they all lack some part\nof the rationality required to qualify as free moral\n agents.[9]\n\n\nNow consider again the view of C. S. Lewis and many other Christians\nconcerning the bliss that union with the divine nature entails, so\nthey believe. and the objective horror that separation from it\nentails, and suppose that the outer darkness\u2014that is, a soul\nsuspended alone in nothingness, without even a physical order to\nexperience and without any human relationships at all\u2014should be\nthe logical limit (short of annihilation) of possible separation from\nthe divine nature. These ideas seem to lead naturally to a dilemma\nargument for the conclusion that a freely chosen eternal destiny apart\nfrom God is metaphysically impossible. For either a person S is fully\ninformed about who God is and what both union with the divine nature\nand separation from it would entail, or S is not so informed. If S\nis fully informed and should choose a life apart from God\nanyway, then S\u2019s choice would be utterly and almost\ninconceivably irrational; such a choice would fall well below the\nthreshold required for moral freedom. And if S is not fully informed,\nthen God can of course continue to work with S, subjecting S to new\nexperiences, shattering S\u2019s illusions, and correcting S\u2019s\nmisjudgments in perfectly natural ways that do not interfere with\nS\u2019s freedom. Beyond that, for as long as S remains less than\nfully informed, S is simply in no position to reject the true God; S\nmay reject a caricature of God, perhaps even a caricature of S\u2019s\nown devising, but S is in no position to reject the true God.\nTherefore, in either case, whether S is fully informed or less than\nfully informed, it is simply not possible that S should reject the\ntrue God freely. \n\nBy way of a reply to this argument and in defense of his own\nfree\u2013will approach to hell\u2014which, by the way, in no way\nexcludes the possibility that some inhabitants of hell may\neventually escape from it\u2014Jerry Walls concedes that \u201cthe\nchoice of evil is impossible for anyone who has a fully formed\nawareness that God is the source of happiness and sin the cause of\nmisery\u201d (Walls 1992, 133). But Walls also contends that, even if\nthose in hell have rejected a caricature of God rather than the true\nGod, it remains possible that some of them will finally make a\ndecisive choice of evil and will thus remain in hell forever.\nHe then makes a three-fold claim: first, that the damned have in some\nsense deluded themselves, second, that they have the power to cling to\ntheir delusions forever, and third, that God cannot forcibly remove\ntheir self-imposed deceptions without interfering with their\nfreedom in relation to God (Walls 1992, Ch. 5).\n\nFor more detailed discussions of these and related issues, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Craig 1989 and 1993, Talbott 2007, Walls 1992\n(Ch. 5), 2004a, and 2004b, Kronen and Reitan 2011 (142\u2013146), and\nManis 2016 and 2019.
