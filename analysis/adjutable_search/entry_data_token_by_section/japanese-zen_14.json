    "main_text": "An Experiential Meaning of Not-Two || Zen \u201cSeeing\u201d\n6.3 Zen \u201cSeeing\u201d\n\nThe experiential dimension in which Zen\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d\nbecomes understandable refers to a quiescent state of meditation in\nwhich is arrested the activity of an individual practitioner\u2019s\nego-consciousness that functions in a close correlation with his or\nher body. Upon reaching such a meditational state, the Zen\npractitioner comes to experience an event generally known as\n\u201cseeing into one\u2019s nature\u201d (kensh\u014d),\nan initial satori experience. Although this phrase may on the\nsurface suggest a dualistic state, namely that there is something that\nis called \u201cnature,\u201d which the Zen practitioner comes to\nsee as an object. This interpretation occurs because\n\u201cseeing\u201dis understood to be an intentional activity of the\npractitioner. However, this \u201cseeing\u201d has a sense of\nbecoming visible such that \u201cone\u2019s own nature\u201d emerges in\nthe meditative awareness when the activity of ego-consciousness is\narrested. Once this experience occurs, the practitioner gradually\nturns the seeing into one\u2019s nature (according to the interpretation\nvis-\u00e0-vis the acquired enlightenment), or the\npractitioner realizes that one\u2019s nature is seeing (according to the\ninterpretation vis-\u00e0-vis the original enlightenment).\nThe Zen tradition interprets \u201cnature\u201d to be\n\u201cbuddha-nature,\u201d i.e., the possibility to be awakened from\nfundamental ignorance. That is to say, to become a Buddha, and the way\nof its being is designated by the term tathat\u0101, suchness\nor a thing-event\u2019s being such that it is showing its\nprimordial mode of being. When this aspect of knowledge is emphasized,\nZen calls it \u201coriginal\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\nknowledge. In this connection, it contends that the\n\u201cseeing\u201d is \u201cnot two,\u201d i.e., it is\nnon-dualistic in nature. \n\nTo illustrate an experiential basis for the above observation, we may\ncite another example, namely D\u014dgen\u2019s enlightenment\nexperience. This will aid the reader to catch a glimpse of an\nexperiential meaning of \u201cnot two,\u201d for it is descriptive\nof the experience itself. He expresses it as \u201cdropping off the\nbody and the mind\u201d (shinjin datsuraku). (In order to\nget an idea of this experience from a contemporary point-of-view, or\nfrom outside of Zen tradition, one may also consider out-of-body\nexperiences.) The experience of \u201cdropping off the body and the\nmind\u201d informs us that the dualistic relationship between the\nmind and the body has disappeared in meditational awareness\nand by implication \u201cI\u201d and others, and \u201cI\u201d and\nnature. Hence they are \u201cnot two.\u201d If the distinction has\ndisappeared, it implies that the Zen practitioner is thrown into a\nnon-dualistic domain of experience. It points to a practical\ntranscendence from the everyday either-or, ego-logical, dualistic\nstandpoint. \n\nIn light of the outer-inner distinction Zen interprets the\nnon-dualistic experience to mean that the distinction has been\nepistemologically collapsed, as it arises in such a way to respond to\nthe dualistic perspective from which the outer and the inner\nworlds appeared. It understands this collapsing of the distinction\nthen to be the meaning of \u201cnot two,\u201d from which an\nholistic perspective emerges. Conceptually, Zen takes this\nholistic perspective to mean the de-substantialization and\nde-ontologization of any two polar concepts, such as one and many,\nbeing and non-being, universal and particular, absolute and relative,\ntranscendence and immanence, and birth and death. Zen\u2019s\nobservation is that each of the polar terms is non-dualistically\nrelated to each of the other polar terms such that they are connected\nwith, interdependent on, and relative to, each other for their being\nand meaning. They are thrown into a holistic context of an\ninterdependent causal series. And for this series to be operative, Zen\nmaintains, following N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, that each of these terms\nthat enters the relationship is empty of self-nature, where\nself-nature means a power to generate itself on its own without\ndependence on anything. For if thing-events designated by these terms\nare endowed with self-nature, they cannot enter into the series; what\nenters such a series is only an accidental attribute or\nproperty. According to the substantialistic or essentialistic\nontology, nothing can really change. For example, criminals who want\nto correct their criminal behavior cannot change themselves if being a\ncriminal is the essential characterization of their being. This would\npose an insurmountable challenge, if not impossibility, to a\ncorrection officer at a prison. Or, for that matter, anyone who wants\nto correct one\u2019s own psychological characteristic or tendency,\nparticularly if it happens to be pathological, cannot succeed in such\nself-correction if it is an essential characterization of one\u2019s\nbeing. \n\nIn order to give a still more concrete sense of what Zen-seeing is\nlike, we now return to the question of how Zen understands the\nexperiential meaning of \u201cseeing into one\u2019s nature.\u201d\nZen\u2019s contention is that the bottomless ground is that which\nnon-dualistically \u201csees\u201d when the practitioner experiences\nthe state of nothing (or no-thought and no-image). How then does Zen\narticulate this \u201cseeing\u201d? This question points to an\nexamination of the epistemic structure of how knowledge operates in\nZen experience. For this purpose, the following Zen dialogue between\nJinne and Ch\u014dsetsu concerning \u201cno-thought\u201d is\nilluminating. Although it is lengthy, we quote it in full in order\nto provide a sense of how a Zen dialogue unfolds:\n\n\nThe disciple asks: Then what is it [i.e., no-thought]?\n\nThe master replies: It is nothing like \u201cwhat is.\u201d\nTherefore, we can not explain \u201cno-thought.\u201d The reason why\nI am speaking about it now is because you have asked about it. If you\nhadn\u2019t asked about it, there would be no need to explain it. Suppose\nthat there is a clear, transparent mirror. If it does not face a\nthing, no image is reflected in it. To say that it mirrors an image\nmeans that because it faces something, it just mirrors its image.\n\nThe disciple asks: If it does not face any thing, is there or is there\nnot a reflection in the mirror?\n\nThe master replies: That the mirror reflects a thing means that it\nalways mirrors regardless of whether it is facing or not facing a\nthing.\n\nThe disciple asks: If there is no image and since you do not give an\nexplanation, how can all beings and nonbeings become an issue? Now\nwhen you say that it always mirrors, how does it mirror?\n\nThe master replies: When I say that the mirror always mirrors, it is\nbecause a clear, transparent mirror possesses an original nature as\nits essential activity of always mirroring things. Analogously,\npeople\u2019s mind is originally undefiled, and naturally possesses a\nsuperb light of wisdom that illuminates the perfect world of\nnirv\u0101na.\n\nThe disciple asks: Insofar as people\u2019s minds are originally like\nthat, when do people get it?\n\nThe master replies: It just sees nothing.\n\nThe disciple asks: When it is nothing, what can it see?\n\nThe master replies: Seeing is not like something you can call a\nthing.\n\nThe disciple asks: If it is not like anything one can call a thing,\nwhat does it see?\n\nThe master replies: it sees no-thing. That is the true seeing. It\nalways sees.\n(Yanagita, 1974, 132\u20133.)\n\n\nUnlike most Zen dialogues that are often enigmatic and puzzling to\npeople outside the tradition, this dialogue provides an explanation\nthat indicates what \u201cseeing\u201d is like in Zen\nexperience. This \u201cseeing\u201d is said to be \u201cseeing\nnothing or no-thing,\u201d and Jinne speaks of it by appealing to the\nanalogy of a mirror, although he makes a disclaimer that it cannot\nadequately be explained in words. To get a glimpse of what he means by\n\u201cseeing,\u201d it is helpful to take note of the following\npoints regarding this analogy. Jinne conceives of a mirror in terms of\ntwo modalities: the mirror in and of itself and the mirror as it\nengages an object other than itself. It is important to keep in mind\nthat both are understood in light of their activity. He characterizes\nthe \u201coriginal nature\u201d of the mirror in and of itself as\nbeing \u201cclear, transparent\u201d (or \u201cundefiled\u201d),\nwherein it is said to always mirror.  \u201cOriginal\u201d\nmeans that it is not contingent on experience, while\n\u201calways\u201d refers to the mirror\u2019s ceaseless activity\nof mirroring. Whether \u201cthere is\u201d or \u201cthere is\nnot\u201d a specific object to mirror is a contingent matter for the\nmirror in and of itself. What makes a mirror what it\nis is its activity of always mirroring, and when considered\nin and of itself, it possesses no specific image to mirror. There is\nno characteristic to it and hence no image appearing in it, i.e.,\n\u201cno-thought\u201d or \u201cno-image.\u201d This is the\nmeaning of \u201cno-thing or nothing\u201d in the phrase\n\u201cseeing no-thing or nothing.\u201d In other\nwords, the mirror is turned into nothing, or to use the earlier\nphrase, the bottomless ground is nothing except, epistemologically\nspeaking, its capacity to mirror, and even this capacity is rendered\n\u201cnothing\u201d when it is in no use. \n\nZen explains the fact that the mirror \u201cjust sees\nno-thing or nothing\u201d when its act of seeing is mobilized in\n\u201cfacing\u201d a thing. The adverb \u201cjust\u201d is\ncrucial. \u201cJust\u201d here means without discrimination, without\nsuperimposition, without projection, or in short, without positing an\nego-consciousness as that which sees. In phenomenological terms, there\nis no thetic positing in this kind of seeing. Zen maintains that these\ncharacterizations obtain because the Zen practitioner \u201ckicked\nthrough the bottom of the bucket,\u201d a practical transcendence. In\nother words, Zen\u2019s contention is that there is no\ndetermination whatsoever in the mirror\u2019s activity of\n\u201cjust seeing.\u201d That there is no determination means to Zen\nthat because the bottomless ground is nothing, it does not impose form\non things that are mirrored. When these qualifications are taken\ntogether, Zen interprets \u201cjust seeing no-thing or nothing\u201d\nto mean seeing or mirroring things without discrimination, that is,\nwith a sense of equality. When a mirror, for example,\nreflects an image of a beautiful object, it does not make any\ndiscriminatory value judgment that it is beautiful. And neither does\nit make any discriminatory value judgment when it mirrors an ugly\nobject. It mirrors thing-events as they are. That is, the mirror does\nnot take any stance of likes and dislikes; it does not take a stance\nof \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst.\u201d It is non-egological in\nmirroring each thing equally.\n\n\n Moreover, Zen observes that the nature\nof the mirror is such that it does not change due to the kind of\nobject it mirrors. For example, it does not increase or decrease in\nsize in virtue of the fact that it mirrors an object. (Bankei, for\nexample, expresses it as the \u201cunborn.\u201d) It remains as it\nis in its original nature of always mirroring, which highlights the\nfact that it is clear and transparent. Because equality is the\ncharacteristic of this seeing, Zen speaks of the activity of this\nseeing as nondiscriminatory. Yet, because an object is\nmirrored as object, whether beautiful or ugly, Zen considers the act\nof mirroring to be a \u201cdiscernment.\u201d Therefore, Zen\ncharacterizes the \u201cseeing\u201d in \u201cseeing no-thing or\nnothing\u201d in its act-aspect as a discernment\nvis-\u00e0-vis nondiscrimination (mubunbetsu\nno funbetsu). This, Jinne says, is \u201ctrue seeing,\u201d\nwhich is non-discriminatory wisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101).\nThrough this mirror analogy, Zen wants to point out what the minds of\npeople are like in their original nature and activity. Zen\nsummarizes all of the above characteristics of seeing by employing a\nsimple phrase: \u201cmotion in stillness\u201d\n(seich\u016b no d\u014d). However, an objection may\nbe raised against Zen\u2019s holistic, non-dualistic\n\u201cseeing\u201d or \u201cmirroring,\u201d namely, the objection\nthat if there is something that is mirrored, does that not still imply\na dualistic epistemological structure? Zen would respond that this\nobjection ignores the fact that the ground of seeing is the bottomless\nground that is nothing. What appears against mirror\nqua nothing is just an object. In such a seeing, the object\nalone shines forth. Hence, it is characterized, to use\nNishida\u2019s terminology, as \u201cseeing without a seer.\u201d\n(See the entry on \n The Kyoto School, Sect. 3.3.)\n Below, we will explore further the structure of how things appear in\nZen.\n\nAlthough it may sound paradoxical, Zen maintains that this ground is\nalso a fount of creativity. Because there is no determination\nin the ground, it is pregnant with many possibilities or meanings to\nbe realized. Zen maintains, via the influences from philosophical\nDaoism, that this creativity is in the same order as that of nature,\nfor the practitioner reaches the original source prior to the\ndistinction between the outer world and the inner world. (Hence, Zen\nunderstands, as was mentioned in the foregoing, the human being to be\n\u201ca being-in-nature.\u201d) \n\nIt often uses the phrase \u201cno-mind\u201d (mushin) to\ngenerally designate the above experiential dimension. However, Zen\ndoes not mean it to be a mindless state, much less losing the\nmind. Nor does it mean a disappearance of the mind. Rather it\ndesignates a dimension of experience in which the\nego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind\ndisappears. This may be illustrated in terms of seeing things that\noccurs in a deep state of meditative absorption, where\n\u201cseeing\u201d means becoming visible as mentioned above. Zen\nadepts are said to acquire a power of meditation\n(Jpn.: j\u014driki), which is related to abilities like\nclairvoyance, clairaudience, and retrocognition. These abilities\ncoincide with those of two of the three night-watches on the night of\nhistorical Buddha\u2019s enlightenment experience. Once such a power\nbecomes available to the meditators, they intentionally focus on\nseeing whatever they want to see. This is an activity of\nego-consciousness, but after settling into a deeper state of\nabsorption, the person\u2019s ego-conscious activity ceases and an\nimage appears from the unconscious in response to the meditator\u2019s\nintention. This is because the unconscious has an autonomous activity\nthat works independent of conscious will. This occurs once the\nmeditator eliminates or lessens the oppositional and conflicting\nrelationship between the consciousness and unconscious. If,\nhowever, the meditator tries to see an image by relying on his or her\nego-consciousness, the image which has surfaced in the field of\nmeditative awareness immediately disappears, because the meditator\nslips back into a dualistic state from the non-dualistic state. The\nmeditator must remain in a non-dualistic state in order to see what\nappears in the field of meditative awareness.\n\n\nPhilosophically speaking, we can characterize this experiential event\nthat the Zen practitioner trans-descends into, and hence transcends,\nthe ego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind. Zen\ncontends that this arises due to adhering to \u201cname-form\u201d (Jpn.:\nmy\u014dshiki; Skrt.: n\u0101mar\u016bpa). This\ntranscendence results in a rejection of the belief that there is a\nreality corresponding to a name, or generally that there is a reality\ncorresponding to a linguistic activity. Through the state of no-mind,\nZen observes that each individual thing that is mirrored is recognized\nfor the first time to be individual qua the\nindividual with a sense of equality that is due to other individual\nthings. \n",
