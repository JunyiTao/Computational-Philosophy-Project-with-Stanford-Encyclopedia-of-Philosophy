    "main_text": "Liberty || Determinism and agent-causation\n4.2 Determinism and agent-causation\n\nThere is much to suggest that Price is a libertarian who denies\npsychological determinism and embraces agent-causation instead. It is\nwe, and not our psychological states, that determine our\nactions. The self stands above the fray, as it were, and decides which\nreasons or motives we will act on. The following passages are\ntypical.\n\n\nDetermination requires an efficient cause. If that cause is the being\nhimself, I plead for no more. If not, then it is no longer\nhis determination; that is, he is no longer the\ndeterminer, but the motive, or whatever else any one will say to be\nthe cause of the determination. To ask, what effects our\ndetermination, is the very same with asking who did an action, after\nbeing informed that such a one did it. (R 181\u20132)\n\n[It is] very plain, that motives can have no concern in\neffecting [the agent\u2019s] determination \u2026 What\nwould be more absurd than to say, that our inclinations act upon us,\nor compel us; that our desires and fears put us into motion,\nor produce our volitions; that is, are agents? (R\n183n)\n\n\nD. O. Thomas (1977: 160\u20132) points out, however, that there are\npassages in Price in which he appears to embrace psychological\ndeterminism, of which this is one of the most striking.\n\n\nWere we thoroughly acquainted with the heart of a man, the turn of his\ntemper, and the make of his mind, we should never want experience to\ninform us, what he will do, or how far he is to be trusted (R 28).\n\n\nSolving these difficulties is beyond the scope of this entry, but we\nmight note that while causal determinism (whether physical or\npsychological) entails that, in principle, all events are completely\npredictable, including human actions, the entailment does not run the\nother way. What is predictable need not be causally determined.\nConsider God, the morally perfect agent. He will always act according\nto the dictates of reason, and thus has moral freedom to the highest\ndegree. This need not preclude his having freedom of choice, however.\nPrice\u2019s view is that he has the power, the physical\nliberty, to do or abstain, but his character is such that he\nwill not do the wrong thing. (R 206)\n\nWhat of finite agents? In the passage from which the quotation comes,\nPrice is contrasting our belief that phenomena are regularly connected\nwith each other with a real understanding of why this is so.\n\n\nThe whole meaning of accounting for a fact, implies something in the\nnature of objects that includes a connexion between them, or a fitness\nin certain ways to influence one another. \u2026While we only see\none thing constantly attending or following another, without\nperceiving the real dependence and connexion \u2026 we are\nnecessarily dissatisfied. (R 27)\n\n\nGiven this context, Price may be claiming simply that, were we to\nunderstand the light in which an agent saw all the considerations\nrelevant to acting, we would know how he would choose. That may be\ncompatible with the agent\u2019s character being self-formed by his\nchoices.\n\nHere are two difficulties for Price\u2019s claim that understanding\nthe light in which someone saw their action would enable us to predict\nwhat they would do. First, it is questionable whether weak-willed\nactions are fully intelligible. Although the agent has reasons for\nwhat he does, they do not explain his making the worse rather than the\nbetter choice. Second, if we are genuinely able to form and change our\ncharacters through our choices, then there must be occasions on which\nwe act out of character. If there is real freedom of choice even God\nmight not know with complete certainty what we will do (though this view, known as Open Theism, might be unpalatable to\nPrice).\n",
