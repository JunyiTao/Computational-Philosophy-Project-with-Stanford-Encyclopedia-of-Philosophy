Even our most\nmundane, biologically based activities, such as eating, sleeping, and\nsex, depend on engagement with artifacts. Moreover, many of the plants\nand animals we encounter on a daily basis qualify as biological\nartifacts (Sperber 2007). But unlike language\u2014which also\npervades human life from top to bottom\u2014artifacts as such are not\nthe subject matter of any well-defined area of philosophical research.\nThis is as much the case today as it has been throughout the history\nof Western philosophy (Dipert 1993).\n\nPhilosophy of technology might have played this role, but historically\nit has not done so. Although its roots reach back to the\n19th century, philosophy of technology became a widely\nrecognized specialization only in the second half of the\n20th century. This early phase was dominated by so-called\n\u201chumanities philosophy of technology\u201d (Mitcham 1994).\nHeavily influenced by Martin Heidegger\u2019s (1954 [1977]) seminal\nessay, \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology\u201d, this strain\nof philosophy of technology focuses primarily on the cultural and\nsocial effects of industrial and post-industrial technologies. In the\nlast few decades, a companion strain of philosophy of technology,\nvariously denominated \u201canalytic\u201d (Franssen, Lokhorst,\n& van de Poel 2018) or \u201cengineering\u201d (Mitcham 1994)\nphilosophy of technology has come to prominence. It is focused on\nthe genesis of technologies in the practices of modern science and\nengineering. Thus the net effect has been to focus philosophy of\ntechnology almost exclusively on modern and emerging technologies,\nrather than on artifacts in general.\n\nThe aim of this article, then, is to bring together discussions of\nartifacts occurring in sometimes far-flung areas of philosophy, as\nwell as related discussions in other disciplines. Section 1 concerns\nquestions of definition. Section 2 focuses on the metaphysics of\nartifacts. Section 3 turns to epistemological issues. There are also\nimportant normative issues concerning artifacts, but these are covered\nin other articles in this Encyclopedia, listed in the Related Entries\nsection below.\n", "toc": [{"#Defi": "1.

Definition\n\nA standard philosophical definition of\n\u201cartifact\u201d\u2014often assumed even when not explicitly\nstated\u2014is that artifacts are objects made intentionally, in\norder to accomplish some purpose (Hilpinen 1992; 2011). This\ndefinition is rooted ultimately in Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween things that exist by nature and things that exist by craft\n(Metaphysics 1033a ff., Nicomachean Ethics 1140a\nff., Physics 192b ff.). Those that exist by nature have their\norigin in themselves, whereas those that exist by craft have their\norigin in the craftsperson\u2014specifically, in the form of the\nthing as it exists in the mind of the maker. Both Aristotle and his\ncontemporary descendants are primarily concerned to distinguish\nartifacts from objects that occur naturally, without any human\nintervention.\n\nOn this standard definition, artifacts must satisfy three conditions.\nThey must be intentionally produced, thus ruling out unintended\nby-products of intentional actions, such as the shavings that result\nfrom woodcarving, as well as all naturally occurring objects, such as\nsalamanders and stars. They must involve modification of materials,\nthus ruling out naturally occurring objects even when used\nintentionally for a purpose, such as sticks thrown to amuse your dog.\nAnd they must be produced for a purpose. This rules out intentionally\nmodified objects that are nevertheless not intended to accomplish any\nfurther goal, such as the scraps produced when you intentionally, but\nfor no particular reason, tear up a piece of paper before throwing it\naway. Presumably, then, these three conditions are intended to be\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient to distinguish artifacts\nfrom naturally occurring objects.\n\nThree remarks about this definition are in order. First, it does not\nrule out the possibility that at least some things made by non-human\nanimals are artifacts. Spider webs do have a purpose, for instance,\nand are clearly made rather than naturally occurring. But we may\nhesitate to attribute intention to the spiders, given the instinctive\nnature of their web-weaving behavior. Beavers, on the other hand,\nmight be thought to intentionally construct dams in order to create\nponds. This implication of the standard definition fits well with the\nburgeoning evidence for sophisticated cognition among non-human\nanimals in general, and their ability to manufacture and use tools and\nother structures in particular (Shumaker, Walkup, & Beck 2011;\nGould & Gould 2007). This is an important area of research in\nethology and comparative psychology. However, for the purposes of this\narticle we will focus on human artifacts.\n\nSecond, many things we would not ordinarily label as artifacts in\nEnglish might nevertheless count under this definition. We usually\nreserve the term \u201cartifact\u201d for tangible, durable objects\nsuch as an archaeologist might unearth. But objects made intentionally\nfor a purpose include many that are ephemeral or abstract. Candidates\ninclude musical performances (Dipert 1993), belief systems\n(Hilpinen 1995), actions and languages (Evnine 2016), software (Irmak\n2012), normativity (Frug\u00e9 2022), establishments such as\nrestaurants (Korman 2020), and artifact types (Reicher\n2022). \n\nFinally, this definition is peculiar to philosophers (Hilpinen 2011;\nDipert 2014). In other disciplines the concern is more to investigate\ncognition and behavior involving objects quite generally, without\ncarving out a domain of artifacts having special ontological status.\nPsychologists, for instance, are interested in how children develop\ncategorizations of things, including artifacts as opposed to\nnon-artifacts. But there is some evidence that notions of intention or\nfunction enter into this development only at quite a late stage, and\nthat young children make relevant distinctions more on the basis of\nperceptual features such as shape or movement patterns (Keil, Greif,\n& Kerner 2007). Thus the standard philosophical definition of\n\u201cartifact\u201d might well be more of a hindrance than a help\nin the context of such investigations. Archaeologists and\nanthropologists, on the other hand, are concerned with the roles\nobjects play in cultural processes quite generally. From this point of\nview, a discarded flint chip is just as important as the hide scraper\nfrom which it was struck, because debitage analysis\u2014the study of\nsuch chips and other production debris\u2014is invaluable for\nreconstructing knapping techniques and other aspects of production\nprocesses, including their cognitive underpinnings (Shott 2015; Schick\n& Toth 1993). Similarly, a sharp-edged shell used without\nmodification as a hide scraper is just as important as the\npurpose-made flint scraper for understanding the culture in question.\nIn these disciplines \u201cartifact\u201d tends to be absorbed into\n\u201cmaterial culture\u201d\u2014a much broader category\u2014and\nis usually understood to include anything made and/or used by\nhumans (Preston 2013; Kipfer 2007). As the examples above demonstrate,\nthe making need not be intentional and the use need not involve\nmodification of the object used. And if any objects of cultural\nsignificance are devoid of purpose or function, that condition of the\nphilosophical definition, too, would fall by the wayside.\nConsequently, as the anthropologist Daniel Miller notes:\n\n\nThere is little point in attempting to distinguish systematically\nbetween a natural world and an artefactual one, except when we are\nconcerned with the ways in which terms such as \u201cnatural\u201d\nmay have particular consequences or entailments, as when a commodity\nin the shops is labelled \u201cnatural\u201d simply because a single\ningredient, such as a chemical dye, has been deleted, or when\nsomething as apparently natural as radiation is taken to be\nantithetical to true \u201cnature\u201d. (Miller 1994, 398)\n\n\nFrom the perspective of other disciplines, then, the philosophical\ninsistence on a strict definition of \u201cartifact\u201d aimed at a\nbright-line distinction between naturally occurring objects and\nartifacts may well appear parochial.\n\nThis extra-disciplinary observation points us directly to the central\nproblem for the standard philosophical definition of\n\u201cartifact\u201d. Along all three definitional dimensions we\nencounter a continuum of cases (Koslicki 2018; Grandy 2007;\nSperber 2007). Paths, for example, are often created unintentionally\njust in virtue of people repeatedly traveling along the same straight\nline between points A and B\u2014your kitchen and\nyour vegetable garden, say. But what is the point of saying that such\na path is not an artifact, whereas an identical one that was created\nintentionally by exactly the same process is? Moreover, what would it\ntake to make the erstwhile non-artifactual path into an artifact?\nWould it be enough to notice and approve it? Or would I have to\nintentionally maintain it, by sweeping it clean of leaves, for\ninstance?\n\nSimilar difficulties arise with regard to modification, which is\nclearly a matter of degree. If I bring an attractive shell home from a\nwalk on the beach and put it to use as a paperweight, does the\ntransport count as modification? If not, would washing the shell\nbefore using it be enough? Or polishing it to bring out the color of\nits markings? A further complication is that many uses to which\nnaturally occurring objects are put cause modifications. An unmodified\nstone used as a hammer soon acquires a spherical shape (Schick &\nToth 1993, 130 ff.). At what point did it first count as\nmodified, since even the first strike would break off some fragments?\nOr do these use-induced modifications not count for satisfying the\ndefinition at all? If not, why not? The stone is certainly being used\nintentionally for a purpose, so the rest of the definition is\nsatisfied.\n\nFinally, Dan Sperber (2007) argues that even function is continuous\nbetween nature and culture. He begins with the observation that what\nhe calls biological artifacts\u2014domesticated plants and animals,\nfor the most part\u2014have both biological and cultural functions.\nBut they carry out their cultural functions in virtue of carrying out\ntheir biological functions, and vice versa. Take seedless\ngrapes. Their seedlessness might seem to make them purely artifactual,\nsince the reproductive function of the fruit appears to be lost along\nwith the seeds. But in fact, Sperber argues, the fruit retains the\nbiological function of attracting us to eat the fruit and then spread\nthe plant\u2014not by dispersing seeds, as with seeded grapes, but by\npropagating the grapevines vegetatively. This coincidence of\nbiological and cultural functions in domesticates shows that far from\nbeing the locus of a divide between nature and culture, the realm of\ndomestication is the locus of their imperceptible merger.\n\nSperber concludes that \u201cartifact\u201d as a theoretical term\ncannot be usefully defined, as any attempt to do so will be\nfrustrated by the continua detailed above. We may call this the\ncontinuum problem. This concern is echoed by Kathrin Koslicki (2018),\nwho notes that the common reliance on creators\u2019 intentional activity\nto distinguish artifacts from naturally occurring objects inevitably\nleaves us with objects such as unintended by-products and naturally\noccurring objects pressed into service for human purposes which\ndo not seem to fall readily into either category. She does not\nthink that current approaches in metaphysics have the resources\nto deal with such puzzles about artifacts, and concludes that further\ndevelopment of these approaches is necessary. For\nSperber\u2014whose training is in anthropology\u2014the lesson is\nthat the social sciences simply do not need \u201cartifact\u201d as\na term of art. But philosophers, and some other social scientists,\nhave reacted to the continuum problem by doubling down on their\nclassification efforts. Risto Hilpinen (2011), following the\nanthropologist Wendell Oswalt (1973; 1976), uses the term\n\u201cnaturefact\u201d for naturally occurring objects used\nintentionally, but without modification, for some purpose. Naturefacts\nthus lie between naturally occurring objects and artifacts on the\ncontinuum. Hilpinen also suggests that what he calls\n\u201cresidue\u201d\u2014modified but unintended by-products of\nproductive activity, such as sawdust\u2014are a conceptually distinct\ncategory of objects also lying somewhere between artifacts and\nnaturally occurring objects. (A terminological note: in archaeology,\n\u201cnaturefact\u201d is more usually used to mean an object that\nis in fact the result of purely natural processes, but is difficult to\ndistinguish from an intentionally modified object. This is a problem\nthat bedevils paleoarchaeologists studying stone tools, in particular\n(Schnurrenberger & Bryan 1985). Archaeologists also\nsometimes distinguish artifacts from ecofacts\u2014organic or\ninorganic remains of archaeological significance that have undergone\nno, or minimal, modification by humans, such as animal bones, stored\ngrain, pollen, charcoal, and the like. Naturefacts and residues in\nHilpinen\u2019s sense are usually included in the ecofact\ncategory.)\n\nRandall Dipert (1993) proposes a slightly different, triadic\nclassification.\n\nInstruments\u2014naturally occurring objects that have been\nintentionally used for a purpose, but not modified, such as stones\nused as hammers.\nTools\u2014intentionally modified instruments, such as stones\nshaped and polished for use as hammers.\nArtifacts\u2014tools intended to be recognized as tools, such as\nclaw hammers made from standard materials and with a standardized,\neasily recognizable shape.\n\n\nThis continuum problem for artifacts is really just a version of a\nwell-known problem besetting classification schemes in the natural and\nsocial sciences. The traditional assumption was that classification is\nan exclusively ontological operation. What we are doing, it is often\nsaid, is carving the world at its joints. On this assumption, a\ncontinuum is a problem because it suggests that there are no joints to\nguide our carving efforts. A continuum is thus incompatible with\nclassification schemes understood as grounded solely in objective\nfeatures of the world, and with essentialist understandings of natural\nkinds. We can, of course, carve the continuum up any way we like, but\nthis must be understood as in part a pragmatic operation, not a\nstrictly ontological one reflecting only the fixed essences of things.\nThis problem has loomed large in discussions of natural kinds in\nphilosophy of science, as bothersome continua are increasingly\nidentified in both natural and social sciences. Muhammad Khalidi\n(2013, Chapter 5) details cases in the chemical, biological,\nphysiological and social sciences where widely accepted kinds are\n\u201cfuzzy\u201d, or have graded membership, for instance. In\nresponse, he advocates an account of natural kinds that incorporates\nthe influence of human interests and epistemic concerns, while still\ninsisting that these interests and concerns are constrained by\nobjective features of the world identifiable by science.\nKhalidi\u2019s account joins a growing list of non-essentialist\naccounts of natural kinds, according to which kinds are real, but\ntheir reality does not require that they be defined in total isolation\nfrom human beings, their activities, interests, epistemic projects,\npragmatic concerns, and so on (Dupr\u00e9 1993; Boyd 1999; Reydon\n2014; Kendig 2016).\n\nUnderstood in this way, classification schemes such as those proposed\nby Hilpinen and Dipert could, in principle, constitute a perfectly\nadequate response to the continuum problem. It would, of course, be\nnice to have a commonly accepted scheme in philosophy\u2014or better\nyet, a scheme shared with the other disciplines that study artifacts\nand material culture. But even failing that, classification schemes\ngrounded in clear methodological considerations would be helpful, even\nif the methodological considerations varied from scheme to scheme.\nUnfortunately, it appears that the main consideration driving the\nschemes proposed so far is merely the desire to shore up the\ntraditional ontological distinction between artifacts and naturally\noccurring objects. This leaves the methodological challenge voiced by\nSperber and Miller unanswered. What do we need this distinction for?\nDoes it help us understand how objects function in human life and\nculture, or does it actually hinder this understanding? If the latter,\nwould other distinctions serve us better? The continuum problem does\nnot, pace Sperber, prove that there are no good\nmethodological considerations in favor of maintaining the ontological\ndivide between artifacts and naturally occurring objects. But in light\nof the \u201cepistemological\u201d (Reydon 2014) or\n\u201cpractice\u201d (Kendig 2016) turn in the recent literature on\nnatural kinds, it does show that we cannot assume that\n\u201cartifact\u201d itself is a pure, natural kind, identifiable on\nontological grounds alone. In short, there is no guarantee that the\nstandard definition of \u201cartifact\u201d with which we started\nthis section expresses anything like a traditional essence. We are\nthus left with more questions than answers in the matter of\ndefinition.\n2. Metaphysics\n\nDiscussions of the metaphysics of artifacts have typically\narisen only in broader investigative contexts in which they are\nnot the primary focus of attention. In particular, the metaphysics of\nordinary objects has generated a significant literature in recent\nyears, and the puzzles about existence around which it revolves do\napply to artifacts, but equally to the vast array of other ordinary\nobjects, like stones, stars, trees, jellyfish and deer. Similarly,\nreflection on artifact kinds has been largely overshadowed by the vast\nliterature on natural kinds, and discussions of artifact function\nexist on the periphery of the much more prominent discussions of\nbiological function. Finally, questions about the existence of\nabstract artifacts have arisen in the context of investigations into\nthe ontology of works of art. We will take up these topics in\nturn.\n2.1 Do Artifacts Exist?\n\nSkepticism about the existence of artifacts goes back at least to\nAristotle. For him, the primary existents are\nsubstances\u2014independent things on which all other things depend.\nIndividual things, such as horses or houses, are compounds of matter\nand form, but it is not entirely clear whether the substance of the\nthing is the form, the matter, or the compound (Shields 2022). That\nsaid, Aristotle is clearly ambivalent as to whether artifacts have\nwhat it takes. In the Physics (192b8\u201339), for instance,\nhe says that some things, such as chipmunks or geraniums, exist by\nnature and that each such thing is a substance. He follows this up in\nthe Metaphysics (1043b15\u201325), saying that perhaps\nonly such things as exist by nature are substances, thus\nimplying that things made by art, such as pots or pincushions, are\nnot. Exactly why Aristotle thinks artifacts are not substances is not\nentirely clear\u2014he suggests different reasons in different places\n(Katayama 1999, 18\u201319). But it is clear that he doubts that\nthey really exist in the full sense enjoyed by things that exist by\nnature.\n\nAristotle\u2019s invidious ontological downgrading of artifacts fed\nstraight into 20th century trends in metaphysics that\ntended to downgrade ordinary objects in general (Thomasson 2009). Even\nafter the baleful anti-metaphysical influence of logical positivism\nwaned, metaphysics took itself to be merely working out the details of\nwhat the dominant scientific theories, particularly in physics and\nbiology, say exists. Since there is no science of artifacts, let alone\nof sticks and stones and rivers, such ordinary objects had to be\neliminated from our ontologies. On the radical left fringe of the\neliminativist spectrum is a startling long list of theorists who deny\nthe existence of ordinary objects tout court, including even\nliving organisms and persons (for the list, see Korman\n2015, 19\u201323). In the moderate middle are theorists such as\nTrenton Merricks (2001), who denies the existence of artifacts and\nother inanimate macrophysical objects, as well as living organisms,\nwith the exception of humans; Peter van Inwagen (1990), who denies the\nexistence of artifacts and other inanimate macrophysical objects, but\naccepts the existence of living organisms, including humans; and Simon\nEvnine (2016), who denies the existence of inanimate natural objects,\nbut accepts the existence of artifacts and living organisms.\n\nThe arguments for these varieties of eliminativism are themselves\nvarious, but they revolve around what Daniel Korman\n(2015, 4\u20137) calls debunking arguments. Why do we think that\nordinary objects exist? Only because they correspond to our human\nneeds and interests, as embodied in our biology and enshrined in our\ncultural practices. But there is no good reason to think that the\nobjects we pick out in accordance with our needs and interests\ncorrespond to the objects that actually exist in reality. Debunking\narguments go back to the very beginning of Western philosophy.\nParmenides declared that what truly is\u2014Being, or the\nOne\u2014cannot be multiple, changing and transient after the fashion\nof ordinary objects. Plato followed up with the doctrine of the\neternal and unchanging Forms, which truly exist, and of which ordinary\nobjects are at best ontologically deficient copies. Thus the idea that\nwe have no good reason to think that ordinary objects exist is\nentrenched in our metaphysical tradition.\n\nOn the other hand, prima facie grounds for rehabilitating\nordinary objects also have ancient roots in atomism, which holds that\nmacrophysical objects are composed of particles which, while multiple,\ndo meet the other criteria for true being laid down by Parmenides. On\nthe assumption that composition follows regular principles, then,\nordinary objects may be said to exist insofar as they are wholes\ncomposed of existing proper parts. This brings us face to face with\nwhat Peter van Inwagen (1990, 21 ff.) calls the Special\nComposition Question\u2014under what conditions do unified\nwholes arise out of parts? Answering this question has turned out to\nbe far from simple, and has latterly given rise to mereology, a\nspecial area of metaphysics devoted to investigating the principles of\ncomposition. Most of the other main arguments against the existence of\nartifacts and other ordinary objects reflect problems arising in the\ncourse of these investigations. For example, there is the material\nconstitution problem. An artifact such as a cookie is made out of\ndough. So everywhere there is a cookie there is a coincident lump of\n(baked) dough, which shares all of its parts with the cookie. But this\ncoincidence violates our intuitions about the identity of ordinary\nobjects. Considerations of this sort have been used by van Inwagen\n(1990, 124 ff.) and others to argue that there are no artifacts.\nCookie makers do not bring anything new into existence; they merely\nmove pre-existing elementary things around. Thus, while debunking\narguments show that we have no good reason to believe ordinary objects\ndo exist, mereological problems show that we have good\nreasons to believe they do not.\n\nA growing chorus of voices has been raised against this ontological\ndowngrading of ordinary objects, several of whom have been especially\nconcerned to rehabilitate artifacts. Lynne Rudder Baker\u2019s\nMetaphysics of Everyday Life (2007) foregrounds artifacts as\nparadigmatic examples of existing ordinary objects. Baker subscribes\nto a constitution view, according to which material things are\nnon-reductively made up of other material things.\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of constitution is this: when a thing of one\nprimary kind is in certain circumstances, a thing of another primary\nkind\u2014a new thing, with new causal powers\u2014comes to exist.\nWhen an octagonal piece of metal is in circumstances of being painted\nred with white marks of the shape S-T-O-P, and is in an environment\nthat has certain conventions and laws, a new thing\u2014a traffic\nsign\u2014comes into existence. (Baker 2007, 32)\n\n\nImportantly, for Baker artifacts are intention-dependent (ID)\nobjects\u2014they cannot exist in the absence of beings with relevant\nintentional states. Thus the cosmic ray striking a sheet of scrap\nmetal in the proverbial swamp and turning it red with white lettering\nhas not created any artifact at all, let alone a stop sign. Baker\nbuilds the intentional states into the specification of the required\ncircumstances in terms of a relationship between the construction\nmaterials and the intentions and knowledge of the constructor. For a\nstop sign to exist, for example, it must be constructed from metal and\npaint by someone who understands the function of stop signs, knows how\nto construct one, intends to construct one to fulfill this function,\nand is reasonably successful in executing her intentions\n(2007, 53\u201355). This view puts Baker at odds with\nAristotle\u2019s view that only things with an internal principle of\nmovement truly exist, as well as with the common view that ID objects\ndo not truly exist. Both of these views are aimed at first\ndistinguishing natural from artificial objects and then downgrading\nthe latter. Baker argues that the distinction itself is suspect, both\nin light of technologies such as genetic engineering and the natural\nstatus of the beings with intentional states who create artifacts\n(2007, 59\u201366). In short, the whole process of making\nartifacts is internal to nature and cannot be legitimately considered\nseparate from it by those inclined to be judgmental in ontological\nmatters.\n\nSimon Evnine (2016) argues for a version of hylomorphism that is very\nsimilar to the constitution view espoused by Baker. Evnine abandons\ntraditional notions of form and focuses instead on the intertwining of\nthe causes that bring a thing into existence and make it the thing it\nis. Artifacts thus take pride of place in his metaphysics, because, he\nclaims, they typically have a specifiable origin in the intentions of\na maker who chooses material and works it up in accordance with an\nenvisioned function and shape. Evnine\u2019s account of organisms as\nexistents rests on an analogy between this paradigmatic intentional\nmaking and organic development. But he does not try to account for\nnon-living natural objects, whose existence he denies. On the other\nhand, Evnine deploys his account of artifacts in an interesting way to\nargue that actions are artifacts\u2014artifactual events rather than\nartifactual objects. Higher-level actions such as turning on a light\nare governed by the agent\u2019s intention and constructed ultimately\nout of the \u201cmatter\u201d of basic, bodily actions.\n\nAmie Thomasson (2007a; and for a succinct summary, 2009) takes a\ndifferent tack, arguing that the existence of artifacts and other\nordinary objects is established by the connection between our terms on\nthe one hand, and facts about the world on the other. On her view, the\nmeaning of our terms includes a specification of the conditions for\ntheir application. If we then determine empirically that the\napplication conditions of a term are met, the thing to which it refers\nexists. For example, \u201cspoon\u201d refers to a utensil\nintentionally made by humans for the purposes of stirring, serving and\neating food, consisting of a shallow bowl with a long handle. A quick\ncheck of any kitchen will assure you that these conditions are in fact\nsatisfied, and that spoons therefore exist. On the other hand,\n\u201cdevil\u2019s tuning fork\u201d refers to an implement\nconsisting of three cylindrical prongs on one end and two rectangular\nprongs on the other, intentionally made by devils for the purpose of\ntuning their instruments, one would suppose. Check the music studios\nand the concert halls as thoroughly as you like, you will not find\nthese conditions satisfied. So devil\u2019s tuning forks do not\nexist. Thomasson\u2019s approach does not privilege artifacts as\nparadigmatic existents the way Baker\u2019s and Evnine\u2019s\naccounts do. But she makes the intention-dependent status of artifacts\nequally comprehensible, since the intentional states of makers figure\nprominently in the application conditions of concepts.\n2.2 Artifact Kinds\n\nIf artifacts do not exist, then the kinds into which we classify\nthem\u2014pillow, book, painting, flowerpot\u2014are not real kinds\non a par with natural kinds, such as oak, owl or anole. But questions\nabout the reality and nature of artifact kinds also arise for those\nwho do take artifacts to exist. As we have seen, these theorists\nresist the objection that the mind-dependence of artifacts compromises\ntheir ontological status. But this objection resurfaces with regard to\nartifact kinds. The mind-dependence of artifacts implies, at a\nminimum, that an account of artifact kinds will be very different from\nan account of natural kinds. This implication is resisted by Crawford\nElder (2004; 2007), who seeks to establish the existence of\nartifacts on the basis of a realist account of kinds. On Elder\u2019s\nview, artifact kinds and many natural kinds are equally copied kinds,\nand equally mind-independent. A copied kind is defined by a set of\nproperties that naturally cluster together\u2014a distinctive shape\nor make-up, a proper function established by a mechanism that copies\nthings of that shape on the basis of successful performance, and a\nhistorically proper placement. For example, cats\u2019 whiskers are\ndistinctively shaped organs that are copied from cat to cat by a\nbiologically based reproductive mechanism because they help cats get\naround in the dark by performing successfully as touch receptors\nstrategically located with respect to the cat\u2019s other bodily\nparts. Similarly, floor lamps are distinctively shaped artifacts that\nare copied from household to household by a socially based\nreproductive mechanism because they help humans get around in the dark\nby performing successfully as light sources strategically located with\nrespect to other household furniture. Human intentional states do, of\ncourse, figure in the copying process for artifacts. However, Elder\nargues:\n\n\n[C]reation does not begin with the artisan\u2019s intending what he\ndoes. Rather, the essential properties that his product will inherit\nstem from a history of function and of copying that began well before\nthe artisan undertook his work. This history reaches forward through\nthe artisan\u2019s motions\u2014it shapes his shaping. Its existence\nand its efficacy are independent, largely or even entirely, of the\nartisan\u2019s will. (Elder 2004, 142\u2013143)\n\n\nAll copied kinds are thus natural, mind-independent kinds whose\nclustered features we discover rather than invent.\n\nOne acknowledged problem with Elder\u2019s account is that many\nerstwhile artifact kinds turn out not to be copied kinds. Neckties,\nfor example, do not qualify because they do not appear to have a\nproper function (Elder 2004, 158\u2013159). But his account does\nhave the virtue of drawing out useful analogies between natural kinds\nand artifact kinds. A number of other accounts also focus on analogies\nbetween (at least some) natural kinds and (at least some) artifact\nkinds (Lowe 2014; Franssen & Kroes 2014). The underlying motive\nfor pushing this analogy, clearly, is the fear that artifact kinds are\nnot real if human intentional states and/or classificatory practices\nare constitutive of what kinds there are.\n\nAmie Thomasson does not share this fear. In a series of important\npapers (2003; 2007b; 2014), she points out that realists\nabout kinds are not, in fact, forced to choose between showing that\nartifact kinds can be understood on the mind-independent model of\nnatural kinds, or denying that artifact kinds are real. There is a\nthird option\u2014denying that mind-independence is the touchstone of\nreality. Thomasson then builds human intentions and their historical\nconnections into her account of artifact kinds.\n\n\nNecessarily, for all x and all artifactual kinds K,\nx is a K only if x is the product of a\nlargely successful intention that (Kx), where one intends\n(Kx) only if one has a substantive concept of the nature of\nKs that largely matches that of some group of prior makers of\nKs (if there are any) and intends to realize that concept by\nimposing K-relevant features on the object. (Thomasson\n2003, 600)\n\n\nThus for Thomasson, human intentions and concepts are actually\nconstitutive of artifact kinds. Thomasson (2014) also objects to the\ncommon assumption that concepts of artifact kinds revolve exclusively\naround intended function. While it is true that in\nEnglish we often label artifact kinds in accordance with\nfunction\u2014flashlight, bedspread, pincushion, frying pan, and so\non\u2014artifacts actually have an array of features that figure in\ntheir concepts. These include structural or perceptible features, for\nexample, that are also often reflected in our terms\u2014armchair,\ntripod, zebra crossing (definitely not a function designation!), fork,\nand so on. Most importantly for Thomasson, they also include normative\nfeatures concerned with how that kind of artifact is to be treated or\nregarded. Although sponges and paper towels can both be used to wipe\nup spills, it is normal to dispose of the paper towel, but to clean\nthe sponge and reuse it.\n\nA distinct approach to artifact kinds is proposed by Thomas Reydon\n(2014). He points out that the nature of natural kinds is currently in\nplay in philosophy of science. Their mind-independence is\ntraditionally predicated on their having essences. But essentialism\nran into trouble when Darwin showed that species\u2014up to that\npoint the very paradigm of natural kinds\u2014are historically fluid\nand have no clear boundaries. Similar problems have now been\nrecognized even in the kinds of chemistry and physics (Khalidi 2013).\nNevertheless, grouping natural objects into kinds does license useful\ninferences and ground successful explanations. This has led to what\nReydon calls an \u201cepistemological turn\u201d.\n\n\nThe principal criteria for being a natural kind used to be\nmetaphysical: a kind is a natural kind if and only if it really exists\nin the world\u2026independently of human consciousness, human\ninterests, and human practices, and is associated with a particular\nkind essence\u2026. On the alternative approach the principal\ncriteria for being a natural kind no longer are metaphysical but\nepistemological: what counts is being useful in human\nepistemic practices, such as inference and explanation, by\ncorresponding in some way (which is still to be explicated)\nto the state of affairs in nature. (Reydon 2014, 132)\n\n\nRather than assimilating artifact kinds to natural kinds by showing\nthat artifacts are actually mind-independent in some way, as Elder and\nothers have tried to do, the epistemological turn suggests that since\nnatural kinds were never mind-independent to begin with, there is in\nprinciple no barrier to a unified account of artifact and natural\nkinds.\n\nFinally, we should note that questions have been raised about the\nlegitimacy of the kind\u2014or perhaps more precisely, the\ncategory\u2014\u201cartifact\u201d itself. We have already touched\non this in\n Section 1\n above, in the context of the definitional issues raised by the\ncontinuum problem. This discussion clearly reflects Reydon\u2019s\nepistemological turn in that it foregrounds methodological\nconsiderations and lets the ontological chips fall where they may. We\nwill discuss methodological issues in\n Section 3.\n2.3 Artifact Functions\n\nFunction is a salient feature of artifacts. Clearly there would be no\ngood reason to keep so many of them around unless they did something\nfor us. Function is also a salient feature of biological traits.\nAccounts of biological function, which now comprise a large\nliterature, have inspired many accounts of artifact function. But\nunlike organisms, artifacts are made to serve human purposes, so human\nintentional states must be considered. Accounts of artifact function\ncan be usefully categorized in terms of the role they give to\nintentions in the establishment of functions (Preston 2009; Houkes\n& Vermaas 2010). At one end of the spectrum are accounts that\nrevolve around human intentions, while at the other end are accounts\nthat focus on non-intentional factors; in between are a variety of\naccounts that mix intentional and non-intentional factors in various\nproportions.\n\nKaren Neander (1991) distinguishes artifact function sharply from\nbiological function. Natural selection acting over the long course of\nevolutionary history establishes specific effects of biological traits\nas their functions, in virtue of the reproduction of those traits for\nthose effects. For example, the wings of birds are the result of eons\nof selection for their effect as airfoils. In contrast, intentional\nhuman selection, acting with knowledge and foresight, establishes\nspecific effects of artifacts as their functions immediately, without\nany reference to a history of reproduction for those effects.\n\n\nIt is enough, in the case of intentional selection, if the designer\nbelieves or hopes that the artifact will have the desired effect and\nselects it for that purpose. (Neander 1991, 462)\n\n\nFor example, an individual who designs a hammer, or who uses the heel\nof her shoe to pound in a nail, believing these items to have the\ncapacity to deliver a hard blow and intending to use that effect for\nher purposes, endows them with the relevant function forthwith. John\nSearle (1995) calls such artifact functions \u201cagentive\u201d\nfunctions to distinguish them from the \u201cnon-agentive\u201d\nfunctions of biological traits. Searle also distinguishes a special\nsub-category of agentive functions which he terms \u201cstatus\u201d\nfunctions. These are related in a relatively arbitrary way to the\nphysical structure of the artifact. Money, for example, runs the gamut\nfrom gold ingots to bitcoin. Its functions\u2014medium of exchange,\nmeasure of value, and so on\u2014are imposed on these physical\nbearers by our collective acceptance of them as money. According to\nSearle, the intentional states constituting this collective acceptance\ncreate an \u201cinstitutional fact\u201d that would not exist\nwithout collective human agency. Status functions thus illustrate not\nonly the creative capacity of human intentionality already\nforegrounded in Neander\u2019s account, but also its typically\ncollective nature in the case of artifact function. Searle supplies an\naccount of collective intentionality to underwrite this feature. Other\nauthors who subscribe to intentionalist theories of artifact function\ninclude Randall Dipert (1993), Peter McLaughlin (2001), Lynne Rudder\nBaker (2007), and Simon Evnine (2016).\n\nRuth Millikan (1984) offers a general theory of function that, in the\ncase of artifacts, mixes intentional and non-intentional elements. Her\nmain interest is in proper functions\u2014what a biological trait or\nartifact is supposed to do, and is malfunctioning if it cannot do. On\nMillikan\u2019s view, what she calls direct proper functions, whether\nbiological or artifactual, are established by a history of selection\nand reproduction for the effect constituting the function. So what is\nessential for the establishment of an artifact\u2019s function is\nwhether or not its ancestors\u2014artifacts of that kind\u2014were\nreproduced for that effect. This is what the artifact is supposed to\ndo, even if it is not able to do it because of damage or an\nunfavorable environment. Thus far Millikan\u2019s account is\nnon-intentional, for the role of human intentional states is merely\none factor in the implementation of the reproduction process. However,\nthe other half of Millikan\u2019s account concerns what she calls\nderived proper functions. These are functions that are established by\nsomething that has the direct proper function of producing something\nelse to accomplish a purpose. Millikan\u2019s favored example of\nbiological derived proper function is a novel shade of brown sported\nby a chameleon. It has no history of selection and reproduction for\nthe effect of camouflaging the chameleon, and yet we want to say that\nthat is its proper function. And we can say so, according to Millikan,\nbecause the color-alteration mechanism possessed by chameleons has the\ndirect proper function of changing chameleons\u2019 skin color to\ncamouflage them by matching their surroundings. Thus this novel shade\nof brown does have the derived proper function of\ncamouflaging the chameleon. Derived proper functions in the realm of\nartifacts bring intention back to the fore. On Millikan\u2019s view,\nintentional states have evolutionarily established direct proper\nfunctions. The direct proper function of intentions is to produce\nsomething else to accomplish whatever purpose the intention\nincorporates. Thus, if you intend to produce a can opener, the\nexecution of your intention brings into existence a device having the\nderived proper function of opening cans. Even if this device works in\na completely novel way, and even if it is not capable of performing as\nenvisioned, opening cans is still what it is supposed to do. Usually,\nthe direct and derived proper functions of artifacts coincide\u2014in\nthe case of a standard can opener, for instance, we have both a\nhistory of selection and reproduction and a current intention to\nreproduce yet another can opener. But in the case of novel prototypes,\nespecially, it is intention alone that establishes the (derived)\nproper function.\n\nWybo Houkes and Pieter Vermaas (Houkes & Vermaas 2004; 2010;\nVermaas & Houkes 2003) also have a mixed theory, although\nintentionalist factors predominate, in contrast to Millikan\u2019s\nfocus on non-intentionalist history of reproduction. Their approach is\nto derive a theory of artifact function from a theory of artifact use\nand design.\n\n\nOn our theory, an artifact function is a capacity, supposed or actual,\nwhich has a preferential status in the context of certain actions and\nbeliefs. It is therefore a highly relational property, which\nsupervenes on both the actual physical makeup of an artifact and on\nthe beliefs and actions of human agents, designers as well as users.\n(Houkes & Vermaas 2004, 67)\n\n\nHoukes and Vermaas focus on the use plan formulated by designers as\nestablishing the function of the artifact in the first instance. This\nis the predominant intentionalist element in their account. But on\ntheir view, this use plan must be supported by a justification that\nthe plan will realize the function, and this requires knowledge of the\ncausal roles of the physicochemical capacities of the artifact.\nThrough this required justification the actual physical structure of\nthe artifact constrains the intentions articulated in the use plan.\nThis is a non-intentionalist element. In addition, they require a\nhistorical element in the form of the communication of the use plan\nfrom designer to user and subsequently from user to user. They refer\nto this element as \u201cevolutionary\u201d, in an apparent\nreference to cultural evolution, but clearly this element, too, is\nprimarily intentional since the evolution is carried out in a series\nof intentional communications. Houkes and Vermaas refer to their\ntheory as the ICE (Intention, Causal role, Evolution) theory of\nartifact function. Other mixed theories include those of Paul\nGriffiths (1993) and Philip Kitcher (1993).\n\nAt the lonelier, non-intentionalist end of the spectrum is Beth\nPreston\u2019s (1998; 2013) account. Her initial concern is to\nadvance a pluralist theory of artifact function according to which\nartifacts have both proper functions and what Preston calls system\nfunctions. For example, the proper function of plates is to hold food\nfor serving or eating. But they function equally well as saucers for\npotted plants, or in a stack to weight down tofu or eggplant slices to\nextract the moisture. For proper function, Preston relies on\nMillikan\u2019s account of direct proper function, but without the\nadded element of derived proper function that brings intention back\nin. For system function, she relies on Robert Cummins\u2019 (1975)\ntheory of biological function, according to which function is\nestablished by the causal role a component plays in a system. Neither\nMillikan\u2019s nor Cummins\u2019 account is intrinsically\nintentionalist, since they are designed to fit both the biological and\nthe artifactual cases. Preston resists reformulating them in\nintentionalist terms, while acknowledging that in the artifact case\nhuman intentions and other intentional states do play a role in\nimplementing the history of selective reproduction and the system\ncontext, respectively. In support of this resolutely\nnon-intentionalist stance, Preston argues that human intentions do not\narise in a vacuum, but are reproduced in and through the process by\nwhich material culture, with its myriad of functional artifacts, is\nreproduced. Intentions to make plates are reproduced in plate cultures\nas surely as the plates themselves; and only in cultures with both\npotted plants and plates can intentions to use plates as pot\nsaucers form.\n\n\nThe only viable view is one that sees human purposes and the proper\nfunctions of items of material culture indissolubly linked in patterns\nof use and reproduction. Thus, it no longer seems reasonable to ask\nwhich came first, the purpose or the proper function. Both are\nproduced and reproduced through the self-same social process. (Preston\n2013, 206)\n\n\nPreston is joined here by Crawford Elder (2004), whose account of\ncopied kinds, as we noted above, similarly characterizes human\nintentions as themselves dependent on the copying process rather than\ninitiating and controlling it.\n\nThe theories discussed in this section encounter a number of important\nproblems in accounting for function phenomena in the artifact realm.\nOne such problematic phenomenon is the distinction between proper and\nnon-proper functions. This does occur in the biological\nrealm\u2014pigeon beaks did not evolve to peck buttons for a food\nreward, for example\u2014but it is relatively rare. In material\nculture, it is ubiquitous. Humans are just very good at adopting\nwhatever artifact will accomplish their purposes, regardless of its\nproper function. Stop a random person in the street and ask\u2014she\nwill have a story. Intentionalist approaches have more difficulty\nmaking this distinction, because for these views human intentions are\nthe only mechanism for establishing functions, and this elides the\ndistinction unless some difference can be discerned in the intentions\nthemselves. Authors who have discussed this issue recently include\nWybo Houkes and Pieter Vermaas (2010), Beth Preston (2013) and Simon\nEvnine (2016). Another problem is accounting for malfunction. Just as\nany theory of representation must account for misrepresentation, any\ntheory of function must say something about cases of failure to\nperform, and whether or not that failure is a malfunction or something\nelse. Addressing this issue depends to some extent on the distinction\nbetween proper and non-proper functions, because malfunction only\nseems an appropriate designation in the case of failure to perform a\nproper function\u2014failure to do what the artifact is supposed to\ndo, in other words. This issue is especially important for the\nphilosophy of technology and engineering side of the artifact debates,\nwhere understanding the epistemology of problem solving and innovation\ndepends in part on understanding failure to function and how to learn\nfrom and deal with it. Authors who have covered this issue include\nNeander (1995), Baker (2007), Franssen (2006; 2009), Houkes and\nVermaas (2010) and Kroes (2012).\n\nA third problem is how to account for the functions\u2014if\nany\u2014of novel prototypes. Non-intentional accounts have more\ndifficulty in this case, for a truly novel prototype has no history of\nselection and reproduction; and if it does not work, as many\nprototypes in fact do not, then function established in terms of\nsystemic causal role or physicochemical capacities is not possible\neither. This problem is one of the main motivations for\nMillikan\u2019s (1984) introduction of derived proper function, since\ndesigner intention seems to be the only way unsuccessful novel\nprototypes could acquire any kind of function at all. The\nnon-intentionalist then is caught between biting the\nbullet\u2014unsuccessful novel prototypes just do not have\nfunctions\u2014or introducing an ad hoc intentionalist\nelement. This issue has been canvassed by Preston\n(1998; 2003; 2013), Millikan (1999), Vermaas and Houkes\n(2003) and Kroes (2012). A related problem is how to account for\nso-called phantom functions (Preston 2013)\u2014the functions of\nartifacts that are constitutionally incapable of ever fulfilling them.\nTalismans to ensure fertility, for example, are now widely believed in\nWestern culture to have no efficacy, but it is difficult to escape the\nintuition that ensuring fertility is nevertheless their proper\nfunction. Here again, it is the non-intentionalist who is caught\nflatfooted. Although artifacts like fertility talismans are indeed\nreproduced for a purpose, the standard requirement for establishing\nproper function is that the artifact be selected for reproduction on\nthe basis of successful performance. Similarly, function established\nby systemic causal role requires that the artifact actually perform\nthe relevant causal role. Worse yet, the option of just biting the\nbullet and agreeing that such artifacts have no functions is nowhere\nnear as plausible as in the case of unsuccessful novel prototypes\nbecause of the prevalence of talismans, amulets, religious artifacts,\ninefficacious medicines and supplements, and the like. Authors who\nhave addressed this issue include Griffiths (1993), Preston\n(1998; 2013), Thomasson (2009), Parsons (2016) and Holm\n(2017).\n2.4 Abstract Artifacts\n\nMany works of art are typical artifacts, ontologically no more or less\nmysterious than hats or hacksaws. Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a\nPearl Earring has extraordinary aesthetic qualities, but\notherwise it is just a concrete, spatiotemporal object, created by\nsomeone and straightforwardly subject to change and destruction. Not\nso with Amy Beach\u2019s Gaelic Symphony, which we hesitate\nto identify with its performances, singly or collectively, and which\ntherefore does not appear to be located in time and space. However, it\ndoes purport to have a creator, and may perhaps be destroyed if all\ntraces of its performances and scores are wiped away. A symphony is a\nso-called repeatable work of art, that is, a work with multiple\ninstances. Performance arts of all kinds fall into this category, but\nso do cast sculptures, limited edition prints, art photographs, films,\nand the like. So understanding the ontology of repeatable works is a\ncentral task for philosophy of art.\n\nThe initial difficulty is that such works do not fit neatly into the\nstandard ontological bifurcation between concrete, spatiotemporal\nobjects such as hats and hacksaws and abstract, eternal objects such\nas numbers and sets. Like concrete objects, but unlike abstract\nobjects, repeatable works of art appear to be created and may change\nor be destroyed. Unlike concrete objects, but like abstract objects,\nthey do not appear to be located in space and time. Amie Thomasson\n(1999; 2004; 2006) sought to resolve this difficulty by proposing an\nintermediate ontological category of abstract artifacts\u2014abstract\nin that they are not located in space and time; artifactual in that\nthey are intentionally created and can be destroyed. Thomasson\noriginally proposed this new category as part of her theory of\nfictional characters, but she noted its usefulness to the analysis of\nthe literary works those characters inhabit, repeatable works of art\nin general, and perhaps other social objects as well. (For application\nto repeatable works of art, see the essays in Art and Abstract\nObjects (Mag Uidhir 2012). Applications to other social objects\ninclude software (Irmak 2012), establishments (Korman 2020), and\nnormativity (Frug\u00e9 2022).)\n\nHowever, further difficulties beset the positing of abstract\nartifacts. It is commonly thought that abstract objects are not just\nnon-spatiotemporal, but non-causal. Our causal commerce is with their\ninstances, not with the abstract objects themselves. But this makes it\nhard to understand how abstract objects could possibly be created.\nErik Satie could certainly create an instance of his\nGymnop\u00e9dies by playing it on his piano, but it is\nunclear in what sense he could be the author of this musical work as\nan abstract object separate from its instances. According to Jerrold\nLevinson (1980), the last decades of the 20th century saw a\nnear consensus that musical works are abstract objects of a more\nfamiliar sort\u2014structural types that exist eternally and without\nchange, independent of their instances in the causally governed,\nspatiotemporal realm. A leading objection to this consensus is that\ncomposers cannot then bring their works into existence, contrary to\ncommon sense. So the music ontologist faces a dilemma\u2014give up on\nthe idea that musical works are abstract structural types, or explain\nhow the composer can reasonably be said to create musical works even\nthough the abstract structural types that comprise them are already in\nexistence. This difficulty generalizes to other repeatable types of\nartworks that are held to be abstract objects. But most importantly,\ncharacterizing repeatable artworks as abstract artifacts does not\nallow the ontologist to escape this difficulty. Abstract artifacts do\nnot belong to the causal realm of space and time any more than their\neternal and changeless cousins do. So simply saying that they are\nartifacts, and therefore created and destroyed like all other\nartifacts, does not by itself explain how this creation and\ndestruction is possible.\n\nResponses run the gamut. Julian Dodd (2000) bites the bullet and\nargues that musical works are discovered, not created. Levinson (1980)\nfamously proposes that composers create musical works by selecting\namong and indicating pre-existing abstract sound structures and\npreferred performance means. In western classical music, for example,\nthese indications are embodied in the written score for the work,\nwhich guides the production of instances. However, abstract artifacts,\nby hypothesis, do not pre-exist the creative acts of authors, so they\ncannot be created by Levinson\u2019s selection-and-indication\nprocess. A popular alternative involves the metaphysical relationship\nof existential dependence. On this view, repeatable works of art have\na dependence base, typically consisting of an author\u2019s mental\nand physical acts which bring an initial instance of the work into\nexistence, subsequent copies of that instance that sustain the work,\nand an audience capable of appreciating and interpreting those\ninstances. The work itself is an abstract artifact, dependent on, but\nexisting separately from, these acts and instances. It begins when\nthey begin and ends when they all cease or are destroyed. Nurbay Irmak\n(2021) argues that existential dependence allows for a non-causal type\nof creation. The artist engages in causal relations with concrete\nobjects and by so doing non-causally creates the dependent abstract\nartifact. Lee Walters (2013), on the other hand, argues that some\nabstract objects can enter into causal relationships, so the process\nof creating an existentially dependent abstract artifact might\nconceivably qualify as ordinary causal creation.\n\nThese difficulties have prompted some philosophers to avoid the moves\nthat generate them. An early such attempt is Guy Rohrbaugh\u2019s\n(2003) view that works of art are not abstract objects at all, but\nrather historical individuals\u2014non-physical entities\nontologically dependent on a physical series of historically and\ncausally linked physical objects. For example, a photograph is a\nnon-physical entity dependent on its \u201cembodiments\u201d in a negative\nand subsequent prints. In a more recent proposal, Christy Mag\nUidhir (2013) argues that works of art must have authors, but that\nneither discovery, nor indication of abstract structures, nor\nexistential dependence satisfies the requirements for authorship. He\nconcludes that repeatable works of art cannot be abstract objects of\nany kind, but must rather be ordinary concrete objects. Their apparent\nrepeatability does not mean that they are instances of an abstract\nwork, but only that they bear relevant similarity to one another. In a\nrelated vein, Allan Hazlett (2012) claims that there are no repeatable\nartworks. If there were, he says, they would have to be abstract\nobjects. But abstract objects have all their intrinsic properties\nessentially, whereas artworks typically do not. For example, Alvin\nAiley\u2019s major work, Revelations, premiered as a 10\nsection work lasting an hour, but evolved into a half hour long piece\nin three sections. So, clearly, many of its original properties were\nnot essential to it. Hazlett concludes that apparent repetitions are\nnot instances of an abstract object. They are either separate, similar\nartworks, or copies of an original.\n\nThe discussion of abstract artifacts has been largely confined to the\nontology of art. But as some of the participants have noted (e.g.,\nLevinson 1980, 21\u201322), repeatable works are not confined to\nworks of art. This is particularly clear for named artifacts such as\nChanel No. 5, the Ford F-150, Campbell\u2019s tomato soup, Earl Grey\ntea, the Hepplewhite chair, or the Washington quarter. It is possible\nto see each bottle of Chanel No. 5 or each quarter not as a\ndistinctive artifact in its own right, but as an instance of an\nabstract artifact\u2014Chanel No. 5 tout court, or the\nWashington quarter. Apart from marketing and branding concerns, what\ndoes the naming of such ordinary artifacts accomplish? It highlights\ntheir standardization, and often designates the entity responsible for\nmaintaining it\u2014Ford, in the case of the F-150, for instance. But\nstandardization is a virtually universal feature of human artifacts,\nfrom the Acheulean handaxe to the Apple MacBook Air. There are\nvanishingly few artifacts that are unique in the way non-repeatable\nartworks like paintings are supposed to be. Failed prototypes that\nwere never reproduced might be an example. This means that we are\npotentially swimming in abstract artifacts, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that would entail. This, in turn, highlights views\nopposed to the positing of abstract artifacts, which are more\nplausible in the case of everyday artifacts. We resist thinking of\nperformances of Beach\u2019s Gaelic Symphony as separate,\nrelevantly similar artifacts because we are used to thinking of\nsymphonies as unique, individual works. But the Washington\nquarter does not seem like a work in the same sense, and there is thus\nless reason to resist the idea that individual quarters are just\nrelevantly similar artifacts produced by a copying process managed by\nthe United States Mint. In this regard, we might consider that the\nnotion of the work, functioning as a regulatory concept for the arts,\nis arguably neither universal nor of ancient lineage, even in the\nwestern tradition (Goehr 1993). In short, the time may be ripe\nfor the discussion of abstract artifacts to be expanded to cover\nartifacts in general, perhaps with different outcomes than in its\nnative context.\n3. Epistemology\n\nThe metaphysics of artifacts is a fairly well delineated set of\ndiscussions, carried out by a fairly cohesive group of philosophers.\nIn contrast, the epistemology of artifacts is more interdisciplinary\nin nature, ranging over anthropology, archaeology, cognitive science,\nand psychology, in addition to philosophy. Within philosophy it runs\nthe gamut from environmental philosophy to philosophy of mind.\n Section 3.1\n returns in more detail to the methodological considerations already\nbroached in\n Section 2.2.\n Section 3.2 takes up issues concerning artifacts as objects of\nknowledge. Finally,\n Section 3.3\n covers issues arising in studies of cognition in which artifacts are\npresented as playing significant and sometimes controversial roles in\ncognitive processes themselves.\n3.1 Methodology\n\nReydon\u2019s identification of an epistemological turn in our\nunderstanding of kinds and categories leads to a new question about\nthe category \u201cartifact\u201d. Rather than only asking whether\nit carves the world at a joint, we can also ask: Is it serving our\nepistemic purposes well? A number of authors have argued that\n\u201cartifact\u201d is methodologically counterproductive. Dan\nSperber (2007, 136\u2013137) claims that it is not a useful\ncategory for the purposes of a naturalistic social science.\n\n\nI have tried to cast doubt on the idea that a theoretically useful\nnotion of artifact can be built around its usual prototypes:\nbracelets, jars, hammers, and other inert objects, or that it can be\ndefined in a more systematic way\u2026. There is no good reason why\na naturalistic social science should treat separately, or even give\npride of place to, cultural productions that are both more clearly\nintended for a purpose and more thoroughly designed by humans, that\nis, to prototypical artifacts. (Sperber 2007, 137)\n\n\nSperber\u2019s main argument for this conclusion, as we noted in\n Section 1,\n is based on the continuum problem. But Sperber also suggests that in\nfocusing on paradigmatic artifacts as the basis for our\ncategorization, we are allowing ourselves to be epistemologically\ndisadvantaged by \u201ca doubly obsolete industrial-age revival of a\nPaleolithic categorization\u201d (2007, 136). In the\nPaleolithic, before there were any domesticates other than dogs, the\n(few) technologies people used in their daily lives were\nparadigmatic artifacts\u2014stone tools, baskets, beads, and so on.\nSo, Sperber speculates, we evolved a psychological disposition to\nclassify things in accordance with the predominance of such artifacts.\nWe then retained this disposition right through the Neolithic\ntransition to agriculture 12,000 years ago, which made biological\nartifacts (as Sperber calls domesticates) proportionally the most\ncommon type of artifact in human experience until the Industrial\ntransition of only a couple of centuries ago. This is the first sense\nin which our \u201cartifact\u201d category is obsolete. Second,\nSperber argues, information technology has increasingly contributed to\nour environment artifacts that would have astonished Aristotle with\ntheir ability to act on their own, beyond any intention their creators\nmay have. Simultaneously, biotechnology has made impressing our\nintentions on our biological artifacts increasingly effective. These\ncountervailing trends further reduce the dominance of erstwhile\nparadigmatic artifacts in our lives. This is the second sense in which\nour \u201cartifact\u201d category is obsolete. In short, Sperber\nseems to suggest, if we cannot shake the Paleolithic urge to center\nthe \u201cartifact\u201d category on the paradigmatic bracelets and\njars, we should jettison the category altogether, for the sake of an\nepistemologically adequate social science.\n\nBeth Preston (2013, 4\u20137) declines to use the term\n\u201cartifact\u201d, opting instead for the more open-ended\n\u201cmaterial culture\u201d. The initial problem she identifies is\nthat phenomena of interest from the point of view of human interaction\nwith the environment do not divide naturally into interactions with\nartifacts and interactions with other sorts of things. We noted an\nexample of this in\n Section 1\u2014intentionally\n made paths, which do qualify as artifacts, are used in the same way\nas unintentionally made paths. It thus seems methodologically\nwrongheaded to rule the unintentionally made path out of consideration\non a definitional technicality. Similarly, residues such as sawdust,\nwhey, or fingerprints often enter into human practices in important\nways, but a focus on artifacts as traditionally defined may leave\nthese phenomena out of account as well. Preston also argues that it is\nprecisely the central concepts in a field of investigation that should\nbe left open-ended, on pain of epistemic distortion of the results.\nFor example, defining \u201cmind\u201d very strictly might have\nruled the extended mind debate out in advance.\n\nSteven Vogel (2003; 2015) argues that no good sense can be made\nof the artifact-nature distinction, making it unfit for the purposes\nof environmental philosophy. His argument unrolls against the backdrop\nof a longstanding controversy in environmental philosophy about the\nvalue of ecological restoration\u2014the practice of restoring areas\ndamaged by mining, industrial waste and the like to something as close\nas possible to the condition they were in before the damage was done.\nThe ontological status of such sites has been challenged on the\ngrounds that such restoration does not actually restore nature but\nrather creates an artifact (Katz 1997). Worse yet, this artifact is\npassed off as nature, so it is a fake (Elliot 1997). This casts doubt\non the ethical and political value of ecological restoration as an\nenvironmental practice. Vogel responds by questioning the unspoken\nassumption that environmental philosophy is about nature, and\nenvironmental activism about protecting nature from human activity. He\nargues that nature conceived as pristine and independent in this way\ndoes not exist\u2014certainly not now that human activity is global\nin its effects, as Bill McKibben (1989) noted long ago, but in\nprinciple, since humans, like all other living things, change their\nenvironment simply by living in it. On Vogel\u2019s view,\nenvironmental philosophy is about just that\u2014the environment,\nboth built and not-so-built, and what we should do to ensure that it\nis the environment we want and need, not only for ourselves but for\nother beings as well.\n\nThe important point for our purposes, though, is that Vogel\u2019s\npost-nature environmental philosophy rests on a full-throated\nrejection of the nature-artifact categorization. He begins with the\nclaim that our concepts of nature\u2014already multiple, and not\nalways carefully distinguished\u2014are riddled with\nantinomy-generating ambiguities. The epistemological backwash leaves\nus mired in nostalgia, unable to see and address environmental\nproblems as they actually exist. In particular, we are unable to see\nthat ecological restoration does not produce artifacts by the\ntraditional definition, since restored areas are designed precisely to\nescape our designs and outrun our intentions. They are thus\n\u201cwild\u201d in a perfectly straightforward sense. Furthermore,\nVogel argues, all human productions, including artifacts, are wild in\nthis sense. Rather than focusing on unintentional creations, as\nPreston and Sperber tend to do, Vogel emphasizes the ways in which\nartifacts outrun all our creative intentions.\n\n\nBuilding an artifact requires black boxes all the way down: to\ndesign and build anything requires presupposing a whole set of\nprocesses that one does not design, and whose operation beyond\none\u2019s understanding and intention is necessary for building to\ntake place. There is a gap, in the construction of every\nartifact, between the intention with which the builder acts and the\nconsequences of her acts, a gap that is ineliminable and indeed\nconstitutive of what it is to construct something, and in this gap\nresides something like what I earlier called wildness. (Vogel\n2015, 113)\n\n\nThus the traditional definition of\n\u201cartifact\u201d\u2014something intentionally made for a\npurpose\u2014while true as far as it goes, merely skates over the\nsurface, leaving us at an epistemological disadvantage with regard to\nthe full range and depth of the phenomena.\n3.2 Knowing Artifacts\n\nVogel\u2019s position on environmental ethics resonates in an\ninteresting way with a much earlier dispute about\nreference\u2014specifically, about whether our capacity to refer to\ndifferent kinds of artifacts is grounded in a definite description of\nwhat being a member of that kind requires, or rather in a historical\nconnection to a \u201cbaptismal\u201d event in which someone slapped\na label on something and declared that label henceforth applicable to\nthings of that sort. Hilary Putnam (1975) famously favors the\nbaptismal account for both natural kinds and artifact kinds. Steven\nSchwartz (1978) challenges Putnam\u2019s account in the case of\nartifacts. He agrees with Putnam that the \u201cbaptismal\u201d\naccount is correct for natural kinds, because they have hidden natures\nto which we are not necessarily privy. Thus if we are to refer to\nnatural objects reliably at all, it cannot be by way of definite\ndescription. But artifacts, Schwartz says, have publicly accessible\nnatures based on form and function, so reference to them is grounded\nin description rather than a baptismal event. Amie Thomasson\n(2003; 2007b) carves out a nuanced position based on her view\nthat the intentions and concepts of human makers are constitutive of\nartifact kinds\n (Section 2.2\n above). If so, then some makers are in an epistemically privileged\nposition with regard to given artifacts, and so do refer to them in\nvirtue of having a substantive concept of what being an artifact of\nthat kind involves. Thomasson acknowledges that most speakers are not\nin this epistemically privileged position. Users are not, and even\nmany who qualify as makers in the causal sense\u2014workers on a\nproduction line, for instance\u2014may not be. So Thomasson\u2019s\nview, unlike Schwartz\u2019s, is not a return to a purely descriptive\ntheory of reference for artifact terms, but rather a hybrid theory.\nHilary Kornblith (2007) argues against Thomasson that she has still\nnot demonstrated any essential connection between makers\u2019\nsubstantive concepts of artifacts and reference. On the one hand, in\ncases where a type of artifact is no longer used for the purpose the\nmaker intended, the users\u2019 concept would seem decisive. On the\nother hand, having the concept is arguably the result of familiarity\nwith the artifact rather than any special semantic capacity enjoyed by\nmakers. Similarly, Kornblith (1980) argues against Schwartz that the\nfunction of artifacts is not necessarily accessible\u2014a problem\nfaced frequently by archaeologists, for instance\u2014and thus that\neven in cases of objects where the form and function are familiar, it\nis not this familiarity that grounds the ability to refer. The\nbaptismal account of reference therefore must apply to both artifacts\nand natural objects, just as Putnam said. Such semantic parity between\nartifacts and natural objects, which rejects any privilege for\nmakers\u2019 intentions, echoes Vogel\u2019s view that artifacts and\nnatural objects are equally \u201cwild\u201d, because artifacts\noutrun their makers\u2019 intentions in practice, just as surely as\nnatural objects outrun human intentions in principle.\n\nMuch of the epistemology of artifacts is, in the first instance, the\nprovince of cognitive psychology, not philosophy. Artifact kinds, for\ninstance, can be approached from the side of psychology rather than\nmetaphysics, yielding theories about the psychological mechanisms by\nmeans of which we group artifacts together, apart from any question of\nwhether these groupings represent reality (Malt & Sloman 2007a).\nIn an influential article, Paul Bloom (1996) argues that we cannot\ncategorize artifacts based on form, use, or function. Form and use are\nboth too variable to be reliable. Beanbag chairs do not look much like\nother chairs, and even if every flatiron in existence were currently\nbeing used as a doorstop, we would not want to categorize them as\ndoorstops. Experiments show that even intended function is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for categorization (Malt & Johnson 1992).\nVary the form of something sufficiently, and people will decline to\ncategorize it as a chair even if it is made to be sat on. On the other\nhand, present them with something that looks like a chair but is made\nto be a plant stand, and they will still categorize it as a chair. In\nresponse, Bloom proposes an intentional-historical theory, according\nto which categorization of artifacts depends on our being able to\ninfer that an artifact was successfully made with the intention that\nit belong to a particular category. Form and use are good grounds for\nsuch inferences, and this explains our intuition that these factors\nhave something to do with how we categorize artifacts. So if something\nlooks like a chair and we regularly observe people sitting on it, we\nreasonably infer it was made with the intention that it be a chair,\nand we categorize it accordingly. (Bloom\u2019s view is clearly\nancestral to Amie Thomasson\u2019s account of artifact kinds\n (Section 2.2),\n but he is concerned only to explain how we group artifacts, and does\nnot claim, as Thomasson does, that makers\u2019 intentions and\nconcepts are ontologically constitutive of artifact kinds.) Barbara\nMalt and Eric Johnson (1998) criticize Bloom for failing to make clear\neither why we would need to resort to creator\u2019s intention to\ncategorize artifacts, or exactly how we might assess that intention.\nMore recently, Malt and Steven Sloman (2007a; 2007b) have argued\nthat the kind of essentialist approach represented by Bloom\u2019s\ntheory is misguided, and have proposed an alternative, pragmatic\napproach. In a series of experiments, they show that artifact\ncategorization is sensitive to communicative goals in specific\nsituations. Creators\u2019 intentions are important with regard to\nsome goals and situations; unimportant with regard to others. If this\napproach is on the right track, artifact kinds are not psychologically\nstable or clearly demarcated groupings. Moreover, this raises the\npossibility that \u201ccategorization\u201d itself is not a\npsychological natural kind. It may be that this label is used for what\nis actually a heterogeneous collection of processes.\n\nDevelopmental issues with regard to our concepts of\n\u201cartifact\u201d and specific kinds of artifacts also loom large\nin cognitive psychology. As philosophers might anticipate, the\nunderlying general issue is between empiricist and nativist approaches\nto concept acquisition. But the now vast experimental literature on\nchild development means that theories in this area are both numerous\nand highly sophisticated. An empiricist-oriented theory that stands\nout is Jean Mandler\u2019s (2004; 2007) comprehensive perceptual\nmeaning analysis view, according to which children construct abstract\nimage schemas on the basis of their perceptual experience, especially\ntheir experience of motion. Since artifacts and animals move in\ncharacteristically different ways, the first level of differentiation\nthese image schemas provide is vague, global concepts of these two\ntypes of objects. Mandler holds that there is no good reason to think\nthese concepts are innate, nor is there any good reason to think that\nthe perceptual meaning analysis mechanisms that produce them are\ndomain specific. All that is innate, on her view, is a domain-general\nmechanism that enables the child to analyze her perceptual input.\nMandler\u2019s work also indicates that artifacts may be first\ndifferentiated into indoor and outdoor, and only then into more\nspecific kinds such as furniture and kitchen utensils, on the one\nhand, and vehicles and buildings, on the other. The nativist\nalternative to Mandler\u2019s theory is best represented by Susan\nCarey\u2019s equally comprehensive \u201ccore cognition\u201d\ntheory. Carey (2009, 194\u2013196) has a characteristically\nnativist critique of Mandler. On the face of it, Mandler\u2019s image\nschemas represent features of motion and the paths motions describe\nthrough space. However, Carey argues, there is no explanation of how\nthe child gets from these representations to a representation of\nagency, for example. No matter how distinctive the motions of animals,\nthey do not by themselves yield concepts of intention, attention, or\ngoal-directedness. On Carey\u2019s view, these concepts must be\ninnate in the form of \u201ccore knowledge\u201d (Spelke 2000), or\n\u201ccore cognition\u201d, as Carey prefers to call it in her more\nrecent work. Core cognition is characterized by innate,\ndomain-specific mechanisms for the analysis of perceptual input,\ndesigned by natural selection to construct domain-specific\nrepresentations of the world, such as intention in the agent domain,\nor causality in the object domain. Both of these domains of core\ncognition are essential for the development of artifact concepts,\nbecause on Carey\u2019s view (Kelemen & Carey 2007) we\nconceptualize artifacts as objects that have been intentionally\ndesigned to carry out a specific function. The developmental issue,\nthen, boils down to the question of whether we can construct artifact\nconcepts with only a single, domain-general mechanism for analyzing\nperceptual input, or whether we need at least two domain-specific\nmechanisms with quite different output.\n3.3 Thinking and Acting With Artifacts\n\nArtifacts are not only objects of knowledge; they are also involved in\ncognition itself. No one disputes that humans use artifacts in their\ncognitive practices\u2014we do our sums on paper or with electronic\ndevices; and memory aids from individual grocery lists to monuments\nenshrining cultural memory are ubiquitous. But in recent years a\nloosely interconnected collection of approaches has characterized\nartifacts as much more intimately involved in these processes than\nmere use might suggest. Rather than trying to sort out the complex\nfamily resemblances among embodied, enactive, situated, distributed\nand extended approaches to cognition (Sutton 2006; Wilson & Clark\n2009), we can more profitably focus on some representative studies of\nthe way artifacts contribute to cognition in this family of\nviews.\n\nIn a seminal paper, Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) propose the\nradical thesis that the mind extends beyond the brain and the body,\nright out into the environment. In their now famous illustration, two\ncharacters, Inga and Otto, hear about an interesting exhibition at the\nMuseum of Modern Art. Inga is neurotypical. She recalls the address of\nthe museum and travels there. Otto, on the other hand, has\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. Because he forgets things so easily, he\nmaintains a notebook with the addresses of places he is wont to visit.\nHe looks up the address of the museum and travels there. The moral of\nthis illustration is the so-called Parity Principle.\n\n\nIf, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a\nprocess which, were it done in the head, we would have no\nhesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that\npart of the world is (so we claim) part of the cognitive process.\n(Clark & Chalmers 1998, 8)\n\n\nThis claim is intended as a thesis in the metaphysics of mind, but it\nfunctions equally well as a thesis about the epistemic status of\nartifacts. In Otto\u2019s case\u2014and it is clear Clark and\nChalmers intend it not as an exceptional case, but as a particularly\nstriking instance of a commonplace one\u2014the notebook is cognitive\nin its own right. It is an essential element of a widely individuated\ncognitive process, not a cognitively neutral tool used by an\nencapsulated cognizer. Critics of the extended mind thesis have been,\nif not legion, extremely persistent (Menary 2010). But they have\nfocused mostly on the disconcerting metaphysical implications, rather\nthan on the equally significant implications about cognition. John\nSutton (2010) anticipates the metaphysical tendentiousness of the\nParity Principle giving way to the important work of understanding the\ncomplementarity of inner and outer processes in cognition which is\nhighlighted by the extended mind thesis. Individuating cognitive\nprocesses widely, so that the unit of investigation is not the\nmind/brain but cognitive systems comprising tightly coupled artifacts,\npeople, built environments and natural environments, is a viable\nproject in its own right, and one that was underway in many quarters\nbefore the extended mind thesis was proposed.\n\nThe locus classicus is Edwin Hutchins\u2019 Cognition in\nthe Wild (1995). Hutchins preserves the traditional understanding\nof cognition as computation\u2014that is, the manipulation of\nrepresentations. But he argues that this computation takes place not\nin individual heads, but distributed across systems of individuals,\nartifacts, and other environmental structures. Hutchins works out his\ntheory of distributed cognition in the context of a magisterial study\nof navigation aboard a US Navy ship. He shows that the representations\nand transformations thereof required for navigation are propagated\nacross a complex system of charts, logs, instruments and cooperating\nhumans, no one of whom is either directing the process or in\npossession of all the knowledge the system uses or produces.\nHutchins\u2019 own studies typically involve cognition in\ntechnologically sophisticated workplaces. But other researchers in the\ndistributed cognition vein apply the theory to more easily accessible\neveryday situations. David Kirsh (1995) argues that we use the\nplacement of artifacts in the surrounding space to simplify our\ncognitive lives in various ways. For example, baggers in a grocery\nstore will first group different types of items\u2014large, heavy,\nfragile, and so on\u2014on the checkout counter before starting to\npack the bags. This simplifies the cognitive task of spotting the\nlarge heavy items you need for the bottom of the bag, or the medium\nsized boxed items you need to fill in spaces half way up. Similarly,\nsomeone preparing to bake a cake will often array all the ingredients\non the kitchen counter first, thus minimizing the possibility that any\nwill be left out in the heat of the moment. The general point,\nemphasized across the board by proponents of situated cognition, is\nthat artifacts and other environmental structures\n\u201cscaffold\u201d cognition, changing the nature of cognitive\ntasks in important ways that typically make them more tractable (Lave\n1988; Donald 1991; Clark 1997; Kirsh 2009; Michaelian & Sutton\n2013).\n\nCognition is intimately bound up with action on any construal, but the\nsituated cognition framework makes it even more difficult to tease\nthem apart. On a more traditional view, the emphasis is on how\ncognition shapes action. But on the situated cognition family of\nviews, the emphasis is on how bodily activity antecedently shapes\ncognition, and indeed the mind in general (Gallagher 2005). Since\nhuman action typically involves the making and manipulation of\nartifacts, they, too, contribute to this mind-shaping process\n(Malafouris 2013). But artifacts shape action and patterns of behavior\nin the first instance. Some writers have focused on this\naction-shaping aspect of artifacts rather than on the\ncognition-shaping aspect. The locus classicus in this case is\nMichel Foucault\u2019s (1975 [1977]) Discipline and Punish.\nOn Foucault\u2019s view, human action is substantially shaped by the\nvery layout of the built environment and the specifics of the smaller\nartifacts that furnish it, not\u2014as we naively tend to\nassume\u2014primarily by the interpersonal relationships of the\ninhabitants. The most obvious examples seem innocuous. In chair\ncultures, for instance, people sit upright and off the floor to eat\nmeals, while in non-chair cultures such as Japan they sit in various\npostures\u2014depending on the social situation\u2014on cushions on\nthe floor. But Foucault focuses on less innocuous examples such as\nprisons, which shape action in ways that manifest the exercise of\nsocial power. He contrasts the dungeon model, in which behavior is\ntemporarily shaped simply by sheer physical control over the\nprisoners\u2019 freedom of movement, with the Panopticon model, in\nwhich the prisoners are kept under constant surveillance by invisible\nobservers, prompting them to shape their own behavior in various\nhabitual ways that survive the term of their imprisonment. This\nensures a kind of continuing social control not available under the\ndungeon model. Foucault\u2019s further point is that this\n\u201cdisciplinary\u201d model is now pervasive in social\ninstitutions from education to workplace to health care to the\n\u201csmart\u201d home. Related themes surface in Bruno\nLatour\u2019s (1994; 1999) technical mediation theory. On his\nview, agency is not a property of individual humans, but rather of\ncollectives of \u201cactants\u201d\u2014humans and nonhumans\nrelated to each other in specific, systematic ways. In contemporary\nwestern culture, the non-human actants are typically artifacts.\nLatour\u2019s telling illustration starts with the well-known dispute\nbetween gun control advocates, who insist that \u201cguns kill\u201d\nand the National Rifle Association, which insists that \u201cpeople\nkill\u201d. Against both of these positions, Latour argues that the\nagent who kills is neither the gun nor the person, but a composite\nperson-gun (or gun-person). Neither the person nor the gun remains the\nsame in this relational context as they were before. Moreover, Latour\nargues, the relationship is symmetrical. Just as humans have\nintentions that enable them to enlist specific artifacts, artifacts\nhave \u201cscripts\u201d\u2014features of their design that enable\nthem to enlist humans, facilitating certain behaviors and inhibiting\nothers. Both Foucault and Latour tend to study the phenomena of human\naction in large-scale, institutional contexts\u2014prisons and\nhospitals in the case of Foucault, scientific laboratories and\ntransportation systems in the case of the actor-network theory\npioneered by Latour and others. But there are also a number of writers\nwho focus on the role of artifacts in small-scale, everyday contexts.\nTim Ingold (2013), for example, focuses on skilled practice,\nparticularly in the context of making things, from stone tools to\nbaskets to paintings. His work shows that the generation of\nartifactual structure is as much due to the nature of the materials\nused as to any intention or plan on the part of the maker. Moreover,\nthe nature of the materials and the tools used structure the activity\nof making itself. In a similar vein, Beth Preston (2013) argues that\nhuman action is more a matter of improvisation than planning, and that\nthe continuously evolving structure of improvisatory action owes much\nto the opportunities artifacts afford. Furthermore, it is in\ninteraction with artifacts in daily life that we develop the purposes\nand behavior patterns appropriate to them. Thus, having started with a\ntraditional definition of \u201cartifact\u201d that emphasizes the\ndependence of artifacts on human intentions and purposes, the\nepistemology of artifacts brings us back around to a view that\nemphasizes instead the dependence of human cognition and action on\nartifacts.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>Nichomachean Ethics, Metaphysics, Physics</em>, in\nJonathan Barnes (ed.), <em>The Complete Works of Aristotle</em>,\nVolumes I and II, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984.", "Baker, Lynne Rudder, 2007, <em>The Metaphysics of Everyday Life:\nAn Essay in Practical Realism</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511487545", "Bloom, Paul, 1996, \u201cIntention, History, and Artifact\nConcepts\u201d, <em>Cognition</em>, 60(1): 1\u201329.\ndoi:10.1016/0010-0277(95)00699-0", "Boyd, Richard, 1999, \u201cHomeostasis, Species, and Higher\nTaxa\u201d, in Robert A.
