    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It || Attack on the Paralogisms, 1st Edition\n2.4 Attack on the Paralogisms, 1st Edition\n\n\nThe chapter on the Paralogisms, the first of the three parts of Kant\u2019s\nsecond project, contains Kant\u2019s most original insights into the nature\nof consciousness of the self. In the first edition, he seems to have\nachieved a stable position on self-consciousness only as late as this\nchapter. Certainly his position was not stable in TD. Even his famous\nterm for consciousness of self, \u2018I think\u2019, occurs for the\nfirst time only in the introduction to the chapter on the\nParalogisms. His target is claims that we know what the mind is\nlike. Whatever the merits of Kant\u2019s attack on these claims, in the\ncourse of mounting it, he made some very deep-running observations\nabout consciousness and knowledge of self.\n\n\nTo summarize: in the first edition, TD contains most of what Kant\nhad to say about synthesis and unity, but little on the nature of\nconsciousness of self. The chapter on the Paralogisms contains most of\nwhat he has to say about consciousness of self.\n2.5 The Two Discussions in the 2nd-edition TD and Other Discussions\n\n\nAs we said, Kant rewrote both TD and the chapter on the Paralogisms\nfor the second edition of CPR, leaving only their\nintroductions intact. In the course of doing so, he moved the topic of\nconsciousness of self from the chapter on the Paralogisms to the\nsecond discussion of the mind in the new TD. The new version of the\nParalogisms chapter is then built around a different and, so far as\ntheory of mind is concerned, much less interesting strategy. The\nrelationship of the old and new versions of the chapters is\ncomplicated (Brook 1994, Ch. 9). Here we will just note that the\nunderlying doctrine of the mind does not seem to change very much.\n\nCPR contains other discussions of the mind, discussions\nthat remained the same in both editions. The appendix on what Kant\ncalled Leibniz\u2019 Amphiboly contains the first explicit discussion of an\nimportant general metaphysical notion, numerical identity (being one\nobject at and over time), and contains the first argument in\nCPR for the proposition that sensible input is needed for\nknowledge. (Kant asserts this many times earlier but assertion is not\nargument.) In the Antinomies, the discussion of the Second Antinomy\ncontains some interesting remarks about the simplicity of the soul and\nthere is a discussion of free will in the Solution to the Third\nAntinomy. The mind also appears a few times in the Doctrine of Method,\nparticularly in a couple of glosses of the attack mounted against the\nParalogisms. (A784=B812ff is perhaps the most interesting.)\n\n\nIn other new material prepared for the second edition, we find a\nfirst gloss on the topic of self-consciousness as early as the\nAesthetic (B68). The mind also appears in a new passage called the\nRefutation of Idealism, where Kant attempts to tie the possibility of\none sort of consciousness of self to consciousness of permanence in\nsomething other than ourselves, in a way he thought to be inconsistent\nwith Berkeleian idealism. This new Refutation of Idealism has often\nbeen viewed as a replacement for the argument against the Fourth\nParalogism of the first edition. There are problems with this view, the\nmost important of which is that the second edition still has a separate\nfourth Paralogism (B409). That said, though the new passage utilizes\nself-consciousness in a highly original way, it says little that is new\nabout it.\n\n\nElsewhere in his work, the only sustained discussion of the mind and\nconsciousness is, as we said, his little, late Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View. By \u2018anthropology\u2019 Kant meant\nthe study of human beings from the point of view of their\n(psychologically-controlled) behaviour, especially their behaviour\ntoward one another, and of the things revealed in behaviour such as\ncharacter. Though Kant sometimes contrasted anthropology as a legitimate study\nwith what he understood empirical psychology to be, namely, psychology\nbased on introspective observation, he meant by anthropology something\nfairly close to what we now mean by behavioural or experimental\npsychology.\n3. Kant\u2019s View of the Mind\n3.1 Method\n\n\nTurning now to Kant\u2019s view of the mind, we will start with a point\nabout method: Kant held surprisingly strong and not entirely\nconsistent views on the empirical study of the mind. The empirical\nmethod for doing psychology that Kant discussed was introspection.\n\n\n\nSometimes he held such study to be hopeless. The key text on\npsychology is in The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience. There Kant tell us that \u201cthe empirical doctrine of\nthe soul \u2026 must remain even further removed than chemistry from\nthe rank of what may be called a natural science proper\u201d\n(Ak. IV:471). (In Kant\u2019s defence, there was nothing resembling a\nsingle unified theory of chemical reactions in his time.) The contents\nof introspection, in his terms inner sense, cannot be studied\nscientifically for at least five reasons.\n\n\nFirst, having only one universal dimension and one that they are\nonly represented to have at that, namely, distribution in\ntime, the contents of inner sense cannot be quantified; thus no\nmathematical model of them is possible. Second, \u201cthe manifold of\ninternal observation is separated only by mere thought\u201d. That is\nto say, only the introspective observer distinguishes the items one\nfrom another; there are no real distinctions among the items\nthemselves. Third, these items \u201ccannot be kept separate\u201d in\na way that would allow us to connect them again \u201cat will\u201d,\nby which Kant presumably means, according to the dictates of our\ndeveloping theory. Fourth, \u201canother thinking subject [does not]\nsubmit to our investigations in such a way as to be conformable to our\npurposes\u201d \u2013 the only thinking subject whose inner sense one\ncan investigate is oneself. Finally and most damningly, \u201ceven the\nobservation itself alters and distorts the state of the object\nobserved\u201d (1786, Ak. IV:471). Indeed, introspection can be bad\nfor the health: it is a road to \u201cmental illness\u201d\n(\u2018Illuminism and Terrorism\u2019, 1798, Ak. VII:133; see\n161).\n\n\nIn these critical passages, it is not clear why he didn\u2019t respect what\nhe called anthropology more highly as an empirical study of the mind,\ngiven that he himself did it. He did so elsewhere. In the\nAnthropology, for example, he links\n\u2018self-observation\u2019 and observation of others and calls\nthem both sources of anthropology (Ak. VII:142\u20133).\n\n Whatever, no kind of empirical psychology can yield necessary truths\nabout the mind. In the light of this limitation, how should\nwe study the mind? Kant\u2019s answer was: transcendental method using\ntranscendental arguments (notions introduced earlier). If we cannot\nobserve the connections among the denizens of inner sense to any\npurpose, we can study what the mind must be like and what\ncapacities and structures (in Kant\u2019s jargon, faculties) it\nmust have if it is to represent things as it does. With this\nmethod we can find universally true, that is to say,\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 psychological propositions. We have\nalready seen what some of them are: minds must be able to synthesize\nand minds must have a distinctive unity, for example. Let us turn now\nto these substantive claims.\n3.2 Synthesis and Faculties\n\n\nWe have already discussed Kant\u2019s view of the mind\u2019s handling of\nspace and time, so we can proceed directly to his doctrine of\nsynthesis. As Kant put it in one of his most famous passages,\n\u201cConcepts without intuitions are empty, intuitions without\nconcepts are blind\u201d (A51=B75). Experience requires both percepts\nand concepts. As we might say now, to discriminate, we need\ninformation; but for information to be of any use to us, we must\norganize the information. This organization is provided by acts of\nsynthesis.\nBy synthesis, in its most general sense, I\nunderstand the act of putting different representations together, and\nof grasping what is manifold in them in one knowledge\n[A77=B103]\n\nIf the doctrine of space and time is the first major part of his\nmodel of the mind, the doctrine of synthesis is the second. Kant\nclaimed, as we saw earlier, that three kinds of synthesis are required\nto organize information, namely apprehending in intuition, reproducing\nin imagination, and recognizing in concepts (A97-A105). Each of the\nthree kinds of synthesis relates to a different aspect of Kant\u2019s\nfundamental duality of intuition and concept. Synthesis of\napprehension concerns raw perceptual input, synthesis of recognition\nconcerns concepts, and synthesis of reproduction in imagination allows\nthe mind to go from the one to the other. \n\n\nThey also relate to three fundamental faculties of the mind. One is\nthe province of Sensibility, one is the province of Understanding, and\nthe one in the middle is the province of a faculty that has a far less\nsettled position than the other two, namely, Imagination (see\nA120).\n\n\nThe first two, apprehension and reproduction, are inseparable; one\ncannot occur without the other (A102). The third, recognition, requires\nthe other two but is not required by them. It seems that only the third\nrequires the use of concepts; this problem of non-concept-using\nsyntheses and their relationship to use of the categories becomes a\nsubstantial issue in the second edition (see B150ff.), where Kant tries\nto save the universality of the objective deduction by arguing that all\nthree kinds of syntheses are required to represent objects.\n\n\nActs of synthesis are performed on that to which we are passive in\nexperience, namely intuitions (Anschauungen). Intuitions are\nquite different from sense-data as classically understood; we can\nbecome conscious of intuitions only after acts of synthesis and only by\ninference from these acts, not directly. Thus they are something more\nlike theoretical entities (better, events) postulated to explain\nsomething in what we do recognize. What they explain is the\nnon-conceptual element in representations, an element over which we\nhave no control. Intuitions determine how our representations will\nserve to confirm or refute theories, aid or impede our efforts to reach\nvarious goals.\n3.2.1 Synthesis of Apprehension in Intuition\n\n\nThe synthesis of apprehension is somewhat more shadowy than the\nother two. In the second edition, the idea does not even appear until\n\u00a726, i.e., late in TD. At A120, Kant tells us that apprehending\nimpressions is taking them up into the activity of imagination, i.e.,\ninto the faculty of the mind that becomes conscious of images. He tells\nus that we can achieve the kind of differentiation we need to take them\nup only \u201cin so far as the mind distinguishes the time in the\nsequence of one impression upon another\u201d (A99). Kant uses the\nterm \u2018impression\u2019 (Eindrucke) rarely; it seems to\nbe in the same camp as \u2018appearance\u2019 (Erscheinung)\nand \u2018intuition\u2019 (Anschauung).\n\n\nThe idea behind the strange saying just quoted seems to be this.\nKant seems to have believed that we can become conscious of only one\nnew item at a time. Thus a group of simultaneous\n\u2018impressions\u2019 all arriving at the same time would be\nindistinguishable, \u201cfor each representation\n[Vorstellung], in so far as it is contained in a single\nmoment, can never be anything but absolute unity\u201d (A99).\nKant\u2019s use of Vorstellung, with its suggestion of synthesized,\nconceptualized organization, may have been unfortunate, but what I\nthink he meant is this. Prior to synthesis and conceptual organization,\na manifold of intuitions would be an undifferentiated unit, a seamless,\nbuzzing confusion. Thus, to distinguish one impression from another, we\nmust give them separate locations. Kant speaks only of temporal\nlocation but he may very well have had spatial location in mind,\ntoo.\n\n\nThe synthesis of apprehension is closely related to the\nTranscendental Aesthetic. Indeed, it is the doing of what the Aesthetic\ntells us that the mind has to be able to do with respect to locating\nitems in time and space (time anyway).\n3.2.2 Synthesis of Reproduction in Imagination\n\n\nThe synthesis of reproduction in imagination has two elements, a\nsynthesis proper and associations necessary for performing that\nsynthesis. (Kant explicitly treats them as separate on A125:\n\u201crecognition, reproduction, association, apprehension\u201d.)\nBoth start from the appearances, as Kant now calls them, which the\nsynthesis of apprehension has located in time. At first glance, the\nsynthesis of reproduction looks very much like\n memory;\n however, it is actually quite different from memory. It is a matter\nof retaining earlier intuitions in such a way that certain other\nrepresentations can \u201cbring about a transition of the mind\u201d\nto these earlier representations, even in the absence of any current\nrepresentation of them (A100). Such transitions are the result of the\nsetting up of associations (which, moreover, need not be conscious)\nand do not require memory. Likewise, no recognition of any sort need\nbe involved; that the earlier representations have become associated\nwith later ones is not something that we need recognize. Memory and\nrecognition are the jobs of synthesis of recognition, yet to come.\n\n\nTo our ears now, it is a little strange to find Kant calling this\nactivity of reproduction and the activity of apprehension acts of\nimagination. Kant describes the function he had in mind as\n\u201ca blind but indispensable function of the soul\u201d\n(A78=B103), so he meant something rather different from what we now\nmean by the term \u2018imagination\u2019 (A120 and fn.). For Kant,\nimagination is a connecting of elements by forming an image:\n\u201c\u2026 imagination has to bring the manifold of intuitions\ninto the form of an image\u201d (A120). If \u2018imagination\u2019\nis understood in its root sense of image-making and we see imagination\nnot as opposed to but as part of perception, then Kant\u2019s choice of term\nbecomes less peculiar.\n3.2.3 Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept\n\n\nThe third kind of synthesis is synthesis of recognition in a\nconcept. To experience objects for Kant, first I have to relate the\nmaterials out of which they are constructed to one another temporally\nand spatially. They may not require use of concepts. Then I have to\napply at least the following kinds of concepts: concepts of number, of\nquality, and of modality (I am experiencing something real or\nfictitious). These are three of the four kinds of concepts that Kant\nhad identified as Categories. Note that we have so far not mentioned\nthe fourth, relational concepts.\n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s view, recognition requires memory; reproduction is not\nmemory but memory does enter now. The argument goes as follows.\n[A merely reproduced] manifold of representation would\nnever \u2026 form a whole, since it would lack that unity which only\nconsciousness can impart to it. If, in counting, I forget that the\nunits, which now hover before me, have been added to one another in\nsuccession, I should never know that a total is being produced through\nthis successive addition of unit to unit \u2026 [A103; see\nA78=B104].\n\n\nIn fact, as this passage tells us, synthesis into an object by an\nact of recognition requires two things. One is memory. The other is\nthat something in the past representations must be recognized as\nrelated to present ones. And to recognize that earlier and later\nrepresentations are both representing a single object, we must use a\nconcept, a rule (A121, A126). In fact, we must use a number of\nconcepts: number, quality, modality, and, of course, the specific\nempirical concept of the object we are recognizing.\n\n\nImmediately after introducing recognition, Kant brings apperception\nand the unity of apperception into the discussion. The acts by which we\nachieve recognition under concepts are acts of apperception. By\n\u2018apperception\u2019, Kant means the faculty or capacity for\njudging in accord with a rule, for applying concepts. Apperceiving is\nan activity necessary for and parallel to perceiving (A120). This is\none of the senses in which Leibniz used the term, too. To achieve\nrecognition of a unified object, the mind must perform an act of\njudgment; it must find how various represented elements are connected\nto one another. This judgment is an act of apperception. Apperception\nis the faculty that performs syntheses of recognition (A115). Note that\nwe are not yet dealing with transcendental apperception.\n\n\nTo sum up: For experiences to have objects, acts of recognition that\napply concepts to spatio-temporally ordered material are required.\nRepresentation requires recognition. Moreover, objects of\nrepresentation share a general structure. They are all some number of\nsomething, they all have qualities, and they all have an\nexistence-status. (Put this way, Kant\u2019s claim that the categories are\nrequired for knowledge looks quite plausible.)\n3.3 Synthesis: A 90\u00b0 Turn\n\n\nWith the synthesis of recognition, TD should be close to complete.\nKant merely needs to argue that these concepts must include the\ncategories, which he does at A111, and that should be that.\n\n\nBut that is not that. In fact, as we said earlier, we are only about\none-third of the way through the chapter. The syntheses of\napprehension, reproduction, and recognition of single objects march in\na single temporal/object-generational line. Suddenly at A106 Kant makes\na kind of 90o turn. From the generation of a representation\nof individual objects of experience over time, he suddenly\nturns to a form of recognition that requires the unification and\nrecognition of multiple objects existing at the same time. He\nmoves from acts of recognition of individual objects to unified acts of\nrecognition of multiple objects which \u201cstand along side one\nanother in one experience\u201d (A108). This 90o turn is a\npivotal moment in TD and has received less attention than it\ndeserves.\n\n\nThe move that Kant makes next is interesting. He argues that the\nmind could not use concepts so as to have unified objects of\nrepresentation if its consciousness were not itself unified\n(A107\u2013108). Why does consciousness and its unity appear here? We have\nbeen exploring what is necessary to have experience. Why would it\nmatter if, in addition, unified consciousness were necessary? As Walker\n(1978, p. 77) and Guyer (1987, pp. 94\u20135) have shown, Kant did not need\nto start from anything about the mind to deduce the\nCategories. (A famous footnote in The Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science [Ak. IV:474fn.] is Kant\u2019s best-known comment on\nthis issue.) So why does he suddenly introduce unified\nconsciousness?\n\n\nSo far Kant has \u2018deduced\u2019 only three of the four kinds\nof categorical concepts, number, quality, and modality. He has said\nnothing about the relational categories. For Kant, this would have been\na crucial gap. One of his keenest overall objectives in CPR is\nto show that physics is a real science. To do this, he thinks that he\nneeds to show that we must use the concept of causality in experience.\nThus, causality is likely the category that he cared more about than\nall the other categories put together. Yet up to A106, Kant has said\nnothing about the relational categories in general or causality in\nparticular. By A111, however, Kant is talking about the use of the\nrelational categories and by A112 causality is front and centre. So it\nis natural to suppose that, in Kant\u2019s view at least, the material\nbetween A106 and A111 contains an argument for the necessity of\napplying the relational categories, even though he never says so.\n\n\nUp to A106, Kant has talked about nothing but normal individual\nobjects: a triangle and its three sides, a body and its shape and\nimpenetrability. At A107, he suddenly begins to talk about tying\ntogether multiple represented objects, indeed \u201call possible\nappearances, which can stand alongside one another in one\nexperience\u201d (A108). The solution to the problem of showing that\nwe have to use the category of causality must lie somewhere in this\nactivity of tying multiple objects together.\n\n\nThe passage between A106 and A111 is blindingly difficult. It takes\nup transcendental apperception, the unity and identity of the mind, and\nthe mind\u2019s consciousness of itself as the subject of all its\nrepresentations (A106\u2013108). I think that this passage introduces either\na new stage or even a new starting point for TD. Here many commentators\n(Strawson, Henrich, Guyer) would think immediately of\nself-consciousness. Kant did use consciousness of self as a starting\npoint for deductions, at B130 in the B-edition for example. But that is\nnot what appears here, not in the initial paragraphs anyway.\n\n\nWhat Kant does say is this. Our experience is \u201cone\nexperience\u201d; \u201call possible appearances \u2026 stand\nalongside one another in one experience\u201d (A108). We have\n\u201cone and the same general experience\u201d of \u201call\n\u2026 the various perceptions\u201d (A110), \u201ca connected\nwhole of human knowledge\u201d (A121). Let us call this general\nexperience a global representation.\n\nTranscendental apperception (hereafter TA) now enters. It\nis the ability to tie \u2018all appearances\u2019 together into\n\u2018one experience\u2019.\nThis transcendental unity of apperception forms out of all\npossible appearances, which can stand alongside one another in one\nexperience, a connection of all these representations according to\nlaws. [A108]\n\n\nIt performs a \u201csynthesis of all appearances according to\nconcepts\u201d, \u201cwhereby it subordinates all synthesis of\napprehension \u2026 to a transcendental unity\u201d (A108). This, he\nthought, requires unified consciousness. Unified consciousness is\nrequired for another reason, too. Representations\ncan [so much as] represent something to me only in so far\nas they belong with all others to one consciousness. Therefore, they\nmust at least be capable of being so connected [A116].\n\n\nThe introduction of unified consciousness opens up an important new\nopportunity. Kant can now explore the necessary conditions of conscious\ncontent being unified in this way. To make a long story short, Kant now\nargues that conscious content could have the unity that it does only if\nthe contents themselves are tied together\n causally.[5]\n\n\n\nWith this, his deduction of the relational categories is complete\nand his defence of the necessity of physics is under way. The notion of\nunified consciousness to which Kant is appealing here is interesting in\nits own right, so let us turn to it\n next.[6]\n\n3.4 Unity of Consciousness\n\n\nFor Kant, consciousness being unified is a central feature of the\nmind, our kind of mind at any rate. In fact, being a single integrated\ngroup of experiences (roughly, one person\u2019s experiences) requires two\nkinds of unity.\n\nThe experiences must have a single common subject (A350);\n\nand,\n\n\nThe consciousness that this subject has of represented objects\nand/or representations must be unified.\n\n\n\nThe first requirement may look trivial but it is not. For Hume, for\nexample, what makes a group of experiences one person\u2019s experiences is\nthat they are associated with one another in an appropriate way (the\nso-called bundle theory), not that they have a common subject. The need\nfor a subject arises from two straightforward considerations:\nrepresentations not only represent something, they represent it to\nsomeone; and, representations are not given to us \u2013 to become a\nrepresentation, sensory inputs must be processed by an integrated\ncognitive system. Kant may have been conscious of both these points,\nbut beyond identifying the need, he had little to say about what the\nsubject of experience might be like, so we will say no more about it.\n(We will, however, say something about what its consciousness of itself\nis like later.)\n\n\nKant seems to have used the terms \n \u2018unity of consciousness\u2019 (A103)\n and \u2018unity of apperception\u2019 (A105, A108) \ninterchangeably. The well-known argument at the beginning of the first\nedition attack on the second paralogism (A352) focuses on this unity\nat a given time (among other things) and what can (or rather, cannot)\nbe inferred from this about the nature of the mind (a topic to which\nwe will return below). The attack on the third paralogism focuses on\nwhat can be inferred from unified consciousness over time. These are\nall from the first edition of CPR. In the second edition,\nKant makes remarks about unity unlike anything in the first edition,\nfor example, \u201cthis unity \u2026 is not the category of\nunity\u201d (B131).  The unity of consciousness and Kant\u2019s\nviews on it are complicated issues but some of the most important\npoints include the following.\n\n\nBy \u2018unity of consciousness\u2019, Kant seems to have the\nfollowing in mind: I am conscious not only of single experiences but of\na great many experiences at the same time. The same is true of actions;\nI can do and be conscious of doing a number of actions at the same\ntime. In addition to such synchronic unity, many global\nrepresentations, as we called them, display temporal unity: current\nrepresentation is combined with retained earlier representation.\n(Temporal unity is often a feature of synthesis of recognition.) Any\nrepresentation that we acquire in a series of temporal steps, such as\nhearing a sentence, will have unity across time (A104; A352).\n\n\nKant himself did not explicate his notion of unified consciousness\nbut here is one plausible articulation of the notion at work in his\nwritings.\nThe unity of consciousness =df. (i) a single act\nof consciousness, which (ii) makes one conscious of a number of\nrepresentations and/or objects of representation in such a way that to\nbe conscious by having any members of this group is also to be\nconscious by having others in the group and of at least some of them as\na group.\n\n\nAs this definition makes clear, consciousness being unified is more\nthan just being one state of consciousness. Unified consciousness is\nnot just singular, it is unified.\n\n\nKant placed great emphasis on the unity of consciousness, both\npositively and negatively. Positively, he held that conceptualized\nrepresentation has to be unified both at and across time. Negatively,\nfrom a mind having unified consciousness, he held that nothing follows\nconcerning its composition, its identity, especially its\n identity across time,\n nor its materiality or immateriality. He argued these points in his\nattacks on the second, third and fourth Paralogisms.\n4. Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self\n\n\nMany commentators hold that consciousness of self is central to the\nCritical philosophy. There is reason to question this: unified\nconsciousness is central, but consciousness of self? That is not so\nclear. Whatever, the topic is intrinsically interesting and Kant\nachieved some remarkable insights into it. Strangely, none of his\nimmediate successors took them up after his death and they next\nappeared at the earliest in Wittgenstein (1934\u20135) and perhaps not until\nShoemaker (1968). Kant never discussed consciousness of self in its own\nright, only in the context of pursuing other objectives, and his\nremarks on the topic are extremely scattered. When we pull his various\nremarks together, we can see that Kant advanced at least seven major\ntheses about consciousness of and\n knowledge of self.\n We will consider them one-by-one.\n4.1 Thesis 1: Two Kinds of Consciousness of Self\n\n\nThe first thesis:\n\nThere are two kinds of consciousness of self: consciousness of\noneself and one\u2019s psychological states in inner sense and\nconsciousness of oneself and one\u2019s states via performing acts of\napperception. \n\n\nKant\u2019s term for the former was \u2018empirical\nself-consciousness\u2019. A leading term for the latter was\n\u2018transcendental apperception\u2019 (TA). (Kant used the term\n\u2018TA\u2019 in two very different ways, as the name for a faculty\nof synthesis and as the name for what he also referred to as the\n\u2018I think\u2019, namely, one\u2019s consciousness of oneself as\nsubject.) Here is a passage from the Anthropology in which\nKant distinguishes the two kinds of consciousness of self very\nclearly:\n\u2026 the \u201cI\u201d of reflection\ncontains no manifold and is always the same in every judgment \u2026\nInner experience, on the other hand, contains the matter of\nconsciousness and a manifold of empirical inner intuition: \u2026\n[1798, Ak. VII:141\u20132, emphases in the original].\n\n\nThe two kinds of consciousness of self have very different\nsources.\n\n\nThe source of empirical self-consciousness is what Kant called inner\nsense. He did not work out his notion of inner sense at all well. Here\nare just a few of the problems. Kant insists that all representational\nstates are in inner sense, including those representing the objects of\nouter sense (i.e., spatially located objects):\nWhatever the origins of our representations, whether they\nare due to the influence of outer things, or are produced through inner\ncauses, whether they arise a priori, or being appearances have\nan empirical origin, they must all, as modifications of the mind,\nbelong to inner sense. [A98\u20139]\n\n\nHowever, he also says that the object of inner sense is the soul,\nthe object of outer sense the body (including one\u2019s own). He comes\nclose to denying that we can be conscious of the denizens of inner\nsense\u2014they do not represent inner objects and have no manifold\nof their own. Yet he also says that we can be conscious of them \u2014\nrepresentations can themselves be objects of representations, indeed,\nrepresentations can make us conscious of themselves. In its role as a\nform of or means to consciousness of self, apperception ought to be\npart of inner sense. Yet Kant regularly contrasted apperception, a\nmeans to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s acts of thinking, with\ninner sense as a means to consciousness of\u2014what? Presumably,\nparticular representations: perceptions, imaginings, memories, etc.\nHere is another passage from the Anthropology:\n\u00a724. Inner sense is not pure apperception,\nconsciousness of what we are doing; for this belongs to the power of\nthinking. It is, rather, consciousness of what we undergo as we are\naffected by the play of our own thoughts. This consciousness rests on\ninner intuition, and so on the relation of ideas (as they are either\nsimultaneous or successive). [1798, Ak. VII:161]\n\n\nKant makes the same distinction in CPR:\n\u2026 the I that I think is distinct from the I that it,\nitself, intuits \u2026; I am given to myself beyond that which is\ngiven in intuition, and yet know myself, like other phenomena, only as\nI appear to myself, not as I am \u2026 [B155].\n\n\nSince most of Kant\u2019s most interesting remarks about consciousness of\nand knowledge of self concern consciousness of oneself, the \u2018I of\nreflection\u2019 via acts of apperception, we will focus on it, though empirical consciousness\nof self will appear again briefly from time to time.\n4.2 Thesis 2: Representational Base of Consciousness of Oneself and One\u2019s States\n\n\nHow does apperception give rise to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates? In the passage just quoted from the Anthropology,\nnotice the phrase \u201cconsciousness of what we are doing\u201d\n\u2014 doing. The way in which one becomes conscious of an\nact of representing is not by receiving intuitions but by\ndoing it: \u201csynthesis \u2026, as an act, \u2026 is conscious\nto itself, even without sensibility\u201d (B153); \u201c\u2026\nthis representation is an act of spontaneity, that is, it\ncannot be regarded as belonging to sensibility\u201d (B132).\n\n\nEqually, we can be conscious of ourselves as subject merely by doing\nacts of representing. No further representation is needed.\nMan, \u2026 who knows the rest of nature solely through\nthe senses, knows himself also through pure apperception; and this,\nindeed, in acts and inner determinations which he cannot regard as\nimpressions of the senses [A546=B574].\n\n\nHow does one\u2019s consciousness of oneself in one\u2019s acts of\nrepresenting work? Consider the sentence:\nI am looking at the words on the screen in front of\nme.\n\n\nKant\u2019s claim seems to be that the representation of the words on the\nscreen is all the experience I need to be conscious not just of the\nwords and the screen but also of the act of seeing them and of\nwho is seeing them, namely, me. A single representation can do\nall three jobs. Let us call an act of representing that can make one\nconscious of its object, itself and oneself as its subject the\nrepresentational base of consciousness of these three\n items.[7]\n Kant\u2019s second major thesis is,\n\nMost ordinary representations generated by most ordinary acts of\nsynthesis provide the representational base of consciousness of\noneself and one\u2019s states.\n\n\n\nNote that this representational base is the base not only of\nconsciousness of one\u2019s representational states. It is also the base of\nconsciousness of oneself as the subject of those states\u2014as the\nthing that has and does them. Though it is hard to know for sure,\nKant would probably have denied that consciousness of oneself in inner\nsense can make one conscious of oneself as subject, of oneself as\noneself, in this way. \n\n\nFor Kant, this distinction between consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates by doing acts of synthesis and consciousness of oneself and\none\u2019s states as the objects of particular representations is of\nfundamental importance. When one is conscious of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates by doing cognitive and perceptual acts, one is conscious of\noneself as spontaneous, rational, self-legislating, free\u2014as\nthe doer of deeds, not just as a passive receptacle for\nrepresentations: \u201cI exist as an intelligence which is conscious\nsolely of its power of combination\u201d (B158\u2013159), of \u201cthe\nactivity of the self\u201d (B68) (Sellars, 1970\u20131; Pippin, 1987).\n\n\nSo far we have focussed on individual representations. For Kant,\nhowever, the representations that serve as the representational base of\nconsciousness of oneself as subject are usually much\n\u2018bigger\u2019 than that, i.e., contain multiple objects and\noften multiple representations of them tied together into what Kant\ncalled \u2018general experience\u2019.\nWhen we speak of different experiences, we can refer only\nto the various perceptions, all of which belong to one and the same\ngeneral experience. This thoroughgoing synthetic unity of perceptions\nis the form of experience; it is nothing less than the synthetic unity\nof appearances in accordance with concepts [A110].\n\n\nThis general experience is the global representation introduced\nearlier. When I am conscious of many objects and/or representations of\nthem as the single object of a single global representation, the latter\nrepresentation is all the representation I need to be conscious not\njust of the global object but also of myself as the common subject of\nall the constituent representations.\nThe mind could never think its identity in the manifoldness\nof its representations\u2026 if it did not have before its eyes the\nidentity of its act, whereby it subordinates all [the manifold]\n\u2026 to a transcendental unity\u2026 [A108].\n\n\nI am conscious of myself as the single common subject of a certain\ngroup of experiences by being conscious of \u201cthe identity of the\nconsciousness in \u2026 conjoined \u2026 representations\u201d\n(B133).\n4.3 Thesis 3: Consciousness in Inner Sense is Only of How One Appears to Oneself\n\n\nNeither consciousness of self by doing apperceptive acts nor empirical\nconsciousness of self as the object of particular representations\nyields knowledge of oneself as one is. On pain of putting his right to\nbelieve in immortality as an article of faith at risk, Kant absolutely\nhad to claim this. As he put it,\nit would be a great stumbling block, or rather would be the\none unanswerable objection, to our whole critique if it were possible\nto prove a priori that all thinking beings are in themselves\nsimple substances. [B409]\n\n\nThe same would hold for all other properties of thinking beings.\nSince Kant also sometimes viewed immortality, i.e., personal\ncontinuity beyond death, as a foundation of morality, morality could\nalso be at risk. So Kant had powerful motives to maintain that one\ndoes not know oneself as one is. Yet, according to him, we seem to\nknow at least some things about ourselves, namely, how we must\nfunction, and it would be implausible to maintain that one never\nconscious of one\u2019s real self at all. Kant\u2019s response to these pressures\nis ingenious.\n\n\nFirst, he treats inner sense: When we know ourselves as the object of\na representation in inner sense, we \u201cknow even ourselves only\n.. as appearance \u2026\u201d (A278).\nInner \u2026 sense \u2026 represents to consciousness even our\nown selves only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in ourselves.\nFor we intuit ourselves only as we are inwardly affected [by\nourselves] (B153).\n\n\nThis is the third thesis:\n\nIn inner sense, one is conscious of oneself only as one appears to\noneself, not as one is.\n\n\n\nSo when we seem to be directly conscious of features of ourselves,\nwe in fact have the same kind of consciousness of them as we have of features\nof things in general\u2014we appear to ourselves to be like this,\nthat or the other, in just the way that we know of any object only as\nit appears to us.\n\n\nThen he turns to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s states by doing\napperceptive acts. This is a knottier problem. Here we will consider\nonly consciousness of oneself as subject. Certainly by the second\nedition, Kant had come to see how implausible it would be to maintain\nthat one has no consciousness of oneself, one\u2019s real self, at all when\none is conscious of oneself as the subject of one\u2019s experience, agent\nof one\u2019s acts, by having these experiences and doing those acts. In\nthe 2nd edition, he reflects this sensitivity as early as\nB68; at B153, he goes so far as to say that an apparent contradiction\nis involved. \n\n\nFurthermore, when we are conscious of ourselves as subject and agent\nby doing acts of apperceiving, we do appear to ourselves to\nbe substantial, simple and continuing. He had to explain these\nappearances away; doing so was one of his aims, indeed, in his attacks on\nthe second and third Paralogisms. Thus, Kant had strong motives to\ngive consciousness of self as subject special treatment. The view that proposes is puzzling. I am not consciousness of myself as I appear to myself, nor as I am in myself but only \u201cthat I am\u201d (B157). To understand what he might mean here, we need a couple of intermediate theses. They contain the remarkable insights into reference to and consciousness of self mentioned earlier.\n4.4 Thesis 4: Referential Machinery of Consciousness of Self\n\n\nKant generated the special treatment he needed by focussing first on\nreference to self. Here are some of the things that he said about\nreference to oneself as subject. It is a consciousness of self in\nwhich \u201cnothing manifold is given.\u201d (B135). In the kind of\nreference in which we gain this consciousness of self, we\n\u201cdenote\u201d but do not \u201crepresent\u201d ourselves\n(A382). We designate ourselves without noting \u201cany quality\nwhatsoever\u201d in ourselves (A355). This yields his fourth thesis\nabout consciousness of and knowledge of self.\n\nThe referential machinery used to obtain consciousness of self as\nsubject requires no identifying (or other) ascription of properties to\noneself.\n\n\n\nThis is a remarkably penetrating claim; remember, the study of\nreference and semantics generally is usually thought to have begun only\nwith Frege. Kant is anticipating two important theses about reference\nto self that next saw the light of day only 200 years later.\n\nIn certain kinds of consciousness of self, one can be conscious of\nsomething as oneself without identifying it (or anything) as oneself\nvia properties that one has ascribed to the thing (self-reference\nwithout identification) (Shoemaker\n 1968),[8]\n\n\nand,\n\n\nIn such cases, first-person\n indexicals\n (I, me, my, mine) cannot be analysed out in favour of anything else,\nin particular anything descriptionlike (the essential indexical)\n(Perry 1979). \n\n\nWas Kant actually aware of (1) and/or (2) or had he just stumbled\nacross something that later philosophers recognized as significant?\n\n\nOne standard argument for (1) goes as follows:\nMy use of the word \u2018I\u2019 as the subject of\n[statements such as \u2018I feel pain\u2019 or \u2018I see a\ncanary\u2019] is not due to my having identified as myself something\n[otherwise recognized] of which I know, or believe, or wish to say,\nthat the predicate of my statement applies to it [Shoemaker 1968,\npp.558].\n\n\nA standard argument for (2), that certain indexicals are essential,\ngoes as follows. To know that I wrote a certain book a few\nyears ago, it is not enough to know that someone over six feet tall\nwrote that book, or that someone who teaches philosophy at a particular\nuniversity wrote that book, or \u2026 or \u2026 or \u2026 , for I\ncould know all these things without knowing that it was me who\nhas these properties (and I could know that it was me who\nwrote that book and not know that any of these things are properties of\nme). As Shoemaker puts it,\n\u2026 no matter how detailed a token-reflexive-free\ndescription of a person is, \u2026 it cannot possibly entail that I\nam that person [1968, pp. 560].\n\n\nKant unquestionably articulated the argument for (1):\nIn attaching \u2018I\u2019 to our thoughts, we designate\nthe subject only transcendentally \u2026 without noting in it any\nquality whatsoever\u2014in fact, without knowing anything of it\neither directly or by inference [A355].\n\n\nThis transcendental designation, i.e., referring to oneself\nusing \u2018I\u2019 without \u2018noting any quality\u2019 in\noneself, has some unusual features. One can refer to oneself in a\nvariety of ways, of course: as the person in the mirror, as the person\nborn on such and such a date in such and such a place, as the first\nperson to do X, and so on, but one way of referring to oneself\nis special: it does not require identifying or indeed any ascription to\noneself. So Kant tells\n us.[9]\n\n\nThe question is more complicated with respect to (2). We cannot go\ninto the complexities here (see Brook 2001). Here we will just note\nthree passages in which Kant may be referring to the essential\nindexical or something like it.\nThe subject of the categories cannot by thinking the\ncategories [i.e. applying them to objects] acquire a concept of itself\nas an object of the categories. For in order to think them, its pure\nself-consciousness, which is what was to be explained, must itself be\npresupposed. [B422]\n\n\nThe phrase \u2018its pure self-consciousness\u2019 seems to refer\nto consciousness of oneself as subject. If so, the passage may be\nsaying that judgments about oneself, i.e., ascriptions of properties to\noneself, \u2018presuppose \u2026 pure self-consciousness\u2019,\ni.e., consciousness of oneself via an act of ascription-free\ntranscendental designation.\n\n\nNow compare this, \u201cit is \u2026 very evident that I cannot\nknow as an object that which I must presuppose to know any object\n\u2026 .\u201d (A402), and this,\nThrough this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks,\nnothing further is represented than a transcendental subject of the\nthoughts = X. It is known only through the thoughts which are\nits predicates, and of it, apart from them, we cannot have any concept\nwhatsoever, but can only revolve in a perpetual circle, since any\njudgment upon it has always already made use of its representation.\n[A346=B404]\n\n\nThe last clause is the key one: \u201cany judgment upon it has\nalways already made use of its representation\u201d. Kant seems to be\nsaying that to know that anything is true of me, I must first know that\nit is me of whom it is true. This is something very like the essential\nindexical claim.\n\n\nIf reference to self takes place without \u2018noting any\nproperties\u2019 of oneself, the consciousness that results will also\nhave some special features.\n4.5 Thesis 5: No Manifold in Consciousness of Self\n\n\nThe most important special feature is that, in this kind of\nconsciousness of self, one is not, or need not be, conscious of any\nproperties of oneself, certainly not any particular properties. One has\nthe same consciousness of self no matter what else one is conscious of\n\u2014 thinking, perceiving, laughing, being miserable, or whatever.\nKant expressed the thought this way,\nthrough the \u2018I\u2019, as simple representation,\nnothing manifold is given. [B135]\n\n\nAnd this,\nthe I that I think is distinct from the I that it \u2026\nintuits \u2026; I am given to myself beyond that which is given in\nintuition. [B155]\n\n\nWe now have the fifth thesis to be found in Kant:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one has a bare\nconsciousness of self in which \u201cnothing manifold is\ngiven.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince, on Kant\u2019s view, one can refer to oneself as oneself without knowing any properties of oneself, not just identifying properties, \u2018non-ascriptive reference to self\u2019 might capture what is special about this form of consciousness of self better than Shoemaker\u2019s \u2018self-reference\nwithout identification\u2019.\n4.6 Thesis 6: Consciousness of Self is not Knowledge of Self\n\n\nTranscendental designation immediately yields the distinction that\nKant needs to allow that one is conscious of oneself as one is, not\njust of an appearance of self, and yet deny knowledge of oneself as one\nis. If consciousness of self ascribes nothing to the self, it can be a\n\u201cbare \u2026 consciousness of self [as one is]\u201d and yet\nyield no knowledge of self\u2014it is \u201cvery far from being a\nknowledge of the self\u201d (B158). This thesis returns us to\nconsciousness of self as subject:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one\u2019s bare\nconsciousness of self yields no knowledge of self.\n\n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s own work, he then put the idea of transcendental\ndesignation to work to explain how one can appear to oneself to be\nsubstantial, simple and persisting without these appearances reflecting\nhow one actually is. The reason that one appears in these ways is not\nthat the self is some strange, indefinable being. It is because of the\nkind of referring that we do to become conscious of oneself as subject.\nGiven how long ago he worked, Kant\u2019s insights into this kind of\nreferring are nothing short of amazing.\n4.7 Thesis 7: Conscious of Self as Single, Common Subject of Experience\n\n\nThe last of Kant\u2019s seven theses about consciousness of self is an\nidea that we already met when we discussed the unity of\nconsciousness:\n\nWhen we are conscious of ourselves as subject, we are conscious of\nourselves as the \u201csingle common subject\u201d [CPR,\nA350] of a number of representations.\n\n\n\nWhat Kant likely had in mind is nicely captured in a remark of\nBennett\u2019s (1974, p. 83): to think of myself as a plurality of things is\nto think of my being conscious of this plurality, \u201cand\nthat pre-requires an undivided me.\u201d Unlike one of anything else, it is not optional that I think of myself as one subject across a\nvariety of experiences (A107).\n5. Knowledge of the Mind\n\n\nThe remarks just noted about \u2018bare consciousness\u2019 and so\non by no means exhaust the concerns that can be raised about Kant and\nwhat we can know about the mind. His official view has to be: nothing\n\u2014 about the mind\u2019s structure and what it is composed of, at any\nrate, we can know nothing. As we have seen, Kant not only maintained\nthis but did some ingenious wiggling to account for the apparent\ncounter-evidence. But that is not the end of the story, for two\nreasons.\n\n\nFirst, whatever the commitments of his philosophy, Kant the person\nbelieved that the soul is simple and persists beyond death; he found\nmaterialism utterly repugnant (1783, Ak. IV, end of \u00a746). This is\nan interesting psychological fact about Kant but needs no further\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSecond and more importantly, Kant in fact held that we do\nhave knowledge of the mind as it is. In particular, we know that it has\nforms of intuition in which it must locate things spatially and\ntemporally, that it must synthesize the raw manifold of intuition in\nthree ways, that its consciousness must be unified, and so on \u2014\nall the aspects of the model examined above.\n\n\nTo square his beliefs about what we cannot know and what we do know\nabout the mind, Kant could have made at least two moves. He could have\nsaid that we know these things only \u2018transcendentally\u2019,\nthat is to say, by inference to the necessary conditions of experience.\nWe do not know them directly, in some sense of \u2018directly\u2019,\nso we don\u2019t have intuitive, i.e., sense-derived knowledge of them. Or\nhe could have said that ontological neutrality about structure and\ncomposition is compatible with knowledge of function. As we saw, Kant\u2019s\nconception of the mind is functionalist\u2014to understand the mind,\nwe must study what it does and can do, its functions\u2014and the\ndoctrine that function does not dictate form is at the heart of\ncontemporary functionalism. According to functionalism, we can gain\nknowledge of the mind\u2019s functions while knowing little or nothing about\nhow the mind is built. Approached this way, Kant\u2019s view that we know\nnothing of the structure and composition of the mind would\njust be a radical version of this functionalist idea. Either move would\nrestore consistency among his various claims about knowledge of the\nmind.\n6. Where Kant Has and Has Not Influenced Contemporary Cognitive Research\n\n\nWe will close by returning to the question of Kant\u2019s relationship to\ncontemporary cognitive research. As we saw, some of Kant\u2019s most\ncharacteristic doctrines about the mind are now built into the very\nfoundations of cognitive science. We laid out what they were.\nInterestingly, some of the others have played little or no role.\n\n\nConsider the two forms of Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept. In\nthe form of binding, the phenomenon that he had in mind in the first\nkind of synthesis is now widely studied. Indeed, one model, Anne\nTreisman\u2019s (1980) three-stage model, is very similar to all three\nstages of synthesis in Kant. According to Treisman and her colleagues,\nobject recognition proceeds in three stages: first feature detection,\nthen location of features on a map of locations, and then integration\nand identification of objects under concepts. This compares directly to\nKant\u2019s three-stage model of apprehension of features, association of\nfeatures (reproduction), and recognition of integrated groups of under\nconcepts (A98-A106). However, Kant\u2019s second kind of recognition under\nconcepts, the activity of tying multiple representations together into\na global representation (A107\u201314), has received little attention.\n\n\nThe same was true until recently of the\n unity of consciousness\n and Kant\u2019s work on it. However, this is changing. In the past twenty\nyears, the unity of consciousness has come back onto the research\nagenda and there are now hundreds of papers and a number of books on\nthe topic. However, claims such as Kant\u2019s that a certain form of\nsynthesis and certain links among the contents of experience are\nrequired for unity continue to be ignored in cognitive science, though\na few philosophers have done some work on them (Brook 2004). The same\nis true of Kant\u2019s views on consciousness of self; cognitive science\nhas paid no attention to non-ascriptive identification of self and the\nidea of the essential indexical. Here, too, a few philosophers have\nworked on these issues, apparently without knowing of Kant\u2019s\ncontribution (Brook & DeVidi, 2001), but not cognitive\nscientists.\n\n\nIn short, the dominant model of the mind in contemporary cognitive\nscience is Kantian, but some of his most distinctive contributions have\nnot been taken into it (Brook, 2004).",
