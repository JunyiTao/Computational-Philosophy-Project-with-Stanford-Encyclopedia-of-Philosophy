    "main_text": "\n\nAutonomous agents are self-governing agents. But what is a\nself-governing agent?  Governing oneself is no guarantee that one will\nhave a greater range of options in the future, or the sort of\nopportunities one most wants to have.  Since, moreover, a person can\ngovern herself without being able to appreciate the difference between\nright and wrong, it seems that an autonomous agent can do something\nwrong without being to blame for her action. What, then, are the\nnecessary and sufficient features of this self-relation?  Philosophers\nhave offered a wide range of competing answers to this question.\n",
