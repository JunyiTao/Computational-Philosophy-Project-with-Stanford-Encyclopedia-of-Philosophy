    "main_text": "Laws\n3. Laws\n\nThe Scientific Revolution ushered in a new type of knowledge, based in\nlaws of nature. Kant\u2019s natural philosophy thus gave that notion\na central place. In particular, he analyzed it, he used it to single\nout certain laws as fundamental, and he weaved it into his picture of\nsystematic science. We go over these aspects in turn.\n\nNomic import. For the Critical Kant, a law is a\njudgment, or proposition, that is necessary and\nimposed by a faculty of the mind\u2014specifically, the\nunderstanding or reason. In the realm of theoretical knowledge, laws\ndetermine the object they govern. (In contrast, laws of practical\nreason bind their subjects, by mandating an action or a maxim for\nbehavior.) There are several classes of Kantian laws: transcendental\n(e.g., the pure principles of the understanding); metaphysical (such\nas his three laws of mechanics); and empirical (in particular, the\nlaws of chemistry).\n\nThe above picture, which Watkins 2019 articulates and defends in\ndetail, gives center stage to the thought that laws are partially\ngrounded in the natures of knowers like us\u2014specifically, in the\nfaculties (and their a priori structures) that Kant investigated in\nthe First Critique. Other construals leave this key element out,\nand rely on other resources from his theoretical philosophy. Some have\nproposed a \u2018necessitarian\u2019 account, in which Kantian laws\nare grounded in the natures of the things they are about, thus\nnatures\u2014the bodies\u2019 essential properties and\npowers\u2014are their necessity-makers (Messina 2017, Massimi 2017,\nEngelhard 2018). Others think that certain propositions, or judgments,\ncount as laws in virtue of their place in a best-system ordering of\nour knowledge as directed by Kant\u2019s ideas of reason (see, e.g.,\nKitcher 1986 or Breitenbach 2018). These two interpretive approaches\nturn Kant into a precursor of two major contemporary notions of law,\nby Fred Dretske and David Lewis, respectively. Watkins argues that, if\nread carefully, Kant in fact offers a view that combines the\nstrengths of the two pictures above: it retains the necessitarian\ndimension while emphasizing the role of our acts\u2014of us qua\nspontaneous epistemic subjects\u2014in regard to nature as the object\nof unified experience (Watkins 2019, esp. Chapter 2).\n\nIn philosophy of physics, Kant privileged three laws: Conservation of\nMass, the Law of Inertia, and the Equality of Action-Reaction. He\nregarded them as fundamental for mechanics as he understood it, viz.\nqua theory of momentum exchanges, or \u2018communication of\nmotion.\u2019 And, these laws lie closest\u2014explanatorily and\nevidentially\u2014to the Analogies of Experience, the most general\nprinciples of theoretical knowledge, in his system. Specifically, the\nSecond Analogy is a key premise in his derivation of his \u2018second\nmechanical law.\u2019\n\nThough somewhat intermittently, Kant reflected as well on empirical\nlaws, viz. nomic judgments that govern some restricted class of\nobjects or properties given a posteriori. He thought that, to count as\na rational science, a body of knowledge must include empirical laws\nsystematically connected. In the last decade, this long-neglected\naspect of his doctrine has began to receive the attention it deserves.\nScholarship has tended to concentrate on two main aspects. One is\nKant\u2019s basis for counting certain propositions as empirical\nlaws. Some see them as earning that status in virtue of their place in a\nbest-system organization of our knowledge; others think they become\nlaws at a certain stage in the process of inquiry (provided the\ninquiry is guided by specific normative Kantian principles, e.g. his\nPostulates of Empirical Thinking). The other aspect is whether\nempirical laws count as knowable by Kant\u2019s lights. Here too, the\nfield appears divided in two camps. Some think that, pace his positive\naccount of empirical laws, knowledge of them is beyond our reach (see,\nfor instance, Kreines 2017). Others have argued that, under the right\nconditions, research can lead to the discovery of empirical laws in\nthat particular domain, e.g. chemical phenomena (see, for instance,\nMcNulty 2015 and Cooper 2023).\n\nHypotheses. Natural science after 1650 often relied\non \u2018hypotheses,\u2019 or knowledge claims for which evidence\nwas less than conclusive. In optics, electricity, magnetism, heat\nscience, chemistry, and natural history hypotheses were rampant.\nAccordingly, some early-modern figures (e.g. Christian Wolff and\nEmilie du Ch\u00e2telet) developed doctrines to address this fact\nabout science then. Kant did too. In particular, he sought to identify\nnormative criteria for acceptable hypotheses, viz. thresholds that\ncandidate hypotheses must meet if theorizing from them is to count as\nlegitimate. He defended for three such criteria in his\n\u2018Discipline of Pure Reason in regard to Hypotheses,\u2019 a\npart of the First Critique. The first is that a candidate hypothesis\nhas to be about things that are \u2018really possible\u2019 in\nKant\u2019s sense; namely, spatio-temporal objects and\nproperties. (This rules out, for one, hypotheses about God being the\n\u2018cause of gravity,\u2019 which some Newtonians had peddled in\nthe early 1700s). The second is that a hypothesis must be about\nobjects and processes causally connected\u2014more broadly,\nconnected via the categories of relation\u2014to \u201cthat which is\nactually given, and so is certain\u201d (B798). Helpful studies of\nKant\u2019s account of hypotheses in their scientific and\nphilosophical context are Leduc 2013, Vanzo 2013, McNulty 2015, Cooper\n2023, and Demarest & van den Berg 2022.\n",
