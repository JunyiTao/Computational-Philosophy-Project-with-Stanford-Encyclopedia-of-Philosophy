    "main_text": "The unity of the cosmos\n5. The unity of the cosmos\n\nAt least as usually understood the two terms \u2018nature\u2019 and\n\u2018God\u2019 have different and contrasting meanings. If they are\nidentified, it follows that one or both words are being used in a\ndifferent way than usual; that nature is more like God than commonly\nthought and/or that God is more like nature than commonly thought.\nWith respect to the cosmos this may be seen in the stress pantheists\ntypically put on the unity of the cosmos.\n\nA distinction may be drawn between distributive pantheism,\nthe view that each thing in the cosmos is divine, and collective\npantheism, the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine (Oppy\n1997). And if polytheism in general is coherent there is no reason in\nprinciple why we should exclude the possibility of a distributive\npantheism. But as in pursuit of explanatory unity and coherence belief\nin many Gods tends historically to give way to belief in single deity,\nwhile it would be technically possible to identify the universe with a\ncollection of deities, in practice monism tends to win out, and it has\nbeen characteristic of pantheists to stress heavily the unity of\nnature. Thus pantheism typically asserts a two-fold identity:\nas well as the unity of God and nature, it urges the unity of all\nthings with each other.\n\nIt may be asked whether a statement of the world\u2019s unity is a\nprecondition for asserting its identity with God, or a\nconsequence of asserting it? Is the intuition that the cosmos\nconstitutes a single integrated whole a contributory factor in\nthinking it divine, or (reflecting the traditional idea that God is\nunique and simple or without parts) is the intuition that it is divine\nthe reason for regarding it as such a unity?\n\nThe kind of unity which the pantheist thinks to find in nature can\nvary from a very strong metaphysical oneness, like that of Parmenides,\nwhich excludes all diversity or difference, to a much looser\nsystematic complex of distinct but inter-related elements, but the\nfour species of unity most commonly defended are: (1) the unity of all\nthat falls within the spatio-temporal continuum under a common set of\nphysical laws, (2) the reductive unity of a single material out of\nwhich all objects are made and within which no non-arbitrary divisions\ncan be made, (3) the unity of a living organism, or (4) the more\npsychological unity of a spirit, mind or person (see Cohoe 2020).\n",
