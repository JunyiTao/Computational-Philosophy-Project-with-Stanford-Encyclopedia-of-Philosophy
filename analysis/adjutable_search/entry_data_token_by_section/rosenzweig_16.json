    "main_text": "Life and Thought after The Star || The Little Book of Healthy and Sick Understanding\n4.2 The Little Book of Healthy and Sick Understanding\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s turn from philosophy to life, after completing\nthe Star, was dramatic and remarkable. Although Rosenzweig\ncontinued to think and write after the Star, he engaged in\nvery little philosophical writing, traditionally\nconceived\u2014an indication of both his satisfaction with the way\nthe\nStar expressed what he had to say, and the seriousness of his\ncommitment to turn away from philosophical writing and towards Jewish\nlife after having completed it.\n\n\nThere are two exceptions to Rosenzweig\u2019s turn away from philosophy\nproper. In 1925, Rosenzweig wrote an essay, \u201cThe New\nThinking,\u201d that offered an overview of the systematic structure\nand insights of the Star and which situated the book within\nthe movement of the \u201cnew thinking\u201d to which Rosenzweig\nunderstood himself to have contributed. Moreover, in the summer of\n1921, the year the Star was published, Rosenzweig was\ncommissioned by the Frommann Publishing House to write a popular\nintroduction to his philosophy. He produced \u201cThe Little Book of\nHealthy and Sick Human Understanding,\u201d a title which puns on the\nGerman term for \u201ccommon sense,\u201d \u201cgesunder\nMenschenverstand,\u201d in order to imply that philosophy\nbecomes sick when it deviates from the insights of common\nsense. Rosenzweig ended up so dissatisfied with the book that he\nrefused to have it published, but Nahum Glatzer edited and published\nthe book some forty years after it was written, first in an English\ntranslation and subsequently in the German original. The \u201clittle\nbook\u201d is noteworthy for the story it tells about a person who\nbecomes paralyzed by philosophical questioning: he cannot walk for\nfear there is no real \u201cground\u201d; his eyes won\u2019t see for\nfear all is a dream; his hands won\u2019t grasp for lack of any ultimate\nreason to do so.  Rosenzweig explains this paralysis as a result of an\nunhealthy reaction\u2014characteristic of philosophy\u2014to the\nhuman experience of wonder. In moments of awareness of ourselves, of\nothers, of the world, we may be struck by wonder in the midst of\nlife. When we allow life to unfold in time, Rosenzweig suggests, such\nwonder is resolved on its own: those relations which are the source of\nour wonder become part and parcel of the actual life we live. But\nphilosophy, Rosenzweig claims, cannot wait for wonder to resolve\nitself in the course of life.  Moreover, in the way that it questions\nthe source of its wonder\u2014\u201cwhat is\nthis x?\u201d\u2014philosophy ends up removing itself, and\nthe source of its wonder, from the flow of life.  Any answers it\nthereby receives for its questions no longer correspond to the very\ncourse of actual life in which alone they would be meaningful.\n\n\nTreatment for such philosophical paralysis, Rosenzweig claims, is\nnot to be sought in the philosophical pursuit of grounds, but rather in\nan appeal to common sense. The \u201chealthy\u201d character of\ncommon sense, according to Rosenzweig, derives from its inherent trust\nin the flow of temporal life, and in the language we use to describe\nthe things and persons we encounter within it. Common sense does not\nask \u201cwhat\u201d things are, Rosenzweig suggests, not because it\nlacks curiosity, but because it recognizes implicitly that all things\nand persons we encounter in life are part of a course of development in\nwhich alone they realize themselves as \u201cwhat\u201d they are. The\npatient can only emerge from his paralysis, then, by turning away from\nthe pursuit of essential grounds and regaining that trust that allows\nhim to reclaim his place in the flow of everyday life.\n",
