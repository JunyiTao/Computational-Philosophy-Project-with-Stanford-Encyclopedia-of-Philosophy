The Easy Arguments\nsucceed, but their success marks no great philosophical discovery and\nraises no hard questions of the sort that have traditionally bothered\nmetaphysicians of a nominalist bent.\n\nWe will here discuss only Stephen Schiffer\u2019s (2003) theory of\n\u201cpleonastic\n propositions.\u201d[9]\n\nPropositions exist, for Schiffer, but unlike rocks or cats, there is\nnothing more to them than what our concept of a proposition\nguarantees. One may call them \u201cabstract entities,\u201d if one\nlikes, but this label should not encourage the thought that our minds\ncan reach beyond the physical world to make contact with denizens of a\nPlatonic universe. We know about propositions, not by interacting with\nthem, as we do with rocks and cats, but by being participants in\ncertain sorts of linguistic or conceptual practice. It\u2019s because\nwe speak or think in certain ways that we are able to know about\npropositions.\n\nSchiffer argues, in effect, that given our proposition-talk and\nthought, propositions are, in D. M. Armstrong\u2019s phrase, a kind\nof \u201contological free lunch.\u201d That is, the key\n\u201caxioms\u201d of our proposition-talk and thought are\nguaranteed to be true. These include the instances of the equivalence\nschema (E) for propositions: The proposition that \\(p\\) is true\niff \\(p\\). Given the truth of such axioms, it follows that\npropositions exist and have the features attributed to them by our\naxioms. Moreover, because these axioms are constitutive of the concept\nof a proposition, it follows that, by possessing that concept, we can\nknow the truth of these axioms.\n\nOne might concede to Schiffer that the axioms are constitutive of our\nconcept of a proposition. But why think those axioms are true?\nSchiffer stresses that we do not make the axioms true by saying,\nthinking, or \u201cstipulating\u201d that they are true. The\nmind-independence of propositions, after all, is implicit in those\naxioms.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s argument for pleonastic propositions is of a piece\nwith his argument for pleonastic entities generally, including\nfictional entities, events, and properties. A pleonastic entity, for\nhim, is an entity that falls under a pleonastic concept. The latter is\nthe key notion and is defined as follows.\n\nDefinition: A concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic iff it implies true\nsomething-from-nothing transformations. \n\nA SFN (something-from-nothing) transformation (about \\(F\\)s) is a\nstatement that allows us to deduce a statement about a kind of entity\nF, from a statement that involves no reference to \\(F\\)s. (61) SFN\ntransformations assert a kind of supervenience condition on\n\\(F\\)s: if the relevant non-\\(F\\) conditions obtain, \\(F\\)s exist and\nhave the relevant features. (E.g., if snow is white, then the\nproposition that snow is white exists and is true.)\n\nIf the concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic, then there are \\(F\\)s. We need to\nknow how to tell if a concept is pleonastic. Here is Schiffer\u2019s\ntest:\n\nTest: A concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic (and so implies true\nsomething-from-nothing transformations) iff adding it to any theory\nyields a conservative extension of that theory. (57)\n\n\nSchiffer\u2019s final formulation of the conservativeness test\nis:\n\nFor any theory \\(T\\) and sentence \\(S\\) expressible in \\(T\\), if the\ntheory obtained by adding to \\(T_{/{\\sim}F} \\ltb\\)the theory resulting\nfrom restricting quantifiers in \\(T\\) to \\({\\sim}F\\)s\\(\\gtb\\) the\nconcept of an \\(F\\), together with its something-from-nothing\n\\(F\\)-entailment claims, logically entails \\(S_{{\\sim}F}\\ltb\\)the\nsentence resulting from restricting quantifiers in \\(S\\) to\n\\({\\sim}F\\)s\\(\\gtb\\), then \\(T_{/{\\sim}F}\\) logically entails\n\\(S_{{\\sim}F}\\). (p. 57)\n\n\nOne might think the conservativeness test is overly complicated, and\nthat all that matters is that the new entities not interfere with the\nempirical world. If so, then the test would mention only empirical\ntheories not all theories. But, as Matti Eklund (2007) points out, two\nkinds of entity that are individually non-interfering with respect to\nthe empirical world might interfere with one another. Schiffer is\naware of this problem (see his discussion of anti-fictional entities,\npp. 55\u20136), and this is why he turns to the more complicated\naccount.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s picture is this. If a concept satisfies the\nconservativeness test, then its instantiation would be unproblematic\nbecause it would interfere with nothing else. Its instantiation comes\nfor free. If a concept doesn\u2019t meet this test, it doesn\u2019t\ncome for free.\n\nAlthough Schiffer\u2019s view of propositions can be described as\ndeflationary in one sense (because it attempts to deflate questions\nabout the existence and nature of propositions), the meta-ontology\nunderlying Schiffer\u2019s approach is, if anything, inflationary:\nall \u201cnon-interfering\u201d kinds of entity are\ninstantiated.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s, and other deflationist theories, must, at a minimum,\nanswer the following two questions, in addition to the questions\nfacing all propositionalists:\n\n(1)\nWhy would the non-interference of \\(F\\)s be evidence for their\nexistence?\n\n\nEven if \\(F\\)s would be non-interfering in Schiffer\u2019s sense, the\npostulation of \\(F\\)s logically conflicts with some consistent\ntheories, e.g., \u2018There are no \\(F\\)s\u2019. Schiffer places\nseverer constraints on the denial of entities than on the acceptance\nof them. Suppose \\(F\\)s would be non-interfering. Then adding them\nwould not add information about non-\\(F\\)s. But suppose also that\ndenying \\(F\\)s would not add information about non-\\(F\\)s. Why\nisn\u2019t this a reason to deny \\(F\\)s? So, in this sense, the\ntheory denying \\(F\\)s passes a corresponding conservativeness\ntest.\n\n(2)\nHow can the deflationist explain how these propositions have\ntruth-conditions?\n\n\nIf the proposition that snow is white is a simple, necessary and\neternal object, why does its having a property (truth) have anything\nto do with concrete snow\u2019s having a property (whiteness)? Do\ninstances of the T-schema simply state brute necessary connections\nbetween abstract objects and concrete ones? Or do these necessary\nconnections somehow derive from our practices, and if so, how?\n",
