    "main_text": "Natural Deduction and Quantifiers || Issues with \\(\\forall\\)-Generalization and \\(\\exists\\)-Instantiation\n3.2 Issues with \\(\\forall\\)-Generalization and \\(\\exists\\)-Instantiation\n\nA number of textbooks (Quine 1950b, some editions of Copi 1954, and\nKalish & Montague 1964, are perhaps the best known) employ a\ndeviant set of quantifier rules. The simpler rules, \\(\\exists\\)-I and\n\\(\\forall\\)-E, are unchanged, but the two subproof-involving rules we\njust surveyed are replaced by rules which (following Quine) we will\nrefer to as Existential Instantiation (EI) and Universal\nGeneralization (UG):\n\nEI:\nfrom an existential quantification \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), an\ninstance, \\(A(a)\\) may be inferred, where \\(a\\) is a \\(A\\) term from a\nspecial \u201calphabet\u201d of terms. (Instantial Constant\nor Instantial Term are often used for this constant instead\nof parameter, etc.)\nUG:\nfrom an instance \\(A(a)\\), where \\(a\\) is one of the special\nterms, a universal quantification \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) may be\ninferred.\n\n\nUsed without restriction, such rules are obviously unsound: they would\nallow one to reason from the premise \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\) to the\nconclusion \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) in two steps! The rules are therefore\nhedged with restrictions on the particular instantial terms to be\nused. For a start, one cannot use the same instantial term in two\ndistinct quantifier instances in the same derivation, but by itself\nthis is not sufficient. Precise formulation of restrictions that will\nyield a sound and complete system of rules is not trivial:\nCopi\u2019s textbook ((1954)) went through several editions with\ndifferent incorrect systems, and Quine (1950a) changed the wording of\nthe restriction between editions of his textbook (though both versions\ngive correct systems). Several articles were published, both in\nspecialist logic journals and in general philosophical ones, noting\nerrors and offering analyses of the situation.\n\nThe ideas behind these rules seem to have no intrinsic connection with\nnatural deduction: they do not use subproofs (they replace the\nsubproof-involving quantifier rules of more standard systems), and\nthey could be used in conjunction with a purely axiomatic system of\npropositional logic. Their association with natural deduction is a\nmatter of historical accident: the textbooks introducing them\npresented systems with other features of natural deduction. Still,\nthey have some practical value: proofs employing (a correctly\nrestricted version of) them, in the context of a system for classical\nlogic, can be shorter and simpler than the proofs in systems with the\nstandard natural deduction rules. (The classically valid schemes\n\n\\[\\exists x(\\exists yF(y)\\rightarrow F(x))\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\exists x(F(x)\\rightarrow\\forall yF(y)),\\]\n\n\nfor example, have very short and obvious proofs using\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-I and the variant quantifier rules.) On the other\nhand, they cannot be used without change in systems for intuitionistic\nor modal logics, as we explain in\n \u00a76:\n the classical schemes mentioned above are not intuitionistically\nvalid, but their simple proofs go through in a system that adds the\nquantifier rules of Quine\u2019s textbook to a formalization of\nintuitionistic propositional logic, and natural attempts to use them\nin formulating systems of quantified modal logic lead to simple\nderivations of the Barcan principle and its converse. Lack of caution\nin using these (and related) rules in the context of non-classical\nlogics has led to errors in published philosophical articles.\n\nThe difficulty in formulating correct restrictions on these rules is\nconnected to the absence of any obvious semantic interpretation of the\ninstantial terms. Classically, the truth of \\(\\exists xF(x)\\) in a\nmodel implies that (if every element of the domain has a name) then\nthe quantification has a true instance, but not that we can identify\nwhich instance it is. Thus, when the rule of EI is used in a proof in\nan otherwise interpreted language, the person constructing the proof\nmay not be in a position to define the instantial term: it remains\nuninterpreted. A moderately complicated model theoretic account has,\nhowever, been developed by Fine (1985a,b), which allows proof of the\nsoundness of appropriately restricted EI and UG rules. (Those\ninterested in using these rules for practical purposes in giving short\nproofs should consult Fine\u2019s work: he gives streamlined\nstatements of the rules and restrictions, and provides a simple\nalgorithm, his dependency diagrams, for checking that the\ninstantial terms in a proof comply with the restrictions.) For those\nfamiliar with Hilbert\u2019s Epsilon Calculus (see Avigad & Zach\n2020), perhaps the easiest way of seeing the soundness of properly\nrestricted EI and UG is to think of the instantial terms as\nabbreviating \\(\\epsilon\\)-terms: the terms occurring in a proof that\ncomplies with the restrictions can be expanded to appropriate\n\\(\\epsilon\\)-terms, whereas such expansion is blocked when the\nrestrictions are violated (see Hazen 1987, for a more detailed\naccount). Cellucci (1995) gives an interesting discussion on a variety\nof rules related to EI and UG. Pelletier (1999) recounts the many\nre-formulations of the UG and EI rules in the early\n1950s\u20131960s.\n",
