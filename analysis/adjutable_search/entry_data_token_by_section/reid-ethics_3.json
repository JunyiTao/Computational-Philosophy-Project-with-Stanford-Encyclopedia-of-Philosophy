    "main_text": "The Rational Principles of Action\n2. The Rational Principles of Action\n\nPhilosophers such as Hume and Priestly were eager to apply\nNewton\u2019s methods to the moral domain. Reid, however, viewed\nattempts to use Newtonian methods to understand the moral domain as\nmistaken\u2014not, once again, because he viewed Newtonian science as\nsuspect, but because he held that Newton\u2019s methods themselves\nrequire this. That said, we have seen that there is a sense in which\nReid believes that human action is law-governed. We can regulate our\nbehavior by reference to the rational principles of action. Earlier we\nsaw that these principles are of two kinds: They concern our good on\nthe whole and duty. Reid holds that these principles stand in a\ncertain kind of relation to one another. We can better identify this\nrelation by having the notion of motivational primacy before\nus.\n\nSuppose we say that a state of affairs P has motivational\nprimacy for an (ordinary adult) agent S just in case three\nconditions are met. First, in a wide range of ordinary cases,\nP is a type of consideration in light of which S\nwould act. Accordingly, were S to deliberate about what to\ndo, P is a type of state of affairs that S would, in\na wide range of cases, not only use to \u201cframe\u201d his\npractical deliberations, but also endeavor to bring about. That my\nloved ones flourish is such a state of affairs for many of\nus.\n\nSecond, P is a sufficient reason for S to act.\nRoughly put, P is a sufficient reason for S to act\njust in case were S to deliberate about what to do, then (in\na wide range of ordinary cases) S would take P to be\na reason to act and would endeavor to bring about P even if\nhe believed (or presupposed) that his doing so would not bring about\n(or increase the likelihood of his bringing about) any further state\nof affairs that he values. Imagine, for example, S is like\nmany of us inasmuch as he takes himself to have a reason to bring\nabout the flourishing of his loved ones. This is a sufficient reason\nfor S to act since he would endeavor to bring about the\nflourishing of his loved ones even if he believed that his doing so\nwould not bring about any further state of affairs that he values,\nsuch as his gaining increased notoriety among his peers.\n\nThird, P has deliberative weight for S. For our\npurposes, we can think of this as the claim that P is a\nreason of such a type that, in a wide range of circumstances, were S\nto deliberate about what to do, then S would take P\nto trump other types of reasons, even other sufficient reasons. Many\nof us, for example, hold that there is a beautiful sunset on the\nhorizon is a sufficient reason to stop whatever we are doing and\nenjoy it. Still, for most of us, that an act would bring about or\npreserve the flourishing of our loved ones has greater deliberative\nweight than this. If a person had to choose between enjoying a\nbeautiful sunset, on the one hand, or protecting her child from\ndanger, on the other, then the latter reason trumps.\n",
