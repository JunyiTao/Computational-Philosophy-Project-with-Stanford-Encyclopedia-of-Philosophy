    "main_text": "Intelligent Design\n7. Intelligent Design\n\nLet us move on now from the more philosophical sorts of issues.\nBuilding on the more critical approach of Johnson, who is taken to\nhave cleared the foundations as it were, there is a group of people\nwho are trying to offer an alternative to evolution. These are the\nenthusiasts for so-called \u2018Intelligent Design.\u2019 Supporters\nof this position think that Darwinism is ineffective, at least\ninasmuch as it claims to make superfluous or unnecessary a direct\nappeal to a designer of some sort. These are people who think that a\nfull understanding of the organic world demands the invocation of some\nforce beyond nature, a force which is purposeful or at least purpose\ncreating. Often the phrase which is used is \u201corganized\ncomplexity,\u201d a term much used by the German Romantic philosopher\nFriedrich Schelling, and which by invoking the intentional predicate\n\u201corganized\u201d rather gives the game away (Richards\n2003). For the moment, continue to defer questions about the\nrelationship between Intelligent Design Theory and more traditional\nforms of Creationism.\n\nThere are two parts to this approach: an empirical and a\nphilosophical. Let us take them in turn, beginning with he who has\nmost fully articulated the empirical case for a designer, the\nalready-mentioned, Lehigh University biochemist Michael Behe. Focusing\non something which he calls \u2018irreducible complexity,\u2019 Behe\nwrites:\n\nBy irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several\nwell-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function,\nwherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to\neffectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be\nproduced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial\nfunction, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight,\nsuccessive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor\nto an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by\ndefinition nonfunctional. (Behe 1996, 39)\n\n\nBehe adds, surely truly, that any\n\nirreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would\nbe a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural\nselection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a\nbiological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise\nas an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to\nhave anything to act on (p. 39).\n\n\nNow turn to the world of biology, and in particular turn to the\nmicro-world of the cell and of mechanisms that we find at that level.\nTake bacteria which use a flagellum, driven by a kind of rotary motor,\nto move around. Every part is incredibly complex, and so are the\nvarious parts, combined. The external filament of the flagellum\n(called \u2018flagellin\u2019), for instance, is a single protein\nthat makes a kind of paddle surface contacting the liquid during\nswimming. Near the surface of the cell, just as needed is a\nthickening, so that the filament can be connected to the rotor drive.\nThis naturally requires a connector, known as a \u2018hook\nprotein.\u2019 There is no motor in the filament, so that has to be\nsomewhere else. \u2018Experiments have demonstrated that it is\nlocated at the base of the flagellum, where electron microscopy shows\nseveral ring structures occur\u2019 (p. 70). All, way too complex to\nhave come into being in a gradual fashion. Only a one-step process\nwill do, and this one-step process must involve some sort of designing\ncause. Behe is careful not to identify this designer with the\nChristian God, but the implication is that it is a force from without\nthe normal course of nature. Irreducible complexity spells design.\n",
