    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 Place in Greek Neoplatonism || Philosophy and theology\n2.3 Philosophy and theology\n\nIamblichus brought about a shift towards religion and theology in\nNeoplatonism which proved crucial for the later development of this\nmovement and for its Christian appropriation (see Lecerf and Taormina\n2022). The Reply to Porphyry, where Iamblichus rejects\nPorphyry\u2019s over-confident intellectualism in theological and\nreligious matters, is certainly our major source on debates in early\nNeoplatonism. Scholars have traditionally described Iamblichus\u2019\nstance as irrational, contrasting it with Plotinus and\nPorphyry\u2019s rational and philosophical approach (see Dodds 1951:\n285\u2013298). Recent scholarship, however, has effectively\nquestioned this view (see Tanaseanu-D\u00f6bler 2013). In his\nReply to Porphyry (I, 2 [SS-2013: 4.5\u20135.11]) Iamblichus\ndistinguishes three disciplines, each with its own distinctive\nmethods: philosophy, theology, and theurgy. Theurgy certainly goes\nbeyond reason and philosophy, but Iamblichus\u2019 appeal to theurgy\nand rituals is based on sophisticated philosophical views and\narguments dealing with the nature of divine beings and the status of\nhuman souls (see below,\n Section 6).\n It would therefore be misleading to draw a strict opposition between\ntheurgy and rational methods. What is distinctive about Iamblichus\nvis-\u00e0-vis Plotinian Platonism is the thorough\nintegration of theological traditions into his account of reality.\nThis emerges in two related areas. Whether or not he wrote a work by\nthis title, Iamblichus is the first Neoplatonist to develop a\n\u201cPlatonic theology\u201d (see Proclus, Platonic\nTheology III, 44.1\u20135 [Saffrey & Westerink\n1968\u20131997]). This approach will be carried further in Athenian\nNeoplatonism, especially by Proclus. Plotinus had already connected\nthe hypotheses about the One in the second part of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides with his distinction of metaphysical principles\n(see Enn. V, 1.8). Iamblichus goes one step further in that\nhe connects the metaphysical reading of this dialogue with the gods of\nthe Greek pantheon. His interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides can therefore be described not only as\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d but also as \u201ctheological\u201d. In\naddition to this, Iamblichus provides a harmonising account of the\ndifferent theological traditions, again paving the way for the later\ndevelopments in Athenian Neoplatonism (see below,\n Section 3.2).\n In his Reply to Porphyry Iamblichus establishes a triad of\nfoundational traditions: the Egyptian, the Chaldaic and the Greek,\nrepresented by the philosophical wisdom of Pythagoras and Plato. The\nterm \u201cChaldaic\u201d refers to the Chaldaean Oracles\n(see above,\n Section 2.2).\n The extant evidence suggests that Plotinus and Porphyry accorded\nlimited significance to the Oracles which, instead, become a\ncrucial source for Iamblichus: he wrote an extensive commentary on\nthis work and the revealed Platonizing theology of the\nOracles is an integral part of his thought. The Egyptian\ntradition is represented by the so-called Hermetic books and,\naccording to Iamblichus, this is the genuine source of Greek\nphilosophy (Reply to Porphyry I, 2 [SS-2013:\n4.7\u20139]).\n",
