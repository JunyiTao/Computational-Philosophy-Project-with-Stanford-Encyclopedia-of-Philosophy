But its specific\ntopic\u2014the \u201ccorrectness of names\u201d (orthot\u00eas\nt\u00f4n onomat\u00f4n)\u2014seems to have so little to do\nwith the concerns of modern philosophers of language that it needs\nsome introduction. The first thing to note is that the Greek term\nonomata (onoma in the singular), standardly\ntranslated as \u201cnames\u201d, denotes not only proper names and\ncommon nouns, but also adjectives and even verbs in infinitive and\nparticiple mood. When investigating the \u201ccorrectness of\nnames\u201d, the Cratylus attempts to ascertain why it is\ncorrect to use certain members of this motley class of linguistic\nitems to refer to certain elements of reality. Most of us would not\nhesitate to assert that correctness in this sense is a matter of\ndecision or convention. Saying that it is correct to\nuse the common noun \u201chorse\u201d to refer to horses can only\nmean, it seems, that \u201chorse\u201d is conventionally used in\nthis way. This appealing position, widely known as\nconventionalism, is not absent from the Cratylus: It\nis championed by Hermogenes, the dialogue\u2019s first protagonist.\nBut Cratylus, the dialogue\u2019s second protagonist, begs to differ.\nHe stubbornly espouses a rather cryptic naturalism, claiming\nthat a correct name for any given element of reality needs to fulfil\nan elusive natural standard. Socrates, the dialogue\u2019s third\nprotagonist, adjudicates on the contested issue.\n\nThe Cratylus is (in)famous for its surprising twists and\nturns, and it is often considered one of Plato\u2019s most vexing\nworks. It has also proven difficult to determine its place within\nPlato\u2019s oeuvre. As it introduces Platonic forms in a way that is\nreminiscent of the Phaedo, many commentators assume that it\nmust have been written in the same period as this dialogue (see, e.g.,\nRoss 1955; Luce 1964; Levin 2001: 4 n. 4). But it also provides a\nsomewhat preliminary treatment of issues that are discussed more fully\nin later dialogues like the Theaetetus and the\nSophist, and so a variety of alternative datings have been\ndiscussed (see, e.g., Kirk 1951; Mackenzie 1986; Sedley 2003:\n6\u201316). There is, however, another (and arguably more important)\nsense in which the Cratylus is hard to pin down: It is not\nclear how its main topic\u2014the correctness of names\u2014is\nconnected with Plato\u2019s other philosophical concerns. This is\nprobably the reason why this fascinating dialogue is often treated in\na cursory way in general discussions of Plato\u2019s philosophy.\n",
