Intention and the Good\n\nIf intention is a mental state in relation to which doing A\namounts to doing A intentionally, or with the further\nintention of doing B, that fact would unify the modes of\nintention with which we began. It would, however, tell us little about\nintending itself. Does this state involve desire? Belief about what\none is doing or what one is going to do? Evaluative judgement? Similar\nquestions arise for those who deny that intention is a mental state\nand explain it as being on the way to intentional action. Must I want\nto perform an action I am thus embarked upon? Believe that I am\nengaged in it? Hold it to be in some way good?\n\nIt is a matter of consensus in the philosophy of intention that\nintending to do A entails wanting to do A, in the\nmotivational sense for which the \u2018primitive sign of wanting is\ntrying to get\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 68). Doubts about\nthis entailment are attributed to ambiguities in \u2018desire.\u2019\nWhen I intend to do A reluctantly, from the motive of duty, I\nmay deny that I want to do it, but what I lack is\n\u2018appetite\u2019 not \u2018volition\u2019 (Davis 1984, pp.\n135\u201340; Thompson 2008, pp. 103\u20135).\n\nIntending is thus a \u2018pro-attitude\u2019 of some\nkind\u2014assuming, for simplicity, that intention is a mental state.\nIn his later work, Davidson specified this pro-attitude as \u2018an\nall-out, unconditional judgement that the action is desirable\u2019\n(Davidson 1978, p. 99). He made two further refinements. First, when\none is doing A intentionally, \u2018at least when the action\nis of brief duration, nothing seems to stand in the way of an\nAristotelian identification of the action with [all-out evaluative\njudgement]\u2019 (Davidson 1978, p. 99). Second, one counts as\nintending an action only if one\u2019s beliefs are consistent with\none\u2019s performing it; one cannot intend to do what one believes\nto be impossible (Davidson 1978, pp. 100\u20131).\n\nIn an influential critique, Bratman objects that choice is possible\neven when one knows that neither option is best (Bratman 1985,\n\u00a7(Bratman 1985, \u00a7V). One can decide between options that are\nequivalent (like the identical bales of hay that stumped Buridan\u2019s\nass) or that are \u2018on a par\u2019, in that neither is better or\nworse than the other, though they are too different to count as\nequally good. (On parity, see Chang 2002). If unconditional judgement\npresents its object as more desirable than any alternative,\nDavidson\u2019s theory wrongly prohibits such decisions. Eugene\nChislenko defends that implication, arguing that the practical problem\nis solved by allowing oneself to drift non-intentionally until one\noption stands out (Chislenko 2016). But while this might work for\nBuridan\u2019s ass, who finds himself slightly closer to one bale of hay\nthan the other, and so decides to eat it, it won\u2019t work for\ndecision-making under parity, where small improvements fail to break\nthe tie.\n\nAn alternative view identifies intention with the unconditional\njudgement that a given action is no less desirable than others. It\nthus permits me to intend either of two equivalent options. The\nproblem is that it permits me to intend both options, even if\nI know that they are incompatible. Against this, Bratman claims that\nit is irrational to intend A and intend B if one\ncannot rationally intend A-and-B, as when doing both\nis inconsistent with one\u2019s beliefs (Bratman 1985, \u00a7(Bratman\n1985, \u00a7V).\n\nA related objection is that we can fail to act, or intend, in\naccordance with our evaluations. In a typical case of\nakrasia, I conclude that I ought to quit, but decide to\ncontinue smoking instead. Davidson (1970) replied to this by\ndistinguishing \u2018all things considered\u2019 from\n\u2018unconditional\u2019 evaluative judgement. In\n\u2018conditional\u2019 or \u2018prima facie\u2019 judgements one\ntakes some body of considerations, r, to support A\nover B. All things considered judgement is the special case\nof this in which r includes all the considerations one holds\nrelevant. There is no inconsistency in judging that the sum of these\nparticular considerations favours A over B while\njudging that B is better than A, perhaps in light of\nother facts one has not explicitly considered. Since it is the latter\njudgement that constitutes intention, one can act intentionally\nagainst the former. This is how Davidson makes sense of my continuing\nto smoke.\n\nFew have been convinced by Davidson\u2019s account. Can\u2019t we\nact\u2014intentionally and without self-contradiction\u2014against\nan unconditional evaluative judgement? Or fail to intend in accordance\nwith one? (McDowell 2010 is a recent critic of Davidson on this score;\nChislenko 2020 argues that akrasia involves contradictory\nbeliefs.) Davidson himself concedes that \u2018A is better\nthan B, all things considered\u2019 entails\n\u2018A is better than B\u2019 if \u2018all\nthings considered\u2019 means \u2018all truths, moral and\notherwise\u2019 (Davidson 1970, p. 40). He may intend this to be\ntrivial, counting that fact that A is better than B\namong the relevant truths. But it is both plausible and non-trivial to\nclaim that A is better than B, in the relevant\nsense, if and only if the balance of reasons favours A over\nB, where the reasons are distinct from that evaluative fact.\nIf it is possible to grasp this connection, to hold that the balance\nof reasons favours quitting, and still not intend to quit,\nDavidson\u2019s theory must be false. (A consequence of this fact is\nthe need to distinguish weakness as akrasia, or acting\nagainst one\u2019s better judgement, from weakness as a failure of will;\nsee Holton 2009, Ch. 4.)\n\nIf we hope to defend an evaluative theory of intention, despite this\npossibility, we will have to equate intending with judgement of some\nother evaluative proposition, not entailed by claims about the balance\nof reasons (as in R\u00f6dl 2007, Ch. 2), distinguish kinds of\njudgement or ways of representing an action as to be done, one of\nwhich constitutes intending, the other of which we act against in\nakrasia (as in Tenenbaum 2007, Ch. 7), or otherwise weaken\nthe relationship between intention and the good (as in Shah 2008).\nWhichever way we go, we will need to motivate the evaluative theory.\nWhat is it about the role of intention in intentional action, or in\npractical reasoning, that requires it to take an evaluative shape?\nWhat is missing from theories of intention on which it does not?\n",
