    "main_text": "The Right to be Heard\n10. Summary\n\nOne important, indeed central, manner of understanding the moral\nstatus of the child is by questioning whether or not children have\nrights. It is normally thought that according to the\n\u2018will\u2019 theory of rights children cannot have rights,\nwhereas according to the \u2018interest\u2019 theory they can. It\nis, however, at least possible on the \u2018will\u2019 theory that\nchildren could have rights, albeit ones that are exercised by trustees\nor representatives.\n\nChild \u2018liberationists\u2019 claim that children have all the\nrights that adults do. Others deny this, either believing that\nchildren have no rights or believing that children have only some of\nthe rights which adults possess. Those who believe children have no\nrights deny that children are qualified as adults are to have rights.\nThey further argue that the ascription of rights to children manifests\na misunderstanding of what children are like and of the nature of\nfamily relationships. Those who deny children all or some of the\nrights possessed by adults nevertheless believe that children, as\nhumans, have a certain moral status that ought to be protected.\n\nThose who say that drawing a line between adults and children in\nrespect of their possession of rights is arbitrary may mean different\nthings. To deny that different capacities are progressively acquired\nat different ages is implausible. To insist that drawing a line as\nsuch is wrong ignores the point of doing so, and recourse to the\nalternative of a competency test is not appropriate or practicable. On\nthe standard view, children have welfare but not liberty rights,\nwhereas adults have both. Adults also have the right that their\nchildhood selves shall grow up to be adults of a certain sort.\nChildren do not have an interest in remaining in childhood.\n\nThe best-interest principle with all its problems of interpretation\nsits oddly alongside the rights that are accorded to the child,\nespecially that of a right to be heard in matters affecting its\ninterests. This right in turn is a substitute not a complement to the\nright of choosing for oneself, and the Gillick competence which\nqualifies a child to exercise its rights of decision-making is\narguably stringently defined.\n",
