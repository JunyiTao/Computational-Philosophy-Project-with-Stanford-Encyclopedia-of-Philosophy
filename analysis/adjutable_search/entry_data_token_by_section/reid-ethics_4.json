    "main_text": "The Rational Principles of Action || Reid\u2019s defense of The Hierarchy Thesis\n2.1 Reid\u2019s defense of The Hierarchy Thesis\n\nHaving introduced the notion of motivational primacy, we can now\nidentify a claim that is arguably the centerpiece of Reid\u2019s\ndiscussion of rational motivation, namely:\n\nThe Hierarchy Thesis: In any case in which an agent\nmust decide what to do, considerations of what is morally required\nshould have motivational primacy. Specifically, what is morally\nrequired of an agent should have motivational primacy over what he\ntakes to be his good on the whole.\n\n\nEudaimonist positions, such as those defended in the broadly\nAristotelian tradition, reject The Hierarchy Thesis. They maintain\nthat when an agent deliberates about what to do he assumes, or ought\nto assume, that considerations concerning his own well-being or\neudaimonia have motivational primacy in a very robust sense. Every act\nthat an agent performs, say eudaimonists, either is or should be taken\nfor the sake of his own happiness. Accordingly, if eudaimonism is\ntrue, an agent operates, or ought to operate, with the following\nprinciple of action selection: Perform only those actions that, to the\nbest of one\u2019s knowledge, positively contribute to one\u2019s\nown well-being or eudaimonia. Moreover, in so doing, an agent treats,\nor ought to treat, considerations concerning his own well-being as\nbeing both a sufficient reason to act and having deliberative weight.\nWhen asked: \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d an agent\u2019s\nultimate justification will, or ought to, appeal to the way in which\nacting in that fashion contributes to her own well-being.\n\nReid rejects eudaimonism thus understood. It is safe to assume that\nReid took Butler\u2019s attack on what we might call descriptive\neudaimonism to be decisive: There is no plausibility to the idea\nthat agents necessarily will their own happiness, as they understand\nit, for they can knowingly act in self-destructive ways (cf. EAP\nIII.ii.i: 95). But Reid realized that Butler\u2019s attack left\nprescriptive eudaimonism, or the view that the\npractically rational agent takes her own well-being to have\nmotivational primacy, relatively untouched. According to this view,\nwhatever may be the case about how agents actually act, they ought to\nview their own well-being as having motivational primacy.\n\nLike Butler, Reid did not wish to recommend a picture of agency\naccording to which agents should disregard or ignore their own\nwell-being. \u201cTo serve God and be useful to mankind, without any\nconcern about one\u2019s own good and happiness,\u201d Reid writes,\nis \u201cbeyond the pitch of human nature\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv:\n166). Indeed, Reid holds that, when properly understood, a concern for\none\u2019s good on the whole naturally leads to the acquisition of\nthe moral virtues, such as justice and benevolence (EAP III.iii.iii:\n163; see also EAP V.i). Still, Reid insists that our good on the whole\nought not to be the \u201conly regulating principle of human\nconduct\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 164). Why?\n\nFor four main reasons. First, Reid claims that \u201cthe greater part\nof mankind can never attain such extensive views of human life, and so\ncorrect a judgment of good and ill, as the right application of this\nprinciple requires\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 164). Reid\u2019s point\nhere is that a principle of action should be action-guiding. It should\nbe the sort of thing that, in a wide range of cases, an agent could\nconsult when determining what to do and thereby come to understand\nwhat she morally ought to do. The principles of morality are\naction-guiding. \u201cEvery man of common understanding,\u201d says\nReid, is such that he is capable of knowing his duty (EAP V.i: 277).\nBut gaining a conception of one\u2019s good on the whole, let alone\nan accurate one, and an understanding of what genuinely contributes to\nit, is something that is very difficult to do. It requires that one\n\u201cobserve the connections of things, and the consequences of our\nactions,\u201d thereby \u201ctaking an extended view of our\nexistence, past, present, and future\u201d (EAP III.iii.i: 153). Many\nordinary persons will have neither the time nor the ability to do\nthis, let alone actually gain an accurate notion of that in which\ntheir good on the whole consists. If this is right, however, then\none\u2019s good on the whole is not sufficiently action-guiding to be\nthe most general and fundamental principle of action, as eudaimonists\nclaim.\n\nSecond, since one\u2019s good on the whole is concerned not only with\npresent satisfaction, but also with the enjoyment of future goods, it\nproves not to be as motivationally charged as one might hope. We would\nlike to have a clearer and more efficacious guide to conduct. Reid\nputs the point thus:\n\nMen stand in need of a sharper monitor to their duty than a dubious\nview of distant good. There is reason to believe, that a present sense\nof duty has, in many cases a stronger influence than the apprehension\nof distant good would have of itself. And it cannot be doubted, that a\nsense of guilt and demerit is a more pungent reprover than the bare\napprehension of having mistaken our true interest. (EAP III.iii.iv:\n165)\n\n\nDuty is, then, according to Reid, in many cases, a better guide to\naction than interest. Moreover, it is often motivationally more\npowerful than an appeal to interest, as it connects more intimately\nwith powerful motivating considerations such as one\u2019s own\nguilt.\n\nThe third point that Reid makes is that \u201ca steady pursuit of our\nown good may, in an enlightened mind, produce a kind of virtue which\nis entitled to some degree of approbation, yet it can never produce\nthe noblest kind of virtue, which claims our highest love and\nesteem\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 165). So, Reid\u2019s view is not that\na concern for one\u2019s own well-being is crass egoism or\nself-centeredness. To the contrary, there is something admirable about\nit; to pursue one\u2019s own well-being properly requires virtue. For\nexample, if concern for one\u2019s self is such that it helps one to\ndiscount temptations to a life of ease, leisure, or frivolity, then it\nis much to be admired (cf. EAP III.iii.iv: 165; but also cf. EAP V.vi:\n272). That said, to be genuinely dedicated to the moral life, one\ncannot grant motivational primacy to one\u2019s good on the whole.\nFor our esteem, Reid writes, \u201cis due only to the man whose soul\nis not contracted within itself, but embraces a more extensive object:\nwho loves virtue, not for her dowry only, but for her own sake: whose\nbenevolence is not selfish, but generous and disinterested\u201d (EAP\nIII.iii.iv: 166). For Reid, then, virtue requires caring not only\nabout particular persons (they are, according to Reid, the objects of\nbenevolence), but also about virtue itself. Being virtuous requires\nbeing committed to the idea that the moral life is, in and for itself,\nworth living. It is not to be made subordinate to considerations about\none\u2019s well-being.\n\nReid\u2019s fourth point echoes one of Butler\u2019s most famous\nobservations regarding the pursuit of happiness: If one primarily aims\nto secure one\u2019s own happiness, one often increases the risk of\nnot obtaining it. This is not only because directly aiming for\none\u2019s own happiness can \u201cfill the mind with fear, and\ncare, and anxiety\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 167). It is also because a\n\u201cconcern for our own good is not a principle that, of itself,\ngives any enjoyment\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 166). What does give\nenjoyment, however, are those particular activities and objects to\nwhich our affections are directed, such as friendship and the common\ngood. To achieve one\u2019s good on the whole, then, one must, at\nleast part of the time, be focused on and motivated by considerations\nthat are not identical with it.\n\nEarlier we said that a consideration has motivational primacy for an\nagent just in case the following three conditions are met: First, it\nis a type of consideration in light of which an ordinary adult agent\nwould act in a wide array of cases; second, it is a sufficient reason\nfor that agent; and, third it has deliberative weight for him.\nEudaimonists believe that one\u2019s good on the whole has\nmotivational primacy. Indeed, they believe that one\u2019s good on\nthe whole has motivational primacy in a very robust sense.\nEudaimonists hold that every act that an agent performs is,\nor should be, taken for the sake of his own happiness and that there\nis, or should be, no deeper practical justification for so acting.\nReid maintains that eudaimonism thus understood is false. In many\ncases, agents do not act for the sake of their good on the whole. Nor,\nin many cases, should they do so. For one thing, appealing to\none\u2019s good on the whole is insufficiently action-guiding, since\nmany agents simply do not have an adequate understanding of that in\nwhich it consists. For another, to make happiness the final court of\nappeal when deliberating is to undermine the rightful primacy of\nvirtue.\n\nThere is a substantial challenge facing views such as Reid\u2019s.\nConsider a case in which considerations of well-being conflict with\nduty, such as when moral duty requires that one stand up for the\ninnocent at the cost of one\u2019s life and those of one\u2019s\nfamily. Reid is committed to the claim that, in a case such as this,\none is required to surrender one\u2019s life. Could that be right?\nReid insists that it is. For any such conflict, Reid says, is\n\u201cimaginary\u201d (EAP III.iii.viii: 194). So long as \u201cthe\nworld is under a wise and benevolent administration, it is impossible,\nthat any man should \u2026 be a loser by doing his duty.\u201d\nReid\u2019s theism, in short, grounds his allegiance to The Hierarchy\nThesis. God guarantees that the two principles of action never come\ninto genuine conflict since performing one\u2019s duty will not\ndetract from one\u2019s good on the whole in the long run (see Cuneo\n2010).\n",
