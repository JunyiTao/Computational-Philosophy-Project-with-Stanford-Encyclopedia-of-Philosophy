    "main_text": "Logic || The Subject Matter and the Division of Logic\n3.1 The Subject Matter and the Division of Logic\n\nLike most thirteenth-century commentators on the Logica vetus\n(Boethius\u2019s Latin translations of Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De\ninterpretatione, together with Boethius\u2019s commentaries on\nthese texts), Simon of Faversham begins his commentary with a\nprologue, which treats of the subject matter of logic and the division\nof logic, corresponding to the division of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon into eight(!)\n treatises.[4]\n\nSimon belongs to the logical tradition of the last quarter of the\nthirteenth-century, which considers the subject matter of logic to be\nthe methods of knowledge acquisition (modi sciendi): the\nintellectual operations whereby we can proceed from something known to\nthe knowledge of something unknown. These methods are definition,\ndivision, and, most importantly, syllogistic reasoning (In\nIsag.: prologue). Accordingly, logic is neither a purely\ntheoretical science, as it does not consider essences or quiddities,\nnor a purely practical science, as its aim is not practical action. As\na science, logic is rather instrumental to the proper functioning of\nthe theoretical sciences (In Isag.: q.1).\n\nAs it is commonly the case, Simon also holds that logic is about\nlogical intentions (cf. In Isag.: q.2). But Simon\u2019s\nlogic of intentions is not nearly as developed as what we find in\nlater masters such as Radulphus Brito. Logical intentions are notions\nthat can be applied to the knowledge of quiddities. According to\nSimon, the intellect forms these intentions from the ways things\npresent themselves to it (i.e., from apparentia). Thereafter,\nthe intellect attributes different intentions to different things\naccording to different properties. For instance, after having noticed\nthat some ways of being are common to several things, the intellect\nforms the logical intention of species, after which the intellect can\napply this intention to the concept of man and express this act with\nthe assertion \u2018man is a species\u2019. Consequently, despite\nnot being a theoretical science, logic is ultimately grounded in the\nproperties of things from which logical intentions are taken (In\nIsag.: q.2). \n\nAs regards the division of logic, which is more precisely a division\nof syllogistic reasoning, Simon\u2019s commentary is noteworthy in\none regard: following in the footsteps of Giles of Rome, Simon\nconsiders rhetoric and poetics to be parts of logic, i.e., to function\nby way of syllogisms. A syllogistic argument is divided based on the\nvarying degrees of certainty of its premises (In Isag.:\nprologue). It is also remarkable that, in his commentary on the\nSophistical Refutations, Simon includes the alethic modality\nof the conclusion as a further criterion for the division of\nsyllogistic reasoning (In SE: prologue). Hence, if the\nstarting point of reasoning is a mere suspicion\n (suspicio),[5]\n the syllogistic reasoning is rhetorical and the conclusion will also\nbe a suspicion (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nRhetoric). If it \u201cproceeds from fictitious elements\nthat portray horror or pleasure\u201d (In Isag.: prologue),\nthe reasoning is poetic and the conclusion will be an estimation\n(aestimatio) (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nPoetics). If it proceeds from probable knowledge, the\nreasoning is dialectical and the conclusion will be an opinion or\nbelief (such reasoning is dealt with in the Topics). If it\nproceeds from the knowledge of essential causes and proper attributes,\nthe reasoning is demonstrative and the conclusion will be certain and\ninfallible knowledge (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nPosterior Analytics). Finally, if it proceeds from knowledge\nthat seems to be true, but is not, the reasoning is sophistical and\nthe conclusion will be an error (deceptio) (such reasoning is\ndealt with in the Sophistical Refutations).\n\nIn addition to this division of syllogistic reasoning into five kinds,\nlogic also studies common aspects of syllogistic reasoning, the moods\nand figures of the Prior Analytics.\n\nFinally, logic is also concerned with the simple thoughts out of which\nthe premises of syllogistic reasoning are composed. In the\nCategories, those simple thoughts are considered insofar as\nthey are related to a category of being. In the De\ninterpretatione those same concepts are considered insofar as\nthey are the subject and predicate of a mental composition or division\n(In Isag.: prologue).\n",
