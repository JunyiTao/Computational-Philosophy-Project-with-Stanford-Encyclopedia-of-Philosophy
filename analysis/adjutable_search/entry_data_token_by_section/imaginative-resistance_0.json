    "main_text": "The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance: The Origins\n1.1 The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance: The Origins\n\nThe label \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d is given to the\nphenomenon for the first time in 1994 by Richard Moran, in his article\n\u201cThe Expression of Feeling in Imagination\u201d. It is this\narticle by Moran, as well as Kendall Walton\u2019s article from the\nsame year, \u201cMorals in Fiction and Fictional Morality\u201d,\nthat have ignited the interest in imaginative resistance. These\narticles respectively grow out of Moran\u2019s talk at the 1992\nAmerican Society for Aesthetics Annual Meeting\u2014then titled\n\u201cArt, Imagination, and Resistance\u201d\u2014and\nWalton\u2019s commentary on Moran\u2019s talk. Moran\u2019s main\naim in \u201cThe Expression of Feeling in Imagination\u201d is to\ncriticize Walton\u2019s account of fictional emotions and more\nspecifically what Moran perceives as a discontinuity in the account\nbetween the uses of imagination in our real-life engagements and in\nour engagements with fictional works. In doing so, he discusses a\nspecial phenomenon\u2014he dubs it \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d\u2014that, he believes, helps him to problematize\nWalton\u2019s account. Walton himself mentions the phenomenon in his\n1990 book Mimesis as Make-believe and describes it as a\ncurious psychological reluctance to allow fictional worlds to differ\nfrom the actual world in certain moral aspects (see Walton 1990:\n154\u20135). However, this is not the first time this phenomenon is\ndiscussed in philosophical aesthetics. \n\nWalton refers to David Hume as the first philosopher to diagnose the\nphenomenon of imaginative resistance. All of Hume\u2019s remarks on\nimaginative resistance take place in few paragraphs towards the end of\nhis essay \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d (1757). There, Hume\nstates that, even though it requires some effort, we can still engage\nwith artworks that depict variations or deviations from what we are\naccustomed to, such as \u201cprincesses carrying water from the\nspring, and kings and heroes dressing their own victuals\u201d or any\nother \u201cinnocent peculiarities of manners\u201d and\n\u201cspeculative errors\u201d (1757 [1875: 245\u20136]). However,\nhe claims, there is a stark contrast between the ease of our\nengagement with such works and with works that depict moral deviations\nwithout proper approbation and blame. He writes,\n\n\nwhere the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another,\nand where vicious manners are described, without being marked with the\nproper characters of blame and disapprobation; this must be allowed to\ndisfigure the poem, and to be a real deformity. I cannot, nor is it\nproper I should, enter into such sentiments; and however I may excuse\nthe poet, on account of the manners of his age, I never can relish the\ncomposition. (1757 [1875: 246\u20137])\n\n\nHume\u2019s view is not merely that we resist engaging with works\nthat depict certain moral content that we disapprove of. Rather, the\nlack of blame or disapprobation on the side of the author is what we\nfind bothersome and it requires \u201ca very violent effort\u201d on\nthe side of the audience to \n\n\nchange\u2026 [their] judgment of manners, and excite sentiments of\napprobation or blame, love or hatred, different from those to which\nthe mind from long custom has been familiarized. (247) \n\n\n(See Walton 1994, Dadlez 2002, Gendler 2006, Dorsch 2016: 48\u201351\nfor more detailed examinations of Hume\u2019s remarks.) \n\nTwo things informed contemporary philosophers\u2019 initial\ncharacterization of imaginative resistance. The first is the curious\nasymmetry Hume detected between imagining morally and nonmorally\ndeviant content. The second is the blurring of the division between\nwhat is actual and what is fictional when it comes to depictions of\nmoral deviance (see Moran 1994, Walton 1994, Gendler 2000, Currie\n2002, Matravers 2003). Gendler identifies \u201cthe puzzle of\nimaginative resistance\u201d as \u201cthe puzzle of explaining our\ncomparative difficulty in imagining fictional worlds that we take to\nbe morally deviant\u201d (2000: 56). She further elaborates on the\npuzzle by pointing out the relative restrictions imposed on the\nauthor\u2019s authority to make things true in the world of the\nmorally deviant fiction: even though the author seems to exercise a\ngreat deal of freedom when it comes to depictions of such things as\nflying cars and talking mice, it is rather puzzling that this freedom\nseems to be taken away or restricted once the author describes,\nlet\u2019s say, female infanticide or slavery as morally correct. In\nthese cases, she claims, we experience a \u201cdoubling of the\nnarrator\u201d (2000: 64). We regard the moral justification of\nfemale infanticide or slavery not as true in the story but as\nmerely something that the narrator thinks. It is as if we\nwant to respond to the narrator by saying \u201cThat\u2019s what you\nthink\u201d. What is puzzling is that in these special cases we\nbecome so aware of narrators themselves that it undermines the whole\npractice of producing and consuming fiction.\n",
