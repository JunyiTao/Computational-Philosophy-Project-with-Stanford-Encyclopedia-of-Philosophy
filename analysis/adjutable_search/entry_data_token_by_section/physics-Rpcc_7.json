Technical Results on Common Causes Relevant for Assessing the Status of RCCP\n\nA classical probability measure space is a triplet \\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\),\nwhere X is the set of elementary random events, \\({\\cal S}\\) is\na Boolean algebra of some subsets of X and p is the\nadditive probability measure from \\({\\cal S}\\) into the unit interval\n\\([0,1]\\). The probability measure space \\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\) is called\ncommon cause complete if there exists a common cause C\nin \\({\\cal S}\\) of every correlated pair \\((A,B)\\) of elements \\(A,B\\)\nin \\({\\cal S}\\), common cause incomplete otherwise. One can\nshow that common cause (in)completeness can be characterized in terms\nof the measure theoretic (non)atomicity of probability measure spaces:\n\\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\) is common cause complete if and only if \\((X,{\\cal\nS},p)\\) contains at most one measure theoretic atom (Gyenis &\nR\u00e9dei 2011). A measure theoretic atom is an element \\(A_0\\) in\n\\({\\cal S}\\) such that \\(p(A_0)\\not=0\\), and, if \\(B\\subset A_0\\),\nthen \\(p(B)=0\\). In particular measure theoretically purely non-atomic\nprobability measure spaces (i.e., probability spaces that do not\ncontain any measure theoretic atom) are common cause complete (Gyenis\n& R\u00e9dei 2011; Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al. 2013; Marczyk &\nWro\u0144ski 2015). An example of a measure theoretically purely\nnon-atomic probability measure space is the unit interval \\([0,1]\\)\nwith the uniform probability (Lebesgue measure) on the Lebesgue\nmeasurable subsets of \\([0,1]\\); a class of examples are probability\nmeasures on the (Lebesgue measurable subsets of the) real line where\nthe probability is given by a density function with respect to the\nLebesgue measure on the real line.\n\nA common cause incomplete probability space \\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\) is\ncalled common cause completable if it can be embedded into a\nlarger probability space \\((X',{\\cal S}',p')\\) that is\ncommon cause complete. An embedding of \\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\) into\n\\((X',{\\cal S}',p')\\) is an injective Boolean algebra\nhomomorphism h from \\({\\cal S}\\) into \\({\\cal S}'\\) such\nthat \\(p'(h(A))=p(A)\\) for all A in \\({\\cal S}\\). One can\nshow that every probability space \\((X,{\\cal S},p)\\) can be embedded\ninto a purely nonatomic probability space. This entails that every\ncommon cause incomplete probability space is common cause completable\n(Gyenis & R\u00e9dei 2011; Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al. 2013;\nMarczyk & Wro\u0144ski 2015).\n\nIn quantum theory one uses non-classical (quantum) probability spaces\nto describe quantum physical systems. A general quantum probability\nspace is a pair \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\), where \\({\\cal P}\n({\\cal N})\\) is the orthocomplemented, orthomodular lattice of\nprojections of a non-commutative von Neumann algebra \\({\\cal N}\\) and\n\\(\\phi\\) is a countably additive probability measure on \\({\\cal P}\n({\\cal N})\\), which is the restriction to \\({\\cal P} ({\\cal N})\\) of a\nnormal state on \\({\\cal N}\\). R\u00e9dei & Summers (2007a)\nprovides a brief description of non-commutative probability theory in\nterms of von Neumann algebras; Landsman (2017) contains an\nencyclopedic treatment of the algebraic structures relevant for\nquantum theory; the SEP entry on\n quantum theory and mathematical rigor\n gives a very brief informal introduction to some basic facts on von\nNeumann algebras, including their Murray-von Neumann classification,\nwhich is relevant from the perspective of the Common Cause\nPrinciple\u2014see below). A special example of a quantum probability\nspace is obtained by taking the set of all bounded operators \\({\\cal\nB} ({\\cal H} )\\) on a (possibly infinite dimensional) Hilbert space\n\\({\\cal H}\\) as the von Neumann algebra and \\(\\phi\\) a quantum state\ngiven by a density matrix. The resulting specific quantum probability\nspace \\(({\\cal P}({\\cal B}({\\cal H})),\\phi)\\) is known as the\n\u201cHilbert space formalism\u201d of quantum mechanics; this space\ndescribes quantum systems of finite degrees of freedom. The\northomodular lattice \\({\\cal P}({\\cal B}({\\cal H}))\\), frequently\ndenoted as \\({\\cal P} ({\\cal H})\\), is the set of all projections on\n\\({\\cal H}\\), this lattice is also called \u201cHilbert\nlattice\u201d.\n\nThe concept of correlation between commuting projections \\(A,B\\) in\n\\({\\cal P} ({\\cal N})\\) and the notion of common cause of such\ncorrelations as a projection C commuting with both A and\nB and satisfying the (analogues) of the\n four Reichenbachian conditions (2)\u2013(5)\n make perfect sense in quantum probability spaces. So do the concepts\nof common cause (in)completeness, common cause completability (with a\nsuitably defined embedding of orthomodular lattices), measure\ntheoretic atoms and measure theoretic non-atomicity.\n\nOne can show that common cause completeness of such quantum\nprobability spaces can be characterized in terms of measure theoretic\natomicity of \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\) in complete analogy with\nthe classical case: \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\) is common cause\ncomplete if it contains at most one measure theoretic atom (Kitajima\n2008; Gyenis & R\u00e9dei 2014; Kitajima & R\u00e9dei\n2015). This entails that measure theoretically purely non-atomic\nquantum probability spaces are common cause complete. Specifically,\nquantum probability spaces \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\) with a type\nIII or type II von Neumann algebra \\({\\cal N}\\) are common cause\ncomplete because the quantum probability spaces defined by these types\nof von Neumann algebras are purely measure theoretically non-atomic.\nThe quantum probability space \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal H}),\\phi)\\) is not\npurely nonatomic, it contains a lot of measure theoretic atoms: all\nthe rank-one projections (equivalently: one dimensional linear spaces\nspanned by vectors in \\({\\cal H}\\)) are atoms of the Hilbert lattice\n\\({\\cal P} ({\\cal H})\\), hence all rank-one projections that are\nassigned non-zero probability by state \\(\\phi\\) are also measure\ntheoretic atoms in \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\). Thus \\(({\\cal P}\n({\\cal H}),\\phi)\\) is not common cause complete. Whether common cause\nincomplete quantum probability spaces are common cause completable, is\nnot known; results are available on common cause\nextendability of quantum probability spaces only: Every\nquantum probability space \\(({\\cal P} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\) is embeddable\ninto a larger quantum probability space \\(({\\cal P}({\\cal\nN}'),\\phi')\\) in such a way that every correlation in \\(({\\cal\nP} ({\\cal N}),\\phi)\\) has a common cause in \\(({\\cal P}({\\cal\nN}'),\\phi')\\) (Hofer-Szab\u00f3, R\u00e9dei, &\nSzab\u00f3 1999; 2013: 62, Proposition 6.3).\n\nThe philosophical significance of common cause completability and\ncommon cause extendability of (classical and quantum) probability\nspaces is that they show that it is always possible in principle to\nexplain any correlation, hence also any correlation between causally\nindependent events, in terms of (possibly hidden) common\ncauses\u2014hidden in the sense that the common causes need not be in\nthe probability space that contains the correlation: the common causes\ncan be \u201chiding\u201d in a larger probability space. Thus these\ncommon cause completability and common cause extendability results\nconstrain the possible ways of attempts to falsify the Common Cause\nPrinciple: Any attempt at falsification should impose some further\nconditions on the common causes in addition to the four defining\n conditions (2)\u2013(5),\n otherwise falsification can be evaded by referring to hidden common\ncauses. Formulated differently: The Common Cause Principle, as\nformulated exclusively in terms of the notion of a Reichenbachian\ncommon cause, either in a classical or in a quantum probability\ntheory, is not falsifiable. This does not mean that the common cause\nextendability results can be regarded as proof that the Common Cause\nPrinciple is true: Even the weaker question of whether a common cause\nextendability result can be taken as confirming evidence for the\nCommon Cause Principle depends on whether the extended probability\nmeasure space, existence of which is warranted by the mathematical\ncommon cause extendability results, is (part of) an empirically\nconfirmed scientific theory.\n\nThe significance of common cause complete spaces is that they display\na very strong compliance with the Common Cause Principle: An\nequivalent formulation of the Common Cause Principle is that\nprobability theories describing the world are causally closed in the\nfollowing sense: if A and B are correlated and are\ncausally independent, \\(R_{ind}(A,B)\\) in notation, then the\ncorrelation has to have a common cause that explains the correlation.\nCommon cause complete spaces are causally closed in the extremely\nstrong sense that the causal independence relation \\(R_{ind}(A,B)\\)\ncan be taken to be the strongest one, containing all correlated\nevents. Thus, if a scientific theory describing some aspect of reality\nuses a measure theoretically purely non-atomic probability space, such\na theory can be regarded as evidence in favor of the Common Cause\nPrinciple because that theory contains common causes of all\ncorrelations, including correlations that are between events that the\ntheory might regard as causally unrelated (independent). In view of\nthe interpretation of common cause completeness, common cause\ncompletability and common cause extendability, it is a relevant\nquestion whether our well-confirmed scientific theories are causally\nclosed or common cause extendable. Quantum field theory and standard\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics are two theories for which this\nquestions has been analyzed extensively.\n",
