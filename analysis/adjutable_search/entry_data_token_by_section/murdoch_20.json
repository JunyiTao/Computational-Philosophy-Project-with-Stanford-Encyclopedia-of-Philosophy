    "main_text": "The Absence of Social Sources of Negative Moral Formation in Murdoch\u2019s Philosophy\n12. The Absence of Social Sources of Negative Moral Formation in Murdoch\u2019s Philosophy\n\nMurdoch\u2019s failure to theorize passive forces in moral formation\nis also expressed in a striking absence of attention to the distinctly\nsocial sources of negative moral formation. An important part\nof how moral formation is, as she says, going on all the time, how our fabric of\nbeing is always being constructed, arises from social rather than\nintrapsychic factors, for example, representations of categories of\npersons that block or hinder agents\u2019 abilities to see the\nreality of persons in those groups. As a member of a given society, or\nparticular subcultures within that society, we are subjected to\nstereotypes and other misleading representations of different groups\nof people, with whom we do or do not come in contact. The stereotypes\nare attached to race, gender, class, religion, national origin, sexual\norientation, age, gender expression, professions and occupations,\nresidence in certain neighborhoods or regions, and other social\ngroups. These \u201cfigurations\u201d, as Diana Meyers usefully\ncalls them, are almost always evaluative in character (Meyers 1994).\nThus they contribute to social agents\u2019 evaluative take on the\nworld and to the formation of their moral being. They affect whether\nwe do, or try to, have loving attention, respect, compassion, and even\nmere acknowledgment toward individual members of those groups. In this\nrespect figurations are comparable to the fantasies and other forms of\negoism that Murdoch points to that block loving attention\u2014except\nthat they affect our responses to people unknown to us much more than\nthese Freudian intrapsychic forces do. Social stereotypes are not the\nonly form of socially-produced barrier to loving attention, but they\nare important and can represent the larger category for our\n purposes.[8]\n\nWe are largely passive with respect to the impact of these figurations\non our moral being, often not even recognizing their existence, as\nrecent work on \u201cimplicit bias\u201d\u2014unconscious ways we\nsee members of particular groups in negative or positive lights (Saul\n& Brownstein\n 2016)\u2014demonstrates.[9]\n We do not generally choose to embrace these figurations of the groups\nin question, nor are they generally (though perhaps they can sometimes\nbe) generated through (attempt) attention towards groups or\nindividuals. If we notice them at all, we often just find ourselves\npossessing them (Blum 2012).\n\nSocial figurations may not clear the bar for contributions to our\nmoral formation that Murdoch sets up in the quote above from DPR. They\nmay seem more like a fear that we do not endorse. Indeed figurations\ncan be a source of such fears, such as a stereotype of black males as\nthreatening, and can function even if the agent has not embraced their\ncognitive content. Murdoch\u2019s notion of \u201cfabric of\nbeing\u201d is never sufficiently defined so as to make entirely\nclear whether any item in our mental universe is actually excluded\nfrom it. But we can rely on an intuitive sense that if a stereotype\nsubstantially affects how the agent perceives and experiences persons\nof group X, and the agent has not attempted to rid herself of\nthe stereotype or neutralize its effect on her, then the stereotype\ncontributes to or is part of her moral being (as a passive\nfactor).\n\nThese social forces, explored by the more recent development of\n\u201csocial epistemology\u201d, complement the intrapsychic ones as\npassive contributors to moral formation. The \u201cgoing on all the\ntime\u201d that constitutes our moral formation and being is a\ncomplex combination of passive and active elements and processes. In\nseveral essays in the late 1950s Murdoch mentions the idea of\n\u201cconvention\u201d, and sometimes sees conventions or\nconventional thinking as a barrier to adequate perception (Holland\n2012). But convention does not capture the idea of distinct\nfigurations of particular groups of persons that are powerful forces\nin the culture and society harming social beings\u2019 ability to see\nthe reality of members of those specific groups. These obstacles have\nan entirely different source than the intrapsychic forces with which\nMurdoch is concerned (Clarke 2012: 244f; Blum 2012). The two can\ncomplement and interact, as M\u2019s class-based snobbery\nmakes common cause with her jealousy of D to cast the latter in\nthe negative light that Murdoch describes. There is strong support in\nMurdoch\u2019s writing for Nussbaum\u2019s claim that \n\n\nMurdoch seems almost entirely to lack interest in the political and\nsocial determinants of a moral vision and in the larger social\ncritique that ought\u2026to be a major element in the struggle\nagainst one\u2019s own defective tendencies. (Nussbaum 2001: 32) \n\n\nThis is not, however, to deny Clarke\u2019s point that\nMurdoch\u2019s view of attention and moral perception leave room for\nself-reflective criticism within which such a social critique could be\nlodged (Clarke 2012). But the point is not only that Murdoch neglects\nsocial and political factors in moral formation but that her\nprivileging of the active and neglecting the passive is a theoretical\nunderpinning of this neglect.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s stated view that our attempt attention is the\nvirtually sole source of our fabric of being suggests an ambiguity in\nwhat she means when she says that morality or moral life is\n\u201csomething that goes on continually\u201d (IP: 37/329), not\nonly in moments of actional choice. She definitely means that\nmoral activity is going on all the time, a view connected\nwith her expanding the domain of \u201cactivity\u201d beyond its\nconventional understanding as the public world of action, to include\nthe inner life. She wants to say that in between public act-and-choice\nsituations we are continually active mentally in our attempt attention\nand our imagination.\n\nBut she also wants to say that the moral formation that\nproduces our fabric of being is going on all the time. This opens up\nthe larger issue of the range of factors that contribute to moral\nformation, beyond attempt attention. Murdoch may partly be blinded to\nthe passive forces in this category by a failure to keep clearly\ndistinct the claims that moral activity goes on continually and that\nmoral formation goes on continually. But her vital moral insight of\nthe \u201cfabric of being\u201d metaphor requires taking account of\nthe full range of contributions to that fabric of being, passive as well as active.\n",
