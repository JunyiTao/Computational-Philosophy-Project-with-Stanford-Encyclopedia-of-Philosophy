According to Michael Dummett\u2019s influential\ncharacterization of semantic realism, the realist is one who believes\nthat every declarative sentence of one\u2019s language is\ndeterminately true or false, independently of our means of coming to\nknow which. This is what is supposed to justify the realist\u2019s\nuse of strictly classical logical principles such as the Law of\nExcluded Middle. The anti-realist, by contrast, insists that all\ntruths are knowable; and is quick to point out that we do not\nhave any effective method for deciding the truth or falsity of\nstatements in mathematics. Anti-realists, accordingly, reject the Law\nof Excluded Middle (and all other strictly classical rules that are\nintuitionistically equivalent to it), and advocate the use of\nintuitionistic or constructive logic, rather than classical logic.\n\nAn anti-realist concerned to demonstrate the analyticity of the basic\nlaws of arithmetic would inquire whether one can eschew strictly\nclassical passages of inference when deriving the Peano postulates.\nFor, if those postulates are analytically true, then the anti-realist\nwould expect to attain them by means of rules justifiable by appeal\nonly to the constructive contents involved (see Rumfitt 1999). And\nindeed the anti-realist can. She can avoid recourse to the full power\nof Hume\u2019s Principle. The innocuous ingredients of the conceptual\ncontent of Hume\u2019s Principle, insofar as finite numbers are\nconcerned, will find expression in the inferential rules that the\nanti-realist lays down for zero, #, and successor. Heyting arithmetic,\nafter all, has exactly the same axioms as Peano arithmetic, and is the\nlogical closure of those axioms under intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. The two systems PA and HA differ only in respect of\nthe logic used for closure. It would be rather odd if the intuitionist\nwere debarred from being a logicist in the sense at issue here.\n\nThe pursuit of analyticity in the foundations of arithmetic is one\nthat could be very well served by the proof-theoretic methods favored\nby the Dummettian anti-realist\u2019s theory of meaning. Central to\nsuch a proof-theoretic approach is the formulation of inferential\nrules governing all the expression-forming operators in\nquestion\u2014rules that come, preferably, in\nintroduction-elimination pairs. The rules are constitutive of the\nrespective operators\u2019 meanings; whence results proved solely by\nmeans of those rules qualify as analytic. A question that will be\nraised by any alert meaning-theorist, therefore, is the following:\nMight there not be some anti-realist (constructive, or intuitionistic)\nderivation, in Fregean spirit, of the basic laws of arithmetic by\nappeal to suitable meaning-constituting rules of inference that\nconform to the general requirements of an anti-realist theory of\nmeaning? Anti-realist doctrine invites such extension to the\nmathematical expressions in fundamental theories such as arithmetic.\nIt could give Fregean logicists what they are seeking: fundamental\nderivations of the Dedekind-Peano postulates from more basic logical\nprinciples, logical principles that are at least as secure,\nepistemically, as the mathematical postulates they are seeking to\nderive.\n",
