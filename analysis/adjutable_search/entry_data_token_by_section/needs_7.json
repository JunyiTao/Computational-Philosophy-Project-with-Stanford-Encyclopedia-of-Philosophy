One\nstrategy frequently used to address concerns related to a lack of\nobjectivity is to argue that what counts as a need, especially one\nthat is to have normative importance, can be decided in principled\nways (e.g. Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991, Wiggins 1987).\nVarious authors delineate the principles differently though there is\nalso important convergence and overlap, as we discuss in section 3\nbelow. A common theme is that the needs that are normatively salient,\nespecially in political distribution, are those that are necessary,\nindispensable, or inescapable, given the kinds of creatures that we\nare and the requirements for functioning in social settings.\n\n\nAll authors grapple somewhat with the level at which we should specify\nwhat it is people need. While reflection on our common humanity might\nwell be an important source of understanding about what humans need,\nto articulate that more precisely we need to engage with particular\nsocial contexts to flesh out any lists that will apply within\nparticular societies and have purchase in policy matters.  One common\ndistinction in the literature is to differentiate between needs and\ntheir satisfiers. The idea is that we can give a fairly high-level\nstatement of our human needs, but for particular societies we will\noften require a more specific account of what forms the satisfiers could\ntake in those societal contexts. So to illustrate, we might say that\nall people need sufficient health and sufficient protection from\nenvironmental hazards. To specify what that amounts to for members of\nparticular societies, we need to examine threats to health\nin particular environments (along with whatever general ones\nalso apply to all human beings). Consider how prudent precautions for\nInuit will differ from those that are recommended in societies where\nmosquito-borne illnesses are rampant (even if it is also true that a\nnumber of similar precautions apply to both). And this will be the\ncase for all our human needs. Even when we make claims about our human\nneeds, the forms that satisfying those needs may take in particular\nsocieties can admit of huge variation.\n\n\nSo, differentiating between needs and their satisfiers plays an\nimportant role in explaining some of the diversity we see reflected\naround the world, along with some of the diversity we see within\nsocieties. Consider an intra-societal example. While we all might have\na need for appropriate recreation, the form this takes may well\nvary. For some, recreational needs are satisfied by listening to\nmusic, while for others nothing short of mountain walking will do. So\nwhile some people claim that they couldn\u2019t possibly live without\nmusic, and other say the same about walking in the mountains, what\nthey are disagreeing about is satisfiers rather than basic human\nneeds. They can agree that there is a need for recreation even if they\ndisagree about the form satisfaction of the need should take for\nthem.\n\n\nAnother distinction that can often account for other examples of\napparent diversity is also worth mentioning. As David Braybrooke\nsuggests, there is a difference between \u2018adventitious\nneeds\u2019 and \u2018course-of-life\u2019 needs (Braybrooke 1987,\n29). Adventitious needs are those that become important given a\ncertain project, practice, or activity. But within one society not all\ncitizens may wish to undertake those activities. The needs may not be\nshared by all, even if it is true that the item claimed to be needed\nis indeed essential to undertake that activity. By contrast, a\ncourse-of-life need is one that is widely shared and is not dependent\non particular projects; during the course of human lives lived in that\nsociety, one typically needs items on the list.\n\n\nIn response to the concerns that distribution according to need is\nundesirable because it lends itself to paternalism, authoritarianism,\nundesirable conceptions of agency, or overwhelming demands, a common\napproach is to point out that each of the objections makes dispensable\nassumptions. For instance, why assume that the individuals whose needs\nare a target of policy will not play a role in the relevant\ndeterminations of what they need, how these might best be satisfied,\nor other important features of needs policy? In fact, on several\nimportant accounts, the decision procedures concerning how to settle\nquestions of need should include a range of individuals, including\nthose in need (Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991). So distribution\naccording to need is not automatically vulnerable to charges of\npaternalism, and the like. Particular decision-making procedures for\narriving at policies about needs may well be characterized in these\nterms, but this is not an inevitable feature of all such policies.\n\n\nThe concern about being overwhelmed by a bottomless pit of\nneeds-related responsibilities can be deflated similarly using various\nstrategies. One is to point out that claims of need might have\nvariable importance depending on key features such as the\nrelationships among relevant parties, resources available, and the\nburdens that meeting them would place on others (e.g. Copp 1998, Brock\n2009). And, of course, the issue of responsibilities that needs\ngenerate and how to distribute responsibilities for meeting needs is\nan enormous topic (e.g., Braybrooke 1987, Miller 1999, Miller 2007),\none that will be discussed below (for instance, in sections 4 and 5).\nFor now, it is worth pointing out that we need not assume what this\nobjection does, namely that meeting needs is an all or nothing affair,\nso that either needs have normative force (in which case they have too\nmuch) or else they can have none at all.\n",
