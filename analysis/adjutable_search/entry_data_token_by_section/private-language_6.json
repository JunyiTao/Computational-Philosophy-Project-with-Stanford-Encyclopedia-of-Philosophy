    "main_text": "The Private Language Argument Expounded || Interlude: the Rejection of Orthodoxy\n3.3 Interlude: the Rejection of Orthodoxy\n\nAt this point we should suspend our exposition of the argument, in\norder to examine closely the remark \u2018this process brings it\nabout that I remember the connection correctly in the\nfuture\u2019.\n\nThis remark has usually been interpreted as a demand that, for the\nsign \u2018S\u2019 to have been given a meaning, it must\nalways figure thereafter (if used affirmatively and sincerely) as a\ntrue statement: that is, I must use the sign \u2018S\u2019\naffirmatively only when I really do have the sensation S. And\nit has usually been thought that the subsequent argument concerns the\nadequacy of memory to ensure that I do not later misidentify my\nsensations and call a different kind of sensation\n\u2018S\u2019 in the future. This account of the argument\nand its history is summed up by Anthony Kenny as follows:\n\n\nMany philosophers have taken \u2018I remember the connection\nright\u2019 to mean \u2018I use \u201cS\u201d when and\nonly when I really have S\u2019. They then take\nWittgenstein\u2019s argument to be based on scepticism about memory: how\ncan you be sure that you have remembered aright when next you call a\nsensation \u2018S\u2019? \u2026\n\nCritics of Wittgenstein have found the argument, so interpreted, quite\nunconvincing. Surely, they say, the untrustworthiness of memory\npresents no more and no less a problem for the user of a private\nlanguage than for the user of a public one. No, Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndefenders have said, for memory-mistakes about public objects may be\ncorrected, memory-mistakes about private sensations cannot; and where\ncorrection is impossible, talk of correctness is out of place. At this\npoint critics of Wittgenstein have either denied that truth demands\ncorrigibility, or have sought to show that checking is possible in the\nprivate case too. (Kenny[ 1973] pp. 191\u20132)\n\n\nThis interplay of criticism and defence characterizes the Orthodox\ninterpretation of the argument. (See Fogelin [1976], pp. 162\u20134,\nfor a good example.) There seem to be at least two reasons why this\ninterpretation should have become established. First, philosophers\ncommitted to the idea of a private language are often looking for an\narrangement in which mistakes of fact are impossible; that is, they\nare trying to overcome scepticism by finding absolute certainty.\n(Descartes is the example usually cited.) And this would make\nsceptical arguments appear to be natural weapons to use in reply to\nthem. (See, e.g., Fogelin [1976] p. 153.) Secondly, it is\nplausible\u2014which is not the same as correct\u2014to suppose that\none cannot be mistaken concerning the natures of one\u2019s present\nsensations, and a supposed proof that the idea of a private language\nentails that one is just as fallible on this subject as on any other\ncould thus seem crippling to that idea.\n\nBut, as Kenny first showed, the question of factual infallibility in\nfuture uses of the sign \u2018S\u2019 is not the issue. If\nwe look closely at \u00a7258, we see that \u2018I remember the\nconnection correctly\u2019 refers to remembering a\nmeaning, namely, the meaning of the sign\n\u2018S\u2019, not to making sure that I infallibly apply\n\u2018S\u2019 only to S\u2019s in the future. (Nor does\nthe private language argument depend on taking the latter to be an\neffect of the former.)\n",
