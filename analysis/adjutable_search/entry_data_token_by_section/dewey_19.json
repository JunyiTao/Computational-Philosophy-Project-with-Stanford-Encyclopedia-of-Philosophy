    "main_text": "Inquiry and Knowledge || Inquiry, Knowledge, and Truth\n4.3 Inquiry, Knowledge, and Truth\n\nIn the context of instrumentalism, what do \u201clogic\u201d and\n\u201cepistemology\u201d amount to? Dewey remains focused on these\nsubject matters but insisted on a more empirical approach. How, he\nasked, does reasoning and learning actually\n happen?[27]\n Dewey addresses the nature of logic in his major 1938 study,\nLogic: The Theory of Inquiry (LTI, LW12); his term\nfor logic is the \u201cinquiry into inquiry\u201d. LTI\nundertakes the systematic process of collecting, organizing, and\nexplicating the actual conditions of different kinds of inquiry; the\naim of this reconstructed logic, as outlined in the 1917 \u201cThe Need for a Recovery of Philosophy\u201d, is pragmatic and ameliorative: to provide an\n\u201cimportant aid in proper guidance of further attempts at\nknowing\u201d (MW10: 23).\n\nThroughout his career, Dewey described processes and patterns evident\nin active problem solving. Here, we consider three: inquiry,\nknowledge, and truth. There is, Dewey argued, a \u201cpattern of\ninquiry\u201d which prevails in problem solving. In \u201cAnalysis\nof Reflective Thinking\u201d (1933, LW8) and LTI (LW12) it\nhas five phases. Explicitly disavowing categorical divisions between\nemotion and reason, the initial phase of inquiry begins (1) with a\nfeeling of something amiss, a unique and particular\ndoubtfulness; this feeling endures as a pervasive quality imbued in\ninquiry and serves as a kind of \u201cguide\u201d to subsequent\nphases. Next, because what is initially present is indeterminate, (2)\na problem must be specifically formulated; problems do not\npreexist inquiry, as typically\n assumed.[28]\n Next, (3) a hypothesis is constructed, one which\nimaginatively utilizes both theoretical ideas and perceptual facts to\nforecast the possible consequences of various operations. Next, in\nphase (4), one reasons through the meanings involved in the\nhypothesis, sizing up the implications or possible contradictions\ninvolved; frequently, what is discovered here requires a return to an\nearlier phase (to reformulate the hypothesis or even the\n problem).[29]\n Finally, inquiry comes to a close with phase (5), acting to evaluate\nand test the hypothesis; here, it is revealed whether a proposed\nsolution solves the problem, or to put it LTI\u2019s\nterminology, whether inquiry has converted an \u201cindeterminate\nsituation\u201d into a \u201cdeterminate one\u201d.\n\nThe inquiry pattern Dewey sketched is schematic; he noted that actual\ncases of reasoning often do not show such discreteness or linearity.\nThus, the pattern is not a summary of how people always think\nbut rather how exemplary cases of inquirential thinking unfold (e.g.,\nin the empirical sciences).\n\nKnowledge, as viewed by Dewey\u2019s transactional model of inquiry,\ndeparts from tradition; in effect, it is brought to earth.\n\u201cKnowledge, as an abstract term\u201d, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nis a name for the product of competent inquiries. Apart from this\nrelation, its meaning is so empty that any content or filling may be\narbitrarily poured in. (LTI, LW12: 16) \n\n\nTo understand a product, one must understand the process; this is what\nDewey does. Denying the importance of knowledge, qua isolable\nproduct, is effectively denying a metaphysical account of reality that\nmakes mind-the-substance separate from everything else. It does\nnot depreciate knowing as an activity, and Dewey strongly\nmaintained that \u201cintelligence\u201d is a crucial mediator of\nindividual and societal\n conflict.[30]\n\nTruth, too, is radically reevaluated. For too long, truth connoted an\nideal\u2014an epistemic fixity (a correspondence, a coherence) which\ncould terminate all further inquiry. As this is not the actual\nsituation human beings (or philosophy) inhabits, the ideal should be\nset aside. Still, Dewey was ever the (re)constructivist; in\n\u201cExperience, Knowledge, and Value\u201d (1939c) he provided an\naccount of truth; it no longer pointed toward some transcendental\nthing, but toward the process of inquiry (\u201cExperience,\nKnowledge, and Value\u201d, LW14: 56\u201357). To label a\nproposition \u201ctrue\u201d is to say it offers some reliability as\na resource in further inquiry: \n\n\nIn scientific inquiry, the criterion of what is taken to be settled,\nor to be knowledge, is being so settled that it is available as a\nresource in further inquiry; not being settled in such a way as not to\nbe subject to revision in further inquiry. (LTI, LW12: 16)\n\n\n\nTruth does not stand outside of experience, but is an experienced\nrelation, particularly one which is socially shared. In How We\nThink, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nTruth, in final analysis, is the statement of things \u201cas they\nare,\u201d not as they are in the inane and desolate void of\nisolation from human concern, but as they are in a shared and\nprogressive experience\u2026.Truth, truthfulness, transparent and\nbrave publicity of intercourse, are the source and the reward of\nfriendship. Truth is having things in common. (HWT, MW6: 67;\nsee also \u201cThe Experimental Theory of Knowledge\u201d, 1910b,\nMW3: 118)\n\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s instrumentalism, then, knowledge and truth are\nadjectival not nominative, they describe a process which, as Peirce\ntells us, can go on as long as we do. \u201cThere is no belief so\nsettled as not to be exposed to further inquiry\u201d (LTI, LW12:\n16). To understand why words like \u201cknowledge\u201d and\n\u201ctruth\u201d deserve to be honorifics, one must understand\ntheir historic value as tools that have aided past inquiries and\nhelped secure experiences of value.\n",
