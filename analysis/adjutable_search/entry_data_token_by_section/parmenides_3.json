    "main_text": "Overview of Parmenides\u2019 Poem || The Way of Conviction\n2.3 The Way of Conviction\n\nThe goddess begins her account of \u201ctrue reality,\u201d or what\nis to be discovered along this first path, as follows: \u201cAs yet a\nsingle tale of a way/ remains, that it is; and along this path markers\nare there/ very many, that What Is is ungenerated and deathless,/\nwhole and uniform, and still and perfect\u201d (fr. 8.1\u20134).\nWhat Is (to eon) has by this point become a name for what\nParmenides will form a fuller conception of by following the\ngoddess\u2019 directions. These now include the programmatic\ndescription here in fr. 8.3\u20134 of the attributes What Is will be\nshown to have in the ensuing arguments. Thanks primarily to\nSimplicius\u2019 transcription, we still possess in its entirety the\nportion of Parmenides\u2019 poem comprising the goddess\u2019s\nrevelation of the nature of \u201ctrue reality.\u201d This account\nconstitutes one of the philosophical tradition\u2019s earliest, most\nextensive, and most important stretches of metaphysical reasoning.\n\nThe arguments here proceed methodically in accordance with the program\nannounced at fr. 8.3\u20134. The goddess begins by arguing, in fr.\n8.5\u201321, that What Is must be \u201cungenerated and\ndeathless\u201d:\n\nbut not ever was it, nor yet will it be, since it is now together\nentire,/ single, continuous; for what birth will you seek of it?/ How,\nwhence increased? From not being I shall not allow/ you to say or to\nthink: for not to be said and not to be thought/ is it that it is not.\nAnd indeed what need could have aroused it/ later rather than before,\nbeginning from nothing, to grow?/ Thus it must either be altogether or\nnot at all./ Nor ever from not being will the force of conviction\nallow/ something to come to be beyond it: on account of this neither\nto be born/ nor to die has Justice allowed it, having loosed its\nbonds,/ but she holds it fast. And the decision about these matter\nlies in this:/ it is or it is not; but it has in fact been decided,\njust as is necessary,/ to leave the one unthought and nameless (for no\ntrue/ way is it), and <it has been decided> that the one that it\nis indeed is genuine./ And how could What Is be hereafter? And how\nmight it have been?/ For if it was, it is not, nor if ever it is going\nto be:/ thus generation is extinguished and destruction unheard of.\n\n\nFr. 8.5\u20136a, at the outset here, have often been taken as a\ndeclaration that What Is has some type of timeless existence. Given,\nhowever, that this verse and a half opens a chain of continuous\nargumentation, claiming that What Is does not come to be or pass away,\nthese words are probably better understood as a declaration of What\nIs\u2019s uninterrupted existence.\n\nContinuing on, in fr. 8.22\u20135 the goddess presents a much briefer\nargument for What Is\u2019s being \u201cwhole and\nuniform\u201d:\n\nNor is it divided, since it is all alike;/ and it is not any more\nthere, which would keep it from holding together,/ nor any worse, but\nit is all replete with What Is./ Therefore it is all continuous: for\nWhat Is draws to What Is.\u201d\n\n\nThen, at fr. 8.26\u201333, she argues that it is \u201cstill\u201d\nor motionless:\n\nAnd unmoved within the limits of great bonds/ it is unbeginning\nunending, since generation and destruction/ have wandered quite far\naway, and genuine conviction has expelled them./ And remaining the\nsame, in the same place, and on its own it rests,/ and thus steadfast\nright there it remains; for powerful Necessity/ holds it in the bonds\nof a limit, which encloses it all around,/ wherefore it is right that\nWhat Is be not unfulfilled; for it is not lacking: if it were, it\nwould lack everything.\n\n\nFinally, at fr. 8.42\u20139 (which Ebert 1989 has shown originally\nfollowed immediately after fr. 8.33, verses 34\u201341 having\nsuffered transposition from their original position following verse\n52), the goddess concludes by arguing that What Is must be\n\u201cperfect,\u201d before transitioning to the second phase of her\nrevelation:\n\nBut since there is a furthest limit, it is perfected/ from every side,\nlike the bulk of a well-rounded globe,/ from the middle equal every\nway: for that it be neither any greater/ nor any smaller in this place\nor in that is necessary;/ for neither is there non-being, which would\nstop it reaching/ to its like, nor is What Is such that it might be\nmore than What Is/ here and less there. Since it is all inviolate,/\nfor it is equal to itself from every side, it extends uniformly in\nlimits.\n\n",
