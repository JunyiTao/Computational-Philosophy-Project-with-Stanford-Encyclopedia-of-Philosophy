    "main_text": "Equality of Opportunity\n2. Equality of Opportunity\n\n\nIn a hierarchical caste society, positions of advantage are assigned\nto people on a basis of birth lineage. If one is a legitimate offspring\nof parents who are aristocrats, one will also enjoy the privileges of\naristocratic rank. A historically important form of equality associated\nwith the rise of competitive market economies is the ideal of equality\nof opportunity. This ideal is also known as formal equality of\nopportunity or careers open to talents.\n\n\nEquality of opportunity requires that jobs in economic firms and\noptions to borrow money for investment purposes such as starting a\nbusiness should be open to all applicants, that applications be\nassessed by relevant criteria of merit, and that the top-ranked\napplicant should be offered the job or option to borrow. The relevant\ncriteria of merit are to be set so that those who score highest are\nthose whose selection would best further the morally innocent purposes\nof the enterprise. In competitive market settings, the presumption\ntypically is that the criteria should be related to profitability. The\nbest applicant for a job or a loan would then be the individual to whom\noffering the good in question produces the greatest increase in the\nfirm's expected profit. (If the firm's owners are risk averse or risk\nseeking, the pertinent criterion would be expected profit weighted by\ntheir risk preferences.) A further aspect of the ideal of equality of\nopportunity requires that economic firms offering goods and services\nfor sale should sell to all willing customers, treating all potential\ncustomers evenhandedly as potential sources of profit. Finally,\nequality of opportunity requires that purchasers of goods and services\nshould be responsive only to the price and quality of the goods offered\nto them for purchase (and not, for example, to the ethnicity or sex or\nsexual orientation of the maker or seller of the good). This\nlast-mentioned requirement of equality of opportunity might not be\nincluded within formulations of the norm that are intended to be\nenacted as law and enforced by criminal or civil law procedures. But to\nimplement equality of opportunity, an orientation of the hearts and\nminds of members of society is needed, not merely legal enactments.\nEquality of opportunity would be subverted if the laws effectively\nprohibited economic firms from basing decision making on factors other\nthan expected profitability but consumers would not purchase products\nthat embodied the skilled labor of women and blacks, so that their\nmarket opportunities are stunted. Moreover, the law might indeed\nrequire firms to hire the best qualified applicant, meaning the one\nbest able to perform the role being filled, even if hiring the best\nqualified in this sense would not be profit-maximizing, due to\nrecalcitrant consumer prejudice.\n\n\nTwo natural extensions of the equality of opportunity ideal deserve\nmention. One is the requirement that student slots in colleges and\nuniversities and competitive private schools should be open to all\napplicants with applicants ranked by their ability to learn and other\nacademic virtues and selected on these academic grounds (provided they\ncan pay the tuition and fees). A second extension requires that public\nsector jobs\u2014other than those reserved for elected officials along\nwith their staffs\u2014should be open to all applicants with selection\nof applicants being made on the basis of the merits of the\napplications.\n\n\nThe general idea of equality of opportunity is that the political\neconomy of a society distributes positions that confer special\nadvantages and these should be open to all applicants with applicants\nselected by merit. The merits of the applications for a position should\ntrack the degree to which the applicant's hiring or selection for\ninteraction would boost the fulfillment of the morally innocent\npurposes of the association as weighted by the association's bosses.\nThe more general formulation of the notion of merit allows that an\neconomic firm might legitimately base its decisions on nonmarket values\nwithout engaging in wrongful discrimination that violates equality of\nopportunity rightly construed. For example, a maker of fancy surfboards\nmight sell them by preference to more skilled surfers, and a\nmountaineering guide might select clients partly on the basis of their\nphysical fitness and their perceived enthusiasm for wilderness\nadventure. Also, members of the learned professions such as medicine\nand law might be bound by legal and cultural norms that require them to\ntailor their services to the aims of the profession rather than just to\nprofitability (e.g., norms that require a medical doctor to refuse to\nprovide a medical treatment to a potential client who is willing and\nable to pay but would not benefit from the treatment).\n\n\nThe ideal of equality of opportunity is the ideal of a political\neconomy in which each person's prospects as producer depend only on his\ninitial stock of resources plus his ability and willingness to provide\ngoods and services that others value plus luck as market fluctuations\nare encountered. Moreover, in the role of consumer, each individual\n(modulo his location) faces the same array of goods and services on\nsale to anyone who can pay the purchase price (and can satisfy the\nrelevant nonmarket conditions of the seller or maker). Such\ncharacteristics of persons as their supposed race, skin color,\nethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and religion play no role in\ndetermining one's life prospects in this public sphere except insofar\nas these traits might happen to affect one's abilities and willingness\nto offer what others are willing to exchange for money.\n\n\nIn theory, equality of opportunity could be fully satisfied in a\nsociety in which wealth passed along by inheritance from generation to\ngeneration fundamentally determines everyone's competitive prospects.\nIn this society jobs and positions and so on would be open to all\napplicants, but the only applicants who have the skills that qualify\nthem for desirable posts are the children of the wealthy. They alone\nhave access to the training and acculturation that confer skills.\n\n\nA society that establishes and maintains a state educational system\nsustained by public funds already goes some way beyond equality of\nopportunity and toward provision to all of its members of some\nopportunity to develop skills that will enable them to succeed in\ncompetitions for desirable positions regulated by equality of\nopportunity. The same can be said of a society that enforces minimal\nstandards of child rearing to which parents must conform. One can\nimagine a society doing more in this same spirit.\n\n\nA society might institute policies that secure at least a minimally\nacceptable threshold of schooling and skill formation for all its\nmembers. An alternative aim is to eliminate entirely the advantages\nthat family wealth and social status confer on individuals in\ncompetitions regulated by formal equality of opportunity. The\nachievement of this aim would render a society classless, in a certain\nsense. John Rawls (1999, 63; 2001) has formulated this ideal as a\nprinciple of fair equality of opportunity (FEO). This principle holds\nthat any individuals in society with the same native talent and\nambition should have the same prospects of success in competition for\npositions that confer special benefits and advantages. FEO goes beyond\nequality of opportunity by requiring that all efforts by parents to\ngive their children a comparative advantage in competitions for\ndesirable positions and posts are somehow entirely offset. In a society\nregulated by FEO, socialization is adjusted so that among people\nequally willing to work to become qualified for a particular career and\nequally endowed by genetic inheritance with latent ability needed for\nthat career, all have the same chances of success in that career.\n\n\nFEO also opposes racial and sexual and similar prejudices that work\nto deprive disfavored individuals from enjoying opportunities to become\nqualified so that they would benefit from formal equality of\nopportunity. In some settings, affirmative action policies that aim to\nhelp members of historically disadvantaged groups such as\nAfrican-Americans in the U.S. gain desirable employment opportunities\nin proportion to their numbers in the population can be regarded as\npolicies intended to move society in the direction of satisfying\nFEO.\n\n\nFormal equality of opportunity, in so far as it imposes requirements\non firms, universities and colleges, and government as employer, is the\nlaw of the land in many modern democracies, and also entrenched in the\ncommon-sense morality most people embrace. By contrast, fair equality\nof opportunity is a controversial principle, which no existing nation\nseriously strives to achieve or comes close to achieving.\n\n\nFEO could not be fully achieved without conflict with other values.\nConsider that parents naturally want to help their children develop the\ntalents needed for competitive success. Some parents control a lot of\nresources useful for this purpose; some parents have few such\nresources. The ordinary interaction of parents with their children is\nthen an obstacle to the achievement of fair equality of opportunity. If\nsociety were fully to achieve FEO, then either parental freedom to help\ntheir children in ways that give them a competitive edge would have to\nbe curtailed or such help would have to be exactly offset by\ncompensating infusion of social resources toward the education and\nsocialization of children whose parents are less effective.
