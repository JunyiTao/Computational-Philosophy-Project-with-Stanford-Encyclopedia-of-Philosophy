    "main_text": "Major Works\n3. Major Works\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s two major works are Sefer ha-Qabbalah (The\nBook of Tradition) and Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah. Both books were\nwritten around the same time (c. 1160). They are closely related in\nthe sense that they endeavor to defend rabbinic Judaism; the former\nwith the help of history and the latter with the help of\nphilosophy.  The purpose of Sefer ha-Emunah ha-Ramah was to prove\nthe truth of the words of the prophets by philosophical means, while\nSefer ha-Qabbalah and related historical works were intended to\nconfirm the validity of the prophecies by demonstrating the\nreliability of their transmission from one generation to the next\n\n\n\nIn Sefer ha-Qabbalah, which has become a classic in Hebrew\nliterature, Abraham ibn Daud provides a survey of Jewish and general\nhistory and attempts to demonstrate the continuity of rabbinic\nJudaism.  According to G.D.Cohen this work also conveys an esoteric\nmessage of messianic redemption in the near future, a thesis that was\nchallenged by E. Krakowski (2007) as well as by K. Vehlow, who\nrecently edited the two chronicles appended to Sefer\nha-Qabbalah: one on the history of the kings of Israel during the\nSecond Temple period, and the other on the history of Rome, which are\nsimilarly polemical in nature (2013). The chronicles had a wide impact\non Protestant authors from the 16th century onwards.\n\n\nHis philosophical book was written in Arabic and entitled\nal-\u2018Aq\u00eedah al-raf\u00ee\u2018ah (The Exalted\nFaith). The Arabic original is no longer extant. Towards the end of\nthe fourteenth century, the work was translated into Hebrew twice: the\nfirst time under the title Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah by Solomon ben\nLavi (c. 1370?), possibly at the instigation of the philosopher Hasdai\nCrescas, and a second time under the title Ha-Emunah\nNissa\u2019ah by Samuel ibn Motot. This second translation is\nbased on the first, but is less accurate (Eran 1996). Of this version\nonly one copy is extant, whereas of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah 16\nmanuscripts are known (some of them are not complete). \n\n\nIbn Daud is also reported to have written a book on astronomy, the\ncontents of which are unknown. The same applies to an anti-Karaite\npolemical work, which he mentions himself. Moreover, K. Szil\u00e1gyi has\ndiscovered a fragment of an otherwise unknown work by Ibn Daud on\nPhysics in Arabic. \n\n\nIn the introduction to ER, Ibn Daud mentions two earlier\nJewish philosophers: Saadya (often described as the first Jewish\nphilosopher, first half of the 10th century, Baghdad) and\nthe philosopher-poet Solomon ibn Gabirol (11th century,\nSpain). However, he dismisses their writings claiming that they are\ninadequate with respect to his goal, namely the study of philosophy in\norder to examine the principles of religion. This statement reflects\nIbn Daud\u2019s awareness of introducing a new trend to Jewish\nphilosophy. Saadya\u2019s Sefer ha-Emunot we-ha-De\u2018ot (Book\nof Opinions and Beliefs) provides a rationalistic interpretation of\nJudaism, but is influenced by the thought of the Muslim\nkal\u00e2m-theologians, which was considered outdated in Ibn Daud\u2019s\nday, whereas Ibn Gabirol\u2019s Meqor Hayyim (known in Latin as\nFons Vitae) is a neo-Platonist work, which makes no\nreference at all to Jewish sources.  Indeed, Ibn Daud\u2019s book\nconstitutes a novelty in that it is the first attempt to\nsystematically introduce the Aristotelianism of the Muslim\nphilosophers Alfarabi (870\u2013950) and Ibn Sina (980\u20131037) into Jewish\nphilosophy. His philosophical terminology and syllogistic reasoning\nare derived from the works of these authors. His\n\u201ctechnical\u201d approach has led Husik to observe that\n\u201cIbn Daud leaves upon us the impression of a precise thinker,\ncold and analytical. He exhibits no grace of style, eloquence of\ndiction or depths of enthusiasm and emotion\u201d (Husik 2002:\n198). This judgment of his style may be too harsh.  Undoubtedly his\nbook must have made some demands on it readers, but it is only fair to\nnote that Ibn Daud attempts to liven up the monotony of his logical\narguments at regular intervals by using analogies and quotes from\npoems.\n",
