    "main_text": "Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview || Counting infinite collections\n2.4 Counting infinite collections\n\nThere is one final aspect of 17th century discussions of infinity that\nis relevant for later considerations: the problem of extending the\nconcept of counting from the finite to the infinite. This problem is\nrelated to the issue of whether there is only one infinity or whether\nthere might be different sizes of infinity. As we have mentioned,\nPhiloponus argued that the eternity of the world led to a\ncontradiction. In particular, he claimed, if the world has no\nbeginning in the past, then the number of individuals up to Socrates\nwould be infinite; but then by adding the number of individuals from\nSocrates to now, one would obtain an infinity larger than the previous\none, and this, he concluded, is \u201cone of the most impossible\nthings\u201d (see Sorabji 1983). It was typical of Greek thought to\nreject the idea that there can be different sizes of infinity.\n\nThe Islamic mathematician Ibn Qurrah (9th century CE) took a decidedly\ninfinitistic attitude and argued, against the Aristotelian\ncommentators, that there can be different sizes of infinity (see\nRashed 2009). He claimed, for instance, that the odd and the even\nnumbers have the same size, but that the multiples of three are 1/3 of\nthe total number of natural numbers. Contrary to what has been claimed\nin the literature, his intuition was not that the even numbers and the\nodd numbers have the same size because there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between them. Rather we have a\n\u201cfrequentist\u201d intuition: every even number is followed by\nan odd number; multiples of three appear every three numbers, etc. We\nfind a similar position in Grosseteste\u2019s treatise De\nLuce (see Mancosu 2009, 2016 for an overview of the historical\ndevelopments and further references).\n\nGalileo Galilei epitomized the paradoxical situation we run into when\ntrying to generalize counting from the finite to the infinite. In\nTwo New Sciences (1638; Galilei 1974), he presented a paradox\nof infinity. On the one hand, there is an intuition that there are\nfewer square numbers than natural numbers, since the first\ncollection is properly contained in the second (the former has some\nbut not all of the latter\u2019s members). On the other hand, there\nis an intuition that there are the same number of squares and\nnatural numbers, since there is a one-to-one correspondence\u2014a\nbijection\u2014between the natural numbers and their\nsquares. Galileo\u2019s own conclusion, following Oresme and Albert\nof Saxony who had discussed similar issues in the 14th century, was to\nclaim that one cannot apply the relations of equality,\ngreater than, and smaller than to infinite\ncollections. Much subsequent theorizing about infinity can be regarded\nas respecting one intuition at the expense of the other.\n\nThe intuition that if one set is a proper subset of another, the\nformer is smaller than the latter, traces back to Euclid\u2014call\nthis the part-whole intuition. Bolzano (1851) was sympathetic\nto it, and he tried to develop a theory of infinite sets that\npreserved it. He was not successful, but he warned his readers not to\nconflate one property of an infinite set\u2014that it can be put in\none-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself\u2014with a\ncriterion of \u2018size\u2019 (what he called the\n\u201cmultiplicity\u201d of a collection). Cantor (see Hallett\n1986), by contrast, later used one-to-one correspondence as the\ndefining characteristic of cardinal numbers: the numbers that\nanswer \u2018how many?\u2019 questions, and that generalize counting\nfrom the finite to the infinite in his set theory. He thus sided with\nthe intuition that if there is a bijection between two sets, they have\nthe same size\u2014call this the bijection intuition. The\nintuition is clearly correct for finite sets. For example, the set of\nfingers on a normal human hand can be paired up with the set of toes\non a normal human foot, and vice versa: there is a bijection between\nthese two sets. And of course, the two sets have the same size (five).\nA central question is whether the intuition is correct also for\ninfinite sets. We will discuss Cantor\u2019s theory and, by contrast,\nsome recent implementations of counting, known as theories of\nnumerosities, that preserve the part-whole intuition also for\ninfinite sets\u2014see the\n\nSupplement on Theories of Numerosities.\n\nIn conclusion, the \u201cinfinitistic revolution\u201d in the 17th\nand the early 18th century left an important legacy for philosophy and\nmathematics. The theory of indivisibles introduced new magnitudes\ncharacterized infinitarily (the collection of all the indivisibles of\na figure), and new infinitary geometrical objects extended the\nclassical geometrical universe. Moreover, the debates on the calculus\nwere focused on the nature of the infinitely small and the infinitely\nlarge. Finally, the issues emerging from Galileo\u2019s paradox were\na prelude to the problem of extending counting from finite to infinite\ncollections.\n\nThese problems were gradually addressed in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, and out of these discussions there emerged different\nmathematical notions of infinity. We will work our way in stages to\nthese conceptions, via a discussion of some landmarks in the\ncontemporary mathematics of infinity.\n\nAmong the numerous general treatments of the use of infinity in\nmathematics we recommend L\u00e9vy (1987), Zellini (2005), Moore\n(1990/2019), Vilenkin (1995), Barrow (2006). For more detailed\naccounts of the history of the calculus, see Kline (1990), Boyer\n(1959), Edwards (1979), and Grattan-Guinness (1980). The most recent\nscholarship on the theory of indivisibles is to be found in Jullien\n(2015). For recent collections on Leibnizian infinitesimals see\nGoldenbaum and Jesseph (2008) and Goethe, Beeley and Rabouin (2015).\nOn concepts of mathematical infinity in the 19th century see\nK\u00f6nig (1990).\n",
