    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy || Non-Ideal Theory: Outlaw States and Burdened Societies\n5.5 Non-Ideal Theory: Outlaw States and Burdened Societies\n\nThe principles selected in the international original position contain\nprovisions for non-ideal situations: situations in which nations are\nunwilling to comply with the ideal principles, or are unable to\ncooperate on their terms. These provisions are embedded in principles\n4 through 8 of the law of peoples.\n\nOutlaw states are non-compliant: they threaten the peace by\nattempting to expand their power and influence, or by violating the\nhuman rights of those within their territory. The principles of the\nlaw of peoples allow peoples to fight these outlaw states in\nself-defense, and to take coercive actions against them to stop their\nviolations of human rights. In any military confrontations with outlaw\nstates, peoples must obey the principles of the just prosecution of\nwar, such as avoiding direct attacks on enemy civilians in all but the\nmost desperate circumstances. The aim of war, Rawls says, must be to\nbring all societies to honor the law of peoples, and eventually to\nbecome fully participating members of international society.\n\nBurdened societies struggle with social and economic\nconditions that make it difficult for them to maintain either liberal\nor decent institutions. A burdened society may lack sufficient\nmaterial or social resources to support a scheme of social\ncooperation, perhaps because its population has grown beyond its\nterritory\u2019s means to support it. It is the basic structure and\npolitical culture of a society that are most crucial for its\nself-sufficiency; the international community must help a burdened\nsociety to rise above this threshold. The law of peoples (eighth\nprinciple) requires that burdened peoples be assisted until they can\nhandle their own affairs (i.e., become well-ordered).\n\nThis duty of assistance is Rawls\u2019s greatest divergence from the\nrules of today\u2019s international law. Accepting this duty would\nrequire significant changes in how nations respond to global poverty\nand failed states.\n",
