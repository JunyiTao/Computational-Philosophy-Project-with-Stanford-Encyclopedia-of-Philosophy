    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy || Kantian and Post-Kantian Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n1.3 Kantian and Post-Kantian Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n\nHume\u2019s denial that there is an inner perception of the self as\nthe owner of experience is one that is echoed in Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion in both the Transcendental Deduction and the Paralogisms,\nwhere he writes that there is no intuition of the self \u201cthrough\nwhich it is given as object\u201d (Kant 1781/1787: B408; Brook 1994;\nAmeriks 1982 [2000]). Kant\u2019s account of self-consciousness and\nits significance is complex, a central element of the Transcendental\nDeduction being the claim that a form of\nself-awareness\u2014transcendental apperception\u2014is required to\naccount for the unity of conscious experience over time. In\nKant\u2019s words, \u201cthe \u2018I think\u2019 must be able to\naccompany all my representations\u201d (Kant 1781/1787: B132; Keller\n1998; Kitcher 2011; see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s view of the mind and consciousness of self).\n Thus, while Kant denies that there is an inner awareness of the self\nas an object that owns its experiences, we must nevertheless be aware\nof those experiences as things that are, both individually and\ncollectively, our own. The representation of the self in this \u201cI\nthink\u201d is then, according to Kant, purely formal, exhausted by\nits function in unifying experience.\n\nThe Kantian account of self-awareness and its relation to the capacity\nfor objective thought set the agenda for a great deal of post-Kantian\nphilosophy. On the nature of self-awareness, for example, in an\nunpublished manuscript Schopenhauer concurs with Kant, asserting that,\n\u201cthat the subject should become an object for itself is the most\nmonstrous contradiction ever thought of\u201d (quoted in Janaway\n1989: 120). Further, a philosophical tradition stemming from\nKant\u2019s work has tried to identify the necessary conditions of\nthe possibility of self-consciousness, with P.F. Strawson (1959,\n1966), Evans (1980, 1982), and Cassam (1997), for example, exploring\nthe relation between the capacity for self-conscious thought and the\npossession of a conception of oneself as an embodied agent located\nwithin an objective world (see\n \u00a74.3).\n Another, related tradition has argued that an awareness of subjects\nother than oneself is a necessary condition of self-consciousness (see\n \u00a74.4).\n Historical variations on such a view can be found in Fichte\n(1794\u20131795; Wood 2006), Hegel (1807; Pippin 2010), and, from a\nsomewhat different perspective, Mead (1934; Aboulafia 1986).\n\nFichte offers the most influential account of self-consciousness in\nthe post-Kantian tradition. On the reading of the \u201cHeidelberg\nSchool\u201d, Fichte claims that previous accounts of\nself-consciousness given by Descartes, Locke, and even Kant are\n\u201creflective\u201d, regarding the self as taking itself not as\nsubject but as object (Henrich 1967; Tugendhat 1979: ch. 3; Frank\n2004; Zahavi 2007). But this reflective form of self-awareness, Fichte\nargues, presupposes a more primitive form since it is necessary for\nthe reflecting self to be aware that the reflected self is in fact\nitself. Consequently, according to Fichte, we must possess an\nimmediate acquaintance with ourselves, \u201cthe self exists and\nposits its own existence by virtue of merely existing\u201d (Fichte\n1794\u20131795: 97). Once more, this debate echoes ancient\ndiscussions concerning the nature and role of self-consciousness.\n",
