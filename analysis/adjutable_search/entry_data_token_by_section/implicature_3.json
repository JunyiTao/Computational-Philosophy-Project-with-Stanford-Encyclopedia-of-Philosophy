Common Forms of Conversational Implicature\n\nMany forms of conversational implicature occur frequently in everyday\nspeech and literature, with a wide variety of sentences and in all\nknown languages. They are common ways of both using and understanding\nlanguage. The forms are differentiated in part by the relationship\nbetween what is said and what is implicated. Knowledge of them is an\nimportant component of our linguistic competence, and is acquired at\nan early\n age.[24]\n\nThe most widely recognized forms of implicature are figures\nof speech (tropes). Irony, overstatement (hyperbole),\nunderstatement (meiosis and litotes), and metaphor have been known at\nleast since Aristotle. They are taught in school as elements of style.\nWhen Don said in\n (2)\nThe weather is lovely, he engaged in irony and\nimplicated that the weather is awful. Don did so in part to make light\nof the awful weather. Don could have implicated the same thing by\nsaying The weather is not good (litotes) or The weather\nis the worst in history (hyperbole).\n\nFigurative speech is non-literal: users generally do not mean\nwhat they say, and expect their audience to recognize that. (Litotes\nis an exception.) Don did not mean that the weather is lovely. \nThe obvious falsity of what is said is a typical clue that speech is\nfigurative. Some figures also tend to be marked intonationally,\nincluding irony and hyperbole. Others are not, including metaphor and\nunderstatement. They are all used to make speech lively, interesting,\nand stylish\n (\u00a710).\n\nMany forms of implicature are not figures of speech, and have become\nwidely recognized only since Grice (1975).\n (1)\n illustrates relevance implicature: the speaker implicates an\nanswer to an expressed or implied question by stating something\nrelated to it by implication or explanation.\n [5b]\n is a quantity (or scalar) implicature: the speaker\nimplicates the denial of a proposition stronger than the one said.\n (6)\n illustrates ignorance implicature: the speaker implicates\nthat something stronger than what was said is unknown.\n (7)\n illustrates metalinguistic implicature: the speaker\nimplicates that something has a certain name by using that name to\ndescribe it. These \u201cmodes of speech\u201d (non-figurative forms of\nimplicature) are not taught in school, and names for them are not in\ngeneral use. Nevertheless, they are as frequent and natural as\nfigurative speech, and are learned at the same time. Modes of speech\nare not marked intonationally, and the speech is literal. They are not\nused to make speech or writing lively. Speakers do not intend what\nthey say to be obviously false, and generally do mean what they\nsay.\n\nTwo modes of speech do have common names. One is damning with\nfaint praise. Grice\u2019s example has become classic:\n\n\nA is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a\nphilosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: \u201cDear Sir, Mr.\nX\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at\ntutorials has been regular. Yours, etc\u201d. (Grice 1975: 33)\n\n\nBy saying so little, A implicated that Mr. X is a poor candidate for\nthe job. The other named mode is loose use, or speaking\nloosely, illustrated by (8):\n\n (8) \nLinda: When will\ndinner be served?\n\nMike: At six o\u2019clock.\n\n\nIf Mike\u2019s response is typical, what he meant is only that dinner\nwill be served close enough to six o\u2019clock for current\npurposes. That would be typically be true if dinner will be\nserved at 6:01. What Mike said, though, is that dinner will be served\nat 6:00, which would be false if dinner is served at\n 6:01.[25]\n If Mike gave the same response to a question about when a swimmer\ntouched the wall in the final lap of an Olympic event, 6:01 may not be\nclose enough.\n\nThe figures and modes of speech are common, socially useful practices.\nThey perpetuate themselves through precedent following, social\nacceptance, individual habit and association, and traditional\ntransmission from one generation of speakers to another. Precedent\noperates when hearers call on their knowledge of the forms speakers\ncommonly use to either interpret speakers in new contexts, or to\npredict what hearers will understand. The forms are less arbitrary\nthan lexical or syntactic conventions, but no one has to implicate\nrather than say things, or use one form of implicature rather than\nothers.\n\nSince these conventions do not attach implicatures to particular\nsentence forms, they do not give rise to sentence implicatures.\n",
