    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues in Determinism || Laws of nature\n2.4 Laws of nature\n\nIn the loose statement of determinism we are working from, metaphors\nsuch as \u201cgovern\u201d and \u201cunder the sway of\u201d are\nused to indicate the strong force being attributed to the laws of\nnature. Part of understanding determinism\u2014and especially,\nwhether and why it is metaphysically important\u2014is getting clear\nabout the status of the presumed laws of nature.\n\nIn the physical sciences, the assumption that there are fundamental,\nexceptionless laws of nature, and that they have some strong sort of\nmodal force, usually goes unquestioned. Indeed, talk of laws\n\u201cgoverning\u201d and so on is so commonplace that it takes an\neffort of will to see it as metaphorical. We can characterize the\nusual assumptions about laws in this way: the laws of nature are\nassumed to be pushy explainers. They make things happen\nin certain ways and, by having this power, their existence lets\nus explain why things happen in certain ways. (For a defense\nof this perspective on laws, see Maudlin (2007)). Laws, we might say,\nare implicitly thought of as the cause of everything that\nhappens. If the laws governing our world are deterministic, then in\nprinciple everything that happens can be explained as following from\nstates of the world at earlier times. (Again, we note that even though\nthe entailment typically works in the future\u2192past direction also,\nwe have trouble thinking of this as a legitimate explanatory\nentailment. In this respect also, we see that laws of nature are being\nimplicitly treated as the causes of what happens: causation,\nintuitively, can only go past\u2192future.)\n\nInterestingly, philosophers tend to acknowledge the apparent threat\ndeterminism poses to free will, even when they explicitly reject the\nview that laws are pushy explainers. Earman (1986), for example,\nadvocates a theory of laws of nature that takes them to be simply the\nbest system of regularities that systematizes all the events in\nuniversal history. This is the Best Systems Analysis (BSA), with roots\nin the work of Hume, Mill and Ramsey, and most recently refined and\ndefended by David Lewis (1973, 1994) and by Earman (1984, 1986). (cf.\nentry on\n laws of nature).\n Yet he ends his comprehensive Primer on Determinism with a\ndiscussion of the free will problem, taking it as a still-important\nand unresolved issue. Prima facie this is quite puzzling, for\nthe BSA is founded on the idea that the laws of nature are\nontologically derivative, not primary; it is the events of universal\nhistory, as brute facts, that make the laws be what they are, and\nnot vice-versa. Taking this idea seriously, the actions of\nevery human agent in history are simply a part of the universe-wide\npattern of events that determines what the laws are for this world. It\nis then hard to see how the most elegant summary of this pattern, the\nBSA laws, can be thought of as determiners of human actions. The\ndetermination or constraint relations, it would seem, can go one way\nor the other, not both.\n\nOn second thought, however, it is not so surprising that broadly\nHumean philosophers such as Ayer, Earman, Lewis and others still see a\npotential problem for freedom posed by determinism. For even if human\nactions are part of what makes the laws be what they are, this does\nnot mean that we automatically have freedom of the kind we\nthink we have, particularly freedom to have done otherwise\ngiven certain past states of affairs. It is one thing to say that\neverything occurring in and around my body, and everything\neverywhere else, conforms to Maxwell\u2019s equations and thus the\nMaxwell equations are genuine exceptionless regularities, and that\nbecause they in addition are simple and strong, they turn out to be\nlaws. It is quite another thing to add: thus, I might have chosen to\ndo otherwise at certain points in my life, and if I had, then\nMaxwell\u2019s equations would not have been laws. One might try to\ndefend this claim\u2014unpalatable as it seems intuitively, and Lewis\n(1981) does this. But it does not follow directly from a Humean\napproach to laws of nature, and Loewer (2020, Other Internet\nResources) defends a different Humean compatibilism, to which we will\nreturn in section 6.\n\nA second important genre of theories of laws of nature holds that the\nlaws are in some sense necessary. For any such approach, laws\nare just the sort of pushy explainers that are assumed in the\ntraditional language of physical scientists and free will theorists.\nBut a third and growing class of philosophers holds that (universal,\nexceptionless, true) laws of nature simply do not exist.\nAmong those who hold this are influential philosophers such as Nancy\nCartwright, Bas van Fraassen, and John Dupr\u00e9. For these\nphilosophers, there is a simple consequence: determinism is a false\ndoctrine. As with the Humean view, this does not mean that concerns\nabout human free action are automatically resolved; instead, they must\nbe addressed afresh in the light of whatever account of physical\nnature without laws is put forward. See Dupr\u00e9 (2001) for one\nsuch discussion.\n",
