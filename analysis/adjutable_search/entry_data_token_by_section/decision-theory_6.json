In the book Savage\npresents a set of axioms constraining preferences over a set of\noptions that guarantee the existence of a pair of probability and\nutility functions relative to which the preferences can be represented\nas maximising expected utility. Nearly three decades prior to the\npublication of the book, Frank P. Ramsey (1926) had actually proposed\nthat a different set of axioms can generate more or less the same\nresult. Nevertheless, Savage\u2019s theory has been much more\ninfluential than Ramsey\u2019s, perhaps because Ramsey neither gave a\nfull proof of his result nor provided much detail of how it would go\n(Bradley 2004). Savage\u2019s result will not be described here in\nfull detail. However, the ingredients and structure of his theorem\nwill be laid out, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe options or prospects in Savage\u2019s theory are similar to\nlotteries, except that the possible outcomes do not come with\nprobabilities but rather depend on whether a particular state of the\nworld is actual. Indeed, the primitives in Savage\u2019s theory are\n outcomes[4]\n and states (of the world). The former are the good or bad\nstates of affairs that ultimately affect and matter to an agent, while\nthe latter are the features of the world that the agent has no control\nover and which are the locus of her uncertainty about the world. Sets\nof states are called events. This distinction between\noutcomes and states serves to neatly separate desire and belief: the\nformer are, according to Savage\u2019s theory, the target of desire,\nwhile the latter are the target of belief.\n\nThe lottery-like options over which the agent has preferences are a\nrich set of acts that effectively amount to all the possible\nassignments of outcomes to states of the world. That is, acts are\nfunctions from the state space to the outcome space, and the\nagent\u2019s preference ordering is taken to be defined over all such\npossible functions. Some of these acts will look quite sensible:\nconsider the act that assigns to the event \u201cit rains\u201d the\noutcome \u201cmiserable wet stroll\u201d and assigns to the event\n\u201cit does not rain\u201d the outcome \u201cvery comfortable\nstroll\u201d. This is apparently the act of going for a stroll\nwithout one\u2019s umbrella. Other Savage acts will not look quite so\nsensible, such as the constant act that assigns to both\n\u201cit rains\u201d and \u201cit does not rain\u201d the same\noutcome \u201cmiserable wet stroll\u201d. (Note that the constant\nacts provide a way of including sure outcomes within the preference\nordering.) The problem with this act (and many others) is that it does\nnot correspond to anything that an agent could even in principle\nchoose to do or\n perform.[5]\n\nSavage\u2019s act/state(event)/outcome distinction can be naturally\nrepresented in tabular form, with rows serving as acts that yield a\ngiven outcome for each state/event column. Table 2 depicts the two\nacts mentioned above plus a third one that the decision maker might\ncare about: the acts i) \u201cgo for stroll without umbrella\u201d,\nii) \u201cgo for stroll with umbrella\u201d, and iii) the bizarre\nconstant act. Of course, the set of acts required for Savage\u2019s\ntheorem involve even more acts that account for all the possible\ncombinations of states and outcomes.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nno rain\nrain \n\nstroll without umbrella\nvery comfortable stroll\nmiserable wet stroll \n\nstroll with umbrella\ncomfortable stroll\ncomfortable stroll \n\nconstant act\nmiserable wet stroll\nmiserable wet stroll \n\n\nTable 2. Savage-style decision table\n\n\nBefore discussing Savage\u2019s axioms, let us state the result that\nthey give rise to. The following notation will be used: \\(f\\), \\(g\\),\netc, are various acts, i.e., functions from the set \\(\\bS\\) of states\nof the world to the set \\(\\bO\\) of outcomes, with \\(\\bF\\) the set of\nthese functions. \\(f(s_i)\\) denotes the outcome of \\(f\\) when state\n\\(s_i\\in\\bS\\) is actual. The expected utility of \\(f\\), according to\nSavage\u2019s theory, denoted \\(U(f)\\), is given by:\n\n\nSavage\u2019s equation\n\n\\(U(f)=\\sum_i u(f(s_i))\\cdot P(s_i)\\) \n\n\nThe result Savage proved can be stated as\n follows:[6]\n\nTheorem 3 (Savage).\n\nLet \\(\\preceq\\) be a weak preference relation on \\(\\bF\\). If\n\\(\\preceq\\) satisfies Savage\u2019s axioms, then the following holds:\n\n\n\n\nThe agent\u2019s confidence in the actuality of the states in \\(\\bS\\)\ncan be represented by a unique (and finitely additive)\nprobability function, \\(P\\);\n\n\nthe strength of her desires for the ultimate outcomes in \\(\\bO\\) can\nbe represented by a utility function, \\(u\\), that is unique up to\npositive linear transformation;\n\n\nand the pair \\((P, u)\\) gives rise to an expected utility function,\n\\(U\\), that represents her preferences for the alternatives in\n\\(\\bF\\); i.e., for any \\(f, g\\in\\bF\\): \n\n\\[f\\preceq g\\Leftrightarrow U(f)\\leq U(g)\\]\n\n \n\n\n\nThe above result may seem remarkable; in particular, the fact that a\nperson\u2019s preferences can determine a unique probability function\nthat represents her beliefs. On a closer look, however, it is evident\nthat some of our beliefs can be determined by examining our\npreferences. Suppose you are offered a choice between two lotteries,\none that results in you winning a nice prize if a coin comes up heads\nbut getting nothing if the coin comes up tails, another that results\nin you winning the same prize if the coin comes up tails but getting\nnothing if the coin comes up heads. Then assuming that the\ndesirability of the prize (and similarly the desirability of no prize)\nis independent of how the coin lands, your preference between the two\nlotteries should be entirely determined by your comparative beliefs\nfor the two ways in which the coin can land. For instance, if you\nstrictly prefer the first lottery to the second, then that suggests\nyou consider heads more likely than tails.\n\nThe above observation suggests that one can gauge an agent\u2019s\ncomparative beliefs, and perhaps more, from her preferences. Savage\nwent one step further than this, and defined comparative\nbeliefs in terms of preferences. To state Savage\u2019s definition,\nlet \\(\\wcbrel\\) be a weak comparative belief relation, defined on the\nset \\(\\bS\\) of states of the world. (\\(\\cbrel\\) and \\(\\wcbsim\\) are\ndefined in terms of \\(\\wcbrel \\) in the usual way.)\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Comparative Belief).\n\nSuppose \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are two events (i.e., subsets of \\(\\bS\\)).\nSuppose \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are two outcomes and \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) two acts,\nwith the following properties:\n\n\\(f(s_i)=X\\) for all \\(s_i\\in E\\), but \\(f(s_i)=Y\\) for all\n\\(s_i\\not\\in E\\),\n\\(g(s_i)=X\\) for all \\(s_i\\in F\\), but \\(g(s_i)=Y\\) for all\n\\(s_i\\not\\in F\\),\n\\(Y\\preceq X\\).\n\n\nThen \\(E \\wcbrel F\\Leftrightarrow f\\preceq g\\).\n\n\nDefinition 1 is based on the simple observation that one would\ngenerally prefer to stake a good outcome on a more rather than less\nprobable event. But the idea that this defines comparative\nbeliefs might seem questionable. We could, for instance, imagine\npeople who are instrumentally irrational, and as a result fail to\nprefer \\(g\\) to \\(f\\), even when the above conditions all hold and\nthey find \\(F\\) more likely than \\(E\\). Moreover, this definition\nraises the question of how to define the comparative beliefs of those\nwho are indifferent between all outcomes (Eriksson and\nH\u00e1jek 2007). Perhaps no such people exist (and Savage\u2019s\n axiom P5\n indeed makes clear that his result does not pertain to such people).\nNevertheless, it seems a definition of comparative beliefs should not\npreclude that such people, if existent, have strict\ncomparative beliefs. Savage suggests that this definition of\ncomparative beliefs is plausible in light of his axiom P4, which will\nbe stated below. In any case, it turns out that when a person\u2019s\npreferences satisfy Savage\u2019s axioms, we can read off her\npreferences a comparative belief relation that can be represented by a\n(unique) probability function.\n\nWithout further ado, let us state Savage\u2019s axioms in turn. These\nare intended as constraints on an agent\u2019s preference relation,\n\\(\\preceq\\), over a set of acts, \\(\\bF\\), as described above. The\nfirst of Savage\u2019s axioms is the basic ordering axiom.\n\nP1. (Ordering)\n\nThe relation \\(\\preceq\\) is complete and transitive.\n\nThe next axiom is reminiscent of vNM\u2019s Independence axiom. We\nsay that alternative \\(f\\) \u201cagrees with\u201d \\(g\\) in event\n\\(E\\) if, for any state in event \\(E\\), \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) yield the same\noutcome.\n\n\nP2. (Sure Thing Principle)\n\nIf \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(f'\\), \\(g'\\) are such that:\n\n\\(f\\) agrees with \\(g\\) and \\(f'\\) agrees with \\(g'\\) in event\n\\(\\neg E\\),\n\\(f\\) agrees with \\(f'\\) and \\(g\\) agrees with \\(g'\\) in event\n\\(E\\),\nand \\(f\\preceq g\\),\n\n\nthen \\(f'\\preceq g'\\).\n\n\nThe idea behind the Sure Thing Principle (STP) is essentially the same\nas that behind Independence: since we should be able to evaluate each\noutcome independently of other possible outcomes, we can safely ignore\nstates of the world where two acts that we are comparing result in the\nsame outcome. Putting the principle in tabular form may make this more\napparent. The setup involves four acts with the following form: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(E\\)\n\\(\\neg E\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\nX\nZ \n\n\\(g\\)\nY\nZ \n\n\\(f'\\)\nX\nW \n\n\\(g'\\)\nY\nW \n\n\nThe intuition behind the STP is that if \\(g\\) is weakly preferred to\n\\(f\\), then that must be because the consequence \\(Y\\) is considered\nat least as desirable as \\(X\\), which by the same reasoning implies\nthat \\(g'\\) is weakly preferred to \\(f'\\).\n\nSavage also requires that the desirability of an outcome be\nindependent of the state in which it occurs, as this is necessary for\nit to be possible to determine a comparative belief relation from an\nagent\u2019s preferences. To formalise this requirement, Savage\nintroduces the notion of a null event, defined as\nfollows:\n\nDefinition 2 (Null)\n\nEvent E is null just in case for any alternatives\n\\(f,g\\in\\bF\\), \\(f\\sim g\\) given E.\n\nThe intuition is that null events are those events an agent is certain\nwill not occur. If and only if an agent is certain that \\(E\\) will not\noccur, then it is of indifference to her what the acts before her\nyield under \\(E\\). The following axiom then stipulates that knowing\nwhat state is actual does not affect the preference ordering over\noutcomes:\n\nP3. (State Neutrality)\n\nIf \\(f(s_i)=X\\) and \\(g(s_i)=Y\\) whenever \\(s_i\\in E\\) and \\(E\\) is\nnot null, then \\(f\\preceq g\\) given \\(E\\) just in case \\(X\\preceq\nY\\).\n\nThe next axiom is also necessary for it to be possible to determine a\ncomparative belief relation from an agent\u2019s preferences. Above\nit was suggested that by asking you to stake a prize on whether a coin\ncomes up heads or tails, it can be determined which of these events,\nheads or tails, you find more likely. But that suggestion is only\nplausible if the size of the prize does not affect your judgement of\nthe relative likelihood of these two events. That assumption is\ncaptured by the next axioms. Since the axiom is rather complicated it\nwill be stated in tabular form:\n\n\nP4. Consider the following acts:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(E\\)\n\\(\\neg E\\) \n\n\\(f\\) \u00a0\n\\(X\\)\n\\(X'\\) \n\n\\(g\\) \u00a0\n\\(Y\\)\n\\(Y'\\) \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(F\\)\n\\(\\neg F\\) \n\n\\(f'\\)\n\\(X\\)\n\\(X'\\) \n\n\\(g'\\)\n\\(Y\\)\n\\(Y'\\) \n\n\nNow suppose: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nX' &\\preceq X, \\\\\nY' &\\preceq Y,  \\\\\nf' &\\preceq f\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThen \n\n\\[g'\\preceq g.\\]\n\n\n\nLess formally (and stated in terms of strict preference), the idea is\nthat if you prefer to stake the prize \\(X\\) on \\(f\\) rather than\n\\(f'\\), you must consider \\(E\\) more probable than \\(F\\). Therefore,\nyou should prefer to stake the prize \\(Y\\) on \\(g\\) rather than \\(g'\\)\nsince the prize itself does not affect the probability of the\nevents.\n\nThe next axiom is arguably not a rationality requirement, but one of\nSavage\u2019s \u201cstructural axioms\u201d (Suppes 2002). An agent\nneeds to have some variation in preference for it to be possible to\nread off her comparative beliefs from her preferences; and, more\ngenerally, for it to be possible to represent her as maximising\nexpected utility. To this end, the next axiom simply requires that\nthere be some alternatives between which the agent is not\nindifferent:\n\nP5.\n\nThere are some \\(f,g\\in\\bF\\) such that \\(f\\prec g\\).\n\nWhen these five axioms are satisfied, the agent\u2019s preferences\ngive rise to a comparative belief relation, \\(\\wcbrel \\), which has\nthe property of being a qualitative probability relation,\nwhich is necessary for it to be possible to represent \\(\\wcbrel \\) by\na probability function. In other words, \\(\\wcbrel \\) satisfies the\nfollowing three conditions, for any events \\(E\\), \\(F\\) and \\(G\\):\n\n\n\n\\(\\wcbrel \\) is transitive and complete,\n\n\nif \\(E\\cap G=\\emptyset=F\\cap G\\), then \\(E \\wcbrel F\\Leftrightarrow\nE\\cup G \\wcbrel F\\cup G\\),\n\n\n\\(\\emptyset \\wcbrel E,\\) \u00a0 \\(\\emptyset \\cbrel \\bS\\)\n\n\nBeing a qualitative probability relation is, however, not sufficient\nto ensure the possibility of probabilistic representation. To ensure\nthis possibility, Savage added the following structural axiom:\n\n\nP6. (Non-atomicity)\n\nSuppose \\(f\\prec g\\). Then for any \\(X\\in\\bO\\), there is a\nfinite partition, \\(\\{E_1, E_2, \u2026 E_m\\}\\), of \\(\\bS\\) such\nthat:\n\n \\(f'(s_i)=X\\) for any \\(s_i\\in E_j\\), but \\(f'(s_i)=f(s_i)\\) for\nany \\(s_i\\not\\in E_j\\),\n \\(g'(s_i)=X\\) for any \\(s_i\\in E_j\\), but \\(g'(s_i)=g(s_i)\\) for\nany \\(s_i\\not\\in E_j\\),\n \\(f'\\prec g\\) and \\(f\\prec g'\\).\n\n\n\nLike the Continuity axiom of vNM, Non-Atomicity implies that no matter\nhow bad an outcome \\(X\\) is, if \\(g\\) is already preferred to \\(f\\),\nthen if we add \\(X\\) as one of the possible outcomes of\n\\(f\\)\u2014thereby constructing a new alternative \\(f'\\)\u2014\\(g\\)\nwill still be preferred to the modified alternative as long as the\nprobability of \\(X\\) is sufficiently small. In effect, Non-Atomicity\nimplies that \\(\\bS\\) contains events of arbitrarily small probability.\nIt is not too difficult to imagine how that could be satisfied. For\ninstance, any event \\(F\\) can be partitioned into two equiprobable\nsub-events according to whether some coin would come up heads or tails\nif it were tossed. Each sub-event could be similarly partitioned\naccording to the outcome of the second toss of the same coin, and so\non.\n\nSavage showed that whenever these six axioms are satisfied, the\ncomparative belief relation can be represented by a unique\nprobability function. Having done so, he could rely on the vNM\nrepresentation theorem to show that an agent who satisfies all six\n axioms[7]\n can be represented as maximising expected utility, relative to a\nunique probability function that plausibly represents the\nagent\u2019s beliefs over the states and a cardinal utility function\nthat plausibly represents the agent\u2019s desires for ultimate\noutcomes (recall the statement of Savage\u2019s theorem\n above).[8]\n Savage\u2019s own proof is rather complicated, but Kreps (1988)\nprovides a useful illustration of it.\n\nThere is no doubt that Savage\u2019s expected utility\nrepresentation theorem is very powerful. There are, however, two\nimportant questions to ask about whether Savage achieves his aims: 1)\nDoes Savage characterise rational preferences, at least in\nthe generic sense? And 2) Does Savage\u2019s theorem tell us how to\nmake rational decisions in the real world? Savage\u2019s theory has\nproblems meeting these two demands, taken together. Arguably the core\nweakness of the theory is that its various constraints and assumptions\npull in different directions when it comes to constructing realistic\ndecision models, and furthermore, at least one constraint (notably,\nthe Sure Thing Principle) is only plausible under decision modelling\nassumptions that are supposed to be the output, not the input, of the\ntheory.\n\nOne well recognised decision-modelling requirement for Savage\u2019s\ntheory is that outcomes be maximally specific in every way that\nmatters for their evaluation. If this were not the case, the axiom of\nState Neutrality, for instance, would be a very implausible\nrationality constraint. Suppose we are, for example, wondering whether\nto buy cocoa or lemonade for the weekend, and assume that how good we\nfind each option depends on what the weather will be like. Then we\nneed to describe the outcomes such that they include the state of the\nweather. For if we do not, the desirability of the outcomes will\ndepend on what state is actual. Since lemonade is, let us suppose,\nbetter on hot days than cold, an outcome like \u201cI drink lemonade\nthis weekend\u201d would be more or less desirable depending on\nwhether it occurs in a state where it is hot or cold. This would be\ncontrary to the axiom of State Neutrality. Therefore, the appropriate\noutcomes in this case are those of the form \u201cI drink lemonade\nthis weekend in hot weather\u201d. (Of course, this outcome must be\nsplit into even more fine-grained outcomes if there are yet further\nfeatures that would affect the choice at hand, such as sharing the\ndrink with a friend who loves lemonade versus sharing the drink with a\nfriend who loves hot cocoa, and so on.)\n\nThe fact that the outcomes in the above case must be specific enough\nto contain the state of the weather may seem rather innocuous.\nHowever, this requirement exacerbates the above-mentioned problem that\nmany of the options/acts that Savage requires for his representation\ntheorem are nonsensical, in that the semantic content of state/outcome\npairs is contradictory. Recall that the domain of the preference\nordering in Savage\u2019s theory amounts to every function\nfrom the set of states to the set of outcomes (what Broome 1991a\nrefers to as the Rectangular Field Assumption). So if\n\u201cI drink lemonade this weekend in hot weather\u201d is one of\nthe outcomes we are working with, and we have partitioned the set of\nstates according to the weather, then there must, for instance, be an\nact that has this outcome in the state where it is cold! The more\ndetailed the outcomes (as required for the plausibility of State\nNeutrality), the less plausible the Rectangular Field Assumption. This\nis an internal tension in Savage\u2019s framework. Indeed, it is\ndifficult to see how/why a rational agent can/should form preferences\nover nonsensical acts (although see Dreier 1996 for an argument that\nthis is not such an important issue). Without this assumption,\nhowever, the agent\u2019s preference ordering will not be adequately\nrich for Savage\u2019s rationality constraints to yield the EU\nrepresentation\n result.[9]\n\nThe axiom in Savage\u2019s theory that has received most attention is\nthe Sure Thing Principle. It is not hard to see that this principle\nconflicts with Allais\u2019 preferences for the same reason these\npreferences conflict with Independence (recall\n Section 2.3).\n Allais\u2019 challenge will be discussed again later. For now, our\nconcern is rather the Sure Thing Principle vis-\u00e0-vis the\ninternal logic of Savage\u2019s theory. To begin with, the Sure Thing\nPrinciple, like State Neutrality, exacerbates concerns about the\nRectangular Field Assumption. This is because the Sure Thing Principle\nis only plausible if outcomes are specific enough to account for any\nsort of dependencies between outcomes in different states of the\nworld. For instance, if the fact that one could have chosen a\nrisk-free alternative\u2014and thereby guaranteed an acceptable\noutcome\u2014makes a difference to the desirability of receiving\nnothing after having taken a risk (as in Allais\u2019 problem), then\nthat has to be accounted for in the description of the outcomes. But\nagain, if we account for such dependencies in the description of the\noutcomes, we run into the problem that there will be acts in the\npreference ordering that are nonsensical (see, e.g., Broome 1991a: ch.\n5).\n\nThere is a further internal problem with Savage\u2019s theory\nassociated with the Sure Thing Principle: the principle is only\nreasonable when the decision model is constructed such that there is\nprobabilistic independence between the acts an agent is considering\nand the states of the world that determine the outcomes of these acts.\nRecall that the principle states that if we have four options with the\nfollowing form: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(E\\)\n\\(\\neg E\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\nX\nZ \n\n\\(g\\)\nY\nZ \n\n\\(f'\\)\nX\nW \n\n\\(g'\\)\nY\nW \n\n\nthen if \\(g\\) is weakly preferred to \\(f\\), \\(g'\\) must be weakly\npreferred to \\(f'\\). Suppose, however, that there is probabilistic\ndependency between the states of the world and the alternatives we are\nconsidering, and that we find \\(Z\\) to be better than both \\(X\\) and\n\\(Y\\), and we also find \\(W\\) to be better than both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nMoreover, suppose that \\(g\\) makes \\(\\neg E\\) more likely than \\(f\\)\ndoes, and \\(f'\\) makes \\(\\neg E\\) more likely than \\(g'\\) does. Then\nit seems perfectly reasonable to prefer \\(g\\) over \\(f\\) but \\(f'\\)\nover \\(g'\\).\n\nWhy is the requirement of probabilistic independence problematic? For\none thing, in many real-world decision circumstances, it is hard to\nframe the decision model in such a way that states are intuitively\nprobabilistically independent of acts. For instance, suppose an agent\nenjoys smoking, and is trying to decide whether to quit or not. How\nlong she lives is amongst the contingencies that affect the\ndesirability of smoking. It would be natural to partition the set of\nstates according to how long the agent lives. But then it is obvious\nthat the options she is considering could, and arguably should, affect\nhow likely she finds each state of the world, since it is well\nrecognised that life expectancy is reduced by smoking. Savage would\nthus require an alternative representation of the decision\nproblem\u2014the states do not reference life span directly, but\nrather the agent\u2019s physiological propensity to react in a\ncertain way to smoking.\n\nPerhaps there is always a way to contrive decision models such that\nacts are intuitively probabilistically independent of states. But\ntherein lies the more serious problem. Recall that Savage was trying\nto formulate a way of determining a rational agent\u2019s beliefs\nfrom her preferences over acts, such that the beliefs can ultimately\nbe represented by a probability function. If we are interested in\nreal-world decisions, then the acts in question ought to be\nrecognisable options for the agent (which we have seen is\nquestionable). Moreover, now we see that one of Savage\u2019s\nrationality constraints on preference\u2014the Sure Thing\nPrinciple\u2014is plausible only if the modelled acts are\nprobabilistically independent of the states. In other words, this\nindependence must be built into the decision model if it is to\nfacilitate appropriate measures of belief and desire. But this is to\nassume that we already have important information about the beliefs of\nthe agent whose attitudes we are trying to represent; namely what\nstate-partitions she considers probabilistically independent of her\nacts.\n\nThe above problems suggest there is a need for an alternative theory\nof choice under uncertainty. Richard Jeffrey\u2019s theory, which\nwill be discuss next, avoids all of the problems that have been\ndiscussed so far. But as we will see, Jeffrey\u2019s theory has\nwell-known problems of its own, albeit problems that are not\ninsurmountable.\n",
