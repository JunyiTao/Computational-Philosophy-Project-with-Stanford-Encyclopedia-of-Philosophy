    "main_text": "Being Parents || Parental Rights\n5.2 Parental Responsibilities\n\nParenthood inhabits the intersection of two distinct relationships: a\ncustodial relationship between parent and child, and a trustee\nrelationship between the parents and the larger society or other\ncollective. Both may generate responsibilities.\n\nThe custodial relationship involves a set of duties aimed at, and\njustified by, the welfare of the child. As custodian, the parent is\nunder a limited obligation to work for and organize his or her life\naround the welfare and development of the child, for the child\u2019s\nsake. Analysis of the content of parental responsibilities has\ntherefore mostly focused on the rights of the child. Feinberg\u2019s\nright to an \u201copen future\u201d can be read as a limit on\nparental discretion (see 5.1). It can also be interpreted as giving\nchildren positive claims to certain goods, such as an education that\nleaves them with a wide range of valuable life plans to choose from.\nWhether there is such a positive right and in what it consists are\nmatters of dispute (Liao 2015; Mills 2003; Lotz 2006 and 2014; Millum\n2014; essays in Archard and Macleod 2002; entry on\n children\u2019s rights).\n Another question is whether parental responsibilities end when the\nchild reaches adulthood, or whether they are lifelong (Weinberg\n2018).\n\nSocieties, families, and cultural groups also have interests in the\nwelfare of children. For instance, the state has an interest in the\nreproduction of its workforce and its citizens; hence parental\ndecisions that threaten the child\u2019s chances of becoming a fully\nparticipating citizen may come under special state scrutiny. Distinct\ngroups, such as the state and cultural groups, may make conflicting\nclaims on the parents as trustees. For instance, in order to promote\nculturally prescribed norms, parents might seek to remove their child\nfrom school, or have their daughter undergo clitoridectomy; yet the\nstate may claim that such a decision violates the parents\u2019\ntrustee relationship on grounds that the state has a compelling\ninterest in securing the full citizenship capacities and rights of its\ncitizens (Galston 1995; Okin 1989; Chambers 2017, Chapter 6).\nMoreover, discharging parental responsibilities must be balanced with\ndischarging obligations of distributive and global justice (Archard\nand Macleod 2002, Part III; Macleod 2010).\n\nIndeed, some philosophers argue that parental responsibilities include\nduties towards social or environmental justice. For example, parents\narguably have a duty of egalitarian justice to guide their children\naway from \u201cexpensive consumption habits\u201d (Zwarthoed 2017).\nThey may, as parents, have duties to address climate change, on behalf\nof their children\u2019s, or children\u2019s children\u2019s,\ninterests (Cripps 2017; see also Gheaus 2016a, 2019). This may also\napply to special duties of adoptive parents, especially in\ninter-racial adoptions (Haslanger and Witt 2006, see also Baylis and\nMcLeod 2014).\n\nAll parents fail to meet their responsibilities at some point. We\nwould not expect someone to raise a child without making mistakes\nalong the way. However, at some point, excusable parental failings\nshade into neglect and abuse. Exactly what counts as child abuse is a\nmatter for debate. However, if abuse marks a threshold above which it\nis permissible for others\u2014particularly the state\u2014to\nintervene, then a clear definition is needed (Archard 2004, chap.\n14).\n\nBy the time neglect or abuse has reached the point that the state\nintervenes, irreparable damage has often been caused, and the actions\nthat can be taken to improve a child\u2019s situation are likely to\nbe limited. Some philosophers argue that prospective parents should be\nscreened ahead of time for their ability to parent and those who are\ndeemed unlikely to be able to fulfill their parental responsibilities\nshould not be granted parental licenses. The argument in favor of\nlicensing parents may appeal primarily to the harms to children that\noccur if unfit people are allowed to parent (LaFollette 1980, 2010) or\nto the wider impact on society from rearing children who are unlikely\nto become good citizens (McFall 2009). Either way proposals for\nparental licensing schemes must show that it is possible prospectively\nto identify individuals who are likely to be neglectful or abusive\nparents with sufficient accuracy, show that the schemes do not violate\nthe rights of prospective parents (on this see Liao 2015), and explain\nhow they are to be enforced. The latter is perhaps the hardest\nchallenge: without resorting to compulsory sterilization how can\npeople be prevented from having children without licenses? (McFall\n2009, 122) Of course, there could be penalties for unlicensed parents,\nor their children could be subject to confiscation, but such policies\nrisk inadvertently penalizing the children they were intended to\nassist. Moreover, enforcement would disproportionately burden women.\nAs gestators, women might be subjected to de facto forced abortions;\nwomen are also more likely to be primary caregivers, and thus\nsubjected to greater interference and monitoring (Engster 2010). A\nfurther question is whether onerous licensing policies for adoptive\nparents can be justified in the absence of more general parental\nlicensing schemes (McLeod and Botterell 2014).\n\nFinally, children need a great deal of care if they are to grow up\ninto autonomous, healthy adults and good citizens. Parents clearly\nhave the responsibility to provide some of this care, and the state\nhas the obligation to step in when parents are failing to do as they\nshould. However, there is an open question about what the state should\nprovide in cases that do not involve abuse or neglect. As Alstott has\nargued, parenting imposes opportunity costs on parents, for example,\nin earning potential. Moreover, child-care labor remains\ngender-structured, with women performing by far the greater share. On\nthese grounds Alstott argues for caregiver accounts to ensure equal\nopportunity, for example, allocating educational funds to parents\n(Alstott 2004). One pertinent question is whether parenting should be\nconsidered a private good, like an expensive taste which it would be\nunjust for society to subsidize (Taylor 2009). Some have responded\nthat it is a matter of justice due to its effects on equal opportunity\nfor women and full participation of women as equal citizens (Okin\n1989; Kittay 1999; Schouten 2019). Others have argued for collective\nsocial responsibility for children on grounds such as children\u2019s\nwelfare and their status as a public good, providing positive\nexternalities by reproducing society and producing workers who will\nsupport the current generation in old age (George 1987; Archard 2004;\nEngster 2010; Olsaretti 2013; Millum 2017).\n",
