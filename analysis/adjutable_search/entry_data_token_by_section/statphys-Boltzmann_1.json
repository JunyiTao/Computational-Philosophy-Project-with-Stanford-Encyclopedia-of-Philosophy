    "main_text": "Introduction || Debates and controversies\n1.2 Debates and controversies\n\n\nBoltzmann was involved in various disputes. But this is not to say\nthat he was the innocent victim of hostilities. In many cases he took\nthe initiative by launching a polemic attack on his colleagues. I will\nfocus below on the most important disputes: with Mach and Ostwald on\nthe reality of atoms; and with colleagues who criticized Boltzmann's\nown work in the form of the famous reversibility objection (Loschmidt)\nand the recurrence objection (Zermelo). For a wider sketch of how\ncontemporary scientists took position in the debate on the topics of\nmechanism and irreversibility I refer to (van Strien 2013).  \n\n\nOstwald and Mach clearly resisted the atomic view of matter (although\nfor different reasons). Boltzmann certainly defended and promoted this\nview. But he was not the naive realist or unabashed believer in the\nexistence of atoms that the more popular literature has made of\nhim. Instead, he stressed from the 1880s onwards that the atomic view\nyielded at best an analogy, or a picture or model of reality (cf. de\nRegt 1999).  In his debate with Mach he advocated (1897c, 1897d) this\napproach as a useful or economical way to understand the thermal\nbehavior of gases. This means that his views were quite compatible\nwith Mach's views on the goal of \n science.[2]\n What divided them was more a\nstrategic issue. Boltzmann claimed that no approach in natural science\nthat avoids hypotheses completely could ever succeed. He argued that\nthose who reject the atomic hypothesis in favor of a continuum view of\nmatter were guilty of adopting hypotheses too. Ultimately, the choice\nbetween such views should depend on their fruitfulness, and here\nBoltzmann had no doubt that the atomic hypothesis would be\n more\n successful.[3]\n\n\nIn the case of Ostwald, and his \u2018energetics\u2019, Boltzmann\ndid become involved in a more heated dispute at a meeting in\nL\u00fcbeck in 1895.  Roughly speaking, energetics presented a\nconception of nature that took energy as the most fundamental physical\nentity, and thus represented physical processes as transformations of\nvarious forms of energy. It resisted attempts to comprehend energy, or\nthese transformations in terms of mechanical pictures.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that in the 1890s \u201cthe adherents of energetics\nreigned supreme in the German school and even throughout Europe\u201d\n(Dugas 1959, 82). But this is surely a great exaggeration. It seems\ncloser to the truth to say that energetics represented a rather small\n(but vocal) minority in the physics community, that claimed to put\nforward a seemingly attractive conception of natural science, and\nbeing promoted in the mid-90s by reputed scientists, could no longer\nbe dismissed as the work of amateurs (cf. Deltete 1999).\n\n\nThe 1895 gathering of the Naturforscherversammlung in\nL\u00fcbeck (the annual meeting of physicists, chemists, biologists\nand physicians) was programmed to devote special sessions to the state\nof the art of energetics. Boltzmann, who was member of the programme\ncommittee, had already shown interest in the development of energetics\nin private correspondence with Ostwald. Georg Helm was asked to\nprepare a report, and at Boltzmann's own suggestion, Ostwald also\ncontributed a lecture.  All agreed that the meeting should follow the\n\u201cBritish style\u201d, i.e.,  manuscripts would be circulated beforehand and\nthere would be ample room for discussion, following the example of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science meeting that\nBoltzmann had attended the previous year.\n\n\nBoth Helm and Ostwald, apparently, anticipated that they would have\nthe opportunity to discuss their views on energetics in an open-minded\natmosphere. But at the meeting Boltzmann surprised them with\ndevastating criticism. According to those who were present Boltzmann\nwas the clear winner of the\n debate.[4] \n Yet the energeticists experienced the confrontation as an ambush\n(H\u00f6flechner 1994, I, 169), for which he had not been\nprepared. Nevertheless, Boltzmann and Ostwald remained friends, and in\n1902 Ostwald made a great effort to persuade his home university in\nLeipzig to appoint Boltzmann (cf. Blackmore 1995, 61\u201365).\n\n\nNeither is there any hostile attitude in the famous\n\u2018reversibility objection\u2019 by Loschmidt in 1875. Loschmidt\nwas Boltzmann's former teacher and later colleague at the University\nof Vienna, and a life-long friend. He had no philosophical\nreservations against the existence of atoms at all. (Indeed, he is\nbest known for his estimate of their size.) Rather, his main objection\nwas against the prediction by Maxwell and Boltzmann that a gas column\nin thermal equilibrium in a gravitational field has the same\ntemperature at all heights. His now famous reversibility objection\narose in his attempts to undermine this prediction. Whether Boltzmann\nsucceeded in refuting the objection or not is still a matter of\ndispute, as we shall see below (section 4.1).\n\n\nZermelo's opposition had a quite different background. When he put\nforward the recurrence objection in 1896, he was an assistant\nto Planck in Berlin. And like his mentor, he did not favor the\nmechanical underpinning of thermal phenomena. Yet his 1896 paper\n(Zermelo 1896a) is by no means hostile.  It presents a careful logical\nargument that leads him to a dilemma: thermodynamics with its Second\nLaw on the one hand and gas theory (in the form as Zermelo understood\nit) on the other cannot both be literally true.  By contrast, it is\nBoltzmann's (1896b) reaction to Zermelo, drenched in sarcasm and\nbitterness which (if anything) may have led to hostile feelings\nbetween these two authors. In any case, the tone of Zermelo's (1896b)\nis considerably sharper.  Still, Zermelo maintained a keen, yet\ncritical, interest in gas theory and statistical physics, and\nsubsequently played an important role in making Gibbs' work known in\nGermany.\n\n\nIn fact, I think that Boltzmann's rather aggressive reactions to\nZermelo and Ostwald should be compared to other polemical exchanges in\nwhich he was involved, and sometimes initiated himself (e.g. against\nClausius, Tait, Planck, and Bertrand \u2014 not to mention his essay on\nSchopenhauer). It seems to me that Boltzmann enjoyed polemics, and the\nuse of sharp language for rhetorical \n effect.[5] \n Boltzmann's complaints in 1896\u20131898 about an hostile environment are,\nI think, partly explained by his love of polemic exaggerations, partly\nalso by his mental depression in that period. (See H\u00f6flechner\n1994, 198\u2013202) for details.) Certainly, the debates with Ostwald\nand Zermelo might well have contributed to this personal crisis. But\nit would be wrong to interpret Boltzmann's plaintive moods as evidence\nthat his critics were, in fact, hostile.\n\n\nEven today, commentators on Boltzmann's works are divided in their\nopinion. Some praise them as brilliant and exceptionally clear. Often\none finds passages suggesting he possessed all the right answers all\nalong the way \u2014 or at least in his later writings, while his\ncritics were simply prejudiced, confused or misguided (von Plato,\nLebowitz, Kac, Bricmont, Goldstein). Others (Ehrenfests, Klein,\nTruesdell) have emphasized that Boltzmann's work is not always clear\nand that he often failed to indicate crucial assumptions or important\nchanges in his position, while friendly critics helped him in\nclarifying and developing his views.\n\n\nFans and critics of Boltzmann's work alike agree that he pioneered\nmuch of the approaches currently used in statistical physics, but also\nthat he did not leave behind a unified coherent theory. His scientific\npapers, collected in Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, contain\nmore than 100 papers on statistical physics alone. Some of these\npapers are forbiddingly long, full of tedious calculations and lack a\nclear coherent structure. Sometimes, vital assumptions, or even a\ncomplete change of approach, are stated only somewhere tucked away\nbetween the calculations, or at the very last page. Even Maxwell, who\nmight have been in the best position to appreciate Boltzmann's work,\nexpressed his difficulty with Boltzmann's longwindedness (in a letter\nto Tait, August 1873; see Garber, Brush, and Everett 1995,\n123).[6] But not\nall of his prose is cumbersome and heavy-going. Boltzmann at his best\ncould be witty, passionate and a delight to read. He excelled in such\nqualities in much of his popular work and some of his polemical\narticles.\n",
