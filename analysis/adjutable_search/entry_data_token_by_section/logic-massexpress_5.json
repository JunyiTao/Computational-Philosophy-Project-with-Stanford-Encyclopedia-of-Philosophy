The mixed set-theoretic and mereological approach\n\n\nFrom what precedes, one may be tempted to draw the following\nlessons:\n\n Mass predication (as in This is water) should not be\nunderstood in terms of parthood, but in terms of set membership.\n The denotation of a mass noun M (the set whose elements\nare everything that is M) should be the join semi-lattice generated by\nthe sum or join operation on portions of\n M.[10]\n\n\n\nThis solves the problems encountered above by the purely\nmereological approach and the purely set-theoretic approach. Indeed,\nwhat precedes suggests that mass predication (to be M), like\ncount predication or adjectival predication, is well rendered in terms\nof set membership. The purely set-theoretic approach has problems with\ndefinite descriptions because it just uses sets, avoiding sums. But as\nwe saw earlier, mass nouns have the property of cumulative reference.\nIf there is some clay in two cups, then one can refer to all of the\nclay as the clay in the two cups. This suggests that portions of clay\ncan be summed, and that the set of portions of clay should have the\nstructure of a join semi-lattice. When this is guaranteed for any mass\nnoun M, the semantic value of definite descriptions can easily\nbe specified. The description the M that Q denotes the sum of\neverything that is some M that Q. It is such a sum that is weighted in\nThe gold on the table weighs fifty grams. And it is such a sum\nwhose identity over time is asserted in The clay that was on the\ndesk on July 1st is identical with the clay that was on the\n table on July 2nd. (Another treatment of identity over time is presented in \nsection 9.)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we arrive at the mixed set-theoretic and mereological\napproach:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286\n[M]\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P]\n\u2260 \u2205\nThe M (that Q) P is true iff [the M (that Q)]\n\u2286 [P],\n\nwhere [this] is the set having for sole member the sum of\nwhat is demonstrated, [M] is the set of everything that is M\n(a join semi-lattice), [the M (that Q)] is the\nset having for sole member the sum of everything that is some M (that\nQ), [P] is the set having for members everything that P.\n\n\nThis\noffers a simple way to accommodate the hindsights of the set-theoretic\nand mereological approaches, while avoiding the previous pitfalls. A\ndecisive advantage of this view over the purely mereological one is\nthat the overall framework for doing semantics remains the usual one,\nset theory. Gillon (1992) and Nicolas (2010) can be seen as instances\nof such a mixed view,[11] with an additional component, namely\n\u201caggregations\u201d or \u201ccoverings\u201d\n(see section 8 below).\n",
