    "main_text": "Psychoanalysis and Utopian Vision || The Ideology of Scarcity\n4.4 The Ideology of Scarcity\n\n\nOne of the most important features of Marcuse\u2019s work is his\ndialectical analysis of western society. In his work he tries to\nbring attention to the co-existence of possibilities for liberation and\nthe further development of mechanisms of domination. Our society\nproduces the necessary conditions for freedom while at the same time\nproducing greater oppression.\n\n\nThe very progress of civilization under the performance principle has\nattained a level of productivity at which the social demands upon\ninstinctual energy to be spent in alienated labor could be\nconsiderably reduced (Marcuse 1955: 129)\n\n\nThe capitalist performance principle (the maximization of production\nand profit) has actually created the preconditions for a qualitatively\ndifferent and non-repressive form of life. However, we have not\nentered into this new form of life as more repression is\ndemanded. \n Individual workers continue to engage in alienating labor although\ntheir labor has produced enough wealth to sustain them without ongoing\ntoil. The problem is that the capitalist system is structured in such\na way that all of the wealth goes to the minority who own or control\nthe means of production. Although wealth is socially produced, its\nownership and use is restricted to a few individuals. Hence the\nconcept of scarcity has become obsolete and is used in an ideological\nsense to control the worker. The inhibitions and forms of repression\nthat the worker must impose on himself so that he may direct his\nlibidinal energy toward work goes beyond producing the goods that he\nneeds for survival and instead produces extreme wealth for the\ncapitalist. It is here where Marcuse, relying on his distinction\nbetween basic and surplus repression, goes beyond Freud. Regarding\nFreud\u2019s metapsychology Marcuse says:\n\n\nFor his metapsychology, it is not decisive whether the inhibitions are\nimposed by scarcity or by the hierarchical distribution of\nscarcity, by the struggle for existence or by the interest in\ndomination. (Marcuse 1955: 134)\n\nMarcuse\u2019s point is that in advanced industrial societies there\nis no longer a problem with acquiring the resources needed for existence\nor even the optimum life for members of those societies. The\nproblem is with the fair and just distribution of resources. The\nvery existence of the concept of scarcity in this age functions\nideologically and supports the domination of the worker by the\ncapitalist. \n",
