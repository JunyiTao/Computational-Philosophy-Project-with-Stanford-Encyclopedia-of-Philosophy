    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Libertarianism\n3.2 Libertarianism\n\nLibertarianism and economic liberalism represent\nminimalist positions in relation to distributive justice. Citing\nLocke, they both postulate an original right to freedom and property,\nthus arguing against redistribution and social rights and for the free\nmarket (Nozick 1974; Hayek 1960). They assert an opposition between\nequality and freedom: the individual (natural) right to freedom can be\nlimited only for the sake of foreign and domestic peace. For this\nreason, libertarians consider maintaining public order the state\u2019s\nonly legitimate duty. They assert a natural right to self-ownership\n(the philosophical term for \u201cownership of oneself\u201d \u2013\ni.e., one\u2019s will, body, work, etc.) that entitles everybody to\nhitherto unowned bits of the external world by means of mixing their\nlabor with it. All individuals can thus claim property if\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d is left over for others (Locke\u2019s\nproviso). Correspondingly, they defend market freedoms and oppose the\nuse of redistributive taxation schemes for the sake of egalitarian\nsocial justice. A principal objection to libertarian theory is that\nits interpretation of the Lockean proviso \u2013 nobody\u2019s situation\nshould be worsened through an initial acquisition of property \u2013\nleads to an excessively weak requirement and is thus unacceptable\n(Kymlicka 1990, pp.108\u2013117). However, with a broader and more adequate\ninterpretation of what it means for one a situation to be worse than\nanother, it is much more difficult to justify private appropriation\nand, a fortiori, all further ownership rights. If the proviso\nrecognizes the full range of interests and alternatives that\nself-owners have, then it will not generate unrestricted rights over\nunequal amounts of resources. Another objection is that precisely if\none\u2019s own free accomplishment is what is meant to count, as the\nlibertarians argue, success should not depend strictly on luck,\nextraordinary natural gifts, inherited property, and status. In other\nwords, equal opportunity also needs to at least be present as\na counterbalance, ensuring that the fate of human beings is determined\nby their decisions and not by unavoidable social circumstances. Equal\nopportunity thus seems to be the frequently vague minimal formula at\nwork in every egalitarian conception of distributive justice. Many\negalitarians, however, wish for more \u2013 namely, an equality\nof (at least basic) life conditions.\n\nIn any event, with a shift away from a strictly negative idea of\nfreedom, economic liberalism can indeed itself point the way to more\nsocial and economic equality. For with such a shift, what is at stake\nis not only assuring an equal right to self-defense, but also\nfurnishing everyone more or less the same chance to actually make use\nof the right to freedom (e.g. Van Parijs 1995, Steiner 1994, Otsuka\n2005). In other words, certain basic goods need to be furnished to\nassure the equitable or \u201cfair value of the basic\nliberties\u201d (Rawls 1993, pp. 356\u201363).\n",
