    "main_text": "Cosmic Landscape, Soul Landscape: From Heavenly Circuits to Human Return\n6. Cosmic Landscape, Soul Landscape: From Heavenly Circuits to Human Return\n\n\nIbn Gabirol can be seen as offering us a revised version of the\nNeoplatonic great chain of being, adding an emphasis on Will, matter\nand form (and, in light of section 5, we might say a number of levels\nof matters and forms). With other Jewish Neoplatonists (see Isaac\nIsraeli for example), Ibn Gabirol also envisions not one but three\nWorld Souls, and a Universal Intellect which he describes in his\nKeter Malkhut [Kingdom's Crown] as \u201cthe\nSphere of Intellect\u201d (in his Hebrew, galgal\nha-s\u00e2khel), an odd and creative locution which blurs\nastronomical and metaphysical conceptions: generally the languages of\n\u201csphere\u201d and \u201cintellect\u201d do not mix, the former\nreferring to the celestial realm, and the latter referring to\nsomething well beyond the celestial realm. To these Neoplatonic layers\nof Intellect and Souls, and following mostly in the spirit of astronomy\nof his day (with the exception, that is, of his positing Intellect as a\nso-called \u201c10th sphere\u201d in contrast to the more\naccepted Ptolemaic system of 9 spheres; see Tanenbaum 1996 and Loewe\n1979), Ibn Gabirol also envisions a hierarchy of star fields and\nplanetary orbs, a cosmic picture which he lays out in great detail in\nhis Keter Malkhut poem. Moving from God outward, we find the\nlayers as follows:\n\n(God)\n10. \u201cSphere of Intellect\u201d (galgal ha-s\u00eakhel) (cantos 24\u201325)\n9. Encompassing Sphere (canto 23)\n8. Zodiac / Fixed Stars (cantos 21\u201322)\n7. Saturn (canto 20)\n6. Jupiter (canto 19)\n5. Mars (canto 18)\n4. Sun (cantos 15\u201317)\n3. Venus (canto 14)\n2. Mercury (canto 13)\n1. Moon (cantos 11\u201312)\n(Earth)\n\n\n\nAbove even the \u201cSphere of Intellect\u201d is the Divine\nThrone, which we know from the Fons Vitae refers to pure\nuniversal matter \u201cbetween\u201d God and Intellect (on matter as\nThrone, see Fons Vitae 5.42, p. 335, lines 23\u20134; for a great\ndiagram see Loewe 1989, p. 114).\n\n\nIt should be noted that it is in reference to the above chart of the\ncelestial levels of stars and planets that we find in various medieval\nMuslim and Jewish thinkers\u2014for example in al-Farabi and in\nMaimonides\u2014a Neoplatonized Aristotelian focus on a hierarchy of\n\u201cseparate intellects,\u201d the last of which (generally\nconstrued as the 10th intellect lowest down\u2014with God\nconceived either as the first such Intellect or as an Intellect above\nthis enumeration altogether) being described as the \u201cActive Intellect\u201d\nwhich governs the sublunar realm, and is that to which human minds\n\u201cconjoin\u201d (through the process of\n ittis\u00e2l).[32]\nIt is important to\ndistinguish this system from the one at play in Ibn Gabirol: whereas\nal-Farabi, Maimonides, and others focus their attention on a Return to\n(or a \u201cconjunction with\u201d) the 10th lowest down\nof the separate intellects (the Active Intellect as the intellect\nassociated with our earthly realm below the moon), Ibn Gabirol's\nfocus is, as in Plotinus, on an Intellect at the very heights of the\ncelestial world, and just outside of God's own being: Whereas Ibn\nGabirol's \u201c10th sphere\u201d is a Sphere of Intellect just\noutside of God, Maimonides' \u201c10th\nIntellect\u201d corresponds to the sphere of Moon (just above Earth).\nThis point is often confused in secondary literature, and can lead to\nproblematic misunderstandings and misconstrued correlations between\nphilosophical systems.\n\n\nReturning full circle to our start (see section 3), Ibn\nGabirol's emphasis even in his elaboration on a celestial\nhierarchy centers on the Neoplatonic concern with the cultivation of\nthe human soul\u2014its Return to its highest fullness in Intellect:\nfrom a series of planets, we immediately move to Intellect\n(\u201cgalgal ha-s\u00eakhel\u201d), the ground and goal of\nthe virtuous human life.\n\nStudent: What is the purpose of man?\n\nTeacher: The inclination of his soul to the higher world in order\nthat everyone might return to his like.\n\n(Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 23\u20135)\n\n",
