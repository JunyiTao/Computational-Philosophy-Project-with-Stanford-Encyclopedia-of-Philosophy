    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Reason || Romantic Poetry and Romantic Irony\n2.2 Romantic Poetry and Romantic Irony\n\n\u201cRomantic Poetry\u201d is a notion that Friedrich Schlegel\ncoined and described in most detail in Athenaeum Fragments\n(AF) number 116. Rather than a particular genre or kind of poetry,\nRomantic Poetry is poetry as such insofar as \u201call poetry is or\nshould be romantic\u201d (Schlegel, AF: #116). Romantic Poetry brings\nout the limits of reason in virtue of being reflective,\n\u201c[hovering] on the wings of poetic reflection, and [capable of\nraising] that reflection again and again to a higher power\u201d (AF:\n#116). Rather than being merely the \u201cportrayed\u201d object\nitself\u2014a poetic representation\u2014it \u201chover[s] at the\nmidpoint between the portrayed and the portrayer\u201d (AF: #116),\nand so, like Kant\u2019s transcendental philosophy, reflects on the\nconditions of its own possibility and of human mindedness itself. It\nis not surprising, then, that Romantic Poetry is called\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d poetry: \u201ca poetry and a poetry of\npoetry\u201d (AF: #238). Goethe\u2019s Wilhelm Meister, a\nromantic favorite, manifests this dual reflective and substantive\nnature: \n\n\nIt was so much the poet\u2019s intentions to set up a comprehensive\ntheory of art or rather to represent one in living examples and\naspects.\u2026This might suggest that the novel is as much an\nhistorical philosophy of art as a true work of art, and that\neverything which the poet so lovingly presents as his true aim and end\nis ultimately only means. But that is not so: it is all poetry, high,\npure poetry. (F. Schlegel, WM: 274)\n\n\nThe transcendental nature of romantic poetry suggests that it does not\ntranscend merely the boundaries of a particular genre, but even the\nboundaries of the literary as such. Romantic Poetry is poetry as much\nas it is a philosophical method and a vital approach to human life. It\nis a creative and reflective human power, manifested in the\ntheoretical, practical and aesthetic aspects of life: \n\n\ntranscendental poetry\u2026really embraces all transcendental\nfunctions\u2026. The transcendental poet is the transcendental\nperson altogether. (Novalis, Logological Fragments: #41)\n\n\nRomantic poetry is not alone in exposing the conditions of finite\nexistence, but accompanied by an ironic way of living. Irony is a mode\nof self-restriction, whose \u201cvalue and dignity\u201d as\na crucial dimension of human life, must be recognized (F. Schlegel,\nCF: #28). Irony is the balance between \u201cself-creation and\nself-destruction\u201d (CF: #28), which means that irony is\ncreative\u2014it is constructive of its own perspective on the world.\nBut at the same time, it is also \u201cdestructive\u201d of the\npretensions implicit in any perspective\u2014the pretention to be\nholistic. Irony thus presents its perspective as restricted\u2014as\nonly one among many different perspectives on the unconditioned whole.\nAccordingly, what romantic irony insists on through its restricting\nfunction is (a) the conceptual inaccessibility of the\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d (explained in\n \u00a73),\n and (b) what is known as \u201cperspectivism\u201d\u2014the view\nthat human beings are capable only of finite and limited perspective\non the universe as a whole. Being ironic is a way of consciously and\nintentionally bringing out the fragmentary nature of the human\nsituation as lacking a \u201cview from nowhere\u201d.\n\nLike Romantic Poetry, irony is not merely a literary or even a\nrhetorical device. Nor is it a purely theoretical method. Rather, in a\nSocratic spirit, romantic irony is a way of life. For it is, \n\n\nafter all, for the artist as well as the man, the first and the last,\nthe most necessary and the highest duty\u2026most necessary because\nwherever one does not restrict oneself, one is restricted by the\nworld; and that makes one a slave. (CF: #37) \n\n\nEveryone, then, not only the writer, should be ironic. For, as\nexposing our finitude, irony is not only another romantic analogue of\nKant\u2019s transcendental method\u2014the antidote to\nreason\u2019s natural but spurious tendency to transcend its\nlimits\u2014but also an existential condition of humility (On irony\nsee also CF: #26, #42, #48, 108; AF: 51, 121; and On\nIncomprehensibility).\n\nThe romantic use of irony was sharply criticized, most famously by\nHegel, as free floating form of subjectivity. But not only does this\ncriticism fail to do justice to the romantic insistence that irony\nitself is a form of self-constraint, but also to the imperative:\n\u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate self-restriction\u201d (F. Schlegel,\nCF: #37). This demand to constrain and regulate self-restriction\nitself is of equal importance to the demand to practice irony. Rather\nthan a free floating form of subjectivity, then, romantic irony is a\nconstrained, and normatively governed form of life, meant to expose\nthe limits of reason and facilitate a life of humility (cf. Rush 2006:\n187). Romantic irony is a commitment to the form of life that is\ngoverned by the acknowledgement of finitude; a\n\u201ctranscendentally-Socratic\u201d life of humility.\n\nAccordingly, rather than an irrational or an anti-Enlightenment\nstance, romantic aesthetics is marked by a respect for and devotion to\nreason and rationality \u201cwithin their bounds\u201d.\n",
