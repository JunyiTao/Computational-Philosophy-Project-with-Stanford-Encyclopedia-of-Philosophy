    "main_text": "Account of the Mind || Principles of Association\n4.3 Principles of Association\n\nAlthough we are capable of separating and combining our simple ideas\nas we please, there is, nevertheless, a regular order to our thoughts.\nIf ideas occurred to us completely randomly, so that all our thoughts\nwere \u201cloose and unconnected\u201d, we wouldn\u2019t be able to\nthink coherently (T 1.1.4.1/10). This suggests that\n\nThere is a secret tie or union among particular ideas, which causes\nthe mind to conjoin them more frequently, and makes the one, upon its\nappearance, introduce the other. (Abstract 35)\n\n\nHume explains this \u201ctie or union\u201d in terms of the\nmind\u2019s natural ability to associate certain ideas.\nAssociation is not \u201can inseparable connexion\u201d, but rather\n\u201ca gentle force, which commonly prevails\u201d, by means of\nwhich one idea naturally introduces another (T 1.1.4.1/10).\n\nIn the first Enquiry, Hume says that even though it is\nobvious to everyone that our ideas are connected in this way, he is\nthe first philosopher who has \u201cattempted to enumerate or class\nall the principles of association\u201d (EHU 3.2/24). He regards his\nuse of these \u201cuniversal principles\u201d as so distinctive that\nhe advertises them as his most original contribution\u2014one that\nentitles him call himself an \u201cinventor\u201d (Abstract\n35).\n\nHume identifies three principles of association: resemblance,\ncontiguity in time and place, and causation. When someone\nshows you a picture of your best friend, you naturally think of her\nbecause the picture resembles her. When you\u2019re reminded\nof something that happened in the 1960s\u2014miniskirts, for\nexample\u2014you may think of the Vietnam War, because they are\ntemporally contiguous. Thinking of Sausalito may lead you to\nthink of the Golden Gate Bridge, which may lead you to think of San\nFrancisco, since they are spatially contiguous.\nCausality works both from cause to effect and effect to\ncause: meeting someone\u2019s father may make you think of his son;\nencountering the son may lead you to thoughts of his father.\n\nOf the three associative principles, causation is the\nstrongest, and the only one that takes us \u201cbeyond our\nsenses\u201d (T 1.3.2.3/74). It establishes links between our present\nand past experiences and our expectations about the future, so that\n\u201call reasonings concerning matters of fact seem to be founded on\nthe relation of Cause and Effect\u201d (EHU\n4.1.4/26). Taking aspirin in the past has relieved my headaches, so I\nexpect that the aspirin I just took will soon relieve my present\nheadache. Hume also makes clear that causation is the least understood\nof the associative principles, but he tells us, \u201cwe shall have\noccasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom\u201d (T\n1.1.4.2/11).\n\nLike gravitational attraction, the associative principles are\noriginal, and so can\u2019t be explained further. Although\nthe associative principles\u2019 \u201ceffects are everywhere\nconspicuous\u201d their causes \u201care mostly unknown, and must be\nresolv\u2019d into original qualities of human nature, which\nI pretend not to explain\u201d. Accordingly, we should curb any\n\u201cintemperate desire\u201d to account further for them, for\ndoing so would take us illegitimately beyond the bounds of experience\n(T 1.1.4.6/12\u201313).\n\nHume doesn\u2019t try to explain why we associate ideas as\nwe do. He is interested only in establishing that, as a matter of\nfact, we do associate ideas in these ways. Given that his\nclaim that the associative principles explain the important operations\nof the mind is an empirical one, he must admit, as he does in the\nfirst Enquiry, that he cannot prove conclusively that his\nlist of associative principles is complete. Perhaps he has overlooked\nsome additional principle. We are free to examine our own thoughts to\ndetermine whether resemblance, contiguity, and causation successfully\nexplain them. The more instances the associative principles explain,\nthe more assurance we have that Hume has identified the basic\nprinciples by which our minds work.\n\nIn the Abstract, Hume concludes that it should be \u201ceasy\nto conceive of what vast consequences these principles must be in the\nscience of human nature\u201d. Since they \u201care the only ties of\nour thoughts, they are really to us the cement of the\nuniverse, and all the operations of the mind must, in great measure,\ndepend on them\u201d (Abstract 35). Just what these \u201cvast\nconsequences\u201d are will become clear when we examine Hume\u2019s\nrevolutionary accounts of our causal inferences and moral\njudgments.\n",
