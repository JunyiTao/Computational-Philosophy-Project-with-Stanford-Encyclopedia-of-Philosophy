    "main_text": "Escaping the KS Argument || Contextuality\n6. The Question of Empirical Testing\n\n\nFamously, the violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities, prescribed by\nQM, has been confirmed experimentally. Is something similar possible\nfor the KS theorem? We should distinguish three questions: (1) Is it\npossible to realize the experiment proposed by KS as a motivation of\ntheir theorem?  (2) Is it possible to test the principles leading to\nthe theorem: the Sum Rule and Product Rule, FUNC, or NC? (3) Is it\npossible to test the theorem itself?\n\n\n(1) KS themselves describe a concrete experimental arrangement to\nmeasure Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 on a one-particle spin-1 system as\nfunctions of one maximal observable.  An orthohelium atom in the\nlowest triplet state is placed in a small electric field E of rhombic\nsymmetry. The three observables in question then can be measured as\nfunctions of one single observable, the perturbation Hamiltonian\nHs. Hs, by the geometry of E, has three\ndistinct possible values, measurement of which reveals which two\nof Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 have value 1 and which one has value\n0 (see Kochen and Specker 1967: 72/311). This is, of course, a\nproposal to realize an experiment exemplifying our above value\nconstraint (VC2). Could we also realize a (VC1) experiment,\ni.e. measure a set of commuting projectors projecting on eigenstates\nof one maximal observable? Peres (1995: 200) answers the question in\nthe affirmative, discusses such an experiment, and refers to Swift\nand Wright (1980) for details about the technical feasibility. Kochen\nand Specker\u2019s experimental proposal has, however, not been further\npursued, because it does not provide a direct test of NC. Obviously, a\nmeasurement of HS measures one orthogonal triple only. An\nHV proponent might well assume that the hidden state changes from one\nmeasurement of HS to the next (even if we prepare the same\nQM state again) and thus maintain NC. \n\n\n(2) In conjunction with manifestations of FUNC, i.e. the Sum Rule and\nthe Product Rule, QM yields constraints like VC1 or VC2 that\ncontradict VD. So, providing concrete physical examples that could,\ngiven the Sum Rule and the Product Rule, instantiate VC1 or VC2 as\njust outlined is not enough. We must ask whether these rules\nthemselves can be empirically supported. There was considerable\ndiscussion of this question in the early 80s \u2014 explicitly about\nwhether the Sum Rule is empirically testable \u2014 and there was\ngeneral agreement that it is\n not.[15]\n\n\nThe reason is the following. Recall that the derivation of FUNC\nestablished uniqueness of the new observable f(Q)\nonly in its final step (via NC). It is this uniqueness which\nguarantees that one operator represents exactly one observable so that\nobservables (and thereby their values) in different contexts can be\nequated. This allows one to establish indirect connections between\ndifferent incompatible observables. Without this final step, FUNC must\nbe viewed as holding relative to different contexts, the connection is\nbroken and FUNC is restricted to one set of observables which are all\nmutually compatible.  Then indeed FUNC, the Sum Rule and the Product\nRule become trivial, and empirical testing in these cases would be a\npointless \n question.[16]\n It is NC that does all the work and deserves to be tested via\nchecking whether for incompatible P, Q such that\nf(Q)=g(P) it is true that\nv(f(Q))=v(g(P)). However,\nthough QM and a noncontextual HV theory contradict each other for a\nsingle system, this contradiction involves incompatible observables\nand, thus, is untestable (as we have just seen from Kochen and\nSpecker\u2019s own proposal). Physicists have, however, made ingenious\nproposals for overcoming this obstacle. It is well-known that the\nconsideration of two-particle systems and products of spin components\nleads to very simple KS-type proofs (Mermin 1990b). Cabello and\nGarc\u00eca-Alcaine (1998) have shown that for such systems QM and a\nnoncontextual HV theory make different predictions for every single\ncase. Their reasoning makes no reference to locality considerations,\nbut as it requires two particles, such considerations might creep\nin. Simon et al. (2000), have mapped the\nCabello/Garc\u00eca-Alcaine scheme onto a combination of position and spin\nobservables for a single particle. Their experiment has been carried\nout and has confirmed the QM predictions (Huang et al. 2003; see also more recently Huang et al. 2013). All the\nmentioned authors consider their experimental proposals to be empirical\nrefutations of NC, but this has been doubted (Barrett and Kent 2004),\nfor reasons considered in the next paragraph.\n\n\n(3) The KS theorem, by its mathematical nature, is not empirically\ntestable. However, we could, along the lines of the previous\nparagraphs, try to measure a subset of a suitable KS-uncolourable\nset. Especially, it should be possible to produce cases along the\nlines of Clifton\u2019s example (3.5) where QM and a noncontextual HV\ntheory make measurably different predictions. It seems as if such\ncases could provide empirical tests of whether Nature is contextual\n(though not whether such contextuality is of the causal or ontological\ntype).(For a recent version of such an approach see Tang and Yu 2017.) \nFrom the 1980s on, it has been argued that such testing is\nimpossible. The KS theorem, it was claimed, leaves enough loopholes for\na HV theory at variance with QM, but able to reproduce the theory\u2019s\nempirical predictions. Pitowsky (1983, 1985) argued that it is\npossible to restrict attention to a subset of directions in\nR3 which are colourable. His argument, however, relies on a\nnon-standard version of probability theory that is regarded as\nphysically implausible. Meyer (1999) has exploited the\nmathematical fact that a set DM of directions in\nR3 approximating the KS-set arbitrarily closely, but\nwith rational coordinates is KS-colourable. Meyer argues that\nreal measurements have finite precision and thus can never distinguish\nbetween a direction in R3 and its approximation from\nDM. Kent (1999) has generalized the result for all Hilbert\nspaces, and Clifton and Kent (2000) have shown that also a set of\ndirections DCK such that every one direction is a member of\njust one orthogonal triple approximates any direction\narbitrarily closely. In DCK there are no interlocking\ntriples, the question of contextuality does not arise and\nDCK trivially is KS colourable. Clifton and Kent, in\naddition, have explicitly shown that DCK is large enough to\nallow probability distributions over value assignments arbitrarily\nclose to all QM distributions. Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) can be\nunderstood as thus arguing that even an empirical test of\nKS-uncolourable directions confirming the QM predictions cannot prove\nthe contextuality of Nature. Because of the test\u2019s finite precision it\nis impossible to disprove the contention that unwittingly we have\ntested close-by members of a KS-colourable set. One quite obvious\nobjection to this type of argument is that the original KS argument\nworks for possessed values, not measured values, so the MKC argument,\ndealing on finite precision of measurement, misses the mark. We might\nnot be able to test observables which are exactly orthogonal or\nexactly alike in different tests, but it would be a strange\nHV interpretation that asserts that such components do not exist (see\nCabello 1999 in Other Internet Resources). Of course, such a\nnoncontextual HV proposal would be immune to the KS argument, but it\nwould be forced to either assume that not for every one of the\ncontinuously many directions in physical space there is an observable,\nor else that there are not continuously many directions in physical\nspace. Neither assumption seems very attractive. \n\n\nIn addition, the MKC argument is dissatisfying even for measured\nvalues, since it exploits the finite precision of real measurements\nonly in one of the above senses, but presupposes infinite precision in\nthe other. MKC assume, for measured observables, that there is finite\nprecision in the choice of different orthogonal triples, such that we\ncannot, in general, have exactly the same observable twice, as a\nmember of two different triples. However, MKC still assume infinite\nprecision, i.e. exact orthogonality, within the triple (otherwise the\ncolouring constraints could find no application, at all). It has been\nclaimed that this feature can be exploited to rebut the argument and\nto re-install contextualism (see Mermin 1999 and Appleby 2000, both in\nOther Internet Resources, and Appleby 2005).\n\n\nFinally, it seems plausible to assume that probabilities vary\ncontinuously as we change directions in R3, so small imperfections of\nselection of observables that block the argument (but only for measured\nvalues!) in the single case will wash out in the long run (see Mermin\n1999, in Other Internet Resources). This in itself does not constitute\nan argument, since in the\ncolourable sets of observables in MKC\u2019s constructions\nprobabilities also vary (in a sense)\n continuously.[17]\n We might, however, exploit Mermin\u2019s reasoning in the following\nway. Reconsider Clifton\u2019s set of eight directions (in Figure 3)\nleading to a colouring constraint for the outermost points which\nstatistically contradicts the QM statistics by a fraction of\n1/17. Using Clifton and Kent\u2019s colourable set of directions\nDCK we are unable to derive the constraint for the eight\npoints, since these eight points do not lie in DCK; namely,\nas we move, in the colourable subset, from one mutually orthogonal\ntriple of rays to the next, we never hit upon exactly the same ray\nagain, but only on one approximating it arbitrarily closely.  Assume a\nset S of systems wherein observables, corresponding to members of\nDCK and approximating the eight directions in Fig. 3\narbitrarily closely, all have values \u2014 in accordance with the HV\npremise. Then we can derive Clifton\u2019s constraint for the\noutermost points in the following sense. Consider the subset\nS\u2032 \u2282 S of systems where any direction\napproximating point (1, 1, 1) gets value 1 (or colour white). In order\nto meet the predictions of QM, in S\u2032 all directions\napproximating (1, 0, \u22121) and (1, \u22121, 0) must receive values such that\nthe probability of value 0 (or colour black) is extremely close to\n1. Analogously, in another subset S\u2033 \u2282 S\nof systems with directions approximating (\u22121, 1, 1) as having value 1\n(colour white) all directions approximating (1, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0)\nmust receive values such that the probability of value 0 (colour\nblack) is extremely close to 1. Consider now members of\nS\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033. In any of them there will\nbe, for any approximation to (1, 0, \u22121) with value 0 (colour black),\nan exactly orthogonal point that approximates (1, 0, 1) and also has\nvalue 0 (colour black) such that there is a third orthogonal point\napproximating (0, 1, 0) and having value 1 (colour white). Likewise\nfor (0, 0, 1). But (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1) are orthogonal, and for all\nmembers of S\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033 the directions\napproximating them both have value 1 (colour white), while QM\npredicts that the probability for values 1 for the\napproximated directions values is 0. In order to ensure that\nthis prediction is met, S\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033 must\nbe an extremely small subset of S, which is to say that the\nprobability for both (1, 1, 1) and (\u22121, 1, 1) (the leftmost and\nrightmost points in fig. 3) must be close to 0 and approximate 0\nbetter and better as S grows. QM, on the contrary, predicts a\nprobability of 1/17. (Recall also that this number can be pushed up to\n1/3 by choosing a set of 13 directions!)\n\n\nCabello (2002), using a very similar reasoning, has shown that the MKC\nmodels lead to predictions that testably differ from the ones of\nQM. For DCK, he effectively uses the strategy sketched\nabove: QM gives probabilities for directions in the Clifton-Kent set\nwhich their model must match in order to reproduce QM predictions. As\nthese directions are arbitrarily close to directions from a\nKS-uncolourable set (or directions leading to Clifton\u2019s constraint),\nthis leads to restrictions for these nearby points that are measurably\nviolated by the QM predictions. For Meyer\u2019s DM Cabello\u2019s\ncase is even stronger. He explicitly presents a set of nine\nrational vectors leading to predictions different from QM\n(for three of these directions). Hence, the Meyer argument is\neffectively rebutted (without recourse to Mermin\u2019s requirement): Even\nif there were only observables corresponding to the rational\ndirections in R3 (which in itself is an implausible assumption) a\ntheory assuming that they all have noncontextual values faithfully\nrevealed by measurement will be measurably at variance with QM. Assume\nnow that the Cabello directions were tested and the QM predictions\nreliably confirmed, then this would (modulo the reliability of the\ntests) constitute a proof that Nature is contextual. \n\n\nSo, in sum it seems that, as long as we assume that there are\ncontinuously many QM observables (corresponding to the continuum of\ndirections in physical space), statistical tests building, e.g., on\nthe Clifton 1993 or the Cabello/Garc\u00eca-Alcaine 1998 proposal\nremain entirely valid as empirical confirmations of QM and, via the KS\ntheorem, of contextuality. Since these statistical violations of the\nHV programme come about as contradictions of results of QM, VD, VR,\nand NC on the one hand, and QM and experiment on the other, the\nexperimental data still force upon us the trilemma of giving up either\nVD or VR or NC. As we have seen, denial of value realism in the end\nbecomes identical to a kind of contextualism, hence we really have\nonly two options: (1) Giving up VD, either for all observables\nforbidden to have values in the orthodox interpretation (thus giving\nup the HV programme, as defined above), or for a subset of these\nobservables (as modal interpretations do). (2) Endorse a kind of\ncontextualism. Moreover, as things presently stand, the choice between\nthese two options seems not to be a matter of empirical testing, but\none of pure philosophical argument.\n",
