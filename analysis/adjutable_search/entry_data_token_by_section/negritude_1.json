    "main_text": "N\u00e9gritude as revolt / N\u00e9gritude as philosophy\n2. N\u00e9gritude as revolt / N\u00e9gritude as philosophy\n\nConventionally, the founding moment of the Negritude movement was the\ncreation, in 1934\u20131935, of the journal L\u2019Etudiant\nnoir (The Black Student), to take the place of another\nperiodical, L\u2019Etudiant martiniquais (The Martiniquan\nStudent), a move from the consideration of a regional origin to the\naffirmation of the call made by Jane Nardal for a \u201cblack\ninternationalism\u201d. That is when Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\ncoined for that conscience of a global blackness the concept of\n\u201cnegritude\u201d. It was meant to be aggressive, provocative,\ndisturbing, as it turned around, reclaimed, and appropriated the\nFrench word \u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d which, from its etymological\nmeaning as \u201cblack\u201d, had become a racist slur. The\nphilosophers of Negritude have often said that they too were sensitive\nto the provocative nature of the word. But they were also conscious of\nthe force of a concept constructed to be an irritant about which\nC\u00e9saire has declared at the beginning of a lecture he gave on\nFebruary 26, 1987, at the International University of Florida in\nMiami: \u201c\u2026I confess that I do not always like the word\nN\u00e9gritude even if I am the one, with the complicity of a few\nothers, who contributed to its invention and its launching\u201d\nadding that, still, \u201cit corresponds to an evident reality and,\nin any case to a need that appears to be a deep one\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire 2004, 80). \u201cWhat is that reality?\u201d\nC\u00e9saire proceeded then asking. Indeed, that is the question: is\nthere a content and a substance of the concept of N\u00e9gritude\nbeyond the revolt and the proclamation? In other words, is\nN\u00e9gritude mainly a posture of revolt against oppression the\nmanifestation of which is primarily the poetry it has produced, or\ndoes it have the substantial significance of a philosophy that gives\ndifferent expressions to an African presence, to a distinctive black\nway of being-in-the-world? The answer oscillates between the two\nterms of the alternative. Negritude as both a resounding poetic scream\nand the philosophical project to retrieve and explore an identity\nfound the most eloquent expression in an address Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire gave in Geneva on June 2nd 1978 on the\noccasion of the creation by Robert Cornman of a cantata entitled\nRetour and inspired by the Notebooks of a Return to the\nNative Land. In that address reproduced in Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire, pour regarder le si\u00e8cle en face, the poet\nfrom Martinique declares:\n\n\u2026 when it appeared the literature of N\u00e9gritude created a\nrevolution: in the darkness of the great silence, a voice was raising\nup, with no interpreter, no alteration, and no complacency, a violent\nand staccato voice, and it said for the first time: \u201cI,\nN\u00e8gre.\u201d\n\nA voice of revolt\n\nA voice of resentment\n\nNo doubt\n\nBut also of fidelity, a voice of freedom, and first and foremost, a\nvoice for the retrieved identity. (Th\u00e9bia-Melsan 2000, 28)\n\n\nIn fact both answers have been given to that question of posture of\nrevolt vs. philosophical substance, at different moments and in\ndifferent circumstances by N\u00e9gritude writers. Nevertheless, it\ncan be said that C\u00e9saire and Damas have put more emphasis on\nthe dimension of poetic revolt while Senghor has insisted more on\narticulating N\u00e9gritude as a philosophical content, as\n\u201cthe sum total of the values of civilization of the Black\nWorld\u201d, thus implying that it is an ontology, an aesthetics, an\nepistemology, or a politics.\n",
