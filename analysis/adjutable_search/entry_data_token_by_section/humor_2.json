    "main_text": "The Relief Theory\n3. The Relief Theory\n\nFurther weakening the dominance of the Superiority Theory in the\n18th century were two new accounts of laughter which are\nnow called the Relief Theory and the Incongruity Theory. Neither even\nmentions feelings of superiority.\n\nThe Relief Theory is an hydraulic explanation in which laughter does\nin the nervous system what a pressure-relief valve does in a steam\nboiler. The theory was sketched in Lord Shaftesbury\u2019s 1709 essay\n\u201cAn Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humor,\u201d the first\npublication in which humor is used in its modern sense of\nfunniness. Scientists at the time knew that nerves connect the brain\nwith the sense organs and muscles, but they thought that nerves\ncarried \u201canimal spirits\u201d\u2014gases and liquids such as\nair and blood. John Locke (1690, Book 3, ch. 9, para.16), for\ninstance, describes animal spirits as \u201cfluid and subtile Matter,\npassing through the Conduits of the Nerves.\u201d \n\nShaftesbury\u2019s explanation of laughter is that it releases animal\nspirits that have built up pressure inside the nerves. \n\n\nThe natural free spirits of ingenious men, if imprisoned or\ncontrolled, will find out other ways of motion to relieve themselves\nin their constraint; and whether it be in burlesque, mimicry, or\nbuffoonery, they will be glad at any rate to vent themselves, and be\nrevenged upon their constrainers.\n\n\nOver the next two centuries, as the nervous system came to be better\nunderstood, thinkers such as Herbert Spencer and Sigmund Freud revised\nthe biology behind the Relief Theory but kept the idea that laughter\nrelieves pent-up nervous energy. \n\nSpencer\u2019s explanation in his essay \u201cOn the Physiology of\nLaughter\u201d (1911) is based on the idea that emotions take the\nphysical form of nervous energy. Nervous energy, he says,\n\u201calways tends to beget muscular motion, and when it rises to a\ncertain intensity, always does beget it\u201d (299). \u201cFeeling\npassing a certain pitch habitually vents itself in bodily\naction\u201d (302). When we are angry, for example, nervous energy\nproduces small aggressive movements such as clenching our fists; and\nif the energy reaches a certain level, we attack the offending person.\nIn fear, the energy produces small-scale movements in preparation for\nfleeing; and if the fear gets strong enough, we flee. The movements\nassociated with emotions, then, discharge or release the built-up\nnervous energy. \n\nLaughter releases nervous energy, too, Spencer says, but with this\nimportant difference: the muscular movements in laughter are not the\nearly stages of larger practical actions such as attacking or fleeing.\nUnlike emotions, laughter does not involve the motivation to do\nanything. The movements of laughter, Spencer says, \u201chave no\nobject\u201d (303): they are merely a release of nervous\nenergy. \n\nThe nervous energy relieved through laughter, according to Spencer, is\nthe energy of emotions that have been found to be inappropriate.\nConsider this poem entitled \u201cWaste\u201d by Harry Graham\n(2009):\n\n\nI had written to Aunt Maud\n\nWho was on a trip abroad\n\nWhen I heard she\u2019d died of cramp,\n\nJust too late to save the stamp.\n\n\nReading the first three lines, we might feel pity for the bereaved\nnephew writing the poem. But the last line makes us reinterpret those\nlines. Far from being a loving nephew in mourning, he turns out to be\nan insensitive cheapskate. So the nervous energy of our pity, now\nsuperfluous, is released in laughter. That discharge occurs, Spencer\nsays, first through the muscles \u201cwhich feeling most habitually\nstimulates,\u201d the muscles of the vocal tract. If still more\nenergy needs to be relieved, it spills over to the muscles connected\nwith breathing, and if the movements of those muscles do not release\nall the energy, the remainder moves the arms, legs, and other muscle\ngroups (304). \n\nIn the 20th century, John Dewey (1894: 558\u2013559) had a\nsimilar version of the Relief Theory. Laughter, he said, \u201cmarks\nthe ending \u2026 of a period of suspense, or expectation.\u201d It\nis a \u201csudden relaxation of strain, so far as occurring through\nthe medium of the breathing and vocal apparatus\u2026 The laugh is\nthus a phenomenon of the same general kind as the sigh of\nrelief.\u201d \n\nBetter known than the versions of the Relief Theory of Shaftesbury,\nSpencer, and Dewey is that of Sigmund Freud. In his Jokes and\nTheir Relation to the Unconscious (1905 [1974]), Freud analyzes\nthree laughter situations: der Witz (often translated\n\u201cjokes\u201d or \u201cjoking\u201d), \u201cthe comic,\u201d\nand \u201chumor.\u201d In all three, laughter releases nervous\nenergy that was summoned for a psychological task, but then became\nsuperfluous as that task was abandoned. In der Witz, that\nsuperfluous energy is energy used to repress feelings; in the comic it\nis energy used to think, and in humor it is the energy of feeling\nemotions. (In this article, we are not using humor in\nFreud\u2019s narrow sense, but in the general sense that includes\njoking, wit, the comic, etc.)\n\nDer Witz includes telling prepared fictional jokes, making\nspontaneous witty comments, and repartee. In der Witz, Freud\nsays, the psychic energy released is the energy that would have\nrepressed the emotions that are being expressed as the person laughs.\n(Most summaries of Freud\u2019s theory of joking mistakenly describe laughter as a release of repressed emotions themselves.) According to Freud,\nthe emotions which are most repressed are sexual desire and hostility,\nand so most jokes and witty remarks are about sex, hostility, or both.\nIn telling a sexual joke or listening to one, we bypass our internal\ncensor and give vent to our libido. In telling or listening to a joke\nthat puts down an individual or group we dislike, similarly, we let\nout the hostility we usually repress. In both cases, the psychic\nenergy normally used to do the repressing becomes superfluous, and is\nreleased in laughter. \n\nFreud\u2019s second laughter situation, \u201cthe comic,\u201d\ninvolves a similar release of energy that is summoned but is then\nfound unnecessary. Here it is the energy normally devoted to thinking.\nAn example is laughter at the clumsy actions of a clown. As we watch\nthe clown stumble through actions that we would perform smoothly and\nefficiently, there is a saving of the energy that we would normally\nexpend to understand the clown\u2019s movements. Here Freud appeals\nto a theory of \u201cmimetic representation\u201d in which we expend\na large packet of energy to understand something large and a small\npacket of energy to understand something small. Our mental\nrepresentation of the clown\u2019s clumsy movements, Freud says,\ncalls for more energy than the energy we would expend to mentally\nrepresent our own smooth, efficient movements in performing the same\ntask. Our laughter at the clown is our venting of that surplus\nenergy.\n\n\nThese two possibilities in my imagination amount to a comparison\nbetween the observed movement and my own. If the other person\u2019s\nmovement is exaggerated and inexpedient, my increased expenditure in\norder to understand it is inhibited in statu nascendi, as it\nwere in the act of being mobilized; it is declared superfluous and is\nfree for use elsewhere or perhaps for discharge by laughter (Freud\n1905 [1974], 254). \n\n\nFreud analyzes the third laughter situation, which he calls\n\u201chumor,\u201d much as Spencer analyzed laughter in general.\nHumor occurs \u201cif there is a situation in which, according to our\nusual habits, we should be tempted to release a distressing affect and\nif motives then operate upon us which suppress that affect in\nstatu nascendi [in the process of being born]\u2026 . The\npleasure of humor \u2026 comes about \u2026 at the cost of a\nrelease of affect that does not occur: it arise from an economy in\nthe expenditure of affect\u201d (293). His example is a story\ntold by Mark Twain in which his brother was building a road when a\ncharge of dynamite went off prematurely, blowing him high into the\nsky. When the poor man came down far from the work site, he was docked\nhalf a day\u2019s pay for being \u201cabsent from his place of\nemployment.\u201d Freud\u2019s explanation of our laughter at this\nstory is like the explanation above at Graham\u2019s poem about the\ncheapskate nephew. In laughing at this story, he says, we are\nreleasing the psychic energy that we had summoned to feel pity for\nTwain\u2019s brother, but that became superfluous when we heard the\nfantastic last part. \u201cAs a result of this understanding, the\nexpenditure on the pity, which was already prepared, becomes\nunutilizable and we laugh it off\u201d (295).\n\nHaving sketched several versions of the Relief Theory, we can note\nthat today almost no scholar in philosophy or psychology explains\nlaughter or humor as a process of releasing pent-up nervous energy.\nThere is, of course, a connection between laughter and the expenditure\nof energy. Hearty laughter involves many muscle groups and several\nareas of the nervous system. Laughing hard gives our lungs a workout,\ntoo, as we take in far more oxygen than usual. But few contemporary\nscholars defend the claims of Spencer and Freud that the energy\nexpended in laughter is the energy of feeling emotions, the energy of\nrepressing emotions, or the energy of thinking, which have built up\nand require venting. \n\nFunny things and situations may evoke emotions, but many seem not to.\nConsider P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s line \u201cIf it\u2019s feasible,\nlet\u2019s fease it.\u201d Or the shortest poem in the English\nlanguage, by Strickland Gillilan (1927), \u201cLines on the Antiquity\nof Microbes\u201d:\n\n\nAdam\n\nHad\u2019em.\n\n\nThese do not seem to vent emotions that had built up before we read\nthem, and they do not seem to summon emotions and then render them\nsuperfluous. So whatever energy is expended in laughing at them does\nnot seem to be superfluous energy being vented. In fact, the whole\nhydraulic model of the nervous system on which the Relief Theory is\nbased seems outdated.\n\nTo that hydraulic model, Freud adds several questionable claims\nderived from his general psychoanalytic theory of the mind. He says\nthat the creation of der Witz\u2014jokes and witty\ncomments\u2014is an unconscious process of letting repressed thoughts\nand feelings into the conscious mind. This claim seems falsified by\nprofessional humorists who approach the creation of jokes and cartoons\nwith conscious strategies. Freud\u2019s account of how psychic energy\nis vented in joke-telling is also questionable, especially his claim\nthat packets of psychic energy are summoned to repress thoughts and\nfeelings, but in statu nascendi (in the process of being\nborn) are rendered superfluous. If Freud is right that the energy\nreleased in laughing at a joke is the energy normally used to repress\nhostile and sexual feelings, then it seems that those who laugh\nhardest at aggressive and sexual jokes should be people who usually\nrepress such feelings. But studies about joke preferences by Hans\nJ\u00fcrgen Eysenck (1972, xvi) have shown that the people who enjoy\naggressive and sexual humor the most are not those who usually repress\nhostile and sexual feelings, but those who express them.\n\nFreud\u2019s account of \u201cthe comic\u201d faces still more\nproblems, particularly his ideas about \u201cmimetic\nrepresentation.\u201d The psychic energy saved, he says, is energy\nsummoned for understanding something, such as the antics of a clown.\nWe summon a large packet of energy to understand the clown\u2019s\nlarge movements, but as we are summoning it, we compare it with the\nsmall packet of energy required to understand our own smaller\nmovements in doing the same thing. The difference between the two\npackets is surplus energy discharged in laughter. Freud\u2019s\naccount of thinking here is idiosyncratic and has strange\nimplications, such as that thinking about swimming the English Channel\ntakes far more energy than thinking about licking a stamp. With all\nthese difficulties, it is not surprising that philosophers and\npsychologists studying humor today do not appeal to Freud\u2019s\ntheory to explain laughter or humor. More generally, the Relief Theory\nis seldom used as a general explanation of laughter or humor.\n",
