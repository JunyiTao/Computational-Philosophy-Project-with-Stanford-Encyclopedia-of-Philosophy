    "main_text": "\n\n\nOften, when there is a reason for you to do something, it is the kind\nof thing to motivate you to do it. For example, if Max and Caroline\nare deciding whether to go to the Alcove for dinner, Caroline might\nmention as a reason in favor, the fact that the Alcove serves onion\nrings the size of doughnuts, and Max might mention as a reason\nagainst, the fact that it is so difficult to get parking there this\ntime of day. It is some sign\u2014perhaps not a perfect sign, but\nsome sign\u2014that each of these really is a reason, that\nMax and Caroline feel the tug in each direction. Mention of the\nAlcove\u2019s onion rings makes them feel to at least some degree\ninclined to go, and mention of the parking arrangements makes them\nfeel to at least some degree inclined not to. According to some\nphilosophers, reasons for action always bear some relation\nlike this to motivation. This idea is variously known as\n\u2018reasons internalism\u2019, \u2018internalism about\nreasons\u2019, or \u2018the internal reasons theory\u2019.\nAccording to other philosophers, not all reasons are related to\nmotivation in any of the ways internalists say. This idea is known as\n\u2018reasons externalism\u2019 or \u2018externalism about\nreasons\u2019.\n",
