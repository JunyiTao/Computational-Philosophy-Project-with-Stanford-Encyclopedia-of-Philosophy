    "main_text": "Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations || The Book of Substances\n5.2 The Book of Substances\n\nThe Book of Substances (Arabic: Kitab al-Jawahir) is\nextant only in fragments of Judeo-Arabic (that is, Arabic written in\nHebrew letters) in the Firkovitch Collection in St. Petersburg and in\nthe British Museum. Stern established that both manuscripts were\nseparately transliterated from an original text in Arabic\ncharacters\u2014which is deducible from transcription errors arising\nfrom Arabic rather than Hebrew orthographic similarities, and that the\ntranscription and transliteration errors in the two manuscripts do not\nmatch (Stern, \u201cThe Fragments of \u2018The Book of\nSubstances\u2019\u201d, pp.16\u201317). Stern pieced together the\nfragments, adding some missing materials from a passage in \u201cIbn\nHasday\u2019s Neoplatonist\u201d and published them in the\nJournal of Jewish Studies, vii (1956), 13\u201329. The\nextant fragments largely paraphrase and add commentary to passages\nfrom the pseudo-Aristotelian \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist.\u201d Due to the close textual proximities between the\ntwo texts, Stern conjectured that in places where Israeli is quoting\n\u201cthe philosopher\u201d he is likely quoting a lost passage of\nthe Neoplatonist. These parallels allowed Stern to arrange the\ndiscontinuous fragments into an order mirroring its source treatise.\nAltmann and Stern subsequently published a translation of the\nfragments in Isaac Israeli, pp. 81\u2013105.\n",
