    "main_text": "Epistemology || The main types of knowledge\n3.1 The main types of knowledge\n\nIt is now clear that Jaina philosophy is essentially directed at the\nindividual effort of distinguishing the self and non-self stuff, until\none reaches liberation. Besides, the self is traditionally defined as\nexperience of consciousness, which consists in cognition\n(j\u00f1\u0101na) and indeterminate perception\n(dar\u015bana). This will bring epistemological\nconsiderations at the core of Jaina philosophical investigations.\nFirst, there are many classifications of the different types of\nknowledge recognized by Jaina philosophers. The Treatise of What\nThere Is attempts at collecting and organizing the types of\nknowledge mentioned in earlier literature into four types of\nindeterminate perception, whose study is not developed; and eight\ntypes of cognition, namely ordinary cognition of the senses,\ntestimonial cognition, mental cognition, cosmic cognition, absolute\ncognition, and their faulty counterparts, namely wrong ordinary\ncognition of the senses, wrong testimonial cognition and wrong mental\ncognition (Shastri 1990; Balcerowicz 2017; den Boer 2020).\n\nA few remarks are in order. First, the distinction between cognition\nand indeterminate perception is inherited from older canonical sources\nand is discarded by most epistemologists after the seminal work of\nSiddhasena Mah\u0101mati (710\u2013780 CE), who indicates in his\nGuide of Logic (Ny\u0101y\u0101vat\u0101ra [NA])\nthat indeterminate perception collapses with cognition when perceptual\nexperience already retains some details. However, it gave the\nopportunity for Jaina philosophers to assimilate a distinction that\nwas especially important for Buddhist philosophers between conceptual\nand non-conceptual cognition.\n\nSecond, Jaina philosophers were influenced by the Ny\u0101ya\nclassification, which was the cornerstone of all the South Asian\nepistemological edifice, and that recognizes five means of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception, inference, testimony\nand analogy. Jainas assimilated this model by admitting these means of\nknowledge either as subtypes of ordinary cognition, or as testimonial\ncognition.\n\nThird, whatever enters our cognitive apparatus is a result of a\ncontact with what exists. The senses, which include the mind, are an\nintermediary between our self and the object of knowledge, but the\nself can also know the object of knowledge directly. Mental, cosmic\nand absolute cognitions are such direct types of knowledge, while\nordinary cognition and testimonial cognition are mediated ones. For\nJainas, direct knowledge of the soul is called\n\u201cpratyak\u1e63a\u201d (directly present to the soul);\nwhile in other systems, \u201cpratyak\u1e63a\u201d\n(present before the eyes) is what stands for everyday life perception,\ntherefore mediated by the organs of senses. This leads to competitive\nclassifications by Jaina authors in their attempts at being understood\nby their non-Jaina interlocutors (Clavel 2015).\n\nFourth, the material cause of cognitive error is wrong perception\n(mithy\u0101dar\u015bana), which is due to knowledge\nobstructing karma. Therefore, error can only affect types of cognition\nof selves who are still entangled with this type of karma. Conversely,\nerror cannot affect cosmic and absolute cognition, which can be\nexperienced only when all one\u2019s knowledge obscuring karma has\nbeen removed.\n",
