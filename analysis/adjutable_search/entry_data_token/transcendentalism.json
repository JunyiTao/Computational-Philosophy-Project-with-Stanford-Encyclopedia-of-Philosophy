Stimulated by English and German Romanticism, the Biblical\ncriticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, and the skepticism of Hume,\nthe transcendentalists operated with the sense that a new era was at\nhand.

Emerson and Thoreau sought this relation in\nsolitude amidst nature, and in their writing.

Origins and Character\n\nWhat we now know as transcendentalism first arose among the liberal\nNew England Congregationalists, who departed from orthodox Calvinism\nin two respects: they believed in the importance and efficacy of human\nstriving, as opposed to the bleaker Puritan picture of complete and\ninescapable human depravity; and they emphasized the unity rather than\nthe \u201cTrinity\u201d of God (hence the term\n\u201cUnitarian,\u201d originally a term of abuse that they came to\nadopt.) Most of the Unitarians held that Jesus was in some way\ninferior to God the Father but still greater than human beings; a few\nfollowed the English Unitarian Joseph Priestley (1733\u20131804) in\nholding that Jesus was thoroughly human, although endowed with special\nauthority. The Unitarians\u2019 leading preacher, William Ellery\nChanning (1780\u20131842), portrayed orthodox Congregationalism as a\nreligion of fear, and maintained that Jesus saved human beings from\nsin, not just from punishment. His sermon \u201cUnitarian\nChristianity\u201d (1819) denounced \u201cthe conspiracy of ages\nagainst the liberty of Christians\u201d (P, 336) and helped give the\nUnitarian movement its name. In \u201cLikeness to God\u201d (1828)\nhe proposed that human beings \u201cpartake\u201d of Divinity and\nthat they may achieve \u201ca growing likeness to the Supreme\nBeing\u201d (T, 4).\n\nThe Unitarians were \u201cmodern.\u201d They attempted to reconcile\nLocke\u2019s empiricism with Christianity by maintaining that the\naccounts of miracles in the Bible provide overwhelming evidence for\nthe truth of religion. It was precisely on this ground, however, that\nthe transcendentalists found fault with Unitarianism. For although\nthey admired Channing\u2019s idea that human beings can become more\nlike God, they were persuaded by Hume that no empirical proof of\nreligion could be satisfactory. In letters written in his freshman\nyear at Harvard (1817), Emerson tried out Hume\u2019s skeptical\narguments on his devout and respected Aunt Mary Moody Emerson, and in\nhis journals of the early 1820s he discusses with approval\nHume\u2019s Dialogues on Natural Religion and his underlying\ncritique of necessary connection. \u201cWe have no experience of a\nCreator,\u201d Emerson writes, and therefore we \u201cknow of\nnone\u201d (JMN 2, 161).\n\nSkepticism about religion was also engendered by the publication of an\nEnglish translation of F. D. E. Schleiermacher\u2019s Critical\nEssay Upon the Gospel of St. Luke (1825), which introduced the\nidea that the Bible was a product of human history and culture.\nEqually important was the publication in 1833\u2014some fifty years\nafter its initial appearance in Germany\u2014of James Marsh\u2019s\ntranslation of Johann Gottfried von Herder\u2019s Spirit of\nHebrew Poetry (1782). Herder blurred the lines between religious\ntexts and humanly-produced poetry, casting doubt on the authority of\nthe Bible, but also suggesting that texts with equal authority could\nstill be written. It was against this background that Emerson asked in\n1836, in the first paragraph of Nature: \u201cWhy should we\nnot have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and\na religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs\u201d\n(O, 5). The individual\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d\u2014or\n\u201cintuition,\u201d as Emerson was later to speak of it\u2014was\nto be the counter both to Unitarian empiricism and Humean\nskepticism.\n\nAn important source for the transcendentalists\u2019 knowledge of\nGerman philosophy was Frederic Henry Hedge (1805\u201390).\nHedge\u2019s father Levi Hedge, a Harvard professor of logic, sent\nhim to preparatory school in Germany at the age of thirteen, after\nwhich he attended the Harvard Divinity School. Ordained as a Unitarian\nminister, Hedge wrote a long review of the work of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge for the Christian Examiner in 1833. Noting\nColeridge\u2019s fondness for \u201cGerman metaphysics\u201d and\nhis immense gifts of erudition and expression, he laments that\nColeridge had not made Kant and the post-Kantians more accessible to\nan English-speaking audience. This is the task\u2014to introduce the\n\u201ctranscendental philosophy\u201d of Kant, (T, 87)\u2014that\nHedge takes up. In particular, he explains Kant\u2019s idea of a\nCopernican Revolution in philosophy: \u201c[S]ince the supposition\nthat our intuitions depend on the nature of the world without, will\nnot answer, assume that the world without depends on the nature of our\nintuitions.\u201d This \u201ckey to the whole critical\nphilosophy,\u201d Hedge continues, explains the possibility of\n\u201ca priori knowledge\u201d (T, 92). Hedge organized what\neventually became known as the Transcendental Club, by suggesting to\nEmerson in 1836 that they form a discussion group for disaffected\nyoung Unitarian clergy. The group included George Ripley and Bronson\nAlcott, had some 30 meetings in four years, and was a sponsor of\nThe Dial and Brook Farm. Hedge was a vocal opponent of\nslavery in the 1830s and a champion of women\u2019s rights in the\n1850s, but he remained a Unitarian minister, and became a professor at\nthe Harvard Divinity School.\n\nAnother source for the transcendentalists\u2019 knowledge of German\nphilosophy was Germaine de Sta\u00ebl (Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker)\n(1766\u20131817), whose De l\u2019Allemagne (On\nGermany) was a favorite of the young Emerson. In a sweeping\nsurvey of European metaphysics and political philosophy, de Sta\u00ebl\npraises Locke\u2019s devotion to liberty, but sees him as the\noriginator of a sensationalist school of epistemology that leads to\nthe skepticism of Hume. She finds an attractive contrast in the German\ntradition that begins with Leibniz and culminates in Kant, which\nasserts the power and authority of the mind.\n\nJames Marsh (1794\u20131842), a graduate of Andover and the president\nof the University of Vermont, was equally important for the emerging\nphilosophy of transcendentalism. Marsh was convinced that German\nphilosophy held the key to a reformed theology. His American edition\nof Coleridge\u2019s Aids to Reflection (1829) introduced\nColeridge\u2019s version\u2014much indebted to Schelling\u2014of\nKantian terminology, terminology that runs throughout Emerson\u2019s\nearly work. In Nature, for example, Emerson writes:\n\u201cThe Imagination may be defined to be, the use which the Reason\nmakes of the material world\u201d (O, 25).\n\nGerman philosophy and literature was also championed by Thomas\nCarlyle, whom Emerson met on his first trip to Europe in 1831.\nCarlyle\u2019s philosophy of action in such works as Sartor\nResartus resonates with Emerson\u2019s idea in \u201cThe\nAmerican Scholar\u201d that action\u2014along with nature and\n\u201cthe mind of the Past\u201d (O, 39) is essential to human\neducation. Along with his countrymen Coleridge and Wordsworth, Carlyle\nembraced a \u201cnatural supernaturalism,\u201d the view that\nnature, including human beings, has the power and authority\ntraditionally attributed to an independent deity.\n\nPiety towards nature was also a main theme of William Wordsworth,\nwhose poetry was in vogue in America in the 1820s. Wordsworth\u2019s\ndepiction of an active and powerful mind cohered with the shaping\npower of the mind that his collaborator in the Lyrical\nBallads, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, traced to Kant. The idea of\nsuch power pervades Emerson\u2019s Nature, where he writes\nof nature as \u201cobedient\u201d to spirit and counsels each of us\nto \u201cBuild \u2026 your own world.\u201d Wordsworth has his\nmore receptive mode as well, in which he calls for \u201ca heart that\nwatches and receives\u201d (in \u201cThe Tables Turned\u201d), and\nwe find Emerson\u2019s receptive mode from Nature onward, as\nwhen he recounts an ecstatic experience in the woods: \u201cI become\na transparent eyeball. I am nothing; I see all; The currents of the\nuniversal being circulate through me.\u201d (O, 6).\n\nEmerson\u2019s sense that men and women are, as he put it in\nNature, gods \u201cin ruins,\u201d led to one of\ntranscendentalism\u2019s defining events, his delivery of an address\nat the Harvard Divinity School graduation in 1838. Emerson portrayed\nthe contemporary church that the graduates were about to lead as an\n\u201ceastern monarchy of a Christianity\u201d that had become an\n\u201cinjuror of man\u201d (O, 58). Jesus, in contrast, was a\n\u201cfriend of man.\u201d Yet he was just one of the \u201ctrue\nrace of prophets,\u201d whose message is not so much their own\ngreatness, as the \u201cgreatness of man\u201d (O, 57). Emerson\nrejects the Unitarian argument that miracles prove the truth of\nChristianity, not simply because the evidence is weak, but because\nproof of the sort they envision embodies a mistaken view of the nature\nof religion: \u201cconversion by miracles is a profanation of the\nsoul.\u201d Emerson\u2019s religion is based not on testimony but on\na \u201cperception\u201d that produces a \u201creligious\nsentiment\u201d (O, 55).\n\nThe \u201cDivinity School Address\u201d drew a quick and angry\nresponse from Andrews Norton (1786\u20131853) of the Harvard Divinity\nSchool, often known as the \u201cUnitarian Pope.\u201d In \u201cThe\nNew School in Literature and Religion\u201d (1838), Norton complains\nof \u201ca restless craving for notoriety and excitement,\u201d\nwhich he traces to German \u201cspeculatists\u201d and\n\u201cbarbarians\u201d and \u201cthat hyper-Germanized Englishman,\nCarlyle.\u201d Emerson\u2019s \u201cAddress,\u201d he concludes,\nis at once \u201can insult to religion\u201d (T, 248) and \u201can\nincoherent rhapsody\u201d (T, 249).\n\nAn earlier transcendentalist scandal surrounded the publication of\nAmos Bronson Alcott\u2019s Conversations with Children Upon the\nGospels (1836). Alcott (1799\u20131888) was a self-taught\neducator from Connecticut who established a series of schools that\naimed to \u201cdraw out\u201d the intuitive knowledge of children.\nHe found anticipations of his views about a priori knowledge in the\nwritings of Plato and Kant, and support in Coleridge\u2019s Aids\nto Reflection for the idea that idealism and materiality could be\nreconciled. Alcott replaced the hard benches of the common schools\nwith more comfortable furniture that he built himself, and left a\ncentral space in his classrooms for dancing. The Conversations\nwith Children Upon the Gospels, based on a school Alcott (and his\nassistant Elizabeth Peabody) ran in Boston, argued that evidence for\nthe truth of Christianity could be found in the unimpeded flow of\nchildren\u2019s thought. What people particularly noticed about\nAlcott\u2019s book, however, were its frank discussions of\nconception, circumcision, and childbirth. Rather than gaining support\nfor his school, the publication of the book caused many parents to\nwithdraw their children from it, and the school\u2014like many of\nAlcott\u2019s projects, failed.\n\nTheodore Parker (1810\u201360) was the son of a farmer who attended\nHarvard and became a Unitarian minister and accomplished linguist. He\npublished a long critical essay on David Friedrich Strauss\u2019s\nDas Leben Jesu, and translated Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de\nWette\u2019s Introduction to the Old Testament, both of\nwhich cast doubt on the divine inspiration and single authorship of\nthe Bible. After the publication of his \u201cA Discourse Concerning\nthe Transient and Permanent in Christianity\u201d (1841) he was\ninvited to resign from the Boston Association of Ministers (he did\nnot), and was no longer welcome in many pulpits. He argued, much as\nEmerson had in the \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d that\nChristianity had nothing essential to do with the person of Jesus:\n\u201cIf Jesus taught at Athens, and not at Jerusalem; if he had\nwrought no miracle, and none but the human nature had ever been\nascribed to him; if the Old Testament had forever perished at his\nbirth, Christianity would still have been the Word of God \u2026\njust as true, just as lasting, just as beautiful, as now it\nis\u2026\u201d (T, 352). Parker exploited the similarities between\nscience and religious doctrine to argue that although nature and\nreligious truth are permanent, any merely human version of such truth\nis transient. In religious doctrines especially, there are stunning\nreversals, so that \u201cmen are burned for professing what men are\nburned for denying\u201d (T, 347).\n\nSurveying the scene in his 1842 lecture, \u201cThe\nTranscendentalist,\u201d Emerson begins with a philosophical account,\naccording to which what are generally called \u201cnew views\u201d\nare not really new, but rather part of a broad tradition of idealism.\nIt is not a skeptical idealism, however, but an anti-skeptical\nidealism deriving from Kant:\n\nIt is well known to most of my audience, that the Idealism of the\npresent day acquired the name of Transcendental, from the use of that\nterm by Immanuel Kant, of Konigsberg [sic], who replied to the\nskeptical philosophy of Locke, which insisted that there was nothing\nin the intellect which was not previously in the experience of the\nsenses, by showing that there was a very important class of ideas, or\nimperative forms, which did not come by experience, but through which\nexperience was acquired; that these were intuitions of the mind\nitself; and he denominated them Transcendental forms (O, 101\u20132).\n\n\nEmerson shows here a basic understanding of three Kantian claims,\nwhich can be traced throughout his philosophy: that the human mind\n\u201cforms\u201d experience; that the existence of such mental\noperations is a counter to skepticism; and that\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d does not mean \u201ctranscendent\u201d\nor beyond human experience altogether, but something through which\nexperience is made possible. Emerson\u2019s idealism is not purely\nKantian, however, for (like Coleridge\u2019s) it contains a strong\nadmixture of Neoplatonism and post-Kantian idealism. Emerson thinks of\nReason, for example, as a faculty of \u201cvision,\u201d as opposed\nto the mundane understanding, which \u201ctoils all the time,\ncompares, contrives, adds, argues\u2026.\u201d (Letters,\nvol. 1, 413). For many of the transcendentalists the term\n\u201ctranscendentalism\u201d represented nothing so technical as an\ninquiry into the presuppositions of human experience, but a new\nconfidence in and appreciation of the mind\u2019s powers, and a\nmodern, non-doctrinal spirituality. The transcendentalist, Emerson\nstates, believes in miracles, conceived as \u201cthe perpetual\nopenness of the human mind to new influx of light and\npower\u2026\u201d (O, 100).\n\nEmerson keeps his distance from the transcendentalists in his essay by\nspeaking always of what \u201cthey\u201d say or do, despite the fact\nthat he was regarded then and is regarded now as the leading\ntranscendentalist. He notes with some disdain that the\ntranscendentalists are \u201c\u2019not good members of\nsociety,\u201d that they do not work for \u201cthe abolition of the\nslave-trade\u201d (though both these charges have been leveled at\nhim). He closes the essay nevertheless with a defense of the\ntranscendentalist critique of a society pervaded by \u201ca spirit of\ncowardly compromise and seeming, which intimates a frightful\nskepticism, a life without love, and an activity without an aim\u201d\n(O, 106). This critique is Emerson\u2019s own in such writings as\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d and \u201cThe American Scholar\u201d;\nand it finds a powerful and original restatement in the\n\u201cEconomy\u201d chapter of Thoreau\u2019s Walden.\n2. High Tide: The Dial, Fuller, Thoreau\n\nThe transcendentalists had several publishing outlets: at first\nThe Christian Examiner, then, after the furor over the\n\u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d The Western Messenger\n(1835\u201341) in St Louis, then the Boston Quarterly Review\n(1838\u201344). The Dial (1840\u20134) was a special case,\nfor it was planned and instituted by the members of the Transcendental\nClub, with Margaret Fuller (1810\u201350) as the first editor.\nEmerson succeeded her for the magazine\u2019s last two years. The\nwriting in The Dial was uneven, but in its four years of\nexistence it published Fuller\u2019s \u201cThe Great Lawsuit\u201d\n(the core of her Woman in the Nineteenth Century) and her\nlong review of Goethe\u2019s work; prose and poetry by Emerson;\nAlcott\u2019s \u201cOrphic Sayings\u201d (which gave the magazine a\nreputation for silliness); and the first publications of a young\nfriend of Emerson\u2019s, Henry David Thoreau (1817\u201362). After\nEmerson became editor in 1842 The Dial published a series of\n\u201cEthnical Scriptures,\u201d translations from Chinese and\nIndian philosophical works.\n\nMargaret Fuller was the daughter of a Massachusetts congressman who\nprovided tutors for her in Latin, Greek, chemistry, philosophy and,\nlater, German. Exercising what Barbara Packer calls \u201cher\npeculiar powers of intrusion and caress\u201d (P, 443), Fuller became\nfriends with many of the transcendentalists, including Emerson. In the\nwinters of 1839\u201344, Fuller organized a series of popular and\ninfluential \u201cconversations\u201d for women in Elizabeth\nPeabody\u2019s bookstore in Boston. She journeyed to the Midwest in\nthe summer of 1843, and published her observations as Summer on\nthe Lakes the following year. After this publishing success,\nHorace Greeley, a friend of Emerson\u2019s and the editor of the\nNew York Tribune, invited her to New York to write for the\nTribune. Fuller abandoned her previously ornate and\npretentious style, issuing pithy reviews and forthright criticisms:\nfor example, of Longfellow\u2019s poetry and Carlyle\u2019s\nattraction to brutality. Fuller was in Europe from 1846\u20139,\nsending back hundreds of pages for the Tribune. On her return\nto America with her husband and son, she drowned in a hurricane off\nthe coast of Fire Island, New York.\n\nWoman in the Nineteenth Century (1845), a revision of her\n\u201cGreat Lawsuit\u201d manifesto in The Dial, is\nFuller\u2019s major philosophical work. She holds that masculinity\nand femininity pass into one another, that there is \u201cno wholly\nmasculine man, no purely feminine woman\u201d (T, 418). In classical\nmythology, for example, \u201cMan partakes of the feminine in the\nApollo; woman of the Masculine as Minerva.\u201d But there are\ndifferences. The feminine genius is \u201celectrical\u201d and\n\u201cintuitive,\u201d the male more inclined to classification (T,\n419). Women are treated as dependents, however, and their self-reliant\nimpulses are often held against them. What they most want, Fuller\nmaintains, is the freedom to unfold their powers, a freedom necessary\nnot only for their self-development, but for the renovation of\nsociety. Like Thoreau and Emerson, Fuller calls for periods of\nwithdrawal from a society whose members are in various states of\n\u201cdistraction\u201d and \u201cimbecility,\u201d and a return\nonly after \u201cthe renovating fountains\u201d of individuality\nhave risen up. Such individuality is necessary in particular for the\nproper constitution of that form of society known as marriage.\n\u201cUnion,\u201d she holds, \u201cis only possible to those who\nare units\u201d (T, 419). In contrast, most marriages are forms of\ndegradation, in which \u201cthe woman does belong to the man, instead\nof forming a whole with him\u201d (T, 422).\n\nHenry Thoreau studied Latin, Greek, Italian, French, German, and\nSpanish at Harvard, where he heard Emerson\u2019s \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d as the commencement address in 1837. He first published\nin The Dial when Emerson commissioned him to review a series\nof reports on wildlife by the state of Massachusetts, but he cast\nabout for a literary outlet after The Dial\u2019s failure in\n1844. In 1845, his move to Walden Pond allowed him to complete his\nfirst book, A Week on the Concord and the Merrimac Rivers. He\nalso wrote a first draft of Walden, which eventually appeared\nin 1854.\n\nNature comes to even more prominence in Walden than in\nEmerson\u2019s Nature, which it followed by eighteen years.\nNature now becomes particular: this tree, this bird, this state of the\npond on a summer evening or winter morning become Thoreau\u2019s\nsubjects. Thoreau is receptive. He finds himself \u201csuddenly\nneighbor to\u201d rather than a hunter of birds (W, 85); and he\nlearns to dwell in a house that is no more and no less than a place\nwhere he can properly sit. From the right perspective, Thoreau finds,\nhe can possess and use a farm with more satisfaction than the farmer,\nwho is preoccupied with feeding his family and expanding his\noperations.\n\nIn Walden\u2019s opening chapter, \u201cEconomy,\u201d\nThoreau considers the trade-offs we make in life, and he asks, as\nPlato did in The Republic, what are life\u2019s real\nnecessities. Like the Roman philosophers Marcus Porcius Cato and\nMarcus Varro he seeks a \u201clife of simplicity, independence,\nmagnanimity, and trust\u201d (W, 15). Considering his contemporaries,\nhe finds that \u201cthe mass of men lead lives of quiet\ndesperation\u201d (W, 8). Thoreau\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d at\nWalden shows that a life of simplicity and independence can be\nachieved today (W, 17). If Thoreau counsels simple frugality\u2014a\nvegetarian diet for example, and a dirt floor\u2014he also counsels a\nkind of extravagance, a spending of what you have in the day that\nshall never come again. True economy, he writes, is a matter of\n\u201cimproving the nick of time\u201d (W, 17).\n\nThoreau went to Walden Pond on the anniversary of America\u2019s\ndeclared independence from Britain\u2014July 4, 1845, declaring his\nown independence from a society that is \u201ccommonly too\ncheap.\u201d It is not that he is against all society, but that he\nfinds we meet too often, before we have had the chance to acquire any\n\u201cnew value for each other\u201d (W, 136). Thoreau welcomes\nthose visitors who \u201cspeak reservedly and thoughtfully\u201d (W,\n141), and who preserve an appropriate sense of distance; he values the\nlittle leaves or acorns left by visitors he never meets. Thoreau lived\nat Walden for just under three years, a time during which he sometimes\nvisited friends and conducted business in town. (It was on one such\nvisit, to pick up a mended shoe, that he was arrested for tax\navoidance, an episode that became the occasion for \u201cResistance\nto Civil Government.\u201d)\n\nAt the opening of Walden\u2019s chapter on \u201cHigher Laws\u201d\nThoreau confesses to once having desired to slaughter a woodchuck and\neat it raw, just to get at its wild essence. He values fishing and\nhunting for their taste of wildness, though he finds that in middle\nage he has given up eating meat. He finds wildness not only in the\nwoods, but in such literary works as Hamlet and the\nIliad; and even in certain forms of society: \u201cThe\nwildness of the savage is but a faint symbol of the awful ferity with\nwhich good men and lovers meet\u201d (\u201cWalking\u201d (1862),\np. 621). The wild is not always consoling or uplifting, however. In\nThe Maine Woods, Thoreau records a climb on Mount Ktaadn in\nMaine when he confronted the alien materiality of the world; and in\nCape Cod (1865), he records the foreignness, not the\nfriendliness, of nature: the shore is \u201ca wild, rank place, and\nthere is no flattery in it\u201d (P, 577).\n\nAlthough Walden initiates the American tradition of\nenvironmental philosophy, it is equally concerned with reading and\nwriting. In the chapter on \u201cReading,\u201d Thoreau speaks of\nbooks that demand and inspire \u201creading, in a high sense\u201d\n(W, 104). He calls such books \u201cheroic,\u201d and finds them\nequally in literature and philosophy, in Europe and Asia: \u201cVedas\nand Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and\nShakespeares\u2026\u201d (W, 104). Thoreau suggests that\nWalden is or aspires to be such a book; and indeed the\nenduring construction from his time at Walden is not the cabin he\nbuilt but the book he wrote.\n\nThoreau maintains in Walden that writing is \u201cthe work\nof art closest to life itself\u201d (W, 102). In his search for such\ncloseness, he began to reconceive the nature of his journal. Both he\nand Emerson kept journals from which their published works were\nderived. But in the early 1850s, Thoreau began to conceive of the\njournal as a work in itself, \u201ceach page of which should be\nwritten in its own season & out of doors or in its own locality\nwherever it may be\u201d (J, 67). A journal has a sequence set by the\ndays, but it may have no order; or what order it has emerges in the\nwriter\u2019s life as he meets the life of nature. With its chapters\non \u201cReading,\u201d \u201cSolitude,\u201d\n\u201cEconomy,\u201d \u201cWinter,\u201d and \u201cSpring,\u201d\nWalden is more \u201cworked up\u201d than the journal; in\nthis sense, Thoreau came to feel, it is less close to nature than the\njournal.\n3. Social and Political Critiques\n\nThe transcendentalists operated from the start with the sense that the\nsociety around them was seriously deficient: a \u201cmass\u201d of\n\u201cbugs or spawn\u201d as Emerson put it in \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d; slavedrivers of themselves, as Thoreau says in\nWalden. Thus the attraction of alternative life-styles:\nAlcott\u2019s ill-fated Fruitlands; Brook Farm, planned and organized\nby the Transcendental Club; Thoreau\u2019s cabin at Walden. As the\nnineteenth century came to its mid-point, the\ntranscendentalists\u2019 dissatisfaction with their society became\nfocused on policies and actions of the United States government: the\ntreatment of the Native Americans, the war with Mexico, and, above\nall, the continuing and expanding practice of slavery.\n\nEmerson\u2019s 1838 letter to President Martin Van Buren is an early\nexpression of the depth of his despair at actions of his country, in\nthis case the ethnic cleansing of American land east of the\nMississippi. The 16,000 Cherokees lived in what is now Kentucky and\nTennessee, and in parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia. They\nwere one of the more assimilated tribes, whose members owned property,\ndrove carriages, used plows and spinning wheels, and even owned\nslaves. Wealthy Cherokees sent their children to elite academies or\nseminaries. The Cherokee chief refused to sign a \u201cremoval\u201d\nagreement with the government of Andrew Jackson, but the government\nfound a minority faction to agree to move to territories west of the\nMississippi. Despite the ruling by the Supreme Court under Chief\nJustice John Marshall that the Cherokee Nation\u2019s sovereignty had\nbeen violated, Jackson\u2019s policies continued to take effect. In\n1838, President Van Buren, Jackson\u2019s former Vice-President and\napproved successor, ordered the U. S. Army into the Cherokee Nation,\nwhere they rounded up as many remaining members of the tribe as they\ncould and marched them west and across the Mississippi. Thousands died\nalong the way. In his letter to President Van Buren, Emerson calls\nthis \u201ca crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees\nof a country; for how could we call the conspiracy that should crush\nthese poor Indians our Government, or the land that was cursed by\ntheir parting and dying imprecations our country, any more?\u201d (A,\n3).\n\nSlavery had existed in the United States from the beginnings of the\ncountry, but the question of its morality and entrenchment within the\nAmerican political system came to the fore with the annexation of\nTexas, where slavery was legal, and its admission to the Union as the\n28th state in 1845. Emerson\u2019s breakout address \u201cOn the\nEmancipation of the Negroes in the British West Indies\u201d (1844)\nwas delivered in this context. (The Slavery Abolition Act was passed\nby the British Parliament in 1833 and celebrated annually in Concord.)\nIn his address Emerson wrote: \u201cLanguage must be raked, the\nsecrets of slaughter-houses and infamous holes that cannot front the\nday, must be ransacked, to tell what negro-slavery has been. These\nmen, our benefactors, \u2026 the producers of comfort and luxury for\nthe civilized world. \u2026 I am heartsick when I read how they came\nthere, and how they are kept there. Their case was left out of the\nmind and out of the heart of their brothers\u201d (A, 9).\n\nFrederick Douglass spoke in Concord at Thoreau\u2019s invitation, and\nwas on the dais in Concord in August 1844, when Emerson delivered his\nemancipation address, where he states: \u201cThe Black Man carries in\nhis bosom an indispensable element of a new and coming\ncivilization\u201d (Wirzbicki, 95; A, 31). Douglass took up\nEmerson\u2019s term \u201cself-reliance\u201d in advice to his\nreaders and hearers, and he quotes \u201cThe American Scholar\u201d\nin his abolitionist newspaper North Star. \u201cIt is a\nmischievous notion,\u201d Douglass quotes Emerson as saying,\n\u201cthat we are come late into nature; that the world was finished\na long time ago. As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of\nGod so is it ever to so much of his attribute that we bring to\nit\u201d (Wirzbicki, 53; O, 47).\n\nAnother important black abolitionist with Transcendentalist leanings\nand connections was William C. Nell, who founded Boston\u2019s\nAdelphic Union Library Association in 1836. Nell attended Bronson\nAlcott\u2019s conversations, heard Emerson speak, and participated in\nEmerson\u2019s Town and Country Club. He referred to Emerson as the\n\u201cever-to-be-honored friend of equal rights\u201d (Wirzbicki,\n55). The leadership of Nell\u2019s Association was black, but invited\nspeakers included prominent black and white abolitionists, including\nDouglass, Wendell Phillips, and Angelina Grimk\u00e9. Nell founded\nthe New England Freedom Association in 1842 to \u201cextend the\nhelping hand to the \u2018chattel\u2019 who may have taken to itself\n\u2018wings\u2019\u201d (Wirzbicki, 148); and he joined with Lewis\nHayden (who had escaped slavery in Kentucky) to establish the Boston\nVigilance Committee after passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850.\nThoreau worked with both Nell and Hayden. He brought Hayden to Concord\nto speak to the Concord Female Anti-Slavery Society, and he\ncontributed to the Underground Railroad by hosting fugitives in his\ncabin at Walden Pond (Wirzbicki, 158).\n\nFuller addresses American slavery directly in Woman in the\nNineteenth Century, recalling her dread at the news that James K.\nPolk, a Tennessee slaveholder who favored the extension of slavery to\nTexas, had been elected the nation\u2019s 11th president (by an\nall-male electorate). The \u201cchoice of the people,\u201d she\nwrote, \u201cthreatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy\nof sin permanently on this nation, with the annexation of\nTexas!\u201d (F, 97). Addressing \u201c[t]he women of my\ncountry,\u201d she asks: \u201chave you nothing to do with this? You\nsee the men, how they are willing to sell shamelessly, the happiness\nof countless generations of fellow-creatures, the honor of their\ncountry, and their immortal souls for a money market and political\npower. Do you not feel within you that which can reprove them, which\ncan check, which can convince them? You would not speak in vain;\nwhether each in her own home, or banded in union\u201d (F, 98).\n\nThis call both to the individual and to individuals acting together\ncharacterizes Thoreau\u2019s \u201cResistance to Civil\nGovernment\u201d (1849). Thoreau was arrested in 1846 for nonpayment\nof his poll tax, and he took the opportunity presented by his night in\njail to meditate on the authority of the state. The government,\nThoreau argues, is but an expedient by which we succeed \u201cin\nletting one another alone\u201d (R, 64). The citizen has no duty to\nresign his conscience to the state, and may even have a duty to oppose\nimmoral legislation such as that which supports slavery and the\nMexican War. Thoreau concludes: \u201cI cannot for an instant\nrecognize that political organization as my government which is the\nslave\u2019s government also\u201d (R, 67). Slavery could be\nabolished by a \u201cpeaceable revolution,\u201d he continues, if\npeople refused to pay their taxes and clogged the system by going to\njail (R, 76).\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Law passed by the United States Congress in 1850\nhad dramatic and visible effects not only in Georgia or Mississippi\nbut in Massachusetts and New York. For the law required all citizens\nof the country to assist in returning fugitive slaves to their owners.\nThis extension of the slave-system to the north, the subject of\nThoreau\u2019s \u201cSlavery in Massachusetts\u201d (1854), was on\npublic view when an escaped slave named Anthony Burns was captured in\nBoston, tried by a Massachusetts court, and escorted by the\nMassachusetts militia and U. S. marines to the harbor, where he was\ntaken back to slavery in Virginia. His owner placed him in a notorious\n\u201cslave pen\u201d outside Richmond, where Burns was handcuffed,\nchained at the ankles and left to lie in his own filth for four\nmonths. Thoreau denounced the absurdity of a court in Boston\n\u201ctrying a MAN, to find out if he is not really a SLAVE,\u201d\nwhen the question has already been \u201cdecided from eternity\u201d\n(R, 92). In his \u201cLecture on Slavery\u201d of 1855, Emerson\ncalls the original 1787 Constitution\u2019s recognition of slavery a\n\u201ccrime\u201d (A, 100), and he contrasts the written law of the\nconstitution with the \u201cLaws\u201d and \u201cRight\u201d\nascertained by Jesus, Menu, Moses, and Confucius. An immoral law, he\nholds, is void.\n\nAlthough Thoreau advocated nonviolent action in \u201cResistance to\nCivil Government,\u201d he later supported the violent actions of\nJohn Brown, who killed unarmed pro-slavery settlers in Kansas, and in\n1859 attacked the federal arsenal at Harper\u2019s Ferry, Virginia.\nIn \u201cA Plea for Captain John Brown,\u201d Thoreau portrays Brown\nas an \u201cAngel of Light\u201d (R, 137) and \u201ca\ntranscendentalist above all\u201d (115) who believed \u201cthat a\nman has a perfect right to interfere by force with the slaveholder, in\norder to rescue the slave\u201d (R,132). In early 1860, just months\nbefore the outbreak of the Civil War, he and Emerson participated in\npublic commemorations of Brown\u2019s life and actions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cell-rl cellpad-small-dense vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "<strong>A</strong>", "<em>Emerson\u2019s Antislavery Writings</em>, Joel Myerson and\nLen Gougeon (eds.), New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995. </tr>\n<tr>", "<strong>F</strong>", "Fuller, Margaret, <em>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</em>,\nLarry J.
