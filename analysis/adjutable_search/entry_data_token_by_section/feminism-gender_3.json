    "main_text": "Gender as socially constructed || Gender socialisation\n2.1 Gender socialisation\n\nOne way to interpret Beauvoir\u2019s claim that one is not born but\nrather becomes a woman is to take it as a claim about gender\nsocialisation: females become women through a process whereby they\nacquire feminine traits and learn feminine behaviour. Masculinity and\nfemininity are thought to be products of nurture or how individuals\nare brought up. They are causally constructed (Haslanger\n1995, 98): social forces either have a causal role in bringing\ngendered individuals into existence or (to some substantial sense)\nshape the way we are qua women and men. And the mechanism of\nconstruction is social learning. For instance, Kate Millett takes\ngender differences to have \u201cessentially cultural, rather than\nbiological bases\u201d that result from differential treatment (1971,\n28\u20139). For her, gender is \u201cthe sum total of the\nparents\u2019, the peers\u2019, and the culture\u2019s notions of\nwhat is appropriate to each gender by way of temperament, character,\ninterests, status, worth, gesture, and expression\u201d (Millett\n1971, 31). Feminine and masculine gender-norms, however, are\nproblematic in that gendered behaviour conveniently fits with and\nreinforces women\u2019s subordination so that women are socialised\ninto subordinate social roles: they learn to be passive, ignorant,\ndocile, emotional helpmeets for men (Millett 1971, 26). However, since\nthese roles are simply learned, we can create more equal societies by\n\u2018unlearning\u2019 social roles. That is, feminists should aim\nto diminish the influence of socialisation.\n\nSocial learning theorists hold that a huge array of different\ninfluences socialise us as women and men. This being the case, it is\nextremely difficult to counter gender socialisation. For instance,\nparents often unconsciously treat their female and male children\ndifferently. When parents have been asked to describe their\n24-hour old infants, they have done so using\ngender-stereotypic language: boys are describes as strong, alert and\ncoordinated and girls as tiny, soft and delicate. Parents\u2019\ntreatment of their infants further reflects these descriptions whether\nthey are aware of this or not (Renzetti & Curran 1992, 32). Some\nsocialisation is more overt: children are often dressed in gender\nstereotypical clothes and colours (boys are dressed in blue, girls in\npink) and parents tend to buy their children gender stereotypical\ntoys. They also (intentionally or not) tend to reinforce certain\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 behaviours. While the precise form of gender\nsocialization has changed since the onset of second-wave feminism,\neven today girls are discouraged from playing sports like football or\nfrom playing \u2018rough and tumble\u2019 games and are more likely\nthan boys to be given dolls or cooking toys to play with; boys are\ntold not to \u2018cry like a baby\u2019 and are more likely to be\ngiven masculine toys like trucks and guns (for more, see Kimmel 2000,\n 122\u2013126).[1]\n\nAccording to social learning theorists, children are also influenced\nby what they observe in the world around them. This, again, makes\ncountering gender socialisation difficult. For one, children\u2019s\nbooks have portrayed males and females in blatantly stereotypical\nways: for instance, males as adventurers and leaders, and females as\nhelpers and followers. One way to address gender stereotyping in\nchildren\u2019s books has been to portray females in independent\nroles and males as non-aggressive and nurturing (Renzetti & Curran\n1992, 35). Some publishers have attempted an alternative approach by\nmaking their characters, for instance, gender-neutral animals or\ngenderless imaginary creatures (like TV\u2019s Teletubbies). However,\nparents reading books with gender-neutral or genderless characters\noften undermine the publishers\u2019 efforts by reading them to their\nchildren in ways that depict the characters as either feminine or\nmasculine. According to Renzetti and Curran, parents labelled the\noverwhelming majority of gender-neutral characters masculine whereas\nthose characters that fit feminine gender stereotypes (for instance,\nby being helpful and caring) were labelled feminine (1992, 35).\nSocialising influences like these are still thought to send implicit\nmessages regarding how females and males should act and are expected\nto act shaping us into feminine and masculine persons.\n",
