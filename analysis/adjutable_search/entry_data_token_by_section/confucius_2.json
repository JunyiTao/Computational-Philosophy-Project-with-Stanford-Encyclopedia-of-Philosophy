Ritual Psychology and Social Values\n\nThe Records of Ritual, the Analects, and numerous\nHan collections portray Confucius as being deeply\nconcerned with the proper performance of ritual and music. In such works, the description of the attitudes and affect of the performer became the foundation of a\nritual psychology in which proper performance was key to reforming\ndesires and beginning to develop moral dispositions. Confucius sought\nto preserve the Zhou ritual system, and theorized about how ritual and\nmusic inculcated social roles, limited desires and transformed\ncharacter.\n\nMany biographies begin their description of his life with a story of\nConfucius at an early age performing rituals, reflecting accounts and\nstatements that demonstrate his prodigious mastery of ritual and\nmusic. The archaeological record shows that one legacy of the Zhou\nperiod into which Confucius was born was a system of sumptuary\nregulations that encoded social status. Another of these legacies was\nancestral sacrifice, a means to demonstrate people\u2019s reverence\nfor their ancestors while also providing a way to ask the spirits to\nassist them or to guarantee them protection from harm. The\nAnalects describes the ritual mastery of Confucius in\nreceiving guests at a noble\u2019s home (10.3), and in carrying out\nsacrifices (10.8, 15.1). He plays the stone chimes (14.39),\ndistinguishes between proper and improper music (15.11, 17.18), and\nextols and explains the Classic of Odes to his disciples\n(1.15, 2.2, 8.3, 16.13, 17.9). This mastery of classical ritual and\nmusical forms is an important reason Confucius said he \u201cfollowed\nZhou\u201d (3.14). While he might alter a detail of a ritual out of\nfrugality (9.3), Confucius insists on adherence to the letter of the rites,\nas when his disciple Zi Gong \u5b50\u8ca2 sought to substitute another animal for a\nsheep in a seasonal sacrifice, saying \u201cthough you care about the\nsheep, I care about the ritual\u201d (3.17). It was in large part\nthis adherence to Zhou period cultural forms, or to what Confucius\nreconstructed them to be, that has led many in the modern period to\nlabel him a traditionalist.\n\nWhere Confucius clearly innovated was in his rationale for performing\nthe rites and music. Historian Yan Buke \u95bb\u6b65\u514b has\nargued that the early Confucian (Ru) tradition began from the\noffice of the \u201cMusic master\u201d (Yueshi\n\u6a02\u5e2b) described in the\nRitual of Zhou (Zhou Li \u5468\u79ae). Yan\u2019s view is that\nsince these officials were responsible for teaching the rites, music,\nand the Classic of Odes, it was their combined expertise that\ndeveloped into the particular vocation that shaped the outlook of\nConfucius. Early discussions of ritual in the Zhou classics often\nexplained ritual in terms of a do ut des view of making\nofferings to receive benefits. By contrast, early discussions between\nConfucius and his disciples described benefits of ritual performance\nthat went beyond the propitiation of spirits, rewards from the\nancestors, or the maintenance of the social or cosmic order. Instead\nof emphasizing goods that were external to the performer, these works\nstressed the value of the associated interior psychological states of\nthe practitioner. In Analects 3.26, Confucius condemns the\nperformance of ritual without reverence (jing \u656c). He also\ncondemns views of ritual that focus only on the offerings, or views of\nmusic that focus only on the instruments (17.11). Passages from the Records of\nRitual explain that Confucius would rather have an excess of\nreverence than an excess of ritual (\u201cTangong,\nshang\u201d \u6a80\u5f13\u4e0a), and that reverence is the most important aspect of\nmourning rites (\u201cZaji, xia\u201d \u96dc\u8a18\u4e0b). This emphasis on the\nimportance of an attitude of reverence became the salient distinction\nbetween performing ritual in a rote manner, and performing it in the\nproper affective state. Another passage from the Records of Ritual\nsays the difference between how an ideal gentleman and a\nlesser person cares for a parent is that the gentleman is reverent\nwhen he does it (\u201cFangji\u201d \u574a\u8a18, cf. Analects\n2.7). In contexts concerning both ritual and filial piety (xiao \u5b5d),\nthe affective state behind the action is arguably more important than\nthe action\u2019s consequences. As Philip J. Ivanhoe has\nwritten, ritual and music are not just an indicator of values in the\nsense that these examples show, but also an inculcator of them.\n\nIn this ritual psychology, the performance of ritual and music restricts\ndesires because it alters the performer\u2019s affective states, and\nplace limits on appetitive desires. The Records of Ritual\nillustrates desirable affective states, describing how the Zhou\nfounder King Wen \u6587 was moved to joy when making offerings to\nhis deceased parents, but then to grief once the ritual ended\n(\u201cJiyi\u201d \u796d\u7fa9). A collection\nassociated with the third century BCE philosopher Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 contains a\nConfucius quotation that associates different parts of a ruler\u2019s\nday with particular emotions. Entering the ancestral temple to make\nofferings and maintain a connection to those who are no longer living\nleads the ruler to reflect on sorrow, while wearing a cap to hear\nlegal cases leads him to reflect on worry (\u201cAigong\u201d \u54c0\u516c). These are examples of the way that\nritual fosters the development of particular emotional responses, part\nof a sophisticated understanding of affective states and the ways that\nperformance channels them in particular directions. More generally,\nthe social conventions implicit in ritual hierarchies restrict\npeople\u2019s latitude to pursue their desires, as the master\nexplains in the Records of Ritual: \n\n\nThe way of the gentleman may be compared to an embankment dam,\nbolstering those areas where ordinary people are deficient\n(\u201cFangji\u201d). \n\n\nBlocking the overflow of desires by adhering to these social norms\npreserves psychological space to reflect and reform one\u2019s\nreactions.\n\nDescriptions of the early community depict Confucius creating a\nsubculture in which ritual provided an alternate source of value,\neffectively training his disciples to opt out of conventional modes of\nexchange. In the Analects, when Confucius says he would\ninstruct any person who presented him with \u201ca bundle of dried\nmeat\u201d (7.7), he is highlighting how his standards of value\nderive from the sacrificial system, eschewing currency or luxury\nitems. Gifts valuable in ordinary situations might be worth little by\nsuch standards: \u201cEven if a friend gave him a gift of a carriage\nand horses, if it was not dried meat, he did not bow\u201d (10.15).\nThe Han period biographical materials in Records of the\nHistorian describe how a high official of the state of Lu did not\ncome to court for three days after the state of Qi made him a gift of\nfemale entertainers. When, additionally, the high official failed to\nproperly offer gifts of sacrificial meats, Confucius\ndeparted Lu for the state of Wei (47, cf. Analects 18.4).\nConfucius repeatedly rejected conventional values of wealth and\nposition, choosing instead to rely on ritual standards of value. In\nsome ways, these stories are similar to ones in the late Warring\nStates and Han period compilation Master Zhuang (Zhuangzi\n\u838a\u5b50) that explore the way that things that are\nconventionally belittled for their lack of utility are useful by an\nunconventional standard.  However, here the standard that gives such objects currency is ritual importance rather than longevity, divorcing\nConfucius from conventional materialistic or hedonistic pursuits. This\nis a second way that ritual allows one to direct more effort into\ncharacter formation.\n\nOnce, when speaking of cultivating benevolence, Confucius explained\nhow ritual value was connected to the ideal way of the gentleman,\nwhich should always take precedence over the pursuit of conventional\nvalues: \n\n\nWealth and high social status are what others covet. If I cannot\nprosper by following the way, I will not dwell in them. Poverty and\nlow social status are what others shun. If I cannot prosper by\nfollowing the way, I will not avoid them. (4.5) \n\n\nThe argument that ritual performance has internal benefits underlies\nthe ritual psychology laid out by Confucius, one that explains how\nperforming ritual and music controls desires and sets the stage for\nfurther moral development.\n",
