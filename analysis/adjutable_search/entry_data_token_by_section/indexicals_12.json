    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || True Demonstratives in Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n3.3 True Demonstratives in Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n\n\nKaplan contemplates two ways of extending his theory to true\ndemonstratives. In his1989a, he uses dthat-terms to do so. A\ndthat-term is a term of the form \u201cdthat[\\(t\\)]\u201d, where\n\\(t\\) is a singular term, such as a definite description or proper\nname. The content of \u2018dthat[\\(t\\)]\u2019 in a context\n\\(c\\) is the object to which the term \\(t\\) refers in\n\\(c\\). For example, the content of \u2018dthat[the dog I see\nnow]\u2019, in a context \\(c\\), is Fido iff: there is exactly one\ndog in the world of \\(c\\) whom the agent of \\(c\\) sees at the\ntime of \\(c\\) in the world of \\(c\\), and that dog is Fido.\nKaplan (1989a) uses dthat-terms to represent the demonstrative\n\u2018that\u2019 together with a type of demonstration. Kaplan holds\nthat a type of demonstration presents a demonstratum in a particular\nway, and a definite description (that may contain indexicals) can\ncapture the way in which the demonstration presents the demonstratum.\nThus, Kaplan (1989a) might use the dthat-term \u2018dthat[the dog I\nsee to my left]\u2019 to represent Mary\u2019s use of the word\n\u2018that\u2019 together with the type of demonstration that she\nuses to present a dog to her left. If Mary utters \u2018That is larger\nthan that\u2019 while pointing first to a dog to her left and then to\na dog to her right, then Kaplan might use the formal sentence (12) to\nrepresent Mary\u2019s sentence-plus-demonstrations.\n\n(12)\n\nDthat[the dog I see to my left] is larger than dthat[the dog I see to my right].\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(c\\) is a context in which the agent of \\(c\\) sees\nFido to her left and Rover to her right, then the content in \\(c\\)\nof the first dthat-term is Fido and the content of the second\ndthat-term in \\(c\\) is Rover. Kaplan anticipates treating other\ntrue demonstratives, such as \u2018you\u2019, in similar ways. (For\ncritical discussion, see Salmon 2002.)\n\n\nKaplan presents a different treatment of true demonstratives in his\n1989b. Kaplan adds to each context an addressee and a demonstratum, and\nstipulates that the content of \u2018you\u2019 in any context\n\\(c\\) is the addressee of \\(c\\) and the content of\n\u2018that\u2019 in any context \\(c\\) is the demonstratum of\n\\(c\\). Contexts may have sequences of multiple addressees and\nsequences of multiple demonstrata. Corresponding subscripts can be\nadded to \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019. If so, the content\nof \u2018you1\u2019 with respect to \\(c\\) is the\nfirst addressee of \\(c\\), the content of\n\u2018you2\u2019 in \\(c\\) is the second addressee of\n\\(c\\), and so on; similarly, the content of\n\u2018that1\u2019 is the first demonstratum of \\(c\\),\nthe content of \u2018that2\u2019 is the second\ndemonstratum, and so on.
