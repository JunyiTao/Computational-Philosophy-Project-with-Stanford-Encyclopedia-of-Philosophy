    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus || Suicide as a Response to Absurdity\n3.1 Suicide as a Response to Absurdity\n\n\u201cThere is only one really serious philosophical problem,\u201d\nCamus says, \u201cand that is suicide. Deciding whether or not life\nis worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.\nAll other questions follow from that\u201d (MS, 3). One\nmight object that suicide is neither a \u201cproblem\u201d nor a\n\u201cquestion,\u201d but an act. A proper, philosophical question\nmight rather be: \u201cUnder what conditions is suicide\nwarranted?\u201d And a philosophical answer might explore the\nquestion, \u201cWhat does it mean to ask whether life is worth\nliving?\u201d as William James did in The Will to Believe.\nFor the Camus of The Myth of Sisyphus, however, \u201cShould\nI kill myself?\u201d is the essential philosophical\nquestion. For him, it seems clear that the primary result of\nphilosophy is action, not comprehension. His concern about \u201cthe\nmost urgent of questions\u201d is less a theoretical one than it is\nthe life-and-death problem of whether and how to live.\n\nCamus sees this question of suicide as a natural response to an\nunderlying reality, namely, that life is absurd. It is absurd to\ncontinually seek meaning in life when there is none; and it is absurd\nto hope for some form of continued existence after death, which\nresults in our extinction. But Camus also thinks it absurd to try to\nknow, understand, or explain the world, since he regards the attempt\nto gain rational knowledge as futile. Here Camus pits himself against\nscience and philosophy, dismissing the claims of all forms of rational\nanalysis: \u201cThat universal reason, practical or ethical, that\ndeterminism, those categories that explain everything are enough to\nmake a decent man laugh\u201d (MS, 21).\n\nThese kinds of absurdity are driving Camus\u2019s question about\nsuicide, but his way of proceeding evokes another kind of absurdity,\none less well-defined, namely, the \u201cabsurd sensibility\u201d\n(MS, 2, tr. changed). This sensibility, vaguely described, seems to be\n\u201can intellectual malady\u201d (MS, 2) rather than a\nphilosophy. He regards thinking about it as \u201cprovisional\u201d\nand insists that the mood of absurdity, so \u201cwidespread in our\nage\u201d does not arise from, but lies prior to, philosophy.\nCamus\u2019s diagnosis of the essential human problem rests on a\nseries of \u201ctruisms\u201d (MS, 18) and \u201cobvious\nthemes\u201d (MS, 16). But he doesn\u2019t argue for\nlife\u2019s absurdity or attempt to explain it\u2014he is not\ninterested in either project, nor would such projects engage his\nstrength as a thinker. \u201cI am interested \u2026 not so much in\nabsurd discoveries as in their consequences\u201d (MS, 16).\nAccepting absurdity as the mood of the times, he asks above all\nwhether and how to live in the face of it. \u201cDoes the absurd\ndictate death\u201d (MS, 9)? But he does not argue this\nquestion either, and rather chooses to demonstrate the attitude\ntowards life that would deter suicide. In other words, the main\nconcern of the book is to sketch ways of living our lives so as to\nmake them worth living despite their being meaningless.\n\nAccording to Camus, people commit suicide \u201cbecause they judge\nlife is not worth living\u201d (MS, 4). But if this\ntemptation precedes what is usually considered philosophical\nreasoning, how to answer it? In order to get to the bottom of things\nwhile avoiding arguing for the truth of his statements, he\ndepicts, enumerates, and illustrates. As he says in The\nRebel, \u201cthe absurd is an experience that must be lived\nthrough, a point of departure, the equivalent, in existence, of\nDescartes\u2019s methodical doubt\u201d (R, 4). The\nMyth of Sisyphus seeks to describe \u201cthe elusive\nfeeling of absurdity\u201d in our lives, rapidly pointing out themes\nthat \u201crun through all literatures and all philosophies\u201d\n(MS, 12). Appealing to common experience, he tries to render\nthe flavor of the absurd with images, metaphors, and anecdotes that\ncapture the experiential level he regards as lying prior to\nphilosophy.\n\nHe begins doing so with an implicit reference to Sartre\u2019s novel,\nNausea, which echoes the protagonist Antoine\nRoquentin\u2019s discovery of absurdity. Camus had earlier written\nthat this novel\u2019s theories of absurdity and its images are not\nin balance. The descriptive and the philosophical aspects of the novel\n\u201cdon\u2019t add up to a work of art: the passage from one to\nthe other is too rapid, too unmotivated, to evoke in the reader the\ndeep conviction that makes art of the novel\u201d (Camus 1968, 200).\nBut in this 1938 review Camus praises Sartre\u2019s descriptions of\nabsurdity, the sense of anguish and nausea that arises as the ordinary\nstructures imposed on existence collapse in Antoine Roquentin\u2019s\nlife. As Camus now presents his own version of the experience,\n\u201cthe stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four hours in the\noffice or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal,\nsleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and\nSunday according to the same rhythm \u2026\u201d (MS,\n12\u20133). As this continues, one slowly becomes fully conscious and\nsenses the absurd.\n",
