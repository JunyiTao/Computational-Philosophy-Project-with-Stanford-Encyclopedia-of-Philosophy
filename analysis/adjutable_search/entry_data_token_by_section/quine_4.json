It also requires that he set\nout, in outline, what is to be included in a naturalistic account of\nthe world; in other words, it requires an account of the world, a\nleast in broad outline. Among other things, this account constrains\nhis epistemology, since that is to be a naturalistic account of\nknowledge.\n\nIn what follows, we shall sometimes speak of Quine\u2019s account of\nthe world as his \u201cmetaphysics\u201d, but it is metaphysics\nnaturalized: it is not carried out a priori, or by reflection\non the nature of Being qu\u00e2 Being, or anything of that\nsort. (Quine himself does not much use the word\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d. He puts forward views on metaphysical\ntopics\u2014such as ontology, time, and abstract objects\u2014but\nwithin the confines of his naturalism.)\n\nQuine approaches his naturalistic analogue of metaphysics through the\nidea of regimented theory. Regimented theory is our overall science,\nthe sum total of our best and most objective knowledge about the\nworld, reformulated in the clearest and simplest form. Quine sees this\nkind of reformulating as of a piece with ordinary scientific\nendeavours, but carried further than working scientists are likely to\nhave reason to do. He discusses the distorting effect which language\nis likely to have on our view of the world and comments:\n\nTo some degree\u2026the scientist can enhance objectivity and\ndiminish the interference of language, by his very choice of language.\nAnd we [meaning we philosophers, we scientists at the abstract and\nphilosophical end of the spectrum], concerned to distill the essence\nof scientific discourse, can profitably purify the language of science\nbeyond what might reasonably be urged upon the practicing scientist.\n(1957, 235)\n\n\nRegimented theory is, of course, an idealization. It is not a complete\nand finished object, available for us to examine. Quine\u2019s\nreflections on it might be considered as something like a\nthought-experiment: if we were to set about assembling our total\ntheory of the world and recasting it in the best form, what would it\nlook like? Since the enterprise is not in fact going to be carried out\nall the way we are not going to get a detailed answer. But on some\nimportant general issues, Quine holds, we can get answers. In\nparticular, he argues that the framework of regimented theory is\nfirst-order logic with identity (and so that theory is extensional);\nthat the variables of this theory range only over physical objects and\nsets; and that the predicates of the theory, the only non-logical\nvocabulary, are physicalistic, in his somewhat complicated sense. (See\nsection 5, below.) Although this is not traditional a priori\nmetaphysics, we should not underestimate the ambition of the project.\nHe says of his regimented theory that \u201call traits of reality\nworthy of the name can be set down in an idiom of this austere form if\nin any idiom\u201d (1960, 228) and speaks of \u201climning the true\nand ultimate structure of reality\u201d (1960, 221). The claim that\nthe variables of regimented theory range only over physical objects\nand sets is, as far as he is concerned, the claim that only physical\nobjects and sets really exist.\n",
