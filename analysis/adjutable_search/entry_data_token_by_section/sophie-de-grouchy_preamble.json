    "main_text": "\n\nSophie de Grouchy (1764\u20131822) was a French philosopher whose\nbook The Letters on Sympathy offers clear and original\nperspectives on a number of important moral, political, and legal\nphilosophical issues. As well as this book, which she published\ntogether with her translation of Smiths\u2019s The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments in 1798, Grouchy wrote and published other texts\npseudonomously and anonymously. In particular, Grouchy published\narticles defending republicanism and participated in the writing and\nediting of her husband\u2019s (Condorcet) last work, the Sketch\nof Human Progress. Unfortunately her work remained in the shadow\nfor many years. The fact that it is now coming to be known in the\nphilosophical community is a function of the general effort in the\nlast twenty years to recover work by women philosophers of the past.\nGrouchy is particularly relevant to philosophers working on (feminist)\nrepublicanism, eighteenth century philosophy, Adam Smith, and social\nand legal philosophy.\n",
