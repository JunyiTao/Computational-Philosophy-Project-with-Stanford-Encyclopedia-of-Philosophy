    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Nature || Romantic Science\n5.2 Romantic Science\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s discussions of nature, organisms and teleological\njudgment in the third Critique, and Schelling\u2019s On\nthe World Soul (1798) and First Outline of a System of\nPhilosophy of Nature (1799) are the primary sources of\ninspiration for romantic science, the metaphysical starting point for\nthe romantic view of nature is what Fredrick Beiser aptly dubbed\n\u201ca strange wedding plan\u201d between Fichte\u2019s idealism\nand Spinoza\u2019s realistic monism (2003:\n 131).[7]\n\nWhy synthetize these seemingly opposed philosophical projects\u2014a\nform of idealism with realism, indeterminism with determinism, and\ndualism with monism? Briefly, in Fichte, the romantics found a\nphilosopher that took the Kantian insight about the absolute value of\nfreedom a step further, and in Spinoza, one who recognized the genuine\nmonistic structure of the universe, where the mental (in the form of\nreason and subjectivity, the seats of freedom) is the flipped side of\nthe physical (in the form of matter and objectivity). If nature itself\nis both physical and mental, if it has a soul or reason and a body,\nthen, it differs from human beings only in degree, not in kind.\nNatural phenomena and human beings are simply different manifestations\nof an encompassing nature, which is therefore nothing other than\nSpirit: \u201cNature should be visible spirit, and spirit should be\ninvisible nature\u201d (Schelling, Ideas for a Philosophy of\nNature, SW 2: 56).\n\nThus, the marriage between the philosophical outlooks of Fichte and\nSpinoza promises to consummate the valuable nucleus of modernity (the\nEnlightenment\u2019s emphasis on freedom and individual rational\ncriticism), while rebutting the modern ills of division and\nalienation. It promises to allow human beings to \u201cfeel at\nhome\u201d in a meaningful, free and natural world. \n\nBut this is only the metaphysical presupposition behind the romantic\nconception of nature. Their understanding of nature, not only as\nmonistic but also as an organic whole that is self-forming and\nself-generating\u2014in their terms, as a creative, living\nforce\u2014is inspired by what, according to them, Kant only started\nto point to, but failed fully to develop in the third\nCritique since he restricted it to a regulative and heuristic\nconception: namely, the conception of organic nature.\n\nThinking about nature as Spirit, different from the human merely in\ndegree, already presupposes a holistic conception of nature, where the\nwhole is prior to the parts. For, if all individuals are, in\nSpinoza\u2019s words \u201cmodes\u201d of nature, namely, merely\ndifferent manifestations of the one and same whole, then these parts\nare necessarily dependent on the whole. But insofar as nature is also\nan (all encompassing) organism, then just as its parts are dependent\non it (for their existence and intelligibility), so it depends on its\nparts for its existence as the organism that it is: independently of\nits parts, an organism could not sustain its particular organization,\ni.e., its life form. In an organism, the parts are the\nreciprocal cause and effect of one another and of the\norganism as a whole.\n\nBut an organism is also self-organizing and\nself-forming. While the organization of artifacts is imposed\non them from outside by their producers, the particular organization\nand so the life form of any organism is self-produced. Consequently,\nto view nature as an organism is to view it dynamically\u2014not as a\ndead matter, but as self-forming and self-generating. Indeed, for the\nromantics, nature is one living force, whose different parts\u2014not\nonly self-conscious philosophers, creative artists, animals, plants,\nand minerals, but also kinds of matter\u2014are different stages of\nits organization.\n\n\nFrom moss, in which the trace of organization is hardly visible, to\nthe noble Form [Gestalt] which seems to have shed the chains\nof matter, the one and same drive within rules, a drive that strives\nto work according to one and the same ideal of purposiveness, strives\nto express ad infinitum one and the same archetype\n[Urbild], the pure form of our Spirit.
