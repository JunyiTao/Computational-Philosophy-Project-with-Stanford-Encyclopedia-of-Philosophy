    "main_text": "\n1. Ideas Understood as Modes of Thinking\n\nAccording to Descartes\u2019 ontology there are substances,\nattributes, and modes. These are understood relative\nto one another, in terms of ontological dependence. Modes depend on\nattributes, and attributes depend on substances. The dependence\nrelation is transitive; thus, modes depend ultimately on substances.\nNo substances, no modes. In Principles, Part I, Article 53,\nDescartes says that a mode \u201cpresupposes\u201d an attribute (AT\nVIIIA 25; CSM I 210), and in Article 52 he says that an attribute\n\u201cpresupposes\u201d an existing substance. A mode of\nsome thing was understood by Descartes as a a way of being\nthat thing. So, where X is some substance, a mode M\nis a way of being X. That said, in Article 52 he also says\nthat a substance minus its attributes cannot be known to the human\nmind. Attributes are in fact what make existing substances\nintelligible to the human mind. He reaffirms this in Article 62, where\nhe says that there is only a distinction in reason between an\nattribute and an existing substance. (AT VIIIA 30; CSM I 214) This\nstrongly suggests that although one may draw a conceptual distinction\nbetween an attribute and existing substance, the two are not distinct\nin reality. They are really one and the same thing. (Nolan 1997,\nHoffman 2002) Subsequently, if mode M is a way of being\nX, where X is the substance, the intelligibility of\nX requires that we conceive some attribute A. And\nso, strictly speaking, mode M is understood as a mode of\nattribute A, where A is the attribute through which\nthe existing substance X is conceived (where in reality\nA and X are presumably identical).\n\nThe nature of a mind, Descartes says, is to think. If a thing does not\nthink, it is not a mind. In terms of his ontology, the mind is an\nexisting (finite) substance, and thought or thinking is its attribute.\nInsofar as the nature of a mind is to think, where thought is the\nmind\u2019s defining feature, Descartes calls it the mind\u2019s\nprincipal attribute (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210\u201311). An\nidea is a mode of thinking. In being a mode of thinking, an\nidea is understood as a way of being (an instance of) thinking, or an\nidea is way in which an instance of thinking is manifested. This is\nsimilar to what Descartes says about a body, its principal attribute,\nand its modes. The nature of a body is to be extended (in length,\nbreadth, and depth). A body is a (finite) substance, and extension is\nits attribute. Since extension is the defining feature of a body,\nDescartes refers to it as a body\u2019s principal attribute. Shape is\na mode of extension. What this means is that shape is a way of being\nextended, or a way in which an instance of extension is manifested.\nThus, shape is to extension as idea is to thought. Thus a shape\npresupposes extension and an idea presupposes thinking, where each\nprincipal attribute presupposes an existing substance.\n\nInsofar as ideas are modes, they occupy the lowest rung on\nDescartes\u2019 ontological ladder. This can be contrasted to\nPlato\u2019s theory, for example, which casts ideas as substances,\noccupying the upper-most rung of the ontological ladder. So, whereas\nfor Plato ideas are the most real things in the cosmos, for Descartes\nideas are among the least real. Another departure from Plato\u2019s\nview was Descartes\u2019 taking ideas as the vehicles of\nrepresentation, as the items doing the representing. By contrast,\nPlato took ideas to be the things represented. Socrates, for instance,\nwas taken by Plato to be a representation of the form or idea of man.\nThese differences are certainly enough to suggest that ideas are\nplaying significantly different roles in their respective systems. So,\nit would not be reasonable to think that Descartes\u2019 view was\nsimply an extension of Plato\u2019s, despite the fact that Descartes\nhad adopted some of Plato\u2019s terminology.\n\nIdeas are not the only modes of thinking. Doubting and judging, for\nexample, are also modes of thinking. Early in the Third Meditation,\nDescartes works out a basic division of the various modes of thinking.\nHe sorts them into two kinds: simple and complex. Ideas are included\nin the category of simple modes. Doubting, judging, and the like, are\nincluded in the category of complex modes. Even so, all complex modes\ninclude ideas as constituents. A complex mode of thought includes at\nleast two basic mental components: an idea and some\n\u201cadditional\u201d mental feature. He writes:\n\n\u2026[C]onsiderations of order appear to dictate that I now\nclassify my thoughts into definite kinds, and ask which of them can\nproperly be said to be the bearers of truth and falsity. Some of my\nthoughts are as it were the images of things, and it is only in these\ncases that the term \u201cidea\u201d is strictly appropriate \u2014\nfor example, when I think of a man, or a chimera, or the sky, or an\nangel, or God. Other thoughts have various additional forms: thus when\nI will, or am afraid, or affirm, or deny, there is always a particular\nthing which I take as the object of my thought, but my thought\nincludes something more than the likeness of that thing. Some thoughts\nin this category are called volitions or emotions, while others are\ncalled judgements. (AT VII 36\u20137; CSM II 25\u20136)\n\n\nIn this passage, ideas are cast as modes of thinking that represent\n(or present or exhibit) objects to the mind\u2014objects such as a\nman, or Pegasus, or the sky, or an angel, or God (and given what\nDescartes says in the First Meditation, among the list of things\nexhibited to the mind by way of its ideas, one could add colors,\nsounds, feels, and so on (AT VII 20; CSM II 13\u201314)). On\nDescartes\u2019 view, an idea is the only kind of (simple)\nmode that does this. When considering one of the more complex modes of\nthought\u2014for instance, fearing a lion or affirming the\nPythagorean Theorem, where the lion and the theorem are the objects\npresented\u2014it is the idea that is doing the presenting; it is the\nvehicle of representation. As Descartes will note in the Fourth\nMeditation, he takes there to be two basic faculties (capacities or\nabilities) of the mind: the intellect (or\nunderstanding) and the will. Ideas are\n\u201cproduced\u201d by the intellect. So, the idea of the\nPythagorean Theorem has its origin in the faculty of the intellect or\nunderstanding. The act of affirming, the other component of the more\ncomplex thought of affirming this theorem, has its origin in the\nfaculty of the will. Contributions from both faculties, then, give\nrise to the more complex kinds of thought.\n\nDescartes is careful to not identify ideas as pictures or as\nvisual images, but instead says that they are as it\nwere [tanquam] images of things. This is a long-standing\ntheme, for we find it expressed as early as The World (AT XI\n3\u20136; CSM I 81\u20132) and the Optics (AT VI\n112\u201313; CSM I 165), and as late as the Principles (AT\nVIIIA 32\u20133; CSM I 216\u201317) and Description of the Human\nBody (AT XI 255\u2013257; CSM I 322\u201323), where in these\ncontexts ideas are cast as representing their objects without\nnecessarily resembling them. This is important to the theory, since\nthe idea of cold or the idea of sweet, for example, insofar as they\nare ideas, represent something to the mind, but they are not\nvisual images. The point holds for other ideas, such as the\nidea of God, which Descartes explicitly lists in the above passage.\nThe idea of God represents something to the mind (it represents an\ninfinite substance), and in line with traditional theological\ndoctrine, supposing that God is non-spatial and non-temporal, the idea\ncannot be understood as being a visual image of God.\n\nConsistent with what he says in the above Third Meditation passage,\nDescartes says in other places that an idea is \u201cthe form of any\ngiven thought, immediate perception of which makes me aware of the\nthought\u201d (AT VII 160; CSM II 113). In his reply to Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131679), author of the Third Set of Objections, Descartes\nsays that an idea is \u201cwhatever is immediately perceived by the\nmind\u201d (AT VII 181; CSM II 127). In his reply to Pierre Gassendi\n(1592\u20131655), author of the Fifth Set of Objections, he says that\nthe term \u201cidea\u201d is extended \u201cto cover any object of\nthought\u201d (AT VII 366; CSM II 253). In a letter to Marin Mersenne\n(1588\u20131648), dated July 1641, he says that \u201cidea\u201d\ndenotes \u201cin general everything which is in our mind when we\nconceive something, no matter how we conceive it\u201d (AT III 393;\nCSMK III 185). Long-standing interpretations take such passages as\ntelling us that ideas have the special feature of\nintentionality\u2014they are directed at their respective\nobjects. It is in terms of this directedness that the mind is said to\nbe aware of an object.\n\nOne long-standing interpretation, the Representationalist\ninterpretation, says that for Descartes the objects immediately\npresented to the mind (by way of an idea) are purely mental\nobjects. This interpretation emphasizes Descartes\u2019 saying that\nsuch objects are solely in the intellect, as when he says to\nCaterus that the object of which the mind is immediately or directly\naware when having the idea of the Sun \u201c\u2026is not an actual\nentity, that is, it is not a being located outside the\nintellect\u2026\u201d (AT VII 103; CSM II 75) The object at which\nthe mind is directed, the immediate object of awareness, is\nnot the Sun itself, but is instead a purely mental object, which\nrepresents (or stands for) the Sun in the heavens. This purely mental\nobject is said to constitute the content of the idea. On this\nview, an idea is sometimes referred to as a tertium quid, a\nthird thing, which \u201cstands between\u201d the mind\u2019s eye,\nso to speak, and the object that the idea represents.\n\nAnother long-standing interpretation, the Direct Realist\ninterpretation, says that for Descartes the objects immediately\nrepresented or presented to the mind (by way of an idea) are not\nalways mental objects. (Nadler 1989) The idea of the Sun is understood\nas being a mental operation (a mode of the mind) directed at the Sun\nitself. In fact, on this interpretation, all ideas are, properly\nspeaking, to be understood as operations or acts of the mind. This\nholds even for the idea of Pegasus. The idea is a mental operation and\nin this case is directed at the mentally fabricated object, Pegasus.\nHere, Pegasus is a purely mental object. By contrast, the (sensory)\nidea of the Sun is directed at the Sun itself, the Sun in the heavens.\nThus, this interpretation allows ideas to be directed at mental and\nextra-mental objects. The import of this interpretation is that the\nimmediate objects of awareness need not be purely\nmental\u2014so, no tertium quid\u2014which differs\ndramatically from the Representationalist interpretation. Although\nboth readings have their merits, the remainder of this entry will work\nwithin the framework of the Representationalist reading.\n2. Ideas and The Formal-Objective Reality Distinction\n\nWhen speaking of an existent mode\u2014in this case, an\nactually occurring idea\u2014Descartes will say that it possesses\nformal reality. The formal reality of a thing is the kind of\nreality the thing possesses in virtue of its being an actual\nor an existent thing (AT VII 41\u201342, 102\u20134; CSM II\n28\u201329, 74\u20135). For example, given that the Sun is an actual\nor existent thing, it possesses formal reality. By contrast, given\nthat Pegasus is not an actual or existent thing, he does not possess\nformal reality. Given that the idea of the Sun or the\nidea of Pegasus are actual or existent ideas, where an idea\nis actual or existent when it is being actively thought by a mind,\neach would possess formal reality. \n\nDescartes took there to be three \u201clevels\u201d of formal\nreality: the level of infinite substance, the level of finite\nsubstance (as defined by its principal attribute), and the level of\nmode. The level of formal reality of an infinite substance is greater\nthan that of a finite substance, and the level of formal reality of a\nfinite substance is greater than that of a mode. This is understood in\nterms of ontological dependence. A mode depends for its formal reality\non the formal reality of a finite substance, and a finite substance\ndepends for its formal reality on the formal reality of an infinite\nsubstance. An existent idea, in possessing the level of formal reality\nof a mode, is less \u201creal\u201d than a finite substance, which\nis in line with what was said in the previous section of this entry.\n\n\nWhen speaking of ideas as representing things to the mind, Descartes\nwill refer to an idea\u2019s objective reality. The\nobjective reality of a thing is the kind of reality a thing possesses\nin virtue of its being a representation of something\n(ibid.). Given that the idea of the Sun and the idea of Pegasus\nrepresent things to the mind (they represent or exhibit the Sun and\nPegasus respectively), each possesses objective reality. Descartes\nsays that ideas possess objective reality by their very nature.\nEqually importantly, ideas are the only items in his ontology that\npossess both formal and objective reality. (AT VII 42; CSM II 29)\n\nAs with formal reality, there are three \u201clevels\u201d of\nobjective reality. Descartes says, \u201cUndoubtedly, the ideas which\nrepresent substances to me amount to something more and, so to speak,\ncontain within themselves more objective reality than the ideas which\nmerely represent modes or accidents\u201d (AT VII 40; CSM II 28).\nAnd, Descartes\u2019 Third Meditation examination of his idea of God\nreveals that the objective reality that it contains or possesses is\nthat associated with an infinite substance. At the very least, the\nview is that the idea of God contains a level of objective reality\nthat is greater than that contained in an idea representing a finite\nsubstance. Thus, the levels of objective reality possessed by ideas,\nthe reality they possess in virtue of their representing things to the\nmind, are (nominally) three: infinite substance, finite substance, and\nmode. The categories of the objective-reality hierarchy, then,\ncorrespond to those of the formal-reality hierarchy. \n\n\u201cThe nature of an idea,\u201d Descartes says, \u201cis such\nthat of itself it requires no formal reality except what it derives\nfrom my thought, of which it is a mode\u201d (AT VII 41; CSM II 28).\nIn fact, \u201cIn so far as the ideas are (considered) simply (as)\nmodes of thought, there is no recognizable inequality among them: they\nall appear to come from within me in the same fashion\u201d (AT VII\n40; CSM II 27\u20138). Each idea is simply a mode of thought, and\ninsofar as an idea is an existent (or actual) mode, it possesses a\nlevel of formal reality of that of a mode. He continues: \u201cBut in\nso far as different ideas (are considered as images which) represent\ndifferent things, it is clear that they differ widely\u201d (AT VII\n40; CSM II 28). The differences will not only be in terms of the\n\u201cobjects\u201d represented, but, as noted above, ideas will\ndiffer with respect to the levels of objective reality they contain\n(AT VII 40; CSM II 28).\n\nTo see the formal-objective reality distinction at work within the\ncontext of Descartes\u2019 theory, consider an idea that has been\nmentioned several times already\u2014the idea of God, as introduced\nin the Third Meditation. Descartes\u2019 analysis of this idea begins\nwith his focusing on the fact that the idea represents to him an\ninfinite substance (AT VII 45; CSM II 31). The formal-objective\nreality distinction suggests the following. When considered simply as\nan existent mode of Descartes\u2019 mind, which is to consider it in\nterms of its formal reality, Descartes sees no trouble in accounting\nfor the origin of the formal reality of this idea: the formal reality\npossessed by this idea is derived from the formal reality of his mind.\nIn other words, the existence of the idea, as mode, depends on the\nexistence of his mind. But when considered in terms of what this idea\nrepresents or presents to the mind, which is to consider the idea in\nterms of its objective reality, Descartes discovers a problem, which\ncan be formulated: what is the origin of the idea\u2019s objective\nreality? This challenge arises in light of Descartes\u2019\nsaying:\n\nNow it is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as\nmuch (reality) in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of\nthat cause. For where, I ask, could the effect get its reality from,\nif not from the cause? And how could the cause give it to the effect\nunless it possessed it? It follows from this both that something\ncannot arise from nothing, and also that what is more perfect \u2014\nthat is, contains in itself more reality \u2014 cannot arise from\nwhat is less perfect. And this is transparently true not only in the\ncase of effects which possess (what the philosophers call) actual or\nformal reality, but also in the case of ideas, where one is\nconsidering only (what they call) objective reality. A stone, for\nexample, which previously did not exist, cannot begin to exist unless\nit is produced by something which contains, either formally or\neminently everything to be found in the stone; similarly, heat cannot\nbe produced in an object which was not previously hot, except by\nsomething of at least the same order (degree or kind) of perfection as\nheat, and so on. But it is also true that the idea of heat,\nor of a stone, cannot exist in me unless it is put there by some cause\nwhich contains at least as much reality as I conceive to be in the\nheat or in the stone. For although this cause does not transfer any of\nits actual or formal reality to my idea, it should not on that account\nbe supposed that it must be less real. The nature of an idea is such\nthat of itself it requires no formal reality except what it derives\nfrom my thought, of which it is a mode. But in order for a given idea\nto contain such and such objective reality, it must surely derive it\nfrom some cause which contains at least as much formal reality as\nthere is objective reality in the idea. For if we suppose that an idea\ncontains something which was not in its cause, it must have got this\nfrom nothing; yet the mode of being by which a thing exists\nobjectively (or representatively) in the intellect by way of an idea,\nimperfect though it may be, is certainly not nothing, and so it cannot\ncome from nothing. (AT VII 40\u20131; CSM II 28\u20139)\n\n\nThe challenge in the examination of the idea of God is to account for\nthe origin of the idea\u2019s level of objective reality. He\ndetermines that the formal reality possessed by his own mind cannot be\nits origin. He concludes that there must be some being that in fact\npossesses the requisite level of formal reality, which in this case\nwill be greater than that of a finite substance. (For more, see the\nSEP entry on\n Descartes\u2019 epistemology.)\n Notice how this differs from what he says about the formal reality of\nan idea, namely, that his mind is the cause or origin of an\nidea\u2019s formal reality.\n\nThe examination of the idea of God follows almost directly upon the\nintroduction of the possible connection between the objective reality\nof some of his ideas and the formal reality of extra-ideational or\nextra-mental objects. Descartes\u2019 analysis of the idea of God\nsuggests a principle of representation, which is discussed in Section\n4 of this entry.\n\nThere is a second distinction that Descartes introduces worth noting,\nthe material-objective distinction. Some scholars believe\nthat it is simply an alternate way of expressing the formal-objective\nreality distinction. The material-objective distinction is never\nclearly formulated in the body of the Meditations, though\nDescartes employs it in his reply to Antione Arnauld\n(1612\u20131694), in the Fourth Set of Replies.\n\nDescartes introduces the material-objective distinction in the Preface\nTo the Reader of the Meditations (which was very likely\nwritten after the Meditations and the Objections and\nReplies). He says that the word \u201cidea\u201d is philosophically\nambiguous:\n\n\u201cIdea\u201d can be taken materially, as an operation of the\nintellect, in which case it cannot be said to be more perfect than me.\nAlternatively, it can be taken objectively, as the thing represented\nby that operation; and this thing, even if it is not regarded as\nexisting outside the intellect, can still, in virtue of its essence,\nbe more perfect than myself. (AT VII 8; CSM II 7)\n\n\nThe term \u201cidea\u201d can be used to refer to a specific kind of\nact or operation of the mind\u2014here, it is the act of\nrepresenting. In this sense, the idea is simply an existent\nmode of the mind. In light of the formal-objective reality\ndistinction, since the formal reality of an idea (a mode) is derived\nfrom the formal reality of the mind (its substance), it follows that\nits level of formal reality cannot be greater than that of the mind.\nThis is what Descartes means when claiming that his ideas, understood\nas operations of his mind, cannot be \u201cmore perfect\u201d than\nhis mind. When using \u201cidea\u201d to refer to an operation of\nthe mind, \u201cidea\u201d is expressing what he calls the\nmaterial sense. Sometimes he will say, as he does in the\nabove quoted passage, that when understanding an idea to be an\noperation of the mind that it is taken materially.\n\nAlternatively, the term \u201cidea\u201d can be used to refer to\nthat which is presented or exhibited directly to the mind by way of\nthe mental operation. When using \u201cidea\u201d to refer the\nobject exhibited directly to the mind, \u201cidea\u201d is\nexpressing what he calls the objective sense. Sometimes he\nwill say, as he does in the above quoted passage, that when\nunderstanding an idea as the object immediately presented to the mind\n(by way of a mental operation), the idea is taken\nobjectively. \n\nConsider again the idea of God. When taking this idea materially, the\nidea is understood as an operation of the mind. When taking this very\nsame idea objectively, the idea is understood as that which is\npresented directly to the mind by way of this operation. The nature of\nthe object presented, Descartes says, can be more perfect than his\nmind. So, even though he is not an infinite being, an idea can\nnevertheless present to him a being that is infinite, a being that\npossesses a greater level of reality than that possessed by a finite\nsubstance. Again, the emphasis is that such is possible only if the\ncause of the objective being possesses the requisite level of formal\nreality, which in this case, as just noted, must be greater than that\nof a finite substance.\n\nWhere the two distinctions may differ is with respect to how Descartes\nemploys them. When tracing out the origins of the formal and objective\nreality possessed by an idea, Descartes employs the formal-objective\nreality distinction. In some cases, as in the case of the idea of God,\nthe origin of the formal reality of the idea is his own mind, whereas\nthe origin of the objective reality is God (something that exists\nindependently of his mind). However, when Descartes is speaking about\nthe relation between an idea understood as a mental operation, and\nthis very same idea now understood as the object presented by way of\nthis operation, Descartes employs the material-objective distinction.\nThe difference is with respect to the number of relations in play in\nthe analysis. Consider again the idea of God. Concerning the\nformal-objective reality distinction, the number of relations is two:\nthe relation between the idea as mode and the mind, and the relation\nbetween the object presented in or by the idea and God. Concerning the\nmaterial-objective distinction, there is only one relation being\nconsidered: the relation between the idea as mental operation and this\nidea as object presented (via this operation).\n3. Three Kinds of Idea\n\nIn the Meditations, after Descartes casts ideas as modes that\nrepresent or exhibit objects to the mind, he divides ideas into kinds.\nHe says:\n\nAmong my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and\nothers to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing\nis, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my\nown nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or\nfeeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or\nso I have hitherto judged. Lastly, sirens, hippogriffs and the like\nare my own invention. (AT VII 37\u20138; CSM II 26)\n\n\nHere, Descartes considers three kinds of idea: innate ideas,\nadventitious ideas, and what are sometimes called\nfactitious ideas. The categories are determined by\nconsidering the possible origins of the ideational contents presented\nor exhibited to the mind. The first category includes ideas whose\ncontents have their origin in his nature (qua thinking\nthing). An example is his idea of what thought or thinking is. The\nthird category includes ideas whose contents have their origin in the\ncontents of other ideas. An example would be the idea of Pegasus,\nwhere its content is drawn perhaps from the contents of the idea of a\nhorse and the idea of a bird. Adventitious ideas, however, appear at\nleast at first glance to be importantly different, since Nature has\nalways taught him, he says, to think that they are \u201cderived from\nthings existing outside me\u201d (AT VII 38; CSM II 26). The category\narises in part from ordinary (pre-philosophical) experience:\n\u201c\u2026I know by experience that these ideas do not depend on\nmy will, and hence that they do not depend simply on me. Frequently I\nnotice them even when I do not want to: now, for example, I feel the\nheat whether I want to or not, and this is why I think that this\nsensation or idea of heat comes to me from something other than\nmyself, namely the heat of the fire by which I am sitting\u201d (AT\nVII 38; CSM II 26). An account of their origin, he suggests, may\nrequire an appeal to things that exist external to, or independently\nof, his mind. Adventitious ideas include sensory ideas; ideas that\noriginate in sensory experience\u2014such as the ideas of the Sun or\nthe Moon, but also the more simple ideas of colors, sounds, heat,\ncold, and the like.\n\nIn Descartes\u2019 analysis of his idea of God, he discovers that it\nis innate, since it is neither adventitious nor factitious. It is not\nadventitious (or sensory), since he has had no sensory experiences of\nGod (i.e., he has never seen, heard, felt, smelt, or tasted God). This\nwould be in line with the theological demand that God is immaterial.\nIt is not factitious, for its content is something that his mind\ncannot fabricate from other ideas\u2014the idea represents an actual\ninfinity; at best his mind can only produce the factitious idea of a\npotential infinity. (AT VII 46\u20137; CSM II 32) Even so, it becomes clear\nto him that the innate idea of God is like the adventitious idea of\nthe Sun, but unlike the innate idea of what thought is (which has its\norigin in his own nature), since like the adventitious idea of the\nSun, the objective reality possessed by the idea has its origin in the\nformal reality belonging to something other than his own mind. His\nanalysis concludes that the origin of the objective reality must be in\nan existing God (an actual infinite substance, something possessing an\ninfinite level of formal reality). In the Sixth Meditation, he will\nultimately conclude that the objective reality of his idea of body,\nalso innate, must have, like the innate idea of God, its origin in the\nformal reality belonging to something other than his own mind, namely,\nit will have its origin in an existing corporeal substance (an\nextended being that possesses a finite level of formal reality).\nUltimately, the objective reality (i.e., contents) of his innate ideas\nand adventitious ideas must have their origin in the formal reality of\nthings, some of the latter being things existing independently of his\nmind.\n\nThis is not the only place in Descartes\u2019 work where innate and\nadventitious ideas are cast as sharing the trait of having their\nrespective origins in things existing independently of his mind. For\ninstance, in Comments on a Certain Broadsheet, published in\n1648, Descartes casts innateness as a faculty (AT VIIIB 358;\nCSM I 304), which aligns with what he had said to Hobbes in the Third\nSet of Replies: \u201c\u2026when we say that an idea is innate in\nus, we do not mean that it is always there before us. This would mean\nthat no idea was innate. We simply mean that we have within ourselves\nthe faculty of summoning up the idea\u201d (AT VII 189; CSM II 132).\nScholars note that this may be different from the way in which innate\nideas were cast in the Third Meditation. But in the sense of\ninnate\u2013as\u2013faculty, in Comments on a Certain\nBroadsheet, Descartes goes on to say that there is a sense in\nwhich even sensory ideas (ideas of qualities such as pains, colors,\nsounds, and so on), ideas arising via the senses, which are a\nspecies of adventitious idea, are nevertheless innate. The argument\nunfolds as follows: Given that the human (or embodied) mind has the\nfaculty or capacity to have sensory ideas of pains, colors, sounds,\nand so on, where these are occasioned on the occurrence or presence of\ncertain motions in the brain, and nothing of the motions in the brain\nis transferred to the mind, and nothing resembling the pains, colors,\nand sounds is present in bodies (including the brain), then the ideas\nof pains, colors, and sounds (i.e., the ideas of those\nqualities) \u201cmust be all the more innate.\u201d (AT\nVIIIB 359; CSM I 304) \n\nOne interpretation that has relatively recently emerged addresses the\nconcern over the alleged similarity between innate and adventitious\nideas by emphasizing the role that innate ideas play (Nolan\n1997, Lennon 2007, Nelson 2008, De Rosa 2010). Consider, for example,\nthe adventitious or sensory idea of the Sun. This idea presents the\nSun to the mind as a shaped thing. An analysis of this idea reveals\nthat the innate idea of extension (body) is in play, for without it\nthe human mind simply could not experience (or even conceive) the Sun\nas shaped. Shape presupposes extension. As Descartes puts it\nin the Principles, everything \u201cwhich can be attributed\nto body presupposes extension, and is merely a mode of an extended\nthing,\u201d which, according to Descartes, is aligned with the view\nthat \u201c\u2026shape is unintelligible except in an extended\nthing\u2026\u201d (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210). In this sense, insofar\nas a shaped thing is made intelligible to a human mind, the innate\nidea of extension is involved. As some scholars have put it, the\ninnate idea underlies or informs the occurring idea of the Sun (Nolan\n1997, Nelson 2008, De Rosa 2010). This interpretation finds further\nsupport in what Descartes says in a letter to Princess Elisabeth,\ndated 21 May 1643, where Descartes introduces what he calls the\n\u201cprimitive notions.\u201d These are what in other contexts he\ncalls the innate ideas. In the letter, he claims that these ideas\nserve as \u201c\u2026the patterns on the basis of which we form all\nour other conceptions\u201d (AT III 665; CSMK III 218). So, it is the\nunique role of the innate ideas that distinguishes them from\nadventitious ideas, where their role is to serve as that which makes\nother things intelligible. \n\nScholars agree that Descartes recognizes at least three innate ideas:\nthe idea of God, the idea of (finite) mind, and the idea of\n(indefinite) body. In the letter to Elisabeth, he includes a fourth:\nthe idea of the union (of mind and body).\n\nThere is an alternate division of ideas worth noting. In the Third\nMeditation, after having introduced the tripartite division of innate,\nadventitious, and factitious ideas, Descartes continues to entertain\nthe possible origins of the contents of his ideas. His analysis turns\non the principle that an effect can never be greater than its cause,\nwhich is underwritten by the self-evident principle that something\ncannot come from nothing. He says: \u201cAnd although one idea may\nperhaps originate from another, there cannot be an infinite regress\nhere; eventually one must reach a primary idea, the cause of which\nwill be like an archetype which contains formally (and in fact) all\nthe reality (or perfection) which is present only objectively (or\nrepresentatively) in the idea.\u201d (AT VII 42; CSM II 29) Here,\nDescartes introduces the notion of a primary idea. The import\nof this notion is that the contents of some of his ideas may have\ntheir origin in things located \u201coutside\u201d his\nmind\u2014that is, in things that exist independently of his mind.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 analysis suggests that the contents of some of his\ninnate ideas and all of his adventitious ideas have their origin in\nthings existing independently of his mind. Such ideas are included in\nthe category of Primary Idea. The innate idea of God is a primary\nidea, since the objective reality it possesses has its origin the \nformal reality of God. Likewise, the innate idea of body is a primary\nidea, since the objective reality it possesses has its origin in the\nformal reality of body. And, as just noted, the adventitious idea of\nthe Sun is a primary idea, since the objective reality it possesses\nhas its origin the formal reality of the Sun. Factitious ideas,\nwhose contents have their origin in the contents of other ideas, no\ndoubt fall into the category of Non-Primary idea. A\nnon-primary idea is one whose objective reality has its origin in the\nobjective reality of some other idea. The factitious idea of Pegasus\nis an example of a non-primary idea. \n\nThis alternate scheme (Primary and Non-Primary), although partitioning\nideas differently than the initial scheme (Innate, Adventitious, and\nFactitious), appears to do no philosophical harm to Descartes\u2019\nview. Even so, it is interesting the extent to which Descartes\u2019\ncategory of primary idea is later echoed in the views of John Locke\nand David Hume, whose respective theories require a similar category,\nwhich they refer to as simple idea. \n4. Primary Ideas and a Principle of Representation\n\nSome scholars believe that in Descartes\u2019 brief discussion of\nprimary ideas there is suggested a principle of representation (Wilson\n1978, Clatterbaugh 1980, Chappell 1986, Smith 2005a, 2010a). The\nprinciple is notoriously difficult to formulate, and there is no\nconsensus among scholars as to how it is best understood. However, a\nlarge number of scholars agree on one component of the principle,\nwhich can be expressed as a necessary (though not a sufficient)\ncondition for representation. This principle of representation\n(PR) can be expressed as follows:\n\n(PR) Primary idea A represents object B only if the objective\nreality of idea A has its origin in the formal reality of object B.\n\n\nPR is at work in Descartes\u2019 analyses of all primary\nideas, which includes all innate and adventitious ideas. The innate\nidea of his (i.e., Descartes\u2019) mind is said to be of or\nto represent his mind insofar as the idea\u2019s objective\nreality has its origin in the formal reality of his mind. The innate\nidea of God is said to represent God insofar as the idea\u2019s\nobjective reality has its origin in the formal reality of God (an\ninfinite substance). The innate idea of a body is said to represent a\nbody insofar as the idea\u2019s objective reality has its origin in\nthe formal reality of a corporeal substance. The adventitious idea of\nthe Sun is said to represent the Sun insofar as the idea\u2019s\nobjective reality has its origin in the formal reality of the Sun. And\nthe list could go on. \n\nThe following analogy may be instructive. Suppose that Socrates stands\nbefore a mirror. Both Socrates and the mirror are actual things, so\nboth, using Descartes\u2019 terminology, would possess formal\nreality. Each can presumably exist independently of the other. The\nimage of Socrates arises as a relation between Socrates and\nthe mirror. It cannot exist independently of Socrates or the mirror.\nDestroy Socrates or the mirror, and this image of Socrates is\ndestroyed. Using Descartes\u2019 terminology, the image is\nan objective being insofar as it is a representation of\nSocrates. Although the image represents Socrates, it is nevertheless\n\u201clocated\u201d on the mirror\u2019s surface. And, since the\nsurface is a mode of the mirror, there is a sense in which this image\nwould be too. The mirror is the bearer of the image. This is a sense\nin which the image \u201cbelongs to\u201d the mirror. The\nrelationship to Socrates is different. The image is said to be an\nimage of Socrates. The image is about him. He is not\nthe bearer of the image, but is what this image represents.\nSo, the relation that Socrates has to this image must be importantly\ndifferent from the relation that the mirror has to this image.\nEmploying Descartes\u2019 terminology, and in light of PR, the\nimage is of Socrates insofar as this objective being (the\nimage) has its origin in the formal reality of Socrates. To be sure,\nthe image derives its existence, or its formal reality, from the\nformal reality of the mirror, but its objective being has its origin\nnot in the mirror but in Socrates. \n5. The Rules: Simple Natures and the Concepts of Clarity and Distinctness\n\nIt is in the Rules that Descartes introduces the simple\nnatures. The simple natures are not only what our ideas are\nof\u2014that is, they not only constitute the contents of\nour ideas, the \u201cobjects\u201d immediately presented to the\nmind\u2014but are also the natures possessed by things. (AT X 399;\nCSM I 32) Examples of simple natures are colors, sounds, smells,\nshapes, sizes, extension, and the like. He says, for example, in Rule\nTwelve, \u201cif I judge that a certain shape is not moving, I shall\nsay that my thought is in some way composed of shape and rest; and\nsimilarly in other cases.\u201d (AT X 420; CSM I 45) In the First\nMeditation, Descartes mentions similar ideational elements \u201cfrom\nwhich all the images of things\u201d are formed. (AT VII 20; CSM II\n13\u201314) In the Second Meditation, in his analysis of the adventitious\nidea of a piece of wax, Descartes again provides a list of such\nideational elements. (AT VII 30\u201332; CSM II 20\u201321) In the Third\nMeditation, he refers to such items as \u201celements in my\nideas.\u201d (AT VII 44; CSM II 30) And, in the Sixth Meditation,\nwhen revisiting some of what he had established in the Second\nMeditation, talk of these qualities that are \u201cthe only immediate\nobjects of my sensory awareness\u201d is again introduced. (AT VII\n75ff; CSM II 52ff) So, although Descartes does not employ the\n\u201csimple natures\u201d terminology in later work, the\nphilosophical notion certainly looks to be present in his later work.\n\n\nSimple natures form an ordered, hierarchical system. Upon analysis\nthey appear to be sorted into two basic groups or classes, which not\nsurprisingly corresponds to Descartes\u2019 mind-body dualism. (AT X\n399; CSM I 32) Descartes refers to this partition of simple natures as\nthe enumeration. The basic classes of this enumeration will\nalso be partitioned. In light of this, this ultimate\nenumeration\u2014the partition of the simple natures into the classes\nof thinking and extended things\u2014can be referred to as the\nmaster enumeration. As laid out in the Rules, the\nhierarchy is not understood in terms of the ontology, but in terms of\nwhat must be known in terms of what. (AT X 381; CSM I 21) These groups\nor classes are formed in light of epistemic priority. One group\nincludes those simple natures that presuppose the simple nature\nthought or thinking, while the other group includes\nthose simple natures that presuppose the simple nature\nextension. The view is that the simple nature shape,\nfor instance, presupposes the simple nature extension in that\nthe former is known (understood) on the basis of the latter. As\nDescartes puts it later in the Principles, \u201cshape is\nunintelligible except in an extended thing.\u201d (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I\n210) No extension, no shape. The same holds for the other class. The\nsimple nature hot, a sensible quality, presupposes the simple\nnature thought or thinking in that the former is\nknown (or understood) on the basis of the latter. No thought or\nthinking, no (feeling of) hotness. \n\nDescartes recognizes two forms of conjunction found among the\nsimple natures: necessary and contingent conjunction. (AT X 421f; CSM\nI 45f) Two simple natures are said to be necessarily conjoined\nwhenever one presupposes (entails) the other. (Ibid.) So, for\ninstance, the simple nature shape is necessarily conjoined\nwith the simple nature extension insofar as the former\npresupposes (or entails) the latter. An idea is said to be\nclear whenever the necessary conjunction between simple\nnatures in the idea is exhibited or made explicit. Descartes\u2019\nprocedure for making an idea \u201cclearer\u201d is to compare the\nsimple natures in the idea. He writes that the procedure: \n\n\u2026is carried over from one subject to another solely by means of\ncomparison, which enables us to state that the thing we are seeking is\nin this or that respect similar to, or identical with, or equal to,\nsome given thing. Accordingly, in all reasoning it is only by means of\ncomparison that we attain an exact knowledge of the truth. (AT X 439;\nCSM I 57)\n\n\nHe goes on to say that \u201cUnity is the common nature which, we\nsaid above, all things which we are comparing must participate in\nequally.\u201d (AT X 449; CSM I 63 See also AT X 440f; CSM I 57f) The\nsimple natures shape and size share in common their\npresupposing the simple nature extension. Extension is the\ncommon nature; it unites such natures into a single thing (a\nbody). Thought or thinking is the common nature that unites the other\nsimple natures into a single thing (a mind). An idea is said\nto be obscure, then, whenever no necessary conjunction (the\n\u201cpresupposes\u201d relation) is exhibited or made explicit in\nan idea.\n\nIdeas are said to be confused whenever they include or\ncontain simple natures belonging to the two mutually exclusive classes\nof simple nature (the two classes together forming the enumeration).\nHere, the Latin confusio means mixed together. The\nadventitious idea of the Sun is an example of a confused idea. In\npresenting the Sun as circular-shaped and hot, the idea includes\nsimple natures that belong to the two mutually exclusive classes.\nShape belongs to the class whose members presuppose the\nsimple nature extension, whereas heat (a quality)\nbelongs to the class whose members presupposes the simple nature\nthought or thinking. An idea is said to be\ndistinct, then, whenever it includes or contains only simple\nnatures belonging to one of the mutually exclusive classes. The\nastronomical idea of the Sun, as introduced in the Third Meditation,\nlooks to be an example of a distinct idea. It includes only those\nsimple natures belonging to the class whose members presuppose the\nsimple nature extension. (Smith 2010, 2015)\n\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes introduces what scholars refer to\nas \u201cthe truth rule\u201d: Whatever one perceives clearly and\ndistinctly is true. (AT VII 35; CSM II 24) In the Fifth Meditation, in\nhis analysis of the clear and distinct idea of a triangle, Descartes\nargues that since \u201cwhatever is true is something (i.e.,\nreal)\u201d (AT VII 65; CSM II 45), it follows that\n\u201ceverything which I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to\nthat thing (the triangle) really does belong to it\u2026\u201d (AT\nVII 65; CSM II 45) As others have argued (Wahl 1995, Lennon 2007,\nSmith 2010a, Smith 2015), for Descartes, to say that something was\n\u201creal\u201d was in part to say that it existed independently of\na finite mind. This is the import of Descartes\u2019 proving the\nexistence of God and body. They are real things. In his analysis of\nthe idea of the triangle, Descartes concludes that the natures that he\nclearly and distinctly perceives the triangle as possessing are in\nfact possessed by the triangle. These natures are\nreal. \n\nRussell Wahl has argued that for Descartes truth was related\ndirectly to natures. (Wahl 1995) What is true, he says,\n\u201cis the object before the mind and not the idea\u2014not the\noperation of the mind, but what is perceived.\u201d (Wahl 1995, p.\n188) In other words, truth is not related to the idea taken\nmaterially, but to the idea taken objectively. This, he says, is no\ndoubt related to Descartes\u2019 claim that whatever is true is\nsomething (real). (AT VII 65; CSM II 45) The import of this view is\nthat the simple natures, which constitute the contents of ideas, are\nalso the very same natures possessed by things\u2014at least when the\nidea is clear and distinct. Here, the simple natures look to be\nserving as an ontological bridge, so to speak, between the mind and\nextra-mental reality. Wahl\u2019s reading is controversial, but worth\nnoting, since the potentiality lurks in its being able to bring closer\ntogether the Representationalist and Direct Realist readings.\n\nA relatively recent suggestion, which emerged in part as a response to\nthe conflict between the Representationalist and Direct Realist\ninterpretations, comes from Paul Hoffman. (Hoffman 2002) He bases his\nsuggestion on a view held by Aquinas. Given that simple natures are\nthe ontological elements of ideas and things, Hoffman in essence\nargues that it is the simple natures themselves that possess the two\nkinds of reality that Descartes had introduced in the Third\nMeditation, namely, formal and objective reality. (Hoffman 2002)\nConsider the adventitious idea of the Sun. As noted earlier, this idea\nis obscure and confused. Even so, it reportedly represents the Sun in\nthe heavens. Descartes makes clear in the Third Meditation that the\nastronomical idea of the Sun better \u201cresembles\u201d the object\nreportedly in the heavens than does the adventitious idea. One way\nthis may be the case is that the astronomical idea is clear and\ndistinct in that it includes only those simple natures that presuppose\nextension, such as shape, size,\nmotion, and so on (distinct), and it exhibits the\npresupposition relation (clear). The Sun is a body whose nature is\nextension (in length, breadth, and depth). \n\n\u201cThe sun as it exists objectively,\u201d says Hoffman,\n\u201cis able to represent the sun as it exists formally in the\nheavens precisely because it is the same thing that has these two\nmodes of existence.\u201d (Hoffman 2002, p. 168) That is, the Sun\npossesses both formal and objective reality, or rather, the simple\nnatures that constitute the thing referred by the words \u201cthe\nSun\u201d possess both formal and objective reality. Hoffman\u2019s\nsuggestion is that it is the objective reality possessed by\nthe simple natures that the mind \u201cengages\u201d when perceiving\nthe Sun. It is via the Sun\u2019s objective being that the mind has\n\u201caccess to\u201d the Sun in the heavens. This suggestion would\nseem to straddle both the Representationalist and Direct Realist\ninterpretations, though, as Hoffman himself characterizes his view,\nhis suggestion leans in the direction of the Direct Realist\ninterpretation. \n\nThat said, there is trouble lurking in Hoffman\u2019s suggestion.\nDescartes very clearly says that ideas are the items in his\nontology that possess objective reality, and they possess it by their\nvery nature. (AT VII 42; CSM II 29) If the Sun, for instance, or any\nof the simple natures that constitute the Sun, are the items that\npossess objective reality, then the Sun or the simple natures that\nconstitute it are ideas. But the Sun, or the simple natures\nthat constitute it, also presumably possess formal reality, which is\nthe kind of reality a thing possesses insofar as it is a real or\nactual thing. If by \u201creal\u201d Descartes in part means\nexists independently of a finite mind, as Wahl and Lennon\ncontend, then the Sun, or the simple natures that constitute it,\ninsofar as they possess formal reality, exist independently of the\nfinite mind. This would entail that ideas can and do exist\nindependently of the finite mind. But this runs counter to\nDescartes\u2019 ontology. For further examination of the\nRepresentationalist and Direct Realist interpretations, which includes\na critical look at Hoffman\u2019s suggestion, see (Smith 2010a). \n",
