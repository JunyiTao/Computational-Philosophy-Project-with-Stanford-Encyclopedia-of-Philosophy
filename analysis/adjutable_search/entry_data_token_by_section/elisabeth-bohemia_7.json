    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes || The Passions and Moral Philosophy\n4.4 The Passions and Moral Philosophy\n\nIn his letters to Elisabeth of 1645 and 1646, Descartes develops his\nmoral philosophy, and in particular, his account of virtue as being\nresolved to do that which we judge to be the best. His letters begin\nas an effort to address a persistent illness of Elisabeth, which\nDescartes diagnoses as the manifestation of a sadness, no doubt due to\nthe events of the English Civil War. As Elisabeth herself puts it, he\n\u201chas the kindness to want to cure [her] body with [her]\nsoul\u201d (AT 4:208, 24 May 1645). While they begin by reading\nSeneca\u2019s De Vita Beata, they both agree that the work is not\nsufficiently systematic, and discussion turns to Descartes\u2019s own\nviews. Once again, Elisabeth, in her letters, plays a principally\ncritical role.\n\nHer criticisms of Descartes intertwine three distinct philosophical\npositions. First, she takes up the position of Aristotelian virtue\nethics, in objecting that Descartes\u2019s very liberal account of virtue,\nwhich requires only the intention to do good, does not require that\none\u2019s good intentions are realized in actions that are actually good.\nThat is, she notes that Descartes makes virtue impervious to fortune\nor moral luck. She, however, goes beyond the canonical Aristotelian\nposition to maintain that even our ability to reason is subject to\nluck. (This position helps to illuminate her view on the nature of the\nhuman mind. See the discussion in section 3.2 above.) Elisabeth also\ntakes up a classically Stoic position, insofar as she objects to the\nway in which Descartes\u2019s account of virtue separates virtue from\ncontentment. She objects that Descartes\u2019s account of virtue allows for\nthe virtuous agent to make mistakes, and she does not see how an agent\ncan avoid regret in the face of those mistakes. Insofar we regret when\neven our best intentions go awry, we can be virtuous and fail to be\ncontent. While it is unclear whether her objection is a psychological\none or a normative one, she does maintain that achieving contentment\nrequires an \u2018infinite science\u2019 (4:289) so that we might\nknow all of the impact of our actions, and so properly evaluate them.\nWithout a faculty of reason that is already perfected, on her view,\nnot only will we not be able to achieve virtue, we also will not rest\ncontent. (See Shapiro 2012 for an interpretation of these remarks.\nPerler (2021) situates this discussion within a contemporary framework\nof internalism and externalism and argues that Elisabeth replaces\nDescartes\u2019 internalist conception of happiness with a more\ncomplex conception that takes both internal and external factors into\naccount.) On her view, not only the right use of our rational\nfaculties but also the right conditions for using them are required\nfor obtaining happiness.\n\nIn the context of this exchange, in the same letter of 13 September\n1645, Elisabeth asks Descartes to \u201cdefine the passions, in order\nto know them better\u201d (AT 4: 289). It is this request that leads\nDescartes to draft a treatise on the passions, on which Elisabeth\ncomments in her letter of 25 April 1646, and which is ultimately\npublished in 1649 as The Passions of the Soul. Elisabeth\u2019s\nconcerns about our ability to properly evaluate our actions lead her\nto express a further concern, this time about the possibility of\nmeasuring value objectively, given that we each have personal biases,\nwhether by temperament or by matters of self-interest. Without a\nproper measure of value, she implies, Descartes\u2019s account of virtue\ncannot even get off the ground, for it is not clear what should\nconstitute our best judgement of what is the best course of action.\nBehind Elisabeth\u2019s objection here is a view of ethics akin to that of\nHobbes and other contractarians, \nwhich takes the good to be a matter\nof balancing of competing self-interests.\n\nIn his letter of 15 September 1645 Descartes aims to answer some of\nher concerns by outlining a set of metaphysical truths knowledge of\nwhich will suffice in guiding our practical judgements, including that\nall things depend on God (who exists), the nature of the human mind\nand its immortality, and the vast extent of the universe (15 September\n1645; AT 4:292). Elisabeth responds by asserting that these\nconsiderations just open more problems\u2014of explaining human free\nwill, of how understanding the immortality of the soul can make us\nseek death, and of distinguishing particular providence from the idea\nof God\u2014without providing any guidance for evaluating things\nproperly. (See Schmaltz 2019 and Reuter 2021 for interpretations of\nElisabeth\u2019s view on free will and divine providence.)\n",
