    "main_text": "Paradoxes: between metamathematics and type-free foundations (1930\u20131945) || Paradoxes and the foundations of semantics\n5.2 Paradoxes and the foundations of semantics\n\nIt is evident from the work done in the twenties surveyed above that\nthe problem of finding a formal solution to the semantical paradoxes,\nsuch as the Liar and the Richard paradox, remained essentially open.\nType-theoretic solutions had not been pursued to the extent of\nproviding a systematic formal analysis of semantical notions (like\ntruth or definability). But why would this problem be worth studying\nfrom a logical and mathematical point of view? As a matter of fact,\nsemantical notions\u2014in particular the notion of\ndefinability\u2014were more or less explicitly used in certain parts\nof set theory (descriptive set theory) and in more \u201cset\ntheoretically inclined\u201d parts of function theory, which were\ncultivated by Polish mathematics in the twenties. At the same time,\nthe project of a formal methodology and of a scientific semantics was\ndeveloped by prominent Polish philosophers and logicians working in\nLvov (now Lviv) and Warsaw (Lesniewski, \u0141ukasiewicz, Chwistek;\nsee Wolenski 1995 and the entries on\n Lesniewski,\n on\n \u0141ukasiewicz\n and on the\n Lvov-Warsaw school).\n For instance, Chwistek attempted an elementary semantics on the\nground of a nominalistic foundational program, where sets are\nidentified with propositional functions, extensionality is rejected\nand the fundamental notion of semantics is the substitution relation\n\u201c\\(H\\) is the result of the substitution of \\(G\\) for \\(F\\) in\n\\(E\\)\u201d (Chwistek 1933, p. 374). In this stimulating environment,\nTarski developed his fundamental analysis of semantical paradoxes,\nfirst dating back to 1929 and 1930, reported by \u0141ukasiewicz to\nthe Polish Society of Sciences in Warsaw in 1931 and then detailed in\nthe long memoir of 1935 (see the entries on\n Tarski\n and on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definition).\n\nFirst of all, the analysis of the Liar paradox starts out by\nspecifying a formal requirement to be met in the semantical\ninvestigation of truth, i.e. \u201ca materially adequate\n(sachlich zutreffende) definition\u201d of the term\n\u201ctrue sentence \u201d (wahre Aussage). This amounts to\nthe celebrated schema (T), which can be roughly stated in simplified\nform as: \n\n\\[\\tag{T} x \\text{ is a true sentence if and only if } p. \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p\\) stands for a sentence and \\(x\\) is a name of \\(p\\) (the\nidea being in accord to the classical correspondence intuition). The\nresult that Tarski draws from the Liar is that there cannot be any\ninterpreted language which is free from contradictions, obeys the\nclassical laws of logic, and meets the requirements (I)\u2013(III),\nwhere\n\nthe language has names available for all of its sentences;\nany expression obtained from (T) by substituting \\(p\\) with an\narbitrary sentence of the language and \\(x\\) with a corresponding name\nof \\(p\\) is accepted as true in the language;\nthere exist self-referential sentences, i.e., it is legitimate\nthat a sentence comprises its own name as constituent (so that we can\nlegitimately stipulate that the name \\(c\\) denotes a sentence\n\\(\\alpha(\\ldots c\\ldots))\\).\n\n\nGiven these essential obstacles, Tarski provides a structural\ndefinition of the basic semantical notions, i.e., one that relies\nonly on the logical form of an expression and the fact that\nexpressions are recursively defined. But this route is only viable for\na language which is structurally described, e.g., a formalized\nlanguage. For such languages, which are usually closed under\nquantification and contain formulas with free variables, Tarski\nelaborates an appropriate notion of satisfaction, which\nallows him to introduce the notions of definability, denotation,\ntruth, logical consequence. It is then possible to give a precise\nversion and a proof of the adequacy condition (T) in a meta-science,\nwhose principles comprise: (i) general logical axioms, (ii) special\naxioms that depend upon the object theory we consider, and (iii)\naxioms for dealing with the fundamental properties of the structural\nnotions, i.e., principles of proof and definition by\ninduction. Given this semantical machinery, Tarski can solve in\nthe negative the problem of the existence of (a formal counterpart of)\na universal language, i.e., one where it is possible to\ndefine an adequate notion of truth for the same language. Although the\ntheory of simple types, (where the type 0 is the type of individuals;\nthe type \\(n+1\\) is the collection of all classes of type \\(n\\)\nobjects) with the axiom of infinity and extensionality is apparently a\ngood candidate as a general metatheory, it is shown that whichever\ndefinition we choose in the theory of types for the term\n\u201ctrue\u201d, then it is possible to deduce in the same theory\nthe negation of some instance of the adequacy schema (T). In the proof\nof this theorem, Tarski applies arithmetization and diagonalization,\nhence following the G\u00f6delian pattern. On the positive side, the\nconcept of truth can be adequately defined for any formalized language\nL in a language (the so-called metalanguage), provided it is of higher\norder than L. Also, Tarski\u2019s semantics makes precise\nG\u00f6del\u2019s remark (1931, footnote 48) that \u201cthe true\nreason of the incompleteness is that the formation of ever higher\ntypes can be continued into the transfinite[\u2026], while in any\nformal system at most denumerably many of them are available\u201d.\nTarskian semantical notions play the role of the higher types hinted\nat by G\u00f6del. To sum up, the outcome of Tarski\u2019s work is\nthat the semantical notions are eliminated in favor of the\n(extensional) notions of type or set, and a theoretical explanation of\nsemantical paradoxes is finally achieved.\n",
