And S3 is guaranteed to be true by the setup of the problem.\nThe main issue then is whether S2 is true. As Hudson notes, there\nappear to be some clear counterexamples to it. The fusion of a cloud\nwith one of the water droplets in my bathtub is clearly not a cloud,\nbut by most standards it differs minutely from a cloud, since there is\nonly one droplet of water difference between them.\n",
