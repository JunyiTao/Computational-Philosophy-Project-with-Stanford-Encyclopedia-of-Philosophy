    "main_text": "The science of happiness || The sources of happiness\n3.3 The sources of happiness\n\nThe question of mistakes will be taken up in section 5.2. But the last\nclaim\u2014that material prosperity has relatively modest impacts on\nhappiness\u2014has lately become the subject of heated debate. For\nsome time the standard view among subjective well-being researchers\nwas that, beyond a low threshold where basic needs are met, economic\ngains have only a small impact on happiness levels. According to the\nwell-known \u201cEasterlin Paradox,\u201d for instance, wealthier\npeople do tend to be happier within nations, but richer nations are\nlittle happier than less prosperous counterparts, and\u2014most\nstrikingly\u2014economic growth has virtually no impact (Easterlin\n1974). In the U.S., for example, measured happiness has not increased\nsignificantly since at least 1947, despite massive increases in wealth\nand income. In short, once you\u2019re out of poverty, absolute\nlevels of wealth and income make little difference in how happy people\nare.\n\nAgainst these claims, some authors have argued that absolute income\nhas a large impact on happiness across the income spectrum (e.g.,\nStevenson and Wolfers 2008). The question continues to be much\ndebated, but in 2010 a pair of large-scale studies using Gallup data\nsets, including improved measures of life satisfaction and affect,\nsuggested that both sides may be partly right (Kahneman and Deaton\n2010; Diener, Ng et al. 2010). Surveying large numbers of\nAmericans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally\nrepresentative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found\nthat income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global\nsample), at all levels, with life satisfaction\u2014strictly\nspeaking, a \u201clife evaluation\u201d measure that asks\nrespondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are\nsatisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect\nmeasures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, \u2013.09\nfor negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above\n$75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). For more recent\ndiscussions of empirical work, see Jebb et al. 2018 along with\nrelevant chapters in Diener et al. 2018 and the annual World Happiness\nReports from 2012 onward (Helliwell et al. 2012). Research on the\ncomplex money-happiness relationship resists simple characterization,\nbut a crude summary is that the connection tends to be positive and\nsubstantial, strong at lower income levels while modest to weak or\neven negative at higher incomes, and stronger and less prone to\nsatiation for life evaluation than emotional well-being metrics. But again, these are very rough generalizations that gloss over a variety of important factors and admit of many exceptions across both individuals and societies.\n\nIn short, the relationship between money and happiness may depend on\nwhich theory of happiness we accept: on a life satisfaction view, the\nrelationship may be strong; whereas affect-based views may yield a\nmuch weaker connection, again above some modest threshold. Here,\nagain, philosophical views about the nature and significance of\nhappiness may play an important role in understanding empirical\nresults and their practical upshot. Economic growth, for instance, has\nlong been a top priority for governments, and findings about its\nimpact on human well-being may have substantial implications for\npolicy.\n\nIt is important to note that studies of this nature focus on generic\ntrends, not specific cases, and there is no dispute that significant\nexceptions exist\u2014notably, populations that enjoy high levels of\nhappiness amid low levels of material prosperity. Among others, a\nnumber of Latin American countries, Maasai herders, Inughuit\nhunter-gatherers, and Amish communities have registered highly\npositive results in subjective well-being studies, sometimes higher\nthan those in many affluent nations, and numerous informal accounts\naccord with the\n data.[20]\n Such \u201cpositive outliers\u201d suggest that some societies can\nsupport high levels of happiness with extremely modest material\nholdings. The importance of money for happiness may depend strongly on\nwhat kind of society one inhabits. An interesting question,\nparticularly in light of common environmental concerns, is how far the\nlessons of such societies can, or should, be transferred to other\nsocial forms, where material attainment and happiness are presently\nmore tightly coupled. Perhaps some degree of decoupling of happiness\nand money would be desirable.\n\nSo the role of money in happiness appears, at this juncture, to be a\nmixed bag, depending heavily on how we conceive of happiness and what\nrange of societies we are considering. What (else), then, does matter\nmost for happiness? There is no definitive list of the main sources of\nhappiness in the literature, partly because it is not clear how to\ndivide them up. But the following items seem generally to be accepted\nas among the chief correlates of happiness: supportive relationships, engagement\nin interesting and challenging activities, material and physical\nsecurity, a sense of meaning or purpose, a positive outlook, and\nautonomy or\n control.[21]\n Significant correlates may also include\u2014among many\nothers\u2014religion, good governance, trust, helping others, values\n(e.g., having non-materialistic values), achieving goals, not being\nunemployed, and connection with the natural\n environment.[22]\n\nAn illustrative study of the correlates of happiness from a global\nperspective is the Gallup World Poll study noted earlier (Diener, Ng\net al. 2010; see also Jebb et al. 2020). In that study, the\nlife satisfaction measure was more strongly related to material\nprosperity, as noted above: household income, along with possession of\nluxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living. The\naffect measures, by contrast, correlated most strongly with what the\nauthors call \u201cpsychosocial prosperity\u201d: whether people\nreported being treated with respect in the last day, having family and\nfriends to count on, learning something new, doing what they do best,\nand choosing how their time was spent.\n\nWhat these results show depends partly on the reliability of the\nmeasures. One possible source of error is that this study might\nexaggerate the relationship between life satisfaction and material\nattainments through the use of a \u201cladder\u201d scale for life\nevaluation, ladders being associated with material aspirations. Errors\nmight also arise through salience biases whereby material concerns\nmight be more easily recalled than other important values, such as\nwhether one has succeeded in having children; or through differences\nin positivity biases across income levels (perhaps wealthier people\ntend to be more \u201cpositive-responding\u201d than poorer\nindividuals). Another question is whether the affect measures\nadequately track the various dimensions of people\u2019s emotional\nlives. However, the results are roughly consonant with other research,\nso they are unlikely to be entirely an artifact of the instruments\nused in this\n study.[23]\n A further point of uncertainty is the causal story behind the\ncorrelations\u2014whether the correlates, like psychosocial\nprosperity, cause happiness; whether happiness causes them; whether\nother factors cause both; or, as is likely, some combination of the\nthree.\n\nSuch concerns duly noted, the research plausibly suggests that, on\naverage, material progress has some tendency to help people to better\nget what they want in life, as found in the life satisfaction\nmeasures, while relationships and engaging activities are more\nimportant for people\u2019s emotional lives. What this means for\nhappiness depends on which view of happiness is correct.\n",
