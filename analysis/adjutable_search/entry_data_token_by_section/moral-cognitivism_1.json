    "main_text": "A More Detailed General Description || Cognitivism\n1.2 Cognitivism\n\nCognitivism is perhaps best defined as the denial of non-cognitivism.\nCognitivists think that moral sentences are apt for truth or falsity,\nand that the state of mind of accepting a moral judgment is typically\none of belief. They think that typical utterances of indicative\nsentences containing moral predicates express beliefs in the same way\nthat other sentences with ordinary descriptive predicates typically\ndo. (There is some reason to be careful here since cognitivists may\nnot need to employ the sense of \u2018express\u2019 that\nexpressivists need to get their theory off the ground. See Schroeder\n2008a.) Different species of cognitivist disagree about the contents\nof moral sentences and beliefs, about their truth conditions, and\nabout their truth. To discuss all the varieties would require a\ncomplete taxonomy of possible metaethical positions. What they have in\ncommon, however, is that they all deny that an adequate account of\nmoral judgments can be given consistent with the two negative\nnon-cognitivist theses.\n",
