    "main_text": "The Intuitive Distinction\n1. The Intuitive Distinction\n\nCompare the following two sets of sentences:\n\nI.\n\n\n(1)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are rich.\n(2)\nAll pediatricians are rich.\n(3)\nEveryone who runs damages their bodies.\n(4)\nIf Holmes killed Sikes, then Watson must be dead.\n \n\n\nII.\n\n\n(5)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are doctors.\n(6)\nAll pediatricians are doctors.\n(7)\nEveryone who runs moves.\n(8)\nIf Holmes killed Sikes, then Sikes must be dead.\n \n\n\nMost competent English speakers who know the meanings of all the\nconstituent words would find an obvious difference between the two\nsets: whereas they might wonder about the truth or falsity of those of\nset I, they would find themselves pretty quickly incapable of doubting\nthose of II. Unlike the former, these latter seem to be justifiable\nautomatically, \u201cjust by knowing what the words mean,\u201d as\nmany might spontaneously put it. Indeed, denials of any of them,\ne.g.,\n\nIII.\n\n\n(9)\n#Not all pediatricians are doctors \u2013 some aren\u2019t\nat all!\n(10)\n#Not everyone who runs moves \u2013 some remain completely\nstill!\n \n\n\nwould seem to be in some important way unintelligible, very\nlike contradictions in terms (the \u201c#\u201d indicates semantic\nanomaly). Philosophers standardly refer to sentences of the first set\nas \u201csynthetic,\u201d those of the second as (at least\napparently) \u201canalytic.\u201d (Members of set III. are sometimes\nsaid to be \u201canalytically false,\u201d although this term is\nrarely used, and \u201canalytic\u201d is standardly confined to\nsentences that are regarded as true.) We might call sentences such as\n(5)-(10) part of the \u201canalytic data\u201d to which philosophers\nand linguists have often appealed in invoking the distinction (without\nprejudice, however, to whether such data might otherwise be\nexplained). Some philosophers might want to include in set III. what\nare called category mistakes (q.v.) such as #The number\nthree likes Tabasco sauce, or #Saturday is in bed (cf.,\nRyle, 1949 [2009]), but these have figured less prominently in recent\ndiscussions, being treated not as semantically anomalous, but as\nsimply false and silly (Quine 1960 [2013, p. 210]).\n\nMany philosophers have hoped that the apparent necessity and a\npriori status of the claims of logic, mathematics and much of\nphilosophy could be explained by their claims being analytic, our\nunderstanding of the meaning of the claims explaining why they seemed\nto be true \u201cin all possible worlds,\u201d and knowable to be\nso, \u201cindependently of experience.\u201d This view led many of\nthem to regard philosophy as consisting in large part in the\n\u201canalysis\u201d of the meanings of the relevant claims, words\nand\n concepts;[1]\n i.e., a provision of conditions that were individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for the application of a word or concept, in the\nway that, for example, being a female and being a\nparent are each necessary and together sufficient for being a\nmother. Such a conception seemed to invite and support (although\nwe\u2019ll see it doesn\u2019t entail) the special methodology of\n\u201carmchair reflection\u201d on concepts in which many\nphilosophers traditionally engaged, independently of any empirical\nresearch.\n",
