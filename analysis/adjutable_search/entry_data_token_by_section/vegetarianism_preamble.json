    "main_text": "\n\nBillions of humans eat meat. To provide it, we raise animals. We\ncontrol, hurt, and kill hundreds of millions of geese, nearly a\nbillion cattle, billions of pigs and ducks, and tens of billions of\nchickens each year.\n\nTo feed these animals, we raise crops. To raise crops, we deforest and\nuse huge quantities of water. To quench these animals, we use still\nmore water.\n\nIn turn, these animals produce staggering amounts of waste, waste that\npoisons water sources and soil. They produce staggering amounts of\ngreenhouse gasses.\n\nTo raise these animals and produce this meat, farmers and\nslaughterhouse workers labor in conditions from onerous to brutal.\n\nIf controlling, hurting, or killing animals is wrong or if the\nproduction of these environmental effects or effects on people is\nwrong or if consuming the meat produced is wrong, then a breathtaking\nlevel of wrong-doing goes on daily.\n\nMany fewer than a billion humans are vegetarian, have diets excluding\nmeat. They are vegetarian for various reasons: because it\u2019s\nhealthy, because their parents make them be vegetarian, because they\ndon\u2019t like meat. Some are vegetarian on moral grounds. Moral\nvegetarianism is the view that it is morally wrong\u2014henceforth,\n\u201cwrong\u201d\u2014to eat meat.\n\nThe topic of this entry is moral vegetarianism and the arguments for\nit. Strikingly, most contemporary arguments for moral vegetarianism\nstart with premises about the wrongness of producing meat and\nmove to conclusions about the wrongness of consuming it. They\ndo not fasten on some intrinsic feature of meat and insist that\nconsuming things with such a feature is wrong. They do not fasten on\nsome effect of meat-eating on the eater and insist that producing such\nan effect is wrong. Rather, they assert that the production of meat is\nwrong and that consumption bears a certain relation to production and\nthat bearing such a relation to wrongdoing is wrong. So this entry\ngives significant space to food production as well as the tricky\nbusiness of connecting production to consumption.\n\n\u00a71 introduces relevant terminology and an overview of the main\npositions. \u00a72 explains meat production,\nthe main moral arguments against it, and some responses to those arguments. That\nsection\u2014like the rest of the entry\u2014focuses on medium-sized\nland animals. Yet fish and insects are killed in a number that dwarfs\nthe number of land animals killed. Some issues these killings raise\nare covered in \u00a73.\n\nNone of the foregoing is about consuming animals. \u00a74 covers moral\narguments from premises about meat production to conclusions about\nmeat consumption. \u00a75 considers some extensions of the arguments\nin \u00a72. It wonders about which arguments against meat production\ncan, if sound, be extended to show that animal product production or\neven some plant production is morally wrong. This last idea is\nrelatively new. \u00a76 briefly summarizes some other new issues in\nthe moral vegetarian literature.\n",
