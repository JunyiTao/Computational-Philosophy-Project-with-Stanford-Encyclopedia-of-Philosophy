    "main_text": "Arguments for Expected Utility Theory || Long-Run Arguments\n2.1 Long-Run Arguments\n\n\nOne reason for maximizing expected utility is that it makes for good\npolicy in the long run. Feller (1968) gives a version of this\nargument. He relies on two mathematical facts about\nprobabilities: the strong and weak laws of large\nnumbers. Both these facts concern sequences of independent,\nidentically distributed trials\u2014the sort of setup that results\nfrom repeatedly betting the same way on a sequence of roulette spins or\ncraps games. Both the weak and strong laws of large numbers\nsay, roughly, that over the long run, the average amount of utility\ngained per trial is overwhelmingly likely to be close to the expected\nvalue of an individual trial.\n\n\nThe weak law of large numbers states that where each trial has an\nexpected value of \\(\\mu\\), for any arbitrarily small real numbers\n\\(\\epsilon \\gt 0\\) and \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\), there is some finite number of\ntrials \\(n\\), such that for all \\(m\\) greater than or equal\nto \\(n\\), with probability at least \\(1-\\delta\\), the gambler\u2019s\naverage gains for the first \\(m\\) trials will fall within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(\\mu\\). In other words, in a long run of similar\ngamble, the average gain per trial is highly likely to become\narbitrarily close to the gamble\u2019s expected value within a finite\namount of time. So in the finite long run, the average value\nassociated with a gamble is overwhelmingly likely to be close to its\nexpected value.\n\n\nThe strong law of large numbers states that where each trial has an\nexpected value of \\(\\mu\\), with probability 1, for any arbitrarily small real number \\(\\epsilon \\gt 0\\),as the number of trials increases, the gambler\u2019s average winnings per trial will fall within \\(\\epsilon\\) of\n\\(\\mu\\). In other words, as the number of repetitions of a\ngamble approaches infinity, the average gain per trial will become\narbitrarily close to the gamble\u2019s expected value with probability\n1. So in the long run, the average value associated with a gamble is\nvirtually certain to equal its expected value.\n\n\nThere are several objections to these long run arguments. \nFirst, many decisions cannot be repeated over indefinitely\nmany similar trials. Decisions about which career to pursue, whom\nto marry, and where to live, for instance, are made at best a small\nfinite number of times. Furthermore, where these decisions are\nmade more than once, different trials involve different possible\noutcomes, with different probabilities. It is not clear why\nlong-run considerations about repeated gambles should bear on these\nsingle-case choices.\n\n\nSecond, the argument relies on two independence assumptions, one or\nboth of which may fail. One assumption holds that the\nprobabilities of the different trials are independent. This is\ntrue of casino gambles, but not true of other choices where we wish to\nuse decision theory\u2014e.g., choices about medical treatment. \nMy remaining sick after one course of antibiotics makes it more likely\nI will remain sick after the next course, since it increases the chance\nthat antibiotic-resistant bacteria will spread through my body. The\nargument also requires that the utilities of different trials be\nindependent, so that winning a prize on one trial makes the same\ncontribution to the decision-maker\u2019s overall utility no matter\nwhat she wins on other trials. But this assumption is violated in\nmany real-world cases. Due to the diminishing marginal utility of\nmoney, winning $10 million on ten games of roulette is not worth ten times as\nmuch as winning $1 million on one game of roulette.\n\n\nA third problem is that the strong and weak laws of large numbers are\nmodally weak. Neither law entails that if a gamble were repeated\nindefinitely (under the appropriate assumptions), the average utility\ngain per trial would be close to the game\u2019s expected\nutility. They establish only that the average utility gain per trial\nwould with high probability be close to the game\u2019s expected\nutility. But high probability\u2014even probability 1\u2014is not\ncertainty. (Standard probability theory rejects Cournot\u2019s\nPrinciple, which says events with low or zero probability will\nnot happen.  But see Shafer (2005) for a defense of Cournot\u2019s\nPrinciple.) For any sequence of independent, identically distributed\ntrials, it is possible for the average utility payoff per trial to\ndiverge arbitrarily far from the expected utility of an individual\ntrial.\n",
