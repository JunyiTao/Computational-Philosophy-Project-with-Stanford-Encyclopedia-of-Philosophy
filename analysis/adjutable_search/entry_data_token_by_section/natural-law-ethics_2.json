    "main_text": "Key Features of Natural Law Theories || Natural law and practical rationality\n1.2 Natural law and practical rationality\n\nWhen we focus on the recipient of the natural law, that is, us human\nbeings, the thesis of Aquinas\u2019s natural law theory that comes to\nthe fore is that the natural law constitutes the basic principles of\npractical rationality for human beings, and has this status by nature\n(ST IaIIae 94, 2). The notion that the natural law\u00a0 constitutes\nthe basic principles of practical rationality implies, for Aquinas,\nboth that the precepts of the natural law are universally binding by\nnature (ST IaIIae 94, 4) and that the precepts of the natural law are\nuniversally knowable by nature (ST IaIIae 94, 4; 94, 6). \n\nThe precepts of the natural law are binding by nature: no beings could\nshare our human nature yet fail to be bound by the precepts of the\nnatural law. This is so because these precepts direct us toward the\ngood as such and various particular goods (ST IaIIae 94, 2). The good\nand goods provide reasons for us rational beings to act, to pursue the\ngood and these particular goods. As good is what is perfective of us\ngiven the natures that we have (ST Ia 5, 1), the good and these\nvarious goods have their status as such naturally. It is sufficient\nfor certain things to be good that we have the natures that we have;\nit is in virtue of our common human nature that the good for us is\nwhat it is.\n\nThe precepts of the natural law are also knowable by nature.\u00a0 All\nhuman beings possess a basic knowledge of the principles of the\nnatural law (ST IaIIae 94, 4). This knowledge is exhibited in our\nintrinsic directedness toward the various goods that the natural law\nenjoins us to pursue, and we can make this implicit awareness explicit\nand propositional through reflection on practice. Aquinas takes it\nthat there is a core of practical knowledge that all human beings\nhave, even if the implications of that knowledge can be hard to work\nout or the efficacy of that knowledge can be thwarted by strong\nemotion or evil dispositions (ST IaIIae 94, 6).\n\nIf Aquinas\u2019s view is paradigmatic of the natural law position,\nand these two theses \u2014 that from the God\u2019s-eye point of\nview, it is law through its place in the scheme of divine providence,\nand from the human\u2019s-eye point of view, it constitutes a set of\nnaturally binding and knowable precepts of practical reason \u2014\nare the basic features of the natural law as Aquinas understands it,\nthen it follows that paradigmatic natural law theory is incompatible\nwith several views in metaphysics and moral philosophy. On the side of\nmetaphysics, it is clear that the natural law view is incompatible\nwith atheism: one cannot have a theory of divine providence without a\ndivine being. It is also clear that the paradigmatic natural law view\nrules out a deism on which there is a divine being but that divine\nbeing has no interest in human matters. Nor can one be an agnostic\nwhile affirming the paradigmatic natural law view: for agnosticism is\nthe refusal to commit either to God\u2019s existence or nonexistence,\nwhereas the paradigmatic natural law view involves a commitment to\nGod\u2019s existence. On the side of moral philosophy, it is clear\nthat the natural law view is incompatible with a nihilism about value,\nthat is, the rejection of the existence of values. It is also\nincompatible with relativist and conventionalist views, on which the\nstatus of value is entirely relative to one\u2019s community or\ndetermined entirely by convention. It is also incompatible with a\nwholesale skepticism about value, for the natural law view commits one\nto holding that certain claims about the good are in fact knowable,\nindeed, knowable by all.\n",
