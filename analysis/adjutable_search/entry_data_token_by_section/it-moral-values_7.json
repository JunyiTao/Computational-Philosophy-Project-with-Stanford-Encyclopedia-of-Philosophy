    "main_text": "Specific Moral Challenges at the Cultural Level || Future Concerns\n3.4 Future Concerns\n\nAs was mentioned in the introduction above, information technologies\nare in a constant state of change and innovation. The internet\ntechnologies that have brought about so much social change were\nscarcely imaginable just decades before they appeared. Even though we\nmay not be able to foresee all possible future information\ntechnologies, it is important to try to imagine the changes we are\nlikely to see in emerging technologies. James Moor argues that moral\nphilosophers need to pay particular attention to emerging technologies\nand help influence the design of these technologies early on to\nencourage beneficial moral outcomes (Moor 2005). The following\nsections contain some potential technological concerns.\n3.4.1 Acceleration of Change\n\nAn information technology has an interesting growth pattern that has\nbeen observed since the founding of the industry. Intel engineer\nGordon E. Moore noticed that the number of components that could be\ninstalled on an integrated circuit doubled every year for a minimal\neconomic cost and he thought it might continue that way for another\ndecade or so from the time he noticed it in 1965 (Moore 1965). History\nhas shown his predictions were rather conservative. This doubling of\nspeed and capabilities along with a halving of costs to produce it has\nroughly continued every eighteen months since 1965 and is likely to\ncontinue. This phenomenon is not limited to computer chips and can\nalso be found in many different forms of information technologies. The\npotential power of this accelerating change has captured the\nimagination of the noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. He has\nfamously predicted that if this doubling of capabilities continues and\nmore and more technologies become information technologies, then there\nwill come a point in time where the change from one generation of\ninformation technology to the next will become so massive that it will\nchange everything about what it means to be human. Kurzweil has named\nthis potential event \u201cthe Singularity\u201d at which time he\npredicts that our technology will allow us to become a new post human\nspecies (2006). If this is correct, there could be no more profound\nchange to our moral values. There has been some support for this\nthesis from the technology community with institutes such as \n \nthe Acceleration Studies Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute, and\n H+.[2]\n Reaction to this hypothesis from philosophers has been mixed but\nlargely critical. For example Mary Midgley (1992) argues that the\nbelief that science and technology will bring us immortality and\nbodily transcendence is based on pseudoscientific beliefs and a deep\nfear of death. In a similar vein Sullins (2000) argues that there is often a\nquasi-religious aspect to the acceptance of transhumanism that is\ncommitted to certain outcomes such as uploading of human consciousness\ninto computers as a way to achieve immortality, and that the\nacceptance of the transhumanist hypothesis influences the values\nembedded in computer technologies, which can be dismissive or hostile\nto the human body. \n\nThere are other cogent critiques of this argument but none as simple\nas the realization that:\n\n\n\u2026there is, after all, a limit to how small things can get before\nthey simply melt. Moore\u2019s Law no longer holds. Just because\nsomething grows exponentially for some time, does not mean that it\nwill continue to do so forever\u2026 (Floridi, 2016). \n\n\nWhile many ethical systems place a primary moral value on preserving\nand protecting nature and the natural given world, transhumanists do\nnot see any intrinsic value in defining what is natural and what is not and\nconsider arguments to preserve some perceived natural state of the\nhuman body as an unjustifiable obstacle to progress. Not all philosophers\nare critical of transhumanism, as an example Nick Bostrom (2008) of\nthe Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University argues that\nputting aside the feasibility argument, we must conclude that there\nare forms of posthumanism that would lead to long and worthwhile lives\nand that it would be overall a very good thing for humans to become\nposthuman if it is at all possible (Bostrom, 2008). \n3.4.2 Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the many longstanding research\nprojects directed at building information technologies that exhibit\nsome or all aspects of human level intelligence and problem solving.\nArtificial Life (ALife) is a project that is not as old as AI and is\nfocused on developing information technologies and or synthetic\nbiological technologies that exhibit life functions typically found\nonly in biological entities. A more complete description of logic and\nAI can be found in the entry on\n logic and artificial intelligence.\n ALife essentially sees biology as a kind of naturally occurring\ninformation technology that may be reverse engineered and synthesized\nin other kinds of technologies. Both AI and ALife are vast research\nprojects that defy simple explanation. Instead the focus here is on\nthe moral values that these technologies impact and the way some of\nthese technologies are programmed to affect emotion and moral\nconcern.\n3.4.2.1 Artificial Intelligence\n\nAlan Turing is credited with defining the research project that would\ncome to be known as Artificial Intelligence in his seminal 1950 paper\n\u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence.\u201d He described the\n\u201cimitation game,\u201d where a computer attempts to fool a\nhuman interlocutor that it is not a computer but another human (Turing\n1948, 1950). In 1950, he made the now famous claim that\n\n\nI believe that in about fifty years\u2019 time\u2026. one will be able to\nspeak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.\n\n\nA description of the test and its implications to philosophy outside\nof moral values can be found here (see entry on\n the Turing test).\nTuring\u2019s prediction may have been overly ambitious and in fact\nsome have argued that we are nowhere near the completion of\nTuring\u2019s dream.  For example, Luciano Floridi (2011a) argues\nthat while AI has been very successful as a means of augmenting our\nown intelligence, but as a branch of cognitive science interested in\nintelligence production, AI has been a dismal disappointment.  The\nopposite opinion has also been argued and some claim that the Turing\nTest has already been passed or at least that programmers are on the\nverge of doing so. For instance it was reported by the BBC in 2014\nthat the Turing Test had been passed by a program that could convince\nthe judges that it was a 13 year old Ukrainian boy, but even so, many\nexperts remain skeptical (BBC 2014). \n\nFor argument\u2019s sake, assume Turing is correct even if he is off in his\nestimation of when AI will succeed in creating a machine that can\nconverse with you. Yale professor David Gelernter worries that that\nthere would be certain uncomfortable moral issues raised. \u201cYou\nwould have no grounds for treating it as a being toward which you have\nmoral duties rather than as a tool to be used as you like\u201d\n(Gelernter 2007). Gelernter suggests that consciousness is a\nrequirement for moral agency and that we may treat anything without it\nin any way that we want without moral regard. Sullins (2006) counters\nthis argument by noting that consciousness is not required for moral\nagency. For instance, nonhuman animals and the other living and\nnonliving things in our environment must be accorded certain moral\nrights, and indeed, any Turing capable AI would also have moral duties\nas well as rights, regardless of its status as a conscious being\n(Sullins 2006). \n\nAI is certainly capable of creating machines that can converse\neffectively in simple ways with with human beings as evidenced by\nApple Siri, Amazon Alexa, OK Goolge, etc. along with the many systems\nthat businesses use to automate customer service, but these are still\na ways away form having the natural kinds of unscripted conversations\nhumans have with one another.  But that may not matter when it comes\nto assessing the moral impact of these technologies.  In addition,\nthere are still many other applications that use AI technology. Nearly\nall of the information technologies we discussed above such as,\nsearch, computer games, data mining, malware filtering, robotics,\netc., all utilize AI programming techniques. Thus AI will grow to be a\nprimary location for the moral impacts of information technologies.\nMany governments and professional associations are now developing\nethical guidelines and standards to help shape this important\ntechnology, on e good example is the Global Initiative on the Ethics\nof Intelligent and Autonomous Systems (IEEE 2018).\n3.4.2.2 Artificial Life\n\nArtificial Life (ALife) is an outgrowth of AI and refers to the use of\ninformation technology to simulate or synthesize life functions. The\nproblem of defining life has been an interest in philosophy since its\nfounding. See the entry on\n life\n for a look at the concept of life and its philosophical\nramifications. If scientists and technologists were to succeed in\ndiscovering the necessary and sufficient conditions for life and then\nsuccessfully synthesize it in a machine or through synthetic biology,\nthen we would be treading on territory that has significant moral\nimpact. Mark Bedau has been tracing the philosophical implications of\nALife for some time now and argues that there are two distinct forms\nof ALife and each would thus have different moral effects if and when\nwe succeed in realizing these separate research agendas (Bedau 2004;\nBedau and Parke 2009). One form of ALife is completely computational\nand is in fact the earliest form of ALife studied. ALife is inspired\nby the work of the mathematician John von Neumann on self-replicating\ncellular automata, which von Neumann believed would lead to a\ncomputational understanding of biology and the life sciences (1966).\nThe computer scientist Christopher Langton simplified von Neumann\u2019s\nmodel greatly and produced a simple cellular automata called\n\u201cLoops\u201d in the early eighties and helped get the field off\nthe ground by organizing the first few conferences on Artificial Life\n(1989). Artificial Life programs are quite different from AI programs.\nWhere AI is intent on creating or enhancing intelligence, ALife is\ncontent with very simple minded programs that display life functions\nrather than intelligence. The primary moral concern here is that these\nprograms are designed to self-reproduce and in that way resemble\ncomputer viruses and indeed successful ALife programs could become as\nmalware vectors. The second form of ALife is much more morally\ncharged. This form of ALife is based on manipulating actual biological\nand biochemical processes in such a way as to produce novel life forms\nnot seen in nature.\n\nScientists at the J. Craig Venter institute were able to synthesize an\nartificial bacterium called JCVI-syn1.0 in May of 2010. While media\npaid attention to this breakthrough, they tended to focus on the\npotential ethical and social impacts of the creation of artificial\nbacteria. Craig Venter himself launched a public relations campaign\ntrying to steer the conversation about issues relating to creating\nlife. This first episode in the synthesis of life gives us a taste of\nthe excitement and controversy that will be generated when more viable\nand robust artificial protocells are synthesized. The ethical concerns\nraised by Wet ALife, as this kind of research is called, are more\nproperly the jurisdiction of bioethics (see entry on\n theory and bioethics).\n But it does have some concern for us here in that Wet ALife is part\nof the process of turning theories from the life sciences into\ninformation technologies. This will tend to blur the boundaries\nbetween bioethics and information ethics. Just as software ALife might\nlead to dangerous malware, so too might Wet ALife lead to dangerous\nbacteria or other disease agents. Critics suggest that there are\nstrong moral arguments against pursuing this technology and that we\nshould apply the precautionary principle here which states that if\nthere is any chance at a technology causing catastrophic harm, and\nthere is no scientific consensus suggesting that the harm will not\noccur, then those who wish to develop that technology or pursue that\nresearch must prove it to be harmless first (see Epstein 1980). Mark\nBedau and Mark Traint argue against a too strong adherence to the\nprecautionary principle by suggesting that instead we should opt for\nmoral courage in pursuing such an important step in human\nunderstanding of life (2009). They appeal to the Aristotelian notion\nof courage, not a headlong and foolhardy rush into the unknown, but a\nresolute and careful step forward into the possibilities offered by\nthis research.\n3.4.3 Robotics and Moral Values\n\nInformation technologies have not been content to remain confined to\nvirtual worlds and software implementations. These technologies are\nalso interacting directly with us through robotics applications.\nRobotics is an emerging technology but it has already produced a\nnumber of applications that have important moral implications.\nTechnologies such as military robotics, medical robotics, personal\nrobotics and the world of sex robots are just some of the already\nexistent uses of robotics that impact on and express our moral\ncommitments (see, Anderson and Anderson 2011; Capurro and Nagenborg\n2009; Lin et al. 2012, 2017).\n\nThere have already been a number of valuable contributions to the\ngrowing fields of machine morality and robot ethics (roboethics). For\nexample, in Wallach and Allen\u2019s book Moral Machines:\nTeaching Robots Right from Wrong (2010), the authors present\nideas for the design and programming of machines that can functionally\nreason on moral questions as well as examples from the field of\nrobotics where engineers are trying to create machines that can behave\nin a morally defensible way. The introduction of semi and fully\nautonomous machines, (meaning machines that make decisions with little\nor no human intervention), into public life will not be\nsimple. Towards this end, Wallach (2011) has also contributed to the\ndiscussion on the role of philosophy in helping to design public\npolicy on the use and regulation of robotics.\n\n\nMilitary robotics has proven to be one of the most ethically charged\nrobotics applications (Lin et al. 2008, 2013, Lin 2010; Strawser,\n2013). Today these machines are largely remotely operated (telerobots)\nor semi-autonomous, but over time these machines are likely to become\nmore and more autonomous due to the necessities of modern warfare\n(Singer 2009). In the first decades of war in the 21st\ncentury robotic weaponry has been involved in numerous killings of\nboth soldiers and noncombatants (Plaw 2013), and this fact alone is of\ndeep moral concern. Gerhard Dabringer has conducted numerous\ninterviews with ethicists and technologists regarding the implications\nof automated warfare (Dabringer 2010). Many ethicists are cautious in\ntheir acceptance of automated warfare with the provision that the\ntechnology is used to enhance ethical conduct in war, for instance by\nreducing civilian and military casualties or helping warfighters\nfollow International Humanitarian Law and other legal and ethical\ncodes of conduct in war (see Lin et al. 2008, 2013; Sullins 2009b),\nbut others have been highly skeptical of the prospects of an ethical\nautonomous war due to issues like the risk to civilians and the ease\nin which wars might be declared given that robots will be taking most\nof the risk (Asaro 2008; Sharkey 2011).\n4. Information Technologies of Morality\n\nA key development in the realm of information technologies is that\nthey are not only the object of moral deliberations but they are also\nbeginning to be used as a tool in moral deliberation itself. Since\nartificial intelligence technologies and applications are a kind of\nautomated problem solvers, and moral deliberations are a kind of\nproblem, it was only a matter of time before automated moral reasoning\ntechnologies would emerge. This is still only an emerging technology\nbut it has a number of very interesting moral implications which will\nbe outlined below. The coming decades are likely to see a number of\nadvances in this area and ethicists need to pay close attention to\nthese developments as they happen. Susan and Michael Anderson have\ncollected a number of articles regarding this topic in their book,\nMachine Ethics (2011), and Rocci Luppicini has a section of\nhis anthology devoted to this topic in the Handbook of Research on\nTechnoethics (2009).\n4.1 Information Technology as a Model for Moral Discovery\n\nPatrick Grim has been a longtime proponent of the idea that philosophy\nshould utilize information technologies to automate and illustrate\nphilosophical thought experiments (Grim et al. 1998; Grim 2004). Peter\nDanielson (1998) has also written extensively on this subject\nbeginning with his book Modeling Rationality, Morality, and\nEvolution with much of the early research in the computational\ntheory of morality centered on using computer models to elucidate the\nemergence of cooperation between simple software AI or ALife agents\n(Sullins 2005). \n\nLuciano Floridi and J. W. Sanders argue that information as it is used\nin the theory of computation can serve as a powerful idea that can\nhelp resolve some of the famous moral conundrums in philosophy such as\nthe nature of evil (1999, 2001). The propose that along with moral\nevil and natural evil, both concepts familiar to philosophy (see entry\non\n the problem of evil);\n we add a third concept they call artificial evil (2001). Floridi and\nSanders contend that if we do this then we can see that the actions of\nartificial agents\n\n\n\u2026to be morally good or evil can be determined even in the\nabsence of biologically sentient participants and thus allows\nartificial agents not only to perpetrate evil (and for that matter\ngood) but conversely to \u2018receive\u2019 or \u2018suffer\nfrom\u2019 it. (Floridi and Sanders 2001)\n\n\nEvil can then be equated with something like information dissolution,\nwhere the irretrievable loss of information is bad and the\npreservation of information is good (Floridi and Sanders 2001). This\nidea can move us closer to a way of measuring the moral impacts of any\ngiven action in an information environment.\n4.2 Information Technology as a Moral System\n\nEarly in the twentieth century the American philosopher John Dewey\n(see entry on\n John Dewey)\n proposed a theory of inquiry based on the instrumental uses of\ntechnology. Dewey had an expansive definition of technology which\nincluded not only common tools and machines but information systems\nsuch as logic, laws and even language as well (Hickman 1990). Dewey\nargued that we are in a \u2018transactional\u2019 relationship with\nall of these technologies within which we discover and construct our\nworld (Hickman 1990). This is a helpful standpoint to take as it\nallows us to advance the idea that an information technology of\nmorality and ethics is not impossible. As well as allowing us to take\nseriously the idea that the relations and transactions between human\nagents and those that exist between humans and their artifacts have\nimportant ontological similarities. While Dewey could only dimly\nperceive the coming revolutions in information technologies, his\ntheory is useful to us still because he proposed that ethics was not\nonly a theory but a practice and solving problems in ethics is like\nsolving problems in algebra (Hickman 1990). If he is right, then an\ninteresting possibility arises, namely the possibility that ethics and\nmorality are computable problems and therefore it should be possible\nto create an information technology that can embody moral systems of\nthought. \n\nIn 1974 the philosopher Mario Bunge proposed that we take the notion\nof a \u2018technoethics\u2019 seriously arguing that moral\nphilosophers should emulate the way engineers approach a problem.\nEngineers do not argue in terms of reasoning by categorical\nimperatives but instead they use:\n\n\n\u2026 the forms If A produces B, and you value\nB, chose to do A, and If A produces\nB and C produces D, and you prefer\nB to D, choose A rather than C. In\nshort, the rules he comes up with are based on fact and value, I\nsubmit that this is the way moral rules ought to be fashioned, namely\nas rules of conduct deriving from scientific statements and value\njudgments. In short ethics could be conceived as a branch of\ntechnology. (Bunge 1977, 103)\n\n\nTaking this view seriously implies that the very act of building\ninformation technologies is also the act of creating specific moral\nsystems within which human and artificial agents will, at least\noccasionally, interact through moral transactions. Information\ntechnologists may therefore be in the business of creating moral\nsystems whether they know it or not and whether or not they want that\nresponsibility.\n4.3 Informational Organisms as Moral Agents\n\nThe most comprehensive literature that argues in favor of the prospect\nof using information technology to create artificial moral agents is\nthat of Luciano Floridi (1999, 2002, 2003, 2010b, 2011b), and Floridi\nwith Jeff W. Sanders (1999, 2001, 2004). Floridi (1999) recognizes\nthat issues raised by the ethical impacts of information technologies\nstrain our traditional moral theories. To relieve this friction he\nargues that what is needed is a broader philosophy of information\n(2002). After making this move, Floridi (2003) claims that information\nis a legitimate environment of its own and that has its own intrinsic\nvalue that is in some ways similar to the natural environment and in\nother ways radically foreign but either way the result is that\ninformation is on its own a thing that is worthy of ethical concern.\nFloridi (2003) uses these ideas to create a theoretical model of moral\naction using the logic of object oriented programming. \n\nHis model has seven components; 1) the moral agent a, 2) the moral\npatient p (or more appropriately, reagent), 3) the\ninteractions of these agents, 4) the agent\u2019s frame of\ninformation, 5) the factual information available to the agent\nconcerning the situation that agent is attempting to navigate, 6) the\nenvironment the interaction is occurring in, and 7) the situation in\nwhich the interaction occurs (Floridi 2003, 3). Note that there is no\nassumption of the ontology of the agents concerned in the moral\nrelationship modeled and these agents can be any mixture or artificial\nor natural in origin (Sullins 2009a).\n\nThere is additional literature which critiques arguments such as\nFloridi\u2019s with the hope of expanding the idea of automated moral\nreasoning so that one can speak of many different types of automated\nmoral technologies form simple applications all the way to full moral\nagents with rights and responsibilities similar to humans (Adam 2008;\nAnderson and Anderson 2011; Johnson and Powers 2008; Schmidt 2007;\nWallach and Allen 2010).\n\nWhile scholars recognize that we are still some time from creating\ninformation technology that would be unequivocally recognized as an\nartificial moral agent, there are strong theoretical arguments in\nsuggesting that automated moral reasoning is an eventual possibility\nand therefore it is an appropriate area of study for those interested\nin the moral impacts of information technologies.",
