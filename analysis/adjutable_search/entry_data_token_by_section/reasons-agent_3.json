    "main_text": "The Principle-Based Conception Revisited\n4. The Principle-Based Conception Revisited\n\nWe seemed to have reached a dialectical cul de sac. The\nprinciple-based approach draws the distinction nicely but is\ninaccessible to particularists. The reason-statement-based approach to\nthe distinction is tenable on certain ontological views about reasons\nbut seems useless on a wide variety of other plausible ontological\nviews about reasons. Finally, the perspective-based approach threatens\nto just change the subject or at least to mire the application of the\ndistinction down in so much controversy as to make it useless as a\ntool for framing the debates which it seems so naturally suited to\nframe.\n\nFortunately, though, the principle-based approach can actually be\nunderstood in a way that is compatible with particularism after all,\nand this is how we propose to understand the distinction (this goes\nbeyond the existing literature, but does so in the spirit of a\n\u2018friendly amendment\u2019 to Nagel\u2019s account). The key\nmove is to not build Nagel\u2019s conception of universality into the\narticulation of the distinction. So one might allow that a given\nconsideration (or state of affairs, or feature of a situation; insert\nyour favored ontology of reasons here) is a reason in one case but\nthat very same consideration might be no reason at all (or even a\nreason with the opposite valence) in another situation due to some\ndifference between the two situations. At least, drawing of the\ndistinction should not rule this out. In this way, the distinction is\ncompatible with the particularist\u2019s favored holistic conception\nof reasons.\n\nThis very quickly leads to an awkward question, though. Nagel drew his\ndistinction in terms of principles which incorporated his conception\nof universality. For Nagel\u2019s principles were universally\nquantified generalizations which held that whenever an agent\ncan promote a certain sort of state of affairs there is reason to do\nso. So a different way of understanding \u2018the general form of a\nreason\u2019 or as one might prefer to put it, the principle\ncorresponding to the reason, is needed. Fortunately, there is an\nalternative conception ready to hand. As Sean McKeever and Ridge argue\nelsewhere (see McKeever and Ridge 2006) there is a species of hedged\nmoral principle which is compatible with the particularist\u2019s\nholistic conception of reasons. McKeever and Ridge call these\n\u2018default principles\u2019, and they are well situated to make\nNagel\u2019s principle-based distinction available even to as hardy a\nparticularist as Jonathan Dancy. As background, recall that on the\nholistic conception of how reasons work, what is a reason here may be\nno reason at all or even a reason with the opposite valence elsewhere.\nSo for example, the fact that it would give a father pleasure is a\nreason for his son to give him a kiss on the cheek but that very same\nconsideration (that it would give him pleasure) may be no reason at\nall for him to watch a snuff film. Intuitively, the status of the fact\nthat it would give him pleasure as a reason is \u2018defeated\u2019\nin the latter case by the fact that the pleasure would be sadistic (or\nan expression of depravity, or whatever). Holists therefore call such\nfacts \u2018defeaters\u2019. This is also compatible with what\nholists call \u2018enablers\u2019\u2014facts which are necessary\nfor some other fact to function as a reason. In fact, distinguishing\nenablers from reasons also arguably helps block another challenge to\nthe distinction between agent-relative reasons and agent-neutral\nreasons, namely that all reasons must make some reference to the agent\nbecause there being a reason implies that the agent is able to perform\nthe action. This objection could be blocked by characterizing this\nback-reference as trivial, but one might instead insist that the\nagent\u2019s ability to perform the action is an enabling condition\nrather than part of the reason itself; see Ronnow-Rasmussen 2009 for\nan argument along these lines. In any event, with this machinery in\nhand, default principles can help craft a version of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction that everyone (or just about\neveryone) can live with.\n\nGiven holism, a true and non-trivial principle about reasons must\naccommodate the possibility of defeaters. This can be done in one of\ntwo ways. First, one could try to list all of the different possible\ndefeaters in the antecedent and claim that none is present. However, a\nhardy particularist may insist that this is a fool\u2019s game, on\nthe grounds that there is no saying in advance of considering all of\nthe indefinitely many possible contexts in which the putative reason\noccurs whether we have a complete list of all possible defeaters.\nAfter all, part of the particularist idea is that morality is far too\ncomplex for any such principles ever to be within our ken.\nParticularists allow that there may in principle be some infinitely\nlong generalization which lists all the defeaters, but deny that this\ncounts as a principle because it is not explanatory. However, there is\na second approach, and this is the approach which inspires the\nproposed conception of default principles. Instead of trying to list\nall of the possible defeaters and countervailing reasons one could\ninstead quantify over them. The proposal is most easily understood\nthrough illustrative examples. Returning to our example of pleasure\nand sadism, consider the following default principle:\n\n(P)\nFor all possible agents (p), and all possible actions\n(x) and all facts (F) If F is a fact to the\neffect that p\u2019s x-ing would promote pleasure\nand no other feature of the situation explains why F is not a\nreason to x then F is a reason for p to\nx.\n\n\n(P) is compatible with the particularist\u2019s holistic conception\nof reasons. For in those cases in which the status of a fact about\npleasure as a reason is defeated by sadism (e.g.) the \u2018no other\nfeature of the situation explains why F is not a\nreason\u2026\u2019 clause is not satisfied. Moreover, it is hard to\nsee how particularists could really object to principles as modest as\n(P). After all, (P) is compatible with the thesis that there are\nindefinitely many possible types of reasons and indefinitely many\npossible defeaters corresponding to each of those reasons. So the mere\navailability of default principles does not entail that the normative\nlandscape could be finitely (much less manageably) codified in some\nshort set of axioms like Ross\u2019s list of prima facie\nduties, for instance. Furthermore, the availability of such principles\nin logical space does not in itself entail that they are presupposed\nby the very possibility of moral thought and judgment. So the\navailability of such principles is compatible with Dancy\u2019s\ncanonical formulation of particularism, according to which, \u201cthe\npossibility of moral thought and judgement does not depend on the\nprovision of a suitable supply of moral principles\u201d (Dancy 2004:\n7).\n\nWhat is the payoff of such principles in terms of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction? Default principles allow one\nto draw the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in much the same\nway that Nagel drew it but without thereby excluding\nparticularists. An initial gloss of the distinction might go as\nfollows. A given default principle will either include a free-agent\nvariable in the statement of the consideration which is the reason or\nnot. If it does then the reason is agent-relative; if not then the\nreason is agent-neutral. However, this is not quite right. For every\nstatement of a reason will be a statement about an action which is a\npossible action for the agent for whom it is a reason. I cannot have\nreason to perform an action that only someone else could perform,\nafter all. Since this sort of back-reference to the agent is entirely\ntrivial, we must explicitly add to our definition that it is not\nsufficient to make a reason agent-relative. Otherwise, all reasons\nwill implausibly come out as agent-relative for this trivial reason.\nIndeed, Derek Parfit already noticed this in his discussion,\nexplaining that,\n\nEven if you and I are trying to achieve some common aim, we may be in\ndifferent causal situations. I may have reason to act in a way that\npromotes our common aim, but you may have no such reason since you may\nbe unable to act in this way. Since even agent-neutral reasons are, in\nthis sense, agent-relative, this sense is irrelevant to our\ndiscussion. (Parfit 1984: 143)\n\n\nThis suggests that the statement of the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction should be slightly revised. The default principle\ncorresponding to a given reason will either include a\nnon-trivial free-agent-variable in the statement of the\nreason or not. If it does then the reason is agent-relative; otherwise\nit is agent-neutral. The idea is that the use of a free-agent variable\nto indicate that the action is one available to the agent for whom the\nfact is a reason is trivial in the sense that it must be included in\nthe statement of any reason whatsoever. So the reasons associated with\nthe default principle (P) [see above] are agent-neutral, as the only\nuse of the free-agent variable \u2018p\u2019 is the trivial one that\nindicates that x is a possible action of p\u2019s.\nBy contrast, the reasons associated with the following principle would\nbe agent-relative:\n\n(P*)\nFor all possible agents (p), and all possible actions\n(x) and all facts (F) If F is a fact to the\neffect that p\u2019s x-ing would promote\np\u2019s pleasure and no other feature of the situation\nexplains why F is not a reason to x then F\nis a reason for p to x.\n\n\nUnlike (P), the statement of the reason given in (P*) includes a\nnon-trivial use of a free-agent variable in its insistence that the\npleasure promoted must be p\u2019s. So the reasons\nassociated with (P*) come out as agent-relative. It is not hard to see\nthat the proposed reading of the distinction should easily pass the\nlitmus test given above, classifying objective utilitarian reasons as\nagent-neutral (as with (P)) and egoistic reasons as agent-relative.\nMoreover, it is easy to see that the proposed reading of the\ndistinction would sort other paradigmatic instances of\nagent-relativity and agent-neutrality in an intuitively satisfying\nway. Abandoning Nagel\u2019s assumption of universality in favor of\nour more modest default principles seems to allow us to make good\nsense of his distinction without excluding even fairly radical forms\nof particularism.\n\nHowever, before we rest too easily with this conclusion, we must first\naddress an important objection to default\n principles.[4]\n The challenge insists that they are all vacuously true simply in\nvirtue of their logical form. Since default principles are universally\nquantified conditionals, they can be false only if they have an\ninstantiation in which the antecedent is true and the consequent is\nfalse. The worry behind the vacuity objection is that the logical form\nof a default principle in conjunction with some very plausible\nassumptions about moral explanation entails that whenever the\nconsequent of a default principle is false, its antecedent will be\nfalse as well, in which case the principle itself is vacuously true.\nConsider the following inane default principle:\n\n LY:\n For all actions, (x) (If (a) x would be done in\na leap year and (b) no other feature of the situation explains why the\nfact that x would be done in a leap year is not a moral\nreason not to x and (c) the reasons in favor of x do\nnot explain why x is not wrong in virtue of the fact that\nx would be done in a leap year then x is wrong in\nvirtue of the fact that x would be done in a leap year).\n\n\nLY is clearly absurd. For an action is wrong in virtue of a given fact\nor set of facts in the intended sense of \u2018in virtue of\u2019\nonly if the fact(s) in question is (or are) moral reason(s) not to\nperform the action which carry the day. Plausibly, that the fact that\nan action would be done in a leap year could never itself be a moral\nreason to perform the\n action.[5]\n So LY had better come out as false. The vacuity objection, however,\ninsists that LY turns out to be trivially true. Moreover, the\nobjection continues, the reason LY is true carries over to any default\nprinciple.\n\nLY is a universally quantified conditional ranging over possible\nactions and hence is false only if it has a possible instantiation in\nwhich its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. Presumably\nits consequent is necessarily always false\u2014no action could be\nmade wrong in the relevant sense by being done in a leap\nyear\u2014the fact that an action is done in a leap year could never\nin itself be a moral reason not to perform an action. So the crucial\nissue is whether any of its instantiations also has a true antecedent.\nThe antecedent is itself a conjunction and hence will be true only if\nboth conjuncts are true. However, the objection runs, the second of\nthe three conjuncts [(b) above] is necessarily false or is false for\nall possible actions. I am taking it as given that the leap year fact\nis not a moral reason, but the objection insists on general grounds\nthat it is implausible to suppose that there is no explanation of its\nfailure to be a moral reason. Moral facts are not arbitrary, at least\nin the extremely minimal sense that whenever something is or is not a\nmoral reason there will be some explanation of why this is\nso. Even someone who thought that morality was a direct function of\nthe arbitrary will of God should admit this much, since we will on\nsuch an account always be able to explain moral differences in terms\nof differences in God\u2019s will even if we cannot go on to explain\nwhy God willed one way rather than another. So moral differences can\nalways be explained. Hence clause (b) in any default principle will\nalways be false, which is enough to make the antecedent false and so\nenough to make the conditional trivially true.\n\nAn adequate understanding of why the vacuity objection is unsound\nrequires careful attention to a further detail. The vacuity objection\ngoes from the premise that every time a fact is not a moral reason\nthere is some explanation for its failure to be a moral reason to the\nconclusion that the \u2018no further feature of the situation\nexplains\u2026\u2019 clause of the corresponding default principle\nwill always be false whenever the fact in question is not a reason.\nHowever, this inference is valid only if it is valid to go from\n\u2018there is some explanation of p\u2019 to \u2018some\nfeature of the situation explains p\u2019 and this inference\nis invalid. The inference would be valid only if we were to interpret\n\u2018feature of the situation\u2019 so broadly that any possible\nexplanatory fact can count as a feature of the situation. This is not\nat all an intuitive reading of \u2018feature of the situation\u2019,\nnor is it the intended reading. Hence the vacuity objection is\nunsound.\n\nFor present purposes, the main point is just that a feature of a\nsituation must be a contingent fact. Necessary facts apply equally to\nall possible situations and hence are never features of any particular\nsituation in our sense. This is already enough to accommodate the\nplausible idea that every moral fact has an explanation of some kind\nwhile blocking the vacuity objection. For quite plausibly, the moral\nfacts in question will be explained by some necessary fact. For\nexample, the explanation of why the fact that a given action would be\ndone in a leap year is not a moral reason not to perform that action\nmight simply be that the fact that an action would be done in a leap\nyear could never be any kind of reason for action. That explanation is\nperhaps not the most illuminating one, but it is a kind of explanation\nand it is an explanation given in terms of a necessary fact. An\nalternative (and more controversial) explanation might appeal to the\nputative fact that a given fact is a moral reason only if it is a fact\nabout how the action bears in some way on welfare or treating people\nwith respect. This is a very controversial explanation, but the point\nis simply that if the main premise of this explanation (a kind of\npluralism involving utilitarian reasons and deontological reasons) is\ntrue then it very plausibly is a necessary truth. Once again, the fact\nin question does indeed have an explanation but it is not explained by\na feature of the situation. So there is no need to reject the\nplausible suggestion that every moral fact has some explanation to\nrefute the vacuity objection.\n\nMore importantly, no contingent feature of the situation could\nplausibly figure in an explanation of why the leap year fact is not a\nmoral reason in a given case. Indeed, because the leap year fact could\nnever be a reason its failure to be a reason here will in no\nway depend on any of the contingent features of this case. So none of\nthose contingent features of the case at hand will figure in an\nexplanation of why that fact is not a moral reason here. If the leap\nyear fact were sometimes a reason then things would be very different.\nFor in that case the contingent features that distinguish the\nsituation in which it is a reason from those in which it is not a\nmoral reason could intelligibly figure in an explanation of why the\nfact is not a moral reason here. Moreover, if asked to cite some\nparticular contingent feature of the situation that explains why that\nfact is not a moral reason here any sane moral agent would simply be\nperplexed. Hence for any default principle citing a patently absurd\ncandidate reason (and whose consequent is not necessarily true) there\nwill be possible instantiations of that principle in which the\nantecedent is true and the consequent is false. This line of argument\nis perfectly general, so any principle citing a putative reason in its\nantecedent which could never actually be a moral reason (and whose\nconsequent can be false; principles with tautologous consequents will\nof course be trivially true on anybody\u2019s account) will turn out\nto be false. The only reason to doubt that the antecedent would\nsometimes be true was the thought that the \u2018no feature of the\nsituation explains\u2026\u2019 clause is always trivially false.\nSince this rests on a failure to distinguish explanations in general\nfrom explanations cast in terms of contingent features, it is\nreasonable to conclude that default principles are not all vacuously\ntrue simply in virtue of their logical form. So default principles can\nsafely be invoked to articulate the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction and thereby capture Nagel\u2019s basic idea without\nmaking the distinction useless to radical moral particularists like\nDancy.\n",
