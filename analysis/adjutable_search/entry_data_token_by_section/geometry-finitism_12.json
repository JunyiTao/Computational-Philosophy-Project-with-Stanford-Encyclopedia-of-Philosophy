    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as generators of classical geometry || The general framework\n3.1 The general framework\n\nAs stated in\n section 1,\n here we will discuss proposals that search for a theory or model,\nunderlying a geometrical theory, such that therefrom the classical\ngeometrical concepts can be derived. Obviously one needs to be\nextremely careful as the \u201cdanger\u201d is constantly present\nthat infinities enter into the picture somewhere unseen or unnoticed.\nSuppose, to give a simple example, that only a set of finite points is\nallowed for, but also an operation that generates between any pair of\npoints a third point different from all points present and there are\nno restrictions on the number of times the operation can be applied,\nthen clearly we have here an in infinite number of points \u201cin\ndisguise\u201d. To call such a model a discrete geometrical model\nseems quite inappropriate.\n\nOne also needs to be very careful about, e.g., claims that quantum\nmechanics deals with discrete values, usually in relation to\nHeisenberg uncertainty principles, hence physics at the basic level is\na discrete theory. That, however, is extremely misleading. It is\nsufficient to consult any handbook on quantum mechanics to observe\nthat the mathematics used requires the full use of infinities. No\nmatter whether one uses Heisenberg\u2019s matrix approach,\nHilbert\u2019s operator formalism, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave\nequation or some other formalism, the mathematics involves integrals,\nderivatives, infinite (convergent) sums, spaces with infinite\ndimension, and so on (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics).\n Not much discreteness to be found here. This implies that for quantum\nmechanics as well it is a genuine problem to find a discrete\ncounterpart. That is clearly demonstrated by the attempts of Gerard\n\u2019t Hooft to reformulate quantum mechanics in a truly discrete\nfashion, see \u2019t Hooft (2014). Interesting to note is that it\naffects issues such as determinism versus indeterminism.\n\nFrom the historical point of view, no doubt the work of Tullio Regge\ncan be seen as a first attempt to develop a model out of which\ngeometrical concepts could be developed. The original paper dates from\n1961, see Regge (1961). More specifically, we are concerned here with\ngeneral relativity theory (GRT). Although the original intention of\nRegge was to construct techniques for solving the equations of GRT in\nthe \u201cdifficult\u201d cases, i.e., where there is no symmetry\npresent and perturbation theory is not applicable. Rather than\ntranscribing the differential equations of GRT into difference\nequations, Regge looked for a technique that leads to different\nequations altogether. Without presenting the full details, the core\nconcept of his approach is the \u201cdeficit angle\u201d. In GRT we\nare dealing with curved spaces. Take a two-dimensional curved surface.\nIf it is flat, then it can be covered with triangles. If it is curved,\nit can be approximated with triangles, but with an important\ndifference. Suppose that triangles meet at vertices, then we can look\nat one particular point and all the triangles that meet in that point.\nIf that part of the surface is flattened out, there will be a gap\nsomewhere. To this gap corresponds an angle and that is precisely the\ndeficit angle. The larger the curvature, the larger the deficit angle.\nThe same technique works for the four-dimensional case, where instead\nof triangles, simplexes are used. The beauty of this approach is that\nthe equations of GRT can be rewritten in terms of deficit angles and\nlengths of the edges of the simplexes and solved in terms of these\nconcepts. Misner et al. (1973) contains a chapter (42: \u201cThe\nRegge Calculus\u201d) that explains Regge\u2019s approach in a\ncompact and perfectly accessible way.\n\nToday there is a rather impressive amount of attempts being made. Most\nof them are to be considered as highly speculative as they truly\nreflect the present state of affairs in full development. However\nthere is a remaining set of approaches that slowly start to emerge and\nthat seems to be viable candidates and of interest for a finitist view\nof geometry (in terms of spacetime). It should be noted that for the\nauthors concerned their principal aim is not so much to formulate a\ndiscrete form of geometry but rather to establish whether this or that\nmodel will serve as a common foundation to quantum (field) theory and\nGRT, hence to the whole of physics, so to speak or, if one likes, the\n\u201cTheory of Everything\u201d. Our concern here is actually more\nmodest: do these models tell us anything about how discrete geometries\ncan be formulated such that they generate classical geometry? So, even\nif the physicists were to reject such a model on the basis of good\nsolid physical reasons, it might still be of interest to the question\nof the possibility of discrete geometry.\n\nHuggett & Wuthrich (2013a) presents a nice overview of the\nsituation at that time as far as the remaining set is concerned. It is\nworth mentioning that this paper is part of a special issue, Huggett\n& Wuthrich (2013b), on the emergence of spacetime in quantum\ntheories of gravity. Altogether they discuss and evaluate six types of\nproposals but we will consider here only three. The remaining three\nare either too speculative at the present moment or do not involve\ndiscrete spacetimes (such as string theory and non-commutative\ngeometry). The three approaches relevant for our topic are:\n\nLattice spacetime: this is close to Regge\u2019s approach in the\nsense that continuous space (and time) are replaced by a discrete\nstructure, in this case a lattice. If these lattices are equipped with\nsome form of\u2014obviously discrete\u2014metric, the connections\nbetween continuous and discrete space (and time) become very close.\nThe next section presents such a proposal (leaving out the\nphysics),\nNon-metrical lattices: the best known example under this heading\nare causal lattices. The connections between the \u201cpoints\u201d\nin the lattice are causal relations and this requires a lot more work\nto derive a space-time structure from it. In fact, in many cases we\nhave no-go theorems in the sense that the discrete lattices\n\u201cfail to have well-behaved continuum limits resembling\nrelativistic spacetimes\u201d (p. 278), thus \u201cechoing\u201d\nthe already mentioned negative result of Fritz (2013),\nLoop quantum gravity: this theory is one of the attempts, taken\nseriously, to unify quantum (field) theory and general relativity. The\nbasic structures are so-called three-dimensional spin networks. If\nthese networks are allowed to evolve over time, then a\nfour-dimensional structure emerges, so-called spin foam, that in the\nlimit should generate the relativistic space-time structure. A\ncaveat should be inserted here: although the structure of a\nspin network is that of a graph with a set of nodes and a set of\nedges, nevertheless these nodes and edges are labeled by physically\nmeaningful quantities that involve continuous structures such as Lie\ngroups. Without going into details this short extract of Reisenberger\n(1999) is highly illustrative:\n\n\nIn general the edges of a spin network carry non-trivial irreducible\nrepresentations (irreps) of the gauge group, and the vertices carry\nintertwiners. The intertwiner for a vertex can be any invariant tensor\nof the product representation \\(R\\) formed by the product of the\nirreps carried by the incoming edges and the duals of the irreps on\nthe outgoing edges. (p. 2047)\n\n\n\nIn order to appreciate how quickly things are evolving in this\nresearch area, one should make a comparison between the already\nmentioned Huggett & W\u00fcthrich (2013a) and two other papers,\none earlier and one more recent. The former one is Meschini et al.\n(2005), also meant to be a survey paper. Interestingly enough, Huggett\nand W\u00fcthrich describe their survey as complementary to this one.\nThe latter one is Surya (2019), again a survey paper. The focus here\nis on the causal set approach. Combine this with Smolin (2018), where,\namong other things, quantum loop gravity is discussed, and one must be\nimpressed by the degree of sophistication that has been reached. It is\nimportant to realize that certainly the more fully developed\napproaches involve physics right from the start. Oddly enough, such\napproaches are not studied in the already mentioned literature on\nspatial logics, see\n 1.1 Logicians.\n Nevertheless the connections between the two research topics are very\ndeep and close and definitely need to be explored further.\n\nTo make the above high-level presentation more concrete, the work of\nNowotny & Requardt (1999) is briefly presented. Although a bit\ndated, it is a prototypical example because of how a classical\ngeometry can be built up, starting with a (causal) lattice, before the\nphysics steps in.\n",
