    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Jurisdiction\n1.8 Jurisdiction\n\n\nThe jurisdictional theory of immigration emphasizes that, while\npolitical states are morally required to respect everyone\u2019s human\nrights, they are obligated to protect the rights of only those\nwithin their territory.  Given this, whenever someone moves to a new\nstate, the citizens of the receiving country become responsible for\nthis newcomer in a way that they were not before her arrival.  It\nwould thus seem weird to suppose that everyone should be free to move\nto whatever country they like, because this would entitle each of us\nto unilaterally impose moral responsibilities upon others.  If we\nvalue individual liberty, then we should begin with at least a\npresumption against others being at liberty to unilaterally foist\nthese responsibilities on us (Blake 2013).  Our immunity against\nunwelcome obligations may not be absolute, but it would presumably\nrequire a compelling competing consideration to outweigh it.  If\nsomeone could not enjoy sufficient protection of her human rights\nunless she moved to Canada, for instance, then this vulnerable person\nmay be entitled to immigrate without permission even though this move\nwill saddle Canadian citizens with moral duties to which they did not\nconsent.  But if someone whose rights are adequately respected\nelsewhere sought to move to Canada merely because she thinks she would\nbe happier there, Canadians would be well within their rights to\nforcibly exclude her if they would prefer not to be responsible for\nprotecting her human rights. \n\n\nThose who think that there is a natural duty to support just\ninstitutions may question the pivotal premise in this approach: that\nwe should be skeptical of political obligations to which we have not\nconsented.  After all, if each of us was really immune from political\nduties to which we did not consent, then many of us would not have\nduties to protect the human rights of our compatriots.  But if we must\ndo our part of the collective chore of protecting the human rights of\nour fellow citizens despite the fact that we never agreed to do so,\nwhy think that there is anything distinctively problematic about our\nsimilarly having such duties to newcomers who have recently\nimmigrated?  Indeed, given that we are already morally encumbered with\nduties to protect the human rights of those within our state\u2019s\nterritorial boundaries, an influx of newcomers does not create any new\ntypes of duties, at most it creates additional tokens which would make\nfulfilling these responsibilities more costly (Kates and Pevnick\n2014).  \n\n\nIn response, an advocate of the jurisdictional approach might counter\nthat prospective immigrants have no right to unilaterally act in ways\nthat make our natural duties more demanding.  But retreating to this\nposition raises new questions.  Given that immigrants also contribute\nto the state\u2019s performance of its political functions, it is not\nobvious why an influx of prospective immigrants would necessarily make\nit more difficult for those already present to fulfill their political\nobligations.  (Indeed, given economies of scale, the newcomers may\noften lighten the load of the native population.)  And even if there\nare instances in which the arrival of immigrants would create net\ncosts for a state\u2019s existing population, this fact would generate a\nright to forcibly exclude outsiders only if the increased demands upon\nthose already present should be given moral precedence over the costs\nimposed upon prospective immigrants who are denied entry.  Because\nprospective immigrants often have pressing interests in entering a\ncountry (even if their human rights are satisfactorily protected),\nhowever, there may be many cases in which the interests of those who\nwant to enter would prevail over a native population\u2019s desire to avoid\nmore costly political responsibilities (Kates and Pevnick 2014).  \n",
