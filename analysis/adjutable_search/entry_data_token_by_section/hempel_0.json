    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nCarl G(ustav) Hempel (1905\u201397), known as \u201cPeter\u201d to\nhis friends, was born near Berlin, Germany, on January 8, 1905. He\nstudied philosophy, physics and mathematics at the Universities of\nG\u00f6ttingen and Heidelberg before coming to the University of\nBerlin in 1925, where he studied with Hans Reichenbach. Impressed by\nthe work of David Hilbert and Paul Bernays on the foundations of\nmathematics and introduced to the studies of Rudolf Carnap by\nReichenbach, Hempel came to believe that the application of symbolic\nlogic held the key to resolving a broad range of problems in\nphilosophy, including that of separating genuine problems from merely\napparent ones. Hempel\u2019s commitment to rigorous explications of\nthe nature of cognitive significance, of scientific explanation, and\nof scientific rationality would become the hallmark of his research,\nwhich exerted great influence on professional philosophers, especially\nduring the middle decades of the 20th Century.\n\nIn 1929, at Reichenbach\u2019s suggestion, Hempel spent the fall\nsemester at the University of Vienna, where he studied with Carnap,\nMoritz Schlick, and Frederick Waismann, who were advocates of logical\npositivism and members of (what came to be known as) \u201cthe Vienna\nCircle\u201d. It would fall to Hempel to become perhaps the most\nastute critic of that movement and to contribute to its refinement as\nlogical empiricism. As Hitler increased his power in Germany, Hempel,\nwho was not Jewish but did not support the Nazi regime, moved to\nBrussels and began collaborating with Paul Oppenheim, which would\nresult in several classic papers, including \u201cStudies in the\nLogic of Explanation\u201d, which appeared in 1948 (Rescher 2005:\nChs. 8 and 9). Hempel would also visit the United States\ntwice\u2014the University of Chicago in 1937\u201338 and then the\nCity College of New York in 1939\u201340, where he held his first\nacademic position\u2014and eventually became a naturalized\ncitizen.\n\nHe was productive throughout his career, publishing such important\npapers as \u201cThe Function of General Laws in History\u201d (1942)\nand \u201cStudies in the Logic of Confirmation\u201d,\n\u201cGeometry and Empirical Science\u201d, and \u201cThe Nature of\nMathematical Truth\u201d (all in 1945), before leaving City College\nfor Yale. While there, Hempel would publish \u201cProblems and\nChanges in the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning\u201d (1950) and\n\u201cThe Concept of Cognitive Significance: A Reconsideration\u201d\n(1951), as well as his first book, a volume in the International\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science, Fundamentals of Concept Formation\nin Empirical Science (1952). Hempel moved to Princeton in 1955,\nwhere his research program flourished and his influence upon\nprofessional philosophers became immense.\n\nDuring his two decades at Princeton, Hempel\u2019s approach dominated\nthe philosophy of science. His major articles during this interval\nincluded \u201cThe Theoretician\u2019s Dilemma\u201d (1958),\n\u201cInductive Inconsistencies\u201d (1960), \u201cRational\nAction\u201d (1961), and \u201cDeductive-Nomological vs. Statistical\nExplanation\u201d and \u201cExplanation in Science and in\nHistory\u201d and (both in 1962). A classic collection of his\nstudies, Aspects of Scientific Explanation (1965c), became a\nscholar\u2019s bible for generations of graduate students. His\nintroductory text, Philosophy of Natural Science (1966a),\nwould be translated into ten languages. Other articles he published\nthereafter included \u201cRecent Problems of Induction\u201d (1966b)\nand \u201cMaximal Specificity and Lawlikeness in Probabilistic\nExplanation\u201d (1968) as well as a series of studies that included\n\u201cOn the \u2018Standard Conception\u2019 of Scientific\nTheories\u201d (1970).\n\nAt the University of Pittsburgh following his mandatory retirement\nfrom Princeton in 1973, he continued to publish significant articles,\nincluding studies of the nature of scientific rationality,\n\u201cScientific Rationality: Analytic vs. Pragmatic\nPerspectives\u201d (1979), and \u201cTurns in the Evolution of the\nProblem of Induction\u201d (1981), and on the structure of scientific\ntheories, including, most importantly, \u201cLimits of a Deductive\nConstrual of the Function of Scientific Theories\u201d (1988a) as\nwell as \u201cProvisos: A Problem Concerning the Inferential Function\nof Scientific Theories\u201d (1988b), further enhancing his\nreputation by his willingness to reconsider earlier positions. After\nhis death in 1997, new collections of his papers appeared (Jeffrey\n2000; Fetzer 2001), which complemented studies of his research\n(Rescher 1969; Esler et al. 1985; Kitcher & Salmon 1989; Fetzer\n2000b).\n",
