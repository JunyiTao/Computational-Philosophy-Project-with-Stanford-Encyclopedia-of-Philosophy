    "main_text": "Philosophical ideas || God\n4.2 God\nAs shown by the examples just given, distinctive features of the Arabic Plotinus often have to do with the One or First Principle. In Arabic, the One is very clearly conceived as a creating God, frequently given epithets like \u2018originator\u2019 and \u2018creator.\u2019 On the other hand, the Arabic Plotinus acknowledges no tension between this idea of God as creator and the Plotinian metaphor of \u2018emanation\u2019 (Arabic words that mean \u2018emanation\u2019 or \u2018flowing,\u2019 such as fayd, are prominent throughout the text). In general the Arabic Plotinus agrees with Plotinus himself that God makes (creates) intellect directly, and then makes all other things \u2018through the intermediary of intellect\u2019 (on this see D\u2019Ancona 1992, Adamson 2002, 137\u201342). On the other hand, it has been noted that the Arabic version frequently assimilates Plotinian nous to the One. The Arabic version embraces the idea that the First Cause thinks or is an intellect\u2014an idea either rejected or mentioned only with great circumspection by Plotinus (see D\u2019Ancona 1997). Here we see the Arabic version undoing, to some extent, Plotinus\u2019 distinction between Aristotle\u2019s self-thinking intellective god and the truly first, highest principle. This also affects the way that the \u2018return to the One\u2019 is conceived: the Arabic Plotinus tends to conflate this with the idea of returning to Intellect (Somma 2021, 87).\nThis is only one example of the Arabic version\u2019s Aristotelianizing tendencies. Another case, again having to do with God, is a passage describing God as \u2018pure actuality\u2019 (al-fi\u2018l al-mahd, at Badawi 1955, 51-2) which intellect strives to imitate. This passage seems to betray the influence of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, book 12\u2014and here it is apposite to reiterate that the Kindi circle produced an Arabic version of that work. On the other hand, one might argue that in such passages the Arabic version simply brings out the Aristotelian aspects of Plotinus himself. After all, he too occasionally (especially in the unusual treatise Enneads VI.8) flirts with the idea that the One thinks or is to be described as actuality. And Porphyry famously remarks in his Life of Plotinus (\u00a714) that the whole of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics is present in compressed fashion in the Enneads.\nAristotle\u2019s views on god as actuality may have encouraged the author of the Arabic Plotinus in making the further claim that God is not just pure actuality, but pure being, in Arabic anniyya faqat (D'Ancona 2011b). The etymology of the term anniyya has been a matter of some debate, and the influence of the idea that God is \u2018pure being\u2019 has been traced as far forward as Aquinas (Taylor 1998).\nA final theological theme in the Arabic Plotinus is the notion of divine \u2018attributes\u2019 (sifat). Some passages in the text deny attributes to God, while others claim that the attributes can be ascribed to God \u2018in the manner of a cause\u2019 or \u2018in a higher way\u2019 (see e.g. Badawi 1955, 130, 156\u20137, 183, 185). It has been suggested that this theme relates to theological controversies in ninth century Islam (Adamson 2002, ch.5) or to the negative theology of the Pseudo-Dionysius (D\u2019Ancona 1995).\n",
