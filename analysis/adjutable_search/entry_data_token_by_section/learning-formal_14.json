The Long Run in the Short Run: Reliable and Stable Beliefs\n\nA longstanding criticism of convergence to the truth as an aim of\ninquiry is that, while fine in itself, this aim is consistent with any\ncrazy behaviour in the short run [Salmon 1991]. For example, we saw in\nthe New Riddle of Induction that a reliable projection rule can\nconjecture that the next emerald will be blue no matter how many green\nemeralds have been found\u2014as long as eventually the rule\nprojects \u201call emeralds are green\u201d. One response is that if\nmeans-ends analysis takes into account other epistemic aims in\naddition to long-run convergence, then it can provide\nstrong guidance for what to conjecture in the short run.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let us return to the Goodmanian Riddle of\nInduction. Ever since Plato, philosophers have considered the idea\nthat stable true belief is better than unstable true belief,\nand epistemologists such as Sklar [1975] have advocated similar\nprinciples of \u201cepistemic conservatism\u201d. Kuhn tells us that\na major reason for conservatism in paradigm debates is the cost of\nchanging scientific beliefs [Kuhn 1970]. In this spirit, learning\ntheorists have examined methods that minimize the number of times that\nthey change their theories before settling on their final conjecture\n[Putnam 1965, Kelly 1996, Jain 1999]. Such methods are said to\nminimize mind changes.\n",
