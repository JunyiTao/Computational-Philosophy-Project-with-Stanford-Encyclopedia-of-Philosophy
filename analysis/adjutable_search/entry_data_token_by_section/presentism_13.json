    "main_text": "Truth and Truth-Making || The Truth-Making Relation isn\u2019t Existence-Entailing\n6.3 The Truth-Making Relation isn\u2019t Existence-Entailing\n\nAll of this leads us to the final option that we will consider here.\nNamely, that the truth-maker relation isn\u2019t existence-entailing.\nThis kind of approach, described elsewhere as \u201cnefarious\u201d\n(contrasted with the \u201cupstanding\u201d project of locating\ntruth-makers), uses the language of truth-making without positing\ntruth-makers for truths about the past. In presenting the nefarious\nstrategy, we can treat it as something like the union of two theses:\n(1) truths about the past are expressed using primitive and\nunanalysable tense operators, and (2) tense operators don\u2019t pick\nout a distinctive ontological category or aspect of reality. This sort\nof nefarious approach has been pursued recently by Tallant (2009a),\nSanson & Caplan (2010), and Baia (2012), amongst others. The\nlabels (\u201cnefarious\u201d and \u201cupstanding\u201d) are due\nto a recent discussion by Tallant & Ingram (2015).\n\nTo clarify: nefarious \u201ccheats\u201d (like Tallant) will say\n\u201c<It was the case that p> is true, because it was the case\nthat p\u201d. \u201cWas\u201d is primitive and unanalysable, and\nthose adopting this position will agree that \u201cwas\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t pick out any ontology; it doesn\u2019t help us to speak\nof a distinctive metaphysical category. To that extent, those in this\n\u201cnefarious\u201d camp, will agree that there are truths about\nthe past, and will agree that how the world was makes true\nhow things are, but they deny that the ensuing truth-maker\n\u201crelation\u201d (such as it is) between the past and the\npresent (i.e., the true propositions) is existence-entailing. For\nsome, that might simply be considered treacherous. How might\npresentists motivate the nefarious position?\n\nOne key motivation involves a comparison with the\n\u201cupstanding\u201d approaches\n (\u00a76.1)\n and the first problem we raised, viz. getting the\n\u201cright results\u201d. If we think that there are truth-makers,\nthen we must ensure that the truth-making entities get things right.\nThat is, if the world contained a green banana, then it had always\nbetter be true, any time after the fact, that a truth-maker exists for\n<There was a green banana> (rather than, say, a truth-maker for\n<There was a red banana>, in the case where the world never\ncontained a red banana). But notice, then, that this seems to imply\nsome kind of \u201cfixing\u201d relation; how the world was\n(containing a green banana, not containing a red banana) serves to\n\u201cfix\u201d what truth-makers exist now.\n\u201cFixing\u201d is, plausibly, a relation. And, if x\nfixes y then, intuitively, both x and y\nmust exist; both relata of the fixing relation should exist. But on\nthe presentist picture, that\u2019s unacceptable. Past things\ndon\u2019t exist. In that case, the required \u201cfixing\u201d\nrelation isn\u2019t existence-entailing; it doesn\u2019t require the\nexistence of both relata. And, if that\u2019s right, then presentists\nmay as well \u201ccut out the middleman\u201d (so to speak) and\ntreat the truth-making relation as\n\u201cnon-existence-entailing\u201d and avoid any ontological\ninflation. Presentists don\u2019t require ontological commitment to\npresent truth-makers (ersatz times, Lucretian properties, etc.) for\ntruths about the past. They can do without. (See Ingram 2019:\n179\u201392 for critical discussion.)\n\nIs presentism out of the woods when it comes to the truth-maker\nobjection? It\u2019s unclear. For instance, we might retain the worry\nthat any relation must be existence-entailing and that what this shows\nis that we should give up on presentism (see, e.g., Baron 2013). And,\neven if we can solve the truth-maker objection, there\u2019s a\nclosely related concern that looks like it will raise further\nproblems. (We discuss the related concern in what remains of this\nsection.)\n",
