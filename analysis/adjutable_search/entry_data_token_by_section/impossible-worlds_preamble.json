    "main_text": "\n\nAccording to\n David Hume,\n the impossible cannot be conceived.\n Moritz Schlick\n claimed that the logically impossible, such as an explicit\ninconsistency, is simply unthinkable. Yet\n Hegel\n complained that it is \u201cone of the fundamental prejudices of\nlogic as hitherto understood\u201d that \u201cthe contradictory\ncannot be imagined or thought\u201d (Hegel 1831: 430). On this\napproach, our representational capabilities are not limited to the\npossible: we are able to conceive, describe, and sometimes even\nbelieve, impossibilities.\n\nThis entry is about impossibilities. In order to read it fruitfully,\nyou might also want to consult the entry on\n possible worlds.\n Many accounts of impossible worlds are best understood against the\nbackground of possible worlds theories \u2014 although symmetries and\nsimilarities can sometimes break down in important respects. (We will\nsee one in\n section 4\n below.) You might also want to look at the entry on\n modal logic\n to grasp some basic notions of worlds semantics.\n\nWe commonly speak of things being impossible in a relative\nsense. If you are stuck in a traffic jam in Paris Montparnasse at 2\nPM, and your flight is leaving from airport Charles De Gaulle at 2:30\nPM, you may moan: \u201cThere is no way that I can make it to the\nairport in time\u201d. What you mean is that, given the timing, the\nmeans of transport available, and other circumstances, it is\nimpossible for you to reach the airport in time. It is not absolutely\nimpossible: if you had Star Trek\u2019s transporter, you could make\nit.\n\nThis entry is about worlds that are not possible, with\n\u201cpossible\u201d understood in an unrestricted sense. Start with\nthe intuitive idea of the totality of possible worlds, which capture\nall and only the genuine possibilities. The worlds we are interested\nin are not in there. These worlds are often called logically\nimpossible worlds, as logical laws such as the Law of\nNon-Contradiction or the Law of Excluded Middle are assumed to be the\nmost general and topic-neutral: they are supposed to hold at all\npossible worlds. From now on, we are talking of impossible worlds\nsimpliciter, meaning worlds that are not possible with\nrespect to an unrestricted notion of possibility, however this is\nfurther characterized.\n\nA look at the rapidly growing literature on impossible worlds (see\nNolan 2013 for a survey) presents us with a number of definitions.\nThese can be reduced to four main items:\n\nImpossible Ways: just as possible worlds are often introduced\nintuitively by characterising them as ways things could have been, so\nare impossible worlds often characterized as ways things could not\nhave been. The initial insight is that not everything is possible,\nthat is, some things just (absolutely) cannot happen. Anything that\njust can\u2019t happen must be an absolute impossibility; and these\nways the world just couldn\u2019t be are impossible worlds (see e.g.\nSalmon 1984; Yagisawa 1988; Restall 1997; Beall and van Fraassen\n2003).\n\nLogic Violators: another definition has it that impossible\nworlds are worlds where the laws of logic fail (where these may be\ntheorems of the target logic, or its logical truths, or valid\nconsequences, etc.). This depends on what we take the laws of logic to\nbe. Given some logic L, an impossible world with respect to the L-laws\nis one in which some of those laws fail to hold (see e.g. Priest 2001,\nChapter 9). An impossible world in this second sense will be an\nimpossible world in the first sense, given that logical necessity is\nunrestricted. But not vice versa. Suppose it\u2019s metaphysically\nnecessary that the Mona Lisa (if it exists) was painted by da\nVinci. Then a world in which the Mona Lisa was painted by\nNeil Buchanan on Art Attack is an impossible world in the\nfirst sense but not in the second, for it does not violate any logical\nlaw.\n\nClassical Logic Violators: another definition has it that\nimpossible worlds are worlds where the laws of classical\nlogic fail (see e.g. Priest 1997a). A world complying with\n intuitionistic logic,\n and where instances of the Law of Excluded Middle fail, will be\nimpossible in the third sense.\n\nContradiction-Realizers: a still more specific definition has\nit that an impossible world is a world where sentences of the form\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold, against the Law of Non-Contradiction (see\ne.g. Lycan 1994). Impossible worlds of the fourth kind will be\nimpossible in the third sense, but not vice versa. Our intuitionistic\nworld above will have the Law of Non-Contradiction hold\nunrestrictedly: it will be impossible in the third, but not in the\nfourth sense.\n\nThese are all absolute notions of impossibility: in any of these\nsenses, a world is either possible or impossible. One may relativise\nthe notion, e.g. by allowing what counts as a law of logic to differ\nbetween worlds. Then (as Sandgren and Tanaka 2020 point out), one\nworld\u2019s laws may be a proper subset of the laws of a second world. In\nthis scenario, each world would be impossible relative to the other\n(since they differ in what they take the laws to be), even though the\nformer does not violate any of the laws of the latter. (See also\nTanaka 2018, 2022.) This relativised notion of logical impossibly is\nrelatively new and under-explored.\n",
