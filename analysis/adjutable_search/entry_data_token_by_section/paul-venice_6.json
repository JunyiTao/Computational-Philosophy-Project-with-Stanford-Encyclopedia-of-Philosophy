The Body-soul Problem and the Theory of Knowledge\n\nAccording to the standard medieval realist theories of knowledge, as\nexemplified by Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, the primary object of\nthe human intellect is the essence of material things. Such essences\nbecome intelligible to us only when our intellect has abstracted them\nfrom the individualising properties connected with the matter, so that\nwe can have direct knowledge of universals only. Yet, an intellective\nknowledge of individuals is possible, if the intellect, after\nabstracting the intelligible species through which it grasps essences,\nturns its attention to the phantasm from which it has drawn the\nintelligible species itself. This action, the conversion to phantasm,\nproduces a reflexive (that is, indirect) and incomplete knowledge of\nthe individual thing represented by the phantasm itself. On the other\nhand, according to the standard medieval nominalist theories of\nknowledge, as exemplified by Ockham, individuals alone are the object\nof our intellect, and the main form of human cognition is not the\nabstractive one, but intuitive cognition, which properly concerns the\nexistence and non-existence of individual things, as it is that\nimmediate apprehension of a thing (that is, an individual substance or\nquality) as existent which enables us to form a contingent proposition\nconcerning the existence of that same thing. By contrast, abstractive\nknowledge is an apprehension of terms by which it is impossible for us\nto have evidence of whether or not a certain thing exists. Thus,\nintuitive and abstractive cognition attain the same singular objects,\nbut in different ways, since abstractive cognition is indifferent to\nexistence and produces a universal sign of a multiplicity of\nsingulars.\n\nThese different epistemological explanations depend also on\ndifferences in ontology. According to medieval Realists, individuals\ncannot be the proper (not even a proper) and adequate object of\nknowledge for any intellect, since (1) their world includes common\nnatures or essences besides individual things; (2) individuals stem\nfrom species by means of prime matter (plus quantity); and (3) prime\nmatter is per se something opaque and unintelligible. Apart from the\nunsuitable theological consequences (how is it possible that God knows\nhuman beings perfectly, if every kind of individual is per se\nsomething not completely intelligible?), the realist account entails a\nparadox, as the phantasm already enables us to grasp the substance and\nthe accidental properties of an individual thing far before the\nconversion to itself which follows intellective cognition, because it\nis an appropriate image (or representation) of the particular material\nobject perceived by the senses. On the other hand, the punctum dolens\nof any nominalist description of the process of knowledge lies in the\ndifficulty in explaining the nature and origin of abstractive\ncognition and the relation which holds between the universal sign and\nthe individuals which it refers to\u2014how can they constitute a\nnatural set? How can we know under a universal form (universaliter)\nsomething which is in itself absolutely singular?\n\nIt is just in order to do away with the peculiar problems of the\nrealist paradigm that Paul of Venice worked out a new version of the\nstandard medieval realist theories of knowledge, critical of the most\ncommon solutions proper to his intellectual environment, and where\nmuch more stress is put on the question of class-membership, and on\nthe intellective cognition of individuals.\n\nAs to the problem of the relation of soul to body, Paul rejects the\nAugustinian conception and follows the Aristotelian view of the soul\nas form of the body, so that in his opinion the subject of knowledge\nis not the soul alone, but the whole human composite. Not even\nsensation can be attributed simply to the soul using a body, as\nAugustine had thought. Moreover, against Aristotle and following\nAquinas, Paul claims that, although it is the form of the body, the\nhuman soul is a self-subsistent form, and therefore incorruptible.\nHowever, unlike Aquinas, he maintains that the human soul is two-fold,\nas the complete human soul (anima totalis) derives from the close\nunion of two distinct principles, the cogitative and the intellective.\nThis fact does not break the unity of the human soul nor of the human\ncomposite, since (1) the cogitative principle is the cause of the\nanimality and the intellective one of the rationality of man; (2)\nneither of them can exist in man without the other; and (3) the\ncogitative soul is in potency in relation to the intellective one\n(Summa philosophiae naturalis, ed. Venetiis 1503 [=\nSN], pars v, ch. 5, fols. 68vb and 69ra; see also\nScriptum super libros De anima ed. Venetiis 1504 [= In De\nan.], II, t.c. 23, fols. 47rb-48ra).\n\nLike Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Paul maintains that there is a\nreal distinction between the soul and its faculties, but, in\nopposition to them, he holds that there is only a formal distinction\n(ratione et definitione) between the faculties themselves\n(SN, p. v, ch. 4, fol. 68ra-b). Whereas the faculties of the\ncogitative soul depend on bodily organs for their operations, the\nfaculties of the intellective soul, i.e. the active intellect, the\npassive intellect, and the will, are independent, even though in the\nstate of union with the body they need sensation for exercising their\npowers, and no act of sensation can be produced without the\nconcurrence of the body (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fols. 71va-72ra.).\nBesides the vegetative faculty (which regulates nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction) and the power of locomotion, the faculties of the\ncogitative soul are the following: the five exterior senses, the\ngeneral sense (sensus communis), the fantasy\n(phantasia), the vis aestimativa (or\ncogitativa properly so called), and the memory. Against\nAvicenna, Paul explicitly denies that there is a fifth internal sense,\nthe imagination, since he thinks that its presumed operations are the\nsame as those of the fantasy (SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol. 84ra).\nThe general sense distinguishes and collates the data of the special\nexterior senses. The fantasy conserves the species apprehended by\nsenses and freely combines them together to produce figments. The\ncogitativa recognizes those properties of things which cannot\nbe perceived through the senses, like, for example, that something is\nuseful for a certain purpose, or friendly, or unfriendly. The memory\nis the \u2018warehouse\u2019 where all the species are stored, so\nthat the cogitative soul can perform its tasks even without the\npresence of any material object (see SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol.\n84ra-va).\n\nAccording to Paul, the qualities which are the adequate and per se\nobject of the exterior senses cause a peculiar modification in the\nbodily organs, that is the presence in them of a forma\nintentionalis or species sensibilis, which does not\nimply any material mutation in the organ itself, as such a form is a\nresembling image (similitudo) of the real form which started\nthe process totally lacking extension, and therefore unable to modify\nin any way the matter of the bodily organs (cf. SN, p. v, ch.\n23, fol. 79va, and ch. 30, fol. 84rb). As a consequence, Paul affirms\nthat the species sensibilis is a pure form without matter in\na two-fold sense: it is not grounded on matter, and it has no\nextension. Yet, as a resembling image of a real form it contains in\nitself a sort of logical description of the matter to which the real\nform gives structure (see SN, p. v, ch. 23, fol. 79 vb). When the\nspecies meets the potentia sensitiva of the bodily organ, a\nsensation is produced, by means of which the soul becomes aware of the\nexternal existence of a certain reality (SN, p. v, ch. 28,\nfol. 83ra). This process is totally passive, as exterior senses can\ngive birth to sensations only in virtue of the actual presence of the\nmaterial object (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fol. 71va-b). The\nspecies sensibilis present in one of the exterior senses and\nthe species sensibilis present in the sensus\ncommunis (and in the other internal senses), differ specifically\n(specifice) from each other, since they are images of objects\nof different types. In fact, the species present in the general sense\nis a species of species, as it is not the logical image of the\nexternal quality which caused the process of sensation, but an image\nof the species present in the exterior sense (SN, p. v, ch.\n28, fol. 83ra). The higher level of sense-knowledge is therefore\nqualitatively distinct from the lower. At the higher level, every\npassage from a faculty to another entails a sort of purification of\nthe forma intentionalis, which progressively loses the\ninformation on the individual characteristics of the external object\n(SN, p. v, ch. 40, fol. 90va). So the perceived thing is\nfirst apprehended by the cogitativa as this singular bearer\nof certain properties, then as a bearer of certain properties, a\nchange that Paul qualifies as a transition from the condition of\nintentio singularis signata to the condition of intentio\nsingularis vaga (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb).\nNot only does the cogitativa effect the transformation of the\nintentio singularis signata into an intentio singularis\nvaga, it also abstracts the substance, which is a sensibile\nper accidens (something accidentally perceptible) from the\nperceived accidental properties which are sensibilia per se\n(perceptible by themselves\u2014In De an., III, t.c. 11,\nfol. 137rb; see also SN, p. v, ch. 11, fol. 72ra).\n\nAs we have already seen, in Nicoletti\u2019s view the phantasm is a\nrepresentation of the thing which started the process of knowing.\nAltough immaterial and free from any reference to the individualising\nproperties (of the thing at issue), the phantasm is not completely\nintelligible, since the intentio singularis vaga still\ncontains a sort of logical description of the generic matter which the\nsingular thing is made of, and through it to the general conditions\nfor individuation. For example, when we apprehend Socrates as a man,\nwe know human essence just as instantiated by a singular item, and not\nin itself, as a specific type. In order to have the concept of man,\nthere is need of a further and higher activity on the part of the\nsoul, which has to abstract from the phantasm the universal or\nintelligible species, which applies to all men. This further activity\nis the proper action of the active intellect, which illumines both the\nphantasm and the possible intellect, so impressing on the latter the\nspecies intelligibilis abstracted from the former (In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb).\n\nAs for the possible (or passive) intellect, according to Nardi,\nRuello, and Kuksewicz, Paul was an Averroist, as he would have\nsupported the thesis of the unicity and separate character of such an\nintellect for the whole human species. But this is false. On the\ncontrary, Paul\u2019s point of view for this question is close to\nthat of Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments against the unicity of the\npassive intellect he utilizes in his commentaries on the De\nanima and on the Metaphysics (after 1420). If his\naffirmations in the Summa philosophiae naturalis are a bit\nambiguous and it is therefore possible to miss their deepest meaning,\nin these two Aristotelian commentaries he clearly rejects all the main\ntheses of later medieval Averroism (see Amerini, 2012). He thinks that\n(1) the claim of the unicity of the possible intellect for the whole\nhuman species is lacking in a solid philosophical basis, since it can\nbe maintained from the physical point of view only, according to which\neverything is considered qua affected-by or connected-with motion, but\n(2) it is false from the metaphysical point of view, which is the most\ncomprehensive of all. From this viewpoint, according to which the\npossible intellect has to be considered a substantial form (and more\nprecisely, the form of the human body), it is evident that it has a\nbeginning in time, but certainly not an end, and that, like any other\nmaterial substantial form, it is multiplied according to the\nmultiplication of bodies, since one and the same principle in number\ncannot be the form of a multiplicity of substances. Furthermore, given\nthat different men can form different opinions about the same thing or\nevent, one and the same intellect could hold contradictory views at\nonce, in apparent violation of the law of contradiction (see In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 149ra).\n\nIn the SN Paul had spoken of the active intellect in terms of\na separated substance. The active intellect is connected to the\npossible intellect and the human soul by inherence and to the phantasm\nas the phantasm is directly present before it (cf. SN, p. v,\nch. 38, fol. 89ra). On the contrary, in the commentary on the De\nanima, he (1) identifies the active intellect with God Himself,\nconsidered as the first cause, and its own activity with God\u2019s\nactivity of illumination in and outside the soul, and (2) affirms that\nthe active intellect is joined to the possible intellect neither by\ninherence nor by information, but as a form directly present in it\n(In De an., III, t.c. 19, fol. 143ra). This fact explains why\nthe first of the four main effects produced by the active intellect is\nset in the external world, and the fourth one both in the external\nworld and in the human mind. In turn, the mutual connections and\ndistinctive features of the actions performed by the active intellect\nexplain why (1) individuals are proper objects of intellection for us;\n(2) the intelligible species is singular and not universal; and (3)\nthe same intelligible species by means of which we grasp substantial\nessences is the medium in virtue of which we can understand the\npeculiar structure of the individual which instantiates that essence\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols. 136vb and 137rb-va)\u2014all\ntheses which are just the opposite of the most common realist\nconvictions on the matter, as Paul himself points out (In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 137va).\n\nAs a consequence, he explicitly polemicizes with Giles of Rome and\nThomas Aquinas on the problem of the cognition of individuals. He sums\nup their position in four theses, accepts the first one, and argues\nagainst the last three. The four theses are the following:\n\nthe primary object of our intellect is the quidditas\nrei;\nthe first intelligible species produced in our intellect is\nuniversal (that is, it enables us to know a common item) and\nabstract;\nsingulars are known only after the intellection of the\nuniversal;\nsingulars are not directly known by our intellect, but indirectly\nby reflection (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 136vb).\n\n\nAs far as the second thesis is concerned, Paul thinks that the first\nintelligible species present in our mind is about a singular item and\nenables us to know it, as the first intelligible species is drawn from\nthe phantasm, which is formally and per se the mental representation\nof an individual item, and therefore singular itself (phantasma\nest intentio singularis). The third and fourth theses are\nquestioned together. Paul raises two main objections against them. The\nfirst one runs as follows: if we can know the individual which causes\nthe process of intellection only after the cognition of the universal,\nthen something in the cognition of the universal functions as a medium\nfor this new apprehension. It cannot be the universal itself, as it is\nnot more similar to this individual than to any other; so it must be\nsomething singular, distinct from the universal and added to it. But,\nif so, then this singular is to be known per se and directly (because\nif per accidens and/or indirectly, then only in virtue of something\nelse, which in turn would become the new medium for the cognition of\nthe individual, and so on) far before the conversion to the phantasm,\nwhich is therefore totally superfluous. The second objection is even\nmore articulated. Paul observes that, if our intellect apprehends the\nsingular thing which starts the process of understanding only by means\nof the conversion to the phantasm, then the phantasm acts upon the\nintellect, impressing an image (or species) on it. If the image\nimpressed is universal, then the passive intellect cannot apprehend\nany singular thing by means of it; as a consequence, it can only be\nparticular; but in this case the phantasm performs just the same\naction as before the conversion to itself, which is therefore\nredundant. Nor can one say that the phantasm does not act upon the\npassive intellect, because in this case the conversion to it would be\neven more unnecessary, if possible, and material items would be known\nby us in the same way as God and the (angelic) intelligences, which\nare immaterial (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols.\n136vb-137ra).\n\nAs is evident, the Italian master is aware of the paradox entailed by\nthe standard realist account of human knowledge and his theory is a\nserious attempt to avoid it. Paul refuses Aquinas\u2019s and\nGiles\u2019s views since they imply that the intellectual\napprehension of the universal essence, because of its two-fold\nrelation to the phantasm, at once presupposes the sense-apprehension\nof the individual thing (which instantiates that essence) and is\npresupposed by the intellectual apprehension of the individual thing.\nSince at the level of sense-apprehension of individual items the human\nsoul, through the cogitativa, is already able to recognize\nthe substance (of those individual things), the intellectual\napprehension cannot in any way add new information on the res\nat issue and must be totally identical with the sense-apprehension. As\na consequence, instead of elaborating an interpretative pattern of\nhuman knowledge based on the form of the spiral, where the same things\ncome back to our soul at different moments in the process of\nabstraction, Paul tacitly develops in an original way some suggestions\ndrawn from Walter Burley\u2019s prologue to his last commentary on\nthe Physics. In criticizing Averroes\u2019s thesis that the\nquidditas of material things is the primary object of our\nunderstanding and the material and individual things themselves a\nsecondary object, Paul explains our knowledge in terms of a sort of\nstraight line which proceeds from the most superficial to the deepest\nlevels of reality, and states that our intellect is equally apt to\nreceive both universal and singular species, and, as a consequence,\nthat it is apt to know both common essences and singular things\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 136va-b).\n\nThis solution introduces the chief thesis of the nominalist approach\nto epistemology (the direct knowledge of individuals) into a realist\ncontext; nevertheless it is consistent with the metaphysical\npresuppositions proper to the late medieval realist way of thought.\nWith the noteworthy exception of Walter Burley, according to any late\nmedieval Realist, in the extramental world universal essences and\nindividual things come together, since they are really identical and\nonly formally distinct, although universal essence belongs to a deeper\nlevel of reality. In a certain way they are two different aspects of\nthe same thing. This fact explains what happens in the process of\nknowledge according to Paul: since the intelligible species is\ndirectly connected with the essence of a thing and indirectly, by\nmeans of the phantasm, with the singular thing itself (cf. In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb), our intellect grasps the\nuniversal essence and the individual thing at the same time, so that\nboth of them are the primary objects of our mind, even though the\nuniversal essence is the primary object by nature (primitate\nnaturae \u2013 In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137va; see\nalso SN, p. v, ch. 39, fol. 90va).\n",
