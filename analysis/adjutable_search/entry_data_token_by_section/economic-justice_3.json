    "main_text": "Inequality and Poverty Measurement\n2. Inequality and Poverty Measurement\n\nFocusing traditionally on income inequality and poverty, this field\nhas been first built on the assumption that there is a given\nunidimensional measure of individual advantage. The gist of the\nanalysis is then about the distribution of this particular notion of\nadvantage.\n\nMore recently, partly due to the emergence of data about living\nconditions, there has been growing interest in the measurement of\ninequality and poverty when individual situations are described by a\nmultidimensional list of attributes or deprivations. This has\ngenerated the field of \u201cmultidimensional inequality and poverty\nmeasurement\u201d.\n\nSo far most of this literature has remained disconnected from the\nwelfare economics literature in which interpersonal comparisons of\nwell-being in relation to individual preferences is a key issue. The\ntypical multidimensional indices do not refer to well-being or\npreferences. But the connection is being made and the welfare\neconomics literature will eventually blend with the inequality and\npoverty measurement literature.\n\nExcellent surveys of the unidimensional part of the theory include:\nChakravarty (1990, 2009), Cowell (2000), Dutta (2002), Lambert (1989),\nSen and Foster (1997), Silber (1999). The multidimensional approach is\nsurveyed or discussed in Weymark (2006), Chakravarty (2009), Decancq\nand Lugo (2013), Aaberge and Brandolini (2015), Alkire et al. (2015),\nDuclos and Tiberti (2016). The link between inequality and poverty\nmeasurement and welfare economics is discussed in Decancq et al.\n(2015) and in several chapters of Adler and Fleurbaey (2016). For a\ncomprehensive handbook on economic inequality, see Atkinson and\nBourguignon (2000, 2015).\n",
