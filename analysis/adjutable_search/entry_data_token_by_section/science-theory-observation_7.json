    "main_text": "Theory and value ladenness || Semantics\n3.3 Semantics\n\nKuhn argued that theoretical commitments exert a strong influence on\nobservation descriptions, and what they are understood to mean (Kuhn\n1962, 127ff; Longino 1979, 38\u201342). If so, proponents of a caloric\naccount of heat won\u2019t describe or understand descriptions of\nobserved results of heat experiments in the same way as investigators\nwho think of heat in terms of mean kinetic energy or radiation. They\nmight all use the same words (e.g., \u2018temperature\u2019) to\nreport an observation without understanding them in the same way. This\nposes a potential problem for communicating effectively across\nparadigms, and similarly, for attributing the appropriate significance\nto empirical results generated outside of one\u2019s own linguistic\nframework.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that observers do not always use\ndeclarative sentences to report observational and experimental\nresults. Instead, they often draw, photograph, make audio recordings,\netc. or set up their experimental devices to generate graphs,\npictorial images, tables of numbers, and other non-sentential records.\nObviously investigators\u2019 conceptual resources and theoretical\nbiases can exert epistemically significant influences on what they\nrecord (or set their equipment to record), which details they include\nor emphasize, and which forms of representation they choose (Daston\nand Galison 2007, 115\u2013190,\n309\u2013361). But disagreements about the epistemic\nimport of a graph, picture or other non-sentential bit of data often\nturn on causal rather than semantical considerations. Anatomists may\nhave to decide whether a dark spot in a micrograph was caused by a\nstaining artifact or by light reflected from an anatomically\nsignificant structure. Physicists may wonder whether a blip in a\nGeiger counter record reflects the causal influence of the radiation\nthey wanted to monitor, or a surge in ambient radiation. Chemists may\nworry about the purity of samples used to obtain data. Such questions\nare not, and are not well represented as, semantic questions to which\nsemantic theory loading is relevant. Late 20th century\nphilosophers may have ignored such cases and exaggerated the influence\nof semantic theory loading because they thought of theory testing in\nterms of inferential relations between observation and theoretical\nsentences.\n\nNevertheless, some empirical results are reported as declarative\nsentences. Looking at a patient with red spots and a fever, an\ninvestigator might report having seen the spots, or measles symptoms,\nor a patient with measles. Watching an unknown liquid dripping into a\nlitmus solution an observer might report seeing a change in color, a\nliquid with a PH of less than 7, or an acid. The appropriateness of a\ndescription of a test outcome depends on how the relevant concepts are\noperationalized. What justifies an observer to report having observed\na case of measles according to one operationalization might require\nher to say no more than that she had observed measles symptoms, or\njust red spots according to another.\n\nIn keeping with Percy Bridgman\u2019s view that\n\n\u2026 in general, we mean by a concept nothing more than a set of\noperations; the concept is synonymous with the corresponding sets of\noperations (Bridgman 1927, 5)\n\n\none might suppose that operationalizations are definitions or meaning\nrules such that it is analytically true, e.g., that every liquid that\nturns litmus red in a properly conducted test is acidic. But it is\nmore faithful to actual scientific practice to think of\noperationalizations as defeasible rules for the application of a\nconcept such that both the rules and their applications are subject to\nrevision on the basis of new empirical or theoretical developments. So\nunderstood, to operationalize is to adopt verbal and related practices\nfor the purpose of enabling scientists to do their work.\nOperationalizations are thus sensitive and subject to change on the\nbasis of findings that influence their usefulness (Feest 2005).\n\nDefinitional or not, investigators in different research traditions\nmay be trained to report their observations in conformity with\nconflicting operationalizations. Thus instead of training observers to\ndescribe what they see in a bubble chamber as a whitish streak or a\ntrail, one might train them to say they see a particle track or even a\nparticle. This may reflect what Kuhn meant by suggesting that some\nobservers might be justified or even required to describe themselves\nas having seen oxygen, transparent and colorless though it is, or\natoms, invisible though they are (Kuhn 1962, 127ff). To the contrary,\none might object that what one sees should not be confused with what\none is trained to say when one sees it, and therefore that talking\nabout seeing a colorless gas or an invisible particle may be nothing\nmore than a picturesque way of talking about what certain\noperationalizations entitle observers to say. Strictly speaking, the\nobjection concludes, the term \u2018observation report\u2019 should\nbe reserved for descriptions that are neutral with respect to\nconflicting operationalizations.\n\nIf observational data are just those utterances that meet\nFeyerabend\u2019s decidability and agreeability conditions, the\nimport of semantic theory loading depends upon how quickly, and for\nwhich sentences reasonably sophisticated language users who stand in\ndifferent paradigms can non-inferentially reach the same decisions\nabout what to assert or deny. Some would expect enough agreement to\nsecure the objectivity of observational data. Others would not. Still\nothers would try to supply different standards for objectivity.\n\nWith regard to sentential observation reports, the significance of\nsemantic theory loading is less ubiquitous than one might expect. The\ninterpretation of verbal reports often depends on ideas about causal\nstructure rather than the meanings of signs. Rather than worrying\nabout the meaning of words used to describe their observations,\nscientists are more likely to wonder whether the observers made up or\nwithheld information, whether one or more details were artifacts of\nobservation conditions, whether the specimens were atypical, and so\non.\n\nNote that the worry about semantic theory loading extends beyond\nobservation reports of the sort that occupied the logical empiricists\nand their close intellectual descendents. Combining results of diverse\nmethods for making proxy measurements of paleoclimate temperatures in\nan epistemically responsible way requires careful attention to the\nvariety of operationalizations at play. Even if no \u2018observation\nreports\u2019 are involved, the sticky question about how to usefully\nmerge results obtained in different ways in order to satisfy\none\u2019s epistemic aims remains. Happily, the remedy for the worry\nabout semantic loading in this broader sense is likely to be the\nsame\u2014investigating the provenance of those results\nand comparing the variety of factors that have contributed to their\ncausal production.\n\nKuhn placed too much emphasis on the discontinuity between evidence\ngenerated in different paradigms. Even if we accept a broadly Kuhnian\npicture, according to which paradigms are heterogeneous collections of\nexperimental practices, theoretical principles, problems selected for\ninvestigation, approaches to their solution, etc., connections between\ncomponents are loose enough to allow investigators who disagree\nprofoundly over one or more theoretical claims to nevertheless agree\nabout how to design, execute, and record the results of their\nexperiments. That is why neuroscientists who disagreed about whether\nnerve impulses consisted of electrical currents could measure the same\nelectrical quantities, and agree on the linguistic meaning and the\naccuracy of observation reports including such terms as\n\u2018potential\u2019, \u2018resistance\u2019,\n\u2018voltage\u2019 and \u2018current\u2019. As we discussed\nabove, the success that scientists have in repurposing results\ngenerated by others for different purposes speaks against the\nconfinement of evidence to its native paradigm. Even when scientists\nworking with radically different core theoretical commitments cannot\nmake the same measurements themselves, with enough contextual\ninformation about how each conducts research, it can be possible to\nconstruct bridges that span the theoretical divides.\n",
