    "main_text": "\n\nHarry A. Wolfson once described medieval philosophy as one\n\u201cwhich placed itself at the service of Scriptures\u201d\n(Philo, II, p. 439). From a formal aspect, a new genre was\ncreated: \u201cFrom now on, a new form of exposition appears in\nphilosophic literature, the homily on some scriptural text, or the\nrunning commentary upon some scriptural books\u201d (p. 444). Joseph\nibn Kaspi perfectly illustrates this characterization of the medieval\nphilosopher. He wrote some thirty works dedicated to explaining the\nBible, in which philosophy served as a method and a compendium of\nphilosophical conclusions, which the biblical author wanted to convey\nto the reader. Some of Kaspi\u2019s works were devoted to logic and\nlinguistics as methods suitable for biblical exegesis; others were\ncommentaries on books of the Bible, or super-commentaries and he also\nwrote on theological subjects. Of this vast work, only some has been\npublished; much remains in manuscript form, and some has apparently\nbeen lost.\n",
