    "main_text": "Just War Doctrine\n5. Just War Doctrine\n\nAs the title of his magnum opus implies, the normative status\nof war was of paramount concern to Grotius. The common distinction\nbetween ius ad bellum and ius in bello\u2014the\ndistinction between the rightful causes of war versus the rightful\nconduct of war\u2014is useful for understanding his views. Regarding\nius ad bellum, Grotius devotes DIP Chap. Three and\nDIB I.2 to the question of whether it is ever lawful to wage\nwar. He argues that war is not only compatible with but sometimes\ncompelled by all three major kinds of law\u2014the law of nature, the\nlaw of nations or international law, and divine law. In support of his\nanswer, he adduces a number of conceptual, historical and theological\narguments. It would be tendentious to recount all of them, so take\njust one influential example of the first sort:\n\n\nHe who wills the attainment of a given end, wills also the things that\nare necessary to that end. God wills that we should protect ourselves,\nretain our hold on the necessities of life, obtain that which is our\ndue, punish transgressors, and at the same time defend the\nstate\u2026 But these divine objectives sometimes constitute causes\nfor undertaking and carrying on war\u2026 Thus it is God\u2019s\nWill that certain wars should be waged\u2026 Yet no one will deny\nthat whatsoever God will, is just. Therefore, some wars are just.\n(DIP Chap. Three)\n\n\nFar from believing that war is a condition outside the realm of\nmorality and law, Grotius took it to be an instrument of right (cf.\nDumbauld 1969: 73). As he wrote, \u201cwhere judicial settlement\nfails, war begins\u201d (DIB II.1.2.1). Wars may be justly\nundertaken in response either to \u201cwrongs not yet committed, or\nto wrongs already done\u201d (ibid.). The list of wrongs which\njustify war is long, including the inflicting of punishment (ibid.),\nself-defense (II.1.3), the defense of chastity (II.1.7), etc. At the\nsame time as he countenances war, Grotius does set limits, some of\nthem controversial. For example, he argues that one doesn\u2019t have\nthe right to defend oneself against an assailant who is \u201cuseful\nto many\u201d (II.1.9.1). This principle applies to both individuals\nand states. So it follows that both individuals and states may be\nobliged to acquiesce when attacked by someone important to\nsociety\u2014whether the society of a single nation or the society of\nnations. Overall, it has been argued, what sets Grotius\u2019\nanalysis of ius ad bellum apart from his predecessors is\n\u201cin his detailed and systematic elaboration of the \u2018just\ncauses\u2019 of war\u2019\u201d (Draper 1990: 194).\n\nEven supposing that a war has been undertaken rightly, it must also be\nfought rightly for it to be just. And here we come to ius in\nbello, a topic treated in DIB III. Grotius begins by\nsetting three rules governing the conduct of war (DIB\nIII.1.2\u20134), the first and most basic of which is that \u201cIn\nwar things which are necessary to attain the end in view are\npermissible\u201d (III.1.2). This obviously places wide limits on\npermissible conduct, though it isn\u2019t as chilling as a first\nreading might suggest, for the necessity requirement can be hard to\nmeet. After advancing these rules, Grotius considers the\npermissibility of a large number of actions. The variety and amount of\ndetail in this discussion is fascinating. Typical is his analysis of\nruses, deceit and falsehood. Not only does he distinguish between\nthose three ways of conveying false impressions but also he\ndistinguishes variations within each of them (see III.1.6\u201320).\nFor example, if deceit is a genus, then deceit in a negative action is\none species (III.1.7) and deceit in a positive action is another\n(III.1.8). And deceit in a positive action can in turn be divided into\ntwo sub-species (ibid.). The practical aims of DIB come\nthrough plainly here and throughout Book III, where the priority seems\nto be clarifying what exactly is and is not permissible in war by\nconsidering a large number of actions which could belligerents could\nundertake and determining their moral and legal standing. In general,\nGrotius held that war is justifiable when, and only when, it serves\nright. Since the conditions for service to right are numerous and\nnon-obvious, he must expend considerable effort identifying and\nexplicating them (for more, see Draper 1990: 191\u2013207).\n",
