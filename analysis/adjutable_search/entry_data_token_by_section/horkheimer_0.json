    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nMax Horkheimer was born into a conservative Jewish family on February\n14, 1895, the only son of Moritz and Babette Horkheimer. A successful\nand respected businessman who owned several textile factories in the\nZuffenhausen district of Stuttgart (where Max was born), Moritz\nHorkheimer expected his son to follow in his footsteps. Thus Max was\ntaken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he\neventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin\ntwo relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he\nmet Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic\ncolleague, and who would remain Max\u2019s closest friend. He also\nmet Rose Riekher, who was his father\u2019s personal secretary. Eight\nyears Max\u2019s senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower\nclass, Riekher (whom Max called \u201cMaidon\u201d) was not\nconsidered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max\nand Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in\n1969 (Wiggershaus 1994, p. 41\u201344).\n\nIn the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer\nbegan studies at the University of Munich, and transferred to the\nUniversity of Frankfurt a semester later. At Frankfurt he studied\npsychology and philosophy, the latter with the neo-Kantian philosopher\nHans Cornelius. He also spent a year, on Cornelius\u2019s\nrecommendation, studying in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl. After an\nabortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology,\nHorkheimer, with Cornelius\u2019s direction, completed his doctorate\nin philosophy with a dissertation titled The Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment. Upon completion of the degree he was\noffered an assistantship under Cornelius, and thus definitively set\noff on an academic career rather than continuing in his father\u2019s\nbusiness. In 1925 Horkheimer completed his Habilitation with a work\ntitled Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment as a Link between\nTheoretical and Practical Philosophy, and took a position as\nPrivatdozent, or lecturer, at Frankfurt. During this time he\nwould lecture extensively on 18th and 19th Century philosophy, with\nhis research interests moving more in line with Marxian themes\n(Wiggershaus 1994, p. 44\u201347).\n\nThe most important moments of Horkheimer\u2019s early academic career\nwould come in 1930. In July he was appointed Professor of Social\nPhilosophy at Frankfurt, and in October made the director of the\nInstitut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung (Institute of Social\nResearch). The Institute began as a Marxist study group started by\nFelix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who\nused his inheritance to fund an institution that would support his\nleftist academic aims. Along with Pollock (who also completed a\ndoctorate in Frankfurt, writing on Marx), Horkheimer became acquainted\nwith Weil, and took part in the activities of the Institute from the\nbeginning. The Institute formally opened in 1924 under the direction\nof the Austrian Marxist scholar Carl Gr\u00fcnberg, who became ill\nquickly after taking the post. While Pollock was more closely\nassociated with the Institute during the Gr\u00fcnberg period, he\nsupported his friend for the directorship (on the early history of the\nInstitute, see Jay 1996, ch. 1). On January 24, 1931, Horkheimer\ndelivered his inaugural lecture for the chair of social philosophy and\ndirectorship of the Institute, titled \u201cThe Present Situation of\nSocial Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social\nResearch.\u201d This lecture, and several essays written by\nHorkheimer in the early 1930s, would develop a conception of\ninterdisciplinary social research that was meant to guide the\nactivities of the institute during Horkheimer\u2019s tenure as\ndirector.\n\nThis program was obstructed from the very beginning by\nsocial-political unrest. In the time between Horkheimer\u2019s being\nnamed Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in\n1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In\nthe midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis\u2019 rise,\nHorkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of\nmoving the Institute out of Germany. Shortly after Hitler was named\nChancellor in 1933, the Institute in Frankfurt was closed and its\nbuilding seized by the Gestapo. Horkheimer was also relieved of his\nprofessorship and directorship in early 1933, and relocated to Geneva,\nwhere the Institute had opened a satellite office. In 1934 Horkheimer\nmoved to New York, where one of Pollock\u2019s assistants had been\nnegotiating an agreement for the Institute with the department of\nsociology at Columbia University. In July of 1934 Horkheimer accepted\nan offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their\nbuildings. Having received American citizenship in 1940, Horkheimer\nwould continue to live and work largely in New York until 1941, when\nhe moved to the Los Angeles area (for a thorough history of the\ndevelopment of Horkheimer\u2019s thought up to this point, see\nAbromeit 2011). With the Institute splintering between New York and\nCalifornia, Horkheimer concentrated his energies on his own work,\nincluding the collaborative efforts with Theodor Adorno that produced\nDialectic of Enlightenment.\n\nWith the end of WWII, Horkheimer gradually considered moving back to\nGermany. In April 1948, he returned to Europe for the first time, to\nlecture in various cities, including as a visiting professor in\nFrankfurt. His full return to Germany would follow shortly, and in\nJuly 1949 he was restored to his professorship at the University of\nFrankfurt. The following year the Institute would return as well.\nAfter returning, Horkheimer would focus on administrative work,\nreestablishing the Institute and serving two terms as University\nRector in the early 1950s. In 1953 he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of\nthe City of Frankfurt, and would later be named honorary citizen of\nFrankfurt for life. His academic activities also continued throughout\nthe 1950s, and included a period during which he served as a regular\nvisiting professor at the University of Chicago. His work would slow,\nhowever, once he retired in 1958 to the Swiss town of Montagnola. Max\nHorkheimer passed away on July 7, 1973, at the age of 78.\n",
