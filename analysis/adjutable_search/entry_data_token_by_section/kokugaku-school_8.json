They were among the enthusiastic followers of\nAtsutane\u2019s teachings on spirits and the spirit world of\nkakuriyo or y\u016bmeikai. Of the eighteen students\nwho registered with the academy from Hirosaki, group leader and\nmerchant-class poet Tsuruya Ariyo (1808\u201371), along with\nclassmate and friend Hirao Rosen (1808\u201380), a merchant-class\npainter and scholar, were especially interested in the realm of\nspirits that affect the visible world of human beings. \n\nRosen\u2019s most important scholarly writings are devoted to\nintroducing the strange and mysterious phenomena witnessed in his\ncastle town and neighboring villages and landscape. His New\nTreatise on the Spirit Realm (Y\u016bfu shinron)\ncompleted in 1865 cites the teachings of Atsutane on the invisible\nkakuriyo spirit realm and utilizes these to explain\npreviously inexplicable events in his community. Rosen asserts such\nobjectives of his most seminal work: \n\n\nI write all that I have collected from here and there over the years\nregarding matters of spirits (kishin), and wish to show it to\nmy friends, people who are unaware of gods (kami), and reveal\nto them the notable evidence of their great spiritual power, which\nmust be feared and respected \u2026 (from Y\u016bfu shinron,\nquoted in Fujiwara 2021: 145)\n\n\nIn New Treatise on the Spirit Realm, Rosen attributes\nsightings of the deceased to the actions of the souls of these\ndead. Moreover, he reasons that thunder and lightning are the work of\ndeities.\n\nLikewise, Ariyo relies on Atsutane\u2019s theories of the invisible\nother world to explain how human lives and the local land are governed\nby spirits. Ariyo\u2019s waka poems express reverence for\nthe deities of the Japanese tradition who protect and rule over Mount\nIwaki and the surrounding terrain. He asserts the reality of their\nspirit realm in the following verses:\n\n\nThough invisible \n Tadabito no \n\nto the eye of common people, \n me ni wa mienedo \n\nhow can one doubt \n Iwaki ne no \n\nthe spirit realm of gods \n kami no y\u016bfu wo \n\nof the Iwaki peaks? \n utagau beshi ya\n\n (from Iwaki san sanbyaku shu, quoted in Fujiwara 2021: 159)\n\n\nIn his seminal treatise, Enjoyment Visible and Invisible\nor Ken\u2019y\u016b rakuron, completed in 1867, Ariyo argues\nthat these deities should be revered, worshiped, and served not only\nduring one\u2019s lifetime, but even after death when people become\nspirits dwelling in the otherworld. Ariyo encourages people to live\nlife with a positive outlook and to embrace enjoyment both while on\nearth and also in the afterlife.\n\nAs Rosen and Ariyo continued their inquiry into spirits and the spirit\nrealm, the Meiji Restoration was proclaimed. As a result, their domain of\nHirosaki faced political turmoil and was forced to take a stance in\nthe Boshin War of 1868 to 1869. A fellow Hirata disciple and domainal\nsamurai fought and died for the emperor\u2019s army. Shinto priests of\ntheir circle conducted a funerary ritual to \u201ccall back\u201d and venerate\nthe spirits of these fallen soldiers. In the early years of the Meiji\nperiod, members of the Tsugaru Group variously celebrated the\nRestoration of Imperial rule, carried out religious reforms of the\nstate, continued kokugaku studies, and struggled with the\nrapid changes of a modern society. \n",
