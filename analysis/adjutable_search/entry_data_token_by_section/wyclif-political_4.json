Divine Dominium: Creating, Lending, and Grace\n\n\nThe relation of universal to particular defines Wyclif's conception of\nhow God's dominium causes all instances of dominium\nin creation. Divine dominium is \u201cthe standard prior to and\npresupposition of all other dominium; if a creature has\ndominium over anything, God already has dominium\nover it, so any created dominium follows upon divine\ndominium\u201d (De Dominio Divino I, ch. 3,\np.16.18\u201322). This relation exceeds mere exemplarity, where human\ndominium only imitates God's dominium without divine\ncausal determination. God's dominium has causal efficacy over\nall instances of human mastery such that no true created\ndominium is possible without direct participation in and\nconstant reliance upon God's dominium. The instrument through\nwhich divine dominium moves is grace, which instills in human\nrulers an essential love defining their every ruling action. Thus,\nevery case of just human dominium entails a constant reliance\nupon grace as the hallmark of its being an instantiation of God's\nuniversal dominium.  \n\n\nGod's dominium has six aspects, three identifiable with\nlordship's ruling element (creation, sustenance, and governance), and\nthree that define lordship's proprietary nature (giving, receiving,\nand lending) (De Dominio Divino III, ch. 1,\n p.198.9).7\n The necessary precondition for an act of dominium is\ncreation, of which no created being is capable. This makes God's\ndominium the only true instance of dominium and the\nsource of all created instances of dominium. Because the\nDivine Ideas and their created correlates, the universals, are\nontologically prior to particular created beings, God's\ndominium over universals is prior to His dominium\nover particulars. This means that God creates, sustains, and governs\nthe human species prior to ruling over \u2014 and knowing \u2014\nindividual people. This led to questions about determinism that served\nas a starting point for many refutations of Wyclif's theology.  \n\n\nThe second set of acts that define dominium \u2014 giving,\nreceiving, and lending \u2014 provides the foundation for Wyclif's\nargument that all created dominium necessarily requires\ngrace. God's giving of the divine essence in creating is the truest\nform of giving because God is giving of Himself through Himself, which\nno created being can do. Nor can any created being receive as God\nreceives; God truly receives only from Himself through His giving. God\ngives up nothing in His giving, and acquires nothing in His receiving;\ncreation is God's self-expression, an act in which the divine essence\nis neither decreased nor increased. The crucial act from the created\nstandpoint is God's lending, for here there is real interaction\nbetween Lord and subjects. What human beings as conscious participants\nin God's lending relation can claim as their own is lent to them by\ndivine authority, which they enjoy through grace.  \n\n\nIt is easy to confuse giving with lending because a lord who has only\nbeen \u201clent\u201d a gift of God for use during his lifetime appears to have\nbeen \u201cgiven\u201d that gift. God's giving is communicative, not\ntranslative. For us, most giving is translative in that it involves\nthe giver's surrender of every connection to the gift, making it\nnatural for us to suppose that God renounces His authority over what\nHe gives us. In fact, God's giving is communicative, which does not\ninvolve surrender of the gift. Because all that God gives to creation\nwill ultimately return to Him, it makes more sense to speak of God's\ngiving as lending.\n With any instance of lending, Wyclif explains, the lender seeks\nassurance that the borrower truly deserves what is to be lent. Human\ndesert of the dominium they are lent is a matter of some\ncomplexity involving examination of the theological concept of grace.\nWhen a temporal lord lends his subject according to the subject's\nworthiness, the subject's merit is commensurable with the lord's, and\nthe mutual agreement defining the loan can be made according to the\nrespective merit of each party. The merit that allows the subject\ndesert of consideration for the loan is \u201ccondigna\u201d, i.e.,\ngrounded in the dignitas shared by lender and\nsubject. Condign merit implies that the meritorious truly deserve the\nreward, requiring the giver to give it to the merited as something\ndue, as when an olympic athelete earns a gold medal by besting all her\nopponents.  Such a loan is impossible between Creator and creature,\nbecause there is no way of placing a creature's merit on the same\nscale as God's perfect nature; all the creature has, including its\nworth, is from God, whereas God's perfection is per se.  There is no\nway in which a creature can be considered to deserve anything from God\nin such a relation.  Congruent merit obtains when the meritorious does\nnot have the power to require anything of the giver. In instances of\ncongruent merit, the goodness of the act does not require the giver to\nreward the agent, though it does provide sufficient cause for the\nreward to be given, as when one receives an Academy Award: although\nmany of the audience members may deserve an Oscar, the winner receives\nit because something about her performance is somehow pleasing to the\nAcademy. Still, Wyclif holds that \u201cIt is the invariable law of God\nthat nobody is awarded blessedness unless they first deserve it\u201d\n(De Dominio Divino III, ch. 4, p.229.18). We can move our\nwills to the good, and from this, Wyclif says, grace may \u2014 but need\nnot \u2014 follow. Thus, we merit congruently thanks to God's generosity\ntowards a will in accord with His own. In effect, God lends merit.\n\n\nWyclif's theology of grace is the key to understanding how his theory\nof human dominium relates to divine dominium, its\ncausal paradigm. Man's lordship is at once ownership and jurisdictive\nmastery, but when a human lord governs, or gives, or receives, or\nlends, these acts are only just insofar as the lord recognizes that\nhis authority is that of a steward: \u201cAny rational creature is only\nimproperly called a lord, and is rather a minister or steward of the\nsupreme Lord, and whatever he has to distribute, he has purely by\ngrace\u201d ([De Dominio Divino III, ch. 6, p.250.25\u201329). The\nessential characteristic of every instance of human dominium\nis the grace God lends to the individual lord, which itself is\ngrounded in the grace of the Holy Spirit. The human lord appears to\nhave proprietary and juristictive authority by virtue of his own\nexcellence, but this is really only an instantiation of divine\ndominium, a grace-realized agent of God's lordship. This\nmakes the human lord both master and servant; from the divine\nperspective, the lord is God's servant, but from the viewpoint of the\nsubject, he is master. Wyclif is tireless in his emphasis on the\nillusory nature of this mastery; grace allows the human lord to\nrecognize that he is, in fact, the servant of his subjects,\nministering to them as a nurturing steward, not lording over them as\nwould a powerful sovereign.  \n",
