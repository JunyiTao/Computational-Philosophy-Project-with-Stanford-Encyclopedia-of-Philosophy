    "preamble": "\n\nLinguistic pragmatics studies the context-dependent use and\ninterpretation of expressions. Perhaps the most important notion in\npragmatics is Grice\u2019s (1967) conversational\nimplicature. It is based on the insight that by means of general\nprinciples of rational cooperative behavior we can communicate more\nwith the use of a sentence than the conventional semantic\nmeaning associated with it. Grice has argued, for instance, that\nthe exclusive interpretation of \u2018or\u2019\u2014according to\nwhich we infer from \u2018John or Mary came\u2019 that John and Mary\ndidn\u2019t come both\u2014is not due to the semantic meaning of\n\u2018or\u2019 but should be accounted for by a theory of\nconversational implicature. In this particular example,\u2014a\ntypical example of a so-called Quantity implicature\u2014the\nhearer\u2019s implication is taken to follow from the fact that the\nspeaker could have used a contrasting, and informatively stronger\nexpression, but chose not to. Other implicatures may follow from what\nthe hearer thinks that the speaker takes to be normal states of\naffairs, i.e., stereotypical interpretations. For both types of\nimplicatures, the hearer\u2019s (pragmatic) interpretation of an\nexpression involves what he takes to be the speaker\u2019s reason for\nusing this expression.

    "main_text": "\n1. Bidirectional Optimality Theory\n1.1 Bidirectional OT and Quantity implicatures\n\nOptimality Theory (OT) is a linguistic theory which assumes that\nlinguistic choices are governed by competition between a set of\ncandidates, or alternatives. In standard OT (Prince & Smolensky,\n1993) the optimal candidate is the one that satisfies best a set of\nviolable constraints. After its success in phonology, OT has also been\nused in syntax, semantics and pragmatics. The original idea of\noptimality-theoretic semantics was to model interpretation by taking\nthe candidates to be the alternative interpretations that the hearer\ncould assign to a given expression, with constraints describing\ngeneral preferences over expression-interpretation pairs. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) extended this original version by taking also alternative\nexpressions, or forms, into account that the speaker could have used,\nbut did not. The reference to alternative expressions/forms is\nstandard in pragmatics to account for Quantity implicatures.\nOptimization should thus be thought of from two directions: that of\nthe hearer, and that of the speaker. What is optimal, according to\nBlutner\u2019s Bidirectional-OT (Bi-OT), is not just interpretations\nwith respect to forms, but rather form-interpretation pairs. In terms\nof a \u2018better than\u2019 relation \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019 between\nform-interpretation pairs, the pair \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) is said to\nbe (strongly) optimal iff it satisfies the following\ntwo conditions: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\neg \\exists i' &: \\langle f,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle \\\\ \\neg \\exists f' &: \\langle f', i\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe first condition requires that \\(i\\) is an optimal interpretation\nof form \\(f\\). In Bi-OT this condition is thought of as optimization\nfrom the hearer\u2019s point of view. Blutner proposed that \\(\\langle\nf,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle\\) iff \\(i'\\) is a more likely, or\nstereotypical, interpretation of \\(f\\) than \\(i\\) is: \\(P(i'\\mid\n\\llbracket f\\rrbracket) \\gt P(i\\mid \\llbracket f \\rrbracket)\\) (where\n\\(\\llbracket f\\rrbracket\\) denotes the semantic meaning of \\(f\\), and\n\\(P(B\\mid A)\\) the conditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\),\ndefined as \\(P(A\\cap B)/P(A))\\). The second condition is taken to\ninvolve speaker\u2019s optimization: for \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) to be\noptimal for the speaker, it has to be the case that she cannot use a\nmore optimal form \\(f'\\) to express \\(i. \\langle f',i\\rangle \\gt\n\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) iff either (i) \\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f'\\rrbracket)\n\\gt P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\), or (ii) \\(P(i\\mid\\llbracket\nf'\\rrbracket = P(i\\mid\\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\) and \\(f'\\) is a less\ncomplex form to express \\(i\\) than \\(f\\) is.\n\nBi-OT accounts for classical Quantity implicatures. A convenient\n(though controversial) example is the\n\u2018exactly\u2019-interpretation of number terms. Let us assume,\nfor the sake of example, that number terms semantically have an\n\u2018at\n least\u2019-meaning.[1]\n Still, we want to account for the intuition that the sentence\n\u201cThree children came to the party\u201d is normally interpreted\nas saying that exactly three children came to the party. One\nway to do this is to assume that the alternative expressions that the\nspeaker could use are of the form \u201c(At least) \\(n\\)\nchildren came to the party\u201d, while the alternative\ninterpretations for the hearer are of type \\(i_n\\) meaning that\n\u201cExactly \\(n\\) children came to the\n party\u201d.[2]\n If we assume, again for the sake of example, that all relevant\ninterpretations are considered equally likely and that it is already\ncommonly assumed that some children came, but not more than four, the\nstrongly optimal form-interpretation pairs can be read off the\nfollowing table:\n\n\n\\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\)\n\\(i_1\\)\n\\(i_2\\)\n\\(i_3\\)\n\\(i_4\\) \n\n\u2018one\u2019\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\u00bc\n\u00bc\n\u00bc\n\u00bc \n\n\u2018two\u2019\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\) \n\n\u2018three\u2019\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) \u00bd\n\u00bd \n\n\u2018four\u2019\n0\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow 1\\) \n\n\nIn this table the entry \\(P(i_3 \\mid\n\\llbracket\\)\u2018two\u2019\\(\\rrbracket) = \u2153\\) because\n\\(P(i_3 \\mid \\{i_2,i_3,i_4\\}) = \u2153\\). Notice that according to\nthis reasoning \u2018two\u2019 is interpreted as \u2018exactly\n2\u2019 (as indicated by an arrow) because (i) \\(P(i_2 \\mid\n\\llbracket\\)\u2018two\u2019\\(\\rrbracket) = \u2153\\) is higher than\n\\(P(i_2 \\mid \\llbracket\\)\u2018\\(n \\textrm{'} \\rrbracket)\\) for any\nalternative expression \u2018\\(n\\)\u2019, and (ii) all other\ninterpretations compatible with the semantic meaning of the numeral\nexpression are blocked: there is, for instance, another\nexpression for which \\(i_4\\) is a better interpretation, i.e., an\ninterpretation with a higher conditional probability.\n\nWith numeral terms, the semantic meanings of the alternative\nexpressions give rise to a linear order. This turns out to be crucial\nfor the Bi-OT analysis, if we continue to take the interpretations as\nspecific as we have done so far. Consider the following alternative\nanswers to the question \u201cWho came to the party?\u201d:\n\nJohn came to the party.\nJohn or Bill came to the party.\n\n\nSuppose that John and Bill are the only relevant persons and that it\nis presupposed that somebody came to the party. In that case the table\nthat illustrates bidirectional optimality reasoning looks as follows\n(where \\(i_x\\) is the interpretation that only \\(x\\) came):\n\n\n\\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\)\n\\(i_j\\)\n\\(i_b\\)\n\\(i_{jb}\\) \n\n\u2018John\u2019\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u00bd\\)\n0\n\\(\u00bd\\) \n\n\u2018Bill\u2019\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u00bd\\)\n\\(\u00bd\\) \n\n\u2018John and Bill\u2019\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow 1\\) \n\n\u2018John or Bill\u2019\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\) \n\n\nThis table correctly predicts that (1) is interpreted as saying that\nonly John came. But now consider the disjunction (2).\nIntuitively, this answer should be interpreted as saying that either\nonly John, or only Bill came. It is easy to see, however, that this is\npredicted only if \u2018John came\u2019 and \u2018Bill came\u2019\nare not taken to be alternative forms. Bi-OT predicts that in case\nalso \u2018John came\u2019 and \u2018Bill came\u2019 are taken to\nbe alternatives, the disjunction is uninterpretable, because the\nspecific interpretations \\(i_j, i_b\\), and \\(i_{jb}\\) all can be\nexpressed better by other forms. In general, one can see that in case\nthe semantic meanings of the alternative expressions are not linearly,\nbut only partially ordered, the derivation of Quantity implicatures\nsketched above gives rise to partially wrong predictions.\n\nAs it turns out, this problem for Bi-OT seems larger than it really\nis. Intuitively, an answer like (2) suggests that the speaker has\nincomplete information (she doesn\u2019t know who of John or Bill\ncame). But the interpretations that we considered so far are world\nstates that do not encode different amounts of speaker knowledge. So,\nto take this into account in Bi-OT (or in any other analysis of\nQuantity implicatures) we should allow for alternative interpretations\nthat represent different knowledge states of the speaker. Aloni (2007)\ngives a Bi-OT account of ignorance implicatures (inferences, like the\nabove, that the speaker lacks certain bits of possibly relevant\ninformation), alongside indifference implicatures (that the\nspeaker does not consider bits of information relevant enough to\nconvey). Moreover, it can be shown that, as far as ignorance\nimplicatures are concerned, the predictions of Bi-OT line up with the\npragmatic interpretation function called \u2018Grice\u2019\nin various (joint) papers of Schulz and Van Rooij (e.g., Schulz &\nVan Rooij, 2006). In these papers it is claimed that Grice\nimplements the Gricean maxim of Quality and the first maxim of\nQuantity, and it is shown that in terms of it (together with an\nadditional assumption of competence) we can account for many\nconversational implicatures, including the ones of (1) and (2).\n1.2 A Bi-OT analysis of Horn\u2019s division\n\nBi-OT can also account for Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic\nlabor or M-implicatures, as they are alternatively\nsometimes called after Levinson (2000). From this division of\npragmatic labor it follows, according to Horn, that while\n(morphologically) unmarked  expressions typically get an\nunmarked, or stereotypical interpretation via Grice\u2019s maxim of\nRelation,  marked expressions\u2014being morphologically\ncomplex and less lexicalised\u2014tend to receive a marked,\nnon-stereotypical, interpretation. Horn (1984) claimed that this\nfollows from the interaction between both Gricean submaxims of\nQuantity, and the maxims of Relation and Manner, and that for the\ninterpretation of marked expressions it is crucial that an alternative\nunmarked expression is available as well. To illustrate, consider the\nfollowing well-known example:\n\nJohn killed the sheriff.\nJohn caused the sheriff to die.\n\n\nWe typically interpret the unmarked (3) as meaning stereotypical\nkilling (on purpose), while the marked (4) suggests that John killed\nthe sheriff in a more indirect way, maybe unintentionally. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) shows that this can be accounted for in Bi-OT. Take\n\\(i_{st}\\) to be the more plausible interpretation where John killed\nthe sheriff in the stereotypical way, while \\(i_{\\neg st}\\) is the\ninterpretation where John caused the sheriff\u2019s death in an\nunusual way. Because (3) is less complex than (4), and \\(i_{st}\\) is\nthe more stereotypical interpretation compatible with the semantic\nmeaning of (3), it is predicted that (3) is interpreted as \\(i_{st}\\).\nThus, in terms of his notion of strong optimality, i.e.,\noptimality for both speaker and hearer, Blutner can account for the\nintuition that sentences typically get the most plausible, or\nstereotypical, interpretation. In terms of this notion of optimality,\nhowever, Blutner is not able yet to explain how the more complex form\n(4) can have an interpretation at all, in particular, why it will be\ninterpreted as non-stereotypical killing. The reason is that on the\nassumption that (4) has the same semantic meaning as (3), the\nstereotypical interpretation would be hearer-optimal not only for (3),\nbut also for (4).\n\nTo account for the intuition that (4) is interpreted in a\nnon-stereotypical way, Blutner (2000) introduces a weaker notion of\noptimality that also takes into account a notion of blocking:\none form\u2019s pragmatically assigned meaning can take away, so to\nspeak, that meaning from another, less favorable form. In the present\ncase, the stereotypical interpretation is intuitively blocked for the\ncumbersome form (4) by the cheaper alternative expression (3).\nFormally, a form-interpretation pair \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) is\nweakly\n optimal[3]\n iff there is neither a strongly optimal \\(\\langle f,i'\\rangle\\) such\nthat \\(\\langle f,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle\\) nor a strongly\noptimal \\(\\langle f',i\\rangle\\) such that \\(\\langle f',i\\rangle \\gt\n\\langle f,i\\rangle\\). All form-interpretation pairs that are strongly\noptimal are also weakly optimal. However, a pair that is not strongly\noptimal like \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) can still be weakly\noptimal: since neither \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{st}\\rangle\\) nor\n\\(\\langle\\)(3),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) is strongly optimal, there is no\nobjection for \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) to be a (weakly)\noptimal pair. As a result, the marked (4) will get the\nnon-stereotypical interpretation. In general, application of the above\ndefinition of weak optimality can be difficult, but J\u00e4ger (2002)\ngives a concise algorithm for computing weakly optimal\nform-interpretation pairs.\n2. Implicatures and Game Theory\n\nThe first to systematically explore the use of game theory for an\naccount of communication as strategic inference was Prashant\nParikh in his 1988 dissertation (Parikh 1988). Parikh\u2019s theory\nis based on what he calls games of partial information,\nrevolves around the game-theoretic solution concept of\nPareto-optimal Nash equilibrium and has been refined and\napplied to various phenomena, including but not restricted to\nimplicature-strengthened utterance meaning, in a series of articles\nand monographs (e.g., Parikh 1991, 1992, 2000, 2001, 2010, 2019).\nAnother noteworthy early contribution is the work of Asher, Sher, and\nWilliams (2001), which tries to rationalize Grice\u2019s Maxims of\nConversation using ideas from game theory. In the following we focus\non approaches to implicatures based on so-called iterative reasoning\nin signaling games. The relation between optimality theory and game\ntheory is explored by Dekker and van Rooij (2000) and Franke and\nJ\u00e4ger (2012). Stevens and Benz (2018) give another insightful\noverview of game-theoretic pragmatics.\n2.1 Signaling games\n\nDavid Lewis (1969) introduced signaling games to explain how messages\ncan be used to communicate something, although these messages do not\nhave a pre-existing meaning. In pragmatics we want to do something\nsimilar: explain what is actually communicated by an expression whose\nactual interpretation is underspecified by its conventional semantic\nmeaning. To account for pragmatic inferences in game theory, Parikh\n(1991, 1992) introduced games of partial information. These games are\nmuch like Lewis\u2019s original signalling games, except that\nmessages are taken to have a conventional semantic meaning, and\nspeakers are assumed to say only messages that are true. In the\ninterest of a broad overview, we gloss over interesting but subtle\ndifferences between Lewis' signaling games and Parikh's games of\npartial information.\n\nA signaling game, then, is a game of asymmetric information between a\nsender \\(s\\) and a receiver \\(r\\). The sender observes the state \\(t\\)\nthat \\(s\\) and \\(r\\) are in, while the receiver has to perform an\naction. Sender \\(s\\) can try to influence the action taken by \\(r\\) by\nsending a message. \\(T\\) is the set of states, \\(F\\) the set of forms,\nor messages. The messages already have a semantic meaning, given by\nthe semantic interpretation function \\(\\llbracket \\cdot \\rrbracket\\)\nwhich assigns to each form a subset of \\(T\\). The sender will send a\nmessage/form in each state, a sender strategy \\(S\\) is thus a\nfunction from \\(T\\) to \\(F\\). The receiver will perform an action\nafter hearing a message with a particular semantic meaning, but for\npresent purposes we can think of actions simply as interpretations. A\nreceiver strategy \\(R\\) is then a function that maps a\nmessage to an interpretation, i.e., a subset of \\(T\\). A utility\nfunction for speaker and hearer represents what interlocutors\ncare about, and so the utility function models what speaker and hearer\nconsider to be relevant information (implementing Grice\u2019s Maxim\nof Relevance). For simplicity, it is normally assumed that the utility\nfunctions of \\(s\\) and \\(r (U_s\\) and \\(U_r)\\) are the same\n(implementing Grice\u2019s cooperative principle), and that they\ndepend on (i) the actual state \\(t\\), (ii) the receiver\u2019s\ninterpretation, \\(i\\), of the message \\(f\\) sent by \\(s\\) in \\(t\\)\naccording to their respective strategies \\(R\\) and \\(S\\), i.e., \\(i =\nR(S(t))\\), and (iii) (in section 2.3) the form \\(f = S(t)\\) used by\nthe sender. Nature is taken to pick the state according to some\n(commonly known) probability distribution \\(P\\) over \\(T\\). With\nrespect to this probability function, the expected, or average,\nutility of each sender-receiver strategy combination \\(\\langle\nS,R\\rangle\\) for player \\(e \\in \\{s,r\\}\\) can be determined as\nfollows: \n\n\\[ \\text{EU}_e (S,R)= \\sum_{t\\in T} P(t) \\times U_e (t,S(t),R(S(t))). \\]\n\n\nA signaling game is taken to be a (simplified, abstract) model of a\nsingle utterance and its interpretation, which includes some of the\narguably most relevant features of a context for pragmatic reasoning:\nan asymmetry of information (speaker knows the world state, hearer\ndoes not), a notion of utterance alternatives (in the set of\nmessages/forms) with associated semantic meaning, and a flexible\nrepresentation of what counts as relevant information (via utility\nfunctions). If this is not enough, e.g., if we want the listener to\nhave partial information not shared by the speaker as well (such as\nwhen the speaker is uncertain about what is really relevant for the\nlistener), that can easily be accommodated into a more complex game\nmodel, but we refrain from going more complex here. The strategies of\nsender and receiver encode particular ways of using and interpreting\nlanguage. The notion of expected utility evaluates how good ways of\nusing and interpreting language are (in the given context).\nGame-theoretic explanations of pragmatic phenomena aim to single out\nthose sender-receiver strategy pairs that correspond to empirically\nattested behavior as optimal and/or rational solution of the game\nproblem.\n\nThe standard solution concept of game theory is Nash\nequilibrium. A Nash equilibrium of a signaling game is a pair of\nstrategies \\(\\langle\\)S\\(^*\\),R\\(^*\\)\\(\\rangle\\)\nwhich has the property that neither the sender nor the receiver could\nincrease his or her expected utility by unilateral deviation. Thus,\nS\\(^*\\) is a best response to R\\(^*\\) and\nR\\(^*\\) is a best response to S\\(^*\\). There are\nplenty of refinements of Nash equilibrium in the game-theoretic\nliterature. Moreover, there are alternatives to equilibrium analyses,\nthe two most prominent of which are: (i) explicit formalizations of\nagents\u2019 reasoning processes, such as is done in epistemic game\ntheory (e.g., Perea 2012), and (ii) variants of evolutionary game\ntheory (e.g., Sandholm 2010) that study the dynamic changes in\nagents\u2019 behavioral disposition under gradual optimization\nprocedures, such as by imitation or learning from parents. These\nissues are relevant for applications to linguistic pragmatics as well,\nas we will demonstrate presently with the example of\nM-implicatures/Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic labor.\n2.2 A game-theoretic explanation of Horn\u2019s division\n\nParikh (1988, 1991, 1992) proposed the use of game theory to account\nfor disambiguation and implicature. As it turns out, the same proposal\ncan be used to account for Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic labour\nas well. Parikh assumes that a message, or form, \\(f_u\\), is\nsemantically ambiguous, and can have a stereotypical interpretation,\n\\(t_{st}\\), and a non-stereotypical interpretation \\(t_{\\neg st}\\),\nwith \\(P(t_{st}) \\gt P(t_{\\neg st})\\). Both meanings, however, could\nbe expressed unambiguously as well by a more complex form.\nInterpretation \\(t_{\\neg st}\\), for instance, can be expressed not\nonly by \\(f_u\\), but by form \\(f_m\\) as well that literally expresses\nit. As is usual in so-called costly signalling games, and also\nconsistent with Parikh\u2019s proposal, the sender\u2019s utility\nfunction can be decomposed into a benefit and a cost function, \\(U_s\n(t,f,i) = B_s (t,i) - C(f)\\), where \\(i\\) is an interpretation. We\nadopt the following benefit function: \\(B_s (t,i) = 1\\) if \\(i = t\\),\nand \\(B_s (t,i) = 0\\) otherwise. The cost of the ambiguous message\n\\(f_u\\) is lower than the cost of the unambiguous message \\(f_m\\). We\ncan assume without loss of generality that \\(C(f_u) = 0 \\lt C(f_m)\\).\nIn the use of signalling games for the analysis of human communication\nit is standard to assume that it is always better to have successful\ncommunication with a costly message than unsuccessful communication\nwith a cheap message, which means that \\(C(f_m)\\), though greater than\n\\(C(f_u)\\), must remain reasonably small. If we limit ourselves to a\ngame with 2 states, \\(t_{st}\\) and \\(t_{\\neg st}\\), and three\nmessages, \\(f_u\\) and the two forms that literally express the two\nstates, and think of sender and receiver strategies as before, the\ncombination of sender and receiver strategies that gives rise to the\nbijective mapping \\(\\{\\langle t_{st},f_u\\rangle , \\langle t_{\\neg\nst},f_m\\rangle \\}\\) is a Nash equilibrium of this game. Intuitively,\nthis is also the correct solution of the disambiguation game, because\nthe ambiguous message \\(f_u\\) expresses the stereotypical\ninterpretation \\(t_{st}\\), while the non-stereotypical state \\(t_{\\neg\nst}\\) is expressed by the marked and costlier message \\(f_m\\).\nUnfortunately, also the mapping \\(\\{\\langle t_{st},f_m\\rangle ,\n\\langle t_{\\neg st},f_u\\rangle \\}\\)\u2014where the lighter message\ndenotes the non-stereotypical situation\u2014is a Nash equilibrium of\nthe game, which means that on the present implementation the standard\nsolution concept of game theory cannot yet single out the desired\noutcome.\n\nThis is were considerations of equilibrium refinements and/or\nalternative solution concepts come in. Parikh (1988, 1991, 1992)\nobserves that of the two equilibria mentioned above, the first one\nPareto-dominates the second\u2014being the unique Pareto-Nash\nequilibrium\u2014and that for this reason the former should be\npreferred. Van Rooij (2004) suggests that because Horn\u2019s\ndivision of pragmatic labor involves not only language use but also\nlanguage organization, one should look at signaling games from an\nevolutionary point of view, and make use of those variants of\nevolutionary game theory that explain the emergence of Pareto-optimal\nsolutions. As a third alternative, following some ideas of De Jaegher\n(2008), van Rooij (2008) proposes that one could also make use of\nforward induction (a particular game-theoretic way of reasoning about\nsurprising moves of the opponent) to single out the desired\nequilibrium. As an example of an approach that draws on detailed\nmodelling of the epistemic states of interlocutors, Franke (2014a)\nsuggests that we should distinguish cases of M-implicature that\ninvolve rather clear ad hoc reasoning, such as (5) and (6),\nfrom cases with a possibly more grammaticalized contrast, such as\nbetween (3) and (4).\n\nMrs T sang \u2018Home Sweet Home\u2019.\nMrs T produces a series of sounds roughly corresponding to the\nscore of \u2018Home Sweet Home\u2019.\n\n\nFranke suggests that the game model for reasoning about (5) and (6)\nshould contain an element of asymmetry of alternatives: whereas it is\nreasonable (for a speaker to expect that) a listener would consider\n(5) to be an alternative utterance when hearing (6), it is quite\nimplausible that (a speaker believes that) a listener will consider\n(6) a potential alternative utterance when hearing (5). This asymmetry\nof alternatives translates into different beliefs that the listener\nwill have about the context after different messages. The speaker can\nanticipate this, and a listener who has actually observed (6) can\nreason about his own counterfactual context representation that he\nwould have had if the speaker had said (5) instead. Franke shows that,\nwhen paired with this asymmetry in context representation, a simple\nmodel of iterated best response reasoning, to which we turn next,\ngives the desired result as well.\n2.3 Quantity implicatures and iterated reasoning\n\nUnlike the case of M-implicatures, many Quantity implicatures hinge on\nthe fact that alternative expressions differ with respect to logical\nstrength: the inference from \u2018three\u2019 to the pragmatically\nstrengthed \u2018exactly three\u2019-reading, that we sketched in\nSection 1.1, draws on the fact that the alternative expression\n\u2018four\u2019 is semantically stronger, i.e., \u2018four\u2019\nsemantically entails \u2018three\u2019, but not the other way\naround, under the assumed \u2018at least\u2019-semantics. In order\nto bring considerations of semantic strength to bear on game-theoretic\npragmatics, we must assign conventional meaning some role in either\nthe game model or the solution concept. In the following, we look at\ntwo similar, but distinct possibilities of treating semantic meaning\nin approaches that spell out pragmatic reasoning as chains of\n(higher-order) reasoning about interlocutors\u2019 rationality.\n\nA straightforward and efficient way of bringing semantic meaning into\ngame-theoretic pragmatics is to simply restrict the set of viable\nstrategies of sender and receiver in a signaling game to those\nstrategies that conform to conventional meaning: a sender can only\nselect forms that are true of the actual state, and the receiver can\nonly select interpretations which are in the denotation of an observed\nmessage. This may seem crude and excludes cases of non-literal\nlanguage use, lying, cheating and error from the start, but it may\nserve to rationalize common patterns of pragmatic reasoning among\ncooperative, information-seeking interlocutors. Based on such a\nrestriction to truth-obedient strategies, it has been shown\nindependently by Pavan (2013) and Rothschild (2013) that there is an\nestablished non-equilibrium solution concept that nicely rationalizes\nQuantity implicatures, namely iterated admissibility, also\nknown as iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies.\nWithout going into detail, the general idea of this solution concept\nis to start with the whole set of viable strategies (all conforming to\nsemantic meaning) and then to iteratively eliminate all strategies\n\\(X\\) for which there is no cautious belief about which of\nthe opponent\u2019s remaining strategies the opponent will likely\nplay that would make \\(X\\) a rational thing to do. (A cautious belief\nis one that does not exclude any opponent strategy that has not been\neliminated so far.) The set of strategies that survive repeated\niterations of elimination are then compatible with (a particular kind\nof) common belief in rationality. In sum, iterated admissibility is an\neliminative approach: starting from the set of all (truth-abiding)\nstrategies, some strategies are weeded out at every step until we\nremain with a stable set of strategies from which nothing can be\neliminated anymore.\n\nAn alternative to restricting attention to only truthful strategies is\nto use semantic meaning to constrain the starting point of pragmatic\nreasoning. Approaches that do so are the optimal assertions\napproach (Benz 2006, Benz & van Rooij 2007), iterated\nbest response models (e.g., Franke 2009, 2011, J\u00e4ger 2014),\nand related probabilistic models (e.g., Frank & Goodman\n2012, Goodman & Stuhlm\u00fcller 2013, Franke & J\u00e4ger\n2014). The general idea that unifies these approaches can be traced\ndirectly to Grice, in particular the notion that speakers should\nmaximize the amount of relevant information contained in their\nutterances. Since information contained in an utterance is standardly\ntaken to be semantic information (as opposed to pragmatically\nrestricted or modulated meaning), a simple way of implementing Gricean\nspeakers is to assume that they choose utterances by considering how a\nliteral interpreter would react to each alternative. Pragmatic\nlisteners then react optimally based on the belief that the speaker is\nGricean in the above sense. In other words, these approaches define a\nsequence of Theory-of-Mind reasoning: starting with a (non-rational,\ndummy) literal interpreter, a Gricean speaker acts (approximately)\nrationally based on literal interpretation, while a Gricean listener\ninterprets (approximately) rationally based on the behavior of a\nGricean speaker. Some contributions allow for further iterations of\nbest responses, others do not; some contributions also look at\nreasoning sequences that start with literal senders; some\ncontributions assume that agents are strictly rational, others allow\nfor probabilistic approximations to classical rational choice (see\nFranke & J\u00e4ger 2014 for overview and comparison).\n\nA crucial difference between iterated best response approaches and the\npreviously mentioned approach based on iterated admissibility is that\nthe former does not shrink a set of strategies but allows for a\ndifferent set of best responses at each step. This also makes it so\nthat (some) iterated best response approaches can deal with pragmatic\nreasoning in cases where interlocutors\u2019 preferences are not\naligned, i.e., where the Gricean assumption of cooperativity does not\nhold, or where there are additional incentives to deviate from\nsemantic meaning (for more about game models for reasoning in\nnon-cooperative contexts, see, e.g., Franke, de Jager & van Rooij\n2012, de Jaegher & van Rooij 2014, Franke & van Rooij 2015).\nAnother difference between iterated best response models and iterated\nadmissibility is that the latter do not by itself account for\nHorn\u2019s division of pragmatic labor (see Franke 2014b and Pavan\n2014 for discussion).\n\nTo illustrate how iterated best response reasoning works in a simple\n(cooperative) case, let us look briefly at numerical expressions\nagain. Take a signaling game with 4 states, or worlds, \\(W = \\{w_1,\nw_2, w_3, w_4\\}\\) where the indices give the exact/maximal number of\nchildren that came to our party, and four messages \\(F =\n\\{\\)\u2018one\u2019,\u2018two\u2019,\u2018three\u2019,\n\u2018four\u2019\\(\\}\\), as shorthand for \u2018\\(n\\) children came\nto our party\u2019. On a neo-Gricean \u2018at\nleast\u2019-interpretation of numerals, the meanings of the numeral\nexpressions form an implication chain: \n\n\\[ \\llbracket `\\text{four}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{three}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{two}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{one}\\rsquo \\rrbracket, \\]\n\n\nbecause, for instance, \\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket =\n\\{w_3, w_4\\}\\). A literal interpreter, who is otherwise oblivious to\ncontextual factors, would respond to every message by choosing any\ntrue interpretation with equal probability. So, for instance, if the\nliteral interpreter hears \u2018three\u2019, he would choose \\(w_3\\)\nor \\(w_4\\), each with probability \\(\u00bd\\). But that means that an\noptimal choice of expression for a speaker who wants to communicate\nthat the actual world is \\(w_3\\) would be \u2018three\u2019, because\nthis maximizes the chance that the literal interpreter selects\n\\(w_3\\). Concretely, if the speaker chooses \u2018one\u2019, the\nchance that the literal listener chooses \\(w_3\\) is \u00bc; for\n\u2018two\u2019 it\u2019s \u2153; for \u2018three\u2019\nit\u2019s \\(\u00bd\\), and for \u2018four\u2019 it\u2019s zero,\nbecause \\(w_3\\) is not an element of\n\\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket\\). So, a rational\nGricean speaker selects\n\\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket\\) in \\(w_3\\) and nowhere\nelse, as is easy to see by a parallel argument for all other states.\nBut that means that a Gricean interpreter who hears\n\u2018three\u2019 will infer that the actual world must be\n\\(w_3\\).\n\nIn recent years, a few promising extensions of this pragmatic\nreasoning scheme have been proposed. One is to include probabilistic\nchoice functions to model agents\u2019 approximately rational\nchoices, so as to allow for a much more direct link with experimental\ndata (for overview see Franke & J\u00e4ger 2016, Goodman &\nFrank 2016). Such probabilistic pragmatic models have been applied to\na number of phenomena of interest, including reasoning about\nreferential expressions in context (Frank & Goodman 2012),\nignorance implicatures (Goodman & Stuhlm\u00fcller 2013), context\neffects on scalar implicatures (Degen et al. 2015), non-literal\ninterpretation of number terms (Kao et al. 2014), pragmatic meaning\nmodulation associated with particular intonation (Bergen & Goodman\n2015, Stevens 2016), and Quantity implicatures in complex sentences\n(Bergen et al. 2016, Potts et al. 2016). These models of pragmatic\nreasoning have furthermore been used successfully also in natural\nlanguage processing applications (Andreas & Klein 2016, Monroe et\nal. 2017) and other areas of linguistic research, such as\nsociolinguistics (Burnett 2019). Another recent approach is to allow\nfor uncertainty of the semantic meanings of the involved expressions,\nand for uncertainty of the beliefs and preferences of the participants\nof thee conversation and of other aspects of the \u2018common\nground\u2019 (e.g., Brochhagen 2017). Finally, in recent work more\npragmatic phenomena are accounted for than just generalised\nconversational implicatures, such as particular conversational\nimplicature, explicatures or free enrichment (e.g., Parikh 2010), the\nanalysis of presupposition (Qing et al. 2016), and politeness (e.g.\nClark 2012, Yoon et al. 2020).\n3. Conclusion\n\nBidirectional Optimality Theory and Game Theory are quite natural, and\nsimilar, frameworks to formalize Gricean ideas about interactive,\ngoal-oriented pragmatic reasoning in context. Recent developments turn\ntowards epistemic or evolutionary game theory or to probabilistic\nmodels for empirical data. Finally, we remark that formal techniques\nsimilar to what is explored here are applicable to a wider range of\nproblems in diverse areas, such as philosophy (e.g., Parikh 2019),\nlanguage evolution (e.g., Ahern and Clark 2014; Brochhagen, Franke, and\nRooij 2018; Carcassi 2020), as well as computational linguistics (e.g.\nVogel et al. 2014, Cohn-Gordon, Goodman, and Potts 2019).\n",
