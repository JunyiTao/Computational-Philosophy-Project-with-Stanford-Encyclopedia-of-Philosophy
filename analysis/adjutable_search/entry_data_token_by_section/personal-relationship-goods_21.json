    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || Which Metric of Justice?\n5.3 Which Metric of Justice?\n\nDoes the identification of the correct metric of justice bear on the\nthesis that justice requires the distribution of personal relationship\ngoods? According to Cordelli,\n\n\nalthough it might be easier for welfarist or perfectionists to include\nrelational goods within their metric of justice, even those who adopt\na non-welfarist and non-perfectionist, resourcist metric have good\ninternal reasons to include (opportunities for) relational resources.\n(2015a: 89)\n\n\nTo judge this, it is useful to operate with the following distinction\n(Gheaus 2018): On the one hand, there is the question of the metric of\njustice, that is, what should we make sure people have a fair amount\nof. Examples include resources, (opportunities for) wellbeing and\ncapabilities. The correct metric of justice has been the subject of a\nlong, and not yet concluded, debate. On the other hand, one can be\nconcerned with the distribuenda of justice\u2014that is,\nwhat should we make sure our institutions and policies make available\nto individuals in order to bring about a just distribution of the\nright metric of justice. Examples include money, rights, leisure time,\nand, possibly, opportunities for relationships. It is possible that\npeople who disagree about the correct metric of justice will\u2014at\nleast occasionally\u2014agree about the distribuenda.\n\nUnderstood as part of the distribuenda of justice, personal\nrelationship goods\u2014and relationship goods in general\u2014can\nplausibly be accommodated by different conceptions of the right metric\n(Gheaus 2018). Indeed, friendship has been presented as one amongst\nthe many resources to be distributed by justice (Cordelli 2015a) and\nsome see the ability to form and maintain caring, meaningful\nrelationships as a basic capability (Nussbaum 2000: 82\u201383). Good\nfamily relationships\u2014including childrearing\u2014have been\npresented as a main contributor to wellbeing for at least some\nindividuals (Arneson 2014).\n",
