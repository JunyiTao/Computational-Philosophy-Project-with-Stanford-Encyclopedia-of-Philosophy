Setting Up the Problems\n\nIntuitively, given that a sentence expresses a structured proposition,\nthe proposition will have parts or constituents that are the semantic\nvalues of words or subsentential complex linguistic expressions\noccurring in the sentence; and the proposition will have a structure\nsimilar to the structure of the sentence. For example, assuming that\nthe semantic value of a name is its bearer and that the semantic value\nof a transitive verb is a relation, a structured proposition theorist\nwill likely hold that the sentence\n\n(1) Jason loves\nPatty\n\n\nexpresses a proposition consisting of Jason, the loving relation and\nPatty, bound together in some way into a unity. Letting\n\u2018j\u2019 stand for Jason, \u2018p\u2019 for\nPatty and \u2018L\u2019 for the loving relation, we can\nrepresent the proposition in question as follows:\n\n(1a) [j[L[p]]]\n\n\nThus (1a)\u2019s structure is very close to that of (1); and (1a) has\nas constituents the semantic values of the words occurring in (1).\nIndeed, in the case of (1) and (1a), all and only semantic values of\nwords in the sentence are constituents of the proposition. But a given\naccount of structured propositions may not hold that this is the case\nin general for any one of at least three reasons. First, one might\nhold that certain words as they occur in phrases in sentences do not\ncontribute their semantic values to the propositions expressed by\nthose sentences because the semantic values of these words instead\npartially determine the semantic values of the phrases in which they\noccur, where these latter semantic values are contributed to the\nproposition. For example, one might hold that in the sentence\n\n(2) Colin is a tall\nyoung man.\n\n\nthe phrase \u2018is a tall young man\u2019 contributes to the\nproposition expressed by (2) the property of being a tall young man,\nwhich is its semantic value. Thus, though the semantic value of the\nword \u2018tall\u2019 partly determines the semantic value of the\nphrase \u2018is a tall young man\u2019, the proposition expressed by\n(2) contains no constituent that is the semantic value of the word\n\u2018tall\u2019 alone. Second, one might hold that a sentence may\nexpress a proposition (in a context), where the proposition has\nconstituents not contributed by any syntactic constituent of the\nsentence, let alone any word in the sentence. For example, Mark\nCrimmins [1992] claims that an utterance of the sentence\n\n(3) It\u2019s\nraining\n\n\nexpresses a proposition to the effect that it is raining at a\nparticular time and place. The present tense manages to somehow\ncontribute the time of utterance to the proposition. But no syntactic\nconstituent of the sentence contributes the place to the proposition,\nthough Crimmins claims it is a constituent of the proposition\n expressed.[4]\n Third, one might hold that certain words simply have no semantic\nvalues, and so make no contribution to propositions. So-called\nneoplanastic \u2018ne\u2019 in French might be thought to be an\nexample of this.\n\nBut even if, for one of the above reasons or some other reason, a\nsentence does not express a proposition whose constituents are\nprecisely the semantic values of words in the sentence, we can still\nsay that structured proposition theorists hold that sentences\nexpresses propositions, where many (and likely most) constituents of\nthe proposition are semantic values of words or phrases occurring in\nthe sentence. So in the case of (1) and (1a), the constituents of the\nproposition are precisely the semantic values of the words in (1). In\nthe case of (2) and (2a) (given the assumptions made above), the\nconstituents of (2a) are precisely the semantic values of the name\n\u2018Colin\u2019 and the verb phrase \u2018is a tall young\nman\u2019. And in the case of (3), the proposition it expresses has\nthree constituents, two of which are contributed by\n\u2018raining\u2019 and the present tense construction.\n\nThus, ignoring, or at least not dwelling on, the qualifications just\nmade, we can say that structured proposition theorists hold that\nsentences express propositions that are complex entities (most of)\nwhose constituents are the semantic values of expressions occurring in\nthe sentence, where these constituents are bound together by some\nstructure inducing bond that renders the structure of the proposition\nsimilar to the structure of the sentence expressing it.\n\nThis highlights an important feature of structured proposition\naccounts that distinguishes them from the other main competing account\nof propositions, namely the account of propositions as sets of\npossible worlds (to be discussed below). Because structured\npropositions have as parts the semantic values of expressions in the\nsentences expressing them, the semantic values of those expressions\nare recoverable from the semantic values of the sentences (i.e. the\npropositions).\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that one could have a theory according to\nwhich the semantic values of expressions in a sentence are recoverable\nfrom the proposition expressed by the sentence, even though the\nsemantic values of the expressions are not (mereological or set\ntheoretic) parts of the proposition. For example, George Bealer [1993]\nformulates what he calls an algebraic conception of propositions (see\nalso Bealer [1982]). Bealer associates with each proposition a\n\u201cdecomposition tree.\u201d This decomposition tree shows how a\ngiven proposition is the result of the application of logical\noperations to individuals, properties, relations or other propositions\n(e.g. the application of the logical operation of negation to a\nproposition P yields a proposition that is true iff P is\nfalse; the application of the logical operation of singular\npredication to an item and a property yields a proposition that is\ntrue iff the item possesses the property, etc.). In general, a\nsentence will express a proposition such that the semantic values of\nexpressions in the sentence will occur on the decomposition tree\nassociated with the proposition. Thus, the semantic values of\nexpressions in a sentence will be recoverable from the proposition\n(together with its decomposition tree) expressed by the sentence.\nHowever, Bealer denies that these semantic values are in any sense\nset-theoretic members or mereological parts of the proposition. Bealer\nappears to hold that the proposition is metaphysically simple and has\nno parts at all. As the term is used here then, Bealer\u2019s is not\nan account of structured propositions for this reason. We will see\nbelow that others hold similar \u201calgebraic\u201d conceptions of\npropositions, where the propositions are complex entities consisting\nof constituents bound together in certain ways and so are structured\npropositions.\n\nSince the structured proposition expressed by a sentence has a\nstructure similar to that of the sentence and has as constituents\nsemantic values of expressions occurring in the sentence, the theory\nof structured propositions allows for distinct necessarily equivalent\npropositions. For example, the propositions expressed by\n\u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and \u2018Brothers are male\nsiblings\u2019 presumably are both necessarily true and hence are\nnecessarily equivalent. But clearly the propositions expressed by\nthese sentences have different constituents and so are distinct. The\nproposition expressed by the former presumably contains the semantic\nvalue of \u2018bachelor\u2019 (perhaps, the property of being a\nbachelor), whereas the proposition expressed by the latter\ndoesn\u2019t. And the proposition expressed by the latter contains\nthe semantic value of \u2018brother\u2019, whereas the proposition\nexpressed by the former doesn\u2019t. This is an important virtue of\nthe structured proposition view. The fact that it has this feature and\nthat its main competitor, the possible worlds account of propositions\n(discussed below), doesn\u2019t is one of the reasons many favor the\nstructured proposition view.\n\nIn discussing recent accounts of structured propositions below, it\nwill be shown how, on those accounts, sentences that are necessarily\nequivalent may express distinct propositions; and how the semantic\nvalues of expressions in a sentence are recoverable from the\nproposition expressed by the sentence.\n",
