The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account of the emotions\n\nThe discussion of this account will focus on the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btras, V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, Uddyotakara\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika and Jayanta\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s Ny\u0101ya-ma\u00f1jar\u012b. In\naddition, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btras together with\n\u015aa\u1e45kara Mi\u015bra\u2019s\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra-upask\u0101ra will be\nmentioned. The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account of the emotions\ninvolves a strict division into cognition (j\u00f1\u0101na)\nand mental phenomena that include a feeling aspect, such as love or\nattraction (r\u0101ga) and aversion (dve\u1e63a).\nOne of the main reasons for this is the acceptance of the existence of\na permanent immaterial self (\u0101tman) by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. According to their\narguments, the \u0101tman is a substance (dravya)\nwhich possesses several qualities (gu\u1e47as), such as\ncognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain. This\nenumeration shows that there is no common Sanskrit term for the\nconcept \u201cemotion\u201d in the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\ntexts. One general term used is sa\u1e43vedana which\ntranslates as \u201cfeeling\u201d, for example\nsukha-sa\u1e43vedana (feeling of pleasure).\n\nThe important aspect of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account is\nthat the individual emotions, such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as defects (do\u1e63as) [NB 1.1.18] or impurities\n(upadh\u0101) [VS and VSU 6.2.4]. These defects are the\nresult of ignorance (mithy\u0101j\u00f1\u0101na) and they\ngive rise to actions that lead to the feeling of pleasure or pain. The\nreason why this is regarded as negative is that the feeling of\npleasure and pain is responsible for our attachment to the world and,\nmore importantly, for our attachment to the self and therefore\npresents an obstacle to liberation. For this reason, any emotion is\ndeemed to have a negative influence on the individual. However, NV\n1.1.22 mentions one exception, namely the desire for eternal pleasure\nand absence from pain which is final liberation. While, strictly\nspeaking, a desire is not an emotion, it usually has the same negative\neffect because it results in attachment to the object of desire. The\ndesire for eternal pleasure, however, is not detrimental to\nliberation; in fact it is a precondition for liberation.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers clearly distinguish\nbetween pleasure (sukha) and pain (du\u1e25kha) on\nthe one hand and the experience of pleasure (sukha-pratyaya)\nand pain (du\u1e25kha-pratyaya) on the other hand. Pain and\npleasure are qualities of the soul but they need to be cognized by the\nself in order to be experienced. This means that cognition has a\nspecial status among the qualities of self: no other quality can be\nexperienced without cognition.\n\nAnother reason why cognition is an important quality is that it is not\nnecessarily a defect whereas the other qualities are always defects.\nThe defects fall into 3 groups: i) attraction (r\u0101ga),\nii) aversion (dve\u1e63a) and iii) illusion (moha)\n[NS 4.1.3]. Among the first group we find love, selfishness and greed.\nThe second group includes anger, jealousy, envy, malice and\nresentment. The Third group encompasses error, suspicion, pride and\nnegligence. These groupings show that, according to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account, there are no positive\nemotions. Even love, which is regarded as a positive emotion in many\ncultures, is ultimately a defect because all emotions lead to\nattachment and error.\n\nThe opposite of all three types of defect is described in NB 4.1.4 as\nknowledge of truth (tattvaj\u00f1\u0101na), right knowledge\n(samya\u1e45mati), truthful cognition\n(\u0101ryapraj\u00f1\u0101) and right apprehension\n(sambodha). This shows that, according to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, emotions are defects\nbecause they prevent our thinking from turning into right knowledge.\nThis knowledge can thus only be had if we eliminate these defects and\nthereby our emotions.\n\nAccording to NS 4.1.6, illusion is the worst defect because without it\nthe others are not going to appear. This means that one has to be\nunder an illusion already in order to think that the object of\none\u2019s attraction provides pleasure and the object of one\u2019s\naversion pain. In fact, NS and NB 4.1.58 state that ordinary pleasure\nshould be regarded as pain:\n\nThe ordinary man, addicted to pleasure, regards pleasure as the\nhighest end of man, and feels that there is nothing better than\npleasure; and hence when pleasure has been attained, he feels happy\nand contented, feeling that all he had to attain had been attained;\nand under the influence of illusion, he becomes attached to the\npleasure, as also to the things that bring about its accomplishment;\nbecoming so attached, he makes an attempt to obtain the pleasure; and\nwhile he is trying for it, there come down on him several kinds of\npain, in the form of birth, old age, disease, death, the contact of\ndisagreeable things, separation from agreeable things, the\nnon-fulfilment of desires and so forth; and yet all these several\nkinds of pain he regards as \u2018pleasure.\u2019 In fact pain is a\nnecessary factor in pleasure; without suffering some pain no pleasure\ncan be obtained; hence as leading to pleasure, this pain is regarded\nby the man as pleasure; and such a man, having his mind obsessed by\nthis notion of \u2018pleasure\u2019, never escapes from\nmetempsychosis, which consists of a running series of births and\ndeaths. And it is as an antidote of this notion of pleasure that we\nhave the teaching that all this should be looked upon as\n\u2018pain.\u2019 [NB 4.1.58, p. 1553]\n\n\nThis quote shows that ultimately the feeling of pleasure is an\nillusion and that our ordinary existence is necessarily beset with\npain. This demonstrates the link between feeling and error, according\nto the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. Both pleasure and\npain are two factors that are responsible for our notion of\n\u201cI\u201d that prevents us from attaining final liberation.\nTherefore, the pursuit of pleasure is futile and ought to be abandoned\nin favour of final liberation.\n\nFor the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, pleasure and\npain are not forms of cognition because they have different causes\nthan cognitions [VS and VSU 10.1.5\u20136]. This means that we can\nhave a cognition without a feeling and we can also have a feeling\nwithout a cognition. In addition, they are experienced differently\n[NM, vol. 1, p. 118]. This separation between cognitions and feelings,\ntogether with the view that feelings are defects that disturb\ncognitions, means that feelings are regarded as purely negative. They\nlead to an attachment to the world which causes a sense of self and\nthis sense of self provides an obstacle to liberation.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view shows similarities with the\nreceived view of the emotions in Western philosophy with regard to the\npoint that feelings are a disturbance of cognition. However, in many\nWestern accounts cognition is regarded as an end in itself because it\ncoincides with the ideal of rational thinking, whereas according to\nthe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers cognition is not an\nend in itself. Rather, it is supposed to lead to the conclusion that\nfinal liberation is the ultimate aim and final liberation means the\nend of cognition.\n",
