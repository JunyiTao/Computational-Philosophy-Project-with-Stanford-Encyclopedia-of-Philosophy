    "main_text": "\n\nNormativism in the theory of meaning and content is the view that\nlinguistic meaning and/or intentional content are essentially\nnormative. As both normativity and its essentiality to meaning/content\ncan be interpreted in a number of different ways, there is now a whole\nfamily of views laying claim to the slogan \u201cmeaning/content is\nnormative\u201d.\n\nIn this essay, we discuss a number of central normativist theses, and\nwe begin by identifying different versions of meaning normativism,\npresenting the arguments that have been put forth for and against\nthem. We then continue by discussing content normativism, providing an\noverview of the contemporary debate. Both debates are very much\non-going and at this point there is little consensus as to whether\nnormativism holds for either meaning or content. Since the first\npublication of this essay much of the debate has focused on two of its\ncentral issues: First, it has been debated whether meaning normativism\ncan be derived from the fact that meaningful expressions necessarily\nhave correctness conditions. This is the argument we labeled the\n\u201cthe simple argument\u201d and in section 2.1.1 we discuss\ncontributions to the debate. Second, the nature of rule-guidance has\nbeen much discussed, in particular relating to content normativism,\nand new proposals have been made as to how it is to be understood. We\ndiscuss this in sections 2.2 and 3.2. Finally, the debate surrounding\nnormativity has also evolved into a discussion about the normativity\nof rationality and around the question of whether or not logic sets\nthe standards for how we ought to reason. Though in this entry we will\nprimarily devote our attention to the meaning and content, we will\nalso make reference to related issues concerning the normativity of\nrationality.\n",
