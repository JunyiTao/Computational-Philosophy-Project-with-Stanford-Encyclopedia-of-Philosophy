    "main_text": "Projective geometry || Coordinate transformations; Kleinian geometry\n3.1 Coordinate transformations; Kleinian geometry\n\nKlein\u2019s Erlangen Programme and what has become known as the\nKleinian view of geometry is described in the entry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry.\n It has come to stand as the principal source of the view that\ngeometry can be defined as a group acting on a space, and a\ngeometrical property is any property invariant under all the\ntransformations of the appropriate group.\n\nKlein advocated this view in a pamphlet published when he became a\nProfessor at the University of Erlangen in 1872 and other publications\nin journals in the 1870s in order to re-unify geometry. He presented a\nway of showing that metrical geometries, such as Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometry, and other geometries, such as inversive\ngeometry and birational geometry, can be regarded as special cases of\nprojective geometry (as can affine geometry, which he did not know\nabout in 1872).\n\nThe fundamental geometry was real projective geometry, say in two\ndimensions. In this geometry the space is real projective space, and\nthe group is the group of all projective transformations. Such a\ntransformation maps points to points, lines to lines, curves of degree\n\\(n\\) to curves of degree \\(n\\), and, importantly, the cross-ratio of\nfour collinear points is left unaltered by any projective\ntransformation. In the Kleinian viewpoint, this establishes that\npoints, lines, curves of degree \\(n\\), and the cross-ratio of four\ncollinear points are properties of the geometry.\n\nProjective geometry incorporated the other geometries in a variety of\nways. Klein indicated that one may seek to add to the list of\nconfigurations, in which case the group that keeps them invariant will\ngenerally be smaller than the principal group, or one may seek to\nenlarge the group, in which case the class of invariant configurations\nwill generally shrink. Klein succeeded in showing that non-Euclidean\ngeometry arises as a sub-geometry by confining attention to the\ninterior of a conic in projective space and to the subgroup that maps\nthe interior of that conic to itself (see Klein 1871, 1873).\n\nThe epistemological character of Klein\u2019s Erlangen Programme\nbecomes clearer when one looks at how it resolved the well-known\nnagging doubt about the definition of cross-ratio in projective\ngeometry. Klein\u2019s answer proceeded by analogy with lengths in\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean geometry. In those geometries, the\ncorresponding group preserves straight lines, and any point can be\nmapped to any other point, but there is no transformation in the group\nthat can map a line segment onto a proper sub-segment of itself. Any\narbitrary but fixed line segment (determined by two points) can\ntherefore be taken as unit of length and used to measure line\nsegments, by constructing arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it\nand arranging them as one would a ruler. Now to measure the length of\na segment \\(AB\\), one simply lays the point \\(A\\) at one end of the\nruler and sees where the point \\(B\\) falls on the ruler.\n\nKlein\u2019s insight, following von Staudt, was that an exactly\nsimilar argument involving quadruples of collinear points can be used\nto define cross-ratio in projective geometry. The projective group\npreserves straight lines, and any ordered triple of collinear points\ncan be mapped to any ordered triple of collinear points, and the map\nthat sends a given ordered triple of distinct points to another\nordered triple of distinct points is unique, but there is no\ntransformation in the group that can map a quadruple of four collinear\npoints onto an arbitrary such quadruple. Any arbitrary but fixed\ncollinear quadruple can therefore be taken as unit of\n\u2018size\u2019, and a complicated but not difficult argument\nallows one to produce arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it that\ncan be used to measure cross-ratios, by arranging as one would a\nruler. Rather than give the details, it is better to give this\nsuggestive illustration of why this can be done. Let the cross-ratio\nof the four collinear points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), \\(S\\) be measured by\nmapping the points onto the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on the\nreal line, where \\(A\\) is at the origin, \\(C\\) at \\(\\infty\\), and\n\\(D\\) at 1, so it is the position of \\(B\\) that determines the\ncross-ratio. This is uniquely determined, and if the length of \\(AB\\)\nis \\(x\\), we find that \\(AB{.}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{.}CB = x\\).\n\nIn the language of the time, length is a two-point invariant of the\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean group, and cross-ratio is a four-point\ninvariant of the projective group.\n",
