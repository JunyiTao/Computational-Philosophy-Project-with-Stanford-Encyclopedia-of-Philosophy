    "main_text": "Defining Renaissance Natural Philosophy\n1. Defining Renaissance Natural Philosophy\n\nRenaissance natural philosophy defies easy definition, since\ndescriptions of it may oversimplify, either by reducing it to its\nconnections with medieval science or, alternatively, forcing it into a\nteleology that culminates in the Scientific Revolution of the\nseventeenth century. Hence, there have been two opposing tendencies in\nscholarship: one which conflates the natural philosophy of the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the variety practiced in the\nMiddle Ages, even going so far as to interpret the Renaissance as a\nperiod of conservatism in this regard; another which emphasizes the\nrole of Renaissance natural philosophy as a \u201cprecursor\u201d of\nmodern science, even at the cost of ignoring or removing its\nconnections to disciplines today considered pseudo-scientific, such as\nphysiognomy, astrology, and magic. Recent contributions, however, have\nhelped to outline the characteristics of Renaissance natural\nphilosophy in their own terms. Medieval natural philosophy was usually\nbased in the corpus aristotelicum and practiced in\nuniversities. Yet this did not mean that its approach was purely\nstatic or regressive; on the contrary, thinkers like Jean Buridan,\nBiagio Pelacani, and Nicole Oresme took Aristotelian physics and\nmechanics in new directions in medieval Europe. Nevertheless, the\nnature of medieval universities was such that teaching was heavily\ncontrolled by authorities, and especially outside of Italy both\nmetaphysics and theology exercised a strong influence. This imposed\nsome limitation to the directions in which scientific theorization\ncould advance. Paradoxically, it was the return of another, rival\nschool of thought\u2014Platonism\u2014that ultimately allowed for\nmore freedom within the Aristotelian tradition. Though Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy had never completely disappeared during the course of the\nMiddle Ages, the consolidation of a Neoplatonic school in the\nfifteenth century led to the clear distinctions between the spheres\nwhich properly belonged to the two great thinkers of the ancient\nworld. While Plato was regarded as a theologian and master of the\nmetaphysical realities, Aristotle was seen as an investigator of the\nsublunar world subject to generation and corruption. The recovery of\nthis ancient dichotomy had the effect of undermining the longstanding\nties between Aristotelianism and Scholasticism, and opened up new\nspaces for philosophy unimpaired by metaphysical limitations.\nMoreover, an open dialogue with the Platonic tradition, caused several\nprofessors to question Aristotle\u2019s coherence and reliability. At\nthe same time, also Platonism and other brands of ancient\nphilosophy\u2014Stoicism, Skepticism, and\nEpicureanism\u2014stimulated reflection on the natural world in\ndifferent ways, also in terms of method. The application of these\nideas to various fields of inquiry gave Renaissance natural thought a\ndistinctive identity, forged in continuous dialectic with\nAristotelianism itself. Aristotelianism therefore represented the\ndriving force behind Renaissance philosophy of nature, both because of\nits plurality of approaches and internal debates, and also because it\nserved as the polemical target of those who challenged the traditional\nparadigm of university teaching: both followers and adversaries of\nAristotle had constantly to negotiate with his authoritative legacy,\nand manipulate it. Finally, other factors of a non-speculative\ncharacter also had an impact on natural philosophy: technological\ninnovations such as printing, the telescope and the microscope,\ngeographical discoveries, and developments within the universities\nthemselves, such as the institution of botanical gardens.\n",
