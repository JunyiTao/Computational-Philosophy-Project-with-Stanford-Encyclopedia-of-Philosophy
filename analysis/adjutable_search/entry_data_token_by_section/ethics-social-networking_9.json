    "main_text": "Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services || Friendship, Virtue and the Good Life on Social Networking Services\n3.3 Friendship, Virtue and the Good Life on Social Networking Services\n\nSNS can facilitate many types of relational connections: LinkedIn\nencourages social relations organized around our professional lives,\nTwitter is useful for creating lines of communication between ordinary\nindividuals and figures of public interest, MySpace was for a time a\npopular way for musicians to promote themselves and communicate with\ntheir fans, and Facebook, which began as a way to link university\ncohorts and now connects people across the globe, also hosts business\nprofiles aimed at establishing links to existing and future customers.\nYet the overarching relational concept in the SNS universe has been,\nand continues to be, the \u2018friend,\u2019 as underscored by the\nnow-common use of this term as a verb to refer to acts of instigating\nor confirming relationships on SNS.\n\nThis appropriation and expansion of the concept \u2018friend\u2019\nby SNS has provoked a great deal of scholarly interest from\nphilosophers and social scientists, more so than any other ethical\nconcern except perhaps privacy. Early concerns about SNS friendship\ncentered on the expectation that such sites would be used primarily to\nbuild \u2018virtual\u2019 friendships between physically separated\nindividuals lacking a \u2018real-world\u2019 or\n\u2018face-to-face\u2019 connection. This perception was an\nunderstandable extrapolation from earlier patterns of Internet\nsociality, patterns that had prompted philosophical worries about\nwhether online friendships could ever be \u2018as good as the real\nthing\u2019 or were doomed to be pale substitutes for embodied\n\u2018face to face\u2019 connections (Cocking and Matthews 2000).\nThis view was robustly opposed by Adam Briggle (2008), who claimed\nthat online friendships might enjoy certain unique advantages. For\nexample, Briggle asserted that friendships formed online might be more\ncandid than offline ones, thanks to the sense of security provided by\nphysical distance (2008, 75). He also noted the way in which\nasynchronous written communications can promote more deliberate and\nthoughtful exchanges (2008, 77).\n\nThese sorts of questions about how online friendships measure up to\noffline ones, along with questions about whether or to what extent\nonline friendships encroach upon users\u2019 commitments to embodied,\n\u2018real-world\u2019 relations with friends, family members and\ncommunities, defined the ethical problem-space of online friendship as\nSNS began to emerge. But it did not take long for empirical studies of\nactual SNS usage trends to force a profound rethinking of this\nproblem-space. Within five years of Facebook\u2019s launch, it was\nevident that a significant majority of SNS users were relying on these\nsites primarily to maintain and enhance relationships with those with\nwhom they also had a strong offline connection\u2014including close\nfamily members, high-school and college friends and co-workers\n(Ellison, Steinfeld and Lampe 2007; Ito et al. 2009; Smith 2011). Nor\nare SNS used to facilitate purely online exchanges\u2014many SNS\nusers today rely on the sites\u2019 functionalities to organize\neverything from cocktail parties to movie nights, outings to athletic\nor cultural events, family reunions and community meetings. Mobile SNS\napplications amplify this type of functionality further, by enabling\nfriends to locate one another in their community in real-time,\nenabling spontaneous meetings at restaurants, bars and shops that\nwould otherwise happen only by coincidence.\n\nYet lingering ethical concerns remain about the way in which SNS can\ndistract users from the needs of those in their immediate physical\nsurroundings (consider the widely lamented trend of users obsessively\nchecking their social media feeds during family dinners, business\nmeetings, romantic dates and symphony performances). Such phenomena,\nwhich scholars like Sherry Turkle (2011, 2015) continue to worry are\nindicative of a growing cultural tolerance for being \u2018alone\ntogether,\u2019 bring a new complexity to earlier philosophical\nconcerns about the emergence of a zero-sum game between offline\nrelationships and their virtual SNS competitors. They have also\nprompted a shift of ethical focus away from the question of whether\nonline relationships are \u201creal\u201d friendships (Cocking and\nMatthews 2000), to how well the real friendships we bring to SNS are\nbeing served there (Vallor 2012). The debate over the value and\nquality of online friendships continues (Sharp 2012; Froding and\nPeterson 2012; Elder 2014; Turp 2020; Kristj\u00e1nsson 2021); in\nlarge part because the typical pattern of those friendships, like most\nsocial networking phenomena, continues to evolve.\n\nSuch concerns intersect with broader philosophical questions about\nwhether and how the classical ethical ideal of \u2018the good\nlife\u2019 can be engaged in the 21st century. Pak-Hang\nWong claims that this question requires us to broaden the standard\napproach to information ethics from a narrow focus on the\n\u201cright/the just\u201d (2010, 29) that defines ethical action\nnegatively (e.g., in terms of violations of privacy,\ncopyright, etc.) to a framework that conceives of a positive\nethical trajectory for our technological choices; for example, the\nethical opportunity to foster compassionate and caring communities, or\nto create an environmentally sustainable economic order. Edward Spence\n(2011) further suggests that to adequately address the significance of\nSNS and related information and communication technologies for the\ngood life, we must also expand the scope of philosophical inquiry\nbeyond its present concern with narrowly interpersonal ethics to the\nmore universal ethical question of prudential wisdom. Do SNS\nand related technologies help us to cultivate the broader intellectual\nvirtue of knowing what it is to live well, and how to best pursue it?\nOr do they tend to impede its development?\n\nThis concern about prudential wisdom and the good life is part of a\ngrowing philosophical interest in using the resources of classical and\ncontemporary virtue ethics to evaluate the impact of SNS and related\ntechnologies (Vallor 2016, 2010; Wong 2012; Ess 2008). This program of\nresearch promotes inquiry into the impact of SNS not merely on the\ncultivation of prudential virtue, but on the development of a host of\nother moral and communicative virtues, such as honesty, patience,\njustice, loyalty, benevolence and empathy.\n",
