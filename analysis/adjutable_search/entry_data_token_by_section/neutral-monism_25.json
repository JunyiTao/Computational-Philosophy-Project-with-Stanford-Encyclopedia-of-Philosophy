    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Russellian Monism, Panprotopsychism, and Panqualityism\n5.4 Russellian Monism, Panprotopsychism, and Panqualityism\n\nIn the search for a solution to the mind-body problem one may be\ncaptivated by the thought that we know less about matter than we are\ncommonly led to believe. All we do (or can) know are the dispositional\nproperties of\n matter.[24]\n When combined with the insight that dispositions need categorical\ngrounds, one discovers that one\u2019s conception of matter is\nradically incomplete. In addition to all the dispositional properties\nthat physics treats of, matter must have intrinsic categorical\nproperties. Since the nature of these intrinsic properties is unknown,\nthe following bold thought suggests itself. Perhaps these properties\nplay a dual role: in addition to grounding to dispositional properties\nof matter, they also serve as the grounds of our conscious experience.\nThese are the kinds of considerations that may lead one to Russellian\nmonism, the view that\n\nmatter has intrinsic properties that both constitute consciousness and\nserve as categorical bases for the dispositional properties described\nin physics. (Alter and Nagasawa 2015: 1)\n\n\nThe basic constituents of the world of Russellian monism are the\nfundamental entities of physics. But their most fundamental properties\nare not ones fully captured by physical descriptions, but rather the\nintrinsic properties in virtue of which they fit such descriptions.\nAnd these very same intrinsic properties, when arranged appropriately,\ngive rise to conscious experience.\n\nThere are many versions of Russellian Monism. Differences are due, in\npart, to varying views about the relations between the intrinsic\nproperties, on the one side, and the mental and material properties,\non the other. But the central disagreement concerns the nature of the\nintrinsic properties. They have been held to be physical (Stoljar\n2001; Pereboom 2011, 2015; Montero 2015), mental (Bolender 2001;\nChalmers 2017; Schneider 2017), mental and physical (Strawson 2015,\n2016, 2020; Goff 2017), or neutral (Coleman 2014, 2017a). Accordingly,\nthere are physicalist, idealist, panpsychist, and neutral monist\nversions or Russellian monism. The precise nature of these\ndisagreements is difficult to pin down, given the number of different\nnotions of the mental and the material that are in play in this\ndiscussion (see 1.1 above).\n\nThe best-known version of Russellian neutral monism is\npanprotopsychism\u2014a view that David Chalmers has explored over\nmany years (Chalmers 1996, 2015). In the standard form of this theory\nthe postulated intrinsic properties are characterized as being neither\nexperiential (they are proto-psychic) nor physical (they lack\nthe structural/dispositional nature of physical properties). That\nmakes them neutral (in the Neither Sense). But this purely\nnegative characterization of the intrinsic properties has struck many\nas unsatisfying.\n\nA variant of this theory\u2014panqualityism\u2014addresses this\nproblem in a most satisfactory manner, while creating new problems of\nits own.\n\nIt takes redness, greenness, sweetness, roundness, etc.\u2014the\nprimitive sensory qualities given to us in experience, and considered\njust as such\u2014to be the intrinsic properties of the fundamental\nphysical entities (cf. Chalmers 2015: 272). One\u2019s being aware of\nredness\u2014i.e., the property of phenomenal redness\u2014is\nmental, but redness itself is not. Nor is (this kind of) redness a\nphysical, structural property. So panqualityism has secured a neutral\nbase with which we are intimately familiar. Chalmers conjectures\nthat\n\nversions of [panqualityism] were popular among the neutral monists of\nthe early twentieth century, including William James (1904b), Ernst\nMach (1886), and Bertrand Russell (1921). (Chalmers 2015: 271)\n\n\nBut panqualityism also has a growing number of contemporary defenders.\nSam Coleman, for instance, has developed panqualityism in a number of\ninteresting new directions and restored its place within ongoing\ndebates about the metaphysics of mind (Coleman 2014, 2017a, 2017b,\n2022).\n\nOf course, one may wonder how an electron\u2019s being red can ground\nits negative charge or share Wilfrid Sellars\u2019 (1963: 35) view\nthat it makes no sense to think that fundamental physical entities\nmight have primitive sensory qualities like redness. One may also\nshare Chalmers\u2019 worry that qualities, no matter how intricately\narranged, cannot ground the phenomenal properties of our experience\nfor \u201cno instantiations of qualities ever necessitate awareness\nof qualities\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273). Whether panqualityists can\noffer satisfactory replies to such objections is a matter of ongoing\ndebate.\n\nWhat the consideration of Russellian Monism shows is that (i) new\nversions of neutral monism are currently being developed that\nemphasize somewhat different considerations than those of traditional\nneutral monism; (ii) but even the most promising and well-developed\nversions of Russellian neutral monism face considerable\nchallenges.\n",
