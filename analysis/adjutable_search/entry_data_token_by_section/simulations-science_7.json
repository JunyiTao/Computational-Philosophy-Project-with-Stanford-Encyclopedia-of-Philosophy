    "main_text": "Purposes of Simulation\n3. Purposes of Simulation\n\n\nThere are three general categories of purposes to which computer\nsimulations can be put. Simulations can be used for\nheuristic purposes, for the purpose of predicting data that we do not\nhave, and for generating understanding of data that we do already\nhave.\n\n\nUnder the category of heuristic models, simulations can be further\nsubdivided into those used to communicate knowledge to others, and\nthose used to represent information to ourselves. When Watson and Crick\nplayed with tin plates and wire, they were doing the latter at first,\nand the former when they showed the results to others. When the army\ncorps built the model of the San Francisco Bay to convince the voting\npopulation that a particular intervention was dangerous, they were\nusing it for this kind of heuristic purpose. Computer simulations can\nbe used for both of these kinds of purposes\u2014to explore features of\npossible representational structures; or to communicate knowledge to\nothers. For example: computer simulations of natural processes, such as\nbacterial reproduction, tectonic shifting, chemical reactions, and\nevolution have all been used in classroom settings to help students\nvisualize hidden structure in phenomena and processes that are\nimpractical, impossible, or costly to illustrate in a \u201cwet\u201d\nlaboratory setting.\n\n\nAnother broad class of purposes to which computer simulations can be\nput is in telling us about how we should expect some system in the\nreal world to behave under a particular set of circumstances. Loosely\nspeaking: computer simulation can be used for prediction. We can use\nmodels to predict the future, or to retrodict the past; we can use\nthem to make precise predictions or loose and general ones. With\nregard to the relative precision of the predictions we make with\nsimulations, we can be slightly more fine-grained in our\ntaxonomy. There are a) Point predictions: Where will the planet Mars\nbe on October 21st, 2300? b) \u201cQualitative\u201d or global or\nsystemic predictions: Is the orbit of this planet stable? What scaling\nlaw emerges in these kinds of systems? What is the fractal dimension\nof the attractor for systems of this kind? and c) Range predictions:\nIt is 66% likely that the global mean surface temperature will\nincrease by between 2\u20135 degrees C by the year 2100; it is\n\u201chighly likely\u201d that sea level will rise by at least two\nfeet; it is \u201cimplausible\u201d that the thermohaline will shut\ndown in the next 50 years.\n\n\nFinally, simulations can be used to understand systems and their\nbehavior. If we already have data telling us how some system\nbehaves, we can use computer simulation to answer questions about how\nthese events could possibly have occurred; or about how those events\nactually did occur.\n\n\nWhen thinking about the topic of the next section, the epistemology\nof computer simulations, we should also keep in mind that the\nprocedures needed to sanction the results of simulations will often\ndepend, in large part, on which of the above kind of purpose or\npurposes the simulation will be put to.\n",
