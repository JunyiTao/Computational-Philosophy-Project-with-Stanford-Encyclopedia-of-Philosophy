    "main_text": "(Trans) Gender Trouble || Undoing Gender\n5.4 Undoing Gender\n\nButler's more recent work has to some extent attempted to\nmitigate some of the preceding concerns (2004). She indicates that she\nhas been informed by what she calls \u201cThe New Gender\nPolitics\u201d (i.e., the activism initiated by intersexual,\ntransgender, and transsexual people) (Butler 2004, 4). Where the notion\nof \u201cdoing\u201d gender is central to her earlier work, the\nnotion of \u201cundoing\u201d now becomes central. She is concerned\nspecifically with the notion of the \u201chuman\u201d and the fact\nthat some people are recognized as less human or, in some ways, not\nrecognized as human at all (2004, 2). Insofar as this is a function of\nwhat counts as intelligible gender, one can be \u201cundone\u201d by\ngender (rendered unintelligible or recognized as less human) (2\u20133).\nInsofar as gender is relational, and for Butler now often involves\nacting for another, one can be \u201cundone\u201d by those to whom we\nare vulnerable (22\u20135). Thus, we may be undone through the loss of a\nclose friend, just as we may be undone through acts of phobic\nviolence.\n\nButler now seeks to find a balance between the demand for autonomy\n(required by a democratizing ideal to which she explicitly subscribes)\nand the fact that such autonomy does not flow from an atomistic self,\nbut rather its grounding in the particular ideologies and institutions\nwhich necessarily connect us with others and deny certain individuals\nthe status of human (37\u20139, 223\u20137). Her demand, then, is to\ndistinguish norms which foreclose the possibility of livable lives for\nthose rendered marginal, and those which open up possibilities\n\u201cto live and breathe and move\u201d(2004, 8, 31,219). In this\nway, she aims to offer a more nuanced approach to the importance of\nidentity in democratic politics, explicitly taking up a \u201ctension\nthat arises between queer theory and both intersex and transsexual\nactivism\u201d which \u201ccenters on the question of sex assignment\nand the desirability of identity categories\u201d (7). Effectively,\nthen, Butler recognizes that insofar as queer theory aims to undermine\nthe \u201cillusion\u201d of stable identities while arguing against\nthe viability of a politics based upon identity categories, it is in\nopposition to intersex and transsexual activism both of which are\ncentered upon identities (i.e., intersex identity and transsexual\nidentity). Conceding some ground, Butler recognizes that a livable\nlife \u201cdoes require various degrees of stability\u201d (8). Her\nearlier work found subversion only in the disruption of\nstable identity. She recognizes here, however, that without some\nstability, life is not livable.\n\nShe also reconsiders her earlier appeal to drag. For Butler, what is\nimportant about drag is only that it reveals the possibility that what\nis taken as a given is really cultural and that it can be contested and\nassigned new meanings (213\u20139). However, while her earlier view had\ninsisted more strongly upon the importance of subverting the norm\nthrough its exposure as imitative, what now seem more important are\nthe different kinds of norms at stake, and whether they\nconduce to possibilities of livable lives for those who are\nmarginalized.\n\nNotably, Butler considers the political tension between those trans\nactivists who would oppose the Gender Identity Disorder as\npathologizing and paternalistic, and those who insist upon its\nimportance in securing access to medical technologies, recommending the\nstrategic use of the diagnosis. While the latter view underestimates\nthat degree to which such a move further empowers the existing\nstructural arrangement and inflicts damage upon those who undergo the\nregulations (82\u20133), the former fail to see how, in practice, movement\naway from some medical regulation is not going to be possible without\nalso completely undermining access to the technology (90\u20131). In\nButler's view, the institutional mechanisms which permit access\nthrough medical regulation and psychological evaluation, allow for a\nkind of culturally circumscribed access to autonomy, but only at the\ncost of \u201cundoing\u201d oneself (91). Butler sees this bind of\n\u201cundoing oneself\u201d in order to \u201cdo oneself\u201d as\ncharacteristic of the general way in which autonomy is both culturally\ndenied and bestowed (100\u20131).\n\nWhile Butler's modified view in some ways eases the tension\nbetween her theory of gender and the demands of trans politics, it is\nworth noting that the theory does not deliver many details in\nterms of trans oppression and possibilities for resistance. Her\ndiscussion of Gender Identity Disorder is a case in point. It leaves us\nwith a powerful illustration of her theoretical claims about autonomy;\nyet it does not offer much in terms of concrete political\nstrategies.\n",
