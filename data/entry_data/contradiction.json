    "main_text": "\n1. LNC as Indemonstrable\n\n\nThe twin foundations of Aristotle's logic are the law of\nnon-contradiction (LNC) (also known as the law of contradiction, LC) and the\nlaw of excluded middle (LEM). In Metaphysics Book \u0393,\nLNC\u2014\u201cthe most certain of all principles\u201d\u2014is\ndefined as follows:\n It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time\nboth belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect,\nand all other specifications that might be made, let them be added to\nmeet local objections (1005b19\u201323).\n\n\nIt will be noted that this statement of the LNC is an explicitly modal\nclaim about the incompatibility of opposed properties applying to the\nsame object (with the appropriate provisos). Since \u0141ukasiewicz\n(1910), this ontological version of the principle has been\nrecognized as distinct from, and for Aristotle arguably prior to,\nthe logical formulation (\u201cThe opinion that opposite\nassertions are not simultaneously true is the firmest of\nall\u201d\u2014Met. 1011b13\u201314) and the psychological\nformulation (\u201cIt is impossible for anyone to believe that the\nsame thing is and is not, as some consider Heraclitus\nsaid\u201d\u2014Met. 1005b23\u201325) offered elsewhere in Book \u0393;\nwe return to Heraclitus below. Wedin (2004a), who argues for the\nprimacy of the ontological version (see also Meyer 2008, Other\nInternet Resources), formalizes it as\n\u00ac\u25ca(\u2203x)(Fx \u2227\n\u00acFx). These three formulations of LNC differ in important\nrespects, in particular as to whether the law is explicitly modal in\ncharacter, whether it applies to propositions or to properties and\nobjects, and whether it requires the invocation of a metalinguistic\ntruth predicate. (See also the entry \n Aristotle on non-contradiction.) \n\n\nFor Aristotle, the status of LNC as a first, indemonstrable principle\nis obvious. Those who mulishly demand a proof of LNC clearly\n\u201clack education\u201d: since \u201ca demonstration of\neverything is impossible\u201d, resulting in infinite regress. At\nleast some principles must be taken as primitive\naxiomata rather than derived from other\npropositions\u2014and what principle more merits this status than\nLNC? (1006a6\u201312). In first philosophy, as in mathematics, an axiom is\nboth indemonstrable and indispensable; without LNC, Aristotle argues, \u201ca is\nF\u201d and \u201ca is not F\u201d are\nindistinguishable and no argumentation is possible. While Sophists and\n\u201ceven many physicists\u201d may claim that it is\npossible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time and\nin the same respect, such a position self-destructs \u201cif only our\nopponent says something\u201d, since as soon as he opens his mouth to\nmake an assertion, any assertion, he must accept LNC. But\nwhat if he does not open his mouth? Against such an\nindividual \u201cit is ridiculous to seek an argument\u201d for he\nis no more than a vegetable (1006a1\u201315).\n\n\nThe celebrated Arab commentator Avicenna (ibn S\u012bn\u0101,\n980\u20131037) confronts the LNC skeptic with a more severe outcome than\nAristotle's vegetable reduction: \u201cAs for the obstinate, he must\nbe plunged into fire, since fire and non-fire are identical. Let him\nbe beaten, since suffering and not suffering are the same. Let him be\ndeprived of food and drink, since eating and drinking are identical to\nabstaining\u201d (Metaphysics I.8, 53.13\u201315).\nThe role of LNC as the basic, indemonstrable \u201cfirst\nprinciple\u201d is affirmed by Leibniz, for whom LNC is taken as\ninterdefinable with the Law of Identity that states that everything is\nidentical to itself: \u201cNothing should be taken as first\nprinciples but experiences and the axiom of identity or (what is the\nsame thing) contradiction, which is primitive, since otherwise there\nwould be no difference between truth and falsehood, and all\ninvestigation would cease at once, if to say yes or no were a matter\nof indifference\u201d (Leibniz 1696/Langley 1916: 13\u201314). For\nLeibniz, everybody\u2014even \u201cbarbarians\u201d\u2014must\ntacitly assume LNC as part of innate knowledge implicitly called upon\nat every moment, thus demonstrating the insufficiency of Locke's\nempiricism (ibid.,\n 77).[1]\n\n\nIn accounting for the incompatibility of truth and falsity, LNC lies\nat the heart of Aristotle's theory of opposition, governing both\ncontradictories and contraries.\n (See traditional square of opposition.)\n Contradictory opposites (\u201cShe is sitting\u201d/\u201cShe is\nnot sitting\u201d) are mutually exhaustive as well as mutually\ninconsistent; one member of the pair must be true and the other\nfalse, assuming with Aristotle that singular statements with \nvacuous subjects are always false. As it was put by the medievals,\ncontradictory opposites divide\nthe true and the false between them; for Aristotle, this is the\nprimary form of\n opposition.[2]\n Contrary opposites (\u201cHe is happy\u201d/\u201cHe is\nsad\u201d) are mutually inconsistent but not necessarily exhaustive;\nthey may be simultaneously false, though not simultaneously true. LNC\napplies to both forms of opposition in that neither contradictories\nnor contraries may belong to the same object at the same time and in\nthe same respect (Metaphysics 1011b17\u201319). What distinguishes\nthe two forms of opposition is a second indemonstrable principle, the\nlaw of excluded middle (LEM): \u201cOf any one subject, one thing\nmust be either asserted or denied\u201d (Metaphysics\n1011b24). Both laws pertain to contradictories, as in a paired\naffirmation (\u201cS is P\u201d) and denial\n(\u201cS isn't P\u201d): the negation is true\nwhenever the affirmation is false, and the affirmation is true when\nthe negation is false. Thus, a corresponding affirmation and negation\ncannot both be true, by LNC, but neither can they both be\nfalse, by LEM. But while LNC applies both to contradictory\nand contrary oppositions, LEM holds only for contradictories:\n\u201cNothing can exist between two contradictories, but something\nmay exist between contraries\u201d (Metaphysics 1055b2): a\ndog cannot be both black and white, but it may be neither.\n\n\nAs Aristotle explains in the Categories, the opposition\nbetween contradictories\u2014\u201cstatements opposed to each other\nas affirmation and negation\u201d\u2014is defined in two\nways. First, unlike contrariety, contradiction is restricted to\nstatements or propositions; terms are never related as\ncontradictories. Second, \u201cin this case, and in this case only,\nit is necessary for the one to be true and the other false\u201d\n(13b2\u20133). \n\n\nOpposition between terms cannot be contradictory in\nnature, both because only statements (subject-predicate combinations)\ncan be true or false (Categories 13b3\u201312) and because any two\nterms may simultaneously fail to apply to a given\n subject.[3]\n But two statements may be members of either a contradictory or a\ncontrary opposition. Such statements may be simultaneously false,\nalthough (as with contradictories) they may not be simultaneously\ntrue. The most striking aspect of the exposition for a modern reader\nlies in Aristotle's selection of illustrative material. Rather than\nchoosing an uncontroversial example involving mediate\ncontraries, those allowing an unexcluded middle (e.g. \u201cThis dog\nis white\u201d/\u201cThis dog is black\u201d; \u201cSocrates is\ngood\u201d/\u201cSocrates is bad\u201d), Aristotle offers a pair of\nsentences containing immediate contraries, \u201cSocrates is\nsick\u201d/\u201cSocrates is well\u201d. These propositions may\nboth be false, even though every person is either ill or well:\n\u201cFor if Socrates exists, one will be true and the other false,\nbut if he does not exist, both will be false; for neither\n\u2018Socrates is sick\u2019 nor \u2018Socrates is well\u2019 will\nbe true, if Socrates does not exist at all\u201d (13b17\u201319). But\ngiven a corresponding affirmation and negation, one will always be\ntrue and the other false; the negation \u201cSocrates is not\nsick\u201d is true whether the snub-nosed philosopher is healthy or\nnon-existent: \u201cfor if he does not exist, \u2018he is\nsick\u2019 is false but \u2018he is not sick\u2019 true\u201d\n(13b26\u201335).\n\n\nMembers of a canonical pair of contradictories are formally identical\nexcept for the negative particle:\nAn affirmation is a statement affirming something of\nsomething, a negation is a statement denying something of something\u2026It\nis clear that for every affirmation there is an opposite negation, and\nfor every negation there is an opposite affirmation\u2026Let us call an\naffirmation and a negation which are opposite a contradiction\n(De Interpretatione 17a25\u201335).\n\n\nBut this criterion, satisfied simply enough in the case of singular\nexpressions, must be recast in the case of quantified expressions,\nboth those which \u201csignify universally\u201d (\u201cevery\ncat\u201d, \u201cno cat\u201d) and those which do not (\u201csome\ncat\u201d, \u201cnot every cat\u201d).\n\n\nFor such cases, Aristotle shifts from a formal to a semantically based\ncriterion of opposition (17b16\u201325). Members of\nan A/O pair (\u201cEvery man is\nwhite\u201d/\u201cNot every man is white\u201d)\nor I/E pair (\u201cSome man is\nwhite\u201d/\u201cNo man is white\u201d) are contradictories\nbecause in any state of affairs one member of each pair must be true\nand the other false. Members of an A/E\npair\u2014\u201cEvery man is just\u201d/\u201cNo man is\njust\u201d\u2014constitute contraries, since these cannot both be\ntrue simultaneously but can both be false. The contradictories of\nthese contraries (\u201cNot every man is just\u201d/\u201cSome man\nis just\u201d) can be simultaneously true with reference to the same\nsubject (17b23\u201325). This last opposition of I\nand O statements, later to be dubbed subcontraries\nbecause they appear below the contraries on the traditional square, is\na peculiar opposition indeed; Aristotle elsewhere (Prior\nAnalytics 63b21\u201330) sees I and O as\n\u201conly verbally opposed\u201d, given the consistency of\nthe I statement, e.g. \u201cSome Greeks are bald\u201d,\nwith the corresponding O statement, \u201cSome Greeks aren't\nbald\u201d (or \u201cNot all Greeks are bald\u201d, which doesn't\nnecessarily amount to the same thing, given existential import;\nsee traditional square of opposition). \n\n\nThe same relations obtain for modal propositions, for propositions\ninvolving binary connectives like \u201cand\u201d and\n\u201cor\u201d, for quantificational adverbs, and for a range of\nother operators that can be mapped onto the square in analogous ways\nutilizing the same notions of contradictory and contrary opposition\nand with unilateral entailment definable on duals (see Horn\n1989). Thus for example we have the modal square below, based\non De Interpretatione 21b10ff. and Prior Analytics\n32a18\u201328, where the box and diamond symbols denote necessity and\npossibility, respectively. As with universal affirmatives and\nuniversal negatives, necessity and impossibility constitute\ncontraries: \u201cA priest must marry\u201d and \u201cA priest\ncan\u2019t marry\u201d can both be (and, on the Episcopalian reading, are)\nfalse but cannot both be true. \u201cA priest can marry\u201d and\n\u201cA priest can (if he wants) not marry\u201d are subcontraries;\nthese can be simultaneously true but not simultaneously false. And\nnecessity, as in \u201cA priest must marry\u201d, unilaterally\nentails its possibility dual counterpart, \u201cA priest may\nmarry\u201d.\n(1) Modal Square\n\n\n\nIn the twelfth century, Peter of Spain (1972: 7) offers a\nparticularly elegant formulation in his Tractatus; it will be\nseen that these apply to the modal propositions in (1) as well as to\nthe quantificational statements in the original square:\n\nThe law of contradictories is such that if one\ncontradictory is true the other is false and vice versa, for nothing\ncan be simultaneously true and false.\n \n \nEach contradictory is equivalent to (entails and is entailed by) the\nnegation of the other.\n\n\nThe law of contraries is such that if one is true the other is false\nbut not vice versa.\n\n  \nEach contrary statement entails the negation of the other but\nnot vice versa. [E.g. \u201cI am happy\u201d unilaterally entails\n\u201cI am not unhappy\u201d; \u201cIt is necessary that\n\u03a6\u201d unilaterally entails \u201cIt is not impossible that\n\u03a6\u201d.]\n\n\nThe law of subcontraries is such that if one is false the other is\ntrue but not vice versa.  \n\n\nBy these definitions, the three central species of opposition\u2014contradiction, contrariety, and subcontrariety\u2014are mutually inconsistent.\n2. LEM and LNC\n\n\nThe law of excluded middle, LEM, is another of Aristotle's first\nprinciples, if perhaps not as first a principle as LNC. Just\nas Heraclitus's anti-LNC position, \u201cthat everything is and is\nnot, seems to make everything true\u201d, so too Anaxagoras's\nanti-LEM stance, \u201cthat an intermediate exists between two\ncontradictories, makes everything false\u201d (Metaphysics\n1012a25\u201329). Of any two contradictories p and \u00acp, LNC entails\nthat at most one be true while LEM entails that at least one be\ntrue. A logic validates LEM if p v \u00acp is a theorem in that\nlogic. LEM thus imposes a constraint on logical syntax and is distinct\nfrom the Principle of Bivalence, the purely semantic property\ndictating that any given proposition is either true or false. The\nlatter principle is rejected in some multivalued and supervaluationist\nlogics that validate LEM,\na point to which we return in \u00a76 (see also \n many-valued logics,\n Sorites Paradox,\n truth values). Despite the logical\ndistinction between these two principles, in practice they are often conflated.\n\n\nFor Aristotle, the status of LEM and bivalence comes down to the problem of future contingents. In a passage that has launched a thousand treatises,\nAristotle (De Interpretatione, Chapter 9) addresses the\ndifficulties posed by apparently contradictory contingent statements\nabout future events, e.g. (2a,b).\n\n(2a) There will be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n(2b) There will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n\n\nClearly, (2a) and (2b) cannot both be true; LNC applies to future\ncontingents as straightforwardly as to any other pair of\ncontradictories. But what of LEM? Here is where the difficulties\nbegin, culminating in the passage with which Aristotle concludes and\n(apparently) summarizes his account:\n It is necessary for there to be or not to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow; but it not necessary for a sea-battle to take place\ntomorrow, nor for one not to take place\u2014though it is necessary\nfor one to take place or not to take place. So, since statements are\ntrue according to how the actual things are, it is clear that wherever\nthese are such as to allow of contraries as chance has it, the same\nnecessarily holds for the contradictories also. This happens with\nthings that are not always so or are not always not so. With these it\nis necessary for one or the other of the contradictories to be true or\nfalse\u2014not, however, this one or that one, but as chance has it;\nor for one to be true rather than the other, yet not\nalready true or false.  Clearly, then it is not necessary\nthat of every affirmation and opposite negation one should be true and\nthe other false. For what holds for things that are does not hold for\nthings that are not but may possibly be or not be; with these it is as\nwe have said. (De Interpretatione 19a30-b4)\n\n\nUnfortunately, given the systematic ambiguity and textual variations\nin the Greek text, the difficulty of telling when Aristotle is\nspeaking with his own voice or characterizing an opponent's argument,\nand the lack of formal devices for the essential scopal distinctions\nat issue, it has never been clear exactly just what has been said here\nand in the chapter more generally. Some, including Boethius and\nLukasiewicz, have seen in this text an argument for rejecting LEM for\nfuture contingent statements, which are therefore to be assigned a\nnon-classical value (e.g. \u201cIndeterminate\u201d) or no\ntruth-value at\n all.[4]\n Their reasoning is based in part on the premise that the alternative\nposition seems to require the acceptance of determinism. Others,\nhowever, read Aristotle as rejecting not simple bivalence for future\ncontingents but rather determinacy itself.  This interpretive\ntradition, endorsed by al-F\u0101r\u0101bi, Saint Thomas, and\nOckham, is crystallized in this passage from Abelard's\nDialectica (210\u201322) cited by Kneale and Kneale (1962:\n214):\n\nNo proposition de contingenti futuro can be determinately\ntrue or determinately false\u2026, but this is not to say that\nno such proposition can be true or false. On the contrary, any such\nproposition is true if the outcome is to be true as it states, even\nthough this is unknown to us.\n\n\nEven if we accept the view that Aristotle is uncomfortable with\nassigning truth (or falsity) to (2a) and (2b), their disjunction\nin (3a) is clearly seen as true, and indeed as necessarily true.\nBut the modal operator must be taken to apply to the disjunction as a\nwhole as in (3b) and not to each disjunct as in (3c).\n\n(3a) Either there will be or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n\n(3b) \u25a1 (\u03a6\n \u2228\n \u00ac\u03a6)\n\n(3c) \u25a1 \u03a6\n \u2228\n \u25a1 \u00ac\u03a6\n\n\n\nFor Aristotle, LNC is understood primarily not as the principle that\nno proposition can be true simultaneously with its negation, but as a\nprima facie rejection of the possibility that any predicate\nF could both hold and not hold of a given subject (at the\nsame time, and in the same respect). A full rendering of the version\nof LNC appearing at Metaphysics\n1006b33\u201334\u2014\u201cIt is not possible to truly say at the\nsame time of a thing that it is a man and that it is not a\nman\u201d\u2014would require a representation involving operators\nfor modality and truth and allowing quantification over\n times.[5]\n In the same way, LEM is not actually the principle that every\nstatement is either true or has a true negation, but the law that for\nany predicate F and any entity x, x either\nis F or isn't F. \n\n\nBut these conceptualizations of LNC and LEM must be generalized, since\nthe principle that it is impossible for a to be F and not to\nbe F will not apply to statements of arbitrary complexity. We\ncan translate the Aristotelian language, with some loss of\nfaithfulness, into the standard modern propositional versions in (4) and (5) \nrespectively, ignoring the understood modal and temporal\nmodifications:\n\n(4) LNC: \u00ac(\u03a6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03a6) \n(5) LEM: \u03a6\n \u2228\n \u00ac\u03a6\n\n Taking LNC and LEM together, we obtain the result that exactly one\nproposition of the pair {\u03a6, \u00ac\u03a6} holds, where \u00ac\nrepresents contradictory negation. \n3. Contradictory Negation in Term and Propositional Logic\n\n\nNot every natural language negation is a contradictory operator, or\neven a logical operator. A statement may be rejected as false, as\nunwarranted, or as inappropriate\u2014misleading, badly pronounced,\nwrongly focused, likely to induce unwanted implicatures or\npresuppositions, overly or insufficiently formal in register. Only in\nthe first of these cases, as a toggle between truth and falsity, is it\nclear that contradictory negation is involved (Horn 1989, Smiley\n1993). Sainsbury (2004) takes truth-functional contradictory negation\nto be a special case of a generalized option negation as a\ndeselection operator: If there are two mutually exhaustive and\nexclusive options A and B, to select A is to deselect B. But the\nrelevant options may involve not truth, but some other aspect of\nutterance form or meaning as in the standard examples\nof metalinguistic negation (Horn 1989; see the entry on\n negation). In such cases, a speaker\nuses negation metalinguistically or echoically to object to a previous\nutterance on any grounds whatsoever, including its phonetic or\ngrammatical form, register, or associated presuppositions or\nimplicatures: \u201cThat's not a car, it's a Volkswagen\u201d,\n\u201cCancer selection is not a but the major force in the emergence\nof complex animal life\u201d, \u201cHe's not your old man, he's your\nfather\u201d, \u201cWe didn't call the POlice, we called the\npoLICE\u201d. In such cases, the relevant target for deselection is\nwhat the right thing is to say in a particular context, where\n\u201ctruth is not sufficient for being right, and may not even be\nnecessary\u201d (Sainsbury 2004: 87). Thus the apparent LNC violation\n(if it's a Volkswagen, it both is and isn't a car) is not a real\none.  \n\n\nGiven that not every apparent sentential negation is contradictory, is\nevery contradictory negation sentential? Within propositional logic,\ncontradictory negation is a self-annihilating operator:\n\u00ac(\u00ac\u03a6) is equivalent to \u03a6. This is explicitly\nrecognized in the proto-Fregean Stoic logic of Alexander of\nAphrodisias: \u201c\u2018Not: not: it is day\u2019 differs from\n\u2018it is day\u2019 only in manner of speech\u201d (Mates 1953:\n126). The Stoics' apophatikon directly prefigures the\niterating and self-cancelling propositional negation of Frege and\nRussell. As Frege puts it (1919: 130), \u201cWrapping up a thought in\ndouble negation does not alter its truth value.\u201d The\ncorresponding linguistic principle is expressed in the grammarians'\nbromide, \u201cDuplex negatio affirmat.\u201d\n\n\nNot all systems of propositional logic accept a biconditional law of\ndouble negation (LDN), \u00ac(\u00ac\u03a6) \u2261 \u03a6. In particular,\nLDN, along with LEM, is not valid for the Intuitionists, who reject\n\u00ac(\u00ac\u03a6) \u2192 \u03a6 while accepting its converse, \u03a6\n\u2192 \u00ac(\u00ac\u03a6). But the very possibility of applying\nnegation to a negated statement presupposes the analysis of\ncontradictory negation as an iterative operator (one capable of\napplying to its own output), or as a function whose range is\nidentical to (or a subset of) its domain. Within the categorical term-based logic of\nAristotle and his Peripatetic successors, every\nstatement\u2014whether singular or general\u2014is of\nsubject-predicate form. Contradictory negation is not a one-place\noperator taking propositions into propositions, but rather a mode\nof predication, a way of combining subjects with predicates: a\ngiven predicate can be either affirmed or denied of a given\nsubject. Unlike the apophatikon or propositional negation\nconnective introduced by the Stoics and formalized in Fregean and\nRussellian logic, Aristotelian predicate denial, while toggling truth\nand falsity and yielding the semantics of contradictory opposition,\ndoes not apply to its own output and hence does not syntactically\niterate. In this respect, predicate denial both anticipates the form\nof negation in Montague Grammar (see the entry on\n Montague semantics) and provides a more plausible\nrepresentation of contradictory negation in natural language, whether\nAncient Greek or English, where reflexes of the iterating one-place\nconnective of the Stoics and Fregeans (\u201cNot: not: the sun is\nshining\u201d) are hard to find outside of artificial constructs like\nthe \u201cit is not the case\u201d construction (Horn 1989,\n\u00a77.2). In a given natural language, contradictory negation may be\nexpressed as a particle associated with a copula or a verb, as an\ninflected auxiliary verb, as a verb of negation, or as a negative\nsuffix or prefix. \n\n\nIn addition, there is a widespread pragmatically motivated tendency\nfor a formal contradictory negation to be strengthened to a semantic\nor virtual contrary through such processes as litotes (\u201cI don't\nlike prunes\u201d conveying that I dislike prunes) and so-called\nneg(ative) raising (\u201cI don't think that \u03a6\u201d conveying\n\u201cI think that \u00ac\u03a6\u201d). Similarly, the prefixal\nnegation in such adjectives as \u201cunhappy\u201d or\n\u201cunfair\u201d is understood as a contrary rather than\ncontradictory (not-Adj) of its base. These phenomena have been much\ndiscussed by rhetoricians, logicians, and linguists (see the\nentry on negation and Horn 1989: Chap. 5).\n\n\nIn addition to predicate denial, in which a predicate F is\ndenied of a subject a, Aristotelian logic allows for\nnarrow-scope predicate term negation, in which a negative\npredicate not-F is affirmed of a. The relations of\npredicate denial and predicate term negation to a simple affirmative\nproposition (and to each other) can be schematized on a generalized\nsquare of opposition for singular (non-quantified) expressions (De\nInterpretatione 19b19\u201330, Prior Analytics Chapter\n46):\n(6) Negation Square\n\n\n\nIf Socrates doesn't exist, \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d (A)\nand its contrary \u201cSocrates is not-wise\u201d (E) are\nboth automatically false (since nothing\u2014positive or\nnegative\u2014can be truly affirmed of a non-existent subject), while\ntheir respective contradictories \u201cSocrates is not wise\u201d\n(O) and \u201cSocrates is not not-wise\u201d (I)\nare both true. Similarly, for any object x, either x\nis red or x is not red\u2014but x may be neither\nred nor not-red; if, for instance, x is a unicorn or a prime\nnumber.\n\n\nWhile Russell (1905) echoed (without acknowledgment) Aristotle's\nambiguist analysis of negation as either contradictory\n(\u201cexternal\u201d) or contrary (\u201cinternal\u201d), by\nvirtue of the two logical forms assigned to \u201cThe king of France\nis not bald\u201d (see descriptions),\nsuch propositionalized accounts are bought at a cost of naturalness,\nas singular sentences of subject-predicate grammatical form are\nassigned the logical form of an existentially quantified conjunction\nand as names are transmuted into predicates. \n\n\nThe difference between denying P of S and\naffirming not-P of S is realized in Ancient Greek as\na scopal distinction reflected in word order: S P [not is]\n(Socrates healthy not-is) vs. S [not P] is (Socrates\nnot-healthy is). As indicated in (6), for Aristotle only\nsentences can be in contradictory opposition. P\nand not-P both yield falsity when predicated of a\nnon-existent subject but one or the other of the two terms is\ntruthfully predicable of any existent subject in the relevant\ndomain. P and not-P are \u201clogical\ncontraries\u201d that exclude a true middle, an existent entity which\nis neither P nor not-P. But naturally occurring\ncases of prefixal adjectives, those marked by a(n)- in\nGreek, may involve an unexcluded middle, as do polar contraries or\nantonym pairs.  Modern grammatical discourse departs from Aristotle in\nallowing for contradictory terms: middle-allowing contrary adjectives\n(white/black,\nhappy/unhappy) are distinguished from middle-excluding contradictory adjectives\n(transitive/intransitive, alive/dead). \n\n\nJespersen (1917: 144) describes the logical status of negatively\nprefixed adjectives in English:\n\n\nThe modification in sense brought about by the addition of the\nprefix [un-] is generally that of a simple negative:\nunworthy = \u2018not worthy\u2019, etc. The two terms\n[P, unP] are thus contradictory terms. But very often the prefix\nproduces a \u201ccontrary\u201d term\u2026: unjust (and\ninjustice) generally imply the opposite of just (justice);\nunwise means more than not wise and approaches\nfoolish, unhappy is not far from miserable, etc.\n\n\n\nLike Aristotle, Jespersen predicts that the negation of true\ncontraries like unhappy, unjust, or unwise will be\nsemantically distinct from their positive bases. Thus, not\nunhappy fails to reduce to happy by virtue of allowing an\nunexcluded middle: one can be neither happy nor unhappy but just blaah,\nin the same way that something can be neither black nor white but one\nof the fifty-plus shades of gray. At the same time, even those\nadjectives that are semantic contradictories, e.g. impossible,\nmay be coerced under negation into virtual contraries. While\ntechnically any action or event must be either possible or impossible,\nto assess something as not impossible is often to portray its\noccurrence as a more remote possibility than to assess it as\npossible simpliciter, as reflected in attestations of\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, or at least not impossible\u201d. Similar\ninstances of virtual contrariety are readily attested with negated verb\nphrases (\u201cI don\u2019t NOT love the dog\u201d \u2260 I love the\ndog) or predicate nominals (\u201cWe\u2019re not NOT friends\u201d\n\u2260 We\u2019re friends); see Horn 2017.\n\n\nDrawing on an epistemic theory of vagueness, Krifka (2007) argues\nthat prefixal negation always yields semantic contradictories. On this view,\nunhappy is literally just \u2018not happy\u2019, with the\ncharacteristic stronger understanding derived pragmatically. The\nincomplete cancellation of the two negators in not unhappy is\ntaken to be a purely pragmatic phenomenon, conflating this case with\nthat of not impossible. But the classical theory has its\nadvantages. On that approach, un-Adj antonyms (like their\nmorphologically simplex classmates, sad or bad) are\nlexical items that can constitute contraries vis-\u00e0-vis the\ncorresponding positive. By virtue of their lexical status, they are\ncandidates to undergo further semantic drift, unlike not Adj\nsequences (or non-Adj forms), as evidenced in the semantic\nand phonological opacity of infamous or\nimpious. Note too that many un- and in-\nadjectives (unkempt, inchoate, incorrigible) lack\ncorresponding simple bases. Furthermore, the prefix non-\nyields staunch contradictories (typically with objective and/or\ntechnical senses) often contrasting minimally with un-Adj or\niN-Adj contraries favoring gradable and evaluative\ncontexts:\n\nnon-American vs. un-American; non-professional vs.\n unprofessional\nnon-Christian vs. un-Christian; \nnon-rational vs. irrational\nnon-moral vs. immoral; \nnon-realistic vs. unrealistic\nnon-natural vs. unnatural; \nnon-scientific vs. unscientific\n\n\n\nEven more problematically for a unified treatment, the treatment of\nall negatively prefixed adjectives as semantic contradictories would\nseem naturally to extend from unhappy or unwise to\nsimplex antonymic pairs like happy/sad or\nwise/foolish, where the evidence for semantic\ncontrariety appears to be incontrovertible. While Krifka (2007: 174)\nsupports the analysis of e.g. happy and unhappy as\n\u201cliterally contradictories that receive their interpretations as\ncontraries only via pragmatic strengthening\u201d, Horn (2017) argues\nthat a traditional (neo-Aristotelian) approach invoking parallel but distinct semantic\nand pragmatic strengthening processes is on sounder empirical\nfooting.\n4. Gaps and Gluts: LNC and Its Discontents\n\n\nIn addition to the future contingent statements discussed in \u00a72,\nvacuous subjects like those in (7a,b) have sometimes been taken to\nyield a violation of LEM through the emergence of a truth-value\ngap.\n\n(7a) {The present king of France/King Louis} is bald.\n(7b) {The present king of France/King Louis} isn't bald.\n\n\n\nWhile Aristotle would see a republican France as rendering (7a) false\nand (7b) automatically true, Frege (1892) and Strawson (1950) reject\nthe notion that either of these sentences can be used to make a true\nor false assertion. Instead, both statements presuppose the existence\nof a referent for the singular term; if the presupposition fails, so\ndoes the possibility of classical truth assignment. Note, however,\nthat such analyses present a challenge to LEM only if (7b) is taken as\nthe true contradictory of (7a), an assumption not universally\nshared. Russell, for example, allows for one reading of (7b) on which\nit is, like (7a), false in the absence of a referent or denotatum for\nthe subject term; on that reading, on which the description has\nprimary occurrence, the two sentences are not contradictories. In this\nway, Russell (1905: 485) seeks to guide the French monarch out of the\napparent trap without recourse to wigs or truth value gaps: \n\nBy the law of the excluded middle, either \u2018A is B\u2019 or\n\u2018A is not B\u2019 must be true. Hence either \u2018the present\nking of France is bald\u2019 or \u2018the present king of France is\nnot bald\u2019 must be true. Yet if we enumerated the things that are\nbald and the things that are not bald, we should not find the king of\nFrance on either list. Hegelians, who love a synthesis, will probably\nconclude that he wears a wig.\n\n\nIn those systems that do embrace truth value gaps (Strawson, arguably\nFrege) or non-classically-valued systems (\u0141ukasiewicz, Bochvar,\nKleene), some sentences or statements are not assigned a (classical)\ntruth value; in Strawson's famous dictum, the question of the truth\nvalue of \u201cThe king of France is wise\u201d, in a world in which\nFrance is a republic, simply fails to arise. The negative form of such\nvacuous statements, e.g. \u201cThe king of France is not wise\u201d,\nis similarly neither true nor false.  This amounts to a rejection of\nLEM, as noted by Russell 1905. In addition to vacuous singular\nexpressions, gap-based analyses have been proposed for future\ncontingents (following one reading of Aristotle's exposition of the\nsea-battle; cf.  \u00a72 above) and category mistakes (e.g. \u201cThe\nnumber 7 likes/doesn't like to dance\u201d).\n\n\nWhile LNC has traditionally remained more sacrosanct, reflecting its\nposition as the primus inter pares of the indemonstrables,\ntransgressing this final taboo has become increasingly alluring in\nrecent years. The move here involves embracing not gaps but truth\nvalue gluts, cases in which a given sentence and its negation\nare taken to be both true, or alternatively cases in which a sentence\nmay be assigned more than one (classical) truth value, i.e.  both True\nand False. Parsons (1990) observes that the two non-classical theories\nare provably logically equivalent, as gluts arise within one class of\ntheories precisely where gaps do in the other; others, however, have\nargued that gaps (as in Intuitionist non-bivalent logics) are easier\nto swallow than gluts (see papers in the Priest et al. 2004 collection\nfor further debate). Dialetheists reject the charge of incoherence by\nnoting that to accept some contradictions is not to accept them all;\nin particular, they seek to defuse the threat of logical armageddon or\n\u201cexplosion\u201d posed by Ex Contradictione Quodlibet, the\ninference in (8):\n\n\n(8) p, \u00acp\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_____\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2234q\n\n\n\nFar from reduced to the silence of a vegetable, as Aristotle ordained,\nthe proponents of true contradictions, including self-avowed\ndialetheists following the lead of Sylvan (n\u00e9 Routley) and\nPriest have been eloquent.\n\n\nIs the status of Aristotle's \u201cfirst principle\u201d as obvious\nas he believed? Adherents of the dialetheist view that there are true\ncontradictories (Priest 1987, 1998, 2002; see also the entries  on\n dialetheism and\n paraconsistent logic) would\n answer firmly in the \n negative.[6]\n In the Western tradition, the countenancing\nof true contradictions is typically\u2014although not\nexclusively\u2014motivated on the basis of such classic logical\nparadoxes as \u201cThis sentence is not true\u201d and its\nanalogues; such a statement is evidently true if and only if it is\nnot true. The Liar, or really the family of Liar\u2019s paradoxes\n(see Liar Paradox), and Russell\u2019s\nparadox, its set-theoretic analogue (a set that is not a member of\nitself both is and is not a member of\nitself\u2014see the entry on \n Russell\u2019s Paradox), would\nno longer constitute immediate threats to logical coherence in the\nabsence of LNC (see papers in Priest et al. for extended discussion).\nIf we are indeed prepared to jettison LNC, we can regard \u201cThis\nsentence is not true\u201d (or \u201cThis statement is false\u201d)\nas simultaneously true and not true without deriving the resultant\nabsurdity taken by Aristotle and his heirs to result from such a\ncontradiction. As Smiley (1993: 19) has remarked, \u201cDialetheism\nstands to the classical idea of negation like special relativity to\nNewtonian mechanics: they agree in the familiar areas but diverge at\nthe margins (notably the paradoxes).\u201d\n\n\nRelated to the classic paradoxes of logic and set theory is the\nParadox of the Stone. One begins by granting the basic dilemma, as an\nevident instance of LEM: either God is omnipotent or God is not\nomnipotent. With omnipotence, He can do anything, and in particular He\ncan create a stone, call it s, that is so heavy even He\ncannot lift it. But then there is something He cannot do, viz. (ex\nhypothesi) lift s. But this is a violation of LNC: God can\nlift s and God cannot lift s.  This paradox, and the\npotential challenge it offers to either LNC or the possibility of\nomnipotence, has been recognized since Aquinas, who opted for\nretaining the Aristotelian law by understanding omnipotence as the\ncapacity to do only what is not logically impossible.  (Others,\nincluding Augustine and Maimonides, have noted that in any case God is\n\u201cunable\u201d to do what is inconsistent with His nature,\ne.g. commit sin.) For Descartes, on the other hand, an omnipotent God\nis by definition capable of any task, even those yielding\ncontradictions. Mavrodes (1963), Kenny, and others have sided with\nSt. Thomas in taking omnipotence to extend only to those powers it is\npossible to possess; Frankfurt (1964), on the other hand, essentially\nadopts the Cartesian line: Yes, of course God can indeed construct a\nstone such that He cannot lift it\u2014and what's more, He can lift\nit! (See also Savage 1967 for a related solution.)\n\nAs we have seen, the target of Aristotle's psychological (doxastic)\nversion of LNC was Heraclitus: \u201cIt is impossible for anyone to\nbelieve that the same thing is and is not, as some consider Heraclitus\nsaid\u2014for it is not necessary that the things one says one also\nbelieves\u201d (Met. 1005b23\u201326). But as Aristotle acknowledges here\n(even if he is less politic elsewhere), there is considerable uncertainty\nover exactly what Heraclitus said and what he believed. Heraclitus\ncould not have literally rejected LNC, as he is often accused of (or\npraised for) doing, as his writings preceded the statement of that\nprinciple in Metaphysics \u0393 by well over a century. But\nthe question remains: do his words, as represented in the extant\nfragments, anticipate the Dialetheists and other rejectionists? Yes\nand no. To be sure, Heraclitus was proud to wear the mantle of\n\u201cparadoxographer\u201d (Barnes 1982: 80) and enjoyed nothing\nmore than to \u00e9pater les bourgeois of his day. But the\nkey fragments supporting his proclamation of the Unity of Opposites\ncan be taken in more than one way.  He points out that sea water is\nsalutary (if you're a fish) and unhealthy (if you're a human), just as\ngarbage is preferable to gold (for a donkey) but then again it isn't\n(for a person). And given the inevitability of flux (as Heraclitus\nmemorably illustrated by his river into which one cannot step twice),\nwhat is true (today) is also false (tomorrow).  But these astute\nobservations do not so much refute the LNC as much as demonstrate\n(through what Barnes calls the Fallacy of the Dropped Qualification)\nthe need for Aristotle's crucial codicil: sea water, for example,\ncannot be both healthful and unhealthful for the same experiencer at\nthe same time and in the same respect. (In a similar way, \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d may of course be deemed true at this moment in Seattle\nand false in Palo Alto; we need admit no contradiction here, whether\nwe deal with the issue by endorsing unarticulated constituents or in\nsome other manner; cf. Recanati 2002 inter alia.)  Ultimately, whether\none follows Kirk (Heraclitus [1954]) in charging Aristotle with\nmisrepresenting Heraclitus as an LNC-denier or sides with Barnes\n(1982) and Wedin (2004b) in sustaining Aristotle's accusation, it is\nhard to see in what respect the evidence presented by Heraclitus,\nhowever subtle a guide he may be for our travels on that path on which\nup and down is one and the same, threatens the viability of LNC. (See\nalso Heraclitus.)\n\n\nWithin the modern philosophical canon, Hegel has often been seen as\nthe echt LNC-skeptic, well before his reputed deathbed lament,\n\u201cOnly one man ever understood me, and he didn't understand\nme.\u201d Hegel saw himself as picking up where Heraclitus left\noff\u2014\u201cThere is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have\nnot adopted in my logic\u201d (Barnes 1982: 57)\u2014and indeed the\nHeraclitean view of a world shaped by the unity of opposites through\nstrife and resolution does seem to foreshadow Hegelian dialectic. In\nfact, however, an unresolved contradiction was a sign of error for\nHegel. The contradiction between thesis and antithesis results in the\ndialectical resolution or superseding of the contradiction between\nopposites as a higher-level synthesis through the process\nof Aufhebung (from aufheben, a verb simultaneously\ninterpretable as 'preserve, cancel, lift up'). Rather than repudiating\nLNC, Hegel's dialectic rests upon it. In Marxist theory, too,\ncontradictories do not simply cancel out but are dynamically resolved\n(aufgehoben) at a higher level in a way that both preserves\nand supersedes the contradiction, motivating the historical\ndialectic. (See Horn 1989: \u00a71.3.2.)\n\n\nFor Freud, there is a realm in which LNC is not so much superseded but\ndissolved. On the primary, infantile level, reflected in dreams and\nneuroses, there is no not: \u201c\u2018No\u2019 seems not\nto exist as far as dreams are concerned. Anything in a dream can mean\nits contrary\u201d (Freud 1910: 155). When the analysand insists of a\ndream character \u201cIt's not my mother\u201d, the analyst\nknowingly translates, \u201cSo it is his mother!\u201d\nFreud sought to ground this pre-logical, LNC-free (and negation-free)\nrealm not just in the primal realm of the dreamer's unconscious but\nalso in the phenomenon of Gegensinn, words\n(especially Urworte, primal words) with two opposed meanings\npurported attested widely in ancient and modern languages. The\nempirical basis for this latter claim, however, has been widely\ndiscredited; see Benveniste 1956.\n\n\nGiven Aristotle's observation (Metaphysics 1006a2) that\n\u201ceven some physicists\u201d deny LNC and affirm that it is\nindeed possible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same\ntime and in the same respect, he might not have been surprised to\nlearn that quantum mechanics has brought such challenges once more\ninto play. Thus, we have Schr\u00f6dinger's celebrated imaginary cat,\nplaced (within the context of a thought experiment) inside a sealed\nbox along with radioactive material and a vial of poison gas that will\nbe released if and only if that material decays. Given quantum\nuncertainty, an atom potentially inhabits both states\u2014decayed\nand non-\u2014simultaneously, seeming to render the cat (in the\nabsence of an observer outside the system) both alive and dead. But\nmost physicists would argue that while quantum mechanics may challenge\nsome aspects of classical logic it does not threaten LNC. If we could\nin fact observe a cat, or a particle, as A and not-A at the same time,\nthen there would be a violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction; the\nmere potential for an entity to be in either of two mutually\ninconsistent states does not in itself violate the LNC.\u00a0 \n\n\nAs we have seen, Aristotle himself anticipated many of the challenges\nthat have since been raised against LNC. One more such challenge is\nposed by the ubiquity of doxastic inconsistency. Take the desires of\nOedipus, for example. In seeking Jocasta as his mate, did he wish to\nmarry his mother? Certainly he did on the de re reading: Oedipus's\nmother (Jocasta) is such that he wanted to marry her, although he\nwould not have assented to the claim that he wanted to marry his\nmother. In a sense, then, \u201cOedipus wanted to marry his\nmother\u201d is true (de re) and false (de dicto), but no violation\nof LNC is incurred, since these represent different propositions, the\nsemantic distinction neutralized within the sentential form. But what\nof the de dicto reading itself: it is really false? After\nall, as a young boy Oedipus can be assumed (by some) to have exhibited\nthe eponymous complex, according to which the falsity of the (de\ndicto) proposition that he wanted to marry his mother on\na conscious level belies the truth of this proposition on\nan unconscious level. But this does not entail that he both\nwished and did not wish to \u201cmarry\u201d his mother at the same\ntime and in the same respect. Whether it concerns the\nunacknowledged incestuous conflict of the Theban king, the indecision\nof Zerlina's \u201cVorrei e non vorrei\u201d response to Don\nGiovanni's invitation, or the unspecified ambivalence of the\nrespondent in Strawson's exchange (1952: 7)\n\n\u2014Were you pleased?\n\n\u2014Well, I was and I wasn't.\n\n\nwe have ample opportunity to reflect\non the foresight of Aristotle's rider: \u201ca is\nF\u201d and \u201ca is not F\u201d\ncannot both hold in the same sense, at the same time, and in the\nsame respect. \n5. LNC and the Buddhist Tetralemma\n\n\nBeyond the Western canon, the brunt of the battle over LNC has been\nlargely borne by the Buddhists, particularly in the exposition by\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna of the catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di or tetralemma (c. 200\nA.D.; cf. Bochenski 1961: Part VI, Raju 1954, Garfield 1995, Tillemans\n1999, Garfield & Priest 2002), also known as the four-cornered or\nfourfold negation. Consider the following four possible truth\noutcomes for any statement and its (apparent) contradictory:\n\n\n\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\nS is P\n\n\n(ii)\nS is not P\n\n\n(iii)\nS is both P and not-P\n\n\n(iv)\nS is neither P nor not-P\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instances of the positive tetralemma, on N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\naccount, all four statement types can or must be accepted:\n\n Everything is real and not real.\n Both real and not real.\n Neither real nor not real.\n That is Lord Buddha's teaching.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014M\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101\n18:8, quoted in Garfield (1995: 102)\n \n\n\nSuch cases arise only when we are beyond the realm to which ordinary\nlogic applies, when \u201cthe sphere of thought has ceased.\u201d On\nthe other hand, more use is made of the negative tetralemma, in which\nall four of the statements in (9) can or must be rejected, and thus\none cannot assert either \u03a6, \u00ac\u03a6, both \u03a6 and \u00ac\u03a6, or\nneither \u03a6 nor \u00ac\u03a6. Is this tantamount, as it appears, to the\nrenunciation of LEM and LNC, the countenancing of both gaps and gluts,\nand thus\u2014in Aristotle's view\u2014the overthrow of all bounds\nof rational argument?\n\n\nIt should first be noted that the axiomatic status of LNC and LEM is\nas well-established within the logical traditions of India as it is\nfor the Greeks and their\n epigones.[7]\n Garfield (1995) and Tillemans (1999) convincingly refute\nthe claim that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was simply an  \n\u201cirrationalist\u201d.[8]\n In the first place, if N\u0101g\u0101rjuna simply rejected LNC, there\nwould be no possibility of reductio arguments, which hinge on\nthe establishment of untenable contradictions, yet such arguments are\nstandardly employed in his logic. In fact, he explicitly\nprohibits virodha (contradiction). Crucially, it is only in\nthe realm of the Absolute or Transcendent, where we are contemplating\nthe nature of the ultimate, that contradictions are embraced; in the\nrealm of ordinary reality, LNC operates and classical logic\nholds. (Recall Freud's dichotomy between the LNC-observant conscious\nmind and the LNC-free unconscious.)  In this sense, the logic of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna and of the Buddhist tradition more generally can\nbe seen not as inconsistent but paraconsistent. Indeed, just as\nAristotle ridiculed LNC-skeptical sophists as no better than\nvegetables (see \u00a71), the Buddhists dismissed the arch-skeptic\nSanjaya and his followers, who refused to commit themselves to a\ndefinite position on any issue, as\n\u201ceel-wrigglers\u201d (amar\u0101vikkhepa). Sanjaya\nhimself was notorious for his periodic lapses into the extended\nsilence Aristotle described as the last refuge of the LNC-skeptic (see\nRaju 1954).  \n\n\nOne aspect of the apparent paradox is precisely parallel to that\narising with some of the potential counterexamples to the LNC arising\nin Western thought. In various Buddhist and Jainist systems of\nthought, the apparent endorsement of Fa &\n\u00acFa (or, in propositional terms, \u03a6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03a6)\nis upon closer examination qualified in precisely the way foreseen by\nthe codicils in Aristotle's statement of the law: From a certain\nviewpoint, \u03a6 (e.g. Nirvana exists); from a certain viewpoint,\n\u00ac\u03a6 (e.g. Nirvana does not exist). (Compare the observation of\nJainists two millennia ago that \u201cS is P\u201d\nand \u201cS is not\nP\u201d can both be true from different standpoints; cf. Raju\n1954: 698\u2013701; Balcerowicz 2003.)\n\n\nTo further explore the status of truth-value gluts, in which both\nclassical values are simultaneously assigned to a given proposition\n(e.g. \u201cx is real\u201d), let us consider the analogous\ncases involving gaps. Recall, for example, the case of future\ncontingents as in (2a,b) above: we need not maintain that \u201cIraq\nwill become a secular democracy\u201d is neither true nor false when\nuttered today, but only that neither this statement nor its\ncontradictory \u201cIraq will not become a secular democracy\u201d is\nassertable today in the absence of foreknowledge. Similarly\nfor past unknowables, such as (to adapt an example from Quine) the\nproposition that the number of blades of grass on the Old Campus lawn\nduring the 2005 Yale commencement exercises was odd. This is again\nmore plausibly viewed as unassertable than as truth-valueless, even\nthough its truth-value will never be known. To take a third example,\nwe can argue, with Grice (1989: 80ff.), that a negation outside the\nscope of a conditional is generally intended as a refusal (or\nhesitation) to assert \u201cif p then q\u201d\nrather than as the contradictory negation of a conditional, whose\ntruth value is determined in accord with the standard material\nequivalence:\n\n(10) \u00ac(p\u2192q) \u2261 (p &\n\u00acq)\n\n\nThus, in denying your conditional \u201cIf you give her penicillin,\nshe will get better\u201d, I am allowing for the possibility that\ngiving her penicillin might have no effect on her, but I am not\npredicting that you will administer the penicillin and she will fail\nto recover. Nor does denying the apothegm (typically though\ninaccurately attributed to Dostoyevsky or Nietzsche) that if God is\ndead everything is permitted commit one to the conjoined proposition\nthat God is dead and something is forbidden. As Dummett (1973: 328\u201330)\nputs the point, we must distinguish negation outside the scope of a\nFregean assertion operator, not\n (\u22a2p),\n from the assertion of a negative proposition,\n \u22a2(not p).\n The former interpretation \u201cmight be taken to be a means of\nexpressing an unwillingness to assert\u201d p, in particular\nwhen p is a conditional:\n\n\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X:\nIf it rains, the match will be canceled.\n\n\nY:\nThat's not so. (or, I don't think that's the case.)\n\n\n\n\nY's contribution here does not constitute a negation of\nX's content; rather, we can paraphrase Y as\nconveying (11\u2032a) or (11\u2032b):\n\n(11\u2032a) If it rains, the match won't necessarily be canceled.\n\n(11\u2032b) It may [epistemic] happen that it rains and yet\nthe match is not canceled.\n\n\nDummett observes, \u201cWe have no negation of the conditional of\nnatural language, that is, no negation of its sense: we have only a\nform for expressing refusal to assent to its assertion.\u201d\n\n\nSimilarly with disjunction. Consider the exchange in (12) preceding\nthe 2000 election, updated from an example of Grice:\n\n\n\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X:\nBush or Gore will be elected.\n\n\nY:\nThat's not so: Bush or Gore or Nader will be elected.\n\n\n\n\nY's rejoinder cannot be a contradictory of the content of\nX's claim, since the (de jure) election of Bush rendered both\nX's and Y's statements true. Rather, Y\nobjects on the grounds that X is not in an epistemic position\nto assert the binary disjunction.\n\n\nUnassertability can be read as the key to the apparent paradox of the\ncatu\u1e63ko\u1e6di as well. The venerable text in\nMajjhima-nik\u0101ya 72, relating the teachings of the\nhistorical Buddha, offers a precursor for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\ndoctrine of the negative tetralemma. Gotama is responding to a monk's\nquestion concerning the doctrine of rebirth (quoted in Robinson 1967:\n54):\n\n Gotama, where is the monk reborn whose mind is thus freed?\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is\n reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is not\n reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is both reborn and not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is both\n reborn and not reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is neither reborn nor not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is neither\n reborn nor not reborn.\n\n\n\nNote the form of the translation here, or similarly that of the\nstandard rendering of the negative catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di that \u201cit\nprofits not\u201d to assert \u03a6, to assert \u00ac\u03a6, to assert\nboth \u03a6 and \u00ac\u03a6, or to assert neither \u03a6 nor \u00ac\u03a6:\nthe relevant negation can be taken to operate over an implicit modal,\nin particular an epistemic or assertability operator. If so, neither\nLEM nor LNC is directly at stake in the tetralemma: you can have your\nAristotle and Buddha too.\n\n\nWe tend to recalibrate apparent violations of LNC as conforming to a\nversion of the law that incorporates the Aristotelian qualifications:\na sincere defense of \u201cp and not-p\u201d\nplausibly involves a change in the context of evaluation or a shift in\nviewpoint, or alternatively a suppression of modal or epistemic\noperators. This practice can be seen as an instance of a general\nmethodological principle associated with\n Davidson\n and Quine that has come to be called the principle of\ncharity (or, alternately, the principle of rational\naccommodation): when it is unclear how to interpret another's\nargument, interpret it in a way that makes the most sense. At the same\ntime, this procedure evokes the standard Gricean mode of explanation\n (Grice 1989; see the entry on\n   implicature):\ngranted the operation of the Cooperative Principle and, more broadly,\nthe shared premise of rationality, we reinterpret apparent violations of\nvalid principles or maxims so as to conserve the assumption that one's\ninterlocutor is a rational and cooperative agent. And as Aristotle would\nremind us, no principle is more worthy of conservation than the Law of\nNon-Contradiction.\n6. Vagueness and borderline contradictions\n\n\nWe have seen that two of the more significant threats to the\nunchallengeable status of LNC tend to dissolve under closer scrutiny.\nHeraclitus-type contradictions (Sea water is healthy and sea water\nis not healthy) are rendered LNC-compatible by the Aristotelian\nrider designed for that purpose (\u201ca is F\u201d and\n\u201ca is not F\u201d cannot both hold in the same\nsense, at the same time, and in the same respect) once the\n\u201cdropped qualification\u201d or contextual specification is\nrestored (\u00a74). Buddhist-type contradictions (Nirvana exists\nand Nirvana does not exist) can be understood as modalized,\nembedded under an epistemic modal or assertability operator.\n\n\nWe are left with two significant challenges for LNC: (i) the case of\nthe Liar and related paradoxes of self-reference as touched on in\n\u00a73 and work cited therein (see the entries on Liar Paradox,\nRussell\u2019s Paradox, Dialetheism, Paraconsistent Logic) and (ii)\nthe case of vagueness and its implications for borderline truth,\ndiscussed in this section. As we have seen, the admission of\ntruth-value gaps (exceptions to LEM) is mirrored by the admission of\ntruth-value gluts (exceptions to LNC). As intellectual heirs of the\nHegelian tradition, Marxists have willing to accept paradox, and\nindeed the pre-Revolutionary theorist Plekanov (1909) suggests that\nSorites (in the form of the bald man; see sorites entry) can be\nresolved by rejecting LNC. Hyde (1997) traces the history of\nvagueness-based arguments for paraconsistency from Plekhanov through\nJa\u015bkowski, McGill, and Parry in the 1940s to the dialetheist\nlogics of today. Pointing out the parallels between treatments of\nvagueness via truth-value gap theories (including the supervaluation\ntheory of van Fraassen 1969) and their truth-value glut counterparts,\nHyde laments the unwarranted neglect of the latter option: \u201cThe\nthought that an adequate response might require the recognition of\ncases of overdetermination and and truth-value gluts has few\nsupporters\u201d (Hyde 1997: 641). In the two decades since the\npublication of his important paper, that neglect has been largely\nrectified, especially with the accretion of empirical support for\nglut-oriented approaches endorsing the acceptability of a range of\ntrue contradictions of the form a is P and a is not P, in\nparticular when P is a vague predicate like tall, vague,\nor red.\n\nSupervaluation theory utilizes the concept of admissible sharpening or\nprecisification of vague predication (see  the entry on\n vagueness). I may be unable to assert\n truthfully of a given color\nchip in the red-orange range that it is red, while also being unable\nto assert that it is not red. Once the notion of red is sharpened or\nprecisified to a particular interval of wave-lengths, I am in a\nposition to assert either the positive proposition \u201ca is\nred\u201d or its negation \u201ca is not red\u201d, but which one\ndepends on the details of the sharpening. A sentence S is\nsupertrue iff it is true on every sharpening and superfalse if it is\nfalse on every sharpening; if is true on some sharpenings and false on\nothers, it is neither supertrue nor superfalse, thus corresponding to\na truth-value gap. One salutary result of this approach is that LEM\ncan be retained: P or not P is supertrue since it is true on\nevery sharpening. Hyde (1997) draws on the dual status of gaps and\ngluts to define a paraconsistent \u201csubvaluation\u201d theory:\nS is subtrue iff is true on at least one sharpening, subfalse\niff it is false on at least one sharpening, and neither subtrue nor\nsubfalse if it is true on some sharpenings and false on others. Given\nthe status of supervaluation and subvaluation as duals, each is equally\ndefensible and applicable to the semantics of vagueness. \nCrucially, it is the notion of supertruth, or subtruth as the case may\nbe, that tracks our natural language intuitions of truth, and similarly\nfor falsity. In this sense, the logic of supervaluation is\nparacomplete (allowing for violations of LEM) and the logic of\nsubvaluation paraconsistent (allowing for violations of LNC). In the\ntradition of paraconsistent logics, Hyde stresses the need for\n\u201cquarantining the gluts\u201d to avoid the explosive\nconsequences of ex contradictione quodlibet (see \u00a74).\n\n\nWhere supervaluation theory allows a is not\ntall or a is not bald to be neither (super)true nor\n(super)false if a represents a borderline instance of tallness,\nsubvaluation theory would characterize such an assessment as both\n(sub)true and (sub)false. But since tautologies are preserved if\nvalidity is defined in terms of truth and not subtruth (or\nsupertruth)\u2014an assumption that some might challenge\u2014a\nis tall and a is not tall can never be true, even when a is\ntall and a is not tall are both true:\n\nA vague\nsentence \u2018A\u2019 and its negation might both be true\n(since they each have some true disambiguation\u2014i.e. the sentence\n\u2018A\u2019 itself as some true and some false\ndisambiguation\u2014but their conjunction can never be.\n\u2018A & \u00acA\u2019 has only false disambiguations;\nLNC is retained. (Hyde 1997: 654)\n\n\nFor Akiba (1999), however, paraconsistent subvaluation theories,\nlike paracomplete supervaluation theories, should be recast in a modal\nlight, by supplying an epistemic possibility operator Pos in the former\ncase (reminiscent of the modalized accounts of the tetralemma explored in\n\u00a75) and its dual, an abstract modal concept Akiba defines as\nDef (corresponding to necessary truth) in the latter. \nThus, while P & \u00acP remains a full-fledged\ncontradiction, its modalized counterpart Pos(P) &\nPos(\u00acP) is coherent, and while P v \u00acP is a valid\ninstance of LEM, Def(P) v Def(\u00acP) is not:\n\u201cSuper- and subvaluation systems can be considered not really\nalternatives to classical logic but in fact just modal extensions of\nit.\u201d Akiba\u2019s key departure from Hyde\u2019s approach is in\nrejecting the move to identify truth simpliciter with subtruth\n(or supertruth). \n\n\nConfronted with the task of applying semantically vague predicates\nlike tall and red to borderline cases, the intuitions\nof respondents in psycholinguistic studies often tend to become\nuncertain. Subjects produce varying responses for the crucial\ndata, and the framers of the studies have produces varying explanations\nfor the data. In one of the earlier studies, Bonini et al. point to the\nasymmetries in judgments of truth and falsity for borderline cases of\na is red/tall and ultimately reject truth-gap and truth-glut\naccounts in favor of an LEM- and LNC-compatible epistemic theory of\n\u201cvagueness as ignorance\u201d. That is, the subject S\n\u201cmentally represents vague predicates in the same way as other\npredicates with sharp true/false boundaries of whose location\nS is uncertain\u201d (Bonini et al. 1999: 387). \n\n\nKyburg (2000) offers a pragmatic explanation for why a is\ntall might be judged neither true nor false in a case of\nborderline tallness, or why a is tall and a is not tall might\nbe judged true in the same circumstance. Without conceding gaps\nor gluts, she points to a disconnect between truth-value intuitions and\nassertability intuitions for a cooperative speaker aiming to be\nmaximally informative. Of course, in some cases, the felicity of a\nis tall and a isn\u2019t tall might simply reflect the awareness\nthat different cut-off points apply depending on the relevant\ncomparative class of entities (children vs. adults, male adults vs.\nmale professional basketball players, etc.)\u2014the instances\nforeseen by the Aristotelian rider. But in other cases, such a\nstatement would indeed convey that a possesses a borderline degree of\ntallness, while simply affirming or denying the vague\npredicate\u2014a is tall or a is not\ntall\u2014would communicate too high or too low a degree. Just as\nspeakers might a sentence might refrain from uttering, or classifying\nas true, a perfectly and \u201csharply\u201d true sentence whose use\nwould mislead the hearer\u2014Snow is white or snow is\npurple\u2014so too the assertion of a conjunction of opposites in\nborderline cases\u2014a is tall and he\u2019s not\ntall\u2014might be preferred, despite its contradictory nature,\nto the misleading assertion of either a is tall or a is not\ntall in the same circumstance.\n\n\nFor Sorensen (2001), an individual\u2019s acceptance of the truth\nof certain false claims, including those necessarily false claims of\nthe form a is tall and a is not tall, reflect not the\ninadequacy of our semantic and logical analyses but the tendency for\nspeakers to be wrong, confused, or ignorant about the truth conditions\nof given sentences or about their own beliefs, especially those\ninvolving vagueness, similarly to the way in which perceptions can\nmislead in the case of visual illusions.\n\n\nThe vagueness-as-ignorance theory of Bonini et al. (1999), the modal\ntheory of Akiba (1999), the assertability theory of Kyburg (2000), and\nthe error theory of Sorensen (2001) are all semantically classical in\ntheir preservation of LNC (along with LEM and bivalence). In essence,\neach of these approaches to the assessment of vague predications\nreflects a wariness about jettisoning the classical account of truth\nand contradiction in favor of an approach endorsing either\nsupervaluations (and gaps) or subvaluations (and gluts). Despite the\ndifficulties posed by vagueness, these theorists would thus adopt the\nphilosophical corollary to the familiar legal adage: \u201cHard cases\nmake bad laws.\u201d\n\n\nIn two recent papers the reconciliatory approach is rejected in\nfavor of defenses of paraconsistency, although not precisely along the\nlines laid out by Hyde. On Hyde\u2019s account, a is tall and\na is not tall can both be true when a is\nborderline tall (say, 5\u203211\u2033) while the full or reduced conjunction of\nthese statements, a is tall and (a is) not tall, will be\nfalse, given the standard supervaluationist approach. Alxatib &\nPelletier, however, find the opposite judgments among a majority of the\nsubjects of their study, who accept the conjunction while rejecting the\nindividual ascriptions of truth. In addition to reinforcing the view of\ngappy and glutty theories as mirror images, Alxatib & Pelletier\npresent their results as evidence against the neo-classical\nvagueness-as-ignorance position of Bonini et al. (1999), a position\nwhich also has difficulty accounting for the paucity of subjects\nchoosing the \u201ccan\u2019t tell\u201d option in the surveys. Like\nthe assertability-based pragmatic theory of borderline contradictions\nproposed by Kyburg, Alxatib & Pelletier (2011: 321) offer a Gricean\nexplanation for subjects\u2019 endorsement of the truth of apparent\ncontradictory statements\u2014a is tall and not tall when a\nis just short of 6 feet tall\u2014which yields (in just this case) a\nsubvaluationary interpretation on which the speaker is taken to convey\nthe borderline status of a\u2019s height. Their central\nfinding (2011: 298\u20139) is that theories admitting truth-value gaps like\nthat of Hyde (1997) or the paraconsistent logic of Priest 2006 fare\nbetter in accounting for the full range of interesting data presented\nin their experiments\u2014and those of Ripley 2011. \n\nLike Alxatib & Pelletier, Ripley (2011: \u00a72) conducts his own\nsurvey of reactions to apparent contradictions involving vague\npredications (e.g., \u201cThe circle is both is and isn\u2019t near\nthe square\u201d; \u201cThe circle neither is nor isn\u2019t near\nthe square\u201d). He leverages the results of his study to argue\nagainst error (or epistemic) theories on which borderline\ncontradictions are always false even when believed true; he also\nrefutes fuzzy theories of vagueness, which fail to predict why\nsubjects are so willing to accept the truth of borderline\ncontradictions rather than assigning them an intermediate\nacceptability ranking.  Ripley also finds pragmatic or contextualist\ntheories not insufficiently fleshed out to yield the correct\npredictions. He adopts a dialetheist account that enables him to line\nup with a majority of his subjects in finding both \u201ca\nis F and a is not F\u201d and \u201ca is\nneither F nor not F\u201d true for borderline\napplications of F.  Supporting this view, he notes (2011:\n186\u20137) that there may be variation with respect to the \u201ccultural\naversion to contradictions\u201d; there is evidence tending to\nsuggest that Asian subjects are less likely than Westerners\n(specifically, as it happens, Canadians) to object to contradictions\nlike \u201cIt\u2019s raining and it\u2019s not raining.\u201d But as Ripley\nconcedes, more research is needed on this point.\n7. Contradiction in everyday life\n\n\nThe logical incoherence of contradictions is the ground both for\nindecision (as with Zerlina\u2019s ambivalent Vorrei e non\nvorrei in our epigraph) and for the pragmatic exploitation of\napparent contradictions for communicative ends. One locus is the\noxymoron, a phrasal contradiction recognized for millennia as a figure\nof speech. The dramatic effect of yoking contradictories is as old as\nthe classical festina lente (\u2018make haste slowly\u2019,\nadopted as a motto by Augustine and the Medicis. The German\ncounterpart, deployed by Goethe and others, adds rhyme: Eile mit\nWeile.\n\n\nThe use of actual or apparent contradiction to generate meanings via\nreconstrual may convey advice to seek the middle way, reminiscent of\nthe function of borderline contradictions surveyed in \u00a76, or may,\nin the case of an apparently incoherent phrasal structure, serve as a\nsignal that the modifier constrains the denotation of the head. Thus\nbittersweet is not taken as self-contradictory property, while\na tragicomedy is a work or production that spans the two\nnormally opposed genres\u2014recall Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cI am\nlarge; I contain multitudes\u201d. Classic oxymorons include cruel\nkindness, living death, and true lies; jocular\nones are regularly proposed, from military intelligence and\ncongressional ethics to airplane food and open\nsecrets. A particularly transparent form is offered by those\npromoting undesign design or the non-concept\nconcept.\n\n\nThe oxymoron, and in particular the catalogue of oxymorons, may\nsignal the breakdown of logical coherence, given the explosive effect\nof ex contradictione quodlibet. In Romeo and Juliet,\nwe ascend from the former\u2019s risible inventory of battling\nbinaries to the latter\u2019s ardent valediction on her balcony:\n\n\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\n\nO anything, of nothing first create!\n\nO heavy lightness! Serious vanity!\n\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\n\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Romeo and Juliet, I.i\n\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\n\nThat I should say good night till it be morrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Romeo and Juliet, II.ii\n\n\n\nExpanding from the phrasal to the sentential level, we find\nself-contradictory propositions, whether in full or elliptical form,\nfunctioning in forums from high culture to social media to generate a\nvariety of implicatures. In her recent study of the phenomenology of\nambivalence, Razinsky takes the affirmation of conjoined\ncontradictories \u201ca is v and a is not v\u201d\nfor a given value judgment v, or the affirmation of \u201ca\nis v and a is v\u00b4\u201d where v,\nv\u00b4 are contraries (e.g. a is good and a is\nbad), to be \u201ccentral to the logic of value and of\nvalue judgment\u201d (2017: 229). Some apparent instances of\nambivalence (and of any underlying violation of LNC) can be explained\naway. Citing Mill, Razinsky (2017: 201) accepts that there are\ninstances in which a is just and a is unjust reflects only an\napparent opposition, to be understood essentially as a is just in\nsome respects and a is unjust in other respects. Such cases\nillustrate the prescience of the Aristotelian rider: \u201ca is\nF\u201d and \u201ca is not F\u201d cannot both\nhold in the same sense, at the same time, and in the same\nrespect. Similarly, the imposition of the edict a\nought to F and a ought not to F results in difficulty for the\nunfortunate a, to be sure, but not necessarily in an LNC\nviolation, given the availability of distinct sources of obligation.\nBut other cases involve true ambivalence: \u201cMeaningful\ncontradictions are moored in the possibility of conceptual\nambivalence\u201d (Razinsky 2017: 44). The analysis of such cases must\npreserve the dynamic tension in affirming that a is v and a is\nnot-v and at the same time acknowledge the speaker\u2019s\nawareness of the violation of LNC, not an easy task: \u201cDo people\nbelieve contradictions when it comes to value? I do not think there is\na good answer to give here\u201d (Razinsky 2017: 228)\u2014they\nbelieve them and do not believe them.\n\n\nPerhaps as a reflection of this tension, the A-not-A meme has widely\nproliferated in popular entertainment, advertisements, and social\nmedia. \u201cSorry not sorry\u201d has become a standard device for\na sarcastic or insincere apology (also known as a \u201cnon-apology\napology\u201d), while #SorryNotSorry is a trending Twitter hashtag as\nwell as a Demi Lovato song title (see Carey 2014 in Other Internet\nResources). A related meme is \u201cI\u2019m not saying, I\u2019m just\nsaying\u201d, a now notorious \u201cget out of jail free\u201d\ndiscourse ploy showing up in hundreds of google hits, as the subject\nof an urbandictionary entry and several online commentaries by\nlinguists, and as the title of a 2012 flash fiction paperback by\nMatthew Salesses.  The category of \u201cChristmas-not-Christmas\nmovies\u201d makes its perennial appearance on the web during holiday\nseason, and the #worknotwork has been adopted as the house meme of\nSamsonite luggage.\n  #GuiltyNotGuilty\nis another popular hashtag as well as a theme for Gucci ads.\n\n\nA relatively new means for expressing ambivalence in colloquial U.S.\nand Australian English is the \u201cYeah no\u201d (or, less\nfrequently, \u201cNo yeah\u201d) response, which has been analyzed as\nconveying a variety of possible discourse functions (see Burridge &\nFlorey 2002, Lee-Goldman 2011, and Liberman 2008 in Other Internet\nResources).\n\n\nThe conjunction of contradictory predicates of the form not A\nand/but not NOT A is used to indicate the borderline status of an\nentity with respect to a category and its complement:\n \n\nThey not brown but they not NOT brown.\n[Saturday Night Live (faux commercial \nLevi\u2019s Wokes),\n Nov. 30, 2017]\nKarl Mitze, Geoff Manyin, Nick Montopoli, and Zachariah Matteson\nredefine what it means to be a string quartet.

No. Are they even in the middle, like not\nhealthy but not not healthy?\nNo.\n [Creme de la Crumb recipe column]\n\n\n\nWhile these appear fully contradictory, that diagnosis relies on the\nstatus of S is not not P as an instance of \u00ac(\u00ac(S is\nP)) within a logic employing a robust Law of Double Negation. Arguably,\nhowever, in each of these attestations, the inner\nnegation\u2014not brown, not punk, not healthy, and even\nnot-raining\u2014can be viewed as a coerced or virtual\ncontrary, in which case the two negations do not fully cancel out.\nThus, just as not impossible fails to reduce to possible,\nnot not classical is distinct from classical, and no\nactual violation of LNC is ultimately condoned. But, as on\nGrice\u2019s (1989) analysis of irony and tautology, it is the\nrecognition of the apparent contradiction that the speaker exploits to\ngenerate the higher-order coherence of the message.\n\n\nA less, or perhaps differently, mediated case of coherence in\napparent contradictories involves prosody. In this case, the\nhearer/reader seems to have to reconcile LNC with the joint predication\nof A and not A rather than the more complex not A\nand not not A. But on closer examination, the task is less\ndaunting than it appears, as it\u2019s really a matter of affirming\nA while rejecting A, or of\nmetalinguistically rejecting A in favor of\nA:\n\nAfter playing a staggering 40,000 minutes (in just 11\nseasons) and carrying four straight Finals teams, LeBron [James] might\nbe battling the long-term effects of a historically ridiculous two-way\nburden.

Get\nit?)\n [https://tinyurl.com/y8656rqy,\n of Jon Snow on Game of Thrones]\n\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the role contradiction plays as a lively\nsource of ironic humor, especially for the highbrow reader. In one\n New Yorker cartoon \n(Benjamin Schwartz, March 30, 2015), a veterinarian comes into the\nwaiting room, places a comforting arm on the worried man\u2019s\nshoulder, and breaks the news: \u201cAbout your cat, Mr.\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2014I have good news and bad news.\u201d (See\n\u00a74 above for more on the poor cat\u2019s indeterminate\nprognosis.)
