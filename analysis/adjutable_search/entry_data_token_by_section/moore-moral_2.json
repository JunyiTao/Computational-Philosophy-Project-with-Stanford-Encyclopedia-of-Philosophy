    "main_text": "Impersonal Consequentialism\n3. Impersonal Consequentialism\n\nMoore\u2019s normative view again comprised two main theses. One was\nimpersonal consequentialism, the view that what is right is always\nwhat produces the greatest total good impartially considered, or\ncounting all goods equally. The other was the ideal or perfectionist\nthesis that what is good is not only or primarily pleasure or the\nsatisfaction of desires but certain states whose value is independent\nof people\u2019s attitudes to them. Moore recognized several such\nstates, but in Principia Ethica he famously said that\n\u201cby far the most valuable things\u2026are certain states of\nconsciousness, which may roughly be described as the pleasures of\nhuman intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects\u201d (1903:\n188/1993: 237). According to his ideal consequentialism, what is right\nis in large part what most promotes loving personal relationships and\naesthetic appreciation for all persons everywhere.\n\nPrincipia Ethica took the consequentialist part of this view\nto be analytically true, since it defined the right as what most\npromotes the good. But once Moore abandoned this definition, he had to\ntreat the consequentialist principle as synthetic and he did so in\nEthics, which allowed that deontological views that say some\nacts that maximize the good are wrong are coherent. But even there he\ndid not argue at length for consequentialism, simply announcing that\nit is self-evident (1912: 180\u201381/1947: 112\u201313/1965:\n76\u201377). This in part reflected a common assumption of his time,\nwhen a majority of moral philosophers accepted some form of\nconsequentialism. But it may also be relevant that the only\nalternative he seems to have considered was an absolute deontology\nlike Kant\u2019s, which says that some acts such as killing and lying\nare wrong no matter what their consequences (1903: 106/1993: 157;\n1912: 175\u201381/1947: 109\u201313/1965: 74\u201377). His major\nethical works did not consider a moderate deontology such as would\nlater be developed by Ross (1930), in which deontological prohibitions\nagainst killing and lying often outweigh considerations of good\nconsequences but can themselves be outweighed if enough good is at\nstake. It is not clear what Moore\u2019s response to such a moderate\ndeontology would have been.\n\nPrincipia Ethica also took the impartialism of its view to be\nanalytic, and in particular claimed that ethical or rational egoism,\nwhich says each person should pursue only his own good, is\nself-contradictory. (Despite his interest in personal love, Moore\nnever considered the intermediate view that Broad (1971)) would call\nself-referential altruism, according to which each person should care\nmore about the good of those close to him, such as his family and\nfriends.) Sidgwick had claimed that if a rational egoist confines\nhimself to saying that each person\u2019s pleasure is good for him,\nor from his point of view, he cannot be argued out of his position\n(1907: 420\u201321). But Moore argued that the concept of\nagent-relative goodness invoked here is unintelligible (1903:\n97\u2013102/1993: 148\u201353), and that conclusion does follow from\nhis view that goodness is simple and unanalyzable. If goodness is a\nsimple property, how can a state such as person A\u2019s\npleasure have this property \u201cfrom one point of view\u201d but\nnot \u201cfrom another\u201d? (Compare squareness. An object cannot\nbe square from one point of view but not from another; it either is\nsquare or is not.) All that talk of the good \u201cfor\u201d a\nperson can pick out, he urged, is what is simply good and located in\nthat person; and simple goodness gives everyone equally reason to\npursue it. In Ethics Moore abandoned this argument, saying\nthat egoism cannot be proven false by any argument, even though he\nthought its falsity is self-evident (1912: 228\u201332/1947:\n141\u201343/1965: 98\u2013100). But it is not clear how he could\nmake this concession if he still held, as he preferred to, that\ngoodness is a simple property. Perhaps he was tacitly allowing, as he\nwould in the uncompleted draft Preface to Principia Ethica\n(1993: 5, 14\u201315), that it would not centrally damage his\nposition if good were analyzed in terms of ought, as it had been by\nSidgwick. There is no contradiction in saying that what each person\nought to desire is different, say, just his own pleasure. But if all\noughts derive from a simple property of goodness, as Moore always\npreferred to hold, all oughts must be impartial.\n\nIn applying this view, Moore gave it the form of what today is called\n\u201cindirect\u201d or \u201ctwo-level\u201d (Hare 1981)\nconsequentialism. In deciding how to act, we should not try to assess\nindividual acts for their specific consequences; instead, we should\nfollow certain general moral rules, such as \u201cDo not kill\u201d\nand \u201cKeep promises,\u201d which are such that adhering to them\nwill most promote the good through time. This policy will sometimes\nlead us not to do the act with the best individual outcome, but given\nour general propensity to error the policy\u2019s consequences will\nbe better in the long run than trying to assess acts one by one;\nhowever well-meaning, the latter attempt will be counterproductive\n(1903: 149\u201370/1993: 198\u2013219. This indirect\nconsequentialism had again been defended earlier, by Sidgwick and John\nStuart Mill, but Moore gave it a very conservative form, urging\nadherence to the rules even in the face of apparently compelling\nevidence that breaking them now would be optimific. Principia\nEthica made the surprising claim that the relevant rules will be\nthe same given any commonly accepted theory of the good, for example,\ngiven either hedonism or Moore\u2019s own ideal theory (1903:\n158/1993: 207). This claim of extensional equivalence for different\nconsequentialist views was not new; T.H. Green, F.H. Bradley, and\nMcTaggart had all suggested that hedonism and ideal consequentialism\nhave similar practical implications. But Moore was surely expressing\nthe more plausible view when in Ethics he doubted that\npleasure and ideal values always go together (1912: 234\u201339/1947:\n144\u201347/1965: 100\u201302), and even when he accepted the\nequivalence claim he remained intensely interested in what he called\n\u201cthe primary ethical question of what is good in itself\u201d\n(1903: 158, 26, 77/1993: 207, 78, 128). Like Green, Bradley, and\nMcTaggart, he thought the central philosophical question is what\nexplains why good things are good, i.e., which of their\nproperties make them good. That was the subject of his most\nbrilliant piece of ethical writing, Chapter 6 of Principia\nEthica on \u201cThe Ideal.\u201d\n",
