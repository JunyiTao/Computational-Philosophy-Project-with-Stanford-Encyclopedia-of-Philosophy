    "main_text": "Esotericism, Censorship, and Polemics\n4. Esotericism, Censorship, and Polemics\n\nMany late classical and medieval philosophical texts contain esoteric\nelements. The desire to hide the real message of a text in its earlier\nforms springs from some form of gnosticism. Gnostic sects, needing to\nprotect their knowledge from dissemination among non-initiates, hid\ntheir true message in ways that could only be deciphered by those who\npossessed the secret knowledge. Leo Strauss makes the additional\nargument that the motives for esotericism in Jewish and Islamic\nmedieval thinkers are political. Revelation in Judaism and Islam deals\nfundamentally with law, with the correct social order, whereas in\nChristianity it is the revelation of a creed or set of dogmas, Strauss\nargues. Hence, to interpret revelation in Judaism and Islam is always\na political act. Interpreting law is much further from the task of\nphilosophy than interpreting dogma, placing philosophy on the\nperiphery of Islamic and Jewish society as opposed to being an\nintegral part of the official training of students as it was in the\nChristian West. The inherently marginal character of philosophy in\nthese societies makes it politically dangerous to be a philosopher.\nFurther, Strauss argues, for these thinkers human nature is\nessentially and inevitably divided between \u201cthe few\u201d who\nare capable to doing and understanding philosophy, and \u201cthe\nmany\u201d who were not capable of digesting the truths of philosophy\nand who must be protected from philosophy. Exposure of the many to\nphilosophy tends to undermine the authority of revelation and the\nreligious and political authority given the power to explain and\npromulgate the revealed law. For Strauss, the difference between\nJewish and Islamic thinkers, on the one hand, and Christian thinkers,\non the other, is also exemplified in the different literary sources on\nwhich they relied. For Christian thinkers, the models are Aristotle\nand Cicero, for Jewish and Islamic thinkers, the models are the\ndialogues of Plato, especially the Republic and the\nLaws. Strauss\u2019s thesis is that these writers hid in\ntheir exoteric teaching an esoteric teaching to be discerned by\nreading between the lines. In practice, this means taking small\ninconsistencies and other discrepancies in the text as indicative of a\ndeeper or hidden view, looking for the author\u2019s\n\u201creal\u201d views in the mouths of characters in a dialogue or\nallegory who are otherwise presented unfavorably, etc. Strauss\u2019s\nviews on how to interpret the literary form of medieval philosophical\ntexts are controversial, but they have made the literary form and\nhermeneutics applied to these texts a question that must, especially\nfor Islamic and Jewish writers, be confronted. For Maimonides, for\nexample, an esoteric or \u2018dualist\u2019 reading would claim that\nMaimonides holds Aristotelian positions on the eternity of the world,\nthe possibility of miracles and on other matters which would bring him\ninto conflict with Judaism but must hide such views from political and\nreligious authorities, signalling them only obliquely to the few in\nthe Guide for the Perplexed but expressing non-Aristotelian\nviews in his work commenting on Jewish law and scriptures. Daniel\nFrank (2003, 144\u20135) argues against this view that Maimonides\n\u201cmay best be understood philosophically as engaged in critical\ndialogue with Aristotle, almost invariably disagreeing with him, but\nindebted to Aristotle for his mode of discourse, argument forms, and\nphilosophical vocabulary.\u201d Moreover, Frank points out that the\nplausibility of extreme esotericism in Islamic and Jewish\nphilosophical texts may be exaggerated by an unhistorical dichotomy\nbetween Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism (also discussed above,\nsection 2. 4) (Frank 2003, 142\u20133). That is, because we see a\nconflict between and author\u2019s Aristotelian and Neoplatonic\nviews, we speculate that one view is their \u2018real\u2019 view,\nand the other, their \u2018cover\u2019 view, while thinkers in this\ncontext would have seen Aristotelian and Neoplatonic positions as\nquite compatible. (On Maimonides and esotericism, see also Ravitsky\n2005).\n\nWhile rejecting the extreme position Strauss takes on medieval\nphilosophical texts, many scholars have noted the esoteric elements\npresent in some medieval texts by Christian as well as Islamic and\nJewish writers (see Butterworth 2001). Boethius, for example, presents\nhis theological views not to the many but to his trusted teachers and\nadvisors, writing in a highly dense and technical language in his\nDe Hebdomadibus accessible only to the learned (Boethius\n1973, 38\u201341). As late as the end of the 12th century, Alan of\nLille writes in theological texts of the need to protect the sacred\ntruths of theology from the incursions of uneducated students in the\nliberal arts (Alan of Lille 1981, 119\u2013122), and, in the 11th\ncentury, Anselm complains of the work he intended only for his fellow\nmonks in the Cur Deus Homo being disseminated without his\nconsent and in a form he did not approve of (Anselm 1998,\n261\u20132). Like many medieval authors, he expresses great concern\nthat his work will be misunderstood and strives to protect himself\nfrom misinterpretation. Just as writers chose certain forms and\nrhetoric for philosophical texts for learned and elite audiences, so\ndifferent literary forms were chosen for works intended for a wide and\npopular audience, using the forms of encyclopedia and instructional\nmanuals, but also poetry, sermons, biblical exegesis and mystical\nwritings to introduce philosophical ideas to a wide audience (See\nAbram, Harvey, and Muelethaler 2022).\n\nIn the Latin, Christian world, though philosophy and speculative\ntheology is accepted as a legitimate endeavor, enshrined by the 13th\ncentury in the university curriculum, philosophical writers were\nsometimes censured by theological authorities, and some views were at\nvarious times condemned as false and contrary to the faith, most\nfamously in what is known as the Condemnation of 1277 (Thiessen 1998;\nAertsen, Emery, et al. 2001; and Bianchi 2003). This threat, some have\nargued, influenced some writers to pull their punches, to make\nconcessions or professions of ignorance or humility that were not\nauthentically part of their views. Hence, for example, some have\nargued that Abelard\u2019s statement in his theology disclaiming any\nability or pretense to address the issues necessary for salvation or\nto give anything more than verisimilitudes about the divine, is a\nconcession to his persecutors more than a sincere statement of his\nview of his own work (Abelard 1987, 123, 201; Sweeney 2006,\n90\u20133). Christian writers operating before the formation of the\nuniversities and the development of acceptable university forms of\nwriting, i.e., commentaries on Aristotle, on the Sentences of\nPeter Lombard, disputed questions, etc., need to justify their\nwriting, to explain the nature of its audience, to show the\nauthor\u2019s submission to the proper authorities. Readers must\nconsider whether these kinds of statements can simply be disregarded\nas obligatory but not sincere, and whether they affect the\npresentation of the philosophical and theological arguments in the\ntext. While it might be tempting to see them merely as pro\nforma, it is clear that complete disregard of such remarks is\nanachronistic. Such views, for example, contributed to the now\nthoroughly rejected view of Abelard as pure rationalist and as a rebel\nagainst church authority. Nonetheless, concern about avoiding conflict\nor censure is real among these writers. For example, after the\ncondemnation of many Aristotelian positions in 1277, authors take care\nto note when they are simply citing or describing a point of view in\norder to consider it or argue against it, signaling with a phrase like\n\u201cdico recitative\u201d that they are not subscribing\nto that position.\n\nParallel to the highly formalized and structured debate of the\ndisputations in the later Middle Ages, there are also highly\nformalized ways of engaging in debate with one\u2019s contemporaries\nthat shift to some degree over time. In the 12th and 13th centuries,\nfor example, while it is acceptable to attach names of church teachers\nand authorities from earlier generations to opposing positions, even\nto positions opposed by the contemporary writer of a text, one\u2019s\ncontemporaries or from the recent past were never directly named but\nmerely referred to as \u201csomeone\u201d or \u201ccertain\npeople\u201d who might hold a given position. However, this should\nnot be interpreted as deference to one\u2019s contemporaries or as an\nattempt to quell controversy, since authors became adept at signaling\ntheir opponents without actually naming them, paraphrasing or\nparodying their views or catchphrases as modes of ridicule or play. In\nthe late 13th century, Duns Scotus begins to give partial references\nto the contemporary thinkers and texts with which he is in\nconversation; Peter Aureol in the 14th century gives full and accurate\ncitations. Gregory of Rimini (d. 1358) begins to develop something\ncloser to a \u201chistorico-critical approach to theology,\u201d\ncarefully citing authoritative texts.\n\nThis development parallels one in some medieval sermons, where the\nwriters find ways of referring (often by puns) to themselves as author\nof the sermon. The shift is from an interest in the arguments to\ninterest in the individual thinkers. One cause for these changes might\nbe the internationalization of the writers and texts. In a more\nparochial world, everyone would know who held certain positions; but\nin a wider context, those at Oxford, for example, might not be known\nand needed to be named in Paris. These changes might have also been\ncaused by the growing self-consciousness and sense of individuality\nhistorians have noticed in other aspects of medieval academic and\nsocial life.\n",
