    "main_text": "Skepticism\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nAlthough Malebranche had his share of admirers and imitators, he also\nhad his share of critics. The theory of Vision in God was subjected to\nsevere and sometimes bitter attacks by some of his contemporaries,\nespecially Cartesians such as Arnauld and R\u00e9gis who saw\nthemselves as defending the legacy of Descartes against a corrupting\ninfluence. Fortunately for us, Malebranche was eager to defend himself\nand his replies to criticisms often help elucidate and amplify his\noriginal doctrine, as stated in the first edition (1674) of the\nSearch After Truth. In some cases, these replies are quite\nextensive. Although the dispute with Arnauld ranged over other topics,\nand was originally sparked by theological differences, it lasted some\n11 years and occupies several volumes (four of Malebranche\u2019s,\ntwo of Arnauld\u2019s) of their collected works. Some of\nMalebranche\u2019s critics were dismissive of his doctrine.\n\u2018[Vision in God] is an opinion that spreads not and is like to\ndie of itself, or at least do no great harm,\u2019 John Locke was\nreported as saying three days before his death (quoted in Cranston\n1957, 478). Malebranche, however, could be equally disparaging of his\nopponents. To his critic Simon Foucher, he quipped: \u2018When one\ncriticizes a book, it seems to me necessary at least to have read\nit\u2019 (OC 2:496). But once the dust from the ad hominems\nsettled, several important philosophical issues became apparent. We\nshall begin here by discussing objections to the doctrine that were\nprevalent in Malebranche\u2019s own time and his replies to them.\nWe\u2019ll focus on internal criticisms, that is, objections\nthat purport to expose incoherencies, unsound arguments, and\ninconsistencies with larger aspects of his philosophy (as opposed to\ncomplaints, for example, about his Cartesian infidelities). Toward the\nend of this section, we shall examine a few objections that have been\nraised by recent commentators.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an objection that may have already occurred to\nthe reader. Malebranche claims that the idea of the infinite cannot be\na modification of our mind, for our mind is finite; it can only reside\nin God, the sole infinite being. But anyone familiar with\nDescartes\u2019 causal argument for God\u2019s existence, from the\nThird Meditation, knows that he argued otherwise. We have an innate\nidea of an actually infinite being that has been implanted in us by\nGod himself. How, as finite beings, can we contain such an idea? To\nanswer this question, Descartes drew an important distinction between\ntwo aspects of an idea \u2013 its so-called \u2018formal\u2019\nbeing and its \u2018objective,\u2019 or representational, being.\nFormal being is the kind of being or reality that ideas have in virtue\nof being modes or modifications of one\u2019s mind. As such, they all\nhave the same degree of finite reality. Whether I am thinking of the\nsun, my own mind, or an infinite substance, my ideas in this case are\nall finite, formally speaking. However, insofar as they represent\ndifferent things to my mind, my ideas have different degrees of what\nhe calls \u2018objective reality,\u2019 exploiting a notion\nprevalent among scholastic philosophers. The idea of myself as a\nthinking thing, for example, has a finite degree of objective reality,\nwhile the idea of God has an infinite degree of such reality. The\nlevel of objective reality of an idea is determined by the level of\nreality that the object it represents has formally. So Descartes\nthought that as a finite being, my ideas must all have a finite degree\nof formal reality, but they can have varying degrees of objective\nreality all the way up to the infinite level. He would thus reject\nMalebranche\u2019s claim that insofar as my ideas represent something\ninfinite, they must reside in God.\n\nOne should not suppose that Malebranche was unaware of\nDescartes\u2019 distinction between formal and objective reality. On\nthe contrary, he casts the distinction in even starker terms: the\nmind\u2019s perceptions have formal reality, and only formal\nreality, for they do not represent anything beyond themselves.\nObjective reality is reserved for ideas in God, the only\nrepresentative beings. But why can\u2019t ideas be perceptions in\nfinite minds? In particular, why can\u2019t our mind have an idea\nwith infinite objective reality? As faithful Cartesians, Arnauld and\nR\u00e9gis both raise this objection against Malebranche, though\nusing slightly different technical vocabulary. Instead of speaking of\nformal and objective reality, they speak of something being finite or\ninfinite in essendo as opposed to finite or infinite in\nrepraesentando, respectively. Addressing Malebranche directly,\nArnauld writes:\n\n\n[I]t is not true that a modality of our soul, which is finite, cannot\nrepresent an infinite thing; and it is true, on the contrary, that\nhowever finite our perceptions may be, there are some which must pass\nfor infinite in this sense, that they represent the infinite. This is\nwhat M. R\u00e9gis correctly maintained to you, and what he meant by\nthese terms, that they are finite in essendo, and infinite\nin repraesentando. You are not happy with this distinction.\nToo bad for you. (OA 40:88\u20139; also see R\u00e9gis SG\n1:194)\n\n\nMalebranche responds:\n\n\n[S]ince [the modalities of our soul] are finite, we cannot find the\ninfinite there, since nothingness is not visible, and one cannot\nperceive in the soul what is not there. Similarly, from the fact that\nI perceive in a circle an infinity of equal diameters, or rather, from\nthe fact that there are equal diameters therein in\nrepraesentando, I must concede that they are really there in\nessendo. For, in effect, a circle contains the reality of an\ninfinity of diameters. In order, then for a reality to be present to\nthe mind, for it to affect the mind, for the mind to perceive or\nreceive it, it necessarily must really be there. (OC 9:954)\n\n\nMalebranche\u2019s reply is subtle and lends itself to multiple\ninterpretations (see e.g., Nadler 1992, 41f; Radner 1978, 107\u20138,\n110\u201318 and Schmaltz 2000, 73). One way to understand it is to\ncompare it to a causal principle that Descartes invokes in his\nargument for God\u2019s existence in the Third Meditation. He claims\nthat the objective reality of an idea (such as that of God) must have\na cause with at least as much formal reality. Using this\nprinciple, he concludes that only a being with infinite formal reality\ncan be the cause of the (infinite) objective reality of my idea of\nsuch being. Now, Malebranche is not concerned with causes in this\ncontext but with what is required for something to be present to the\nmind; nevertheless, he is making the same general point: something\ncannot give what reality it does not have. In perceiving a general\nidea, such as a circle, we are able to perceive an infinite number of\npossible diameters (and thus an infinity of possible particular\ncircles). Thus, the general idea of circle contains an infinite degree\nof reality. If this idea were a modification of my mind, my mind\nitself would have to be infinite, which it clearly is not.\n\nHow should we assess Malebranche\u2019s reply? To the contemporary\nreader, the suggestion that ideas and things can have different levels\nof reality or being sounds bizarre, but to his seventeenth-century\nreaders, especially his Cartesian adversaries, this was a common view.\nEvaluated from that perspective, Malebranche\u2019s response holds up\nwell.\n\nLet us now consider a second objection, related to the first. A good\ngeneral source of objections to Vision in God is Malebranche\u2019s\nown Elucidations, which was first appended to the\nSearch in 1678, only four years after the original edition.\nThere he faces objections that had already been raised against the\ndoctrine, but also anticipates criticisms that were to be developed\nlater, such as Arnauld\u2019s worry that Vision in God reduces to\nVision of God, which we have already discussed. One of the\nobjections canvassed there raises a cluster of difficulties.\nMalebranche claims that God is the locus of intelligibility, but why\ncouldn\u2019t this \u2018intelligible world\u2019 (monde\nintelligible) reside in our own mind? God supposedly sees all\npossible creatures in his own perfections, but why couldn\u2019t the\nmind see extension at least in its own being? Malebranche subscribes\nto what might be called a \u2018cognitive resemblance thesis,\u2019\nwhich holds that the immediate object of cognition must have the same\nnature as the mind, which is immaterial or spiritual. According to\nthis principle, in order for the mind to see material things in\nthemselves, it would have to be material. But how is God any better\noff here, as he too is immaterial? \u2018The soul is not material,\nadmitted. But God, though he is a pure spirit, sees bodies in himself;\nwhy could not the soul, then, see them by considering itself, even\nthough it itself is spiritual?\u2019 (OC 3:147, LO 624).\n\nTo answer this objection, Malebranche stresses the distinction between\ninfinite and finite natures, as he understands it: whereas the mind is\na limited, particular being, God is \u2018universal being\u2019 or\n\u2018being without restriction\u2019 that consists of an infinity\nof perfections. Because he is infinite and indeterminate, God can\ncontain the perfections of materials things in an\n\u2018eminent\u2019 or higher sense, without thereby becoming\nextended. \u2018But as the soul is a particular being, a limited\nbeing, it cannot have extension in it without becoming material,\nwithout being composed of two substances\u2019 (OC 3:148, ibid.). The\nthesis that God contains the perfections of created beings\n\u2018eminently,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018formally\u2019 or\nliterally, is one that Malebranche borrows from Descartes, but he puts\nhis own spin on it by conceiving God as a general being. Recall that\nMalebranche appropriates this conception from St. Thomas Aquinas and,\nindeed, invokes the saint\u2019s name here:\n\n\nGod\u2019s ideas of creatures are, as Saint Thomas says, only his\nessence, insofar as it is participable or imperfectly imitable, for\nGod contains every creaturely perfection, though in a divine and\ninfinite way; he is one and he is all\u2026. But the soul \u2026 is\na particular being, a very limited and imperfect being. Certainly it\ncannot see in itself what is not there in any way at all. How could we\nsee in one species of being all species of being, or in a finite and\nparticular being a triangle in general and infinite triangles? (OC\n3:149, LO 625)\n\n\nThe claim that God is \u2018being in general,\u2019 however, invites\nfurther objections, both theological and philosophical. The God of\nChristianity is supposed to be a personal savior who hears our prayers\nand absolves us of sin, not an abstract\n universal.[1]\n It may be difficult to save Malebranche (or Aquinas) from this\nobjection, but one should note that the \u2018God of the\nphilosophers,\u2019 conceived of in purely intellectual terms as an\ninfinite and all perfect being, is already removed from the more\nchurchly conception. To add that God is universal being takes us even\nfurther from that conception, though the Christian philosopher can\nalways insist that scripture need not be taken literally. Malebranche\nhimself maintains that his view of God follows from divine infinity,\nwhich of course has a scriptural basis.\n\nThe conception of God as being in general also offended the\nphilosophical sensibilities of the seventeenth century, which tended\nto favor a nominalist or conceptualist account of universals.\nAccording to this anti-Platonistic view, which had adherents among\nrationalists (e.g., Descartes) and empiricists (e.g., Locke) alike,\nthe only things that exist are particulars, and so-called universals\nsuch as numbers or geometric objects are merely concepts or names. To\nconceive God as a universal violates this creed and, in the view of\nLocke specifically, makes God a bare abstraction (McCracken 1983,\n139). Malebranche, however, maintains that the existence of God or\nbeing in general is necessary to explain the very possibility of\nabstract thought:\n\n\nthe mind would be incapable of representing universal ideas of genus,\nspecies, and so on, to itself had it not seen all beings contained in\none\u2026. [S]ense can be made of the way the mind knows certain\nabstract and general truths only through the presence of Him who can\nenlighten the mind in an infinity of different ways. (Search\n3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO 232)\n\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the possibility of abstract cognition\ndemands Vision in God. Some rival theories of abstract\ncognition, prevalent in the period, did not require a Platonistic\nontology, and arguably were more philosophically satisfying.\n\nThis brings us to yet another objection, concerning the ontology of\nideas in God. Following Descartes, Malebranche proclaims throughout\nhis work that everything that exists is either a substance or a\nmodification of a substance. Thus, it would seem that if ideas are in\nGod then they too must be either substances in their own right or\ndivine modifications. Malebranche explicitly denies the latter, for\nGod is immutable and thus \u2018incapable of modifications\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO 625). But they cannot be substances\neither for that would violate the theological doctrine that God is\nperfectly simple (more on this below). Malebranche, it would appear,\nis forced to abandon his substance-mode ontology: \u2018I believe\nthat intelligible extension is neither a substance nor a modification\nof substance, notwithstanding the axiom of the Philosophers [that\neverything is a either a substance or a mode]\u2019 (OC 6:245). One\nmust be careful, however, not to read this remark as conceding defeat,\nfor in the continuation of this reply to Arnauld and in the passage\nabove, he identifies ideas with God\u2019s substance:\n\u2018God\u2019s ideas of creatures are \u2026 only His essence,\ninsofar as it is participable or imperfectly imitable\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO 625). Perhaps Malebranche is not\ninconsistent after all for, as it turns out, ideas are substances,\njust not distinct substances. They are God\u2019s substance conceived\nof in a certain way. The problem, unfortunately, goes beyond the issue\nof whether Malebranche is inconsistent. We are never given a clear\naccount of the ontology of ideas; even in identifying them with God he\nmust rely on the Platonic metaphor of participation.\n\nThere is also considerable pressure in Malebranche\u2019s philosophy\nagainst identifying ideas with God (even with all of the\nqualifications that identification usually assumes). In holding that\nGod creates via archetypes, Malebranche seems committed to the\nposition that ideas are discrete, and not just as we perceive them but\nfor God himself. This may require only one idea of extension, but\nthere also must be an idea of the mind. This again raises the problem\nof reconciling the theory of ideas with divine simplicity, a doctrine\nto which Malebranche is strongly committed and, ironically, to which\nhe appeals in arguing for Vision in God (see section 4). Even two\ndiscrete ideas in God would be sufficient to violate his simplicity,\nand sometimes Malebranche speaks as if there are more. He recognizes\nthat there is a problem here: \u2018there is a great deal of\ndifficulty in reconciling the Divine Being\u2019s simplicity with\nthis variety of intelligible ideas that He contains in His\nwisdom\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:137, LO 618). But his only solution is to\nappeal to divine incomprehensibility. \u2018[T]he divine substance in\nits simplicity \u2026 is beyond our reach\u2026.\u2019 (Dialogue 2,\nOC 12:52; JS 22).\n\nFar from trying to reconcile divine simplicity with his theory of\nideas, Malebranche seems to exacerbate the problem in some of the ways\nhe characterizes ideas. In Elucidation 10 and elsewhere, for example,\nhe speaks of the \u2018parts\u2019 of intelligible extension (see\ne.g., Elucidation 10, OC 3:152\u20133; LO 627). This locution led\nArnauld and others to worry not just about divine simplicity but\nwhether Malebranche was a Spinozistic pantheist who identified God\nwith extension. Malebranche replied that by \u2018parts\u2019 he\nmeant intelligible parts, not spatial ones (Dialogue 4, OC\n12:95, JS 58), but it is not clear how this solves the problem,\nespecially since these so-called intelligible parts continue to\nfunction like spatial ones within his theory, becoming larger or\nsmaller depending on the object we are perceiving and our perspective\non it (Radner 1978, 117f). The charge of Spinozism would continue to\nhaunt Malebranche throughout his career and was developed with even\ngreater zeal by a former student named Dortuous de Mairan toward the\nend of his life.\n\nOne recent commentator has tried to make sense of Malebranche\u2019s\ntalk of intelligible parts, in a way that preserves God\u2019s\nsimplicity and avoids the dangers of pantheism, by conceiving\nintelligible extension as a set of \u201cpoint-like entities\u201d\nthat correspond to material extension. Jasper Reid stresses that the\nformer are not real points and that the relation between them is not\none of actual distance. Indeed, he maintains that these intelligible\npoints are points only in relation to the intellect that conceives\nintelligible extension in a partial manner. One virtue of this\ninterpretation, he argues, is that it establishes an isomorphism or\nidentity of structure between intelligible extension and the corporeal\nworld without making the former materially extended (2003, 600).\nReid\u2019s view is motivated in part by the conviction that\nMalebranche conceived representation in terms of resemblance.\nIntelligible extension can represent the material world only if it\nresembles it in some way. He sees Malebranche\u2019s talk of\nintelligible parts as gesturing at the aforementioned structural\nresemblance. Reid\u2019s view is very ingenious but it suffers from\nphilosophical and textual shortcomings. Although one other commentator\n(Watson 1966) has argued that Malebranche conceived representation in\nterms of resemblance, the textual basis for such a claim is rather\ndubious (see Nadler 1992, 46f). More fatally, Reid\u2019s view\nrequires that one conceive of material extension as consisting of a\nsystem of extensionless points, but, like other mathematical objects,\npoints are abstractions or idealizations that do not exist in nature.\nAs Malebranche notes in the Search, \u201cNature is not abstract: the\nlevers and balls of mechanics are not the lines and circles of\nmathematics\u201d (OC 2:277; LO 428). In short, Reid\u2019s view\nworks only if one idealizes material extension, something Malebranche\nrefuses to do.\n\nRecent commentators have developed some of the traditional criticisms\nof the doctrine of Vision in God and proposed new ones of their own.\nThese days many commentators are impressed by the link between\nMalebranchean ideas and logical concepts (e.g., Jolley 1990, McCracken\n1983, Nadler 1992, Pyle 2003). Whereas Cartesian ideas were\npsychological entities or modes of finite minds, Malebranchean ideas\nare abstract, logical entities residing in a third realm (over and\nabove minds and bodies). The virtue of this conception is that it\nexplains how two or more people can be said to be thinking of the same\nabstract object, such as the number \u2018two,\u2019 and how various\nproperties, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, can be said to follow\nlogically from the idea of a right triangle. It also pushes\nMalebranche closer to Frege, Kant, and other more recent philosophical\nheroes, and makes him appear prescient with respect to certain\ninsights characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy.\n\nOn the other hand, it also resurrects with renewed vigor some of the\nproblems considered above. Most notably, if ideas are abstract,\nlogical entities, then they are even more difficult to reconcile with\nMalebranche\u2019s substance-mode ontology. Indeed, one commentator\nhas argued that, to avoid inconsistency, Malebranche ought to have\nmade a clean break with the Cartesian assumption that everything is\neither a substance or a mode in favor of a more\n\u2018trialistic\u2019 view that grants that ideas, qua\nthird realm entities, are sui generis (Jolley 1990, 79). As\nabstract entities, it is also difficult to understand how ideas can\nhave causal powers, in keeping with the doctrine of efficacious ideas,\nor how they can be identical with God\u2019s substance (Jolley 1990,\n76f). In Malebranche\u2019s defense, one might note that the latter\nproblem arises only from regarding ideas as logical entities. Perhaps\nideas in God should not be conceived in this manner (Pepper-Bates\n2005, 93).\n\nAmong recent objections to Vision in God, one of the most important\nconcerns the relation of intelligible extension to sensations. As we\nhave seen, Malebranche draws an important distinction between these\nbut also thinks that sense perception combines elements of each. To\nthe sensory component Malebranche accords a crucial role in explaining\nhow intelligible extension is \u2018particularized\u2019 or\nindividuated, so as to represent a material object in the world.\nSensations of color and light, he says, are \u2018projected\u2019 or\n\u2018painted\u2019 onto intelligible extension as if it were an\nartist\u2019s canvas. The problem, however, is in understanding how\nthese radically disparate entities \u2013 ideas and sensations\n\u2013 can have any commerce with each other. Even if we reject the\nreading that ideas are logical entities, they are nevertheless general\nand pure, and thus different in kind from sensations.\n\nOne proposed solution to this difficulty involves the notion of\n\u2018seeing as\u2019 (see Nolan 2012, 27\u201332).\nMalebranche\u2019s painting analogy is merely a metaphor. Sensations\nof course are not literally painted onto intelligible extension. In\nfact, intelligible extension is not altered by our perception of it\nsince, like all things in God, it is immutable. Rather, we see\nintelligible extension as a particular object, such as a tree\nor a mountain, even though its intrinsic nature is very different.\nThese different ways of perceiving nevertheless qualify as cases of\nseeing intelligible extension because, according to the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas, it causes us to perceive it in these different\nways. In fact, when intelligible extension affects our mind with one\nset of sensations, we see it as a mountain; when it produces another\nset of sensations in us, we see it as a white-winged bird flying\nagainst a blue sky, etc. Malebranche writes:\n\n\nthere need be in God no sensible bodies or real figures in\nintelligible extension in order for us to see them in God or for God\nto see them in Himself. It is enough that His substance, insofar as\nthe corporeal creature can participate in it, should be able to be\nperceived in different ways. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626;\nemphasis added)\n\n\nLater in the same work he adds: \u201cwe see all things in God\nthrough the efficacy of his substance, and particularly sensible\nthings, through God\u2019s applying intelligible extension to our\nmind in a thousand different ways\u201d (OC 3:154, LO 628).\n\nOne attraction of this interpretation is that it also provides a\nsatisfying reply to de Mairan\u2019s objection, considered above,\nthat Malebranche succumbs to Spinozism by ascribing parts to\nintelligible extension. Once again, Malebranche could avail himself of\nthe notion of seeing as: we see intelligible extension as having parts\neven though it lacks real parts because it causes us to do so. Given\nMalebranche\u2019s representationalism, seeing intelligible extension\nin this way explains how we see the material world as divided into\ndiscrete bodies (see Nolan 2012, 35\u201337).\n",
