    "main_text": "Simplifications\n1. Simplifications\n\n\nEpistemology is confusing because there are several sorts of items to\nbe evaluated and several sorts of evaluation. Since the topic of this\narticle is the epistemology of religion not general epistemology it\nwill be assumed that what is being evaluated is something related to\nfaith, namely individual religious beliefs, and that the way of\nevaluating religious beliefs is as justified or unjustified.\nThis entry, therefore, concentrates on questions such as, \u201cIs\nit justified for Fatima to believe in God?\u201d, \u201cIs it\njustified for Richard to believe in the Trinity?\u201d, or \u201cIs\nit justified for Ramanujan to believe that Krishna is a human\nincarnation of the divine?\u201d It ignores such questions as whether\nthese beliefs count as knowledge or whether these beliefs are\nscientific. It also ignores disputes between coherence theorists and\nfoundationalists and disputes over whether belief is\nvoluntary. Although these have some implications for the epistemology\nof religion they are primarily topics in general epistemology.\nAlthough the topic is religious belief the same questions can be\nasked about faith in the absence of belief, where the standards might\nbe more lax. For example John Schellenberg (2009) has argued that it is\nnot justified to believe in a personal God, not justified to have\nfaith in a personal God , not justified even to believe in something\nultimate but it is justified to have a religious attitude of faith in\nsomething ultimate.  Finally, and more controversially, this entry\nconcentrates on Western epistemology of religion, which is not,\nhowever, the same as the epistemology of Western religion. Note,\nthough, that epistemological disputes between Hindu and Buddhist\nphilosophers over a thousand years ago are much the same as those here\nconsidered.\n",
