    "main_text": "The Body Politic\n8. The Body Politic\n\nJohn\u2019s naturalistic conception of cooperative association\ninforms the famous organic analogy that he proposes and develops in\nthe Policraticus. Ascribing his insight to a letter of\ninstruction (John\u2019s creation) purportedly by Plutarch to Emperor\nTrajan, John commences with the simple observation that the\ncommonwealth may be likened to a \u201cbody which is animated\u201d\n(PC: 66; on the history of the controversy about the letter\u2019s\nauthenticity, see Martin 1984: 194\u201396). The different offices of\npolitical society are represented as analogous to the distinct parts\nof the human anatomy. Like all bodies, the commonwealth is guided by a\nsoul, which John assigns to \u201cthose who direct the practice of\nreligion\u201d (PC: 67). Yet, just as the eternal human soul is not\ncoextensive with the mortal physical organism within which it resides,\nthe clerical soul of the polity is not, strictly speaking, a member of\nthe commonwealth (see Nederman 2013). Because the political creature\nis an essentially secular entity, the body politic is ruled by the\nprince, who \u201coccupies the place of the head\u201d (PC: 69).\n(For further discussion of the relationship between the secular body\nand its ecclesiastical soul, see the supplement on\n Princely Tyranny and the Liberty of the Church.)\n\nThe senate, composed of the prince\u2019s counselors, functions as\nthe commonwealth\u2019s heart. The senses correspond to the royal\njudges and local agents who exercise jurisdiction in the king\u2019s\nname. The financial officers constitute the body\u2019s stomach and\nintestines, while the tax-collector and the soldier represent the two\nhands. Finally, John compares the feet to the artisans and peasants\n\u201cwho erect, sustain and move forward the mass of the whole\nbody\u201d (PC: 67). Each part of the organism, according to the\nPolicraticus, has its own definite function, fixed by its\nlocation within the overall scheme of the body. None of the members\nmay be excluded or removed without serious damage to the whole.\n\nJohn\u2019s functional depiction of the community was not, as is\nsometimes supposed, primarily intended to justify hierarchy and\ndivision within society (for a contrary view, see Struve 1984:\n309\u201311). Rather, the body politic found in the\nPolicraticus is the expression of a principle of cooperative\nharmony through which otherwise disparate individuals and interests\nare reconciled and bound together. John adopts a\n\u201cphysiological\u201d approach to the political organism,\naccording to which all of the organs cooperate reciprocally in order\nto achieve a common purpose. The Policraticus insists that\n\u201cthere can be no faithful and firm coherence where there is not\na tenacious unity of wills and a virtual joining together of souls\nthemselves\u201d (PC: 77). Echoing the naturalistic principle\narticulated in the Metalogicon, John posits that all parts of\nthe body must be truly oriented toward and dedicated to a common or\npublic welfare that supersedes the aggregate private goods within the\npolity. The ruler and magistrates are advised to attend \u201cto the\nutility of all\u201d, the feet are counseled \u201cto concentrate on\nthe public utility in all matters\u201d, and in general \u201call\nthe members\u201d are expected to \u201ckeep watch over the public\nadvantage\u201d (PC: 136, 126, 135). The security of the body politic\ncan only be maintained by means of a joint commitment to a public good\nwhich benefits all, so that\n\n\neach individual may be likened to a part of the others reciprocally\nand each believes what is to his own advantage to be determined by\nthat which he recognizes to be most useful for others. (PC: 126)\n\n\nJohn\u2019s political body is one in which, beyond all social\ndifferentiation, there is \u201cmutual charity reigning\neverywhere\u201d, because all segments are attuned to the same\nenduring common purpose that encompasses the valid interests of the\nwhole (PC: 142). Unity follows from cooperation, and cooperation stems\nfrom the existence of a good shared by the entire community and each\nof its members.\n\nFollowing from his use of a physiological model of social\norganization, John identifies maintenance of the \u2018health\u2019\nof the body politic as necessary to ensuring a cooperative spirit and\navoiding fragmentation. For John, the political body\u2019s health\ndepends on the practice of justice by the organs and members. This\nassociation between the common good and justice entails a correlative\nobligation on the part of all members of the commonwealth:\n\n\nInasmuch as the duties of each individual are practiced so that\nprovision is made for the corporate community, as long as justice is\npracticed, the ends of all are imbued with the sweetness of honey.\n(PC: 131)\n\n\nEvery organ and limb must conduct itself according to the dictates of\njustice if the polity is to exist as a corporate whole. John\u2019s\nconception of justice follows the Ciceronian duality (Cicero De\nofficiis: I.7.23) of negative obligation and positive duty:\n\n\nJustice consists chiefly in this: do not do harm and prevent the doing\nof harm out of duty to humanity. When you do harm, you assent to\ninjury. When you do not impede the doing of harm, you are a servant of\ninjustice. (PC: 62)\n\n\nBecause justice is inherently productive of social cooperation,\nwhereas injustice necessarily tends to disharmony and social\ndisintegration, John construes justice as both a generalized virtue\nand the guarantor of the body\u2019s health. Since justice is the\nsalient characteristic of the common good, it determines the manner in\nwhich each bodily member performs its functions. Not only kings and\nmagistrates, but even the lowliest of parts, are viewed by John as\npotential agents of public justice (see Nederman 1997), reinforced by\nthe fact that the function of each is absolutely necessary for the\nwell-being of all. The wide diffusion of responsibility for the\nmaintenance of justice assures that all members of the body politic\npossess the basic faculties necessary for guarding and protecting the\ncommon good.\n\nJohn is willing, under exceptional circumstances, to extend this\ndiscretion to direct political action against evil rulers. He\ndescribes two circumstances that warrant public concern: the\ncommission by rulers of minor offenses, which can be tolerated by the\ncommunity, and of flagrant crimes, which endanger the well-being of\nthe body politic (PC: 140\u201341). In the first instance, citizens\nshould express their disapproval and recommend corrective measures,\nbut should not challenge the king\u2019s position. In the second\ncase, when the common good and religion are threatened by a tyrant,\nmembers of the political organism ought\u2014indeed, are bound by the\nfunctionalist terms of the political order\u2014to take action to\ndeflect injury to the body. This claim forms the basis for\nJohn\u2019s controversial doctrine of tyrannicide. Scholars have\ndebated whether these remarks amount to a theory of tyrant-killing or\nmerely an account of the bad endings that have come to all tyrants\n(Van Laarhoven 1984; Nederman 1988). John\u2019s seemingly\ncontradictory claim that tyrants are both the servants of God and\nassured of divine punishment (PC: 201\u201302) finds resolution\nthrough numerous historical examples of the destruction of tyrannical\nrulers once their ordained purpose has been achieved.\n\nYet, as elsewhere in John\u2019s writings, this religious dimension\nof tyrannicide is paralleled by a philosophical justification that\ndepends on reason alone. Because John considers tyranny to be a crime\nagainst \u201cthe body of justice itself\u201d (PC: 25), he invokes\nthe organic nature of the community to explain the legitimacy, albeit\nrare, of tyrannicide. Inasmuch as one enjoys membership in the\npolitical community, one may ultimately be responsible\u2014based on\neach part\u2019s duty to see justice served in the whole\u2014for\neradicating the incorrigible tyrant. John does not believe that such\naction should be undertaken lightly, specifying a set of conditions\nthat must be met prior to eliminating a tyrant (PC: 209; see\n207\u201309 for the paradigmatic proper tyrannicide). Following from\nhis naturalistic paradigm, John asserts that \u201cwhoever does not\nprosecute [the tyrant] transgresses against himself and against the\nwhole body of the secular republic\u201d (PC: 25). Note that slaying\na tyrant, under the caveats John specifies, falls within the general\nobligation on the part of every member of the political body, without\ndistinction, to pursue justice. Since the health of each depends upon\nthe health of all, John posits a strong link between the organic\nnature of social and political order and the widespread public defense\nof that order, extending even to the act of removing a tyrant (on\nJohn\u2019s use of medical metaphors, see Shogimen and Nederman\n2011).\n",
