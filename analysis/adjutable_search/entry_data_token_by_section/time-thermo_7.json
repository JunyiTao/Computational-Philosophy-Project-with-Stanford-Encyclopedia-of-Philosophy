    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time II || The Thermodynamic Reduction\n3.1 The Thermodynamic Reduction\n\nInspired by Boltzmann\u2019s attempts in this regard, many\nphilosophers have sought such reductions, either partial or total.\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1973) and Smart (1967) develop entropic accounts of the\nknowledge asymmetry. Lewis (1979) suspects the asymmetry of traces is\nlinked to the thermodynamic arrow but provides no specifics. Dowe\n(1992), like a few others, ties the direction of causation to the\nentropy gradient. And some have also tied the psychological arrow to\nthis gradient (for a discussion see Kroes 1985). Perhaps the most\nambitious attempts at grounding many arrows all at once can be found\nin Reichenbach 1956, Horwich 1987, and Albert 2000, 2015. Each of\nthese books offers possible thermodynamic explanations for the causal\nand epistemic arrows, as well as many subsidiary arrows.\n\nA straightforward reduction of these arrows to entropy is probably not\nin the cards (Earman 1974; Horwich 1987). Consider the epistemic arrow\nof time. The traditional entropic account claimed that because we know\nthere are many more entropy-increasing rather than entropy-decreasing\nsystems in the world (or our part of it), we can infer when we see a\nlow-entropy system that it was preceded and caused by an interaction\nwith something outside the system. To take the canonical example,\nimagine you are walking on the beach and come across a footprint in\nthe sand. You can infer that earlier someone walked by (in contrast to\nit arising as a random fluctuation). In other words, you infer, due to\nits high order, that it was caused by something previously also of\nhigh (or higher) order, i.e, someone walking.\n\nHowever, the entropic account faces some very severe challenges.\nFirst, do footprints on beaches have well-defined thermodynamic\nentropies? To describe the example we switched from low-entropy to\nhigh order, but the association between entropy and our ordinary\nconcept of order is tenuous at best and usually completely misleading.\n(To appreciate this, just consider what happens to your salad dressing\nafter it is left undisturbed. Order increases when the oil and vinegar\nseparate, yet entropy has increased.) To describe the range of systems\nabout which we have knowledge, the account needs something broader\nthan the thermodynamic entropy. But what? Reichenbach is forced to\nmove to a notion of quasi-entropy, losing the reduction in the\nprocess. Second, the entropic account doesn\u2019t license the\ninference to a human being walking on the beach. All it tells you is\nthat the grains of sand in the footprint interacted with its\nenvironment previously, which barely scratches the surface of our\nability to tell detailed stories about what happened in the past.\nThird, even if we entertain a broader understanding of entropy, it\nstill doesn\u2019t always work. Consider Earman\u2019s (1974)\nexample of a bomb destroying a city. From the destruction we may infer\nthat a bomb went off; yet the bombed city does not have lower entropy\nthan its surroundings or even any type of intuitively higher order\nthan its surroundings.\n",
