    "main_text": "\n\nOrdinary English contains different forms of quantification over\nobjects. In addition to the usual singular quantification, as\nin\n\n(1)\nThere is an apple on the table\n\n\nthere is plural quantification, as in \n\n(2)\nThere are some apples on the table.\n\n\nEver since Frege, formal logic has favored the two singular\nquantifiers \\(\\forall{x}\\) and \\(\\exists{x}\\) over their plural\ncounterparts \\(\\forall{xx}\\) and \\(\\exists{xx}\\) (to be read as\nfor any things \\(xx\\) and there are some things\n\\(xx)\\). But in recent decades it has been argued that we have good\nreason to admit among our primitive logical notions also the plural\nquantifiers \\(\\forall{xx}\\) and \\(\\exists{xx}\\) (Boolos 1984 and\n1985a). \n\nMore controversially, it has been argued that the resulting formal\nsystem with plural as well as singular quantification qualifies as\n\u201cpure logic\u201d; in particular, that it is universally\napplicable, ontologically innocent, and perfectly well understood. In\naddition to being interesting in its own right, this thesis will, if\ncorrect, make plural quantification available as an innocent but\nextremely powerful tool in metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics, and\nphilosophical logic. For instance, George Boolos has used plural\nquantification to interpret monadic second-order\n logic[1]\n and has argued on this basis that monadic second-order logic\nqualifies as \u201cpure logic\u201d. Plural quantification has also\nbeen used in attempts to defend logicist ideas, to account for set\ntheory, and to eliminate ontological commitments to mathematical\nobjects and complex objects.\n",
