    "main_text": "\n\nMichel Henry (1922\u20132002) developed a radically revised approach\nto phenomenology through a critical reading of the phenomenological\ntradition (especially of Husserl and Heidegger).  Henry named his\napproach \u201cphenomenology of life\u201d and, before that,\n\u201cmaterial phenomenology\u201d or \u201cradical\nphenomenology\u201d. He was, in part, influenced by the work of Maine\nde Biran. Perhaps the most characteristic, as well as most\ncontroversial, feature of Henry\u2019s phenomenology of life is that\nit grounds intentionality in a pre-intentional form of appearing,\nnamely immanent affectivity or \u201clife\u201d. In the last period\nof his work (1992\u20132002), Henry developed a philosophy of\nreligion and Christianity based on his phenomenology. He is widely\nrecognized as one of the major figures of 20th-century\nFrench phenomenology.\n",
