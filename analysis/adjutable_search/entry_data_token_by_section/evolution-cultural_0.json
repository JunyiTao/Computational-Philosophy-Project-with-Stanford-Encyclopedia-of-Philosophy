    "main_text": "Natural Selection and Culture\n1. Natural Selection and Culture\n\nDarwin believed, as do biologists today, that natural selection can\nexplain the origin of many complex adaptive traits. In Darwin\u2019s\noriginal presentation of natural selection, he requires that parent\norganisms differ in their abilities to survive and reproduce, and that\noffspring resemble their parents in terms of the traits that promote\nor inhibit these abilities (Darwin 1859).\n\nAs many have noted\u2014including Darwin\u2014this explanatory\nschema does not specify what mechanism accounts for parent-offspring\nresemblance. For example, offspring might learn skills from their\nparents, and thereby come to resemble them behaviorally. From the\nperspective of natural selection explanations, it does not matter why\noffspring resemble parents, only that they do resemble them. What is\nmore, the general schema associated with natural selection\nexplanations does not even require a population of reproducing\norganisms: it applies under any circumstances where entities in one\ngeneration give rise to resembling entities in a subsequent\ngeneration. In this sense, it is substrate-neutral.\n\nDarwin himself explicitly espouses the view that natural selection can\nact on entities other than organisms in the context of the cultural\nphenomenon of language change. This position is briefly explored in\nthe Origin of Species, and further expanded in the\nDescent of Man. In this latter work, he endorses the opinion\nof Max M\u00fcller:\n\n\n\u201cA struggle for life is constantly going on amongst the words\nand grammatical forms in each language. The better, the shorter, the\neasier forms are constantly gaining the upper hand, and they owe their\nsuccess to their own inherent virtue\u201d. (Darwin 1871: 60 [1877:\n91], paraphrasing M\u00fcller 1870: 257)\n\n\nDarwin asserts that this is no mere metaphor or loose analogy:\n\u201cThe survival or preservation of certain favoured words in the\nstruggle for existence is natural selection\u201d (1870: 60\u201361\n[1877: 91]).\n\nThe pursuit of the cultural evolutionary project does not stand or\nfall with M\u00fcller\u2019s thought that there are close affinities\nbetween processes of cultural change and the sorts of\nprocesses\u2014of which natural selection is an example\u2014that\nshape the organic world. Successful approaches can instead explore, in\nwhatever ways seem best for the task at hand, how learning makes a\ndifference to how species change and adapt over time. Nonetheless, as\na matter of fact, many cultural evolutionary theorists have made use\nof explanatory concepts and models adapted from mainstream\nevolutionary theory, and they have often justified this by arguing for\nimportant isomorphisms between the domain of biology and the domain of\nculture. Mesoudi (2011; Mesoudi, Whiten, & Laland 2006) is a\nuseful case-in-point, identifying not just \u201ckey Darwinian\nproperties\u201d of variation, heritability, and selection, but also\npointing to disciplinary analogies between the study of cultural and\nbiological change.\n\nOf course, drawing analogies between cultural change and biological\nevolution far from settles philosophical questions about cultural\nevolution (see the discussion of analogical models in the entry\n models in science).\n Many cultural evolutionary terms evade rigorous and exhaustive\nexplication. \u201cCulture\u201d, \u201ctransmission\u201d, even\n\u201cevolution\u201d merely gesture towards complex phenomena. This\nprovides latitude for researchers to fill in the analogical details\nbetween culture and biology in different ways (Sereno 1991; Stanley\n2021). What, for instance, is the \u201cculture\u201d that evolves?\nWhat does it mean to evolve? And what mechanisms are involved? We\naddress these questions in subsequent sections.\n",
