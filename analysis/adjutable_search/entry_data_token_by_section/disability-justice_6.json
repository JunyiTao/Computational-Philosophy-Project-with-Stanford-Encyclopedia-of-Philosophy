    "main_text": "Disability in Contemporary Theories of Justice || The Appropriate Metric for Distributive Justice\n4.3 The Appropriate Metric for Distributive Justice\n\nThe implications of outcome-oriented theories for disability depend on\ntwo features of those theories. The first is the metric, or\n\u201ccurrency\u201d of justice they adopt\u2014welfare, resources,\nprimary goods, or capabilities. The second is the distributive\nstandard they impose\u2014strict equality, priority for the worse\noff, or merely some minimum for everyone (sufficientarianism). We will\nconsider these two features in order, although they are sometimes\nintertwined.\n\nRawls and other social contract theorists adopted a broad outcome\nmetric for assessing the comparative advantage of the individual in a\nsociety: \u201csocial primary goods\u201d, which include\nopportunities, basic liberties, income, and the social bases of\nself-respect. This breadth is intended to achieve neutrality between\ncompeting substantive conceptions of the good, since the social\nprimary goods are construed as \u201call-purpose means\u201d that\nare valuable to have irrespective of the content of one\u2019s\nparticular conception of the good. For many disability scholars, the\ndifficulty in this approach does not concern its neutrality, but its\nfailure to take account of the environment in which those goods must\nbe utilized, which may profoundly affect their value to those\nreceiving them. Two persons might be alike in their share of social\nprimary goods, and have similar projects, aims, commitments, and\nvalues, but nonetheless differ in the value they can derive from those\ngoods, if one person is disabled and the other is not. As we shall see\nbelow, the capabilities approach takes into account this objection,\nwhen the difference between the uses to which each person can put her\nprimary goods is construed as the result of differences in\n\u201cinternal resources\u201d, or the rate at which the individual\ncan convert resources to \u201cfunctionings\u201d.\n\nA failure to take adequate account of the environment may also be\nfound in directly-egalitarian resource-based approaches. Dworkin\n(1981a,b), for example, appears to take the social environment for\ngranted in proposing a hypothetical division of resources into\nindividual bundles. Giving people with impairments equal material\nshares in a society like our own would hardly satisfy the demands of\nequality in a physical and social environment designed exclusively for\npeople with standard endowments. Dworkin is aware of the problem, but\nhis solution is to adjust individual shares to include insurance\npayouts against poor environmental fit, rather than to redesign the\nenvironment to reduce inequalities in fit. To that degree, Dworkin\nappears to tacitly assume a medical model of disability, according to\nwhich limitations resulting from impairments are solely attributable\nto the impairment itself, and, if not correctable, compensable only by\nthe redistribution of resources to people with such impairments. Such\ncompensation may ensure survival, but it does little to enhance or\nequalize participation, and may in fact hinder participation if\nAnderson (1999) is right that compensating for disabilities expresses\ndisrespect. Moreover, the size of the insurance payout for a given\ndisability is determined by the amount by which able-bodied people\nwould be willing to insure themselves against the prospect of\nincurring that disability. Insofar as the judgments of able-bodied\npeople don\u2019t always track the intuitively relevant facts about\ndisability-related disadvantage, such an approach threatens to\n\u201cbake in\u201d flawed assumptions about the experience of\ndisability into its account of just entitlements for people with\ndisabilities (Bodenheimer 1997a,b).\n\nSeveral alternatives for assessing outcomes for purposes of political\nand social equality seem more responsive to the disabling role of the\nsocial environment. The most familiar and influential of these\nalternatives is the capabilities approach, developed in different ways\nby Martha Nussbaum (2006a) and Amartya Sen (1980). Their accounts are concerned\nnot only with the resources an individual has but also with what she\ncan do with them; with her \u201ccapability\u201d of engaging in a\nnumber of valuable \u201cfunctionings\u201d, such as forming\nintimate relationships and having rich sensory and aesthetic\nexperiences.\n\nNussbaum\u2019s earlier formulations of the capabilities placed\nconsiderable emphasis on species-typical functioning. For example, she\ninitially treated \u201cthe exercise of the five senses\u201d as a\nnecessary constituent of human flourishing. More recent formulations\nare more congenial to social models of disability, in part because of\nNussbaum\u2019s encounter with disability scholarship. She now makes\nroom for the social contribution to \u201cnatural\u201d deficits\n(see Wasserman 1998; Terzi 2009), recognizing that most capabilities\nbear only a contingent, environmentally-mediated relationship to\npeople\u2019s \u201cnatural endowment\u201d. She abstracts from\ndifferences between people with impaired and normal limb function to\nfind a common claim to the means of moving about from place to place.\nSuch means may be architectural, vehicular, mechanical, or prosthetic;\nthey may involve making places more accessible or making the\nindividual more mobile. Similarly, a person lacking sight or hearing\ncan achieve aesthetic satisfaction by other means; a person with\nintellectual impairments can participate in activities structured to\ninclude individuals of varying cognitive skills. An individual with\nemphysema could increase his capacity for affiliation and control over\nthe material environment (two capabilities from Nussbaum\u2019s\n2006a list) not only by\nmeasures to increase his lung capacity but also by measures to\nincrease his access to social and business venues through better\ntransit and architectural design.\n\nNussbaum\u2019s broader framing enables her to recognize the\nprospects for flourishing of people with severe impairments. The\nplausibility of the capabilities approach for disability critics of\ndistributive accounts lies in the way the capabilities are\nindividuated. A basis for individuation might be found in a\ncomprehensive account of human nature and human flourishing, such as\nthe Aristotelian account that informs Nussbaum\u2019s work. As Becker\nnotes, however, such a comprehensive account would have limited appeal\nin justifying a distributive scheme in a pluralistic society (2005:\n35). Despite its promise, considerably more work is needed to clarify\nher approach. Another feature of Nussbaum\u2019s theory that some\ndisability theorists find congenial is her incorporation of\nrecognition and respect into her set of basic capabilities. Thus, the\ncapability for \u201caffiliation\u201d encompasses not only\nintimacy, but self-respect and dignity; the capability for\n\u201ccontrol over the environment\u201d includes both the material\nand political environments.\n\nLess ambitiously than Nussbaum, Jonathan Wolff (2009b) classifies\nequality-enhancing measures for people with disabilities by the extent\nto which they address recognition as well as redistribution. Thus, the\nindividual limitations of people with disabilities can be addressed\nwith either cash compensation or \u201cpersonal enhancement\u201d,\nmedical, surgical, or rehabilitative measures to correct those\nlimitations. \u201cTargeted resource enhancement\u201d offers an\nintermediate option, which tries to improve the fit of the individual\nand the environment with a range of restricted resources such as\npersonal assistance and assistive technology. Finally, \u201cstatus\nenhancement\u201d alters the built environment and social practices\nto reduce the impact of individual differences in abilities on social\nequality. Wolff generally favors status enhancement as the most\nrespectful intervention, because it shapes the environment to the\nneeds of all members of society. It is also the most stable\nintervention, because it protects the social equality against sudden\nchanges in individuals\u2019 levels of functioning.\n\nAlthough Wolff does not adopt the device of hypothetical decision\nmaking to justify a preference for status enhancement, that preference\ncould be underwritten by a suitably modified Original Position. As\nRichardson (2006) suggests, hypothetical decision makers who know that\nthey may represent individuals with severe impairments are more likely\nto be concerned with capabilities than with primary goods, since the\nlatter by themselves may be of limited value to those they represent.\nFurther, those decision makers would recognize that capabilities often\ncan be increased more respectfully, as well as more effectively, by\nstatus enhancements than by other measures.\n\nYet doubts remain about the extent to which concerns about\nrecognition, respect, and social equality can be captured in any\noutcome metric of individual well-being, however broad. Thus,\nChristian Schemmel (2012) argues that the treatment of people as\nequals must be understood in terms of respectful relationships among\nindividuals and institutions, and that the presence of such\nrelationships cannot plausibly be regarded in what Pogge (2004a,b)\ncalls \u201crecipient-oriented\u201d terms, as components of\nindividual well-being. The moral significance of respectful treatment\nis neither exhausted by, nor derivative of, its contribution to\nindividual well-being. As Schemmel argues (2012: 19), people may need\nsome forms of affiliation to flourish but do not necessarily require\nsocial and political equality for their own well-being. The\nplausibility of these claims depends to some extent on how narrow or\nbroad a conception of well-being one adopts. A conception that\nencompasses virtually all that a person has reason to care about will\nmore easily accommodate social equality and respectful\nrelationships.\n",
