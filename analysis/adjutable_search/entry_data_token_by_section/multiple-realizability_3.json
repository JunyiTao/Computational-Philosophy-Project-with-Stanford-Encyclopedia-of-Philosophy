    "main_text": "Multiple Realizability Arguments || The Multiple Realizability Argument from Psychological Explanations\n1.4 The Multiple Realizability Argument from Psychological Explanations\n\nPsychologist Zenon Pylyshyn (1984) appeals to multiple realizability\nto ground a methodological criticism of reductionism about psychology.\nHe describes a pedestrian (in the U.S., say), having just witnessed an\nautomobile accident, rushing into a nearby phone booth and dialing a 9\nand a 1.  (For readers unfamiliar with phone booths, suppose instead\nthat he pulls out his cell phone and punches those numbers.) What will\nthis person do next? With very high probability, he will dial (push)\nanother 1. Why? Because in the U.S., 911 is the universal emergency\nnumber and there is a systematic generalization holding between the\nevent he witnessed, his background knowledge, resulting intentions,\nand that subsequent action (all intentionally described).\n\nWe won\u2019t discover that generalization, however, if we focus on\nthe person\u2019s neurophysiology and resulting muscular\ncontractions. That level of explanation logically is too weak, for it\ncannot tell us that the prior sequence of neural events and muscular\ncontractions will lead to the subsequent action of dialing another 1.\nA physiological explanation for any given instance will only link one\nway of learning the emergency phone number to one way of coming to\nknow that an emergency occurred to one sequence of neural events and\nresulting muscular contractions producing the behavior\n(nonintentionally described). However, the number of physical events\nconstituting each of these cognitive classes\u2014the learning, the\ncoming to know, and the action of dialing\u2014is potentially\nunlimited, with the constituents of each class often unrelated to each\nother at the physiological level of description. (This is\nPylyshyn\u2019s appeal to multiple realizability.) So if there is a\ngeneralization at the higher level of description available for\ncapturing\u2014and in the example sketched above, surely there\nis\u2014an exclusively reductionist approach to psychological\nexplanation will miss it. Thus because of multiple realizability,\nreductionism violates a tenet of scientific methodology: seek to\ncapture all capturable generalizations. Such methodological arguments\ndid not end with Pylyshyn\u2019s. Fodor (1975: Chapter 5) and Terence\nHorgan (1993) raise related methodological caveats about reductionism\nbased on multiple realizability. Bickle (1998: Chapter 4) responds\ndirectly to these.\n",
