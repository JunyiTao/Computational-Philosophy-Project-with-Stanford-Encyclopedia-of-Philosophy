    "main_text": "The Principles\n5. The Passions\n\nIn 1646, as a result of the probings of Princess Elisabeth, Descartes\ncompleted a working draft of Passions de l\u2019ame\n(Passions of the Soul). During this year another prominent\npolitical figure began to correspond with Descartes, Queen Christina\nof Sweden. And, Regius published what he took to be a new and improved\nversion of Cartesian science, which as we now know would draw the\nwrath of Voetius. But Regius did not stop there, for he seemed to have\nfound important differences between his \u201cCartesian\u201d view\nand that of Descartes\u2019, and attempted to separate the two,\npublishing a broadsheet that listed twenty-one anti-Cartesian theses\n(which his version of \u201cCartesian\u201d science rejected). In\nresponse to this, Descartes wrote a single-page printed defense that\nwas posted on public kiosks for all to read. Published in 1648, the\nNotae in Programma Quoddam (Notes on a Program-also\nreferred to as Comments on a Certain Broadsheet) is\nDescartes\u2019 public defense. However, as mentioned earlier,\ntensions mounted as a result of the public exchange and Descartes felt\nhis way of life in the Netherlands to be threatened. As luck would\nhave it, an admirer and friend of Descartes\u2019\u2014Chanut, who\nworked for Queen Christina\u2019s court\u2014and Queen Christina\nherself began probing Descartes about the possibility of coming to\nSweden. And, after a not too lengthy correspondence, Queen Christina\noffered Descartes a position in her court. For many reasons, which\nwould certanily include those related to his concerns about Voetius,\nDescartes accepted the offer. And, in 1649 he left for Sweden. \n\nQueen Christina at first required very little from Descartes. However,\naccording to Gaukroger, this would change. For, after he had some time\nto settle in, she ordered him to do two things: first, to put all of\nhis papers in order, and secondly, to put together designs for an\nacademy (Gaukroger, p. 415). Arguably, Descartes had some idea of how\nthe latter might be done by way of his experience in Breda. In January\nof 1650 Queen Christina began to require Descartes to give her lessons\nin philosophy. These apparently would begin at five in the morning and\nwould last for about five hours. They were given three days a week\n(Gaukroger, p. 415). During this time Descartes published the\nPassions, the work having emerged primarily from his\ncorrespondence with Princess Elisabeth (to whom he had dedicated the\nPrinciples). One aim of the Passions was to explain\nhow the emotional (and thus moral) life of a human being was connected\nto the soul\u2019s being essentially united to a body. Simply put, a\n\u2019passion of the soul\u2019 is a mental state (or thought) that\narises as a direct result of brain activity. Such passions can move us\nto action. Since this is so, Descartes suggests that one needs to\nlearn to control one\u2019s passions, for they can move one to\nperform vicious acts. Critics of Descartes, including Elisabeth,\nargued that Descartes\u2019 metaphysical commitments put real\npressure on the view expounded in the Passions. For,\naccording to Descartes\u2019 metaphysics, the nature of mind is to\nthink and the nature of body is to be extended in length, breadth, and\ndepth. One view concerning causation, a view that Descartes\u2019s\ncritics seemed to have attributed to him, is that one thing causes\nanother to move, for example, by way of contact. Contact, in this\ncontext, seems to be possible only by way of surfaces. Now, bodies,\nsince they are extended and thus have surfaces, can come into contact\nwith one another and thus can cause one another to move. However, if\nminds are not extended, they lack surfaces. And, if they lack\nsurfaces, there is no way in principle for bodies to come into contact\nwith them. Thus, there is no way in principle for bodies to move\nminds, and vice versa. That is, minds and bodies cannot in principle\ncausally interact. And so, if the view expounded in the\nPassions requires that bodies and minds be capable of causal\ninteraction, and Descartes\u2019 metaphysical commitments make such\ninteraction impossible, Descartes\u2019 metaphysics puts a great deal\nof pressure on the view expounded in the Passions.\n\nAlthough things seemed to be moving forward, they were not going as\nwell as one would have hoped. In a letter to Bregy, for instance,\ndated 15 January 1650, Descartes expresses reservations about his\ndecision to come to Sweden. He sees himself to be \u201cout of his\nelement,\u201d the winter so harsh that \u201cmen\u2019s thoughts\nare frozen here, like the water\u201d (AT V 467; CSMK III 383). Given\nthe sentiment expressed in the letter, this remark was probably\nintended to be as much Descartes\u2019s take on the intellectual\nclimate as it was about the weather. In early February, less than a\nmonth after writing Bregy, Descartes fell ill. His illness quickly\nturned into a serious respiratory infection. And, although at the end\nof a week he appeared to have made some movement towards recovery,\nthings took a turn for the worse and he died in the early morning of\n11 February 1650. He was fifty-three years old.\n",
