Rawls on Public Reason and Public Rules\nHaving looked at both hypothetical publicity and actual publicity, let us now turn to examine the place of publicity within the political philosophy of John Rawls. We shall analyze two distinct conceptions of publicity that arise in his writings. The first relates to the doctrine of public reason. The second relates to the doctrine of public rules. Though we begin with some remarks about public reason, we shall focus predominantly on public rules, as this idea is less familiar.\n",
