    "main_text": "Diagrams as Representational Systems || Diagrams as formal systems\n2.4 Diagrams as formal systems\n\nShin\n (1994)\n follows up Peirce\u2019s work in two directions. One is to improve\nPeirce\u2019s version of Venn diagrams, and the other is to prove the\nsoundness and the completeness of this revised system.\n\nShin\u2019s work alters Peirce\u2019s modifications of Venn diagrams\nto achieve an increase in expressive power without such a severe loss\nof visual clarity. This revision is made in two stages: (i) Venn-I:\nretains Venn\u2019s shadings (for emptiness), Peirce\u2019s\n\u2018x\u2019 (for existential import) and Peirce\u2019s connecting\nline between \u2018x\u2019s (for disjunctive information). (ii)\nVenn-II: This system, which is proven to be logically equivalent to\nmonadic predicate logic, is the same as Venn-I except that a\nconnecting line between diagrams is newly introduced to display\ndisjunctive information.\n\nReturning to one of Euler\u2019s examples we will see the contrast\namong these different versions clearly:\n\nExample 3. No A is B. Some\nC is A. Therefore, Some C is not\nB.\n\n\nEuler admits that no single Euler diagram can be drawn to represent\nthe premises, but that three possible cases must be drawn.\nVenn\u2019s system is silent about existential statements. Now,\nPeirce\u2019s and Shin\u2019s systems represent these two premises\nin a single diagram as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Shin\u2019s diagram, Venn\u2019s shading convention\nfor emptiness, as opposed to Peirce\u2019s \u2018o\u2019, much more\nnaturally leads the reader to the inference \u201cSome C is\nnot B\u201d than in the case of Peirce\u2019s diagram.\n\nHowever, Venn-I cannot express disjunctive information between\nuniversal statements or between universal and existential statements.\nRetaining Venn-I\u2019s expressive power, Venn-II allows diagrams to\nbe connected by a line. Peirce\u2019s confusing looking diagram above\nis equivalent to the following Venn-II diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this revision, Shin\n (1994)\n presented each of these two systems as a standard formal\nrepresentation system equipped with its own syntax and semantics. The\nsyntax tells us which diagrams are acceptable, that is, which are\nwell-formed, and which manipulations are permissible in each system.\nThe semantics defines logical consequences among diagrams. Using these\ntools, it is proven that the systems are sound and complete, in the\nsame sense that some symbolic logics are.\n\nThis approach has posed a fundamental challenge to some of the\nassumptions held about representation systems. Since the development\nof modern logic, important concepts, e.g., syntax, semantics,\ninference, logical consequence, validity, and completeness, have been\napplied to sentential representation systems only. However, none of\nthese turned out to be intrinsic to these traditional symbolic logics\nonly. For any representation system, whether it is sentential\nor diagrammatic, we can discuss two levels, a syntactic and a semantic\nlevel. What inference rules tell us is how to manipulate a given unit,\nwhether symbolic or diagrammatic, to another. The definition of\nlogical consequence is also free from any specific form of a\nrepresentation system. The same argument goes for the soundness and\nthe completeness proofs. When a system is proven to be sound, we\nshould be able to adopt it in proofs. In fact, much current research\nexplores the use of diagrams in automated theorem proving (see\nBarker-Plummer & Bailin\n 1997;\n and Jamnik et al.\n 1999).\n",
