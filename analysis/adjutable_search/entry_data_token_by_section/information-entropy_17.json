The increasingly explicit models developed by workers\nsuch as Bennett, Fredkin and Toffoli have now generally been considered\nto have established that thermodynamically reversible computation is\nindeed possible, if implemented by logically reversible computers.\n\n\nRecent criticisms (Shenker 2000 [in Other Internet Resources], Norton\n2005) focussed upon whether heat generation must necessarily be\nassociated with logically irreversible operations. A particular\nobjection raised by Shenker and a similar objection by Norton,\nconcerned the use of probability distributions over macroscopically\ndistinct states. Both Shenker and Norton argued that the thermodynamic\nentropy of a system is only properly defined by considering the region\nof state space accessible to the given microstate. For physical\nrepresentations of logical states it is essential that the physical\nsystem cannot jump from one logical state to another. Consequently,\nregions of state space corresponding to different logical states are\nnot accessible to one another, or as Shenker referred to it, they are\nnot interaccessible. In Landauer's original paper, he simply\nidentified the p\u2009ln\u2009p term of the\nprobability distribution over the distinct logical states with\nthermodynamic entropy. More developed Gibbsian approaches still\ncalculate the Gibbs entropy of a statistical distribution over regions\nof state space which are not interaccessible.  Norton argued in detail\nthat this is an illegitimate calculation, and that the resulting\nentropy has nothing to do with thermodynamic entropy.\n\n\nThe objection extends far beyond the scope of Landauer's principle.\nIt shares much with general Boltzmannian arguments against the Gibbs\napproach to statistical mechanics. However, it is questionable whether\nproofs following the approach of Piechocinska are genuinely vulnerable\nto the accusation. Piechocinska did not, in fact, attribute a\nthermodynamic entropy to the Gibbs entropy measure (entropy was barely\neven mentioned in her paper) nor, contrary to some criticisms, did she\nassume a specific model of how the reset operation is performed, at\nleast in the quantum case. The assumption that generates the\nlogarithmic form of Landauer's principle is that heat baths are\ninitially canonically distributed (an assumption which Norton, at\nleast, appeared willing to concede) combined with the requirement that\na single Hamiltonian (or unitary, in the case of quantum theory)\ndynamics is used to describe the combined evolution of the system and\nenvironment, independantly of the input logical state. Similar comments\nmay be made about (Maroney 2009), while (Turgut 2009) managed to go\nfurther and deduce a stronger constraint, which implies the usual\nversion of Landauer's principle, but without even needing to consider\nprobability distributions over the input logical states.\n\n\nA more concrete counterexample is that of Allahverdyan and\nNieuwenhuizen (2001), where they argued it is possible to effect an\nerasure process with a lower cost than Landauer's principle suggests,\nbut only in the low temperature quantum regime. A typical assumption in\nstatistical mechanical proofs is that the interaction energy between a\nsystem and a heat bath can be treated as negligible (at least before\nthe start and after the end of the process). Allahverdyan and\nNieuwenhuizen's example exploits this by considering situations where\nthe temperature is sufficiently low that the interaction energy can no\nlonger be treated as negligible when compared to\nkT. In this situation the heat bath can no longer be\ntreated as a canonical distribution, independently of the system and\nthe standard proofs do not hold. It should be noted that while Zhang\nand Zhang's non-Hamiltonian demon is not considered actually\nphysically possible, Allahverdyan and Nieuwenhuizen explicitly claimed\nthat in the low temperature regime, Landauer's principle can, in fact,\nbe broken.\n",
