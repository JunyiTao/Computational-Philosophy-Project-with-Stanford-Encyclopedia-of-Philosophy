    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of computer science is concerned with the ontological\nand methodological issues arising from within the academic discipline\nof computer science, and from the practice of software development and\nits commercial and industrial deployment. More specifically, the\nphilosophy of computer science considers the ontology and epistemology\nof computational systems, focusing on problems associated with their\nspecification, programming, implementation, verification and testing.\nThe complex nature of computer programs\u00a0ensures that many of the\nconceptual questions raised by the philosophy of computer science have\nrelated ones in the\n philosophy of mathematics,\n the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the\n philosophy of technology.\n We shall provide an analysis of such topics that reflects the layered\nnature of the ontology of computational systems in Sections 1\u20135;\nwe then discuss topics involved in their methodology in Sections\n6\u20138.\n",
