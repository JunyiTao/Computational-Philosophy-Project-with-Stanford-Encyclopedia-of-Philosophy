    "main_text": "Historical Outline || The Delineation of Logical Traditions\n1.6 The Delineation of Logical Traditions\nAfter 1350 or so, logical traditions began to crystallise, often on\na regional basis. Recent studies by El-Rouayheb (2010b) and Ahmed\n(2012) have provided preliminary sketches of the seven or so centuries\nof logical activity. Especially El-Rouayheb (2010b) makes it clear\nthat we cannot assume that there is a point at which original work\nstops and the tradition begins simply to restate ancient results. It\nis true that much of the later material is, unlike the bulk of the\nthirteenth-century material, presented as commentary. There is a\ntemptation to conclude from this that there was a decline in logical\nstudies in the realms under Muslim control that corresponds with the\nsixteenth-century decline of the subject in early modern Europe; such\na conclusion is seemingly supported by a tradition of scholarship\ndevoted to a luxuriation of layered commentary on a five hundred year\nold primary text. But genre by no means dictates content, and we often\nfind original work presented in this\n way.[16]\nRegionalism had been a significant factor especially in the\ntradition of logic studied in al-Andalus; more generally, the\ncrystallisation of traditions after Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee also tended to\nbe regional. Although Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee was read in North Africa, it\nwould seem that the Maragha logicians were not read there, at least\nnot systematically. By contrast, Averroes was still read and taught in\nNorth Africa up to the end of the fourteenth century, and so Ibn\nKhald\u00fbn would have been taught Averroes as well as a decoction\nof Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's logic; his teacher, Muhammad al-Shar\u00eef\nal-Tilims\u00e2n\u00ee (d. 1370), had written a substantial\ncommentary on a short work by Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee,\nthe Sentences (El-Rouayheb 2010b: 71\u201379).\nAt this stage of research, early modern logic\ntraditions may best be divided along the fault-lines of the great\nempires: Ottoman, Persian, and Indian. All of these traditions produced\nmassive amounts of work. With respect to the Persian tradition, I would\nnote merely that by the advent of the Safavids (1501), the\nphilosophical tradition was galvanized by a dispute between two leading\nscholars that had ground on for the last quarter of the preceding\ncentury, and this marked a point at which it became philosophically\nrespectable to prefer the ancient scholars to the more recent, and Averroes\nenjoyed a revival of interest from time to time as a result (see\nEl-Rouayheb 2010b: 92\u2013104 for one aspect covered in the dispute, and\nPourjavady 2011: \u201cIntroduction\u201d for the background). In the\nOttoman tradition, we find a flurry of impressive activity after 1600\namong logicians\ndealing with relational syllogisms (presented in El-Rouayheb 2010b:\nchapters 5, 6 & 7). Finally, with respect to the India, recent\nresearch shows the complexities of the formation of\nteaching traditions of logic there (sketched in Ahmed 2012).\nThe coming of the metropolitan powers signals a convenient point at\nwhich we may speculate that important new possibilities opened up in\nArabic logic. At least some members of the Christian communities in\nthe capitulated territories in Syria and Lebanon trained in Europe. If\nthe books on logic they wrote in Arabic were simply Western logic,\nthen their works fall outside the purview of this entry; but I note\nthat Butrus al-T\u00fbl\u00e2w\u00ee (d. 1745) in his\n1688 Introduction gives a definition of the syllogism which\ncomes from Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee (see Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee 2010:\n238.13\u201314), which is presumably the result of a syncretic process of\ngreat interest for the history of Arabic logic (pace El-Rouayheb\n2010b: 114ff). Again, the relevant texts must be edited and\n studied.[17] \n",
