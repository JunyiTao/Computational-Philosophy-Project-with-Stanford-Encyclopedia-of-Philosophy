Biographical Sketch\n\n\nAnna Julia Cooper was born into slavery as Annie Hayward in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina on August 10, likely in 1858 (though some sources date\nher birth in 1859) before the Civil War. Cooper describes her\nmother Hannah Haywood as \u201cthe finest woman\u201d she had ever\nknown who despite being \u201cuntutored\u201d was still able to\n \u201cread her bible and write a\n little.\u201d[8] \n Cooper presumes that her father was her\nmother\u2019s master, adding that her mother \u201cwas always too\nmodest and shamefaced ever to mention him.\u201d With this one\nsentence Cooper captures both the plights of enslaved Black women of\nthat time\u2014being untutored and sexually exploited; as well as\nthe significant triumphs\u2014learning to read and write against the odds\n(and in many cases against the law).\n\n\nAt the young age of nine, barely removed from slavery, Cooper (then\nAnnie Haywood) begins school at Saint Augustine Normal School in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina where she continued her education for about fourteen\nyears. During this time she also worked as a tutor and\nteacher. Cooper completed studies at what became Saint\nAugustine\u2019s Normal Collegiate School in 1877 and then married\nGeorge Cooper. The newlyweds continued to study and teach at Saint\nAugustine\u2019s, but George Cooper, who went on to become an\nEpiscopal priest, died two short years later. In a letter seeking\nadmission to Oberlin College in Ohio, Cooper lists the content of her\nprevious studies including English; Latin: Cesar (seven\nbooks), Virgil\u2019s Aeneid (six books), Sallust\u2019s\nCataline and Jugurtha, a few orations of\nCicero; Greek: White\u2019s first lessons, Goodwin\u2019s\nGreek Reader\u2014including selections from Xenophon, Plato,\nHerodotus, and Thucydides, the Iliad; along with Algebra and\nGeometry. It is obvious that her education was deeply rooted in the\nhistory of Western philosophy and the classics. Cooper gains\nadmission and leaves Saint Augustine\u2019s for Oberlin\nCollege in 1881 where she goes on to earn a B.A. in mathematics in 1884\nand then an M.A. for college teaching in 1887.\n\n\nAlthough Cooper\u2019s affinity for the Western philosophical canon,\nlanguages, and advanced mathematics at times resulted in her being\nmisread as elitist, it must be noted that these academic and scholarly\nachievements are complemented by her lifetime commitment to education,\nactivism, and community service. The depth of this commitment is\nevidenced by her work as a tutor in North Carolina in her youth, and\nlater as a teacher at Saint Augustine\u2019s College and Wilberforce College\nwhere she taught mathematics, literature, and modern languages. Cooper\nwould have many more years of teaching and administrative experience\nat M Street High School in Washington D.C., where she was appointed\nprincipal from January 2, 1902 to June 30, 1906. After a controversy\nat M Street High School, Cooper left Washington D.C. to teach for\nseveral years at Lincoln University in Missouri. The controversy\ncentered on claims about the immorality of the teachers and misconduct\namong students. It has been speculated that these charges were raised\nbecause some were disgruntled by Cooper\u2019s commitment to teaching\nclassical texts and languages\u2014an approach often associated with\nDu Bois\u2019s educational philosophy rather than Washington\u2019s emphasis on\nvocational training. But Louise Daniele Hutchinson has made the case\nthat Percy M. Hughes, the white director of Washington High Schools at\nthe time, played a role in this controversy insofar as he brought the\ncharges against Cooper. Despite public support for Cooper, the\nbrouhaha ultimately resulted in her not being reappointed as principal\nof M Street High School in 1906. Cooper did eventually return to teach\nat M Street from 1910 to 1930, before teaching at Frelinghuysen\nUniversity where she held the office of the president from\n1930 to 1941.\n\n\nIn addition to these educational and administrative contributions,\nCooper also did work at a War Camp in Indianapolis, supervised a\nplayground in West Virginia, supervised the Colored Settlement House in\nWashington D.C., and helped to facilitate the opening of the first YWCA\nchapter for Black women in Washington, D.C. She was also very active\nin the racial and gender uplift movement, including the Negro\nWomen\u2019s Club Movement\u2014playing a leadership role in the\nWashington Colored Woman\u2019s League which eventually became a part\nof the National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs. \nCooper was a speaker at the Hampton Conference in 1892, a speaker at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893, and she co-founded the Colored Women\u2019s League in 1894 in Washington, D.C. She helped\norganize and also addressed the Pan African Conference in London in\n1900 (which later became the Pan African Congress) before touring\nEurope with her foster daughter Lula Love (visiting the Paris\nExposition, Oberammergau, Munich, and several cities in Italy). \nFurthermore, Shirley Moody-Turner has noted that Cooper was active in\nthe Hampton Folklore Society (working as an interim editor for the\nSouthern Workman) and the Washington Negro Folklore Society\n(as a founder and corresponding secretary). Some have claimed\nthat Cooper was the only female member of the American Negro Academy\n(though others have argued that she was not an official\nmember).\n\n\nIn 1925, at the age of 66, Cooper earned a Ph.D. at the Sorbonne in\nParis, France becoming the fourth Black American woman to earn a\nPh.D. The first three black women to earn the Ph.D. in the U.S.\ninclude Sadie T.M. Alexander (University of Pennsylvania), Georgianna\nRosa Simpson (University of Chicago), and Eva B. Dykes (Radcliff\nCollege) and each did so in 1921. Cooper recalls the Herculean\neffort required to complete her exams and thesis for the doctorate in\nThe Third Step. She took courses at La Guilde\nInternationale, Paris in French Literature, History, and Phonetics\nduring the summer months in 1911, 1912, and 1913. After starting\nher doctoral studies at Columbia University in New York in the summer\nof 1914, Cooper would then take guardianship of five children\n(her great-nieces and nephews) and in 1916 she purchased a five-bedroom\nhome in which to raise them. By 1917 she earned thirty-two\ncredits and was certified in French, Latin, and Greek at\nColumbia. However, Cooper could not meet the one-year residential\nrequirements as she was still working at M Street High School in\nWashington, D.C. She later decided to transfer her credits from\nColumbia to the University of Paris in France. In December\nof 1923 Cooper came down with influenza and asked for a sick leave from\nher teaching obligations. By February 1924 she selected her\nthesis topic, but then learned that she had only sixty days to return\nto her teaching post or be \u201cdropped\u201d from her position at M\nStreet High School. Cooper returned to her teaching position on\nthe sixtieth day and continued to do research and writing on the thesis\nat the Library of Congress on evenings and weekends. She defended\nher thesis on March 23, 1925 and received her dipl\u00f4me de\nDocteur \u00e8s lettres de la Facult\u00e9 de Paris on\nDecember 29, 1925 in a ceremony supported by the Alpha Kappa Alpha\nsorority at Howard University.\n\n\nCooper continued teaching at M Street High School until 1930. \nShe also taught at Frelinghuysen University, holding the office of the\npresident from 1930 to 1941. Over the decades various magazines and\nnewspapers published several of her commentaries on the state of the\nrace. Cooper lived to be 105 years old, residing in Washington\nD.C. until her death on February 27, 1964. Memorial services were\nheld in Raleigh, North Carolina where she is buried. The cemetery\ngravestone reads:\n\n\n\nAnna J. Cooper, Ph.D. 1859\u20131964 \nEducator,\nAuthor, Poet and \nSchool Administrator \nEarly Advocate of Equal Rights \nFor Blacks And Women \nA Graduate Of St. Augustine\u2019s College \nErected 1979.\n",
