    "main_text": "Objections to Pascal\u2019s Wager || Is the Argument Valid?\n5.4 Is the Argument Valid?\n\nA number of authors who have been otherwise critical of the Wager have\nexplicitly conceded that the Wager is valid\u2014e.g. Mackie 1982,\nRescher 1985, Mougin and Sober 1994, and most emphatically, Hacking\n1972. That is, these authors agree with Pascal that wagering for God\nreally is rationally mandated by Pascal\u2019s decision table\u00a0in\ntandem with positive probability for God\u2019s existence, and the\ndecision theoretic account of rational action.\n\nHowever, Duff 1986 and H\u00e1jek 2003 argue that the argument is in\nfact invalid. Their point is that there are strategies besides\nwagering for God that also have infinite expectation\u2014namely,\nmixed strategies, whereby you do not wager for or against God\noutright, but rather choose which of these actions to perform on the\nbasis of the outcome of some chance device. Consider the mixed\nstrategy: \u201cToss a fair coin: heads, you wager for God; tails,\nyou wager against God\u201d. By Pascal\u2019s lights, with\nprobability 1/2 your expectation will be infinite, and with\nprobability 1/2 it will be finite. The expectation of the entire\nstrategy is: \n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\times [f_2 \\times p + f_3 \\times(1 - p)] = \\infty \\]\n\n\nThat is, the \u2018coin toss\u2019 strategy has the same expectation\nas outright wagering for God. But the probability 1/2 was incidental\nto the result. Any mixed strategy that gives positive and finite\nprobability to wagering for God will likewise have infinite\nexpectation: \u201cwager for God iff a fair die lands 6\u201d,\n\u201cwager for God iff your lottery ticket wins\u201d, \u201cwager\nfor God iff a meteor quantum tunnels its way through the side of your\nhouse\u201d, and so on.\n\nIt can be argued that the problem is still worse than this, though,\nfor there is a sense in which anything that you do might be\nregarded as a mixed strategy between wagering for God, and wagering\nagainst God, with suitable probability weights given to each. Suppose\nthat you choose to ignore the Wager, and to go and have a hamburger\ninstead. Still, you may well assign positive and finite probability to\nyour winding up wagering for God nonetheless; and this probability\nmultiplied by infinity again gives infinity. So ignoring the Wager and\nhaving a hamburger has the same expectation as outright wagering for\nGod. Even worse, suppose that you focus all your energy into\navoiding belief in God. Still, you may well assign positive\nand finite probability to your efforts failing, with the result that\nyou wager for God nonetheless. In that case again, your expectation is\ninfinite again. So even if rationality requires you to perform the act\nof maximum expected utility when there is one, here there isn\u2019t\none. Rather, there is a many-way tie for first place, as it were. All\nhell breaks loose: anything you might do is maximally good by expected\nutility\n lights![11]\n\nMonton 2011 defends Pascal\u2019s Wager against this line of\nobjection. He argues that an atheist or agnostic has more than one\nopportunity to follow a mixed strategy. Returning to the first example\nof one, suppose that the fair coin lands tails. Monton\u2019s thought\nis that your expected utility now changes; it is no longer infinite,\nbut rather that of an atheist or agnostic who has no prospect of the\ninfinite reward for wagering for God. You are back to where you\nstarted. But since it was rational for you to follow the mixed\nstrategy the first time, it is rational for you to follow it again\nnow\u2014that is, to toss the coin again. And if it lands tails\nagain, it is rational for you to toss the coin again \u2026 With\nprobability 1, the coin will land heads eventually, and from that\npoint on you will wager for God. Similar reasoning applies to wagering\nfor God just in case an n-sided die lands 1 (say): with probability 1\nthe die will eventually land 1, so if you repeatedly base your mixed\nstrategy on the die, with probability 1 you will wind up wagering for\nGod after a finite number of rolls. Robertson 2012 replies that not\nall such mixed strategies are (probabilistically) guaranteed to lead\nto your wagering for God in the long run: not ones in which the\nprobability of wagering for God decreases sufficiently fast on\nsuccessive trials. Think, for example, of rolling a 4-sided die, then\na 9-sided die, and in general an \\((n+1)^2\\)-sided die on the\n\\(n\\)th trial \u2026, a strategy for which the\nprobability that you will eventually wager for God is only 1/2, as\nRobertson shows. However, Easwaran and Monton 2012 counter-reply that\nwith a continuum of times at which the dice can be rolled, the\nsequence of rolls that Robertson proposes can be completed in an\narbitrarily short period of time. In that case, what should you do\nnext? By Monton\u2019s argument, it seems you should roll a die\nagain. Easwaran and Monton prove that if there are uncountably many\ntimes at which one implements a mixed strategy with non-zero\nprobability of wagering for God, then with probability 1, one ends up\nwagering for God at one of these times. (And they assume, as is\nstandard, that once one wagers for God there is no going back.) They\nconcede that imagining uncountably rolls of a die, say, involves an\nidealization that is surely not physically realizable. But they\nmaintain that you should act in the way that an idealized version of\nyourself would eventually act, one who can realize the rolls\nas described\u2014that is, wager for God outright.\n\nThere is a further twist on the mixed strategies objection. To repeat,\nthe objection\u2019s upshot is that even granting Pascal all his\npremises, still wagering for God is not rationally required. But we\nhave seen numerous reasons not to grant all his premises.\nVery well then; let\u2019s not. Indeed, let\u2019s suppose that you\ngive tiny probability p to them all being true, where \\(p\\)\nis positive and finite. So you assign probability \\(p\\) to your\ndecision problem being exactly as Pascal claims it to be. But if it\nis, according to the mixed strategies objection, all hell breaks\nloose. Yet again, \\(p\\) multiplied by infinity gives infinity. Hence,\nit seems that each action that gets infinite expected utility\naccording to Pascal similarly gets infinite expected utility according\nto you; but by the previous reasoning, that is anything you\nmight do. The full force of the objection that hit Pascal now hits you\ntoo. There are some subtleties that we have elided over; for example,\nif you also assign positive and finite probability to a source of\nnegative infinite utility, then the expected utilities\ninstead become \\(\\infty\\) \u2013 \\(\\infty\\), which is undefined. But\nthat is just another way for all hell to break loose for you: in that\ncase, you cannot evaluate the choiceworthiness of your possible\nactions at all. Either way, you face decision-theoretic paralysis. We\nmight call this Pascal\u2019s Revenge. See H\u00e1jek\n(2015) for more discussion.\n\nJackson and Rogers (2019), developing points in Jackson (2016), argue\nthat the mixed-strategies objection is a \u201cstructural, but not\nsubstantive\u201d (61) objection to Pascal's Wager. They provide\ncases in which it is clearly rational to prefer one infinite good to\nanother. They suggest a reformulation of how prospects of infinite\nrewards should be compared. (This also provides a response to the many\nGods objection.) H\u00e1jek (2003 and especially 2018) offers many\nvalid reformulations of the Wager with more nuanced representations of\nthe utility of salvation, such that the lower the probability of\nwagering for God, the lower the expected utility. See \n footnote 11 for\nfurther discussion.\n",
