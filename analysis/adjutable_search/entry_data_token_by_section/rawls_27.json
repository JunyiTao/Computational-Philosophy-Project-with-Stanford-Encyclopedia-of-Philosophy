    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy || The International Original Position\n5.4 The International Original Position\n\nThe international original position parallels the domestic original\nposition of justice as fairness. This original position answers the\nquestion: \u201cWhat terms of cooperation would free and equal\npeoples (liberal and decent) agree to under fair conditions?\u201d\nThe strategy is to build the conception of peoples into the design of\nthis original position, along with restrictions on reasons for\nfavoring basic principles of international law. The strategy, that is,\nis to describe reasonable conditions under which a rational agreement\non principles can be made.\n\nIn the international original position, representatives of each people\nagree on principles for the international basic structure. Each party\nis behind a veil of ignorance, deprived of information about the\npeople they represent, such as the size of its territory and\npopulation, and its relative political and economic strength. Each\nparty tries to do the best they can for the people they represent, in\nterms of the fundamental interests that all peoples have.\n\nRawls claims that the parties in the international original position\nwould favor the eight principles listed above. Starting from a\nbaseline of equality and independence, the parties would see no reason\nto introduce inequalities into the relationships among peoples (beyond\ncertain functional inequalities in the design of cooperative\norganizations, such as richer countries contributing more to an\nidealized United Nations). The parties would reject international\nutilitarian principles, as no people is prepared to accept that it\nshould sacrifice its fundamental interests for the sake of greater\ntotal global utility.\n\nAfter selecting the eight principles of the law of peoples, the\nparties next check that these principles can stably order\ninternational relations over time. Analogously to the domestic case,\nthe parties will see that the principles of the law of peoples affirm\nthe good of peoples, and that peoples will develop trust and\nconfidence in one another as all willingly continue to abide by these\nprinciples. The stability of the international political order will\nthus be stability for the right reasons (and not a mere modus\nvivendi), since each people will affirm the principles as its\nfirst-best option whatever the international balance of power might\nbecome.\n\nRawls also attempts to draw empirical support for his stability\nargument from the literature on the democratic peace. Social\nscientists have found that historically democracies have tended not to\ngo to war with one another. Rawls explains this by saying that liberal\nsocieties are, because of their internal political structures,\nsatisfied. Liberal peoples have no desires for imperial\nglory, territorial expansion, or to convert others to their religion,\nand whatever goods and services they need from other countries they\ncan obtain through trade. Liberal peoples, Rawls says, have no reasons\nto fight aggressive wars, so a genuine peace can endure among them.\nAnd since decent peoples are defined as non-aggressive, any decent\npeople can join this liberal peace as well.\n\nOnce the parties have agreed to the eight principles of the law of\npeoples, they then continue to specify these principles more precisely\nin a process analogous to the domestic four-stage sequence.\n",
