    "main_text": "The Metaphysical Disputations || Metaphysical Theology\n2.6 Metaphysical Theology\n\nNeedless to say, Su\u00e1rez regarded God as a being and not a being\nof reason. He also thought that unaided natural reason could go a long\nway towards providing a philosophically tenable description of the\nnature of God. Because of this, he devoted two book-length\ndisputations, Metaphysical Disputations XXIX and XXX\nto the topics of God\u2019s existence and nature, the second of\nwhich, devoted to God\u2019s nature, comprises 17 sections covering\nhis essence and attributes, insofar as these are accessible to human\nreasoning.\n\nIn his treatment of God\u2019s attributes, Su\u00e1rez concentrates\non perfection, \n infinitude,[14], \n simplicity, immutability, oneness,\ninvisibility incomprehensibility, and ineffability; he also\ninvestigates God\u2019s life, knowledge, will, omnipotence, and\n omnipresence.[15]\n The breadth, extension, and detail of\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s discussion makes it impossible to consider all\nof these topics here. We may, however, consider a subset of these\nattributes as representative of his approach: perfection, infinitude,\nsimplicity, and immensity or omnipresence. Here we\ntreat only the foundational topic of God\u2019s perfection.\n\nSu\u00e1rez maintains, in common with many others of his period,\nthat God\u2019s attributes can be known by us as they truly are only\nby means of a manifest vision of him, something made possible only\nthrough his supernatural aid. Even so, natural reason can offer a\nlimited knowledge of God and can proceed, according to Su\u00e1rez,\nin two different ways. It can deduce divine attributes from the\nknowledge of the effects of divine operation (a posteriori).\nAlternatively, it can proceed by deducing one attribute from another\n(a priori) (DM XXX.1. intro). Su\u00e1rez applies\nboth of these demonstrative methods to each of the divine attributes\nin turn.\n\nCan it be demonstrated by natural reason that God is by his essence an\nabsolutely perfect being? This question is immediately complicated by\nthe fact that Su\u00e1rez recognizes two central senses of\n\u2018perfection\u2019 (DM XXX.1.1). In one sense, which he\ncalls \u2018privative\u2019, what is perfect is whole and lacks\nnothing required by its nature; in these sense we could\nspeak, for instance, of a perfect horse. In a second sense, which\nSu\u00e1rez calls \u2018negative or absolute\u2019, we refer to\nwhat is absolutely perfect\u2014perfect, that is, not relative to the\nstandard set by a thing\u2019s nature but in absolute terms. Such\nperfect entities necessarily have or contain every other perfection.\nSu\u00e1rez wishes to demonstrate that it belongs to the essence of\nGod to be perfect in both of these senses.\n\nSu\u00e1rez believes that imperfection in the sense of lacking\nsomething that is due to nature always comes from external causes. A\nhorse without tail is a horse which had its tail removed or was\nsomehow prevented from growing one. But there is nothing capable of\nmaking God less than perfect in this sense: nothing can damage him or\notherwise interfere with his perfection. God is not vulnerable to\nimperfection coming from without (DM XXX.1.2). This can be\nshown a priori, Su\u00e1rez contends, by reasoning from\nGod\u2019s other attributes. In the first instance, we can deduce\nGod\u2019s perfection from his simplicity; because he is simple, God\nis non-composite. Since partless entities cannot be partially\ndiminished, but either exist totally or are totally destroyed, it\nfollows that if God is simple, and exists, he must be perfect in the\nsense of being complete (DM XXX.1.2).\n\nLet us turn now to absolute perfection. Every perfection, says\nSu\u00e1rez, is either created or uncreated. If a perfect entity is\nuncreated, that entity must be God. If, however, something is created,\nit owes its existence to God. Created perfection is the effect of a\ncause able to bring about such an effect . According to a causal\nprinciple held in common by Su\u00e1rez and many of his peers, this\ncause must be more noble and more excellent than its effect (if only\nin the sense that it possesses perfection in itself and not as caused\nby something else). From this, Su\u00e1rez deduces that it belongs\nto the essence of God to posses in some way the perfections of all\ncreated beings in a mode that is more noble than the way in which\nthese perfections exist in created beings. This, then, constitutes his\na posteriori proof for God\u2019s absolute perfection\n(DM XXX 1.4).\n\nSu\u00e1rez thinks that God\u2019s absolute perfection can also be\ndemonstrated a priori. As the first cause of everything and\nthe most necessary being, it is necessary that God is also first in\nabsolute perfection. Su\u00e1rez adds that the very idea of\nperfection requires us to posit a completely perfect thing to serve as\nstandard for other beings admitting of degrees of perfection. This\nstandard, he infers, must be God (DM XXX.1.5).\n\nSu\u00e1rez notes, however, that his view that the most perfect\nbeing must be understood as containing the perfections of all\nother beings is not self-evident and requires being argued for as it\nis liable to be wrongly interpreted. Human beings are more perfect\nthan kangaroos, for example, but do not contain within themselves the\nperfections of kangaroos (for one thing, we cannot hop as high)\n(DM XXX 1.5).\n\nSu\u00e1rez maintains instead that God is not simply and in fact\nmore perfect than all other beings: he is more perfect in so far as he\nis the first principle or origin of all the perfections of\nall other beings. To be the first principle or origin of another is\nnot just to be more perfect than every other thing: a first principle\nmust additionally be more perfect in a determinate way than\nthe perfections of the beings for whose perfections he serves as an\norigin. This determinate way of being perfect Su\u00e1rez labels\n\u2018eminent\u2019.\n\nA second a priori proof offered by Su\u00e1rez (DM\nXXX.1.6) is that: (i) God is the most perfect not only of all existing\nbeings but also of all possible beings; (ii) therefore\u2014for\nreasons explained below\u2014God must be perfect in a higher sense than\nall other possible beings; (iii) this higher sense of perfection\nconsists in containing the perfections of all other possible\nbeings. The first premise (i) is shown thus: if there is a more\nperfect being than God, either it is a necessary being and exists in\nact, or it is not yet existent and would be produced by something else\nin order to exist. If this other, productive entity already exists,\nthen we do not have a\npossible being which more perfect than every actual\nbeing. On the other hand, this entity could not be merely possible,\nsince a less perfect being cannot create a more perfect being. The\nquestion thus arises: who or what would be able to create it? It\nfollows, then, that it is not possible to think of a possible being more\nperfect than God. That (ii) follows from (i) is shown thus: if the\nfirst being does not contain all the perfections of other beings, it\nis not the most perfect of all possible beings since in that instance\none could think of a possible being that is at least as perfect as the\nfirst being. It would then contain all the other perfections.\n\nSu\u00e1rez suggests a third a priori proof as well: the\nfirst being must be more perfect than any other being not in specific\nrespects but absolutely, which is to say in all respects.\nThus, for instance, human beings are more perfect than dogs in most\nrespects, but not as concerns their olfactory capacity. God must be\nmore perfect in every respect and for this reason he must include all\nthe perfections of lesser beings (DM XXX.1.7).\n\nOne might be tempted to infer on this basis that God must have the\nperfections of all lesser beings in the same mode as they exist in\nthose beings. Su\u00e1rez rejects this inference. Following other\ntheologians, he distinguishes between absolute and secundum\nquid perfections. Absolute perfections are those that can\ninhere without conflict or opposition in the same thing. These, then,\nbelong to the very idea (or \u201cformal concept\u201d) of God. By\ncontrast, the secundum quid perfections can be\nincompatible with one another and can be hypothetical in the sense\nthat they presuppose some imperfection in that in which they inhere\n(for example, sensory perception seems to involve the imperfection of\nbeing unable to know the qualities of things perceived in an\nunmediated way. So, we could not say that God \u201csees\u201d in\nthe sense we see). So, God has that perfection\n\u201ceminently\u201d, which means that his creative essence has the\ncapacity to communicate to or cause these perfections in beings (for\nexample to communicate the capacity of vision to us) (DM\nXXX.1.8).\n\nThe absolute (non-secundum quid) perfections are\npossessed by God formally (that is, not eminently). These perfections\nare also attributed to creatures, but not, then, in the same way. God\nis wise, but his wisdom has only some formal fittingness\n(covenientia) to ours. For Su\u00e1rez, our talk about\nGod\u2019s absolute perfections is analogical.\n",
