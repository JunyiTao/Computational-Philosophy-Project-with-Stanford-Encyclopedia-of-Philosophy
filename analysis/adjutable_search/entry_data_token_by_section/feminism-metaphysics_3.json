    "main_text": "Social Construction || The Construction of Objects\n2.2 The Construction of Objects\n\nNow consider objects (understanding \u2018objects\u2019 in the\nbroadest sense as virtually anything that\u2019s not an idea). There\nis a sense in which any artifact is a construction; but claiming that\nscissors or cars are social constructions would not have much point,\ngiven how mundane this claim would be. Social constructionists, on the\nwhole, are arguing for a surprising thesis that they believe\nchallenges our everyday view of things. It is much more surprising to\nsay that women or Asian-Americans, homosexuals, child abusers, or\nrefugees, are social constructions. What could this mean?\n\nIn considering the construction of objects, the first point to note is\nthat our classificatory schemes, at least in social contexts, may do\nmore than just map pre-existing groups of individuals; rather our\nattributions have the power to both establish and reinforce groupings\nwhich may eventually come to \u201cfit\u201d the classifications.\nThis works in several ways. Forms of description or classification\nprovide for kinds of intention; e.g., given the classification\n\u201ccool\u201d, we can set about to become cool, or avoid being\ncool, etc. But also, such classifications can function in justifying\nbehavior; e.g., \u201cwe didn\u2019t invite him because he\u2019s\nnot cool\u201d, and such justifications, in turn, can reinforce the\ndistinction between those who are cool and those who are uncool.\nDrawing on Ian Hacking\u2019s work, Haslanger has referred to this as\n\u201cdiscursive\u201d construction:\n\n\nDiscursive construction: something is discursively\nconstructed just in case it is (to a significant extent) the way it is\nbecause of what is attributed to it or how it is classified.\n(Haslanger 1995: 99) \n\n\nAdmittedly, the idea here is quite vague (e.g., how much is \u201ca\nsignificant extent\u201d?). However, social construction in this\nsense is ubiquitous. Each of us is socially constructed in this sense\nbecause we are (to a significant extent) the individuals we are today\nas a result of what has been attributed and self-attributed to us. For\nexample, being classified as able-bodied females from birth has\nprofoundly affected the paths available to us in life and the sort of\npersons we have become.\n\nNote, however, that to say that an entity is \u201cdiscursively\nconstructed\u201d is not to say that language or discourse brings a\nmaterial object into existence de novo. Rather something in\nexistence comes to have\u2014partly as a result of having been\ncategorized in a certain way\u2014a set of features that qualify it\nas a member of a certain kind or\n sort.[4]\n Someone\u2019s having been categorized as a female at birth (and\nconsistently since then) has been a factor in how she has been viewed\nand treated; these views and treatments have, in turn, played an\nimportant causal role in her becoming gendered as a woman. For\nexample, let us suppose for current purposes that being gendered as a\nwoman is to occupy in one\u2019s social context a broad role\nassociated with female reproductive capacities. It is through a\nprocess of socialization\u2014being viewed and treated as a\ngirl\u2014that she learned, and eventually internalized, what the\n\u201cproper\u201d role for females is and how to mark herself as\noccupying it. So she learned that girls only eat so much, only play\nsuch games, only wear certain clothes. Whether or not she accepts\nthese norms, negotiating them was the process by which she became a\nwoman; but discourse didn\u2019t bring her into existence.\n\nIt would appear that gender (in different senses) is both an\nidea-construction and an object-construction. Gender is an\nidea-construction because the classification men/women is the\ncontingent result of historical events and forces. As we saw above,\nthe everyday distinction between males and females leaves out the\nintersexed population that might have been given its own sex/gender\ncategory. Arguably, in fact, some cultures have divided bodies into\nthree sexual/reproductive groups. At the same time the classifications\n\u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 are what Hacking calls\n\u201cinteractive kinds\u201d: gender classifications occur within a\ncomplex matrix of institutions and practices, and being classified as\na woman (or not), or a man (or not), or third, fourth, fifth\nsex/gender or not, has a profound effect on an individual. Such\nclassification will have a material effect on one\u2019s social\nposition as well as affect one\u2019s experience and\nself-understanding. In this sense, women and men\u2014concrete\nindividuals\u2014are constructed as gendered kinds of people, i.e.,\nwe are each object constructions (see \u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir\n2015 for further details).\n",
