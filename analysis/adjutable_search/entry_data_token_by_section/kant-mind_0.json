A Sketch of Kant\u2019s View of the Mind\n\n\nIn this article, we will focus on Immanuel Kant\u2019s (1724\u20131804) work\non the mind and consciousness of self and related issues.\n\n\n\nSome commentators believe that Kant\u2019s views on the mind are\ndependent on his idealism (he called it transcendental idealism). For\nthe most part, that is not so. At worst, most of what he said about the\nmind and consciousness can be detached from his idealism. Though often\nviewed as a quintessentially German philosopher, Kant is said to have\nbeen one-quarter Scottish. Some philosophers (often Scottish) hold that\n\u2018Kant\u2019 is a Germanization of the Scottish name\n\u2018Candt\u2019, though many scholars now reject the idea. It is\nnoteworthy, however, that his work on epistemology, which led him to\nhis ideas about the mind, was a response to\n Hume\n as much as to any other philosopher.\n\n\nIn general structure, Kant\u2019s model of the mind was the dominant\nmodel in the empirical psychology that flowed from his work and then\nagain, after a hiatus during which behaviourism reigned supreme\n(roughly 1910 to 1965), toward the end of the 20th century,\nespecially in cognitive science. Central elements of the models of the\nmind of thinkers otherwise as different as Sigmund Freud and Jerry\nFodor are broadly Kantian, for example.\n\n\nThree ideas define the basic shape (\u2018cognitive\narchitecture\u2019) of Kant\u2019s model and one its dominant method. They\nhave all become part of the foundation of cognitive science.\n\nThe mind is a complex set of abilities (functions). (As Meerbote 1989\nand many others have observed, Kant held a functionalist view of the\nmind almost 200 years before functionalism was officially articulated\nin the 1960s by Hilary Putnam and others.)\nThe functions crucial for mental, knowledge-generating activity are\nspatio-temporal processing of, and application of concepts to, sensory\ninputs. Cognition requires concepts as well as percepts.\nThese functions are forms of what Kant called synthesis. Synthesis\n(and the unity in consciousness required for synthesis) are central to\ncognition.\n\n These three ideas are fundamental to most thinking about cognition now.\nKant\u2019s most important method, the transcendental method, is also at the\nheart of contemporary cognitive science.\n\nTo study the mind, infer the conditions necessary for experience.\nArguments having this structure are called transcendental\narguments.\n\n\n\nTranslated into contemporary terms, the core of this method is\ninference to the best explanation, the method of postulating\nunobservable mental mechanisms in order to explain observed\nbehaviour.\n\n\nTo be sure, Kant thought that he could get more out of his\ntranscendental arguments than just \u2018best explanations\u2019. He\nthought that he could get a priori (experience independent)\nknowledge out of them. Kant had a tripartite doctrine of the a\npriori. He held that some features of the mind and its knowledge\nhad a priori origins, i.e., must be in the mind prior to\nexperience (because using them is necessary to have experience). That\nmind and knowledge have these features are a priori truths,\ni.e., necessary and universal\n (B3/4)[1].\n And we can come to know these\ntruths, or that they are a priori at any rate, only by using\na priori methods, i.e., we cannot learn these things from\nexperience (B3) (Brook 1993). Kant thought that transcendental\narguments were a priori or yielded the a priori in\nall three ways. Nonetheless, at the heart of this method is inference\nto the best explanation. When introspection fell out of favour about\n100 years ago, the alternative approach adopted was exactly this\napproach. Its nonempirical roots in Kant notwithstanding, it is now the\nmajor method used by experimental cognitive scientists.\n\n\nOther topics equally central to Kant\u2019s approach to the mind have hardly been discussed by cognitive science. These include, as we will see near the end, a kind of synthesis that for Kant was essential to minds like ours and what struck him as the most striking features of consciousness of self. Far from his model having been\nsuperseded by cognitive science, some things central to the model have not even\nbeen assimilated by it.\n",
