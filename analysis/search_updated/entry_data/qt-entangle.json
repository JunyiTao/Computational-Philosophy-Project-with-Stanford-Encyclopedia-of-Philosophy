    "main_text": "\n1. Quantum Entanglement\n\nIn 1935 and 1936, Schr\u00f6dinger published a two-part article in the\nProceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in which\nhe discussed and extended an argument by Einstein, Podolsky, and\nRosen. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument was, in many ways,\nthe culmination of Einstein\u2019s critique of the orthodox\nCopenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and was designed to\nshow that the theory is incomplete. (See the entries on the\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory\n and the\n Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.)\n In classical mechanics the state of a system is essentially a list of\nthe system\u2019s properties \u2014 more precisely, it is the\nspecification of a set of parameters from which the list of properties\ncan be reconstructed: the positions and momenta of all the particles\ncomprising the system (or similar parameters in the case of fields).\nThe dynamics of the theory specifies how properties change in terms of\na law of evolution for the state. In a letter to Max Born, Wolfgang\nPauli characterized this mode of description of physical systems as a\n\u2018detached observer\u2019 idealization (see The\nBorn-Einstein Letters, Born, 1992; p. 218). On the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, such a description is not possible for quantum\nsystems. Instead, the quantum state of a system should be understood\nas a catalogue of what an observer has done to the system and what has\nbeen observed, and the import of the state then lies in the\nprobabilities that can be inferred (in terms of the theory) for the\noutcomes of possible future observations on the system. Einstein\nrejected this view and proposed a series of arguments to show that the\nquantum state is simply an incomplete characterization of a quantum\nsystem. The missing parameters are sometimes referred to as\n\u2018hidden parameters\u2019 or \u2018hidden variables.\u2019\n\nIt should not be supposed that Einstein\u2019s notion of a complete\ntheory included the requirement that the theory should be\ndeterministic. Rather, he required certain conditions of separability\nand locality for composite systems consisting of separated component\nsystems: each component system separately should be characterized by\nits own properties (its own \u2018being-thus,\u2019 as Einstein put\nit \u2014 \u2018So-sein\u2019 in German), and it should be\nimpossible to alter the properties of a distant system instantaneously\n(or the probabilities of these properties) by acting on a local\nsystem. In later analyses, notably in Bell\u2019s argument for the\nnonlocality of quantum correlations, it became apparent that these\nconditions, suitably formulated as probability constraints, are\nequivalent to the requirement that statistical correlations between\nseparated systems should be reducible to probability distributions\nover common causes (deterministic or stochastic) in the sense of\nReichenbach. (See the entries on\n Bell\u2019s theorem\n and\n Reichenbach\u2019s common cause principle.)\n\nIn the original EPR article, two particles are prepared from a source\nin a certain \u2018pure\u2019 quantum state of the composite system\n(a state that cannot be expressed as a mixture or probability\ndistribution of other pure quantum states, and cannot be reduced to a\npure quantum state of each particle separately). After the particles\nmove apart, there are \u2018matching\u2019 correlations between both\nthe positions of the two particles and their momenta: a measurement of\neither position or momentum on a particular particle will allow the\nprediction, with certainty, of the outcome of a position measurement\nor momentum measurement, respectively, on the other particle. These\nmeasurements are mutually exclusive: either a position measurement can\nbe performed, or a momentum measurement, but not both simultaneously.\nThe subsequent measurement of momentum, say, after establishing a\nposition correlation, will no longer yield any correlation in the\nmomenta of the two particles. It is as if the position measurement\ndisturbs the correlation between the momentum values, and conversely.\nApart from this peculiarity that either correlation can be observed,\nbut not both for the same pair of quantum particles, the position and\nmomentum correlations for the quantum particles are exactly like the\nclassical correlations between two billiard balls after a collision.\nClassical correlations can be explained by a common cause, or\ncorrelated \u2018elements of reality.\u2019 The EPR argument is that\nquantum mechanics is incomplete because these common causes or\nelements of reality are not included in the quantum state\ndescription.\n\nHere is how Schr\u00f6dinger put the puzzle in the first part of his\ntwo-part article (Schr\u00f6dinger, 1935; p. 559):\n\nYet since I can predict either \\(x_1\\) or \\(p_1\\) without\ninterfering with the system No. 1 and since system No. 1, like a\nscholar in an examination, cannot possibly know which of the two\nquestions I am going to ask first: it so seems that our scholar is\nprepared to give the right answer to the first question he is\nasked, anyhow. Therefore he must know both answers; which is\nan amazing knowledge; quite irrespective of the fact that after having\ngiven his first answer our scholar is invariably so disconcerted or\ntired out, that all the following answers are \u2018wrong.\u2019\n\n\nWhat Schr\u00f6dinger showed was that if two particles are prepared in\nan EPR quantum state, where there are matching correlations for\ntwo \u2018canonically conjugate\u2019 dynamical quantities\n(quantities like position and momentum whose values suffice to specify\nall the properties of a classical system), then there are infinitely\nmany dynamical quantities of the two particles for which there exist\nsimilar matching correlations: every function of the canonically\nconjugate pair of the first particle matches with the same function of\nthe canonically conjugate pair of the second particle. So\n(Schr\u00f6dinger, p. 559) system No. 1 \u2018does not only know\nthese two answers but a vast number of others, and that with no\nmnemotechnical help whatsoever, at least with none that we know\nof.\u2019\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger coined the term \u2018entanglement\u2019 to\ndescribe this peculiar connection between quantum systems\n(Schr\u00f6dinger, 1935; p. 555):\n\nWhen two systems, of which we know the states by their respective\nrepresentatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to\nknown forces between them, and when after a time of mutual influence\nthe systems separate again, then they can no longer be described in\nthe same way as before, viz. by endowing each of them with a\nrepresentative of its own. I would not call that one but\nrather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one\nthat enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought. By\nthe interaction the two representatives [the quantum states] have\nbecome entangled.\n\n\nHe added (Schr\u00f6dinger, 1935; p. 555):\n\nAnother way of expressing the peculiar situation is: the best possible\nknowledge of a whole does not necessarily include the best\npossible knowledge of all its parts, even though they may be\nentirely separate and therefore virtually capable of being \u2018best\npossibly known,\u2019 i.e., of possessing, each of them, a\nrepresentative of its own. The lack of knowledge is by no means due to\nthe interaction being insufficiently known \u2014 at least not in the\nway that it could possibly be known more completely \u2014 it is due\nto the interaction itself.\n\n\nAttention has recently been called to the obvious but very\ndisconcerting fact that even though we restrict the disentangling\nmeasurements to one system, the representative obtained for\nthe other system is by no means independent of the particular\nchoice of observations which we select for that purpose and which by\nthe way are entirely arbitrary. It is rather discomforting\nthat the theory should allow a system to be steered or piloted into\none or the other type of state at the experimenter\u2019s mercy in\nspite of his having no access to it.\n\n\nIn the second part of the paper, Schr\u00f6dinger showed that an\nexperimenter, by a suitable choice of operations carried out on one\nmember of an entangled pair, possibly using additional\n\u2018ancilla\u2019 or helper particles, can \u2018steer\u2019 the\nsecond system into a chosen mixture of quantum states, with a\nprobability distribution that depends on the entangled state. The\nsecond system cannot be steered into a particular quantum\nstate at the whim of the experimenter, but for many copies of the\nentangled pair, the experimenter can constrain the quantum state of\nthe second system to lie in a chosen set of quantum states, where\nthese states are correlated with the possible outcomes of measurements\ncarried out on the entangled paired systems, or the paired systems\nplus ancillas. He found this conclusion sufficiently unsettling to\nsuggest that the entanglement between two separating systems would\npersist only for distances small enough that the time taken by light\nto travel from one system to the other could be neglected, compared\nwith the characteristic time periods associated with other changes in\nthe composite system. He speculated that for longer distances the two\nsystems might in fact be in a correlated mixture of quantum states\ndetermined by the entangled state.\n\nMost physicists attributed the puzzling features of entangled quantum\nstates to Einstein\u2019s inappropriate \u2018detached\nobserver\u2019 view of physical theory and regarded Bohr\u2019s\nreply to the EPR argument (Bohr, 1935) as vindicating the Copenhagen\ninterpretation. This was unfortunate, because the study of\nentanglement was ignored for thirty years until John Bell\u2019s\nreconsideration of the EPR argument (Bell, 1964). Bell looked at\nentanglement in simpler systems than the EPR example: matching\ncorrelations between two-valued dynamical quantities, such as\npolarization in a particular direction or spin in a particular\ndirection, of two separated systems in an entangled state. What Bell\nshowed was that the statistical correlations between the measurement\noutcomes of suitably chosen different quantities on the two\nsystems are inconsistent with an inequality derivable from\nEinstein\u2019s separability and locality assumptions \u2014 in\neffect from the assumption that the correlations have a common cause.\nThis inequality is now known as Bell\u2019s inequality, and various\nrelated inequalities can be derived as a necessary condition for\nclassical or common cause correlations.\n\nBell\u2019s investigation generated an ongoing debate on the\nfoundations of quantum mechanics. One important feature of this debate\nwas confirmation that entanglement can persist over long distances,\nthus falsifying Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s supposition of the\nspontaneous decay of entanglement as two entangled particles separate.\n(Free space entanglement of photons has been demonstrated over a\ndistance of 143 km and, using satellites to distribute\nentanglement, between locations more than 1200 km apart on earth. See\nHerbst et al 2014 and Yin et al 2017.) But it\nwas not until the 1980s that physicists, computer scientists, and\ncryptologists began to regard the non-local correlations of entangled\nquantum states as a new kind of non-classical physical resource that\ncould be exploited, rather than an embarrassment for quantum mechanics\nto be explained away. For a discussion of entanglement \u2014 what it\nis, why it is conceptually puzzling, and what you can do with it,\nincluding a simple proof of Bell\u2019s theorem \u2014 see the\ngraphic novel Totally Random: Why Nobody Understands Quantum\nMechanics (A Serious Comic on Entanglement), Bub and Bub 2018.\nFor further discussion of entanglement as a physical resource,\nincluding measuring entanglement, and the manipulation and\npurification of entanglement by local operations, see \u201cThe Joy\nof Entanglement\u201d by Popescu and Rohrlich in Lo, Popescu, and\nSpiller 1998, Bub 2016, and the classic Nielsen and Chuang 2011.\nAlain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger were awared the\n2022 Nobel Prize in physics for their pioneering experiments on\nentangled photons, validating Bell\u2019s insight and initiating the field\nof quantum information.\n2. Exploiting Entanglement: Quantum Teleportation\n\nConsider again Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s realization that an entangled\nstate could be used to steer a distant particle into one of a set of\nstates, with a certain probability. In fact, this possibility of\n\u2018remote steering\u2019 is even more dramatic than\nSchr\u00f6dinger demonstrated. Suppose Alice and Bob share an\nentangled pure state of the sort considered by Bell, say two photons\nin an entangled state of polarization, where Alice has in her\npossession one of the entangled photons, and Bob has the second paired\nphoton. Suppose that Alice receives an additional photon in an unknown\nstate of polarization \\(\\ket{u}\\), where the notation \u2018\\(\\ket{\\\n}\\)\u2019 denotes a quantum state. It is possible for Alice to\nperform an operation on the two photons in her possession that will\ntransform Bob\u2019s photon into one of four states, depending on the\nfour possible (random) outcomes of Alice\u2019s operation: either the\nstate \\(\\ket{u}\\), or a state that is related to \\(\\ket{u}\\) in a\ndefinite way. Alice\u2019s operation entangles the two photons in her\npossession, and disentangles Bob\u2019s photon, steering it into a\nstate \\(\\ket{u^*}\\). After Alice communicates the outcome of her\noperation to Bob, Bob knows either that \\(\\ket{u^*}\\) = \\(\\ket{u}\\),\nor how to transform \\(\\ket{u^*}\\) to \\(\\ket{u}\\) by a local operation.\nThis phenomenon is known as \u2018quantum teleportation.\u2019 After\nthe teleportation procedure the state \\(\\ket{u}\\) remains unknown to\nboth Alice and Bob.\n\nWhat is extraordinary about this phenomenon is that Alice and Bob have\nmanaged to use their shared entangled state as a quantum communication\nchannel to destroy the state \\(\\ket{u}\\) of a photon in Alice\u2019s\npart of the universe and recreate it in Bob\u2019s part of the\nuniverse. Since the linear polarization state of a photon requires\nspecifying a direction in space (the value of an angle that can vary\ncontinuously), without a shared entangled state Alice would have to\nconvey an infinite amount of classical information to Bob for Bob to\nbe able to reconstruct the state \\(\\ket{u}\\) precisely. The amount of\nclassical information associated with a binary alternative,\nrepresented as 0 or 1, where each alternative has equal probability,\nis one binary digit or \u2018bit.\u2019 To specify an arbitrary\nangle as a decimal requires an infinite sequence of digits between 0\nand 9, or an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s in binary notation. The\noutcome of Alice\u2019s operation, which has four possible outcomes\nwith equal probability of 1/4, can be specified by two bits of\nclassical information. Remarkably, Bob can reconstruct the state\n\\(\\ket{u}\\) on the basis of just two bits of classical information\ncommunicated by Alice, apparently by exploiting the entangled state as\na quantum communication channel to transfer the remaining information.\nThe idea was first proposed by Bennett et al in\n1993. For further discussion of quantum teleportation, see\nNielsen and Chuang 2011, or Richard Josza\u2019s article\n\u201cQuantum Information and its Properties\u201d in Lo, Popescu,\nand Spiller 1998. Quantum teleportation has been achieved over a\ndistance of around 100 km on earth, and 1400 km between earth and a\nsatellite (Zeilinger, 2018). The development of a quantum internet\nusing satellites to transmit entangled photons will rely on\nquantum teleportation.\n3. Quantum Information\n\nFormally, the amount of classical information we gain, on average,\nwhen we learn the value of a random variable (or, equivalently, the\namount of uncertainty in the value of a random variable before we\nlearn its value) is represented by a quantity called the Shannon\nentropy, measured in bits (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). A random\nvariable is defined by a probability distribution over a set of\nvalues. In the case of a binary random variable, with equal\nprobability for each of the two possibilities, the Shannon entropy is\none bit, representing maximal uncertainty. For all other probabilities\n\u2014 intuitively, representing some information about which\nalternative is more likely \u2014 the Shannon entropy is less than\none. For the case of maximal knowledge or zero uncertainty about the\nalternatives, where the probabilities are 0 and 1, the Shannon entropy\nis zero. (Note that the term \u2018bit\u2019 is used to refer to the\nbasic unit of classical information in terms of Shannon entropy, and\nto an elementary two-state classical system considered as representing\nthe possible outputs of an elementary classical information\nsource.)\n\nSince information is always embodied in the state of a physical\nsystem, we can also think of the Shannon entropy as quantifying the\nphysical resources required to store classical information. Suppose\nAlice wishes to communicate some classical information to Bob over a\nclassical communication channel such as a telephone line. A relevant\nquestion concerns the extent to which the message can be compressed\nwithout loss of information, so that Bob can reconstruct the original\nmessage accurately from the compressed version. According to\nShannon\u2019s source coding theorem or noiseless coding theorem\n(assuming a noiseless telephone line with no loss of information), the\nminimal physical resource required to represent the message\n(effectively, a lower bound on the possibility of compression) is\ngiven by the Shannon entropy of the source.\n\nWhat happens if we use the quantum states of physical systems to store\ninformation, rather than classical states? It turns out that quantum\ninformation is radically different from classical information. The\nunit of quantum information is the \u2018qubit\u2019, representing\nthe amount of quantum information that can be stored in the state of\nthe simplest quantum system, for example, the polarization state of a\nphoton. The term is due to Schumacher (1995), who proved a quantum\nanalogue of Shannon\u2019s noiseless coding theorem. (By analogy with\nthe term \u2018bit,\u2019 the term \u2018qubit\u2019 refers to the\nbasic unit of quantum information in terms of the von Neumann entropy,\nand to an elementary two-state quantum system considered as\nrepresenting the possible outputs of an elementary quantum information\nsource.) An arbitrarily large amount of classical information can be\nencoded in a qubit. This information can be processed and communicated\nbut, because of the peculiarities of quantum measurement, at most one\nbit can be accessed. According to a theorem by Holevo, the accessible\ninformation in a probability distribution over a set of alternative\nqubit states is limited by the von Neumann entropy, which is equal to\nthe Shannon entropy only when the states are orthogonal in the space\nof quantum states, and is otherwise less than the Shannon entropy.\n\nWhile classical information can be copied or cloned, the quantum\n\u2018no cloning\u2019 theorem (Dieks, 1982; Wootters and Zurek,\n1982) asserts the impossibility of cloning an unknown quantum state.\nTo see why, consider how we might construct a classical copying\ndevice. A NOT gate is a device that takes a bit as input and produces\nas output either a 1 if the input is 0, or a 0 if the input is 1. In\nother words, a NOT gate is a 1-bit gate that flips the input bit. A\ncontrolled-NOT gate, or CNOT gate, takes two bits as inputs, a control\nbit and a target bit, and flips the target bit if and only if the\ncontrol bit is 1, while reproducing the control bit. So there are two\ninputs, the control and target, and two outputs: the control, and\neither the target or the flipped target, depending on the value of the\ncontrol. A CNOT gate functions as a copying device for the control bit\nif the target bit is set to 0, because the output of the target bit is\nthen a copy of the control bit: the input 00 produces output 00, and\nthe input 10 produces output 11 (here the first bit is the control and\nthe second bit is the target). Insofar as we can think of a\nmeasurement as simply a copying operation, a CNOT gate is the paradigm\nof a classical measuring device. Imagine Alice equipped with such a\ndevice, with input and output control and target wires, measuring the\nproperties of an unknown classical world. The input control wire is a\nprobe for the presence or absence of a property, represented by a 1 or\na 0. The target wire functions as the pointer, which is initially set\nto 0. The output of the target is a 1 or a 0, depending on the\npresence or absence of the property.\n\nSuppose we attempt to use a CNOT gate to copy an unknown qubit state.\nSince we are now proposing to regard the CNOT gate as a device for\nprocessing quantum states, the evolution from input states to output\nstates must be effected by a physical quantum transformation. Quantum\ntransformations are linear on the linear state space of qubits.\nLinearity of the state space means that any sum or\nsuperposition with coefficients \\(c_0, c_1\\) of two qubit states in\nthe state space is also a qubit state in the state space. Linearity of\nthe transformation requires that the transformation should\ntake a qubit state represented by the sum of two qubit states to a new\nqubit state that is the sum of the transformed qubit states. If the\nCNOT gate succeeds in copying two orthogonal qubit states, represented\nas \\(\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\), it cannot succeed in copying a general linear\nsuperposition of these qubits. Since the gate functions linearly, it\nmust instead produce a state that is a linear superposition of the\noutputs obtained for the two orthogonal qubit states. That is to say,\nthe output of the gate will be represented by a quantum state that is\na sum of two terms, where the first term represents the output of the\ncontrol and target for the first qubit state, and the second term\nrepresents the output of the control and target for the second\northogonal qubit state. This could be expressed as \\(c_0 \\ket{0}\n\\ket{0}\\) + \\(c_1 \\ket{1} \\ket{1}\\), which is an entangled state\n(unless \\(c_0\\) or \\( c_1\\) is zero) rather than the output that would\nbe required by a successful copying operation (where the control and\ntarget each outputs the superposition qubit state \\(c_0 \\ket{0}\\) +\n\\(c_1 \\ket{1}\\)).\n4. Quantum Cryptography\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob are separated and want to communicate a secret\nmessage, without revealing any information to Eve, an eavesdropper.\nThey can do this in a classical world if they share a \u2018one-time\npad,\u2019 a cryptographic key represented by a sequence of random\nbits at least as long as the number of bits required to communicate\nthe message. In fact, this is the only secure way to achieve perfect\nsecurity in a classical world. To send a message to Bob, Alice\ncommunicates which bits in the key Bob should flip. The resulting\nsequence of bits is the message. In addition, they would need to have\nsome way of encoding messages as sequences of bits, by representing\nletters of the alphabet and spaces and punctuation symbols as binary\nnumbers, which could be done by some standard, publicly available\nscheme.\n\nThe problem is that messages communicated in this way are only secret\nif Alice and Bob use a different one-time pad for each message. If\nthey use the same one-time pad for several messages, Eve could gain\nsome information about the correspondence between letters of the\nalphabet and subsequences of bits in the key by relating statistical\nfeatures of the messages to the way words are composed of letters. To\nshare a new key they would have to rely on trusted couriers or some\nsimilar method to distribute the key. There is no way to guarantee the\nsecurity of the key distribution procedure in a classical world.\n\nCopying the key without revealing that it has been copied is also a\nproblem for the shared key that Alice and Bob each store in some\nsupposedly secure way. But the laws of physics in a classical world\ncannot guarantee that a storage procedure is completely secure, and\nthey cannot guarantee that breaching the security and copying the key\nwill always be detected. So apart from the key distribution problem,\nthere is a key storage problem.\n\nQuantum entanglement provides a way of solving these problems through\nthe \u2018monogamy\u2019 of entangled state correlations: no third\nparty can share entanglement correlations between Alice and Bob.\nMoreover, any attempt by Eve to measure the quantum systems in the\nentangled state shared by Alice and Bob will destroy the entangled\nstate. Alice and Bob can detect this by checking a Bell\ninequality.\n\nOne way to do this is by a protocol originally proposed by Artur\nEkert. Suppose Alice has a collection of photons, one for each\nentangled pair in the state \\(\\ket{0}\\ket{0} + \\ket{1}\\ket{1}\\)\n(ignoring the equal coefficients, for simplicity), and Bob has the\ncollection of paired photons. Alice measures the polarization of her\nphotons randomly in directions, \\(0, \\pi/8, 2\\pi/8\\) with respect to\nsome direction \\(z\\) they agree on in advance, and Bob measures the\npolarizations of his photons randomly in directions \\(\\pi/8, 2\\pi/8,\n3\\pi/8\\). They communicate the directions of their polarization\nmeasurements publicly, but not the outcomes, and they divide the\nmeasurements into two sets: one set when they both measured\npolarization in the direction \\(\\pi/8\\), or when they both measured\npolarization in the direction \\(2\\pi/8\\), and one set when Alice\nmeasured polarization in directions \\(0\\) or \\(2\\pi/8\\) and Bob\nmeasured polarization in directions \\(\\pi/8\\) or \\(3\\pi/8\\). For the\nfirst set, when they measured the polarization in the same direction,\nthe outcomes are random but perfectly correlated in the entangled\nstate so they share these random bits as a cryptographic key. They use\nthe second set to check a Bell inequality, which reveals whether or\nnot the entangled state has been altered by the measurements of an\neavesdropper. (See Ekert, 1991.)\n\nWhile the difference between classical and quantum information can be\nexploited to achieve successful key distribution, there are other\ncryptographic protocols that are thwarted by quantum entanglement. Bit\ncommitment is a key cryptographic protocol that can be used as a\nsubroutine in a variety of important cryptographic tasks. In a bit\ncommitment protocol, Alice supplies an encoded bit to Bob. The\ninformation available in the encoding should be insufficient for Bob\nto ascertain the value of the bit, but sufficient, together with\nfurther information (supplied by Alice at a subsequent stage when she\nis supposed to reveal the value of the bit), for Bob to be convinced\nthat the protocol does not allow Alice to cheat by encoding the bit in\na way that leaves her free to reveal either 0 or 1 at will.\n\nTo illustrate the idea, suppose Alice claims the ability to predict\nadvances or declines in the stock market on a daily basis. To\nsubstantiate her claim without revealing valuable information (perhaps\nto a potential employer, Bob) she suggests the following\ndemonstration: She proposes to record her prediction, before the\nmarket opens, by writing a 0 (for \u2018decline\u2019) or a 1 (for\n\u2018advance\u2019) on a piece of paper, which she will lock in a\nsafe. The safe will be handed to Bob, but Alice will keep the key. At\nthe end of the day\u2019s trading, she will announce the bit she\nchose and prove that she in fact made the commitment at the earlier\ntime by handing Bob the key. Of course, the key-and-safe protocol is\nnot provably secure from cheating by Bob, because there is no\nprinciple of classical physics that prevents Bob from opening the safe\nand closing it again without leaving any trace. The question is\nwhether there exists a quantum analogue of this procedure that is\nunconditionally secure: provably secure by the laws of physics against\ncheating by either Alice or Bob. Bob can cheat if he can obtain\nsome information about Alice\u2019s commitment before she\nreveals it (which would give him an advantage in repetitions of the\nprotocol with Alice). Alice can cheat if she can delay actually making\na commitment until the final stage when she is required to reveal her\ncommitment, or if she can change her commitment at the final stage\nwith a very low probability of detection.\n\nIt turns out that unconditionally secure two-party bit commitment,\nbased solely on the principles of quantum or classical mechanics\n(without exploiting special relativistic signaling constraints, or\nprinciples of general relativity or thermodynamics) is impossible. See\nMayers 1997, Lo and Chau 1997 and Lo\u2019s article \u201cQuantum\nCryptology\u201d in Lo, Popescu, and Spiller 1998 for further\ndiscussion. (Kent 1999 has shown that one can implement a secure\nclassical bit commitment protocol by exploiting relativistic signaling\nconstraints in a timed sequence of communications between verifiably\nseparated sites for both Alice and Bob.) Roughly, the impossibility\narises because at any step in the protocol where either Alice or Bob\nis required to make a determinate choice (perform a measurement on a\nparticle in the quantum channel, choose randomly and perhaps\nconditionally between a set of alternative actions to be implemented\non the particle in the quantum channel, etc.), the choice can delayed\nby entangling one or more ancilla particles with the channel particle\nin an appropriate way. By suitable operations on the ancillas, the\nchannel particle can be \u2018steered\u2019 so that this cheating\nstrategy is undetectable. In effect, if Bob can obtain no information\nabout the committed bit, then entanglement will allow Alice to\n\u2018steer\u2019 the bit to either 0 or 1 at will. \n\nIn 2022 the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nannounced a suite of encryption protocols designed to be secure\nagainst attacks by a quantum computer:\n NIST Announces First Four Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms. \n5. Quantum Computation\n\nQuantum information can be processed, but the accessibility of this\ninformation is limited by the Holevo bound (mentioned in Section 3).\nDavid Deutsch (1985) first showed how to exploit quantum entanglement\nto perform a computational task that is impossible for a classical\ncomputer. Suppose we have a black box or oracle that evaluates a\nBoolean function \\(f\\), where the arguments or inputs of \\(f\\) are\neither 0 or 1, and the values or outputs of \\(f\\) are also 0 or 1. The\noutputs are either the same for both inputs (in which case \\(f\\) is\nsaid to be constant), or different for the two inputs (in which case\n\\(f\\) is said to be balanced). Suppose we are interested in\ndetermining whether \\(f\\) is constant or balanced. Classically, the\nonly way to do this is to run the black box or query the oracle twice,\nfor both arguments 0 and 1, and to pass the values (outputs of \\(f\\))\nto a circuit that determines whether they are the same (for\n\u2018constant\u2019) or different (for \u2018balanced\u2019).\nDeutsch showed that if we use quantum states and quantum gates to\nstore and process information, then we can determine whether \\(f\\) is\nconstant or balanced in one evaluation of the function \\(f\\). The\ntrick is to design the circuit (the sequence of gates) to produce the\nanswer to a global question about the function in an output\nqubit register that can then be read out or measured.\n\nConsider again the quantum CNOT gate, with two orthogonal qubits\n\\(\\ket{0}\\) and \\(\\ket{1}\\) as possible inputs for the control, and\n\\(\\ket{0}\\) as the input for the target. One can think of the input\ncontrol and output target qubits, respectively, as the argument and\nassociated value of a function. This CNOT function associates the\nvalue 0 with the argument 0 and the value 1 with the argument 1. For a\nlinear superposition of the orthogonal qubits with equal coefficients\nas input to the control, and the qubit \\(\\ket{0}\\) as the input to the\ntarget, the output is the entangled state \\(\\ket{0} \\ket{0}\\) +\n\\(\\ket{1} \\ket{1}\\) (ignoring the coefficients, for simplicity). This\nis a linear superposition in which the first term represents the\nargument 0 and associated value 0 of the CNOT function, and the second\nterm represents the argument 1 and associated value 1 of the CNOT\nfunction. The entangled state represents all possible arguments and\ncorresponding values of the function as a linear superposition, but\nthis information is not accessible. What can be shown to be\naccessible, by a suitable choice of quantum gates, is information\nabout whether or not the function has certain global properties. This\ninformation is obtainable without reading out the evaluation of any\nindividual arguments and values. (Indeed, accessing information in the\nentangled state about a global property of the function will typically\nrequire losing access to all information about individual arguments\nand values.)\n\nThe situation is analogous for Deutsch\u2019s function \\(f\\). Here\nthe output of \\(f\\) can be represented as either \\(\\ket{0} \\ket{0} +\n\\ket{1} \\ket{0}\\) or \\(\\ket{0} \\ket{1} + \\ket{1} \\ket{1}\\) in the\n\u2018constant\u2019 case, or \\(\\ket{0} \\ket{0} + \\ket{1} \\ket{1}\\)\nor \\(\\ket{0} \\ket{1} + \\ket{1} \\ket{0}\\) in the \u2018balanced\u2019\ncase. The two entangled states in the \u2018constant\u2019 case are\northogonal in the 4-dimensional two-qubit state space and span a\nplane. Call this the \u2018constant\u2019 plane. Similarly, the two\nentangled states in the \u2018balanced\u2019 case span a plane, the\n\u2018balanced\u2019 plane. These two planes, representing two\nalternative quantum disjunctions, are orthogonal except for an\nintersection or overlap in a line, representing a product\n(non-entangled) state, where each qubit separately is in the state\n\\(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1}\\). It is therefore possible to design a\nmeasurement to distinguish the two alternative disjunctive or global\nproperties of \\(f\\), \u2018constant\u2019 or \u2018balanced,\u2019\nwith a certain probability (actually, 1/2) of failure, when the\nmeasurement yields an outcome corresponding to the overlap state,\nwhich is common to the two cases. Nevertheless, only one query of the\nfunction is required when the measurement succeeds in identifying the\nglobal property. With a judicious choice of quantum gates, it is even\npossible to design a quantum circuit that always succeeds in\ndistinguishing the two cases in one run.\n\nDeutsch\u2019s example shows how quantum information and quantum\nentanglement can be exploited to compute a disjunctive or global\nproperty of a function in one step that would take two steps\nclassically. While Deutsch\u2019s problem is rather trivial, there\nnow exist several quantum algorithms with interesting applications,\nnotably Shor\u2019s factorization algorithm for factoring large\ncomposite integers in polynomial time (with direct application to\n\u2018public key\u2019 cryptography, a widely used classical\ncryptographic scheme) and Grover\u2019s database search algorithm.\nShor\u2019s algorithm achieves an exponential speed-up over any\nknown classical algorithm. For algorithms that are allowed access\nto oracles (whose internal structure is not considered), the speed-up\ncan be shown to be exponential over any classical algorithm\nin some cases, e.g., Simon\u2019s algorithm. For more on quantum\ncomputing and quantum algorithms, see Nielsen and Chuang 2011,\nBarenco\u2019s article \u201cQuantum Computation: An\nIntroduction\u201d in Lo, Popescu, and Spiller 1998, Bub 2006\n(Section 6), Abhijith et al 2022, as well as the entry on\n quantum computing.\n\nNote that there is currently no proof that a quantum algorithm can\nsolve an NP-complete problem in polynomial time (see the entry on\n computational complexity theory for\n the concept of an NP-complete problem), so the efficiency of quantum\ncomputers relative to classical computers could turn out to be\nillusory. If there is indeed a speed-up, it would seem to be due\nto the phenomenon of entanglement. The amount of information required\nto describe a general entangled state of \\(n\\) qubits grows\nexponentially with \\(n\\). The state space (Hilbert space) has \\(2^n\\)\ndimensions, and a general entangled state is a superposition of\n\\(2^n\\) \\(n\\)-qubit states. In classical mechanics there are no\nentangled states: a general \\(n\\)-bit composite system can be\ndescribed with just \\(n\\) times the amount of information required to\ndescribe a single bit system. So the classical simulation of a quantum\nprocess would involve an exponential increase in the classical\ninformational resource required to represent the quantum state, as the\nnumber of qubits that become entangled in the evolution grows\nlinearly, and there would be a corresponding exponential slowdown in\ncalculating the evolution, compared to the actual quantum computation\nperformed by the system.\n6. Interpretative Remarks\n\nDeutsch (1997) has argued that the exponential speed-up in quantum\ncomputation, and in general the way a quantum system processes\ninformation, can only be properly understood within the framework of\nEverett\u2019s \u2018many-worlds\u2019 interpretation (see the\nentries on\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics\n and the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics).\n The idea, roughly, is that an entangled state of the sort that arises\nin the quantum computation of a function, which represents a linear\nsuperposition over all possible arguments and corresponding values of\nthe function, should be understood as something like a massively\nparallel classical computation, for all possible values of the\nfunction, in parallel worlds. For an insightful critique of this idea\nof \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019 as explanatory, see Steane\n2003.\n\nAn alternative view emphasizes the non-Boolean structure of properties\nof quantum systems. The properties of a classical system form a\nBoolean algebra, essentially the abstract characterization of a\nset-theoretic structure. This is reflected in the Boolean character of\nclassical logic, and the Boolean gates in a classical computer. From\nthis perspective, the picture is entirely different. Rather than\n\u2018computing all values of a function at once,\u2019 a quantum\nalgorithm achieves an exponential speed-up over a classical algorithm\nby computing the answer to a disjunctive or global question about a\nfunction (e.g., whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced)\nwithout computing redundant information (e.g., the output values for\ndifferent inputs to the function). A crucial difference between\nquantum and classical information is the possibility of selecting an\nexclusive disjunction, representing a global property of a function,\namong alternative possible disjunctions \u2014 for example, the\n\u2018constant\u2019 disjunction asserting that the value of the\nfunction (for both arguments) is 0 or 1, or the\n\u2018balanced\u2019 disjunction asserting that the value of the\nfunction (for both arguments) is the same as the argument or\ndifferent from the argument \u2014 without determining the truth\nvalues of the disjuncts.\n\nClassically, an exclusive disjunction is true if and only if one of\nthe disjuncts is true. Deutsch\u2019s quantum circuit achieves its\nspeed-up by exploiting the non-Boolean structure of quantum properties\nto efficiently distinguish between two disjunctive properties, without\ndetermining the truth values of the relevant disjuncts (representing\nthe association of individual inputs to the function with\ncorresponding outputs). The point of the procedure is to avoid the\nevaluation of the function for specific inputs in the determination of\nthe global property, and it is this feature \u2014 impossible in the\nBoolean logic of classical computation \u2014 that leads to the\nspeed-up relative to classical algorithms. (For quantum logic not\nspecifically in relation to quantum computation, see the entry on\n quantum logic and quantum probability).\n\nSome researchers in quantum information and quantum computation have\nargued for an information-theoretic interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. In his review article on quantum computation, Andrew Steane\n(1998, p. 119) makes the following remark:\n\nHistorically, much of fundamental physics has been concerned with\ndiscovering the fundamental particles of nature and the equations\nwhich describe their motions and interactions. It now appears that a\ndifferent programme may be equally important: to discover the ways\nthat nature allows, and prevents, information to be expressed\nand manipulated, rather than particles to move.\n\n\nSteane concludes his review with the following radical proposal (1998,\np. 171):\n\nTo conclude with, I would like to propose a more wide-ranging\ntheoretical task: to arrive at a set of principles like energy and\nmomentum conservation, but which apply to information, and from which\nmuch of quantum mechanics could be derived. Two tests of such ideas\nwould be whether the EPR-Bell correlations thus became transparent,\nand whether they rendered obvious the proper use of terms such as\n\u2018measurement\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019.\n\n\nThere has been considerable research in the framework of so-called\n\u2018generalized probability theories\u2019 or\n\u2018Boxworld\u2019 on the problem of what information-theoretic\nconstraints in the class of \u2018no signaling\u2019 theories would\ncharacterize quantum theories.
