    "main_text": "\n\nThis article is concerned with social and political equality. In its\nprescriptive usage, \u2018equality\u2019 is a highly contested\nconcept. Its normally positive connotation gives it a rhetorical power\nsuitable for use in political slogans (Westen 1990). At least since\nthe French Revolution, equality has served as one of the leading\nideals of the body politic; in this respect, it is at present probably\nthe most controversial of the great social ideals. There is\ncontroversy concerning the precise notion of equality, the relation of\njustice and equality (the principles of equality), the material\nrequirements and measure of the ideal of equality (equality of what?),\nthe extension of equality (equality among whom?), and its status\nwithin a comprehensive (liberal) theory of justice (the value of\nequality). This article will discuss each of these issues in turn.\n",
