    "main_text": "Locke\u2019s natural law theory: the basis of moral obligation || Morality and Teleology\n2.2 Morality and Teleology\n\nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke draws a connection\nbetween the natural law governing human action and the laws of nature\nthat govern all other things in the natural world; just as all natural\nthings seem nomologically determined, so human beings are likewise\nlaw-governed. Humans are not determined to the same degree as other\nphysical and biological entities, but we are beholden to God to ensure\nthat our lives follow a certain path. Natural law is, Locke writes, a\n\u201cplan, rule, or \u2026 pattern\u201d of life (Locke\n1663\u201364, 81). Locke\u2019s early view has a teleological strain\ntypical of the Aquinian (and thus Aristotelian) tradition. In fact,\nLocke does not shy away from this teleological angle, acknowledging\nthis inheritance when he writes of Aristotle\u2019s that he\n\nrightly concludes that the proper function of man is acting in\nconformity with reason, so much so that man must of necessity perform\nwhat reason prescribes. (Locke 1663\u201364, 83)\n\n\nLocke considers moral duty to be tailored to human nature, a set of\nlaws specific to humanity and governing our actions according to God\u2019s\nwill. These laws are not only discoverable by reason, but in order to\nfulfill our function, humans are required to make use of reason to\nthis very end. This view resurfaces in the Essay, where Locke\nwrites the following:\n\nit will become us, as rational Creatures, to imploy those Faculties we\nhave about what they are most adapted to, and follow the direction of\nNature, where it seems to point us out the way. (Essay,\n4.12.11)\n\n\nThe way it points us, he goes on to explain, is in the direction of\nour \u201cgreatest interests, i.e., the Condition of our eternal\nEstate\u201d (Essay, 4.12.11). The greater effort we each\nmake in refining our rational faculty, the more clearly each of us\nwill discern the proper path to eternal salvation.\n\nThis teleological element may seem somewhat out of step with Locke\u2019s\nunqualified empiricist rejection of teleological metaphysics in the\nEssay. However, it is important to bear in mind that the\nteleological aspects of Locke\u2019s moral theory do seem to be serving a\nvery specific purpose. Locke seems to be aiming to establish a\nnatural-theological basis for natural law. Why would this be so\ncrucial for Locke?\n\nLocke is grounding human conduct within a general framework of laws\noriginating in God\u2019s divine command. This is not just a\nnomologically-ordered universe, but one, as we have seen, that\nreflects the interests of \u201ca powerful and wise\ncreator\u2026who has made and built this whole universe and us\nmortals\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364, 103). Humans are obligated to obey\nGod\u2019s laws since God is a superior to whom we owe \u201cboth our\nbeing and our work\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364, 105). As such, we are\nobligated to show obedience to the \u201climits he prescribes\u201d\n(Locke 1663\u201364, 105). The laws governing our nature are\ndiscovered by reason and their content is specifically suited to human\nnature. Thus, for Locke morality is clearly and necessarily\nanthropocentric, understood by reference to human nature. But moral\nrules are, above all, an expression of God\u2019s will. It is this latter\naspect of morality that binds us to abide by the dictates of morality.\nMoral obligation is a matter, for Locke, of obedience to the rightful\nauthority of God.\n",
