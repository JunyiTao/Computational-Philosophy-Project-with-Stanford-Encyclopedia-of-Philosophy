    "main_text": "\n1. Theories of Experience\n\nFor our purposes, a theory of perceptual experience aims to identify a\nfeature that is constitutive of perceptual experience: it is\nshared by all perceptual experiences, and identifies at least part of\ntheir nature. In this section, we will consider various potential\nlinks between theories of experience and the epistemology of\nperception that can be captured with the following template:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences have property \\(P\\).\n\nThe idea here is that experiences have to be a certain way in order to\njustify beliefs. Now, philosophers might accept a particular instance\nof the E-M Link, but disagree about whether experiences are the way\nthey need to be in order to justify beliefs about the external world.\nFor example, Davidson (1986) and McDowell (1994) agree that\nexperiences justify beliefs about the external world only if\nexperiences have contents that can be assessed for truth. Davidson\n(1986) argues that experiences do not justify beliefs about the\nexternal world on the grounds that they lack truth-assessable\ncontents, whereas McDowell (1994) argues that experiences must have\ntruth-assessable contents given that they justify beliefs about the\nexternal world (more on their dispute in\n subsection 1.2).\n\nWe can organize our discussion of such agreements and disagreements\naround the following trio of claims:\n\nEpistemology\n\nOur experiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link\n\nIf our experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then our\nexperiences have property \\(P\\).\n\nMind\n\nOur experiences do not have property \\(P\\).\n\nIf Epistemology and Epistemology-Mind Link are true, then Mind is\nfalse. Something will have to go. Approaches will vary according to\ntheir verdict on what exactly must go.\n\nIn what follows we survey the most prominent instances of the trio. We\nwill start with sense-data theories, then turn to raw feel theories,\nand theories on which experiences have propositional contents. We will\nclose the part by considering the conscious character of\nexperiences.\n\nOur survey of theories of experiences will not be exhaustive, but I\nwill briefly discuss an approach that complicates my framing of the\ndebates in terms of \u201cvisual experiences\u201d. Some have argued\nthat, when the ordinary shopper observes the lemon in the supermarket,\nher visual mental life is not as simple as it seems. In particular,\nrather than having a unitary visual experience, perhaps she has a\nvisual sensation and a visual seeming (Lyons 2005; Tucker 2010;\nBrogaard 2013; Reiland 2015; also Bengson 2015 as a fellow traveler).\nCall this the \u201chybrid\u201d picture of experience.\n\nTo get a feel for the hybrid picture, consider a contrast between an\nexpert bird-watcher and an ordinary perceiver, both observing a\nnorthern bobwhite. The hybrid theorist would say that they have the\nsame rudimentary visual sensation in some way involving colors and\nshapes, with only the expert has a visual seeming specifically to the\neffect that a northern bobwhite is present. Here the visual sensation\nshared by the expert and novice is sensory in character, but the\nseeming had only by the expert is itself not sensory. (For further\nexamples, see the opening of Tucker 2010).\n\nThe seeming might even be sharable in principle with subjects who lack\nvisual consciousness altogether (Tucker 2010, also Lyons 2005 with\ndifferent terminology, Brogaard 2013 however disagrees that visual\nseemings can be detached so far from visual sensation). That seemings\nare not sensory does not obviously entail that they are perceptually\namodal entirely, Lyons for instance seems to tie down his\n\u201cnonexperiential looks\u201d to different perceptual modalities\nsuch as vision or audition.\n\nThe example of the novice vs. the expert is suggestive, but what we\nhave said so far leaves open the respective natures of sensations and\nseemings, as well as of how visual experiences are to be understood in\nrelation to them. Given all of this indeterminacy, as well as the room\nfor debate about whether we even have good reason to complicate the\nstructure of visual experience in this way (see Chudnoff and\nDidomenico 2015 for criticisms), the discussion below will be framed\nsimply in terms of visual experiences. That said, the discussion\nshould remain applicable to experiences understood as combinations of\nsome sort of sensations and seemings. The discussion should also in\nprinciple be adaptable to apply individually to sensations only or to\nseemings only, depending on the reader\u2019s preferred category. At\nsome key stages we will explicitly highlight where the distinction\nmight be especially useful to apply and explore.\n1.1 Sense-datum Theories\n\nOn sense-datum theories, whenever you have a visual experience as if\nthere is something present that is red, there really is something\npresent that is red\u2014a sense-datum. Now, in many cases of\nillusions and hallucination, there won\u2019t be any ordinary red\nthing around for you to experience even if there seems to you to be a\nred thing present. So sense-data are either going to be mental objects\nor strange non-mental objects. Sense-datum theories usually depart\nfrom the following principle:\n\nThe Phenomenal Principle\n\nWhenever you visually experience it to be that case that something is\n\\(F\\), then there is something \\(F\\)\nthat you experience (Robinson 1994).\n\nLet\u2019s first examine an epistemological case for sense-datum\ntheories. Here the direction of flow is from epistemology to the\nphilosophy of mind. We can find it in the following famous quote from\nH.H. Price:\n\n\nWhen I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt \u2026 One thing\nhowever I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and\nsomewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other\ncolour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole\nfield of colour is presented to my consciousness \u2026 (Price 1932:\n3).\n\n\nOn Price\u2019s line of thought, perceptual experiences do afford us\nwith some certainty. When Price sees a tomato, he may be certain that\nthere is something red and round present. According to critics of the\nargument, Price is not entitled to be certain of any such thing. For\nexample, his experience might merely represent that there exists\nsomething red and round present, where such representation can occur\neven if nothing red and round is present (for more on this objection\nsee the entry on\n the problem of perception\n (section 3.1.2).\n\nLet\u2019s now turn to the status of beliefs about ordinary objects\nin the external world, and the flow from the philosophy of mind to\nepistemology. We can organize our discussion under the following\ninstance of the trio:\n\nEpistemology\n\nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 1\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences are not relations to sense-data.\n\nMind 1\n\nExperiences are relations to sense-data.\n\nIn principle, a sense-datum theorist might accept E-M Link 1 and Mind\n1, and conclude that Epistemology is false. For example, she might\ntake up a coherence theory of justification, on which our beliefs\nabout the external world are justified by their coherence with each\nother and not by experiences (see the entry on\n sense-data\n (section 3.2).\n\nIn the usual line of discussion, philosophers affirm Epistemology and\nE-M Link 1, and conclude that Mind 1 is false (see Berkeley 1710/2008:\nsect 18 or Reid 1764/1997: ch. 1). Sense-datum theories tell us that\nthe things we are directly aware of in perceptual experience are not\nordinary external objects. As the common metaphor has it, sense-data\ntheories draw a veil of ideas over the world. The usual\nobjection holds that this veil makes it impossible for us to gain\nknowledge or justified belief from experience about the external\nworld. Philosophers such as Berkeley and Reid reject sense-datum\ntheories on the grounds that we do have epistemic access to the\nworld.\n\nIn response, the sense-datum theorist might deny E-M Link 1. In\nparticular, the theorist might say that experiences justify beliefs\nabout the external world when complemented with reflection on how they\nare best explained (Russell 1912). Call this the IBE approach since it\nconcerns Inferences to the Best Explanation of our experiences (see\nVogel 1990 for more contemporary discussion). Setting aside debate\nabout how such an explanation might go, and why it might be the best,\nthe response might not go far enough.\n\nTo see why the IBE approach might not go far enough, consider the idea\nthat experiences provide non-inferential justification for\nbeliefs about the external world. If experiences provide\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world,\nthey justify beliefs through a route that does not involve further\nbeliefs. Compare how your sharp pain might justify you directly in\nbelieving that you are in pain, without further beliefs playing any\nrole. Contrast how your thermometer might justify you in believing you\nhave a fever only in conjunction with your having reason to believe\nthe thermometer works. Non-inferential justification is justification\nthat does not involve auxiliary beliefs (see Pryor 2005 for more\ndetail).\n\nOn the IBE approach, it seems that experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world.\nThat\u2019s because they justify us only in conjunction with whatever\nbeliefs their best explanation brings in. Experiences arguably do\nbetter (Johnston 2006). The veil of ideas objection might then be\nbetter put as follows:\n\nEpistemology1\n\nExperiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about the\nexternal world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 2\n\nIf experiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about\nthe external world, then experiences are not relations to\nsense-data.\n\nSo,\n\nnot-Mind 1\n\nExperiences are not relations to sense-data.\n\nEven still, it is unclear why sense-datum theories should rule out\ngetting non-inferential justification from experiences. Perhaps if a\nsense-datum theory is true, we at best see external objects\nindirectly, by means of seeing sense-data. But this is only a point\nabout seeing. Our justification for beliefs could still be\nnon-inferential (Moore 1953; Silins 2011). The crucial question for\nnon-inferential justification is about the role of background beliefs,\nand the mental process of indirect perception need not make use of\nbackground beliefs. For instance, whether you indirectly perceive\nobjects by means of sense-data might instead just be a matter of how\nthe sense-data are caused, leaving open the possibility that you gain\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world\nfrom sense-data.\n\nLet\u2019s now zoom out to a big picture assessment of the epistemic\nimplications of sense-datum theories.\n\nThe thought driving the veil of ideas worry is that if experiences\nfail to put us in direct contact with reality, then they cannot\njustify beliefs about external reality. This thought is meant to get\nus to the conclusion that sense datum theory is false. But it might go\ntoo far.\n\nThe first ramification concerns seeing objects. According to many\nviews, we see ordinary extended objects by seeing their surfaces,\nrather than seeing them directly (see Moore 1918 or Broad 1952, and\nClarke 1965 or Campbell 2004 for dispute). As far as seeing objects\ngoes, their facing surfaces play the same role as sense-data did on\nmany versions of the sense-datum theory\u2014intermediaries not\nidentical with objects that still permit us to see objects by seeing\nthem. But now, if we endorse the veil of ideas objection, there is a\nrisk that the facing surfaces of objects will be a veil over the rest\nof external reality. Call this the veil of surfaces. Our\nexperiences might fail to give us access to whether we live in a world\nof ever shifting facades or instead a world of three-dimensional\nobjects as they are ordinarily conceived. Descartes arguably states\nthis problem when he writes:\n\n\nI remember that, when looking from a window and saying I see men who\npass in the street, I really do not see them, but infer that what I\nsee is men, just as I say that I see wax. And yet what do I see from\nthe window but hats and coats which may cover automatic machines? (PW,\np. 21 )\n\n\nIf the veil of ideas objection succeeds against sense-data theories,\nit might also rule out the theory that we directly perceive only\nsurfaces. It is not clear whether the objection can get us that\nfar.\n\nThe veil of ideas objection also has controversial ramifications for\ncases of illusion or hallucination. When something looks red to you\nwhen it isn\u2019t, or when you have a hallucination of a bloody\ndagger in front of you, your experience fails to put you in direct\ncontact with reality as it is. According to many approaches, your\nexperience might still\u2014misleadingly\u2014justify you in\nbelieving that reality is the way it visually appears to be. However,\nif the thought driving the veil of ideas objection is correct,\nexperiences only justify in those cases when you are seeing things as\nthey are. This is quite a demanding view, one that rules out\njustification in a wide range of cases where many think it is present.\n(For more discussion of views that exclude perceptual justification\nfrom cases of illusion or hallucination,\n see section 2.2.).\n1.2 Raw Feel Theories\n\nAccording to sense-data theories, all visual experiences relate us to\nobjects with the properties attributed by our visual experiences. At\nan opposite extreme, one might hold that experiences are \u201craw\nfeels\u201d, failing to present the world to us in any way. To get a\nfeel for this line of thought, consider the experience of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d. According to some views, your experience\nhere is a mere sensation, failing to present your surroundings to you\n(cf. Smith 2002: 130\u20131). On these views, the expression of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d is extremely misleading here, as you do not\nliterally see stars, and do not even figuratively see anything\nelse\u2014it is not as if your experience is of anything in the\nscene. According to raw feel theory, all visual experiences are in\nfact like this, not just exceptional ones. As Bonjour puts it, we\ncapture what our visual experiences are like \u201cin terms of\npatches of color arranged in two-dimensional visual space\u201d\n(2001: 32). (For a survey of views that could fall under the heading\nof \u201craw feel theory\u201d as used here, see entry on\n contents of perception\n (section 2.1).\n\nIn a passage from \u201cA Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge\u201d, Donald Davidson can be read as using raw feel theory\nto argue for a skeptical epistemological conclusion:\n\n\nThe relation between a sensation and a belief cannot be logical, since\nsensations are not beliefs or other propositional attitudes. What then\nis the relation? The answer is, I think, obvious: the relation is\ncausal. Sensations cause some beliefs and in this sense are the basis\nor ground of those beliefs. But a causal explanation of a belief does\nnot show how or why the belief is justified. (1986: 310)\n\n\nBy itself, the view that experiences are raw feels is silent about\nwhether experiences are able to justify beliefs about the external\nworld. To get to conclusions about epistemology, some sort of linking\nprinciple is needed. Davidson\u2019s idea is that a source can supply\njustification only if it has propositional content, so that the source\nis assessable as accurate or inaccurate, depending on whether the\nrelevant proposition is true. On this way of setting up the issues, an\nexperience has \u201cpropositional content\u201d by having content\nthat is assessable for truth (for further elaboration of the idea that\nexperiences have propositional content, see the entry on\n the contents of perception).\n Given Davidson\u2019s demand, experiences would be unable to justify\nbeliefs if they were merely raw feels or sensations. (For important\nprecedents to Davidson here, see Sellars 1956 and Popper 1959: chapter\n5. For further contemporary discussion, see Bonjour 1985; McDowell\n1994; Brewer 1999; and Pryor 2005.).\n\nWe can sketch the issues raised by Davidson with the following\ninstance of our trio:\n\nEpistemology\n\nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 3\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences have propositional content.\n\nMind 2\n\nExperiences are raw feels without propositional content.\n\nThe Davidsonian response to the trio is to accept E-M Link 3 and Mind\n2, but to deny Epistemology.\n\nA different response to the trio accepts E-M Link3, but uses\nEpistemology to reject Mind 2. This position was occupied by McDowell\n1994 and Brewer 1999 (although they later revised their views in\nBrewer 2006 and McDowell 2009).\n\nLet us focus on debate about E-M Link 3, the common ground between\nDavidson, McDowell and Brewer. It can be resisted by raw feel\ntheorists, as well as by non-raw feel theorists who fall short of\nattributing propositional contents to experiences.\n\nWhy believe E-M Link 3 at all? Davidson\u2019s own case appeals to\nthe claim that, in order for an experience to justify a belief, the\nexperience must make more probable or entail the content of the belief\n(he also uses the further assumption that only propositional contents\ncan do any such thing). It\u2019s not clear why all raw feel\ntheorists must accept the demand. Think back to the experience of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d, and suppose that the experience is indeed\na raw feel. The experience might still justify the belief that you are\nhaving that particular experience. Analogously, if pains are best\nunderstood as raw feels, they arguably could still justify you in\nbelieving that you have them. Now, if experiences could lack\npropositional contents and still justify you in believing you have\nthem, why couldn\u2019t they still also justify beliefs about the\nexternal world? In particular, at least if background beliefs are\nallowed to play a role, it seems perfectly possible for beliefs about\nthe external world to be justified thanks to the availability of\ninferences linking particular raw feels with particular conditions of\nthe external world. The justificatory structure here would look like\nthis:\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\left. \\begin{array}{ccc} \\text{raw feel} &\n\\rightarrow & \\text{self-ascription of raw feel} \\\\ & & +\n\\\\ & & \\text{auxiliary belief}\\end{array} \\right\\} &\n\\rightarrow & \\text{external world belief} \\end{array} \\]\n\n\n(For a contemporary view with this sort of structure, see Bonjour\n2001).\n\nOne also might try to meet the spirit of the demand that justifiers\nincrease probability or entail without attributing propositional\ncontents to experiences. Here it\u2019s important to note the rich\nrange of ways in which experiences might be directed at the world.\nMany of these ways need not involve propositional content.\n\nFirst, even if experiences lack contents that are assessable for\ntruth, experiences might still have contents that are assessable for\naccuracy. Burge 2010 suggests that experiences have non-propositional\ncontents of the form \u2018that \\(F\\)\u2019, and are\naccurate just in case the referent has the property \\(F\\).\nAlternatively, consider how a map or picture might\nbe accurate or inaccurate without being true or false. When\nexperiences are accurate in either of these ways, other contents of\nbeliefs will be true. So experiences could lack propositional\ncontents, but still count as close enough to entailing the contents of\nbeliefs or to increasing the probability of the contents of\nbeliefs.\n\nSecond, experiences might lack contents altogether, and not be\nassessable for truth or accuracy, but still be related in important\nways to relations to the world such as seeing (Campbell 2002; McDowell\n2009; Brewer 2006, 2011). According to these approaches that resist\nthe ascription of content to experiences, your experience justifies a\nbelief about the world only when your experience is a case of seeing\nthe world as it is. You can see the world as it is only if it is in\nfact that way. Here many of your experiences might be supremely\npositioned to justify whether or not they have any content. (For more\nabout such approaches,\n see subsection 2.2.).\n\nIn sum, raw feel theorists might be in a good position to reject E-M\nLink 3. Moreover, even if experiences are not raw feels, they might\nalso lack propositional contents, and still be directed at the world\nin a way that helps them to justify beliefs.\n1.3 Perceptual Content\n\nLet us now turn to more fine-grained connections between contents of\nexperience and perceptual justification, focusing on contents of\nexperience that can be assessed for truth.\n1.3.1 Necessity of Content\n\nFirst, is having specifically the content that \\(p\\)\nnecessary for an experience to justify believing that \\(p\\)?\nHere is a first pass at capturing the issue:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link4\n\nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you justification\nto believe some external world proposition that \\(p\\),\nthen \\(e\\) has the content that \\(p\\).\n\nA challenge comes from cases when you use an experience and background\nbeliefs to extrapolate far beyond any content the experience might\nhave. For example, when I have an experience in New York with the\ncontent that the traffic light is red, my background beliefs enable\nthe experience to justify me in believing that cars might still be\npermitted to turn right. But this legally informed belief is in a\ncontent that most likely does not figure in my experience.\n\nTo accommodate extrapolation beyond experience thanks to auxiliary\nbeliefs, the simplest response is to focus on non-inferential\njustification that does not involve auxiliary beliefs.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link5\n\nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you\nnon-inferential justification to believe some external world\nproposition that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\) has\nthe content that \\(p\\).\n\nIf Link5 is true, it allows for rich connections between theories of\nperceptual experience and theories of perceptual justification.\nConsider for instance the debate about \u201chigh-level\u201d\ncontent. Very roughly, this debate is about whether our experiences\nmerely represent colors, shapes and locations, or whether they\nrepresent thicker properties or relations such as causing an\nexplosion, being a fake Louis Vuitton bag, being virtuous, or being\nglad to see you (for more see the entry on\n the contents of perception).\n If Link5 is true, and we have non-inferential justification for\nbelief in high-level contents, it will follow that some of our\nexperiences have high-level contents as well. But how to establish\nthat our experiences give us non-inferential justification for some\nhigh-level beliefs?\n\nOne route is to try to leverage the psychological immediacy of our\nformation of some high-level beliefs. When the fashionista sees the\ndroopy bag marked \u201cLouis Vuitton\u201d in a cheap Shenzhen\nmall, she does not need to pull out her lighter to test whether the\nmaterial melts likes plastic. Instead she forms her belief that the\nbag is a fake Louis Vuitton without any conscious reflection.\nLikewise, we don\u2019t need to puzzle out whether our loved ones are\npresent when we see them\u2014we seem to recognize them on the basis\nof our experiences without reasoning. Still, it may be that auxiliary\nbeliefs are playing a role in all these examples while remaining\nunconscious. The psychological immediacy of belief formation\nneedn\u2019t go along with non-inferential justification (see\nMcDowell 1982).\n\nFor further discussion of how to show we have non-inferential\njustification from experiences for some beliefs in high-level\ncontents, and of whether the experiences themselves would need to have\nhigh-level contents to do so, see Millar 2000, McDowell 2009, or\nSilins 2013.\n\nFor further defense of the claim that an experience justifies a belief\nonly if it has a content identical with that of the belief, see\nMcDowell 1994 and Brewer 1999. For critical responses, see Speaks 2005\nand Byrne 2005.\n1.3.2 Sufficiency of Content\n\nIs having the content that \\(p\\) enough for an\nexperience to justifying you believing that \\(p\\)? Here\nis a first pass at capturing the idea:\n\nSufficiency First Pass\n\nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that\n\\(p\\), then \\(e\\) gives you\njustification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nThe Sufficiency thesis is not formulated in terms of non-inferential\njustification. For all it says, whenever an experience justifies a\nbelief, it does so only in a way involving the assistance of an\nauxiliary belief. Still, the picture does mesh well with views on\nwhich experiences give non-inferential justification, and we may\nunderstand it in those terms in what follows.\n\nOur thesis does need to be qualified. For example, suppose that you\ngain convincing evidence that you are the victim of an illusion, as\nwhen you learn that the lines of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion are the\nsame in length even though they look to be different in length:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. M\u00fcller-Lyer\n illusion[1]\n\n\nYour experience does not give you justification to believe that the\nlines are different in length once you have gain the evidence they are\nthe same in length. Such cases are ones of \u201cdefeat\u201d, where\nfurther evidence opposes or otherwise disrupts your receipt of\njustification from your experience (some cases may be like someone\nwriting over the graffiti drawn by experience, other cases may be like\nsomeone erasing the graffiti drawn by experience, and perhaps there\nare further variants of defeat as well). To take account of such\ncases, the fan of Sufficiency can say that\n\nSufficiency\n\nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that\n\\(p\\), then \\(e\\) gives you defeasible\njustification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nHere the core idea is that your experience gives you justification\nunless you have gained evidence that your experience is\nmisleading.\n\nFor defenses of theses along the lines of Sufficiency, see Pollock\n(1974), Pryor (2000) or Huemer (2001, 2007). Their strategies put much\nweight on what it is like to have an experience (see more in\n section 2.4\n on this sort of strategy). A different approach tries to exploit the\nway that experiences come to have their contents, for example by\narguing that experiences are likely to have true or accurate contents\ngiven the way they come to have their contents. For examples of this\nstrategy, see Burge 2003, Peacocke 2004, Sawyer and Majors 2005, and\nSetiya 2012: ch. 3.\n\nThe Sufficiency thesis also promises to establish rich connections\nbetween epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Consider again the\ndebate about high-level contents of experience. If one is able to\nestablish that experiences have high-level contents, one could then\nuse the Sufficiency thesis to reach the conclusion that experiences\njustify beliefs in high-level contents as well.\n\nAssuming that experiences with the content that \\(p\\)\nwill give non-inferential justification for a belief that \\(p\\),\nwe could then have an answer to an important\nquestion for foundationalist views in epistemology. These are views on\nwhich our inferentially justified beliefs about the external world are\ninferred from a foundation of non-inferentially justified beliefs (for\nmore see the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification).\n Which beliefs get to be in the foundation? This question for\nfoundationalist views is pressing. As Nozick remarks, it is of little\nuse to have a foundation for our knowledge that is only one brick wide\n(1981: 3). In general, the more restrictive foundationalist views are\nabout the breadth of our foundational beliefs, the harder it will be\nto build up to everyday beliefs about the world. However, if beliefs\nconcerning causation, emotions, or morality get to be foundational,\nthe foundationalist project can look much more promising (Masrour\n2011).\n\nAs helpful as the Sufficiency thesis could be for foundationalists, it\nfaces much criticism. Many objections proceed by proposing\nrequirements for justification that are not always satisfied when one\nhas an experience with a given content. For example, one might demand\nthat the experience be a case of seeing\n (section 2.2 of this entry),\n or demand that the experience be suitably free of top-down influence\nfrom one\u2019s own mind\n (section 2.4 of this entry).\n (For further objections, see McGrath 2017 or Chudnoff 2018).\n\nHere we will focus on objections that turn on the character of\nperceptual content. The objection here is known as \u201cthe problem\nof the speckled hen\u201d (see Chisholm 1942; Sosa in Sosa and\nBonjour 2003; Markie 2009 for different versions of the problem).\n\nTo get a feel for our problem, suppose you get a look at a speckled\nhen in good light, but without enough time to carefully count the\nnumber of speckles on it.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. \u201cSpeckled Sussex Hen\nnamed Mata\n Hari\u201d[2]\n\n\nThe objection to Sufficiency can be put as follows. First, your\nexperience does have a verdict about how many spots face you\u2014say\nto the effect that \\(H\\) has 17 spots. Second, your\nexperience does not justify you in believing that \\(H\\)\nhas 17 spots. After all, forming a belief that \\(H\\)\nhas 17 spots without carefully counting might manifestly seem no more\nlikely to be right than a guess. So, the critic concludes, some\nexperiences have the content that \\(p\\) without giving\nyou justification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nIn response, some argue that your experience is actually silent about\nthe exact number of speckles facing you on the hen (see Tye 2009; for\nmore on experience and numeracy, see Beck 2012).\n\nOne can raise the core challenge to Sufficiency in other ways. Another\nsource of examples can be found in Block\u2019s (2007) empirically\ninformed work on \u201cphenomenal overflow\u201d (drawing on\nSperling 1960 and Lamme 2003). Consider for example the Sperling\nparadigm, in which subjects are flashed a grid of letters, and only\nsubsequently given a tone that indicates which row to report (high for\nthe top, medium for the middle, etc). Subjects are able to report any\nrow singled out without being able to report them all. (For an online\ndemo without sound, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n Arguably subjects experience all the letters as they are without\nbeing able to report them all (but see Stazicker 2011 or Phillips 2011\nfor criticisms of Block, also Odegaard et al 2018). The objector may\nadd that we do not have justification from our experience to believe\nthe proposition that enumerates all the letters present. (For a\nfurther way to set up the speckled hen problem, using the example of\nhighly determinate colors, see Smithies 2019: ch. 11).\n\nEven if one allows that some experiences have enough determinacy to\nset up the speckled hen problem, the option remains of maintaining\nthat the experiences do give you justification to believe the relevant\ndeterminate proposition. For example, perhaps your experiences do give\nyou justification to believe the determinate proposition, even though\nyou are unable to take advantage of the justification you have by\nforming a belief on their basis (see Smithies 2012a for a view with\nthis structure).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps speckled hen cases are compatible with\nSufficiency since they turn out to be cases of defeat. Given that we\nare generally aware of our poor ability to make snap judgments about\nthe details of the scene before, perhaps we have defeasible but\ndefeated justification to believe detailed propositions about the\nscene before us.\n1.3.3 Intentionalism\n\nSo far we have focused on the ramifications for epistemology of the\nview that experiences have propositional contents. Intentionalism is a\nmore ambitious view in the philosophy of mind that aims to find\nnecessary connections between the conscious character of an\nexperience\u2014what it is like to have it\u2014and the content of\nthat experience. According to intentionalists, at a minimum,\n\nMinimal Intentionalism\n\nIf experiences \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) have the same content, then what it\nis like to have \\(e_1\\) is the same as what it is like to have\n\\(e_2\\).\n\nIn a slogan, \u201csame content, same character\u201d (for\ndiscussion of further variations in the camp, see Chalmers 2004). On\nthis picture, if two experiences present the same testimony about the\nworld, there is no room for any difference in what it is like to have\nthose experiences. Whether there is such a tight link between content\nand conscious character is controversial, consider the frequently\ndiscussed possibility that your shifting attention could vary the\nconscious character of two distinct experiences without varying their\ntestimony about the world.\n\nHere we will point to some epistemological ramifications of the\nview.\n\nOne way to defend Intentionalism examines how we become\nintrospectively aware of what it\u2019s like to have our experiences.\nArguably we become introspectively aware of what it\u2019s like to\nhave our experiences only by being aware of what we are experiencing.\nPerhaps awareness of the world is the sole route to introspective\nawareness of what it\u2019s like to have a given experience. And\nperhaps this point about introspection supports at least a minimal\nversion of Intentionalism. For further discussion of this broadly\nepistemological argument for intentionalism, see the entry on\n qualia\n (section 6), also the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness\n (section 3.3).\n\nAnother defense of Intentionalism examines how we become able to think\nabout certain properties by having experiences. Perhaps experiences\nare sufficient for certain cognitive abilities, and perhaps\nIntentionalism gives the best explanation of how experiences are\nsufficient for certain cognitive abilities. For an exposition of this\nbroadly epistemological line of argument for Intentionalism, see Pautz\n2010.\n\nFor an epistemological argument against some versions of\nIntentionalism, see Kriegel 2011. He targets versions of the view that\naim to find what constitutes experience in terms of awareness of\nproperties (or a suitably similar relation to properties). According\nto Kriegel, just as sense-data theories are unable to provide an\nadequate epistemology because of the \u201cveil of appearances\u201d\nthey impose between perceivers and the world, the targeted versions of\nIntentionalism fail to provide an adequate epistemology for the same\nreason. As we saw in\n section 2.1,\n sense-data theorists have ways to respond to veil objections. Perhaps\nintentionalists do as well.\n1.4 Consciousness\n1.4.1 Does consciousness play a justifying role?\n\nAn uncontroversial theory of perceptual experiences holds that they\nall have a conscious character\u2014for any experience \\(e\\)\nthere is something it is like to have \\(e\\).\nFurther, part of what it is for something to be an\nexperience is for it to have a conscious character. There is much\ndebate about how to explain the nature of perceptual consciousness,\nbut there is little debate about whether something is an experience\nonly if it has a conscious character.\n\nThere is much more room for debate about the importance of\nconsciousness for the epistemology of perception. One strategy of\nexplaining how experiences justify beliefs focuses on their conscious\ncharacter. We may call it the phenomenal approach.\n\nTo see why this approach is a contender, consider subjects who have\n\u201cblindsight\u201d. They have visual representations of\nwhat\u2019s in their blind field without having conscious visual\nexperience of anything in their blind field (see Weiskrantz 2009 for a\nsurvey, and Phillips and Block 2016 for a debate about whether there\nreally is unconscious perception). Now these subjects are better than\nchance at identifying objects in their blind field, but they have to\nbe prompted to make a guess. For our purposes, imagine a hypothetical\nblindsighted subject who does not need to be prompted to form a belief\nthat there is an \\(X\\) to the left. Now compare that\nsubject with an ordinary sighted subject who forms a belief that there\nis an \\(X\\) to the left on the basis of visual\nexperience. There are various questions here whose answers might\nsupport the phenomenal approach (see Smithies 2012a, 2019: ch. 3 for\nmore).\n\nFirst, is the blindsighted subject completely unjustified in believing\nthat there is an \\(X\\) to the left? If you think the\nanswer to this question is yes, and you\u2019re not a skeptic about\nthe sighted subject, you arguably should be sympathetic to the\nphenomenal approach. What else would explain this difference between\nthem?\n\nSecond, is the blindsighted subject at any rate less justified than\nthe sighted subject in believing that there is an \\(X\\)\nto the left? If you think the answer here is yes, again you arguably\nshould be sympathetic to the phenomenal approach. What else would\nexplain this epistemic difference between them?\n\nIn response, one might deny that the epistemic differences obtain (see\nLyons 2009, also Berger 2020). Even if one accepts that the epistemic\ndifferences obtain, one might still insist that they are equally or\nbetter explained by alternative candidates than consciousness. For\nexample, perhaps the blindsighted subject does not count as seeing the\n\\(X\\), and perhaps the sighted subject is more\njustified than the blindsighted subject simply thanks to seeing the\n\\(X\\) (as an \\(X\\)). Here the\nexplanatory burden would be borne by bearing a perceptual relation to\nthe thing, rather than having an experience with a certain\ncharacter.\n\nHere it might help to compare the sighted subject with a conscious\nsubject for whom things are just the same from the inside, but who\nfails to see any \\(X\\) because she is hallucinating. If\nthe sighted subject and the hallucinating subject are equally\njustified in believing there is an \\(X\\) to the left,\nvisual experience might be a better candidate than seeing to explain\nthe epistemic symmetry between the sighted and the hallucinating\nsubjects.\n\nSuppose the blindsighted subject and sighted subject are equally\njustified\u2014is the phenomenal approach then doomed? Speaking\nloosely, even if the blindsighted subject has the same epistemic\neffect as the sighted subject, it\u2019s not entirely clear that\nthere must be the same cause (or perhaps there is a common unconscious\ncause present even in the sighted subject).\n\nTo support the claim that consciousness doesn\u2019t supply\nperceptual justification, one might look to other real-life cases of\nunconscious visual representation. One sort of case is that of\nunconscious priming. Here you are exposed to a stimulus too quickly\nfor it to register in visual experience, but for all that it still\ndoes affect your behavior. For example, an unconsciously registered\nnumeral might improve your ability to report that a subsequently seen\nnumeral is greater or lower than 5, depending on whether the priming\none is itself greater or lower than 5 (Naccache and Dehaene 2001). Now\nthis sort of case is arguably not one in which unconscious visual\nrepresentations justify. The subjects concerned plausibly do not form\nbeliefs that are good candidates to be justified by their unconscious\nvisual representations. But consider people with visual hemi-neglect,\nwho seem to lack conscious visual experience of their neglected\nfield.\n\nSome neglect patients seem to take in information about the neglected\nstimuli, and to form beliefs about it. For instance, some of them,\nwhen presented with a burning house in their neglected field and a\nnormal house in their normal field, prefer the one that isn\u2019t on\nfire (Marshall and Halligan 1988; Bisiach and Rusconi 1990). Here they\ndo form a belief that is a candidate to be justified by their\nunconscious visual representation. Their belief that the house in\ntheir neglected field isn\u2019t preferable might be justified by the\ninformation they take in, even if the intake is through unconscious\nperception. If this case is one in which the subject is justified, and\njustified to the same degree as in ordinary cases of conscious\nperception, one might then start to wonder whether consciousness must\nplay a role even in ordinary cases of perceptual justification.\nPerhaps it is side-stepped by unconscious visual representations even\nthen.\n1.4.2 What aspect of consciousness plays a justifying role?\n\nIf the conscious character of experiences does play a justifying role,\na further question remains about why it does so. One might hold that\nthere is no further explanation to be provided here. Perhaps the\ncapacity of consciousness to justify is a fundamental fact of\nepistemology. According to another proposal, consciousness justifies\nthanks to being introspectively accessible. On this internalist\nconception of justification, a special kind of access to a source is\nnecessary for the source to provide justification, and consciousness\nstands out for allowing this sort of access (see e.g. Smithies 2012b,\n2019).\n\nHere we will focus on a particular aspect of the conscious character\nof experiences, one highlighted by Pryor (2000) among others. To get a\nfeel for this feature if you are sighted, first look away from this\nsurface and imagine a black circle in front of you. Now look at this\nsurface and have a visual experience of the black circle in front of\nyou constituting the period ending this sentence.\n\nIn the former case, you were not justified in believing that there is\na black circle in front of you. In the present case, you are. One\ncandidate way to explain the epistemic difference is to focus on a\ndifference between what it is like to imagine and what it is like to\nhave a visual experience (see Martin 2002 for more).\n\nThe salient feature of experience here is not easy to pin down. The\nrough idea is that, when you visually experience, as opposed to when\nyou visually imagine, things are presented to you as actually being\nthe case. How this feature of experience is best to be understood is\nopen to debate. For now let us leave open its exact nature and simply\nuse the term \u201cpresentational phenomenology\u201d as a\nplace-holder for whatever it is (for more elaboration see Chudnoff\n2012 or Bengson 2015, and see Teng 2018 for a challenge to privileging\npresentational phenomenology).\n\nEven if presentational phenomenology is epistemically privileged,\nthere remains an important question about its scope. Suppose you see a\ncow through a picket fence. There is arguably some way you\nperceptually \u201cget\u201d that there is an extended cow there.\nFor a dramatic contrast, start by considering Damien Hirst\u2019s\n Some Comfort Gained From the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in Everything,\n that consists of a cow vertically sliced into a series of boxes\narranged like dominos. Now suppose you know you are seeing the Hirst\nsculpture through a picket fence, where the segments align exactly\nwith the gaps in the fence. Here you arguably would not perceptually\n\u201cget\u201d that there is an elongated cow there.\n\nIn the ordinary case of seeing a cow through a picket fence, it is\ndebatable whether presentational phenomenology includes the presence\nof an extended cow, or whether it includes only those regions of the\ncow not occluded by the fence (see Noe 2005 for further discussion).\nIf your presentational phenomenology includes only the non-occluded\nregions, and only presentational phenomenology supplies perceptual\njustification, the rational powers of experience threaten to be\nlimited. You would not have justification to believe that an extended\ncow is present just by taking your experience of the cow through the\nslats at face value. Analogously, if only the facing surface of an\nobject is phenomenally present, you might have justification to\nbelieve only that the facing surface is present by taking your\nexperience at face value. Here we might find ourselves back at the\n\u201cveil of surfaces\u201d discussed in\n section 2.2.\n\nSome might accept this prediction. In his 2018a and 2018b, Chudnoff in\neffect does. He compares seeing an ordinary occluded dog with seeing\nan unfamiliar occluded blob, and claims that our visual experience in\nsuch cases has presentational phenomenology only with respect to what\nis not occluded, and gives us immediate justification for beliefs with\nrespect to only what is not occluded. On his view, our background\ninformation about dogs picks up the slack to enable us to have a\njustified belief about the full shape of the dog, whereas no\nbackground information is available for us to have a justified belief\nabout the full shape of the occluded blob. In response, Helton and\nNanay 2018 in effect argue that Chudnoff\u2019s view threatens to\nlead to skepticism about ordinary beliefs about occluded objects, and\nunderestimates the powers of visual experience with respect to novel\noccluded objects. To avoid potential skeptical problems, some may\nprefer to take a more expansive view of presentational\nphenomenology.\n1.5 Degreed Perception\n\nWe have spoken so far about experiences justifying beliefs in an all\nor nothing way. As Munton 2016 reminds us, visual experiences can\njustify the same belief to differing degrees. For example, suppose you\nare looking outside at the park on a foggy and snowy morning, and\ngradually get a better view of a new snowman as the fog clears. Here\nyour successive visual experiences of the snowman justify your belief\nthat there is a snowman in the park more and more as the fog clears.\nPerceptual justification comes in degrees.\n\nA caution about how to set up the issue is in order. If you think that\nperceptual justification is only binary and does not come in degrees,\nyou should avoid the following common formulation of that sort of\nview: either your experience justifies a belief that there is a\nsnowman in the park or it does not. We can all agree that the law of\nexcluded middle applies to perceptual justification, that\ndoesn\u2019t yet rule out the possibility that perceptual\njustification comes in degrees. For example, perhaps your experience\njustifies a belief when the degree of justification it gives is\nsufficiently high, and otherwise not. This is a scenario in which your\nexperience either justifies a belief or it does not, as well as a\nscenario where perceptual justification comes in degrees.\n\nAccording to Munton, we can now draw a conclusion about the nature of\nvisual experiences, in effect using the template we have surveyed so\nfar (I focus on Munton\u2019s argument because she puts epistemology\nfront and center. A related argument by Morrison 2016 instead focuses\non variations in what happens when we form opinions by completely\ntrusting our experiences, but this argument departs from psychology\nrather than epistemology).\n\nAs a first pass we can try the following:\n\nEpistemology2 Our experiences justify beliefs about the external\nworld to varying degrees.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link6 If our experiences justify beliefs about the\nexternal world to varying degrees, then our experiences are themselves\ndegreed.\n\nSo,\n\nMind3 Our experiences are themselves degreed.\n\nThe conclusion that experiences are degreed is striking and important,\nbut it can be elaborated in quite different ways.\n\nOne choice point is where to locate potential variation in degrees.\nOne option would be in the contents of the experiences, another would\nbe in the mental relation we bear to contents or to the world in\nhaving an experience (variation in principle could be located in the\nvehicles of experiences as well or somewhere else). A further choice\npoint is about how to understand variations in degrees of experiences.\nA tempting option is to piggyback on probabilistic theorizing about\ncredences or degrees of belief (but bear in mind that in principle\nexperiences could be degreed without being degreed in a probabilistic\nway). The idea here is to cash out the idea that experiences are\ndegreed in a similar way to how philosophers cash out the idea that\ncredences are degreed (without necessarily saying that experiences\nsimply are credences). So just as you might have a higher credence\nthat the 4-sided die will land 4 than the 6-sided die might land 4,\nperhaps you also have a higher visual credence that there is a snowman\nout there when the fog is lighter, as opposed to when the fog is\nheavier. Now, how to understand credences themselves is open to\ndispute, where again dimensions of variation might be located in\ndiffering mental relations to the content that the die will land 4, or\npotentially instead in different contents concerning 1/6 probabilities\nas opposed to 1/6 probabilities. Also, even if credences are\nthemselves best understood in probabilistic terms, that is not yet to\nsay that credences are best understood specifically in Bayesian terms.\nSo degreed views of experience aren\u2019t forced to commit\nspecifically to Bayesian views of perception (for more on\nprobabilistic views of perception, often focusing more on the\nprocesses leading to perception rather than what is generated by those\nprocesses, see Hohwy 2013, Rescorla 2015, Siegel 2020, or Vance 2021).\nUnderstanding degreed experiences along the lines of credences opens a\nwide menu of options. \n\nFor a final complication, note that there is extensive debate about\nthe relation between traditionally conceived beliefs and credences.\nOne eliminativist option ultimately denies that there are beliefs,\nreplacing them with credences. Other approaches keep both beliefs and\ncredences in the picture, and understand beliefs in terms of\ncredences, or credences in terms of belief, or neither in terms of the\nother (see section 4 of SEP entry on formal representations of\nbelief). Likewise, once one has admitted experiences that are degreed\nsomehow in the manner of credences, one might at the same time still\nallow for other experiences more like traditionally understood\nbeliefs. So there is now room for the questions about the relation\nbetween beliefs and credences to play out in the case of experiences\nthat are structured along the lines of beliefs vs. degreed experiences\nstructured along the lines of credences. Perhaps there only are\ndegreed experiences structured like credences, or perhaps there are\nalso experiences structured like beliefs, where we can ask whether\neither of the two entities has explanatory priority in relation to the\nother. \n\nIn sum, understanding experiences as being degreed in the manner of\ncredences is a fascinating line of research, but also a multi-pronged\none given the extent range of questions about credences.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve seen some of the possibilities that arise if\nexperiences are degreed, the question remains of whether the epistemic\nargument above establishes that any of them is actual.\n\nIn order to make the needed link from epistemology to mind plausible,\nthe linking premise and the rest of the argument need to be refined\nright away. The strategy is to trace variation of degrees in\njustification to variations of degrees in experience, but rival\ncandidates for explaining the variation need to be blocked. For all we\nhave said so far, the variation in degrees of justification could be\ntraced not to experiences, but rather to differing degrees of\njustification to believe that your experiences are trustworthy\n(depending on the conditions of fog).\n\nTo block a role for differences in your background beliefs, Munton in\neffect focuses on immediate justification for your experiences (using\nthe terminology of \u201cdirect\u201d justification). This gives us\nthe following\n\nEpistemology3 Our experiences immediately justify beliefs about\nthe external world to varying degrees.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link6 If our experiences immediately justify\nbeliefs about the external world to varying degrees, then our\nexperiences are themselves degreed.\n\nSo,\n\nMind3 Our experiences are themselves degreed.\n\nEven given these refinements, rival explanations still need to be\nblocked. For example, perhaps the new version of Epistemology is\nfalse, and experiences only provide specifically immediate\njustification in optimal cases (for discussion see Munton 2016). Or\nperhaps the new version of Link is false, and the variations in\ndegrees of justification can be explained in line with a traditional\nnon-degreed picture of what experiences are. For example, consider\nthat your experience plausibly concerns not just the potential snowman\nin the park, but also the amount of fog in the park and other aspects\nof your viewing conditions. And consider the phenomenon of defeat,\nwhere information you receive can reduce or destroy the amount of\njustification given by your experience. Given that your experience in\neffect takes a stand on the quality of your viewing conditions,\nperhaps your experiences in higher conditions of fog undermine the\ndegree of justification they supply specifically to believe a snowman\nis there. Here we might explain the variation of degrees of\njustification through variation in the experience, but through garden\nvariety non-degreed perceptual content concerning viewing conditions,\nrather than any more striking degreed character of the experiences\n(this sort of objection is discussed further in Beck 2020).\n\nWe have now surveyed the epistemic implications of some central\ntheories of experience. We have by no means covered all theories of\nexperience. Here we will simply point to further important areas to\nconsider. For discussion of na\u00efve realist theories of experience,\nand of their interaction with issues about skepticism, see the entries\non\n epistemological problems of perception\n and\n the disjunctive theory of perception.\n For discussion of how dualist theories of experience might lead to\nepiphenomenalism, where epiphenomenalism might lead to skeptical\nproblems, see the entry on\n epiphenomenalism\n (section 2.3). For discussion of the theory that experience is\nactually a special case of belief, where that theory might affect our\nunderstanding of how we base beliefs on experiences, see the entry on\n the contents of perception\n (section 2.2).\n2. Perceptual Phenomena\n\nLet us now consider the significance for epistemology of a range of\nperceptual phenomena. On most views, these phenomena do not occur in\nall cases of perception, but still have important ramifications for\nthe epistemology of perception.\n\nThe first array of phenomena are concerned with the relation between\nexperience and the world. Here we will consider different kinds of\nperceptual error, as well as forms of perception that occur only in\nthe absence of error. The remaining phenomena we will consider are\ncharacterized by the internal etiology of experience. Here we will\nlook at the influence of attention and of other mental states on our\nexperience.\n2.1. Perceptual Error\n2.1.1 Illusion and Hallucination\n\nIn cases of perceptual error, we form a false belief on the basis of a\nmisleading experience, as when an uninformed subject concludes there\nis motion below (to get the effect, let your eyes drift over the\nimage):\n\n\n\nFigure 3. \u201cRotating\n snakes\u201d[3]\n\n\nThis is a paradigm case of an illusion, where you do see a scene, but\nmisperceive what the scene is like. In a paradigm case of\nhallucination, you have a perceptual experience, but do not perceive\nanything in the scene before you.\n\nFew dispute that there are cases of perceptual error (although some\ndisagree about whether perceptual error is ever properly at the level\nof experience as opposed to that of beliefs formed on the basis of\nexperiences, cf. Brewer 2006). Many skeptical arguments use the\noccurrence of perceptual error to conclude that experiences do not do\na particular job in epistemology. We can understand these arguments as\nusing different versions of the Epistemology-Mind Link:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link7\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\nknowledge of the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link8\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\njustified beliefs about the external world.\n\nFor discussion of how to supplement or defend such principles, see the\nentries on\n skepticism\n and\n epistemological problems of perception.\n\nHere we will focus on a weaker principle that addresses the kind of\njustification we can get from perceptual experiences:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link9\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world.\n\nIf our experiences sometime deceive us, there is a \u201cgap\u201d\nbetween our having of the experience and the truth of the proposition\nthey putatively justify. On E-M Link9, some intermediate belief will\nthen be needed to close the gap between experience and truth, for\nexample a belief to the effect that our experiences are reliable.\nGiven the need for an intermediate belief, our experiences will then\narguably fail to give us non-inferential justification for beliefs\nabout the external world. This conclusion is endorsed by some\nphilosophers who still reject skepticism about perceptual\njustification (Cohen 2002; Wright 2004; or White 2006).\n\nE-M Link9 might still lead to skepticism. Consider an auxiliary belief\nmeant to bridge the gap between experience and truth, and ask whether\nwhatever process that lead to it might sometimes deceive us. For\nexample, consider your belief that your experiences are reliable, and\nwhatever process led to your belief that your experiences are\nreliable. That process could arguably lead you to falsely believe your\nexperiences are reliable in a situation where you are radically\ndeceived by an evil demon.\n\nWe now have a gap between the occurring of the process that led to an\nauxiliary belief and the truth of the auxiliary belief. So then,\naccording to the reasoning behind E-M Link9, we would need another\nauxiliary belief to bridge the gap. Since an evil demon could\npresumably deceive us yet again, a threat of vicious regress arises\nhere ((White 2006 articulates this line of thought without endorsing\nit (or explaining where it goes wrong)).\n2.1.2 Dreaming\n\nWe have considered the significance of illusion and hallucination.\nLet\u2019s now examine the case of dreams. Dreams are often\nunderstood to be paradigms of perceptual error, for example by\nDescartes when, discussing his apparent perceptions, he writes\nthat\n\n\nthis would not happen with such distinctness to someone asleep.\nIndeed! As if I did not remember other occasions when I have been\ntricked by exactly similar thoughts while asleep! (PW, p. 13)\n\n\nThe picture of dreaming as a case of perceptual error is challenged by\nSosa (2005).\n\nWe can frame the issue with a simplified argument for skepticism:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link10\n\nIf our experiences justify beliefs about our present surroundings, our\nexperiences do not frequently deceive us while we dream.\n\nMind4\n\nOur experiences frequently deceive us while we dream.\n\nSo,\n\nNot-Epistemology\n\nOur experiences do not justify our beliefs about our present\nsurroundings.\n\nSosa responds (to a more complex skeptical argument focused on\nknowledge) by defending an alternative conception of dreams known as\n\u201cthe imagination model\u201d. According to the imagination\nmodel, we actually do not form beliefs about our surroundings when we\ndream, or even have perceptual experiences when we dream.\n\nIn defense of the imagination model, consider that, when I go to bed,\nI form and store a belief that I am lying in bed. If I were to form a\nbelief while I am dreaming that I am running away from lions, I would\nthen have a belief that contradicts my stored belief that I am lying\nin bed. Now we arguably do not have such contradictory beliefs while\nwe are dreaming. The view that we form beliefs while dreaming might\nthen be what has to go (Sosa 2005: 6).\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the case of visual experience. On the\nimagination model, when dreaming we do not even have visual\nexperiences with the same conscious character as those we have when\nawake (we leave open whether we have \u201cvisual experiences\u201d\nwhile dreaming in some extended sense). The argument at this stage can\nexploit the earlier conclusion that we do not form beliefs about our\nsurroundings while dreaming. Sosa defends the further thesis on the\ngrounds that, if we did have experiences when dreaming with the\nconscious character of those we have when awake, we would be open to\nepistemic criticism for failing to form beliefs that take our\nexperiences at face value. However when I dream that I am being\nattacked by a lion, but do not believe while I dream that I am being\nattacked by a lion, I arguably am not open to epistemic criticism.\n\nIf the imagination model of dreaming is correct, the skeptical\nargument above is unsound because Mind is false. For discussion of\nwhether Sosa succeeds in blocking the best dreaming arguments for\nskepticism, see Ichikawa 2009. For further discussion specifically of\nthe visual character of dreams, see Schwitzgebel 2011: ch. 1.\n2.2 Successful Perception\n\nSome epistemologists privilege perceptual states that you are in only\nif you are not in cases of illusion or hallucination. On their views,\nthese states are either the only sources of perceptual justification,\nor at any rate the best sources of perceptual justification. In the\nterminology of Hawthorne and Kovakovich 2006, we may call these\nperceptual states \u201csuccess states\u201d.\n\nTo get a sense of some of the candidate states, consider the following\ntable:\n\n\n\n\n \n(Successful)\u00a0vision\nIllusion\nHallucination\n\n\n\n\nHaving a visual experience with the content that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nY \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\) as being \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nN \n\n\nSeeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nN \nN \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness\nY \nN \nN \n\n\n\n\n(In setting up this table, we assume that hallucinations of a\nparticular object are possible. For discussion, see Johnston 2004 or\nSchellenberg 2010.)\n\n\nEpistemologists differ according to which success states they\nprivilege, what job they assign to the state, and how severely they\nregard the absence of the privileged state.\n\nFor views which privilege seeing that \\(p\\), see\nMcDowell (1982, 1995) or A. Jackson (2011). For views which privilege\nsomething along the lines of\nseeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness, see\nJohnston (2006). These states are\nfact-entailing, since as a matter of necessity, you see that\n\\(a\\) is \\(F\\), or\nsee \\(a\\)\u2019s\n\\(F\\)ness, only if \\(a\\)\nis in fact \\(F\\). For a view that\npotentially favors the sort of perceptual state you find in cases of\nvision and illusion rather than hallucination, see Burge (2003). This\nsort of state is relational, since you can be in it only if\nthe relevant object of perception is present in your scene. Assuming\nthat each conscious success state has a counterpart in unconscious\nperception, notice that versions of these views might focus on\nperceptual states in common between conscious subjects and subjects\nwithout conscious perception.\n\nIn principle, you might get perceptual justification from a success\nstate in the good case of vision or illusion, and get the same amount\nof perceptual justification from a non-success state in the bad case\nof hallucination (Lord forthcoming takes up a view with this structure\nregarding reasons for belief). We bracket that sort of approach here.\nIt is more common to hold that you get no perceptual justification in\nthe case of hallucination (e.g., Jackson 2011), or at least a lower\ndegree or different kind of perceptual justification in the case of\nhallucination (e.g., Schellenberg 2013).\n\nLet\u2019s group views that privilege success states under the label\n\u201cSuccess Theory\u201d, and leave open how to adjudicate within\nthe camp.\n\nIn support of Success Theory, one can emphasize the tight connection\nthe approach draws between perceptual justification and truth. On many\nversions of the approach, the state that gives you justification to\nbelieve that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) guarantees\nthe truth of the belief that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\).\nMoreover, the source of your justification remains\nmental and arguably accessible to you, thus satisfying the demands of\nsome \u201cinternalist\u201d approaches in epistemology that\nprivilege what is inside the subject or accessible in a special way by\nthe subject (Prichard 2012). Moreover, Success Theory has a promising\nconnection with issues about skepticism. They promise to block\nskeptical arguments that assume our evidence is the same between the\ngood case of successful vision and the bad case of radical deception\nor hallucination (McDowell 1995, for a critique, see Wright 2004).\n\nAs an objection to Success Theory, many bring in demands on\njustification that are not satisfied by the most versions of the view.\nFor instance, consider the internalist thesis that, if things seem the\nsame to each of two people from the inside, then those two people are\nequally justified in their beliefs. More specifically, if two people\nhave the same conscious perspective on the world, and the same stored\nbeliefs, then they are the same with respect to the degree of\njustification of their beliefs. This sort of thesis is often motivated\nby considering radically deceived counterparts to us, and appealing to\nthe intuition that such subjects and us are equally justified (Lehrer\nand Cohen 1983; Cohen 1984; Wedgwood 2002; for dispute, see Sutton\n2007 or Littlejohn 2012). Now, if a version of Success Theory predicts\nthat a subject in perceptual error has less justification than a\ncorresponding perceiver, that version might be rejected on the basis\nof its conflict with the internalist thesis.\n\nIn response, one might attempt to explain away the intuition of equal\njustification as instead concerning equal blamelessness or\nexcusability, or at any rate as being correct only if restricted to\nblamelessness or excusability (e.g. Williamson 2007 or forthcoming).\nCritics often try to respond by distinguishing the sort of\nblamelessness or excusability one finds in cases of cognitive delusion\nor brainwashing, from the epistemic status of the beliefs of the\nvictim of an evil demon (Pryor 2001), or by demanding a more thorough\nexplanation of why the victim is indeed blameless or excusable\n(Miracchi forthcoming). Recent literature also steps back to examine\nwhether a substantive distinction can be drawn between justification\nand excusability, surveying potential distinctive explanatory roles\nfor epistemic excuses to play (Greco 2019).\n\nAlternatively, someone with a \u201cdisjunctive theory of\nperception\u201d might insist that the radically deceived subject\ndoes not have the same conscious perspective on the world as the\nsuccessful perceiver (Fish 2013, also the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception).\n On this line of thought, to have the conscious perspective of someone\nin a case of perceptual success, you need to be in a case of\nperceptual success. Here the antecedent of the internalist thesis is\nnot satisfied in cases of radical deception. One challenge here is\nthat there are many ways to be deceived. For example, when someone\nsees that a lemon is yellow, they might well lack a conscious\ncounterpart who hallucinates, but they arguably still have a conscious\ncounterpart who sees a fake lemon that is yellow. If the subject in a\ncase of vision and the subject in a case of illusion are equally\njustified, that will be trouble for approaches that give justifying\nprivilege to the states of seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nor seeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness.\n\nSome philosophers might attack Success Theory on the grounds that it\nis too internalist rather than not internalist enough. According to\ntheorists such as Ginsborg 2006 or Roessler 2009, the justifiers of\nperceptual beliefs are best understood to be facts about the external\nworld rather than facts about perceivers\u2019 mind.\n2.3 Attention\n\nStandard cases of perceptual justification are ones in which you\nattend to what you see, as when you attend to your mail and form a\njustified belief that you have mail. But are all cases of perceptual\njustification ones in which attention is involved? According to the\nAttention Needed view, only attentive experiences can provide\njustification. According to the Attention Optional view,\ninattentive experiences can provide propositional justification.\n\nIf you only experience what you attend to, as is maintained by\nphilosophers such as Prinz 2012, all cases of justification by\nexperience will trivially involve attention as well. Here we\u2019ll\npursue the issue on the assumption that we sometimes experience\nsomething we do not attend to, as is held by theorists such as Searle\n1992 and Mole 2011.\n\nTo make our discussion concrete, consider Simons and Chabris\u2019s\n(1999) famous \u201cSelective Attention Test\u201d on youtube (see\nthe link in\n Other Internet Resources).\n When subjects were asked to count passes of basketballs\u2014spoiler\nalert!\u2014a fair number failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit\nwho came into the scene. Given how hard it is to track the passes of\nbasketballs, it is natural to assume that the non-noticers were\nattending only to the basketballs, and did not attend to the person in\nthe gorilla suit. Now suppose that some of non-noticers still did\nexperience a person in a gorilla suit in the scene, as a person in a\ngorilla suit. According to the Attention Needed view, their\ninattentive experience cannot provide them with justification to\nbelieve that someone\u2019s there in a gorilla suit. According to the\nAttention Optional view, their inattentive experience might still\nprovide them with justification to believe that someone\u2019s there\nin a gorilla suit.\n\nBoth views have their attractions. Typically, if you look carelessly\nat a scene, your experience will put you in a worse epistemic position\nif you look attentively at the scene. Perhaps if attention is fully\ngone but experience remains, experience no longer provides\njustification.\n\nOn the other hand, you can have evidence you don\u2019t notice you\nhave, and this point might favor the Attention Optional view. Consider\neveryday cases of \u201cchange blindness\u201d discussed by Dretske\n2004. For example, your friend gets a haircut, and asks you \u201cdo\nI look different?\u201d You are stumped. On Dretske\u2019s account,\nyou might still have a perfectly accurately experience of how his hair\nnow looks. Here your experience plausibly gives you justification to\nbelieve that your friend got a haircut (when combined with your\nbackground beliefs). You also fail to notice that your experience\ngives you justification to believe your friend got a haircut. If\nexperiences provide un-noticed evidence, such cases are arguably good\nprecedents for the sorts of cases allowed by the Attention Optional\nview. (For striking cases of change blindness, see the link in\n Other Internet Resources.)\n\nFor further discussion of the potential epistemic roles of attention,\nsee Campbell 2002, 2011; Roessler 2011; Smithies 2011; Wu 2014; and\nSilins and Siegel 2014.\n2.4 Cognitive Penetration\n\nAccording to one empiricist tradition, experience functions as a\nmirror, reflecting what is before the subject, without any\nmanipulation by the subject\u2019s mind. Given that experience is\nsupposed to not be influenced by one\u2019s theories or expectations,\nit is thereby supposed to be in an optimal position to confirm or\ndisconfirm hypotheses about the world. According to a wide range of\nphilosophers and scientists, such a picture of the nature of\nexperience is mistaken, putting limitations on the ability of\nexperience to justify belief. In the philosophy of science, the\nchallenge has been put in terms of the \u201ctheory-dependence of\nobservation\u201d, and the implications thereof. In more recent\nepistemology and philosophy of mind, the challenge has been put in\nterms of \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d\neffects and the implications thereof.\n\nTo survey the debate, we\u2019ll start with the philosophy of mind by\nconsidering potential examples of the phenomenon, and we will then\nturn to questions in epistemology.\n\nOne potential source of examples comes from ambiguous figures such as\nthe Necker cube (Hanson 1958; Kuhn 1962; Churchland 1979, 1988).\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Necker\n Cube[4]\n\n\nYou can see this figure as a downward-tilted cube with the left face\nclosest to you, or as an upward-tilted cube with the right face\nclosest to you. Critics dispute whether such examples support any\nthesis of theory-dependence of observation. An alternative\nresponse is that you experience the figure in different ways merely\nbecause you attend to different parts of the figure at different\ntimes. Here the difference in your experience is not explained by\ndifferences in what theory you hold (Fodor 1984).\n\nTheorists such as Hanson, Kuhn and Churchland also made much of work\nby so-called \u201cNew Look\u201d psychologists such as Bruner and\nPostman. Consider for instance Bruner and Postman\u2019s classic 1949\nexperiment involving anomalous playing cards. In this experiment,\nsubjects were briefly shown the following sort of card:\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nWhat did you just see? When subjects were exposed to this sort of\ncard, many reported it to be a six of hearts. The card is actually a\nred six of spades.\n\nOne might claim that the card looked to you the way red sixes of\nhearts look to you. However, there is much skepticism about whether\nthere is an effect here on perceptual experience itself (Fodor 1983;\nPylyshyn 1999). Perhaps the card fails to look like a red six of\nhearts to you, and you simply jumped to the conclusion that it is a\nred six of hearts when you form your belief. The effect might merely\nhave been on beliefs formed on the basis of perceptual experience.\n\nThe current debate about cognitive penetration is informed by more\nrecent experiments in psychology. For a case of a top-down effect in\nthe current literature, consider \u201cmemory color\u201d in Hansen\net al.\u2019s banana (2006). When subjects were asked to adjust an\nimage of a characteristically yellow object until it was achromatic,\nthey overcompensated by adjusting until the image was slightly bluish.\nSubjects did not overcompensate with objects that were not\ncharacteristically yellow. The type of case presented by Hansen et al.\nis much harder to explain away as not really involving top-down\neffects than those in the classic philosophy of science literature.\n(For related examples, see Delk and Fillenbaum 1965 or Olkkonen,\nHansen, and Gegenfurtner 2008. For further discussion of whether and\nhow there might be top-down effects on perception, see Macpherson\n2012, Deroy 2013, Firestone and Scholl 2016; Green 2020).\n\nLet us now turn to the epistemology of cases of cognitive\npenetration.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether all cases of top-down effects are\nproblematic for perceptual justification. Consider the possibility of\ntop-down effects from expertise. For example, perhaps the expert\nradiologist sees more than the novice when looking at an x-ray, and\nperhaps the expert chess-player sees more than the novice when looking\nat a chessboard in mid-game (see the papers in Ericsson 2006 for\ndiscussion of such examples). Further, suppose that the expertise\nexamples are genuine cases of top-down influence. Here the expert is\npresumably at an epistemic advantage thanks to top-down effects, where\nher experience justifies her with respect to those contents that her\nexperience has thanks to her cognitive background (Siegel 2012).\n\nTo see why some cases of top-down effects might be epistemically\nproblematic, consider Siegel\u2019s (2012) hypothetical case of\n\u201cAngry Looking Jack\u201d. Suppose that Jill antecedently has\nan unjustified belief that Jack is angry at her. The next time she\nsees him, he does look angry to her\u2014as a result of a top-down\neffect from her belief. In response to her experience, Jill then\nreaffirms her belief. Is she now justified in believing that Jack is\nangry at her? (Markie 2005 presents a related example of a gold\nprospector whose wishful thinking makes a nugget visually seem to be\ngold).\n\nIf you are inclined to deny that Jill\u2019s belief is justified, you could\nappeal to an intuition that Jill is not justified by her experience in\nbelieving that Jack is angry at her (Siegel 2012). But others may not\nshare the intuition.\n\nAnother strategy is to give a further argument that Jill is not\njustified by her experience in believing that Jack is angry at her.\nFor arguments that appeal to an analogy with the unjustified formation\nof a belief on an unjustified belief, see McGrath (2013) and Siegel\n(2013) (Teng 2021 critically responds). For an argument that appeals\nto an analogy with the unjustified formation of beliefs on the basis\nof emotion, see Vance (2014).\n",
