    "main_text": "Women\u2019s Suffrage\n12. At the Dawn of Jim Crow\n\nDuring and after the Reconstruction, Douglass remained deeply\nconcerned about the prospect that the U.S. would compromise on black\nAmericans\u2019 civil and human rights. He became increasingly\nworried about the denial of black civil rights and the rising waves of\nanti-black violence and criticized the growing practice of black\npeonage in agriculture. And over time, his sympathy for black\nindividuals and families fleeing the American South grew. He did not\nsupport internal mass migration as a policy because he judged it a\npoor option for black labor since it did not address the institutional\nproblems that caused the flight: peonage and exploitation, unequal\njustice, unrestrained violence, lack of resources and opportunities,\nand in particular, education. For taking that position, Douglass\nreceived a great deal of criticism for failing to support the\nindividual choices of black Americans who sought to flee the\ninhospitable, degrading, and deadly conditions in the American South.\nIt compelled him to rethink his views on the question\n (\u00a79).\n\nRelated to the conditions causing the flight of black Americans from\nthe southern states, Douglass criticized the inequitable and unfair\ntreatment of blacks in state criminal justice systems, particularly\ncriticizing the Convict-Lease system (Davis 1999). And he joined with\nIda B. Wells-Barnett (1862\u20131931) in raising the alarm over the\ngrowing practice of anti-black lynching in the United States (Giddings\n2008; Wells-Barnett et al. 2014). Douglass saw America\u2019s failure\nto support civil rights and equal citizenship for black Americans as\nindicative of its moral and political failure. He even went so far as\nto provocatively claim that emancipation was a stupendous fraud (1888a\n[FDSW: 712\u2013724]).\n\nDouglass\u2019s later-day activities are an essential part of his\nrecord and life; indeed, they are a part of the evolving discussions\non various subjects in African American philosophy, political theory,\nand critical theories in several disciplines. He was part of several\nmovements that helped to mold the nation; they took their confidence\nin providential historical development in hand\u2014as he did when he\nfirst committed to seizing his liberty in his \u201csoul\u2019s\ncomplaint\u201d, an \u201capostrophe\u201d to ships on the\nChesapeake Bay:\n\n\nYou are loosed from your mooring, and are free; I am fast in my\nchains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I\nsadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom\u2019s swift-winged\nangels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O\nthat I were free! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and\nunder your protecting wing! Alas! Betwixt me and you, the turbid\nwaters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim!\nIf I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The\nglad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the\nhottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let\nme be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? (1845 [FDAB: 59])\n\n\nThe historian David Blight called Douglass a prophet of freedom,\nperfectly capturing Douglass\u2019s enduring appeal (2018). His\nideas, values, and rhetoric defending equal liberty continue to cry\nout to us in celebration and defense of equality and liberty. There is\nno better summation of all that he stood for than what he proclaimed\nin 1869 at the end of \u201cOn Composite Nationality\u201d:\n\n\nIf our action shall be in accordance with the principles of justice,\nliberty, and perfect human equality, no eloquence can adequately\nportray the greatness and grandeur of the Republic. We shall spread\nthe network of our science and our civilization over all who seek\ntheir shelter, whether from Asia, Africa, or the Isles of the Sea. We\nshall mould them all, each after his kind, into Americans; Indian and\nCelt, negro and Saxon, Latin and Teuton, Mongolian and Caucasian, Jew\nand gentile, all shall bow to the same law, speak the same language,\nsupport the same government, enjoy the same liberty, vibrate with the\nsame national enthusiasm, and seek the same national ends. (1869 [SFD:\n302\u2013303])\n\n\nThose inspiring and challenging words stand as an invitation to us to\nclosely study Douglass\u2019s works and legacy and to achieve our\nnation.\n",
