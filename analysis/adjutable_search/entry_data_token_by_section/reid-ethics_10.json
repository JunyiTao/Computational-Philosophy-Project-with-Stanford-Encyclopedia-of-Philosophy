    "main_text": "The Moral Sense || Reid\u2019s defense of the reliability of the moral sense\n5. Conclusion\n\nReid\u2019s view is a version of agency-centered ethical\nintuitionism. The view is agency-centered because Reid develops his\naccount of moral motives in light of his broadly agent causal account\nof agency and regulation account of autonomy, according to which our\nrational nature consists in our ability to regulate our conduct by\nappeal to the rational principles of action. This account of moral\nmotives, we have seen, borrows a great deal from the rationalists. The\nmoral first principles, says Reid, are self-evident necessary truths\nwhich are knowable to a person with a sound understanding, a decent\nmoral education, and not in the grip of distorting influences. Reid,\nhowever, was no ideologue, and freely borrowed from sentimentalists\nsuch as Hutcheson. In particular, he borrows from the sentimentalists\nthe conceptuality of the moral sense, which figures so importantly in\nhis work. The idea that the moral sense is at once an\ninformation-processing system whose deliverances are affective states\nthat move us to action, we\u2019ve seen, resembles closely what\nfigures such as Hutcheson claim. Finally, we have also seen that, at\nvarious points, Reid\u2019s thought coincides with Kant\u2019s. This\nis especially evident when one considers Reid\u2019s regulation\naccount of autonomy and his defense of what Darwall calls the\nsecond-person standpoint.\n\nRather few contemporary philosophers could accept all of Reid\u2019s\ncentral claims\u2014agent causation, teleological accounts of action,\nand occasionalism not being the dominant views of our day. Still, for\nthose who resonate with a broadly realist version of ethical\nnon-naturalism with emphases similar to Kant\u2019s, Reid\u2019s\nview is intriguing. Its resources remain to be mined.\n",
