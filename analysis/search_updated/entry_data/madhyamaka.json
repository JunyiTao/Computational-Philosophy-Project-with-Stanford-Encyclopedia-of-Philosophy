    "preamble": "\n\nThe Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, the followers of which are called\nM\u0101dhyamikas, was one of the two principal schools of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in India, the other school being the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. The name of the school is a reference to the claim\nmade of Buddhism in general that it is a middle path\n(madhyam\u0101 pratipad) that avoids the two extremes of\neternalism\u2014the doctrine that all things exist because of an\neternal essence\u2014and annihilationism\u2014the doctrine that\nthings have essences while they exist but that these essences are\nannihilated just when the things themselves go out of existence. The\nconviction of the Madhyamaka school, which can be called the Centrist\nschool in English, is that this middle path is best achieved by a\ndenial that things have any inherent natures at all. All things are,\nin other words, empty of inherent natures. This doctrine of universal\nemptiness of inherent natures\n(svabh\u0101va-\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) is the hallmark of the\nschool, which places the school solidly in the tradition associated\nwith the Perfection of Wisdom\n(praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101) literature of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism.\n\nThe key texts of the school comprised commentaries to the writings of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2014the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna most often\ncommented upon are the M\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101\n(MMK) and Vigraha-vy\u0101vartan\u012b (VV)\u2014and a\nnumber of independent works that expanded on ideas found in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s writings. A few of the Sanskrit treatises\nof the early Madhyamaka school were translated into Chinese and became\nthe basis of a short-lived school of Chinese Buddhism. A significant\nnumber of Sanskrit Madhyamaka texts were eventually translated into\nTibetan and exerted considerable influence on the intellectual\nheritage of Tibetan Buddhism. This article will deal only with the\nMadhyamaka school in India from the fifth through the eighth\ncenturies, during which time the school underwent most of its\nevolution.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Issues in the Madhyamaka school\n\nThere a number of points that all M\u0101dhyamika thinkers have in\ncommon. In all of them one finds some version of the doctrine of two\ntruths, according to which there is a level of understanding that\nconsists of an accurate account of the world as it is experienced in\neveryday life and another level of understanding that is conducive to\nreaching the ultimate goal (param\u0101rtha) of Buddhist\npractice, namely, nirvana, understood as the absence of attachment,\naversion and delusion with no possibility of their return. There is\nalso broad agreement that language is limited to the everyday level of\nunderstanding and that the truth of nirvana is beyond the reach of\nlanguage and of the conceptualization that makes language\npossible.\n\nWhere differences arise among M\u0101dhyamika thinkers is on the issue\nof how these two truths relate to one another. Does careful\nverbalization and thinking do any good in bringing one closer to\nnirvana, or is it invariably an obstacle? Is there any room within\nMadhyamaka for clear thinking and carefully wrought argumentation, or\nare all attempts to arrive at clear thought and rigorous argumentation\nultimately delusional and therefore to be abandoned along with more\nobvious forms of delusion?\n\nAnother area in which M\u0101dhyamakas differ from one another is in\ntheir attitude toward the other main school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which M\u0101dhyamikas\npresent as advocating a kind of subjective idealism. Early\nM\u0101dhyamikas tended to refute the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine that\nall the contents within awareness arise out of awareness itself and\nare thus ontologically at one with consciousness. Later\nM\u0101dhyamikas found room for that view, usually by portraying\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra as a philosophy that prepares one intellectually\nand emotionally for the difficult truth that all things are lacking in\ninherent natures and all that we think of as knowledge is ultimately\nwithout grounding.\n2. \u0100ryadeva (fl. ca. 225\u2013250 C.E.)\n\nAccording to traditional accounts preserved in Tibetan and Chinese,\n\u0100ryadeva was born into the royal family in what is now Sri Lanka,\nrenounced his claim to the throne, took monastic vows, studied the\nBuddhist scriptures for several years, and travelled to south India.\nHe reportedly became a direct disciple of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. His\nprincipal writing, the Catu\u1e25\u015bataka\u015b\u0101stra\n(Four Hundred Verse Treatise), was regarded as a Madhayamaka text and\nwas commented on by Candrak\u012brti and by prominent Tibetan\nproponents of the Madhyamaka school.\n\nThe first hundred verses of the Four Hundred Verse Treatise deal with\nfour illusions that must be dispelled by someone striving to achieve\nliberation from the root causes of dissatisfaction. The four illusions\nare the beliefs that there are permanent things in the world that\nescape destruction, that impermanent things can provide true\nsatisfaction, that satisfaction can be derived from intrinsically\nimpure things, and that satisfaction can be attained by being\npreoccupied with oneself. These are standard themes in Buddhist\nwritings. The second set of one hundred verses also deal with standard\nBuddhist themes, namely, cultivating altruistic motivations, ridding\nthe mind of the afflictions of desire, anger, and delusion, and\ndeveloping habits of ethical conduct. While the first half of the\ntreatise is essentially inspirational in nature, the second half\nprovides arguments meant to prove that all things are conditioned and\ntherefore impermanent, that nothing qualifies as an independent and\nenduring self, and that there are no uncaused causes. Most of the\nverses dealing with these topics are polemical in nature and are aimed\nat refuting the doctrines of Brahmanical schools, Jainism and some of\nthe Buddhist scholastics. As is the case with other M\u0101dhyamikas,\n\u0100ryadeva focuses most of his attention on showing the\nincomprehensibility or absurdity of the doctrines under review. His\nmotivation for doing this is suggested in 8.10 (the tenth verse in the\neighth set of twenty-five), where he says attachment to one\u2019s\nown views and disparaging the views of others is an obstacle to\nnirvana, and tranquillity is impossible for those who engage in\ndoctrinal disputes. His exercise in showing the untenability of\nvarious positions, then, is presumably done not for the sake of\nrefuting others in order to establish his own position, but to help\nhis readers break the habit of firmly holding tenets.\n\nAn example of \u0100ryadeva\u2019s demonstrating an inconsistency in\na particular position is his critique of the view that there is a\npermanent self. He observes that since a permanent self could not\nundergo change, it could not be harmed or destroyed, and therefore it\nis inconsistent for those who believe in such a self to promote\nethical guidelines against killing or harming others. While\n\u0100ryadeva endeavors in some chapters to show the inconsistencies\nin a number of particular doctrines of the S\u0101\u1e43khya and\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika schools, in the fourteenth chapter he provides a\nparadigm of an argument that can be applied to any number of doctrinal\npositions. That paradigm, which is familiar to readers of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna and other M\u0101dhyamikas, consists in showing\nthat there is a problem in attributing a given predicate to a subject,\nand in attributing the negation of that predicate, and in attributing\nboth the predicate and its negation, and in attributing neither the\npredicate nor its negation. For example, he argues that one cannot say\nthat a pot is single, for it has many characteristics, such as color,\nshape, hardness, odor and so forth. It also cannot be said that the\npot is many pots, because none of the individual characteristics is a\npot. It cannot be said that the pot is a single whole with many\ncharacteristics, because some of its components are material and\ntherefore capable of contact and location, while others, such as color\nand odor, are immaterial and have no location; it makes no sense to\nsay that characteristics that have contrary natures form a coherent\nwhole. And yet to deny that a pot is either one or many is to deny\nthat it exists at all, for an existent thing must have either a\nproperty or the absence of that property. \u0100ryadeva\u2019s\nstatements of these arguments in verse is laconic and often difficult\nto follow; therefore, most readers who study his text do so with the\nhelp of one of the many commentaries written by later Sanskrit or\nTibetan authors. \n3. Buddhap\u0101lita\n\nAside from a commentary entitled Akutobhaya (Afraid of\nnothing), which is traditionally ascribed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna but\nthe authorship of which is questioned by modern scholars, the earliest\nextant commentary to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s MMK is the\nMadhyamakav\u1e5btti by Buddhap\u0101lita (ca 470\u2013ca\n540). The original Sanskit of this text is not known to exist, but it\nis still extant in Tibetan translation. Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s\ncommentary, like Akutobhaya stays close to the text upon\nwhich it is a commentary. The MMK is written in verse, and\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary places the words of the verse\ntext into standard prose word order and offers glosses to disambiguate\npotentially confusing words. Like the MMK itself,\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary does not offer a positive\nposition but rather shows the untenability of all the apparently\npossible solutions to the philosophical questions taken up for\nexamination. The principal method of examining a position in MMK and\nin Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary is to show that unwelcome\nconsequences are entailed by the position under consideration.\n\nAn example of the approach used by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nBuddhap\u0101lita is their discussion of the relation between a cause\nand its effect, the topic taken up in MMK 1.1. There are only four\npossible relationships: the cause is the same as the effect, the cause\nis different from the effect, the cause is both the same as and\ndifferent from the effect, or the cause is neither the same as nor\ndifferent from the effect. This fourth position would be tantamount to\nsaying that there is no cause, and that an effect therefore arises out\nof nothing at all. Each of these four possibilities is rejected in\nturn, each for a different reason. Buddhap\u0101lita argues that if an\neffect were identical to its cause, then it would already exist as the\ncause and would have no need of coming into being a second time.\nIdentity of cause and effect defeats the very idea of causality. If\nthe effect were different from the cause, on the other hand, then\nthere would be no constraints on what could arise out of what, so long\nas the cause and the effect were different. The third possibility is\nuntenable, says Buddhap\u0101lita, since it is merely the conjunction\nof the two hypotheses that have just been shown to be untenable. A\nproposition consisting of the conjunction of two false propositions\ncannot be true. The fourth possibility, like the first, undermines the\nvery idea of causality. Moreover, says Buddhap\u0101lita, it would\nrender all practice ineffectual; what he probably had in mind here was\nspecifically Buddhist religious practice, which is predicated on\nidentifying the root causes of dissatisfaction and then eliminating\nthose root causes so that dissatisfaction disappears.\n\nBeyond showing the untenability of each of the relations that were\ndiscussed as possible relations between the relata in a particular\nsituation, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Buddhap\u0101lita have little to\nsay. Opponents to the Madhyamaka school were critical of this\napproach, saying in effect that there is little value in finding fault\nwith a philosophical view unless one is prepared to offer a better\nview to replace the faulty one. As will become more clear in what\nfollows, it was precisely this issue\u2014that is, whether there is a\nvalue in simply finding faults in philosophical views\u2014that\nbecame controversial among M\u0101dhyamikas.\n4. Bh\u0101vaviveka\n\nThe strongest challenge to the commentarial tradition of\nBuddhap\u0101lita came from Bh\u0101vaviveka, whose approach to\nMadhyamaka became the basis of what Tibetan Buddhists would many\ncenturies after the fact consider a subschool of Madhyamaka that\nrivallled the subschool comprising those who followed\nBuddhap\u0101lita.\n4.1 Life and works\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka, who was also known as Bhavya and Bh\u0101viveka, was\nprobably active in the middle part of the sixth century. His\ncommentary on MMK, entitled Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpa\n(Lamp of Wisdom), now extant only in Chinese and Tibetan translations,\ncontains not only his interpretation of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nthoughts but also critiques of Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s approach to\nMadhyamaka, about which more will be said below, and critiques of the\nBuddhist abhidharma tradition. Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpa\nalso incorporates critiques of such non-Buddhist schools as\nS\u0101\u1e43khya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and the Jains.\n\nIn addition to his commentary to MMK, Bh\u0101vaviveka wrote an\nimportant independent verse treatise on Madhyamaka entitled\nMadhyamakah\u1e5bdayak\u0101rik\u0101 (Verses on the Heart\nof Centrism) to which he provided a prose commentary called\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 (Flame of Reasoning). This combination\nof works comprises eleven chapters.\n\nOn cultivating and maintaining bodhicitta, that is, the\naspiration to become enlightened in order to work for the benefit and\nultimate liberation of all sentient beings\nFollowing the Buddhist vows\nStriving for a knowledge of reality\nReality as understood by the conservative canonical Buddhists\n(\u015ar\u0101vakas)\nReality as understood by the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school of\nBuddhism\nReality as understood by the S\u0101\u1e43khya school\nReality as understood by the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school\nReality as understood by the Ved\u0101nta schools\nReality as understood by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nschool\nThe realization of omniscience\nOn the characteristics of praise\n\n\nAs the titles of the chapters of this work show, Bh\u0101vaviveka was\na student of most of the important movements in Indian philosophy of\nhis era and sought to stake out the place of the Madhyamaka school\nwithin Buddhism as a whole. His understanding of Madhyamaka was\nimportantly different from Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s. Their different\napproaches turned out to define two of the three important sub-schools\nof Madhyamaka.\n4.2 Contributions\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Bh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s approach\nto Madhyamaka is his conviction that a M\u0101dhyamika should put\nforward a positive argument for a position rather than merely showing\nthe inadequacies of other positions. His criticism of\nBuddhap\u0101lita was focused primarily on that very point;\nBuddhap\u0101lita offered no statement of what the M\u0101dhyamikas\nbelieve but confined himself to pointing out that what other people\nbelieve is untenable in one way or another. To criticize the positions\nof others but not to venture to state a position of one\u2019s own\nwas regarded by the Indian debate tradition as a substandard use of\nargumentation called vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, which\nliterally means making an attack. Bh\u0101vaviveka was at pains to\nshow that M\u0101dhyamikas could not legitimately be accused of this\nsort of philosophical sniping. He affirmed that M\u0101dhyamikas do\nhave a conviction that they are prepared to state and defend, namely,\nthat all phenomena are devoid of an inherent nature, that is, a nature\nthat they have independently. All phenomena are conditioned, and such\nnatures as they have are natures that they acquire through their\nconditions rather than on their own. The concise Madhyamaka way of\nsaying all this is to say that all phenomena (dharmas) are\nempty (\u015b\u016bnya). Since the M\u0101dhyamikas believe\nthat all phenomena are empty, they owe it to their readers to provide\nreasons for thinking that that is a reasonable thing to believe.\n\nIn providing arguments in favor of the conclusions accepted by\nM\u0101dhyamikas, Bh\u0101vaviveka followed the example set by\nDign\u0101ga (fl. ca. 510), a Buddhist whose principal contributions\nwere in the area of epistemology and logic. Dign\u0101ga, following\nwith some modifications philosophers of the Brahmanical Ny\u0101ya\nschool, had devised a canonical form of presenting arguments, which\nconsisted in identifying a topic (pak\u1e63a) and reasoning\non the basis of an observed feature of the topic that it also had\nanother feature not currently available for direct observation. The\nstock example given in Indian logic is that if a particular mountain\nis the topic, one can reason on the basis of observing smoke\nassociated with that mountain that there is also a fire associated\nwith that mountain. Attributing an unobserved feature to a topic on\nthe basis of an observed feature is legitimate only if one has\npreviously observed the feature used as evidence together with the\nfeature being inferred, and if one has never seen the feature used as\nevidence in the absence of the feature being inferred.\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s method of presenting an argument consists, then,\nin stating a topic (pak\u1e63a) and a property used as\nevidence (s\u0101dhaka-dharma) for a property to be\nestablished (s\u0101dhya-dharma). Bh\u0101vaviveka followed\nthis method in arguing for the conclusions of which he claimed\nM\u0101dhyamikas are convinced; he also criticized Buddhap\u0101lita\nfor failing to follow Dign\u0101ga\u2019s method.\n\nIn his discussion of MMK 1.1, Bh\u0101vaviveka makes the general\nobservation that when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna negates a proposition, he is\nnegating the entire proposition rather than negating just the\npredicate. If one negates just a predicate, that leaves open the\npossibility that some other predicate can suitably be applied to the\nsubject in question. Negation of a predicate in a proposition\npresupposes the existence of the subject of the proposition, whereas\nnegation of the entire proposition need not rest on such a\npresupposition. So when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says that a phenomenon\ndoes not arise from itself, one should understand that to be a way of\nsaying \u201cIt is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nitself.\u201d If one were to construe N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nstatement as equivalent to something like \u201cThe arising of a\nphenomenon is not from the phenomenon itself,\u201d then one would\nnaturally take that to be saying that the arising of a phenomenon is\nfrom something other than itself. Alternatively, one might take it to\nbe saying that the arising of a phenomenon is not only from\nitself but rather from something that is partly itself and partly\nsomething other than itself. If one takes N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nproposition to be a series of conjoined propositions of the form\n\u201cIt is not the case that a phenomenon arises from itself\nand it is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nsomething other than itself, and it is not the case that a\nphenomenon arises from itself in cooperation with something other than\nitself, and it is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nnothing at all,\u201d then there is no paradox involved in negating\nboth a simple proposition and its contradiction. It is therefore\nimportant to make it clear when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s negations\nare sentential negations and when they are term-negations, and this\nBuddhap\u0101lita failed to do.\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka goes on to explain that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna employed\nsentential negations in MMK 1.1, because he was trying to establish a\nkind of \u201cnon-conceptual cognition,\u201d that is, an insight\nthat cannot be expressed in words. The scope of this non-conceptual\ninsight is everything that is capable of being cognized. In other\nwords, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s insight was that everything that\none thinks one knows, every explanation one thinks one has to account\nfor one\u2019s experiences, is flawed and must ultimately be\nabandoned. In saying this, Bh\u0101vaviveka is consistent with a\nnumber of important statements in MMK and VV. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had\nlaid emphasis on the claim that the Buddha had dealt out two kinds of\ntruth, a quotidian transactional or conventional truth\n(vyavah\u0101ra-satya, sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti-satya) and a truth\nconcerning the highest goal (param\u0101rtha-satya), namely,\nnirvana. Of these, only the transactional truth is capable of being\narticulated in language. The highest goal, consisting of a silence of\nthe mind in which there is no conceptual thinking, is naturally\ninexpressible in language, since language is necessarily bound up with\nconcepts. Some form of this view was shared by all M\u0101dhyamikas.\nWhere they differed with one another was on the issue of how the\nteachings of Buddhism, which are communicated in language, relate to\nthe highest goal of Buddhism, which lies outside the scope of\nlanguage.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna wrote in MMK 18.9 that the defining\ncharacteristics of reality (tattva, literally,\n\u201cthatness\u201d or quiddity) are that it is not conditioned by\nsomething other than itself, it is peaceful, it cannot be elaborated\nthrough verbal elaborations, it is non-conceptual, and it is uniform.\nIn his commentary to that verse, Bh\u0101vaviveka expands the meaning\nof the verse by saying that anything that is not conceptual in nature\ncannot be expressed through verbal elaborations or through any other\nkind of sign. In other words, what is non-conceptual in nature cannot\nbe known indirectly, and knowledge gained through language is always\nmediated and indirect. For this reason, reality is entirely outside\nthe range of language. That notwithstanding, says Bh\u0101vaviveka,\nwhat language can do is convey something about the general\nnature of what is talked about. The statement that phenomena are\nlacking in inherent natures, for example, does convey useful general\ninformation about reality. Even though reality itself can be known\nonly directly through a non-conceptual awareness, language can be\nhelpful in conveying that very information, namely, that reality can\nbe apprehended only directly and not through language. That the\nM\u0101dhyamika has, and defends, the view that reality lacks inherent\nnature means that the M\u0101dhyamika is not merely engaging in\nphilosophical sniping of the vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101\nvariety.\n\nIn his Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101, in which Bh\u0101vaviveka is\nfreed from the constraints of following N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\ntexts and puts forward his own approach to Madhyamaka, he states that\nthe term \u201chighest goal\u201d (param\u0101rtha-satya)\nhas two aspects. One aspect is that it is free from volitional\nthought, pure and beyond the reach of verbal elaborations. Another\naspect is that it is volitional in nature, connected with the\naccumulation of knowledge and meritorious karma, and connected with\nverbal elaborations and with the transactional knowledge of everyday\nlife. By seeing the ultimate goal in this way, Bh\u0101vaviveka claims\nto give an account that leaves reality intact as a uniform whole about\nwhich knowledge can be diverse and incremental. This incremental\nnature of knowledge makes ample room for the traditional\nMah\u0101y\u0101na teachings of the gradated bodhisattva path whereby\none moves from the aspiration for enlightenment to the gradual\nrealization of enlightenment. A metaphor that Bh\u0101vaviveka uses\nfor the Buddhist path is that it follows verbal teachings which are\nlike a ladder that one slowly ascends until one can climb over the\nwall into non-conceptual direct awareness of the peaceful reality of\nnirvana in which there is nothing to be wished for, nothing to be\nunderstood and no hypothesis to be defended.\n5. Candrak\u012brti\n5.1 Life and works\n\nAs is usual for the majority of Indian philosophers, very little is\nknown about the life of Candrak\u012brti. Modern scholars place him at\nthe beginning of the seventh century. His two best-known works are his\ncommentary to MMK entitled Prasannapad\u0101\nMadhyamakav\u1e5btti (Clear-worded Commentary on Centrism),\nwhich survives in Sanskrit as well as in Tibetan translation, and an\nindependent treatise called Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra\n(Introduction to Centrism) available only in Tibetan translation.\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra is a verse text to which\nCandrak\u012brti provided a prose commentary. It is clearly an earlier\nwork than his commentary to MMK, since in that commentary he refers\nthe reader repeatedly to Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra for the\nfull arguments for the positions he endorses. Both\nPrasannapad\u0101 and Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra\nhave been studied by modern scholars and a significant number of\npassages have been translated into modern European languages. In\naddition to those works, Candrak\u012brti wrote a number of\ncommentaries to relatively short texts by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\n\u0100ryadeva.\n5.2 Contributions\n\nAt the beginning of his commentary to MMK, Candrak\u012brti offers an\nextended criticism of Bh\u0101vaviveka and a defense of\nBuddhap\u0101lita against the criticisms of Bh\u0101vaviveka. Many\ncenturies after he wrote, Buddhist scholastics in Tibet portrayed\nCandrak\u012brti as the founder of one of the subschools of the\nMadhyamaka that they perceived. Because Bh\u0101vaviveka had advocated\nfor producing independent (svatantra) arguments for the view\nthat all phenomena are empty of inherent natures, the Tibetan\nscholastics dubbed his subschool the Sv\u0101tantrika school; because\nCandrak\u012brti criticized that approach and advocated for being\ncontent to show the unwelcome consequences (prasa\u1e45ga)\nof all possible positions on any given philosophical issue, his\nsubschool was named by Tibetans the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika school of\nMadhyamaka. Although those terms were not used by Indian\nM\u0101dhyamikas themselves, it has become standard practice in modern\nscholarship to portray the Madhyamaka school as comprising at least\ntwo subschools with those names and to see Bh\u0101vaviveka and\nCandrak\u012brti as the founders of those two subschools.\n\nThe earlier of Candrak\u012brti\u2019s two principal works,\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra, has ten chapters, one for each of\nthe ten stages of the path of the bodhisattva. At each of these stages\nthe bodhisattva focuses attention on one of the virtues that are to be\nbrought to a stage of perfection (p\u0101ramit\u0101). The\nvirtues to be perfected are generosity; good habits of thought, word\nand deed; patience; courage; meditation; wisdom; proselytizing skill;\napplication of vows; strength of character; and transcendental\nknowledge. The chapter dedicated to the sixth stage, at which wisdom\nis cultivated to perfection, is the chapter in which Candrak\u012brti\nlays out his most detailed exposition of the Madhyamaka school of\nphilosophy. Candrak\u012brti begins this chapter with the claim that\nwisdom is like a sighted person who is capable of leading a group of\nblind people safely to a destination; similarly, wisdom guides all the\nother virtues to their destination of perfection. As for the content\nof wisdom, it is the realization that no phenomena come into being.\nPhenomena cannot arise from themselves, since that possibility would\nmake arising unnecessary or redundant; if a thing already exists, it\nhas no need to come into being. If, on the other hand, it were allowed\nthat one being might rise out of a being other than itself, then there\nwould be nothing to prevent one from saying that pitch darkness arises\nout of light. Another way of looking at the issue of production from\ncauses is that the effect either already exists in the cause or it\ndoes not exist. If it already exists, it has no need or coming into\nbeing. If it does not exist, then it cannot be an agent that does the\naction of coming into being; but if there is no agent, then there is\nno action.\n\nAfter showing that there cannot be any intelligible account of the\narising of phenomena, Candrak\u012brti acknowledges that in everyday\nexperience we encounter phenomena coming into being all the time. This\nleads to a discussion of the two truths. The ultimate truth\u2014that\nis, truth concerning the highest goal\u2014is that phenomena do not\ncome into being; the conventional transactional truth, on the other\nhand, is that things do come into being and that their arising is\nconditioned. This conventional truth can therefore be understood as a\nkind of screen, an obstacle that stands in the way of seeing the\nultimate truth. In other words, the putative truths of quotidian life\nare actually delusions that, if believed, prevent one from attaining\nthe wisdom that is capable of leading to the imperturbable peace of\nnirvana. The truth of the highest goal cannot be conveyed in language;\nit can only be manifested in silence. That notwithstanding, the Buddha\ngave many teachings in words, so how is one to understand that? The\nBuddha, said Candrak\u012brti, spoke according to the linguistic\nconventions of the people to whom he talked. It is conventional to use\npronouns such as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d and words like\n\u201cself\u201d; without such pronouns, grammatically correct\nsentences cannot be formed. It does not follow from grammatical\ncorrectness, however, that those words used in sentences have\nreferents. The Buddha\u2019s insight was that there is no self, and\nyet he used the sort of conventional language that is commonly used by\nthose who do believe that there is a self. Similarly, even though the\nBuddha realized that there are no phenomena coming into being and\nperishing, he spoke the same kinds of sentences used by those who\nbelieve that phenomena come into being through conditions and then\nperish when the conditions that sustain them are no longer operative.\nIf one is going to use language at all, then one cannot avoid using\nwords and constructions that apparently commit one to accepting the\npresuppositions upon which language rests. It is the task of the\nM\u0101dhyamika philosopher to expose those presuppositions as\nuntenable, to see that language is not grounded in realities but is\npurely conventional in nature. The Buddha, knowing what kinds of\nbeliefs his listeners had, gave doctrines that helped people get past\ntheir false beliefs. For example, to those who believed in an enduring\nand unified and essentially independent self, says Candrak\u012brti,\nthe Buddha taught that the self is not to be found in any of the\naspects of being human that might be a candidate for being regarded as\na self; he taught that the self is not the body, the personality,\nawareness, thoughts or feelings or anything else that arises through\ncauses and conditions, nor is there anything outside those things that\ncounts as a candidate for what people intuitively take to be their\nselves. To people who were inclined to a materialistic monism, the\nBuddha emphasized the importance of the mind as something that is\nindependent of the body. (About this, more will be said below.)\n\nAs was discussed above\n (section 4.2),\n Bh\u0101vaviveka criticized Buddhap\u0101lita for failing to state\nand defend the thesis of the M\u0101dhyamikas. In the first chapter of\nhis commentary to MMK, Candrak\u012brti comes to\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s defense and offers a sustained criticism of\nBh\u0101vaviveka, and of the tradition of Dign\u0101ga on whom\nBh\u0101vaviveka had based much of his approach.\nBh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s call for an independent argument in favor of\na conclusion accepted by M\u0101dhyamikas, says Candrak\u012brti, is\ndiametrically opposed to what N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and \u0100ryadeva\nhad written. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had written in VV that he has no\nthesis to advance. He had also written that he apprehends no objects\nat all and therefore has no need to affirm or deny anything, and since\nhe neither affirms nor denies any proposition, he need not supply any\nreasons to justify his stance. And \u0100ryadeva had written that a\nperson who makes no claims, either that anything exists or that\nsomething does not exist, cannot be refuted. Candrak\u012brti cites\nthose passages with the additional comment that Buddhap\u0101lita had\nunderstood the spirit of Madhyamaka as set forth by those early\nM\u0101dhyamikas. The M\u0101dhyamika, Candrak\u012brti goes on to\nexplain, does not put forward counter positions in opposition to the\nclaims of other philosophers; rather, he shows the problems involved\nin the positions of others and argues only until the other\nphilosophers realize the inadequacy of their positions and become\nsilent. In the process of bringing others to silence, the\nM\u0101dhyamika need not construct formal arguments, nor need he be\nconsistent in what he says. Following \u0100ryadeva\u2019s\nobservation, Candrak\u012brti says that the M\u0101dhyamika cannot be\nrefuted, precisely because he has no position to defend. If\nBuddhap\u0101lita had put forth arguments, then he would have opened\nhimself up to endless disputation; since, however, he knew that the\npurpose of Madhyamaka is to bring all disputation, and indeed all\nkinds of idle chatter, to an end, he wisely avoided putting forth\nformal arguments that a persistent opponent might take as an\ninvitation to debate. If Bh\u0101vaviveka had understood the point of\nMadhyamaka, concludes Candrak\u012brti, he would not have made the\ncriticisms he made of Buddhap\u0101lita.\n\nAfter offering his criticisms of Bh\u0101vaviveka, Candrak\u012brti\naddresses the school of Buddhist logic and epistemology founded by\nDign\u0101ga. The followers of this school did not present themselves\nas M\u0101dhyamikas, so Candrak\u012brti does not accuse them of\nhaving failed to understand N\u0101g\u0101rjuna properly. He does,\nhowever, confront them with having failed to supply a convincing\nresponse to the radical critique N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had made of the\nvery enterprise of grounding convictions on indisputable foundations.\nHe recapitulates a passage of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s VV in which\nit is said that any proposition that is supposed to be warranted must\nrest upon a foundation of either direct experience or one of three\nkinds of reasoning. But the very claim that a proposition is warranted\nby a foundation is itself a proposition, and as such it must either\nrequire a warrant of its own or be deemed self-validating. If it\nrequires a warrant of its own, the result will be an infinite regress\nof propositions needing warrants; if it is declared self-validating,\nthen why not say of all propositions they are self-validating?\nDign\u0101ga and his followers went ahead and talked about the\ngrounding of propositions as if N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had never\nquestioned the enterprise. Unless they provide a clear and convincing\nresponse to what N\u0101g\u0101rjuna said, there is no reason for\nanyone to take them seriously.\n\nOne further Buddhist movement that Candrak\u012brti criticizes is the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which he presents as advocating a form of\nsubjective idealism. Their claim that the world of experience is\nconsciousness only and that the contents of consciousness cannot be\nobjects external to consciousness itself is supported by several texts\nwithin the Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptural tradition. Candrak\u012brti\nexplains these scriptures as examples of teachings that the Buddha\ngave to counter a particular kind of commonly held wrong view. There\nare, says Candrak\u012brti, those who mistakenly believe that all\ntheir suffering is due to causes outside themselves; they see\nthemselves as unfortunate victims of a hostile world. The Buddha,\nwishing to make it clear that the predominant factor in\ndissatisfaction is the way one thinks about one\u2019s experiences,\nsaid, in effect \u201cIt\u2019s all in the mind.\u201d It would be\na mistake to take that statement literally and to conclude that\nnothing but consciousness exists and that the world of experience that\nfeels as though it is external to consciousness is in fact produced by\nconsciousness or is inseparable from consciousness. The\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra offers good reasons to show that the contents of\nconsciousness are conditioned and therefore are empty of inherent\nexistence, but they fail to appreciate that exactly the same can be\nsaid of awareness itself. In other words, says Candrak\u012brti, the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophers fail to acknowledge that\neverything, including consciousness itself, is empty.\n\nIn making the kinds of criticisms of other philosophers that\nCandrak\u012brti makes, he repeatedly advocates for taking ordinary\nexperience seriously and at face value. In everyday experience, we\nfeel that things arise and perish because of causes and conditions,\nand we feel that we are conscious subjects on whom an external world\nis impinging. We communicate with one another in readily\ncomprehensible language. There is no reason to change any of that, no\nreason to replace everyday language with a more precise technical\nlanguage that helps avoid misrepresenting the nature of things. At the\nsame time, it is important to be aware that it cannot be shown that\nthings have fixed natures and that there is no reason to believe about\nany of our beliefs that they are grounded. The task of philosophy for\nCandrak\u012brti is not to replace unwarranted beliefs with justified\ntrue beliefs, but to break the habit of forming beliefs, declaring\nthem to be true, and then becoming attached to them.\n6. \u015a\u0101ntideva\n6.1 Life and works\n\nAccording to traditional biographies, \u015a\u0101ntideva was born the\nson of a king but abandoned the royal household for life as a Buddhist\nmonk. Best estimates of the time of his activity place him at the end\nof the seventh century. His best-known (and most frequently\ntranslated) work is Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction\nto the practice of enlightenment), also called\nBodhisattvacary\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to the\npractice of the bodhisattva). He also compiled\n\u015aik\u1e63\u0101samuccaya, an annotated collection of\npassages from Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures for students, and he\nauthored a commentary to Vasubandhu\u2019s\nTri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101, a key text in the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra tradition. Partly because he was a masterful\nstylist and wrote delightfully beautiful Sanskrit verse, and partly\nbecause his work exerted a strong influence on Tibetan Buddhism,\n\u015aantideva has been the focus of a considerable amount of modern\nscholarship in Japan, Europe and North America. All this makes him a\ngood access point into Madhyamaka philosophy for those who are not\nspecialists in Indian philosophy.\n\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra is a verse composition divided\ninto ten chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of the\ntraditional depiction of the bodhisattva\u2019s career. The topics of\nthe ten chapters are as follows:\n\nIn praise of bodhicitta, the aspiration to become\nenlightened for the liberation of all sentient beings\nA reflection on cultivating good character through the confession\nof one\u2019s personal shortcomings\nOn acquiring bodhicitta\nOn cultivating watchfulness with respect to\nbodhicitta\nOn the guarding of awareness\nOn the perfection of patience\nOn the perfection of courage\nOn the perfection of meditation\nOn the perfection of wisdom\nOn giving the merits accrued by cultivating virtues to all those\nsuffering beings in need of merit\n\n\nAs is the case with most philosophical works written in verse,\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra is usually studied with a prose\ncommentary. \u015a\u0101ntideva himself provided no prose commentary\nto his work, but a Sanskrit commentary by Praj\u00f1\u0101karamati\nis still extant and is usually consulted by those who translate the\nwork into English from the original Sanskrit.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s work is also preserved in Tibetan\ntranslation and is furnished with several Tibetan commentaries, which\nare routinely consulted by those who translate\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra into English from its Tibetan\ntranslation.\n6.2 Contributions\n\nAlthough beautifully written, Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra does\nnot display much philosophical originality. Its principal contribution\nis in offering a concise recapitulation of the currents of Madhyamaka\nthought and of Madhyamaka arguments against Yog\u0101c\u0101ra monism,\nwhich portrays consciousness as the ultimate source of all realities.\nWhile that is generally the case, one candidate for novelty occurs in\nearlier chapters of Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra, where\n\u015a\u0101ntideva provides a line of argument that became standard\nin discussion of Mah\u0101y\u0101na ethics. His claim is that pain and\nunhappiness are by definition that which those who experience them\nwish to avoid. But given that there are no inherent natures that\ndistinguish one person from another, or one kind of person from\nanother kind, there is no rational basis to prefer one\u2019s own\nexperiences and judgments to those of anyone else or to prefer what\none perceives as one\u2019s own kind from other kinds of people. It\nis fundamentally irrational to take an interest only in one\u2019s\nown pain and suffering; the only reasonable approach is to be\nconcerned with all the pain and unhappiness of which one\nbecomes aware and to try to eradicate all of it without making\nartificial distinctions. Since, however, most of what anyone finds\npainful and unpleasant arises from the conviction that some objects of\nexperience are inherently undesirable or impure, the best strategy to\nfollow in helping oneself and others overcome pain and suffering is to\nshow that there is no basis for the belief that some objects are\ninherently undesirable or impure. That strategy also works, of course,\nwhen unhappiness arises from the frustration of not getting things\nthat one falsely believes are inherently desirable and pure.\n\nAs was the case with Candrak\u012brti\u2019s\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra has the most to say about\nMadhyamaka philosophy in the chapter on the perfection of wisdom. A\nkey verse in this chapter is 9.35, which says \u201cWhen neither\npresence nor absence stands before the mind, the mind, having no\ncontent, calms down because of the absence of cognition.\u201d This\nrecapitulates a point made by both N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nCandrak\u012brti that the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is\nnirvana, a stillness of the mind in which there is no object being\ngrasped as the focus of awareness, no narratives\n(prapa\u00f1ca) being told to account for one\u2019s\nexperience, no theorizing and no argumentation. At the outset of the\nchapter on wisdom \u015a\u0101ntideva says that the ultimate truth is\nof a reality that is not within range of the intellect; the intellect\noperates only at the level of conventional truth. In this world there\nare two kinds of human being, which \u015a\u0101ntideva calls ordinary\npeople (pr\u0101k\u1e5bta loka) and meditators\n(yogin). The ordinary people are those who see the world in\nterms of presences and absences, being and non-being, but the\nconventional truths in which they trade are set aside by the truths of\nthe meditators. The principal delusion of those who rely on\nconventional truths is that they mistakenly believe that propositions\nconventionally accepted as truth are grounded in the natures of\nthings. Meditators, on the other hand, come to realize that things do\nnot have inherent natures. That things do not have inherent natures\ncannot be established directly, but attempts to show that things do\nhave inherent natures can be shown to be faulty. One who has\ncultivated the intention to become enlightened in order to lead others\nout of their delusion-driven suffering uses language to help people\nrealize the limitations of language and conceptual thinking. In taking\nthis approach, \u015a\u0101ntideva is clearly following the lead of\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Candrak\u012brti.\n7. J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\n7.1 Life and works\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, who was most probably the teacher of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, probably lived in the early eighth\ncentury. Because his presentation of Madhyamaka incorporates much of\nthe terminology used by Dharmak\u012brti, a member of the\nepistemological tradition founded by Dign\u0101ga, he is usually\nportrayed as a follower of Bh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s approach to\nMadhyamaka. Like his disciple \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha also incorporates aspects of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy into his presentation of Madhyamaka and\ncan therefore be seen as a source of inspiration to those who strove\nto find a synthesis of the two principal schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism. He wrote a commentary to a key Mah\u0101y\u0101na scripture,\nSandhinirmocanas\u016btra, which was one of the principal\nsources of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy. He is best known for an\nindependent treatise called\nSatya-dvaya-vibha\u1e45ga-k\u0101rik\u0101 (Verses on the\ndistinction between the two truths), on which he also provided a prose\ncommentary. The verse text along with its commentary can be referred\nto together as Satyadvayavibha\u1e45ga.\n7.2 Contributions\n\nLike all the M\u0101dhyamika thinkers who came before him,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha regards it vitally important to have a clear\nunderstanding of two kinds of truth, the conventional and\ntransactional truth of everyday life, and the truth that liberates one\nfrom attachment, aversion and delusion, this liberation being the\nultimate goal (param\u0101rtha) of Buddhism. In talking about\nthese two truths, J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha draws liberally from the\nwork of Dharmak\u012brti, who had in turn built upon the\nepistemological foundations laid by Dign\u0101ga. Dharmak\u012brti had\nsaid that successful action is preceded by correct cognitions; what\none deems to be truthful is any cognition that motivates action that\nleads to expected results. A true belief, then, is one that does not\ndeceive one by promising to lead to a desired goal and then failing\nsomehow to lead to that goal. A more positive way of expressing this,\nrather than saying a true belief is non-deceptive, is to say that a\ntrue belief is one that enables the realization of a goal\n(artha-kriy\u0101-samartha). It turns out, said\nDharmak\u012brti, that correct reasoning is instrumental in helping\none form beliefs that motivate successful action. Therefore, one can\nsay that conceptual thinking, when done carefully, can be of great\nvalue. Even when one\u2019s goal is to achieve nirvana by having a\ndirect experience of a still and peaceful awareness that is not\nconceptual and therefore beyond the range of language, one can arrive\nat that goal by learning to think carefully and clearly. Clear and\ncareful thinking has the capacity to identify which of the ideas that\narise in consciousness are ungrounded and delusional and therefore\nunlikely to motivate successful action. Clear and careful thinking\nabout what one hears others say enables one to discard teachings that,\nif acted upon, are unlikely to produce expected results and to follow\nteachings that, if acted upon, will lead one to a desired goal, even\nthe goal of the stillness of a mind that is not dealing in narratives\nand concepts. Without much modification, J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha takes\nup Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s terminology and the convictions that go\nwith it. So J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, like Bh\u0101vaviveka, sees value\nin conceptual thinking and in careful thinking and speaking and sees\nless of a need than Candrak\u012brti and \u015a\u0101ntideva saw in\nfinding a way to eliminate all conceptual thinking and theorizing.\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s indebtedness to the epistemological\ntradition notwithstanding, he is still very much a M\u0101dhyamika in\nthat much of his approach consists in showing the absurdities that\nlurk menacingly inside all constructed theories. His notion of the\nultimate goal, like Candrak\u012brti\u2019s, is a wordless and\nconcept-free lucid awareness, but he sees it as possible to reach that\ngoal by using words and thoughts intelligently. Moreover, he agrees\nwith other M\u0101dhyamikas in his conviction that all thinking, even\nthat which can be called verdical because it leads to expected\nresults, is based on a presupposition that things have inherent\nnatures\u2014it is, after all, almost impossible to talk without at\nleast an implicit nod in the direction of inherent natures and\nessences\u2014and that that presupposition is demonstrably false. So\naccording to J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha rational thinking is\nsimultaneously veridical, in that it leads to expected results, and\nfalse, in that it is based upon the demonstrably false presupposition\nthat things that can be named are namable because they have inherent\nnatures. While language operates within an ontology of causes and\neffects and various other kinds of relationship, such as temporal and\nspatial relationships, it can be shown that those relationships are\nall untenable if one thinks about them carefully and investigates them\ndeeply enough.\n\nAt the heart of J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s argument against the\ntenability of causality is his argument that none of the possible ways\nof looking at the relation of conditions and their effects are\nworkable. There are four possibilities. Either many conditions produce\na single effect, or many conditions produce many effects, or a single\ncondition produces many effects, or a single condition produces a\nsingle effect. His presentation of an explanation for why each of\nthese possibilities is untenable is in places terse and difficult to\ndecipher. A single thing, such as vision, cannot be the effect of many\nconditions, such as the eye, visible color, an attentive mind and so\nforth, he says, because the effect has the feature of being one, while\nthe causes are many, but there is nothing to account for what causes\nthe reduction of many things to one. Without some coherent account of\nhow a manifold can be reduced to a singularity, this hypothesis ends\nup being merely an assertion. If one imagines that a manifold set of\ncauses produces a complex multiplicity of effects, then one is saying\nin effect that each component of the complex cause is producing one\ncomponent of the complex effect, and this amounts to saying that there\nare many instances of one cause producing one effect. On the other\nhand, if one thinks that each aspect of the complex effect is a single\neffect of the totality of features within the complex cause, then one\nis saying that a single effect has many conditions, which has already\nbeen ruled out. Moreover, one faces the problem of explaining how the\nsame totality of causes can have many distinct effects, each of which\nis a feature of the complex effect putatively arising from the causal\ncomplex. If one imagines that a multiplicity, such as the manifold\nuniverse, arises out of a single cause, such as God or Brahman or\nconsciousness, then one must provide a coherent account of what causes\nthe differentiation among the many effects. What one would expect is\nthat some auxiliary condition combines with the single cause to\nproduce different effects; but if that is the case, then a single\ncause plus an auxiliary condition is not really just a single cause.\nFinally, one might imagine that a single cause produces a single\neffect, such as when one momentary phenomenon perishes and in the act\nof perishing gives rise to a subsequent momentary phenomenon of the\nsame kind. That, however, is impossible, since the putative cause must\ngo entirely out of existence before its successor can takes its place,\nand once the preceding phenomenon has ceased to exist, there is\nnothing to cause its successor to arise. Since none of the possible\nways of explaining causality turns out to survive close analysis, one\ncan only conclude that the very ideas of causality, and of arising and\nperishing, and of unity and multiplicity cannot correspond to reality.\nCausality and arising and perishing and all the various relations that\nfurnish the framework of conventional truth may be indispensable to\nconventional truth, but they cannot be features of reality.\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, like the M\u0101dhyamikas who came before\nhim, sees conventional truth as a kind of screen or obstacle to the\nreality that becomes apparent only to an awareness that is\nunencumbered by concepts and narratives.\n8. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n8.1 Life and works\n\nWhile it is difficult to find much reliable information about the\nlives of most Indian philosophers, quite a bit is known about the\nlife, especially the later life, of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\ndetails of whose life were recorded by Tibetans when he went to Tibet\nin about 763 and became the first abbot of Bsam-yas monastery. He was\nreportedly born into the royal family of what is now Bengal and spent\nhis adult life in various Buddhist monastic universities. It is clear\nfrom his writings that he had studied all branches of Indian\nphilosophy extensively. He seems to have been a direct disciple of\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, and his own disciple, Kamala\u015b\u012bla,\nwas also an influential thinker. Together \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Kamala\u015b\u012bla, both of whom spent many years in Tibet, set\nthe tone for Buddhist scholasticism in the eighth century, and their\ninfluence is felt in Tibetan Buddhism to this day. When\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita died in 788, he was succeeded by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, who lived until 795.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s magnum opus is a composition\nentitled Tattva-sa\u1e43graha (Summary of reality), which\ncontains 3645 verses. The work was provided with a prose commentary by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla called\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha-pa\u00f1jik\u0101. A modern edition\nof the verse work and its commentary together runs to more than 1100\npages. Aside from its contribution to the development of Madhyamaka\nthought, the work is also a valuable source of information about the\nstate of Indian philosophy in the eighth century. The work is divided\ninto twenty-six chapters, the topics of which are as follows:\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya doctrine of primodial matter\n(prak\u1e5bti) as the source of the physical world\nVarious doctrines of God as the source of the world\nThe doctrine of inherent natures (svabh\u0101va) as the\nsource of the world\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s doctrine of Brahman-as-language as the\nsource of the world\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga doctrine of human spirit\n(puru\u1e63a)\nExamination of the doctrines of the self (\u0101tman) in\nthe Ny\u0101ya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, S\u0101\u1e43khya,\nDigambara Jaina, Advaita and Buddhist personalist\n(pudgalav\u0101din) schools\nThe doctrine of the permanence of things\nVarious doctrines of karma and its ripening\nA critical examination of substance\nA critical examination of quality\nA critical examination of action\nA critical examination of universals\nA critical examination of particularity\nA critical examination of inherence (the relation between\nuniversals and particulars and between substances and qualities)\nAn examination of words and their meanings\nAn examination of sense perception\nAn examination of inference\nAn examination of other means of acquiring knowledge\nA critical examination of Jaina epistemology\nAn examination of time\nA critical examination of materialism\nOn the external world (that is, the world external to\nconsciousness)\nA critical examination of revelation as a source of knowledge\nExamination of the idea that some propositions are\nself-validating\nExamination of the notion of supernormal powers\n\n\nIn addition to Tattvasa\u1e43graha,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita wrote commentaries on\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya (Methods of\ndebate) and J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s\nSatyadvayavibha\u1e45ga. His most original contribution to\nthe development of Madhyamaka philosophy is a verse treatise called\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (Ornament of Centrism),\nwhich contains ninety-seven stanzas, to which he also provided a prose\ncommentary.\n8.2 Contributions\n\nBy the time \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was active, the philosophy of\nthe Yogac\u0101ra school had become so influential that it could not\neasily be dismissed. Whereas earlier M\u0101dhyamikas wrote\nrefutations of the Yog\u0101cara doctrine, which they presented as a\nkind of subjective idealism, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita embraced it.\nLike Bh\u0101vaviveka and J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita adopted much of the terminology and the\nlogic and epistemology of Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti and their\nlater followers. But whereas Bh\u0101vaviveka had refrained from\nfollowing Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s lead into\nYogac\u0101ra, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita endorsed a kind of\nsubjective idealism, albeit as a stage that prepared one for the\nMadhyamaka doctrine of the emptiness of all phenomena. Toward the end\nof Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, in verses 92\u201393,\nhe writes that by embracing the doctrine of mind only, one stops\ntaking external objects as real; then by embracing Madhyamaka, one\nrealizes that no objects at all have substance; then, taking the reins\nof reasoning, one rides the chariot of both systems as a single great\nvehicle (mah\u0101y\u0101na). The largest part of this\ntreatise\u2014where the reins of reasoning are taken up\u2014is\ndevoted to an extended version of the \u201cneither one nor\nmany\u201d argument that had been presented by\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha.\n\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra begins with the observation\nthat if a phenomenon has an essential nature, then either that nature\nis simple or complex, that is, it is either a single thing or many\nthings; there is no third possibility. This leads to discussions of\ndoctrines by several schools of Indian philosophy, both Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist. Each of the schools examined posits at least one entity\nthat is completely uniform in nature and therefore has no internal\ndifferentiations. Several schools posit a uniform entity that is said\nto be the single source of all multiplicity. Drawing on arguments by\nearlier Buddhist thinkers such as Dharmak\u012brti,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that if there were a uniform,\npermanent and unobstructed singularity, then everything it supposedly\ncauses would have to exist all the time. A cause is something in the\npresence of which an effect arises and in the absence of which the\neffect does not arise. But if a cause is permanent, then it is never\nabsent, so none of its putative effects can ever be absent. In a\ntheory that posits a single permanent cause of all things, there is no\nsatisfactory account of all the changes that are experienced in daily\nlife, nor is there any satisfactory account of temporal sequences or\nthe fact that things exist in some places but not in others. This\nargument is applied to discredit the S\u0101\u1e43khya doctrine of\nprimordial matter, the Ny\u0101ya doctrine of God, and the\nVed\u0101ntin doctrine of Brahman. It is also applied to the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine that all things arise from consciousness.\nAfter arguing against the main candidates for singularity nominated by\nthe various schools, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita turns his attention\nto multiplicity. The very idea of multiplicity, he notes, only makes\nsense if one is talking about a collection of singularities. Given,\nhowever, that there are no singularities, there cannot be any\ncollection of them. This being the case, no inherent nature of any\nentity can be either singular or multiple; if an entity has neither a\nsingular nor a multiple inherent nature, it has no inherent nature at\nall. In other words, all phenomena are empty of inherent natures.\n",
