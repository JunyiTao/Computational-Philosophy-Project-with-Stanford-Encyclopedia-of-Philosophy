    "main_text": "Evolutionary: Biological Explanations of Why Morals Evolved || The Debunking Argument from Moral Objectivism\n4.2 The Debunking Argument from Moral Objectivism\n\n\nIn the past decade a new style of evolutionary debunking argument has\nemerged that pits moral objectivism against the Darwinian origins of\nmorals. While moral naturalism in some forms may not be at odds with\nunderstanding core moral beliefs as having a biological basis, such\nbeliefs, it is argued, cannot embody objective moral knowledge in a\nrobust sense. We must in effect choose between the Darwinian\nexplanation and fully objective moral knowledge. Sharon Street (2006)\npresses this dilemma with careful attention to possible replies. She\nacknowledges that the kind of moral naturalism advanced by Peter\nRailton (1986) is compatible with the evolutionary basis of our core\nmoral beliefs but argues that the price of embracing such naturalism\nis to give up thinking of moral truths as having the kind of objective\nstatus that moral philosophers often attribute to them. She is happy\nto pay that price, but others have contended that the assumption of\nobjectivity, in particular moral realism, is built into how moral\nknowledge is commonly understood (Mackie 1977, Joyce 2006).For the\nlatter group the dilemma presents an attack on the existence of moral\nknowledge, as most of us understand the concept. Since the aim of this\nessay is to review the issues concerning whether genuine moral\nknowledge is possible, we need to assess the merits of this debunking\nargument, paying close attention to how the ideal of objectivity is\nunderstood in this context.\n\n\nExactly what does the required objectivity consist in? Street,\nfollowing Russ Shafer-Landau (2003, p. 15), says that a moral truth\n(or fact) is objective in the sense required by morality when it is\n\u201cstance-independent,\u201d when, that is, it would hold independently of all\nour evaluative attitudes, taken collectively, whether we have them now\nor would have them on reflection under ideal conditions. Evaluative\nattitudes include \u201cdesires, attitudes of approval or disapproval,\nunreflective evaluative tendencies such as the tendency to experience\nX as counting in favor of or demanding Y, and consciously or\nunconsciously held evaluative judgments, such as judgments about what\nis a reason for what, about what one should do or ought to do, about\nwhat is good, valuable, or worthwhile, about what is morally right or\nwrong, and so on\u201d (Street 2006, p. 110). An implication of this\nunderstanding of objectivity, as Street points out, is that it cannot\nbe the case that what we now take to be moral truths or facts are\nobjective in the required sense but could have been different, and\nstill objectively true or factual, if humans had evolved\ndifferently. For example, the following cannot be objectively true: in\ngeneral people are not morally required to sacrifice themselves for\nthe entire community, but they would have been so required if we had\nevolved more on the model of social insects. If moral truths or facts\nwere contingent on evolution in this way (as they would be, to give\nanother example, if moral facts were identified with facts about which\nmoral values would favor diversity in the human gene pool, Wilson\n1978, p. 205), they could not be objective in the strict way demanded\nby Shafer-Landau. (See also Kahane 2011, on the role of moral\nobjectivism in debunking morals.)\n\n\nThere are two ways to go if one wishes to defend the possibility of\nmoral knowledge against the argument from moral objectivism. One is to\nreject the concept of stance-independent objectivity as a necessary\ncondition on moral truth. Studies show that even young children after\na certain age make an intuitive distinction between conventional\ndemands and moral demands (Nichols 2004). Basic moral demands unlike\nconventional ones are taken to be independent of authority (for\nexample, that of a teacher in a classroom) and to be independent of\ntime and place (to apply universally to all persons). These features\nappear to capture at least part of what it is for a moral demand to be\nobjective. Note, however, that these features are not enough to\nguarantee stance-independence. For example, physical pain, considered\njust in itself, is plausibly considered to be universally bad for the\nperson experiencing it, apart from what any authority might decree,\nyet this moral truth is arguably not stance-independent. Why? An\nessential part of what constitutes the experience of physical pain is\nto have a sensation towards which one has a negative evaluative\nresponse. This last part of the experience is what makes it bad for\nthe person suffering pain. But then, its being intrinsically bad is a\ntruth that is stance-dependent. If this argument is sound, we\nmust accept moral skepticism about the objective badness of pain for\nthe person suffering it or else understand the intrinsic badness of\npain for the person who has it not to be objective in this strong\nsense. (Street offers a more complex argument to the same conclusion:\nStreet 2006, pp. 144\u201352.) Given this dilemma a possible line of\ndefense is to argue that in light of such examples the objectivity of\nmoral truth does not entail stance-independence.\n\n\nThe other option is to meet the challenge head-on and argue in the\ncase of a particular moral theory that core moral truths in this\ntheory would be stance-independent and also compatible with the\nDarwinian evolution of morals. David Copp (2008) pursues this course\nof argument using his society-centered moral theory sketched\nearlier. He argues that because moral truth on his theory concerns the\nneeds of human society, one can expect that under propitious\nconditions the more biologically fit moral inclinations would tend to\ntrack (or \u201cquasi-track,\u201d his term) certain core moral truths. Copp\u2019s\nargument is complex, but it presents a possible avenue of defense that\nis worth consideration.\n",
