    "main_text": "Defining Latinx Philosophy || Source vs. Subject Matter\n4. Ongoing Developments\n\nGiven how the contents of Latinx philosophy has been partly propelled\nby the experiences and interests of Latinxs, it plausibly matters that\nthe demographics of the philosophers working on Latinx philosophy is\nchanging. A substantial portion of the early work in Latinx\nphilosophy, especially work recognized as straightforwardly academic\nphilosophy, has been done by scholars who were born outside of the\nUnited\n States.[22]\n Over the past decade, however, there has been a marked increase of\nwork on Latinx philosophy by US-born philosophers, and in particular,\nby Mexican American philosophers. Along with this change has been\nincreased attention in the idea of a specifically \u201cMexican\nAmerican philosophy\u201d. It remains to be seen the extent to which\nthose working on issues within the ambit of Latinx philosophy will\ncontinue to focus on a broader Latinx landscape, as previous\ngenerations have done, or whether newer work will tend to focus on\nmore narrowly circumscribed topics.\n\nQuestions about the demographic makeup of the philosophers and its\nconsequences for the discipline has been a matter of increased\nattention the academy. Presumably, these discussions will continue\nuntil as long as academics remain concerned about discrepancies\nbetween the academy and the populations it serves. However, one thread\nthat is oftentimes implicit but only infrequently taken up concerns\nthe possibility of duties (real or imagined, moral or otherwise) that\nLatinx scholars have to undertake engagement with Latin American and\nLatinx philosophy (Gracia 2000: 159\u2013188; J.L.A. Garc\u00eda\n2001: 96\u20137; Covarrubias 2015). It is imaginable that as Latinx\nphilosophy grows, questions about who does it, what falls into its\nambit, and whether there are obligations to do Latinx philosophical\nscholarship in particular ways, will animate discussions within parts\nof the field.\n\nA third ongoing development involves more explicit ties between\nphilosophical work in Latin America and the United States In this\ncontext, a US-based academic field focused on Latinxs risks\nperpetuating epistemically and morally fraught practices with respect\nto Latin Americans. As noted above, a number of philosophers working\nin Latinx philosophy explicitly draw from and interact with aspects of\nLatin American philosophy. Similarly, there is some evidence of Latin\nAmerican attention on the work of US Latinx\n philosophy.[23]\n Given the differences in comparative support, visibility, and global\nprestige of academic work within the United States, it seems plausible\nthat academic work on Latinx philosophy in the United States will go a\nlong way towards defining the field internationally, including its\nterminology and its chief subjects. It is this fact\u2014US academic\ninfluence on the global academy, and the way it can occlude the\ncontributions and work of those outside the US scene\u2014that\nprovides the background for a worrisome set of possibilities about how\nwe understand Latinxs and their philosophical significance.\n\nFrom the standpoint of US-based academics, this risk may not be\nobvious. After all, the subject just is US populations, their\nexperiences, and the philosophical issues they raise. However, Latinxs\nare not just US populations. Latinxs are also, for example,\nmembers of the Salvadoran diaspora, indigenous Oaxacan laborers,\nArgentinian ex-patriate academics, and so on. Once we recognize these\nfacts, it is less obvious that US identity categories and frameworks\nshould be taken as presumptive, fundamental, or guiding when it comes\nto understanding the philosophical\u2014phenomenological, conceptual,\nsocial, moral, political, etc.\u2014significance of these\npopulations. Moreover, taking US identity categories as presumptive\nalso threatens to re-enact a tradition of\ndomination-and-description-from-without that has plagued Latin America\nsince its inception. So, given the fact of a field constructed on US\nidentity categories, and given the fact of US influence on the global\nacademy, the construction of the field\u2019s categories and\npractices (and who may speak authoritatively about them) may itself\nbecome an important subject matter, especially in Latinx-Latin\nAmerican academic discussions.\n\nA final development worth noting here concerns methodological\nfrictions. There are philosophers working in Latinx philosophy whose\nphilosophical work is substantively structured by liberationist,\nactivist, or praxis-oriented methodologies. At the same time, there\nare philosophers working on Latinx philosophy who are drawn to other\nconceptions of philosophy, including versions committed to something\nlike a putatively disinterested search for truth, and/or philosophy in\nthe mode of a love of wisdom. Competing visions about what work is\nmethodologically preferable is a matter of ongoing contestation.\n\nThat said, it is not always clear that these differences in\nphilosophical orientation have the significance they are ordinarily\ntaken to have. Accounts of the phenomenology of racialized identities\nin the US subject to immigration pressures might speak to broader\nfeatures of human beings. At the same time, putatively\nnon-liberationist accounts of, say, the structure of responsible\nagency and how oppression alters it, might be thought to provide\nresources of its own for more straightforwardly liberationist\ntheories. So, although the broadly liberationist and\ntheory-for-its-own-sake threads of the subfield may sometimes find\nthemselves at cross-purposes, it is unclear that these disagreements\nneed to result in a deep fissure in the field. For the field as a\nwhole, one aspiration might be for philosophical work to have\n\u201cexemplary validity\u201d, i.e., philosophy that teaches us\nsomething about wider features of humanity without losing its cultural\nspecificity.\n\nStill, there is reason for caution. Philosophical fights about\nmethodology have consequences for what is viewed as inside and outside\nof a field. Moreover, scholars have noted that philosophical borders\nare oftentimes particularly vigorously patrolled\u2014and worse, that\nthis has been especially so for work in Latinx (Ortega 2016:\n4\u20135) and Latin American (Vargas 2007: 61\u201363) philosophy.\nFor that reason, it is very likely that what counts as\n\u201cgood\u201d work, or even as part of the field, will remain a\ncontested matter.\n",
