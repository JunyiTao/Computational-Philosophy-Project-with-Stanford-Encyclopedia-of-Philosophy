    "main_text": "Luther on Freedom of the Will\n4. Luther on Freedom of the Will\n\nJust as Luther\u2019s distinctive conception of justification and\ngrace plays a crucial role in his debates over the value of Aristotle,\nso similar issues play a crucial role in his discussion of a related\nphilosophical issue, namely the value and nature of freedom, both\nhuman and divine. The central text here is of course The Bondage\nof the Will, in which as we have seen Luther engages with Erasmus\non precisely this issue.\n\nThe structure of Luther\u2019s response to Erasmus is largely\ndetermined by the structure of Erasmus\u2019s De libero\narbitrio, as it attempts to reply to Erasmus point by point.\nErasmus\u2019s work begins with a preface and introduction, and ends\nwith a brief epilogue, while in between it has three parts: the first\ndealing with scriptural texts that Erasmus takes to support free\nchoice; the second dealing with texts that might seem to oppose it;\nand the third a part which examines Luther\u2019s earlier arguments\nagainst free choice in his response to the papal condemnation of 1520.\nThis text is Luther\u2019s Assertio omnium articulorum\npublished in December of that year, in which (following John Wyclif (1324\u20131384))\nhe defended and went beyond the claim from the Heidelberg\nDisputation which had been condemned, namely that \u201cFree\nwill, after the Fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what\nit is able to do, it commits a mortal sin\u201d (WA 1:354/LW\n 31:40).[28]\n Correspondingly, Luther\u2019s reply to Erasmus has a brief\nintroduction, and then five main parts: the first two discuss\nErasmus\u2019s preface and introduction; a third part which questions\nErasmus\u2019s use of scriptural passages in support of free choice,\nand a fourth which uses scriptural passages against it; and a fifth\npart which challenges Erasmus\u2019s arguments against the position\nLuther defended in the Assertio, while the final part\nmarshals Luther\u2019s general argument against free choice.\n\nIn an introduction heavy with irony and sarcasm (which sets the\nrhetorical tone for much of the rest of the book, and which so\noffended the urbane Erasmus), Luther apologies for his delay in\nreplying to Erasmus\u2019s Diatribe, but says that the cause\nwas \u201cneither pressure of work, nor the difficulty of the task,\nnor your great eloquence, nor any fear of you\u201d, but rather\n\u201csheer disgust, anger, and contempt\u201d at the quality of\nErasmus\u2019s work, and its \u201cevasive and equivocal\nnature\u201d: \n\n\nyou fancy yourself steering more cautiously than Ulysses between\nScylla and Charybdis as you assert nothing while appearing to assert\nsomething. (WA 18:601\u20132/LW 33:17) \n\n\nNonetheless, Luther declares, he has seen that he really ought to\novercome this aversion and respond to those who have entreated him to\nreply to Erasmus, as in expressing his views he may succeed in winning\nover a reader to the truth and the Spirit that informs Luther\u2019s\nworks, where that reader might even be Erasmus himself.\n\nIn the first main part, which focuses on Erasmus\u2019s preface,\nLuther begins by picking up on Erasmus\u2019s statement that outside\n\u201cthe Holy Scripture\u2026and the decrees of the Church\u201d\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 37]), he is cautious in making assertions, and\neven would prefer the attitude of the Sceptics, who suspend judgement\non complex matters such as free will. In response, Luther rises to the\nbait, where on the one hand Erasmus was clearly contrasting his more\nmodest position with Luther\u2019s own Assertio and sense of\nconviction more generally, as well as on the other hand making a point of referring to\nthe authority of the Church alongside scripture. Against Erasmus,\nLuther argues that scepticism is not an appropriate outlook for\nChristians who are called on to assert their faith as trust in God,\nwhile also criticising him for putting any weight on the decrees of\nthe Church, rather than on scripture alone, which Luther insists is\nclear enough in its essentials and what it tells us, even though the\nmind of God himself may be harder to fathom, and it may be difficult\nfor us to make philosophical sense of doctrines such as the Trinity.\nMoreover, Luther criticises Erasmus for his suggestion that it is not\nin fact necessary for the Christian to try to settle matters relating\nto free will, particularly given the dangers that attach to\nspeculating on such questions. In response, Luther argues that this\nissue cannot be avoided and is central, for \n\n\nas long as [Christians] are ignorant of what and how much they can do,\nthey will not know what they should do; and being ignorant of what\nthey should do, they cannot repent if they do wrong; and impenitence\nis an unforgivable sin\u2026[so] if we do not know these things, we shall know nothing at all of things\nChristian, and shall be worse than any heathen. (WA 18:614/LW 33:35)\n\n\nLikewise, Luther argues, the question of divine foreknowledge and of\nwhether everything happens necessarily is also an issue which cannot\nbe avoided: \n\n\nFor if you doubt or disdain to know that God foreknows all things, not\ncontingently, but necessarily and immutably, how can you believe his\npromises and place a sure trust and reliance on them?\u2026 [T]his\nis the one supreme consolation of Christians in all adversities, to\nknow that God does not lie, but does all things immutably, and that\nhis will can neither be resisted nor changed nor hindered. (WA\n18:619/LW 33:42\u20133) \n\n\nLuther then goes on to criticise Erasmus\u2019s suggestion that\ndiscussion of these issues should be kept from common ears, for fear\nof leading people astray and causing strife, responding that the Word\nof God is not to be supressed, and anyway tumult is to be expected from a\ndoctrine as radical as Christianity. Luther also challenges\nErasmus\u2019s claim that the Lutheran position on free will, even if\nit were true, if widely broadcast would have deleterious effects on\nthe life of the believer, making them more likely to give up any\nattempts to combat their evil, and to no longer believe in a God who\npunishes them for what they cannot control. For Luther, however, this\nis simply to beg the question, as living a better life and believing\nin God are not things we can bring about in ourselves, but only occur\nthrough God. Moreover, on Luther\u2019s account, it is only by\nrecognizing our impotence in these respects, and being thereby humbled\nregarding what we can do and what we can understand, that we have any\nchance of standing in the right relation to God at all.\n\nFinally in this part, Luther turns to consider Erasmus\u2019s\ncontention that there is a fundamental paradox in the idea that\n\u201cwhatever is done by us is done not by free choice but of sheer\nnecessity\u201d (WA 18:139/LW 33:64; cf. Erasmus 1524 [1969: 41]),\nwhere he makes several key claims that will be developed further in\nwhat follows. First, he argues that this is entailed once we accept\nthat our salvation is the work of God, from which it follows that if\nwe do good it is a result of his agency, while if that agency is not\npresent all we can do is what is bad, so that we lack any power of\nchoice in this matter. However, secondly Luther stresses that this\ndoes not mean we are compelled or forced to act as we do, so that \n\n\nby \u201cnecessarily\u201d I do not mean \u201ccompulsorily\u201d\n[coacte], but by the necessity of immutability (as they say)\nand not of compulsion, \n\n\nso that \n\n\nwhen a man is without the Spirit of God he does not do evil against\nhis will [nolens], as if he were taken by the scruff of the\nneck and forced to it, like a thief or a robber carried off against\nhis will to punishment, but he does it of his own accord and with a\nready will [libenti voluntate]. (WA 18:634/LW 33:64) \n\n\nThus, though we lack free choice, we do not lack free will, understood\nas a force that leads us to act, a force that grows stronger the more\nit is resisted. At this point, Luther makes his famous use of the\ntraditional simile, that the human will is like a horse that can fall\nunder two riders, Satan or God, who will determine which way it goes,\nbut like a horse it follows either perfectly willingly: \n\n\nIf God rides it, it wills and goes where God wills, as the psalm says:\n\u201cI am become as a beast [before thee] and I am always with\nthee\u201d [Psalms 73:22\u201323]. If Satan rides it, it wills and\ngoes where Satan will; nor can it choose to run to either of the two\nriders or to seek him out, but the riders themselves contend for the\npossession and control of it. (WA 18:635/LW 33:65\u20136) \n\n\nLuther further argues that as Erasmus himself allows that free choice\nwithout the grace of God is \u201centirely ineffective\u201d\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 41), he does not really disagree with Luther\u2019s\nposition, as \n\n\nto say that free choice exists, and has indeed some power, but that it\nis only an ineffective power, is what the Sophists call oppositum\nin adjecto [a contradiction in terms]. (WA 18:636/LW 33:66) \n\n\nThe only being with genuine free choice, Luther asserts, is God, and\nit is misleading to apply the term to us, so that it would be best if\nwe did not attach it to human beings at all\u2014or if we must\ncontinue to use it, to do so only in relation \u201cto what is\nbeneath him and not what is above him\u201d, where it makes some\nsense to speak of free choice in a limited sense: \n\n\nThat is to say, a man should know that with regard to his faculties\nand possessions he has the right to use, to do, or to leave undone,\naccording to his own free choice, though even this is controlled by\nthe free choice of God alone, who acts in whatever way he pleases. On\nthe other hand in relation to God, or in matters pertaining to\nsalvation or damnation, a man has no free choice, but is a captive,\nsubject and slave either of the will of God or the will of Satan. (WA\n18:638/LW 33:70)\n\n\nIn the second part of his text, Luther turns to Erasmus\u2019s\nintroduction, where Erasmus had questioned Luther\u2019s position on\nthe grounds that few of the saints, Church fathers, and scriptural\nauthorities have adopted a view of this sort. Luther\u2019s response\nis that while these authorities may have said there is free\nchoice, in their actions they have not shown they possess it,\nwhile they also have all conceived of it in rather different ways, so\nit is not clear that there is any consensus here at all\u2014and at\nthe same time, Luther argues that the all-important figure of\nAugustine is on his side, not Erasmus\u2019s as the latter had\nclaimed. Given this confused picture, Luther concludes that as a\nresult, the matter must be settled by appeal to scripture alone, and\nnot by appeal to the authority of previous commentators, or of the\nChurch. Luther thus proceeds to the first main part of Erasmus\u2019s\ntext, in which Erasmus had offered a number of biblical passages that\nhe claimed to support the idea of free choice.\n\nAt the beginning of Part Three of his own work, before getting on to\nthese passages, Luther begins with an important critique of the\ndefinition of free choice with which Erasmus had started his\ndiscussion: \n\n\nBy free choice in this place we mean a power of the human will by\nwhich a man can apply himself to the things which lead to eternal\nsalvation, or turn away from them. (WA 18:661\u20132/LW\n33:102\u20133, citing Erasmus 1524 [1969: 47]) \n\n\nLuther raises various objections to Erasmus\u2019s definition (for Erasmus\u2019s replies, see 1529 [1999: 261\u201391]). First,\nhe points out that as free choice applies to God and angels, Erasmus\nis wrong to define it as applying only to human will. Second, he\nargues it is misleading to apply the term \u201cfree\u201d to human\nchoice, as this would wrongly imply that a human being \u201ccan do\nand does, in relation to God, whatever it pleases, uninhibited by any\nlaw or any sovereign authority\u201d, which Luther takes for granted\nis not what Erasmus has in mind. The human will clearly cannot simply\ndo as it pleases when it comes to matters of eternal salvation, as if\nit operated in a normative vacuum. Rather, the will is obliged by God\nto act in different ways, so it is only free insofar as it fails to do\nso because it is \u201cvertible\u201d or \u201cmutable\u201d, by\nfailing to do what is required of it by being turned away from the\ngood, which is hardly a form of freedom to be admired, as Augustine\nand others have noted. Thus, while Erasmus\u2019s attempted\ndefinition confuses matters, Luther argues that the question at issue\nis therefore whether human beings have the capacity to actively and\nlegitimately turn their will to follow or not follow what God has made\nit right to do\u2014so Luther says that when he uses \u201cfree\nchoice\u201d in what comes next, he will be using it in this way.\n\nLuther\u2019s third objection is that even when we get clear what we\nare trying to define, Erasmus\u2019s definition is itself unclear,\nparticularly the terms \u201cto apply\u201d, \u201cto the things\nwhich lead\u201d and \u201cto turn away\u201d. The only way to\nunderstand \u201cto apply\u201d and \u201cto turn away\u201d,\nLuther argues, is to think that the will is not merely a power that\ngives rise to action, but at the same time stands between that willing\nand action, as a capacity for deciding how the will is to be\nexercised, as a \n\n\ncapacity or faculty or ability or aptitude for willing, unwilling,\nselecting, neglecting, approving, rejecting, and whatever other\nactions of the will there are. (WA 18:662\u20133/LW 33:105) \n\n\nHowever, this then means, Luther argues, that on Erasmus\u2019s\naccount, if a human being does \u201cthe things which lead\u201d to\neternal salvation, this is not just because they have willed these\nthings, but rather have chosen to act on them through exercising this\ncapacity for choice\u2014which is enough to make him a semi-Pelagian,\nwho believes in this capacity for choice even though he disagrees with\nPelagius himself over our ability to also know unaided the matters of\nsalvation and thus the good concerning which we are said to choose.\nMoreover, Luther argues, this view contradicts what Erasmus himself\nhad said previously, namely that \u201cin those who lack grace\u201d\nthe power of the will is \u201cunable to perform the good\u201d\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 49]) and is thus (as Luther puts it)\n\u201cincapacitated without grace\u201d (WA 18:665/LW 33:108), and\nso not able to \u201capply itself\u201d to such matters at all.\nLuther thus poses a question to Erasmus which he thinks could also be\nposed to the Scholastics (who are labelled as Sophists throughout this\ntext): \n\n\nIf anyone told you that a thing was free which could operate by its\nown power only in one direction (the bad one), while in the other (the\ngood one) it could of course operate, though not by its own power, but\nonly by the help of another\u2014would you be able to keep a straight\nface my friend? (WA 18:665/LW 33:109)\n\n\nLuther then turns to consider Erasmus\u2019s treatment of the effect\nof the Fall on the human will, in which Erasmus had distinguished\nthree views on where this left free choice once the Pelagian option is set aside: those that hold human\nbeings can choose to strive towards the good but cannot attain it\nwithout grace (co-operative grace); those who hold that left to\nourselves we only choose to sin, so that grace alone can enable us to\nattain the good; and those who hold there is no free choice at all,\nwhich is thus said to be \u201can empty\u201d name\u2014where\nErasmus calls this view \u201cthe hardest of all\u201d, and is of\ncourse the one put forward by Luther himself (as well as John Wyclif in his early work, who Erasmus associated with\nLuther, an association the latter was happy to \n accept).[29]\n Luther\u2019s\nstrategy in response is to argue that by conceding that human beings\nwithout grace cannot will the good, Erasmus has already ruled out the\nfirst option even though he is clearly attracted by it, while Luther\nargues that the second must collapse into the third, as if free choice\nin humans is always for sin, it always goes in one direction and so is\nnot really choice at all. Luther also makes a diagnostic point, that\nunderlying Erasmus\u2019s confusion here is the idea that while the\nwill cannot will the good unaided, it is not necessarily therefore\ncommitted to willing the bad but still has some choice, as it could\nremain in a \u201cneutral\u201d position between the two; but Luther\nrejects this picture, as once the will has turned away from the good,\nit is willing the bad, rather than being in some \u201cmiddle\u201d\nor \u201cunqualified\u201d state.\n\nLuther then returns to the passage from Ecclesiasticus 15:14\u201317\nwith which Erasmus had prefaced his discussion, to consider how\nErasmus uses it to support his view. Luther first considers the\nopening line, which says that \u201cGod\u2026 left [man] in the\nhands of his own counsel\u201d, which might suggest that we are left\nfree to choose; but Luther counters that this only means we are given\ndominion over the rest of the creatures on earth, while beyond this we\nremain bound by the commandments of God which are referred to in the\nnext line of the biblical text. However, Luther then considers one of\nErasmus\u2019s key arguments, namely that talk of such commandments\nhere and in many other passages also implies we have free choice, for\notherwise they would make no sense, and nor would the punishment\nattached to failing to act on them be warranted, thus raising the\nproblem for Luther of \u201cought implies can\u201d, and of\nimputation (cf. Erasmus 1524 [1969: 50]).\n\nIn response to the first issue of \u201cought implies can\u201d,\nLuther uses this as an occasion to bring out the folly of reason when\nit considers such matters, because reason thinks it can appeal to our\nordinary use of words like \u201cought\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d\nto infer \u201ccan\u201d\u2014but Luther thinks that in fact even\nin ordinary practice, we can intelligibly tell someone they ought or\nmust do something, knowing full well they cannot, as when a parent\ndoes so in order to demonstrate to a child the limitations of their\nability, or a doctor in order to demonstrate such limitations to their\npatient. Luther argues that Scripture, unlike Erasmus, takes our human\nlimitations very seriously, so it is therefore not surprising that\nsuch uses of command language abound, where Luther deals with many\nsimilar passages in the same way: \n\n\nThe words of the law are spoken, therefore, not to affirm the power of\nthe will, but to enlighten blind reason and make it see that its own\nlight is no light and that the virtue of the will is no virtue, \n\n\nand he cites Paul as being on his side: \n\n\n\u201cThrough the law\u201d, says Paul, \u201ccomes knowledge of\nsin\u201d [Romans 3:20]; he does not say the \u201cabolition\u201d\nor \u201cavoidance\u201d of sin. (WA 18:677/LW 33:127) \n\n\nIn response to Erasmus on this issue, Luther thus offers what has been\ncalled his \u201cconvicting\u201d view of the law, which is designed\nto reveal our impotence to us, thus provoking the kind of despair and\nsense of helplessness that can open us up to grace, in accordance with\nthe \u201ctheology of the cross\u201d\u2014a process Erasmus would\nforestall if we took him seriously, and inferred instead that because\nwe fall under the law, we can take steps to follow it through our own\nchoice (cf. WA 18:680\u20131/LW 33:133).\n\nLuther also deals with the problem of imputation and divine\npunishment, which seems to arise if we lack free choice: for how can\nour sins be imputed to us, and how can God allow us to be punished\nwhen we cannot do otherwise and he could remove the defect in our will\nwhich means we are not saved but are punished? Here Luther appeals to\nthe inscrutability of God\u2019s plans and purposes, into which we\nare not entitled to probe: \n\n\n[W]hy that majesty of his does not remove or change this defect of our\nwill in all men, since it is not in man\u2019s power to do so, or why\nhe imputes this defect to man, when man cannot help having it, we have\nno right to inquire; and though you may do a lot of inquiring, you\nwill never find out. It is as Paul says in Romans 11 [sic; the\ncorrect reference is 9:20]: \u201cWho are you, to answer back to\nGod?\u201d (WA 18:686/LW 33:140) \n\n\nLikewise, Luther goes on to argue that when it comes to rewards, these\nare similarly unearned, where to think otherwise will only lead to a\nkind of works righteousness.\n\nFinally, in the concluding discussion of this third part of his text,\nLuther repeats a claim he has made at several previous points: namely,\nthat if Erasmus\u2019s arguments prove anything, they prove too much,\nby establishing the full-blown Pelagianism Erasmus thinks he can\navoid. For, if the arguments from \u201cought implies can\u201d and\nfrom imputation are taken seriously at all, then they would establish\nthat we are not merely free to the limited degree Erasmus claims, but\nare fully free to do the good, so that \u201cif anything is proved,\ncomplete freedom of choice is proved with it\u201d\u2014but this is\n\u201ca complete subversion\u201d of what Erasmus wanted to show, as\nhe tried instead to argue for the more moderate view that \u201csuch\na free choice can do nothing good and is in bondage to sin\u201d (WA\n18:696/LW 33:156). Luther claims, therefore, that Erasmus\u2019s\nposition undermines itself.\n\nIn the fourth part, Luther now considers Erasmus\u2019s arguments\nchallenging those scriptural passages which seem to count against free\nchoice, such as Exodus 9:12: \u201cThe Lord hardened the heart of\nPharaoh\u201d. Luther criticises not only Erasmus\u2019s various\ninterpretative suggestions, but also his motives in offering them,\nwhich is to try to make God\u2019s actions morally comprehensible to\nour reason, rather than simply accepting the goodness of God (WA\n18:707\u20138/LW 33:173\u20134). He goes on to suggest that for our\nreason to ask for more than this, and to insist that God is\nconstrained by certain moral norms, is to violate God\u2019s\nomnipotence, thus leading Luther to take clear sides on the so-called\nEuthyphro dilemma, in adopting a form of voluntarism that may be\ntraced back to Duns Scotus and to Ockham: \n\n\nHe is God, and for his will there is no cause or reason that can be\nlaid down as a rule or measure for it, since there is nothing equal or\nsuperior to it, but it is itself the rule of all things. For if there\nwere any rule or standard for it, either as cause or reason, it could\nno longer be the will of God. For it is not because he is or was\nobliged so to will that what he wills is right, but on the contrary,\nbecause he himself so wills, therefore what happens must be right.\nCause and reason can be assigned for a creature\u2019s will, but not\nfor the will of the Creator, unless you set up over him another\ncreator. (WA 18:712/LW 33:181)\n\n\nLuther then follows Erasmus\u2019s discussion, in turning from this\ntext to Paul\u2019s discussion of it in Romans 9:15\u201318, which\nraises the issue of divine foreknowledge, and how that relates to free\nchoice in human beings. In considering this issue, Erasmus had made\nuse of the scholastic distinction between the necessity of the\nconsequence and the necessity of the consequent, arguing that while it\nmay be that if God wills something it happens necessarily (necessity\nof the consequence), it does not follow that this happening is\nnecessary (necessity of the consequent), thus leaving space for free\nchoice (Erasmus 1524 [1969: 66\u20138]). In response, Luther argues\nthat divine foreknowledge makes this distinction moot: for if we allow\nthis foreknowledge, then what God knows must happen necessarily\notherwise he could not know it infallibly in advance; and if God did\nnot have this knowledge, \n\n\nyou take away faith and fear of God, make havoc of all the divine\npromises and threatenings, and thus deny his very divinity. (WA\n18:715/LW 33:186) \n\n\nLuther thus rejects Erasmus\u2019s attempt to leave any space for\nfree choice, given divine foreknowledge (for Erasmus\u2019s response, see Erasmus 1527 [1999: 493\u2013520]): \n\n\nIf God foreknows that Judas will turn traitor, or that he will change\nhis will to betray, whichever God has foreknown will necessarily come\nabout, or else God will be mistaken in his foreknowing and predicting,\nwhich is impossible. (WA 18:722/LW 33:194\u20135)\n\n\nAfter the discussion of some other relevant scriptural passages,\nLuther returns to consider Erasmus\u2019s motives in resisting what\nLuther takes to be the plain meaning of these texts in his conclusion\nof this fourth part\u2014which is that Erasmus wishes to constrain\nGod within the bounds of what is comprehensible to human reason, and\nso refuses to let God be God. In response, Luther writes:\n\n\nHuman nature [caro] does not think fit to give God such glory\nas to believe him just and good when he speaks and acts above and\nbeyond what the Code of Justinian has laid down, or the fifth book of\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics. The Majesty that is the creator of\nall must bow down to one of the dregs of his creation, and the famed\nCorycian cavern must reverse its role and stand in awe of the\nspectators!\u2026 [W]hat becomes of the potter\u2019s power to make\nwhat he likes, if he is subjected to merits and laws and not allowed\nto make what he likes, but required to make what he ought? (WA\n18:729\u201330/LW 33:206\u20137)\n\n\nFurthermore, Luther argues, if we did try to hold God to human norms\nof justice, we should be as critical of divine grace and forgiveness,\nwhich also violates these norms\u2014or if it does not, and God\nrewards only those who deserve it, then in the case of someone who\nreceives this reward in full, their goodness must be wholly due to\ntheir will, thus denying a role for grace at all (WA 33:733/LW\n33:211). Luther argues once again, therefore, that Erasmus\u2019s\nargument overshoots and so undermines itself.\n\nIn the fifth part of his text, Luther moves on to discussing\nErasmus\u2019s arguments over the scriptural passages which Luther\nhad used to challenge free choice in his Assertio. In\nresponse and in defending his own interpretation of those passages,\nLuther makes a number of similar points to those used in previous\nparts, such as: Erasmus ignores the convicting sense of the law (WA\n18:736/LW 33:216); he confuses lack of free choice with coercion (WA\n18:747/LW 33:233); he treats free choice as if it could occupy\nnormatively neutral ground (WA 18:750/LW 33:237); and his argument\novershoots, so that if followed consistently it results in Pelagianism\n(WA 18:755/LW 33:245). Likewise, in the sixth part, when offering\nfurther passages against free choice, Luther again reiterates his\nearlier arguments, particularly that works in accordance with the law\ndo not justify (WA 18:764/LW 33:258); that the role of the law is to\nbring knowledge of sin (WA 18:766/LW 33:261); that Erasmus\u2019s\nposition is an unstable form of semi-Pelagianism (WA\n18:769\u201370/LW 33:267\u20138); that divine foreknowledge and\npredestination leave no room for free choice (WA 18:772\u20133/LW\n33:272); that free choice is not in a neutral space between good and\nevil (WA 18:779/LW 33:281\u20132); and that our dominion over\ncreation does not entail that we have free choice in relation to God\n(WA 18:281/LW 33:284\u20135). In the concluding pages, Luther makes\nvividly clear the underlying spiritual concerns which motivate his\nposition: namely that for salvation to be dependent on the properly\nused free choice of the believer is to leave the believer in the sort\nof uncertainty regarding salvation which had plagued Luther\u2019s\nown earlier spiritual life, and which he was now thankful to have\nescaped, once he saw that \u201cGod has taken my salvation out of my\nhands into his, making it dependent on his choice and not mine\u201d\n(WA 18:783/LW 33:289). Moreover, he adds the Christological argument:\nif human beings had the capacity to save themselves through their\nchoices, Christ would have died in vain.\n",
