    "main_text": "Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy || Confucianism\n3.2 Confucianism\n\nThe impulse to philosophize in an organized fashion came to Japan in\nwaves from continental Asia: China, Korea, and indirectly India.\nPreviously illiterate, in the fifth century or so the Japanese started\ndeveloping a writing system, using at first the Chinese language for\nits base. Because Japanese and Chinese are linguistically unrelated\nand differ both syntactically and phonetically, it took centuries for\na Japanese writing system to evolve out of the Chinese sinographs, in\nthe meantime making Chinese the de facto written language. As\nsuch, Chinese philosophical works served as textbooks for\nJapan\u2019s study centers, eventually transforming the culture\nbeyond the parameters envisioned by the proto-Shint\u014d world view\nand forms of life.\n\nOf the three classical \u201cWays\u201d of traditional Chinese\nphilosophy, namely, Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, only the\nlatter two achieved independent prominence in Japan. Daoism\ncontributed to the proto-Shint\u014d base a more sophisticated\nunderstanding of the processes of natural change and a conceptual\nvocabulary for creative, responsive engagement with reality through\nagenda-less activity (what the Chinese Daoists called wuwei).\nFor the most part, however, its influence was most obvious in the\nalchemical arts, prognostication, and as a resource for occasional\nliterary references. Admittedly, in the medieval period some Daoist\nphilosophical references appear in the language of the arts,\nespecially in theories of creativity, but they occur mainly within a\nZen Buddhist context. That is likely because before coming to Japan,\nChinese Zen (Chan) had already assimilated many Daoist ideas. In\ncontrast with Daoism, however, Confucianism and Buddhism maintained a\npresence throughout Japanese history as independent philosophical\ncurrents of philosophy. Of the two, we consider Confucianism first.\n(See also the entry on \n Japanese Confucian Philosophy.)\n\n\nAs the second fountainhead of Japanese philosophy, Confucianism\nentered the country as a literary tradition from China and Korea\nbeginning around the sixth and seventh centuries. By then it already\nenjoyed a sophisticated continental philosophical heritage well over a\nmillennium old. Confucian philosophy in Japan underwent only minor\nchanges until its second wave in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\nafter which it experienced major transformations as it became\nJapan\u2019s dominant philosophical movement until the radical\nchanges brought by the modern period. With the Meiji Restoration of\n1868, that is, with the overthrow of the shogunate and the return of\nimperial rule, Confucianism receded somewhat in its philosophical\ndominance, yielding to the rise of Western academic philosophy, State\nShint\u014d ideology, and the secularized version of\nbushid\u014d (Way of the warrior) as promulgated in the\neducational program of National Morality. That is not to say, however,\nthat Confucianism did not continue to remain influential in its\nemphasis on scholarship, the definition of hierarchical social roles,\nand general models of virtue.\n\nThe Confucian Social and Moral Order\n\nFrom the time of their introduction into Japan, Confucian political,\nsocial, and ethical ideals quickly transformed the structure of\nJapanese society. From the seventh century, texts traditionally\nassociated with Confucianism served as the core curriculum in the\nimperial academy for the education of courtiers and bureaucratic\nofficials. Politically, Confucian ideology gave a sophisticated\njustification for an imperial state. Like proto-Shint\u014d, it\nrecognized the charisma of the political ruler as both a chief ritual\npriest and mediator with the celestial realm as well as the pinnacle\nof political authority. But Confucianism added to the Japanese context\na rich description of political and social roles that organized the\nsociety into a harmonious network of interdependent offices and\ngroups. Confucianism defined a place for each person and a set of\nshifting roles and contexts to be performed with ritual decorum.\n\nSo the proto-Shint\u014d taboo structure was enhanced with a Confucian\nset of socially appropriate behaviors. Once again, it was not a matter\nof moral mandates about good vs. evil, however, but a description of\nrole-based behaviors describing rightness as contrasted with\ninappropriateness or impropriety. Those dimensions of Confucianism\ncould be assimilated into the proto-Shint\u014d world view as useful\nelaborations and improvements, especially ones that would enable the\ngrowth of a Japanese state that expanded beyond family and regional\nclan regimes to become a central imperial state spanning the\narchipelago. Furthermore, as it became aware of the high cultural\nachievements of its Korean and Chinese neighbors, Japan could use\nConfucianism to participate in the East Asian cultural sphere defined\nby China and the prestige accompanying that membership.\n\nOne striking exception to the adoption of the standard Confucian\npolitical philosophy was that the Japanese ignored the principle of\nthe mandate of heaven (tianming in Chinese) that was central\nto the Chinese Confucian ideology of the state. In China the authority\nof the emperor flowed from a celestial entitlement or command, a\nmandate that could be withdrawn if the emperor no longer acted in\naccord with the Way (dao) or cosmic pattern\n(tianli). By contrast, following their proto-Shint\u014d\nsensitivities, the Japanese understood imperial authority to derive\nprimarily from the field that included the internal relations among\nheaven and earth or the deities and the people, with the\nemperor\u2019s being considered a direct descendant of the celestial\nsun kami, Amaterasu. Indeed, proto-Shint\u014d considered the\nrelation between the celestial kami, the emperor, and the\npeople to be familial and in no way either contractual or\ntranscendent. Like a blood connection, all Japanese and the\nkami were, through the emperor, internally related with each\nother such that the connections among them could not be nullified.\n\nNot having a philosophical tradition of its own, proto-Shint\u014d did\nnot so much argue against or refute the Chinese idea of the mandate of\nheaven; it simply ignored it, however fundamental it was to Confucian\npolitical theory. It is significant that no major Confucian thinker,\nnot even in the most ascendant period of Confucian philosophy under\nthe Tokugawa shogunate, vigorously argued that the mandate of heaven\nshould supersede the Shint\u014d justification for imperial rule based\nin the function of the emperor as holographically reflecting the\nontological, inherent connection among the kami, the Japanese\npeople, and the physical land of Japan.\n\nFor the most part, Confucianism brought to proto-Shint\u014d a new set\nof detailed ideas about how to organize a harmonious hierarchical\nsociety in which roles of respect directed to those above were\nreciprocated by roles of caring directed to those below. The analysis\nwas that society can be construed as constructed out of five binary\nrelations: ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, senior-junior,\nand friend-friend. If those five relations are lived with ritualized\npropriety and an attention to being appropriate to the roles they name\n(a praxis called in Japanese seimei \u201ctrueing up the\nterms\u201d or \u201cthe rectification of names\u201d), harmony\nwill prevail not only in those relations but in the whole society\nconstructed out of those relations. An implication of the Confucian\nview of role-based ideals is that the sharp separation between the\ndescriptive and the prescriptive collapses. There is theoretically no\ngap between knowing what a parent (or a ruler, or a husband \u2026)\nis and the role that person should perform. Thus,\nConfucianism can be understood as a type of ethico-political\nutopianism, but it is emphatically insistent that it is based neither\nin speculation nor rationalistic theory, but in historical paradigm.\nThe prototype is found in the harmonious society depicted in the\nancient Chinese classics: the histories, the odes, and the rites that\ninspired Confucius\u2019s insights. It follows that the Way to become\nethically and politically accomplished is to study the classics and to\nmodel oneself after the ancient paradigms of the roles exemplified by\nthe sages of the past.\n",
