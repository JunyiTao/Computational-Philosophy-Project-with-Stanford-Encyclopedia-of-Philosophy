    "main_text": "Early Experimental Tests of Bell\u2019s Inequalities\n4. Early Experimental Tests of Bell\u2019s Inequalities\n\nA first proposal to test Bell inequality was made by Clauser, Horne,\nShimony, and Holt (1969), henceforth CHSH, who suggested that the\npairs 1 and 2 be photons produced in an atomic cascade from an initial\natomic state with total angular momentum \\(J = 0\\) to an\nintermediate atomic state with \\(J = 1\\) to a final atomic state\n\\(J = 0\\), as in an experiment performed with calcium vapor for\nother purposes by Kocher and Commins (1967). The proposed test was\nfirst performed by Freedman and Clauser (1972). The result obtained by\nFreedman and Clauser was 6.5 standard deviations from the limit\nallowed by the CHSH inequality but in good agreement with the quantum\nmechanical prediction. This was a difficult experiment, requiring 200\nhours of running time, much longer than in most later tests of\nBell\u2019s Inequality, which were able to use lasers for exciting\nthe sources of photon pairs. \n\nSince then, several dozen experiments have been performed to test\nBell\u2019s Inequalities. References will now be given to some of the\nmost noteworthy of these, along with references to survey articles\nwhich provide information about others. A discussion of more recent\nexperiments addressed to close two serious loopholes in the early Bell\nexperiments, the \u201cdetection loophole\u201d and the\n\u201ccommunication loophole\u201d, will be reserved for\n Section 5.\n\nHolt and Pipkin completed in 1973 (Holt 1973) an experiment very much\nlike that of Freedman and Clauser, but examining photon pairs produced\nin the \\(9^1 P_1 \\rightarrow 7^3 S_1\\rightarrow 6^3 P_0\\) cascade in the zero nuclear-spin isotope of mercury-198 after\nusing electron bombardment to pump the atoms to the first state in\nthis cascade. The result of Holt and Pipkin was in fairly good\nagreement with the CHSH Inequality, and in disagreement with the\nquantum mechanical prediction by nearly 4 standard\ndeviations\u2014contrary to the results of Freedman and Clauser.\nBecause of the discrepancy between these two early experiments, Clauser\n(1976) repeated the Holt-Pipkin experiment, using the same cascade and\nexcitation method but a different spin-0 isotope of mercury, and his\nresults agreed well with the quantum mechanical predictions but\nviolated Bell\u2019s Inequality. Clauser also suggested a possible\nexplanation for the anomalous result of Holt-Pipkin: that the glass of\nthe Pyrex bulb containing the mercury vapor was under stress and hence\nwas optically active, thereby giving rise to erroneous determinations\nof the polarizations of the cascade photons.\n\nFry and Thompson (1976) also performed a variant of the Holt-Pipkin\nexperiment, using a different isotope of mercury and a different\ncascade and exciting the atoms by radiation from a narrow-bandwidth\ntunable dye laser. Their results also agreed well with the quantum\nmechanical predictions and disagreed sharply with Bell\u2019s\nInequality. They gathered data in only 80 minutes, as a result of the\nhigh excitation rate achieved by the laser.\n\nFour experiments in the 1970s \u2014 by Kasday-Ullman-Wu,\nFaraci-Gutkowski-Notarigo-Pennisi, Wilson-Lowe-Butt, and\nBruno-d\u2019Agostino-Maroni \u2014 used photon pairs produced in\npositronium annihilation instead of cascade photons. Of these, all but\nthat of Faraci et al. gave results in good agreement with the\nquantum mechanical predictions and in disagreement with Bell\u2019s\nInequalities. A discussion of these experiments is given in the review\narticle by Clauser and Shimony (1978), who regard them as less\nconvincing than those using cascade photons, because they rely upon\nstronger auxiliary assumptions.\n\nThe first experiment using polarization analyzers with two exit\nchannels, thus realizing the theoretical scheme envisaged in\n Section 2,\n was performed in the early 1980s with cascade photons from\nlaser-excited calcium atoms by Aspect, Grangier, and Roger (1982). The\noutcome confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics over those\nsatisfying the Bell inequalities more dramatically than any of its\npredecessors, with the experimental result deviating from the upper\nlimit in a Bell\u2019s Inequality by 40 standard deviations. An\nexperiment soon afterwards by Aspect, Dalibard, and Roger (1982),\nwhich aimed at closing the communication loophole, will be discussed\nin\n Section 5.\n The historical article by Aspect (1992) reviews these experiments and\nalso surveys experiments performed by Shih and Alley, by Ou and\nMandel, by Rarity and Tapster, and by others, using photon pairs with\ncorrelated linear momenta produced by down-conversion in non-linear\ncrystals. Discussion of more recent Bell tests can be found in review papers\n(Zeilinger 1999, Genovese 2005, 2016).\n\nPairs of photons have been the most common physical systems in Bell\ntests because they are relatively easy to produce and analyze, but\nthere have been experiments using other systems. Lamehi-Rachti and\nMittig (1976) measured spin correlations in proton pairs prepared by\nlow-energy scattering. Their results agreed well with the quantum\nmechanical prediction and violated Bell\u2019s Inequality, but, as in the positronium experiments, strong\nauxiliary assumptions had to be made. \n\nThe outcomes of the Bell tests provide dramatic confirmations of the\nprima facie entanglement of many quantum states of systems\nconsisting of 2 or more constituents. Actually, the first confirmation\nof entanglement antedated Bell\u2019s work, since Bohm and Aharonov\n(1957) demonstrated that the results of Wu and Shaknov (1950), Compton\nscattering of the photon pairs produced in positronium annihilation,\nalready showed the entanglement of the photon pairs.\n",
