    "main_text": "Independent Notions of Luck\n5. Independent Notions of Luck\n\nSome accounts of luck are neither thin accounts of luck nor aim at\ncapturing a general moral notion such as responsibility or desert.\nInstead they appeal to an independent conception of luck. Lottery luck\nis arguably one example:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if Y, from\nthe perspective of X, is the outcome of a lottery.\n\n\nThe underlying idea here is that there is a sense in which the outcome\nof a (fair) lottery is a matter of luck for the person who\nparticipates in it whether or not he is responsible for it\u2014as\nsome accounts of responsibility imply and others do not. It can be\nmaintained that justice is concerned with this notion of luck\nindependently of how it relates to responsibility and desert. Thus an\negalitarian may think that it is bad if people are unequally well off\nas a result of differential lottery luck even if he has not made up\nhis mind whether people are responsible for differential lottery luck.\nHe might add that it would be illegitimate for the state to enforce\nequality in face of inequality resulting from a fair lottery to which\nall parties consented. Also, lotteries might be excellent means of\nmaking outcomes independent of the unjust biases of distributors\n(compare Stone 2007, 286\u2013287), even if outcomes might be unjust\ndespite the fact such biases played no role in their genesis.\n\nIn principle, one could also care about choice and control luck\nindependently of how these relate to thin luck, e.g., responsibility\nand desert. However, philosophers who think that justice is a matter\nof eliminating differential luck have studied choice and control\nmainly because they assume that the absence of choice and control\nnullifies responsibility or desert.\n",
