    "main_text": "The Method in Discourse II\n4. The Method in Discourse II\n\nIn Part II of Discourse on Method (1637), Descartes offers\nthe first and only published expos\u00e9 of his method. By\ncomparison to the method described in the Rules, the method described\nin Discourse II consists of only four rules:\n\n\nThe first was never to accept anything as true if I did not have\nevident knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid\nprecipitate conclusions and preconceptions, and to include nothing\nmore in my judgments than what presented itself to my mind so clearly\nand so distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it.\n\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties I examined into as many\nparts as possible and as may be required in order to resolve them\nbetter.\n\nThe third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by beginning\nwith the simplest and most easily known objects in order to ascend\nlittle by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most complex, and\nby supposing some order even among objects that have no natural order\nof precedence.\n\nAnd the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and reviews\nso comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing out (AT 6:\n18, CSM 1: 120).\n\n\nThese four rules are best understood as a highly condensed summary of\nthe method described in the Rules (see Gilson 1987: 196\u2013214; Beck 1952: 149; Clarke\n1982: 181; Garber 2001: 39; Newman 2019: 85). Descartes\u2019\nabridgment of the method in Discourse II reflects a shift\nvis-\u00e0-vis the idea of a \u201ctheory\u201d of method. As he\nfamously put it in a letter to Mersenne, the method consists more in\npractice than in theory (letter to Mersenne, 27 February 1637, AT 1:\n349, CSMK 3: 53), and to learn the method one should not only reflect\non the rules of the method, but also see how they function in\nsolutions to particular problems. No matter how detailed a theory of\nmethod may become, there is no way to prepare oneself for every\neventuality that may arise in the course of scientific inquiry, and\nthere is certainly no way to codify every rule necessary to the\nsolution of any and all problems. Every problem is different. By the\nlate 1630s, Descartes decided to reduce the number of rules and focus\non the application of the method rather than on the theory of the\nmethod. In\n Sections 6\u20139,\n I follow Descartes\u2019 advice and examine how he applies the\nmethod in solutions to particular problems in optics, meteorology,\ngeometry, and metaphysics. First, though, the role played by\nexperiment in Descartes\u2019 method needs to be discussed in more detail.\n",
