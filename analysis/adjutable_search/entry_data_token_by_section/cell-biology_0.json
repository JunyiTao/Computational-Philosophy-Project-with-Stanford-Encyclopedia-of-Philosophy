    "main_text": "What is Cell Biology?\n1. What is Cell Biology?\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that scientific disciplines are\nsharply-delineated and can be defined by their subject matter. In\nfact, however, they are dynamically changing, shaped in large part by\nscientists, their research tools, and academic and research\ninstitutions. This is clearly true in the case of cell biology.\nScientists began investigating cells in the seventeenth century after\nHooke and van Leeuwenhoek reported what they saw with newly invented\nmicroscopes. Hooke (1665) gave cells their name. But the cell did not\nbecome a focal unit for studying biological processes until Schleiden\n(1838) and Schwann (1839) advanced the cell theory according to which\ncells are the basic living units. The term cytology was\nwidely used for the studies that ensued, which focused mainly on\ndescribing cells as seen under the light microscope. Although Wilson\nused the phrase cellular biology in his introduction to\nCowdry\u2019s General Cytology (Cowdry 1924), and many of\nits contributors aspired to integrate disciplines studying cells, the\nterm cell biology was only introduced in the years\nimmediately after World War II. Those adopting the term cell\nbiology advocated complementing new higher-resolution images\ncreated with the electron microscope with results from biochemical,\nbiophysical, and molecular approaches to cells. This transition is\nexemplified in the naming of what would become the flagship journal in\nthe field. The working title used in discussions about founding a new\njournal was Journal of Cytology. By the time of the first\nissue in 1955, it was called the Journal of Biophysical and\nBiochemical Cytology, a title chosen to emphasize the integration\nof multiple approaches to the study of cells. In 1962 it was\nre-christened The Journal of Cell Biology, by which time the\nInternational Society for Cell Biology and the American Society for\nCell Biology had also been established and the term cell\nbiology had acquired general currency for an integrated approach\nto cells. (Bechtel 2006: chapter 7, examines the establishment and\nrenaming of the journal as well as the creation of the American\nSociety for Cell Biology.)\n\nThe introduction of new research techniques, especially cell\nfractionation and electron microscopy, figured centrally in the\nefforts to establish cell biology as a distinct discipline in the\npost-World War II period as they enabled constructing what Palade\n(1987) termed a bridge between morphological observations and\nbiochemistry. Cell fractionation employs the ultracentrifuge to\nseparate cell contents into fractions that contain the enzymes\nresponsible for distinct cell activities while electron microscopy\nenables these fractions to be linked to organelles identifiable in\ncells. Matlin (2018) describes how Claude employed centrifugation to\nidentify microsomes which exhibited high concentrations of RNA.\nPorter\u2019s (1953) complementary micrographs of these particles in\nfractions and tissue slices (Figure 1) linked microsomes to the\nintracellular structure he had named the endoplasmic\nreticulum. As Matlin describes, this cycling between cell\nfractionation to establish function and electron microscopy to\nlocalize it to a structure was pursued repeatedly in cell biology.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Micrographs of a fraction\ncontaining microsome and of a thin-sliced preparation from a cell\nshowing the endoplasmic reticulum (marked as er). From Porter\n(1953), plate 48.\n\n\nIn terms of content, however, the break between cytology and cell\nbiology was nowhere near as sharp as the founders of cell biology\nportrayed. Cowdry\u2019s General Cytology (1924) clearly had\nsimilar aspirations of linking studies of morphology and studies of\ncellular chemistry (see discussions by historians, philosophers, and\nbiologists of Cowdry\u2019s project in Matlin, Maienschein, &\nLaubichler 2018). But in terms of the institutions in which scientists\nconducted their research, the break was quite significant. With the\ncreation of professional societies using the name \u201ccell\nbiology\u201d, biologists began to self-identify as cell biologists.\nLaboratories and academic departments adopted the name cell\nbiology and funding agencies recognized cell biology as a\nsupported field of research.\n\nAlthough cell biologists actively courted biochemists and to some\ndegree biophysicists to join their new discipline, these efforts\nlargely failed. The most enduring connections were with molecular\nbiology, which was established as a new discipline in the same period\n(see the entry on\n molecular biology).\n While molecular biology began with a focus on bacterial phage\n(viruses that infect bacteria) and cell biology with eukaryotic cells\nfrom mammals and plants, by the 1970s each discipline had broadened\nits focus and soon many cell biologists were adopting a molecular\napproach to cell structure and function. (A continuing point of\ndifference between cell biology and molecular biology is that cell\nbiology placed high value on linking chemical and molecular processes\nto cell structure; see Matlin 2016). Academic departments began to\ninclude both cell and molecular in their names. In\nNovember 1989 the American Society for Cell Biology created a new\njournal, Cell Regulation, but with its third volume in\nJanuary 1992, the name was changed to Molecular Biology of the\nCell. Although there are textbooks that reference just cell\nbiology in their title, several of the most prominent textbooks\nfeature both cell and molecular. These include\nAlberts\u2019 Molecular Biology of the Cell (Alberts,\nJohnson, Lewis et al. 2015) , Cooper and Hausman\u2019s The Cell:\nA Molecular Approach (2007), and Iwasa and Marshall\u2019s\nKarp\u2019s Cell and Molecular Biology (2016). The first\nedition of Alberts\u2019 Molecular Biology of the Cell\n(Alberts, Bray, Lewis et al. 1983) was modeled in part on\nWatson\u2019s Molecular Biology of the Gene (1976) and\nincluded Watson as a co-editor. Alberts attributes the vision of\nintegrating cell and molecular biology to Watson (see interview with\nAlberts in the Oral History Collection at Cold Springs Harbor\nLaboratory linked in\n Other Internet Resources below)\n",
