Ethics and Politics\n\n\nIn the discussion of what he described in the Provincial\nLetters as the \u2018perniciously lax\u2019 morality of the\nJesuits, Pascal classifies many human actions \u2014 such as\nhomicide, in cases where is it not justifiable as self-defence\n\u2014 as obviously immoral, and as widely recognised as such. He\ncharacterizes these immoral actions variously as contrary to the\n\u2018natural light\u2019, to \u2018common sense\u2019 or the\n\u2018natural law.\u2019 As Ferreyrolles (1984) shows, there are\nnumerous references in Pascal to a \u2018law of\nnature\u2019. However, Pascal does not argue that this natural law\ncan be discovered by reason, or that it acquires its obligatory force\nfrom human convention or contracts. The Jansenist interpretation of\nthe human condition implied that human nature is corrupt, and\ntherefore that reason is now an unreliable moral guide.  \u201cThere\nare undoubtedly natural laws, but our fine corrupted reason has\ncorrupted everything\u201d (Fragment 56: II, 560). According to this\nview, God had provided reliable moral guidance to human beings in the\nprelapsarian state of nature, and some remnants of God's law continue\nto be reflected in Fallen nature. Natural law, therefore, is what\nremains of God's law in the state of concupiscence of human nature\nafter the Fall. There is thus no independent, philosophical account of\nmorality available in Pascal, apart from the law of God which is more\nor less dimly revealed.\n\n\nAccording to God's law, or those elements of it which survive\nin the widely held opinions of human beings all over the world, there\nare certain actions which are intrinsically evil or good. Our moral\nduties include not only the more familiar examples, such as the\nobligation to refrain from voluntary homicide; Pascal also quotes with\napproval from Cajetan that \u201cwe are obliged by justice to give\nalms from our surplus, to alleviate even the common necessities of the\npoor \u2026 those who are rich are merely stewards of their surplus,\nin order to give it to whoever they select from among those who are in\nneed\u201d (Letters: I, 714).\n\n\nHaving assumed that there are objective moral obligations, Pascal\ndirects his critique, both in the Provincial Letters and in\nhis contributions to the \u00c9crits des Cur\u00e9s de\nParis, to the claim, attributed to Jesuit casuists, that one can\nchange the moral character of actions by changing one's\nintention at the time of their performance. On this account, if an\nagent acts immorally while formally intending to act immorally,\nnothing can excuse the action in question. In all other cases,\nhowever, Pascal described Jesuit casuisty as teaching that it is\npossible to modify the moral character of an action by applying the\nmethod of \u201cdirecting the intention, which consists in selecting\nsomething that is permitted as the objective of one's actions\u201d\n(Letters: I, 649). This escape from moral responsibility\nrelies on the principle that \u201cit is the intention which\ndetermines the [moral] quality of an action\u201d (Letters:\nI, 679).\n\n\nThe claim that one could direct one's intention away from what is\notherwise a morally reprehensible action was consistent with the\ncasuists' defence of the doctrine of \u2018probabilism\u2019.  This\ndoctrine, to which Pascal also objected, meant that one may decide\nmoral issues according to any opinion which is said to be\n\u2018probable\u2019, even if it is much less probable than\nalternative opinions. \u2018Probable\u2019 in this context had\nlittle to do with calculations of probability, but was defined as\n\u201ceverything that is approved by well-known authors\u201d\n(Letters: I, 732). The limits of what was morally acceptable\nwere thus provided by examining the writings of approved authors and\nfinding the least demanding moral opinions available in the\nliterature. Pascal's satirical critique of Jesuit casuistry assumes,\nin contrast, that human actions have a moral character that is\nindependent of the private thoughts or intentions of the agent who\nperforms them, and that one cannot ameliorate them by\n\u2018intending\u2019 results that differ from the actual effects or\nconsequences that follow naturally from a given action. In that sense,\nPascal's critique is an early version of a modern objection to the\nso-called \u2018Principle of Double Effect.\u2019\n\n\nPascal's political theory was likewise dictated by his account\nof human concupiscence. According to Fragment 90 of the\nPens\u00e9es, \u201cconcupiscence and force are the\nsources of all our actions. Concupiscence causes voluntary actions,\nand force causes those that are involuntary\u201d (II, 570). Although\nthe state of nature before the Fall of Adam was capable of guiding\nhuman behaviour, human relations are now completely compromised by\nconcupiscence and by the exercise of power by one person over\nanother. One inevitable effect of this unwelcome subservience is that\nwe are coerced into obeying those who exercise political power over\nus, and this can be interpreted as punishment for our sinful\ncondition. This pessimistic interpretation of political power and its\na possible abuse coincided with that of Luther and\nCalvin. The Trois Discours sur la condition des grands\ndistinguishes between natural gifts or abilities, which vary from one\nindividual to another and may provide a basis for our esteem, and\nvariations in social status or political power, which result from\nhuman contingency and require only that we obey and salute those who\nhappen to be our superiors (II, 194\u20139). The natural equality of\nhuman beings that is implicit in this analysis, however, provides no\nbasis for any theory of justice which would justify opposition to an\nestablished civil society or government, no matter how tyrannical it\nmay be (Bove et al., 2007: pp. 295 ff). In fact, there is no\nindependent perspective available to corrupt human beings from which\none may query whether the laws of a country are just; they are just,\nby definition, simply because they are the laws. \u201cJustice is\nwhat is established; thus all our established laws will necessarily be\naccepted as just without being examined, because they are\nestablished\u201d (Fragment 545: II, 776). A more extreme expression\nof the same view, in the Pens\u00e9es, is that\n\u201cjustice, like finery, is dictated by fashion\u201d (Fragment\n57; II, 562).\n\n\nThis political conservatism, which was partly motivated by Pascal's\nexperience of wars and partly by his theory of corrupt human nature,\nis reflected in his claim that \u201cthe worst evil of all is civil\nwar\u201d (Fragment 87: II, 569). In the\nProvincial Letters, he directs readers to the moral teaching\nof the Gospels to guide them in political action. \u201cThe Church\n\u2026 has always taught her children not to render evil for evil\n\u2026 to obey magistrates and superiors, even those who are unjust,\nbecause we must always respect in them the power of God who has set\nthem over us\u201d (I, 744). This compulsory tolerance of the status\nquo, for the sake of the common good, did not preclude comparative\nassessments of the merits or otherwise of different political systems.\nHowever, even in such assessments, the criterion applied by Pascal\nremained narrowly and theologically focused on the extent to which\npolitical arrangements facilitated citizens in the performance of\ntheir primary duties to God.\n\n\nThe appropriate attitude of subjects or citizens to established\npolitical authorities that govern them was exemplified, acutely, in\nthe demand by the civil powers in Paris that even conscientiously\nobjecting Jansenists had to sign and obey the formulary which\ncondemned the five propositions allegedly found in Jansen's\nwork. Dissenters like Pascal were not required to assent, in\nconscience, to what they did not believe; but they were required to\nassent in their behaviour, and to obey their political and\necclesiastical superiors. Likewise, the subjects of Pascal's polity\nwere not required to esteem their political masters, nor to hold\nbeliefs about them as human beings which they did not believe were\ntrue. It was enough that they obey them, that they observe the laws in\ntheir behaviour, and that they offer them the public deference that\nwas appropriate to their status as God's representatives, worthy or\notherwise, on earth.\n",
