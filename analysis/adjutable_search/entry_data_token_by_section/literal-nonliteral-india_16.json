    "main_text": "Criticizing the Distinction || Spho\u1e6da Theory\n4.4 Spho\u1e6da Theory\nIn his Treatise on Sentences and Words, the grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari (ca. 450 CE) takes up the distinction between primary and secondary meaning in more detail than previous grammarians such as P\u0101\u1e47ini and Pata\u00f1jali. His work is difficult\u2014he is aware of, and engages with, Buddhist, Jaina, and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views of language, but not in a straightforward dialectical manner, as is the style of many other Indian thinkers. This causes controversy over his established views (for discussion of which see Cardona 1999). In terms of his position on the division between primary and secondary meaning, the interpretive debate centers on the implications of the spho\u1e6da-theory for the possibility of such a distinction.\nIn Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s work, the term spho\u1e6da, meaning \u201cburst,\u201d refers to the indivisible nature of the utterance\u2014it is a sound which carries meaning, and which cannot be subdivided into words or particular phonemes. (One might think here of Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations, e.g., 1953 [2001]: 191, and the idea of grasping meaning in a \u201cflash\u201d\u2014and indeed, this connection has been explored in Bhattacharyya 2002 and elsewhere.) On one prevailing understanding of spho\u1e6da, Bhart\u1e5bhari is committed to a kind of linguistic monism, which not only denies the divisibility of utterances into grammatical categories, but asserts the identity of speech and reality. Thus any apparent distinctions between categories\u2014letters, words, semantic powers\u2014are illusory. He uses common examples of illusion in Indian philosophy to underscore this point: from far away, a large tree may look like an elephant; at a glance, a rope may appear to be a snake. However, these are misperceptions, as are the putative semantic distinctions we make (Raja 1969).\nJan E.F. Houben, in his translation of the \u201cExposition on (Semantic) Relationship\u201d (Sambandhasamudde\u015ba) chapter of the Treatise, which treats figurative language extensively, argues that Bhart\u1e5bhari does distinguish between primary and secondary meaning, but on pragmatic grounds (Houben 1995). Houben thinks that Bhart\u1e5bhari is a linguistic perspectivist, in the sense that his concern is not to argue against any particular philosophical position, but to show the limits of formal analysis itself. On this view, when Bhart\u1e5bhari appeals to the analogy with perceptual illusion, it is merely to dismantle the commitment to a certain theory of reference: that which presupposes words refer to external reality. Recently, Tzohar has argued that Bhart\u1e5bhari holds a \u201cpan-figurative\u201d account, on which all words \u201cfiguratively signify\u201d (Tzohar 2018: 70). On this view, word reference does not require a relationship with external referents. In contrast, all language use is \u201cfigurative\u201d in the sense that it does not require correspondence. This interpretation incorporates but goes beyond Houben\u2019s perspectivism, drawing out implications for the limits of language in connecting with reality.\nOn the linguistic monism view, Bhart\u1e5bhari is anticipating later Advaita Ved\u0101nta monism, on which empirical reality is illusory and Brahman, without having any genuine properties, is the basis for this illusion. His linguistic analysis, however, need not rely on these metaphysical assumptions in order to underscore the centrality of the sentence for meaning. Saying that grammatical categories and stable word-meanings are constructed (kalpita) based on theoretical needs, is to observe the priority of ordinary use and the role of context for actual communication. The perspectivist interpretation emphasizes the epistemic elements in theory-construction, understanding the analogical argument from illusion as less concerned with error than the pragmatic grounds to our judgments.\n",
