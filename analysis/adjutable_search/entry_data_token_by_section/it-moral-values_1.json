The Moral Challenges of Information Technology\n\nThe move from one set of dominant information technologies to another\nis always morally contentious. Socrates lived during the long\ntransition from a largely oral tradition to a newer information\ntechnology consisting of writing down words and information and\ncollecting those writings into scrolls and books. Famously Socrates\nwas somewhat antagonistic to writing and scholars claim that he never\nwrote anything down himself. Ironically, we only know about\nSocrates\u2019 argument against writing because his student Plato\nignored his teacher and wrote them down in a dialogue called\n\u201cPhaedrus\u201d (Plato). Towards the end of this dialogue\nSocrates discusses with his friend Phaedrus the\n\u201c\u2026conditions which make it (writing) proper or\nimproper\u201d (section 274b\u2013479c). Socrates tells a fable of\nan Egyptian God he names Theuth who gives the gift of writing to a\nking named Thamus. Thamus is not pleased with the gift and\nreplies,\n\n\nIf men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they\nwill cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is\nwritten, calling things to remembrance no longer from within\nthemselves, but by means of external marks. (Phaedrus, section\n275a)\n\n\nSocrates, who was adept at quoting lines from poems and epics and\nplacing them into his conversations, fears that those who rely on\nwriting will never be able to truly understand and live by these\nwords. For Socrates there is something immoral or false about writing.\nBooks can provide information but they cannot, by themselves, give you\nthe wisdom you need to use or deeply understand that information.\nConversely, in an oral tradition you do not simply consult a library,\nyou are the library, a living manifestation of the information you\nknow by heart. For Socrates, reading a book is nowhere near as\ninsightful as talking with its author. Written words, \n\n\n\u2026seem to talk to you as though they were intelligent, but if\nyou ask them anything about what they say, from a desire to be\ninstructed, they go on telling you the same thing forever. (Phaedrus,\nsection 275d).\n\n\nHis criticism of writing at first glance may seem humorous but the\ntemptation to use recall and call it memory is getting more and more\nprevalent in modern information technologies. Why learn anything when\ninformation is just an Internet search away? In order to avoid\nSocrates\u2019 worry, information technologies should do more than just\nprovide access to information; they should also help foster wisdom and\nunderstanding as well.\n",
