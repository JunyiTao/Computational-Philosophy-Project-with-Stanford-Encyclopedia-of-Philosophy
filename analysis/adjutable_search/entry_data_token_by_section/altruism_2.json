    "main_text": "What is altruism? || Self-sacrifice, strong and weak altruism\n1.2 Self-sacrifice, strong and weak altruism\n\nConsider someone whose deliberations are always guided by this\nprinciple: \u201cI shall never do anything unless doing so is best\nfor me\u201d. Such an individual is refusing ever to sacrifice his\nwell-being even to the slightest degree. But in view of the\nterminological points just made, he could have altruistic motives for\nsome of what he does\u2014or even for much or all that he does! On\nany given occasion, he could have mixed motives: he is careful always\nto do what is best for himself, but that allows him also to be\nmotivated by the perception that what he does is also good for others.\n\n\nIt would be odd or misleading to say that such an individual is an\naltruistic person. Many people would criticize him for being\ninsufficiently altruistic. It is part of common sense morality that\none should be willing to compromise with other people\u2014to\ncooperate with others in ways that require one to accept what is less\ngood for oneself than some other alternative, so that others can have\ntheir fair share.\n\nThese reflections lead to a peculiar result: each act undertaken by\nsuch an individual could be altruistically motivated, and yet we are\nreluctant, and reasonably so, to say that he is an altruistic person.\nThe best way to accommodate both ideas, which seem to be in tension,\nwould be to make a distinction between two uses of the word\n\u201caltruism\u201d. An act is altruistic in the strong sense if is\nundertaken in spite of the perception that it involves some loss of\none\u2019s well-being. An act is altruistic in the weak sense if it\nis motivated, at least in part, by the fact that it benefits someone\nelse or the fact that it will not injure anyone else. The individual\ndescribed two paragraphs above is someone who never acts\naltruistically in the strong sense. That policy seems objectionable to\nmany people\u2014even though he may act altruistically in the weak\nsense on many occasions.\n",
