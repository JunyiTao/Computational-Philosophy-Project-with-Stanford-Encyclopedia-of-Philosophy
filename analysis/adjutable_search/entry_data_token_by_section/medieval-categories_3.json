    "main_text": "Thirteenth Century\n4. Thirteenth Century\n\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth-century, works of Aristotle and\nhis Islamic commentators previously unknown in the Latin West became\navailable. Among these were four works on logic\u2013Prior\nand Posterior Analytics, Topics, and Sophistical\nRefutations\u2013that became known as the new\nlogic (logica nova) (Zupko 2003, 45). Their study did not\ndisplace the study of the older ones (the old logic, or logica\nvetus), but rather helped to intensify and expand it, and resulted\nin an increase in both the number and the complexity\nof the commentaries written about Categories. In addition,\nworks on metaphysics and natural philosophy, such as Aristotle's\nMetaphysics and Physics, as well as commentaries by\nIslamic authors on them, circulated widely. These works introduced\na new context and terminology in the discussion of\ncategories.\n\n\nFor example, an important factor in the new discussions was the\nnotion of science articulated by Aristotle in Posterior\nAnalytics. Generally, it was thought that scientific knowledge\ninvolves three things: a definition, a list of the properties in the\ntechnical Aristotelian sense of features not contained in the\ndefinition but consequent upon it, and a causal analysis. Faced with\nthis notion, scholastics explicitly asked whether categories are the\nsubject of scientific knowledge, and if so, whether the scientific\nknowledge in question is what Aristotle regarded as a\nknowledge of fact (scientia quia) or a knowledge of reasoned\nfact (scientia propter quid). Eventually they asked whether\ncategories could be defined and the kind of definition they could have;\nwhether they have properties and, if so, what\nproperties they have; and whether a causal analysis of them is possible\nand in what such an analysis would consist. These questions led them to\nquestion the discipline in which categories are studied\u2013is it\ngrammar, logic, or metaphysics?\u2013and often forced them to modify\ntheir views of both science and the categories (Pini 2003,\n189\u201390).\n\n\nA second important factor, found in Islamic commentators, was the\nintroduction of a distinction between first and second intentions, and\nthe understanding that the first are studied in metaphysics and other\nsciences that deal with the extra-mental world, whereas the second are\nstudied in logic (Pini 2003). There was\nconsiderable disagreement as to what these\n\u201cintentions\u201d are, but Aquinas conceived the first as\nconcepts about things in the world (e.g., \u201ccat\u201d is a\nconcept about cats) and the second as concepts about other concepts\n(e.g., \u201cspecies\u201d is a concept about such other concepts as\ncat and human). This new terminology led thirteenth century authors to\nask what the concepts of category and of particular categories (e.g.,\nsubstance or quality) are (first or second\nintentions?), and how the notions of first and second intentions ought\nto be understood.\n\n\nA third factor, the isomorphism between language, thought, and reality\ninherited from ancient discussions of Aristotle's view, prompted\nscholastic attempts to establish (some scholars use\n\u2018derive\u2019 or even \u2018deduce\u2019) the exact number of\ncategories. Most popular among these was the effort to tie the\ncategories to different kinds of predication, but there were authors\nwho explored other possibilities, such as derivations based on the\nmodes of being.  Although there are early hints at an attempt based on\npredication in Simplicius' Commentary on Aristotle's\n\u201cCategories,\u201d it was not until the middle of the\nthirteenth century that commentators typically raised a separate\nquestion concerning the number of categories, an issue often referred\nto as sufficientia praedicamentorum. Albertus Magnus\n(ca. 1200\u20131280), Simon of Faversham (ca. 1260\u20131306), Peter\nof Auvergne (d. 1304), Radulphus Brito (ca. 1270\u20131320), and\nHenry of Ghent (ca. 1217\u201393), among others, attempted to\ndetermine the number of categories. The most famous and influential of\nthe authors who engaged in this exercise was Thomas Aquinas, who\nfollowed Albertus Magnus in trying to derive the categories from modes\nof predication. Simon of Faversham and Radulphus Brito, though,\nfollowed the tradition of deriving them from modes of being. Later\nthinkers, such as John Duns Scotus, doubted the possibility of such a\ndemonstration, and William of Ockham and John Buridan\n(ca. 1300\u20131361), among others, went even further, rejecting the\nview that there are ten categories of reality, let alone the\npossibility of demonstrating that there are ten categories.\n",
