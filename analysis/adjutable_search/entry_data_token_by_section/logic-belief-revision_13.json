One is that she has received new\ninformation about the world, the other that the world has changed. It\nis common to reserve the term \u201crevision\u201d for the first of\nthese types, and use the term \u201cupdating\u201d for the second.\nThe logic of updating differs from that of revision. This can be seen\nfrom the following example:\n\n\nTo begin with, the agent knows that there is either a book on the\ntable \\((p)\\) or a magazine on the table \\((q)\\), but not both.\n\nCase 1: The agent is told that there is a book on the table. She\nconcludes that there is no magazine on the table. This is\nrevision.\n\nCase 2: The agent is told that after the first information was given,\na book has been put on the table. In this case she should not conclude\nthat there is no magazine on the table. This is updating.\n\n\nOne useful approach to updating is to assign time indices to the\nsentences, as proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Then the\nbelief set will not consist of sentences \\(p\\) but of pairs \\(\\langle\np,t_1\\rangle\\) of a sentence \\(p\\) and a point in time \\(t_1\\),\nsignifying that \\(p\\) holds at \\(t_1\\). In the book-and-magazine\nexample, let \\(t_1\\) denote the point in time that the first statement\nrefers to, and \\(t_2\\) the moment when the second information was\ngiven in Case 2. The original belief set contained the pair \\(\\langle\n\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q),t_1\\rangle\\). (\\(\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\)\nis the exclusive disjunction of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).) Revision by \\(p\\)\ncan be represented by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_1\\rangle\\),\nand updating by \\(p\\) by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_2\\rangle\\)\ninto the belief set. It follows quite naturally that \\(\\langle \\neg\nq,t_1\\rangle\\) is implied by the revised belief set but not by the\nupdated belief set.\n",
