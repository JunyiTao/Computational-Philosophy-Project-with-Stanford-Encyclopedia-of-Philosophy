    "main_text": "Inequality and Poverty Measurement || Indices of Inequality and Poverty\n2.1 Indices of Inequality and Poverty\n\nThe study of inequality and poverty indices started from a\nstatistical, pragmatic perspective, with such indices as the Gini\nindex of inequality or the poverty head count. Recent research has\nprovided two valuable insights. First, it is possible to relate\ninequality indices to social welfare functions, so as to give\ninequality indices a more transparent ethical content. The idea is\nthat an inequality index should not simply measure dispersion in a\ndescriptive way, but would gain in relevance if it measured the harm\nto social welfare done by inequality. There is a simple method to\nderive an inequality index from a social welfare function, due to Kolm\n(1969) and popularized by Atkinson (1970) and Sen (1973). Consider a\nsocial welfare function which is defined on distributions of income\nand is symmetrical (i.e., permuting the income of two individuals\nleaves social welfare unchanged). For any given unequal distribution\nof income, one may compute the egalitarian distribution of income\nwhich would yield the same social welfare as the unequal distribution.\nThis is called the \u201cequally-distributed equivalent\u201d (or\n\u201cequal-equivalent\u201d) distribution. If the social welfare\nfunction is averse to inequality, the total amount of income in the\nequal-equivalent distribution is less than in the unequal\ndistribution. In other words, the social welfare function condones\nsome sacrifice of total income in order to reach equality. This drop\nin income, measured in proportion of the initial total income, may\nserve as a valuable index of inequality. This index may also be used\nin a picturesque decomposition of social welfare. Indeed, an ordinally\nequivalent measure of social welfare is then total income (or average\nincome \u2013 it does not matter when the population is fixed) times\none minus the inequality index.\n\nThis method of construction of an index of inequality, often referred\nto as the ethical approach to inequality measurement, is most\nuseful when the argument of the social welfare function, and the\nobject of the measurement of inequality, is the distribution of\nindividual well-being (which may or may not be measured by income).\nThen the social welfare function is indeed symmetrical (by requirement\nof impartiality) and its aversion to inequality reflects its\nunderlying ethical principles. In other contexts, the method is more\nproblematic. Consider the case when social welfare depends on\nindividual well-being, and individual well-being depends on income\nwith some individual variability due to differential needs. Then\nincome equality may no longer be a valuable goal, because the needy\nindividuals may need more income than others. Using this method to\nconstruct an index of inequality of well-being is fine, but\nusing it to construct an index of inequality of incomes would\nbe strange, although it would immediately reveal that income\ninequality is not always bad (when it compensates for unequal needs).\nNow consider the case when social welfare is the utilitarian sum of\nindividual utilities, and all individuals have the same strictly\nconcave utility function (strict concavity means that it displays a\ndecreasing marginal utility). Then using this method to construct an\nindex of income inequality is amenable to a different interpretation.\nThe index then does not reflect a principled aversion to inequality in\nthe social welfare function, since the social welfare function has no\naversion to inequality of utilities. It only reflects the consequence\nof an empirical fact, the degree of concavity of individual utility\nfunctions. To call this the ethical approach, in this context, seems a\nmisnomer.\n\nIn the field of multidimensional inequality or poverty measurement, a\nkey divide has separated the measures that evaluate the distribution\nin every dimension (such as income, health, asset deprivation...)\nbefore they aggregate over the dimensions, from the measures that\nfirst evaluate individual situations, all dimensions included, before\naggregating over individuals. The latter has been praised (Decancq and\nLugo 2013) for being closer to the standard individualistic approach\nin welfare economics, and for making it possible to have measures that\nare sensitive to the correlation between disadvantages (e.g., the\npositive correlation between income and health), and therefore more\naccurately record the multidimensional suffering of the worst off. An\ninteresting feature of such measures is that a positive correlation\namong attributes of advantage or disadvantage worsens inequalities\nonly if the elasticity of substitution between attributes, in the\nmeasure of individual multidimensional advantage, is greater than the\ninequality aversion in the social index. To illustrate, consider two\ncanonical distributions, with two individuals and two attributes:\n\n(Perfect correlation) Ann: (1,1) and Bob: (2,2)\n\n(Anti-correlation) Ann: (1,2) and Bob: (2,1)\n\nIf the attributes are deemed perfectly substitutable (meaning that\nonly the sum, potentially weighted, of the attributes matters for the\nassessment of individual advantage), and the inequality aversion is\nzero (meaning that only the sum of individual indexes of advantage\nmatters), the two distributions are considered equally good. But they\nalso appear equally good if there is no possible substitution (only\nthe value of the worst attribute matters) and inequality aversion is\ninfinite (only the worst-off individual matters). In contrast, the\nfirst distribution appears worse if the attributes are substitutable\nand inequality aversion is strong (the first distribution is then\nunequal, unlike the second one); whereas it appears better if there is\nno possible substitution and inequality aversion is weak (only one\nindividual has a bad attribute in the first distribution, whereas both\nhave one in the second).\n\nThe second valuable contribution of recent research in this field is\nthe development of an alternative ethical approach through the\naxiomatic study of the properties of indices. The main ethical axioms\ndeal with transfers. The Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers says that\ninequality decreases (or social welfare increases) when an even\ntransfer is made from a richer to a poorer individual without\nreversing their pairwise ranking (although this may alter their\nranking relative to other individuals). Since this condition is about\neven transfers, it is quite weak and other axioms have been proposed\nin order to strengthen the priority of the worst-off. The principle of\ndiminishing transfers (Kolm 1976) says that a Pigou-Dalton transfer\nhas a greater impact the lower it occurs in the distribution. The\nprinciple of proportional transfers (Fleurbaey and Michel 2001) says\nthat an inefficient transfer in which what the donor gives and what\nthe beneficiary receives is proportional to their initial positions\nincreases social welfare. Similar transfer axioms have been adapted to\nthe measurement of poverty. For instance, Sen (1976) proposed the\ncondition saying that poverty increases when an even transfer is made\nfrom someone who is below the poverty line to a richer individual\n(below or above the line). The other axioms with which the axiomatic\nanalysis has been made usually have a less obvious ethical appeal, and\nrelate to decomposability of indices, scale invariance and the like.\nCharacterization results have been obtained, which identify classes of\nindices satisfying particular lists of axioms. The two ethical\napproaches may be combined, when one takes as an axiom the condition\nthat the index be derived from a social welfare function with\nparticular features.\n",
