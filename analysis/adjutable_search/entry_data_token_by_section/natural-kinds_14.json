    "main_text": "The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms || Direct Reference and Externalism\n4.3 Direct Reference and Externalism\n\nThe conclusions of the arguments given above include not only the\nfalsity of descriptivism as a thesis about the reference of natural\nkind terms, but also the more general truth of semantic\nexternalism. The Earthling in 1750 and their Twin Earth\ncounterpart are supposed to be intrinsic physical duplicates. (There\nis a problem in that one would expect the twin to have XYZ in its\nblood stream, etc., not H2O, so the two are not perfect\nduplicates; but we can take it that this physical difference should\nnot affect the argument.) Although they are duplicates, the terms they\nuse have different extensions; likewise their thoughts have different\ntruth conditions. Consequently, the reference, extension, and truth\nconditions of a person\u2019s utterances do not supervene on their\nphysical state. These things are fixed, at least in part, by external\nconsiderations. We might retain a conception of the psychological such\nthat the psychological still supervenes on the physical; but then one\nwould have to deny that \u2018thinking about water\u2019\ncharacterizes a psychological state. Or, we must deny that the\npsychological state of a subject supervenes upon the physical state of\nthe subject.\n\nIf descriptions do not fix extensions, and some external factor fixes\nextensions, then by what process are extensions fixed? Kripke does not\nintend to propose a new theory of reference fixing, although the\noutlines of such a theory are fairly clearly implied by what he says.\nHis principal aim is to make the case for the Millian\ndenotation-without-connotation view of singular proper names, and then\nextend this (contrary to Mill\u2019s own opinion) to certain general\nterms also, including natural kind terms.\n\nThe Millian view may be called direct reference (Kaplan\n1977), since the reference of singular proper name is not mediated by\na connotation/sense/intension. The semantic value of such a name just\nis the individual to which it refers. Such terms are thus rigid\ndesignators\u2014they denote the same object with respect to all\npossible worlds (Kripke 1980, 48). How does this view extend to\nnatural kind terms? The answer is that the view does not transfer if\nwe take the analogue of the denotation of a singular term to be the\nextension of a kind term. This is because presumably the extension of\na kind term differs from world to world, since the individual members\nof a kind, such as individual tigers and lumps of gold, are generally\ncontingent entities.\n\nThe obvious route to an analogy between kind terms and singular direct\nreference is to focus not on natural kind predicates but on singular\nnatural kind terms (see first paragraph of Section 4 above). We should\nregard terms such as \u2018water\u2019, \u2018gold\u2019,\n\u2018Rattus rattus\u2019, etc. as denoting abstract\nindividuals and objects (or some other kinds of entity that may be the\nconstant recipient of reference across worlds). Thus the direct\nreference view applied to such terms says that the semantic value of\nthose terms just is those abstract individuals, and the claim that the\nterms are rigid designators is the claim that they denote the same\nabstract individual, the same natural kind, with respect to all\npossible worlds. Rigid designation is a consequence of direct\nreference (but not vice versa). (See Mart\u00ed 2003 for a\ndiscussion of the relationship between Millianism, direct reference,\nand rigid designation. See also Sullivan 2005.)\n\nTreating kinds as abstract individuals permits an analogue for natural\nkind terms to the natural story concerning the reference of singular\nproper names that emerges from Kripke\u2019s discussion. In the\nsimplest case, an individual receives a name in a naming ceremony, and\nthe use of that name is transferred from speaker to speaker,\npreserving its reference through each transfer. Thus the reference of\na later use is determined by tracing back the route of transmission to\nthe original naming ceremony. In the natural kind case, which is\nrather more of an idealization than the case of a concrete particular,\nthe original naming ceremony picks out a natural kind via an ostension\nof one of its samples. This is the so-called \u2018causal\u2019\ntheory of reference. Note that \u2018causal\u2019 refers to the\ncausal transmission of the use of the name. (Although an ostensive\nreference fixing will be causal, the link between the kind (or its\nsample) and the first use of the kind term could be secured by a\nreference-fixing description. In such as case the reference-fixing\ndescription does merely that; it does not supply a meaning (sense or\nintension).\n\nThus far Kripke\u2019s account of the semantics of natural kind terms\ntreats them very much on a par with proper names, suggesting that\nkinds are much like abstract individuals, being potential recipients\nof singular reference\u2014Millianism has been extended from proper\nnames of individuals to natural kind terms. (Mill\u2019s own view of\n\u2018general terms\u2019 was not Millian in this sense, but closer\nto a Fregean view.) Putnam gives a more elaborate account of the\nreference of natural kind terms, which apparently does not depend on\ntreating kinds as abstract individuals. According to Putnam, the\nextension of a natural kind term is fixed by ostending or otherwise\nidentifying a sample of the kind and appealing, explicitly or\nimplicitly, to a \u2018same kind relation\u2019. Thus the extension\nof \u2018water\u2019 includes all and only those things that bear\nthe same kind relation to some sample, which may be specified loosely,\nfor instance as \u2018the watery stuff around here\u2019 (where\n\u2018watery\u2019 is defined in terms of the manifest\ncharacteristics of water, not in terms of \u2018water\u2019). (Note\nthat Putnam says \u2018same liquid relation\u2019, but that would\nnot provide the extension of a natural kind term, since it would\nexclude the gaseous and solid phases of water.) Putnam (1975a) thereby\nextends the notion of rigid designation to general terms, since (a)\nthe same kind relation is a cross-world relation, and (b) it is\nanchored to a specific, actual world sample. Consequently all samples\nof water in all possible worlds will bear the same kind relation to\none another. That this excludes XYZ depends upon its being the case\nthat a sample that does not share the \u2018important physical\nproperties\u2019 of our sample cannot be of the same kind.\n\nThe view that natural kind terms are rigid designators has\nconsequences for identity statements involving natural kind terms\n(e.g., \u201cbrontosaurus is apatosaurus\u201d). The reason is that\nany identity statement relating two rigid designators is necessarily\ntrue. Hence identity statements involving natural kind terms express\nnecessary truths, even if knowable only a posteriori. Kripke\nregards theoretical identities such as \u2018water =\nH2O\u2019, where one of the terms is a description, as\ninstances of such a posteriori necessary identities. Such a\nclaim requires an argument to show that \u2018H2O\u2019\nis a rigid designator, since it is not a directly referring\nexpression. We may take \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018O\u2019 to\ndesignate hydrogen and oxygen rigidly. However, if the formula\n\u2018H2O\u2019 just means \u2018hydrogen and oxygen\ncompounded in the ratio 2:1\u2019 one might wonder whether, if the\nlaws of nature are contingent, there might be worlds where hydrogen\nand oxygen are compounded in that ratio in such a way that the\nresulting compound does not belong to the same kind as H2O,\nand is not water. If that is possible, then\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is not a rigid designator, and\n\u2018water = H2O\u2019 is not necessary. (As noted\nabove, Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought experiment does not establish\nthe identity of water and H2O\u2014all it establishes is\nthat being constituted of H2O is a necessary condition of\nbeing water. In which case it is consistent with some instances\n(actual and possible) of H2O not being water.) Most\ndiscussions accept that to count H2O as a substance it must\nbe compounded of hydrogen and oxygen in the way that they are actually\ncompounded. The rigid designation of simple, directly referring names\nand kind terms is often explained in terms of their having an\nindexical character. In ideal cases where the name is introduced via\nan ostension of its intended referent, the designation is literal. In\nother cases indexicality is less apparent, as we see in the case of\n\u2018water\u2019 where there is something like an implicit\nostension of \u2018watery stuff around here\u2019 (though\n\u2018water\u2019 could not mean \u2018watery stuff around\nhere\u2019, since then the referent of \u2018water\u2019 would then\nbe different in an XYZ environment). A similar implicit indexicality\nis found in the theoretical specification of kind terms, which\nexplains their rigid character also.\n\nThe Millian view applied to simple natural kind terms faces various\nproblems. One of these problems concerns empty terms.\n\u2018Phlogiston\u2019, \u2018caloric\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019,\n\u2018humour\u2019, are all natural kind terms that fail to refer to\nanything. Millianism implies that there is no semantic difference\nbetween these terms at all. Surely \u2018phlogiston does not\nexist\u2019 and \u2018caloric does not exist\u2019 mean different\nthings; Lavoisier asserted the first and denied the second with\napparent consistency. The most common response to this problem is a\nretreat from pure Millianism for such terms. Some descriptive\nelement is included in their semantics.\n\nThis need not be a full retreat to a Fregean view for two reasons. The\ndescriptive element may not suffice to pick out the kind (in the\nnon-empty cases)\u2014the implicit historical ostension of a sample\nmay be necessary to fix reference. And the description itself may have\nnon-Fregean features\u2014it may have an indexical component, for\nexample, a reference to the actual world, that a Fregean would deny.\nThe retreat from pure Millianism (and a partial vindication of\nMill\u2019s own view of general terms, which Kripke rejected) need\nnot undermine the claim that kind terms are rigid designators. Rigid\ndesignation does not require direct reference; complex theoretical\nexpressions, such as \u2018H2O\u2019, may, as we saw,\nalso be rigid designators.\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that rigid designation for kind and\nother general terms faces a serious objection: rigid designation for\nkind terms is trivial (Soames 2002; Schwartz 2002; Mart\u00ed 2004).\nRigid designation requires that the object designated by a rigid\ndesignator be the same in all worlds. That requirement rules out the\nextension of a kind term as its designation, since the same kind may\nhave different extensions in different worlds. On the other hand,\nregarding the extension as an abstract individual also faces\ndifficulties. One might take \u2018Mary\u2019s favourite\ncolour\u2019 to designate different colours in different worlds, and\nthus understood it is not a rigid designator. But we could take\n\u2018Mary\u2019s favourite colour\u2019 to designate (rigidly) an\nunusual abstract individual Mary\u2019s-favourite-colour,\nwhich has violet things as its extension in the actual world, but\nturquoise things in another possible world and so on. This thought\nexperiment suggests that it is always possible to regard a general\nterm as a rigid designator. One option for resisting this move is to\ndeny that in every case there is some entity for the term to refer to.\nThere is no thing abstract or concrete that is\nMary\u2019s-favourite-colour. Property terms may denote a\nnatural property, in Lewis\u2019s (1986) terms a sparse\nproperty or they do not denote at all. Similarly, natural kind terms\ndenote genuinely natural entities that are likewise sparse or they\nfail to denote.\n",
