    "main_text": "\n\nDeductivism says that a mathematical sentence \\(s\\) should be\nunderstood as expressing the claim that \\(s\\) deductively follows from\nappropriate axioms. For instance, deductivists might construe\n\u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d as \u201cthe sentence \u2018\\(2 + 2 =\n4\\)\u2019 deductively follows from the axioms of arithmetic\u201d.\nDeductivism promises a number of benefits. It captures the fairly\ncommon idea that mathematics is about \u201cwhat can be deduced from\nthe axioms\u201d; it avoids an ontology of abstract mathematical\nobjects; and it maintains that our access to mathematical truths\nrequires nothing beyond our ability to make logical deductions.\nSections 1 and 2 define and motivate deductivism in more detail.\nSection 3 covers four authors (Russell, Hilbert, Pasch, Curry) who\nhave endorsed deductivism at some point. Section 4 aims to clarify\nwhat semantic claim deductivists make. Sections 5\u20139 review\nobjections to deductivism and possible replies.\n",
