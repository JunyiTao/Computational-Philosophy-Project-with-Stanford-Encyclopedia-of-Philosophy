    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories || \u2018I-Language\u2019 and \u2018E-Language\u2019\n2.2 \u2018I-Language\u2019 and \u2018E-Language\u2019\n\nChomsky (1986) introduced into the linguistics literature two\ntechnical notions of a language: \u2018E-Language\u2019 and\n\u2018I-Language\u2019. He deprecates the former as either\nundeserving of study or as a fictional entity, and promotes the latter\nas the only scientifically respectable object of study for a serious\nlinguistics.\n2.2.1 \u2018E-language\u2019\n\nChomsky\u2019s notion \u2018E-language\u2019 is supposed to suggest\nby its initial \u2018E\u2019 both \u2018extensional\u2019\n(concerned with which sentences happen to satisfy a definition of a\nlanguage rather than with what the definition says) and\n\u2018external\u2019 (external to the mind, that is, non-mental).\nThe dismissal of E-language as an object of study is aimed at critics\nof Essentialism\u2014many but not all of those critics falling within\nour categories of Externalists and Emergentists.\n\nExtensional. First, there is an attempt to impugn the\nextensional notion of a language that is found in two radically\ndifferent strands of Externalist work. Some Externalist investigations\nare grounded in the details of attested utterances (as collected in\ncorpora), external to human minds. Others, with mathematical or\ncomputational interests, sometimes idealize languages as extensionally\ndefinable objects (typically infinite sets of strings) with a certain\nstructure, independently of whatever device might be employed to\ncharacterize them. A set of strings of words either is or is not\nregular (finite-state), either is or is not recursive (decidable),\netc., independently of forms of grammar statement. Chomsky (1986)\nbasically dismissed both corpus-based work and mathematical\nlinguistics simply on the grounds that they employ an extensional\nconception of language that is, a conception that removes the object\nof study from having an essential connection with the mental.\n\nExternal. Second, a distinct meaning based on\n\u2018external\u2019 was folded into the neologism\n\u2018E-language\u2019 to suggest criticism of any view that\nconceives of a natural language as a public, intersubjectively\naccessible system used by a community of people (often millions of\nthem spread across different countries). Here, the objection is that\nlanguages as thus conceived have no clear criteria of individuation in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions. On this conception, the\nsubject matter of interest is a historico-geographical entity that\nchanges as it is transmitted over generations, or over mountain\nranges. Famously, for example, there is a gradual valley-to-valley\nchange in the language spoken between southeastern France and\nnorthwestern Italy such that each valley\u2019s speakers can\nunderstand the next. But the far northwesterners clearly speak French\nand the far southeasterners clearly speak Italian. It is the\npolitically defined geographical border, not the intrinsic properties\nof the dialects, that would encourage viewing this continuum as two\ndifferent languages.\n\nPerhaps the most famous quotation by any linguist is standardly\nattributed to Max Weinreich (1945): \u2018A shprakh iz a dialekt mit\nan armey un flot\u2019 (\u2018A language is a dialect with an army\nand navy\u2019; he actually credits the remark to an unnamed\nstudent). The implication is that E-languages are defined in terms of\nnon-linguistic, non-essential properties. Essentialists object that a\nscientific linguistics cannot tolerate individuating French and\nItalian in a way that is subject to historical contingencies of wars\nand treaties (after all, the borders could have coincided with a\ndifferent hill or valley had some battle had a different outcome).\n\nConsiderations of intelligibility fare no better. Mutual\nintelligibility between languages is not a transitive relation, and\nsometimes the intelligibility relation is not even symmetric (smaller,\nmore isolated, or less prestigious groups often understand the\ndialects of larger, more central, or higher-prestige groups when the\nconverse does not hold). So these sociological facts cannot\nindividuate languages either.\n\nChomsky therefore concludes that languages cannot be defined or\nindividuated extensionally or mind-externally, and hence the only\nscientifically interesting conception of a \u2018language\u2019 is\nthe \u2018I-language\u2019 view (see for example Chomsky 1986: 25;\n1992; 1995 and elsewhere). Chomsky says of E-languages that \u201call\nscientific approaches have simply abandoned these elements of what is\ncalled \u2018language\u2019 in common usage\u201d (Chomsky 1988,\n37); and \u201cwe can define E-language in one way or another or not\nat all, since the concept appears to play no role in the theory of\nlanguage\u201d (Chomsky 1986: 26; in saying that it appears to play\nno role in the theory of language, here he means that it plays no role\nin the theory he favours).\n\nThis conclusion may be bewildering to non-linguists as well as\nnon-Essentialists. It is at odds with what a broad range of\nphilosophers have tacitly assumed or explicitly claimed about language\nor languages: \u2018[A language] is a practice in which people\nengage\u2026it is constituted by rules which it is part of social\ncustom to follow\u2019 (Dummett 1986: 473\u2013473); \u2018Language\nis a set of rules existing at the level of common knowledge\u2019 and\nthese rules are \u2018norms which govern intentional social\nbehavior\u2019 (Itkonen 1978: 122), and so on. Generally speaking,\nthose philosophers influenced by Wittgenstein also take the view that\na language is a social-historical entity. But the opposite view has\nbecome a part of the conceptual underpinning of linguistics for many\nEssentialists.\n\nFailing to have precise individuation conditions is surely not a\nsufficient reason to deny that an entity can be studied\nscientifically. \u2018Language\u2019 as a count noun in the\nextensional and socio-historical sense is vague, but this need not be\nany greater obstacle to theorizing about them than is the vagueness of\nother terms for historical entities without clear individuation\nconditions, like \u2018species\u2019 and \u2018individual\norganism\u2019 in biology.\n\nAt least some Emergentist linguists, and perhaps some Externalists,\nwould be content to say that languages are collections of social\nconventions, publicly shared, and some philosophers would agree (see\nMillikan 2003, for example, and Chomsky 2003 for a reply). Lewis\n(1969) explicitly defends the view that language can be understood in\nterms of public communications, functioning to solve coordination\nproblems within a group (although he acknowledges that the\ncoordination could be between different temporal stages of one\nindividual, so language use by an isolated person is also\nintelligible; see the appendix \u201cLewis\u2019s Theory of\nLanguages as Conventions\u201d in the entry on\n idiolects,\n for further discussion of Lewis). What Chomsky calls E-languages,\nthen, would be perfectly amenable to linguistic or philosophical\nstudy. Santana (2016) makes a similar argument in terms of scientific\nidealization. He argues that since all sciences idealize their\ntargets, Chomsky needs to do more to show why idealizations concerning\nE-languages are illicit (see also Stainton 2014).\n2.2.2 \u2018I-language\u2019\n\nChomsky (1986) introduced the neologism \u2018I-language\u2019 in\npart to disambiguate the word \u2018grammar\u2019. In earlier\ngenerative Essentialist literature, \u2018grammar\u2019 was\n(deliberately) ambiguous between (i) the linguist\u2019s generative\ntheory and (ii) what a speaker knows when they know a language.\n\u2018I-language\u2019 can be regarded as a replacement for\nBever\u2019s term \u2018psychogrammar\u2019 (see also George 1989):\nit denotes a mental or psychological entity (not a grammarian\u2019s\ndescription of a language as externally manifested).\n\nI-language is first discussed under the sub-heading of\n\u2018internalized language\u2019 to denote linguistic knowledge.\nLater discussion in Chomsky 1986 and 1995 makes it clear that the\n\u2018I\u2019 of \u2018I-language\u2019 is supposed to suggest at\nleast three English words: \u2018individual\u2019,\n\u2018internal\u2019, and \u2018intensional\u2019. And Chomsky\nemphasizes that the neologism also implies a kind of realism about\nspeakers\u2019 knowledge of language.\n\nIndividual. A language is claimed to be strictly a\nproperty of individual human beings\u2014not groups. The contrast is\nbetween the idiolect of a single individual, and a dialect or language\nof a geographical, social, historical, or political group. I-languages\nare properties of the minds of individuals who know them.\n\nInternal. As generative Essentialists see it, your\nI-language is a state of your mind/brain. Meaning is\ninternal\u2014indeed, on Chomsky\u2019s conception, an\nI-language\n\nis a strictly internalist, individualist approach to language,\nanalogous in this respect to studies of the visual system. If the\ncognitive system of Jones\u2019s language faculty is in state L, we\nwill say that Jones has the I-language L. (Chomsky 1995: 13)\n\n\nAnd he clarifies the sense in which an I-language is internal by\nappealing to an analogy with the way the study of vision is\ninternal:\n\nThe same considerations apply to the study of visual perception along\nlines pioneered by David Marr, which has been much discussed in this\nconnection. This work is mostly concerned with operations carried out\nby the retina; loosely put, the mapping of retinal images to the\nvisual cortex. Marr\u2019s famous three levels of\nanalysis\u2014computational, algorithmic, and\nimplementation\u2014have to do with ways of construing such mappings.\nAgain, the theory applies to a brain in a vat exactly as it does to a\nperson seeing an object in motion. (Chomsky 1995: 52)\n\n\nThus, while the speaker\u2019s I-language may be involved in\nperforming operations over representations of distal\nstimuli\u2014representations of other speaker\u2019s\nutterances\u2014I-languages can and should be studied in isolation\nfrom their external environments.\n\nAlthough Chomsky sometimes refers to this narrow individuation of\nI-languages as \u2018individual\u2019, he clearly claims that\nI-languages are individuated in isolation from both speech communities\nand other aspects of the broadly conceived natural environment:\n\nSuppose Jones is a member of some ordinary community, and J is\nindistinguishable from him except that his total experience derives\nfrom some virtual reality design; or let J be Jones\u2019s Twin in a\nTwin-Earth scenario. They have had indistinguishable experiences and\nwill behave the same way (in so far as behavior is predictable at\nall); they have the same internal states. Suppose that J replaces\nJones in the community, unknown to anyone except the observing\nscientist. Unaware of any change, everyone will act as before,\ntreating J as Jones; J too will continue as before. The scientist\nseeking the best theory of all of this will construct a narrow\nindividualist account of Jones, J, and others in the community. The\naccount omits nothing\u2026 (Chomsky 1995: 53\u201354)\n\n\nThis passage can also be seen as suggesting a radically intensionalist\nconception of language.\n\nIntensional. The way in which I-languages are\n\u2018intensional\u2019 for Chomsky needs a little explication. The\nconcept of intension is familiar in logic and semantics, where\n\u2018intensional\u2019 contrasts with \u2018extensional\u2019.\nThe extension of a predicate like blue is simply the set of all blue\nobjects; the intension is the function that picks out in a given world\nthe blue objects contained therein. In a similar way, the extension of\na set can be distinguished from an intensional description of the set\nin terms of a function: the set of integer squares is {1, 4, 9, 16,\n25, 36, \u2026}, and the intension could be given in terms of the\none-place function f such that f(n) =\nn \u00d7 n. One difference between the two accounts\nof squaring is that the intensional one could be applied to a\ndifferent domain (any domain on which the \u2018\u00d7\u2019\noperation is defined: on the rationals rather than the integers, for\nexample, the extension of the identically defined function is a\ndifferent and larger set containing infinitely many fractions).\n\nIn an analogous way, a language can be identified with the set of all\nand only its expressions (regardless of what sort of object an\nexpression is: a word sequence, a tree structure, a complete\nderivation, or whatever), which is the extensional view; but it can\nalso be identified intensionally by means of a recipe or formal\nspecification of some kind\u2014what linguists call a grammar. Ludlow\n(2011) considers the first I (individual) to be the weakest link and\nthus the most expendable. He argues in its stead for a concept of a\n\u201c\\(\\Psi\\)-language\u201d which allows for the possibility of\nthe I-language relating to external objects either constitutively or\notherwise. \n\nIn natural language semantics, an intensional context is one where\nsubstitution of co-extensional terms fails to preserve truth value\n(Scott is Scott is true, and Scott is the author of\nWaverley is true, but the truth of George knows that Scott is\nScott doesn\u2019t guarantee the truth of George knows that\nScott is the author of Waverly, so knows that\nestablishes an intensional context).\n\nChomsky claims that the truth of an I-language attribution is not\npreserved by substituting terms that have the same extension. That is,\neven when two human beings do not differ at all on what expressions\nare grammatical, it may be false to say that they have the same\nI-language. Where H is a human being and L is a language (in the\ninformal sense) and R is the relation of knowing (or having, or using)\nthat holds between a human being and a language, Chomsky holds, in\neffect, that R establishes an intensional context in statements of the\ntheory:\n\n[F]or H to know L is for H to have a certain I-language. The\nstatements of the grammar are statements of the theory of mind about\nthe I-language, hence structures of the brain formulated at a certain\nlevel of abstraction from mechanisms. These structures are specific\nthings in the world, with their properties\u2026 The I-language L\nmay be the one used by a speaker but not the I-language L\u2032 even\nif the two generate the same class of expressions (or other formal\nobjects) \u2026 L\u2032 may not even be a possible human\nI-language, one attainable by the language faculty. (Chomsky 1986: 23)\n\n\nThe idea is that two individuals can know (or have, or use) different\nI-languages that generate exactly the same strings of words, and even\ngive them exactly the same structures. This situation forms the basis\nof Quine\u2019s (1972) infamous critique of the psychological reality\nof generative grammars (see Johnson 2015 for a solution in terms of\ninvariance of \u2018behaviorally equivalent grammar formalisms, to\nuse Quine\u2019s terminology, see also Nefdt 2021 for a similar\nresolution in terms of structural realism in the philosophy of\nscience).\n\nThe generative Essentialist conception of an I-language is\nantithetical to Emergentist research programs. If the fundamental\nexplanandum of scientific linguistics is how actual linguistic\ncommunication takes place, one must start by looking at both internal\n(psychological) and external (public) practices and conventions in\nvirtue of which it occurs, and consider the effect of historical and\ngeographic contingencies on the relevant underlying processes. That\nwould not rule out \u2018I-language\u2019 as part of the explanans;\nbut some Emergentists seem to be fictionalists about\nI-languages, in an analogous sense to the way that Chomsky is a\nfictionalist about E-languages. Emergentists do not see a child as\nlearning a generative grammar, but as learning how to use a symbolic\nsystem for propositional communication. On this view grammars are mere\nartifacts that are developed by linguists to codify aspects of the\nrelevant systems, and positing an I-language amounts to projecting the\nlinguist\u2019s codification illegitimately onto human minds (see,\nfor example, Tomasello 2003).\n\nThe I-language concept brushes aside certain phenomena of interest to\nthe Externalists, who hold that the forms of actually attested\nexpressions (sentences, phrases, syllables, and systems of such units)\nare of interest for linguistics. For example, computational\nlinguistics (work on speech recognition, machine translation, and\nnatural language interfaces to databases) must rely on a conception of\nlanguage as public and extensional; so must any work on the utterances\nof young children, or the effects of word frequency on vowel\nreduction, or misunderstandings caused by road sign wordings. At the\nvery least, it might be said on behalf of this strain of Externalism\n(along the lines of Soames 1984) that linguistics will need careful\nwork on languages as intersubjectively accessible systems before\nhypotheses about the I-language that purportedly produces them can be\ninvestigated.\n\nIt is a highly biased claim that the E-language concept \u201cappears\nto play no role in the theory of language\u201d (Chomsky 1986: 26).\nIndeed, the terminological contrast seems to have been invented not to\nclarify a distinction between concepts but to nudge linguistic\nresearch in a particular direction.\n",
