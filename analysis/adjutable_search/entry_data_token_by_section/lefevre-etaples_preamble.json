    "main_text": "\n\nJacques Lef\u00e8vre d\u2019\u00c9taples (c. 1450\u20131536)\ntaught philosophy at the University of Paris from around 1490 to 1508,\nand then applied his erudition and textual scholarship to biblical\nstudies and religious reform. Lef\u00e8vre traveled to Italy in\n1491, 1500, and 1507. There he sought out Ermolao Barbaro, Giovanni\nPico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, Angelo Poliziano, and other\nfamous humanists. He himself became famous for the many introductions,\ncommentaries, and editions relating to philosophical works he\npublished in Paris. These repackaged the full range of philosophical\nstudies, from his early interests in mathematics and natural magic, to\nthe entire curriculum of university logic, natural philosophy, moral\nphilosophy, and metaphysics.\n\nEarly modern scholars, from Francesco Patrizi da Cherso in the\nsixteenth century to Johann Jacob Brucker in the eighteenth, hailed\nLef\u00e8vre as a leading humanist, particularly praising his\nreplacement of scholastic questions with humanist eloquence. Modern\nscholars have taken a more nuanced view, studying\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s historical context: he pursued a humanist\nproject from within the university. Even after he retired\nfrom teaching philosophy, his versions of Aristotle were published in\nnew editions, sometimes with new commentaries, for several\ndecades\u2014for historians of Renaissance philosophy, they mark the\nnorthward, university-based movement of a humanist approach to\nAristotle which earlier scholars such as Leonardo Bruni and Ermolao\nBarbaro had pioneered in Italy. The university environment gave\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s vision of philosophical reform a broad scope,\nextending even to mathematical works of the quadrivium. He also\ncontributed to Renaissance philosophy beyond the university with\nimportant editions of the corpus attributed to Hermes Trismegistus,\nvarious Church Fathers, the Catalan mystic Ramon Lull, and the\nopera omnia of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa.\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s wide-ranging publications and their\nphilosophical import require more scholarly analysis than they have\nyet received. Since, however, his primary contribution to the history\nof philosophy was pedagogical and entailed reformulating older works\nto serve new audiences, the following survey focuses more on the\nbroader outlines of his project than on his specific philosophical\ndoctrines.\n",
