    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Political Conceptions of Justice\n3.4 Political Conceptions of Justice\n\nRawls\u2019s solution to the challenge of legitimacy in a liberal\nsociety is for political power to be exercised in accordance with a\npolitical conception of justice. A political conception of\njustice is an interpretation of the fundamental ideas implicit in that\nsociety\u2019s public political culture.\n\nA political conception is not derived from any particular\ncomprehensive doctrine, nor is it a compromise among the worldviews\nthat happen to exist in society at the moment. Rather, a political\nconception is freestanding: its content is set out independently of\nthe comprehensive doctrines that citizens affirm. Reasonable citizens,\nwho want to cooperate with one another on mutually acceptable terms,\nwill see that a freestanding political conception generated from ideas\nin the public political culture is the only basis for cooperation that\nall citizens can reasonably be expected to endorse. The use of\ncoercive political power guided by the principles of a political\nconception of justice will therefore be legitimate.\n\nThe three most fundamental ideas that Rawls finds in the public\npolitical culture of a democratic society are that citizens are\nfree and equal, and that society should be a\nfair system of cooperation. All liberal political conceptions\nof justice will therefore be centered on interpretations of these\nthree fundamental ideas.\n\nBecause there are many reasonable interpretations of\n\u201cfree,\u201d \u201cequal\u201d and \u201cfair,\u201d there\nwill be many liberal political conceptions of justice. Since all the\nmembers of this family interpret the same three fundamental ideas,\nhowever, all liberal political conceptions of justice will share\ncertain basic features:\n\nA liberal political conception of justice will ascribe to all\ncitizens familiar individual rights and liberties, such as rights of\nfree expression, liberty of conscience, and free choice of\noccupation;\nA political conception will give special priority to these rights\nand liberties, especially over demands to further the general good\n(e.g., to increase national wealth) or perfectionist values (e.g., to\npromote a particular view of human flourishing);\nA political conception will assure for all citizens sufficient\nall-purpose means to make effective use of their freedoms.\n\n\nThese abstract features must, Rawls says, be realized in certain kinds\nof institutions. He mentions several demands that all liberal\nconceptions of justice will make on institutions: a decent\ndistribution of income and wealth; fair opportunities for all\ncitizens, especially in education and training; government as the\nemployer of last resort; basic health care for all citizens; and\npublic financing of elections.\n\nThe use of political power in a liberal society will be legitimate if\nit is employed in accordance with the principles of any liberal\nconception of justice. By Rawls\u2019s criteria, a libertarian\nconception of justice (such as Nozick\u2019s in Anarchy, State,\nand Utopia) is not a liberal political conception of justice.\nLibertarianism does not assure all citizens sufficient means to make\nuse of their basic liberties, and it permits excessive inequalities of\nwealth and power. By contrast, Rawls\u2019s own conception of justice\n(justice as fairness) does qualify as a member of the family of\nliberal political conceptions of justice. \n",
