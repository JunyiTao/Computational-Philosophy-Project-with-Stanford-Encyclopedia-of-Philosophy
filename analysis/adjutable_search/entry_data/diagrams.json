    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nDiagrams or pictures probably rank among the oldest forms of human\ncommunication. They are not only used for representation but can also\nbe used to carry out certain types of reasoning, and hence play a\nparticular role in logic and mathematics. However, sentential\nrepresentation systems (e.g., first-order logic) have been dominant in\nthe modern history of logic, while diagrams have largely been seen as\nonly of marginal interest. Diagrams are usually adopted as a heuristic\ntool in exploring a proof, but not as part of a\n proof.[2]\n It is a quite recent movement among philosophers, logicians,\ncognitive scientists and computer scientists to focus on different\ntypes of representation systems, and much research has been focussed\non diagrammatic representation systems in particular.\n\nChallenging a long-standing prejudice against diagrammatic\nrepresentation, those working on multi-modal reasoning have taken\ndifferent kinds of approaches which we may categorize into three\ndistinct groups. One branch of research can be found in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive science. Since the limits of linguistic forms are\nclear to those who have been working on mental representation and\nreasoning, some philosophers and cognitive scientists have embraced\nthis new direction of multi-modal reasoning with enthusiasm and have\nexplored human reasoning and mental representation involving\nnon-linguistic forms (Cummins\n 1996;\n Chandrasekaran et al.\n 1995).\n Another strand of work on diagrammatic reasoning shows that there is\nno intrinsic difference between symbolic and diagrammatic systems as\nfar as their logical status goes. Some logicians have presented case\nstudies to prove that diagrammatic systems can be sound and complete\nin the same sense as symbolic systems. This type of result directly\nrefuted a widely-held assumption that diagrams are inherently\nmisleading, and abolished theoretical objections to diagrams being\nused in proofs (Shin\n 1994;\n Hammer\n 1995a).\n A third direction in multi-modal reasoning has been taken by computer\nscientists, whose interest is much more practical than those of the\nother groups. Not so surprisingly, those working in many areas in\ncomputer science\u2014for example, knowledge representation, systems\ndesign, visual programming, GUI design, and so on\u2014found new and\nexciting opportunities in this new concept of \u2018heterogeneous\nsystem\u2019 and have implemented diagrammatic representations in\ntheir research areas.\n\nWe have the following goals for this entry. First of all, we would\nlike to acquaint the reader with the details of some specific\ndiagrammatic systems. At the same time, the entry will address\ntheoretical issues, by exploring the nature of diagrammatic\nrepresentation and reasoning in terms of expressive power and\ncorrectness. The case study of the second section will not only\nsatisfy our first goal but also provide us with solid material for the\nmore theoretical and general discussion in the third section. The\nfourth section presents another case study and considers it in light\nof the third section\u2019s general discussion. As mentioned above,\nthe topic of diagrams has attracted much attention with important\nresults from many different research areas. Hence, our fifth section\naims to introduce various approaches to diagrammatic reasoning taken\nin different areas.\n\nFor further discussion, we need to clarify two related but distinct\nuses of the word \u2018diagram\u2019: diagram as internal mental\nrepresentation and diagram as external representation. The following\nquotation from Chandrasekaran et al.\n (1995:\n p. xvii) succinctly sums up the distinction between internal versus\nexternal diagrammatic representations:\n\nExternal diagrammatic representations: These are\nconstructed by the agent in a medium in the external world (paper,\netc), but are meant as representations by the agent.\nInternal diagrams or images: These comprise the\n(controversial) internal representations that are posited to have some\npictorial properties.\n\n\nAs we will see below, logicians focus on external diagrammatic\nsystems, the imagery debate among philosophers of mind and cognitive\nscientists is mainly about internal diagrams, and research on the\ncognitive role of diagrams touches on both forms.\n2. Diagrams as Representational Systems\n\nThe dominance of sentential representation systems in the history of\nmodern logic has obscured several important facts about diagrammatic\nsystems. One of them is that several well-known diagrammatic systems\nwere available as a heuristic tool before the era of modern logic.\nEuler circles, Venn diagrams, and Lewis Carroll\u2019s squares have\nbeen widely used for certain types of syllogistic reasoning (Euler\n 1768;\n Venn\n 1881;\n Carroll\n 1896).\n Another interesting, but neglected, story is that a founder of modern\nsymbolic logic, Charles Peirce, not only revised Venn diagrams but\nalso invented a graphical system, Existential Graphs, which has been\nproven to be equivalent to a predicate language (Peirce\n 1933;\n Roberts\n 1973;\n Zeman\n 1964).\n\nThese existing diagrams have inspired those researchers who have\nrecently drawn our attention to multi-modal representation. Logicians\nwho participate in the project have explored the subject in two\ndistinct ways. First, their interest has focused exclusively on\nexternally-drawn representation systems, as opposed to internal mental\nrepresentations. Second, their aim has been to establish the logical\nstatus of a system, rather than to explain its heuristic power, by\ntesting the correctness and the expressive power of selective\nrepresentation systems. If a system fails to justify its soundness or\nif its expressive power is too limited, a logician\u2019s interest in\nthat language will fade (Sowa\n 1984;\n Shin\n 1994).\n\nIn this section, we examine the historical development of Euler and\nVenn diagrams as a case study to illustrate the following aspects:\nFirst, this process will show us how one mathematician\u2019s simple\nintuition about diagramming syllogistic reasoning has gradually been\ndeveloped into a formal representation system. Second, we will observe\ndifferent emphases given to different stages of extension and\nmodification of a diagrammatic system. Thirdly and relatedly, this\nhistorical development illustrates an interesting tension and\ntrade-off between the expressive power and visual clarity of\ndiagrammatic systems. Most importantly, the reader will witness\nlogicians tackle the issue of whether there is any intrinsic reason\nthat sentential systems, but not diagrammatic systems, could provide\nus with rigorous proofs, and their success in answering this question\nin the negative.\n\nHence, the reader will not be surprised by the following conclusion\ndrawn by Barwise and Etchemendy, the first logicians to launch an\ninquiry into diagrammatic proofs in logic,\n\nthere is no principled distinction between inference formalisms that\nuse text and those that use diagrams. One can have rigorous, logically\nsound (and complete) formal systems based on diagrams. (Barwise &\nEtchemendy\n 1995:\n 214)\n\n\nThis conviction was necessary for the birth of their innovative\ncomputer program Hyperproof, which adopts both first-order\nlanguages and diagrams (in a multi-modal system) to teach\nelementary logic courses (Barwise & Etchemendy\n 1993\n and Barwise & Etchemendy\n 1994).\n2.1 Euler Diagrams\n\nLeonhard Euler, an 18th century mathematician, adopted closed curves\nto illustrate syllogistic reasoning (Euler\n 1768).\n The four kinds of categorical sentences are represented by him as\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Euler Diagrams\n\n\nFor the two universal statements, the system adopts spatial relations\namong circles in an intuitive way: If the circle labelled\n\u2018A\u2019 is included in the circle labelled\n\u2018B,\u2019 then the diagram represents the information\nthat all A is B. If there is no overlapping\npart between two circles, then the diagram conveys the information\nthat no A is B.\n\nThis representation is governed by the following\n convention:[3]\n\nEvery object x in the domain is assigned a unique location,\nsay l(x), in the plane such that\nl(x) is in region R if and only if\nx is a member of the set that the region R\nrepresents.\n\n\nThe power of this representation lies in the fact that an object being\na member of a set is easily conceptualized as the object falling\ninside the set, just as locations on the page are thought of as\nfalling inside or outside drawn circles. The system\u2019s power also\nlies in the fact that no additional conventions are needed to\nestablish the meanings of diagrams involving more than one circle:\nrelationships holding among sets are asserted by means of the same\nrelationships holding among the circles representing them. The\nrepresentations of the two universal statements, \u2018All\nAare B\u2019 and \u2018No A is\nB,\u2019 illustrate this strength of the system.\n\nMoving on to two existential statements, this clarity is not\npreserved. Euler justifies the diagram of \u201cSome A is\nB\u201d saying that we can infer visually that\nsomething in A is also contained in B since part of\narea A is contained in area B (Euler 1768: 233).\nObviously, Euler himself believed that the same kind of visual\ncontainment relation among areas can be used in this case as well as\nin the case of universal statements. However, Euler\u2019s belief is\nnot correct and this representation raises a damaging ambiguity. In\nthis diagram, not only is part of circle A contained in area\nB (as Euler describes), but the following are true: (i) part\nof circle B is contained in area A (ii) part of\ncircle A is not contained in circle B (iii) part of\ncircle B is not contained in circle A. That is, the\nthird diagram could be read off as \u201cSome B is\nA,\u201d \u201cSome A is not B,\u201d\nand \u201cSome B is not A\u201d as well as\n\u201cSome A is B.\u201d In order to avoid this\nambiguity, we need to set up several more\n conventions.[4]\n\nEuler\u2019s own examples nicely illustrate the strengths and\nweaknesses of his diagrammatic system.\n\nExample 1. All A are B. All\nC are A. Therefore, all C are B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2. No A is B. All\nC are B. Therefore, no C is A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both examples, the reader can easily infer the conclusion, and this\nillustrates visually powerful features of Euler diagrams. However,\nwhen existential statements are represented, things become more\ncomplicated, as explained above. For instance:\n\n\nExample 3. No A is B. Some\nC is A. Therefore, Some C is not\nB.\n\nNo single diagram can represent the two premises, since the\nrelationship between sets B and C cannot be fully\nspecified in one single diagram. Instead, Euler suggests the following\nthree possible cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuler claims that the proposition \u2018Some C is not\nB\u2019 can be read off from all these diagrams. However, it\nis far from being visually clear how the first two cases lead a user\nto reading off this proposition, since a user might read off \u201cNo\nC is B\u201d from case 1 and \u201cAll B\nis C\u201d from case 2.\n\nHence, the representation of existential statements not only obscures\nthe visual clarity of Euler Circles but also raises serious\ninterpretational problems for the system. Euler himself seemed to\nrecognize this potential problem and introduced a new syntactic\ndevice, \u2018*\u2019 (representing non-emptiness) as an attempt to\nrepair this flaw (1768: Letter 105).\n\nHowever, a more serious drawback is found when this system fails to\nrepresent certain compatible (that is, consistent) pieces of\ninformation in a single diagram. For example, Euler\u2019s system\nprevents us from drawing a single diagram representing the following\npairs of statements: (i) \u201cAll A are B\u201d\nand \u201cNo A is B\u201d (which are consistent if\nA is an empty set). (ii) \u201cAll A are\nB\u201d and \u201cAll B are A\u201d\n(which are consistent when A = B). (iii) \u201cSome\nA is B\u201d and \u201cAll A are\nB\u201d. (Suppose we drew an Euler diagram for the former\nproposition and try to add a new compatible piece of information,\ni.e., the latter, to this existing diagram.) This shortcoming is\nclosely related to Venn\u2019s motivation for his own diagrammatic\nsystem (see\n Section 3.1\n for other shortcomings of Euler\u2019s system).\n2.2 Venn Diagrams\n\nVenn\u2019s criticism of Euler Circles is summarized in the following\npassage:\n\nThe weak point in this [Euler diagrams], and in all similar schemes,\nconsists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the\nactual relation of classes to each other, rather than the imperfect\nknowledge of these relations which we may possess, or may wish to\nconvey by means of the proposition. (Venn\n 1881:\n 510)\n\n\nBecause of its strictness, Euler\u2019s system sometimes fails in\nrepresenting consistent pieces of information in a single diagram, as\nshown above. In addition to this expressive limitation, Euler\u2019s\nsystem also suffers other kinds of expressive limitations with respect\nto non-empty sets, due to topological restrictions on plane figures\n(see\n Section 3.1).\n\nVenn\u2019s new system\n (1881)\n was to overcome these expressive limitations so that partial\ninformation can be represented. The solution was his idea of\n\u2018primary diagrams\u2019. A primary diagram represents all the\npossible set-theoretic relations between a number of sets, without\nmaking any existential commitments about them. For example, Figure 2\nshows the primary diagram about sets A and B.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Venn\u2019s Primary diagrams\n\n\nAccording to Venn\u2019s system, this diagram does not convey any\nspecific information about the relation between these two sets. This\nis the major difference between Euler and Venn diagrams.\n\nFor the representation of universal statements, unlike the visually\nclear spatial containment relations in the case of Euler diagrams,\nVenn\u2019s solution is \u2018to shade them [the appropriate areas]\nout\u2019 (Venn\n 1881:\n 122). By using this syntactic device, we obtain diagrams for\nuniversal statements as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Venn\u2019s shading\n\n\nVenn\u2019s choice of shading might not be absolutely arbitrary in\nthat a shading could be interpreted as a visualization of set\nemptiness. However, it should be noted that a shading is a new\nsyntactic device which Euler did not use. This revision gave\nflexibility to the system so that certain compatible pieces of\ninformation may be represented in a single diagram. In the following,\nthe diagram on the left combines two pieces of information, \u201cAll\nA are B\u201d and \u201cNo A is\nB,\u201d to visually convey the information \u201cNothing\nis A.\u201d The diagram on the right, which represents both\n\u201cAll A are B\u201d and \u201cAll B\nare A,\u201d clearly shows that A is the same as\nB:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, using primary diagrams also avoids some other expressivity\nproblems (to do with spatial properties of diagram objects) discussed\nbelow, in\n Section 3.\n Surprisingly, Venn was silent about the representation of existential\nstatements, which was another difficulty of Euler diagrams. We can\nonly imagine that Venn might have introduced another kind of a\nsyntactic object representing existential commitment. This is what\nCharles Peirce did about twenty years later. \n2.3 Peirce\u2019s extension\n\nPeirce points out that Venn\u2019s system has no way of representing\nthe following kinds of information: existential statements,\ndisjunctive information, probabilities, and relations. Peirce aimed to\nextend Venn\u2019s system in expressive power with respect to the\nfirst two kinds of propositions, i.e., existential and disjunctive\nstatements. This extension was completed by means of the following\nthree devices. (i) Replace Venn\u2019s shading representing emptiness\nwith a new symbol, \u2018o\u2019. (ii) Introduce a symbol\n\u2018x\u2019 for existential import. (iii) For disjunctive\ninformation, introduce a linear symbol \u2018-\u2019 which connects\n\u2018o\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 symbols.\n\nFor example, Figure 4 represents the statement, \u2018All A\nare B or some A is B\u2019, which neither\nEuler\u2019s nor Venn\u2019s system can represent in a single\ndiagram.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A Peirce diagram\n\n\nThe reason that Peirce replaced Venn\u2019s shading for emptiness\nwith the symbol \u2018o\u2019 seems to be obvious: It would not be\neasy to connect shadings or shadings and \u2018x\u2019s in order to\nrepresent disjunctive information. In this way, Peirce increased the\nexpressive power of the system, but this change was not without its\ncosts.\n\nFor example, the following diagram represents the proposition\n\u2018Either all A are B and some\nA is B, or no A is B and\nsome B is not A\u2019:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading off this diagram requires more than reading off visual\ncontainment among circles (as in Euler diagrams) or shadings (as in\nVenn diagrams), but also requires extra conventions for reading\ncombinations of the symbols \u2018o,\u2019 \u2018x,\u2019 and\nlines. Peirce\u2019s new conventions increased the expressive power\nof single diagrams, but the arbitrariness of its conventions and more\nconfusing representations (for example, the above diagram) sacrificed\nthe visual clarity which Euler\u2019s original system enjoys. At this\npoint, Peirce himself confesses that \u2018there is a great\ncomplexity in the expression that is essential to the meaning\u2019\n(Peirce\n 1933:\n 4.365). Thus, when Peirce\u2019s revision was completed, most of\nEuler\u2019s original ideas about visualization were lost, except\nthat a geometrical object (the circle) is used to represent (possibly\nempty) sets.\n\nAnother important contribution Peirce made to the study of diagrams\nstarts with the following remark:\n\n\u2018Rule\u2019 is here used in the sense in which we speak of the\n\u2018rules\u2019 of algebra; that is, as a permission under\nstrictly defined conditions. (Peirce\n 1933:\n 4.361)\n\n\nPeirce was probably the first person to discuss rules of\ntransformation in a non-sentential representation system. In the same\nway that the rules of algebra tell us which transformations of symbols\nare permitted and which are not, so should the rules of diagram\nmanipulation. Some of Pierce\u2019s six rules needed more\nclarification and turn out to be incomplete\u2014a problem which\nPeirce himself anticipated. However, more importantly, Peirce did not\nhave any theoretical tool\u2014a clear distinction between syntax and\nsemantics\u2014to convince the reader that each rule is correct or to\ndetermine whether more rules are needed. That is, his important\nintuition (that there could be transformation rules for diagrams)\nremained to be justified.\n2.4 Diagrams as formal systems\n\nShin\n (1994)\n follows up Peirce\u2019s work in two directions. One is to improve\nPeirce\u2019s version of Venn diagrams, and the other is to prove the\nsoundness and the completeness of this revised system.\n\nShin\u2019s work alters Peirce\u2019s modifications of Venn diagrams\nto achieve an increase in expressive power without such a severe loss\nof visual clarity. This revision is made in two stages: (i) Venn-I:\nretains Venn\u2019s shadings (for emptiness), Peirce\u2019s\n\u2018x\u2019 (for existential import) and Peirce\u2019s connecting\nline between \u2018x\u2019s (for disjunctive information). (ii)\nVenn-II: This system, which is proven to be logically equivalent to\nmonadic predicate logic, is the same as Venn-I except that a\nconnecting line between diagrams is newly introduced to display\ndisjunctive information.\n\nReturning to one of Euler\u2019s examples we will see the contrast\namong these different versions clearly:\n\nExample 3. No A is B. Some\nC is A. Therefore, Some C is not\nB.\n\n\nEuler admits that no single Euler diagram can be drawn to represent\nthe premises, but that three possible cases must be drawn.\nVenn\u2019s system is silent about existential statements. Now,\nPeirce\u2019s and Shin\u2019s systems represent these two premises\nin a single diagram as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Shin\u2019s diagram, Venn\u2019s shading convention\nfor emptiness, as opposed to Peirce\u2019s \u2018o\u2019, much more\nnaturally leads the reader to the inference \u201cSome C is\nnot B\u201d than in the case of Peirce\u2019s diagram.\n\nHowever, Venn-I cannot express disjunctive information between\nuniversal statements or between universal and existential statements.\nRetaining Venn-I\u2019s expressive power, Venn-II allows diagrams to\nbe connected by a line. Peirce\u2019s confusing looking diagram above\nis equivalent to the following Venn-II diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this revision, Shin\n (1994)\n presented each of these two systems as a standard formal\nrepresentation system equipped with its own syntax and semantics. The\nsyntax tells us which diagrams are acceptable, that is, which are\nwell-formed, and which manipulations are permissible in each system.\nThe semantics defines logical consequences among diagrams. Using these\ntools, it is proven that the systems are sound and complete, in the\nsame sense that some symbolic logics are.\n\nThis approach has posed a fundamental challenge to some of the\nassumptions held about representation systems. Since the development\nof modern logic, important concepts, e.g., syntax, semantics,\ninference, logical consequence, validity, and completeness, have been\napplied to sentential representation systems only. However, none of\nthese turned out to be intrinsic to these traditional symbolic logics\nonly. For any representation system, whether it is sentential\nor diagrammatic, we can discuss two levels, a syntactic and a semantic\nlevel. What inference rules tell us is how to manipulate a given unit,\nwhether symbolic or diagrammatic, to another. The definition of\nlogical consequence is also free from any specific form of a\nrepresentation system. The same argument goes for the soundness and\nthe completeness proofs. When a system is proven to be sound, we\nshould be able to adopt it in proofs. In fact, much current research\nexplores the use of diagrams in automated theorem proving (see\nBarker-Plummer & Bailin\n 1997;\n and Jamnik et al.\n 1999).\n2.5 Euler Circles revisited\n\nIt is interesting and important to notice that the gradual changes\nmade from Euler Circles through to Shin\u2019s systems share one\ncommon theme: to increase both the expressive and logical power of the\nsystem so that it is sound, complete, and logically equivalent to\nmonadic predicate logic. The main revision from Euler to Venn\ndiagrams, introducing primary diagrams, allows us to represent partial\nknowledge about relations between sets. The extension from Venn to\nPeirce diagrams is made so that existential and disjunctive\ninformation may be represented more effectively.\n\nBoth Venn and Peirce adopted the same kind of solution in order to\nachieve these improvements: to introduce new syntactic objects, that\nis, shadings by Venn, and \u2018x\u2019s, \u2018o\u2019s, and\nlines by Peirce. However, on the negative side, these revised systems\nsuffer from a loss of visual clarity, as seen above, mainly because of\nthe introduction of more arbitrary conventions. The modifications from\nPeirce to Shin diagrams concentrate on restoring visual clarity, but\nwithout loss of expressive power.\n\nHammer and Shin take a different path from these revisions: To revive\nEuler\u2019s homomorphic relation between circles and\nsets\u2014containment among circles represents the subset relation\namong sets, and non-overlapping of regions represents the disjoint\nrelation\u2014and at the same time, to adopt Venn\u2019s primary\ndiagrams by default. On the other hand, this revised Euler system is\nnot a self-sufficient tool for syllogistic reasoning, since it cannot\nrepresent existential statements. For more details of this revised\nsystem, refer to (Hammer & Shin\n 1998).\n\nThis case study raises an interesting question for further research on\ndiagrammatic reasoning. Throughout the different developments of Euler\ndiagrams, increasing its expressive power and enhancing its visual\nclarity seem to be complementary to each other. Depending on purposes,\nwe need to give priority to one over the other. Hammer and\nShin\u2019s alternative system provides a simple model for the\ndevelopment of other efficient non-sentential representational\nsystems, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention in\ncomputer science and cognitive science.\n3. Consequences of Spatial Properties of Diagrams\n\nWhile it is often possible to afford diagrams the same logical status\nas formulae (as argued above), there are still important differences\n(which can have ramifications for correctness of the system) between\ndiagrams and traditional linear proof calculi. An important point to\nnote about diagrams (cf. Russell\n 1923)\n is that spatial relations between objects in a diagram can be used to\nrepresent relations between objects in some other domain. Sequential\nlanguages (e.g., symbolic logics, natural languages), however, use\nonly the relation of concatenation to represent relations between\nobjects. The peculiar representational use of spatial relations in the\ncase of diagrams is direct and intuitive, as seen in the development\nof Euler Diagrams above, but also has its perils\u2014as we shall\ndiscuss. Spatial constraints, being peculiar to diagrammatic systems,\ncan be expected to be an important source of both their strengths and\nweaknesses. Psychological considerations concerning human capacities\nfor visual processing of information, and skill at qualitative spatial\nreasoning, also have ramifications for the effectiveness of reasoning\nwith diagrams, but we shall not survey them here. \n\nA particular distinguishing feature of diagrams is that they obey\ncertain \u201cnomic\u201d or \u201cintrinsic\u201d constraints due\nto their use of plane surfaces as a medium of representation. The idea\nis that sentential languages are based on acoustic signals which are\nsequential in nature, and so must have a compensatingly complex syntax\nin order to express certain relationships\u2014whereas diagrams,\nbeing two-dimensional, are able to display some relationships without\nthe intervention of a complex syntax (Stenning & Lemon\n 2001).\n Diagrams exploit this possibility\u2014the use of spatial relations\nto represent other relations. The question is; how well can spatial\nrelations and objects represent other (possibly more abstract) objects\nand relations?\n\nLogical reasoning with diagrams is often carried out in virtue of\ntheir depiction of all possible models of a situation, up to\ntopological equivalence of the diagrams (this, of course, depends on\nthe particular diagrammatic system in use). A single diagram is often\nan abstraction over a class of situations, and once a suitable diagram\nhas been constructed, inferences can simply be read off the\nrepresentation without any further manipulation. In some diagrammatic\nsystems (e.g., Euler Circles) inference is carried out by constructing\ndiagrams correctly and reading information off them. The complexity of\nusing inference rules in a symbolic logic is, in these cases, replaced\nby the problem of drawing particular diagrams\n correctly.[5]\n For instance, an Euler Circles diagram ventures to capture\nrelationships between sets using topological relationships between\nplane regions in such a way that that it depicts all the possible ways\nthat a certain collection of set-theoretic statements could be true.\nThis has two important consequences: (1) if a certain diagram cannot\nbe drawn then the described situation must be impossible (termed\n\u201cself-consistency\u201d), and (2) if a certain relationship\nbetween diagram objects must be drawn, then the corresponding relation\ncan be inferred as logically valid. (See the numerous examples in\n Section 2.)\n This phenomenon is often termed a \u201cfree-ride\u201d (Barwise\n& Shimojima\n 1995).\n This style of diagrammatic reasoning is thus dependent on a\nparticular representational use of diagrams\u2014that they represent\nclasses of models. If a particular class of models cannot be\nrepresented by a diagrammatic system, then those cases will not be\ntaken into account in inferences using the system, and incorrect\ninferences might be drawn. This fact makes the representational\nadequacy of diagrammatic systems, restricted by their spatial nature,\nof paramount importance, as we shall now explore.\n3.1 Limitations on diagrammatic representation and reasoning\n\nThe representational use of the spatial relations in the plane\nconstrains diagrammatic representation, and therefore reasoning with\ndiagrams, in certain important ways. In particular, there are\ntopological and geometrical (let us lump them together as\n\u201cspatial\u201d) properties of diagrammatic objects and\nrelations which limit the expressive power of diagrammatic systems.\nFor instance, in graph theory it is known that some simple structures\ncannot be drawn in the plane. For example, the graph\nK5 is the graph consisting of 5 nodes, each joined\nto the other by an arc. This graph is non-planar, meaning that it\ncannot be drawn without at least two of the arcs crossing. This is\njust the sort of constraint on possible diagrams that limits the\nexpressive power of diagrammatic systems. Now, since diagrammatic\nreasoning can occur by enumeration of all possible models of a\nsituation, this representational inadequacy (a type of incompleteness)\nrenders many diagrammatic systems incorrect if they are used for\nlogical reasoning (e.g., see the critique of Englebretsen\n 1992\n in Lemon & Pratt\n 1998).\n\nPerhaps the most simple example of this is due to Lemon and\n Pratt[6]\n (see e.g.,\n 1997).\n Consider Euler Circles\u2014where convex regions of the plane\nrepresent sets, and overlap of the regions represents non-empty\nintersection of the corresponding sets. A result of convex topology\nknown as Helly\u2019s Theorem states (for the 2 dimensional case)\nthat if every triple of 4 convex regions has a non-empty intersection\nthen all four regions must have a non-empty intersection.\n\nTo understand the ramifications of this, consider the following\nproblem:\n\nExample 4. Using Euler Circles, represent the\nfollowing premises:\n\n\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2260 \u2205 \n B \u2229 C \u2229 D \u2260 \u2205\n C \u2229 D \u2229 A \u2260 \u2205\n\n\n\nNote that, in terms of set-theory, only trivial consequences follow\nfrom these premises. However, an Euler diagram of the premises, such\nas Figure 5, leads to the incorrect conclusion that\nA\u00a0\u2229\u00a0B\u00a0\n\u2229\u00a0C\u00a0 \u2229\u00a0D\u00a0\n\u2260\u00a0\u2205 (due to the quadruple overlap region in the centre\nof the diagram): \n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: An Euler\u2019s Circles representation exhibiting\nHelly\u2019s Theorem\n\n\nIn other words, a user of Euler Circles is\n forced[7]\n to represent a relationship between the sets which is not logically\nnecessary. This means both that there are logically possible\nsituations which the system cannot represent, and that a user would\nmake incorrect inferences if they relied on the system for reasoning.\nMore generally, this type of result can be generated for many\ndifferent types of diagrammatic system, depending on the particular\nspatial relations and objects which they use in representation\u2014a\nresearch programme which is ongoing.\n\nFor example, using non-convex regions (e.g., \u201cblobs\u201d\ninstead of circles) leads to a similar problem, only that non-planar\ngraphs are involved instead of Helly\u2019s Theorem. A similar result\nconcerns linear diagrams for syllogisms Englebretsen\n 1992,\n where lines are used to represent sets, points represent individuals,\npoint-line intersection represents set-membership, and intersection of\nlines represents set-intersection. Again, planarity constraints\nrestrict the expressive power of the system and lead to incorrect\ninferences.\n\nAtsushi Shimojima\u2019s \u201cconstraint hypothesis\u201d perhaps\nbest sums all this up:\n\nRepresentations are objects in the world, and as such they obey\ncertain structural constraints that govern their possible formation.\nThe variance in inferential potential of different modes of\nrepresentation is largely attributable to different ways in which\nthese structural constraints on representations match with the\nconstraints on targets of representation (Shimojima\n 1996a,\n 1999).\n\n3.2 Efficacy of diagrams\n\nAs discussed above, much of the interest in diagrams has been\ngenerated by the claim that they are somehow more\n\u201ceffective\u201d than traditional logical representations for\ncertain types of task. Certainly, for example, a map is a greater aid\nto navigation than a verbal description of a landscape. However, while\nthere are certainly psychological advantages to be gained through the\nuse of diagrams, they are (as in the case of Euler Circles) often\nineffective as representations of abstract objects and relationships.\nOnce a purely intuitive notion, non-psychological claims about\n\u201cefficacy\u201d of diagrammatic systems can be examined in\nterms of standard formal properties of languages (Lemon et al.\n 1999).\n In particular, many diagrammatic systems are self-consistent,\nincorrect, and incomplete, and complexity of inference with the\ndiagrams is NP-hard. By way of contrast, most sentential logics, while\nable to express inconsistencies, are complete and\n correct[8]\n .\n\nOn the other hand, not being able to represent contradictions could\nprovide us with interesting insights about the nature of diagrammatic\nrepresentation. If a central goal of a language is to represent the\nworld or a state of affairs, then representing contradictions or\ntautologies is called into question. Neither contradictions nor\ntautologies are part of the world. How can we draw a picture, or take\na picture, of the contradiction that \u201cit is raining and it is\nnot raining\u201d? How about the picture of the disjunctive\ninformation \u201cit is either raining or not raining\u201d? Now, we\nseem to be much closer to Wittgenstein\u2019s classic picture theory\nof language (Wittgenstein\n 1921).\n4. Diagrammatic Systems in Geometry\n\nMathematicians have used, and continue to use, diagrams extensively.\nThe communication of mathematical concepts and proofs\u2014in\ntextbooks, on blackboards\u2014is not uniformly sentential. Figures\nand pictures are common. In line with the prevailing conception of\nlogic as essentially sentential, however, they are not usually thought\nto play a role in rigorous mathematical reasoning. Their use is taken\nto be limited to enhancing comprehension of a proof. They are not\nstandardly believed to form any part of the proof itself. \n\nThe attitude is well illustrated by the standard assessment of\nEuclid\u2019s methodology in the Elements. In no\nmathematical subject are diagrams more prominent than in the\nelementary geometry Euclid develops in the text. The proofs of the\nsubject seem to be in some sense about the diagrams of triangles and\ncircles that appear with them. This is especially the case with the\ngeometric proofs of the Elements. Diagrams for Euclid are not\nmerely illustrative. Some of his inference steps depend on an\nappropriately constructed diagram. On the standard story, these steps\nindicate gaps in Euclid\u2019s proofs. They show how Euclid did not\nfully carry out the project of developing geometry axiomatically.\n\nKen Manders set out to explode this story with his seminal work\n\u201cThe Euclidean diagram\u201d\n (2008 [1995]).\n His analysis of Euclid\u2019s diagrammatic proof method reveals that\nEuclid employs diagrams in a controlled, systematic way. It thus calls\ninto question the common, negative assessment of the rigor of the\nElements. Moreover, the specifics of Manders\u2019 analysis\nsuggest that the proofs of the text can be understood to adhere to a\nformal diagrammatic logic. This was subsequently confirmed by the\ndevelopment of formal diagrammatic systems designed to characterize\nsuch a logic. The first of these was FG (presented in\nMiller\n 2007),\n followed by the system Eu (Mumma\n 2010).\n\nThis section is devoted to explicating Manders\u2019 analysis and the\nformal systems that have emerged from it. After a brief survey of how\nEuclid\u2019s diagrams have been viewed through the centuries,\nManders\u2019 picture of their role in geometric proofs is presented.\nA description of how the systems FG and\nEu render this picture in formal terms and\ncharacterize a logic of Euclidean diagrams then follows.\n4.1 Views on Euclid\u2019s diagrams from 4th century BCE to the 20th century CE\n\nThe elementary geometry of the Elements was taken to be\nfoundational to mathematics from its inception in ancient Greece until\nthe 19th century. Accordingly, philosophers concerned with\nthe nature of mathematics found themselves obliged to comment on the\ndiagrammatic proofs of the text. A central issue, if not the central\nissue, was the generality problem. The diagram that appears\nwith a Euclidean proof provides a single instantiation of the\ntype of geometric configurations the proof is about. Yet properties\nseen to hold in the diagram are taken to hold of all the\nconfigurations of the given type. What justifies this jump from the\nparticular to the general?\n\nAs an illustration, consider the proof for proposition 16 of book I of\nthe Elements. \n\nThe proposition is:\n\nIn any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle\nis greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.\n\n\nEuclid\u2019s proof is:\n\n\n\n Let ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to\nD;\n I say that the angle ACD is greater than the interior and\nopposite angle BAC.\n Let AC be bisected at E [I, 10], and let BE be joined and\nproduced in a straight line to F;\n let EF be made equal to BE [I,3], and let FC be joined.\n Then, since AE is equal to EC, and BE equal to EF, the two sides\nAE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF respectively; and the angle\nAEB is equal to the angle FEC [I, 15].\n Therefore the base AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle\nABE is equal to the triangle CFE [I,4];therefore the angle BAE is\nequal to the angle ECF (which is also the angle ACF);\n But the angle ACD is greater than the angle ACF;\n Therefore the angle ACD is greater than BAE.\n\n\n\nThe proof seems to refer to the parts of the diagram given with the\nproof. Nevertheless the proof does not purport to establish something\njust about the triangle in the diagram, but something about all\ntriangles. The diagram thus serves to represent, in some way, all\ntriangles.\n\nThe role of diagrams as representations is remarked upon by Aristotle\nin book A, chapter 10 of the Posterior Analytics:\n\n\nThe geometer bases no conclusion on the particular line he has drawn\nbeing that which he has described, but [refers to] what is illustrated\nby the figures. (The translation is by T. Heath, found in Euclid 1956:\nvol. I, p.119)\n\n\nAristotle does not in passage confront the question of how the\ngeometer uses diagrams to reason about what they illustrate. A few\ncenturies later Proclus does in his commentary on the\nElements. Proclus asserts that passing from a particular\ninstance to a universal conclusion is justified because geometers\n\n\n\u2026 use the objects set out in the diagram not as these\nparticular figures, but as figures resembling others of the same sort.\nIt is not as having such-and-such a size that the angle before me is\nbisected, but as being rectilinear and nothing more\u2026Suppose the\ngiven angle is a right angle\u2026if I make no use of its rightness\nand consider only its rectilinear character, the proposition will\napply equally to all angles with rectilinear sides. (A Commentary\non the First Book of Euclid\u2019s Elements, Morrow\n 1970:\n 207))\n\n\nThe place of diagrams in geometry remained an issue into the early\nmodern period. Major philosophical figures in the 17th and\n18th centuries advanced positions on it. Anticipating the\npredominate modern view, Leibniz asserts:\n\n\n\u2026it is not the figures which furnish the proof with geometers,\nthough the style of the exposition may make you think so. The force of\nthe demonstration is independent of the figure drawn, which is drawn\nonly to facilitate the knowledge of our meaning, and to fix the\nattention; it is the universal propositions, i.e., the definitions,\naxioms, and theorems already demonstrated, which make the reasoning,\nand which would sustain it though the figure were not there. (1704\n New Essays:\n 403)\n\n\nIn the introduction to his Principles of Human Knowledge\n(1710, section 16), Berkeley reiterates 13 centuries later\nProclus\u2019s take on the generality problem. Though one always has\na particular triangle \u2018in view\u2019 when working through a\ndemonstration about triangles, there is \u2018not the least\nmention\u2019 of the particular details of the particular triangle in\nthe demonstration. The demonstration thus proves, according to\nBerkeley, a general proposition about triangles. \n\nThe most developed, and predictably most complex and difficult,\naccount of geometric diagrams in the modern period can be found in\nKant. Kant saw something of deep epistemological significance in the\ngeometer\u2019s use of a particular diagram to reason about a\ngeometric concept. In reasoning in this way, the geometer\n\n\nconsiders the concept in concreto, although non-empirically,\nbut rather solely as one it has exhibited a priori, i.e.,\nconstructed, and in which that which follows from the general\nconditions of the construction must also generally of the object of\nthe constructed concept. (1781, Critique of Pure Reason,\nA716/B744.)\n\n\nFor contrasting views of what passages like these reveal about where\ndiagrams fit in Kant\u2019s philosophy of geometry, see Shabel\n 2003\n and Friedman\n 2012.\n \n\nIn the 19th century geometry and mathematics as a whole\nunderwent a revolution. Concepts far more abstract and general than\nthose found in the Elements (e.g., non-Euclidean geometries,\nsets) emerged. Not only did questions about the nature of\nEuclid\u2019s diagrammatic method lose their urgency, the method came\nto be understood as mathematically flawed. The latter view found its\nmost precise expression in the groundbreaking work of Moritz Pasch,\nwho provided the first modern axiomatization of elementary geometry in\nPasch\n (1882).\n In it, Pasch showed how the subject could be developed without\nreference to diagrams or even to the geometric concepts diagrams\ninstantiate. The methodological norm guiding the work is nicely\nexpressed in the following often-quoted passage:\n\n\nIn fact, if geometry is genuinely deductive, the process of deducing\nmust be in all respects independent of the sense of the\ngeometrical concepts, just as it must be independent of figures; only\nthe relations set out between the geometrical concepts used\nin the propositions (respectively definitions) concerned ought to be\ntaken into account. (Pasch\n 1882:\n 98; emphasis in original. The translation here is from Schlimm\n 2010)\n\n\nThe norm has since entrenched itself both in mathematics and in\nphilosophical discussions of mathematics. It is its entrenchment in\nthe latter that Manders opposes in Manders\n 2008 [1995].\n In the account he develops of ancient geometry, the necessity of\nconsulting a diagram in a proof does not indicate a deductive gap.\nRather, diagram and text together form a rigorous and deductive\nmathematical proof.\n4.2 Manders\u2019 exact/co-exact distinction and the generality problem\n4.2.1 The exact/co-exact distinction\n\nTo explain the division of labor between text and diagram in ancient\ngeometry, Manders distinguishes between the exact and\nco-exact properties of geometric diagrams in Manders\n 2008 [1995].\n Underlying the distinction is a notion of variation. The\nco-exact conditions realized by a diagram \u2018are those\nconditions which are unaffected by some range of every continuous\nvariation of a specified diagram.\u2019 Exact conditions, in\ncontrast, are affected once the diagram is subject to the smallest\nvariation. Roughly, a diagram\u2019s co-exact properties comprise the\nways its parts define a finite set of planar regions, and the\ncontainment relations between these regions. A prominent exact\nrelation is the equality of two magnitudes within a diagram. For\nexample, only the slightest change to the position of CF in the\ndiagram for proposition 16 is required to make the angles BAE and ECF\nunequal.\n\nManders\u2019 key observation is that Euclid\u2019s diagrams\ncontribute to proofs only through their co-exact properties.\nEuclid never infers an exact property from a diagram unless it follows\ndirectly from a co-exact property. Relations between magnitudes which\nare not exhibited as a containment are either assumed from the outset\nor are proved via a chain of inferences in the text. This can easily\nbe confirmed with the proof of proposition 16. The one inference that\nrelies on the diagram is the second to last inference of the proof.\nThe inference, specifically, is that angle ACD is greater than angle\nACF. This, crucially, is based on seeing from the diagram that angle\nACD contains angle ACF. There are many other relations\nasserted to hold in the proof. Though the diagram instantiates them,\nthey are explicitly justified in the text. And with these relations,\nthe relata are spatially separated magnitudes. \n\nIt is not difficult to hypothesize why Euclid would have restricted\nhimself in such a way. It is only in their capacity to represent\nco-exact properties and relations that diagrams seem capable of\nfunctioning effectively as symbols of proof. The exact properties of\ndiagrams are too refined to be easily reproducible and to support\ndeterminate judgments. As Manders puts it\n\n\nThe practice has resources to limit the risk of disagreement on\n(explicit) co-exact attributions from a diagram; but it lacks such\nresources for exact attributions, and therefore could not allow them\nwithout dissolving into a disarray of irresolvably conflicting\njudgements. (Manders\n 2008 [1995]:\n 91\u201392)\n\n\nManders\u2019 insights lead naturally to the idea that Euclid\u2019s\narguments could be formalized in a manner similar to the way Venn\ndiagrams have been formalized in Shin\n 1994.\n The co-exact information carried by Euclid\u2019s diagrams is\ndiscrete. When a diagram is consulted for this information, what\nmatters about it is how its lines and circles partition a bounded\nplanar region into a finite set of sub-regions. This opens the door to\nconceptualizing Euclid\u2019s diagrams as part of the syntax\nof Euclid\u2019s proof method. \n4.2.2 The generality problem with Euclid\u2019s constructions\n\nRealizing this conception in a formal system of proof amounts, as in\nShin\n 1994,\n to specifying the syntax and semantics of diagrams. On the syntactic\nside, this means defining Euclid\u2019s diagrams as formal objects\nprecisely, and giving rules whereby diagrams as formal object figure\nin derivations of Euclid\u2019s propositions. On the semantic side,\nthis means specifying how derivable expressions are to be interpreted\ngeometrically, or in other words how exactly are they to be understood\nas representing Euclid\u2019s propositions.\n\nThe semantic situation with Euclid\u2019s diagrams is thus different\nfrom that with Venn\u2019s. Venn diagrams are used to prove\nlogical results. The inferences made with them are topic\nneutral. Euclid\u2019s diagrams on the other hand are used to prove\ngeometrical results. The inferences made with them are topic\nspecific. In particular, though the objects of plane Euclidean\ngeometry are abstract (e.g., geometric lines are breadthless), they\nare still spatial. Consequently, issues surrounding the spatiality of\ndiagrams and representational scope do not arise with Euclid\u2019s\ndiagrams as they do, for instance, with Euler diagrams. In the case of\ngeometry, in fact, the spatiality of diagrams counts in their favor.\nSpatial constraints on what is possible with geometric configurations\nare also operative with spatial Euclidean diagrams.\n\nNevertheless, as recognized in the philosophical commentary on\nEuclid\u2019s geometry from antiquity onward, there are with\nEuclidean diagrams issues of representational scope to contend with.\nWhat is the justification for treating properties of a single\ngeometric diagram as representative of all the configurations in the\nrange of a proof? How can a single diagram prove a general result?\nManders\u2019 exact/co-exact distinction provides the basis for a\npartial answer. The co-exact properties of a diagram can be shared by\nall geometric configurations in the range of a proof, and so in such\ncases one is justified in reading off co-exact properties from the\ndiagram. In a proof about triangles for instance, variation among the\nconfigurations in the range of the proof is variation of exact\nproperties\u2014e.g., the measure of the triangles\u2019 angles, the\nratios between their sides. They all share the same co-exact\nproperties\u2014i.e., they all consists of three bounded linear\nregions which together define an area.\n\nThis is not a full answer because Euclid\u2019s proofs typically\ninvolve constructions on an initial configuration type. With the proof\nof proposition 16, for example, a construction on a triangle with one\nside extended is specified. In such cases, a diagram may adequately\nrepresent the co-exact properties of an initial configuration. But the\nresult of applying a proof\u2019s construction to the diagram cannot\nbe assumed to represent the co-exact properties of all configurations\nresulting from the construction. One does not need to consider complex\ngeometric situations to see this. Suppose for instance the initial\nconfiguration type of a proof is triangle. Then the\ndiagram\n\n\n\n\nserves to represent the co-exact properties of this type. Suppose\nfurther that the first step of a proof\u2019s construction is to drop\nthe perpendicular from a vertex of the triangle to the line containing\nthe side opposite the vertex. Then the result of carrying this step\nout on the diagram\n\n\n\n\nceases to be representative. That the perpendicular falls within the\ntriangle in the diagram is a co-exact feature of it. But there are\ntriangles with exact properties different from the initial diagram\nwhere applying the construction step results in a perpendicular lying\noutside the triangle. For example, with the triangle\n\n\n\n\nthe result of applying the construction step is\n\n\n\n\n4.3 The formal systems FG and Eu\n\nAnd so, carrying out a Euclidean construction on a representative\ndiagram can result in an unrepresentative diagram. A central task of\nformalizing Euclid\u2019s diagrammatic proofs is accounting for\nthis\u2014i.e., providing with its rules a method for distinguishing\ngeneral co-exact features from non-general ones in diagrammatic\nrepresentations of constructions. The systems FG and\nEu take two different approaches to this task. \n\nEmploying the method of FG, one must produce with a\ndiagram every case that could result from the construction. A\ngeneral co-exact relation of the construction is then one that appears\nin every case. FG\u2019s demand that every case be\nproduced would, of course, be of a little interest if it did not also\nprovide a method for producing them all. The method\nFG provides depends on the fact that lines and\ncircles in the system\u2019s diagrams are defined in purely\ntopological terms. Their resulting flexibility makes it possible to\nformulate and implement in a computer program a general method for\ngenerating\n cases.[9]\n\n\nThe lines and circles of Eu diagrams are not\nsimilarly flexible. Accordingly, it cannot resolve the generality\nproblem via case-analysis as FG does. The central\nidea of its approach is to allow diagrams to hold partial information\nfrom the outset. Within an Eu derivation, the diagram\nproduced by a proof\u2019s construction has an initial content\nconsisting in all the qualitative relations of the proof\u2019s\ninitial diagram. The qualitative relations concerning objects added by\nthe construction cannot be read off the diagram immediately. Those\nthat can be read off the diagram must be derived by the system\u2019s\n rules.[10]\n\nThe differences between the FG and\nEu approaches to formalizing Euclid\u2019s\nconstructions can be understood as representing different general\nconceptions of the role of diagrams in mathematics.\nFG embodies a conception where diagrams concretely\nrealize a range of mathematical possibilities. They support\nmathematical inference by furnishing direct access to these\npossibilities. Eu in contrast embodies a conception\nwhere diagrams serve to represent in a single symbol the various\ncomponents of a complex mathematical situation. They support\nmathematical inference by allowing the mathematical reasoner to\nconsider all these components in one place, and to focus on those\ncomponents relevant to a proof.\n5. Diagrams and Cognition, Applications\n\nDespite the formal limitations of some diagrammatic systems noted\nabove, many different systems are currently used in a wide variety of\ncontexts; logic teaching, automated reasoning, specifying computer\nprograms, reasoning about situations in physics, graphical user\ninterfaces to computer programs, and so on. In general, it is not yet\nknown how effective (in the above sense) many of these diagrammatic\nsystems are. We now give a brief survey of other diagrammatic systems\nand their uses, as well as the more philosophical issues raised by the\ndebate over the status of diagrammatic reasoning. \n5.1 Some other Diagrammatic Systems\n\nIt is worth noting that many mathematicians and philosophers proposed\ndiagrammatic systems, often with a didactic motivation. Some systems,\nlike Lewis Carroll\u2019s in \u201cThe Game of Logic\u201d\n (1896)\n are variants on the proposals of Euler and Venn. Others, like Frege\n (1879),\n used lines rather than plane regions. (For a description of\nFrege\u2019s notation, see the section on Complex Statements and\nGenerality in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.\n See also Englebretsen\n 1992.)\n Carroll\u2019s system supersedes Venn\u2019s in that the\ncomplements of sets are explicitly represented as regions of the\ndiagram, rather than being left as the background region against which\nthe circles appear. This means that Carroll\u2019s system is able to\ndraw inferences about relations between complements of properties, at\nthe expense of representing some properties as disjoint (i.e.,\nnon-connected) regions. This shift closely mirrors the shift in logic\nfrom subject-predicate argumentation to a function-argument\nrepresentation (Stenning\n 1999).\n\nPeirce, a founder of modern quantified logic, also invented a\ngraphical system, called Existential Graphs, which is logically\nequivalent to predicate logic. Along with Don Robert\u2019s\npioneering work on Existential Graphs and John Sowa\u2019s creative\napplication of Peirce\u2019s graphs, recently a group of diagrammatic\nresearchers provided more diverse approaches to Existential Graphs in\na broader theoretical context (Shin\n 2003).\n \n\nOn a more practical theme, AI researchers, one of whose main concerns\nis the heuristic power of representation systems in addition to their\nexpressive power, have been debating about different forms of\nrepresentation for decades (Sloman\n 1971,\n 1985,\n 1995).\n Hence, they have welcomed discussions of the distinct role of visual\nreasoning and have recently hosted interdisciplinary symposiums on\ndiagrammatic reasoning at AI\n conferences.[11]\n At the same time, realizing that human beings adopt different\nrepresentation forms depending on the kinds of problems they face,\nsome AI researchers and design theorists have practiced\ndomain-specific approaches to bringing in problem-tailored\nrepresentation\n forms.[12]\n\nFor instance, Harel\n (1988)\n invented higraphs to represent system specifications in computer\nscience. This idea has been taken up in industrial applications (e.g.,\nUML, in Booch et al.\n 1998).\n Barker-Plummer & Bailin\n (1997)\n present a case study in developing computers which can carry out the\nkind of analogical reasoning that humans perform when proving certain\nmathematical theorems. More recently, an interesting result has been\npresented by Mateja Jamnik of Alan Bundy\u2019s Mathematical\nReasoning Group at Edinburgh (Jamnik\n 2001).\n Jamnik shows how a semi-automatic formal proof system can perform\nsome of the perceptual inferences which humans find so natural. For\ninstance, that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is\nn squared is easily seen by decomposing an n\n\u00d7 n grid into\n\u201cells\u201d (Jamnik et al.\n 1999).\n\nScholars at the University of Brighton has been carrying out\ninteresting projects both in developing diagrammatic systems and in\napplying visual tools in software development, see the link in the\n Other Internet Resources section.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that scientists such as chemists and\nphysicists also use diagrams in order to perform certain computations.\nFeynman diagrams, for example, are used to perform calculations in\nsub-atomic physics. More recently, formal diagrammatic reasoning has\nbeen developed for quantum theory (Coecke & Kissinger\n 2017).\n In Knot Theory (which has applications in physics, Kauffman\n 1991)\n the three Reidemeister Moves are diagrammatic operations which make\nup a complete calculus for proving knots equivalent. Not surprisingly,\nKnot diagrams have attracted interest from researchers (De Toffoli\n& Giardino\n 2014).\n The crucial role of diagrams and diagrammatic reasoning in the\nabstract mathematics of category theory has also been investigated\n(Halimi\n 2012;\n De Toffoli\n 2017).\n \n5.2 Diagrams as Mental Representations\n\nDo our mental representations have diagram-like or picture-like\nentities as components? This question has a long history both in\nphilosophy and in psychology, independently of each other. More\nrecently, however, some philosophers have participated in this\n\u201cimagery debate\u201d, one of the most time-honored\ncontroversies in psychology, and some cognitive psychologists find\ncertain epistemological theories in philosophy useful to support their\nviews on the issue.\n\nThe nature of mental representation has been one of the perennial\ntopics in philosophy, and we can easily trace back philosophical\ndiscussions on images and mental representation to ancient\n times.[13]\n The writings of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume concern themselves\nin large part with mental discourse, the meaning of words, mental\nimages, particular ideas, abstract ideas, impressions, and so on.\nDescartes\u2019 well-known distinction between imagining and\nconceiving something has generated much discussion about the unique\nrole of visual images in mental representations. The development of\ncognitive science in the 20th century naturally has brought certain\ngroup of philosophers and psychologists closer and we find a number of\nauthors whose works easily belong to both disciplines (Block\n 1983;\n Dennett\n 1981;\n Fodor\n 1981).\n\nImagery based on introspection was the main focus in the early\ndevelopment of psychology until the behavioristic approach became\npredominant in the discipline. During the era of behaviorism, anything\nrelated to mental inspection, including images, was excluded from any\nserious research agenda. Finally when the topic of mental images made\na comeback in psychology in 1960s, researchers adopted a more humble\nagenda for mental imagery than before: Not all mental representations\ninvolve imagery, and imagery is one of many ways of manipulating\ninformation in the mind. Also, thanks to the influence of behaviorism,\nit is acknowledged that introspection is not enough to explore\nimagery, but a claim about mental imagery needs to be confirmable by\nexperiments in order to show that we successfully externalize mental\nevents. That is, if what a certain mental introspection tells us is\ngenuine, then there would be observable external consequences of that\nmental state.\n\nThus the contemporary imagery debate among cognitive scientists is\nabout the claim that picture-like images exist as mental\nrepresentations and about how we interpret certain\n experiments.[14]\n\nKosslyn\n (1980,\n 1994) and other pictorialists (Shepard & Metzler\n 1971)\n present experimental data to support their position that some of our\nmental images are more like pictures than a linear form of language\n(for example, natural languages or artificial symbolic languages) in\nsome important aspects, even though not all visual mental images and\npictures are of exactly the same kind. By contrast, Pylyshyn\n (1981)\n and other descriptionalists (Dennett\n 1981)\n raise questions about the picture-like status of mental images and\nargue that mental images are formed out of structured descriptions. To\nthem, mental images represent in the manner of language rather than\npictures and, hence, there are no picture-like visual mental\nimages.\n\nBoth sides of the debate sometimes used a philosophical theory as a\nsupporting factor. For example, pictorialists in the imagery debate\nfound the modern sense-datum theory in philosophy quite close to their\npoint of view. By the same token, the critics of the sense-datum\ntheory argued that the mistaken pictorial view of mental images arises\nmainly from our confusion about ordinary language and claimed that\nmental images are epiphenomena.\n5.3 The Cognitive Role of Diagrams\n\nWithout being heavily involved in the imagery debate, some researchers\nhave focused on a distinct role that diagrams or pictures\u2014as\nopposed to traditional sentential forms\u2014play in our cognitive\nactivities. (Shin\n 2015;\n Hamami & J. Mumma\n 2013)\n Based on the conjectures that humans adopt diagrammatic or spatial\ninternal mental representations in their reasoning about concrete or\nabstract situations (see Howell\n 1976;\n Sober\n 1976),\n some cognitive scientists have concentrated on the functions of\nimages or diagrams in our various cognitive activities, for example,\nmemory, imagination, perception, navigation, inference,\nproblem-solving, and so on. Here, the distinct nature of \u201cvisual\ninformation,\u201d which is obtained either through internal mental\nimages or through externally drawn diagrams, has become a major topic\nof research. Even though most of these works assume that there are\nmental images (that is, they accept the pictorialists\u2019 claim),\nstrictly speaking they do not have to commit themselves to the view\nthat these images exist as basic units in our cognition.\nDescriptionalists do not have to discard discussions of the functions\nof images, but only need to add that these images are not primitive\nunits stored in our memory, but formed out of structured descriptions\nmore like the sentences of a language (see Pylyshyn\n 1981).\n\nA search for the distinct role of diagrams has led researchers to\nexplore the differences among different forms of external or internal\nrepresentations, and mainly between diagrammatic and sentential\nrepresentations. Many important results have been produced in\ncognitive science. Starting from Larkin and Simon\u2019s classic case\nstudy\n (1987)\n to illustrate a difference between informational and computational\nequivalence among representation systems, Lindsay\u2019s work locates\nwhere this computational difference lies, which he calls a\n\u2018non-deductive\u2019 method. As briefly pointed out above, this\ninference process is called \u2018free ride\u2019 by Barwise and\nShimojiima\n (1995),\n i.e., the kind of an inference in which the conclusion seems to be\nread off automatically from the representation of premises. In Gurr,\nLee, and Stenning\n (1998)\n and Stenning and Lemon\n (2001),\n there is an explanation of the uniqueness of diagrammatic inference\nin terms of a degree of \u2018directness\u2019 of interpretation,\nand it is argued that this property is relative, and hence that\n\u201csome rides are cheaper than others\u201d. Having the role of\ngraphs in mind, Wang and Lee\n (1993)\n present a formal framework as a guideline for correct visual\nlanguages. At this point, we are very close to applied aspects of\nresearch in multi-modal reasoning\u2014design theory and AI\nresearch\u2014by providing these disciplines with computational\nsupport for visual reasoning.\n\nRelated to the issue of imagistic mental representation is the\nexamination of the semantics of various diagrammatic systems and what\nthey can teach us about the nature of languages in general (e.g.,\nGoodman\n 1968).\n For instance, Robert Cummins\n (1996),\n amongst others, argues that too little attention has been given to\ndiagrammatic representations and that focus on a notion of\n\u201cstructural representation\u201d more akin to diagrammatic\nrepresentation can help to explicate the nature of representation\nitself. We believe that the considerations presented above give us\nsome empirical handle on this type of claim at least\u2014depending\non the imagistic objects and relations used, patterns of incorrect\ninference should be predictable and detectable. An important, if\nlittle-known, article on this theme is Malinas\n 1991.\n Here Malinas explores the concepts of pictorial representation and\n\u201ctruth in\u201d a picture via the notion of resemblance, and\nconsiders various semantic puzzles about pictorial representation. He\ndevelops Peacocke\u2019s \u201cCentral Thesis\u201d of depiction\n(Peacocke\n 1987),\n where experienced similarities between properties of pictorial\nobjects and their referents in the visual field give rise to the\nrelation of depiction. He goes on to provide a formal semantics for\npictures which is \u201canalogous to a semantics for an ideal\nlanguage\u201d.\nSummary\n\nWe began by motivating the philosophical interest of diagrams, by way\nof their role in human reasoning and their relation to the study of\nlanguage in general, and multi-modal information processing. We then\nexplained the trade-off between expressive power and visual clarity of\ndiagrammatic systems, by examining the historical development of\ndiagram systems from Euler and Venn, through Peirce\u2019s work, to\nrecent work by Shin and Hammer. It was argued that diagrammatic\nsystems can be afforded the same logical status as traditional linear\nproof calculi. We then explained some of the potential pitfalls of\ndiagrammatic representation and reasoning, by examining spatial\nconstraints on diagrammatic systems and how they can affect\ncorrectness and expressive power. We closed by surveying other\ndiagrams systems, the interest in diagrams generated in computer\nscience and cognitive science, and gave an introduction to the imagery\ndebate in the philosophy of mind. \n",
