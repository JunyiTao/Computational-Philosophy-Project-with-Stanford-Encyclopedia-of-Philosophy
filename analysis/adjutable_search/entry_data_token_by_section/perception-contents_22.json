    "main_text": "Theories of Intentionality in Experience || Phenomenal Intentionality\n8.3 Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nAccording to some philosophers (e.g., Horgan and Tienson 2002; Kriegel\n2002, 2013; Siewert 1998), there is a some content of experience that\nis constitutively determined by the experience\u2019s phenomenology\nalone (Horgan and Tienson 2002, p. 524). Horgan and Tienson call this\nthesis phenomenal intentionality (See entry on\n phenomenal intentionality).\n A consequence of the thesis is that phenomenology enjoys explanatory\npriority over intentionality. Proponents of phenomenal intentionality\ntake phenomenology as a primitive notion, which cannot be reduced to\ncontent, and then try to explain (at least some kinds of) content in\nterms of it.\n\nIf the phenomenal intentionality thesis is true, then phenomenology\ncannot be reduced or identified with content, or with the having of\ncontent. The thesis thus stands in contrast to views defended by\nDretske and Tye according to which the content of experience is wholly\nexplained in causal or functional terms, where one does not need to\ninvoke phenomenology to explain why an experience has the content it\nhas. These latter views leave open the possibility that the content of\nan experience enjoys explanatory priority over its phenomenology, so\nthat one can explain phenomenology in terms of content.\n\nTogether with the assumption (made by Horgan and Tienson and by\nKriegel) that phenomenology is narrow (i.e., shared by intrinsic\nduplicates), the thesis of phenomenal intentionality yields an\ninternalist theory of experience content. This introduces\nanother respect in which phenomenal intentionality stands opposed to\nsome versions of functionalist informational theories of experience\ncontent\u2014namely, those versions that hold that the only\ncontents experiences can have are those had in virtue of the\nfunctional properties of the sort discussed in\n Section 8.2.\n If the thesis of phenomenal intentionality is true and phenomenology\nis narrow, then there are narrow contents that are constitutively\ndetermined by phenomenology. Any objections to narrow content will\nthus also apply to this thesis. For further discussion of narrow\ncontent, see the entry on\n narrow content.\n",
