    "main_text": "The Contestedness of the Rule of Law\n2. The Contestedness of the Rule of Law\n\nThe most important demand of the Rule of Law is that people in\npositions of authority should exercise their power within a\nconstraining framework of well-established public norms rather than in\nan arbitrary, ad hoc, or purely discretionary manner on the\nbasis of their own preferences or ideology. It insists that the\ngovernment should operate within a framework of law in everything it\ndoes, and that it should be accountable through law when there is a\nsuggestion of unauthorized action by those in power.\n\nBut the Rule of Law is not just about government. It requires also\nthat citizens should respect and comply with legal norms, even when\nthey disagree with them. When their interests conflict with\nothers\u2019 they should accept legal determinations of what their\nrights and duties are. Also, the law should be the same for everyone,\nso that no one is above the law, and everyone has access to the\nlaw\u2019s protection. The requirement of access is particularly\nimportant, in two senses. First, law should be epistemically\naccessible: it should be a body of norms promulgated as public\nknowledge so that people can study it, internalize it, figure out what\nit requires of them, and use it as a framework for their plans and\nexpectations and for settling their disputes with others. Secondly,\nlegal institutions and their procedures should be available to\nordinary people to uphold their rights, settle their disputes, and\nprotect them against abuses of public and private power. All of this\nin turn requires the independence of the judiciary, the accountability\nof government officials, the transparency of public business, and the\nintegrity of legal procedures. \n\nBeyond these generalities, it is controversial what the Rule of Law\nrequires. This is partly because the Rule of Law is a working\npolitical idea, as much the property of ordinary citizens, lawyers,\nactivists and politicians as of the jurists and philosophers who study\nit. The features that ordinary people call attention to are not\nnecessarily the features that legal philosophers have emphasized in\ntheir academic conceptions. Legal philosophers tend to emphasize\nformal elements of the Rule of Law such as rule by general norms\n(rather than particular decrees); rule by norms laid down in advance\n(rather than by retrospective enactments); rule by norms that are made\npublic (not hidden away in the closets of the administration); and\nrule by clear and determinate legal norms (norms whose meaning is not\nso vague or contestable as to leave those who are subject to them at\nthe mercy of official discretion). But these are not necessarily what\nordinary people have in mind when they call for the Rule of Law; they\noften have in mind the absence of corruption, the independence of the\njudiciary, and a presumption in favor of liberty. \n\nContestation about what the Rule of Law requires is partly a product\nof the fact that law itself comprises many things, and people\nprivilege different aspects of a legal system. For some the common law\nis the epitome of legality; for others, the Rule of Law connotes the\nimpartial application of a clearly drafted statute; for others still\nthe Rule of Law is epitomized by a stable constitution that has been\nembedded for centuries in the politics of a country. When Aristotle\n(Politics 1287b), contrasted the Rule of Law\nwith the rule of men, he ventured the opinion that \u201ca man may be\na safer ruler than the written law, but not safer than the customary\nlaw\u201d. In our own era, F.A. Hayek (1973: 72 ff.) has been at\npains to distinguish the rule of law from the rule of legislation,\nidentifying the former with something more like the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the common law, less constructive and less susceptible\nto deliberate control than the enactment of a statute. There is also\ncontinual debate about the relation between law and the mechanisms of\ngovernment. For some, official discretion is incompatible with the\nRule of Law; for others it depends on how the discretion is framed and\nauthorized. For some the final determination of a court amounts to the\nRule of Law; for others, aware of the politics of the judiciary, rule\nby courts (particularly a politically divided court) is as much an\ninstance of the rule of men as the decision of any other junta or\ncommittee (see Waldron 2002 for a full account of these\ncontroversies).\n\nThe fact that the Rule of Law is a controversial idea does not stop\nvarious organizations from trying to measure its application in\ndifferent societies. Groups like the World Justice Project concoct\ncriteria and indexes of the Rule of Law, ranking the nations of the\nearth in this regard. Countries like Norway and New Zealand rank at\nthe top of the Rule-of-Law league and countries like Zimbabwe and\nAfghanistan at the bottom (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The criteria can be hardly be described as rigorous. But people in\nbusiness value these rankings as part of their estimation of country\nrisk for foreign investments (see Barro 2000: 215ff.)\n",
