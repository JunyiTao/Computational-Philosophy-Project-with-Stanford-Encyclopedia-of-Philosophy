    "main_text": "\n\nCausal determinism is, roughly speaking, the idea that every event is\nnecessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the\nlaws of nature. The idea is ancient, but first became subject to\nclarification and mathematical analysis in the eighteenth century.\nDeterminism is deeply connected with our understanding of the physical\nsciences and their explanatory ambitions, on the one hand, and with\nour views about human free action on the other. In both of these\ngeneral areas there is no agreement over whether determinism is true\n(or even whether it can be known true or false), and what the import\nfor human agency would be in either case.\n",
