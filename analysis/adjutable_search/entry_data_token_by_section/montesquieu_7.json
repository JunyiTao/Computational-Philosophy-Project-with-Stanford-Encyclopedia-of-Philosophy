    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws || Commerce\n4.4 Commerce\n\n\nOf all the ways in which a country might seek to enrich itself,\nMontesquieu believes, commerce is the only one without overwhelming\ndrawbacks. Conquering and plundering one's neighbors can provide\ntemporary infusions of money, but over time the costs of maintaining\nan occupying army and administering subjugated peoples impose strains\nthat few countries can endure. Extracting precious metals from\ncolonial mines leads to general inflation; thus the costs of\nextraction increase while the value of the extracted metals\ndecreases. The increased availability of money furthers the\ndevelopment of commerce in other countries; however, in the country\nwhich extracts gold and silver, domestic industry is destroyed.\n\n Commerce, by contrast, has no such disadvantages. It does not require\nvast armies, or the continued subjugation of other peoples. It does\nnot undermine itself, as the extraction of gold from colonial mines\ndoes, and it rewards domestic industry. It therefore sustains itself,\nand nations which engage in it, over time. While it does not produce\nall the virtues -- hospitality, Montesquieu thinks, is more often\nfound among the poor than among commercial peoples -- it does produce\nsome: \"the spirit of commerce is naturally attended with that of\nfrugality, economy, moderation, labor, prudence, tranquility, order,\nand rule\" (SL 5.6). In addition, it \"is a cure for the most\ndestructive prejudices\" (SL 20.1), improves manners, and leads to\npeace among nations.\n\n In monarchies, Montesquieu believes, the aim of commerce is, for the\nmost part, to supply luxuries. In republics, it is to bring from one\ncountry what is wanted in another, \"gaining little\" but \"gaining\nincessantly\" (SL 20.4). In despotisms, there is very little commerce\nof any kind, since there is no security of property. In a monarchy,\nneither kings nor nobles should engage in commerce, since this would\nrisk concentrating too much power in their hands. By the same token,\nthere should be no banks in a monarchy, since a treasure \"no sooner\nbecomes great than it becomes the treasure of the prince\" (SL 20.10).\nIn republics, by contrast, banks are extremely useful, and anyone\nshould be allowed to engage in trade. Restrictions on which profession\na person can follow destroy people's hopes of bettering their\nsituation; they are therefore appropriate only to despotic states.\n\n While some mercantilists had argued that commerce is a zero-sum game\nin which when some gain, others necessarily lose, Montesquieu believes\nthat commerce benefits all countries except those who have nothing but\ntheir land and what it produces. In those deeply impoverished\ncountries, commerce with other countries will encourage those who own\nthe land to oppress those who work it, rather than encouraging the\ndevelopment of domestic industries and manufacture. However, all other\ncountries benefit by commerce, and should seek to trade with as many\nother nations as possible, \"for it is competition which sets a just\nvalue on merchandise, and establishes the relation between them\" (SL\n20.9).\n\n Montesquieu describes commerce as an activity that cannot be confined\nor controlled by any individual government or monarch. This, in his\nview, has always been true: \"Commerce is sometimes destroyed by\nconquerors, sometimes cramped by monarchs; it traverses the earth,\nflies from the places where it is oppressed, and stays where it has\nliberty to breathe\" (SL 21.5). However, the independence of commerce\nwas greatly enhanced when, during the medieval period, Jews responded\nto persecution and the seizure of their property by inventing letters\nof exchange. \"Commerce, by this method, became capable of eluding\nviolence, and of maintaining everywhere its ground; the richest\nmerchant having none but invisible effects, which he could convey\nimperceptibly wherever he pleased\" (SL 21.20). This set in motion\ndevelopments which made commerce still more independent of monarchs\nand their whims.\n\n First, it facilitated the development of international markets, which\nplace prices outside the control of governments. Money, according to\nMontesquieu, is \"a sign which represents the value of all\nmerchandise\" (SL 22.2). The price of merchandise depends on the\nquantity of money and the quantity of merchandise, and on the amounts\nof money and merchandise that are in trade. Monarchs can affect this\nprice by imposing tariffs or duties on certain goods. But since they\ncannot control the amounts of money and merchandise that are in trade\nwithin their own countries, let alone internationally, a monarch \"can\nno more fix the price of merchandise than he can establish by a decree\nthat the relation 1 has to 10 is equal to that of 1 to 20\" (SL 22.7).\nIf a monarch attempts to do so, he courts disaster: \"Julian's lowering\nthe price of provisions at Antioch was the cause of a most terrible\nfamine\" (SL 22.7).\n\n Second, it permitted the development of international currency\nexchanges, which place the exchange rate of a country's currency\nlargely outside the control of that country's government. A monarch\ncan establish a currency, and stipulate how much of some metal each\nunit of that currency shall contain. However, monarchs cannot control\nthe rates of exchange between their currencies and those of other\ncountries. These rates depend on the relative scarcity of money in the\ncountries in question, and they are \"fixed by the general opinion of\nthe merchants, never by the decrees of the prince\" (SL 22.10). For\nthis reason \"the exchange of all places constantly tends to a certain\nproportion, and that in the very nature of things\" (SL 22.10).\n\n Finally, the development of international commerce gives governments\na great incentive to adopt policies that favor, or at least do not\nimpede, its development. Governments need to maintain confidence in\ntheir creditworthiness if they wish to borrow money; this deters them\nfrom at least the more extreme forms of fiscal irresponsibility, and\nfrom oppressing too greatly those citizens from whom they might later\nneed to borrow money. Since the development of commerce requires the\navailability of loans, governments must establish interest rates high\nenough to encourage lending, but not so high as to make borrowing\nunprofitable. Taxes must not be so high that they deprive citizens of\nthe hope of bettering their situations (SL 13.2), and the laws should\nallow those citizens enough freedom to carry out commercial affairs.\n\n In general, Montesquieu believes that commerce has had an extremely\nbeneficial influence on government. Since commerce began to recover\nafter the development of letters of exchange and the reintroduction of\nlending at interest, he writes:\n it became necessary that princes\nshould govern with more prudence than they themselves could ever have\nimagined; for great exertions of authority were, in the event, found\nto be impolitic ... We begin to be cured of Machiavelism, and recover\nfrom it every day. More moderation has become necessary in the\ncouncils of princes. What would formerly have been called a\nmaster-stroke in politics would be now, independent of the horror it\nmight occasion, the greatest imprudence. Happy is it for men that they\nare in a situation in which, though their passions prompt them to be\nwicked, it is, nevertheless, to their interest to be humane and\nvirtuous. (SL 21.20) \n",
