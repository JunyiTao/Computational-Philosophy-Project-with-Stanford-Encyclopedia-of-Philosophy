    "main_text": "\n\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694\u20131746) was an influential British\nmoralist, an advocate of moral sentimentalism, and a key figure of the\nScottish Enlightenment. While Hutcheson was educated, and completed\nhis career, at the University of Glasgow, he was Irish by birth, and\nreturned to Scotland only after his major writings (including the\nInquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue,\nthe Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, with\nIllustrations on the Moral Sense) had been published, and in some\ncases extensively revised. Nevertheless, he had a tremendous influence\non the Scottish intellectual scene, in part due to his interactions\nwith important Scottish figures of the day, including Adam Smith,\nThomas Reid, and David Hume.\n\nLeaving aside his influence on the Scottish enlightenment,\nHutcheson\u2019s contribution to the broader development of modern\nBritish moralism cannot be overstated. His chief philosophical\ncontributions, upon which this entry will concentrate, include his\naforementioned sentimentalism, his complex moral\npsychology, his proto-utilitarianism, his critique of\nself-interest theorists (such as Hobbes and Mandeville), his\ncritique of rationalists (such as Clarke and Wollaston), and\nhis attempted reconciliation of virtue and self-interest.\n\nOne brief note. Though this entry will concentrate on\nHutcheson\u2019s contributions to moral philosophy, Hutcheson also\noffers views on the nature of human perception (broadly derived from\nLocke\u2019s Essay), first- and second-order theories of\naesthetics (see Kivy 1976 [2003]), logic (Hutcheson 1756),\nassociationism about human cognition (cf. Gill 1995, 1996; Kallich\n1946), religion (Elton 2008; Harris 2008), and many other topics that\nmust be foregone for lack of space.\n\nThis entry will proceed in two stages, the first focusing on\nHutcheson\u2019s metaethics, including his sentimentalism and moral\npsychology; the second concentrating on his normative ethics,\nincluding his anticipation of some strains in utilitarian thought, and\nhis argument that virtue and self-interest are aligned.\n",
