    "main_text": "Interpreting the formalism || A nonsupervenient interpretation of the formalism\n4.6 A nonsupervenient interpretation of the formalism\n\nWe note an alternative interpretation of the revision-theoretic\nformalism. Yaq\u016bb 1993 agrees with Gupta and Belnap that the\nT-biconditionals are definitional rather than material biconditionals,\nand that the concept of truth is therefore circular. But Yaq\u016bb\ninterprets this circularity in a distinctive way. He argues that,\n\nsince the truth conditions of some sentences involve reference to\ntruth in an essential, irreducible manner, these conditions can only\nobtain or fail in a world that already includes an extension of the\ntruth predicate. Hence, in order for the revision process to determine\nan extension of the truth predicate, an initial extension of\nthe predicate must be posited. This much follows from circularity and\nbivalence. (1993, 40)\n\n\nLike Gupta and Belnap, Yaq\u016bb posits no privileged extension for\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). And like Gupta and Belnap, he sees the revision\nsequences of extensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\), each sequence generated\nby an initial hypothesized extension, as \u201ccapable of\naccommodating (and diagnosing) the various kinds of problematic and\nunproblematic sentences of the languages under consideration\u201d\n(1993, 41). But, unlike Gupta and Belnap, he concludes from these\nconsiderations that \u201ctruth in a bivalent language is not\nsupervenient\u201d (1993, 39). He explains in a footnote: for\ntruth to be supervenient, the truth status of each sentence must be\n\u201cfully determined by nonsemantical facts\u201d. Yaq\u016bb does\nnot explicitly use the notion of a concept\u2019s\nsignification. But Yaq\u016bb seems committed to the claim\nthat the signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) \u2014 i.e., that which\ndetermines the truth status of each sentence \u2014 is given by a\nparticular revision sequence itself. And no revision sequence is\ndetermined by the nonsemantical facts, i.e., by the ground model,\nalone: a revision sequence is determined, at best, by a ground model\nand an initial\n hypothesis.[10]\n",
