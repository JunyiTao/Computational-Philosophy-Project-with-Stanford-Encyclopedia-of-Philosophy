    "main_text": "The Lead-up to the Debate || Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity\n2.1 Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s intended his theory to replace Newton\u2019s theory\nof gravitation completely. In Einstein\u2019s view, gravity was not a\nforce existing independently of the spatial \u2018container\u2019;\nrather, gravitation arises as a curvature of the space (and time,\nwhich is necessarily connected to space in the new theory), which\nmeans that geometry and gravity and astronomical behavior are all\nintimately connected. For example, near the sun the geometrical\nstructure, the curvature, of spacetime changes radically, which\nexpresses itself as an increasing velocity of incoming orbiting bodies\nsuch as comets or satellites. One immediate, and to some, puzzling,\nconsequence of Einstein\u2019s theory is that the geometry of the\nUniverse is no longer taken to be Euclidean. Although there are\nseveral different candidates for the actual geometry of space, it was\nnot known which is correct.\n\nIt was not recognized at first that the General Theory of Relativity\ncould be applied to the Universe as a single, whole, individual\nobject, thereby producing a new cosmological theory, one completely\ndifferent from its predecessors. Although the mathematics involved are\nextremely difficult, two solutions, one by Einstein himself, the other\nby the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter, were produced in just a\nshort time in 1917. Unfortunately, the universes predicted by the two\nsolutions were extreme: Einstein\u2019s universe would be densely\npacked with matter, whereas de Sitter\u2019s would be essentially\nempty.\n\nObviously, the universe as observed by astronomers did not conform at\nall to the description provided by either solution, a fact many found\ntroubling. Moreover, no additional solutions were forthcoming (even\nthough both Friedmann and LeMa\u00eetre had developed alternatives,\nthey remained unknown and unnoticed). For nearly twelve years, the new\ncosmology appeared to be going nowhere. Then Hubble at\nCalifornia\u2019s Mt. Palomar made public his astonishing\nobservations of a cosmic Doppler shift, a shift toward the red in the\ncolor of light coming from the most distant star systems.\n",
