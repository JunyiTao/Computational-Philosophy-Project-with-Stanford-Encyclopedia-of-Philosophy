    "main_text": "The 1936 Thesis and its Context || Church\u2019s thesis\n1.5 Church\u2019s thesis\n\nWhere Turing used the term \u201cpurely mechanical\u201d, Church\nused \u201ceffectively calculable\u201d to indicate that there is an\neffective method for obtaining the values of the function; and where\nTuring offered an analysis in terms of computability by an L.C.M.,\nChurch gave two alternative analyses, one in terms of the concept of\nrecursion and the other in terms of\nlambda-definability (\u03bb-definability). He proposed that\nwe\n\n\ndefine the notion \u2026 of an effectively calculable function of\npositive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive\nfunction of positive integers (or of a \u03bb-definable function of\npositive integers). (Church 1936a: 356)\n\n\nThe concept of a \u03bb-definable function was due to Church and\nKleene, with contributions also by Rosser (Church 1932, 1933, 1935c,\n1936a; Church & Rosser 1936; Kleene 1934, 1935a,b, 1936a,b; Kleene\n& Rosser 1935; Rosser 1935a,b). A function is said to be\n\u03bb-definable if the values of the function can be obtained by a\ncertain process of repeated substitution. The concept of a recursive\nfunction had emerged over time through the work of, among others,\nGrassmann, Peirce, Dedekind, Peano, Skolem, Hilbert\u2014and his\n\u201cassistants\u201d Ackermann and Bernays\u2014Sudan,\nP\u00e9ter (n\u00e9e Politzer), Herbrand, Kleene, and\npre-eminently G\u00f6del (G\u00f6del 1931, 1934). The class of\n\u03bb-definable functions (of positive integers) and the class of\nrecursive functions (of positive integers) are identical; this was\nproved by Church and Kleene (Church 1936a; Kleene 1936a,b).\n\nWhen Turing learned of Church\u2019s 1936 proposal to identify\neffectiveness with \u03bb-definability (while preparing his own\npaper for publication), he quickly established that the concept of\n\u03bb-definability and his concept of computability are equivalent\n(by proving the \u201ctheorem that all \u2026 \u03bb-definable\nsequences \u2026 are computable\u201d and its converse; Turing 1936\n[2004: 88ff]). Thus, in Church\u2019s proposal, the words\n\u201c\u03bb-definable function of positive integers\u201d (and\nequally the words \u201crecursive function of positive\nintegers\u201d) can be replaced by \u201cfunction of positive\nintegers that is computable by Turing machine\u201d. What Turing\nproved is called an equivalence result. There is further\ndiscussion of equivalence results in\n Section 4.1.\n\nPost referred to Church\u2019s identification of effective\ncalculability with recursiveness and \u03bb-definability as a\n\u201cworking hypothesis\u201d, and he quite properly criticized\nChurch for masking this hypothesis as a definition:\n\n\n[T]o mask this identification under a definition \u2026 blinds us to\nthe need of its continual verification. (Post 1936: 105)\n\n\nThis, then, is the \u201cworking hypothesis\u201d that, in effect,\nChurch proposed:\n\n\nChurch\u2019s thesis:\n\nA function of positive integers is effectively calculable only if\n\u03bb-definable (or, equivalently, recursive).\n\n\nThe reverse implication, that every \u03bb-definable function of\npositive integers is effectively calculable, is commonly referred to\nas the converse of Church\u2019s thesis, although Church\nhimself did not so distinguish (bundling both theses together in his\n\u201cdefinition\u201d).\n\nIf attention is restricted to functions of positive integers,\nChurch\u2019s thesis and Turing\u2019s thesis are\nextensionally equivalent. \u201cExtensionally\nequivalent\u201d means that the two theses are about one and the same\nclass of functions: In view of the previously mentioned results by\nChurch, Kleene and Turing, the class of \u03bb-definable functions\n(of positive integers) is identical to the class of recursive\nfunctions (of positive integers) and to the class of computable\nfunctions (of positive integers). Notice, though, that while the two\ntheses are equivalent in this sense, they nevertheless have distinct\nmeanings and so are two different theses. One\nimportant difference between the two is that Turing\u2019s thesis\nconcerns computing machines, whereas Church\u2019s does\nnot.\n\nConcerning the origin of the terms \u201cChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d\nand \u201cTuring\u2019s thesis\u201d, Kleene seems to have been the\nfirst to use the word \u201cthesis\u201d in this connection: In\n1952, he introduced the name \u201cChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d for\nthe proposition that every effectively calculable function (on the\nnatural numbers) is recursive (Kleene 1952: 300, 301, 317). The term\n\u201cChurch-Turing thesis\u201d also seems to have originated with\nKleene\u2014with a flourish of bias in favor of his mentor\nChurch:\n\n\nSo Turing\u2019s and Church\u2019s theses are equivalent. We shall\nusually refer to them both as Church\u2019s thesis, or in\nconnection with that one of its \u2026 versions which deals with\n\u201cTuring machines\u201d as the Church-Turing thesis.\n(Kleene 1967: 232)\n\n\nSome prefer the name Turing-Church thesis.\n",
