    "main_text": "The Origins of Population Genetics\n1. The Origins of Population Genetics\n\nTo understand how population genetics came into being, and to\nappreciate its intellectual significance, a brief excursion into the\nhistory of biology is necessary. Darwin\u2019s Origin of\nSpecies, published in 1859, propounded two main theses: firstly,\nthat modern species were descended from common ancestors, and secondly\nthat the process of natural selection was the major mechanism of\nevolutionary change. The first thesis quickly won acceptance in the\nscientific community, but the second did not. Many people found it\ndifficult to accept that natural selection could play the explanatory\nrole required of it by Darwin\u2019s theory. This\nsituation\u2014accepting that evolution had happened but doubting\nDarwin\u2019s account of what had caused it to happen\u2014persisted\nwell into the twentieth century (Bowler 1988).\n\nOpposition to natural selection was understandable, for Darwin\u2019s\ntheory, though compelling, contained a major lacuna: an account of the\nmechanism of inheritance. For evolution by natural selection to occur,\nit is necessary that parents should tend to resemble their offspring;\notherwise, fitness-enhancing traits will have no tendency to spread\nthrough a population. In the Origin, Darwin rested his\nargument on the observed fact that offspring do tend to\nresemble their parents\u2014\u2018the strong principle of\ninheritance\u2019\u2014while admitting that he did not know why this\nwas. Darwin did later attempt an explicit theory of inheritance, based\non hypothetical entities called \u2018gemmules\u2019, but it turned\nout to have no basis in fact.\n\nDarwin was troubled by not having a proper understanding of the\ninheritance mechanism, for it left him unable to rebut a powerful\nobjection to his theory. For a population to evolve by natural\nselection, the members of the population must vary\u2014if all\norganisms are identical, no selection can occur. So for selection to\ngradually modify a population over a long period of time, in the\nmanner suggested by Darwin, a continual supply of variation is needed.\nFleeming Jenkin argued that the available variation would be used up\ntoo fast (Jenkin 1867). His reasoning assumed a \u2018blending\u2019\ntheory of inheritance, i.e., that an offspring\u2019s phenotypic\ntraits are a \u2018blend\u2019 of those of its parents. (So for\nexample, if a short and a tall organism mate, the height of the\noffspring will be intermediate between the two.) Jenkin argued that\ngiven blending inheritance, a sexually reproducing population will\nbecome phenotypically homogenous in just a few generations, far\nshorter than the number of generations needed for natural selection to\nproduce complex adaptations.\n\nFortunately for Darwin\u2019s theory, inheritance does not actually\nwork the way Jenkin thought. The type of inheritance that we call\n\u2018Mendelian\u2019, after Gregor Mendel, is\n\u2018particulate\u2019 rather than\n\u2018blending\u2019\u2014offspring inherit discrete hereditary\nparticles (genes) from their parents, which means that sexual\nreproduction does not diminish the heritable variation present in the\npopulation. (See section 2, \u2018The Hardy-Weinberg\nPrinciple\u2019.) However this realisation took a long time to come,\nfor two reasons. Firstly, Mendel\u2019s work was overlooked by the\nscientific community for forty years. Secondly, even after the\nrediscovery of Mendel\u2019s work at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, it was widely believed that Darwinian evolution and Mendelian\ninheritance were incompatible. The early Mendelians did not accept\nthat natural selection played an important role in evolution, so were\nnot well placed to see that Mendel had given Darwin\u2019s theory the\nlifeline it needed. The synthesis of Darwinism and Mendelism, which\nmarked the birth of population genetics, was achieved by a long and\ntortuous route (Provine 1971).\n\nThe key ideas behind Mendel\u2019s theory of inheritance are\nstraightforward. In his experimental work on pea plants, Mendel\nobserved an unusual phenomenon. He began with two \u2018pure\nbreeding\u2019 lines, one producing plants with round seeds, the\nother wrinkled seeds. He then crossed these to produce the first\ndaughter generation (the F1 generation). The F1 plants all had round\nseeds\u2014the wrinkled trait had disappeared from the population.\nMendel then crossed the F1 plants with each other to produce the F2\ngeneration. Strikingly, approximately one quarter of the F2 plants had\nwrinkled seeds. So the wrinkled trait had made a comeback, skipping a\ngeneration.\n\nThese and similar observations were explained by Mendel as follows. He\nhypothesised that each plant contains a pair of \u2018factors\u2019\nthat together determine some aspect of its phenotype\u2014in this\ncase, seed shape. A plant inherits one factor from each of its\nparents. Suppose that there is one factor for round seeds\n\\((R)\\), another for wrinkled seeds \\((W)\\). There are then\nthree possible types of plant: \\(RR,\\) \\(RW\\) and\n\\(WW\\). An \\(RR\\) plant will have round seeds, a \\(WW\\)\nplant wrinkled seeds. What about an \\(RW\\) plant? Mendel\nsuggested that it would have round seeds\u2014the \\(R\\) factor\nis \u2018dominant\u2019 over the \\(W\\) factor. The observations\ncould then be easily explained. The initial pure-breeding lines were\n\\(RR\\) and \\(WW\\). The F1 plants were formed by \\(RR \\times WW\\) crosses, so were all of the \\(RW\\) type and\nthus had round seeds. The F2 plants were formed by \\(RW \\times RW\\) crosses, so contained a mixture of the \\(RR,\nRW\\) and \\(WW\\) types. If we assume that each \\(RW\\)\nparent transmits the \\(R\\) and \\(W\\) factors to its\noffspring with equal probability, then the F2 plants would contain\n\\(RR, RW\\) and \\(WW\\) in approximately the ratio\n1:2:1. (This assumption is known as Mendel\u2019s First Law\nor The Law of Segregation.) Since \\(RR\\) and \\(RW\\)\nboth have round seeds, this explains why three quarters of the F2\nplants had round seeds, one quarter wrinkled seeds.\n\nOur understanding of heredity today is vastly more sophisticated than\nMendel\u2019s, but the key elements of Mendel\u2019s\ntheory\u2014discrete hereditary particles that come in different\ntypes, dominance and recessiveness, and the law of\nsegregation\u2014have turned out to be essentially correct.\nMendel\u2019s \u2018factors\u2019 are the genes of population\ngenetics, and the alternative forms that a factor can take (e.g.,\n\\(R\\) versus \\(W\\) in the pea plant example) are known as\nthe alleles of a gene. The law of segregation is explained by\nthe fact that during gametogenesis, each gamete (sex cell) receives\nonly one of each chromosome pair from its parent organism. Other\naspects of Mendel\u2019s theory have been modified in the light of\nlater discoveries. Mendel thought that most phenotypic traits were\ncontrolled by a single pair of factors, like seed shape in his pea\nplants, but it is now known that most traits are affected by many\npairs of genes, not just one. Mendel believed that the pairs of\nfactors responsible for different traits (e.g., seed shape and flower\ncolour) segregated independently of each other, but we now know that\nthis need not be so (see section 3.5, \u2018Two-Locus Models and\nLinkage\u2019, below). Despite these points, Mendel\u2019s theory\nmarks a turning point in our understanding of inheritance.\n\nThe rediscovery of Mendel\u2019s work in 1900 did not lead the\nscientific community to be converted to Mendelism overnight. The\ndominant approach to the study of heredity at the time was biometry,\nspearheaded by Karl Pearson in London, which involved statistical\nanalysis of the phenotypic variation found in natural populations.\nBiometricians were mainly interested in continuously varying traits\nsuch as height, rather than the \u2018discrete\u2019 traits such as\nseed shape that Mendel studied, and were generally believers in\nDarwinian gradualism. Opposed to the biometricians were the\nMendelians, spearheaded by William Bateson, who emphasized\ndiscontinuous variation, and believed that major adaptive change could\nbe produced by single mutational steps, rather than by cumulative\nnatural selection \u00e0 la Darwin. A heated controversy between the\nbiometricians and the Mendelians ensued. As a result, Mendelian\ninheritance came to be associated with an anti-Darwinian view of\nevolution.\n\nPopulation genetics arose in part from the need to reconcile Mendel\nwith Darwin, a need which became increasingly urgent as the empirical\nevidence for Mendelian inheritance began to pile up. A significant\nmilestone was R.A. Fisher\u2019s 1918 paper, \u2018The Correlation\nbetween Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\u2019,\nwhich showed how the biometrical and Mendelian research traditions\ncould be unified. Fisher demonstrated that if a given continuous\ntrait, e.g., height, was affected by a large number of Mendelian\nfactors, each of which made a small difference to the trait, then the\ntrait would show an approximately normal distribution in a population.\nSince the Darwinian process was widely believed to work best on\ncontinuously varying traits, showing that the distribution of such\ntraits was compatible with Mendelism was an important step towards\nreconciling Darwin with Mendel.\n\nThe full reconciliation was achieved in the 1920s and early 30s,\nthanks to the mathematical work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright (Fisher\n1930, Haldane 1930\u201332, Wright 1931). These theorists developed\nformal models to explore how natural selection, and other evolutionary\nfactors such as mutation and random drift, would modify the genetic\ncomposition of a Mendelian population over time. This work marked a\nmajor step forward in evolutionary biology, for it enabled the\nconsequences of various evolutionary hypotheses to be explored\nquantitatively rather than just qualitatively. Verbal arguments about\nwhat natural selection could or could not achieve, or about the\npatterns of genetic variation to which it would give rise, were\nreplaced with explicit mathematical arguments. The strategy of\ndevising formal models to shed light on the evolutionary process\nremains the dominant methodology of population genetics today, though\nunlike in the 1930s, today\u2019s modellers have a wealth of\nempirical data against which to test their predictions (Hartl\n2020).\n\nFisher and Haldane were both strong Darwinians\u2014they believed\nthat natural selection was the most important factor affecting a\npopulation\u2019s genetic composition. Wright did not downplay the\nrole of natural selection, but he believed that chance also played a\ncrucial role, as did migration between the constituent sub-populations\nof a species (See sections 4, \u2018Random Drift\u2019, and 3.3,\n\u2018Migration\u2019.) The respective roles of natural selection\nand chance (or random drift) in shaping genetic variation, both within\nand between species, became a major theme in population genetics, and\nis still a live issue today. The issue lay at the heart of the\n\u201cneutralist versus selectionist\u201d controversy of the 1960s\nand 1970. The neutralists, led by Motoo Kimura, argued that much of\nthe molecular genetic variation found in natural populations was\nlikely to be neutral, i.e., the different genetic variants at a given\nlocus were mostly selectively equivalent (Kimura 1977, 1994). If true,\nthis suggests a significant role for random drift. Though initially\ncontroversial, the idea of abundant neutral variation in DNA sequence\nis today quite standard (Jensen et al. 2019); though this is fully\ncompatible with natural selection playing the major role in\nadaptive evolution (Kern and Hahn 2018).\n\nContemporary population genetics takes place in a very different\nscientific landscape to the one inhabited by Fisher, Haldane and\nWright. They were working in the pre-molecular biology era, when the\n\u201cgene\u201d was a purely theoretical entity, posited to explain\nobserved patterns of inheritance, but whose structure and molecular\ncomposition were unknown. Genetic variation could thus only be\nobserved indirectly, though the phenotypic variation to which it\n(sometimes) gave rise. This meant that there was very little empirical\ndata against which population genetic models could be tested; so the\nenterprise remained an essentially theoretical one. In the intervening\ncentury, the gene has gone from being a theoretical posit to being an\nentity whose molecular structure and functioning is understood in\ngreat detail. Since the 1980s, the technology for gene sequencing,\ni.e., determining the sequence of nucleotide bases in a length of DNA,\nhas become increasingly fast and cheap. This has allowed population\ngeneticists to directly study the genetic variation found in natural\npopulations, by sampling a number of individuals and sequencing a gene\nof interest (or in some cases the whole genome). As a result,\npopulation genetics is now a \u201cdata rich\u201d science, the\npolar opposite of the situation when the field was founded. Despite\nthis, many of the models, techniques and conclusions provided by the\nearlier theoretical work remain directly relevant today (Charlesworth\nand Charlesworth 2017).\n",
