    "main_text": "The \u201cElementary Philosophy\u201d\n2. The \u201cElementary Philosophy\u201d\n\nNo sooner did he begin lecturing on the first Critique than\nReinhold began to have serious doubts about the completeness of\nKant\u2019s philosophy, the soundness of its theoretical foundations,\nand the adequacy of Kant\u2019s own arguments and deductions. With\nremarkable alacrity and considerable ingenuity, he took it upon\nhimself to remedy these perceived defects in Kant\u2019s own\npresentation and to construct his own, allegedly more systematic,\nwell-grounded, and \u201cuniversally acceptable\u201d version of the\nnew Critical philosophy.\n\nThough Reinhold sometimes referred to his new system simply as\n\u201cphilosophy without a nickname,\u201d it soon became known by\nanother name that he used for it, namely: \u201cElementary\nPhilosophy\u201d or \u201cPhilosophy of the Elements\u201d\n[Elementarphilosophie]. After introducing his new\nphilosophical ideas in his own lectures, Reinhold began laying them\nbefore the public in a series of essays in popular and professional\njournals, essays which were then revised and expanded as chapters of\nthe three books which together constitute his \u201cofficial\u201d\nexposition of the Elementary Philosophy: Versuch einer neuen\nTheorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsverm\u00f6gens (1789),\nBeytr\u00e4ge zur Berichtigung bisheriger Missverst\u00e4ndnisse\nder Philosophen, Erster Band (1790), and Ueber das\nFundament des philosophischen Wissens (1791).\n\nReinhold introduced his presentation of the Elementary Philosophy with\nthe following \u201cmetaphilosophical\u201d questions: How is\nphilosophy possible as a strict science, and what is the\ndistinguishing feature of such a science? Following Kant, as well as\nthe entire rationalist tradition, Reinhold maintained that the essence\nof science lies in universality and necessity. But these are\nproperties of thought, not of sensation or intuition. Only through\nthinking and judging can we recognize universality and necessity, a\nrecognition that is, in turn, formulated and expressed in concepts and\npropositions. The business of philosophy is therefore to establish\n\u201cuniversally valid\u201d [allgemeing\u00fcltig]\npropositions in a manner that allows their necessity and universality\nto be universally recognized as binding upon everyone\n[allgemeingeltend]. This last requirement reveals the\nintimate link between Reinhold\u2019s earlier efforts at\n\u201cpopularizing\u201d the Kantian philosophy and his subsequent\nefforts to expand and to ground this same system. One of the constant\nhallmarks of Reinhold\u2019s philosophical efforts was his conviction\nthat a genuinely scientific philosophy must be capable of being\nunderstood and recognized as true by everyone.\n\nWhat makes philosophy \u201cscientific,\u201d according to Reinhold,\nis not simply that it consists of propositions arrived at by thinking,\nbut rather, the logical connection between the propositions in\nquestion\u2014that is, their systematic form. Over and over\nagain, in one forum after another, Reinhold trumpeted the same\ndeclaration: scientific philosophy is systematic philosophy.\nAccordingly, he embarked upon an influential analysis of systematic\nform as such, in order to gain insight into how Kantianism could be\nmade rigorously systematic and therefore genuinely\n\u201cscientific.\u201d\n\nThe fundamental hallmarks of systematic form, according to Reinhold,\nare consistency and completeness, but it was the former of these that\nattracted most of Reinhold\u2019s attention. The only way to be sure\nthat any two propositions are truly consistent with one\nanother\u2014and hence, the only way to determine whether a number of\nphilosophical propositions actually constitute a\n\u201csystem\u201d\u2014is to show that they can all be traced back\nto the same first principle or foundation [Grundsatz]. And\nthe only way to show that they can indeed be \u201ctraced back\u201d\nto such a first principle is by actually \u201cderiving\u201d them\ntherefrom. (Despite his efforts to clarify this point,\nReinhold\u2019s conception of philosophical\n\u201cderivation\u201d\u2014which is apparently not to be\nunderstood as simple logical deduction\u2014nevertheless remains\nextraordinarily murky.)\n\nIt follows that a philosophical system must begin with a single first\nprinciple, which \u201cdetermines\u201d all the other propositions\nof the system. (Here again, there is a certain obscurity in\nReinhold\u2019s claim, inasmuch as he insisted that the first\nprinciple \u201cdetermines\u201d only the \u201cform\u201d and not\nthe \u201ccontent\u201d of all the other, subordinate propositions,\nyet he also described the relationship between the first principle and\nthe subordinate principles as a \u201csyllogism,\u201d in which the\nlatter are \u201cderived\u201d from the former.) Only if\npropositions are logically related to one another in this manner can\nthey constitute a \u201csystem.\u201d A system with two or more\n\u201cfirst principles\u201d is not a system at all, but several\ndifferent systems. As for the completeness problem, Reinhold\u2019s\nimplicit solution seems to have been to seek an a priori first\nprinciple that could be known in advance to encompass the entire\ndomain of experience, and hence of philosophy.\n\nWhat, however, can one say about the truth (or, as Reinhold was more\nlikely to say, the \u201cvalidity\u201d [G\u00fcltigkeit])\nof the proposed first principle itself? If the validity of a\nphilosophical proposition is determined by its systematic, logical\nconnection to other propositions, then what determines the truth of\nthe first principle, from which the system as a whole is generated or\nderived? The answer, Reinhold thought, is obvious: the first principle\nand systematic starting point of philosophy must be\nself-evident. It must be immediately certain.\n\nDespite reservations concerning the capacity of the first principle to\ndetermine the content, as opposed to the form, of the propositions\nderived from it, Reinhold unequivocally maintained that the first\nprinciple of all philosophy had to be a material as well as a formal\nprinciple. Otherwise, \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d would be\nidentical to formal logic and would have no content of its own, which\nReinhold (at this point anyway) staunchly denied. Moreover, according\nto Reinhold, the establishment of such a universally valid and\nimmediately certain first principle is not merely a pressing\nrequirement of theoretical reason, but also a matter of the utmost\npractical urgency, inasmuch as in the absence of such a foundational\nfirst principle \u201cphilosophy itself is impossible as a science,\nin which case the basis for our ethical duties and rights \u2014 as\nwell as those duties and rights themselves\u2014must remain forever\nundecided\u201d (Beytr\u00e4ge I, p. 367; 2003: 248).\n\nGranted, then, that a system of philosophy must begin with a single,\nimmediately certain, synthetic first proposition or \u201cgrounding\nprinciple\u201d: where might one turn in order to discover and to\nrecognize the first principle in question, a proposition that alone\ncan serve as the foundation or \u201cground\u201d of all other\nphilosophical propositions and cannot itself be established by any\nargument? The answer is, we must turn within\u2014to the\nconsideration of consciousness itself. This, Reinhold maintained, is\nprecisely what Kant (not to mention Descartes) had done, albeit he did\nnot succeed in presenting the fruits of his inquiries in an adequately\nscientific and systematic form.\n\nWhat then is the \u201cfirst principle\u201d of the Elementary\nPhilosophy? It is the \u201cPrinciple of Consciousness,\u201d\nnamely, the proposition that \u201cin consciousness, the subject\ndistinguishes the representation from the subject and the object and\nrelates the representation to both\u201d (Beytr\u00e4ge I,\np. 167; 2003: 113). In this proposition, the term\n\u201crepresentation\u201d [Vorstellung] designates the\nbasic synthetic unity between subject and object, which is\nconstitutive of consciousness; the term \u201csubject\u201d\ndesignates the one who \u201cis conscious\u201d of whatever one is\nconscious of (the \u201cconscious subject\u201d or \u201csubject of\nconsciousness\u201d); and the term \u201cobject\u201d designates\nthat \u201cof which\u201d the representation is a representation.\nReinhold distinguishes between three senses of \u201cobject\u201d:\nobject as thing [Ding], that to which the\nrepresentation refers; object as represented\n[Vorgestelltes], the intentional object of the\nrepresentation; object as thing in itself [Ding an sich],\ni.e. considered in abstraction from the representation\n(Beytr\u00e4ge I, p. 171; 2003: 116).\n\nThough \u201cself-evident\u201d and \u201cuniversally valid,\u201d\nthe proposition asserting this tripartite character of consciousness\nis, according to Reinhold, not analytic but synthetic. The Principle\nof Consciousness is not a tautology, yet anyone who reflects upon what\nis asserted by this principle will immediately recognize its truth and\nuniversal validity, inasmuch as it expresses what Reinhold called a\n\u201cuniversally recognized fact of consciousness.\u201d\n\nSelf-evidence alone, however, is not enough. One of the chief merits\nof the Principle of Consciousness, according to Reinhold, is that from\nit one can then derive the starting point of Kant\u2019s own\nphilosophy, which appears to begin with a sheer, ungrounded assumption\nof the distinction between intuiting and thinking, the difference\nbetween theoretical and practical reason, etc. From this point,\nReinhold assures us, one can then proceed to the derivation of a\ncomplete system of philosophy as a whole, as envisioned but never\nactually accomplished by Kant himself. (One must recall that\nReinhold\u2019s work on Elementary Philosophy preceded Kant\u2019s\nthird Critique.)\n\nWith the Principle of Consciousness Reinhold believed he had uncovered\nthat \u201ccommon root\u201d of thought and sensibility, which Kant\nhad declared to be unknowable (CPR A 15/B 29). By commencing his\nanalysis at the level of \u201crepresentations as such,\u201d\nReinhold was convinced that he had, so to speak, hit philosophical\nrock bottom, inasmuch as all consciousness is self-evidently\n\u201crepresentational\u201d in character. (Fichte, however, in his\nAenesidemus review and his early writings on the\nWissenschaftslehre, would subsequently challenge precisely\nthis claim.) Thus, Reinhold\u2019s \u201cTheory of\nRepresentation\u201d (which is the first part of the Elementary\nPhilosophy) purports to provide Kant\u2019s Critical philosophy with\nthe very foundation it so sorely lacks. And the Principle of\nConsciousness is, in turn, the foundational or first principle of this\nnew Theory of Representation\u2014and hence the first principle of\nphilosophy as a whole.\n\nBy far the most original and influential portion of the Elementary\nPhilosophy is its first part, the Theory of Representation, which is\ndevoted entirely to an analysis of our fundamental faculty of the\nmind\u2014the faculty of representation itself\n[Vorstellungsverm\u00f6gen]\u2014in an effort to determine\n\u201ceverything that can be known a priori concerning the\nrepresentations of sensibility, understanding, and reason.\u201d This\nfoundational portion of the Elementary Philosophy thus purports to\nprovide a thorough and complete analysis of the necessary features of\nrepresentation qua representation, an analysis that claims to\nshow \u201cthat space, time, the twelve categories,\nand the three forms of the ideas are originally\nnothing but properties of mere representations\u201d\n(Fundament, pp. 72\u201373; RGS 4, 47). This same\nanalysis of our faculty of representation also claims to establish the\ndistinction between the form and content of representations, the\nnecessity of both receptivity and spontaneity on the part of the\nfaculty of representation, the necessary multiplicity of sensations,\nand the unknowability of things in themselves.\n\nIf Reinhold displays considerable originality and ingenuity in\nderiving the above mentioned results from his first principle (the\nPrinciple of Consciousness), the same cannot be said of the subsequent\npart of the Elementary Philosophy, the \u201cTheory of the Faculty of\nCognition,\u201d which follows Kant\u2019s own exposition much more\nclosely than the Theory of the Faculty of Representation and becomes\nincreasingly schematic\u2014and less convincing\u2014as it advances.\n(Reinhold\u2019s sole attempt at a complete exposition of his\n\u201cTheory of the Faculty of Cognition\u201d is roughly sketched\nin Book 3 of the Versuch, whereas the \u201cTheory of the\nFaculty of Representation\u201d is treated in elaborate detail in all\nthree of his book-length presentations of the Elementary\nPhilosophy.)\n\nOne may recall that Reinhold\u2019s intention was to provide a new\nfoundation not merely for the \u201ctheoretical philosophy\u201d\nexpounded by Kant in the first Critique, but for the Critical\nphilosophy as a whole, including Kant\u2019s practical philosophy. In\nfact, however, Reinhold provided his readers with only the barest\nhints of how his Elementary Philosophy might embrace Kant\u2019s\naccount of will and of practical reason. Significantly, this occurs in\nthe final, 19-page section of his \u201cTheory of the Faculty of\nCognition,\u201d entitled \u201cTheory of the Faculty of\nDesire,\u201d in which Reinhold limits himself to what he describes\nas the mere \u201coutline\u201d of a strategy for demonstrating the\nunity of theoretical and practical reason: if willing is the condition\nfor the possibility of actual, as opposed to merely possible\nrepresentation and cognition, then the \u201cfaculty of desire\u201d\nconditions the faculties of cognition and representation.\n\nUnfortunately, Reinhold never fleshed out this fascinating outline,\nnever provided any arguments for the same, and never indicated how\nthis provocative claim concerning the relation of willing to knowing\ncould be reconciled with the \u201cimmediate certainties\u201d of\nhis starting point. And this was precisely what provoked his most\nbrilliant and critical reader, J. G. Fichte to attempt his own version\nof an Elementary Philosophy\u2014a version that would begin\nwith the unity of the theoretical and the practical and that would,\nwith the act of \u201cpositing\u201d or Setzen, claim to\nhave discovered a starting point even more \u201cbasic\u201d than\nthat of mere \u201crepresentation.\u201d (It is significant that\nFichte\u2019s unpublished notebook of 1793/94, in which he first\nsketched what would subsequently be known as the\nWissenschaftslehre or \u201cTheory of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u201d was titled \u201cPrivate Meditations on Elementary\nPhilosophy/Practical Philosophy.\u201d)\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of Reinhold\u2019s\ninquiries into systematicity and first principles upon an entire\ngeneration of philosophers. Though some recent research on Reinhold\nand the \u201cJena circle\u201d of the late 1780s has stressed the\ndegree to which Reinhold himself soon came to have doubts about the\nproject of \u201cphilosophy from a single principle\u201d (see the\nwork of Dieter Henrich and his students, such as Marcello Stamm), this\nproject was nevertheless enthusiastically embraced by Fichte and the\nyoung Schelling, and inspired others, notably Hegel, to re-examine\n(and to question) the alleged connection between systematic form and\nself-evident first principles. Reinhold\u2019s subsequent\nreservations about his own Elementary Philosophy notwithstanding, the\nElementary Philosophy remains one of the clearest examples of a\nthoroughgoing \u201cfoundationalist\u201d project in the history of\nEuropean philosophy.\n",
