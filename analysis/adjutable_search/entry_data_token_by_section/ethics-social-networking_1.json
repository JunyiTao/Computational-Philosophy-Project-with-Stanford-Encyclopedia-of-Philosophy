    "main_text": "History and Definitions of Social Networking Services || Early Scholarly Engagement with Social Networking Services\n1.2 Early Scholarly Engagement with Social Networking Services\n\nStudy of the ethical implications of SNS was initially seen as a\nsubpart of Computer and Information Ethics (Bynum 2018). While\nComputer and Information Ethics certainly accommodates an\ninterdisciplinary approach, its direction and problems were initially\nlargely defined by philosophically-trained scholars such as James Moor\n(1985) and Deborah G. Johnson (1985). Yet this has not been the early\npattern for the ethics of social networking. Partly due to the\ncoincidence of the social networking phenomenon with the emerging\ninterdisciplinary social science field of \u2018Internet\nStudies\u2019 (Consalvo and Ess, 2011), the ethical implications of\nsocial networking technologies were initially targeted for inquiry by\na loose coalition of sociologists, social psychologists,\nanthropologists, ethnographers, law and media scholars and political\nscientists (see, for example, Giles 2006; Boyd 2007; Ellison et al.\n2007; Ito 2009). Consequently, philosophers who have turned their\nattention to social networking and ethics have had to decide whether\nto pursue their inquiries independently, drawing primarily from\ntraditional philosophical resources in applied computer ethics and the\nphilosophy of technology, or to develop their views in consultation\nwith the growing body of empirical data and conclusions already being\ngenerated by other disciplines. While this entry will primarily\nconfine itself to reviewing existing philosophical research on social\nnetworking ethics, links between those researches and studies in other\ndisciplinary contexts remain vital.\n\nIndeed, recent academic and popular debates about the harms and\nbenefits of large social media platforms have been driven far more\nvisibly by scholars in sociology (Benjamin 2019), information studies\n(Roberts 2019), psychology (Zuboff 2019) and other social sciences\nthan by philosophers, who remain comparatively disengaged. In turn,\nrather than engage with philosophical ethics, social science\nresearchers in this field typically anchor normative dimensions of\ntheir analyses in broader political frameworks of justice and human\nrights, or psychological accounts of wellbeing. This has led to a\ngrowing debate about whether philosophical \u2018ethics\u2019\nremains the right lens through which to subject social networking\nservices or other emerging technologies to normative critique (Green\n2021, Other Internet Resources). This debate is driven by several\nconcerns. First is the growing professionalization of applied ethics\n(Stark and Hoffmann 2019) and its perceived detachment from social\ncritique. A second concern is the trend of insincere corporate\nappropriation of the language of ethics for marketing, crisis\nmanagement and public relations purposes, known as\n\u2018ethicswashing\u2019 (Bietti 2020). Finally, there is the\nquestion of whether philosophical theories of ethics, which have\ntraditionally focused on individual actions, are sufficiently\nresponsive to the structural conditions of social injustice that drive\nmany SNS-associated harms.\n",
