    "main_text": "Meritocratic Justice\n4. Meritocratic Justice\n\nIn its second sense, meritocracy is a theory of justice. It is a\ncompetitor to egalitarianism (in its various forms\u2014strict, luck,\nRawlsian, etc.), utilitarianism, libertarianism, and the other\ntheories of justice. A meritocrat in this sense is someone who\nbelieves that a just state is a meritocracy.\n\nLittle work has been done on the relationship between\nmeritocracy\u2019s two senses\u2014an approach to governance and a\ntheory of justice (although see Mulligan 2022)\u2014and it is unclear\nwhat, if any, connection there is between them. It certainly seems\ncoherent to believe (e.g.) both (i) social goods should be distributed\non the basis of merit and (ii) we should have a democratic, not a\nmeritocratic, approach to politics.\n\nNow, theories of justice across the aforementioned traditions may\ntentatively endorse meritocratic principles. For these principles may\nbe instrumentally useful in promoting their preferred ideal of\njustice. For example, it is plausible that merit-based hiring\n (\u00a74.2)\n promotes the general welfare, to some extent. Thus, a utilitarian may\nendorse meritocracy of that sort, instrumentally.\n\nAs Adam Swift and Gordon Marshall put this view,\n\n\na meritocratic allocation of individuals to occupations can be\njustified on the grounds that a society in which people are doing what\nthey are best able to do will be optimally productive, but a\nmeritocratic allocation of rewards to individuals can not be justified\non the grounds that such an allocation gives people what they deserve.\n(1997: 44)\n\n\n(See also Daniels 1978.)\n\nThis is certainly a defensible view of meritocracy\u2019s allure, and\nit appears to be backed up empirically. As Roland B\u00e9nabou puts\nit,\n\n\nthe analysis generally validates the common intuition that\nmeritocracy, appropriately defined, is desirable \u2026 on grounds\nof efficiency. (2000: 319)\n\n\nBut this instrumental connection between merit and good consequences\nis contingent\n (\u00a72.1).\n The most vocal proponents of meritocracy hold that there is a\ndeontological requirement to distribute on the basis of\n merit.[2]\n And so any good consequences are, at best, a happy side-effect of\nadherence to a moral rule. But why does such a requirement exist?\n",
