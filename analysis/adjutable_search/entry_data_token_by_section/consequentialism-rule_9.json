It will endorse rules\nprohibiting physically attacking innocent people, taking or harming\nthe property of others, breaking one\u2019s promises, and lying. It\nwill also endorse rules requiring one to pay special attention to the\nneeds of one\u2019s family and friends, but more generally to be\nwilling to help others with their (morally permissible) projects. A\nsociety where such rules are prominent in a public code would be\nlikely to have more good in it than one lacking such rules.\n\nThe fact that these rules are endorsed by rule-consequentialism makes\nrule-consequentialism attractive. For, intuitively, these rules seem\nright. However, other moral theories endorse these rules as well. Most\nobviously, a familiar kind of moral pluralism contends that these\nintuitively attractive rules constitute the most basic level of\nmorality, i.e., that there is no deeper moral principle underlying and\nunifying these rules. Call this view Rossian pluralism (in honor of\nits champion W.D. Ross (1930, 1939)).\n\nRule-consequentialism may agree with Rossian pluralism in endorsing\nrules against physically attacking the innocent, stealing, promise\nbreaking, and rules requiring various kinds of loyalty and more\ngenerally doing good for others. But rule-consequentialism goes beyond\nRossian pluralism by specifying an underlying unifying principle that\nprovides impartial justification for such rules. Other moral theories\ntry to do this too. Such theories include some forms of Kantianism\n(Audi 2001, 2004) and some forms of contractualism (Scanlon 1998;\nParfit 2011; Levy 2013). In any case, the first way of arguing for\nrule-consequentialism is to argue that it specifies an underlying\nprinciple that provides impartial justification for intuitively\nplausible moral rules, and that no rival theory does this as well\n(Urmson 1953; Brandt 1967; Hospers 1972; Hooker 2000). (Attacks on\nthis line of argument for rule-consequentialism include Stratton-Lake\n1997; Thomas 2000; D. Miller 2000; Montague 2000; Arneson 2005; Moore\n2007; Hills 2010; Levy 2014.)\n\nThis first way of arguing for rule-consequentialism might be seen as\ndrawing on the idea that a theory is better justified to us to the\nextent that it increases coherence within our beliefs (Rawls 1951,\n1971: 19\u201321, 46\u201351; DePaul 1987; Ebertz 1993; Sayre-McCord\n1986, 1996). [See the entry on\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification.]\n But the approach might also be seen as moderately foundationalist in\nthat it begins with a set of beliefs (in various moral rules) to which\nit assigns independent credibility though not infallibility (Audi\n1996, 2004; Crisp 2000). [See the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification.]\n Admittedly, coherence with our moral beliefs does not make a moral\ntheory true, since our moral beliefs might be mistaken.\nNevertheless, if a moral theory fails significantly to cohere with our\nmoral beliefs, this undermines the theory\u2019s ability to be\njustified to us.\n\nWolf (2016) and Copp (2020) argue that the meta-ethical view that\nmorality is a social practice with a particular function might lead us\nto rule-consequentialism. However, Hooker (forthcoming) contends that\nthe meta-ethical view that morality is a social practice with a\nparticular function stands in need of justification in terms of\nwhether it coheres with our considered moral principles and more\nspecific considered moral judgements. In other words, that\nmeta-ethical view about the function of morality needs to be judged in\nterms of whether it helps us achieve a reflective equilibrium among\nour beliefs or not.\n\nThe second way of arguing for rule-consequentialism is very different.\nIt begins with a commitment to consequentialist assessment. With that\ncommitment as a first premise, the point is then made that assessing\nacts indirectly, e.g., by focusing on the consequences of\ncommunal acceptance of rules, will in fact produce better consequences\nthan assessing acts directly in terms of their own consequences\n(Austin 1832; Brandt 1963, 1979; Harsanyi 1982: 58\u201360; 1993;\nRiley 2000). After all, making decisions about what to do is the main\npoint of moral assessment of acts. So if a way of morally assessing\nacts is likely to lead to bad decisions, or more generally lead to bad\nconsequences, then, according to a consequentialist point of view, so\nmuch the worse for that way of assessing acts.\n\nEarlier we saw that all consequentialists now accept that assessing\neach act individually by its expected value is in general a terrible\nprocedure for making moral decisions. Agents should decide how to act\nby instead appealing to certain rules such as \u201cdon\u2019t\nphysically attack others\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t steal\u201d,\n\u201cdon\u2019t break your promises\u201d, \u201cpay special\nattention to the needs of your family and friends\u201d, and\n\u201cbe generally helpful to others\u201d. And these are the rules\nthat rule-consequentialism endorses. Many consequentialists, however,\nthink this hardly shows that full rule-consequentialism is the best\nform of consequentialism. Once a distinction is made between, on the\none hand, the best procedure for making moral decisions about what to\ndo and, on the other hand, the criteria of moral rightness and\nwrongness, all consequentialists can admit that we need\nrule-consequentialism\u2019s rules for our decision procedure. But\nconsequentialists who are not rule-consequentialists contend that such\nrules play no role in the criterion of moral rightness. Hence these\nconsequentialists reject what this article has called full\nrule-consequentialism.\n\nHowever, whether the objection we have just been considering to the\nsecond way of arguing for rule-consequentialism is a good objection\ndepends on whether it is legitimate to distinguish between procedures\nappropriate for making moral decisions and the criteria of moral\nrightness or wrongness. That matter remains contentious (Hooker 2010;\nde Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014: ch. 10).\n\nYet the second way of arguing for rule-consequentialism runs into\nanother and quite different objection. This objection is that the\nfirst step in this argument for rule-consequentialism is a commitment\nto consequentialist assessment. This first step itself needs\njustification. Why assume that assessing things in a consequentialist\nway is uniquely justified?\n\nIt might be said that consequentialist assessment is justified because\npromoting the impartial good has an obvious intuitive appeal. But that\nwon\u2019t do, since there are alternatives to consequentialist\nassessment that also have obvious intuitive appeal, for example,\n\u201cact on the code that no one could reasonably reject\u201d.\nWhat we need is a way of arguing for a moral theory that does not\nstart by begging the question which kind of theory is most\nplausible.\n\nA third way of arguing for rule-consequentialism is contractualist\n(Harsanyi 1953, 1955, 1982, 1993; Brandt 1979, 1988, 1996; Scanlon\n1982, 1998; Parfit 2011; Levy 2013). Suppose we can specify reasonable\nconditions under which everyone would choose, or at least would have\nsufficient reason to choose, the same code of rules. Intuitively, such\nan idealized agreement would legitimate that code of rules. Now if\nthose rules are the ones whose internalisation would maximise the\nexpected good, contractualism is leading us to\nrule-consequentialism\u2019s rules.\n\nThere are different views about what would be reasonable conditions\nfor choosing among alternative possible moral rules. One view is that\neveryone\u2019s impartiality would have to be insured by the\nimposition of a hypothetical \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d behind\nwhich no one knew any specific facts about himself or herself\n(Harsanyi 1953, 1955). Another view is that we should imagine that\npeople would be choosing a moral code on the basis of (a) full\nempirical information about the different effects on everyone, (b)\nnormal concerns (self-interested as well as altruistic), and (c)\nroughly equal bargaining power (Brandt 1979; cf. Gert 1998). Parfit\n(2011) proposes seeking rules that everyone has (personal or\nimpartial) reason to choose or will that everyone accept. If impartial\nreasons are always sufficient even when opposed by personal ones, then\neveryone has sufficient reason to will that everyone accept the rules\nwhose universal acceptance will have the best consequences impartially\nconsidered. Similarly, Levy (2013) supposes that no one could\nreasonably reject a code of rules that would impose on her burdens\nthat add up to less than the aggregate of burdens that every other\ncode would impose on others. Such arguments suggest the extensional\nequivalence of contractualism and rule-consequentialism. (For\nassessment of whether Parfit\u2019s contractualist arguments for\nrule-consequentialism succeed, see J. Ross 2009; Nebel 2012; Hooker\n2014. For similarities between rule-consequentialism and\nScanlon\u2019s contractualism, and the difficulty of deciding between\nthese two theories, see Suikkanen 2022.)\n",
