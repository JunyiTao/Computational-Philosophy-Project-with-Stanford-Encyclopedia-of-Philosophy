    "main_text": "Objections || Antidemocratic\n7.6 Antidemocratic\n\nA further objection to the idea of public reason\u2014again\nparticularly Rawls\u2019s account\u2014is that it is antidemocratic.\nOn Rawls\u2019s account, the content of public reason is partly fixed\nvia philosophical argument, prior to any actual democratic\ndeliberation amongst citizens (see sect. 5). Seyla Benhabib thus\ncomplains that \u201cpublic reason in Rawls\u2019s theory is best\nviewed not as a process of reasoning among citizens, but more\nas a regulative principle, imposing certain standards upon how\nindividuals, institutions, and agencies ought to reason about\npublic matters. The standards of public reason are set by a\npolitical conception of liberalism\u201d (Benhabib 2002,\n108). Similarly, Habermas argues that Rawls\u2019s theory does not\ntake seriously enough the importance of democratic or political\nautonomy, and by giving public reason determinate content in the shape\nof certain liberal principles \u201cgenerates a priority of liberal\nrights which demotes the democratic process to an inferior\nstatus\u201d (Habermas 1995, 128). Although these complaints are made\nabout Rawls\u2019s account, the objection obviously applies, with\ngreater or lesser force, to any conception of public reason that fixes\nthe content of public reason, to some extent, prior to any actual\ndemocratic debate.\n\nThe response on behalf of Rawls\u2019s account and similar views is\nlikely to take the following form. First, Rawls does not purport to\noffer a determinate account of public reason\u2019s content; rather\nhe suggests that the content of public reason is given by a family of\npolitical conceptions of justice. His theory thus \u201cdoes not try\nto fix public reason once and for all in the form of one favored\npolitical conception of justice\u201d (Rawls 1999b, 582). Second,\ninsofar as the content of public reason is partly\ndeterminate\u2014for example, Rawls claims it must include certain\nbasic rights and liberties for all persons\u2014this does not appear\nparticularly objectionable, nor does it seem a problematic restriction\nof the democratic process, unless one believes that democratic\nmajorities can permissibly vote to deny the basic rights of certain\nindividuals (Quong 2013). Finally, since all conceptions of public\nreason aim at the public justification of moral or political rules, it\nis not strange to suppose that the content of public reason might be\npartly determinate prior to any actual discussion and deliberation. It\nis plausible to believe that certain basic rules prohibiting\nnon-consensual harming of innocent persons, or protecting certain\nminimal rights of bodily integrity, must be justifiable to all members\nof the constituency of public reason, provided we assume those members\nare committed to certain minimal ideals of freedom and equality (Cohen\n2010, 272\u2013277). To assume otherwise\u2014as those who press the\nantidemocratic objection appear to do\u2014would be to concede that\nwe cannot be certain, in advance of actual deliberation amongst real\npersons, that our most basic moral and political commitments are\npublicly justifiable. If this assumption were true, it seems more\nlikely to count against the very idea of public reason, as opposed to\nsomething that counts against Rawls\u2019s particular conception of\npublic reason.\n",
