    "main_text": "Variables\n6. Variables\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are no individual or predicate\nconstants in the formal system of PM, only variables. The\nIntroduction, however, makes use of the example \u201c\\(a\\) standing\nin the relation \\(R\\) to \\(b\\)\u201d in a discussion of atomic facts\n(PM, 43). Although \u201c\\(R\\)\u201d is later used as a variable\nthat ranges over relations in extension, and\n\u201c\\(a,b,c,\\ldots\\)\u201d are individual variables, let us\ntemporarily add them to the system as predicate and individual\nconstants, respectively, in order to discuss the use of variables in\nPM.\n\nPM makes special use of the distinction between \u201creal\u201d, or\nfree, variables and \u201capparent\u201d, or bound, variables. Since\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d is a variable, \u201c\\(xRy\\)\u201d will be an\natomic formula in our extended language, with \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(y\\)\u201d real variables. When such formulae are combined\nwith the propositional connectives \\(\\osim\\), \\(\\lor\\), etc., the\nresult is a matrix. For example, \u201c\\(aRx \\ldot {\\lor}\n\\ldot xRy\\)\u201d would be a matrix.\n\nAs we saw earlier, there are also variables which range over\nfunctions: \u201c\\(\\phi\\), \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\ldots,f, g\\)\u201d, etc. The\nexpression \u201c\\(\\phi x\\)\u201d thus contains two variables and\nstands for a proposition, in particular, the result of applying the\nfunction \\(\\phi\\) to the individual \\(x\\).\n\nTheorems are stated with real variables, which gives them a special\nsignificance with regard to the theory. For example, \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u221710\u00b71}\n \\vdash \\colon (x) \\ldot \\phi x \\ldot {\\supset} \\ldot \\phi y \\quad\\Pp\n\\]\n\n\nis a fundamental axiom of the quantificational theory of PM. In this\nPrimitive Proposition the variables \u201c\\(\\phi\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(y\\)\u201d are real (free), and the \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d is\napparent (bound). As there are no constants in the system, this is the\nclosest that PM comes to a rule of universal instantiation.\n\nWhitehead and Russell interpret \u201c\\((x) \\sdot \\phi x\\)\u201d as\n\u201cthe proposition which asserts all the values for\n\\(\\phi \\hat{x}\\)\u201d (PM 41). The use of the word \u201call\u201d\nhas special significance within the theory of types. They present the\nvicious circle principle, which underlies the theory of\ntypes:\n\n\u2026 generally, given any set of objects such that, if we suppose\nthe set to have a total, it will contain members which presuppose this\ntotal, then such as set cannot have a total. By saying that the set\nhas \u201cno total\u201d, we mean, primarily, that no significant\nstatement can be made about \u201call its members\u201d. (PM, 37)\n\n\nSpecifically, then, a quantified expression, since it talks about\n(presupposes) \u201call\u201d the members of a totality, must\nexpress a member of a different, higher, logical type than those\nmembers in order to observe the vicious circle principle. Thus, when\ninterpreting a bound variable, we must assume that it ranges over a\nspecific type of entity, and so types must be assigned to the other\nentities represented by expressions in the formula, in observance with\nthe theory of types.\n\nA question arises, however, once one realizes that the statements of\nprimitive propositions and theorems in PM such as \u221710\u00b71\nare taken to be \u201ctypically ambiguous\u201d (i.e., ambiguous\nwith respect to type). These statements are actually schematic and\nrepresent all the possible specific assertions which can be derived\nfrom them by interpreting types appropriately. But if statements like\n\u221710\u00b71 are schemata and yet have bound variables, how do\nwe assign types to the entities over which the bound variables range?\nThe answer is to first decide which type of thing the free variables\nin the statement range over. For example, assuming that the variable\n\\(y\\) in \u221710\u00b71 ranges over individuals (of type\n\\(\\iota)\\), then the variable \\(\\phi\\) must range over functions of\ntype \\((\\iota)/n\\), for some \\(n\\). Then the bound variable \\(x\\) will\nalso range over individuals. If, however, we assume that the variable\n\\(y\\) in \u221710\u00b71 ranges over functions of type\n\\((\\iota)/1\\), then the variable \\(\\phi\\) must range over functions of\ntype \\(((\\iota)/1)/m\\), for some \\(m\\). In this case, the bound\nvariable \\(x\\) will range over functions of type \\((\\iota)/1\\).\n\nSo \\(y\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are called \u201creal\u201d variables in\n\u221710\u00b71 not only because they are free but also because\nthey can range over any type. Whitehead and Russell frequently say\nthat real variables are taken to ambiguously denote \u201cany\u201d\nof their instances, while bound variables (which also ambiguously\ndenote) range over \u201call\u201d of their instances (within a\nlegitimate totality, i.e. type).\n",
