    "main_text": "The Logic of Communication || Common Knowledge and Social Procedures\n4.2 Common Knowledge and Social Procedures\n\nMany social procedures are designed to create common knowledge (Lewis\n1969; van Ditmarsch et al. 2009; and entry on\n common knowledge).\n The old-fashioned ritual that takes place when you withdraw a large\namount of money from your bank account and have it paid out to you in\ncash by the cashier is an example.\n\nHow and whether common knowledge can be achieved depends on available\ncommunication facilities. Public announcement or publicly observable\nritual (the cashier ritual mentioned above) can create common\nknowledge. But, as Halpern and Moses (1984)\nproved, message exchange in a\ndistributed environment, where there is no guarantee that messages get\ndelivered, cannot. Halpern and Moses use the example of two generals\nwho are planning a coordinated attack on a city. The generals are on\ntwo hills on opposite sides of the city, each with their own army, and\nthey know that they can only succeed in capturing the city if their\ntwo armies attack at the same time. But the valley that separates the\ntwo hills is in enemy hands, and any messengers that are sent from one\narmy base to the other run a severe risk to get captured. The generals\nhave agreed on a joint attack, but still have to settle the time. So\nthe generals start sending messages, for example, \u201cLet\u2019s\nattack at 9:00 AM\u201d. But they cannot be sure that the messengers\nsucceed in delivering their message. And if they get through, there is\nno guarantee that the message of acknowledgement will get delivered.\nAnd so on.\n\nEven if common knowledge is sometimes hard to achieve in practice, it\nserves as necessary presumption in regulating society. Roman lawgivers\nfound out long ago that if citizens within their jurisdiction could\nplead innocence because of being unaware of the law, no offender could\never get convicted. So they invented principles like\nIgnorantia legis neminem excusat,\n\u201cignorance of the law excuses no one\u201d. Societies that\nabide by the rule of law have to be organized in such a way that\ncitizens in principle are in a position to know\nthe law. The laws have to be properly published and distributed, for\nexample, by being printed in a government gazette to which every\ncitizen has access.\n\nIn his book \u201cRational Ritual\u201d (2001),\nMichael Suk-Young Chwe points out the\nimportance of the size of groups for which\ncommon knowledge gets established. A brand name that is common\nknowledge in a large group is worth a lot of money. Chwe analyzes the\nexample of advertisements broadcasted during the American football\nSuper Bowl. He compares the enormous cost of making something common\nknowledge by means of such advertisements to the obvious benefits.\nPart of the benefit is in the fact that the advertisements create\ncommon knowledge. An important consideration when deciding to buy a\nsmartphone of a particular brand, for example, is the knowledge that\nothers are going to buy the same model too.\n\nOf course in many social situations, you may want to prevent\ncommon knowledge from arising, for example, if you want to keep a\nsecret from certain others. There are also more interesting cases\nwhere everybody knows some fact, for example that a particular country\npossesses nuclear weapons, but where it would lead to political\nproblems to make this fact common knowledge by making a public\nannouncement. For a number of such social situations where maintaining\nprivacy and ignorance are crucial, see van Eijck and Verbrugge (2009).\nAn interesting recent development is the study of dynamic-epistemic\nlogic-based epistemic planning, which enables us to\nsynthesize communication protocols in order to create certain exact\nconfigurations of levels of higher-order knowledge within a group\n(Bolander and Andersen 2011, L\u00f6we, Pacuit, and Witzel 2011).\n",
