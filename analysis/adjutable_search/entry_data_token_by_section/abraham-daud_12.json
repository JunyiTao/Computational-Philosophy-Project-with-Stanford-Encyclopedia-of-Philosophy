    "main_text": "The Reception of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah\n6. The Reception of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah\n\n\nIf Ibn Daud can be regarded as the pioneer of medieval Jewish\nAristotelianism, the question arises whether Maimonides, who, through\nhis Guide and his prestige turned it into the dominant\ncurrent in medieval Jewish rationalism, was familiar with the thought\nof his predecessor. Husik goes as far as to state: \u201cwe feel\ntempted to say that if not for Ibn Daud there would have been no\nMaimonides\u201d (Husik 2002: 198). However, Maimonides makes no\nexplicit mention of Ibn Daud in any of his works. Yet he seems to\nallude to him in Guide I.71, when he refers to one of the\nearlier Jewish Andalusian thinkers whose doctrine is approximately the\nsame as that of his own book, a description that fits Ibn Daud far\nbetter than any other of Maimonides\u2019 Jewish predecessors. In spite of\nthe absence of a specific mention of Ibn Daud, it is highly probable\nthat Maimonides was familiar with Ibn Daud\u2019s work, as the large number\nof similarities between the two works\n suggests.[2]\n To a large extent, these points of overlap are due to their\nauthors\u2019 common use of theories from Islamic sources, such as\nthe demonstrations for the existence of God.  Other parallels,\nhowever, cannot be attributed to these sources, such as parallels in\nBiblical exegesis, in particular verses that relate to the doctrine of\nangels, their interpretation of the term elohim and of the\nterms tselem and demut in Gen.\n 1:26.[3]\n\n\nOther shared characteristics concern the general framework and the\nintended audience: both works seek to guide Jews who are confused in\ntheir traditional belief as a result of the study of philosophy.\nMoreover, in some passages, Maimonides seems to implicitly criticize\nor correct Ibn Daud, for example, in his doctrine of attributes where\nMaimonides explicitly rejects the view that attributes that are\nunderstood as relations can be ascribed to God (cf. section 5.3\nabove).  Maimonides says that at first sight this kind of predication\nmay seem permissible, but more exact speculation proves that it is\nincorrect, since there is no true relation between God and what is\nother than God (Guide I.52, transl. Pines p. 120).  In\ngeneral, one is tempted to assume that Ibn Daud\u2019s work served as\na model for Maimonides from which he drew inspiration on the one hand\nand which he found to be in need of improvement on the other. \n\n\nRecent research suggests that Ibn Daud\u2019s thought has had more impact\non post-Maimonidian medieval Jewish philosophy than was previously\nassumed. M. Zonta has argued that the renewed interest in ER in\nthe second half of the fourteenth century, as evidenced by the\nproduction of two Hebrew translations, had to do with the emergence of\na \u2018Jewish Avicennism\u2019 during that period (Zonta\n2002). Marginal glosses in several manuscripts of ER reveal\nthat the text was actually studied, perhaps even by a group of\nstudents. Hasdai Crescas mentions Ibn Daud together with Ibn Sina and\nal-Ghazali as an important pre-Maimonidean author (Or ha-Shem,\nIntroduction to Book I). Crescas\u2019s student Josef Albo seems to have\ndrawn on Ibn Daud\u2019s views (Ehrlich 2010). Y. Essudri has established\nthat also R. Ephraim al-Naqawah of Tlemcen (first half of the 15th\ncentury) quoted from ER, whereas a late 15th century manuscript\ncontains a commentary on it that was perhaps intended for\nteaching-purposes.\n",
