    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Ordinary versus Global Manipulation\n1.1 Ordinary versus Global Manipulation\n\nForms of influence like those listed above are commonplace in ordinary\nlife. This distinguishes them from forms of influence described as\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d in the free will literature. There, the\nterm \u201cmanipulation\u201d typically refers to radical\nprogramming or reprogramming of all or most of an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs, desires, and other mental states. Such global manipulation\n(as we might call it) is also typically imagined as happening via\ndecidedly extra-ordinary methods, such as supernatural intervention,\ndirect neurological engineering, or radical programs of indoctrination\nand psychological conditioning. Global manipulation is typically\nthought to deprive its victim of free will. This common intuition\ndrives the \u201cmanipulation argument\u201d, which seeks to defend\nincompatibilism by claiming that living in a deterministic universe is\nanalogous to having been the victim of global manipulation. (For a\ndetailed discussion of this argument, see the discussion of\nmanipulation arguments in the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.)\n\nDespite the differences between what we might call \u201cordinary\nmanipulation\u201d and the forms of manipulation in the free will\nliterature, it is still worth wondering about the relationship between\nthem. If global manipulation completely deprives its victim of free\nwill or autonomy, might more ordinary forms of manipulation do\nsomething similar, but on a more limited scale? If Tonya succumbs to\none of Irving\u2019s tactics, should we regard her as being less\nfree\u2014and perhaps less responsible\u2014for doing X? So\nfar, few people have explored the connections between ordinary\nmanipulation and the forms of global manipulation discussed in the\nfree will literature. (Two exceptions are Long 2014 and Todd\n2013).\n",
