    "main_text": "Introduction || Life and Work\n1.2 Life and Work\n\nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish\nfamily in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the\nRussian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and\nthe Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program\nin which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included\nphilosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized\u2014as she\nherself later did\u2014the importance of developing systematic\nconnections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013).\nRand\u2019s formal philosophical education included ancient\nphilosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical\npsychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But\nshe was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas,\nwhich blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age),\nand read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After\ngraduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in\nscreenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for\nCinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian\nnovelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose\ninfluence she owes the \u201cRomantic Realism\u201d of her\nnovels.\n\nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in\nthe United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no\nintention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago,\nshe made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous\nencounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and\nlater as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous\nencounter, this time with the actor Frank O\u2019Connor, whom she\nmarried in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She\nadopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family\nback in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening\nPost in 1936 that \u201cRand\u201d was an abbreviation of her\nRussian surname.\n\nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where\nshe became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly\nNew-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical\nliberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the\nAustrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American\nnovelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson.\nRand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy\nof the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until\nher death in 1982.\n\nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and\nachievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a\ngood human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life.\nPhilosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative\nabstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is.\nEveryone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at\nleast an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief\nthat if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more\nor less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our\nlives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical\nimportance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode,\nRand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution\nwithin each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals\nthrough rational discourse and the inspiration of art.\n\nRand\u2019s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of\ndevelopment, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas\nShrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle\npsychological explorations of her characters\u2019 emotions and\nthoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the\ndramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially\nDostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also\nuses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both\nits supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas\nShrugged as a \u201cstunt novel\u201d and a murder\nmystery\u2014the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture.\nBy \u201csoul\u201d, however, she meant not an immortal substance\nthat survives the death of the body\u2014she is not a dualist in any\naspect of her philosophy\u2014but the mind, or the human spirit that\ncelebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and\nliterary trope\u2014a workers\u2019 strike\u2014and turned it on\nits head to show what happens when \u201cthe men of\nmind\u201d\u2014scientists, philosophers, industrialists,\nentrepreneurs, writers\u2014the \u201cprime movers\u201d of a\nsociety\u2014go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong\nmetaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous\npersonal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and\nhow the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the\nrebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white\nsteeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a\ndozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the\nmid-20th century industrial America of steel mills,\nskyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental\nrailroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean\nenergy became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre) build a motor\npowered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her\nnovels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be:\n\n\nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the\nhopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the\nnot-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely\nfrustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to\nreach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you\ndesired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible\u2026.\n(Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983).\n\n\nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached\nintegrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed\nnot in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This\nestimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many\nreaders find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her\nethical and political views misguided.\n\nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of\nall philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of\nAtlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is\nA) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While\nshe differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including\nrationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is\nevident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint\nwriting style, as well as in her \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of\ntraditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and\nthe spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th\nAnniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the\nnovel\u2019s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from\nNietzsche\u2019s Beyond Good and Evil: \u201cThe noble soul\nhas reverence for itself\u201d. (For The\nFountainhead\u2019s partly sympathetic and partly critical\nengagement with Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, see Hunt 2006.)\n",
