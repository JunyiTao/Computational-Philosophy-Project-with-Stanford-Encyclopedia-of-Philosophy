    "main_text": "Major Themes of Diderot\u2019s Philosophy || Skepticism, eclecticism and language\n2.1 Skepticism, eclecticism and language\n\nAside from the early translation projects discussed in Part I,\nDiderot\u2019s first philosophical writings, such as the\nPens\u00e9es philosophiques (1746, expanded in 1762) and\nthe Promenade du sceptique (1747), play a complicated\nrhetorical game with deism (rather than overt materialism),\nskepticism, and natural religion. In the Pens\u00e9es,\nDiderot even toys with a \u201cdesign argument\u201d using the\nclassic example of the complexity of a butterfly\u2019s wing (\u00a7\nXVIII), although he seems to retract this a few years later, in the\nApologie de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 de Prades (1752), writing\nthat \u201cI thought the wing of a butterfly brought me closer to\ndivinity than a volume of metaphysics\u201d (DPV IV: 361,\ntranslations always ours unless otherwise indicated). Even if he is\nnot yet a materialist in these works, Diderot does speak of the\nnecessity to \u201cwiden\u201d or \u201cenlarge\u201d God\n(Pens\u00e9es philosophiques, \u00a7 XXVI), a phrase which\nhas fairly strong Spinozist and/or deist overtones.\n\nBy the time of the Lettre sur les aveugles (1749), Diderot\nhas launched upon a philosophical project, or a set of intersecting\nprojects, which will endure to the end of his life: a radicalization\nof empiricism in the direction of a materialist metaphysics, which\nalso remains at times skeptical or at least anti-foundationalist with\nregard both to the possibility of an intellectual system, and to the\nexistence of order or totality in the universe.\n\nYet if Diderot\u2019s philosophy needs to be understood in terms of\nhis lifelong project to develop and refine certain clear metaphysical\nand epistemological commitments and arguments, it also needs be to\nunderstood in terms of his avowed \u201ceclecticism\u201d, in\nparticular his hostility to overly binary dogmatic thinking. This\nreflects his deep awareness of the complexities of language itself,\nespecially the immanent tendency for speech to refute itself and\nsubvert its stated convictions. Diderot\u2019s passionate love for\nirony, satire, humor, and the play of language as both a critical and\nsubversive force often served him as a vehicle for capturing the\ninfinite complexities of being that transcend stable finite human\nunderstanding, which means we his writing should also be read with the\nsame attention to its linguistic complexity that he had when writing\nit.\n\nAlthough the link it is not often noted, it is useful in this context\nto remember that Diderot was among the generation of French\nphilosophers that were directly influenced by Nicolas\n Malebranche,\n whose influence upon French philosophy in the years 1690\u20131730,\nthe precise years of Diderot\u2019s maturation as a thinker, was\nimmense and insufficiently recognized. This influence was not rooted\nin Malebranche\u2019s specific doctrines such as occasionalism, but\nin the model his philosophy offered of how empirical skepticism could\nbe sustained together with scientific, and especially mathematical\nrationalism. Diderot\u2019s own affection for mathematics was rooted\nin these Malebranchian currents of French thought, as were his strong\nconvictions about the limits of mathematics as well.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s philosophy has aptly been described as\n\u201cHume, but with Christian faith\u201d in the sense that like\nHume he offers a massive skeptical critique of the capacity for humans\nto produce certain knowledge as a result of the epistemological\ninadequacy of their senses and higher cognitive faculties, but unlike\nhim Malebranche nevertheless offers a path forward toward such\nknowledge through a Cartesian understanding of divine reason as\naccessible to humans through the proper practice of mathematical\nreasoning. In brief, to reason like God is to reason like an advanced\nmathematician, especially one trained in the new analytical\nmathematics of the period, and to the extent that this kind of\nreasoning is adaptable to human language itself, it allows for human\nthinking to connect with the divine order of things through a proper\npractice of rigorous cognitive and linguistic discipline. Anchoring\nthis understanding for Malebranche was a Christian faith in a\nrationally created cosmos accessible to the human mind, and while\nlater Malebranchians followed Hume in discarding this Christian\nfoundation, many nevertheless absorbed Malebranche\u2019s lessons\nregarding the power of a properly constituted language (his model was\nadvanced analytical mathematics) to serve as a bridge connecting\nlimited humans with the infinitude of being. Diderot\u2019s partner\nD\u2019Alembert represented the explicitly mathematical strand of\nthis tradition of thinking, but Diderot embodied another strand, more\nattentive to language in all its variety as the link joining finite\nhuman understanding with the infinite complexities of nature. Although\nDiderot was suspicious of D\u2019Alembert\u2019s Malebranchian\nconception of mathematics as the foundational model for all of\nscience, his own interests in the empirical natural sciences were\nstill rooted in the same preoccupation with how nature represents\nitself and is represented by humans in scientific work. He was\nespecially attentive to the crucial role that language plays in\nrendering experiential phenomena suitable for human knowledge, and if\nhe was critical of the over-emphasis upon mathematics as the supreme\nmodel for a fully rigorous scientific language, he was nevertheless\nMalebranchian in treating the relation between experiential phenomena,\nlinguistic description, and human knowledge in all its variety as the\nepistemological zone that mattered most.\n\nDiderot\u2019s eclecticism from this perspective was not simply a\nnegative reaction against dogmatism, even if in his important\nEncyclop\u00e9die article \u201c\u00c9clectisme\u201d,\nhe opposes eclecticism to sectarianism. He also explicitly ties\neclecticism to an attention to language and discursivity in\nphilosophy. Founders of discursivity are eclectics, distinct from\nsyncretists (Diderot mentions Luther and Bruno as examples). However,\nhe fully disapproves of the Alexandrian school of eclectics, while\nattaching himself to modern eclecticism (including\nCampanella, Hobbes, and Bacon, but also Descartes, a reference that\nmakes most sense if read through Malebranchian Cartesianism):\n\u201cThe eclectic does not randomly gather together truths, nor\nleave them in isolation; even less does she force them into some\ndeterminate plan\u201d (Enc. V: 270). Diderot presents both\nBacon and Descartes as eclectics, which we might actually think of as\nmeaning \u201cempiricists\u201d, in the sense of placing experience\nand experiment at the center of knowledge-gathering practices. But we\nshould also see this in terms of language, remembering the link\nbetween Montaigne and his project of representing natural experience\nthrough his new genre of the essay, and Bacon\u2019s own attachments\nto empiricism, experimentalism, and the genre of the essay, along with\nother forms of representational writing, including fictional\nstorytelling and the use of aphorisms alongside other more\nrecognizable philosophical genres.\n\nDiderot\u2019s eclecticism and materialism nevertheless remain in\ntension, since eclecticism is not conducive to foundational\nontological commitments, while materialism, whatever the specific\nmatter theory it bases itself on, seems to be a paramount case of a\nfoundationalist ontology. What is real is matter, or perhaps, what the\nsciences of matter declare to be real (and this can vary widely, from\nthe chemistry of mixts which Diderot was so fascinated by\n[P\u00e9pin 2012], to the nascent biology he seems to be calling for\nin the Pens\u00e9es sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la\nnature, as we discuss below, to physics). And yet, as a series of\npropositional pens\u00e9es offered to readers without any\ninterconnecting discursive bridge between themes, this text also\npropounds eclecticism methodologically, in contrast to a\nsystematically presented set of premises, arguments and conclusions.\nThis play between imaginative possibility and demonstrative certainty,\nand between what rationally must be and what language is capable of\ncapturing and conveying in human terms is characteristic of\nDiderot\u2019s thought overall, and his philosophy cannot be shorn of\nthis conceptual linguistic instability without destroying its\npower.\n\nIn the next three sections, we discuss his empiricism, his materialism\nand what we term his philosophical anthropology, namely, his ideas\nconcerning features specific to human beings, such as aesthetics and\nethics, although as we discuss, these are also located within\nDiderot\u2019s overall commitment to naturalism.\n",
