    "main_text": "Use of Pre-Platonic Sources\n4. Use of Pre-Platonic Sources\n\n\nSurely one of the most interesting aspects of Patrizi's\nphilosophical works is his ongoing dedication to the study of sources\nin the history of philosophy as an essential part of his developing his\nown philosophical views. Not content merely to interpret the\nmajor sources such as Aristotle and Plato, nor even to limit himself to\nthe \u201ccomparatio\u201d tradition which sought to delineate the\nmajor differences between those two schools of thought, Patrizi used\nhis linguistic, historical and humanistic skills to recover, study and\nmake available a great many sources which he believed (rightly or\nwrongly) to have dated from the pre-Platonic and pre-Socratic\nperiod. He may thus be said to have exemplified an interest in\ntwo themes prevalent in other Renaissance authors \u2013 the notion of\na \u201cperennial philosophy\u201d which reappears in different\nguises at different periods in the history of thought, and that of an\n\u201cancient theology\u201d traceable back to pre-Hellenic\ncivilizations (Schmitt 1966; Vasoli, 1981; Muccillo, 1996). His\nsystematic collection of pre-Aristotelian sources as part of his\nattempt to determine the Stagirite's true place in the history of\nphilosophy put valuable textual materials in the hands of future\ngenerations of scholars in a way that anticipated the modern\ncollections of resources in the last two centuries.\n\n\nPatrizi's concern with early sources was not strictly\nscholarly or historical, as can readily be seen by examining his works\nand the ways in which those texts were employed. An independent\nthinker, he was willing to consider as wide a range of views as\npossible on subjects of interest to him, whether they were scientific,\nphilosophical, historical, or dealt with concrete problems in\nengineering or hydrology. And he made use of them in his own way,\nunwilling to adhere unquestioningly to the theories and practices of\ncontemporaries who dealt with the same works in different ways. \nTo cite a concrete example, Patrizi accepted the authenticity of the\nbody of works attributed to the pseudo-Egyptian sage Hermes or\nMercurius Trismegistus, as had Marsilio Ficino before him and many of\nhis own contemporaries, such as Giordano Bruno (Yates 1964). He\nprinted some Hermetic works and the Chaldaean Oracles\nattributed to Zoroaster (Patrizi 1593). It was, ironically,\nwithin Patrizi's own lifetime that serious textual and historical\narguments would finally be put forward to undermine the authority of\nmany of these spurious works, and his own commitment to the\nauthenticity of the Hermetica can now be seen to have played a\nmajor role in leading some of his critics and defenders to single out\nand publicize some of the historical and textual grounds for rejecting\nthem as spurious (Purnell 2002; Mulsow, ed. 2002). \n\n\nBut what is most interesting is that Patrizi did not employ these\ntexts in the way that fanatical Hermeticists like Bruno did, who saw\ntherein a justification for the practice of spiritual and demonic magic\nand a basis for undermining the authority of the Christian church as a\n\u201ctriumphant beast\u201d, perverting the \u201ctrue\u201d\nreligion of the ancient Egyptians. Instead, Patrizi found in\nthose works themes which he felt would be echoed by \u201clater\u201d\nGreek authors such as Plato and his followers, adding additional\nsupport to their appeal. Yet it is clearly no coincidence that\nPatrizi's own difficulties with the Church over the Nova\n\u2026 Philosophia would occur while Bruno was languishing in\nprison in Rome prior to his execution in February 1600 and that Galileo\nGalilei and other innovative cosmologists would face similar\nconfrontations with the Congregation of the Index and the\nInquisition.\n\n\nGiven the \u201cretrospective\u201d character of the Renaissance\nin general, it is not surprising that what were believed to be the\noldest texts to have survived from antiquity would enjoy the audience\nthey did. Such works would have a profound effect on how the more\nfamiliar and \u201cstandard\u201d philosophical and scientific\nsources were interpreted. And the coupling of critical\nhistoriographical and etymological skills as developed by Renaissance\nhumanists with the philosophical and scientific interests of thinkers\nlike Patrizi would usher in a new age of systematic analysis of the\nintellectual legacy of the ancient world.\n",
