Locality and Special Relativity\nAccording to some interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, e.g., \n d\u2019Espagnat (2006),\nMaudlin (2011),\nthe quantum world is infested with nonlocal influences:\nsystems which are far apart, even spacelike separated in the sense of\nspecial relativity, can influence each other. This has given rise to\nthe notion that quantum theory is incompatible with special\nrelativity. No such nonlocal influences are present in the histories\ninterpretation, which is perfectly compatible with special\nrelativity. See the \nFurther Reading supplement for the detailed discussions\nunderlying the following remarks.\n\n\n",
