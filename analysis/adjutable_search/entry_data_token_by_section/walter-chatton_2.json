    "main_text": "The Anti-Razor || Ontological Commitment\n3.1 Ontological Commitment\n\nPhilosophers frequently disagree about what is real. Sometimes they\ndisagree so profoundly on this matter for so long a time that they see\nthemselves as members of schools or parties in a conflict, or as part\nof larger historical trends that play themselves out over and over in\nthe history of ideas. For example, some philosophers tend to argue for\nall kinds of invisible metaphysical structure in the world \u2013\nthat numbers, properties, causality, free will, etc., are all entities\nin their own right, somehow existing independently of our grasp or use\nof them, as real in their own way as the ordinary physical objects we\nseem constantly to rely on in daily life. We usually call such people\n\u2018realists\u2019. But others see this outlook as a theoretical\nextravagance, a needless proliferation of ontology. We tag partisans\nof such views \u2018nominalists\u2019.\n\nIt often happens that parties on either side of such debates will seek\nleverage against their opponents by articulating higher level rules\nmeant to govern metaphysics itself \u2013 rules meant to apply, not\nto the question \u2018What is real?\u2019, but instead to the\nquestion \u2018What methods of argument are rightly applied to the\nquestion \u201cWhat is real?\u201d\u2019 In other words,\nphilosophers sometimes argue not about what is real but about what is\nthe best way to argue about what is real. The goal is often negative:\nif a philosopher does not believe in the existence of some entity\n\\(X\\), he or she may try to show that a philosophical opponent leans\non a weak or irrational style of argumentation generally when arguing\nthat \\(X\\) exists. Occasionally such debates show an intense\nconnection with philosophy of language, since one common way to make a\nrealist argument that \\(X\\) exists is to say that, for instance,\ncertain sentences cannot be true or false unless entities like \\(X\\)\nexist. Under the influence of the articulate twentieth-century\nAmerican philosopher W. V. O. Quine, this issue \u2013 when and\nwhether certain facts about language require us to admit that certain\nkinds of entities exist \u2013 is often referred to as\n\u2018ontological commitment\u2019.\n\nQuine himself was a nominalist, as was Ockham. Both of them repudiated\ncertain realist styles of argumentation in the metaphysics of their\nown times. Ockham in particular was so famous for this attitude that\nwe still discuss reductionary explanatory tendencies under the label\n\u2018Ockham\u2019s razor\u2019 \u2013 do not multiply entities\nbeyond necessity.\n",
