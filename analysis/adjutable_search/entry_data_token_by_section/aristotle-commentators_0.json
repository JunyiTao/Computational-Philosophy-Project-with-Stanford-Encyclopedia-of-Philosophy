    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe primary purpose of a commentary is to explain a text. Typically,\nthe text is divided into lemmata (plural of lemma). A lemma is what is quoted from a\ntext in order to explain and interpret it. Some times the text is\nquoted in its entirety. Other times only its beginning is recalled.\nThe lemma is always followed by an analysis of the text. Commentaries\nwere not written exclusively on philosophical works. Any poetical or\nscientific work that came to be regarded as authoritative could become\nthe object of a commentary. For instance, the tradition of writing\ncommentaries on the Hippocratic corpus started very early. Although\nmost of this tradition is lost, the commentaries that Galen wrote on\nthe Hippocratic corpus have come down to us. Galen was a doctor who\nlived and wrote in the second half of the 2nd\ncentury CE. Interestingly enough, his exegetical activity was not\nconfined to Hippocrates. Galen wrote commentaries on several of\nAristotle\u2019s works, specifically on the De\nInterpretatione, the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics, and the Categories (Galen, On my Own\nBooks, XIX 47). In all probability, these commentaries were not\nintended for publication but only for the use of a small group of\nfriends and students. Here is what Galen says about his commentary on\nthe Categories:\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s work on The Ten Categories I had not\npreviously written any commentary, either for myself or for others;\nwhen subsequently somebody asked me for something on the solution\nposed on that work, <I wrote a commentary> with the firm\ninstruction that he should only show it to students who had already\nread the book with a teacher, or at least made a start with some other\ncommentaries, such as those of Adrastus and Aspasius (Galen, On My\nOwn Books, XIX 42, K\u00fchn, trans. Singer).\n\n\nGalen makes clear that he regards the commentator as a teacher and as\nan expositor of a text with an audience of students in mind. Moreover,\nas Galen presents the matter, the commentary was a teaching tool\naddressed to students with specific levels of knowledge. The students\nwho were expected to read Galen on the Categories were not\nabsolute beginners. They were students who either had previously\nbenefited from the study of this treatise with a teacher or had become\nacquainted with the Categories through some more elementary\ncommentaries. Galen refers to the commentaries written by Adrastus and\nAspasius. By so doing, he gives us an idea of the profusion of\ncommentaries that were written on the Categories. These\ncommentaries were written one after the other as part of an already\nconsolidated exegetical practice. Most of these commentaries have not\nreached us. We no longer have the commentaries that Adrastus and\nAspasius wrote on the Categories, nor do we have the\ncommentary that Galen wrote on the same treatise. This frustrating (at\nleast for us) fact is ultimately due to the very nature of this\nliterary production. Each generation of commentators read and\ninterpreted Aristotle in the light of their own theoretical\npreoccupations and proclivities, only to be replaced by the next\ngeneration of commentators. One remarkable exception is Alexander of\nAphrodisias, a younger contemporary of Galen. His commentaries survive\nbecause they were adopted as exemplary models by later commentators.\nBut not all of them have come down to us. For example, Alexander wrote\na commentary on the Categories (Simplicius, In Cat.\n1.16). This commentary suffered the same fate as those written by\nAdrastus, Aspasius, Galen, and others. Today it survives only in\nfragmentary form, incorporated in the commentaries that a later\ngeneration of interpreters wrote on the Categories. \n",
