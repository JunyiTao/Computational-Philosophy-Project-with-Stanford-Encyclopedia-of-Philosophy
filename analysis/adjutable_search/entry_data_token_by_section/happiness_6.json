    "main_text": "Theories of happiness || Hybrid accounts\n2.5 Hybrid accounts\n\nGiven the limitations of narrower theories of happiness, a hybrid\naccount such as a subjective well-being theory may seem an attractive\nsolution. This strategy has not been fully explored in the\nphilosophical literature, though Sumner\u2019s \u201clife\nsatisfaction\u201d theory may best be classified as a hybrid (1996;\nsee also Martin 2012). In any event, a hybrid approach draws\nobjections of its own. If we arrive at a hybrid theory by this route,\nit could seem like either the marriage of two unpromising accounts, or\nof a promising account with an unpromising one. Such a union may not\nyield wholesome results. Second, people have different intuitions\nabout what counts as happiness, so that no theory can accommodate all\nof them. Any theory that tries to thus risks pleasing no one. A third\nconcern is that the various components of any hybrid are liable to\nmatter for quite different reasons, so that happiness, thus\nunderstood, might fail to answer to any coherent set of concerns.\nAscriptions of happiness could be relatively uninformative if they\ncast their net too widely.\n",
