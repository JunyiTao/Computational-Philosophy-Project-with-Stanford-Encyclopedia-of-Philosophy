Introduction\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman represent themselves as\nthe first two members of a trilogy, which was to include a third\nmember, the Philosopher, a dialogue Plato never wrote. The\nconversations in the Sophist and Statesman take\nplace sequentially on a single day and are dramatically linked to the\nTheaetetus, which occurred on the previous day, shortly\nbefore Socrates\u2019 trial and death (Theaetetus 210d,\nSophist 216a). The Theaetetus and Sophist\nare also linked more remotely to the Parmenides, a\nconversation Socrates says he had with the great philosopher of Elea,\nwhen Parmenides was old and he was very young (Theaetetus\n183e\u2013184a, Sophist 217c). Socrates plays a minor role\nin the conversations in the Sophist and Statesman,\nobserving the proceedings but replaced as main speaker by a visitor\nfrom Elea, a follower of Parmenides, who converses with Theaetetus in\nthe Sophist and with a young man named Socrates (the Younger)\nin the Statesman.\n\n\nAlthough the Sophist and Statesman are dialogues, \nthe interaction between the Stranger and his two young interlocutors \nseems rather different from that between Socrates and his interlocutors\nin the Socratic dialogues, including the Theaetetus. In that\ndialogue Theaetetus distinguished himself as a highly promising \nstudent, who answered Socrates\u2019 questions resourcefully. The \nrespondents in the Sophist and Statesman are \ndocile by comparison, readily accepting the Stranger\u2019s arguments and \noccasionally asking him to explain, but rarely raising tough \nobjections or making good proposals of their own. Young Socrates in \nthe Statesman is particularly prone to misunderstandings and\nmistakes. Of all the respondents in Plato\u2019s dialogues, the \ninterlocutors in the Sophist and Statesman most \nclosely resemble the respondent in the second part of the \nParmenides, a young man named Aristotle (not the famous \nphilosopher), who never objects when he should, and who gives his \nmost enthusiastic assents when Parmenides\u2019 argument is most \nproblematic or obscure.\n\n\nThese dramatic features raise questions of philosophical importance. \nWhy does Plato connect the Sophist and Statesman \nwith the Theaetetus and Parmenides, dialogues \nwritten in all probability a good deal earlier? Why do the speakers \nkeep anticipating a third dialogue, the Philosopher \n(Sophist 216c\u2013217b, 253c\u2013254b; \nStatesman 257a\u2013c, 258b), on a topic plainly dear to \nPlato\u2019s heart, which he then never wrote? Why does Plato replace \nSocrates with the colorless visitor from Elea? Elsewhere Plato allows\nspeakers to give long speeches (e.g., Timaeus\u2019 cosmogony \nin the Timaeus), so why does the visitor engage in question \nand answer, given that he does most of the talking and his respondents seem\nunprepossessing and are chosen precisely because they are young and \nso likely to cause least trouble (cf. Sophist 217d with \nParmenides 137b)?\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman strike many scholars as \nmore dogmatic than other Platonic dialogues. The Stranger sets out to\ndefine the sophist, the statesman, and the philosopher, claiming that\nthey are three distinct kinds (Sophist 217a\u2013b); the two \nexisting dialogues appear to give successful definitions of their \ntarget kinds and to present and defend significant methodological and\nmetaphysical positions. The Sophist arguably solves the \nproblem of false statement, one of a family of problems that had \ndogged other Platonic dialogues, including the Theaetetus.\n\n\nPerhaps Plato replaces Socrates with the visitor from Elea because\nElea was the hometown of Parmenides, and in the Sophist Plato\nplans to criticize Parmenides\u2019 dictum that we cannot speak or think of\nwhat-is-not (Sophist 237a). Perhaps, too, readers are meant\nto recall the Parmenides, a dialogue staged some fifty years\nearlier, in which Parmenides himself led the conversation. After\ncriticizing Plato\u2019s middle period treatment of forms (inadequately\ndefended by a youthful Socrates), Parmenides announced that before\npositing forms Socrates should undertake rigorous philosophical\ntraining. In the second part of the dialogue, Parmenides then\ndemonstrated with a youthful respondent the sort of exercise he had in\nmind, focusing on another thesis for which he was famous, that there\nis only one thing (Parmenides 128a\u2013b, 137b). By using a\nvisitor from Elea, Plato invites his audience to recall Parmenides\u2019\nown positions and performance in that earlier dialogue. (For\ndiscussion of the dialogue form in these late works, cf. Frede 1996,\nRowe 1996, and C. Gill 1996).\n",
