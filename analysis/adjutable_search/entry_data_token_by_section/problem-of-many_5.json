    "main_text": "Partial Identity\n6. Partial Identity\n\nEven if o1 and o2 exist, and\nare clouds, and are not the same cloud, it does not immediately follow\nthat there are two clouds. If we analyze \u201cThere are two\nclouds\u201d as \u201cThere is an x and a y such\nthat x is a cloud and y is a cloud, and x\nis not the same cloud as y\u201d then the conclusion will\nnaturally follow. But perhaps that is not the correct analysis of\n\u201cThere are two clouds.\u201d Or, more cautiously, perhaps it is\nnot the correct analysis in all contexts. Following some suggestions\nof D. M. Armstrong\u2019s (Armstrong 1978, vol. 2: 37\u20138), David\nLewis suggests a solution along these lines. The objects\no1 and o2 are not the same\ncloud, but they are almost the same cloud. And in everyday\ncircumstances (AT) is a good-enough analysis of \u201cThere is one\ncloud\u201d\n\n(AT)\nThere is a cloud, and all clouds are almost identical\nwith it.\n\n\nAs Lewis puts it, we \u2018count by almost-identity\u2019 rather\nthan by identity in everyday contexts. And when we do, we get the\ncorrect result that there is one cloud in the sky. Lewis notes that\nthere are other contexts in which we count by some criteria other than\nidentity.\n\nIf an infirm man wishes to know how many roads he must cross to reach\nhis destination, I will count by identity-along-his-path rather than\nby identity. By crossing the Chester A. Arthur Parkway and Route 137\nat the brief stretch where they have merged, he can cross both by\ncrossing only one road. (Lewis 1976: 27)\n\n\nThere are two major objections to this theory. First, as Hudson notes,\neven if we normally count by almost-identity, we know how to count by\nidentity, and when we do it seems that there is one cloud in the sky,\nnot many millions. A defender of Lewis\u2019s position may say that\nthe only reason this seems intuitive is that it is normally intuitive\nto say that there is only one cloud in the sky. And that intuition is\nrespected! More contentiously, it may be argued that it is a\ngood thing to predict that when we count by identity we get\nthe result that there are millions of clouds. After all, the only time\nwe\u2019d do this is when we\u2019re doing metaphysics, and we have\nnoted that in the metaphysics classroom, there is some intuitive force\nto the argument that there are millions of clouds in the sky. It would\nbe a brave philosopher to endorse this as a virtue of the\ntheory, but it may offset some of the costs.\n\nSecondly, something like the Problem of the Many can arise even when\nthe possible objects are not almost identical. Lewis notes this\nobjection, and provides an illustrative example to back it up. A\nsimilar kind of example can be found in W. V. O. Quine\u2019s\nWord and Object (1960). Lewis\u2019s example is of a house\nwith an attached garage. It is unclear whether the garage is part of\nthe house or an external attachment to it. So it is unclear whether\nthe phrase \u2018Fred\u2019s house\u2019 denotes the basic house,\ncall it the home, or the fusion of the home and the garage. What is\nclear is that there is exactly one house here. However, the home might\nbe quite different from the fusion of the home and the garage. It will\nprobably be smaller and warmer, for example. So the home and the\nhome\u2013garage fusion are not even almost identical. Quine\u2019s\nexample is of something that looks, at first, to be a mountain with\ntwo peaks. On closer inspection we find that the peaks are not quite\nas connected as first appeared, and perhaps they could be properly\nconstrued as two separate mountains. What we could not say is that\nthere are three mountains here, the two peaks and their\nfusion, but since neither peak is almost identical to the other, or to\nthe fusion, this is what Lewis\u2019s solution implies.\n\nBut perhaps it is wrong to understand almost-identity in this way.\nConsider another example of Lewis\u2019s, one that Dan Lo\u0301pez de\nSa (2014) argues is central to a Lewisian solution to the problem.\n\nYou draw two diagonals in a square; you ask me how many triangles; I\nsay there are four; you deride me for ignoring the four large\ntriangles and counting only the small ones. But the joke is on you.\nFor I was within my rights as a speaker of ordinary language, and you\ncouldn\u2019t see it because you insisted on counting by strict\nidentity. I meant that, for some w, x, y,\nz, (1) w, x, y, and z are\ntriangles; (2) w and x are distinct, and \u2026 and so\nare y and z (six clauses); (3) for any triangle\nt, either t and w are not distinct, or \u2026\nor t and z are not distinct (four clauses). And by\n\u2018distinct\u2019 I meant non-overlap rather than non-identity,\nso what I said was true. (Lewis 1993, fn. 9)\n\n\nOne might think this is the general way to understand counting\nsentences in ordinary language. So There is exactly one F\ngets interpreted as There is an F, and no F is wholly distinct\nfrom it; and There are exactly two Fs gets interpreted\nas There are wholly distinct things x and y that are both F, and\nno F is wholly distinct from both of them, and so on. Lewis\nwrites as if this is an explication of the almost-identity proposal,\nbut this is at best misleading. A house with solar panels partially\noverlaps the city\u2019s electrical grid, but it would be very\nstrange to call them almost-identical. It sounds like a similar, but\ndistinct, proposed solution.\n\nHowever we understand the proposal, Lo\u0301pez de Sa notes that it\nhas a number of virtues. It seems to account for the puzzle involving\nthe house, what he calls the Problem of the Two. If in general\ncounting involves distinctness, then we have a good sense in which\nthere is one cloud in the sky, and Fred owns one house.\n\nThere still remain two challenges for this view. First, one could\nstill follow Hudson and argue that even if we ordinarily understand\ncounting sentences this way, we do still know how to count by\nidentity. And when we do, it seems that there is just one cloud, not\nmillions of them. Second, it isn\u2019t that clear that we always\ncount by distinctness, in the way L\u00f3pez de Sa suggests. If I\nsay there are three ways to get from my house to my office, I\ndon\u2019t mean to say that these three are completely distinct.\nIndeed, they probably all start with going out my door, down my\ndriveway etc., and end by walking up the stairs into my office. So the\ngeneral claim about how to understand counting sentences seems\nfalse.\n\nC. S. Sutton (2015) argued that we can get around something like the\nsecond of these problems if we do two things. First, the rule\nisn\u2019t that we don\u2019t normally quantify over things that\noverlap, just that we don\u2019t normally quantify over things that\nsubstantially overlap. We can look at a row of townhouses and say that\nthere are seven houses there even if the walls of the house overlap.\nSecond, the notion of overlap here is not sensitive to the quantity of\nmaterial that the objects have in common, but to their functional\nrole. If two objects play very different functional roles, she argues\nthat we will naturally count them as two, even if they have a lot of\nmaterial in common. This could account for a version of the getting to\nwork example where the three different ways of getting to work only\ndiffer on how to get through one small stretch in the middle. That is,\nif there are three (wholly distinct ways) to get from B to C, and the\nway to get from A to D is to go A-B-C-D, then there is a good sense in\nwhich there are three ways to get from A to D. Sutton\u2019s theory\nexplains how this could be true even if the B-C leg is a short part of\nthe trip.\n\nDavid Liebesman (2020) argued for a different way of implementing this\nkind of theory. He argues that the kinds of constraints that Lewis,\nL\u00f3pez de Sa and Sutton have suggested don\u2019t get\nincorporated into our theory of counting, but into the proper\ninterpretation of the nouns involved in counting sentences. It helps\nto understand Liebesman\u2019s idea with an example.\n\nThere is, we\u2019ll presumably all agree, just one colour in Yves\nKlein\u2019s\n Blue Monochrome.\n (It says so in the title.) But Blue Monochrome has blue in\nit, and it has ultramarine in it, and blue doesn\u2019t equal\nultramarine. What\u2019s gone on? Well, says Liebesman, whenever a\nnoun occurs under a determiner, it needs an interpretation. That\ninterpretation will almost never be maximal. When we ask how many\nanimals a person has in their house, we typically don\u2019t mean to\ncount the insects. When we say every book is on the shelf, we\ndon\u2019t mean every book in the universe. And typically, the\nrelevant interpretation of the determiner phrase (like \u2018every\nbook\u2019, or \u2018one cloud\u2019) will exclude overlapping\nobjects. Typically but not, says Liebesman, always. We can say, for\ninstance, that every shade of a colour is a colour, and in that\nsentence \u2018colour\u2019 includes both blue and ultramarine.\n\nThis offers a new solution to the Problem of the Many. He argues that\nall of 0 to 7 are true, but they are true for different\ninterpretations of phrases including the word \u2018cloud\u2019.\nWhen we interpret it in a way that rules out overlap, then 6 is false.\nWhen we interpret it in the maximal way, like the way we interpret\n\u2018colour\u2019 in Every shade of a colour is a colour,\nthen 2 is false. But to get the inconsistency, we have to equivocate.\nIt\u2019s an easy equivocation to make, since each of the meanings is\none that we frequently use.\n",
