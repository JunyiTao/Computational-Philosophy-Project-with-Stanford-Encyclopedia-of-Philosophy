In\ngeneral proof theory, \u201cproofs are studied in their own right in\nthe hope of understanding their nature\u201d, in contradistinction to\nHilbert-style \u201creductive proof theory\u201d, which is the\n\u201cattempt to analyze the proofs of mathematical theories with the\nintention of reducing them to some more elementary part of mathematics\nsuch as finitistic or constructive mathematics\u201d (Prawitz, 1972,\np. 123). In a similar way, Kreisel (1971) asks for a re-orientation of\nproof theory. He wants to explain \u201crecent work in proof theory\nfrom a neglected point of view. Proofs and their representations by\nformal derivations are treated as principal objects of study, not as\nmere tools for analyzing the consequence relation.\u201d (Kreisel,\n1971, p. 109) Whereas Kreisel focuses on the dichotomy between a\ntheory of proofs and a theory of provability, Prawitz concentrates on\nthe different goals proof theory may pursue. However, both stress the\nnecessity of studying proofs as fundamental entities by means of which\nwe acquire demonstrative (especially mathematical) knowledge. This\nmeans in particular that proofs are epistemic entities which should\nnot be conflated with formal proofs or derivations. They are rather\nwhat derivations denote when they are considered to be representations\nof arguments. (However, in the following we often use\n\u201cproof\u201d synonymously with \u201cderivation\u201d,\nleaving it to the reader to determine whether formal proofs or proofs\nas epistemic entities are meant.) In discussing Prawitz\u2019s (1971)\nsurvey, Kreisel (1971, p. 111) explicitly speaks of a\n\u201cmapping\u201d between derivations and mental acts, and\nconsiders it a task of proof theory to elucidate this mapping,\nincluding the investigation of the identity of proofs, a topic that\nPrawitz and Martin-L\u00f6f had put on the proof-theoretic agenda.\n\nThis means that in general proof theory we are not solely interested\nin whether \\(B\\) follows from \\(A\\), but in the way by means of which\nwe arrive at \\(B\\) starting from \\(A\\). In this sense general proof\ntheory is intensional and epistemological in character, whereas model\ntheory, which is interested in the consequence relation and not in the\nway of establishing it, is extensional and metaphysical.\n",
