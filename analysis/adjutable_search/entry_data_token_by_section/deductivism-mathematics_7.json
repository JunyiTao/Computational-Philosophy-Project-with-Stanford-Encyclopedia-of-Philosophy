    "main_text": "Historical Accounts || Intuitionism and Brouwer\n3.5 Intuitionism and Brouwer\n\nIntuitionism is sometimes spoken of in the same breath as deductivism.\nCurry, for example, maintains that\n\n\nIndeed, if we subtract from intuitionism its metaphysics, the\ndifferences between it and formalism as to the definition of\nmathematical truth are superficial. The emphasis on constructive\nmethods\u2014Hilbert\u2019s \u201cfinite\nEinstellung\u201d\u2014on recursive definitions and mathematical\ninduction, are made by formalist and intuitionist alike. (1951:\n58)\n\n\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionism is related to deductivism but differs\nfrom it in an interesting way. What, briefly, are the similarities and\ndifferences?\n\nIn his Cambridge lectures, Brouwer rejects \u201cmathematical\ncreation by means of logical axioms\u201d (1981: 7). Indeed, for him,\n\u201call axioms became illusory\u201d (1981: 92). Brouwer\u2019s\ntarget here is what he calls the \u201cOld Formalist School\u201d,\nwhich for him includes Dedekind, Peano, Russell and Hilbert, and from\nwhich he goes to lengths to distance himself. For Brouwer, \u201cthe\ncriterion of truth or falsehood of a mathematical assertion\u201d is\nnot a deduction but \u201cmathematical activity itself\u201d\n(Brouwer 1981: 92). The relevant activity is the process of providing\na construction. Thus, for the intuitionist, truth and falsehood are\nreplaced with, or cashed out as, the existence or absence of an\nintuitionistically acceptable construction (Brouwer 1981: 92).\n\nConstructions are a series of mental acts; they are thus distinct from\nproofs which are sequences of appropriately linked sentences. For\nBrouwer, the first act of intuitionism is to completely\nseparate \u201cmathematics from mathematical language and hence from\nthe phenomena of language described by theoretical logic\u201d (1981:\n4). For Brouwer, no linguistic inscription or utterance can convey the\ntrue nature of a construction in intuition. The severance of\nmathematics from language and logic, a cornerstone of Brouwer\u2019s\nintuitionism, sharply distinguishes it from deductivism.\n\nThat said, intuitionism does have some parallels with deductivism. A\nnotable one is the replacement of the usual referential account of\ntruth in mathematics with a verification-based approach: deductivism\ndoes this in terms of proofs, intuitionism in terms of constructions.\nThe development of intuitionistic logic brings out an important fact\nabout deductivism: deductivism is not tied to any particular formal\nsystem. It could be based on classical logic, or Heyting\u2019s\nintuitionist formal system, or some third\n alternative.[9]\n",
