    "main_text": "Analyzing Morally Significant Social Issues || Bad Norms\n5.2 Bad Norms\n\nIf nuclear conflict was the first morally significant social issue to\nbe extensively analyzed using game theoretic tools, in the recent\nphilosophical literature it has been the analysis of harmful,\ndestructive, and wasteful norms where game theoretic tools have been\nmost prevalent. Specifically game theoretic tools have been used to\nexplain: 1) what bad norms are, 2) when and why they emerge, and 3)\nwhether they can be changed, and, if so, how.\n\nOf these topics, the question of what distinguishes good norms from\nbad norms has received by far the least attention (a notable exception\nis Thrasher 2018). One explanation for this is that it is often taken\nto be obvious that certain norms are bad. For instance, honor killings\nhave received extensive attention in the norms literature, and,\nperhaps unsurprisingly, such killings are typically assumed to provide\na clear instance of a harm that violates the rights of at least some\nof those subjected to the practice. Instead of focusing on what makes\nhonor norms bad, then, the literature has tended to focus on why such\nnorms emerge and how they might be changed.\n\nTo answer these questions game theoretic tools have been used to\ncharacterize the underlying social dynamics that give rise to the\npractice in question, and to then illustrate how the practice is\nresponsive to these dynamics. A dynamic common to several of these\npractices is the role norms play in signaling a group\u2019s\ncommitment to certain values or courses of action. For example, in the\ncase of honor killing, when these killings target members of an\noutgroup, they might deter future slights at the hands of the outgroup\nby signaling the ingroup\u2019s commitment to seeking revenge for\n(real or perceived) slights (Boehm 1986; Nisbett & Cohen 1996;\nSkarbek 2014; Thrasher & Handfield 2018). This can be especially\nimportant in the absence of strong institutions that maintain public\norder. However, one thing that makes honor norms bad, is that a\ngroup\u2019s commitment to seeking revenge for slights can risk\nsetting off (or perpetuating) a cycle of violence.\n\nHonor killings can also be directed towards members of one\u2019s own\ngroup who violate certain norms. For instance, there are many places\nwhere it is not uncommon for members of a family to kill children\n(especially girls) who break norms of sexual morality or who otherwise\nfail to adhere to traditional gender norms. In these cases the desire\nof a group\u2019s members to adhere to such norms is typically\nexplained by the belief that doing so makes members of the group more\nattractive marriage partners, and the role honor killings play is to\nsignal that the family (or group to which the family belongs) is\ncommitted to the norm(s) in question (United Nations Population Fund\n2000; Chesler & Bloom 2012; Skarbek 2014; Thrasher & Handfield\n2018). In some circumstances, though, a group\u2019s commitment to a\nnorm may be driven by pluralistic ignorance. That is, there\nare cases where two (or more) groups may each be engaged in a practice\nlike footbinding or female genital cutting that they themselves would\nprefer not to engage in, but where they remain committed to the norm\non the basis of the mistaken belief that other groups are committed to\nthe norm (Bicchieri & Fukui 1999; Bicchieri 2017). Here\nunderstanding the conditional nature of each group\u2019s preferences\nis crucial to identifying the role played by pluralistic ignorance in\nsustaining the norm in question, while understanding the role of\npluralistic ignorance in sustaining the norm helps explain why it is\nbad.\n\nIn addition to helping identify why a norm might be bad and what\nsustains it, game theoretic analysis can also help us identify when\nand how such norms might be changed. For example, in the case of\npractices sustained by pluralistic ignorance, the key to changing the\npractices lies in changing the beliefs of multiple groups. As game\ntheoretic analysis illustrates, though, it may be that this is only\npossible if each group publicly and simultaneously signals to the\nother that they do not in fact have an unconditional preference for\nengaging in the practice in question. This is because, without knowing\nthat their beliefs about the other group\u2019s normative commitments\nare mistaken, if one group is asked to reveal their preferences\nunilaterally, whatever motivates their conditional preference is\nlikely to give them reason to conceal their true preferences\n(Bicchieri 2017).\n\nAlternatively, game theoretic analysis can also help us understand\npractices like open defecation which seem to be sustained not by\npluralistic ignorance, but by a strong commitment to norms that\noutweigh the concern of individuals or communities for things like\npublic health. For instance, in rural India where open defecation is\ncommon, the practice tends to be sustained by purity norms that\ninteract with caste systems in ways that make communities reluctant to\nutilize latrines even when they are made available. Combating the\npublic health crises exacerbated by open defection is thus not only a\nmatter of building the requisite infrastructure, but of undermining\nthe prevailing norms that prevent the infrastructure from being\nutilized (Coffey & Spears 2017), and of incentivizing individuals\nto police new norms that promote better sanitation practices\n(Bicchieri 2017). And, in such cases, game theoretic analysis allows\nus to see how the relevant behaviors might be incentivized.\n\nThe analysis of bad norms isn\u2019t just limited to cases where the\nnorms in question are clearly the culprit in bringing about bad\noutcomes, though. Game theory can also tell us about the ways in which\nseemingly innocent norms and preferences can give rise to bad\noutcomes. Perhaps the most famous example of this is Schelling\u2019s\n(1971) model of segregation which helps illustrate why segregation can\nbe so difficult to combat. Schelling showed that even when agents\ndon\u2019t mind living alongside members of other groups, even very\nminimal preferences for having some neighbors like oneself can lead to\nindividuals sorting themselves into relatively segregated communities\nover time. For example, Figure 15 below shows how a group of\nindividual agents randomly distributed around a grid will segregate\nthemselves over time when individual agents have preferences for being\nsurrounded by certain thresholds of neighbors like\n them.[21]\n Here Figure 15a depicts a random initial distribution on a \\(20\\times\n20\\) grid, where 10% of squares are empty in order to facilitate\nmovement, and there are two types of agent in equal proportion to one\nanother. Figure 15b depicts the sorting that occurs if agents prefer\nto be surrounded by neighbors of whom at least 20% are like them.\nFigure 15c shows how things change when the threshold is increased to\njust 30%. And Figure 15d shows what things are like when the threshold\nis 50%.\n\n\n\n\na. Initial Distribution\n\n\n\n\nb. 20% Threshold\n\n\n\n\nc. 30% Threshold\n\n\n\n\nd. 50% Threshold\n\n\nFigure 15. Schelling Segregation Models\n[An\n extended description of figure 15\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIf we compare Figures 15a and 15b we see that when agents have a\npreference to have at least 1 out of every 5 of their neighbors be\nlike them, the distribution isn\u2019t substantially impacted.\nHowever, if we compare Figures 15a and 15b to Figure 15c we see that\nwhen that threshold is increased from 20% to 30% the agents become\nsignificantly segregated. And by the time the threshold reaches 50%\nagents have been sorted into almost completely homogeneous\nneighborhoods. In other words, even when agents have no objection to\nthe vast majority of their neighbors being different from them (in the\ncase of Figure 15c, as many as 70%), a preference to have just some\nneighbors like oneself can have massive distributional consequences,\nand in addition to being unintended these may be undesirable. However,\nwhile we might criticize the underlying preferences in light of these\nconsequences, and there may be thresholds for neighborhood composition\nthat seem obviously discriminatory, when the preference in question is\nto have just 30% of one\u2019s neighbors be like oneself (in a world\nwith only two groups) it\u2019s far from obvious that this preference\nis objectionable.\n",
