    "main_text": "Truth Conditions Revisited || Heuristics and Semantics\n4.4 Heuristics and Semantics\n\nI shall discuss only briefly a recently published book by Timothy\nWilliamson, Suppose and Tell (2020). Williamson accepts that\nthe suppositional procedure\u2014suppose the antecedent, and on that\nbasis come to a judgement about the consequent\u2014is our\nfundamental, primary method of conditional judgement, an essential\npart of our cognitive equipment. As uncertainty is often involved, he\naccepts that it is appropriate to theorize about this process in terms\nof conditional probabilities. This is what he calls the\nheuristics of conditionals (not to be confused with\nsemantics). Heuristics are part of our cognitive and psychological\napparatus, \u201cfast and frugal\u201d, immensely useful and\nvaluable, but typically imperfect. In this case, they lead to subtle\nlogical problems, he argues (ch. 3), broadly of the same kind as\nLewis\u2019s triviality results\u2014indeed, to inconsistencies. An\nassessment of these arguments will have to wait for another occasion.\nNevertheless, he claims, they are useful and valuable for our everyday\nconditional thinking. \n\nAlso, he argues, this primary heuristic is sometimes at odds with a\nsecondary heuristic\u2014acquiring conditional beliefs by testimony.\nOften this is unproblematic, but, as Gibbard (1981) showed, two people\nwith different background knowledge can flawlessly come to opposite\njudgements about whether if \\(A, B\\). They then convey their\njudgements to a third person, who trusts them, but who cannot accept\nboth judgements, using the suppositional procedure. \n\nHere is Gibbard\u2019s example: two henchmen, Zack and Jack, observe\na poker game, between Sly Pete and Mr Stone. Zack sees Stone\u2019s\nhand, and signals its contents to Pete. He knows that Pete won\u2019t\ncall unless he has the winning hand. Jack sees both hands, and sees\nthat Pete does not have the winning hand. The room is cleared.\nOutside, Zack hands a note to the boss which says \u201cIf Pete\ncalled, he won\u201d. Jack hands a note to the boss which says\n\u201cIf Pete called, he lost\u201d. Boss trusts them both, and\nconcludes that Pete did not call. But Boss cannot simply take over\nboth conditionals as suppositional judgements on the supposition that\nPete called: if one gets a high value, the other gets a low value.\n(Nor can Boss think that in the nearest world in which Pete called, he\nlost and he won.) Williamson has several variants of examples of this\nstructure. (As some have pointed out, Gibbard\u2019s example is\nperhaps not perfectly symmetric, as Jack\u2019s judgement might seem\nthe most securely based; but plenty of perfectly symmetric examples\nhave since been given.) \n\nThe truth-functional, material conditional turns out to be useful\nhere. The suppositional conditional entails the truth-functional\nconditional. Zack is committed to \u201cPete called \\(\\supset\\) Pete\nwon\u201d, i.e., either Pete didn\u2019t call, or he won. Jack is\ncommitted to \u201cPete called \\(\\supset\\) Pete lost\u201d, i.e.,\neither Pete didn\u2019t call, or he lost. From both, it\nstraightforwardly follows that Pete didn\u2019t call. The\ntruth-functional conditional is the strongest proposition\nwhich gets transmitted by conditional testimony. Testimony, at its\nbest, concerns the transmission of facts; and we can always resort to\nthe truth-functional conditional as a fact that gets transmitted by a\nreliable conditional statement, when problems arise from the differing\nbackground knowledge of our informants (as suppositionalists can\nagree). \n\nThis is one of the reasons why Williamson argues that the\nsemantics of the conditional is best treated as the truth\nfunction. The semantics is not something which every speaker knows, or\nis readily available to them. We do not learn to use \u201cif\u201d\nvia the truth table. And we know that no semantic theory of the\nconditional is obviously correct! The probabilities generated\nby the semantics are typically higher, and never lower than the\nprobabilities generated by our basic suppositional procedure for\nassessing conditionals. Nevertheless, he argues, the truth-functional\nsemantics does the best job of rationalizing our overall practice.\n\n\nWilliamson gives other examples of useful but imperfect heuristics.\nOne concerns vagueness, and the so-called \u201ctolerance\nprinciples\u201d, such as \u201cIf \\(n\\) seconds after noon is\nnoonish, \\(n+1\\) seconds after noon is noonish\u201d. That is a\nuseful rule of thumb, though not all of its instances can be true. For\nthe epistemicist, one instance is false, but we don\u2019t know\nwhich. On other views, all are at least very close to clearly true,\nbut not all are clearly true. Another example is the problem the Liar\nParadox presents for the principle that it is true that \\(P\\) if and\nonly if \\(P\\). In both cases, the exceptions are rare and can normally\nbe overlooked. He also mentions the heuristics involved in perceptual\njudgements, normally very reliable, which sometimes lead us astray.\n\u201cHumans predictably resort to fast and frugal heuristics,\nreliable enough under normal conditions, but not perfectly\nreliable\u201d he says, (p. 265). \n\nHowever, in the case of uncertain conditionals, it is hard to accept\nthat the heuristics are \u201creliable enough under normal\nconditions\u201d, when combined with the truth-functional semantics.\nWhen the conditional is certain, the suppositional procedure and the\ntruth function agree. They also agree in the relatively uninteresting\ncase in which the antecedent is certain. In all other cases, the\ntruth-functional conditional gets a higher value than the\nsuppositional conditional, and the difference between them can be\narbitrarily large. Many examples have already been given (see\n\u00a7\u00a72.3, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2). Another simple example: how likely is\nit that if the die lands an even number, it lands 6? Most people,\nrightly in my view, will answer 1/3. If the conditional is a material\nimplication, the answer is 2/3: if it lands 1, 3, 5 or 6, the\nconditional is true. As already mentioned, all conditionals whose\nantecedents are improbable, are probable as judged by the truth\nfunction. \n\nAnother example: we are planning a trip in a couple of days, and\nwondering whether \n\n(*) if it snows the night before, the road will be impassable. \n\nThe probability of snow is around 0.5; and we reckon (on the\nsuppositional procedure), it\u2019s around 0.2 that the road will be\nimpassable if it snows. According to the truth function, the\nconditional gets 0.6. Then, as forecasts are updated, the probability\nof snow decreases. Nothing else changes. On the truth-functional\nsemantics, the probability of our conditional goes up as the\nprobability of snow goes down: when the probability of snow goes down\nto 0.25, the probability of (*) is 0.8 on the truth-functional\nreading, although it remains at 0.2 on the suppositional approach.\nWilliamson says that our suppositional procedure errs \u201con the\nside of caution\u201d (p. 104) by generating lower probability values\nthan the truth-functional conditional. It is hard to see why, as the\nprobability of snow decreases, we become more risk-averse, and make\nlarger errors on the side of caution. \n",
