    "main_text": "The unity of theoretical and practical reason || The maxims of reason\n3.2 The maxims of reason\n\nKant sets out three \u201cmaxims of reason\u201d or \u201cmaxims of\ncommon human understanding.\u201d They appear twice in his published\nwritings, in relation to both acting and\n thinking.[30]\n These maxims are closely related to the Categorical Imperative. (For\ndiscussion, see O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 2 & 1992, and Neiman 1994:\nCh. 5.)\n\nIn his last published work, the Anthropology (1798), Kant\npresents the maxims in a practical context, as guidelines for\nachieving some degree of wisdom:\n\nWisdom, as the idea of a practical use of reason that\nconforms perfectly with the law, is no doubt too much to demand of\nhuman beings. But also, not even the slightest degree of wisdom can be\npoured into a man by others; rather he must bring it forth from\nhimself. The precept for reaching it contains three leading maxims:\n(1) Think for oneself, (2) Think into the place of the other [person]\n(in communication with human beings), (3) Always think consistently\nwith oneself. (7:200; cf. 228f)\n\n\nThe maxims also appear in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790). Here, Kant relates them to the\ntheoretical use of reason. A famous section describes human\nbeings\u2019 capacity for a sensus communis or\n\u201ccommunity sense\u201d:\n\na faculty for judging that\u2026 takes account (a priori) of\neveryone else\u2019s way of representing in thought, in order as\nit were to hold its judgment up to human reason as a whole and\nthereby avoid the illusion which, from subjective private conditions\nthat could easily be held to be objective, would have a detrimental\ninfluence on the judgment. (5:293)\n\n\nThat is, the maxims are precepts for judging in accordance with\n\u201creason as a whole\u201d and avoiding the distortions that\narise from \u201csubjective private conditions.\u201d\n\nKant describes (1) thinking for oneself as the maxim of\nunprejudiced thought; its opposite is passivity in thought,\nleading to prejudice and superstition. Kant also labels this\n\u201cheteronomy,\u201d clearly recalling his interpretation of\nreason and morality in terms of autonomy\n (4:433).[31]\n (2) To think in the place of everyone else is the maxim of\nenlarged or broad-minded thought. And (3) always to\nthink in accord with oneself is the maxim of consistent\nthought (5:294).\n\nThe last maxim may sound more straightforward, but Kant emphasizes its\ndifficulty. Consistency \u201ccan only be achieved through the\ncombination of the first two and after frequent observance of them has\nmade them automatic\u201d (5:295). Consistency does not just involve\ngetting rid of obvious contradictions in explicit beliefs. It also\nrequires consistency with regard to the implications of our\nbeliefs\u2014and these are often not apparent to us. To achieve this\nsort of law-likeness in thought requires genuine attempts (1)\nto judge for oneself and the determination (2) to expose one\u2019s\njudgments to the scrutiny of others. In other words, a person must try\nto make themselves: (1) really the author of their judgments;\n(2) accountable to others; and (3) consistent in\ntheir claims. We must take responsibility for our\njudgments.\n\nThe maxims support the thesis that theoretical and practical reasoning\nhave a unified structure. In particular, they flesh out the\nimplications of the Categorical Imperative. The imperative demands\nrespect for \u201cthe mere form of law\u201d\u2014consistency,\nlaw-likeness, and autonomy in thought and action. Equally, it demands\nrespect for other people as fellow reasoners and\n\u201cends-in-themselves\u201d (Russell 2020, Lenczewska 2021). As a\nmatter of thought, reasoning requires us to discipline our judgments\nso that others can follow them. As a matter of practical wisdom,\nreasoning requires us to discipline our actions so that others can\nadopt the same guiding principles.\n",
