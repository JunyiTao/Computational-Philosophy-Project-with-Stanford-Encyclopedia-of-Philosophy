Regress and Theoretical Virtues\n\nBliss and Priest, as we have seen, argue that while an ontological\ninfinite regress might leave some questions unanswered, there is\nnothing inherently objectionable, incoherent, or inconsistent in an\ninfinite regress of things each of which is ontologically dependent on\nthe next. However, even if such ontological infinite regresses are\npossible, some metaphysicians argue that we may have good reason to\nthink that the actual world is not like that.\n\nNolan (2001) and Cameron (2008) argue that considerations of\ntheoretical parsimony can lead us to reject ontological infinite\nregresses even if such regresses are not metaphysically impossible. A\ntheory that yields an ontological infinite regress of course thereby\nyields an infinite ontology. Even if we are not in the situation\n(discussed above in section 1.2) where we have independent knowledge\nthat we are dealing with a finite domain, this could still be a mark\nagainst the theory, simply on the grounds that it is an unparsimonious\nontology. So for example, we might object to the claim that material\nobjects are gunky\u2014with each part of them being divisible into\nfurther proper parts\u2014not because there\u2019s any inconsistency\nin the hypothesis, or because it leads to an infinite chain of\nontological dependence and thereby leaves the existence of all things\nunexplained, but simply because it means that whenever there is an\nobject somewhere, there are in fact infinitely many objects there. A\ngunky world is an ontologically extravagant world, and so we have the\nsame kind of reason to reject the hypothesis that things are gunky as\nwe have to reject needlessly complex hypotheses about how things\nbehave (e.g., the Ptolemaic theory of planetary motion with its\nepicycle upon epicycle): other things being equal, we should prefer\nsimpler theories and more economical ontologies over complex theories\nand more expansive ontologies.\n\nTo illustrate, Nolan considers the famous example of someone\nsuggesting that the Earth is held up by resting on the back of a giant\nturtle, which is in turn held up by resting on the back of another\nturtle, which is in turn \u2026 and so on, turtles all the way down.\nThere does not appear to be an inconsistency hiding in this regress,\nnor does it thwart an attempt at analysis. For all we know, space is\ninfinite, so there\u2019s no problem fitting all these turtles in, so\nwe\u2019re not in a case where we know independently that we\u2019re\ndealing with a finite domain. This is not a regress that involves\nontological dependence, so there are no concerns about the existence\nof things going ungrounded. Of course, we have pretty good empirical\nevidence that the infinite turtles hypothesis is false, since we have\ngone into space and can\u2019t see any world turtles. But even\nputting that aside\u2014let\u2019s suppose we\u2019re considering\nthe hypothesis prior to our going into space\u2014there is something\nintuitively weird about the turtles hypothesis. Nolan suggests it is\nthe ontological extravagance of the view. He says (2011,\n534\u20135)\n\n\n[T]he two turtle theory [the world rests on a turtle, which rests on\nanother turtle, which is unsupported] is stranger and more absurd than\nthe one turtle theory, the three turtle theory worse than the two, a\ntwenty-eight turtle theory worse even than the three, an exactly seven\nmillion turtle theory loonier still, and so on. The infinite turtle\ntheory, while perhaps more motivated than the finite turtle theories,\nseems to be in some respects the limit of an increasing sequence of\nabsurdity.\n\n\nNot everyone will agree that each additional turtle theory is more\nobjectionable than the last, since the extra things being postulated\nare of the same kind (world turtles) as the previous theory already\ncountenanced. David Lewis (1973, 87), e.g., held that while we should\nprefer theories that are more qualitatively\nparsimonious\u2014they postulate fewer kinds of thing than\ntheir rivals\u2014there is no reason at all to prefer theories that\nare merely more quantitatively parsimonious\u2014they\npostulate fewer things of the same kind as their rivals. This\nis controversial, however, and Nolan (1997) argues that quantitative\nparsimony is a genuine reason to prefer a theory. If Nolan is correct,\nthe four turtle theory is indeed worse than the three turtle theory,\nthe ten turtle theory worse still, and the infinite turtle theory\nworse (other things being equal) than any finite turtle theory.\n\nCameron applies considerations of theoretical parsimony to the case of\ninfinite chains of ontological dependence. While allowing that there\nis no impossibility in an infinite regress of things, each\nontologically dependent on the next, Cameron argues that we can still\nhave reason to reject such a theory on parsimony considerations.\nCameron (2008, 12) says that what needs to be explained is the\nexistence of each dependent entity; and while he allows that in an\ninfinitely descending chain of ontologically dependent entities, there\nis an explanation for why each dependent entity exists, there is no\nsingle explanation for why all the dependent entities exist.\nWhereas if there is a collection of fundamental entities on which all\nthe dependent entities ultimately depend, these fundamental entities\nprovide a single unified explanation for why every dependent entity\nexists. Either way, everything that needs to be explained gets\nexplained, but Cameron says we have reason to prefer the unified\nexplanation over the infinitely many disparate explanations, since it\nis in general a theoretical virtue to provide a unified explanation.\nFor example, a physical theory that postulates one unified force to\nexplain all phenomena would, other things being equal, be preferable\nto one that postulates four fundamental forces\u2014gravity,\nelectromagnetism, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear\u2014even if the\ntwo theories explain exactly the same phenomena. (Orilia (2009)\nargues, contra Cameron, that there is no unified explanation provided\nby Metaphysical Foundationalism over theories with infinite\nontological descent.)\n\nIf Nolan and Cameron are right it at most gives us a pro\ntanto reason to reject a theory that leads to an ontological\ninfinite regress. Just as we can justifiably accept the more complex\nhypothesis over the simpler one because the more complex hypothesis is\nmore powerful (e.g.), so we might justifiably accept an ontological\ninfinite regress because there is some virtue afforded by the theory\nthat makes the cost worthwhile. Relatedly, Cameron (2008, 13\u201314)\nargues that this would not give us any reason to think that\nontological infinite regresses are metaphysically impossible, at most\nit gives us a reason to think they are not actual, which limits the\npositions that such regress arguments can be used to argue for.\n",
