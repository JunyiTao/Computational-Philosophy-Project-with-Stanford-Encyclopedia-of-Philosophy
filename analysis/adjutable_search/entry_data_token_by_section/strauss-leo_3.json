    "main_text": "The Theologico-Political Predicament of Modernity\n4. The Theologico-Political Predicament of Modernity\n\nIn the 1965 preface to the English translation of Spinoza\u2019s\nCritique of Religion, Strauss describes the beginnings of his\nintellectual journey by stating that \u201cThis study of\nSpinoza\u2019s Theologico-Political Treatise was written\nduring the years 1925\u201328 in Germany. The author was a young Jew\nborn and raised in Germany who found himself in the grip of the\ntheologico-political predicament\u201d (SCR, p. 1). Also in 1965\nStrauss\u2019s The Political Philosophy of Hobbes was\npublished, with a new preface by the author, for the first time in\nGerman. There Strauss refers to the \u201ctheologico-political\nproblem,\u201d deeming it \u201cthe theme of my\nstudies\u201d (GS 3, p. 8).\n\nStrauss employs the term \u201ctheological-political\npredicament,\u201d to diagnose what he contends are the devastating\nphilosophical, theological, and political consequences of the early\nmodern attempt to separate theology from politics. However, Strauss in\nno way favors a return to theocracy or, like his contemporary Carl\nSchmitt, a turn toward political theology. Instead, Strauss attempts\nto recover classical political philosophy not to return to the\npolitical structures of the past but to reconsider ways in which\npre-modern thinkers thought it necessary to grapple and live with the\ntensions, if not contradictions that, by definition, arise from human\nsociety. For Strauss, a recognition, and not a resolution, of the\ntensions and contradictions that define human society is the necessary\nstarting point for philosophically reconstructing a philosophy,\ntheology, and politics of moderation, all of which, he claims, the\ntwentieth-century desperately needs.\n",
