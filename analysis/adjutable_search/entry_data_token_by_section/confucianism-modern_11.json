    "main_text": "Human Nature and the Person || The Transcendental Self Manifested in Affective Connection\n4.3 The Transcendental Self Manifested in Affective Connection\n\nAlthough he is not typically considered a Kantian, Tang Junyi also\ndistinguishes two selves. There is a true self, which he usually calls\nthe transcendental self (chaoyue ziwo\n\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u6211) (or transcendent; Tang did not\nconsistently distinguish \u201ctranscendent\u201d and\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d, using chaoyue \u8d85\u8d8a\nfor both) or moral self (daode ziwo\n\u9053\u5fb7\u81ea\u6211). Then there is an empirical self\n(jingyan ziwo \u7d93\u9a57\u81ea\u6211 or xianshi\nziwo \u73fe\u5be6\u81ea\u6211) (Pong 2008; Ro\u0161ker\n2016: 94). Human nature is to be identified with the transcendental\nself, not the empirical self of desires (S. Y. Chan 2002:\n306\u20137). However, his route to demonstrating the reality of the\nmoral self is very different.\n\nThe overarching theme of Tang\u2019s philosophy is interdependence in\nthe form of affective connection. The primary way he supports the\nexistence of the transcendental self is the reality of affective\nconnection with other existents, especially people. It is the basis of\nmorality for Tang (Chiu 2016: 155; Van den Stock 2016: 250). The\nempirical self of desires is self-centered: it attempts to use the\nworld to fulfill its desires. Insofar as our actions recognize the\nequal subjectivity of other people, we transcend the narrow self and\nrealize the transcendental self (TJCW 9: 38). This is not a universal\nself (Metzger 2005: 220). Tang was clear that he departed from Fichte\nin not merging people into a great self (TJCW 25: 1.506).\nPeople have desires, but they have other sorts of feelings and\nmotives, what Tang calls the feelings from human nature\n(xingqing\n \u6027\u60c5):[3]\n\n\nPeople truly have a kind of feeling from human nature that surpasses\nindividual life and finds completion in affective connection with\npeople and things. (TJCW 9: 97)\n\n\nThis is what the goodness of human nature means.\n\nOne of the main ways that Tang illustrates the reality of the\ntranscendental self that connects to others is through pointing out\nhow human practice presupposes the reality and value of other people\nas subjects. Cultural activities\u2014including economy, politics,\nscience, philosophy, art, and much more\u2014are all ways in which,\nusually unconsciously, the moral self manifests through affective\nconnection which treats other people as subjects (Ro\u0161ker 2016:\n156; Van den Stock 2016: 339). Put somewhat differently, culture is\nabout establishing the world of moral personality, which is\nKant\u2019s kingdom of ends (TJCW 12: Preface, 13). Here he was\ninspired by Fichte and British idealism (Metzger 2005: 215\u201316;\nTseng 2019: 838). Culture is an attempt to realize certain ideals in\nthe world in a conscious way, and Tang asserts that anyone who\nconsciously holds and tries to realize an ideal reveals their\ntranscendental self. Having an ideal involves a notion of how one\nwants oneself and the world to be, and assumes that one has the\nfreedom and ability to try to bring this about. It means transcending\nexisting reality and thinking about and working toward how to make it\nbetter, and this reveals the transcendental self mastering the\nempirical self (TJCW 12: 3\u20139). As Tang\u2019s method for\ndemonstrating this is the same for all cultural activities, one\nexample will suffice to illustrate it, the example of science.\n\nThe usual belief in modern Confucianism is that science is\ninstrumentally valuable, because scientific discoveries can lead to\nimprovements in people\u2019s lives (Xu 1952 [2022: 117\u201323]).\nTang recognizes that science can be a moral good in this instrumental\nway, but insists that the practice of science itself manifests the\ntranscendental self. The possibility of searching for truth cannot be\nseparated from moral reason and embodies moral value. The common view\nis that science aims at truth, which is distinct from goodness, but\nfor him science is not value-neutral (TJCW 12: 223\u201324).\nScientific understanding involves grasping common properties or\npatterns in the world through formation of a concept connecting past\nand future events, which follow the same principle. To search for\nthese principles requires transcending one\u2019s natural instincts\nand desires for the sake of abstract truth which has no immediate\nrelation to one\u2019s desires. This ability to transcend these\nmanifests moral goodness and the possibility of reason controlling\ndesires (TJCW 12: 226\u201327). Furthermore, scientific laws are\nuniversal and objective. The possibility of shared understanding of\nthem means minds have similar cognitive abilities. And as a matter of\npractice, scientists seek to have their findings published,\nrecognized, and understood by other people. This is an implicit\nacknowledgment that being understood by other people is important, and\nthat people have independent minds that can reach similar\nunderstanding (TJCW 12: 233\u201336). This shared understanding is a\nform of affective connection.\n\nAt this juncture we may ask what Tang has demonstrated: does this\naffective connection he describes constitute knowledge of\nother people\u2019s subjectivity and shared moral reason? Or is it an\nassumption of cultural practices such as science, philosophy, and art,\nbut remains short of knowledge? This is a complicated question on\nwhich Tang equivocated in his writings. In one related discussion,\nTang examines the Confucian belief in the universal moral mind, and\nsays that through reason one can universalize the humane nature and\nheart-mind and know that all people have them. Immediately following\nhe calls this belief a kind of faith and says,\n\n\nThis faith that the humane nature and heart-mind must exist can\nlikewise not be proved positively by the use of pure reason and\nargument. At most, we can use a negative argument that it is\nimpossible to assert that it does not exist, and so show that it must\nexist. That it exists is revealed negatively in the fact that people\nfeel uneasy about evil and suffering. If you feel uneasy about yours\nand others\u2019 evil and suffering, this is negative proof that you\nhave the humane nature and heart-mind of perfect goodness that [wants\nto] remove evil and suffering\u2026. If you say that you have no\nuneasiness toward evil and suffering at all, then I do not believe\nyou. How do I know that you feel uneasy? Because I do\u2026. Even if\nyou do not reveal this humane nature and heart-mind for now and\nyourself feel you don\u2019t have it, I still affirm that you must\nhave it. The reason is because in the end, I cannot accept that you do\nnot have it, so I affirm that you do: there is no other reason. (TJCW\n11: 247\u201349)\n\n\nThis evidently falls short of knowledge.\n\nEven in his last work, it is difficult to pin down precisely what Tang\nthinks, whether affective connection with other minds is a known\nreality or whether it is a matter of faith or an assumption to make\nsense of our practices in life. Perhaps his final word on the subject\nis in the postscript to Life Existence and the Horizons of\nMind, an extended discussion on faith, meaning, and the role of\nphilosophy. People must have ideals, and he says the objective\nexistence of a universal human way and universal human nature is a\nconviction based on the possibility of shared rational ideas (TJCW 26:\n2.370). Ultimately, he seems to conclude that we need this sort of\nconviction for life to have meaning and to support moral practice.\n\n\nA belief in the metaphysical origin of the light of perfect goodness\nas an absolute truth then makes possible the action of making the\nirrational into the rational. (TJCW 26: 2.381)\n\n\nHere Tang\u2019s deep interest in religion bears brief mention (for\nmore see Tang 1955 [1981]; Fr\u00f6hlich 2017: chap. 5; W. Ng 1998;\nVan den Stock 2021: 226\u201335). Religion is critical for Tang,\nmeaning belief in an absolute spiritual reality (TJCW 9: 354). The\nfundamental demand of religion is to affirm a transcendent absolute\nthat can preserve all values. In Confucianism, this is faith in the\nfundamental mind and nature themselves (TJCW 11: 319\u201320, 335).\nIt might be best to conclude that for Tang, whether this was knowledge\nor not in a theoretical way was beside the point (Chiu 2016:\n157\u201358; 2023: 296). It is a postulate, in Kant\u2019s sense: an\nidea we must apply to ourselves (Schmidt 2011: 291 n31). We must have\nfaith in the possibility of goodness in ourselves and others to go on\nliving.\n",
