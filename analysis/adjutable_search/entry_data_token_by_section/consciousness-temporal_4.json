    "main_text": "Some Historical Episodes || William James\n2.1 William James\n\nIn the Anglophone philosophical world over the past century or so\nWilliam James\u2019 \u201cThe Perception of Time\u201d, chapter 15\nof his classic The Principles of Psychology (1890) has been\nparticularly influential. In the chapter James introduces readers to\nrelevant experimental work as well as more philosophical reflections.\nIt was thanks to James\u2019 discussion that \u201cthe specious\npresent\u201d entered the vocabulary of both philosophers and\npsychologists. James gives E.R. Clay credit both for the term and for\nrecognizing that the \u201csensible present\u201d has duration; he\nquotes him thus:\n\n\nThe relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied.\nIts objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time\nreferred to by the datum is a very different thing from the\nconterminous of the past and the future which philosophy denotes by\nthe name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a\npart of the past\u2014a recent past\u2014delusively given as being a\ntime that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named\nthe specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the\npast, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song\nseem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes\nof place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the\npresent. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of\nthe time measured by them seems to be a past. (James 1890:\n 609)[8]\n\n\nJames goes on:\n\n\nthe original paragon and prototype of all conceived times is the\nspecious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and\nincessantly sensible. (1890: 631)\n\n\nIn another formulation he enters into more detail, and says something\nabout what this short duration contains:\n\n\nThe unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with\na bow and a stern, as it were\u2014a rearward\u2014and a\nforward-looking end. It is only as parts of this duration-block that\nthe relation of succession of one end to the other is perceived. We do\nnot first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the\nperception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we\nseem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends\nembedded in it. (1890: 609\u201310)\n\n\nIn the same chapter of the Principles James also writes:\n\n\nIts content is in a constant flux, events dawning into its\nforward end as fast as they fade out of its rearward one \u2026\nMeanwhile, the specious present, the intuited duration, stands\npermanent, like the rainbow on the waterfall, with its own quality\nunchanged by the events that stream through it. (1890: 630)\n\n\nJames clearly believed that there is an unvarying structure\nor mechanism underlying our temporal awareness, as did\nHusserl after him. If this is right, and if (as many believe)\nconsciousness is essentially temporal, then this structure (or\nmechanism) is an essential component of consciousness itself, in all\nits forms.\n\nJames is well-known for emphasizing the continuity of\nexperience\n\n\nConsciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up into\nbits. Such words as \u201cchain\u201d or \u201ctrain\u201d do not\ndescribe it fitly \u2026 It is nothing jointed, it flows. A\n\u201criver\u201d or a \u201cstream\u201d are the metaphors by\nwhich it is naturally described (1890: 239)\n\n\nand James\u2019 stream metaphor strikes many as\n apt.[9]\n",
