Its\ncapacity to deal with economic, social and environmental problems that\nincreasingly cut across borders is also questioned. Under these\ncircumstances, should the sovereign, territorial state still be seen\nas the necessary institutional context for justice and democracy? What\nare the alternatives?\n\nThis kind of question has sparked at least two responses from\ntheorists of citizenship. \u2018Globalists\u2019 insist on the need\nto rethink democracy and citizenship beyond the nation-state,\nproposing schemes to extend democratic politics to regional and global\n levels.[23]\n \u2018Statists\u2019, in contrast, argue that democratic\ncitizenship requires a bounded territorial space, the state, within\nwhich citizens can see themselves as part of a common demos.\nCentral to this debate is a disagreement over the meaning of\ndemocratic political agency and its basic conditions.\n\nThe disagreement over conditions is crucial since conditions can be\ndefined in ways that limit the potential extension of the political\ncommunity. Democratic agency\u2019s meaning can also be contested. To\nwhat extent should it be understood as a collective agency? Should\npolitical action be characterized as a common practice, in which\ncitizens are in relations of interaction and mutual awareness, or can\nit be defined as primarily individual? \n\nSupporters of global democracy reject the conventional identification\nbetween demos, territory, and citizenship. In their view,\ncitizenship is not a set of practices and of rights that need to be\nanchored in a particular demos defined by specific\nterritorial boundaries. On the contrary, citizenship is ideally\nexercised in a multiplicity of \u2018sites\u2019, situated at\ndifferent levels of governance: local, national, regional, and global\n(Maas 2017). Global democrats sketch a multilayered, global democratic\norder in which no single layer or site is dominant (Pogge 1992, 58,\nYoung 2000, 266). This scheme implies a \u2018vertical\u2019\ndispersal of power above and below existing sovereign states, which\nlose their centrality. This would lower incentives for conflicts over\npower and wealth within and between states, \u201c\u2018thereby\nreducing the incidence of war, poverty, and oppression\u2019 and\nenvironmental degradation\u201d (Kuper 2004, 30, quoting Pogge 1992,\n102\u2013105).\n\nGlobalists would balance this dilution of state power by strengthening\ncertain global regulatory regimes in areas like peace and security,\nhuman rights, the environment, trade and finances, etc. These regimes\nwould set down general rules \u201cregarding that small but vital set\nof issues around which peace and justice call for global\nco-operation\u201d (Young 2000, 267; see also Held 2005). A set of\nglobal institutions would be needed to ensure the application of these\nrules; though globalists are quick to point out the importance of\ndemocratic principles \u2014 consent, self-determination and autonomy\n\u2014 and their institutional implications (Pogge 1992, 64).\n\nThe formal political institutions and procedures envisaged are often\nfamiliar: representative assemblies based on elections and referenda.\nThese institutions would exist at each level of the multilayered\nscheme: local, national, regional, and global. Following the European\nUnion model, continent-wide parliaments are envisaged, as well as a\nreformed general assembly of the United Nations. At the informal\nlevel, globalists insist on the need for globally active organizations\nof civil society, welcome the emergence of a transnational public\nopinion and call on global agencies such as the World Trade\nOrganization and the International Monetary Fund to commit themselves\nto basic principles of publicity.\n\nGlobal democrats assume that the extension of democracy beyond the\nlimits of the nation-state is neither conceptually nor practically\nimpossible. Their response to claims that scale constitutes a major\nobstacle is twofold: first, they put the principle of subsidiarity at\nthe centre of their institutional scheme (Held 2005, 14; Pogge 1992,\n65\u201366); second, they insist that robust democratic politics is\ntruly possible only at the local level. In existing nation-states,\nrepresentative institutions are already far removed from ordinary\ncitizens, who feel largely disempowered and disaffected (Young 2000,\n270\u2013271). Since the proposed multilayered scheme involves\nsignificant decentralization from the national to the sub-national\nlevel, the argument runs that global democracy would, in fact,\ntranslate into more, rather than less, \u2018real\u2019 democracy.\nIt would serve to increase the ability of citizens to participate\neffectively in shaping the policies that concern them directly (Pogge\n1992, 64; Young 2000, 269). However, no matter how forcefully the\nprinciple of subsidiarity is applied, the global democratic project\nwould still entail the implementation of global principles and\nstandards (e.g. (re)distributive principles, human rights standards)\nthat would rely on coercive enforcement agencies (Benhabib 2004, 113).\nThis means that the democratic legitimacy of political institutions\nabove the level of the state is an issue that cannot be avoided.\n\nStatists have tried to identify some basic background conditions to\ndemocratic institutions and procedures that cannot be satisfied beyond\na certain threshold. Their argument is empirical, rather than\nconceptual. A common language is one plausible candidate put forward\nby Kymlicka. He insists that linguistic/territorial political\nassociations are the primary forum for democratic participation,\nrather than higher-level political associations that cut across\nlinguistic lines, because democratic politics is essentially\n\u201cpolitics in the vernacular\u201d (Kymlicka 1999, 121). Even in\ncases where average citizens are conversant in one or more foreign\nlanguage, they rarely have the level of fluency necessary to\nparticipate in political debate in a language other than their own:\nonly a select few have the ability and opportunity to acquire and\nsustain the necessary language skills. Political debate in\nmultilingual settings is essentially an elitist pursuit.\n\nIn fact, political discussions require a higher degree of fluency than\nwhat is needed for business transactions or tourism: \u201cpolitical\ncommunication has a large ritualistic component, and these ritualized\nforms of communication are typically language-specific. Even if one\nunderstands a foreign language in the technical sense, without\nknowledge of these ritualistic elements one may be unable to\nunderstand political debates\u201d (Kymlicka 1999, 121). In that\ncase, the hope that English\u2019s emergence as a new global\nlingua franca could overcome the linguistic obstacles that\nimpede the development of transnational democratic politics appear\noverstated. English\u2019s growing use may be enough to increase\nmutual understanding between individuals, but it is unlikely to become\na transnational vernacular allowing democratic politics to transcend\nnational\n boundaries.[24]\nHowever, that argument may not prove to be the insuperable obstacle\nthat statists suppose. If the development of a global public sphere,\nextending across state boundaries, is indeed necessary for democratic\npolitics at the global level, this can be interpreted in terms of\nmaking national public spheres responsive to each other. This does not\nrequire that citizens themselves become multilingual, but that the\nmedia inform citizens about how issues of common interest are debated\nin other (national) public spheres (see Habermas 2009, 87).\n\nThe development of transnational advocacy networks may also indicate\nthat the statists\u2019 worries are overstated. Their existence shows\nthat it is possible for individuals to exercise political agency in\nforums other than those provided by democratic states and that the\nabsence of a common vernacular does not impede participation. Global\ndemocracy becomes thinkable once we focus on the development of\ntransnational civil society rather than on the transposing of\nrepresentative institutions at the global level. In response, it\nshould be noted that such networks usually coalesce around a common\nideology or a conception of the good (e.g. the environment; rights of\nindigenous peoples, critique of neo-liberal forms of globalisation,\netc.), serving as a functional equivalent to a common vernacular. More\nimportantly, these networks are composed of voluntary associations\norganized around shared interests and cannot stand as a surrogate for\nthe political community per se, which acts as the addressee\nof claims made by the organisations and groups of civil society.\n\nWhich political community or communities can act as the addressee of\nclaims made by organisations of transnational civil society? Though\nsomething like a global political society can be seen as emerging in\nglobal events like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n(COP), national political communities and their formal institutions\nstill appear as the main adressees of claims. In that case, Kymlicka\nis right to claim that: \u201cthe weak transnationalism of advocacy\nnetworks is predicated on, even parasitic on, the ongoing existence of\nbounded political communities\u201d (Kymlicka 2003, 291). In this\nrespect, though the organisations and associations of an emerging\ntransnational civil society can offer possibilities of political\nagency for certain committed individuals and groups, they do not offer\na solution to the problem posed by the extension of democratic\ncitizenship to the global\n level.[25]\n\nHowever, this conclusion may be faulted for putting too much weight on\nthe formal institutional context within which democratic citizenship\nis set. Important strands in the citizenship literature display\nattempts to break free from this way of conceptualizing citizenship,\nfocusing instead on practices of citizenship defined independently of\nits formal legal status. These strands point to perhaps more fruitful\navenues to conceptualize transnational democratic citizenship. James\nTully\u2019s contribution is particularly important here because of\nthe broader, practice-based definition of citizenship he offers. Tully\nuses \u201cthe term \u2018citizen\u2019 to refer to a person who is\nsubject to a relationship of governance (that is to say, governed)\nand, simultaneously and primarily, is an active agent in the\nfield of a governance relationship\u201d (Tully 2008a, 3). Governance\nrelationships take place at all levels of political and social life:\nbelow, beyond and across the boundaries of the state. Citizenship,\nconsidered primarily as an activity, cannot be reduced to \u201ca\nstatus given by institutions of the modern constitutional state and\ninternational law\u201d. It refers instead to the \u201cnegotiated\npractices in which one becomes citizen through participation\u201d\n(Tully 2008b,\n 248).[26]\n\nThe \u201cacts of citizenship\u201d literature, formed around the\nwritings of Engen Isin, is also relevant here (Isin 2008; 2009; 2017).\nIsin developed his theory to make sense of what he calls an\n\u201cunnamed figure\u201d, \u201cwhich belies the modern figure of\nthe citizen with singular loyalty, identity and belongings\u201d. He\nrelated its appearance to the emergence of new \u2018sites\u2019 and\n\u2018scales\u2019 while insisting that it could not be adequaltely\ngrasped by conventional categories like \u2018foreigner\u2019,\n\u2018migrant\u2019, \u2018refugee\u2019, \u2018nomad\u2019,\netc. He suggested escaping from conventional accounts by focusing on\nthe \u201c\u2019acts\u2019 through which \u2018actors\u2019 claim\nto transform themselves (and others) from subjects into citizens as\nclaimants of rights\u201d (Isin 2009, 368). This suggestion has led\nto a fluid and dynamic conception of citizenship that attempts to make\nsense of phenomena that extend below, beyond and across state\nboundaries without denying the stubborn reality of states (see e.g.\nTonkiss 2022; M\u00fcller 2022; Roy and Neveu 2023).\n\nThere is still another version of the global democratic project that\ninvolves an individualist conception of democratic political agency.\nHere citizens can engage in significant political activities that do\nnot require high levels of interaction and cooperation between them\n(Kuper 2004). This position requires, first, that one abandon the\nconception of democratic legitimacy implicit in deliberative,\nparticipatory and republican conceptions of democracy, which all\nattempt to maintain a broadly Rousseauian understanding of legitimacy:\nlaws are legitimate only if citizens can see themselves, somehow, as\ntheir coauthors. Kuper suggests that this vision of democratic\nlegitimacy be discarded in favour of one focusing on the\nresponsiveness of the political system as a whole. The central issue\nbecomes whether this system is made to act \u201cin the best\ninterests of the public, in a manner responsive to them\u201d (Kuper\n2004, 75 quoting Pitkin 1967). On this view, the vertical, rather than\nhorizontal, dimension of communication is of overarching importance:\nindividual citizens must have access to relevant information about\nwhat various authorities are doing, there must exist institutional\nchannels through which they can pressure authorities and let them know\ntheir views on proposed policies. Doing so does not require that they\n\u201cact together with high levels of mutual awareness\u201d (Kuper\n2004, 127); they can exercise these capacities individually, via\nspecific agencies. Responsiveness is also a dimension of democratic\nlegitimacy favoured by some empirical political scientists, referring\nto the responsiveness of representatives to the opinions, preferences\nand concerns of citizens communicated via various agencies. It is\nmeasured through statistical correlation in which public opinion is\nthe dependent variable and policy output is the independent variable\n(for an overview see Page (1994)).\n\nIn contrast to the vertical and sometimes causal picture of\ncitizenship depicted in responsiveness, one may insist, as does\nBernard Manin, that meaningful political agency requires that citizens\nbe capable of learning what their co-citizens think about important\npolicy issues or events independently of the authorities. Horizontal\ncommunication between citizens appears as a necessary condition to\ntheir being capable of political action (Manin 1997,\n 170\u2013171).[27]\n The thing that makes citizens political agents is their capacity to\nact independently of authorities and this ability, in turn, depends on\nwhether they regularly act and communicate together, even if this\ninteraction is often mediated through institutions like the electronic\nmedia.\n",
