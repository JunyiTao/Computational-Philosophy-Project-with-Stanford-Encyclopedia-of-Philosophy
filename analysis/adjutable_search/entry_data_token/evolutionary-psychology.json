Along with cognitive\npsychologists, evolutionary psychologists propose that much, if not\nall, of our behavior can be explained by appeal to internal\npsychological mechanisms. What distinguishes evolutionary\npsychologists from many cognitive psychologists is the proposal that\nthe relevant internal mechanisms are adaptations\u2014products of\nnatural selection\u2014that helped our ancestors get around the\nworld, survive and reproduce. To understand the central claims of\nevolutionary psychology we require an understanding of some key\nconcepts in evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, philosophy of\nscience and philosophy of mind. Philosophers are interested in\nevolutionary psychology for a number of reasons. For philosophers of\nscience \u2014mostly philosophers of biology\u2014evolutionary\npsychology provides a critical target. Although here is a broad consensus among philosophers of biology that evolutionary psychology is a deeply flawed enterprise, this does not entail that these philosophers completely reject the relevance of evolutionary theory to human psychology. For philosophers of mind and cognitive science\nevolutionary psychology has been a source of empirical hypotheses\nabout cognitive architecture and specific components of that\narchitecture. However, some philosophers of mind are also critical of evolutionary\npsychology but their criticisms are not as all-encompassing as those\npresented by philosophers of biology. Evolutionary psychology is also\ninvoked by philosophers interested in moral psychology both as a\nsource of empirical hypotheses and as a critical target.\n\nIn what follows I briefly explain evolutionary psychology\u2019s\nrelations to other work on the biology of human behavior and the\ncognitive sciences. Next I introduce the research tradition\u2019s\nkey theoretical concepts. In the following section I take up\ndiscussions about evolutionary psychology in the philosophy of mind,\nspecifically focusing on the debate about the massive modularity\nthesis. I go on to review some of the criticisms of evolutionary\npsychology presented by philosophers of biology and assess some\nresponses to those criticisms. I then go on to introduce some of\nevolutionary psychology\u2019s contributions to moral psychology and\nhuman nature and, finally, briefly discuss the reach and impact of\nevolutionary psychology.\n", "toc": [{"#EvoPsyOneResTraAmoVarBioAppExpHumBeh": "1.

Evolutionary Psychology: One research tradition among the various biological approaches to explaining human behavior\n\nThis entry focuses on the specific approach to evolutionary psychology\nthat is conventionally named by the capitalized phrase\n\u201cEvolutionary Psychology\u201d. This naming convention is David\nBuller\u2019s (2000; 2005) idea. He introduces the convention to\ndistinguish a particular research tradition (Laudan 1977) from other\napproaches to the biology of human\n behavior.[1]\n This research tradition is the focus here but lower case is used\nthroughout as no other types of evolutionary psychology are discussed.\nEvolutionary psychology rests upon specific theoretical principles\n(presented in section 2 below) not all of which are shared by others\nworking in the biology of human behavior (Laland and Brown 2002; Brown\net al. 2011). For example, human behavioral ecologists present and\ndefend explanatory hypotheses about human behavior that do not appeal\nto psychological mechanisms (e.g., Hawkes 1990; Hrdy 1999). Behavioral\necologists also believe that much of human behavior can be explained\nby appealing to evolution while rejecting the idea held by\nevolutionary psychologists that one period of our evolutionary history\nis the source of all our important psychological adaptations (Irons\n1998). Developmental psychobiologists take yet another approach: they\nare anti-adaptationist. (Michel and Moore 1995; but see Bateson and\nMartin 1999; Bjorklund and Hernandez Blasi 2005 for examples of\ndevelopmentalist work in an adaptationist vein.) These theorists\nbelieve that much of our behavior can be explained without appealing\nto a suite of specific psychological adaptations for that behavior.\nInstead they emphasize the role of development in the production of\nvarious human behavioral traits. From here on, \u201cevolutionary\npsychology\u201d refers to a specific research tradition among the\nmany biological approaches to the study of human behavior.\n\nPaul Griffiths argues that evolutionary psychology owes theoretical\ndebt to both sociobiology and ethology (Griffiths 2006; Griffiths\n2008). Evolutionary psychologists acknowledge their debt to\nsociobiology but point out that they add a dimension to sociobiology:\npsychological mechanisms. Human behaviors are not a direct product of\nnatural selection but rather the product of psychological mechanisms\nthat were selected for. The relation to ethology here is that in the\nnineteen fifties, ethologists proposed instincts or drives that\nunderlie our\n behavior;[2]\n evolutionary psychology\u2019s psychological mechanisms are the\ncorrelates to instincts or drives. Evolutionary psychology is also\nrelated to cognitive psychology and the cognitive sciences. The\npsychological mechanisms they invoke are computational, sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cDarwinian algorithms\u201d or as\n\u201ccomputational modules\u201d. This overt cognitivism sets\nevolutionary psychology apart from much work in the neurosciences and\nfrom behavioral neuroendocrinology. In these fields internal\nmechanisms are proposed in explanations of human behavior but they are\nnot construed in computational terms. David Marr\u2019s (e.g., 1983)\nwell known three part distinction is often invoked to distinguish the\nlevels at which researchers focus their attention in the cognitive and\nneurosciences. Many neuroscientists and behavioral\nneuroendocrinologists work at the implementation level while cognitive\npsychologists work at the level of the computations that are\nimplemented at the neurobiological level (cf. Griffiths 2006).\n\nEvolutionary psychologists sometimes present their approach as\npotentially unifying, or providing a foundation for, all other work\nthat purports to explain human behavior (e.g., Tooby and Cosmides\n1992). This claim has been met with strong skepticism by many social\nscientists who see a role for a myriad of types of explanation of\nhuman behavior, some of which are not reducible to biological\nexplanations of any sort. This discussion hangs on issues of\nreductionism in the social sciences. (Little 1991 has a nice\nintroduction to these issues.) There are also reasons to believe that\nevolutionary psychology neither unifies nor provides foundations for\nclosely neighboring fields such as behavioral ecology or developmental\npsychobiology. (See the related discussion in Downes 2005.) In other\nwork, evolutionary psychologists present their approach as being\nconsistent with or compatible with neighboring approaches such as\nbehavioral ecology and developmental psychobiology. (See Buss\u2019s\nintroduction to Buss 2005.) The truth of this claim hangs on a careful\nexamination of the theoretical tenets of evolutionary psychology and\nits neighboring fields. We now turn to evolutionary psychology\u2019s\ntheoretical tenets and revisit this discussion in section 4 below.\n2. Evolutionary Psychology\u2019s Theory and Methods\n\nInfluential evolutionary psychologists, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby,\nprovide the following list of the field\u2019s theoretical tenets\n(Tooby and Cosmides 2005):\n\n The brain is a computer designed by natural selection to extract\ninformation from the environment.\n Individual human behavior is generated by this evolved computer\nin response to information it extracts from the environment.\nUnderstanding behavior requires articulating the cognitive programs\nthat generate the behavior.\n The cognitive programs of the human brain are adaptations. They\nexist because they produced behavior in our ancestors that enabled\nthem to survive and reproduce.\n The cognitive programs of the human brain may not be adaptive\nnow; they were adaptive in ancestral environments.\n Natural selection ensures that the brain is composed of many\ndifferent special purpose programs and not a domain general\narchitecture.\n Describing the evolved computational architecture of our brains\n\u201callows a systematic understanding of cultural and social\nphenomena\u201d (16\u201318).\n\n\nTenet 1 emphasizes the cognitivism that evolutionary psychologists are\ncommitted to. 1 in combination with 2 directs our attention as\nresearchers not to parts of the brain but to the programs run by the\nbrain. It is these programs\u2014psychological mechanisms\u2014that\nare products of natural selection. While they are products of natural\nselection, and hence adaptations, these programs need not be currently\nadaptive. Our behavior can be produced by underlying psychological\nmechanisms that arose to respond to particular circumstances in our\nancestors\u2019 environments. Tenet 5 presents what is often called\nthe \u201cmassive modularity thesis\u201d (see e.g. Samuels 1998;\nSamuels 2000). There is a lot packed into this tenet and we will\nexamine this thesis in some detail below in section 3. In brief,\nevolutionary psychologists maintain that there is an analogy between\norgans and psychological mechanisms or modules. Organs perform\nspecific functions well and are products of natural selection. There\nare no general purpose organs, hearts pump blood and livers detoxify\nthe body. The same goes for psychological mechanisms; they arise as\nresponses to specific contingencies in the environment and are\nselected for to the extent that they contribute to the survival and\nreproduction of the organism. Just as there are no general purpose\norgans, there are no general purpose psychological mechanisms.\nFinally, tenet 6 introduces the reductionist or foundational vision of\nevolutionary psychology, discussed above.\n\nThere are numerous examples of the kinds of mechanisms that are\nhypothesized to underlie our behavior on the basis of research guided\nby these theoretical tenets: the cheater-detection module; the\nmind-reading module; the waist/hip ratio detection module; the snake\nfear module and so on. A closer look at the waist/hip ratio detection\nmodule illustrates the above theoretical tenets at work. Devendra\nSingh (Singh 1993; Singh and Luis 1995) presents the waist/hip ratio\ndetection module as one of the suite of modules that underlies mate\nselection in humans. This one is a specifically male psychological\nmechanism. Men detect variations in waist/hip ratio in women.\nMen\u2019s preferences are for women with waist/hip ratios closer to\n.7. Singh claims that the detection and preference suite are\nadaptations for choosing fertile mates. So our mate selection behavior\nis explained in part by the underlying psychological mechanism for\nwaist/hip ratio preference that was selected for in earlier human\nenvironments.\n\nWhat is important to note about the research guided by these\ntheoretical tenets above is that all behavior is best explained in\nterms of underlying psychological mechanisms that are adaptations for\nsolving a particular set of problems that humans faced at one time in\nour ancestry. Also, evolutionary psychologists stress that the\nmechanisms they focus on are universally distributed in humans and are\nnot susceptible to much, if any, variation. They maintain that the\nmechanisms are a product of adaptation but are no longer under\nselection (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 39\u201340). Clark\nBarrett\u2019s (2015) accessible and wide ranging introduction to\nevolutionary psychology sustains this emphasis on evolved mechanisms\nas the main focus of evolutionary psychology research. Barrett also\nexpands the scope of evolutionary psychology and notes the addition of\nresearch methods developed since Cosmides and Tooby first set out the\nparameters for research in the field. Some of Barrett\u2019s\nproposals are discussed in sections 6 and 7 below. Todd Shackleford\nand Viviana Weekes-Shackleford (2017) have just completed a huge\ncompendium of work in the evolutionarily based psychological sciences.\nIn this volume a vast array of different research methods are\npresented and defended and there are a number of entries comparing the\nmerits of alternative approaches to evolutionary psychology.\n\nThe methods for testing hypotheses in evolutionary psychology come\nmostly from psychology. For example, in Singh\u2019s work, male\nsubjects are presented with drawings of women with varying waist hip\nratios and ask to give their preference rankings. In Buss\u2019s work\nsupporting several hypothesized mate selection mechanisms, he\nperformed similar experiments on subjects, asking for their responses\nto various questions about features of desired mates (Buss 1990).\nBuss, Singh and other evolutionary psychologists emphasize the cross\ncultural validity of their results, claiming consistency in responses\nacross a wide variety of human populations. (But see Yu and Shepard\n1998; Gray et al. 2003 for different types of conflicting results to\nSingh\u2019s.) For the most part standard psychological experimental\nmethods are used to test hypotheses in evolutionary psychology. This\nhas raised questions about the extent to which the evolutionary\ncomponent of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 hypotheses is being\ntested (see e.g. Shapiro and Epstein 1998; Lloyd 1999; Lloyd and\nFeldman 2002). A response profile may be prevalent in a wide variety\nof subject populations but this says nothing about whether or not the\nresponse profile is a psychological mechanism that arose from a\nparticular selective regimen.\n3. The Massive Modularity Hypothesis\n\nClaims that the mind has a modular architecture, and even massively\nmodular architecture, are widespread in cognitive science (see e.g.\nHirshfield and Gelman 1994). The massive modularity thesis is first\nand foremost a thesis about cognitive architecture. As defended by\nevolutionary psychologists, the thesis is also about the source of our\ncognitive architecture: the massively modular architecture is the\nresult of natural selection acting to produce each of the many modules\n(see e.g. Barrett and Kurzban 2006; Barrett 2012). Our cognitive\narchitecture is composed of computational devices, that are innate and\nare adaptations (cf. Samuels 1998; Samuels et al. 1999a; Samuels et\nal. 1999b; Samuels 2000). This massively modular architecture accounts\nfor all of our sophisticated behavior. Our successful navigation of\nthe world results from the action of one or more of our many\nmodules.\n\nJerry Fodor was the first to mount a sustained philosophical defense\nof modularity as a theory of cognitive architecture (Fodor 1983). His\nmodularity thesis is distinct from the massive modularity thesis in a\nnumber of important ways. Fodor argued that our \u201cinput\nsystems\u201d are modular\u2014for example, components of our visual\nsystem, our speech detection system and so on\u2014these parts of our\nmind are dedicated information processors, whose internal make-up is\ninaccessible to other related processors. The modular detection\nsystems feed output to a central system, which is a kind of inference\nengine. The central system, on Fodor\u2019s view is not modular.\nFodor presents a large number of arguments against the possibility of\nmodular central systems. For example, he argues that central systems,\nto the extent that they engage in something like scientific\nconfirmation, are \u201cQuinean\u201d in that \u201cthe degree of\nconfirmation assigned to any given hypothesis is sensitive to\nproperties of the entire belief system\u201d (Fodor 1983, 107). Fodor\ndraws a bleak conclusion about the status of cognitive science from\nhis examination of the character of central systems: cognitive science\nis impossible. So on Fodor\u2019s view, the mind is partly modular\nand the part of the mind that is modular provides some subject matter\nfor cognitive science.\n\nA distinct thesis from Fodor\u2019s, the massive modularity thesis,\ngets a sustained philosophical defense from Peter Carruthers (see\nespecially Carruthers 2006). Carruthers is well aware that Fodor (see\ne.g. Fodor 2000) does not believe that central systems can be modular\nbut he presents arguments from evolutionary psychologists and others\nthat support the modularity thesis for the whole mind. Perhaps one of\nthe reasons that there is so much philosophical interest in\nevolutionary psychology is that discussions about the status of the\nmassive modularity thesis are highly\n theoretical.[3]\n Both evolutionary psychologists and philosophers present and consider\narguments for and against the thesis rather than simply waiting until\nthe empirical results come in. Richard Samuels (1998) speculates that\nargument rather than empirical data is relied on, because the various\ncompeting modularity theses about central systems are hard to pull\napart empirically. Carruthers exemplifies this approach as he relies\nheavily on arguments for massive modularity often at the expense of\nspecific empirical results that tell in favor of the thesis.\n\nThere are many arguments for the massive modularity thesis. Some are\nbased upon considerations about how evolution must have acted; some\nare based on considerations about the nature of computation and some\nare versions of the poverty of the stimulus argument first presented\nby Chomsky in support of the existence of an innate universal grammar.\n(See Cowie 1999 for a nice presentation of the structure of poverty of\nthe stimulus arguments.) Myriad versions of each of these arguments\nappear in the literature and many arguments for massive modularity mix\nand match components of each of the main strands of argumentation.\nHere we review a version of each type of argument.\n\nCarruthers presents a clear outline of the first type of argument\n\u201cthe biological argument for massive modularity\u201d:\n\u201c(1) Biological systems are designed systems, constructed\nincrementally. (2) Such systems, when complex, need to have massively\nmodular organization. (3) The human mind is a biological system and is\ncomplex. (4) So the human mind will be massively modularly in its\norganization\u201d (Carruthers 2006, 25). An example of this argument\nis to appeal to the functional decomposition of organisms into organs\n\u201cdesigned\u201d for specific tasks, e.g. hearts, livers,\nkidneys. Each of these organs arises as a result of natural selection\nand the organs, acting together, contribute to the fitness of the\norganism. The functional decomposition is driven by the response to\nspecific environmental stimuli. Rather than natural selection acting\nto produce general purpose organs, each specific environmental\nchallenge is dealt with by a separate mechanism. All versions of this\nargument are arguments from analogy, relying on the key transitional\npremise that minds are a kind of biological system upon which natural\nselection acts.\n\nThe second type of argument makes no appeal to biological\nconsiderations whatsoever (although many evolutionary psychologists\ngive these arguments a biological twist). Call this the computational\nargument, which unfolds as follows: minds are computational problem\nsolving devices; there are specific types of solutions to specific\ntypes of problems; and so for minds to be (successful) general problem\nsolving devices, they must consist of collections of specific problem\nsolving devices, i.e. many computational modules. This type of\nargument is structurally similar to the biological argument (as\nCarruthers points out). The key idea is that there is no sense to the\nidea of a general problem solver and that no headway can be made in\ncognitive science without breaking down problems into their component\nparts.\n\nThe third type of argument involves a generalization of\nChomsky\u2019s poverty of the stimulus argument for universal\ngrammar. Many evolutionary psychologists (see e.g. Tooby and Cosmides\n1992) appeal to the idea that there is neither enough time, nor enough\navailable information, for any given human to learn from scratch to\nsuccessfully solve all of the problems that we face in the world. This\nfirst consideration supports the conclusion that the underlying\nmechanisms we use to solve the relevant problems are innate (for\nevolutionary psychologists \u201cinnate\u201d is usually\ninterchangeable with \u201cproduct of natural\n selection\u201d[4]).\n If we invoke this argument across the whole range of problem sets\nthat humans face and solve, we arrive at a huge set of innate\nmechanisms that subserve our problem solving abilities, which is\nanother way of saying that we have a massively modular mind.\n\nThere are numerous responses to the many versions of each of these\ntypes of arguments and many take on the massive modularity thesis head\non without considering a specific argument for it. I will defer\nconsideration of responses to the first argument type until section 4\nbelow, which focuses on issues of the nature of evolution and natural\nselection \u2013 topics in philosophy of biology.\n\nThe second type of argument is one side of a perennial debate in the\nphilosophy of cognitive science. Fodor (2000, 68) takes this argument\nto rest on the unwarranted assumption that there is no\ndomain-independent criterion of cognitive success, which he thinks\nrequires an argument that evolutionary psychologists do not provide.\nSamuels (see esp. Samuels 1998) responds to evolutionary psychologists\nthat arguments of this type do not sufficiently discriminate between a\nconclusion about domain specific processing mechanisms and domain\nspecific knowledge or information. Samuels articulates what he calls\nthe \u201clibrary model of cognition\u201d in which there is domain\nspecific information or knowledge but domain general processing. The\nlibrary model of cognition is not massively modular in the relevant\nsense but type two arguments support it. According to Samuels,\nevolutionary psychologists need something more than this type of\nargument to warrant their specific kind of conclusion about massive\nmodularity. Buller (2005) introduces further worries for this type of\nargument by tackling the assumption that there can be no such thing as\na domain general problem solving mechanism. Buller worries that in\ntheir attempt to support this claim, evolutionary psychologists fail\nto adequately characterize a domain general problem solver. For\nexample, they fail to distinguish between a domain general problem\nsolver and a domain specific problem solver that is over generalized.\nHe offers the example of social learning as a domain general mechanism\nthat would produce domain specific solutions to problems. He uses a\nnice biological analogy to drive this point home: the immune system is\na domain general system in that it allows the body to respond to a\nwide variety of pathogens. While it is true that the immune system\nproduces domain specific responses to pathogens in the form of\nspecific antibodies, the antibodies are produced by one domain general\nsystem. These and many other respondents conclude that type two\narguments do not adequately support the massive modularity thesis.\n\nFodor (2000) and Kim Sterelny (2003) provide different responses to\ntype three arguments. Fodor\u2019s response is that poverty of the\nstimulus type arguments support conclusions about innateness but not\nmodularity and so these arguments can not be used to support the\nmassive modularity thesis. He argues that the domain specificity and\nencapsulation of a mechanism and its innateness pull apart quite\nclearly, allowing for \u201cperfectly general learning\nmechanisms\u201d that are innate and \u201cfully encapsulated\nmechanisms\u201d that are single stimulus specific and everything in\nbetween. Sterelny responds to the generalizing move in type three\narguments. He takes language to be the exception rather than the rule\nin the sense that while the postulation of an innate, domain specific\nmodule may be warranted to account for our language abilities, much of\nour other problem solving behavior can be accounted for without\npostulating such modules (Sterelny 2003,\n 200).[5]\n Sterelny\u2019s counter requires invoking alternate explanations for\nour behavioral repertoire. For example, he accounts for folk\npsychology and folk biology by appealing to environmental factors,\nsome of which are constructed by our forebears, that allow us to\nperform sophisticated cognitive tasks. If we can account for our\nsuccess at various complex problem solving tasks, without appealing to\nmodules, then the massive modularity thesis is undercut. Sterelny\nsharpens his response to massive modularity by adding more detail to\nhis accounts of how many of our uniquely human traits may have evolved\n(see e.g. Sterelny 2012). Sterelny introduces his \u201cevolved\napprentice\u201d model to account for the evolution of many human\ntraits that many assume require explanation in terms of massive\nmodularity, for example, forming moral judgments. Cecilia Heyes adopts\na similar approach to Sterenly in attacking massive modularity. Rather\nthan presenting arguments against massive modularity, she offers\nalternative explanations of the development of folk psychology that do\nnot rely on the massive modularity thesis (Heyes 2014a; Heyes\n2014b).\n\nHeyes and Sterelny not only reject massive modularity but also have\nlittle expectation that any modularity theses will bear fruit but\nthere are many critics of the massive modularity thesis who allow for\nthe possibility of some modularity of mind. Such critics of\nevolutionary psychology do not reject the possibility of any kind of\nmodularity, they just reject the massive modularity thesis. There is\nconsiderable debate about the status of the massive modularity thesis\nand some of this debate centers around the characterization of\nmodules. If modules have all the characteristics that Fodor (1983)\nfirst presented, then he may be right that central systems are not\nmodular. Both Carruthers (2006) and Barrett and Kurzban (2006) present\nmodified characterizations of modules, which they argue better serve\nthe massive modularity thesis. There is no agreement on a workable\ncharacterization of modules for evolutionary psychology but there is\nagreement on the somewhat benign thesis that \u201cthe language of\nmodularity affords useful conceptual groundwork in which productive\ndebates surrounding cognitive systems can be framed\u201d (Barrett\nand Kurzban 2006, 644).\n4. Philosophy of biology vs. Evolutionary Psychology\n\nMany philosophers have criticized evolutionary psychology. Most of\nthese critics are philosophers of biology who argue that the research\ntradition suffers from an overly zealous form of\n adaptationism\n (Griffiths 1996; Richardson 1996; Grantham and Nichols 1999; Lloyd\n1999; Richardson 2007), an untenable reductionism (Dupre 1999; Dupre\n2001), a \u201cbad empirical bet\u201d about modules (Sterelny 1995;\nSterelny and Griffiths 1999; Sterelny 2003), a fast and loose\nconception of fitness (Lloyd 1999; Lloyd and Feldman 2002); and most\nof the above and much more (Buller 2005) (cf. Downes\n 2005).[6]\n All of these philosophers share one version or other of\nBuller\u2019s view: \u201cI am unabashedly enthusiastic about\nefforts to apply evolutionary theory to human psychology\u201d (2005,\n x).[7]\n But if philosophers of biology are not skeptical of the fundamental\nidea behind the project, as Buller\u2019s quote indicates, what are\nthey so critical of? What is at stake are differing views about how to\nbest characterize evolution and hence how to generate evolutionary\nhypotheses and how to test evolutionary hypotheses. For evolutionary\npsychologists, the most interesting contribution that evolutionary\ntheory makes is the explanation of apparent design in nature or the\nexplanation of the production of complex organs by appeal to natural\nselection. Evolutionary psychologists generate evolutionary hypotheses\nby first finding apparent design in the world, say in our\npsychological make up, and then presenting a selective scenario that\nwould have led to the production of the trait that exhibits apparent\ndesign. The hypotheses evolutionary psychologists generate, given that\nthey are usually hypotheses about our psychological capacities, are\ntested by standard psychological methods. Philosophers of biology\nchallenge evolutionary psychologists on both of these points. I\nintroduce a few examples of criticisms in each of these two areas\nbelow and then look at some responses to philosophical criticisms of\nevolutionary psychology.\n\nAdaptation is the one biological concept that is central to most\ndebates over evolutionary psychology. Every theoretical work on\nevolutionary psychology presents the research tradition as being\nprimarily focused on psychological adaptations and goes on to give an\naccount of what adaptations are (see e.g. Tooby and Cosmides 1992;\nBuss et al. 1998; Simpson and Campbell 2005; Tooby and Cosmides 2005).\nMuch of the philosophical criticism of evolutionary psychology\naddresses its approach to adaptation or its form of adaptationism. Let\nus quickly review the basics from the perspective of philosophy of\nbiology.\n\nHere is how Elliott Sober defines an adaptation: \u201ccharacteristic\nc is an adaptation for doing task t in a population\nif and only if members of the population now have c because,\nancestrally, there was selection for having c and c\nconferred a fitness advantage because it performed task\nt\u201d (Sober 2000, 85). Sober makes a few further\nclarifications of the notion of adaptation that are helpful. First, we\nshould distinguish between a trait that is adaptive and a\ntrait that is an adaptation. Any number of traits can be\nadaptive without those traits being adaptations. A sea turtle\u2019s\nforelegs are useful for digging in the sand to bury eggs but they are\nnot adaptations for nest building (Sober 2000, 85). Also, traits can\nbe adaptations without being currently adaptive for a given organism.\nVestigial organs such as our appendix or vestigial eyes in cave\ndwelling organisms are examples of such traits (Sterelny and Griffiths\n1999). Second, we should distinguish between ontogenic and\nphylogenetic adaptations (Sober 2000, 86). The adaptations of interest\nto evolutionary biologists are phylogenetic adaptations, which arise\nover evolutionary time and impact the fitness of the organism.\nOntogenetic adaptations, including any behavior we learn in our\nlifetimes, can be adaptive to the extent that an organism benefits\nfrom them but they are not adaptations in the relevant sense. Finally,\nadaptation and function are closely related terms. On one of the\nprominent views of function\u2014the etiological view of\nfunctions\u2014adaptation and function are more or less coextensive;\nto ask for the function of an organ is to ask why it is present. On\nthe Cummins view of functions adaptation and function are not\ncoextensive, as on the Cummins view, to ask what an organ\u2019s\nfunction is, is to ask what it does (Sober 2000, 86\u201387) (cf.\nSterelny and Griffiths 1999, 220\u2013224).\n\nEvolutionary psychologists focus on psychological adaptations. One\nconsistent theme in the theoretical work of evolutionary psychologists\nis that \u201cadaptations, the functional components of organisms,\nare identified [\u2026] by [\u2026] evidence of their design: the\nexquisite match between organism structure and environment\u201d\n(Hagen 2005, 148). The way in which psychological adaptations are\nidentified is by evolutionary functional analysis, which is a type of\nreverse\n engineering.[8]\n \u201cReverse engineering is a process of figuring out the design of\na mechanism on the basis of an analysis of the tasks it performs.\nEvolutionary functional analysis is a form of reverse engineering in\nthat it attempts to reconstruct the mind\u2019s design from an\nanalysis of the problems the mind must have evolved to solve\u201d\n(Buller 2005, 92). Many philosophers object to evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 over attribution of adaptations on the basis of\napparent design. Here some are following Gould and Lewontin\u2019s\n(1979) lead when they worry that accounting for apparent design in\nnature in terms of adaptation amounts to telling just-so stories but\nthey could just as easily cite Williams (1966), who also cautioned\nagainst the over attribution of adaptation as an explanation for\nbiological traits. While it is true that evolutionary functional\nanalysis can lend itself to just-so story telling, this is not the\nmost interesting problem that confronts evolutionary psychology,\nseveral other interesting problems have been identified. For example,\nElisabeth Lloyd (1999) derives a criticism of evolutionary psychology\nfrom Gould and Lewontin\u2019s criticism of sociobiology, emphasizing\nthe point that evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism leads\nthem to ignore alternative evolutionary processes. Buller takes yet\nanother approach to evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism.\nWhat lies behind Buller\u2019s criticisms of evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 adaptationism is a different view than theirs\nabout what is important in evolutionary thinking (Buller 2005). Buller\nthinks that evolutionary psychologists overemphasize design and that\nthey make the contentious assumption that with respect to the traits\nthey are interested in, evolution is finished, rather than\nongoing.\n\nSober\u2019s definition of adaptation is not constrained only to\napply to organs or other traits that exhibit apparent design. Rather,\nclutch size (in birds), schooling (in fish), leaf arrangement,\nforaging strategies and all manner of traits can be adaptations (cf.\nSeger and Stubblefield 1996). Buller argues the more general point\nthat phenotypic plasticity of various types can be an adaptation,\nbecause it arises in various organisms as a result of natural\n selection.[9]\n The difference here between Buller (and other philosophers and\nbiologists) and evolutionary psychologists is a difference in the\nexplanatory scope that they attribute to natural selection. For\nevolutionary psychologists, the hallmark of natural selection is a\nwell functioning organ and for their critics, the results of natural\nselection can be seen in an enormous range of traits ranging from the\nspecific apparent design features of organs to the most general\nresponse profiles in behavior. According to Buller, this latter\napproach opens up the range of possible evolutionary hypotheses that\ncan account for human behavior. Rather than being restricted to\naccounting for our behavior in terms of the joint output of many\nspecific modular mechanisms, we can account for our behavior by\nappealing to selection acting upon many different levels of traits.\nThis difference in emphasis on what is important in evolutionary\ntheory also is at the center of debates between evolutionary\npsychologists and behavioral ecologists, who argue that behaviors,\nrather than just the mechanisms that underlie them, can be adaptations\n(cf. Downes 2001). Further, this difference in emphasis is what leads\nto the wide range of alternate evolutionary hypotheses that Sterelny\n(Sterelny 2003) presents to explain human behavior. Given that\nphilosophers like Buller and Sterelny are adaptationists, they are not\ncritical of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism. Rather,\nthey are critical of the narrow explanatory scope of the type of\nadaptationism evolutionary psychologists adopt (cf. Downes 2015).\n\nBuller\u2019s criticism that evolutionary psychologists assume that\nevolution is finished for the traits that they are interested in\nconnects worries about the understanding of evolutionary theory with\nworries about the testing of evolutionary hypotheses. Here is Tooby\n& Cosmides\u2019 clear statement of the assumption that Buller is\nworried about: \u201cevolutionary psychologists primarily explore the\ndesign of the universal, evolved psychological and neural architecture\nthat we all share by virtue of being human. Evolutionary psychologists\nare usually less interested in human characteristics that vary due to\ngenetic differences because they recognize that these differences are\nunlikely to be evolved adaptations central to human nature. Of the\nthree kinds of characteristics that are found in the design of\norganisms \u2013 adaptations, by-products, and noise \u2013 traits\ncaused by genetic variants are predominantly evolutionary noise, with\nlittle adaptive significance, while complex adaptations are likely to\nbe universal in the species\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 39). This\nline of thinking also captures evolutionary psychologists\u2019 view\nof human nature: human nature is our collection of universally shared\nadaptations. (See Downes and Machery 2013 for more discussion of this\nand other, contrasting biologically based accounts of human nature.)\nThe problem here is that it is false to assume that adaptations cannot\nbe subject to variation. The underlying problem is the constrained\nnotion of adaptation. Adaptations are traits that arise as a result of\nnatural selection and not traits that exhibit design and are universal\nin a given species (cf. Seger and Stubblefield 1996). As a result, it\nis quite consistent to argue, as Buller does, that many human traits\nmay still be under selection and yet reasonably be called adaptations.\nFinally, philosophers of biology have articulated several different\ntypes of adaptationism (see e.g. Godfrey-Smith 2001; Lewens 2009;\nSober 2000). While some of these types of adaptationism can be\nreasonably seen placing constraints on how evolutionary research is\ncarried out, Godfrey-Smith\u2019s \u201cexplanatory\nadaptationism\u201d is different in character (Godfrey-Smith 2001).\nExplanatory adaptationism is the view that apparent design is one of\nthe big questions we face in explaining our natural world and natural\nselection is the big (and only supportable) answer to such a big\nquestion. Explanatory adaptationism is often adopted by those who want\nto distinguish evolutionary thinking from creationism or intelligent\ndesign and is the way evolutionary psychologists often couch their\nwork to distinguish it from their colleagues in the broader social\nsciences. While explanatory adaptationism does serve to distinguish\nevolutionary psychology from such markedly different approaches to\naccounting for design in nature, it does not place many clear\nconstraints on the way in which evolutionary explanations should be\nsought (cf. Downes 2015). So far these are disagreements that are\nlocated in differing views about the nature and scope of evolutionary\nexplanation but they have ramifications in the discussion about\nhypothesis testing.\n\nIf the traits of interest to evolutionary psychologists are\nuniversally distributed, then we should expect to find them in all\nhumans. This partly explains the stock that evolutionary psychologists\nput in cross cultural psychological tests (see e.g. Buss 1990). If we\nfind evidence for the trait in a huge cross section of humans, then\nthis supports our view that the trait is an adaptation \u2014on the\nassumption that adaptations are organ-like traits that are products of\nnatural selection but not subject to variation. But given the wider\nscope view of evolution defended by philosophers of biology, this\nmethod of testing seems wrong-headed as a test of an evolutionary\nhypothesis. Certainly such testing can result in the very interesting\nresults that certain preference profiles are widely shared cross\nculturally but the test does not speak to the evolutionary hypothesis\nthat the preferences are adaptations (cf. Lloyd 1999; Buller\n2005).\n\nAnother worry that critics have about evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 approach to hypothesis testing is that they give\ninsufficient weight to serious alternate hypotheses that fit the\nrelevant data. Buller dedicates several chapters of his book on\nevolutionary psychology to an examination of hypothesis testing and\nmany of his criticisms center around the introduction of alternate\nhypotheses that do as good a job, or a better job, of accounting for\nthe data. For example, he argues that the hypothesis of assortative\nmating by status does a better job of accounting for some of\nevolutionary psychologists\u2019 mate selection data than their\npreferred high status preference hypothesis. This debate hangs on how\nthe empirical tests come out. The previous debate is more closely\nconnected to theoretical issues in philosophy of biology.\n\nI said in my introduction that there is a broad consensus among\nphilosophers of science that evolutionary psychology is a deeply\nflawed enterprise and some philosophers of biology continue to remind\nus of this sentiment (see e.g. Dupre 2012). However the relevant\nconsensus is not complete, there are some proponents of evolutionary\npsychology among philosophers of science. One way of defending\nevolutionary psychology is to rebut criticism. Edouard Machery and\nClark Barrett (2007) do just that in their sharply critical review of\nBuller\u2019s book. Another way to defend evolutionary psychology is\nto practice it (at least to the extent that philosophers can, i.e.\ntheoretically). This is what Robert Arp (2006) does in a recent\narticle. I briefly review both responses below.\n\nMachery and Barrett (2007) argue that Buller has no clear critical\ntarget as there is nothing to the idea that there is a research\ntradition of evolutionary psychology that is distinct from the broader\nenterprise of the evolutionary understanding of human behavior. They\nargue that theoretical tenets and methods are shared by many in the\nbiology of human behavior. For example, many are adaptationists. But\nas we saw above, evolutionary psychologists and behavioral ecologists\ncan both call themselves adaptationist but their particular approach\nto adaptationism dictates the range of hypotheses that they can\ngenerate, the range of traits that can be counted as adaptations and\nimpacts upon the way in which hypotheses are tested. Research\ntraditions can share some broad theoretical commitments and yet still\nbe distinct research traditions. Secondly, they argue against\nBuller\u2019s view that past environments are not stable enough to\nproduce the kind of psychological adaptations that evolutionary\npsychologists propose. They take this to be a claim that no\nadaptations can arise from an evolutionary arms race situation, for\nexample, between predators and prey. But again, I think that the\ndisagreement here is over what counts as an adaptation. Buller does\nnot deny that adaptations\u2014 traits that arise as a product of\nnatural selection\u2014arise from all kinds of unstable environments.\nWhat he denies is that organ-like, special purpose adaptations are the\nlikely result of such evolutionary scenarios. \n\nArp (2006) defends a hypothesis about a kind of module\u2014scenario\nvisualization\u2014a psychological adaptation that arose in our\nhominid history in response to the demands of tool making, such as\nconstructing spear throwing devices for hunting. Arp presents his\nhypothesis in the context of demonstrating the superiority of his\napproach to evolutionary psychology, which he calls \u201cNarrow\nEvolutionary Psychology,\u201d over \u201cBroad Evolutionary\nPsychology,\u201d with respect to accounting for archaeological\nevidence and facts about our psychology. While Arp\u2019s hypothesis\nis innovative and interesting, he by no means defends it conclusively.\nThis is partly because his strategy is to compare his hypothesis with\narchaeologist Steven Mithen\u2019s (see e.g. 1996) non-modular\n\u201ccognitive fluidity\u201d hypothesis that is proposed to\naccount for the same data. The problem here is that Mithen\u2019s\nview is only one of the many alternative, evolutionary explanations of\nhuman tool making behavior. While Arp\u2019s modular thesis may be\nsuperior to Mithen\u2019s, he has not compared it to Sterelny\u2019s\n(2003; 2012) account of tool making and tool use or to Boyd and\nRicherson\u2019s (see e.g. 2005) account and hence not ruled these\naccounts out as plausible alternatives. As neither of these\nalternative accounts rely on the postulation of psychological modules,\nevolutionary psychology is not adequately defended.\n5. Moral Psychology and Evolutionary Psychology\n\nMany philosophers who work on moral psychology understand that their\ntopic is empirically constrained. Philosophers take two main\napproaches to using empirical results in moral psychology. One is to\nuse empirical results (and empirically based theories from psychology)\nto criticize philosophical accounts of moral psychology (see e.g.\nDoris 2002) and one is to generate (and, in the experimental\nphilosophy tradition, to test) hypotheses about our moral psychology\n(see e.g. Nichols 2004). For those who think that some (or all) of our\nmoral psychology is based in innate capacities, evolutionary\npsychology is a good source of empirical results and empirically based\ntheory. One account of the make-up of our moral psychology follows\nfrom the massive modularity account of the architecture of the mind.\nOur moral judgments are a product of domain specific psychological\nmodules that are adaptations and arose in our hominid forebears in\nresponse to contingencies in our (mostly) social environments. This\nposition is currently widely discussed by philosophers working in\nmoral psychology. An example of this discussion follows.\n\nCosmides (see e.g. 1989) defends a hypothesis in evolutionary\npsychology that we have a cheater-detection\nmodule.[10]\nThis module is hypothesized to underlie important components of our\nbehavior in moral domains and fits with the massively modular view of\nour psychology in general. Cosmides (along with Tooby) argues that\ncheating is a violation of a particular kind of conditional rule that\ngoes along with a social contract. Social exchange is a system of\ncooperation for mutual benefit and cheaters violate the social\ncontract that governs social exchange (Cosmides and Tooby 2005). The\nselection pressure for a dedicated cheater-detection module is the\npresence of cheaters in the social world. The cheater-detection module\nis an adaptation that arose in response to cheaters. The\ncheater-detection hypothesis has been the focus of a huge amount of\ncritical discussion. Cosmides and Tooby (2008) defend the idea that\ncheat detection is modular over hypotheses that more general rules of\ninference are involved in the kind of reasoning behind cheater\ndetection against critics Ron Mallon (2008) and Fodor (2008). Some\ncriticism of the cheater-detection hypothesis involves rehashing\ncriticisms of massive modularity in general and some treats the\nhypothesis as a contribution to moral psychology and invokes different\nconsiderations. For example, Mallon (2008) worries about the coherence\nof abandoning a domain general conception of ought in our conception\nof our moral psychology. This discussion is also ongoing. (See e.g.\nSterelny 2012 for a selection of alternate, non-modular explanations\nof aspects of our moral psychology.)\n6. Human Nature\n\nEvolutionary psychology is well suited to providing an account of\nhuman nature. As noted above (Section 1), evolutionary psychology owes\na theoretical debt to human sociobiology. E.O. Wilson took human\nsociobiology to provide us with an account of human nature (1978). For\nWilson human nature is the collection of universal human behavioral\nrepertoires and these behavioral repertoires are best understood as\nbeing products of natural selection. Evolutionary psychologists argue\nthat human nature is not a collection of universal human behavioral\nrepertoires but rather the universal psychological mechanisms\nunderlying these behaviors (Tooby and Cosmides 1990). These universal\npsychological mechanisms are products of natural selection, as we saw\nin Section 2. above. Tooby and Cosmides put this claim as follows:\n\u201cthe concept of human nature is based on a species-typical\ncollection of complex psychological adaptations\u201d (1990, 17). So,\nfor evolutionary psychologists, \u201chuman nature consists of a set\nof psychological adaptations that are presumed to be universal among,\nand unique to, human beings\u201d (Buller 2005, 423). Machery\u2019s\n(2008) nomological account of human nature is based on, and very\nsimilar to, the evolutionary psychologists\u2019 account. Machery\nsays that \u201chuman nature is the set of properties that humans\ntend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species\u201d\n(2008, 323). While Machery\u2019s account appeals to traits that have\nevolved and are universal (common to all humans), it is not limited to\npsychological mechanisms. For example, he thinks of bi-pedalism as\npart of the human nature trait cluster. Machery\u2019s view captures\nelements of both the sociobiological view and the evolutionary\npsychology view of human nature. He shares the idea that a trait must\nbe a product of evolution, rather than say social learning or\nenculturation, with both these accounts.\n\nSome critical challenges to evolutionary psychological accounts of\nhuman nature (and the nomological account) derive from similar\nconcerns as those driving criticism of evolutionary psychology in\ngeneral. In Section 4. we see that discussions of evolutionary\npsychology are founded on disagreements about how adaptation should be\ncharacterized and disagreements about the role of variation in\nevolution. Some critics charge evolutionary psychologists of assuming\nthat adaptation cannot sustain variation. Buller\u2019s (2005)\ncriticism of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 account of human nature\nalso invokes variation (cf. Hull 1986; and Sober 1980). The idea here\nis that humans, like all organisms, exhibit a great deal of variation,\nincluding morphological, physiological, behavioral and cultural\nvariation (cf. Amundson 2000). Buller argues that the evolutionary\npsychology account of human nature either ignores or fails to account\nfor all of this variation (c.f. Lewens 2015; Odenbaugh Forthcoming;\nand Ramsey 2013). Any account that restricts human nature to just\nthose traits we have in common and which also are not subject to\nchange, cannot account for human variation.\n\nBuller\u2019s (2005) criticism of evolutionary psychologists\u2019\nnotion of human nature (or the nomological account) is based on the\nidea that we vary across many dimensions and an account of human\nnature based on fixed, universal traits cannot account for any of this\nvariation. The idea that to account for human nature, we must account\nfor human variation is presented and defended by evolutionary\npsychologists (see e.g. Barrett 2015), anthropologists (see e.g.\nCashdan 2013) and philosophers (see e.g. Griffiths 2011 and Ramsey\n2013). Barrett agrees with Buller (and others) that evolutionary\npsychologists have failed to account for human variation in their\naccount of human nature. Rather than seeing this challenge as a knock\ndown of the whole enterprise of accounting for human nature, Barrett\nsees this as a challenge for an account of human nature. Barrett says\n\u201cWhatever human nature is, it\u2019s a biological phenomenon\nwith all that implies\u201d (2015, 321). So, human nature is \u201ca\nbig wobbly cloud that is different from the population clouds of\nsquirrels and palm trees. To understand human minds and behaviors, we\nneed to understand the properties of our own cloud, as messy as it\nmight be\u201d (2015, 232). Rather than human nature being a\ncollection of shared fixed universal psychological traits, for\nBarrett, human nature is the whole human trait cluster, including all\nof the variation in all of our traits. This approach to human nature\nis sharply different than the approach defended by either Wilson,\nTooby and Cosmides or Machery but is also subject to a number of\ncriticisms. The main thrust of the criticisms is that such a view\ncannot be explanatory and is instead merely a big list of all the\nproperties that humans have had and can have (See e.g. Buller 2005;\nDownes 2016; Futuyma 1998; and Lewens 2015). Discussion over the\ntension between evolutionary psychologists\u2019 views and the\nmanifest variation in human traits continues in many areas that\nevolutionary psychologists focus on. Another example of this broader\ndiscussion is included in Section 7. below.\n7. Applications of Evolutionary Psychology and Prospects for Further Debate\n\nEvolutionary psychology is invoked in a wide range of areas of study,\nfor example, in English Literature, Consumer Studies and Law. (See\nBuss 2005 for discussion of Literature and Law and Saad 2007 for a\ndetailed presentation of evolutionary psychology and consumer\nstudies.) In these contexts, evolutionary psychology is usually\nintroduced as providing resources for practitioners, which will\nadvance the relevant field. Philosophers have responded critically to\nsome of these applications of evolutionary psychology. One concern is\nthat often evolutionary psychology is conflated with evolution or\nevolutionary theory in general (see e.g. Leiter and Weisberg 2009 and\nDownes 2013). The discussion reviewed in Section 4. above, reveals a\ngood deal of disagreement between evolutionary theorists and\nevolutionary psychologists over the proper account of evolution.\nEvolutionary psychologists offer to enhance fields such as Law and\nConsumer Studies by introducing evolutionary ideas but what is in fact\noffered is a selection of theoretical resources championed only by\nproponents of a specific approach to evolutionary psychology. For\nexample, Gad Saad (2007) argues that Consumer Studies will profit\ngreatly from the addition of adaptive thinking, i.e. looking for\napparent design, and by introducing hypothetical evolved modules to\naccount for consumer behavior. Many do not see this as an effort to\nbring evolutionary theory, broadly construed, to bear on Consumer\nStudies (cf. Downes 2013). Promoting disputed theoretical ideas is\ncertainly problematic but bigger worries arise when thoroughly\ndiscredited work is promoted in the effort to apply evolutionary\npsychology. Owen Jones (see e.g. 2000; 2005), who believes that Law\nwill benefit from the application of evolutionary psychology,\nchampions Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer\u2019s (2000) widely\ndiscredited view that rape is an adaptation as exemplary evolutionary\nwork (see de Waal 2000, Coyne and Berry 2000, Coyne 2003, Lloyd 2003,\nVickers and Kitcher 2003, and Kimmel 2003). Further, Jones (2000)\nclaims that the critics of Thornhill and Palmer\u2019s work have no\ncredibility as scientists and evolutionary theorists. This claim\nindicates Jones\u2019 serious disconnect with the wider scientific\n(and philosophical) literature on evolutionary theory (cf. Leiter and\nWeisberg 2009).\n\nAside from monitoring the expansion efforts of evolutionary\npsychology, there are a number of other areas in which further\nphilosophical work on evolutionary psychology will be fruitful. The\nexamples given above of work in moral psychology barely scratch the\nsurface of this rapidly developing field. There are huge numbers of\nempirical hypotheses that bear on our conception of our moral\npsychology that demand philosophical scrutiny. (Hauser 2006 includes a\nsurvey of a wide range of such hypotheses.) Also, work on moral\npsychology and the emotions can be drawn together via work on\nevolutionary psychology and related fields. Griffiths (1997) directed\nphilosophical attention to evolution and the emotions and this kind of\nwork has been brought into closer contact with moral psychology by\nNichols (see e.g. his 2004). In philosophy of mind there is still much\nthat can be done on the topic of modules. Work on integrating\nbiological and psychological concepts of modules is one avenue that is\nbeing pursued and could be fruitfully pursued further (see e.g.\nBarrett and Kurzban 2006; Carruthers 2006) and work on connecting\nbiology to psychology via genetics is another promising area (see e.g.\nMarcus 2004). In philosophy of science, I have no doubt that many more\ncriticisms of evolutionary psychology will be presented but a\nrelatively underdeveloped area of philosophical research is on the\nrelations among all of the various, theoretically different,\napproaches to the biology of human behavior (cf. Downes 2005;\nGriffiths 2008; and Brown et al. 2011). Evolutionary psychologists\npresent their work alongside the work of behavioral ecologists,\ndevelopmental psychobiologists and others (see e.g. Buss 2005; Buss\n2007) but do not adequately confront the theoretical difficulties that\nface an integrated enterprise in the biology of human behavior.\nFinally, while debate rages between biologically influenced and other\nsocial scientists, most philosophers have not paid much attention to\npotential integration of evolutionary psychology into the broader\ninterdisciplinary study of society and culture (but see Mallon and\nStich 2000 on evolutionary psychology and constructivism). In\ncontrast, feminist philosophers have paid attention to this\nintegration issue as well as offered feminist critiques of\nevolutionary psychology (see Fehr 2012, Meynell 2012 and the entry on\n feminist philosophy of biology).\n Gillian Barker (2015), shares some evolutionarily based criticisms of\nevolutionary psychology with philosophers of biology discussed in\nSection 4. but also assesses evolutionary psychology in relation to\nother social sciences. She also adds a novel critical appraisal of\nevolutionary psychology. She argues that, as currently practiced,\nevolutionary psychology is not a fruitful guide to social policy\nregarding human flourishing.\n\nThe publication of Shackleford and Weekes-Shackleford\u2019s (2017)\nhuge collection of articles on issues arising in the evolutionary\npsychological sciences provides a great resource for philosophers\nlooking for material to fuel critical discussion. Many evolutionary\npsychologists are aware of the difficulty variation presents for some\nestablished approaches in their field. This issue confronts those\ninterested in developing accounts of human nature, as noted above\n(Section 6.), but also arises when confronting many of the varying\nhuman behaviors evolutionary psychologists seek to account for. For\nexample, human aggression varies along many dimensions and\nconfronting and accounting for each of these types of variation is a\nchallenge for many evolutionary psychologists (cf. Downes and Tabery\n2017). Given that evolutionary psychology is just one, among many,\nevolutionarily based approaches to explaining human behavior, the most\npromising critical discussions of evolutionary psychology should\ncontinue to come from work that compares hypotheses drawn from\nevolutionary psychology with hypotheses drawn from other evolutionary\napproaches and other approaches in the social sciences more broadly\nconstrued. Stephan Linquist (2016) takes this approach to evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 work on cultures of honor. Linquist introduces\nhypotheses from cultural evolution that appear to offer more\nexplanatory bite than those from evolutionary psychology. The broader\nissue of tension between evolutionary psychology and cultural\nevolution here will doubtless continue to attract the critical\nattention of philosophers (See Lewens 2015 for a nice clear\nintroduction to and discussion of alternative approaches to cultural\nevolution.).\n\nFinally, philosophers of science will doubtless continue to check the\ncredentials of evolutionary ideas imported into other areas of\nphilosophy. Philosophers of biology in particular, still voice\nsuspicion if philosophers borrow their evolutionary ideas from\nevolutionary psychology rather than evolutionary biology. Philip\nKitcher (2017) voices this concern with regards to Sharon\nStreet\u2019s (2006) appeals to evolution. Kitcher worries that\nStreet does not rely on \u201cwhat is known about human\nevolution\u201d (2017, 187) to provide an account of how her traits\nof interest may have emerged. As noted above, Machery\u2019s nomological notion of human nature (2008; 2017) is\ncriticized on the grounds that he takes his idea of an evolved trait\nfrom evolutionary psychology as opposed to evolutionary biology.\nBarker (2015) also encourages philosophers, as well as social\nscientists, to draw from the huge range of theoretical resources\nevolutionary biologists have to offer, rather than just from those\nprovided by evolutionary psychologists.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arp, R., 2006, \u201cThe environments of our hominid ancestors,\ntool-usage and scenario visualization\u201d, <em>Biology and\nPhilosophy</em>, 21: 95\u2013117.", "Barker, G., 2015, <em>Beyond Biofatalism: Human Nature for an\nEvolving World</em>, New York: Columbia University Press.", "Barrett, H.C., 2015, <em>The Shape of Thought: How mental\nadaptations evolve</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012, \u201cEvolutionary\nPsychology\u201d, in <em>Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive\nScience</em>, W.
