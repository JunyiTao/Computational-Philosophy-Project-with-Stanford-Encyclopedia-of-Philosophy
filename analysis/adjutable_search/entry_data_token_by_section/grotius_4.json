    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n4. Political Philosophy\n\nAs the previous section stressed, Grotius\u2019 natural law theory\nwas about much more than politics; it offered an account of\nnormativity of all kinds. At the same time as he was concerned to\nexplicate normativity generally speaking, the evidence unambiguously\nsuggests that he was especially interested in political issues. After\nall, he did lead a very political life and his two greatest works are\neminently political. In this section, a few of his political ideas are\ndiscussed.\n\nLet\u2019s start with one closely connected to the problem of\nobligation. Just now, it was said that the ground of obligation lay in\nour natures as rational, social, self-preserving beings. This is\ncorrect but it needs amplification. Grotius did not conceive of our\nessences as static; instead, they are dynamic, expressive of our\nabilities and activities. This is emphatically reflected in his\nconception of rights (ius, or iura in the plural).\nHe distinguishes between several meanings of iura, the most\nimportant of which conceives of a ius as \u201ca moral\nquality of a person, making it possible to have or to do something\ncorrectly\u201d (DIB I.1.4). For Grotius, a ius or\nright is a capacity or power possessed by the agent; it is a\n\u201cfaculty\u201d or an \u201captitude\u201d of the person\n(ibid.). To have a ius is to have the ability to engage in\ncertain specified actions without moral or legal sanction. So, for\nexample, when he endows humans with the right to self-preservation, he\ngrants us the power to pursue our own interests without needing the\npermission or assistance of the state or any other authority. Because\nrights are centered on the individual subject, one will often read\nthat Grotius propounded a theory of \u201csubjective right\u201d\n(see, e.g., Kingsbury & Roberts 1990: 31 and references\nthere).\n\nThe import of Grotius\u2019 theory of rights can be clarified\ncontrasting it with the dominant medieval conception of iura.\nThis conception stems primarily from Aquinas, who held that \u201cthe\nword ius was first of all used to denote the just thing\nitself\u201d (Summa Theologica II.ii.q57.art1). In its\noriginal usage, ius was applied to things\u2014actions,\nentities, situations\u2014and not persons. As Aquinas and his\nfollowers conceived of it, things earn the appellation\n\u201cright\u201d when they align fully with the natural law. For\ntwo reasons, then, the medieval conception of rights can be thought of\nas \u201cobjective\u201d: first, because the things which are right\nare objects (and not subjects); second, because things become\nworthy of the label \u201cright\u201d when they satisfy an\nobjective, agent-independent set of necessity and sufficient\nconditions, viz., those conditions required for conformity to the\nnatural law. Now, it is true that this medieval view had begun to be\ndisplaced by Grotius\u2019 time; for example, Suarez says that a\n\u201cstrict acceptation of ius\u201d bestows it\n\n\nupon a certain moral power which every man has, either over his own\nproperty or with respect to that which is due to him. (De\nlegibus I.2.5)\n\n\nHowever, Grotius is usually given the credit for shifting the paradigm\nfundamentally (see, e.g., Haakonssen 1985: 240 and Schneewind 1998:\n78; for an opposing view, see Irwin 2008: 98). While it took time for\nhis paradigm to become hegemonic, it did eventually prevail. When we\nsay that so-and-so has the right to such-and-such, we usually\nmean that he has the means or power to do\nsuch-and-such: for example, the assertion that someone has the right\nto freedom of thought means that he has the ability to think as he\npleases and no one or no thing can force him to do otherwise. This was\nGrotius\u2019 view; though subsequently mediated by many others, his\ncontribution was essential.\n\nIn addition to its intrinsic interest, Grotius\u2019 innovative\nconception of rights had numerous important consequences. Two examples\nmay serve as illustrations. First, whereas medieval theorists tended\nto speak of \u201cthe right\u201d, Grotius and his successors\nstressed the powers and entitlements of the person who has rights. By\nassociating rights with the powers of a person, moderns were able to\ndistinguish sharply between rights on the one hand versus duties on\nthe other (cf. Finnis 1980: 209). Second, because Grotius made rights\ninto powers or faculties which humans possessed, he played a\ncrucial part in the commoditization of rights. Once rights became\npossessions, they can be traded away just like all other possessions.\nThe means of transfer might not be identical to other exchanges of\ngoods but the essential idea of giving away something in one\u2019s\npossession for something which isn\u2019t is there. As commentators\nhave argued, the commoditization of rights was one of the most\nimportant political developments of the seventeenth century (for more,\nsee especially Macpherson 1962: 3f).\n\nGrotius exploited the latter idea in some of the more notorious parts\nof his corpus. Take the following:\n\n\nAt this point first of all the opinion of those must be rejected who\nhold that everywhere and without exception sovereignty resides in the\npeople, so that it is permissible for the people to restrain and\npunish kings whenever they make a bad use of their power\u2026 We\nrefute it by means of the following arguments.\n\nTo every man it is permitted to enslave himself to any one he pleases\nfor private ownership, as is evident both from the Hebraic and from\nthe Roman Law. Why, then, would it there not be as lawful for a People\nwho are at their own disposal to deliver up themselves to some one\nperson, or to several persons, and transfer the right of governing\nthem upon him or them, retaining no vestige of that right for\nthemselves? (DIB I.3.8.1).\n\n\nGrotius extends the case elsewhere, insisting that a people may give\ntheir rights to a ruler, receiving a peaceful and stable society in\nreturn (DIB I.4.2.1). But what are the limits placed on the\nruler who has taken possession of these rights? To some readers,\nGrotius\u2019 willingness to allow agents to transfer their rights\nleaves him open to charges of befriending despots. Provided that the\ninitial transfer of rights was legitimate, then once the ruler is in\npossession of rights, those living under him or her have no right to\ncomplain that certain forms of behavior are unjust, for they have no\nrelevant rights at all. As Rousseau put it, Grotius \u201cspares no\npains to rob the people of all their rights and invest kings with\nthem\u201d (Social Contract, Book II, Chapter Two). To be\nsure, other readers denied that Grotius\u2019 theory allowed agents a\ntotal transfer of their rights; in particular, they contended that\nagents will always retain their fundamental rights, such as the right\nof self-defense (see Locke as interpreted by Tuck 1979: 172\u20133).\nNevertheless, whatever the theory itself actually implies, it remains\nthat Grotius himself seems to have believed that agents may surrender\nall liberties in certain circumstances (for more, see DIB\nI.3.9\u201316).\n\nOn a more positive note, Grotius\u2019 recognition of the\ntransferability of rights led him to a novel solution for one of the\ngreat problems of political philosophy. What is the source of the\nstate\u2019s right or power? Two traditional answers were (1)\nGod\u2014he set up the state and it derives its authority from his\nsanction\u2014and (2) might\u2014because the state is powerful, it\nhas the authority to govern, for might makes right. While Grotius\nflirts with both of these, he finally settled for something else. He\nwrites in the DIP,\n\n\njust as every right [ius] of the magistrate comes to him from\nthe state, so has the same right come to the state from private\nindividuals; and similarly, the power of the state is the result of\ncollective agreement. (Chap. Eight)\n\n\nThrough innumerable, separate, sequential decisions occurring over a\nprotracted period of time, individuals gradually agreed to form\ninstitutions for governing society by imbuing them with some of power\nwhich they naturally possess. Eventually, these institutions gelled\ninto a single coherent entity which is the state. The state\u2019s\npower, then, is the product neither of God nor of sheer force but\ninstead of the willful transference of individuals\u2019 powers or\nrights to it. It may be a mistake to interpret this idea as a nascent\ncontractualism (see Tuck 1993: 178\u20139) but likewise, it would be\na mistake to deny the appeal it would have to later contractualists\nsuch as Hobbes.\n\nAll of this underscores Grotius\u2019 real but uneven contributions\nto the doctrines of political liberalism which were being formulated\nin his time. To the emerging theory of liberalism, he gave the idea\nthat individuals\u2014both individual persons and individual groups\nof persons\u2014are bearers of rights. Also, he advanced the\ncompelling second-order account of the nature of those rights\ndescribed above. And he argued strongly in support of the attribution\nof several specific first-order rights: for example, besides those\nwhich have already been mentioned (such as self-defense), he\nvigorously defended rights to property. However, as important as these\nand other contributions to liberalism are, they must be balanced\nagainst some of Grotius\u2019 other views. For instance, while it is\ntrue that he thought individuals had rights, it is also true that he\nthought there were a number of circumstances in which those rights\nmight be surrendered or even just overridden. So the rights that we\nare supposed to have in Grotius\u2019 theory are not completely\nassured. More sinister are his views on slavery, which is or at least\ncan be an entirely just institution. In the DIP he writes\nthat Aristotle is not \u201cmistaken when he says that certain\npersons are by nature slaves\u201d (Chap. Six, Quest. V, Art. One).\nWhile Grotius may have repudiated this thought in the DIB\n(see III.7.1\u2014but see also I.3.8.4), a simple argument continued\nto convince him that slavery is compatible with a just society. If\nindividuals may sell their labor, Grotius reasons, then they should\nalso be able to sell their liberty. If they sell all of their liberty,\nthen they are of course slaves (I.3.8.1). A final weight to be placed\non the balance of Grotius\u2019 liberalism is his view on the status\nof rulers or sovereigns. Because sovereignty is \u201cthat\npower\u2026 whose actions are not subject to the legal control of\nanother\u201d (DIB I.3.7.1), it follows as a necessary truth\nthat those who hold sovereignty are necessarily superior to all\nothers. Because they are necessarily superior to the rest, Grotius\nconsiders rebarbative the suggestion that sovereigns are answerable to\ntheir subjects. They may wish to take the needs of her or his subjects\ninto account (III.15) but this is only \u201cpraiseworthy\u201d and\nnot imperative. In sum, then, Grotius\u2019 contributions to\npolitical liberalism are comparable to Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke and\nother seventeenth century luminaries. They are genuine and significant\nwhile mixed with decidedly non-liberal themes.\n",
