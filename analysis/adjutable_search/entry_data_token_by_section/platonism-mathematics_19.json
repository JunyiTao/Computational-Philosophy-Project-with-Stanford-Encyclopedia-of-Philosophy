    "main_text": "Between object realism and mathematical platonism || Lightweight semantic values\n4.4 Inspiration from Aristotle\n\nWe conclude by describing two further examples of lightweight forms of\nobject realism that reject the platonistic analogy between\nmathematical objects and ordinary physical objects. Both examples are\ninspired by Aristotle.\n\nFirst, perhaps mathematical objects exist only in a potential manner,\nwhich contrasts with the actual mode of existence of ordinary physical\nobjects. This idea is at the heart of the ancient notion of potential\ninfinity (Lear 1980, Linnebo & Shapiro 2019). According to\nAristotle, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in\nthe sense that, however large a number we have produced (by\ninstantiating it in the physical world), it is possible to produce an\neven larger number. But Aristotle denies that the natural numbers are\nactually infinite: this would require the physical world to\nbe infinite, which he argues is impossible. \n\nFollowing Cantor, most mathematicians and philosophers now defend the\nactual infinity of the natural numbers. This is made possible in part\nby denying the Aristotelian requirement that every number needs to be\ninstantiated in the physical world. When this is denied, the actual\ninfinity of the natural numbers no longer entails the actual infinity\nof the physical world. \n\nHowever, a form of potentialism about the hierarchy of sets continues\nto enjoy considerable support, especially in connection with the\niterative conception of sets (Parsons 1977, Jan\u00e9 2010, Linnebo\n2013, Studd 2013). No matter how many sets have been formed, it is\npossible to form even more. If true, this would mean that sets have a\npotential form of existence which distinguishes them sharply from\nordinary physical\n objects.[16]\n\n\nSecond, perhaps mathematical objects are ontologically dependent or\nderivative in a way that distinguishes them from independently\nexisting physical objects. According to what Rosen (2011) calls\n\u201cqualified realism\u201d, mathematical facts are grounded in\nother facts that do not involve mathematical objects. For example, the\nnatural numbers exist, but their existence and their properties and\nrelations are grounded in facts more fundamental than the arithmetical\nones, e.g., in facts about provability or about structural\npossibilities. The view can also be given a more Aristotelian spin by\ntaking simple arithmetical truths to be grounded in facts about\nappropriately numerous pluralities that instantiate the relevant\nnumbers (Schwartzkopff 2011, Donaldson 2017). For example, \\(2+2=4\\)\nis grounded in any fact about a pair and a disjoint pair making a\nquadruple. There are other versions of the view as well. For example,\nKit Fine (1995) and others argue that a set is ontologically dependent\non its elements. (This view is also closely related to the\nset-theoretic potentialism mentioned above.) \n",
