    "main_text": "Aristotelian Background || Framework and Terminology of the Categories\n2.1 Framework and Terminology of the Categories\n\n\nThroughout the Categories Aristotle assumes that relations\ncomprise one of the accidental categories, and hence that they must be\nunderstood as items inhering in particular substances. This\nhelps to explain why, unlike contemporary philosophers, who speak of\nrelations as holding between two or more things, Aristotle\nprefers to speak of them as inhering in one thing and somehow pointing\ntoward (pros) another. Indeed, Aristotle\u2019s preferred\nname for relations is just \u2018things toward something\u2019\n(ta pros ti).\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it is customary for philosophers to refer to\nrelations not only by Aristotle\u2019s term, \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 (or ad aliquid, the verbatim Latin\nequivalent of pros ti), but also by two others as well:\n\u2018relative\u2019 (relativum) and \u2018relation\u2019\n(relatio). In the early Middle Ages, philosophers often move\nfreely among these terms without paying much attention to their\nvarious\n senses.[7]\n Over time, however, they come to emphasize their differences,\nsometimes giving elaborate explanations as to why one must be regarded\nas more appropriate than the others. To give just one example,\nconsider the following passage from Albert the Great:\n\n\nNow the most general genus in the arrangement of this predicable is\ntoward something (ad aliquid), or relative\n(relativum), or less properly speaking, relation\n(relatio), as some people say. But it must be recognized that\nthe most general genus is signified most clearly by the name\n\u2018toward something\u2019, which is a preposition together with\n[the term] \u2018something\u2019 in [the accusative] case. For this\nname conveys the two things that are in a relative, namely: [i]\ndiversity, which the preposition indicates through its taking an\nobject (transitionem), and [ii] the direction of the\ncomparison, which the accusative case indicates when something is\ncalled \u2018toward something\u2019. (Liber de praedicamentis,\n225b.)\n\n\n\n\nWhatever their disagreements about the appropriateness of these\nterms, it was generally agreed that the terms \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 and \u2018relative\u2019 are related to the term\n\u2018relation\u2019 in the way that a concrete term (such as\n\u2018white\u2019) is related to its abstract counterpart (such as\n\u2018whiteness\u2019).\n\n\nSince \u2018relation\u2019 is the term most familiar to us, in\nwhat follows we shall rely on it whenever possible. It is important to\nrecognize, however, that the medievals introduce a host of other\nabstract terms more or less synonymous with \u2018relation\u2019\n(relatio) but whose connotations they often regard as more\ninformative than any of those discussed so far. A partial list of such\nterms includes:\n\n\u2018Comparison\u2019 (comparatio), which has\npsychological overtones, and so is often (though not exclusively) used\nby conceptualists;\n\u2018Outward-looking-ness\u2019 (respectus), which\ndraws on a visual metaphor to suggest that relations are that in\nvirtue of which a substance \u2018looks out toward something\u2019\n(respicit ad aliquid);\n\u2018Disposition\u2019 (habitudo) or \u2018relative\ndisposition\u2019 (habitudo relativa), which suggests that\nrelations account for the way a thing \u2018holds itself toward\nsomething\u2019 (se habere ad aliquid);\n\u2018Order\u2019 (ordo), \u2018ordering\u2019\n(ordinatio), and \u2018directionality\u2019 or\n\u2018toward-ness\u2019 (aditas), which are used to\nindicate that relations account for the order or structure we find in\n the\n world.[8]\n\n\n\nAlthough Aristotle makes scattered remarks about relations throughout\nthe Categories, it is only in chapter 7 that he singles them\nout for detailed independent consideration. Thus, in order to complete our\nsurvey of the relevant Aristotelian background, we need to consider\nbriefly how this chapter was commonly understood by medieval\nphilosophers.\n2.2 Relations in Categories\n\nCategories 7 opens rather abruptly with a definition of\nrelations that Aristotle ultimately regards as unacceptable. According\nto this definition, which medieval philosophers attribute to Plato,\nrelations are things \u201cspoken of\u201d in a certain way. Whether\nor not this definition is really Plato\u2019s, it certainly appears\nto be well entrenched by Aristotle\u2019s time, as is indicated by\nthe fact that Aristotle says we are at least prepared to call\nsomething a relation just in case it satisfies the conditions\nspecified by this definition:\n \n\nWe call the following sorts of things toward something: all those\nthings said to be just what they are of or than\nsomething, or toward something in some other way (any other\nway whatsoever). Thus, what is larger is said to be what it is\nthan another (it is said to be larger than something); and a\ndouble is said to be just what it is of another (it is said\nto be double of something); similarly with all other such\ncases. (Categories 7, 6a36\u20136b.)\n\n\n\n\nAs the medievals interpret it, this definition identifies relations in\nterms of the predicates by means of which they are signified.\nMedievals refer to the predicates in question as \u2018relative\nterms\u2019 (ad aliquid or \n relativa),[9] \n and understand them, roughly speaking, as those terms whose true\npredication requires a comparison to something other than the subject\nof which they are predicated. Thus, \u2018taller\u2019\n(maius) counts as a relative term because when we assert of\nsomething that it is taller\u2014that is, when we\npredicate the term \u2018taller\u2019 of it\u2014we necessarily do\nso in comparison to something else. We don\u2019t say merely that\nSimmias is taller; we say that he is taller than Socrates, or\nTheaetetus, or the average man. Similar remarks apply to\n\u2018double\u2019, as well as to all other relative terms. Borrowing\non the medievals\u2019 behalf the notation of first-order logic, we\ncan make this characterization of relative terms precise by saying\nthat a term F is relative just in case a predication of the\nform \u2018Fx\u2019 is more perspicuously represented as a\npredication of the form \u2018Rxy\u2019. (If a term is not\nrelative, then the medievals say that it is absolute.)\n\n\nThe first or Platonic definition, therefore, characterizes relations\nas the items signified by relative terms\u2014or what we would\nnowadays call \u2018polyadic\u2019 or \u2018many-place\npredicates\u2019. The medievals regard this characterization as\ninitially promising, and often employ it in their writings. In the\nend, however, they think it must be rejected\u2014or at least\nmodified. For according to them, not everything we are prepared to\ncall a relation actually is a relation. In rejecting\nthe first or Platonic definition, the medievals take themselves to be\nfollowing Aristotle himself, who rejects this definition on the\ngrounds that it allows certain substances (namely, heads and hands) to\nqualify as relations. As Aristotle says later in chapter 7:\n\n\nIf the [first] definition of things toward something was adequately\nassigned, then it is exceedingly difficult, or impossible, to reach\nthe conclusion that no substance is toward something. But if, on the\nother hand, it was not adequately assigned, and things toward\nsomething are rather [defined as] those things for which this is\ntheir very being: to be toward another in a certain way, then\nperhaps something may be said about the problem [of heads and\nhands]. (Categories 7, 8a29\u201335.)\n\n\n\n\nHere Aristotle seems to be suggesting that some relative terms fail to\nsignify genuine relations. Although terms such as\n\u2018head\u2019 and \u2018hand\u2019 clearly count as\nrelative\u2014since predications of the form \u2018x is a\nhead\u2019 and \u2018x is a hand\u2019 are more\nperspicuously represented as of the form \u2018x is a head\nof y\u2019 and \u2018x is a hand of\ny\u2019\u2014these terms signify parts of substances rather\nthan relations. On the basis of these and other such examples, the\nmedievals conclude that relations must be identified not with the\nitems signified by relative terms, but rather with a proper subset of\nthem.\n\n\nOf course, this still leaves us with the question of how in general we\nare to distinguish genuine relations from the mere significata of\nrelative terms. Here medieval philosophers think that Aristotle\u2019s\nsecond definition\u2014which we italicized in the passage quoted\nabove\u2014can be of some help. This definition, as it was commonly\ninterpreted, highlights an important metaphysical or functional role\nthat relations must play: in addition to being signified by relative\nterms, they are what actually serve to relate two (or more)\nthings\u2014or to put the point in slightly different terms, they are\nthat in virtue of which such things are related. On this\ninterpretation, Aristotle\u2019s definition provides a clear explanation\nfor why heads and hands fail to qualify as genuine relations. Although\nthey are signified by relative terms, they do not relate anything. On\nthe contrary, they are things standing in relations.\n\n\nThe distinction between what actually serves to relate things (i.e.,\ngenuine relations) and what merely stands in some relation (i.e., the\nrelata of some relation) is often used by medieval\nphilosophers to explain the difference between the two definitions in\nCategories 7. Whereas the first or Platonic definition\nincludes both relations and relata (under relational\ndescriptions), the second or Aristotelian definition includes only\nrelations. This understanding of the difference between the two\ndefinitions provides the basis for a common medieval distinction\nbetween relations merely according to speech (relationes secundum\ndici) and relations according to being or nature (relations\nsecundum esse). As Aquinas says, in a well-known passage of his\nSumma Theologiae:\n\n\nSome relative terms\u2014such as \u2018master\u2019 and\n\u2018slave\u2019, \u2018father\u2019 and\n\u2018son\u2019\u2014are introduced to signify relative\ndispositions themselves (ipsas habitudines relativas); these\nterms express things relative secundum esse. But other\nrelative terms\u2014such as \u2018mover\u2019 and\n\u2018moved\u2019, \u2018head\u2019 and \u2018headed\u2019, and\nterms of this sort\u2014are introduced to signify things on which\ncertain relations follow; these terms express things relative\nsecundum dici. (Summa Theologiae I, q. 13, a. 7, ad\n1.)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough medieval philosophers generally accept the distinction\nbetween relations secundum dici and relations secundum\nesse, and place heads and hands (and other body parts) in the\nformer category, they sometimes disagree about the placement of\ncertain other examples\u2014most notably, knowledge and\nperception. Clearly, the names of these accidents are relative terms,\nsince predications of the form \u2018x is knowledge\u2019\nor \u2018x is a perception\u2019 are more perspicuously\nrepresented as of the form \u2018x is knowledge of\ny\u2019 and \u2018x is a perception of\ny\u2019. But should we characterize the accidents themselves\nas genuine relations (i.e., relations secundum esse)? Or\nshould we rather say that they are qualities on which certain\nrelations follow (i.e., relations secundum esse dici)? Near the\nend of Categories 7, Aristotle suggests an epistemic\ncriterion that promises to resolve these questions. But because the\ncriterion itself is difficult to understand, and there is no clear\nalternative to it, debate about these sorts of examples continues\nthroughout the Middle Ages.\n\nCategories 7 ends almost as abruptly as it began. Having\ndefended his own preferred definition of relations, Aristotle leaves\nus with the following cautionary remarks:\n\n\nIt is perhaps hard to make firm statements on such questions without\nhaving examined them many times. Still, to have gone through the\nvarious difficulties is not unprofitable. (Categories 7,\n8b22\u201324.)\n\n\n\n\nBoethius, whose Latin translation is responsible for transmitting\nthese words to the Middle Ages, takes Aristotle\u2019s remarks here\nto be inviting further refinements and improvements on his own\naccount:\n\n\nAristotle would never have said this if he were not prompting us to\nfurther reflection and to even greater exercise of subtlety. Because\nof his exhortation, we shall not hesitate in the least to raise\n[further] questions and offer [our own] solutions to them in other\nplaces. (In Categorias Aristotelis, 238.)\n\n\n\n\nLike Boethius, medieval philosophers are happy to take up this\ninvitation\u2014and, indeed, as we shall see, to develop\nAristotle\u2019s account of relations in some striking and original\nways of their own.\n3. Relations in Medieval Philosophy\n\n\nAs we have seen, Aristotle begins his discussion of relations in the\nCategories with the assumption that relations are a certain\ntype of accident, and then inquires after their proper\ncharacterization, eventually arriving at the view that they are a\nproper subset of the entities signified by relative\nterms\u2014namely, all and only those that actually serve to relate\ntwo or more things.  Medieval philosophers tend to reverse Aristotle\u2019s\napproach, beginning where he ends. That is to say, they tend to start\ntheir discussion with the view that relations are entities that are\nboth signified by relative terms and play a certain metaphysical\nrole, and then proceed to ask about the precise nature and\nontological status of these entities\u2014in particular whether they must,\nin every case, be identified with Aristotelian accidents. There are at\nleast two reasons for this reversal. First, the medievals see nothing\nin Aristotle\u2019s preferred characterization of relations that requires\nrelations to be accidents (or indeed, entities of any ontological\ntype). Second, and perhaps more importantly, the medievals think that\nthere are certain situations that require relations to be something\nother than accidents (more on this in Section 5 below).\n3.1 The Rejection of Polyadic Properties\n\n\nAlthough medieval philosophers generally regard Aristotle\u2019s\ncharacterization of relations as ontologically neutral, there is one\ntype of entity they standardly assume that relations could never\nbe\u2014namely, polyadic or many-place properties. For all their\ndifferences, the medievals tend to agree on the following point: polyadic properties\ncannot exist outside the mind.\n\n\nHistorians of philosophy sometimes speak as if the medievals could not even\nhave possessed the concept of a polyadic property\u2014as if\nconceiving of relations in this way only became possible in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, with the advent of a formal logic\nof relations and multiple quantification (Cf. Weinberg 1965,\nesp. 61\u201363). But this is surely mistaken.  What recent advances in\nlogic have made possible is not the concept of a polyadic property,\nbut merely its representation within a formal system. Moreover, as we\nhave already seen, the notion of a polyadic predicate, from which\nour own concept of a polyadic property is derived, corresponds exactly\nto the medieval notion of a relative term.  And if that by itself\nweren\u2019t enough, there is the fact that medievals habitually speak of\nrelations in polyadic terms, explicitly comparing them to a road\nthat runs between two cities (via), or to a palisade running\nbetween two watchtowers (inter-vallum) (Cf. Albert\nthe Great, Liber de praedicamentis, 241a-241b; Aquinas\nSumma Theologiae I, q. 28, a. 4, obj. 5; and the texts of\nHarclay). Nor do they take themselves to be original in this\nregard. On the contrary, they take themselves merely to be following a\nsuggestion of Aristotle\u2019s in the Physics, which itself just\nappears to be part-and-parcel of the common sense conception of\nrelations (see Physics III, 202b11\u201315). As Peter Aurieol says\nat one point:\n\n\nIn the third book of his commentary on the Physics, comment\ntwenty, the Commentator [=Averroes] says that a relation is a\ndisposition (dispositio) existing between two\nthings.  But even apart from him it is clear that fatherhood is\nconceived of as if it were a kind of medium connecting a father with\nhis son. And the same is true of other relations.  (Scriptum super\nPrimum Sententiarum, fols. 318va-b. See Henninger\n1989, 153\u20134, n. 12, for the Latin text.)\n\n\n\n\nIn light of passages such as these, it is hard to take seriously the\nsuggestion that the medievals\u2014or indeed, any reflective\nbeings\u2014lack the concept of a polyadic property.\n\n\nIn addition to possessing this concept, there is evidence that at\nleast some medieval philosophers also posit the existence of polyadic\nproperties. In an important paper, Heine Hansen has argued that this\nis certainly true in the case of the thirteenth-century philosopher,\nNicholas of Paris. (See Hansen 2012.) And further research may well\nturn up other medieval philosophers holding the same view. At present,\nhowever, Nicholas appears to be something of an anomolous case.\n\n\nIndeed, despite possessing the concept of a polyadic property, medieval\nphilosophers are often explicit in their denial of anything in extramental\nreality exactly corresponding to such a concept. If we return to the passage just\nquoted from Auriol, we can see that, immediately after describing\nrelations as a sort of \u2018interval\u2019 (intervallum),\nhe proceeds to deny the existence of any such intervals in extramental\nreality.\n\n\nIt appears that a single thing, which must be imagined as some sort of\ninterval (intervallum) existing between two things, cannot\nexist in extramental reality, but only in the intellect. [This appears\nto be the case] not only because nature does not produce such\nintervals, but also because a medium or interval of this sort does not\nappear to be in either of the two things [it relates] as in a\nsubject, but rather between them where it is clear that there\nis nothing which can serve as its subject. (Scriptum super Primum\nSententiarum, fols. 318va-b.)\n\n\n\n\nAs this passage helps to make clear, the root of the standard medieval\nobjection to polyadic properties is ontological in nature, stemming\nfrom a particular conception of subjects and attributes. Following\nAristotle, the medievals divide extramental beings into\nsubstances and accidents, a division which they take to be both exclusive and\nexhaustive (since it is given in terms of a contradictory pair of\nproperties, namely, being in a subject vs. not being in a\nsubject) (Cf. Categories 1, 1a20\u20131b6). Now in the case\nof substances, it is perhaps clear that they are not polyadic in\nnature. But medievals typically think the same is also true of their accidents.\nThus, as Aquinas says at one point in his Sentences\ncommentary, in response to the question whether it is possible for\n\u201cnumerically one and the same relation\u201d to belong to\nbelong to two subjects at a time: \u201cNo, this cannot be, for one\naccident cannot belong to two subjects\u201d (In Sent. I,\nd. 27, q. 1, a. 1, ad 2).\n\n\nAlthough the medievals\u2019 objection to polyadic properties stems in large\npart from ontological considerations, they also offer\nother reasons for rejecting them. Sometimes these involve\nconsiderations of theoretical parsimony. As Ockham is so fond of\nsaying: \u201cIt is futile to do with more [entities] what can be\ndone with\n fewer\u201d.[10]\n Other times, however, these reasons involve phenomenological or\nepistemological considerations. Albert the Great, for example, objects\nto polyadic properties on the grounds that we are not presented in\nexperience with anything but individuals and their so-called absolute\nattributes\u2014that is, substances and their quantities and\n qualities.[11]\n3.2 Anti-Realism about Relations\n\n\nThe rejection of polyadic properties might seem to commit one to a\nform of anti-realism about relations\u2014that is, to the view that\nrelations exist only in the mind. This was, in fact, the position of\nPeter Auriol. If there are no polyadic properties or\n\u2018intervals\u2019, he assumes, then there is nothing in\nextramental reality to correspond to our relational concepts. But in\nthat case, he says, \u201ca relation cannot be posited except in\napprehension\n alone\u201d.[12]\n\n\nGiven the current state of medieval research, it is difficult to know\nhow widespread this (or any other) form of anti-realism was during the\nMiddle Ages. Shortly after Auriol\u2019s death, certain aspects of\nhis anti-realism appear to have met with considerable success. Ockham\nand his followers, for example, accept Auriol\u2019s view that\nrelations exist only in the mind as concepts or beings of reason\n(entia rationis), though unlike Auriol, as we shall see, they\nthink this is compatible with saying that things are related\nindependently of the activity of the mind. And we can find echoes of\nthe same sort of view in the writings of early modern\n philosophers.[13]\n\n\nPrior to the fourteenth century, however, it is difficult to identify\nany unambiguous representatives of anti-realism, at least in the Latin\nWest. Albert the Great claims to find something akin to Auriol\u2019s\nargument in the writings of Alfarabi (d. 950) and Avicenna (d. 1037),\nbut he does not say whether either of these figures actually endorses\nit or merely presents it for consideration (See Liber de\npraedicamentis, 222b-223a).\n Again, Aquinas suggests that a similar view can be found in the\nwritings of Gilbert of Poitiers and his followers, the so-called\nPorretani, but his suggestion is controversial, and in any case\nAquinas reports that Gilbert later retracted the view in the face of\ntheological controversy (Cf.  Summa Theologiae I, q. 28,\na. 2, corpus; cf. also Veckley 1965, 28\u20139). Unless further research\nalters the current picture, therefore, it would appear that, although\nanti-realism may have had something of a foothold in the Arabic\nspeaking world, most notably among the members of a group of orthodox\nMuslim theologians known as the Mutakallim\u016bn, in its more radical\nforms it was always a minority position in the Latin\n West.[14]\n3.3 Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nIf we take anti-realism to be the view that (a) nothing in extramental\nreality corresponds to our relational concepts and (b) nothing is\nrelated independently of the activity of the mind, it is not hard to\nsee why most medieval philosophers would reject it. Like most of us,\nthey recognize the utter implausibility of saying that facts like\nSimmias\u2019s being taller than Socrates are somehow dependent on\nthe activity of the\n mind.[15]\n Indeed, as they often point out, this sort of anti-realism is\ninconsistent with even such basic facts as the real structure of the\nuniverse, the existence of real composition, causality, spatial\nproximity, or even the objectivity of mathematical knowledge. Speaking\nfor the majority, Ockham says in his Ordinatio:\n\n\nThe intellect does nothing to bring it about that the universe is one,\nor that a whole is composed [of its parts], or that causes in spatial\nproximity [to their effects actually] cause [their effects], or that a\ntriangle has three [angles], etc. \u2026 any more than [the\nintellect] brings it about that Socrates is white or that fire is hot\nor water cold. (Ordinatio I, d. 30, q. 1 in Opera\nTheologica iv, 316\u2013317. Cf. also Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 1, q. 5, n. 224 in Opera Omnia; Aquinas, De\npotentia, q. 7, a. 9.)\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to such common sense considerations, the medievals also\nidentify various philosophical and theological grounds for opposing\nanti-realism about relations. Here we shall mention just two. First, it\nis hard to see how such anti-realism is to be squared with the\nstandard interpretation of the Aristotelian categories. \u201cFor\nnothing is placed in a category\u201d as Aquinas says \u201cunless\nit is something existing outside the soul\u201d (De\npotentia, q. 7, a. 9). Again, this sort of anti-realism seems\nincompatible with the orthodox Christian view of the Trinity. Indeed,\nit is precisely for this reason that the existence of real relations\nin God is affirmed at the Council of Rheims in 1148, and that shortly\nthereafter it becomes customary to say that the denial of this entails\na form of heresy known as Sabellianism (Cf., e.g., Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 28, a. 1 and De potentia q. 8,\na.1).\n\n\nBut of course, all of this raises a question. How is it that\nmedieval philosophers maintain a form of realism about relations while\nat the time rejecting the existence of polyadic properties? In\nparticular, what do they say about arguments such as Auriol\u2019s,\nwhich in effect deny the coherence of realism without polyadic\nproperties? Here it is useful to consider the work of Albert\nthe Great. Although he writes a generation before Auriol, he explicitly\naddresses his sort of argument, and the reply he offers appears to be\nperfectly standard.\n\n\nAccording to Albert, the problem with arguments of the sort Auriol\ngives is that they rely on a questionable assumption, namely: if\nthere are no real polyadic forms or properties, then there is nothing\nin extramental reality to correspond to our relational concepts.\nThis assumption would be true, he suggests, if our conceptual\nframework displayed an exact isomorphism to the structure of the\nworld. But it does not, and hence there is no reason in principle why\na polyadic concept cannot have something non-polyadic corresponding to\n it.[16]\n In making this sort of reply, Albert aligns himself with a medieval\ntradition of rejecting the view that for every distinct type of\nconcept there is a distinct type of entity. This view is often\nassociated in medieval philosophy with Plato and his followers, and by\nthe time of Ockham it is regarded, somewhat hyperbolically, as the\nsource or root (radix) of the greatest errors in\nphilosophy. \u201cTo multiply beings according to the multiplicity of\nterms\u201d Ockham says \u201cis erroneous and leads far\naway from the truth\u201d (Summa Logica I, c. 51 in\nOpera Philosophica i, 171; cf. Loux, 1974, 171).\n\n\nFor most medieval philosophers, then, the question is not\nwhether there are any things in extramental reality\ncorresponding to our relational concepts, but what these\nthings are like in themselves. Having ruled out the possibility of\ntheir being polyadic, however, the medievals don\u2019t leave\nthemselves with many options. Indeed, because they accept a broadly\nAristotelian ontology, they have no choice but to identify relations\nwith either individual substances or their monadic properties.\n\n\nAs we noted earlier, philosophers throughout the medieval period are\nattracted to the view suggested by Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories that relations (or the items corresponding to our\nrelational concepts) are accidents. Of course, as we also noted, the\nmedievals cannot take this view to be perfectly general, since they\nalso admit cases, especially theological ones, which involve relations\nbut no accidents. But even so, until the fourteenth century, this view\nis taken to apply so widely that it functions as a kind of paradigm\nfor thinking about relational situations. Thus, if a predication of\nthe form \u2018aRb\u2019 is true, it is generally assumed\nthat what makes it true is a pair of individuals, a and\nb, and a pair of accidents, F and G. As we\nshall see in the next section, it is within the context of this\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations that one of the most\nhotly disputed and intractable debates of all the Middle Ages\narises.\n4. Paradigmatic Relational Situations\n\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Boethius highlights an\ninteresting feature of Aristotle\u2019s discussion of relations.  Whenever\nAristotle refers to the category of relations, he always does so in\nthe plural (\u2018things toward something\u2019), thereby departing\nfrom his usual practice of referring to categories in the singular\n(\u2018substance\u2019, \u2018quantity\u2019,\n\u2018quality\u2019, etc.). This certainly reinforces the\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations, which requires\nrelations to come in pairs. But Boethius thinks there is a further\nreason why Aristotle refers to the category in this way\u2014namely,\nbecause its members are unique in that they cannot be\nunderstood to exist by themselves:\n\n\nThings toward something [or relations] cannot be grasped by the\nintellect by themselves or individually, so that we could say that\nthings toward something exist individually. Whatever is known\nregarding the nature of a relation must be considered together with\nsomething else. For example, when I speak of a master, this by itself\nmeans nothing if there is no slave. The naming of one relative\nimmediately brings with it another thing toward something. (In\nCategorias Aristotelis, 217.)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Boethius, medieval philosophers often take Aristotle\u2019s use\nof the plural to indicate that the category of relations must be at\nleast conceived of as containing pairs of correlatives or\nconverse relational accidents (see, e.g., Abelard, Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019, 80\u201395; and Albert the Great,\nLiber de praedicamentis, 22). As we shall see, this point\nbecomes important for their understanding of those relational\nsituations that do not conform to the paradigm analysis of the\nCategories.\n\n\nFor now, however, let us focus on the those relational situations\nthat do conform to the paradigm. As the medievals recognize, there are\na number of questions that can be raised about the relations they\ninvolve\u2014call them \u2018paradigmatic relations\u2019. What sort\nof monadic properties or accidents are they, and how are we to\nunderstand them? As it turns out, there are only two main\npositions one can take. For convenience, we shall refer to them,\nrespectively, as \u2018reductive\u2019 and \u2018non-reductive\nrealism\u2019.\n\n\nAccording to reductive realism, which is the simplest or most\nontologically parsimonious form of realism (without polyadic\nproperties), paradigmatic relations are to be identified with\nordinary, non-relational accidents\u2014that is to say, with\naccidents falling under Aristotelian categories other than\nrelation. Thus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, this is to be\nexplained by their respective heights, which fall under the category\nof quantity. Again, if Socrates is similar (say, in color) to Theaetetus,\nthis is to be explained by Socrates\u2019s and Theaetetus\u2019s\nparticular colors, which fall under the category of quality. And so on\nfor other paradigmatic relations.\n\n\nAccording to non-reductive realism, by contrast, paradigmatic\nrelations are to be identified not with ordinary, non-relational\naccidents, but rather with accidents of a sui generis type.\nThus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, this is to be explained by\nappealing to a pair of sui generis accidents that are distinct\nfrom, but nonetheless necessitated by, Simmias\u2019s and\nSocrates\u2019s heights. Again, Socrates\u2019s similarity to Theaetetus\nis to be explained not by their respective colors, but by a pair of\nsui generis accidents necessitated by them. And so on for the\nrelations involved in other paradigmatic relational situations.\n\n\nIn the medieval discussion of relations, it is this\ndifference\u2014the difference between reductive and non-reductive\nrealism\u2014that constitutes the greatest divide among philosophers,\nand representatives of both positions can be found throughout the\nmedieval period. Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Albert the Great\n(d. 1280) are, perhaps, the clearest representatives of reductive and\nnon-reductive realism, respectively, in the early and high Middle\nAges, whereas William Ockham (d. 1347) and John Duns Scotus (d. 1308)\nare well-known representatives of these positions in the later Middle\nAges.  Again, some philosophers appear to have held different\npositions at different stages of their career. Henry Harclay\n(d. 1317), for example, began his career as a staunch defender of\nScotus\u2019s non-reductive realism, but by the end of it gravitated\ntowards a position that is much closer to, and in many ways\nanticipates, Ockham\u2019s specific form of reductive\n realism.[17]\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-thirteenth century, the debate between reductive\nand non-reductive realists is often carried out in the context of the\ndiscussion whether relations are identical to their foundations. (This\nis the context, for example, in which Scotus and Ockham develop their\npositions.) By the mid-thirteenth century, moreover, it is customary\nto admit at least a conceptual distinction between relations and the\nnon-relational accidents in virtue of which these relations hold. The\nrelevant non-relational accidents come to be referred to as the\n\u2018grounds\u2019 or \u2018foundations\u2019 of relations\n(fundamenta), since their possession is thought to\nnecessitate the holding of relations. Hence, in this context, the\nimportant question is whether the distinction between relations and\ntheir foundations is merely conceptual.\n\n\nWe might expect that reductive realists would always answer this\nquestion in the affirmative, whereas non-reductive realists would\nalways answer it in the negative. It turns out, however, this is not\nthe case. For reasons to be explained below, there are some reductive\nrealists who, in spite of rejecting that relations comprise a sui\ngeneris type of monadic property, nonetheless maintain that\nrelations are in an important sense really distinct from their\nfoundations. In light of this complication, we shall continue to cast\nthe medieval debate about the nature of paradigmatic relations in terms\nof reductive and non-reductive realism rather than in terms of the\nidentity or real distinctness of relations and their foundations.\n4.1 Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nAs mentioned above, on the simplest or most ontologically\nparsimonious form of realism without polyadic properties, what we are\ncalling \u2018reductive realism\u2019, paradigmatic relations are\nidentified with ordinary, non-relational monadic properties or\naccidents. Now we might expect this form of realism to appeal to\nanyone committed to realism without polyadic properties. After all,\nfailure to reduce such relations to such accidents threatens to make\nthem mysterious. If paradigmatic relations are monadic properties, but\nnot ordinary, non-relational accidents, then how are we to understand\nthem?\n\n\nConsiderations of intelligibility certainly play a role in the debate\nbetween medieval reductive and non-reductive realists. As we shall\nsee, non-reductive realists typically recognize that the chief\ndifficulty for their view lies in specifying the precise nature of the\nsui generis monadic properties to which they appeal. More often\nthan not, however, reductive realists object to non-reductivists on\ngrounds of theoretical parsimony. This is certainly true in the case\nof Abelard and Ockham, whom we earlier identified as reductive\nrealists. In the case of Abelard, such considerations are not\nexplicitly formulated, though they are part-and-parcel of his general\napproach to metaphysics and philosophy of\n language.[18]\n In the case of Ockham, by contrast, the appeal to parsimony is much\nmore explicit, often taking the form of what has come to be known as\nOckham\u2019s razor: \u201cPlurality should not be assumed without\n necessity\u201d (Ordinatio I, d. 30, q. 2 in Opera\nTheologica iv, 322).\n\n\nAnother consideration that plays an important role in the debate\nbetween reductive and non-reductive realists has to do with the proper\ninterpretation of authoritative texts. Since medieval philosophers\ndevelop their theories of relations in the course of reflecting on\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, they often present their views as the\none actually suggested (or even required) by the text itself. Abelard,\nfor example, suggests that his reductive theory is a direct\nconsequence of Aristotle\u2019s second definition of relations. Thus, when\nAristotle characterizes relations in Categories 7 as\n\u201cthose things for which this is their very being: being toward\nsomething in a certain way,\u201d Abelard argues that this should be\ninterpreted to mean that relations are items that make other\nthings to be relatives. Just as certain attributes (say, being\nred, juicy, and sweet) make their subjects good, so too, he suggests,\ncertain accidents (such as being-six-feet-tall and five-feet-ten)\nrelate their subjects (See Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019, 216\u201317. For further discussion, see\nBrower 1998).\n\n\nTextual considerations and direct appeals to Aristotle\u2019s\nauthority play a much bigger role in early medieval debates than they\ndo in the high and later Middle Ages, when literal commentary was no\nlonger the dominant form of philosophical literature. Nonetheless,\nthese sorts of considerations continue to be important throughout the\nMiddle Ages. Even Ockham, in his Summa logicae, addresses the\nissue of whether Aristotle should be interpreted as holding some form\nof non-reductive realism:\n\n\nThere are many theologians of this opinion, and at one time even I\nbelieved it to have been Aristotle\u2019s opinion. Now, however, it seems\nto me that the contrary opinion follows from his principles. (Summa\nlogicae I, c. 49 in Opera Philosophica i, 154. Cf.\nHenninger 1989, 120.)\n\n\n\n\nOne final argument used by reductive realists to motivate their\nposition is worth mentioning here. This argument has to do with the\nnature of relational change. Almost all medievals accept the\nintuitively plausible view that things can acquire (and lose)\nrelations without undergoing any real (as opposed to merely Cambridge)\nchange.  Thus, Socrates can come to be shorter than Simmias solely in\nvirtue of a change in Simmias\u2019s\n height.[19]\n As reductive realists such as Ockham often point out, this fact about\nrelational change admits of a ready explanation on their position,\nsince Socrates\u2019s relation is nothing over and above\nSimmias\u2019s and Socrates\u2019s heights, the latter of which\nnever changes. By contrast, the same fact appears to pose a serious\nchallenge for the non-reductive realist. For if Socrates\u2019s\nrelation is something distinct from Simmias\u2019s and\nSocrates\u2019s heights, then apparently Socrates must acquire\nsomething new when Simmias\u2019s height increases. But then,\ncontrary to the original intuition, the non-reductive realist must say\nthat Socrates undergoes a real change after all.\n\n\nThese considerations are not the only ones that reductive realists\nappeal to, but they are among the most important for understanding\ntheir position, and we shall rely on them in what follows to motivate\nand clarify the alternative position of the non-reductive\n realists.[20]\n\n\nBefore leaving the topic of reductive realism, we need to take account\nof a slight complication. In our discussion to this point, we have been\nspeaking as if reductive realists always intend to identify individual\nparadigmatic relations such as tallness or shortness with pairs of\nmonadic properties taken jointly. We have done this because,\nat least initially, this seems to be the most natural way to\nunderstand their position. After all, it is not Simmias\u2019s height\ntaken by itself that necessitates his being taller than anyone; it is\nonly his height taken together with that of another, say,\nSocrates. And yet, despite the naturalness of this way of construing\nreductive realism, it is not the way its proponents typically\nunderstand\n it.[21]\n On the contrary, instead of identifying relations such as tallness or\nshortness with pairs of monadic properties taken jointly, reductive\nrealists typically identify them with the individual members of such\npairs. Thus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, it is only Simmias\u2019s\nheight that is identified with Simmias\u2019s tallness (and hence said to\ncorrespond to the concept \u2018taller than\u2019), whereas\nSocrates\u2019s height is identified with Socrates\u2019s shortness (and hence\nsaid to correspond to the concept \u2018shorter than\u2019). But how\nis this possible, especially if the properties in question are\nsupposed to be just ordinary heights?\n\n\nReductive realists recognize the worry here, as well as the initial\nattraction of identifying relations with pairs of accidents taken\njointly. As evidence, consider the following passage from one of Henry\nHarclay\u2019s later works.  Here Henry not only entertains the suggestion\nthat relations could be identified with pairs of monadic properties,\nbut draws on a common medieval view about number to make it\nplausible:\n\n\nA relation is clearly a reality distinct from one foundation, but\nnot a reality distinct from both foundations. For when one white thing\n[such as Simmias] is posited and then another white thing [such as\nSocrates] is posited, there is a relation beginning at that point.\nThus, the similarity is not a [single] whiteness, but two whitenesses\nexisting at once. Indeed, the two whitenesses can be sufficient to\nconstitute a single species in the genus of relation. Just as two\ndiscrete unities of whatever magnitude are sufficient for producing a\nsingle species of number, so too the same thing holds for the case at\nhand. Again, just as plurality or multitude is not a reality different\nfrom the constituents of the plurality or multitude, neither is the\nsimilarity [of the white things] different [from their\nwhitenesses]. (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n.\n 46)[22]\n\n\n\nDespite Henry\u2019s attraction to this sort of view, he\nfeels compelled to reject it on the grounds that it leads\nto certain absurdities. Drawing on Avicenna for support, he says:\n\n\nAvicenna argues against this on the basis of relations involving\ninferiority and superiority, for it is clearer in those cases than it\nis for other relations, such as those involving equals. For fatherhood\nis in the father alone and not in the son \u2026 and the same thing\nholds of sonship. Therefore one must hold that there are two relations\n[here]. And in this case it is clear that the relation is not the same\nreality as [the two] foundations because the relation is not in\neverything in which the foundation of the relatum is. This is\nthe case, too, for relations involving equals, even if it is not\n as\n clear. (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 46)\n\n\n\n\nHenry\u2019s worry here can be expressed as follows. If a relation such as\nfatherhood is identified with a pair of accidents, then it will follow\nthat fatherhood is partly in the son (since the pair is such that one\nof its members is in the son). But this is absurd. Fatherhood is an\nasymmetrical relation (or as Harclay prefers to put it, a relation\ninvolving superiority and inferiority). That is to say, fatherhood is\nsuch that if an individual a has it in respect of another\nindividual, b, then b cannot have fatherhood in\nrespect of a. But according to Harclay, this is tantamount to\nsaying that \u201cfatherhood is in the father alone and not in the\nson\u201d. And of course he doesn\u2019t think the point is restricted to\nfatherhood. On the contrary, it also holds true of all relations,\nincluding symmetrical relations or \u201cthose involving equals, even\nif it is not as clear\u201d (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 47).\n\n\nBut if relations are not to be identified with pairs of accidents, how\ncan reductive realists think of them in terms of ordinary,\nnon-relational accidents? After all, the only other option seems to be\nidentifying them with ordinary accidents taken\nindividually\u2014which as we have seen is problematic. An ordinary\naccident such as Simmias\u2019s height cannot necessitate Simmias\u2019s being\ntaller than anyone.  Indeed, it was precisely this point that led us\nto conclude that \u2018relative-making\u2019 is a description best\nreserved for pairs of accidents taken jointly.\n\n\nNote, however, that it is open to the reductive realist to respond by\nsaying that, although Simmias\u2019s height is not by itself\nrelative-making, it is nonetheless potentially\nrelative-making. In that case, however, the reductive realist can insist\nthat in the presence of another height, such as Socrates\u2019s, it\nbecomes actually relative-making\u2014that is to say, it\ncomes actually to relate Simmias to Socrates. This suggests a third\noption for reductive realists: to maintain that relations are to be\nidentified with ordinary, non-relational accidents in certain\ncircumstances.\n\n\nIn fact, it is this last sort of view that most reductive realists\nduring the medieval period actually hold. Indeed, as we are\ninterpreting Harclay, this is precisely the view he goes on to develop\nin the discussion we have been\n following.[23] \n Simmias\u2019s being taller than Socrates is to be identified, on his\nview, not with Simmias\u2019s height tout court, but with\nSimmias\u2019s height in certain circumstances\u2014including the\ncircumstance that Socrates is\n five-feet-ten.[24]\n To put Harclay\u2019s view in a slightly different way, which will\nhelp to bring out its semantic consequences, we might say that in a\nworld in which Simmias exists by himself a predication of the form\n\u2018Simmias is taller than Socrates\u2019 will be false, and hence\nnothing will correspond to the relational term \u2018taller\nthan\u2019. But in a world in which Simmias is six-feet-tall while\nSocrates is five-feet-ten, a predication of the same form will be\ntrue, and in this world there will be something corresponding to\n\u2018taller\u2019, namely, Simmias\u2019s height. In such a world,\nmedieval philosophers would say that \u2018taller\u2019 primarily\nsignifies Simmias\u2019s height, but indirectly signifies or connotes the\nheight of\n Socrates.[25]\n\n\nAs it turns out, it is not only reductive realists, but non-reductive\nrealists as well that speak of relations as accidents of single\nsubjects\u2014that is, of Simmias\u2019s tallness as something belonging\nonly to him, of Socrates\u2019s shortness as something belonging only to\nhim, and so on for all other particular relations. In light of what\nhas just been said, therefore, we can clarify our understanding of the\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations. As indicated earlier,\nthis analysis requires that when a predication of the form\n\u2018aRb\u2019 is true, what makes it true is a pair of\nindividuals, a and b, and a pair of monadic\nproperties or accidents, F and G. Reductive\nrealists, as we have just seen, identify F and G\nwith ordinary categorial accidents, whereas non-reductive realists\nidentify them with accidents of sui generis type. But however\nwe construe the nature of these accidents, both reductive and\nnon-reductive realists deny that it is the pair of\naccidents\u2014that is, F and G taken\njointly\u2014that corresponds to our relational concepts. On the\ncontrary, they say, F directly corresponds to one of our\nrelational concepts, whereas G directly corresponds to its\nconverse. Thus, when Simmias is taller than Socrates, reductivists and\nnon-reductivists are agreed that it is an accident of Simmias that\ndirectly corresponds to (or as they would prefer to say, is primarily\nsignified by) the concept \u2018taller than\u2019, and an accident\nof Socrates that is primarily signified by the concept \u2018shorter\nthan\u2019. To the extent they disagree, therefore, their\ndisagreement concerns only whether the accidents primarily signified\nby relational concepts can also be signified by ordinary\nnon-relational concepts (and if so, precisely how and under what\ncircumstances).\n\n\nWith these clarifications in mind, let us turn now to the\nconsiderations that led some medieval philosophers to reject reductive\nrealism in favor of some form of non-reductivism.\n4.2 Non-Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nOf all the considerations favoring non-reductive realism, perhaps none\nis more compelling than the intuition that relations have a different\nnature or \u201cquiddity\u201d from that of ordinary categorial\naccidents. As we have seen, medieval philosophers recognize that\npredications involving relative terms (such as \u2018x is\ntaller\u2019) are incomplete in a way that monadic or absolute\npredications (such as \u2018x is white\u2019) are not. They\nalso recognize, moreover, that unlike absolute terms relative terms\ncome in pairs or sets. Every relative term has a correlative, and the\nmeaning of the one (say, \u2018taller\u2019) cannot be understood in\nisolation from the meaning of the other (\u2018shorter\u2019). These\nfacts about relative terms and predication are often thought to show\nthat their significata have a distinct nature or quiddity from the\nordinary, absolute accidents that serve as their foundations. Here\nagain it is useful to quote Harclay:\n\n\nAvicenna (Metaphysics III, the chapter on relation) says that\na relation has its own quiddity distinct from the quiddity of its\nfoundation. Therefore it is a distinct reality. Moreover, in the\nCategories Aristotle says that the being associated with\nrelatives is being-toward-something-else (ad aliud se\nhabere).  But it is not the case that the being of a foundation\nis being-toward-something-else. Therefore they are not the same.\n(\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 43.)\n\n\n\n\nReductive realists can, of course, explain the uniqueness of relative\nterms and predications without introducing relations over and above\ntheir foundations. For they can always (a) assert that relative terms\nare associated with concepts whose content is distinct from that of\nany non-relational or absolute concepts, and yet (b) insist that this\nis all that is required to explain the peculiar nature of relative\nterms and predications. Even so, the question remains: If Simmias\u2019s\nbeing taller than Socrates is nothing ontologically over and above\nSimmias\u2019s and Socrates\u2019s heights, why do we represent it as\nif it were? At this point, it would seem that reductive realists\nhave no choice but to appeal to our psychological make-up. We simply\ndo (or at least can) represent one and the same situation in two very\ndifferent ways. As Ockham says in one of his Quodlibetal\nquestions, using a slightly different example:\n\n\nSocrates is similar to Plato by the very fact that Socrates is white\nand Plato is white \u2026 Yet, despite this, the intellect can\nexpress these many absolute things by means of concepts in diverse\nways: in one way, by means of an absolute concept, as when one says\nsimply \u2018Socrates is white\u2019 or \u2018Plato is\nwhite\u2019; in a second way, by means of a relative concept, as when\none says \u2018Socrates is similar to Plato with respect to\nwhiteness\u2019. (Quodl. VI, q. 25 in Opera\nTheologica ix, 679.)\n\n\n\n\nEven if one does not find this sort of appeal to psychology\nimplausible, the non-reductive realists would seem to have a more\nsatisfying reply to our original question. For they can say that the\nreason we represent relational situations as distinct from\nnon-relational situation is because they are\ndistinct. Indeed, non-reductive realists can add that the logical\nincompleteness of predicates such as \u2018taller\u2019 (and its\ncorrelative, \u2018shorter\u2019) calls our attention to precisely\nwhat makes these situations distinct\u2014namely, the sui\ngeneris accidents that are possessed by Simmias and Socrates in\naddition to their respective heights.\n\n\nNow as most non-reductive realists recognize, there is a difficulty\nposed by their position\u2014namely, that of giving a perspicuous\naccount of the nature of paradigmatic relations or relational\naccidents. But they often attribute this difficulty to the fact that\nthe nature in question is sui generis. As Albert the Great\nsays, when he turns to the discussion of relations in his commentary\non Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics:\n\n\nIt is difficult for us to speak about [the category of] toward\nsomething or relation because it has a nature and being altogether\ndifferent from the genera of being which have been considered so far\n[namely, substance, quantity, and quality]. (Metaphysica,\n266a.)\n\n\n\n\nGiven that non-reductivists construe the nature of paradigmatic\nrelations as sui generis, it is not surprising that they feel\nthe need to resort to metaphors to describe it. Albert himself appeals\nmost often to a visual metaphor of outward-looking-ness\n(respectus), and describes individual relations as that in\nvirtue of which a subject \u201clooks out toward another\u201d\n(respicit ad aliud). Other philosophers, rely on other\nmetaphors and variously describe the nature of relations as a kind of\ndirectionality or toward-ness (aditas), as a type of\ndisposition or way of holding oneself (habitudo or\nrelativa habitudo), or again as the source or principle of\nstructure and order \n (ordinatio).[26]\n\n\nOf all these metaphors, the ones involving directionality\u2014or\nintentionality\u2014are likely to be the most helpful to us. For\nthere are contemporary philosophers who characterize\nintentionality, not in terms of a polyadic or many-place property, but\nas a sui generis type of monadic\n property.[27]\n According to these philosophers, intentionality is a property whose\nintrinsic nature is such that, when it is exemplified by a subject in\nappropriate circumstances, which include the presence of an\nappropriate object, it relates its subject to the object in\nquestion\u2014in particular, it relates the subject to it as thinker\nto object thought. This analogy is useful because non-reductive\nrealists typically regard intentionality as a special case (or type)\nof relation. According to them, all paradigmatic relations (or at\nleast all those that qualify as sui generis accidents) are\nproperties whose intrinsic nature is such that their exemplification\nin the appropriate circumstances will relate their subjects to\nsomething else. It is just that in certain cases, these properties\nrelate their subjects specifically as thinkers to objects thought.\n\n\nIn the end, therefore, it would appear that the non-reductive\nrealists do have something to say in response to the\nreductivists\u2019 worries about the mysterious nature of relations\nand their appeals to considerations of theoretical parsimony. But what\nabout the phenomenon of relational change?\n\n\nAs we said earlier, medieval philosophers share the intuition that\nthe acquisition (or loss) of relations can occur without\nany real change on the part of their subject. To explain this intuition,\nsome non-reductivists think it is enough to say that a relation can be\nacquired (or lost) without its subject undergoing any real change\nwith respect to its absolute accidents. Thus, the example of\nSocrates\u2019s coming to be shorter than Simmias is sometimes glossed\nby saying that, with respect to absolute accidents, it is true that\nSocrates comes to be shorter than Simmias solely in virtue of a real\nchange in Simmias. Nonetheless, if we consider Socrates\u2019s\nrelative accidents as well, such non-reductivists will say that\nSocrates has, in fact, undergone a real \u2018relative\u2019\nchange\u2014that is, a real change with respect to one of his\nrelations.\n [28]\n\n\nBut non-reductivists need not take this line. Some, more sympathetic\nto the reductive realist position on relational change, take cases\nlike that involving Simmias and Socrates as an opportunity to further\nclarify the nature of relations. Albert the Great, for example, argues\nthat relational accidents are so closely tied to their foundations\nthat they are acquired along with them (cf. Metaphysica,\n266b-267a, ad 1 and Brower 2001). Thus, if Socrates comes into\nexistence in a world all by himself at a height of\nfive-feet-ten-inches-tall, not only will he possess a certain quantity\n(namely, his height), but also, in virtue of it, he will possess a\nsui generis relational accident. Obviously, in such a world,\nthe relational accident will not actually relate Socrates to\nanyone or anything (since there\u2019s nothing for it to relate him\nto)\u2014though it will explain his being potentially\nrelated to other things.  Suppose, however, that Simmias now comes\ninto existence in this world at six-feet-tall. In that case,\nSocrates\u2019s relational accident will come actually to relate him to\nSimmias as shorter. Even so, Albert insists, Socrates himself will not\nhave undergone any real change, relative or absolute. Not surprisingly\nthese sorts of consideration lead Albert to distinguish sharply\nbetween relational accidents and relations (which are just relational\naccidents in certain circumstances), and to suggest that strictly\nspeaking we should think of the relevant Aristotelian category as\ncomprised, not of relations, but of relational accidents. These same\nconsiderations also help to explain why, in referring to the members\nof this category, Albert prefers the concrete terms \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 (ad aliquid) and \u2018relative\u2019\n(relativum) to the abstract term \u2018relation\u2019\n(relatio)\u2014for relational accidents are \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 or outwardly directed even if they are not actually\nrelating their subject to anything.  (Metaphysica, 267a,\nad. 3.)\n\n\nLike Albert, Aquinas too suggests that there is a close connection\nbetween relational accidents and their foundations. Following Albert\u2019s\nterminology, he suggests that in virtue of possessing a specific\nheight or quantity, an individual such as Socrates is\npotentially equal to all those who have the same height, and\npotentially unequal to\u2014that is, shorter or\ntaller than\u2014all those with a different height (In V\nPhys., lect. 3, n. 8). Like Albert, moreover, Aquinas says that\nsuch an individual can come to be actually equal (or unequal)\nto another solely in virtue of a change in that other, and concludes\nfrom this that relations must be in their foundations as in a root\n(in radice) (In V Phys., lect. 3, n. 8). On some\ninterpretations, Aquinas\u2019s metaphor can be explicated by saying that\nalthough relations and their foundations differ formally\u2014that\nis, involve different accidental forms or properties\u2014nonetheless\ntheir act of being (esse) is the same. Thus, when Socrates\ncomes to be shorter than Simmias as a result of Simmias\u2019s growth,\nSocrates does not undergo a change properly speaking, since he does\nnot acquire any new act of being. Rather, the \u201cold\u201d act of\nbeing of his height (sometimes referred to as the\n\u2018esse-in\u2019 of the relation) merely acquires a new\ndetermination (sometimes referred to as the\n\u2018esse-ad\u2019 of the relation), in this case\n to\n Simmias.[29]\n\n\nWe have seen enough to appreciate the main ontological\ndifferences that divide reductive and non-reductive realists, and even\nsome of the differences that divide non-reductivists among themselves.\nAs we indicated earlier, in the later Middle Ages these differences tend\nto emerge in the context of the debate over whether relations are\nidentical with their foundations. As we also indicated, however, we have\nto be careful not to assume that how philosophers answer this\nquestion provides an infallible guide to their positions. For although\nreductivists typically affirm that relations are identical to their\nfoundations, and non-reductivists typically deny it, there are some\nreductivists who side, at least verbally, with the non-reductivists on\nthis question. Thus, the later Harclay, as we are interpreting him, is a\nreductive realist\u2014he not only rejects the existence of\nsui generis relational properties, but maintains that in\nparadigmatic relational situations, substances are related by their\nordinary, non-relational accidents. Nonetheless, Harclay denies that\nrelations are identical with their foundations, since he thinks this\nwould amount to saying that relations can be straightforwardly\nidentified either with ordinary accidents taken by themselves or with\npairs of such accidents taken jointly.\n \n\nAgain, as we shall point out in the next section, a number of later\nmedieval reductivists, including Ockham, eventually come to reject the\ntraditional Aristotelian characterization of relations as items that\nrelate substances in favor of the view that relations are items\nexisting only in the mind (as concepts). As we shall see, this does\nnot mean that Ockham and others deny that there are extramental\ngrounds for our relational concepts or even that things can be related\nby their foundations independently of the mind. On the contrary, it\nmeans only that, unlike their predecessors, they refuse to call\nanything a relation merely because it grounds a relational concept. The fact that\nthese reductivists regard relations as concepts, however, explains why\nthey too are unwilling to identity relations with their foundations:\nfor the relevant foundations, according to these philosophers, are\nordinary, extramental accidents, and obviously no concept (or act of\nthe mind) could be identical with them.\n\n\nFinally, it must be noted that even the notions of identity and real\ndistinction come to be the subject of controversy during the high and\nlater Middle Ages, and this too has the result of complicating the\ndebate over whether relations are identical to their\n foundations.[30]\n For all these reasons, therefore, we must be careful not to identify\ntoo closely the debate between reductive and non-reductive realists\nwith the debate over whether relations are identical to their\nfoundations.\n5. Non-Paradigmatic Relational Situations\n\n\nSo far we have been focusing only on the medieval discussion of\nparadigmatic relational situations\u2014that is, relational\nsituations conforming to the analysis suggested in Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories. But as we indicated earlier, it is clear from\nsome of Aristotle\u2019s later works, most notably the\nMetaphysics, that he thinks not all relational situations can\nbe made to conform to it. Thus, in Metaphysics V, he suggests\nthat there are some relational situations in which substances are\nrelated, not by a pair of accidents, but by a single accident\nbelonging to just one of them. Here he cites the example of\nintentional relations: if Simmias is thinking about Socrates, this is\nto be explained in terms of nothing but Simmias, Socrates, and an\naccident of Simmias. For the sake of convenience, we shall hereafter\nrefer to relational situations that do not conform to the\nCategories paradigm as \u2018non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations\u2019.\n\n\nAlthough medieval philosophers did not have direct access to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics until the mid-twelfth century, they\ndid feel pressure from other, largely theological sources to admit\nsomething like his non-paradigmatic relational situations. The\nstandard medieval conception of deity, for example, requires that God\nis an absolutely perfect being, possessing no accidents\nwhatsoever. But this conception makes it difficult to explain how God\ncan enter into relational situations. Indeed, as Augustine points out\nin book V of his De Trinitate, there is a special difficulty\nfor those want to combine this conception with the Christian doctrine\nof creation. For this doctrine would seem to require that God first\nlacks, and then acquires a contingent or accidental\nrelation\u2014namely, that of being creator. But then does it not\nalso require that in creating the universe God underwent a real\nchange? And what about the claim that there are no accidents in\nGod?\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s solution, which is adopted by medieval philosophers\ngenerally, is to say that when God acquires a new relation, this is to\nbe explained in terms of properties or accidents of something other\nthan God. Thus, in the case of creation Augustine says:\n\n\nEven though [God\u2019s substance] begins to be [truly] spoken of\n[as related to a creature] at some time, still nothing is to be\nunderstood as having happened to the divine substance itself, but only\nto the creature in relation to whom it is spoken\n of.[31]\n\n\n\nOn the basis of theological considerations, therefore, Augustine is\nled to something like Aristotle\u2019s non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations. What makes it true that God is related to his creatures is\nnothing but God, the creatures, and a monadic property or accident of\nthe latter.\n\n\nInterestingly, Augustine does not think that the case of God is\nunique, but also suggests that there are non-theological cases in which\nthings are related solely in virtue of the properties or accidents of\nother things. Thus, a coin, he says can increase or decrease in value\nsolely in virtue of the intentional states of human\n beings.[32]\n Boethius, in a treatise also known as De Trinitate,\ndiscusses the same sorts of issues, and in the course of doing so adds\nyet another non-theological example\u2014a variation of which comes\nto be the standard medieval example of non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations.  Consider a man who walks up beside another man (or beside\nstationary column, as the standard medieval variation has it). In this\nsort of case, says Boethius, the latter comes to be to the right of\nthe man, but solely in virtue of a property of the\n man.[33]\n\n\nThus, even before medieval philosophers had direct access to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics they were led to acknowledge the\nexistence of the same type of relational situations mentioned\nthere. Of course, once the relevant texts of Aristotle became\navailable, the medievals worked hard to connect their discussions with\nthese texts.  Indeed, when the issue of God\u2019s relation to his\ncreatures is taken up in the thirteenth century\u2014an issue that\nbecomes one of the foci of medieval discussions of relations\ngenerally\u2014medieval philosophers often made direct appeals to\nAristotle\u2019s discussion in Metaphysics\n V.[34]\n5.1 Relations of Reason\n\n\nSo far, then, we have seen that medieval philosophers are committed to\nrecognizing at least one type of non-paradigmatic relational\nsituation\u2014namely, those involving a pair of substances and a\nsingle accident inhering in just one them. As we might expect,\nmedieval philosophers disagree about the precise nature of the\naccidents involved in these situations\u2014with reductive realists\nidentifying them with ordinary, non-relational accidents, and\nnon-reductive realists identifying them with accidents of a sui\ngeneris type.\n\n\nFor our purposes, however, what is most interesting about this type of\nrelational situation has to do with complication it presents for\nreductivists and non-reductivists alike. In paradigmatic relational\nsituations, there is always a distinct property or accident\ncorresponding to each member of the relevant pair of converse\nrelational concepts. Thus, when Simmias is taller than Socrates, there\nis one accident corresponding to the concept \u2018taller than\u2019\n(namely, an accident of Simmias) and another accident corresponding to\nthe concept \u2018shorter than\u2019 (namely, an accident of\nSocrates).  But now consider a situation such as Simmias\u2019s thinking\nabout Socrates (or God\u2019s being related to a creature)\u2014that is, a\nsituation where two substances are related by a property or accident\ninhering in only one of the relata. What is to be said about\nthe relationship between the relevant properties and concepts in\nsituations of this sort?\n\n\nInitially, we might expect medievals to respond to this by saying\nthat, in such situations, the single accident responsible for relating\nboth subjects corresponds to both members of the relevant pair of\nrelational concepts. Thus, if Simmias is thinking about Socrates, a\nquality of Simmias corresponds to both the concepts \u2018thinking\nof\u2019 and \u2018thought about\u2019. The problem with this\nsuggestion, however, is that it leads to the same sort of difficulties\nwe encountered earlier for identifying relations with pairs of\naccidents taken jointly. Socrates\u2019s being thought about appears to be\nsomething inhering in Socrates and Socrates alone. But if we identify\nthis relation with an accident of Simmias, then we shall have to say\nthat Socrates\u2019s being thought about does not exist in Socrates after\nall, but rather exists only in Simmias. Although medievals do allow\nfor cases of extrinsic denomination\u2014that is, cases\nwhere a property or accident of one thing is predicated of something\nelse\u2014they typically do not allow for this in the case of\nrelations. That is to say, they typically regard relations as\nintrinsic to the subjects of which their corresponding terms or\nconcepts are\n predicated.[35]\n Evidently, therefore, the relevant accident of Simmias can correspond\nto the concept \u2018thinking of\u2019, but not to the concept\n\u2018thought about\u2019. But, then, we still need to know what\ncorresponds to this latter concept.\n\n\nNow perhaps it will be suggested that, in the absence of any property\nor accident of Socrates to correspond to the concept \u2018thought\nabout\u2019, Socrates himself can serve as the correspondent. In that\ncase, however, we should have to admit that an individual substance is\na relation (since, as we have seen, whatever corresponds to a\nrelational concept and plays the relevant metaphysical role qualifies\nas a relation). But such an admission goes against deep-seated\nintuitions deriving from the Categories.  As we have seen,\nAristotle not only assumes that relations are accidents in the\nCategories, but intentionally characterizes them in such a\nway as to exclude substances from this category. But then we still\nlack a solution to our problem. If there is no property or accident of\nSocrates to correspond to the concept \u2018thought about\u2019, and\nneither Socrates nor a property of anything else can correspond to it,\nwhat if anything can?\n\n\nIt is at this point that the medieval notion of a relation of reason\n(relatio rationis) becomes relevant. Medieval philosophers\noften say that, even if there are relational situations involving only\na single accident, nonetheless these situations must be conceived\nas if they involved a pair, one belonging to each of the\nrelated things (cf., e.g., Aquinas, De potentia q. 1, a. 1,\nad 10). Like Boethius, the medievals accept the view that relations\ncannot be understood to exist by themselves or apart from their\ncorrelatives. At least conceptually, they say, relations always come\nin pairs. Thus, even if there is no real or extramental property in\nSocrates that accounts for his being thought about by Simmias, we must\nstill conceive of this situation as if there were one and, as\nit were, project this property onto Socrates. Since such\nprojections depend for their existence on the activity of the mind,\nmedieval philosophers refer to them as beings of reason (entia\nrationis). And their suggestion is that we take these beings of\nreason to be the items corresponding to or signified by concepts such\nas \u2018thought about\u2019.\n\n\nThe notion of a being of reason, or more specifically the notion of a\nrelation of reason, does not appear to have been invoked in the Latin\nWest before the thirteenth century, when Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics and certain Muslim philosophical commentaries and\ntreatises derived from it began to circulate widely. The notion of a\nrelation of reason is not to be found explicitly in the works of\nAristotle, though he does distinguish beings of reason in general from\nreal beings (cf.  Metaphysics IV, 1, esp. 1003a32\u2013b11 and V,\n7, esp.  1017a31\u201335). Even so, this notion is explicitly invoked by\ncertain Muslim philosophers, most notably Avicenna (d. 1037), and it\nmay well be that it makes its way into the Latin west through\nthem.\n\n\nHowever that may be, once the notion of a relation of reason is\nintroduced in the Latin West, it becomes pervasive\u2014so pervasive,\nin fact, that even philosophers, such as Ockham, who complain that\nsuch a notion is \u201cnot to be found in the writings of\nAristotle\u201d and that \u201c\u2018relation of reason\u2019 is\nnot a philosophical term,\u201d nevertheless feel compelled to give\nsome account of it in order to preserve common\n usage.[36]\n The pervasiveness of this notion is explained at least partly by the\nfact that medieval philosophers think it can be used to clarify and\nexplain a number of troublesome non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations. For example, by the end of thirteenth century, most\nphilosophers use it to explain the doctrine of creation, saying that\ncreatures are related to God by a real relation, whereas God is\nrelated to them by a mere relation of reason (cf.  Henninger\n1989). Again, many use the notion to clarify certain cases of\nrelational change. Thus, when a substance acquires a new relation\nwithout undergoing any real change this is often explained by saying\nthat the substance acquired a mere relation of\n reason.[37]\n Finally, some medieval philosophers use relations of reason to\nidentify a sense in which God can have accidents after all. Since\nrelations of reason are mere projections (or properties a thing has by\nvirtue of the activity of some mind), we can conceive of\nthem as accidents in a broad sense\u2014that is, as properties or\nfeatures that a thing can both acquire and lose. But since the\nacquisition or loss of these properties does not require a subject to\nundergo any real change, some medievals claim that there is no reason\nin principle why even God should not have accidents of this\n sort.[38]\n5.2 A Shifting Conception of Relations\n\n\nThe distinction between real relations and relations of reason has a\nnumber of important consequences for the development of medieval\ntheories of relations. For one thing, it enables philosophers to\nintroduce a number of refinements and distinctions within the\ncategory of relations. By the mid-thirteenth century, for example, it\nbecomes common to say that the category of relations is unique in\nallowing mere beings of reason among the things signified by its terms.\nTo quote from Aquinas who is representative in this regard:\n\n\nThe other genera introduce something in extramental reality just by\nvirtue of what they are. Thus, quantity introduces something just by\nvirtue of the fact that it is quantity. By contrast, relation alone\nis such that it does not introduce anything in extramental reality,\njust by virtue of what it is\u2014for it does not predicate a\nsomething but a toward something. Hence we find\ncertain relations that do not introduce anything in extramental\nreality, but only in reason. (De veritate, q. 1, a. 5, ad 15.)\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Aquinas and others appeal to this special feature of the\ncategory of relations (namely, that the things signified by its\nterms can either be real beings or mere beings of reason) to provide a\nsystematic division of relations or pairs of correlatives into three\ndifferent types, depending on whether their members are\nboth real, both conceptual, or mixed (one real, one conceptual). To\nquote again from Aquinas:\n\n\nIt must be known that, since a relation requires two\nrelata, there are three ways in which it can be something real\nor conceptual:\n\n\n\n[1] Sometimes it is a mere being of reason on the part of both\nrelata, namely, when the order or [relative] disposition\ncannot exist between things except in virtue of the apprehension of\nreason alone. For example, when we say that something is identical to\nitself. For in virtue of the fact that reason apprehends the one thing\ntwice, it regards it as two; and in this way it apprehends a certain\n[relative] disposition of a thing to itself. And the same thing is true\nof all relations between being and non-being, which reason forms\ninsofar as it apprehends a non-being as a certain relatum.\nAgain, the same is true of all relations that follow upon the activity\nof reason, such as genus and species, and the like.\n\n\n[2] Now there are other relations that are real as regards both\nrelata, namely, whenever there is a [relative] disposition\nbetween two things in virtue of something really belonging to each of\nthem\u2014as is clear from all relations that follow on quantity, such\nas large and small, double and half, and things of this sort. For there\nis a quantity in both relata. And the same is true of\nrelations that follow on action and passion, such as mover and movable,\nfather and son, and the like.\n\n\n[3] Sometimes, however, a relation is something real in one of the\nrelata and a mere being of reason in the other. And this\nhappens whenever the two relata do not belong to a single\norder. For example, sense perception and knowledge are related to\nthings that are sensible and intelligible. But insofar as the latter\nare things existing in extramental reality, they are outside the order\nof sensible and intelligible being. And so there is a real relation in\nthe knowledge and sense perception in virtue of the fact that they are\n[really] ordered to things that can be known or sensed. However,\nthings [that can be known or sensed] are outside this sort of order\n[when] considered in themselves, and hence there is not really a\nrelation in them to knowledge or sense perception. On the contrary,\nthere is only a relation in them according to reason, insofar as\nthe intellect apprehends them as terms of the relations of knowledge\nand sense perception. This is why the Philosopher says in\nMetaphysics V that they are spoken of relatively, not because\nthey are related to other things, but because other things are related\nto them. Similarly, being to the right is not said of a column unless\nit is placed to the right of some animal. Hence a relation of this\nsort is not really in the column but in the animal. (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 13, a. 7, corpus.)\n\n\n\nIn this passage, Aquinas contrasts the relations involved in\nparadigmatic relational situations\u2014namely, relations of the\nsecond type\u2014with the relations involved in two sorts\nof non-paradigmatic relational situation. We are already familiar with\nrelations of the third or \u2018mixed\u2019 type from our discussion\nof creation and intentional relations. Moreover, we can see that\nAquinas follows the common medieval practice of connecting relations\nof this type with both Aristotle\u2019s discussion in the\nMetaphysics and the Boethius-inspired example of the column.\nWe have yet, however, to encounter relations of the first type. These\nare relations comprised by pairs of properties or accidents both of\nwhose members are beings of reason. As an example of this type of\nrelation, Aquinas gives self-identity. When we conceive of a situation\ninvolving this sort of relation, he says, we conceive of it as if\nit involved two things (\u201ca relation requires two\nrelata\u201d and hence \u201creason apprehends the one\nthing twice\u201d), and also as if the two things were ordered to each\nother by a pair of properties (or \u201c[relative]\ndispositions\u201d).  Obviously, however, there are not distinct\nthings in extramental reality serving as the relata of the\nrelation of self-identity, much less two properties by which such\nrelata are related. Like many other medievals, therefore,\nAquinas concludes that in this case the relations (or relative\ndispositions) are not real, but mere beings of\n reason.[39]\n\n\nThe claim that self-identity is a relation of reason might seem\nworrisome. For insofar as relations of reason depend for their\nexistence on the activity of the mind, it would seem to follow that\nsomething\u2019s being self-identical is mind dependent. But that is\nabsurd.\n\n\nAquinas is aware of this sort of worry. In fact, in one of his\ndisputed questions, he imagines a similar worry leading someone to\ndoubt the view that even God\u2019s relation to his creatures can be\nconsidered a relation of reason:\n\n\nAfter all, if there were no created intellect in existence, God would\nstill be Lord and Creator. But if there were no created intellect in\nexistence, there would not be any beings of reason. Hence\n\u2018Creator\u2019, \u2018Lord\u2019, and terms of this sort, do\nnot express relations of reason. (De potentia, q. 7, a. 11,\nobj. 4.)\n\n\n\n\nThis sort of worry about relations of reason helps to explain what is\nperhaps their most significant effect on the medieval discussion of\nrelations\u2014namely, a gradual shift away from the traditional\nAristotelian characterization of relations. On this characterization,\nas we saw earlier, relations are identified at least partly in terms\nof their metaphysical function\u2014that is to say, they are\nidentified as items that actually serve to relate things. But in order\nto maintain that things can be self-identical apart from the activity\nof any mind, while at the same time maintaining that self-identity is\na relation of reason, medieval philosophers have little choice but to\nmove away from the traditional characterization. And of course the\nsame thing is true in the case of God\u2019s relation to his creatures.\nThus, as Aquinas says in reply to the abovementioned doubt:\n\n\nA man is really (and not merely conceptually) identical to himself,\neven though his relation [of self-identity] is a being of reason. And\nthe explanation for this is that the cause of his relation is\nreal\u2014namely, the unity of his substance, which our intellect\nconsiders under the aspect of a relation. In the same way, the power\nto compel subjects is really in God, and our intellect considers this\npower as ordered to the subjects because of the subjects\u2019 order to\nGod. It is for this reason that he is really said to be Lord, even\nthough his relation is a mere being of reason. And for the same reason\nit is evident that he would be Lord [Creator, etc.] even if there were\nno created intellect in existence. (De potentia q. 7, a. 11,\nad 3\u20135.)\n\n\n\n\nIn this passage, Aquinas makes it clear that in cases involving\nrelations of reason\u2014such as self-identity or God\u2019s\nrelation to the world\u2014the relata are related, not by\ntheir relations (since these are mere beings of reason and hence\ndependent on the activity of the mind), but by what he refers to here\nas the cause of their\n relations.[40]\n Now, in the case of a man\u2019s being self-identical, Aquinas says\nthe cause is just \u201cthe unity of his substance,\u201d where by\nthis he seems to mean that what makes a man identical to himself is\njust the man himself. Again, in the case of God\u2019s being Lord he\nsays that the cause is \u201cthe power to compel subjects\u201d. In\nthe case of God, however, Aquinas does not think the power to compel\nsubjects is distinct from its subject, namely, the divine\nnature. Hence, he maintains that what makes it true that God is Lord\nis nothing but God, his creatures, and some property or attribute of\nthe creatures.\n\n\nIn effect, therefore, reflection on relations of reason brings about a\nshift away from the conception of relations as items that relate, and\nthus forces medieval philosophers to fall back on what they might\notherwise have thought of as an equivalent characterization, namely,\nthe view that relations are items corresponding to or signified by our\ngenuinely relational concepts. Thus, even if self-identity or God\u2019s\nrelation to the world is a mere being of reason, and hence does not\nactually relate its subject to anything, nonetheless it can still be\nregarded as a relation on the grounds that it is signified by a\nrelational concept. Now obviously this shift away from the traditional\nAristotelian conception has the awkward consequence that things can be\nrelated even if their relations do not exist. Thus, Socrates can be\nidentical to himself even if there is no self-identity, God can be\nLord of creation even if his relation of Lordship does not exist, and\nmore generally, a predication of the form \u2018aRb\u2019\ncan be true, even when no predication of form \u2018R-ness\nexists\u2019 is true. Of course, there is nothing ultimately\nincoherent about this consequence, provided we keep in mind that the\nrelations in such cases are mere beings of reason. Nonetheless,\naccepting this consequence does force medieval philosophers to deny\nwhat at least initially appears to be a truth of reason, and at any\nrate is part of common sense\u2014namely, that things are related by\ntheir\n relations.[41]\n\n\nSome philosophers, such as Aquinas, assume that the departure from the\ntraditional Aristotelian characterization of relations is required\nonly in non-paradigmatic relational situations. By the end of the\nMiddle Ages, however, this sort of departure is so common and familiar\nthat philosophers no longer feel the need to regard it as exceptional.\nThus, Ockham eventually adopts a view according to which all relations\ndepend for their existence on the activity of the mind. Indeed, things\nare so changed by the time of Ockham that he feels free not only to\nreject the traditional Aristotelian characterization of relations, but\nalso to modify the standard medieval alternative to it. On his\npreferred characterization, relations are the items corresponding, not\nto all of our relational concepts, but to just one of\nthem\u2014namely, the concept \u2018relation\u2019. As Ockham sees\nit, moreover, the concept \u2018relation\u2019 is a term of second\nintention\u2014that is to say, a term to which only concepts\ncorrespond. Thus, even though Ockham insists that many predications of\nthe form \u2018aRb\u2019 are true independently of the\nmind, he nonetheless maintains that properly speaking relations exist\nonly in the mind as\n concepts.[42]\n This helps to explain why he often expresses his view using such\notherwise unintelligible formulas as: \u201cThis white thing really\nis similar, even though similarity is not really in this white\nthing\u201d (Quodl. VI, q. 22 in Opera Theologica\nix, 669).\n5.3 Relations as Substances\n\n\nAlthough relations of reason force a shift away from the Aristotelian\ncharacterization of relations, it is important to recall that they\nwere originally invoked to preserve the deep-seated Aristotelian\nconviction that no substance is a relation. As we have seen, it was to\navoid saying that Socrates is signified by the concept \u2018thought\nabout\u2019, when he is being thought about by Simmias, that medieval\nphilosophers invoked the notion of a relation of reason: it is not\nSocrates, but a relation of reason, they say, that corresponds to the\nconcept in question, and in this way avoid the consequence that a\nsubstance such as Socrates is a relation. And of course it was the\nsame sort of invocation that enabled them to avoid saying that\nSocrates corresponds to the concept of \u2018self-identical\u2019 or\nthat God corresponds to the concepts \u2018Lord\u2019 or\n\u2018Creator\u2019. Given the lengths to which medieval\nphilosophers are willing to go, in situations such as these, to\npreserve the Aristotelian thesis that no substance is a relation, it\nis all the more surprising that there is at least one\ncase\u2014namely, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity\u2014in\nwhich they are forced to admit that even it cannot be upheld.\n\n\nAccording to Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God exists in three\npersons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As this doctrine was typically\nunderstood during the Middle Ages, it implies not only that God\npossesses certain relations\u2014such as fatherhood and\nsonship\u2014but also that he possess them independently of the\nactivity of any mind. As Aquinas says in his Summa\nTheologiae:\n\n\nSomeone is said to be a father only by virtue of his fatherhood, and\nsomeone is said to be a son only by virtue of his sonship. Therefore,\nif [the relations of] fatherhood and sonship are not really in God, it\nfollows that God is not a Father or Son really, but merely according to\na concept of the mind\u2014which is the Sabellian\n heresy.[43]\n\n\n\nNow when the claim that there are real relations in God is combined\nwith another doctrine that was ubiquitous in the Middle Ages, namely\nthe doctrine of divine simplicity, the conclusion that God (and hence\nat least one substance) is a relation seems to follow necessarily. For\nas the doctrine of divine simplicity is typically understood, there is\nno real distinction to be drawn between God and any of his intrinsic\nor essential attributes. Thus, if God is good, he is identical to his\ngoodness; if he is wise, he is identical to his wisdom. By parity of\nreasoning, therefore, if God is a father or son, he must be identical\nto his fatherhood and sonship. Again, Aquinas is perfectly\nrepresentative in this regard:\n\n\nWhatever is in God is his nature \u2026 It is thus clear\nthat a relation really existing in God is identical to his nature\naccording to reality, and does not differ from it except according to\na concept of the mind. (Summa Theologiae I, q. 28, a. 2,\ncorpus.)\n\n\n\n\nWith the doctrine of the Trinity, therefore, we arrive at what is perhaps\nthe medievals\u2019 greatest departure from Aristotle.\n\n\nSome medievals, however, see the Trinity not as providing a\ncounterexample to Aristotle\u2019s thesis that no substance is a relation,\nbut rather as calling our attention to a restriction on its range of\napplicability.  Aquinas, for example, appears to think that the thesis\nwas specifically formulated to apply only to the case of creatures\n(cf.  Summa Theologiae I, q. 28, a. 2, corpus), and to some\nextent this is plausible, since obviously Aristotle was not thinking\nabout theological examples such as the Trinity when he formulated\nit. Interestingly, however, other philosophers think that the thesis\ndoes not hold even in the case of all creatures. Thus, Gilbert of\nPoitiers (d. 1154), in a discussion of Boethius\u2019s De\nhebdomadibus, suggests that creaturely goodness is a relation,\nindeed, just the relation of being created by God. On this\ninterpretation, moreover, Gilbert takes this relation to be nothing\nover and above creatures themselves, so that in their case it is\nindividual substances that correspond to the concept \u2018created\nby\u2019 and hence qualify as relations. Like Aquinas, however,\nGilbert appears to think of these sorts of cases, not as providing\ncounterexamples to Aristotle\u2019s thesis, but rather as telling us\nsomething about the scope of its applicability. According to Gilbert,\nthere is a distinction to be drawn between natural\nphilosophy, which deals with natural things, and other areas of\nintellectual inquiry, including theology and ethics,\nwhich deal with a broader scope of\n things.[44]\n And Gilbert\u2019s suggestion is that if we restrict our attention\nto natural philosophy, as no doubt Aristotle did, then like him we\nwill be led to the conclusion that no substance is a\n relation.[45]\n\n\nAlthough Gilbert and Aquinas work hard to preserve something like the\nAristotelian thesis that no substance is a relation, at least in\nnon-theological contexts, not all medieval philosophers feel the need\nto do so. In fact, as Middle Ages progress, there appears to be a\ngradual shift, even in non-theological contexts, towards allowing\nsubstances to be relations, or at least towards allowing them to be\nthe primary significata of our relational concepts. Here\nagain Ockham appears to be an important transitional figure. Thus, he\nbreaks with tradition in allowing that even self-identity is a real\nrelation, or at least \u201creal \u2026 in the same way that\nsimilarity and equality are\u201d (Quodl. V, q. 27 in\nOpera Theologica ix, 685). Indeed, on Ockham\u2019s view, which\nbecomes influential in the generations following him, it turns out\nthat substances are signified by most of our relational\nconcepts. Apart from some species of quality, Ockham thinks there is\nno real distinction to be drawn between substances and any of there\naccidents. According to him, therefore, relational situations do not\ntypically involve anything more than individual\n substances.[46]\n6. A Shifting of Paradigms\n\n\nWe are now in a position to appreciate the main types of views that\nmedievals developed concerning the nature and ontological status of\nrelations, as well as the main historical and dialectical\nconsiderations that helped to shape them. As we have seen, with the\nexception of thinkers such as Peter Auriol, medievals appear to have\nbeen drawn (almost to a person) to a form of realism about relations,\none according to which at least some predications of the form\n\u2018aRb\u2019 are true independently of the mind. There\nis some disagreement as to the precise analysis of the situations that\nmakes these sorts of predications true, but even here the medievals typically \ndevelop their views from within a common framework provided by\nAristotle\u2019s Categories: relational situations do not include\nanything corresponding to the notion of a polyadic property, but\ninstead include only substances and their monadic properties or\naccidents. The main medieval disagreements, therefore, are best\ncharacterized as disagreements about the extent to which the proper\nanalysis ought to conform to the paradigm suggested by the\nCategories. Prior to the fourteenth century, as we have seen,\nmedievals tended to follow Aristotle in claiming that things are\nrelated by their accidents, and hence that relational situations\ntypically involve not only pairs of substances, but pairs of monadic\nproperties or accidents as well. As a result, one of the most pressing\nquestions during this period concerns the precise nature of the\naccidents involved in relational situations. Reductive realists, as we\nhave seen, identify them with ordinary, non-relational accidents such\nas quantities or qualities, whereas non-reductive realists identify\nthem with monadic properties of a sui generis type.\n\n\nWith the advent of the fourteenth century, however, important changes\nbegin to take place in the medieval discussion of relations.\nPhilosophers and theologians continue, of course, to allow for\nsituations in which substances are related by their accidents, and\nhence to worry about the precise nature of the accidents involved in\nthese situations. But at this point there is a decided shift toward\nregarding such situations as exceptional. As we have seen, there was\nalways strong theological pressure to allow for at least some\ndepartures from the Aristotelian paradigm. But what appears to have\nhappened over time is that these departures come to seem less and less\npeculiar, and eventually to provide the basis for a new analysis of\nrelational situations\u2014one according to which substances\nthemselves are the items responsible for relating. Around this same\ntime, moreover, Ockham and his followers, most notably John Buridan,\ninstitute another sort of change, namely, a shift away from the traditional\nAristotelian characterization of relations. Prior to the\nfourteenth century, philosophers and theologians typically assume that\nthe term \u2018relation\u2019 signifies whatever it is in a\nrelational situation that does the relating\u2014though here again\ntheological considerations force them to allow for certain exceptions.\nBy the time of Ockham, however, we get a complete break with this\nstandard characterization. Thus, whereas earlier philosophers and\ntheologians would allow the term \u2018relation\u2019 to signify a\nbeing of reason only in certain cases, such as creation, Ockham and\nhis followers maintain that \u2018relation\u2019 is a term of second\nintention, and so strictly speaking always signifies beings of reason.\nWith Ockham, therefore, we have not only a complete severing of the\nconnection between relations and those items in relational situations\nthat actually do the relating, but also the advent of a new\u2014and,\nwe might add, fairly harmless\u2014form of\n anti-realism.[47]\n\n\nIn the end, therefore, it is fair to say that the fourteenth\ncentury marks a shifting of medieval paradigms both with respect to\nthe proper analysis of relational situations and with respect to the\nproper characterization of relations. It is important to add, however, that\nthese shifts cannot be fully explained in terms of developments within\nthe medieval discussion of relations, but are instead part-and-parcel\nof broader theoretical shifts in medieval accounts of the relationship\nbetween mind, language, and reality\u2014shifts which are closely\nassociated with the rise of late-medieval nominalism\n generally.[48]",
