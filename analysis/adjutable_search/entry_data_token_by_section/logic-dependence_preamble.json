    "main_text": "\n\nDependence logic is an extension of first-order logic which adds to it\ndependence atoms, that is, expressions of the form\n\\(\\eqord(x_1 \\ldots x_n, y)\\) which assert that the value of \\(y\\) is\nfunctionally dependent on (in other words, determined by) the values\nof \\(x_1 \\ldots x_n\\). These atoms permit the specification of\nnon-linearly ordered dependency patterns between variables,\nmuch in the same sense of IF-Logic slashed quantifiers; but,\ndifferently from IF-logic, dependence logic separates quantification\nfrom the specification of such dependence/independence conditions.\n\nThe principal semantics of dependence logic, called team\nsemantics, generalizes Tarski\u2019s semantics by letting\nexpressions be satisfied or not satisfied with respect to\nsets of variable assignments rather than with respect to\nsingle assignments. This semantics pre-dates the development of\ndependence logic proper, and it was originally developed by Wilfrid\nHodges in the context of IF-logic (Hodges 1997). There also exists a\ngame-theoretic semantics for dependence logic, based on games of\nimperfect information and roughly analogous to the game-theoretic\nsemantics for independence-friendly logic (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen\n2007a). Sensu stricto, the term \u201cdependence\nlogic\u201d refers exclusively to the language obtained by adding the\nabove-mentioned functional dependence atoms to the language of\nfirst-order logic; but the term is also used, in a more general sense,\nto refer to the the area of research that studies the properties of\nlogics obtained by adding various notions of dependence and\nindependence to first order logic, such as independence\nlogic (Gr\u00e4del & V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2013),\nintuitionistic dependence logic (Yang 2013) or inclusion\nlogic (Galliani 2012, Galliani & Hella 2013), or even those\nof logics extending other logical frameworks through similar\natoms, as in the case of modal dependence logic\n(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2008).\n In this article, the term \u201cdependence logic\u201d will be\nused to refer to dependence logic proper, and the term \u201clogics\nof dependence and independence\u201d will instead be used to refer to\nits variants and generalizations.\n",
