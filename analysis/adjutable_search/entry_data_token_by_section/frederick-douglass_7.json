    "main_text": "Amalgamation and Assimilation\n8. Amalgamation and Assimilation\n\nDouglass\u2019s affirmation of universal human brotherhood, his\nbelief in providential human development, and his observation of the\nmixing of racialized groups in the United States led him to directly\nsupport racial amalgamation: race-mixing was a sign of progress for\nFrederick Douglass. It is important to note here that he thought there\nwere races to amalgamate, so he affirmed the basic idea that\nbiologically distinct races existed (1854 [SFD: 116\u2013150]). As\nhis view of universal human brotherhood should be clear, he did not\nthink much followed from that admission. The existence of biological\nraces did not, in his view, negate the theological-philosophical\ninsight of universal human brotherhood.\n\nDouglass understood that the sexual boundaries between the races were\nthin and that, indeed, the conditions of slavery led to a great deal\nof mixing. Recall that he maintained that his unacknowledged father\nwas his white master, and, in no uncertain terms, he condemned the\nrape, sexual violence, and exploitation of black women. Yet, given his\ncommitment to his ideals, Douglass promoted amalgamation between free\npeoples. He believed that blacks and white ought to be free to\nintermarry and that they should do so. Why should they marry?\nDouglass, sensing the transformation of the black and Native American\npopulation in the United States, believed this process was a natural\nand continual process; that a new third race, an American race, would\nemerge in this land. During his time, such views were highly\ninflammatory and served, and continued to serve, as a reason against\nthe emancipation of enslaved black people and later as a justification\nfor segregation (Sundstrom 2008: 11\u201335). Nonetheless, in the\n1860s, he boldly advocated for amalgamation between the races. He\nremarked to a journalist, the day after his second marriage to Helen\nPitts, who was white,\n\n\n\u2026there is no division of races. God Almighty made but one race.\nI adopt the theory that in time the varieties of races will be blended\ninto one. Let us look back when the black and the white people were\ndistinct in this country. In two hundred and fifty years there has\ngrown up a million of intermediate. And this will continue. You may\nsay that Frederick Douglass considers himself a member of the one race\nwhich exists. (1884 [FDP1 v.5: 147])\n\n\nDouglass\u2019s amalgamation is easy to confuse with his support for\nassimilation. Amalgamation is conceptually distinct from assimilation;\none does not have to accept amalgamation to support assimilation.\nAssimilation concerns various degrees of acculturation. It can\ntheoretically go in either direction, from black to white or white to\nblack, and it can involve the subtle blending of both and many groups\n(Sundstrom 2008). His support for amalgamation and assimilation could\nnot be any clearer than what he proclaimed in \u201cOn Composite\nNationality\u201d, in which he called for the molding of all\nin the land into a common Americanness (1869a [SFD: 278\u2013303];\n \u00a712).\n In his enthusiasm for this molding, he is distinct, but he was not\nexceptional in his support of assimilation; several of his\ncontemporaries and leaders who followed him supported some degree of\nassimilation. Even some of Douglass\u2019s early critics, such as\nEdward Blyden (1832\u20131912), Martin Delany (1812\u20131885), and\nAlexander Crummell (1819\u20131898), who did not support\namalgamation, still believed in the assimilation of black Americans to\nthe standards and values Western civilization (Moses 1978).\n",
