    "main_text": "The Choice between Incompatibility Formulations and Evidential Formulations\n2. The Choice between Incompatibility Formulations and Evidential Formulations\n\nHow is the argument from evil best formulated?  As an\nincompatibility argument, or as an evidential argument?  In section\n1.1, an incompatibility formulation of a very abstract sort was set\nout, which appealed to the mere fact that the world contains at least\nsome evil.  That formulation involved the following crucial\npremise:\n\nIf God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate\nall evil.\n\n \nThe problem with that premise, as we saw, is that it can be argued\nthat some evils are such that their actuality, or at least their\npossibility, is logically necessary for goods that outweigh them, in\nwhich case it is not true that a perfectly good being would want to\neliminate such evils.\n \nIn section 1.4, a much more concrete version of an incompatibility\nargument was set out, which, rather than appealing to the mere\nexistence of some evil or other, appealed to specific types of \nevil\u2014in particular, situations where animals die agonizing deaths in\nforest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering and\neventual death due to cancer.  The thrust of the argument was then\nthat, first of all, an omniscient and omnipotent person could have\nprevented the existence of such evils without thereby either allowing\nequal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater goods, and,\nsecondly, that any omniscient and morally perfect person will prevent\nthe existence of such evils if that can be done without either\nallowing equal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater\ngoods.\n \nThe second of these claims avoids the objections that can be\ndirected against the stronger claim that was involved in the argument\nset out in section 1.1\u2014that is, the claim that if God is morally\nperfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil.  But the\nshift to the more modest claim requires that one move from the very\nmodest claim that evil exists to the stronger claim that there are\ncertain evils that an omniscient and omnipotent person could have\nprevented the existence of such evils without thereby either allowing\nequal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater goods, and the\nquestion arises as to how that claim can be supported.  In\nparticular, can it be established by means of a purely deductive\nargument?\n \nConsider, in particular, the relevant premise in the more concrete\nversion of the argument from evil set out in section 1.4, namely:\n\nThere exist states of affairs in which animals die agonizing\ndeaths in forest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering\nand eventual death due to cancer, and that (a) are intrinsically bad\nor undesirable, and (b) are such that any omnipotent person has the\npower to prevent them without thereby either allowing an equal or\ngreater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good.\n\n \nHow would one go about establishing via a purely deductive argument\nthat a deer\u2019s suffering a slow and painful death because of a forest\nfire, or a child\u2019s undergo lingering suffering and eventual death due\nto cancer, is not logically necessary either to achieve a greater\ngood or to avoid a greater evil?  If one had knowledge of the\ntotality of morally relevant properties, then it might well be\npossible to show both that there are no greater evils that can be\navoided only at the cost of the evil in question, and that there are\nno greater goods that are possible only given that evil.  Do we have\nsuch knowledge?  Some moral theorists would claim that we do, and\nthat it is possible to set out a complete and correct moral theory.\nBut this is certainly a highly controversial metaethical claim, and,\nas a consequence, the prospects for establishing a premise such as\n(1) via a deductive argument do not appear promising, at least given the\npresent state of moral theory.\n\nBut if one cannot establish (1) via a deductive argument from one\u2019s\nmoral theory, cannot it be argued that that will lead to skepticism\nabout whether one can know what human actions are morally right and\nmorally wrong? This is a serious question, and it may well be that\nsuch knowledge is ruled out. But as will become clear when we\nconsider evidential versions of the argument from evil, it may well be\nthat one can have justified beliefs about the rightness and\nwrongness of actions.\n \nIf a premise such as (1) cannot, at least at present, be established\ndeductively, then the only possibility, it would seem, is to offer\nsome sort of inductive argument in support of the relevant premise.\nBut if this is right, then it is surely best to get that crucial\ninductive step out into the open, and thus to formulate the argument\nfrom evil not as a deductive argument for the very strong claim that\nit is logically impossible for both God and evil to exist, (or for\nGod and certain types, or instances, of evil to exist), but as an\nevidential (inductive/probabilistic) argument for the more modest\nclaim that there are evils that actually exist in the world that make\nit unlikely that God exists.\n",
