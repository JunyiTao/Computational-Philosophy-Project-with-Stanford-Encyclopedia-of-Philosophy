    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nAs is the case with many medieval thinkers, Autrecourt\u2019s\nbiographical details are few. What we know about his intellectual life\nhas to be reconstructed using dates that are attached to the handful of\ndocuments in which he is mentioned. One of these is a record from\nsometime between 1333\u201336, indicating that he served as prior at the\nColl\u00e8ge de Sorbonne. Another important document is a papal\nletter of 1338 in which Benedict XII confers upon him the function of\ncanon at Metz Cathedral, and refers to him as a master of arts and\nbachelor of theology and civil law. Evidently, however, Autrecourt did\nnot claim his prebendary stipend until after his trial in 1347.\n\n\nOn the basis of such references, Autrecourt\u2019s date of birth can be\nplaced sometime between 1295\u201398. He originated from Autr\u00e9court\nin the diocese of Verdun, and was probably a student in the arts\nfaculty at Paris, belonging to either the English, or, more likely, the\nFrench nation. His master\u2019s degree in arts can be dated around 1318\u201320.\nWhile a student, he must have come across such famous masters as John\nof Jandun, Marsilius of Padua, Thomas Wilton, Walter Burley,\nBartholomew of Bruges, or Siger of Courtrai. Since his law degree was\nin civil rather than canon law, he must have left Paris at some point\nfor a minimum of five years, probably to study at Orl\u00e9ans,\nAvignon, or Montpellier.\n\n\nHis membership in the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne places Autrecourt\nback in Paris in the 1330s as a student of theology. On November 21,\n1340, Pope Benedict XII summoned him from Paris to Avignon to respond\nto allegations of false teaching. In his letter, the pope refers to\nAutrecourt as a licentiatus in theology, meaning that\nAutrecourt had fullfilled the formal requirements for the theology\ndegree, e.g., lecturing on the Bible and the Sentences. But\ndoes it also mean that he was a full-fledged master of theology? The\nquestion is controversial. In the judgment at his trial, it was\nstipulated that Autrecourt could only obtain \u201cmagisterial honor and\ndegree\u201d after special permission from the Apostolic See, which seems\nto imply that he was not allowed to progress to inception in theology\n(the ceremony in which the magisterial honors would be conferred)\nuntil the pope decided otherwise. Moreover, there are no records\nreferring to Autrecourt as a master in theology. This suggests that\nAutrecourt remained a licentiatus in theology when he moved\non to Metz to take his position as canon (and later dean) of the\ncathedral chapter.  He died in 1369, on either July 16 or 17.  Another\nscenario is that Autrecourt\u2019s licenciate in theology was removed as a\nresult of his conviction and that it had been restored by the time\nthat he was confirmed as dean of the chapter at Metz (Courtenay, in\nCaroti and Grellard, 2006, pp. 42\u201343).\n",
