    "main_text": "Logic || The Basic Relations of System \\(\\Sigma\\)\n3.2 The Basic Relations of System \\(\\Sigma\\)\n\nGiven exclusive disjunction, equivalence, symmetry, and asymmetry,\nRoyce proposed that such relations could be expressed as a single\nordering relation, the obverse or \\(O\\)-relation.[7]\n Represented \u2018\\(O(A \\: B)\\)\u2019, the \\(O\\)-relation\nmarks two possible courses or modes of\naction, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and indicates\nthat these courses of action are incompatible: that is, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan be read as the assertion that action A and action B cannot both be\ntaken or that if \\(A\\) is taken \\(B\\)\ncannot be taken and vice versa. \\(O\\)-relations\nsimultaneously represent a state of affairs such that two possible\ncourses of action are available, one of which can be actualized and\nthe other excluded. \\(O\\)-relations are also such that,\nin the course of things, one of the disjuncts must be taken. If\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\), then it is also the case that \u201cneither\u201d is\nnot an option in just the way that \u201cneither\u201d is not an\noption for \\(O(A \\: \\neg A)\\). The \\(O\\)-relation can\ninclude as many terms as are, when taken together, incompatible and,\nregardless of the number of terms, they may still be reduced to the\ndyad \\(O(a \\:\\neg a)\\). Taken as a set of incompatible actions, \\(O(A\n\\: B)\\) is an \\(O\\)-collection (Royce 1905,\n390), as are \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C\\: \\ldots \\: n)\\). Now\nif \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible (and\nso then are \\(\\neg A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\)), it is also the case that\n\\(\\neg A\\) and \\(B\\) are compatible as are \\(\\neg B\\)\nand \\(A\\). These terms are then related by the\ncompatibility relation, equivalence, or the \\(E\\)-relation\n(Royce 1905, 390\u2013391) such\nthat \\(E(\\neg A\\: B)\\) and \\(E(A \\:\\neg B)\\).\n\nRoyce summarized the central ontological claims of his system this\nway: \u201cwhatever else the world contains, if it only contains a\nreasonable being who knows and intends his own acts, then this being\nis aware of a certain relation, the relation between performing and\nnot performing any act which he considers in advance of action. And\nthus relations amongst acts are in such wise necessary facts, that\nwhoever acts at all, or whoever, even in ideal, contemplates\npossible courses of action, must regard at least some of\nthese relations as present in the realm of his conceived modes of\naction\u201d (1913a, 120\u20131. When Royce introduced the\nformal system \\(\\Sigma\\) in his 1905 paper, \u201cThe Relation of the\nPrinciples of Logic to the Foundations of Geometry,\u201d he proposed\nsix \u201claws\u201d to which \\(O\\)-collections must\nconform. Restated, these six laws are as follows:\n\nIf \\(O(\\alpha )\\) then \\(O(\\alpha \\: \\beta )\\), whatever actions\n\\(b\\) includes.\nIf \\(\\beta \\) is a collection of elements that are all complements\nof some other collection \\(\\delta \\) and \\(O(\\beta)\\), then\n \\(O(\\delta)\\).[8]\nThere exists at least one element of \\(\\Sigma\\).\nIf an element \\(x\\) of \\(\\Sigma\\) exists, then \\(y\\) exists such\nthat \\(x \\ne y\\).\nIf \\(A \\ne B\\) (and so incompatible or \\(O(A\\: B)\\)), then there\nexists another element or action, \\(C\\), such that\n\\(E(A\\: C)\\) and \\(E(B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\).\nFor some set of actions, \\(\\lambda\\), and action \\(A\\)\nsuch that \\(O(\\lambda \\: A)\\), there exists another\naction \\(B\\) such that \\(O(\\lambda\\: B)\\) and that for\nany element of \\(\\lambda\\), such as \\(1_n\\), \\(O(A\\: B\\: 1_n )\\).\n\n\nThe six laws are offered by Royce as postulates, but they are intended\nto provide both relational and ontological parameters for ordering.\nThe first two laws establish the existence of exclusive disjunctions\nwhich are necessary for a world in which there are agents. Laws three\nand four establish that the universe is such that it includes a\nprinciple of generation or emergence\u2014there is at least one\nthing, and if there is one thing there are infinitely many\n more.[9]\n The fifth and sixth laws stipulate the constraints on emergent\nactions. The fifth law establishes paradoxical objects that, while\ncompatible with two different incompatible objects, are not compatible\nwith these objects when taken together. Likewise, the sixth law\nestablished that \\(O\\)-collections also generate new\nobjects or terms that extend the possibilities included in a given\nO-collection. The six laws provide the generative landscape in which\nagents emerge and operate. They also reinforce the idea that agency is\npredicated on both selecting possibilities and losing them permanently\nso that agency, whatever else it involves, entails both opportunity\nand\n sacrifice.[10]\n\nSystem \\(\\Sigma\\) then is the process of transforming symmetrically\nrelated possibilities to asymmetrical ordered action through the\nnegation of some possible action(s). In most general terms, this\nallows us to think of \\(O\\)-relations as modal and\nconditional. If the \\(O\\)-relation holds of actions \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\), then it is the case that if\n\\(A\\) is negated (not taken or sacrificed) then \\(B\\)\nfollows. Rather than being a material conditional\n\\((\\neg A \\supset B)\\), the antecedent and consequent are necessarily\nrelated. If \\(O(A\\: B)\\) then \\(\\Box (A \\supset \\neg B)\\) and \\(\\Box\n(\\neg A \\supset\n B)\\).[11]\n Consequently, the dyadic \\(O\\)-relation, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan also be represented as \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\) and so as \\(\\Box\n(A \\supset \\neg B) \\wedge \\Box (B \\supset \\neg A)\\). Given the\nequivalence relation, it follows that \\(B\\) is\nequivalent to \\(\\neg A\\) and so can be substituted for \\(B\\)\nso that \\(O(A\\: \\neg A)\\) and \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg\n\\neg A)\\). \\(O\\)-relations, however, are not limited to\ndyadic relations. Consider three possible courses of action such that\ntaking any one requires the elimination of the other two courses of\naction (for example, selecting one of three paths at a fork in the\nroad). This situation can be represented as \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\). Note\nthat if \\(A\\) is taken, then neither \\(B\\)\nor \\(C\\) can be taken so that\ntogether, \\((B \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\). Likewise, if \\(B\\)\nis taken, then \\((A \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg\nB\\) and so on. So \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) is also \n\n\\[ \\Box [(A \\equiv \\neg (B \\lor C)) \\wedge (B \\equiv \\neg (A \\lor C)) \\wedge (C \\equiv \\neg (A \\lor B))] \\]\n\n\nHowever, since the fifth law allows that every pair of incompatible\nactions generates a third term making the initial dyadic \\(O\\)-relation\na triadic \\(O\\)-relation,\nconditional relations require an additional relation that represents\nboth the compatibility of the resulting terms and the asymmetrical\norder created. Royce proposes the F-relation for this purpose. An \\(F\\)-relation\n(like the symmetrical \\(E\\)-relation)\nrepresents the terms of the original \\(O\\)-relation\nmodified so that they are\n compatible.[12]\n It also adds an additional symbol (the vertical stroke) to mark the\nplace of the antecedent term that makes the \\(F\\)-relation\n asymmetrical.[13]\n\nConsider \\(O(a\\: b)\\) By the fifth law, \\(O(a\\: b)\\) adds a third\nterm, \\(c\\), which is at once compatible with \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) (that is, \\(E(a\\: c)\\) and\n\\(E(b\\: c)\\)) and taken together with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nform \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\). This third element, following\nthe work of A.B. Kempe (1890), is \u201cbetween\u201d \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\). Royce (like Kempe) captures\nthis betweenness by requiring that the new third term be compatible\nwith both terms but not reducible to them. In effect, the fifth law\nsays that whenever two actions are incompatible, there exists an\naction \u201cbetween\u201d the two that can, with a correct\ntransformation, order the obverse actions. Using Royce\u2019s\nillustration, Figure 1 represents \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\) where \\(c\\)\nis compatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nand the region where all three fields overlap, there\nare no elements. Figure 2 represents \\( F(\\neg c | a\\: b )\\) where the\nregion \\(\\neg c\\) overlaps, and so is compatible with, regions \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \\(O (a\\: b\\: c)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. \\(F (\\neg c | a\\: b)\\)\n\n\nAs Royce explains, \u201cThe \\(F\\)-relation, so long\nas \u2018obverses\u2019 or \u2018negatives\u2019 exist, follows\nimmediately from, and is equivalent to, an \\(O\\)-relation.\nFor, in the diagram [above] if \\(s\\)\nis the total surface in which \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are included, then when\n\u2018\\(c\\) is between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\u2019\n\u2018\\(a\\), \\(b\\),\nand \\(\\neg c\\) (\\(\\neg c\\) being the obverse of \\(c\\))\nconstitute an \\(O\\)-collection,\u2019\nor \u2018are in the \\(O\\)-relation\u2019\u2009\u201d\n(Royce 1905, 387).\n\nThe \\(O\\)-relation is transformed into an \\(F\\)-relation\nby negating one of the three terms,\nselecting one term as the antecedent and another term as the\n\u201corigin.\u201d This is written as \\(F (\\neg A | B\\:\nC)\\), where the term to the left of the vertical stroke is the\nantecedent, and the two remaining terms are the consequent and the\naction \u201cin terms of which\u201d the antecedent and consequent\nare so ordered. The expression can be read: If \\(A\\) is\nnot taken then \\(B\\) follows with respect to \\(C\\).\n\u201cIt is this origin, [\\(C\\)],\u201d\nRoyce observes, \u201cwhich gives\n\u2018sense\u2019 to the pair [\\(A\\: B\\)] in the expression [\\(A\n\\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\)]\u201d (1905,\n407).\n\nWhile \\(O\\)-relations are indeterminate as to outcome,\nsince the terms are symmetrically related, F-relations mark the\nselection of possible courses of action and so establish the linear,\nasymmetrical relations of agential action. Royce concludes:\n\u201cWherever a linear series is in question, wherever an origin of\ncoordinates is employed, wherever \u2018cause and effect,\u2019\n\u2018ground and consequence,\u2019 orientation in space or\ndirection of tendency in time are in question, the dyadic asymmetrical\nrelations involved are essentially the same as the relation here\nsymbolized by [\\(p \\supset q\\) with respect to \\(y\\)]\u201d\n(1905, 407).\n\nThe conditionals that result from the initial \\(O\\)-collection\ninclude \\(\\neg A \\supset B\\) with respect\nto \\(C\\), \\(\\neg B \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(C\\),\n\\(\\neg C \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(B\\),\nand so on. Since \\(O\\)-relations are\nsymmetrical, there are as many alternative \u201ccourses\u201d of\naction as there are possibilities of negation and selection of\nantecedents and origins. Since the conditionals are possibilities,\nthey could also be represented \u201c\\(\\Diamond (\\neg C \\supset B)\\),\n\\(A\\)\u201d where \\(A\\) represents a\nshared propositional\n parameter.[14]\n \u201cIt is now possible,\u201d Royce concludes, \u201cto point\nout that the elements of \\(\\Sigma\\) possess the properties of a system\nof logical classes, or of entities to which the ordinary algebra of\nlogic applies\u201d (1905, 427). The resulting conditionals operate\nin a system that is like a relevant possible world logic were the\ntruth of the conditional is dependent on its truth assignment through\nthe propositional parameter that orders antecedent and consequent.\nHowever, Royce cautions against reliance on logics that are primarily\ninterested in conditional relations. Such interest is a result of our\n\u201cintellectual habits\u201d but \u201cin several respects\ninferior to the more direct expression in terms of \\(O\\)-relations.\n\u2026 When, in fact, we attempt to\ndescribe the relations of the system \\(\\Sigma\\) merely in terms of the\nantecedent-consequent relation, we not only limit ourselves to an\narbitrary choice of origin, but miss the power to survey at a glance\nrelations of more than a dyadic, or triadic character\u201d\n(381\u20132).\n",
