    "main_text": "Counteracting Hate Speech || Objections to Bans, and Some Responses\n5.3 The Supported Counterspeech Alternative\n\nThe preceding summarizes the two main positions in the debate over\nhate speech: on the one hand, there are those who defend prohibitions,\nand on the other, those who maintain hate speech as protected under a\nwide conception of freedom of expression, and so oppose laws that aim\nat its prohibition. A third position aims to avoid some of the\nimpasses that haunt this debate. On this view, this impasse is the\nresult of a failure by those who oppose hate speech bans (and, as a\nresult, tend to favor \u2018more speech\u2019) to acknowledge the\nstrength of one of the main arguments from those who advocate for\nbans, namely, that hate speech is a type of assault that often renders\none unable to respond. This, along with a failure of those who defend\nbans from considering non-punitive options for mitigating the harms of\nhate speech, leads to stalemate. On this understanding, both sides of\nthe debate over bans see the only alternatives as either increased\ngovernmental powers to punish, or absent that,\n\u2018unsupported\u2019 counterspeech on the part of those targeted\nby hate speech (see Gelber, 2012a; 2012b).\n\nBy contrast, the \u201csupported counterspeech\u201d alternative\naims to recognize the specific harms inflicted by hate speech and\nprovide state support to empower those who are harmed. Gelber, an\nadvocate for this alternative, places it within the capabilities\napproach originally developed by Amartya Sen (1992) and Martha\nNussbaum (2000; 2003). \u201cIf hate-speech acts harm their\ntargets\u2019 capacity to develop human capabilities,\u201d Gelber\nsays, then \u201cthis is what needs to be remedied\u201d (2012a,\n54). The impetus for this approach therefore begins from the idea that\nwe must think about remedies to hate speech beyond restrictions and\npunishment, as neither of these approaches achieve the goal of\nempowering the target of hate speech. (This is especially true of the\nlatter, punishment, which also carries with it all the negative\nconsequences that anti-carceral advocates have noted.) The supported\ncounterspeech policy is therefore not focused on hate speakers, but\nrather the targets of hate speech more directly.\n\nThe core of this approach lies in an enlarged conception of\ncounterspeech as well as a commitment by the state to provide the\nmaterial conditions necessary for this speech. In practice, this would\nmean that the state is committed to responding to an incident of hate\nspeech by empowering its targets to engage in more speech, after the\nfact. The specific forms this support may take will depend on the\nconditions of different contexts, along with calibration for the\nspecifics of the incident it is meant as a response to, as well as the\nneeds of the particular communities. Still, to give a sense of what\nthis may entail, examples of the sort of supported counterspeech that\nthis position recommends include things such as: assistance in the\nproduction of a community newsletters, op-eds, radio broadcasts, or\ntelevision advertisements; the development of antiracism awareness\nprograms, or anti-hate-speech workshops; subsidizing community-led art\nprojects; etc.\n\nIn each case, the aim of supported counterspeech is to empower the\ntargets of hate speech, and to increase their capacity for engaging in\ncounterspeech. The goal is thus to undo (as much as one can) the\nspecific harms of hate speech, while avoiding the pitfalls of\n\u201cprivate remedies\u201d (as critiqued by Matsuda, 1993). While\nsupported counterspeech could be taken as either an alternative to\nbans or a supplement to them, it remains an under-explored avenue for\nconsidering responses tailored to the particular harms of hate\nspeech.\n",
