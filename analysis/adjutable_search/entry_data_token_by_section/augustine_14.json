Creation and Time).\n A created being can be said to be evil if and only if it falls short\nof its natural goodness by being corrupted or vitiated; strictly\nspeaking, only corruption itself is evil, whereas the nature or\nsubstance or essence (for the equivalence of the terms see De\nmoribus 2.2) of the thing itself remains good\n(Confessiones 7.18; Contra epistulam fundamenti\n35.39 etc.; for a systematic account, De natura boni\n1\u201323; Sch\u00e4fer 2002: 219\u2013239). While this theory can\nexplain physical evil relatively easily either as a necessary feature\nof hierarchically ordered (corporeal) reality (De ordine\n2.51), as a just punishment of sin, or as part of God\u2019s pedagogy\nof salvation (Letter 138.14), it leaves open the question of\nmoral evil or sin itself. Augustine answers by equating moral evil\nwith evil will\n and claims that the seemingly natural question of what causes evil\nwill is unanswerable. His most sustained argument to this effect is\nfound in his explanation of the fall of the devil and the evil angels,\na case that, being the very first occurrence of evil in the created\nworld, allows him to analyze the problem in its most abstract terms\n(De civitate dei 12.1\u20139; cf. already De libero\narbitrio 3.37\u201349; Sch\u00e4fer 2002: 242\u2013300;\nMacDonald 1999). The cause can neither be a substance (which, qua\nsubstance, is good and unable to cause anything evil) nor a will\n(which would in turn have to be an evil will in need of explanation).\nTherefore, an evil will has no \u201cefficient\u201d but only a\n\u201cdeficient\u201d cause, which is none other than the\nwill\u2019s spontaneous defection from God. The fact that evil agents\nare created from nothing and hence are not, unlike God, intrinsically\nunable to sin is a necessary condition of evil but not a sufficient\none (after all the good angels successfully kept their good will). In\nthis context Augustine, in an interesting thought experiment, imagines\ntwo persons of equal intellectual and emotional disposition of whom\none gives in to a temptation while the other resists it; from this he\nconcludes that the difference must be due to a free, spontaneous and\nirreducible choice of the will (De civitate dei 12.6). Here\nat least Augustine virtually posits the will as an independent mental\nfaculty.\n7.6 Grace, Predestination and Original Sin\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, Augustine\u2019s theology of grace has\nbeen regarded as the heart of his Christian teaching, and with good\nreason. As he points out himself, his conviction that human beings in\ntheir present condition are unable to do or even to will the good by\ntheir own efforts is his most fundamental disagreement with ancient,\nespecially Stoic, virtue ethics (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012). After and because of the disobedience of Adam and\nEve, we have lost our natural ability of self-determination, which can\nonly be repaired and restored by the divine grace that has manifested\nitself in the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ and works inwardly\nto free our will from its enslavement to sin.\n Confession of sins and humility are, therefore, basic Christian\nvirtues and attitudes; the philosophers\u2019 confidence in their own\nvirtue that prevents them from accepting the grace of Christ is an\nexample of the sinful pride that puts the self in the place of God and\nwas at the core of the evil angels\u2019 primal sin (De civitate\ndei 10.29).\n\nThe main inspiration for Augustine\u2019s doctrine of grace is, of\ncourse, Paul (even though remarks on human weakness and divine help\nare not absent from the ancient philosophical tradition and especially\nfrom Platonism which had had a strong religious side from the\nbeginning; Augustine claims that with such utterances the Platonists\ninadvertently \u201cconfess\u201d grace, cf. De civitate\ndei 10.29; 22.22). The radical view that the gifts of grace\ninclude not only external good works and the internal volitional\ndisposition that allows us to perform them but even the very first\nbeginnings of faith\u2014in later technical terminology: that grace\nis not \u201ccooperative\u201d but radically\n\u201cprevenient\u201d\u2014is however his own, and it took several\nyears to take shape in his thought. There is some debate on the stages\nof this development (for diverging reconstructions, see\nKarf\u00edkov\u00e1 2012; Cary 2008a; Drecoll 2004\u20132010;\nDrecoll 1999; emphasis on the shifts in Augustine\u2019s thinking:\nLettieri 2001; Flasch 1995; emphasis on continuity: C. Harrison 2006),\nbut it is generally agreed that Augustine\u2019s doctrine of grace\nreached its mature form c. 395\u2013397 with Ad Simplicianum\n1.2, after several years of intense reading and exegesis of Paul, and\ngained higher profile during the Pelagian controversy after 412.\nAugustine emphasizes the necessity of grace for both intellectual\nunderstanding and moral purification already in his earliest works\n(cf. esp. Soliloquia 1.2\u20136), but seems to have been\nconcerned to leave room for human initiative at least with respect to\nfaith and will (which would be in line with his concern, prominent\nthroughout the 390s, to safeguard human responsibility against\nManichean fatalism). In his early exegesis of Paul, he explains\nGod\u2019s apparently gratuitous election of Jacob and rejection of\nEsau (Romans 9:10\u201313) with God\u2019s foreknowledge of\nJacob\u2019s faith and Esau\u2019s infidelity (De diversis\nquaestionibus 68.5; Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 60), a \u201csynergistic\u201d\nreading that relies on the assumption that salvation results from the\ncooperation of divine grace and human initiative and that had been\nstandard in early Christianity since Origen. This explanation is\nexplicitly rejected in Ad Simplicianum (1.2.5\u20136; 8;\n11). In this pivotal text, Augustine, true to his program of\n\u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d,\n attempts an exegesis of Romans 9:9\u201329 that satisfies the\nphilosophical requirements of God\u2019s justice and benevolence\nwhile taking seriously the Pauline point that God\u2019s election is\nentirely gratuitous and not occasioned by any human merit. The guiding\nintention of Romans 9, Augustine now says, is to preclude vainglory\nand pride (ib. 1.2.2) rather than to safeguard human responsibility\n(as had been his view in Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13\u201318). Augustine rehearses\nall possible reasons for God\u2019s election of Jacob\u2014his good\nworks, his good will, his faith and God\u2019s foreknowledge of\neach\u2014and discounts them all as amounting to an election from\nmerit rather than from grace. Starting from the primordial willingness\nto heed God\u2019s call to faith, then, everything that is good in\nJacob must be considered a gift of divine grace. Free will has nothing\nto do with the reception of that gift because nobody can will to\nreceive a divine call to faith nor to respond positively to it so as\nto act accordingly and perform good works out of love (Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2.21; for the Stoically-inspired theory of agency\nbehind this see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom).\n While gratuitous election is, apart from being consoling,\ncomparatively easily squared with the axioms of divine benevolence,\njustice and omnipotence, its corollary, the equally gratuitous\nreprobation and damnation of Esau, is a serious philosophical problem\n(ib. 1.2.8). If it is not to violate the principle of God\u2019s\njustice, it obliges us to assume some kind of evil in Esau, which is\nhowever excluded by Paul\u2019s explicit statement to the contrary\n(Romans 9:11). Augustine\u2019s solution is his doctrine of original\nsin. Both Jacob and Esau have inherited Adam\u2019s guilt that his\nsin has spread over all humankind\u2014a debt that God remits for\nJacob but exacts from Esau for reasons that, Augustine admits,\nnecessarily elude human understanding but are certainly just. Since\nthe Fall, humankind is nothing but a \u201clump of sin\u201d that\nGod might justly have damned as a whole but from which he has chosen\nto save some individuals and to transform them into \u201cvessels of\nmercy\u201d (ib. 1.2.16, cf. Romans 9:23). The notion of original sin\nwas not invented by Augustine but had a tradition in African\nChristianity, especially in Tertullian.\n The view that original sin is a personally imputable guilt that\njustifies eternal damnation is, however, new with Ad\nSimplicianum and follows with logical necessity from the\nexegetical and philosophical claims made there about divine grace and\nelection (Flasch 1995; contrast De libero arbitrio\n3.52\u201355). The theory of Ad Simplicianum is illustrated,\nwith great philosophical acumen and psychological plausibility, in the\nConfessiones (especially bk. 8) and remains in place during\nthe Pelagian controversy till the end of Augustine\u2019s life.\nCuriously, however, there are passages even in his anti-Pelagian work\nthat seem aimed at safeguarding freedom of choice and, accordingly,\nadmit of a \u201csynergistic\u201d reading (De spiritu et\nlittera 60; Cary 2008a: 82\u201386 and, for a different\ninterpretation, Drecoll 2004\u20132010: 207\u2013208). After 412,\npressed by his Pelagian opponents, Augustine paid increasing attention\nto the mechanics of the transmission of original sin. The result was a\nquasi-biological theory that associated original sin closely with\nsexual concupiscence (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality).\n\nAn obvious implication of Augustine\u2019s theory of grace and\nelection is predestination, a subject prominent in his last treatises\nagainst the Pelagians (e.g., De praedestinatione sanctorum,\nwritten after 426) but already implied in Ad Simplicianum.\nGod decides \u201cbefore the constitution of the world\u201d\n(Ephesians 1:4), i.e., (in Neoplatonic terms) in the non-temporal way\nthat matches his transcendent, eternal being (De civitate dei\n11.21; see also\n 10. Creation and Time),\n who will be exempted from the damnation that awaits fallen humankind\nand who will not (\u201cdouble predestination\u201d). This knowledge\nis however hidden to human beings, to whom it will only be revealed at\nthe end of times (De correptione et gratia 49).\n Until then, nobody, not even a baptized Christian, can be sure\nwhether grace has given her true faith and a good will and, if so,\nwhether she will persevere in it till the end of her life so as to be\nactually saved (De correptione et gratia 10\u201325; cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n Like the Stoic determinists before him, Augustine was confronted with\nthe objection that his doctrine of predestination made all human\nactivity pointless (\u201cLazy Argument\u201d). While in Hellenism\nthis had largely been a theoretical issue, it acquired practical\nrelevance under the circumstances of monastic life: some North African\nmonks objected to being rebuked for their misbehavior with the\nargument that they were not responsible for not (yet) enjoying the\ngift of divine grace (De correptione et gratia 6). Taking up\nideas from De magistro\n and from Ad Simplicianum, Augustine replies that rebuke may\nwork as an external admonition, even as a divine calling, that helps\npeople turn to God inwardly and hence must not be withheld (De\ncorreptione et gratia 7\u20139). To the query that\npredestination undermines free will, Augustine gives his usual answer\nthat our freedom of choice has been damaged by original sin and must\nbe liberated by grace if we are to develop the good will necessary for\nvirtue and happiness. The medieval and modern debate on whether grace is\n\u201cirresistible\u201d is, therefore, to some extent\nun-Augustinian (cf. Wetzel 1992: 197\u2013206); some, especially\nlater, texts do however present prevenient grace as converting the\nwill with coercive force (Contra duas epistulas Pelagianorum\n1.36\u201337; cf. already Ad Simplicianum 1.2.22; Cary\n2008a: 105\u2013110). A problem related to predestination but not\nequivalent to it is divine foreknowledge (Matthews 2005: 96\u2013104;\nWetzel 2001; for general discussion, Zagzebski 1991). Augustine\ninherits it from the Hellenistic discussion on future contingents and\nlogical determinism that is best documented in Cicero\u2019s De\nfato. His solution is that while external actions may be\ndetermined, inner volitions are not. These are certainly foreknown by\nGod but exactly as what they are, i.e., as ours and as volitions and\nnot as external compulsions (De civitate dei 5.9\u201310;\ncf. De libero arbitrio 3.4\u201311). This argument is\nindependent of the doctrine of grace and original sin; it applies not\njust to fallen humankind but also to Adam and Eve and even to the\ndevil, whose transgression God had, of course, foreseen (De\ncivitate dei 11.17; 14.11).\n8. History and Political Philosophy\n\nAugustine\u2019s City of God is not a treatise of political\nor social philosophy. It is an extended plea designed to persuade\npeople \u201cto enter the city of God or to persist in it\u201d\n(Letter 2*.3). The criterion of membership in the city of God\n(a metaphor Augustine takes from the Psalms, cf. Psalm 86:3 quoted,\ne.g., in De civitate dei 11.1) and its antagonist, the\nearthly city, is right or wrong love.\n A person belongs to the city of God if and only if he directs his\nlove towards God even at the expense of self-love, and he belongs to\nthe earthly city or city of the devil if and only if he postpones love\nof God for self-love, proudly making himself his greatest good (De\ncivitate dei 14.28). The main argument of the work is that true\nhappiness, which is sought by every human being (ib. 10.1),\n cannot be found outside the city of God founded by Christ (cf. ib. 1,\nprologue). The first ten books deconstruct, in a manner reminiscent of\ntraditional Christian apologetics, the alternative conceptions of\nhappiness in the Roman political tradition (which equates happiness\nwith the prosperity of the Empire, thus falling prey to evil demons\nwho posed as the defenders of Rome but in fact ruined it morally and\npolitically) and in Greek, especially Platonic, philosophy (which,\ndespite its insight into the true nature of God, failed to accept the\nmediation of Christ incarnate out of pride and turned to false\nmediators, i.e., deceptive demons; bks. 8\u201310 have an interesting\ndisquisition on Platonic demonology). Augustine\u2019s approach in\nthe second, positive half is Scriptural, creationist and\neschatological; this fact accounts for the specific character of its\nhistorical dimension. The history of the two cities begins with the\ncreation of the world and the defection of the devil and the sin of\nAdam and Eve (bks. 11\u201314); it continues with the\nprovidentially-governed vicissitudes of the People of Israel (the\nfirst earthly representative of the city of God) and, after the coming\nof Christ, of the Church (bks. 15\u201317, supplemented by a survey\nof the concurrent secular history from the earliest Eastern empires to\ncontemporary Rome in bk. 18); and it ends with the final destination\n(finis, to be understood both ethically as \u201cultimate\ngoal\u201d and eschatologically as \u201cend of times\u201d) of the\ntwo cities in eternal damnation and eternal bliss (bks. 19\u201322;\nfor the structure and basic ideas of the City of God see\nO\u2019Daly 1999). To a great extent, Augustine\u2019s approach is\nexegetical; for him, the history of the city of God is, in substance,\nsacred history as laid down in Scripture (Markus 1970: 1\u201321).\nObviously, however, the heavenly and earthly cities must not be\nconfounded with the worldly institutions of the church and the state.\nIn history, each of these, and the Church in particular, is a mixed\nbody in which members of the city of God and the earthly city coexist,\ntheir distinction being clear only to God, who will separate the two\ncities at the end of times (ib. 1.35; 10.32 etc.). While the city of\nGod is a stranger or, at best, a resident alien (peregrinus:\nib. 15.1; 15.15) in this world and yearns for its celestial homeland,\nthe earthly city is not a unified body at all but lies in continuous\nstrife with itself because it is dominated by lust for power, the most\nwidespread form of the archetypal sin of pride in political and social\nlife (ib. 18.2). All this is in agreement with Augustine\u2019s ideas\non predestination and grace;\n the history of the two cities is essentially the history of fallen\nhumanity. This dualistic account is however qualified when, in the\npart of the work that moves closest to social philosophy, Augustine\nanalyzes the attitude a Christian ought to adopt to the earthly\nsociety she inevitably lives in during her existence in this world.\nStarting, again, from the axiom that all human beings naturally desire\nwhat is good for them, he innovatively determines the goal that every\nindividual and every community in fact pursues as \u201cpeace\u201d\n(pax), which, in his view, is largely equivalent with natural order and subordination. There are higher and lesser degrees of both individual\nand collective peace, e.g., the control of the emotions through\nreason, the subordination of body to soul, the subordination of\nchildren to parents in the family or a functioning hierarchical order\nin the state; at the top is \u201cpeace with God\u201d or the\nsubordination of the human mind to God (ib. 19.13; Weissenberg 2005).\nThe lower forms of peace are relative goods and, as such, legitimately\npursued as long as they are not mistaken for the absolute good.\nPolitical peace and order is sought by members of the city of God and\nthe earthly city alike, but whereas the latter \u201cenjoy\u201d it\nbecause it is the greatest good they can attain and conceive of, the\nformer \u201cuse\u201d it for the sake of their peace with God,\ni.e., in order that they and others may enjoy an unhindered Christian\nreligious life (ib. 19.17; 19.26; for \u201cenjoyment\u201d and\n\u201cuse\u201d see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n Political peace is thus morally neutral insofar as it is a goal\ncommon to Christians and non-Christians. Augustine criticizes Cicero\nbecause he included justice in his definition of the state (Cicero,\nDe re publica 1.39) and thereby gave the earthly state an\ninherent moral quality that in reality is the privilege of the city of\nGod (De civitate dei 19.21). He himself prefers a more\npragmatic definition that makes the consensus about a common object of\n\u201clove\u201d (i.e., a common good agreed on by all members of\nthe community) the criterion of a state; the moral evaluation is not a\nmatter of the definition but depends on the evaluation of the goal it\npursues (cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n The early Roman Empire, which strove for glory, was more tolerable\nthan the Oriental empires that were driven by naked lust for power;\nthe best imaginable goal pursued by an earthly society would be\nperfect earthly peace (ib. 19.24; Weithman 2001: 243\u20134).\nChristians are allowed and even called to work for the well-being of\nthe societies they live in as long as they promote earthly peace for\nthe sake of their citizens\u2019 and their own true happiness; in\npractice, this will usually mean furthering Christian religion (ib.\n5.25\u20136, on the Christian emperors Constantine and Theodosius;\nLetter 155.12; 16; Dodaro 2004b; Tornau 2013). But the doctrine\nof the two cities deliberately precludes any promotion of\nthe emperor or the empire to a providential and quasi-sacred rank. Not\neven Christians in power will be able to overcome the inherent\nwretchedness of fallen humanity (De civitate dei 19.6). Like\nthe vast majority of ancient Christian theologians, Augustine has\nlittle or no interest in social reform. Slavery, meaning unnatural\ndomination of humans over humans, is a characteristic stain of\npostlapsarian human life and, at the same time, an evil that is put to\ngood effects when it secures social order (ib. 19.15; Rist 1994:\n236\u2013239). War results from sin and is the privileged means of\nsatisfying lust for power (ib. 18.2; 19.7). Nevertheless, Augustine\nwrote a letter to refute the claim that Christianity advocated a\npolitically impracticable pacifism (Letter 138). His\nChristian reinterpretation of the traditional Roman Just War Theory\nshould be read in the framework of his general theory of virtue and\npeace (Holmes 1999). To be truly just according to Augustinian\nstandards, a war would have to be waged for the benefit of the\nadversary and without any vindictiveness, in short, out of love of\nneighbor, which, in a fallen world, seems utopian (Letter\n138.14). Wars may however be relatively just if they are defensive and\nproperly declared (cf. Cicero, De officiis 1.36\u201337) or\ncommanded by a just authority even short of the special case of the\nwars of the People of Israel that were commanded by God himself\n(Contra Faustum 22.74\u201378).\n9. Gender, Women, and Sexuality\n\nOutright misogyny is rare in Augustine, but he lived in a society and\nworked from a tradition\u2014both Greco-Roman and\nJudeo-Christian\u2014that took the natural and social subordination\nof women to men largely for granted (cf. B\u00f8rresen 2013: 135\nand, for a sketch of the social and familial realities of late-antique\nRoman Africa, Rist 1994: 210\u2013213; 246\u2013247). Augustine\ninterprets the Genesis tale of the creation of woman (Genesis\n2:18\u201322) to mean that, Eve having been created as a helper to\nAdam and for the sake of reproduction, she was subordinate to him\nalready in paradise (De Genesi ad litteram 6.5.7; 9.5.9).\nThis situation is exacerbated by the Fall; under the conditions of\nfallen humankind, marriage is, for the wives, a kind of slavery that\nthey should accept with obedience and humility (as Monnica did; cf.\nConfessiones 9.19\u201320 and, on marriage in Augustine in\ngeneral, E. Clark 1996). In his early anti-Manichean exegesis of\nGenesis, he allegorizes man as the rational and woman as the\nnon-rational, appetitive parts of the soul (De Genesi contra\nManichaeos 2.15, cf. De vera religione 78; De Genesi\nad litteram 8.23.44; the pattern is well attested in the\nphilosophical tradition). On the other hand, he insists\u2014as until\nthen few Christian theologians had done\u2014that the meaning of the\nGenesis tale was not purely allegorical but that sexual\ndifferentiation had begun to exist in paradise and would persist in\nthe resurrected bodies of the blessed because it was a natural part of\nGod\u2019s creation (De civitate dei 22.17). Following the\nGreek philosophical (in particular, Platonic) conviction that the soul\nand especially its highest, intellectual part is not gendered as well\nas the Pauline eschatological promise that in Christ \u201cthere is\nneither male nor female\u201d (Galatians 3:28), Augustine argues that\nthe words of Genesis 1:26\u201327 on the human being having been\ncreated in the image of God imply that woman is human like man because\nshe has an intellectual soul and because it is not the gendered body\nbut the intellectual soul that makes the human being an image of God\n(De Genesi ad litteram 3.22.34; B\u00f8rresen 2013:\n136\u2013137; cf. also\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God;\n the view that woman is made in the image of God is far from\nuncontroversial in ancient Christianity). The inner tension of the\nview that woman is intellectually equal and, at the same time, by\nnature socially inferior to man makes itself felt in Augustine\u2019s\nexegesis of Paul\u2019s saying that women, but not men, should veil\nthemselves because man is made in the image of God (1 Corinthians\n11:7). Augustine compares man with theoretical and woman (the\n\u201chelper\u201d of Genesis 2:18) with practical reason and claims\nthat while theoretical and practical reason together or reason in its\nentirety is an image of God just as the human being as such is, in virtue\nof its reason, an image of God, practical reason alone, being directed toward corporeal\nthings and but a \u201chelper\u201d of theoretical reason, is not. (By implication, woman is an image of God qua human being, but not qua woman.) The\npractice enjoined by Paul is meant to signify this difference (De\ntrinitate 12.10\u201313). This exegesis safeguards the\ngodlikeness of woman against a widespread patristic consensus and, it\nappears, against Paul himself, but at the same time defends social\ninequality and even endows it with metaphysical and religious\nsignificance (Stark 2007a).\n\nTwo women figure prominently in Augustine\u2019s literary output\n(Power 1995; G. Clark 2015): his mother, Monnica (her name appears\nonly in Confessiones 9.37), and his partner for fourteen years,\nthe mother of Adeodatus. In the dialogues of Cassiciacum, Monnica\nrepresents a philosophical way of life based on the natural intuitions\nof reason and on an unshakable Christian faith together with a life\naccording to the precepts of Christian morality (De beata\nvita 10; De ordine 1.31\u201332). She, and the\nuneducated but faithful in general, may not be able to reach happiness\nin this life by means of an ascent to the divine with the help of the\nliberal arts, but they will certainly see God \u201cfrom face to\nface\u201d in eternal bliss (De ordine 2.45\u201346).\nBehind this idealization may be the male Christian philosopher\u2019s\nnostalgic desire for a \u201cnatural\u201d holiness untainted by\nsecular occupation and learning (Brown 1988: ch. 13, on the Greek\ntheologians and bishops of the fourth century). Monnica\u2019s\nprominence and idealization in the Confessiones has provoked\nmuch, and mostly fruitless, psychological speculation. Augustine\nrepresents her influence on his religious life as pervasive from his\nearliest years onwards and even compares her to the Mother Church\n(Confessiones 1.17). She embodies ideal Christian love of the\nneighbor (see\n 7.3 Love)\n in that she furthers Augustine\u2019s Catholic faith with all her\nmeans (mostly, tears and prayer) and never indulges his Manicheism\ndespite her motherly affection (e.g., Confessiones 3.19).\nWith this she however combines, especially in the earlier books, more\nmundane motives, e.g., when she arranges a marriage for Augustine in\nthe hope of both fencing his sexual concupiscence and assisting his\nworldly career (ib. 6.23). Like the other human influences on\nAugustine reported in the Confessiones, she is used by God as\nan instrument of his grace in a way she neither foresees nor wills.\nOnly after Augustine\u2019s conversion does she rise to saintly\nperfection, especially in the \u201cvision of Ostia\u201d when,\nshortly before her death, mother and son, after a long\nphilosophico-theological conversation, reach a sudden insight into\nwhat contemplation of the transcendent God in eternal bliss must be\nlike (ib. 9.24\u201325). The chapter on the dismissal of\nAdeodatus\u2019 mother for the sake of an advantageous marriage (ib.\n6.25; Shanzer 2002; Miles 2007) has been unpalatable for many modern\nreaders. Yet what is unusual about it is not Augustine\u2019s\nbehavior but the fact that he mentions it at all and, from hindsight,\nreflects on the pain it caused him. True to the deliberately\ncounter-intuitive and often provocative procedure of the\nConfessiones, he singles out an emotion that, then as now,\nmost people would have easily understood but which he nevertheless\ninterprets as a mark of his sinful state because it resulted from the\nloss of a female body he had, in a kind of mutual sexual exploitation,\nenjoyed for the sake of pleasure (Confessiones 4.2; for the\nunderlying defective view, common in antiquity, of erotic\nrelationships cf. Rist 1994: 249) instead of \u201cenjoying\u201d\nhis female neighbor \u201cin God\u201d and relating their mutual\nlove to him (cf.\n 7.1 Happiness;\n compare Augustine\u2019s excessive grief about the friend of his\nyouth in Confessiones 4.9\u201311 and contrast his\npost-conversion mourning of Monnica, ib. 9.30\u201333).\n\nAugustine\u2019s views on sexuality are most prominent in his\nanti-Pelagian treatises, where he develops a theory about the\ntransmission of original sin from the first couple in paradise to\nevery human being born since, making sexual concupiscence the prime\nfactor in the process (cf. E. Clark 1996 and 2000, who also takes into\naccount Augustine\u2019s Manichean past). In Augustine\u2019s\nethics, concupiscence (concupiscentia) does not have a\nspecifically sexual meaning but is an umbrella term that covers all\nvolitions or intentions opposed to right love (see\n\n Nisula 2012). The transgression of Adam and Eve did not consist\nin sexual concupiscence but in their disobedience, which, like the\nevil angels\u2019 primal sin, was rooted in pride (see\n 7.5 Will and Evil).\n For this disobedience they, and all humankind with them, were\npunished with the disobedience of their own selves, i.e., the\nimpossibility of fully controlling their own appetites and volitions\nand the permanent akratic state (the \u201ccoveting of the flesh\nagainst the spirit\u201d, in the words of Galatians 5:17) that marks\nfallen humanity. The inability of human beings to control their sexual\ndesires and even their sexual organs (witness the shameful experiences\nof involuntary male erection or of impotence: De civitate dei\n14.15\u201316) is just an especially obvious example. Unlike most\nearlier Christian writers, Augustine thought that there was sexual\nintercourse in paradise and that there would have been procreation\neven without the fall; he did not share the encratic ideas of some\nascetic circles who hoped to make good for the first sin through\nsexual abstinence, and he had comparatively moderate views on\nvirginity and sexual continence (De sancta virginitate;\nB\u00f8rresen 2013: 138; Brown 1988: ch. 19). But he thought that\nAdam and Eve had been able to control their sexual organs voluntarily\nso as to limit their use to the natural purpose of procreation; in\nparadise, there had been sexuality but no concupiscence (De\ncivitate dei 14.21\u201323). Original sin had destroyed this\nideal state, and since then sexual concupiscence is an inevitable\nconcomitant of procreation\u2014an evil that may be put to good use\nin legitimate marriage, where the purpose of sexual intercourse is the\nprocreation of children rather than bodily pleasure (De nuptiis et\nconcupiscentia 1.16; Contra Iulianum 3.15\u201316), but\nthat nevertheless subjects every newborn human being to the domination\nof the devil from which they need to be freed through baptism (De\nnuptiis et concupiscentia 1.25\u201326; for energetic criticism\nof Augustine\u2019s views on concupiscence, inter alia\nbecause of their impact on the sex morals of modern Christianity, see\nPagels 1989, for moderate defense Lamberigts 2000).\n10. Creation and Time\n\nJust as the late-antique Platonists developed their cosmological\nthinking by commenting on Plato\u2019s Timaeus,\nAugustine\u2019s natural philosophy is largely a theory of creation\nbased on an exegesis of the opening chapters of Genesis, on which he\nwrote five extended, and occasionally diverging, commentaries (De\nGenesi contra Manichaeos; De Genesi ad litteram liber\nimperfectus; Confessiones 11\u201313; De Genesi ad\nlitteram; De civitate dei 11\u201314). The longest and\nmost important of them is the Literal Commentary on Genesis\n(De Genesi ad litteram). \u201cLiteral\u201d does not mean\n\u201cliteralist\u201d but denotes the hermeneutic assumption that\nthe text is really about the creation of the world (as opposed to a\nmoralist or prophetic allegorical reading of the kind proposed in\nAugustine\u2019s early De Genesi contra Manichaeos; the two\napproaches are compatible because Augustine, like Origen and the\nJewish exegete Philo before him, believes in the existence of multiple\nlayers of meaning in Scripture; see De Genesi ad litteram\n1.1.1 and, in general, De doctrina christiana, bk. 3). In\nline with his epistemology of illumination and his theory of verbal\nsigns,\n Augustine takes the biblical creation tale as an\n\u201cadmonition\u201d that prompts him to devise, with the help of\nthe \u201cinner teacher\u201d, a rational theistic cosmology based\non Trinitarian theology (for rejection of explanations that contradict\nthe findings of the natural philosophers or the laws of nature cf.,\ne.g., De Genesi ad litteram 2.9.21). In De Genesi ad\nlitteram, in the Confessiones and, to a lesser extent,\nin De civitate dei Augustine presents his exegesis in a\nquestioning manner and keeps the results open to revision. The reason\nis that, according to the hermeneutics developed especially in bk. 12\nof the Confessiones, the authorial intention of the\nScriptural text, or indeed of any text, cannot be recovered, so\nthat\u2014given that the truthfulness of Scripture can be taken for\ngranted\u2014different and even incompatible readings must be\nconsidered as adequate if they agree with what the text says and if\nthey are sanctioned by the truth which we access inwardly through\nreason and which is, ultimately, God himself (see esp.\nConfessiones 12.27; 43; De doctrina christiana 3.38\nwhere Augustine claims that the Holy Spirit providentially allowed for\na plenitude of Scriptural meanings in order to prompt different people\nto different aspects of the truth; Williams 2001; van Riel 2007; Dutton 2014: 175\u2013179;\nand, on the epistemological foundations of this hermeneutics, Cary\n2008b: 135\u2013138). The basic and recurrent features of\nAugustine\u2019s cosmological thought are these (cf. Knuuttila 2001:\n103\u2013109; Mayer 1996\u20132002, each with references): God does\nnot create in time but creates time together with changeable being\nwhile resting in timeless eternity himself (Confessiones\n11.16; De Genesi ad litteram 5.5.12; the distinction of\neternity and time is Platonic, cf. Timaeus 37c-38b; Plotinus,\nEnneads III.7.1). Creation occurs instantaneously; the seven\ndays of creation are not to be taken literally but are a didactic\nmeans to make plain the intrinsic order of reality\n(Confessiones 12.40; De Genesi ad litteram 1.15.29).\nLike the demiurge in the Timaeus, God creates out of\ngoodness, i.e., out of his good will and his gratuitous love for his\ncreation (De civitate dei 11.24). In creation, all three\npersons of the Trinity are active, with, roughly, the Father\naccounting for the existence, the Son (to whom, in Augustine\u2019s\nreading, the opening words of Genesis, in principio, refer)\nfor the form or essence and the Holy Spirit for the goodness and\norderliness of every created being (Confessiones 11.11;\nDe civitate dei 11.24). As the causality of the Trinity makes\nitself felt everywhere in creation, Augustine likes to describe\ncreated beings in their relation to the divine cause in a triadic\nmanner, using, e.g., the categories \u201cmeasure\u201d,\n\u201cform\u201d and \u201cpeace/order\u201d (e.g., De vera\nreligione 13; De natura boni 3; De civitate dei\n12.5; cf. Sch\u00e4fer 2000 and, for a very thorough discussion, du\nRoy 1966). These \u201ctraces\u201d of the Trinity in creation must\nnot be confused with the Trinitarian structure of the human intellect,\nwhich, alone among all created beings, is an image of God.\n Changeable being is not generated from God (which, according to the\nNicene Creed, is true only of the Son) but created out of nothing, a\nfact that partly accounts for its susceptibility for evil.\n More precisely, God \u201cfirst\u201d creates formless matter out\nof nothing (which is why matter in Augustine, unlike in the\nNeoplatonists, has a minimal ontological status; cf.\nConfessiones 12.6; Tornau 2014: 189\u2013194) and\n\u201cthen\u201d forms it by conveying to it the rational principles\n(rationes) that eternally exist in his mind (De diversis\nquaestionibus 46.2) or, as Augustine prefers to put it, in his\nWord, i.e., the Second Person of the Trinity. This formative process\nis Augustine\u2019s exegesis of the biblical \u201cword\u201d of\nGod (Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1). Incorporeal and purely intellectual\nbeings, i.e., the angels, are created from intelligible matter which\nis created out of nothing and converted to the creator so as to be\nformed through the \u201chearing\u201d of God\u2019s word, i.e., by\ntheir contemplation of the Forms contained in God (De Genesi ad\nlitteram 1.4.9\u20131.5.11, an idea inspired by the Neoplatonic\npattern of abiding, procession and return). Corporeal being is created\nwhen the Forms or rational principles contained in God and\ncontemplated by the angels are even further externalized so as to\ninform not only intelligible but also physical matter (De Genesi\nad litteram 2.8.16; 4.22.39).\n\nAll this is the framework of Augustine\u2019s famous meditation about\ntime in the Confessiones (11.17\u201341), whose context is\nan exegesis of Genesis and which constantly presupposes the\ndistinction of time and eternity (much has been written on this text,\nbut particularly illuminating treatments are Flasch 1993; Mesch 1998:\n295\u2013343; Matthews 2005: 76\u201385; Helm 2014; Hoffmann 2017).\nAugustine opens the section with the question, \u201cWhat is\ntime?\u201d (Confessiones 11.17) but in fact has no\nintention of giving a definition of time. Whereas his accounts outside\nthe Confessiones center on cosmic or physical time, he here\nfocuses on how we experience time from a first-person perspective and\nwhat it means for us and our relationship to ourselves and to God to\nexist temporally. In this sense, the purpose of the book is ethical\nrather than cosmological. Augustine begins by observing that though of\nthe three familiar \u201cparts\u201d of time, past, present and\nfuture, none really exists (the past having ceased to exist, the\nfuture not existing yet, and the present being without extension),\ntime doubtless has reality for us. This is so because time is present\nto us in the form of our present memory of the past, our present\nattention to the present and our present expectation of the future\n(ib. 11.26). The phenomenal proof of this claim is the experience of\nmeasuring time by comparing remembered or expected portions of time to\neach other or of repeating a poem we know by heart, when, as we\nproceed, the words traverse our attention (the present), passing from\nexpectation (the future) to memory (the past; ib. 11.38). We would\nthus be unable to relate past, present and future events, to remember\nthe history of our own lives and even to be aware of our personal\nidentity if our being in time was not divided into memory, attention\nand expectation and, at the same time, unified by the connectedness\nand the simultaneous presence of these. This ambivalent state\nAugustine calls \u201ca distention of the soul\u201d (ib. 11.33;\n38\u201339, perhaps echoing Plotinus, Enneads III.7.11.41);\nthis is the closest Confessiones 11 comes to a definition of\ntime. The stability of this precarious unity is however dependent on\nthe higher unity of the eternal God\u2014as the whole narrative of\nthe Confessiones teaches, we cannot make sense of the memory\nof our life unless we perceive the ceaseless presence of God\u2019s\nprovidence and grace in it. Toward the end of the book, Augustine\nintroduces the Pauline \u201cstraining forward to what lies\nahead\u201d (Philippians 3:12\u201314)\u2014as he reads it, the\norientation or \u201cintention\u201d of the soul toward God\u2014as\na counterpoint to the soul\u2019s distention in time and concludes\nwith an exhortation to turn from the dispersion of temporal existence\nto the timeless eternity of God which alone guarantees truth and\nstability (ib. 11.39\u201341).\n",
