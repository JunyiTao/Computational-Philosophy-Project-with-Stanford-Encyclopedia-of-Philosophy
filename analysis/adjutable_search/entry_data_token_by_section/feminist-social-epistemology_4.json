    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowers || Communities as Knowers\n2.3 Communities as Knowers\n\n\nStatements pointing to communities as knowers can be found in a wide\nvariety of feminist epistemologists (Harding 1993; Longino 2002; Nelson\n1990; Potter 1993), though they do not all embrace the same\narguments.\n\n\nSome arguments to the effect that it is communities rather than\nindividuals who are properly thought of as knowers build on the\narguments for the interactive nature of knowers. For example, Helen\nLongino argues that claims and theories can only achieve the status of\nknowledge by going through a public process of critical scrutiny, in\nwhich individual knowers engage with each other epistemically in joint\nendeavors. She allows that individuals can know particular claims, but\nit is communities who are the knowledge producers, since it takes\nsocial processes of critical engagement to transform beliefs and\ntheories into knowledge (2002). The norms that must be satisfied to\nachieve knowledge are communal norms, requiring certain social\ninteractions to occur. \n\n\nOther feminist social epistemologists who embrace a community model of\nknowers do so based on arguments that there are crucial public and\nshared elements of knowing that cannot be understood by viewing\nindividuals in isolation (Webb 1995). Along these lines, communities\ncan be understood as knowers in the sense that a communal context is\nrequired for knowing. Individuals know only within communities.\nArguments for such a view are supported by claims that language and\nconceptual schemas are required for knowledge, which are themselves\ncommunity specific and acquired by individuals through participation\nin communities. A great deal of work in feminist social epistemology\nand feminist science studies has documented how gendered assumptions\nthat stem from features of our social organization make their way into\nthe metaphors and conceptual schemas of knowledge production (for\nexample, Bleier 1984; Haraway 1991; Hubbard 1983; Keller 1985, 1992;\nLloyd 1984; Martin 1991). Many feminist social epistemologists have\nfound it necessary to turn to the level of the communally-shared\nconcepts and assumptions in order to explain why gendered work has\nbeen accepted and gone unnoticed within science for so long.\n\n\nAn argument advocating an even stronger model of communities as\nprimary knowers comes from Lynn Hankinson Nelson (1990, 1993). Nelson\u2019s\nwork is inspired by Quine and his holistic theory of evidence in which\nthere are no firm boundaries between evidence and theory. What Nelson\nincludes in her conception of evidence that Quine did not is the larger\nsocial and political context within which science is produced. She\ncouples this with arguments for the historically dynamic nature of the\ncategory of evidence; changes in public and communal standards of\nevidence will result in changes to the evidence itself. According to\nNelson it is communities who construct and share knowledge and\nstandards of evidence, and thus it must be communities who are the\nprimary agents of knowledge (Nelson 1990, 256). Nelson\u2019s point is that\nif we are to understand why a particular theory is supported at a\nparticular time, we must examine communities, not just isolated\nindividuals. Her arguments allow her to explain how androcentric\nscience has lost its evidential support: although androcentric science\nmay have enjoyed considerable evidential support at one time, changes\nin the social and political context of particular communities resulted\nin feminist work both revealing and resisting the influence of\nandrocentric assumptions. This shift in the communal standards of\nevidence has diminished evidential support for androcentric\nresearch.\n\n\nFeminist social epistemologists who argue for a community model of\nknowers do not deny that individuals also know. However, their accounts\nchallenge the possibility of understanding individuals as knowers in\nisolation from their communities, and press for a better understanding\nof the relative roles of individuals and communities in knowing. For\nexample, communal accounts of knowing suggest that the epistemic\nresponsibilities of individuals will need to be understood in relation\nto their communal memberships, which set limits on the conceptual\nresources and epistemic tools individuals have available to\n them.[11] \nCynthia Townley has also argued that understanding our relationships\nwithin communities is crucial to understanding epistemic practices,\nsince those practices involve us in far more than simply generating\nknowledge for ourselves; each of us negotiates instead a variety of\nepistemic roles and dependencies beyond generating knowledge and being\nreliable testifiers (Townley 2011). \n",
