    "main_text": "\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Madhyamaka Thought || The Two Truths: Ultimate Truths\n1.1 The Two Truths: Ultimate Truths\n\nA presentation of the two truths is a standard way by which Madhyamaka\nphilosophers explain their views on the ontological status of\nphenomena. It is seen as the most effective method for coursing a\n\u201cmiddle way\u201d between the philosophical extremes of\nasserting the absolute existence of phenomena on the one hand, and the\nnon-existence of them on the other. Thus, M\u0101dhyamikas will\nroutinely claim that phenomena lack a certain mode of existence\nultimately, but claim that such phenomena, or objects of knowledge,\nmaintain another mode conventionally. Virtually all Indian Madhyamaka\nphilosophers will claim, in some detail, that an ultimate truth is an\nobject\u2019s emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), or lack of\nhaving a truly existent essence or intrinsic nature. This claim, which\nruns the danger of leading to nihilism, is then tempered to some\ndegree by claims about the conventional mode of existence of those\nphenomena. Though phenomena do not ultimately exist, they do exist\nconventionally. The precise way in which individual Madhyamaka\nthinkers define and describe these two truths gets at the core of what\nmakes each of these important thinkers unique.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is famous for presenting his views on\nultimate truths by way of one of the most famous Buddhist\nphilosophical arguments on the ontological status of phenomena, the\nneither-one-nor-many argument (Skt. ek\u0101nekaviyogahetu,\nTib. gcig du bral gyi tan tshigs).\n",
