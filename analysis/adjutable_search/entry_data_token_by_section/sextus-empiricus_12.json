    "main_text": "M I\u2013VI\n5. M I\u2013VI\n\n\nThe six books of M I\u2013VI, taken together, constitute an\nattack on the liberal arts. For their general aim, see Barnes 1988. The\nmost important feature of M I\u2013VI, which can be misleading, is\nthat in them, there is often the appearance of negative dogmatism, i.e.,\nof claims that this or that art doesn\u2019t exist. Take for example\nM I 90: \u2018So let this stand to show the non-existence of\ngrammar, at least on the grammarians\u2019 conception of it\u2019. Bett 2018: 11\u201315 urges us to view such moments as traces of a previous stage of Pyrrhonism. Alternatively,\nrather than interpret this as occasional departures from Sextus\u2019\nover-arching plan to induce suspension of judgment (which is in any\ncase still present in texts such as M I 6), one could take\nthese apparent statements of negative dogmatism to be \u2018the\nequipollent counterpoise to the technicians\u2019 arguments\u2019\n(Blank 1998: l, summarising Barnes 1988: 72\u20137). (See above 4.2 for a\nsimilar story about M XI.)\n\nI.\n M I 1\u201340 is a highly general introduction to all six\nworks, and then Against the Grammarians starts properly at I\n41. For this work, see Blank 1998. Against the Grammarians is\nmuch the longest of the six books, standing at 320 sections. There is\ndiscussion of the question \u2018What is Grammar?\u2019 (57\u201389), an\nattack on the \u2018expert\u2019 part of grammar, i.e., the part\nconcerned with letters, parts of speech, etc. (99\u2013247), and an attack\non the part of grammar which concerns poets and prose-writers\n(270\u2013320), i.e., the part which deals with the interpretation of poetry,\nand which Sextus argues is useless because it makes no contribution to\nhuman flourishing.\nII.\n Against the Rhetoricians is shorter, at only 113\nsections. It considers various definitions of what rhetoric is, what\nbenefit rhetoric is to individuals or to cities, what the goal of\nrhetoric is, and what the parts of rhetoric are, all with a view to\nattacking its status as an art.\nIII.\n Against the Geometers stands at 116 sections. It takes\ngeometers to task for their employment of hypotheses in establishing\ntheorems, and then attacks the hypotheses themselves, such as the\ndefinitions of body, point, line (particularly the definition of the\nline as \u2018length without breadth\u2019), and angle. For this\nwork, see Dye and Vitrac 2009.\nIV.\n Against the Arithmeticians has a mere 34 sections. This\nwork outlines the extraordinary views of the Pythagoreans concerning\nthe power of numbers, and then seeks to undermine them by arguing that\nPlatonic notion of a monad or unit (\u2018the One\u2019) is\n\u2018inconceivable\u2019 (17), adding as an aside that the notion of\na dyad doesn\u2019t fare much better (21\u201322), and by attacking the\nprinciples of addition and subtraction (23\u201333). \u2018But if number is\nconceived as subsisting through addition, as I said, and subtraction,\nand we have shown that neither of these exists, one must declare that\nnumber is nothing\u2019 (34). The work thus has a clear structure:\npresentation of arguments in favour of the existence of numbers (from\nthe Pythagoreans), followed by presentation of arguments against the\nexistence of numbers.\nV.\n Against the Astrologers, in 106 sections. Sextus attacks\nnot astronomy (1), which is one thing the term \u2018astrology\u2019\nreferred to in classical times, but \u2018the casting of\nnativities\u2019 (Bury\u2019s translation of the term\n\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b8\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\nin section 2) and horoscopes. The first half of the work involves\nSextus laying out the basics of the Chaldean theory of prognostication,\nand the second half contains his counterarguments, including\nfascinating observations about the difficulty of establishing when\nsomeone is conceived, the difficulty of establishing when they are born\n(\u2018is it when the child begins to emerge into the cold air, or\nwhen it has emerged a little, or when it is deposited on the\nground?\u2019, M V 65), and the difficulty of using accurate\ntime-keeping devices to detect which astronomical phenomena are\noccurring at what time.\nVI.\n Against the Musicians is in 68 sections. For this work,\nsee Greaves 1986; Bett 2013. Sextus attacks the standing of music as a science, by\nquestioning whether it is useful for happiness (7\u201337) and by\nquestioning whether it is a science at all (38\u201368), just as he did in\nthe case of grammar (a comparison Sextus himself makes at section 4).\nIn the first part, Sextus assembles arguments in favour of music being\nuseful for happiness (7\u201318) and arguments against (19\u201337); the second\npart consists wholly of the arguments against the existence of music as\na suitable subject for theoretical discourse, with Sextus leaving\nunstated the arguments in favour.\n\n",
