    "main_text": "Parmenides of Elea\n4. Parmenides of Elea\n\nParmenides, born ca. 510 BCE in the Greek colony of Elea in southern\nItaly (south of Naples, and now known as Velia), explores the nature\nof philosophical inquiry, concentrating less on the contents of knowledge or\nunderstanding (although he has views about these) than on what sort of thing can be\nunderstood. Xenophanes identified genuine knowledge with the grasping\nof the sure and certain truth and claimed that \u201cno man has\nseen\u201d it, at least with respect to some topics (DK21B34/LM8D49);\nHeraclitus had asserted that divine nature, not human, has right\nunderstanding (DK22B78/LM9D74), although he implies that some humans\ncan acquire divine-like understanding. Parmenides argues that human\nthought can reach genuine knowledge or understanding, and that there\nare certain marks or signs that act as guarantees that the goal of\nknowledge has been reached. A fundamental part of Parmenides\u2019\nclaim is that what must be (cannot not-be, as Parmenides puts\nit) is more knowable than what is merely contingent (what may or may\nnot be), which can be the object only of belief. \n\nParmenides gives us a poem in Homeric hexameters, narrating the\njourney of a young man (a kouros, in Greek) who is taken to\nmeet a goddess who promises to teach him \u201call things\u201d\n(DK28B1/LM19D4). The content of the story the goddess tells is not the\nknowledge that will allow humans, by having it, to know. Rather, the\ngoddess gives the kouros the tools to acquire that knowledge\nhimself:\n\nIt is right that you learn all things,\n\nBoth the unshaking heart of well-persuasive truth,\n\nand the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust.\n\nBut nevertheless, you shall learn these things too, how it were right\nthat the things that seem be reliably, being indeed the whole of\nthings. (DKB1.28\u201332/LMD4.28\u201332; the last two lines text are uncertain.)\n\n\nThe goddess does not provide the kouros with a list of true\npropositions, as a body of knowledge for him to acquire, and false\nones to be avoided. Rather, in teaching him how to evaluate claims\nabout what-is, the goddess unleashes the kouros\u2019 own\ncognitive powers to know everything, by testing and evaluation,\naccepting or rejecting claims about the ultimate nature of\nthings\u2014 for that alone is capable of being known. For\nParmenides, the mark of what is known is that it is something that\ngenuinely is, with no taint of what-is-not. That is why, for him,\nwhat-is not only is, but must be and cannot not-be. He sets this out\nin the key passages of DKB2 and\n B3/LM19D6:[5]\n\nCome now, and I will tell you, and you, hearing, preserve the story,\n\nthe only routes of inquiry there are for thinking;\n\nthe one that it is and that it cannot not be\n\nis the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon truth)\n\nthe other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,\n\nthis I point out to you is a path wholly inscrutable\n\nfor you could not know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)\n\nnor could you point it out\u2026 For the same thing is for thinking\nand for being.\n\n\nThe routes are methods of inquiry: keeping on the correct route will\nbring one to what-is, the real object of thought and understanding.\nAlthough what the goddess tells the kouros has divine\nsanction (hers), that is not why he should accept it. Rather, the\ntruth she tells reveals a mark of its own truth: it is testable by\nreason or thought itself. In DKB7/LMD8 the goddess warns that we must\ncontrol our thought in the face of the ever-present seductions of\nsense-experience:\n\nFor never shall this be forced through: that things that are not are;\n\nbut restrain your thought from this route of inquiry,\n\nnor let much-experienced habit force you along this path,\n\nto ply an aimless eye and resounding ear\n\nand tongue, but judge by reasoning (logos) the much-battled\ntesting\n\nspoken by me.\n\n\nThe kouros himself can reach a decision or determination of\nthe truth solely through use of his logos. Logos\nhere means thinking or reasoning (Parmenides probably means the human\ncapacity for thought in general). The test (restated at\nB8.15\u201316/LMD8.20\u201321, is \u201cis or is not?\u201d This\nis not just a question of non-contradiction (which would give us\ncoherence), but an inquiry whether or not the supposition that\nsomething is would entail, on further examination, the reality of\nwhat-is-not (which is impossible). \n\nThe arguments of DKB8/LMD8 demonstrate how what-is must be.\nIn applying these arguments as tests against any suggested basic\nentity in the Presocratic search for ultimate causes or principles,\nthe kouros can determine whether or not a proposed theory is\nacceptable. For Parmenides noos is not itself an infallible\ncapacity. One can think well or badly; correct thinking is that which\ntakes the correct route and so reaches what-is. The mortals on the\nincorrect route are thinking, but their thoughts have no real object\n(none that is real in the appropriate way), and so cannot be completed\nor perfected by reaching the truth. In B8 Parmenides sets out the\ncriteria for the being of what-is, and then the arguments for those\ncriteria:\n\n\u2026 a single account still\n\nremains of the route that it is; and on this route there are\n\nvery many signs, that what-is is ungenerable and imperishable,\n\na whole of a single kind, and unshaking and complete;\n\nnor was it nor will it be, since it is now all together\n\none, cohesive. (DKB8.1\u20136/LMD8.6\u201311)\n\n\nAny thing that genuinely is cannot be subject to coming-to-be or\npassing-away, must be of a single nature, and must be complete, in the\nsense of being unchangeably and unalterably what it is. These are\nsigns for what any ultimate cause or principle must be like, if it is\nto be satisfactory as a principle, as something that can be known. The\nsigns are adverbial, showing how what-is is (Mourelatos 2008). Only an\nentity which is in the complete way can be grasped and understood in\nits entirety by thought. McKirahan (2008) provides a thorough analysis\nof the arguments of DKB8/LMD8, as do Palmer (2009) and Graham\n(2010).\n\nAfter laying out the arguments about what-is, the goddess turns to the\nroute of mortals, in an account which she calls\n\u201cdeceptive.\u201d Although Parmenides has been read as thus\nrejecting any possibility of cosmological inquiry (Barnes 1979, Owen\n1960), there are forceful interpretations that allow for justified\nbelief about the contingent world, a world that may or may not be, and\nis not such that it must be (Nehamas 2002, Curd 2004, Palmer 2009).\nThe problem of mortals is that they mistake what they perceive for\nwhat there is (and must be). As long as one realizes that the world of\nperception is not genuinely real, and cannot therefore be the object\nof knowledge, it may be possible for there to be justified belief\nabout the cosmos. Some details of Parmenides\u2019 own cosmology are\ngiven, arguably as justified belief, in the Doxa section of\nthe poem, and more in the testimonia from later authors. Parmenides\nseems to have been the first Presocratic to claim that the moon gets\nits light from from the sun and that the earth is spherical. Recently\nscholars have focused on these claims about the natural world, and\nhave argued that Parmenides should be understood as offering an\naccount of appearances that can and should be deemed acceptable\n(Palmer 2009, Cordero 2010, Graham 2013, Mourelatos 2013, Bryan 2012,\nJohansen 2016). Nevertheless, Parmenides marks a sharp distinction\nbetween being (what-is and must be) and becoming, and between\nknowledge and perception-based belief or opinion.\n",
