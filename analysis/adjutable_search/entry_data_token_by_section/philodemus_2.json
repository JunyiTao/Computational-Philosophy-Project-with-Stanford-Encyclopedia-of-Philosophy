    "main_text": "Life || Naples, Herculaneum, and the Villa of the Papyri\n1.4 Naples, Herculaneum, and the Villa of the Papyri\n\n\nPhilodemus and Piso may have begun their association in Rome, where\nthe rising young politician will certainly have spent much time, or\nelse in Campania, well-known as a haunt of Epicureans, especially of\nSiro, teacher of Vergil and Horace, and where Philodemus too seems to\nhave taught. Siro and Philodemus, whom Cicero calls \u2018excellent\nmen and very learned\u2019, are associated as living in Naples and\nengaging in philosophical discussions (Cicero, On Moral Ends\n2.119 [T1 Sider]). Several books of Philodemus\u2019 On Vices\naddress a coterie of poetically minded Romans, Vergil along with three\nother associates of Maecenas and friends of Horace: L. Varius Rufus,\nPlotius Tucca, P. Quintilius Varus (PHerc. 1082 col. xi, and a treatise on calumny in \nPHerc. Paris, 2; cf. Horace, Satires 1.5,\n1.10 and Sider 1997: 19\u201323).\n\n\nIt is often assumed that Philodemus lived and worked, and perhaps\neven gathered an Epicurean circle of friends, in the luxurious villa on\nthe edge of the Campanian seaside town of Herculaneum in the ruins of\nwhich the papyri of his works were found, dubbed \u2018Villa of the\nPapyri\u2019 (see Section 2.2.1). A nest of conjectures has\nbeen woven on the basis of the presence of the papyri in the Villa,\nespecially of multiple copies of some of Philodemus\u2019 and\nEpicurus\u2019 works, as well as of an apparent draft copy of one work (the Index Academicorum, a manuscript that may be in the format of the \u2018model book\u2019 made to determine the length of further copies (On the Gods III), a few manuscripts that appear to bear stylistic corrections by Philodemus himself, if not in his own hand (see Essler 2017), and copies of the works of other Epicureans (Demetrius of Laconia,\nColotes, Polystratus, Carne\u00efscus, Metrodorus and Zeno of Sidon),\nalong with (at least) two books by the Stoic Chrysippus. There is also\na group of Latin papyri, apparently of non-philosophical character (a Latin poem on the battle of Actium in PHerc. 817 has long been known, and the historical work From the beginning of the Civil Wars by Seneca the Elder has recently been identified in PHerc. 1067),\nexcept perhaps for a manuscript of Lucretius. (On the contents of the\nlibrary at Herculaneum, see Sider 2005 and Delattre 2006; on the\nidentification by K. Kleve of a possible manuscript of Lucretius, see\nDelattre 2003.)\n\nThe conjecture that the Villa\nbelonged to the family of Piso is supported by the presence in the tablinum of a bust, popularly known as the \u2019Pseudo-Seneca\u2019 (MAAN 5616), which some scholars have identified as being of Philodemus\u2019 patron Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul in 58, d. ca. 42 BCE), and by the statue of Panathenaic Athena (MAAN 6007, from the square courtyard), a figure with whom Piso is associated by a statue base in Athens (on these statues see Mattusch 2005: 249\u2013253, 147\u2013151; on the Villa\u2019s owner 20\u201323, 357\u2013358); a bronze bust found in Herculaneum (MAAN 5601) of a young man identified as that of Piso\u2019s son Lucius, consul in 15 BCE and also pontifex and prefect of the city of Rome until his death in 32 CE, is not clearly from the Villa; it is in any case clear that the family of the Pisones had a villa in the resort of Baiai on the other side of the Bay of Naples. (For discussion of theories of the Villa\u2019s ownership, see Capasso 2010b.)\n\nIt is often thought that, if the Villa belonged to Piso, it may also have been where Philodemus himself lived\nand wrote, and that the book-rolls belonged to Philodemus\u2019 own\nlibrary, partly assembled in Athens before his arrival in Italy, and\nthen increased by his own writings, which were, perhaps, copied in a\nscriptorium on the premises, as they were composed and, in some cases,\nrecopied later (cf. Cavallo 1983). That at least the philosophical papyri belonged to\nPhilodemus is plausible: but there are some reasons to doubt the\nrest of this pleasing speculation.\n\n\nFirst, it is possible that more of the papyri were copied in the\nfirst century CE than has usually been thought, which would put them\noutside the lifetime of Philodemus. Rather a large number of scribes\nworked on the papyri, and there are indications that the copies we have\nwere only some among many copies of the same works. There is little\nindication, too, that the papyri were actually copied in Herculaneum;\nand we have little understanding of whatever book trade existed in\nCampania in the first century BCE. While Naples was a prominent Greek\ncity and may well have supported a trade in Greek books, as it\ncertainly supported an Epicurean school led by Siro, Rome was now the\ncenter of the world (cf. Sedley 2003) and a place where Philodemus\ncould have found many of the books he cited in his work.\n\n\nAnother set of difficulties concern Philodemus\u2019 connections\nwith Herculaneum. There is good cause to link Philodemus with Naples,\nand the \u2018humble shack\u2019 to which he invites Piso for the\ncommemoration of Epicurus\u2019 birthday (see Section 2.1)\nmay have been there or somewhere in the vicinity, perhaps including\nHerculaneum. Yet there is little or no ancient testimony associating\nhim with Herculaneum: what has been thought to be the single mention of the town in the papyri\nthemselves (PHerc. 312 col. 4 Gigante [T15 Sider]) is clear in associating Philodemus with Naples and with friendly philosophical discussion, but the toponym \u2018Herculaneum\u2019 is probably not to be read there, and in any event the text does not say that Philodemus lived there. Moreover, if Philodemus was likely dead by 30 BCE, about a\ncentury would pass between that event and the eruption that buried the\nvilla and its library: why would the books have remained there during\nthat period?\n\n\nBy far the largest number of the books\u2014probably all or nearly\nall the philosophical texts\u2014were stored on shelves in a small\nroom with no furniture for reading; some others were in one or two\nsmall cabinets in the tablinum, off the square peristyle,\nwhere books might be read; still others were in traveling boxes\n(capsae) in several areas of the villa, e.g., at the near end\nof the long peristyle. The philosophical library was perhaps one\nisolated, specialized collection, acquired by a collector who also\nacquired Philodemus\u2019 own library. It was perhaps left behind\nbecause unused and unwanted, while other books were removed from the\nvilla before the final catastrophe. The presence of copies of Philodemus\u2019 works made after his death indicates a continuing interest in his philosophy, however. Recent excavation and investigation\nare thought to show that the villa was built in one major construction effort,\nand decorative elements there date it to around 40 BCE (see Guidobaldi\nand Esposito 2010), in which case it could hardly have served as\nPhilodemus\u2019 home and workplace, and certainly not in 55 BCE, when\nCicero puts him in close association with Piso.\n",
