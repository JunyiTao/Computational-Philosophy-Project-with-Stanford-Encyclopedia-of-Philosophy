    "main_text": "Biomedicine as a Framework for Medicine + Biology || The history of biomedicine\n1.2 The history of biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine as a global institution coevolved with its characteristic\nphilosophical positions. While key elements, such as laboratory\nbiology, were present in the nineteenth century and even before,\n\u201cWorld War II is usually presented as a turning point in the\n\u2018biomedicalization\u2019 process\u201d (L\u00f6wy 2011: 117).\nThe term \u201cbiomedicine\u201d was first used between the two\nworld wars as a shorthand for some of the medical and scientific work\nbeing done on radioactive materials (Keating & Cambrosio 2003;\nL\u00f6wy 2011: 49\u201355). But biomedicine only came into its own\nduring the period of economic and social transformation in\nindustrialized Western countries that followed World War Two:\n\n\nIn industrialized countries, the post-World War II era was also\ncharacterized by important increases in public funding for medical\nresearch, the extension of health insurance to large parts of the\npopulation (a process that, in nearly all the Western countries, the\nUnited States excepted, was also supported by the state), and the\nrapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry. (L\u00f6wy 2011: 117)\n\n\nIf biomedicine is a recent historical development, then what exactly\ncame before it? Many different frameworks for health existed before\nthe rise of biomedicine, though many such frameworks exist now despite\nthe dominance of biomedicine. Some have been distinctly influenced by\nor merged with biomedicine. For instance, osteopathic medicine has\ngradually gone from a full alternative system of medicine (focusing on\nmanipulation of body via pressure, stretching and other means of\nreadjustment of bodily structure in order to rebalance internal\nprocesses), to an alternative track of medical education/practice that\nhas in large part converged with the biomedical/allopathic medicine\ntrack (McClain 2017; Stark 2013).\n\nInsofar as biomedicine formed in the West, it is helpful to see it in\ncontrast to the medical and philosophical traditions that preceded it.\nThe most influential Western tradition prior to biomedicine is the Hippocratic tradition\u2014the views attributed\nto Hippocrates and over two millennia of re-interpretations, riffs,\namendments, and other alterations. At the core of Hippocratic medicine\nwere two views. First, it made a commitment to methodological\nnaturalism\u2014a refusal to attribute disease processes to the work\nof gods and other supernatural beings (Conrad, Neve, Nutton, Porter,\n& Wear 1995). Though, it is worth noting that for much of that\nhistory, elements of astrology, talismans, and some forms of magic\nwere understood as essentially natural phenomena (e.g., the sun\nobviously affects health via sunburns and such, so it is not absurd to\nhave inferred that planets could have their own subtle effects on\nbodies too). Second, it understood health as a matter of\nbalance\u2014and disease as a matter of imbalance\u2014of the\nhumors. Humoral theory was interpreted in many different ways, but\ncentered on the idea that heath and disease are attributable to the\ninteractions of anatomical humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and\nblack bile), which were in turn directly tied to a much larger\ncosmology of the elements (e.g., blood is linked to air, the\nspringtime, a combination of heat and moisture, the heart, and the\nastrological influence of the planet Jupiter) (see additional internet\nresources below) (Conrad et al., 1995).\n\nThere is long-standing debate in health policy over exactly how\nsuccessful the biomedical model has been over its relatively short\nhistorical trajectory. The growth of the biomedical model in Western\ncountries occurred at the same time as other social and economic\ntransformations (industrialization, urbanization, globalization, etc.)\nand at the same time as improvements in life expectancy and a large\nnumber of disease outcomes. The \u2018received view\u2019 of these\nhistorical relations is that social and economic changes allowed the\ngrowth of biomedicine, which in turn created new institutions,\nprofessional health care practices, and technologies that, in turn,\ncaused vast improvements in health outcomes for the populations served\nby biomedical institutions. Penicillin is the go-to example for\nillustrating the positive health impacts of biomedicine (L\u00f6wy\n2011). It is a medicine extracted from nature (mold), made into a\nwidely available \u2018magic bullet\u2019 thanks to biomedical\ntechniques of identifying its active components, and manufacturing\ncontrolled doses of it at reasonable cost at massive scale. Suffering\nand death from bacterial infections was rapidly alleviated; once\nhopeless diseases were suddenly curable with a few (usually) benign pills.\n\nThomas McKeown was an influential critic of the biomedical institution\n(including the work done during its early twentieth century\nprehistory), having authored the blockbuster volume The Role of\nMedicine: Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis (1976). McKeown reevaluated\nthe historical record and available evidence to instead hypothesize\nthat the social and economic changes in the West were more responsible\nfor the health improvements than biomedicine\u2019s growth. Put\nbluntly, he argued that twentieth century modernity (economic development, improved nutrition, etc.) caused\npopulations in the West to get healthier over time, then modernity went on to also cause the growth of\ncontemporary medicine/biomedicine, but the medical advances themselves played a generally secondary role in\nsupporting the health improvements. His works has inspired decades\nworth of debates over the validity of his bold claims, which have been\nlargely overturned or largely vindicated, depending on whom one asks\n(Link & Phelan 2002).\n\nHealth theorist Nancy Krieger shows how the activity of finding ratios\nof how much biomedical healthcare vs. socioeconomic environment\ncontributed to health improvements since the twentieth century is the\nsort of debate that easily falls victim to the \u201cfallacy of\ntreating causes of population health as if they sum to 100%\u201d\n(Krieger 2017). Causes overlap and interact in complex ways; e.g.,\nindividual diet, exercise, medications, and changing exposures to\nsmoking, etc. have all been contributing to changes in heart disease\nrates. How much of the credit goes to biomedicine for studying the\neffects of exercise on heart attack risk, for helping make the case\nfor the heart risks of smoking, and so on? Extracting and assessing\nthe contributions of biomedicine, an enterprise fully embedded in\nWestern countries\u2019 social systems and economies, is not\npossible; biomedicine is firmly embedded. That is not to deny it is\nimpossible to attribute health effects in particular populations to\nparticular causes in general\u2014there are methods allowing such\ncalculations\u2014just that causes\u2019 interactions need to be\ntaken into consideration (Krieger 2017).\n",
