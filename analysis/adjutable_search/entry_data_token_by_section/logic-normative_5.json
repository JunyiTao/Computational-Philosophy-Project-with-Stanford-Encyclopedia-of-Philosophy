According to them, the normative force\nof logic does not merely constrain reasoning, it applies to all\nthinking. The thesis deserves our attention both because of its\nhistorical interest\u2014it has been attributed in various ways to\nKant, Frege and\n Carnap[6]\u2014and\n because of its connections to contemporary views in epistemology and\nthe philosophy of mind (see Cherniak 1986: \u00a72.5; Goldman 1986:\nCh. 13; Milne 2009; as well as the references below).\n\nTo get a better handle on the thesis in question, let us agree to\nunderstand \u201cthought\u201d broadly as conceptual\n activity.[7]\n Judging, believing, inferring, for example, are all instances of\nthinking in this sense. It may seem puzzling at first how logic is to\nget a normative grip on thinking: Why merely by engaging in\nconceptual activity should one automatically be answerable to the\nstrictures of\n logic?[8]\n After all, at least on the picture of thought we are currently\nconsidering, any disconnected stream-of-consciousness of imaginings\nqualifies as thinking. One answer is that logic is thought to put\nforth norms that are constitutive for thinking. That is, in order for\na mental episode to count as an episode of thinking at all, it must,\nin a sense to be made precise, be \u201cassessable in light of the\nlaws of logic\u201d (MacFarlane 2002: 37). Underlying this thesis is\na distinction between two types of rules or norms: constitutive ones\nand regulative ones.\n\nThe distinction between regulative and constitutive norms is Kantian\nat root (KRV A179/B222). Here, however, I refer primarily to a related\ndistinction due to John Searle. According to Searle, regulative norms\n\u201cregulate antecedently or independently existing forms of\nbehavior\u201d, such as rules of etiquette or traffic laws.\nConstitutive norms, by contrast\n\n\ncreate or define new forms of behavior. The rules of football or\nchess, for example, do not merely regulate playing football or chess\nbut as it were they create the very possibility of playing such games.\n(Searle 1969: 33\u201334; see also Searle 2010: 97)\n\n\nTake the case of traffic\n rules.[9]\n While I ought to abide by traffic rules in normal circumstances, I\ncan choose to ignore them. Of course, rowdy driving in violation of\nthe traffic code might well get me in trouble. Yet no matter how\ncavalier my attitude towards traffic laws is, my activity still counts\nas driving. Contrast this with the rules governing the game of chess.\nI cannot in the same way opt out of conforming to the rules of chess\nwhile continuing to count as playing chess; in systematically\nviolating the rules of chess and persisting in doing so even in the\nface of criticism, I forfeit my right to count as partaking in the\nactivity of playing chess. Unless one\u2019s moves are appropriately\nassessable in light of the rules of chess, one\u2019s activity\ndoes not qualify as playing chess.\n\nAccording to the constitutive conception of logic\u2019s normativity\nthe principles of logic are to thought what the rules of chess are to\nthe game of chess: I cannot persistently fail to acknowledge that the\nlaws of logic set standards of correctness for my thinking without\nthereby jeopardizing my status as a thinker (i.e., someone presently\nengaged in the act of thinking).\n\nTwo important clarifications are in order. For one, on its most\nplausible reading, the thesis of the constitutive normativity of logic\nfor thought must be understood so as to leave room for the possibility\nof logical error: an agent\u2019s mental activity may continue to\ncount as thinking, despite his committing logical\n blunders.[10]\n\n\nThat is, although one may at times (perhaps even frequently and\nsystematically) stray from the path prescribed by logic in one\u2019s\nthinking, one nevertheless counts as a thinker provided one\nappropriately acknowledges logic\u2019s normative authority over\none\u2019s thinking. Consider again the game of chess. In violating\nthe rules of chess, deliberately or out of ignorance, I can plausibly\nstill be said to count as playing chess, so long, at least, as I\nacknowledge that my activity is answerable to the rules; for example,\nby being disposed to correct myself when an illegal move is brought to\nmy\n attention.[11]\n Similarly, all that is necessary to count as a thinker is to be\nsensitive to the fact that my practice of judging, inferring,\nbelieving, etc., is normatively constrained by the laws of logic. It\nis not easy to specify, in any detail, what the requisite\nacknowledgment or sensitivity consists in. A reasonable starting\npoint, however, is provided by William Taschek who, in his\ninterpretation of Frege, proposes that acknowledging\n\n\nthe categorical authority of logic will involve one\u2019s possessing\na capacity to recognize\u2014when being sincere and reflective, and\npossibly with appropriate prompting\u2014logical mistakes both in\none\u2019s own judgmental and inferential practice and that of others.\n(Taschek 2008: 384)\n\n\nA second point of clarification is that the agent need not be able to\nexplicitly represent to herself the logical norms by which she is\nbound. For instance, it may be that my reasoning ought to conform to\ndisjunctive syllogism in appropriate ways. I may be able to display\nthe right kind of sensitivity to the principle by which I am bound\n(with the right prompting if need be), without my having to possess\nthe conceptual resources to entertain the metalogical proposition that\n\\(\\neg A, A\\lor B \\models B\\). Nor must I otherwise explicitly\nrepresent that proposition and the normative constraint to which it\ngives rise.\n\nWith these clarifications in place, let us turn to a central\npresupposition of the approach I have been sketching. What is being\npresupposed, of course, is a conception of thinking that does not\nreduce to brute psychological or neurophysiological processes or\nevents. If this naturalistic level of description were the only one\navailable, the constitutive account of the normativity of logic would\nbe a non-starter. What is being presupposed, therefore, is the\npermissibility of irreducibly normative levels of descriptions of our\nmental lives. In particular, it is assumed that the boundary between\nthe kinds of mental activity that constitute thinking and other kinds\nof mental activity (non-conceptual activity like being in pain, for\ninstance) is a boundary best characterizable in normative terms. This\nis not to deny that much can be learned about mental phenomena through\ndescriptions that operate at different, non-normative levels\u2014the\n\u201csymbolic\u201d or the neurological level of description,\nsay\u2014the claim is merely that if we are interested in demarcating\nconceptual activity from other types of mental phenomena, we should\nlook to the constitutive norms governing it. Davidson (1980, 1984),\nDennett (1987), and Millar (2004) all hold views according to which\nhaving concepts and hence thinking requires that the agent be\ninterpretable as at least minimally sensitive to logical norms. Also,\ncertain contemporary \u201cnormativist approaches\u201d according to which\naccounts of certain intentional states involve ineliminable appeals to\nnormative concepts may advocate the constitutive conception of logic\u2019s normativity\n(e.g., Wedgwood 2007, 2009; Zangwill 2005).\n",
