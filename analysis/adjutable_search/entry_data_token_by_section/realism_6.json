Views Opposing the Independence Dimension (II): More Forms of Anti-Realism\n\nSuppose that one wished to develop a non-realist alternative to, say,\nmoral realism. Suppose also that one is persuaded of the\nunattractiveness of both error-theoretic and expressivist forms of\nnon-realism. That is to say, one accepts that moral sentences are\ntruth-apt, and, at least in some cases, true. Then the only option\navailable would be to deny the independence dimension of moral\nrealism. But so far we have only seen one way of doing this: by\nadmitting that the relevant sentences are truth-apt, sometimes true,\nand possessed of truth-conditions which are not potentially\nrecognition-transcendent. But this seems weak: it seems implausible to\nsuggest that a moral realist must be committed to the potential\nrecognition-transcendence of moral truth. It therefore seems\nimplausible to suggest that a non-expressivistic and\nnon-error-theoretic form of opposition to realism must be committed to\nsimply denying the potential recognition-transcendence of moral truth,\nsince many who style themselves moral realists will deny this too. As\nWright puts it:\n\nThere are, no doubt, kinds of moral realism which do have the\nconsequence that moral reality may transcend all possibility of\ndetection. But it is surely not essential to any view worth regarding\nas realist about morals that it incorporate a commitment to that idea.\n(1992: 9)\n\n\nSo, if the debate between a realist and a non-realist about the\nindependence dimension doesn\u2019t concern the plausibility of\nsemantic realism as characterised by Dummett, what does it concern?\n(Henceforth a non-error-theoretic, non-expressivist style of\nnon-realist is referred to as an anti-realist). Wright attempts to\ndevelop some points of contention, (or \u2018realism-relevant\ncruces\u2019 as he calls them) over which a realist and anti-realist\ncould disagree. Wright\u2019s development of this idea is subtle and\nsophisticated and only a crude exposition of a couple of his\nrealism-relevant cruces can be given here.\n\nThe first of Wright\u2019s realism-relevant cruces to be considered\nhere concerns the capacity of states of affairs to figure ineliminably\nin the explanation of features of our experience. The idea that the\nexplanatory efficacy of the states of affairs in some area has\nsomething to do with the plausibility of a realist view of that area\nis familiar from the debates in meta-ethics between philosophers such\nas Nicholas Sturgeon (1988), who believe that irreducibly moral states\nof affairs do figure ineliminably in the best explanation of certain\naspects of experience, and opponents such as Gilbert Harman (1977),\nwho believe that moral states of affairs have no such explanatory\nrole. This suggests a \u2018best explanation test\u2019 which,\ncrudely put, states that realism about a subject matter can be secured\nif its distinctive states of affairs figure ineliminably in the best\nexplanation of aspects of experience. One could then be a\nnon-expressivist, non-error-theoretic, anti-realist about a particular\nsubject matter by denying that the distinctive states of affairs of\nthat subject matter do have a genuine role in best explanations of\naspects of our experience. And the debate between this style of\nanti-realist and his realist opponent could proceed independently of\nany questions concerning the capacity of sentences in the relevant\narea to have potentially recognition-transcendent truth values.\n\nFor reasons that needn\u2019t detain us here, Wright suggests that\nthis \u2018best explanation test\u2019 should be superseded by\nquestions concerning what he calls width of cosmological role\n(1992, Ch.5). The states of affairs in a given area have narrow\ncosmological role if it is a priori that they do not contribute to the\nexplanation of things other than our beliefs about that\nsubject-matter (or other than via explaining our beliefs\nabout that subject matter). This will be an anti-realist position. One\nstyle of realist about that subject matter will say that its states of\naffairs have wide cosmological role: they do contribute to the\nexplanation of things other than our beliefs about the subject matter\nin question (or other than via explaining our beliefs about that\nsubject matter). It is relatively easy to see why width of\ncosmological role could be a bone of contention between realist and\nanti-realist views of a given subject matter: it is precisely the\nwidth of cosmological role of a class of states of affairs\u2014their\ncapacity to explain things other than, or other than via, our beliefs,\nin which their independence from our beliefs, linguistic practices,\nand so on, consists. Again, the debate between someone attributing a\nnarrow cosmological role to a class of states of affairs and someone\nattributing a wide cosmological role could proceed independently of\nany questions concerning the capacity of sentences in the relevant\narea to have potentially recognition-transcendent truth values.\n\nWright thinks that it is arguable that moral discourse does not\nsatisfy width-of-cosmological role. Whereas a physical fact\u2014such\nas a pond\u2019s being frozen over\u2014can contribute to the\nexplanation of cognitive effects (someone\u2019s believing\nthat the pond is frozen over), effects on sentient, but\nnon-conceptual creatures (the tendency of goldfish to cluster\ntowards the bottom of the pond), effects on us as physically\ninteractive agents (someone\u2019s slipping on the ice), and\neffects on inanimate matter (the tendency of a thermometer to\nread zero when placed on the surface), moral facts can only to\ncontribute to the explanation of the first sort of effect:\n\n[I]t is hard to think of anything which is true of sentient but\nnon-conceptual creatures, or of mobile organisms, or of inanimate\nmatter, which is true because a \u2026 moral fact obtains and in\nwhose explanation it is unnecessary to advert to anyone\u2019s\nappreciation of that moral fact (1996: 16).\n\n\nThus, we have a version of anti-realism about morals that is\nnon-expressivist and non-error-theoretic and can be framed\nindependently of considerations about the potential of moral sentences\nto have recognition-transcendent truth-values: moral sentences are\ntruth-apt, sometimes true, and moral states of affairs have narrow\ncosmological role.\n\nThe second of Wright\u2019s realism-relevant cruces concerns\njudgement-dependence. Suppose that we are considering a region of\ndiscourse D in which P is a typical property.\nConsider the opinions formed by the participants in that discourse\nunder cognitively ideal conditions: call such opinions best\nopinions, and the cognitively ideal conditions the\nC-conditions. Suppose that the best opinions covary with the\nfacts about the instantiation of P. Then there are two ways\nin which we can explain this covariance. First, we might take best\nopinions to be playing at most a tracking role: best opinions\nare just extremely good at tracking independently constituted\ntruth-conferring states of affairs. In this case, best opinion plays\nonly an extension-reflecting role, merely reflecting the\nindependently determined extensions of the relevant properties.\nAlternatively, rather than viewing best opinion as merely tracking the\nfacts about the extensions of the relevant properties, we can view\nthem as themselves determining those extensions. Best\nopinions, on this sort of view, do not just track independently\nconstituted states of affairs which determine the extensions of the\nthe properties that form the subject matter of D: rather,\nthey determine those extensions and so to play an\nextension-determining role. When we have this latter sort of\nexplanation of the covariance of best opinion and fact, we\u2019ll\nsay that the truth about the instantiation of the relevant properties\nis judgement-dependent; when we have only the former sort of\nexplanation, we\u2019ll say that the truth about their instantiation\nis judgement-independent.\n\nHow do we determine whether the truth about the instantiation of the\ntypical properties that form the subject matter of a region of\ndiscourse are judgement-dependent? Wright\u2019s discussion proceeds\nby reference to what he terms provisional equations. These\nhave the following form:\n\n(PE) \u2200x[C \u2192 (A suitable subject\ns judges that Px \u2194Px)] \n\nwhere \u2018C\u2019 denotes the conditions (the\nC-conditions) which are cognitively ideal for forming the\njudgement that x is P. The property P is\nthen said to be judgement-dependent if and only if the provisional\nequation meets the following four conditions:\n\nThe A Prioricity Condition: The provisional equation must be\na priori true: there must be a priori covariance of\nbest opinions and truth. (Justification: \u2018the truth, if it is\ntrue, that the extensions of [a class of concept] are constrained by\nidealised human response\u2014best opinion\u2014ought to be\navailable purely by analytic reflection on those concepts, and hence\navailable as knowledge a priori\u2019 (Wright 1992: 117)).\nThis is because the thesis of judgement-dependence is the claim that,\nfor the region of discourse concerned, best opinion is the\nconceptual ground of truth).\n\nThe Substantiality Condition The C-conditions must\nbe specifiable non-trivially: they cannot simply be described\nas conditions under which the subject has \u2018whatever it\ntakes\u2019 to form the right opinion concerning the subject matter\nat hand.(Justification: without this condition, the truth about any\nproperty will turn out to be judgement-dependent, since for any\nproperty Q it is going to be an a priori truth that\nour judgements about whether x is Q, formed under\nconditions which have \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to ensure their\ncorrectness, will covary with the facts about the instantiation of\nQ-ness. We thus require this condition on pain of losing the\ndistinction between judgement-dependent and judgement-independent\ntruth altogether).\n\nThe Independence Condition: The question as to whether the\nC-conditions obtain in a given instance must be logically\nindependent of the class of truths for which we are attempting to give\nan extension-determining account: what makes an opinion best must not\npresuppose some logically prior determination of the extensions\nputatively determined by best opinions. (Justification: if we have to\nassume certain facts about the extension of P in the\ndetermination of the conditions under which opinions about P\nare best, then we cannot view best opinions as themselves constituting\nthose facts, since whether a given opinion is best would then\npresuppose some logically prior determination of the very\nfacts the judgement-dependent account wishes to view as constituted by\nbest opinions).\n\nThe Extremal Condition: There must be no better way of\naccounting for the a priori covariance: no better account,\nother than according best opinion an extension-determining role, of\nwhich the satisfaction of the foregoing three conditions is a\nconsequence. (Justification: without this condition, the satisfaction\nof the foregoing conditions would be consistent with the thought that\ncertain states of affairs are judgement-independent even though\ninfallibly detectable, \u201cstates of affairs in whose determination\nfacts about the deliverances of best opinions are in no way implicated\nalthough there is, a priori, no possibility of their\nmisrepresentation\u201d (Wright 1992: 123).)\n\nWhen all of the above conditions can be shown to be satisfied, we can\naccord best opinion an extension-determining role, and describe the\ntruth about the subject matter as judgement-dependent. If these\nconditions cannot collectively be satisfied, best opinion can be\nassigned, at best, a merely extension-reflecting role.\n\nTwo points are worth making. First, it is again relatively easy to see\nwhy the question of judgement-dependence can mark a bone of contention\nbetween realism and anti-realism. If a subject matter is\njudgement-dependent we have a concrete sense in which the independence\ndimension of realism fails for that subject matter: there is a sense\nin which that subject matter is not entirely independent of our\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, and so on. Second, the debate about the\njudgement-dependence of a subject matter is, on the face of it at\nleast, independent of the debate about the possibility of\nrecognition-transcendent truth in that area.\n\nWright argues (1989) that facts about colours and intentions are\njudgement-dependent, so that we can formulate a version of\nanti-realism about colours (intentions) that views ascriptions of\ncolours (intentions) as truth-apt and sometimes true, and truth in\nthose areas as judgement-dependent. In contrast to this, Wright argues\n(1988) that morals cannot plausibly be viewed as judgement-dependent,\nso that a thesis of judgement-dependence is not a suitable vehicle for\nthe expression of a non-expressivistic, non-error-theoretic, version\nof anti-realism about morality. \n\nFor discussion of further allegedly realism-relevant cruces, such as\ncognitive command, see Wright 1992 and 2003. For critical discussion\nof Wright on cognitive command, see Shapiro and Taschek 1996. See also\nMiller 2004 and the papers in section III of Coliva (ed.) 2012.It is\nthe availability of these various realism-relevant cruces that makes\nit possible to be more-or-less realist about a given area: at one end\nof the spectrum there will be areas that fall on the realist side of\nall of the cruces and at the opposite end areas that fall on the\nnon-realist side of all of the cruces, but in between there will be a\nrange of intermediate cases in which some-but-not-all of the cruces\nare satisfied on the realist side. \n",
