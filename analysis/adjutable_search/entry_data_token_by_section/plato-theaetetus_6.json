This proposal is immediately equated by\nSocrates with Protagoras\u2019s thesis that \u201cman is the measure of\nall things\u201d (Hm for homomensura),\nwhich in turn entails the thesis that things are to any human just as\nthey appear to that human (PS for phenomenal\nsubjectivism). Socrates then adds that, in its turn,\nPS entails Heracleitus\u2019 view that \u201cAll is\nflux,\u201d that there are no stably existing objects with\nstably enduring qualities.\n\n\nThe first of these deft exchanges struck the Anonymous Commentator as\ndisingenuous: \u201cPlato himself knew that Protagoras\u2019 opinion about\nknowledge was not the same as Theaetetus\u2019\u201d (Anon, ad\nloc.). Certainly it is easy to see counter-examples to the\nalleged entailment. Take, for instance, the thesis that knowledge is\nawareness (which is often the right way to translate\naisth\u00easis). Or take the thesis that to know is to\nperceive things as God, or the Ideal Observer, perceives them, and\nthat we fail to know (or to perceive) just insofar as our opinions are\nother than God\u2019s or the Ideal Observer\u2019s. These theses are both\nversions of D1. Neither entails Hm,\nthe claim that \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d; nor the\nProtagoreanism that lies behind that slogan.\n\n\nSo how, if at all, does D1 entail all the things\nthat Socrates apparently makes it entail in 151\u2013184? And does Plato\nthink it has all these entailments? Evidently the answer to that\ndepends on how we understand D1. In particular, it\ndepends on the meaning of the word aisth\u00easis,\n\u201cperception,\u201d in D1. If the slogan\n\u201cKnowledge is perception\u201d equates knowledge with what ordinary\nspeakers of classical Greek would have meant by\naisth\u00easis, then D1 does not entail\nProtagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019 views. In the ordinary sense of\naisth\u00easis, there are (as just pointed out) too many\nother possible ways of spelling out D1 for the move\nfrom D1 to Hm to be logically\nobligatory. But if the slogan \u201cKnowledge is perception\u201d equates\nknowledge with what Protagoras and Heracleitus meant by\naisth\u00easis, D1 does entail\nProtagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019 views. Of course it does; for then\nD1 simply says that knowledge is just what Protagoras\nand Heracleitus say knowledge is.\n",
