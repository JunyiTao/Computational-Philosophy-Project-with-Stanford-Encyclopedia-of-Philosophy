The Communication Loophole, and its remedy\n\nThe derivations of all the variants of Bell\u2019s Inequality depend\nupon independence conditions inspired by relativistic causality. In\nthe early tests of Bell\u2019s Inequalities it was plausible that\nthese conditions were satisfied just because the 1 and the 2 arms of\nexperiment were spatially well separated in the laboratory frame of\nreference. This satisfaction, however, is a mere contingency not\nguaranteed by any law of physics, and hence it is physically possible\nthat the setting of the analyzer of 1 and its detection or\nnon-detection could influence the outcome of analysis and the\ndetection or non-detection of 2, and conversely. This is the\ncommunication loophole, to which the early Bell tests were\nsusceptible. It is addressed by ensuring that the experiments on the\ntwo systems take place at spacelike separation. \n\nAspect, Dalibard, and Roger (1982) published the results of an\nexperiment in which the choices of the orientations of the analyzers\nof photons 1 and 2 were performed so rapidly that they were events\nwith space-like separation. No physical modification was made of the\nanalyzers themselves. Instead, switches consisting of vials of water\nin which standing waves were excited ultrasonically were placed in the\npaths of the photons 1 and 2. When the wave is switched off, the\nphoton propagates in the zeroth order of diffraction to polarization\nanalyzers respectively oriented at angles \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\nand when it is switched on the photons propagate in the first order of\ndiffraction to polarization analyzers respectively oriented at angles\n\\(a'\\) and \\(b'\\). The complete choices of\norientation require time intervals 6.7 ns and 13.37 ns respectively,\nmuch smaller than the 43 ns required for a signal to travel between\nthe switches in obedience to special relativity theory. Prima\nfacie it is reasonable that the independence conditions are\nsatisfied, and therefore that the coincidence counting rates agreeing\nwith the quantum mechanical predictions constitute a refutation of the\nBell inequality and hence of the family of theories that entail it.\nThere are, however, several imperfections in the experiment. First of\nall, the choices of orientations of the analyzers are not random, but\nare governed by quasiperiodic establishment and removal of the\nstanding acoustical waves in each switch. A scenario can be invented\naccording to which clever hidden variables of each analyzer can\ninductively infer the choice made by the switch controlling the other\nanalyzer and adjust accordingly its decision to transmit or to block\nan incident photon. Also, coincident count technology is employed for\ndetecting joint transmission of 1 and 2 through their respective\nanalyzers, and this technology establishes an electronic link which\ncould influence detection rates. And because of the finite size of the\napertures of the switches there is a spread of the angles of incidence\nabout the Bragg angles, resulting in a loss of control of the\ndirections of a non-negligible percentage of the outgoing photons.\n\nThe experiment of Tittel, Brendel, Zbinden, and Gisin (1998) did not\ndirectly address the communication loophole but threw some light\nindirectly on this question and also provided dramatic evidence\nconcerning the maintenance of entanglement between particles of a pair\nthat are well separated. Pairs of photons were generated in Geneva and\ntransmitted via cables with very small probability per unit length of\nlosing the photons to two analyzing stations in suburbs of Geneva,\nlocated 10.9 kilometers apart on a great circle. The counting rates\nagreed well with the predictions of quantum mechanics and violated the\nCHSH inequality. No precautions were taken to ensure that the choices\nof orientations of the two analyzers were events with space-like\nseparation. The great distance between the two analyzing stations\nmakes it difficult to conceive a plausible scenario for a conspiracy\nthat would violate Bell\u2019s independence conditions. Furthermore\n\u2014 and this is the feature which seems most to have captured the\nimagination of physicists \u2014 this experiment achieved much\ngreater separation of the analyzers than ever before, thereby\nproviding a test of a conjecture by Schr\u00f6dinger (1935) that\nentanglement is a property that may dwindle with spatial separation.\nMore recently, Bell\ninequality violation was demonstrated even at 144 km distance (Scheidl\net al., 2010) and, in 2017, from satellite transmission with\na 1200 km distance (Yin et al., 2017). \n\nAn experiment that came closer to closing the communication loophole\nis that of Weihs, Jennewein, Simon, Weinfurter, and Zeilinger (1998).\nThe pairs of systems used to test a Bell\u2019s Inequality are photon\npairs in the entangled polarization state\n\n\\[\\tag{24}\n\\ket{\\Psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(\\ket{H}_1 \\ket{V}_2 - \\ket{V}_1 \\ket{H}_2 \\right),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the ket \\(\\ket{H}\\) represents horizontal polarization and\n\\(\\ket{V}\\) represents vertical polarization. Each photon pair\nis produced from a photon of a laser beam by the down-conversion\nprocess in a nonlinear crystal. The momenta, and therefore the\ndirections, of the daughter photons are strictly correlated, which\nensures that a non-negligible proportion of the pairs jointly enter\nthe apertures (very small) of two optical fibers, as was also achieved\nin the experiment of Tittel et al.. The two stations to which\nthe photon pairs are delivered are 400 m apart, a distance which light\nin vacuo traverses in \\(1.3 \\mu\\)s. Each photon emerging from an optical\nfiber enters a fixed two-channel polarizer (i.e., its exit channels\nare the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray). Upstream from each\npolarizer is an electro-optic modulator, which causes a rotation of\nthe polarization of a traversing photon by an angle proportional to\nthe voltage applied to the modulator. Each modulator is controlled by\namplification from a very rapid generator, which randomly causes one\nof two rotations of the polarization of the traversing photon. An\nessential feature of the experimental arrangement is that the\ngenerators applied to photons 1 and 2 are electronically independent.\nThe rotations of the polarizations of 1 and 2 are effectively the same\nas randomly and rapidly rotating the polarizer entered by 1 between\ntwo possible orientations \\(a\\) and \\(a'\\) and the\npolarizer entered by 2 between two possible orientations \\(b\\)\nand \\(b'\\). The output from each of the two exit channels\nof each polarizer goes to a separate detector, and a \u201ctime\ntag\u201d is attached to each detected photon by means of an atomic\nclock. Coincidence counting is done after all the detections are\ncollected by comparing the time tags and retaining for the\nexperimental statistics only those pairs whose tags are sufficiently\nclose to each other to indicate a common origin in a single\ndown-conversion process. Accidental coincidences will also enter, but\nthese are calculated to be relatively infrequent. This procedure of\ncoincidence counting eliminates the electronic connection between the\ndetector of 1 and the detector of 2 while detection is taking place,\nwhich conceivably could cause an error-generating transfer of\ninformation between the two stations. The total time for all the\nelectronic and optical processes in the path of each photon, including\nthe random generator, the electro-optic modulator, and the detector,\nis conservatively calculated to be smaller than 100 ns, which is much\nless than the \\(1.3 \\mu\\)s required for a light signal between the two\nstations.\n\nThe experimental result in the experiment of Weihs et al. is\n\\(2.73 \\pm 0.02,\\) in good agreement with the quantum mechanical\nprediction, and it is 30 standard deviations away from the upper limit\nof the CHSH inequality inequality (8). Aspect, who designed the first\nexperimental test of a Bell Inequality with rapidly switched analyzers\n(Aspect, Dalibard, Roger 1982) appreciatively summarized the import of\nthis result:\n\nI suggest we take the point of view of an external observer, who\ncollects the data from the two distant stations at the end of the\nexperiment, and compares the two series of results. This is what the\nInnsbruck team has done. Looking at the data a posteriori, they found\nthat the correlation immediately changed as soon as one of the\npolarizers was switched, without any delay allowing for signal\npropagation: this reflects quantum non-separability. (Aspect 1999,\n190)\n\n\nEven if some small imperfection prevented the experiment of Weihs\net al. from completely blocking the detection loophole, these\nproblems were overcome in subsequent experiments.\n5.2. The Detection Loophole and its remedy\n\nThe CHSH inequality (8) is a relation between expectation values. An\nexperimental test, therefore, requires empirical estimation of the\nprobabilities of the outcomes of experiments. This estimation involves\ncomputing a ratio of event-counts: the number of pair-production\nevents with a certain outcome to the total number of pair-production\nevents. Typically, in experiments involving photons, most of the pairs\nproduced fail to enter the analyzers. Furthermore, some photons that\nenter the analyzers will fail to be detected; in addition, the\ndetector will occasionally register a detection even when no photon is\ndetected (the rate of occurrence of this is known as the\n\u201cdark-count\u201d).\n\nThree strategies for addressing this issue have been pursued. \n\nOne is to employ an auxiliary assumption to yield an estimate of the\nnormalization factor required to infer relative frequencies from\nevent-counts, as required by a test of the CHSH inequality. CHSH\n(1969) proposed the assumption that, if a photon passes through an\nanalyser, its probability of detection is independent of the\nanalyser\u2019s orientation. Though physically plausible, this is not\na condition required by local causality.\n\nThe fact that an assumption of this sort is needed for the analysis of\nexperiments of this type was made clear by toy models constructed by\nPearle (1970) and Clauser and Horne (1974). In these models, the rates\nat which the photon pairs pass through the polarization analyzers with\nvarious orientations are consistent with an inequality of Bell\u2019s\ntype, but the hidden variables provide instructions to the photons and\nthe apparatus not only regarding passage through the analyzers but\nalso regarding detection, thereby violating the fair sampling\nassumption. Detection or non-detection is selective in the model in\nsuch a way that the detection rates violate the Bell-type inequality\nand agree with the quantum mechanical predictions. Other models were\nconstructed later by Fine (1982a) and corrected by Maudlin (1994) (the\n\u201cPrism Model\u201d) and by C.H. Thompson (1996) (the\n\u201cChaotic Ball model\u201d). Although all these models are\nad hoc and lack physical plausibility, they constitute\nexistence proofs that theories satisfying the local causality\ncondition can be consistent with the quantum mechanical predictions\nprovided that the detectors are properly selective.\n\nA second strategy involves construction of an experimental set-up in\nwhich the production of each particle-pair may be registered. Clauser\nand Shimony (1978) referred to apparatus achieving this as\n\u201cevent-ready\u201d detectors; some recent literature has\nreferred to a process of this sort as \u201cheralding.\u201d\n\nA third strategy involves employment of an inequality that can be\nshown to be violated without knowledge of the absolute value of the\nprobabilities involved. This eliminates the need for untestable\nauxiliary assumptions. An inequality suitable for this purpose was\nfirst derived by Clauser and Horne (1974) (henceforth CH). The set-up\nis as before, with the exception that each analyzer will have only one\noutput channel, and the eventualities to be considered are detection\nand non-detection. We want an inequality expressed in terms of\nprobabilities of detection alone. The same sort of reasoning that\nleads to the CHSH inequality yields the CH Inequality:\n\n\\[\\tag{25}\n- 1 \\le p_{a,b}(+, +) + p_{a,b'}(+, +) + p_{a',b}(+, +) - p_{a',b'}(+, +) - p^1_a(+) - p^2_b(+) \n    \\le 0. \n\\]\n\n\nThe probabilities appearing in (25) can be estimated by dividing\nevent-counts registered in a run of an experiment by the total number\nof pairs produced. If we assume that the production rate at the source\nis independent of the analyzer settings, we can take the normalization\nfactor to be the same for each term, and hence, the magnitude of this\nfactor need not be known in order to demonstrate a violation of the\nupper bound of (25). Another useful observation was made by Eberhard\n(1993), who demonstrated that the minimal detection efficiency for a\ndetection loophole free experiment can be reduced (from 82% to 67%)\nfor non-maximally entangled states (i.e. a bipartite entangled state\nwith different weight for the two components). This involves starting\nwith a specified efficiency level, and then choosing a state and a set\nof observables that maximize violation of the CH inequality at that\nefficiency level.\n\nFor the maximally entangled states we have been considering, in the\nidealized case of perfect detection efficiency, inequality (25) is\nmaximally violated by the quantum predictions for the same settings\nconsidered above for violation of the CHSH inequality. However, for\nnon-ideal experiments, the quantum predictions satisfy the inequality\nunless detector efficiency is high, considerably higher than that of\nany experiment that had been performed up until the time that CH were\nwriting. For that reason, CH introduced a new auxiliary assumption,\ncalled the no-enhancement assumption: for any value of\n\\(\\lambda\\), and any setting of an analyzer, the probability of\ndetection with the analyzer present is no higher than the probability\nof detection with the analyzer removed. Let \\(p^1_{\\infty}\\) and\n\\(p^2_{\\infty}\\) be the probabilities of detection of particles 1 and\n2 when their respective analyzers have been removed. This assumption\ngives rise to what may be called the second CH\ninequality:\n\n\\[\\tag{26}\n- 1 \\le p_{a,b}(+, +) + p_{a,b'}(+, +) + p_{a',b}(+, +) - p_{a',b'}(+, +) \\le p^1_{\\infty} + p^2_{\\infty}.\n\\]\n\n\nAs CH note, this is violated by the results of the Freedman and\nClauser experiment, and hence that experiment rules out theories\nsatisfying the factorizability condition (F) and the no-enhancement\nassumption, though it does not rule out the toy model constructed by\nCH.\n\nHistorically, the efforts toward a detection loophole-free experiment\nfollowed two main paths, though a few other possibilities were also\nexplored. One of these other possibilities involved K,B mesons\n(Selleri 1983, Go 2004), where the detection loophole reappears in\nanother form (Genovese, Novero, and Predazzi 2001); and another\ninvolved solid state systems (Ansmann et al. 2009).\n\nOne of the main avenues of approach employed entangled ions. The use\nof ions looked very promising, since for such experiments detection\nefficiency is very high. The experiment of Rowe et al. (2001)\nemployed beryllium ions, observing a CHSH inequality violation \\(S =\n2.25 \\pm 0.03\\) with a total detection efficiency of about 98%.\nNevertheless, in this set-up the measurements on two ions not only\nwere not space-like separated; there was a common measurement on the\ntwo ions. More recently, the distance between ions was increased. For\ninstance, Matsukevich et al. (2008) entangled two ytterbium\nions via interference and joint detection of two emitted photons, with\nthe distance between the ions set to 1 meter. However, a conclusive\nexperiment of this sort that eliminated also the communication\nloophole would require a separation of kilometers.\n\nThe other main avenue of approach, which paved the way to a conclusive\ntest of Bell inequalities, involved innovations in tests using\nphotons. First, efficient sources of photon entangled states were\nrealized by exploiting Parametric Down Conversion, a non-linear\noptical phenomenon in which a photon of higher energy converts into\ntwo lower frequency photons inside a non-linear medium in such a way\nthat energy and momentum are conserved. This allows a high collection\nefficiency due to wave vector correlation of the emitted photons.\nNext, high efficiency single photon Transition Edge Sensors were\nproduced. These advances led to detection loophole-free experiments\nwith photons (Giustina et al. 2013, Christensen et\nal. 2013) and finally to the conclusive tests discussed in the\nnext section.\n5.3. Loophole-free tests\n\nIn 2015 three papers appeared claiming a conclusive test of Bell\ninequalities. The first (Hensen et al., 2015) achieved a\nviolation of the CHSH inequality via an event-ready scheme. This\nexperiment is based on using electronic spin associated with the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in two diamond chips located in distant\nlaboratories. In the experiment, each of these two spins is entangled\nwith the emission time of a single photon. Then the two,\nindistinguishable, photons are transmitted to a remote beam splitter.\nA measurement is made on the photons after the beam splitter. An\nappropriate result of the measurement of the photons projects the\nspins in the two diamond chips onto a maximally entangled state, on\nwhich a Bell inequality test is realized. The high efficiency in spin\nmeasurement and the distance between the laboratories allows closure\nof the detection and communication loophole at the same time. However,\nthe experiment utilized only a small number, 245, of trials, and thus\nthe statistical significance (2 standard deviations) of the result\n\\(S = 2.42 \\pm 0.20\\) is limited.\n\nThe other two experiments, published in the same issue of Physical\nReview Letters (Giustina et al. 2015, Shalm et\nal. 2015), are based on transmitting two polarization-entangled\nphotons, produced by Parametric Down Conversion, to two remote\nlaboratories, where they are measured by high detection efficiency\nTransition Edge Sensors. These experiments use states that are not\nmaximally entangled, but are optimized, in accordance with the\nanalysis of Eberhard (1993), to produce a maximal violation of the CH\ninequality, given the detection efficiency of the experiments. In both\nof these experiments a violation of the CH inequality was obtained, at\na high degree of statistical significance. Shalm et al.\nreport a \\(p\\)-value of \\(2.3 \\times 10^{-7}\\), whereas\nGiustina et al. report a \\(p\\)-value of \\(3.4 \\times\n10^{-31}\\), corresponding to an 11.5 standard deviation effect. A very\ncareful analysis of data (including spacelike separation of detection\nevents), of statistical significance, and of all possible loopholes\nleaves really no space for doubts about their conclusiveness. Besides\nthe detection and communication loophole, these two experiments\naddress also the following issues:\n\nThe number of emitted particles must be independent of measurement\nsettings (production rate loophole). This was excluded by an\nabsolutely random choice of settings.\nThe presence of a coincidence window must not allow in a hidden\nvariable scheme a situation where local setting may change the time at\nwhich the local event happens (coincidence loophole). This was\nexcluded by using a pulsed source.\nAn eventual memory of previous measurements must be considered in\nthe statistical analysis since the data might not be independently and\nidentically distributed (memory loophole). This is excluded by a\ncareful analysis of data.\n\n\nFurthermore, independent random number generators based on laser phase\ndiffusion guarantee the elimination of freedom-of-choice loophole\n(except in presence of superdeterminism or other hypotheses that, by\ndefinition, do not allow a test through Bell inequalities).\n\nIn summary, these experiments, having satisfied carefully all the\nconditions required for a conclusive test, unequivocally tested Bell\ninequalities without any additional hypothesis.\n6. Some Variants of Bell\u2019s Theorem\n\nThis section will discuss in some detail two variants of Bell\u2019s\nTheorem which depart in some respect from the conceptual framework\npresented in\n Section 2.\n Both are less general than the version in\n Section 2,\n because they rely on perfect correlations, which, together with the\nfactorizability condition (F), entail outcome determinism (OD). At the\nend of the section two other variants will be mentioned briefly but\nnot summarized in detail.\n\nThe first variant is due independently to\n Kochen,[8]\n Stairs (1978, 1983), and Heywood and Redhead (1983). Its ensemble of\ninterest consists of pairs of spin-1 particles in the entangled\nstate\n\n\\[\\tag{27}\n\\ket{\\Phi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\ket{z,1}_1 \\ket{z,-1}_2 - \\ket{z,0}_1 \\ket{z,0}_2 + \\ket{z,-1}_1 \\ket{z,1}_2 \\right],\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ket{z,i}_1\\), with \\(i = -1\\) or 0 or 1 is the spin state of\nparticle 1 with component of spin \\(i\\) along the axis \\(z\\), and\n\\(\\ket{z,i}_2\\) has an analogous meaning for particle 2. If \\(x,y,z\\)\nis a triple of orthogonal axes in 3-space then the components \\(s_x,\ns_y, s_z\\) of the spin operator along these axes do not pairwise\ncommute. However, the squares of these operators \u2014 \\(s_x^2,\ns_y^2, s_z^2\\) \u2014 do commute, and therefore, in view of the\nconsiderations of\n Section 1,\n any two of them can constitute a context in the measurement of the\nthird. If the operator of interest is\n\\(s_z^2\\), the axes \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) can be any pair of orthogonal axes in the plane\nperpendicular to \\(z\\), thus offering an infinite family of\ncontexts for the measurement of\n\\(s_{z}^2\\). As noted in\n Section 1\n Bell exhibited the possibility of a contextual hidden\nvariables theory for a quantum system whose Hilbert space has\ndimension 3 or greater even though the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem\nshowed the impossibility of a non-contextual hidden variables\ntheory for such a system. The strategy of the argument is to use the\nentangled state of Eq. (27) to predict the outcome of measuring\n\\(s_{z}^2\\) for particle 2 (for any choice of \\(z)\\) by measuring its\ncounterpart on particle 1. A specific complete state \\(\\lambda\\) would\ndetermine whether \\(s_{z}^2\\) of 1, measured together with a context\nin 1, is 0 or 1. Agreement with the quantum mechanical prediction of\nthe entangled state of Eq. (27) implies that \\(s_z^2\\) of 2 has the\nsame value 0 or 1. But if the factorizability condition (F) is\nassumed, then the result of measuring \\(s_{z}^2\\) on 2 must be\nindependent of the remote context, that is, independent of the choice\nof \\(s_{x}^2\\) and \\(s_y^2\\) of 1, hence of 2 because of correlation,\nfor any pair of orthogonal directions \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the plane\nperpendicular to \\(z\\). It follows that the hypothetical theory which\nsupplies the complete state \\(\\lambda\\) is not contextual after all,\nbut maps the set of operators \\(s_z^2\\) of 2, for any direction\n\\(z\\), noncontextually into the pair of values (0, 1). But\nthat is impossible in view of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. The\nconclusion is that no theory satisfying the factorizability condition\n(F) is consistent with the quantum mechanical predictions of the\nentangled state (29).\n\nA simpler proof of Bell\u2019s Theorem, also relying upon\ncounterfactual reasoning and based upon a deterministic local theory,\nis that of Hardy (1993), here presented in Lalo\u00eb\u2019s (2001)\nformulation. Consider an ensemble of pairs 1 and 2 of\nspin\\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles, the spin of 1 measured along\ndirections in the \\(xz\\)-plane making angles \\(a=\\theta /2\\) and\n\\(a'=0\\) with the \\(z\\)-axis, and angles \\(b\\) and \\(b'\\) having\nanalogous significance for 2. The quantum states for particle 1 with\nspins \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) relative to direction\n\\(a'\\) are respectively \\(\\ket{a',+}_1\\) and \\(\\ket{a',-}_1\\), and\nrelative to direction \\(a\\) are respectively\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{28a} \\ket{a,+}_1 &= \\cos\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 + \\sin\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1 \\\\\n\\tag{28b} \\ket{a,-}_1 &= -\\sin\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 + \\cos\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1; \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nthe spin states for 2 are analogous. The ensemble of interest is\nprepared in the entangled quantum state\n\n\\[\\tag{29}\n\\ket{\\Psi} = {-\\cos \\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 \\ket{b',-}_2} -{\\cos\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1 \\ket{b',+}_2} + \n  {\\sin\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 \\ket{b',+}_2}\n\\]\n\n\n(unnormalized, because normalization is not needed for the following\nargument). Then for the specified \\(a, a',\nb\\), and \\(b'\\) the following quantum mechanical\npredictions hold:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{30} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a,+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b',+}_2 = 0; \\\\\n\\tag{31} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a',+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b,+}_2 = 0; \\\\\n\\tag{32} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a',-\\rangle_1 \\ket{b',-}_2 = 0;\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nand for almost all values of the \\(\\theta\\) of Eq. (31)\n\n\\[\\tag{33}\n\\langle \\Psi \\mid a,+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b,+}_2 \\ne 0,\n\\]\n\n\nwith the maximum occurring around \\(\\theta = 9\\degr\\). Inequality\n(33) asserts that for the specified angles there is a non-empty\nsubensemble \\(E'\\) of pairs for which the results for a\nspin measurement along \\(a\\) for 1 and along \\(b\\) for 2 are\nboth +. Eq. (30) implies the counterfactual proposition that if the\nspin of a 2 in \\(E'\\) had been measured along\n\\(b'\\) then with certainty the result would have been\n\\(-\\); and likewise Eq. (31) implies the counterfactual proposition\nthat if the spin of a 1 in \\(E'\\) had been measured along\n\\(a'\\) then with certainty the result would have been\n\\(-\\). It is in this step that counterfactual reasoning is used in\nthe argument. Since the subensemble \\(E'\\) is non-empty, we\nhave reached a contradiction with Eq. (32), which asserts that if the\nspin of 1 is measured along \\(a'\\) and that of 2 is\nmeasured along \\(b'\\) then it is impossible that both\nresults are \\(-\\). The incompatibility of a deterministic local\ntheory with quantum mechanics is thereby demonstrated.\n\nAn attempt was made by Stapp (1997) to demonstrate a strengthened\nversion of Bell\u2019s theorem which dispenses with the conceptual\nframework outlined above, and to use instead the logic of\ncounterfactual conditionals. His intricate argument has been the\nsubject of a criticism by Shimony and Stein (2001, 2003), who are\ncritical of certain counterfactual conditionals that are asserted by\nStapp by means of a \u201cpossible worlds\u201d analysis without a\ngrounding on a local deterministic theory, and a response by Stapp (2001)\nhimself, who defends his argument with some modifications.\n\nThe three variants of Bell\u2019s Theorem considered so far in this\nsection concern ensembles of pairs of particles. An entirely new\ndomain of variants is opened by studying ensembles of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of particles with \\(n \\ge 3\\). The prototype\nof this kind of theorem was demonstrated by Greenberger, Horne, and\nZeilinger (1989) (GHZ) for \\(n=4\\) and modified to \\(n=3\\)\nby Mermin (1990) and by Greenberger, Horne, Shimony, and Zeilinger\n(1990) (GHSZ). In the theorem of GHZ an entangled quantum state was\nwritten for four spin-\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles and the expectation value of\nthe product of certain binary measurements performed on the individual\nparticles was calculated. They then showed that the attempt to\nduplicate this expectation value subject to the factorizability\nconstraint (F) produces a contradiction. A similar result was obtained\nby Mermin for a state of 3 spin-\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles and by GHSZ for a\nstate of 3 photons entangled with respect to their direction of\npropagation. Because of the length of these arguments and limitations\nof space in the present article the details will not be summarized\nhere, it is however worth mentioning that experimental tests were\nrealized (Pan et al. 2000, Genovese 2005) (also in this case\nwith additional hypotheses).\n7. Significance for Quantum Information Theory\n\nThe set-up envisaged in the proof of Bell\u2019s theorem highlights a\nstriking prediction of quantum theory, namely, long-distance\nentanglement, and experimental tests of the Bell inequalities provide\nconvincing evidence that it is a feature of reality. Moreover,\nBell\u2019s theorem reveals that the entanglement-based correlations\npredicted by quantum mechanics are strikingly different from the sort\nof locally explicable correlations familiar in a classical\ncontext.\n\nInvestigations into entanglement and the ways in which it can be\nexploited to perform tasks that would not be feasible with only\nclassical resources forms a key part of the discipline of quantum\ninformation theory (see Benatti, et al. eds. (2010), and the\nentries on\n quantum computing\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n In drawing attention to the import of entanglement and the ways in\nwhich it is different from anything in classical physics, Bell\u2019s\ntheorem and the experimental work derived from it provided, at least\nindirectly, some of the impetus to the development of quantum\ninformation theory.\n\nBell\u2019s theorem has played a direct role in the development of\ndevice independent quantum cryptography. One can exploit quantum\ncorrelations to devise a quantum key distribution protocol that is\nprovably secure on the assumption that, whatever the underlying\nphysics is, it does not permit superluminal signalling. The basic idea\nis that, if one has Bell inequality-violating correlations at\nspacelike separation, any predictability of the results beyond that\nafforded by the quantum probabilities could be exploited for\nsuperluminal signalling; the contrapositive of this is that impossibility of\nsignalling entails \u201cabsolute randomness\u201d \u2014 absolute\nin the sense of being independent of the details of the underlying\nphysics beyond the prohibition on superluminal\n signalling.[9]\n\n\nThe experiments demonstrating loophole-free violations of Bell\ninequalities take on particular significance in this context. The toy\nmodels demonstrating the reality of the detector inefficiency loophole\nlack physical plausibility, and, in the absence of conspiracies aimed\nat deceiving the experimenters, may be disregarded on the assumption\nthat nature, though subtle, is not malicious. Cryptography, on the\nother hand, by its very nature must take into account the possibility\nof a conspiracy aimed at deceiving the users of a cryptographic key,\nand so, in this context, it is essential to demonstrate security in\nthe presence of such a conspiracy. \n\nA result due to Colbeck and Renner (2011, 2016), building on work of\nBranciard et al. (2008), shows that this cannot be done if PI\nis satisfied. This result has significance both at the operational and\nthe fundamental level. It can be applied at the fundamental level to\nconclude that any theory with sharper probabilities than the quantum\npredictions must violate PI. In addition, even if some deterministic\ntheory (such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory) applies at the fundamental\nlevel, the Colbeck-Renner theorem can be applied at the operational\nlevel, where the probabilities involved may indicate limitations on\naccessible information about the physical state. A violation of PI at\nthe operational level would permit signalling. Thus, the theorem shows\nthat, as long as the no-signalling condition is satisfied, a would-be\neavesdropper attempting to subvert the privacy of a key distribution\nscheme by intercepting the particle pairs and substituting ones that\nwill yield results that she has some information about, cannot do so\nwithout disrupting the correlations between the particle pairs. See\nLeegwater (2016) for a clear exposition of the theorem.\n8. Philosophical/metaphysical implications\n\nBell inequalities follow from a number of assumptions that have\nintuitive plausibility and which, arguably, are rooted in the sort of\nworld-view that results from reflection on classical physics and\nrelativity theory. If one accepts that the experimental evidence gives\nus strong reason to believe that Bell inequality-violating\ncorrelations are features of physical reality, then one or more of\nthese assumptions must be given up. Some of these assumptions are of\nthe sort that have traditionally been regarded as metaphysical\nassumptions. The fact that a conjunction of theses of the sort usually\nregarded as metaphysical has consequences that can be subjected to\nexperimental test has led Shimony to speak\nof the enterprise of experimental testing for violations of Bell\ninequalities as \u201cexperimental metaphysics\u201d (Shimony 1984a, 35; 1993, 115). As may be\nexpected, the conclusions of experimental metaphysics are not\nunambiguous. Some prima facie plausible options are excluded,\nleaving a number of options open. In this section these are briefly\noutlined, with no attempt made to adjudicate between them.\n8.1. Options left open by experimental violation of Bell Inequalities\n\nSuppose that one accepts that the experimental evidence indicates that\nBell-inequality violating correlations are a real feature of the\nworld, even when the experiments are conducted at spacelike\nseparation, on the most stringent of conditions that advocates of a\ncollapse locality loophole might wish to impose (see section 3.2.3).\nAcceptance of the reality of such correlations requires rejection of\nthe conjunction of any set of assumptions sufficient to entail a Bell\ninequality. The analysis of the assumptions of the proof outlined in\nsection 3 affords a taxonomy of positions that one might adopt in\nlight of their experimental violation, as at least one of the\nassumptions must be rejected. The distinctive assumption is the\nPrinciple of Local Causality, which, when applied to the setup of\nBell-type experiments, is embodied in the factorizability condition.\nThis condition can be maintained only if one of the supplementary\nassumptions is rejected. We begin with options rejecting supplementary\nassumptions.\n8.1.1. Rejecting the supplementary assumptions\n\nAs we are considering implications of accepting Bell\ninequality violations as a feature of reality, even when the\nexperiments are performed at spacelike separation, we set aside the\ncollapse locality loophole. This leaves us with two options.\n\n\n\nReject unique outcomes. This is the option taken by\nEverettian, or Many-Worlds theories, and related interpretations of\nquantum mechanics. The question arises whether locality can be\nmaintained on this option. Posing the question of whether Bell\u2019s\ntheorem has implications for locality on Everettian or relative-state\ninterpretations requires that one first consider how to formulate\nlocality conditions in such a context, as the conditions formulated in\nsection 3.1, presuppose unique experimental outcomes. See Vaidman\n(1994), Bacciagaluppi (2002), Chapter 8 of Wallace (2012), Tipler\n(2014), Vaidman (2016), Brown and Timpson (2016), and Myrvold (2016)\nfor discussions of locality in Everettian interpretations, and Smerlak\nand Rovelli (2007) for a discussion in the context of relational\ninterpretations.\n\n\nReject the measurement independence assumption. There are\nessentially two ways to do this. One is to suppose a common cause in\nthe past that determines both experimental settings and experimental\noutcomes, as in the fanciful conspiracy story concocted by Shimony,\nHolt, and Clauser (1976). This sort of account has been called\nsuperdeterminism. Another avenue was suggested by Costa de\nBeauregard (1977), in a comment on the interchange between Bell and\nShimony, Holt, and Clauser. Costa de Beauregard objected that the\ndiscussants were disregarding the possibility of retrocausality, a\npossibility that he had advanced earlier (1976). If causal influence\nfrom future to past is admitted, then, even if the settings are\nregarded as free variables, they could influence the state of the\nsystem at the moment of preparation, contravening the assumption that\nthe preparation probability distribution be independent of\nexperimental settings.\n\nSuperdeterminism has gained some advocates, most notably Gerard\n\u2019t Hooft, who makes it a feature of his Cellular Automaton\nInterpretation of quantum mechanics (\u2019t Hooft 2016). It should\nbe noted that superdeterminism is a condition that is considerably\nstronger than mere determinism. It is uncontroversial that the sort of\ndevices that Bell speaks of, which have the effect of making the\nchoice setting of an experimental parameter depend on initial\nconditions in a way that is highly sensitive to small perturbations\nand which would ordinarily be accepted as effectively randomizing the\nchoice, do exist. Superdeterminism requires these settings to be\nnonetheless determined by the conditions at some past time, in such a\nway that the settings are distributed in just the right way to produce\nthe quantum statistics in Bell-type experiments, despite the\nunderlying physics being local, no matter what randomization\nmethod is employed. For example, in the experiment of Shalm\net al. (2015), the measurement decisions were determined by\napplying an XOR (exclusive or) operation to three bits from three\nindependent sources, one of which was a pseudorandom sequence\nconstructed from digits of \\(\\pi\\) and binary strings derived\nfrom various popular culture sources, including episodes of the movies\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail, the Back to the\nFuture trilogy, and episodes of Doctor Who, Saved by\nthe Bell, and Star Trek. A hypothetical cause that\nachieved the observed statistics via correlation between states of the\nphotons studied and the choice of measurements would have had to\nprecisely orchestrate the creative processes leading up to the\ndigitized versions of these cultural artifacts in such a way that,\nwhen processed in conjunction with the outputs of the random number\ngenerators, produced just the right sequence of experimental\nchoices.\n\nNo experiment can completely rule out the logical possibility of\nconspiracies of this sort. One can, however, conduct experiments that\nguarantee independence of the settings and the state of the systems at\nthe source on the basis of plausible physical assumptions. The\nexperiment of Scheidl et al. (2010) was the first to employ\nrandom-number generators operating at spacelike separation from the\ngeneration of the particle pairs at the source. Following a suggestion\nof Clauser, other tests have employed measurements on photons from\nMilky Way stars (Handsteiner et al. 2017) and from distant\nquasars (Rauch et al. 2018). In addition, the \u201cBig Bell\nTest\u201d ran experiments utilizing inputs provided by approximately\n100,000 volunteers (Abell\u00e1n et al. 2018). \n\n8.1.2. Rejecting Local Causality\n\nIf the auxiliary assumptions are accepted, then the lesson to be\ndrawn from the experimental violation of Bell inequalities is that the\ncondition that Bell called the Principle of Local Causality\nmust be rejected. As we have seen, this condition is a conjunction of\ntwo conditions: a causal locality condition (PLC-1, above), and the\nPrinciple of the Common Cause. The causal locality condition itself\ncan be regarded as stemming from the assumption that causes temporally\nprecede their effects and Lorentz invariance of the relation of\ntemporal precedence. If the relation of temporal precedence is to be Lorentz\ninvariant, then either it is the trivial relation that holds between\nany two spacetime points, or else the past of a spacetime point is its\npast light cone (Stein 1991, 2009).\n\nIn this context, it is useful to recall that the factorizability\ncondition can be thought of as a conjunction of outcome independence\n(OI) and parameter independence (PI). PI is a consequence of causal\nlocality (PLC-1), applied to the set-up of the Bell experiments,\nwhereas OI is a consequence of causal locality and the common cause\nprinciple. This leaves us with a dilemma. A rejection of\nfactorizability involves a rejection of PI or OI. A rejection of PI\ninvolves a rejection of causal locality. If causal locality is to be\nmaintained, then OI, and hence the Common Cause Principle, must be\nrejected.\n\nAny deterministic theory must satisfy OI, and hence, a deterministic\ntheory that rejects factorizability must reject causal locality. \n\nThese considerations yield a taxonomy of options for accepting the\nsupplementary assumptions while also accepting Bell-inequality\nviolating correlations. \n\n\n\nReject PLC-1. One option is to reject the assumption PLC-1 of\ncausal locality, and accept that there are causal relations between\nevents that are outside of each others\u2019 light-cones. There are\ntwo ways to do this.\n\nIntroduce non-relativistic spatiotemporal structure. One\noption, and perhaps the most straightforward one, is to reject the\nassumption of Lorentz invariant spatiotemporal structure at the\nfundamental level. This is the position that is involved in acceptance\nof the de Broglie-Bohm theory or any similar theory. On the de\nBroglie-Bohm theory, the velocity of a particle is a function not only\nof its own location but also of the location of any other particles it\nis entangled with. This means that the dynamics of the theory requires\na privileged relation of distant simultaneity.\nRetrocausality. Another option is to maintain the\nassumption that the past of an event is its past light cone, and\nthereby maintain Lorentz invariance of the spatiotemporal structure,\nbut to deny that causes must temporally precede their effects.\nTypically, those who take this option accept retrocausality,\nmaintaining that causal processes can propagated within light cones in\neither temporal direction. This avenue of explaining Bell-type\ncorrelations was introduced by Costa de Beauregard, and has been\nadvocated by Price and Wharton (Price 1994, 1996; Price and Wharton\n2015). It forms part of the Transactional Interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Cramer 1986, 1988, 2016; Kastner 2013). \n\n\n\nReject the Principle of Common Cause. A stochastic theory,\nsuch as a dynamical collapse theory, that reproduces quantum\nprobabilities for Bell experiments, will involve correlated events at\nspacelike separation. It need not, however, involve any events in the\ncommon past of these events that screen off the correlations; these\ncorrelations will be built-in to the laws of the theory yielding\nprobabilities of events. Whether one is willing to extend talk of\ncause-effect relations to refer to the relation between such events is\nmerely a matter of terminology; it should be noted, however, that\nthere is nothing of the usual asymmetry between cause and effect in\nthe relation between these events. To accept this relation as a new\nsort of symmetric cause-effect relation removes any reason there is to\nthink that cause-effect relations between spacelike separated events\nare incompatible with relativistic spacetime structure.\n\nA more common view is that the lesson of Bell\u2019s theorem is that\nthere may be correlations that are not explicable in terms of\ncause-effect relations. This involves rejection of the Common Cause\nPrinciple (see, e.g., van Fraassen 1982, Fine 1989,\nButterfield 1992, Elby 1992). Others have maintained that, though the\nCommon Cause Principle as formulated by Reichenbach is to be rejected,\nthe principle has been formulated too narrowly, and  needs to\nbe reformulated in light of quantum phenomena. Some have suggested\nthat despite not satisfying Reichenbach\u2019s principle,\ncorrelations violating Bell inequalities are due to a common cause in\ntheir past, namely, the process that created entanglement (Unruh 2002,\n136). Hofer-Szabo, R\u00e9dei, and Szabo (1999, 2002) have suggested\na modification of the common cause principle, as have Leifer and\nSpekkens (Leifer 2006, Leifer and Spekkens 2011). See Cavalcanti and\nLal (2014) for discussion and a critique of these proposals.\n\n8.2. Quantum mechanics and relativity\n\nDoes Bell\u2019s theorem show that quantum theory is incompatible\nwith relativity? \n\nThe answer, of course, depends on what one takes relativity theory to\nrequire. It can be shown (Eberhard 1978, Ghirardi, Rimini & Weber\n1980, Page 1982) that, in the absence of nonlocal interaction terms in\nthe Hamiltonian, quantum correlations cannot be exploited to send\nsignals superluminally. There has been a tendency in some of the\nliterature to take this by itself to indicate compatibility with\nrelativity. That this is insufficient can be seen from the fact that\nthere can be theories, such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory, that\nrequire nonrelativistic spacetime structure for the formulation of\ntheir dynamical laws, while not permitting signalling (at least, as\nlong as the usual distribution postulate for particle positions is\nsatisfied). \n\nTake a relativistic spacetime structure to be a structure\nthat includes a relation of temporal precedence on which the past of a\nspacetime point is the set of points on or within its past lightcone,\nand its future, the set of points on or within its future lightcone,\nand other points are temporally unrelated to it, neither past nor\nfuture. One can ask whether a given account of the goings-on in the\nworld is compatible with a relativistic spacetime structure. If a\ntheory requires events outside of its lightcone to be partitioned into\nthose that are past, future, and simultaneous with a point, as does\nthe de-Broglie Bohm theory, it is not compatible with a relativistic\nspacetime structure. Compatibility of a theory with relativistic\nspacetime structure, in this sense, is a distinct issue from Lorentz\ncovariance of the equations expressing the theory\u2019s dynamical\nlaws. One can construct theories on which nonrelativistic\nspacetime structure is introduced dynamically, as is done by\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, M\u00fcnch-Berndl and Zangh\u00ec (1999), who\nformulate a Bohmian theory against a background of Minkowski spacetime\nby introducing an auxiliary field that picks out a distinguished\nfoliation that is then used to formulate the dynamics of the theory\n(see D\u00fcrr et al. 2014 for discussion). Berndl,\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and Zangh\u00ec (1996) consider the class of\ntrajectory theories\u2014that is, theories that, like the de\nBroglie-Bohm theory, assign definite trajectories to\nparticles\u2014and prove that such theories could not satisfy the\nBorn-rule distribution postulate along arbitrary spacelike\nhyperplanes. The argument generalizes to any theories, such as modal\ninterpretations, that assign definite values to variables other\nthan position (Dickson and Clifton 1998, Arntzenius 1998, Myrvold\n2002). Theories of this sort, therefore, must invoke a distinguished\nfoliation.\n\nA deterministic theory must satisfy the condition of outcome\nindependence, and hence if one accepts \\((a)\\) that a violation\nof PI, that is, a situation in which the choice of an experiment on\none side changes the probability of an outcome on the other, is an\ninstance of causation, and \\((b)\\) that a cause must temporally\nprecede its effect, and then it follows that a deterministic theory\nthat satisfies the supplementary conditions and reproduces the quantum\ncorrelations is incompatible with relativistic spacetime structure.\nSuch a theory may, however, be Lorentz invariant at the phenomenal\nlevel, if (as in the de Broglie-Bohm theory) the distinguished\nfoliation is unobservable.\n\nA stochastic theory, such as a dynamical collapse theory, must involve\ncorrelations between spacelike separated events. A relation like that,\nhowever, is symmetric, and does not require that one of the events be\nin the past of the other. There is no prima facie need for\nnonrelativistic spacetime structure. Indeed, it is possible to\nformulate a fully relativistic dynamical collapse theory. A\nrelativistic generalization of the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory\nwas constructed by Dove (1996) and, independently, by Tumulka (2006).\nRelativistic versions of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL)\ntheory have been constructed by Bedingham (2011) and Pearle (2015).\nFor discussions of ontology for such theories, required to extract\nfrom them a sensible account of a world that includes macroscopic\nobjects, see Pearle (1997), Bedingham et al. (2014), and\nMyrvold (2019). \n\nShimony, in several of his writings (Shimony 1978, 1983, 1984a,b, 1986,\n1988, 1989, 1990, 1991) spoke of \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d\nbetween special relativity and quantum theory. The meaning of this\nvaried. In its initial formulation (1978), \u201cpeaceful\ncoexistence\u201d had to do with regarding experimental outcomes as\ntransitions from potentiality to actuality, something that, Shimony\nsays, requires further investigation to be understood. In later\nwritings, peaceful coexistence is \u201csuggested\u201d by the fact\nthat quantum correlations cannot be exploited for superluminal\nsignalling (Shimony 1983), though still associated with the notion\nthat quantum mechanics motivates a change in our conception of an\nevent (Shimony 1984a), and involves the requirement of a coherent\nmeshing of events as described with respect to different reference\nframes (1986). In other works peaceful coexistence seems to be simply\nidentified with the impossibility of exploiting quantum correlations\nfor signalling (Shimony 1984b, 1990, 1991). Convinced by Bell (1990)\nthat anthropocentric considerations such as manipulability have no\nplace in considerations of fundamental physics, Shimony became\ndissatisfied with this avenue of approach to reconciling relativity\nand quantum theory (Shimony 2009, 489). \n\nBell\u2019s own attitude towards the question of whether Bell\u2019s\ntheorem indicates a fundamental incompatibility between quantum theory\nand relativity seems to have varied with time. At the end of the 1964\narticle, he wrote \n\nIn a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to\ndetermine the results of individual measurements, without changing the\nstatistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the\nsetting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another\ninstrument, however remote. Moreover, the signal involved must\npropagate instantaneously, so that such a theory could not be Lorentz\ninvariant (Bell 1964, 199; 1987b and 2004, 20).\n\n\nAt this point he is claiming incompatibility with relativity only for\ndeterministic hidden-variables theories. Later, however, he spoke of\n\u201cthe apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation\n[of quantum theory] and fundamental relativity. That is to say, we\nhave an apparent incompatibility, at the deepest level, between the\ntwo fundamental pillars of contemporary theory\u2026\u201d (Bell\n1987b and 2004, 172; these are remarks from a meeting held in 1984).\nNote that this is hedged, and he speaks of \u201capparently\nessential\u201d conflict only. In the same year, he wrote, \u201cI\nam unable to prove, or even formulate clearly, the proposition that a\nsharp formulation of quantum field theory, such as that set out here,\nmust disrespect serious Lorentz invariance. But it seems to me that\nthis is probably so\u201d (1984, 7; 1987b and 2004, 180).\n\nA shift in attitude was occasioned by the publication of the GRW\ndynamical collapse theory (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber, 1986). In a\ncommentary on this theory, Bell wrote,\n\nI am particularly struck by the fact that the model is as Lorentz\ninvariant as it could be in the nonrelativistic version. It takes away\nthe ground of my fear that any exact formulation of quantum mechanics\nmust conflict with fundamental Lorentz invariance (1987a, 14; 1987b\nand 2004, 209).\n\n\nIn a lecture delivered in Trieste in the last year of his life, Bell\ndiscussed the prospects for a genuinely relativistic version of a\ndynamical collapse theory, and concluded that the difficulties\nencountered by Ghirardi, Grassi, and Pearle in producing a genuinely\nrelativistic version of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization theory\n(CSL), a theory that would be \u201cLorentz invariant, not just for\nall practical purposes but deeply, in the sense of Einstein,\neliminating entirely any privileged reference system from the\ntheory\u201d (2007, 2931), were \u201cSecond-Class\nDifficulties,\u201d technical difficulties, and not deep conceptual\nones. This seems to have been borne out by the construction of the\nfully relativistic collapse theories already mentioned.",
