    "main_text": "Fichte Phase\n3. Fichte Phase\n\nInitially impressed with the brilliance Fichte displayed in his early\nwritings on revelation and the French Revolution, Reinhold called\nFichte the \u201cnew star on the horizon of philosophy\u201d\n(Fichte im Gespr\u00e4ch 1, p. 62) and \u201cone of the\ngreatest minds and noblest human beings of our time\u201d (Fichte\nim Gespr\u00e4ch 1, p. 66). However, these rosy beginnings would\ngive way to rocky times. Reinhold and Fichte\u2019s storied\nfriendship was mired with recurrent estrangement and reconciliation,\nuntil they parted ways\u2014both professionally and\npersonally\u2014over Reinhold\u2019s defection from the\nWissenschaftslehre to the standpoint of rational realism (for\ndetails, see Breazeale 2020).\n\nFichte agreed with Reinhold\u2019s programmatic demands for the\nsystematic completeness of philosophy and its foundation in the form\nof a first principle. Although Fichte admitted the validity of\nReinhold\u2019s Principle of Consciousness, he denied that it could\nserve as a first principle, since it presupposes a subject and object\nto be related and distinguished in representation. According to\nFichte, the first principle of philosophy must be a non-propositional\nself-positing, which, by its very activity is simultaneously factive,\na Tathandlung. However, Reinhold was initially unphased by\nthese and similar criticisms by Salomon Maimon, taking himself to\nanticipate them in the first essay of his 1794 Beytr\u00e4ge\nII. It would be several more years before Reinhold conceded the\nsuperiority of Fichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre.\n\nIn the first public announcement of his conversion to the\nWissenschaftslehre, Reinhold discusses three primary issues\ndeficient in the Elementary Philosophy, for which the\nWissenschaftslehre is supposed to account: first, the a\npriori possibility of consciousness; second, objective matter;\nand third, the unconditioned unity of theoretical and practical\nreason. Concerning the first point, Reinhold had previously regarded\nFichte\u2019s pure I as an inconceivable basis of philosophy, if the\nPrinciple of Consciousness were not presupposed. However, by early\n1797 Reinhold realized \u201cthat the possibility of\nconsciousness determined a priori [...] can by no means be\ntraced to the mere subject of consciousness\u201d\n(Vermischter Schriften II, p. vii; RGS 5/2, 4). This\nis because the subject of consciousness, as it relates to an object in\nrepresentation, can be only the \u201cempirical I,\u201d\nand therefore cannot serve as an a priori condition of\nconsciousness (Vermischter Schriften II, p. x; RGS\n5/2, 5). Instead, the synthetic unity between subject and object\nin consciousness presupposes an original activity of the absolute\nsubject.\n\nSecond, Reinhold claims that the Elementary Philosophy presupposes\n\u201cthe wretched thing in itself\u201d (Vermischter\nSchriften II, p. 359; RGS 5/2, 139) and cannot account\nfor the objective matter of our representations. In the Elementary\nPhilosophy, the \u201cmatter\u201d of a representation is that\nthrough which the representation has objective reference\n(Beytr\u00e4ge I, p. 182f.; 2003: 124f.). It is supposed to\nbe given in outer sensation by something distinct from the subject,\nnamely a thing in itself (Versuch, pp. 244\u2013255; RGS\n1, 164\u2013171). Since the thing in itself stands outside the\nsynthetic unity of subject and object constitutive of representation,\nit cannot be represented. So, the material aspect of representation\npresupposes something that cannot be given in consciousness (the thing\nin itself) and that therefore stands outside the purview of the\nPrinciple of Consciousness. This is problematic because the Principle\nof Consciousness is supposed to be the first principle of philosophy;\nthus, the Elementary Philosophy cannot account for the ground of the\nobjective matter of representation. Reinhold had attempted to deal\nwith this issue by distinguishing between the thing in itself and the\nnoumenon (which he sometimes calls \u201cnoumen\u201d). While the\nthing in itself cannot be represented, we may represent the mere idea\nof the putative ground of objective matter, the noumenon\n(Fundament, p. 191n; RGS 4, 107n; Beytr\u00e4ge\nI, p. 216f; 2003: 151). By his conversion to the\nWissenschaftslehre, Reinhold considered this distinction\nfutile: the external ground of sensation cannot be posited in the\nnoumenon, since the latter is a \u201cmere product of reason\u201d\n(Vermischter Schriften II, p. x; RGS 5/2, 4) and\nthus cannot account for the objectivity of the matter presupposed by\nconsciousness (Vermischter Schriften II, p. 322f; RGS\n5/2, 126).\n\nThird, Reinhold takes the Elementary Philosophy to entail an\nunbridgeable gap between theoretical and practical reason. The task of\nunifying theoretical and practical philosophy in a comprehensive\nsystem had been a major stumbling block for Reinhold (see Gerten 2003;\nImhof 2012). In his 1789 Versuch, Reinhold had tenuously\nattempted to unify the theoretical and practical sides of the\nElementary Philosophy by making the faculty of desire an actualizing\ncondition of the faculty of representation. In the second volume of\nthe Letters on the Kantian Philosophy, one of\nReinhold\u2019s most extensive endeavors in practical philosophy, he\nmakes no attempt to systematically connect the \u201cresults\u201d\nof his investigation with the Elementary Philosophy, promising instead\nto derive them on another occasion. By his conversion to Fichte,\nReinhold realized that practical philosophy could not be\nsystematically integrated into the Elementary Philosophy, but only\nconjoined to it as an \u201cannex\u201d (Vermischter Schriften\nII, p. 324; RGS 5/2, 127).\n\nEver committed to the Enlightenment ideal of making philosophy\nuniversally recognizable, Reinhold\u2019s conversion to the\nWissenschaftslehre was coupled with a missionary zeal to\nimpart its truth (cf. Reinhold to Fichte, 17 February 1797: GA III/2,\n50). Nevertheless, there is widespread consensus that Reinhold\u2019s\ncommitment to Fichte\u2019s philosophy was lukewarm at best (e.g.\nBreazeale 2020; Bondeli 1995; Bondeli 2020; Klemmt 1958: 537). In\nparticular, it is doubtful that Reinhold fully understood the\nWissenschaftslehre; much of his omnibus review of\nFichte\u2019s system evinces only a superficial understanding of it.\nFurthermore, by 1799 Reinhold adopted a middle position between Fichte\nand Jacobi. In his Ueber die Paradoxien and open letters to\nJ.C. Lavater and Fichte, Reinhold addresses the apparent paradox\nbetween the validity of the Wissenschaftslehre and the\nimpossibility of grasping its results by means of ordinary\nunderstanding (see Breazeale 2020:29ff; di Giovanni 2003). He attempts\nto resolve this tension by prioritizing faith and moral conscience,\narguing that philosophy depends on these for its certainty. Yet, this\neffort to mediate between Fichte and Jacobi was short-lived: by the\nend of 1799, Reinhold had become enthralled with J.G. Bardili\u2019s\nlogical realism and his relationship with Fichte soon came to an\nend.\n",
