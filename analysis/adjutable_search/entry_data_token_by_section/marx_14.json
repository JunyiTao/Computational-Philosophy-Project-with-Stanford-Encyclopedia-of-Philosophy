    "main_text": "Theory of History || Alternative Interpretations\n3.6 Alternative Interpretations\n\nMany defenders of Marx will argue that the problems stated are\nproblems for Cohen\u2019s interpretation of Marx, rather than for\nMarx himself. It is possible to argue, for example, that Marx did not\nhave a general theory of history, but rather was a social scientist\nobserving and encouraging the transformation of capitalism into\ncommunism as a singular event. And it is certainly true that when Marx\nanalyses a particular historical episode, as he does in the 18th\nBrumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852), any idea of fitting events\ninto a fixed pattern of history seems very far from Marx\u2019s mind.\nOn other views Marx did have a general theory of history but it is far\nmore flexible and less determinate than Cohen insists (Miller 1984).\nAnd finally, as noted, there are critics who believe that\nCohen\u2019s interpretation is entirely wrong-headed owing to its\ndismissive attitude to dialectical reasoning (Sayers 1984 [1990]).\n",
