    "main_text": "Criticisms of Quaker defences of women || Denigration of natural women\n5.1 Denigration of natural women\n\n\nIn some Quaker texts, \u201cwoman\u201d or\n\u201cwomanliness\u201d is redefined to mean weakness and carnal\nwisdom by contrast with strength and spiritual wisdom. In To The\nPriests and People, Cotton and Cole identify womanliness with\nweakness, vanity, shame, and dishonor. They insult the priests who\nvisit them in prison by saying that \u201cyou your selves are the\nwomen, that are forbidden to speak in the Church\u201d (Cotton\n& Cole 1655, 7\u20138). In response, Gill (2005) notes that\n\n\nthere is a problem with accusing enemies with possessing\n\u2018feminine\u2019 weakness. Such an argument retains categories of\ngender difference, thereby assigning them continued significance.\nMasculine characteristics remain preferable to those associated with\nwomen. (52; cf. also Trevett 1991, 50).\n\n\n\nIn short, these Quaker writers continue to perpetuate a male-biased\ntradition in Western religion according to which femaleness is\nsymbolically coded as inferior, imperfect, and \u201cless\ndivine\u201d than maleness (cf. Tuana 1993). They implicitly accept\nthe prejudices of their misogynist critics, such as Joshuah Miller and\nJohn Knox, who maintain that women are physically weak and mentally\nfeeble by nature.\n\n\nAnother, closely related, problem is that in some Quaker texts\nnatural women themselves are not permitted to preach the word of the\nLord. Smith (1982) points out that \u201cWomen functioned as the\nvessels for Christ\u2019s teaching, not as speakers for\nthemselves\u201d (70). Women are permitted to speak only insofar as\nthey are instruments or bearers of the light. According to Gill, the\nQuaker women \u201cseem to be attempting to divorce spirituality from\nphysicality, claiming the message should be attended to rather than the\nperson delivering it\u201d (Gill 2005, 42). But this separation\nbetween the spiritual and the physical is problematic. Spiritually\nspeaking, the body of the female preacher is simply irrelevant to the\ndelivery of the message; while physically speaking, the female preacher\nstill represents all that which is despicable and unworthy of God. In\nsum, it would appear that the early Quaker defenders of women\u2019s\npreaching either ignore or denigrate a woman\u2019s sexed body.\n",
