One way of understanding\nthis is via the framework found in Rawls\u2019 1955 article Two\nConcepts of Rules.\n\nRawls distinguished between what he called the \u201csummary\u201d\nconception of rules, in which rules are merely \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d, i.e., guides to established actions\u2014like the rules\nof effective writing, and the \u201cpractice\u201d view of rules,\nwhere the rules define a practice, which in turn defines the actions\nregulated by the rules. Rawls calls these latter sort\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d rules.\n\nConstitutive rules, like the rules of baseball, are necessary for us\nto perform (and even understand) game-based actions like\n\u201cstriking out\u201d or \u201chitting a home run\u201d (Rawls\n1955). So on views that are ontologically conventionalist, promises\nare like home runs, i.e., they are only intelligible within the bounds\nof the convention\u2014they are artefacts of it.\n\nThe second thing meant by the term \u201cconventionalist\u201d is\nwhat I call Normative Conventionalism. This is the idea that the\nconvention explains the normative force of the promissory obligation,\nin a particular way. On these views individual promises are obligatory\nbecause of some prior obligation to the convention or its members as\nsuch.\n\nThis appeal can be made in different ways, by pointing to different\nelements of the convention and the ways in which reneging might affect\nit. One standard way is to argue for a duty to uphold the convention,\non some basis, as well as an appeal to the damage one might do to the\nconvention by reneging.\n\nThe two qualities go naturally together, and many contemporary\ntheories make both claims, although they are sometimes not careful to\ndistinguish them. But they are independent qualities, and they can and\ndo come apart. This can be seen by considering two early\nconventionalist theories, those of Hobbes and Hume.\n\nHobbes thinks that keeping promises is only rational (and thus\npromises are obligatory) due to the fear of punishment for reneging,\npunishment that only follows from the establishment of the civil state\nand a system of promissory exchange backed by the power of that\nstate:\n\n\nCovenants Of Mutuall Trust, When Invalid\n\nIf a Covenant be made, wherein neither of the parties performe\npresently, but trust one another; in the condition of meer Nature,\n(which is a condition of Warre of every man against every man,) upon\nany reasonable suspition, it is Voyd; But if there be a common Power\nset over them bothe, with right and force sufficient to compell\nperformance; it is not Voyd. For he that performeth first, has no\nassurance the other will performe after; because the bonds of words\nare too weak to bridle mens ambition, avarice, anger, and other\nPassions, without the feare of some coerceive Power; which in the\ncondition of meer Nature, where all men are equall, and judges of the\njustnesse of their own fears cannot possibly be supposed. And\ntherefore he which performeth first, does but betray himselfe to his\nenemy; contrary to the Right (he can never abandon) of defending his\nlife, and means of living.\n\nBut in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain\nthose that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more\nreasonable; and for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform\nfirst, is obliged so to do.\n\nThe cause of Feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be\nalwayes something arising after the Covenant made; as some new fact,\nor other signe of the Will not to performe; else it cannot make the\nCovenant Voyd. For that which could not hinder a man from promising,\nought not to be admitted as a hindrance of performing.\n\n\nBut Hobbes also thinks that promises, and their cognates, exchanges,\nagreements and covenants and contracts, arise not from any convention,\nbut rather from our power to transfer innate rights we have to each\nother:\n\n\nRenouncing (or) Transferring Right What; Obligation Duty Injustice\n\nRight is layd aside, either by simply Renouncing it; or by\nTransferring it to another. By Simply RENOUNCING; when he cares not to\nwhom the benefit thereof redoundeth. By TRANSFERRING; when he\nintendeth the benefit thereof to some certain person, or persons. And\nwhen a man hath in either manner abandoned, or granted away his Right;\nthen is he said to be OBLIGED, or BOUND, not to hinder those, to whom\nsuch Right is granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that\nhe Ought, and it his DUTY, not to make voyd that voluntary act of his\nown: and that such hindrance is INJUSTICE, and INJURY, as being Sine\nJure; the Right being before renounced, or transferred. So that\nInjury, or Injustice, in the controversies of the world, is somewhat\nlike to that, which in the disputations of Scholers is called\nAbsurdity. For as it is there called an Absurdity, to contradict what\none maintained in the Beginning: so in the world, it is called\nInjustice, and Injury, voluntarily to undo that, which from the\nbeginning he had voluntarily done. The way by which a man either\nsimply Renounceth, or Transferreth his Right, is a Declaration, or\nSignification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or signes, that\nhe doth so Renounce, or Transferre; or hath so Renounced, or\nTransferred the same, to him that accepteth it. And these Signes are\neither Words onely, or Actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often)\nboth Words and Actions. And the same are the BONDS, by which men are\nbound, and obliged: Bonds, that have their strength, not from their\nown Nature, (for nothing is more easily broken then a mans word,) but\nfrom Feare of some evill consequence upon the rupture.\n\n\nThe distinction helps us perhaps understand a bit better the obvious\ntension between these two claims on Hobbes\u2019 part. How is it that\nHobbes can say that promises and contracts are matters of the will, in\none section, but then null and void in the state of nature in the\nsubsequent? Because in the first gloss Hobbes is saying what a promise\nis, ontologically speaking, and in the second he is speaking of what\ngenerates its normative force.\n\nSo Hobbes\u2019 theory is normatively, but not ontologically,\nconventionalist. He takes it that the normative force of a promise\nflows from the convention, while the promise itself is created by an\nact of the will in transfer of rights.\n\nFor Hume, the reverse is true. Hume thinks that promises are\nconventional in the ontological sense\u2014they are artefacts of a\nhuman convention, and fidelity, the virtue of justice that attend\nthem, is also artificial for this reason. This he contrasts with\nother, natural virtues, like caring for offspring, which are\ninnate.\n\n\nI say, first, that a promise is not intelligible naturally, nor\nantecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with\nsociety, could never enter into any engagements with another, even\nthough they could perceive each other\u2019s thoughts by intuition.\n[\u2026]\n\nNow it is evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of\npromises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises\nhad no moral obligation, we never should feel any inclination to\nobserve them. This is not the case with the natural virtues. Though\nthere was no obligation to relieve the miserable, our humanity would\nlead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the\nomission arises from its being a proof, that we want the natural\nsentiments of humanity. A father knows it to be his duty to take care\nof his children: But he has also a natural inclination to it. And if\nno human creature had that indication, no one could lie under any such\nobligation. (Treatise, 3.2.5)\n\n\nBut Hume also thinks that the primary role of the convention in\nproducing individual promissory obligations is indirect. Hume takes it\nthat the appreciation of the convention produces in people both the\nsentiments themselves that are, for Hume, the mark of the moral, as\nwell as the dispositions to foster and encourage those sentiments in\nthemselves and others:\n\n\nThere needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us\nperceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest\nexperience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each\nindividual perceives the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he\nimmediately performs his part of any contract, as being assured, that\nthey will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter\ninto a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to\nbe true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this\nconcert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in\nthe faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to\nother members of the society. This immediately causes that interest to\noperate upon them; and interest is the first obligation to the\nperformance of promises.\n\nAfterwards a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and becomes a\nnew obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the\nperformance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in\nthe abstinence from the property of others. Public interest,\neducation, and the artifices of politicians, have the same effect in\nboth cases. The difficulties, that occur to us, in supposing a moral\nobligation to attend promises, we either surmount or elude.\n(Treatise, 3.2.5)\n\n\nSo Hume\u2019s promissory theory is ontologically conventionalist,\nbut not normatively so. Rather promises are obligatory by way of the\nmoral sentiments, like all other moral obligations. This point is\nelegantly made in a recent piece, \u201cHume\u2019s Practice Theory\nand its Dissimilar Descendants\u201d (Cohon 2021)\n",
