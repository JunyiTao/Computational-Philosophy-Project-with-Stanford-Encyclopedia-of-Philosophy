Aristotle\u2019s Challenge to the Opponent to Signify Some One Thing\n\nAristotle challenges the opponent to signify some one thing both to\nhimself and to another, for example, \u201chuman being\u201d.\nAristotle explains that the word chosen by the opponent can have\nseveral meanings, provided one definition can be assigned to each and\neach definition is assigned a different word. Aristotle says that the\nword may not have infinitely many meanings. Perhaps this is because\notherwise the opponent can keep on saying that we have not yet reached\nthe meaning she has in mind, or perhaps Aristotle envisages infinitely\nbranching meanings, so that we will never arrive at anything\ndefinite.\n\nAristotle next draws a distinction between \u201csignifying\u201d\nand \u201csignifying about\u201d. The opponent needs to do both and\nnot merely signify about. One can signify about something by saying\n\u201cpale (thing)\u201d, but that does not tell you what you are\nsignifying, e.g., a human being. \u201cHuman being\u201d both\nsignifies about and signifies a human being. If \u201chuman\nbeing\u201d means something definite, for example, \u201ctwo-footed\nanimal\u201d (Aristotle\u2019s dummy definition), then, Aristotle\nconcludes, it is impossible that the same thing be a human being and\nnot be a human being. (For a parallel discussion, see Posterior\nAnalytics I 22.)\n\nOn such an account, Aristotle is showing the opponent that if she\nwants to reject PNC she must pick out the same object and say that\ncontradictory predicates apply, but if she does not mean anything\ndefinite by \u201chuman being\u201d, for example, then she will be\nunable to pick out a subject of predication, for example, a human\nbeing, and say that contradictory predicates apply. Saying that an\nindividual human being is a human being and not a human being, where\nthe first means \u201ctwo-footed animal\u201d and the latter means\nsomething different is not to reject PNC. That is why the opponent\nmust pick a particular word with a definite meaning.\n\nOn an alternative account, Aristotle is merely talking about kinds.\n\u201cPale (thing)\u201d does not signify a kind, whereas\n\u201chuman being\u201d does. Signifying one thing does not involve\nsignifying an individual who is a member of a kind, but simply one\nkind.\n\nThe details of the argument are controversial. Is it meant to be\ngeneralizable across the board so that it would work for things that\nare not substances, for example, qualities like redness? Aristotle\nelsewhere says that the sweet is necessarily so (Metaph IV 5\n1010b24\u20136). Must the opponent say something that names a natural\nkind? What if the opponent says \u201canimal\u201d, naming a genus\nrather than a species? What if the opponent says\n\u201cgoatstag\u201d, something that does not exist? Does the\ndistinction between \u201csignifying\u201d and \u201csignifying\nabout\u201d necessarily lead to subjects that are individuals (for\nexample, individual human beings or horses) and their properties?\nHere, we run into the issue of Aristotelian essentialism.\n",
