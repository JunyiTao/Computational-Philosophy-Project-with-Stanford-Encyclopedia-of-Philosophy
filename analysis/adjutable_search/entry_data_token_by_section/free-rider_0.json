    "main_text": "The Logic of Collective Action\n1. The Logic of Collective Action\n\n\nThe strategic structure of the logic of collective action is that of\nthe n-prisoner\u2019s dilemma (Hardin 1971, 1982a). If n\nis 2 and the two members are able to coordinate on whether they act\ntogether, there can be no free rider unless one of the members is de\nfacto altruistic. As represented in Game 1, prisoner\u2019s dilemma for two\nplayers is essentially the model of exchange (Hardin 1982b). Suppose\nthat, in the status quo, I have a car and you have $5000 but that both\nof us would prefer to have what the other has. Of course, each of us\nwould rather have the holdings of both of us: both the money and the\ncar. The second best outcome for both of us would be for you to have my\ncar in exchange for my having your money. The status quo is a worse\nstate of affairs for both of us than that in which we succeed in\nexchanging. In the matrix, the outcomes are ordinally ranked from best\n(1) to worst (4) for each player. For example, the outcome (upper right\ncell) in which you yield the money and I keep the car is worst (4) for\nyou as the Row player and best (1) for me as the Column player.\n\n\n\n\nColumn\n\n\nYield car\nKeep car\n\n\nRow\nYield $5000\n2, 2\n4, 1\n\n\nKeep $5000\n1, 4\n3, 3\n\n\nGame 1: Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma or Exchange\n\n\n\nAs an n-prisoner\u2019s dilemma for n \u226b 2,\ncollective action is therefore essentially large-number exchange. Each\nof us exchanges a bit of effort or resources in return for benefiting\nfrom some collective provision. The signal difference is that I can\ncheat in the large-number exchange by free riding on the contributions\nof others, whereas such cheating in the two-person case would commonly\nbe illegal, because it would require my taking from you without giving\nyou something you prefer in return.\n\n\nIn some collective provisions, each contribution makes the overall\nprovision larger; in some, there is a tipping point at which one or a\nfew more contributions secure the provision\u2014as is true, for example,\nin elections, in which a difference of two more votes out of a very\nlarge number can change defeat into victory. Even in the latter case,\nhowever, the expected value of each voter\u2019s contribution is the same ex\nante; there is no particular voter whose vote tips the outcome. Let us,\nhowever, neglect the tipping cases and consider only those cases in\nwhich provision is, if not an exactly linear function of the number of\nindividual contributions or of the amount of resources contributed, at\nleast a generally increasing function and not a tipping or step\nfunction at any point. In such cases, if n is very large and you do not\ncontribute to our collective effort, the rest of us might still benefit\nfrom providing our collective good, so that you benefit without\ncontributing. You are then a free rider on the efforts of the rest of\nus.\n\n\nUnfortunately, each and every one of us might have a positive\nincentive to try to free ride on the efforts of others. My\ncontribution\u2014say, an hour\u2019s work or a hundred\ndollars\u2014might add substantially to the overall provision. But my\npersonal share of the increase from my own contribution alone might be\nvanishingly small. In any case of interest, it is true that my benefit\nfrom having all of us, including myself, contribute is far greater\nthan the status quo benefit of having no one contribute. Still, my\nbenefit from my own contribution may be negligible. Therefore I and\npossibly every one of us have incentive not to contribute and to free\nride on the contributions of others. If we all attempt to free ride,\nhowever, there is no provision and no \u2018ride.\u2019\n\n\nThe scope for free riding can be enormous. Suppose our large group\nwould benefit from providing ourselves some good at cost to each of us.\nIt is likely to be true that some subgroup, perhaps much smaller than\nthe whole group, would already benefit if even only its own members\ncontribute toward the larger group\u2019s good. Suppose this is true for k\n\u226a n. This k-subgroup now faces its own collective action\nproblem, one that is perhaps complicated by the sense that the large\nnumber of free riders are getting away with something unfairly. If one\nperson in an exchange tried to free ride, the other person would most\nlikely refuse to go along and the attempted free ride would fail. But if\nn \u2212 k members of our group attempt to free ride,\nthe rest of us cannot punish the free riders by refusing to go along\nwithout harming our own interests.\n",
