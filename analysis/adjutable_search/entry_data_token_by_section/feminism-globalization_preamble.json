    "main_text": "\n\nIn its broadest sense, globalization refers to the economic, social,\ncultural, and political processes of integration that result from the\nexpansion of transnational economic production, migration,\ncommunications, and technologies. Although both Western and\nnon-Western feminists working in various areas of philosophy,\nincluding ethics, metaphysics, political philosophy, epistemology, and\naesthetics, have made important contributions to debates about\nglobalization, this entry focuses on one subset of these critiques.\nBelow, we outline the ways in which predominantly Western feminist\npolitical philosophers who explicitly discuss globalization have\narticulated and addressed the challenges associated with its economic\nand political dimensions.\n",
