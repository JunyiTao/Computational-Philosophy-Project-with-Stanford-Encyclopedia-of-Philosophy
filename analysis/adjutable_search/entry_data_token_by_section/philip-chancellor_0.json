He was a member of a prominent Parisian family; many of his\nrelatives held important positions, in service to the French kings or\nto the church. Several were bishops of prominent sees, in particular,\nhis uncle, Peter of Nemours, who was bishop of Paris from 1208 to 1218\nand who helped to foster Philip\u2019s career. Most likely, Philip\nreceived his education at the nascent University of Paris, where he\nalso taught.  Sometime in the early 1200s, he was appointed archdeacon\nof Noyon, a position he held even after becoming chancellor of the\nCathedral of Notre Dame in Paris in 1217. Philip died in 1236, most\nlikely on December 26. \n",
