    "main_text": "Other Uses of Dutch Book Arguments || Dutch Books and Rational Choice\n6. Conclusion\n\nIt remains defensible that the Dutch Book argument shows that the\nprobability axioms are something like consistency constraints on\npartial belief, at least given some substantial decision-theoretic\nassumptions, unlike the idea that their violation is a pragmatic\nliability. But this interpretation is less successful for the various\nother norms for which Dutch Book arguments have been constructed. The\nDutch Strategy arguments for the Principle of Conditionalization and\nfor Jeffrey\u2019s Rule do not fully support the norms, but only the\nweaker claim that one should not commit in advance to following an\nalternative rule under some additional conditions, and the sense in\nwhich it may be said to be inconsistent to do so seems different from\nwhat is involved in violating the axioms. The other claims considered\nhere for which Dutch Book arguments have been constructed are even\nless plausibly regarded as consistency constraints, and thus seem to\nbe a different sort of requirement on ideal rationality. This suggests\nthe need to identify \u2018consistency\u2019 with a narrower set of\nconditions than mere Dutch Book vulnerability, if we are not to\nabandon the idea of the probability axioms as a consistency constraint\nthat extends the ordinary concept and, perhaps, reject the DBA\naltogether. A more fine-grained analysis of the various Dutch Books\nmight yield a way of marking off those that point to genuine\ninconsistency from those exhibiting some other sort of defect, but a\nsatisfactory way of accomplishing this remains illusive.\n\nAmong those who endorse at least certain Dutch Book arguments,\nsome regard them as establishing rationality requirements without\nembracing the idea that Dutch Book vulnerability involves a kind of\ninconsistency.  This avoids the problem of making sense of the\ninconsistency involved in Dutch Book vulnerability, but faces\nchallenges in specifying the sort of rationality that is at stake.\n Responses to the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection have\nprompted a particularly wide array of attitudes towards\nDutch Book vulnerability.  It is striking that nearly a century\nafter the publication of Ramsey\u2019s paper, there remains so much\ndisagreement and continued work on how to understand Dutch Book\narguments.\n",
