    "main_text": "Key Issues and Debates || Latin American Feminist Autonomy\n2.1 Latin American Feminist Autonomy\n\nAutonomy is a foundational, albeit contested, concept in\nLatin American feminisms. It is a foundational concept to the extent\nthat feminist identity has hinged on the conceptualization of\nautonomy. However, how autonomy is defined has been widely debated as\nthe term has been deployed in varying capacities. Autonomy has been\nused conceptually to forge alliances between women\u2019s groups in\nLatin America that seek to eradicate gender-based oppression. It has\nalso been used to avoid co-option by actors like political parties,\nNGO\u2019s, the state, and funding agencies. The result is a tension\nbetween the retention of ideological and financial autonomy and the\nwidening of feminisms\u2019 scope and impact. Thus, the varying use\nof autonomy calls into question how it is being defined (Alvarez et\nal. 2003: 542).\n\nThe history of feminist autonomy in Latin American feminism is rooted\nin the activism of the 1970s and 1980s where it was invoked in\nopposition to militant feminists (militantes) involved with\nthe political parties of the Left. Autonomy, in this context, was\ndefined as independence from any organization that understood the\nfight for women\u2019s liberation as a secondary goal. On the other\nside stood those who took the fight for revolutionary social change as\nconcurrent with feminist involvement and advocated for double\nparticipation (Alvarez et al. 2003: 543). The rise of the political\nLeft in many Latin American countries involved resistance to political\nregimes, and the question of where dedication was rooted reflected the\nrelationship between feminism and the possibilities for social change.\nFeminist activism revealed the way in which the negotiation of\nautonomy was and continues to be an evolving concept. As the 1980s\nprogressed with their shifting political landscape, the idea of\nautonomous feminism came to be redundant. Hence, an understanding of\nengaged autonomy emerged, which maintained the importance of retaining\na feminist stance while negotiating or participating in social\npractice (Alvarez et al. 2003: 543).\n\nThe concept of autonomy surfaced throughout the Encuentros that\nspanned the 1970s\u20131990s and further illuminated the question of\ninclusion. If being autonomous entailed commitments to women\u2019s\nliberation, being autonomous also signaled participation in a feminist\nproject. However, it is contestable what the criteria of inclusion\nunder the label of feminism was. As Latin American feminisms underwent\ninstitutionalization, two logics characterized the problem of\ninclusion.\n\nThe policy-advocacy logic argued for promoting feminist-influenced\ngender policy through governmental or non-governmental organizations.\nOn the other hand, the identity-solidarity logic distanced itself from\nformal institutions and remained centered on women\u2019s movements\nthrough the development of feminist ideas in community and politics\n(Alvarez et al. 2003: 548). However, neither one of these necessarily\nentailed the inclusion of all women as is demonstrated by contemporary\ncritiques of the hegemonic practices of Latin American feminisms that\nfailed to pay attention to the importance of race, class, ethnicity,\nand sexuality in shaping subordination (Alvarez et al. 2003: 565).\nCutting across these logics is the way in which inclusion in feminism\nis contingent upon practice. How autonomy is understood hinges upon an\nunderstanding of feminist practice, and those practices are shaped by\ndynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, autonomy would be\nre-defined through individual and collective commitment to the\ntransformation of women\u2019s lives and society as a whole (Alvarez\net al. 2003: 557). At present, there is not a settled definition of\nfeminist autonomy, but rather a pluralism of understanding that tracks\na variety of proposals for understanding feminist engagement and\npractices.\n",
