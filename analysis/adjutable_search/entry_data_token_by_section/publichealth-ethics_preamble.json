    "main_text": "\n\nAt its core, public health is concerned with promoting and protecting\nthe health of\n populations,[1]\n broadly understood. Promoting and protecting the health of\npopulations often involves or requires coordinated action on the part\nof governments. In the United States, for example, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Protection Agency\nare, at least in part, public health agencies. All nations and most\nstates or provinces and municipalities have health departments whose\nfunctions include everything from the inspection of commercial food\nservice to the collection and use of epidemiological data for\npopulation surveillance of disease. Collective action to promote and\nprotect population health also occurs at the global level, as\nexemplified by the activities of the World Health Organization.\n\nThis entry provides a general lay of the land of the central ethical\nissues and challenges that arise in public health policies and\npractices and that drive the literature in public health ethics. Some\nissues are conceptual: what is the public, and in what sense can a\npublic be healthy? Other questions concern the moral foundations of\nthe enterprise: what sort of value does public health have, and what\nmorally justifies efforts to promote public health?\n\nThe literature in public health ethics often falls into two big\ncategories. The first category focuses on the goals, targets and\npriorities of public health policies and programs from the standpoint\nof justice. Many of the issues engage familiar debates between\nutilitarian and various egalitarian approaches to the allocation of\nresources and the distribution of benefits and burdens (see also the\nentry on\n justice);\n in health policy circles these issues often play out as tensions\nbetween efficiency and equity. The justice literature in public health\nethics also addresses broader concerns about structural injustice,\nfairness and power. Health and threats to health often vary\nsignificantly between different social groups or subpopulations within\na defined public. Because these differences frequently co-travel with\nindices of disadvantage and power, and because health is viewed by\nmany as a core dimension of human welfare or flourishing, some frame\nthe foundation or justification of public health in terms of fairness\nand justice \u2013 much in the way that significant disparities in\nresources or liberties are generally framed. Although questions of\njustice in public health regularly occur within the same nation-state,\nthese same questions also arise between countries and regions of the\nworld. For instance, the life expectancy of individuals in many\ncountries in the global south is far lower than in wealthier nations.\nTo some, this is a clear injustice, one that should be front and\ncenter in debates about public health.\n\nThe second category in the public health ethics literature also\nfocuses on the goals and targets of public health policies and\nprograms but from the standpoint of the legitimacy or authority of the\nState to implement measures that promote or protect public health.\n(See also the entry on\n political legitimacy.)\n The normative perspective of legitimacy is particularly relevant in\npublic health ethics because public health interventions are typically\nundertaken by government, and many maintain that various government\ninterventions stand in special need of moral justification. Familiar\ndebates about the tension between individual liberty and the common\ngood or the moral permissibility of paternalistic interventions have\ntraditionally animated this discussion. Others frame the challenges of\nstate legitimacy or authority slightly differently in terms of what\ngovernments should do when citizens disagree about values, such as the\nimportance of health \u2013 individual or public. Still others object\nto the framing of the foundations or justifications of public health\nfrom the standpoint of legitimacy in the liberal tradition.\n\nMany real-world challenges in public health ethics require both the\njustice and the legitimacy standpoints in order to provide an adequate\nanalysis of what is morally at stake. For instance, one way to\ninterpret challenges to New York\u2019s soda tax is that the state\nlacked the right to interfere with individual choice by imposing a\ntax, or that such a tax was objectionable because it rested on a\ncontentious view about the disvalue of soft drinks. However, that\nframing is ethically incomplete without also addressing whether the\nregressive character of the tax meant that the costs of its attendant\npublic health benefits would be borne disproportionately by subgroups\nin the population who are already disadvantaged in ways that cannot be\njustified.\n\nMany writers in public health ethics are concerned to integrate both\nstandpoints in their analyses of specific issues in public health\npolicy that, like the soda tax example, importantly engage them both.\nHowever, because many debates within public health ethics are located\nin one standpoint or the other, we distinguish them in this\nentry. Before taking up these different debates, Section 1 articulates\ntwo distinctive features of public health that give shape to public\nhealth ethics and help to distinguish it from other areas of inquiry\nin bioethics, especially the ethics of clinical practice. The first\nand perhaps most defining of these two features is that public health\nis committed to advancing the health of collectives, and not the\nhealth of individuals. Much of Section 1 is taken up with several\nconceptual and ethics questions that emerge from this feature. The\nsecond distinctive feature of public health introduced in Section 1 is\nthe prominent role that government action and government power play in\nthe promotion of public health.\n\nSection 2 discusses issues in public health ethics that are\n(primarily) animated by the perspective of justice. Some of these\nissues flow directly from public health\u2019s focus on population\nhealth and the resultant need to aggregate goals and outcomes, as well\nas public health\u2019s special connection to prevention which is\nalso directly connected to its population-level focus. Section 3\ndiscusses issues in public health ethics that are (primarily) animated\nby the perspective of legitimacy. These issues flow from the heavy\nreliance of public health on government action and government\npower.\n",
