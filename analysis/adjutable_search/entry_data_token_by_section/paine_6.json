    "main_text": "Political Theory || Welfare\n2.5 Welfare\n\nIn the final chapter of Rights of Man, Paine addresses the\nexpenditure of the British state and to issues of commerce. Since his\nLetter to the Abbe Raynal (1782), he had expressed a growing\nconfidence in commerce as a means of uniting the interests of nations\nand rendering outdated and irrelevant the European system of war. The\nfinal chapter of Rights of Man develops the same view,\nsuggesting the incompatibility between monarchical regimes and the\ngrowth of commerce and national wealth, and going on to itemize the\ntaxation raised in Britain to support the costs of monarchical wars.\nGiven the new era of peace between nations consequent upon the\nrevolutions in America and France, Paine raises the question of what\nshould be done about the immense sums raised in taxes in Britain (some\n\u00a315.5 millions), suggesting that \u2018whoever has observed the\nmanner in which trade and taxes twist themselves together, must be\nsensible of the impossibility of separating them suddenly\u2019 (CW\nI, 423). Paine then develops a series of welfare proposals that seem\nto have no underlying principle of justice, but are proffered wholly\nas a way of redirecting spending. He advocates that poor relief be\nremoved as a local tax and replaced by central provision from\ngovernment coffers; that pensions be offered for those advanced in\nage, starting at 50, and in full form at 60; that provision be made\nfor the education of the poor; that maternity be benefit be granted to\nall women immediately after the birth of a child; that a fund be\nestablished for the burial of those who die away from home; and that\narrangements be made for the many young people who travel to the\nmetropolis in search of a livelihood to provide initial accommodation\nand support until they find work. Paine ends by identifying provision\nfor those who have served in the army and navy, and suggesting that,\nas demands on the public purse from these sources declines, then items\nof indirect taxation might also be lifted, and the burden of taxation\ngradually shifted towards a progressive taxation on landed property,\ncoupled with the abolition of primogeniture, and a progressive tax on\nthe income from investments. Although certainly influenced by his\nacquaintance with Condorcet and members of the Comit\u00e9 de\nMendicit\u00e9 de la Constituante, this raft of proposals\nrepresents a major innovation on Paine\u2019s part, its slight oddity\nbeing the absence of any clear set of underlying principles for its\njustification.\n",
