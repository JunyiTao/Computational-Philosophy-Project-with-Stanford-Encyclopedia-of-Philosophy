    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics || Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity (1924)\n4.3 Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity (1924)\n\nIn 1921 Reichenbach published a very limited pr\u00e9cis of the\napproach to the theory of relativity he ultimately presented in 1924\n(Reichenbach, 1921d). The Axiomatization is either a work\nvery much out of its time, or the times have not changed much.\nReichenbach\u2019s statement of purpose might have been written at\nany time in the last quarter of the 20th century in response to\nQuine\u2019s holism and to Thomas Kuhn\u2019s incommensurability\nthesis (see the entries on\n belief\n and on\n Thomas Kuhn).\n \n\n\nIt is not easy to arrive at\u2026a judgment with respect to the\naxioms of a theory. Usually the axioms, representing higher levels of\nabstraction, are quite remote from direct sense perception\u2026\n\nIn order to avoid this difficulty\u2026It is possible to start with\nthe observable facts and to end with the abstract\nconceptualization\u2026The empirical character of the axioms [about\nobservables] is immediately evident and it is easy to see what\nconsequences follow from their respective confirmations or\ndisconfirmations.\n\nUnfortunately\u2026every factual statement, even the simplest one,\ncontains more than an immediate perceptual experience: it is already\nan interpretation and therefore itself a theory\u2026The most\nelementary factual statements, therefore, contain some measure of\ntheory\u2026.\n\nDoes there exist any confirmation other than that of the theory as a\nwhole? \u2026Let us assume that the theory by means of which we\nexplain a certain fact is false and is to be replaced by a different\none. It is nevertheless possible that the new theory, when used for\nthe interpretation of this one fact, makes hardly any difference\nquantitatively, whereas it leads to considerable changes with respect\nto other assertions\u2026\n\nThe new theory has merely to satisfy the requirement that it will not\nresult in a practically noticeable quantitative difference when\napplied to these elementary facts\u2026For this reason all axioms of\nour presentation have been chosen in such a way that they can be\nderived from the experiments by means of pre-relativistic\noptics and mechanics. All are facts that can be tested without the\nuse of the theory of relativity\u2026The particular factual\nstatements of the theory of relativity can all be grasped by means of\npre-relativistic conceptions; only their combination within the\nconceptual system is new. (p. 5\u20137)\n\n\nThe book is divided into two parts, one on special relativity and the\nother on general relativity, each in some respects dependent on the\nother. The first part presents a series of postulates about the\nbehavior of light, accompanied by a series of definitions. The\nprimitives are a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are point\nevents and whose edges represent the relation \u201ca signal can be\nsent from event A and received at point B,\u201d\nand a partitioning of the event space by assignment of each event to a\npoint on some real line\u2014intuitively, a world line\u2014such\nthat the set of events assigned to the same line are equicardinal with\nthe line and their ordering by signaling is the ordering of the real\nline, and such that no two such world lines intersect. Axioms about\nthe behavior of signals, especially \u201cfirst\nsignals\u201d\u2014meaning light signals\u2014are intended to\nspecify sufficient constraints so that the coordination determines an\ninertial frame of reference in Minkowski space-time. Extensive\ndiscussion is given over to the impossibility of experimentally\ndetermining a \u201cmetrical\u201d simultaneity relation\u2014that\nis, of finding experimentally a unique simultaneity 3-space for an\ninertially moving observer. \u201cMatter axioms\u201d are then added\nspecifying transport properties of rigid rods and the connection of\nrigid rod distance measurements with round trip time measurements\n(although one of the \u201cmatter axioms,\u201d Axiom VI.2, is\nentirely about clock transport). Reichenbach asserts that the four\nmatter axioms that are restricted to inertial frames follow from his\nlight axioms. That is not true, and 60 pages later Reichenbach\nqualifies the claim to mean only that the relations follow from the\ngeneral theory of relativity. \n\nReichenbach very briefly discusses the classical tests of the general\ntheory of relativity: the red shift of light emitted from the sun, the\nbending of starlight passing near the limb of the sun, and the\nanomalous advance of the perihelion of Mercury. He summarizes:\n\u201c\u2026only the deflection of light and the red shift can\nfurnish evidence for Einstein\u2019s relation between gravitation and\nthe real metric\u2026\u201d (p. 170). A far more enlightening\nanalysis of the bearing of the classical tests had been given by\nHarold Jeffreys in 1919 and taken over (without acknowledgement) by\nArthur Eddington in The Mathematical Theory of Relativity\n(Eddington, 1924); Jeffreys\u2019s approach eventually led to the\nmodern parameterization of metrical theories of gravitation. \n\nThe Axiomatization has three difficulties. It contains a\nmathematical error discovered by John von Neumann in the proof that\ntwo frames of reference satisfying his five light postulates and\ndefinitions could not have a world line at rest in common. Reichenbach\nacknowledged the error in 1925, and again in 1928, without proposing\nany modification to obtain uniqueness. In an unflattering review,\nHerman Weyl gave a second reason (Weyl, 1924; see also Rynasiewicz,\n2005): the light cone structure of Minkowski space time does not\nsuffice to specify a unique set of inertial frames unaccelerated with\nrespect to one another, and hence neither do Reichenbach\u2019s\naxioms. By introducing a singularity in the infinite past, a system of\naccelerated frames can be used. Weyl took this fact to defeat the very\npurpose of Reichenbach\u2019s attempted reconstruction of the\ntheories: to found them on observable relationships. But perhaps the\nmost important problem is that much of Reichenbach\u2019s\nconstruction, without the philosophical commentary, had been\nanticipated by A.A. Robb, first in 1914 (A Theory of Time and\nSpace), and then in 1921 (The Absolute Relations of Time and\nSpace) for both special and general relativity. Reichenbach does\nnot mention Robb in 1924 or, to our knowledge, later, even though\nRobb\u2019s 1921 book was reissued with a different title in 1936.\n\n\nReichenbach\u2019s apparent unfamiliarity at the time with the\nEnglish language literature on relativity is notable and unfortunate.\nHe cites only one essentially English language source, from The\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics, and seems not to know of the\nwork of Jeffreys or Robb. He does appear to have read\nEddington\u2019s 1921 paper on Weyl\u2019s theory. Whatever the\ncause, the Axiomatization, which is one of\nReichenbach\u2019s most original technical efforts, would have been a\ndifferent work, or none at all, had he taken account of those\ndevelopments. \n\nFurther Reading. Section 4.4 of Ryckman (2005) provides a\nmore detailed analysis of what Reichenbach was trying to do in this\nbook. Dieks (2020) contrasts Reichenbach\u2019s and Weyl\u2019s\nfoundations of space and time.\n",
