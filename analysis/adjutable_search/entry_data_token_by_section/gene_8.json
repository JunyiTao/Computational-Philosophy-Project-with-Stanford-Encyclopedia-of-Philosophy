Conclusion\n\nIt became clear that discussions in philosophy of biology are driven\nby developments in biology. At the same time, it appears that there is\nno end to scientific innovation in biology. New technologies open new\nwindows into biological domains, make new phenomena accessible, or\nshed a different light on known entities and processes. These\ndevelopments and the ensuing theoretical shifts and conceptual\ntransformations will require a type of conceptual reflection and\nclarification for which philosophy of science has developed an\nindispensable set of tools (Pradeu et al. forthcoming).\n",
