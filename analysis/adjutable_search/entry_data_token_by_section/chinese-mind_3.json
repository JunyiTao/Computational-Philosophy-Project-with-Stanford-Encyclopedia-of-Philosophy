    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person\n2. Normative conceptions of the person\n\nHow should the heart-mind relate to other parts of the person? What is\nknowing? What is the role of reflective thinking about emotions,\ndesires, etc. as inputs to the heart-mind? These are the questions\nposed in Classical discussions of how to live.\n\nThe tendency in early Chinese Confucianism was to distinguish among\nand to rank parts of the person, with the heart-mind in the lead. The\nleading role is holistic in important ways, involving integration of\nthe perceiving, thinking, desiring, emotional, and intending functions\nof the heart-mind. Further, the resulting conceptions of virtue are of\nexcellence physically embodied and realized in relationship with\nothers.\n\nThe Mohists emphasized the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d especially of\nthe common people and the operation of tools of measurement that\nenable people to come to more reliable agreement in cooperative\narrangements. This focus on measuring fueled their tilt toward\nutilitarianism as the goal of personal and social organization of\nparts.\n\nThe texts that came to be associated with Daoism, the\nDaodejing \u9053\u5fb7\u7d93 and the Zhuangzi,\ntreat the heart-mind as only part of the process of de\n\u5fb7 (practical competence) of political leaders, artisans,\ngymnasts, and philosophers. Knowing how to live involves a combination\nof wisdom, skill, and disciplined engagement of emotion and desire. In\nthe Daodejing, the heart-mind\u2019s conduit of guidance\nfunction is often treated as emptiness and stillness to attune and be\nresponsive to an external path dao \u9053, path or way to\nlive in the natural cosmos. Human dao is a part of a holistic\nnatural dao that accounts for the emergence and guidance of\nall natural kinds.\n\nIn the Zhuangzi, this sometimes takes the form of demoting\nthe heart-mind\u2019s role in favor of a more egalitarian involvement\nof all parts of a person\u2019s system of qi (conceived as\npervading all the organs, not just in the heart-mind). The full body\nachieves attunement and responsiveness to the world\u2014as in skills\nranging from archery to wheelmaking to cicada catching.\n\nThe Xunzi builds on previous Confucian ideas about hierarchy\nwithin the person, but also incorporates ideas from Zhuangzi as well\nas implicitly taking from their pragmatic conception of knowing and\nexplicitly replying to Mohist reformism and Daoist skepticism of past\nmodels of music and ritual.\n",
