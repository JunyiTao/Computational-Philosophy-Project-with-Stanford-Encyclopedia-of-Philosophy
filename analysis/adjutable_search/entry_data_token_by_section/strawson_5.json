    "main_text": "The Bounds of Sense\n6. The Bounds of Sense\n\nIn 1966, seven years after the publication of Individuals\nStrawson published his third book, The Bounds of Sense,\nsubtitled An essay on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason.\n\nStrawson\u2019s introduction to Kant arose out of the historical\npeculiarities of Oxford\u2019s degree in Philosophy, Politics and\nEconomics. At that time, the degree was structured such that there\nwere two special subjects which those who wished to specialise in\nphilosophy were obliged to take: Logic and Kant, the latter to be\nstudied through the Critique of Pure Reason and the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. In the Critique\nof Pure Reason, Strawson found \u2018a depth, a range, a\nboldness, and a power unlike anything I had previously\nencountered\u2019 (Strawson 2003, 8).\n\nStrawson lacks sympathy with Kant\u2019s description of his task as\nthe explanation of the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements.\nHis approach to the first Critique is instead captured by his\ncharacteristically elegant title which contains a three-fold pun.\nFirst, it is an echo of a title that Kant considered for the\nCritique. Second and third, it plays on the ambiguity of the\nword \u2018sense\u2019 which can denote both sense-experience and\nsense-meaning. According to Strawson, Kant sets a lower limit on\nsense, arguing that \u2018a certain minimal structure is essential to\nany conception of experience which we can make truly intelligible to\nourselves\u2019 (1966, 11). And he sets an upper limit on sense,\nholding \u2018that the attempt to extend beyond the limits of\nexperience the use of structural concepts, or of any other concepts,\nleads only to claims empty of meaning\u2019. Finally, he does all of\nthis from \u2018a point outside [the bounds of sense], a point which,\nif they are rightly drawn, cannot exist\u2019 (1966, 12). This point\noutside the bounds of sense is Kant\u2019s metaphysics of\ntranscendental idealism and the \u2018imaginary subject of\ntranscendental psychology\u2019 (1966, 32). Strawson\u2019s analytic\nproject is to extract what is valuable of the first two strands from\nthe supposed incoherence of the last.\n\nWith regards to the lower limit of sense and the constructive part of\nthe first Critique, Strawson examines Kant\u2019s argument\nthat our experience must be of recognisably independent objective\nitems, which are spatial and temporal, and which must satisfy some\nstrong principles of permanence and causation. Strawson argues, with\nboth care and brilliance, that Kant\u2019s arguments are defective in\nvarious ways, but that somewhat weaker, yet nonetheless important,\nconclusions along similar lines can be defended. The most fecund and\nbrilliant part of Strawson\u2019s argument, and the part which has\ncorrespondingly attracted the most attention, is Strawson\u2019s take\non Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, in which\nStrawson argues that \u2018for a series of diverse experiences to\nbelong to a single consciousness it is necessary that they should be\nso connected as to constitute a temporally extended experience of a\nunified objective world\u2019 (1966, 97). That is, the experience of\na self-conscious creature must involve, and be recognised as\ninvolving, perception of objects. Strawson\u2019s reconstruction of\nthe argument relies on the idea that the experiences of a\nself-conscious creature must provide room for the thought of\nexperience itself. But one can apply that notion only in the context\nof the application of categories of things which are not experiences.\nHowever, such categories can be available to a subject only if its\nexperiences provide it with the grounds for applying them, which\ninvolves the idea that its experiences relate it to non-experiences,\nthat is to say, independent things. This argument is discussed in\nRorty 1970, Harrison 1970, and Gomes 2016.\n\nWith regards to the upper limit to sense and the destructive part of\nthe first Critique, Strawson examines Kant\u2019s arguments\nin the Dialectic, and develops further requirements on our conception\nof experience analogous to those Kant advances. The discussion of the\nParalogisms is particularly important for Strawson, containing, as he\nsees it, a deep insight about the failures of Cartesian dualism. Kant\ndoesn\u2019t combine, according to Strawson, this recognition of the\nfailures of dualism with a correspondingly accurate account of\nourselves, but this failure is to be explained by Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism, and once shorn of this theory, Kant\u2019s\nview is able to be supplemented with a plausible and realistic account\nof ourselves.\n\nFinally, Strawson considers Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, and\nthough he is ultimately unsympathetic, he explores its interpretation\nwith great care and considers why Kant might have adopted it. One\nissue which he presses is whether there is a coherent way to fit\nourselves as objects into a framework of transcendental idealism,\ngiven Kant\u2019s seeming view that real objects, things in\nthemselves, are unknowable and beyond our experience. The rejection of\ntranscendental idealism requires Strawson to scrutinize Kant\u2019s\narguments for it, and he very carefully and sympathetically analyses\nand rejects Kant\u2019s arguments about space and time, and geometry,\nand also the argument, presented in the Antinomies, that\ntranscendental realism generates contradictions. Strawson further\nabandons much of Kant\u2019s talk of mechanisms of synthesis in the\ngeneration of proper experience. Much of Strawson\u2019s discussion\nhere relies on his particular interpretation of transcendental\nidealism, which has been heavily criticised, for instance in Matthews\n1969.\n\nThe Bounds of Sense had an immediate impact and continues to\nbe extremely influential. Its interpretation of Kant quickly became a\ntarget of discussion in Kant scholarship, and Strawson returned to\nsome issues of Kant interpretation in four essays which are collected\nin Strawson 1997. But it also, as Putnam remarks, \u2018opened the\nway to a reception of Kant\u2019s philosophy by analytic\nphilosophers\u2019 (Putnam 1998 in Hahn 1998, 273). One particular\nfocus has been on Strawson\u2019s use of a style of argument which he\ntook Kant himself to have developed. These arguments have come to be\ncalled \u2018transcendental arguments\u2019. In Individuals\nand The Bounds of Sense they take the form of uncovering\ndependencies in our ways of thinking of the world. These dependencies\ncan be taken to have anti-sceptical implications if claims about which\nthe sceptic is sceptical can be shown to be required for the\njudgements which the sceptic makes, or ones which are involved in the\nsceptic\u2019s own understanding of their view. In the years\nfollowing its publication this anti-sceptical response was closely\ninvestigated, a large literature on it was generated, including\nnotably a number of powerful contributions by the American philosopher\nBarry Stroud. (See Stroud 1968 and 2000.) One problem is that it is\nextraordinarily difficult to show that there are the conceptual\ndependencies which such transcendental arguments rely on.\nInterestingly, Strawson himself soon devised a different response to\nscepticism, but it is also true that the anti-sceptical approach that\nStrawson developed here remains appealing to a range of\nepistemologists, and this debate continues. Some discussion of the\nprospects for such arguments can be found in Stern 1999 and Gomes\n2017a.\n\nSome issues that have been raised about The Bounds of Sense\nare the following: (1) Does Strawson himself provide a satisfactory\nidentification of a good question that Kant\u2019s Critique\ncan be regarded as trying to answer? At about the same time that\nStrawson published his book on Kant, Jonathan Bennett, in his book\nKant\u2019s Analytic suggested that Kant\u2019s claims have\nto be regarded as unobviously analytic if they are to be correct. Is\nStrawson\u2019s conception better than this? (2) Is Strawson\u2019s\ninterpretation of Kant \u2013 especially his account of\ntranscendental idealism \u2013 correct? (3) Does Strawson\u2019s\nversion of Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories\nfare any better than Kant\u2019s own? (4) Is Strawson right to think\nthat there are insights in Kant\u2019s project that can be separated\nfrom his transcendental idealism? And (5) does Strawson defend the\nanti-sceptical transcendental arguments cogently? Strawson\u2019s\nrelation to Kant is discussed in Glock 2003, Gomes 2017b, and the\npapers collected in a special issue of the European Journal of\nPhilosophy (2016) marking the 50th anniversary of The Bounds\nof Sense.\n",
