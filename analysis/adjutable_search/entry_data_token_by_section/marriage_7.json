    "main_text": "The Politics of Marriage || The Rationale of Marriage Law\n4.2 The Rationale of Marriage Law\n\nAs noted, a rationale must be given for marriage law which explains\nthe restrictions placed on entry and exit, the allocation of resources\nto marriage, and legal discrimination on the basis of it. The next\nsection will examine gender restrictions on entry; this section will\nexamine reasons for recognizing marriage in law at all, allocating\nresources to it, and constraining property division on divorce.\n\nA first reason for recognizing marriage should be set aside. This is\nthat the monogamous heterosexual family unit is a natural,\npre-political structure which the state must respect in the form in\nwhich it finds it (Morse 2006; cf. new natural lawyers, Girgis et al.\n2010). But, whatever the natural reproductive unit may be, marriage\nlaw, as legislation, is constrained by principles of justice\nconstraining legislation. Within most contemporary political\nphilosophy, the naturalness of a given practice is irrelevant; indeed,\nin no area other than the family is it proposed that law should follow\nnature (with the possible exception of laws regarding suicide).\nFinally, such objections must answer to feminist concerns that\nexcluding the family unit from principles of justice, allowing natural\naffection to regulate it, has facilitated inequality and abuse within\nit (see section 5).\n\nLet us then begin with the question of why marriage should be\nrecognized in law at all. One answer is that legal recognition conveys\nthe state\u2019s endorsement, guiding individuals into a valuable\nform of life (George 2000). A second is that legal recognition is\nnecessary to maintain and protect social support for the institution,\na valuable form of life which would otherwise erode (Raz 1986, 162,\n392\u20133; Scruton 1986, 356\u2013361; see discussion in Waldron\n1988\u201389). But this prompts the question as to why this form of\nlife is valuable.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that traditions, having stood the test of time,\nhave proved their value. Not only is marriage itself such a tradition,\nbut through its child-rearing role it can pass on other traditions\n(Sommers 1989, Scruton 1986, 356\u2013361, cf. Devlin 1965, Chapter\n4). But many marital traditions\u2014coverture, gender-structured\nlegal duties, marital rape exemptions, inter-racial marriage\nbans\u2014have been unjust. Tradition provides at best a prima\nfacie reason for legislation which may be overridden by\nconsiderations of justice. Further, in a diverse society, there are\nmany competing traditions, amongst which this rationale fails to\nchoose (Garrett 2008).\n\nAn account of the value of a particular form of marriage itself (and\nnot just qua tradition) is needed. One thought is that\nmonogamous marriage encourages the sexual self-control needed for\nhealth and happiness; another is that it encourages the goods of love\nand intimacy found in committed relationships. State support for\nmonogamous marriage, by providing incentives to enter marital\ncommitments, thus helps people lead better lives (e.g. Macedo 1995,\n286). However, this approach faces objections. First, the explanation\nin terms of emotional goods underdetermines the institution to be\nsupported: other relationships, such as friendships, embody emotional\ngoods. Second, claims about the value of sexual self-control are\ncontroversial; objectors might argue that polygamy, polyamory, or\npromiscuity are equally good options (see 5.2). There is a further\nproblem with this justification, which speaks to a division within\nliberal thought. Some liberals embrace neutrality, the view that the\nstate should not base law on controversial judgments about what\nconstitutes valuable living. To such neutral liberals, this class of\nrationales, which appeal to controversial value judgments about sex\nand love, must be excluded (Rawls 1997, 779). Some theorists have\nsought to develop rationales consistent with political liberalism,\narguing, for instance, that the intimate dyadic marital relationship\nprotects autonomy (Bennett 2003), or that some form of marriage could\nbe justified by its efficiency in providing benefits (Toop 2019) or\nits role in protecting diverse caring relationships (Brake 2012),\nfragile romantic love relationships (Cave 2017), or caregivers and\nchildren (Hartley and Watson 2012, Toop 2019; see also May 2016,\nWedgwood 2016).\n\nIt is widely accepted that the state should protect children. If\ntwo-parent families benefit children, incentives to marry may be\njustified as promoting two-parent families and hence children\u2019s\nwelfare. One benefit of two-parent families is economic: there is a\ncorrelation between single motherhood and poverty. Another benefit is\nemotional: children appear to benefit from having two parents (Galston\n1991, 283\u2013288). (Moreover, some argue that gender\ncomplementarity in parenting benefits children; but empirical evidence\ndoes not seem to support this [Lee 2008, Nussbaum 1999, 205, Manning\net al., 2014].)\n\nOne objection to this line of argument is that marriage is an\nineffective child anti-poverty plan. For one thing, this account\nassumes that incentives to marry will lead a significant number of\nparents who would not otherwise have married to marry. But marriage\nand child-rearing have increasingly diverged despite incentives to\nmarry. Second, this approach does not address the many children\noutside marriages and in poor two-parent families. Child poverty could\nbe addressed more efficiently through direct anti-child-poverty\nprograms rather than the indirect strategy of marriage (Cave 2004;\nVanderheiden 1999; Young 1995). Moreover, there is controversy over\nthe psychological effects of single parenthood, particularly over the\ncausality underlying certain correlations: for instance, are children\nof divorce unhappier due to divorce itself, or to the high-conflict\nmarriage preceding it? (Young 1995) Indeed, some authors have recently\nargued that children might be better protected by legally separating\nmarriage from parenting: freestanding parenting frameworks would be\nmore durable than marriage (which can end in divorce), would protect\nchildren outside of marriages, and would accommodate new family forms\nsuch as three-parent families (Brennan and Cameron 2016, Shrage 2018;\nsee also Chan and Cutas 2012).\n\nA related, but distinct, line of thought invokes the alleged\npsychological effects of two-parent families to argue that marriage\nbenefits society by promoting good citizenship and state stability\n(Galston 1991, 283\u2013288). This depends on the empirical case (as\nwe have seen, a contested one) that children of single parents face\npsychological and economic hurdles which threaten their capacity to\nacquire the virtues of citizenship. Moreover, if economic dependence\nproduces power inequality within marriage, then Mill\u2019s\n\u2018school of injustice\u2019 objection applies\u2014an\ninstitution teaching injustice is likely to undermine the virtues of\ncitizenship (Okin 1994, Young 1995).\n\nFinally, a rationale for restricting the terms of exit from marriage\n(but not for supporting it as a form of life) is the protection of\nwomen and children following divorce. Women in gender-structured\nmarriages, particularly if they have children, tend to become\neconomically vulnerable. Statistically, married women are more likely\nthan their husbands to work in less well-paid part-time work, or to\ngive up paid work entirely, especially to meet the demands of\nchild-rearing. Thus, following divorce, women are likely to have a\nreduced standard of living, even to enter poverty. Because these\npatterns of choice within marriages lead to inequalities between men\nand women, property division on divorce is a matter of equality or\nequal opportunity, and so a just law of divorce is essential to gender\njustice (Okin 1989, Chapters 7 and 8; Rawls 1997, 787\u2013794;\nShanley 2004, 3\u201330; Waldron 1988, and see 5.1). However, it can\nstill be asked why a law recognizing marriage as such should be\nnecessary, as opposed to default rules governing property distribution\nwhen such gender-structured relationships end (Sunstein and Thaler\n2008, Chambers 2017). Indeed, placing these restrictions only on\nmarriage, as opposed to enacting general default rules, may make\nmarriage less attractive, especially to men, and hence be\ncounter-productive, leaving women more vulnerable.\n\nThe preceding two rationales are both weakened by the diminished\nsocial role of marriage; changing legal and social norms undermine its\neffectiveness as a policy tool. In the 20th century,\nmarriage was beset by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d: the expectation\nthat it should be emotionally fulfilling, women\u2019s liberation,\nand effective contraception (Coontz 2006, Chapter 16). Legally, exit\nfrom marriage has become relatively easy since the \u2018no-fault\ndivorce revolution\u2019 of the 1970\u2019s. Moreover, cohabitation\nand child-rearing increasingly take place outside marriage. This\nreflects the end of laws against unmarried cohabitation and legal\ndiscrimination against children on grounds of\n\u2018illegitimacy\u2019, as well as diminishing social stigmas\nagainst such behavior. Given such significant changes, marriage is at\nbest an indirect strategy for achieving goals such as protecting women\nor children (Cave 2004, Sunstein and Thaler 2008, Vanderheiden\n1999).\n\nSome theorists have argued, in the absence of a compelling rationale\nfor marriage law, for abolishing marriage altogether, replacing it\nwith civil unions or domestic partnerships. This line of thought will\nbe taken up in 4.4, after an examination of the debate over same-sex\nmarriage.\n",
