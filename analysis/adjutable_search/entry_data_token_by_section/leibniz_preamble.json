    "main_text": "\n\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) was one of the great\nthinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is known as\nthe last \u201cuniversal genius\u201d. He made deep and important\ncontributions to the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, logic,\nphilosophy of religion, as well as mathematics, physics, geology,\njurisprudence, and history. Even the eighteenth-century French atheist\nand materialist Denis Diderot, whose views were very often at odds\nwith those of Leibniz, could not help being awed by his achievement,\nwriting in his entry on Leibniz in the Encyclopedia,\n\u201cPerhaps never has a man read as much, studied as much,\nmeditated more, and written more than Leibniz\u2026 What he has\ncomposed on the world, God, nature, and the soul is of the most\nsublime eloquence. If his ideas had been expressed with the flair of\nPlato, the philosopher of Leipzig would cede nothing to the\nphilosopher of Athens\u201d (Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes,\nvol. 7, p. 709). Indeed, Diderot was almost moved to despair in this\npiece: \u201cWhen one compares the talents one has with those of a\nLeibniz, one is tempted to throw away one's books and go die quietly\nin the dark of some forgotten corner\u201d (Oeuvres\ncompl\u00e8tes, vol. 7, p. 678). More than a century later,\nGottlob Frege, who fortunately did not cast his books away in despair,\nexpressed similar admiration, declaring that \u201cin his writings,\nLeibniz threw out such a profusion of seeds of ideas that in this\nrespect he is virtually in a class of his own\u201d (\u201cBoole's\nlogical Calculus and the Concept-script\u201d in\nPosthumous Writings, p. 9). The aim of this entry is primarily\nto introduce Leibniz's life and summarize and explicate his views\nin the realms of metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology.\n\n\nNote that throughout this entry, the following standard abbreviations\nare used: PC (Principle of Contradiction), PSR (Principle of\nSufficient Reason), PII (Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles), PIN (Predicate-in-Notion Principle), and CIC\n(Complete Individual Concept).\n",
