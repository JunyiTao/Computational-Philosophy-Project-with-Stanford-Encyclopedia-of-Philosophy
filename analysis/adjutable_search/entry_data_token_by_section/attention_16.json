    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention and Voluntary Action\n3.5 Attention and Voluntary Action\n\nAttention\u2019s involvement in voluntary action is a lot\nharder to study in a controlled experiment than its involvement in\nperception. The theories of attention emerging from experimental\npsychology have, as a result, focused almost exclusively on\nattention\u2019s perceptual instances. In this respect they contrast\nwith theories that were developed in the period before psychology and\nphilosophy split, in which the action-involving aspects of attention\nwere much more prominent. William James, for example, suggests in the\nPrinciples of Psychology that \u2018volition is nothing but\nattention\u2019 (James, 1890 p. 424), and at one time (in what might\nbe read as an anticipation of the competition-based theories discussed\nabove, in\n \u00a72.6)\n he proposed that \u201cAttention, belief, affirmation, and motor\nvolition, are [\u2026] four names for an identical process,\nincidental to the conflict of ideas alone, the survival of one in\nspite of the opposition of the others.\u201d (1880).\n\nThe issues surrounding attention\u2019s relationship to the\nvoluntariness of action are parallel to some of the issues surrounding\nattention\u2019s relationship to the consciousness of perception. It\nseems natural to think that attention is necessary for the voluntary\nperformance of finely tuned behaviours, much as it seems necessary for\nthe conscious perception of fine detail. But it does not seem natural\nto think that we must be paying attention to the execution of every\nact that we voluntarily perform, any more than it seem natural to\nsuppose that we must pay attention in order to be consciously\nperceiving anything at all. A case could therefore be made, on\ncommonsense grounds, for claiming that attention figures in the\nproduction of some but not all voluntary behaviours. One can imagine\nthis view being challenged by a theorist who claimed that attention is\nnecessary for any action to be voluntary, arguing that there is an\nillusion (analogous to the refrigerator light illusion) that gives us\nthe mistaken impression that our inattentive acts are voluntary too.\nAs in the case of attention and consciousness, there is a\nmethodological puzzle (with epistemologically deep roots) about the\nsort of evidence that could settle this issue. This may be a topic for\nfuture research. While resisting the idea that attention is either\nnecessary or sufficient for an act to be voluntary, Denis Buehler has\nargued that there is a central role for attention in the explanation\nof flexible goal-directed behaviour (Buehler, 2019). In cases where\nthat behaviour involves the exercise of a skill, Alex Dayer and\nCarolyn Jennings have argued against the idea that any simple account\nof attention\u2019s role in it can be given, claiming that a theory\nof attention\u2019s role in skilled performance must instead be\n\u2018pluralist\u2019 (Dayer & Jennings, 2021).\n\nThe separation of attention\u2019s role in action from\nattention\u2019s role in perception is somewhat artificial,\nespecially when the perception in question is perception of\none\u2019s own moving body. Psychological research into that\nparticular form of perception has been largely independent of research\ninto the role of attention in vision and audition. A 2016 paper by\nGregor Hochstetter reviews the research into this bodily case, and\nargues, following Marcel Kinsbourne (1995, 2002) that internal\nrepresentation of a \u2018body image\u2019 must play some role in\nguiding attention during normal bodily awareness (Hochstetter,\n2016).\n4 Attention and Value\n\nAttention\u2019s contribution to our understanding of values has been\nrelatively underexplored in the recent literature. The range of\nvalue-theoretic contexts in which attention makes an explanatorily\nsignificant appearance is nonetheless broad.\n",
