    "main_text": "Coherentism Versus Foundationalism\n1. Coherentism Versus Foundationalism\n\nA central problem in epistemology is to explain when we are justified in holding\na proposition to be true. It is not at all evident what epistemic\njustification is, and classical accounts of that notion have turned\nout to be severely problematic. A tradition inspired by Descartes holds that justified beliefs are those that are either self-evidently true or deduced from self-evident truths.  But, as is often argued, little of what we\ntake ourselves to justifiably believe satisfies these austere\nconditions: many of our apparently justified beliefs, it is commonly\nthought, are neither based on self-evident truths nor derivable in a\nstrict logical sense from other things we believe in. Thus, the\nCartesian rationalist picture of justification seems far too\nrestrictive. Similar problems hound empiricist attempts to ground all\nour knowledge in the allegedly indubitable data of the senses.\nDepending on how they are understood, sense data are either not\nindubitable or else not informative enough to justify a sufficient\nportion of our purported knowledge. The exact characterization of\nfoundationalism is a somewhat contentious issue. There is another form\nof foundationalism according to which some beliefs have some\nnon-doxastic source of epistemic support that requires no support of\nits own. This support can be defeasible and it can require\nsupplementation to be strong enough for knowledge. This sort of\nnon-doxastic support would terminate the regress of justification. To\ndo so it may not have to appeal to self-evidence, indubitability or\ncertainty. Such foundationalist views vary on the source of the\nnon-doxastic support, how strong the support is on its own, and what\nrole in justification coherence plays, if any. Some critics of this\nposition have questioned the intelligibility of the non-doxastic\nsupport relation. Thus, Davidson (1986) complains that advocates have\nbeen unable to explain the relation between experience and belief that\nallows the first to justify the second.\n\nThe difficulties pertaining to both rationalism and empiricism about\njustification have led many epistemologists to think that there must\nbe something fundamentally wrong with the way in which the debate has\nbeen framed, prompting their rejection of the foundationalist\njustificatory structure underlying rationalism and empiricism alike.\nRather than conceiving the structure of our knowledge on the model of\nEuclidean geometry, with its basic axioms and derived theorems, these\nepistemologists favor a holistic picture of justification which does\nnot distinguish between basic or foundational and non-basic or derived\nbeliefs, treating rather all our beliefs as equal members of a\n\u201cweb of belief\u201d (Quine and Ullian 1970, cf. Neurath\n1983/1932 and Sosa 1980).\n\nThe mere rejection of foundationalism is not itself an alternative\ntheory because it leaves us with no positive account of justification,\nsave a suggestive metaphor about webs of belief. A more substantial\ncontrasting proposal is that what justifies our beliefs is ultimately\nthe way in which they hang together or dovetail so as to produce a\ncoherent set. As Davidson puts it, \u201c[w]hat distinguishes a\ncoherence theory is simply the claim that nothing can count as a\nreason for a belief except another belief\u201d (Davidson, 1986). The\nfact that our beliefs cohere can establish their truth, even though\neach individual belief may lack justification entirely if considered\nin splendid isolation, or so it is thought. Following C. I. Lewis\n(1946), some proponents think of this situation as analogous to how\nagreeing testimonies in court can lead to a verdict although each\ntestimony by itself would be insufficient for that purpose.\n\nThere is a serious objection that any coherence theory of\njustification or knowledge must immediately face. It is called the\nisolation objection: how can the mere fact that a system is\ncoherent, if the latter is understood as a purely system-internal\nmatter, provide any guidance whatsoever to truth and reality? Since\na coherence theory, in its basic form, does not assign any essential role to experience, there is\nlittle reason to think that a coherent system of belief will\naccurately reflect the external world. A variation on this theme is\npresented by the equally notorious alternative systems\nobjection. For each coherent system of beliefs there exist,\nconceivably, other systems that are equally coherent yet incompatible\nwith the first system. If coherence is sufficient for justification,\nthen all these incompatible systems would be justifiably held. But this\nobservation, of course, thoroughly undermines any claim suggesting\nthat coherence is indicative of truth.\n\nAs we shall see, most, if not all, influential coherence theorists try\nto avoid these traditional objections by assigning some beliefs that\nare close to experience a special role, whether they are called\n\u201csupposed facts asserted\u201d (Lewis, 1946),\n\u201ctruth-candidates\u201d (Rescher, 1973), \u201ccognitively\nspontaneous beliefs\u201d (BonJour, 1985) or something else.\nDepending on how this special role is construed, these theories are often\nclassified as versions of weak\nfoundationalism. An advocate of\nweak foundationalism typically holds that while coherence is incapable\nof justifying beliefs from scratch, it can provide justification for\nbeliefs that already have some initial, perhaps minuscule, degree of\nwarrant, e.g., for observational beliefs.\n\nA fair number of distinguished contemporary philosophers have declared\nthat they advocate a coherence theory of justification. Apart from\nthis superficial fact, these theories often address some rather\ndiverse issues loosely united by the fact that they in one way or the\nother take a holistic approach to the justification of beliefs. Here\nare some of the problems and questions that have attracted the\nattention of coherence theorists (cf. Bender, 1989):\n\nHow can a regress of justification be avoided?\nHow can we gain knowledge given that our information sources\n(senses, testimony etc) are not reliable?\nHow can we know anything at all given that we do not even know\nwhether our own beliefs or memories are reliable?\nGiven a set of beliefs and a new piece of information (typically\nan observation), when is a person justified in accepting that\ninformation?\nWhat should a person believe if confronted with a possibly\ninconsistent set of data?\n\n\nThe fact that these separate, though related, issues are not always\nclearly distinguished presents a challenge to the reader of the\nrelevant literature.\n\nAlthough the regress problem is not a central contemporary issue, it\nis helpful to explain coherence theories as responses to the problem.\nThis will also serve to illustrate some challenges that a coherence\ntheory faces. We will then turn to the concept of coherence itself as\nthat concept is traditionally conceived. Unfortunately, not all\nprominent authors associated with the coherence theory use the term\ncoherence in this traditional sense, and the section that follows is\ndevoted to such non-standard coherence theories. The arguably most\nsystematic and prolific discussion of the coherence theory of\njustification has focused on the relationship between coherence and\nprobability. The rest of this entry will be devoted to this\ndevelopment, which took off in the mid-1990s inspired by seminal work\nby C. I. Lewis (1946). The development has given us precise and\nsophisticated definitions of coherence as well as detailed studies of\nthe relationship between coherence and truth (probability),\nculminating in some potentially disturbing impossibility results that\nshed doubt on the possibility of defining coherence in a way that\nmakes it indicative of truth. More precise descriptions of key\nentailments of these results, and ways to address the worries that\nthey raise, will be discussed in later sections of this entry.\n",
