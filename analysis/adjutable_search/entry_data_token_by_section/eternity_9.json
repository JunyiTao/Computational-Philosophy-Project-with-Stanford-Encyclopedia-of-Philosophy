    "main_text": "Arguments against Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Divine Omniscience and Tensed Facts\n5.1 Arguments from Divine Omniscience and Tensed Facts\n\nRecall that the theistic God is omniscient. Presumably then, God knows\nwhat temporal reality is like at its most fundamental. If there are\nfundamental tensed facts (like that it\u2019s 12:00), God knows them.\nBut since these facts change, what God knows changes constantly. So\nGod changes constantly; so God is in time.\n\nArgument 1\n\n(1)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows the fundamental temporal\nfacts.\nSo (3)\nGod knows the fundamental temporal facts. (From (1), (2))\nSo (4)\nif there are fundamental tensed facts (i.e. the A-theory is true),\nthen God knows them. (From (3))\n(5)\nIf God knows fundamental tensed facts, then what God knows\nchanges.\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, if the A-theory is true, then God is temporal. (From (4),\n(5), (6), (7))\n\n\nVarious versions of this argument have been defended (Craig 2000,\n2001; DeWeese 2004; Hasker 2002; Kretzmann 1966; Padgett 1992, 2001;\nWolterstorff 1975; Mullins 2016: Ch. 4). Since many participants of\nthe debate think the A-theory is true, it is treated as an argument\nfor divine temporality. In response, advocates of timelessness\nchallenge one or more of the argument\u2019s premises (Wierenga 1989,\n2002; Alston 1989a; Ganssle 1993, 1995, 2002). Others respond by giving up\non the A-theory and accepting the B-theory (Helm 1988, 2001; Rogers\n2000). The thought is that this argument can\u2019t be run for the\nB-theory, since on the B-theory, the fundamental (tenseless) temporal\nfacts don\u2019t change. The parallel argument would get stuck at the\nanalogue of step (5): it\u2019s not the case that if God knows\nfundamental tenseless facts, then what God knows changes. So while the\nargument itself is silent on whether the B-theory allows one to\ncombine timelessness with omniscience, part of the point of making it\nis that the parallel argument can\u2019t be run for the B-theory.\n\nOne might, however, wonder whether there are arguments in the vicinity\nof Argument 1 that can be run on the B-theory too. Consider first the\nfollowing, somewhat similar argument.\n\nArgument 2\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2032)\nWhat time it is changes.\nSo (5\u2032)\nWhat God knows changes. (From (3\u2032), (4\u2032))\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5\u2032), (6), (7))\n\n\nUnlike in the case of Argument 1, the connection to the A-theory here\nis not straightforward. There is certainly a sense in which (4\u2032)\nis true on the B-theory, even though there is, on the B-theory, no\nchange in the fundamental temporal facts. At each time, that time is\npresent\u2014not in the absolute, metaphysically privileged sense of\nthe A-theory, but in a relative, perspectival sense. Each time is\npresent at itself, just like each spatial location is here relative to\nitself. Moreover, on a standard B-theoretic account of tensed language\n(e.g., Mozersky 2015; but see Torre 2010 for an alternative account),\nat each of those times, a temporal subject S can know, and have\na true belief about, what time it is. At noon, S believes that\nit is noon; that belief is made true by a tenseless fact, such as that\nS holds the belief at (a time simultaneous with) noon. At\n12:01, S believes truly that it is 12:01, where this belief is\nmade true by another tenseless fact, such as that this later belief is\nheld by S at (a time simultaneous with) 12:01, and so on.\n\nAdmittedly, it is not the case, on this B-theoretic account, that knowing\nwhat time it is (at different times) involves knowing different things\nat different times. The reason is that the tenseless contents that are\nbelieved can be believed by S at all times equally (and typically\nwill be). So while, at each time, S has a tensed belief with a\ntenseless content that differs from the tenseless content of\nS\u2019s tensed beliefs at previous times, S may not\ncome to believe, or know, anything new. This suggests that the same\napplies to God, and that (5\u2032) doesn\u2019t follow from\n(3\u2032) and (4\u2032).\n\nHowever, what matters is not just what S knows and\nbelieves, but how S knows and believes it. Tensed\nbeliefs have rather different cognitive significance from the\ncorresponding tenseless ones. What matters for timely action is\nbelieving the tenseless content via a tensed representation, by having\na true tensed belief (\u201cit is noon (now)\u201d). The point is a\nmore general one that applies equally to indexicals other than\n\u201cnow\u201d, such as \u201cI\u201d or \u201chere\u201d: the\ncognitive significance of indexical beliefs differs from that of the\ncorresponding non-indexical ones.\n\nTherefore, if a B-theoretic subject S knows (at more than one\ntime) what time it is, then they undergo changes. The reason is that\nhow they believe what they believe changes. They need to keep track of\ntheir temporal perspective by having appropriately varied tensed\nbeliefs (\u201cit\u2019s noon\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s\n12:01\u201d). At least this is so for anyone whose temporal nature\nrelevantly resembles our own. Does this group include God? If so, then\non the B-theory too, there is reason to worry about the combination of\nomniscience with timelessness.\n\nArgument 3\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2033)\nIf S knows what time it is, then how S believes\n(what S believes) changes.\n(5\u2033)\nHow God believes (what God believes) changes. (From (3\u2032),\n(4\u2033))\n(6\u2033)\nIf how God believes changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal.
