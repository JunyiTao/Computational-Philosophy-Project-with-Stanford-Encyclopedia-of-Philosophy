    "main_text": "Analyzing the Concept of Recognition || Recognition and its Neighboring Concepts\n1.1 Recognition and its Neighboring Concepts\n\n\nPaul Ricoeur has distinguished as many as 23 different usages of the\nnotion \u201cto recognize\u201d (Ricoeur 2005, 5\u201316) grouping them\nunder three main categories, namely recognition as identification,\nrecognizing oneself and mutual recognition. Many authors have\nchallenged Ricoeur\u2019s view by proposing a distinction between\nrecognition (of oneself as well as of others) and\n\u201cidentification\u201d: Whereas we identify an X as an X without\nnecessarily affirming it as (and because of) X, recognition requires a\npositive evaluation of X. The term \u201cacknowledgment\u201d which\nsome authors use interchangeably with recognition (Appiah 1992, 149) is\nalso contested. Whereas some have argued that we acknowledge the\nvalidity of certain insights, values and norms\n(Ik\u00e4heimo/Laitinen 2007, 34\u201337), others continue to use the term\n\u201cacknowledgment\u201d with regard to persons but intend it to\ndenote something less ambitious than the wholesale affirmation of their\nspecific identity (Cavell 1969; Markell 2003). However, it is the\nmeaning of mutual recognition that lies at the heart of the\ncontemporary discussion.\n\n\nMutuality has always served as the explanatory and normative core of\nthe concept of recognition. Most theories draw on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel who\nwas, in turn, heavily influenced by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (for their\ncommon roots in Jean-Jacques Rousseau see Neuhouser 2008). According to\nFichte we become conscious of our own autonomy by being challenged\u2014or as Fichte would characterize it: \u201ccalled upon\u201d\u2014by the actions of another subject. Only by understanding that\nthe other\u2019s actions are intentional can we also grasp our own\nactions and utterances as expressions of an intentional self. This\nthought is most famously expressed in Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology\nof Spirit where this interpersonal encounter logically culminates\nin a struggle of life and death (see esp. Koj\u00e8ve 1947 whose\nreading strongly influenced Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Lacan; also\nthe contributions in O\u2019Neill 1996). Within the\nPhenomenology this idea is first and foremost a thesis about\nhow we can gain self-consciousness as autonomous agents,\nnamely only by interacting with other autonomous subjects (see in more\ndetail 2.1 below). However, this idea also leads Hegel to consider the\nimportance of differing forms of mutual recognition. Already in his\nearly writings in the Jena Realphilosophie of 1805/06 Hegel\nexpands the Fichtean motif by referring to the Hobbesian idea of a\nfundamental struggle\u2014albeit not of self-interest but of\nrecognition. In Hegel\u2019s story of the state of nature social\nrelationships are a (perhaps forgotten) given: A person who attacks\nyour property does not primarily want to gain material goods. Rather,\nshe wishes to remind you, the first possessor, that she is a person\nwith moral standing as well who has been neglected by the act of first acquisition (Siep 1979, 39; Honneth 1992, 44\u201345). As becomes\nespecially clear in the Phenomenology: By fighting against the\nother the subject wants to affirm her own freedom by proving that her\nnormative status is of more importance to her than any of her (animal)\ndesires, including\u2014at an extreme\u2014her desire to live.\nHowever, such fighting, expressive of autonomy, must lead to an impasse\nas it cannot achieve mutual recognition: either one of the subjects\ndies or subjects herself as a slave to the other, the superior master,\nand thus fails to express her autonomy. Furthermore, in this case the\nmaster does not receive adequate recognition either, because the\nrecognizer has proven to be a \u201cmere\u201d slave who does not\ncount as an autonomous and competent judge. Thus, adequate recognition\ncan only be achieved within an institutionalized order of\nrights that secures genuinely mutual recognition (Williams 1997,\n59\u201368). Hegel develops this latter thought most systematically in his\nmature Philosophy of Right. Here, the relationships and\nimplicit norms of the three spheres of, first, love within the family,\nsecond, contractual respect within civil society and, third, solidarity\nwithin the state are supposed to be necessary in order to actualize\nindividual autonomy, but not in the sense of mere\n\u201cnegative\u201d but of \u201csocial\u201d freedom. These\nspheres allow the subjects to feel at home within (or\n\u201creconciled\u201d with) the ethical life of their community\n(which is organized as a state) because it provides the subjects with\nthe meanings necessary for a fulfilling individual life that they can\nembrace (see also 2.3 below).\n",
