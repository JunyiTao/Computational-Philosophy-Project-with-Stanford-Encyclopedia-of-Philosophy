    "main_text": "\n\nMoral arguments for God\u2019s existence form a diverse family of\narguments that reason from some feature of morality or the moral life\nto the existence of God, usually understood as a morally good creator\nof the universe. Moral arguments are both important and interesting.\nThey are interesting because evaluating their soundness requires\nattention to practically every important philosophical issue dealt\nwith in metaethics. They are important because of their prominence in\npopular apologetic arguments for religious belief. Evidence for this\ncan be found in the amazing popularity of C. S. Lewis\u2019s Mere\nChristianity (1952), which is almost certainly the best-selling\nbook of apologetics in the twentieth century, and which begins with a\nmoral argument for God\u2019s existence. Many ordinary people regard\nreligion as in some way providing a basis or foundation for morality.\nThis fact might seem to favor religious arguments for morality rather\nthan moral arguments for religious belief, but if someone believes\nthat morality is in some way \u201cobjective\u201d or\n\u201creal,\u201d and that this moral reality requires explanation,\nmoral arguments for God\u2019s reality naturally suggest themselves.\nThe apparent connection between morality and religion appears to many\npeople to support the claim that moral truths require a religious\nfoundation, or can best be explained by God\u2019s existence, or some\nqualities or actions of God.\n\nAfter some general comments about theistic arguments and a brief\nhistory of moral arguments, this essay will discuss several different\nforms of the moral argument. A major distinction is that between moral\narguments that are theoretical in nature and practical or pragmatic\narguments. The former are best thought of as arguments that begin with\nalleged moral facts and argue that God is necessary to explain those\nfacts, or at least that God provides a better explanation of them than\nsecular accounts can offer. The latter typically begin with claims\nabout some good or end that morality requires and argue that this end\nis not attainable unless God exists. Whether this distinction is hard\nand fast will be one of the questions to be discussed, as some argue\nthat practical arguments by themselves cannot be the basis of rational\nbelief. To meet such concerns practical arguments may have to include\na theoretical dimension as well.\n",
