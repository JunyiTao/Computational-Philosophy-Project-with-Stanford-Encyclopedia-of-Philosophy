Evidence as a Guide to Truth: Evidence as Sign, Symptom, or Mark\n\nThe situation in which I would properly be said to have\nevidence for the statement that some animal is a pig is that,\nfor example, in which the beast itself is not actually on view, but I\ncan see plenty of pig-like marks on the ground outside its retreat. If\nI find a few buckets of pig-food, that's a bit more evidence, and the\nnoises and the smell may provide better evidence still. But if the\nanimal then emerges and stands there plainly in view, there is no\nlonger any question of collecting evidence; its coming into view\ndoesn't provide me with more evidence that it's a pig, I can\nnow just see that it is.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014J.L. Austin, Sense and Sensibilia\n\n\n\u2018Not enough evidence God! Not enough evidence!\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Bertrand Russell, upon being asked what he\nwould reply if, after dying, he were brought into the presence of God\nand asked why he had not been a believer\n\n\n If E is evidence for some hypothesis H, then\nE makes it more likely that H is true: in such\ncircumstances, E confirms H. On the other\nhand, if E is evidence against H, then E\nmakes it less likely that H is true: E\ndisconfirms H. Verification is the limiting\ncase of confirmation: a piece of evidence verifies a hypothesis in\nthis sense just in case it conclusively establishes that hypothesis as\ntrue. At the other end of the spectrum, falsification is the\nlimiting case of disconfirmation: a piece of evidence falsifies a\nhypothesis just in case it conclusively establishes that the\nhypothesis is false. It is at least somewhat controversial whether\nfull-fledged verification or falsification in this sense ever\n occurs.[16]\n\n Plausibly, there are some propositions whose truth or falsity we\ngrasp in an utterly direct, unmediated way. Consider, for example,\nsimple arithmetical truths such as the proposition that\n2+2=4. Traditionally, such truths have been held to be\n\u2018self-evident\u2019; allegedly, they need only to be understood\nin order to be known. If the truth value of every proposition were\ntransparent in this way, perhaps we would have little or no need for\nevidence. In contrast, a central function of evidence is to make\nevident that which would not be so in its absence.\n\n In general, we rely on evidence in cases in which our access to truth\nwould otherwise be problematic. One's recognition that the earth\nis roughly spherical in shape seems to depend on one's evidence\nin a way that one's recognition that 2+2=4 does not. Of course, it can\nbe a contested matter whether one's access to truth in some domain is\nproblematic\u2014and thus, whether one is dependent upon evidence for\ngrasping truths about that domain. Common sense holds that we often\nhave unproblematic access to facts about our immediate physical\nenvironment via sense perception; perhaps in part for this\nreason, common sense regards it as at the very least odd, if not\nsimply wrong, to say that one who finds himself face-to-face with what\nis clearly a pig thereby has strong evidence that the animal\nis a pig. (Although it would no doubt also be odd to assert that one\nlacks evidence that the animal is a pig in such\ncircumstances.) In contrast, much traditional epistemology holds that\none's access to such truths is always deeply problematic; what is\nunproblematic, rather, is one's recognition that one's experiences\nrepresent the world as being a certain way. Hence, much traditional\nepistemology construes the relationship between one's experiences and\none's beliefs about the physical world on the model of the\nrelationship between evidence and hypothesis. On this model, the\nfallibility of sense perception is assimilated to the fallibility of\nnon-deductive inference. (The above quotation from Austin is, of\ncourse, a protest against the model in question.)\n\n As a general matter, evidence seems to play a mediating\nrole vis-a-vis our efforts to arrive at an accurate picture of the\nworld: we seek to believe what is true by means of holding beliefs that\nare well-supported by the evidence, and we seek to avoid believing what\nis false by means of not holding beliefs that are not well-supported by\nthe evidence. The picture is well summarized by Blanshard:\n\n \u2018Surely the only possible rule\u2019, one may say, \u2018is\nto believe what is true and disbelieve what is false.\u2019 And of\ncourse that would be the rule if we were in a position to know what\nwas true and what false. But the whole difficulty arises from the fact\nthat we do not and often cannot. What is to guide us then?\u2026 The\nideal is believe no more, but also no less, than what the evidence\nwarrants (1974: 410\u2013411).\n \n\n Indeed, it is plausible to suppose that both the capacity of evidence\nto justify belief (Section 1) and the fact that rational thinkers\nrespect their evidence (Section 2) depends upon the connection between\nevidence and truth.\n\n Why should attending to evidence constitute a\npromising way of pursuing an accurate view of the world? This question\nis more readily answered on some conceptions of evidence than on\nothers. Thus, consider a theory according to which evidence consists of\nfacts. Given that no true proposition is inconsistent with any\nfact, one has an immediate rationale for not believing any proposition\nthat is inconsistent with one's evidence, for only propositions that\nare consistent with one's evidence are even candidates for being true.\nThe same holds for Williamson's conception of evidence as knowledge:\ninasmuch as any known proposition is true, inconsistency with one's\nevidence entails inconsistency with some truth. Put the other way\naround: if evidence consists of facts or known propositions, then no\nbody of evidence rules out any truth. Notice that the same is not true\nfor conceptions of evidence according to which one's evidence consists\nof one's beliefs, or one's experiences, or propositions of which one is\npsychologically certain: that a proposition is inconsistent with one of\nmy beliefs, or with the content of one of my experiences, or with a\nproposition of which I am psychologically certain, does not guarantee\nthat it is false.\n\n Perhaps the root notion of evidence is that of something which serves\nas a reliable sign, symptom, or mark of that which it is evidence\nof. In Ian Hacking's phrase, this is \u2018the evidence of\none thing that points beyond itself\u2019 (1975: 37). Thus, smoke is\nevidence of fire, Koplik spots evidence of measles, a certain\ndistinctive and off-putting smell evidence of rotten egg. Here, the\nparadigm would seem to be that of straightforward correlation: the\nreason why smoke counts as evidence of fire, but not of impending\nrain, is that smoke is a reliable indicator or symptom of the former\nbut not of the latter. Taken at face value, the idea of evidence as\nreliable indicator tends to encourage an inclusive picture of what\nsorts of things are eligible to count as evidence, according to which\neither mental or non-mental objects, events and states of affairs can\nqualify as such. For such entities would seem to be perfectly capable\nof standing in the relevant relation to other objects, events and\nstates of affairs.\n\n Consider the claim that\n\n (1) Koplik spots are evidence of measles.\n\n\n On what is perhaps its most natural reading, the truth of this claim\nwas an empirical discovery of medical science. At a certain point in\ntime, it was discovered that Koplik spots are a reliable indication of\nmeasles\u2014something which was true, presumably, long before\nthe discovery in question. Here, the evidence relation is understood\nas a relation that either obtains or fails to obtain independently of\nwhat anyone knows or believes about its\n obtaining.[17]\n To the extent that one is concerned to arrive at an accurate picture\nof the world, knowledge of instances of this relation\u2014roughly,\nknowledge of what bits of the world tend to accompany what other bits\nof the world\u2014would seem to be exactly the sort of thing which\none is seeking.  When the evidence relation is construed in this way,\ninvestigating it is of a piece with investigating the world\nitself.\n\n Similarly \n\n (2) Smoke is evidence of fire\n\n \n would seem to have the same empirical status as (1), differing\nchiefly in that it is much more widely known. \n\n When evidence is understood in this way, it is no mystery why\nattending to evidence is a good strategy for one who is concerned to\narrive at an accurate picture of the world: given that Koplik spots\nare in fact a reliable indicator of measles, it obviously behooves\nthose who are concerned to have true beliefs about which individuals\nare suffering from measles to pay attention to facts about which\nindividuals have Koplik spots. Similarly, given that smoke is in fact\na reliable indicator of fire, those who are concerned to have true\nbeliefs about the presence or absence of fire do well to pay attention\nto the presence or absence of smoke. Thus, when we understand\n\u2018E is evidence for H\u2019 as more or less\nsynonymous with \u2018E is a reliable indicator of\nH\u2019, the connection between evidence and truth seems\neasily secured and relatively straightforward. \n\n Of course, although the presence of Koplik spots is in fact a\nreliable guide to the presence of measles, one who is ignorant of this\nfact is not in a position to conclude that a given patient has\nmeasles, even if he or she is aware that the patient has Koplik\nspots. Someone who knows that Koplik spots are evidence of measles is\nin a position to diagnose patients in a way that someone who is\nignorant of that fact is not. In general, the extent to which one is\nin a position to gain new information on the basis of particular\npieces of evidence typically depends upon one's background\nknowledge. This fact is a commonplace among philosophers of science\nand has also been emphasized by philosophically-sophisticated\n historians.[18]\n\n Suppose that one knows that a particular patient has Koplik spots but\nis ignorant of the connection between Koplik spots and\nmeasles. Moreover, suppose that one's ignorance is not itself the\nresult of any prior irrationality or unreasonableness on one's part:\nrather, one has simply never had the opportunity to learn about the\nconnection between Koplik spots and measles. In these circumstances,\ndoes one have evidence that the patient has measles? Taken in one\nsense, this question should be answered affirmatively: one does have\nevidence that the patient has measles, although one is not in a\nposition to recognize that one does.  However, the idea that one has\nevidence in such circumstances seems to sit somewhat awkwardly with\nthe themes that evidence tends to justify belief, and that rational\nthinkers are sensitive to their evidence. For consider the moment when\none first learns that the patient has Koplik spots. Given one's\nignorance of the connection between Koplik spots and measles, one is\nnot in any way unreasonable if one fails to become more confident that\nthe patient has measles. Indeed, given one's ignorance, it seems that\none would be unreasonable if one did become more confident\nthat the patient has measles upon learning that she has Koplik spots,\nand that a belief that the patient has measles held on this basis\nwould be unjustified.\n\n This suggests that the notion of evidence in play in statements such\nas \u2018evidence tends to justify belief\u2019 and \u2018rational\nthinkers respect their evidence\u2019 cannot simply be identified\nwith evidence in the sense of reliable indicator.  Let's call evidence\nin the former sense normative evidence, and evidence in the\nlatter sense indicator evidence.  Although the normative\nnotion of evidence cannot simply be identified with the indicator\nnotion, we would expect the two to be closely linked, inasmuch as\none's possession of normative evidence frequently depends upon one's\nawareness that one thing is indicator evidence of something else.\n\n Reflection on the role that considerations of background theory play\nin determining how it is reasonable for one to respond to new\ninformation have convinced some that the normative notion of evidence\nis better understood in terms of a three place-relation rather than a\ntwo-place relation. According to this view, judgements of the form\n\u2018E is evidence for H\u2019\u2014when this is\nunderstood as more or less synonymous with \u2018E tends to\nmake it more reasonable to believe H\u2019\u2014 are\ntypically elliptical for judgements of the form \u2018E is\nevidence for H relative to background theory\nT\u2019. Thus, given that your background theory includes\nthe claim that Koplik spots are a reliable indication of measles, the\nfact that a particular patient has Koplik spots constitutes normative\nevidence for you (gives you a reason to believe that) the patient has\nmeasles. On the other hand, given that my background theory does\nnot include the claim that Koplik spots are a reliable\nindication of measles, the fact that the same patient has Koplik spots\ndoes not constitute normative evidence for me (give me a\nreason to believe that) the patient has measles.\n\n The view that the status of E as normative evidence for\nH can depend upon considerations of background theory\nimmediately raises questions about the status of the background theory\nitself. Given that one's background theory consists of some set of\npropositions, which set is it? Is it the set of propositions that one\nknows? Or rather, the set of propositions that one believes? Or\nperhaps, the set of propositions that one justifiably\nbelieves? It seems that E might count as evidence for\nH relative to the set of propositions that one believes but\nnot relative to the set of propositions that one knows (or vice\nversa)\u2014which of these, if either, determines whether E\nis evidence for H, in the sense that one's possession of\nE tends to justify one in believing that H is true?\nThe issues that arise here are subtle and delicate; Christensen (1997)\nis a careful and illuminating discussion.\n\nA note about confirmation theory.  Although philosophy had\nin some sense long been concerned with questions about when evidence\nmakes a theory more likely to be true, the investigation of this\nrelationship reached new levels of systematicity and rigor during the\npositivist era. The positivists thought of philosophy as \u2018the\nlogic of science\u2019; they thus took it to be a central task of\nphilosophy to furnish detailed analyses and explications of\nfundamental scientific concepts such as explanation and\nconfirmation.\n\n Hempel (1945) and Carnap (1950) each distinguished two different\n\u2018concepts\u2019 of confirmation: the\n\u2018classificatory\u2019 or \u2018qualitative\u2019 concept on\nthe one hand and the \u2018quantitative\u2019 concept on the\nother. Roughly, the classificatory concept is employed in the making\nof yes-or-no judgements about whether a given piece of evidence does\nor does not support a given hypothesis.  Thus, it is the\nclassificatory concept which is in play when one is concerned with\njudgements of the following form: \u2018Hypothesis H is\nconfirmed by evidence E\u2019. On the other hand, the\nquantitative concept is employed in making numerical judgements about\nhow much support a hypothesis derives from a given piece of\nevidence (e.g,. \u2018Hypothesis H is confirmed by evidence\nE to degree\n R\u2019).[19]\n Formal theories attempting to explicate each of these notions were\ndeveloped. Hempel (1945) took the lead in attempting to explicate the\nqualitative concept while Carnap (1950, 1952) concentrated on the\nquantitative concept. During this period, the philosophical study of\nthe relationship between evidence and theory took on, perhaps for the\nfirst time, the characteristics of something like normal science, and\nbecame a discipline replete with technical problems, puzzles, and\nparadoxes, the anticipated solutions to which were viewed as items on\nthe agenda for future\n research.[20]\n Here lie the origins of present-day confirmation theory, as\nrepresented by Bayesianism in its protean forms (See, e.g., Jeffrey\n1965, 1992, 2004, Horwich 1983, Howson and Urbach 1993) and its rivals\n(e.g., Glymour's (1980) \u2018bootstrapping\u2019 model of\nconfirmation).\n\n Although Carnap's own vision for confirmation theory was ultimately\n abandoned,[21]\n the quantitative approach that he championed proved influential to\nthe subsequent development of the subject. In particular, the emphasis\non attempting to understand confirmation in quantitative terms paved\nthe way for the increased use of mathematics\u2014and\nspecifically, the probability calculus\u2014in the philosophical\nstudy of evidence. The idea that the probability calculus provides the\nkey to understanding the relation of confirmation is central to\nBayesianism, the dominant view within contemporary confirmation\ntheory. An examination of Bayesianism will not be undertaken\n here.[22]\n Instead, we will simply take note of the explication of the concept\nof evidence which the Bayesian offers. At the outset of the present\nsection, we noted that evidence confirms a theory just in case that\nevidence makes the theory more likely to be true; evidence disconfirms\na theory just in case the evidence renders the theory less likely to\nbe true. The Bayesian takes these platitudes at face value and offers\nthe following probabilistic explication of what it is for E\nto be evidence for H: \n\nE is evidence for H if and only if\nProb(H/E) > \n Prob(H).[23 ]\n\n\n That is, E is evidence for H just in case the\nconditional probability of H on E is greater than\nthe unconditional probability of H. Thus, the fact that\nthe suspect's blood is on the knife is evidence for the\nhypothesis that the suspect committed the murder if and only\nif the probability that the suspect committed the murder is greater\ngiven that his blood is on the knife than it would be otherwise.\n\n Similarly \n\nE is evidence against H if and only if\nProb(H/E) < Prob(H).\n \n\n That is, E is evidence against H just in case the\nconditional probability of H on E is less than the\nunconditional probability of H. Thus, the fact that the\nsuspect's fingerprints are not on the knife is evidence against\nthe hypothesis that the suspect committed the murder if and\nonly if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is lower\ngiven the absence of his fingerprints on the knife than it would be\notherwise. Within this probabilistic model, verification (in the sense\nof conclusive confirmation) would involve bestowing probability 1 on\nan hypothesis while falsification would involve bestowing probability\n0 on it.\n\n This straightforward probabilistic model of evidence and confirmation\nis an attractive and natural one. Indeed, hints of it are found in\nAnglo-American\n law.[24]\n The model is not without its critics, however. Achinstein (1983)\ncontends that something can increase the probability of a claim\nwithout providing evidence for that claim. For example, the\ninformation that seven-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz went\nswimming increases the probability that Mark Spitz has just drowned;\nnevertheless, according to Achinstein, the former hardly constitutes\nevidence that the latter is\n true.[25]\n According to a line of thought in Goodman (1955), the notion of\nconfirmation that is crucial for science is not to be understood in\nterms of straightforward increase-in-probability. Thus, consider the\ngeneralization that All of the change in my pocket consists of\nnickels.  Examining one of the coins in my pocket and finding\nthat it is a nickel undoubtedly increases the probability that the\ngeneralization is true, inasmuch as it now has one less potential\nfalsifier. But Goodman contends the relevant observation does not\nconfirm the generalization, inasmuch as the observation should not\nmake one more confident that any of the other, as-yet-unexamined coins\nin my pocket is itself a nickel.  (According to Goodman, although\n\u2018accidental generalizations\u2019 such as \u2018All the coins\nin my pockets are nickels\u2019 can have their probabilities raised\nby observations, they cannot be confirmed by them, in the way that\n\u2018law-like generalizations\u2019 can be.)\n\n In general, the idea\nthat the probability calculus provides the key to understanding the\nconcept of evidence has found greater favor among philosophers of\nscience than among traditional epistemologists. In the next and final\nsection, we turn to a cluster of themes that have also been much\nemphasized by philosophers of science, themes which came to the fore as\na result of philosophical reflection upon the role that evidence plays\nwithin scientific practice itself.\n",
