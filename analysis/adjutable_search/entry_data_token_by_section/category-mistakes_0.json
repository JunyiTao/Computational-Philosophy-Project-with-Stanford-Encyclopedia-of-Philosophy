    "main_text": "Characterizing Category Mistakes\n1. Characterizing Category Mistakes\n\n\nOne might have expected this entry to start with a definition of\n\u2018category mistake\u2019. However, giving an explicit\ninformative definition of category mistakes is no easy task. A typical\ndictionary definition looks like this: \u201cThe error of assigning\nto something a quality or action which can only properly be assigned\nto things of another category, for example treating abstract concepts\nas though they had a physical location\u201d (Stevenson 2010). But\nsuch definitions are at best too vague to be useful, and at worst\nsimply incorrect. For example, if \u2018properly assigned\u2019 is\ninterpreted as meaning\ntruly assigned, then the definition massively over-generates:\nthe sentence \u2018Two is odd\u2019 assigns to something (the number\ntwo) a quality (being odd) that can only be truly assigned to things of\nanother category (odd numbers), but the sentence clearly isn\u2019t a\ncategory mistake. Alternatively, if \u2018properly assigned\u2019 is\nunderstood as \u2018grammatically assigned\u2019, then we risk\nclassifying obviously ungrammatical strings such as \u2018the boys\neats\u2019 as category mistakes.\n\n\nOther definitions suffer from not being sufficiently theoretically\nneutral, relying on specific controversial accounts of category\nmistakes. For example, one might try to define category mistakes as\nsentences that are syntactically well-formed but meaningless. But as\nwe shall see both parts of this proposed definition depend on\ncontroversial assumptions about the nature of category mistakes: that\nthey are syntactically well-formed (cf. \u00a73.1) and that they are\nmeaningless (cf. \u00a73.2.1). Moreover, even if we are willing to\neschew theoretical neutrality, note that most of the accounts\ndiscussed do not offer an obvious way to distinguish category mistakes\nfrom other linguistic phenomena. For example, according to the\ntruthvaluelessness view (\u00a73.2.3) category mistakes are contentful\nbut truth-valueless but, at least according to many philosophers, so\nare some instances of vague sentences such as \u2018John is\ntall\u2019. And according to the presuppositional approach\n(\u00a73.4), category mistakes suffer from a presupposition failure,\nbut then so do sentences that are not category mistakes such as\n\u2018The king of France is bald\u2019.\n\n\nPerhaps the question of how to define category mistakes will receive a\nmore satisfactory answer in the future or perhaps (following a general\ntrend in analytic philosophy against conceptual analysis) we should\neschew the project of defining category mistakes altogether. At any\nrate, extant debates on the topic of category mistakes have focused\nlargely on the question of how to account for their infelicity rather\nthan on the question of how to define the concept or distinguish\ncategory mistakes from other phenomena. The remainder of this entry\nwill follow suit.\n\n\nEven without offering an explicit definition, there is a\nphenomenological way of characterizing category mistakes. As noted at\nthe outset, there seems to be a distinctive kind of infelicity which\nwe can recognize by example: the sort of infelicity present in\nparadigmatic category mistakes such as \u2018The number two is\nblue\u2019. We can thus characterize category mistakes as sentences\nthat are infelicitous in a similar manner to these paradigmatic\nexamples. While this kind of phenomenological characterization may not\nseem theoretically informative, on reflection it reveals several\ninteresting features of category mistakes. First, category mistakes\ncan be created using a wide range of syntactic types: for example,\nadjectives (\u2018Two is green\u2019); adverbs (\u2018John sleeps\nfuriously\u2019); or prepositional phrases (\u2018The theory of\nrelativity is under the table\u2019). Second, the infelicity\ncharacteristic of category mistakes seems to occur in a range of\ncomplex constructions (for example, \u2018The number two isn\u2019t\nblue\u2019 or \u2018Either the number two is blue or it is\nprime\u2019). Third, whether the sort of infelicity in question is\npresent can depend on context, in various different ways. For example,\nan utterance of \u2018That is green\u2019 seems infelicitous in a\ncontext where the demonstrative refers (or appears to refer) to the\nnumber two, but entirely innocuous in a context in which it refers to\na pen. And an utterance of \u2018The priest is pregnant\u2019 can be\ninfelicitous in a context where speakers assume that all priests are\nmale, but entirely innocuous in a context where it is assumed that\nthere are female priests. As we shall see, these features play a role\nin the ensuing debate.\n",
