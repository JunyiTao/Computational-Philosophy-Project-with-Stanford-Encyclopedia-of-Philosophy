    "main_text": "Categories and Lists of Emotions in Early Chinese Texts || Unusual Categories of Qing\n4.2 Unusual Categories of Qing\n\nIn the Chinese lists of emotions, however, one can see some unusual\ncategories: \u201cpersuasion and reason\u201d (\u8aaa\u6545) in the\nXunzi (22.5) and profit (material interest) (\u5229) in the\nNei yei. They do not look like categories of emotions. In\naddition, it is unclear whether these lists of emotions refer to the\ndesignated emotions or the whole spectrum of emotions. For example,\nEifring (2019: 190) suggests that xi nu (\u559c\u6012 joy and\nanger), a pair of antonyms, should be understood broadly as the whole\nspectrum emotions, not simply as the two specific emotions (joy and\nanger). He states that xi nu \n\n\nis used as a simple two-character phrase\u2026usually referring to\nemotions in general rather than to these two specific emotions. \n\n\nIt is also unclear whether these lists provide a set of mutually\nexclusive or jointly exhaustive emotions. Since some of the lists\ninclude overlapping categories of emotions. For example, love\n(ai \u611b) and liking (hao \u597d) seem very similar to\neach other so that they have the same antonym, i.e., disliking\n(e \u60e1) in their contrastive pairs. In the Liji,\nai (love) is paired with e (disliking) but in the\nXunzi, hao (liking) is paired with e\n(disliking). In addition, motivational states such as desire\n(yu \u6b32) and liking (hao \u597d) seem to share some\ncommon psychological elements. Therefore, the lists and categories of\nemotions in early Chinese texts should not be understood as complete\nand exhaustive lists of emotions because they are composed of\noverlapping categories that are not mutually exclusive and jointly\nexhaustive. It make little sense to compare them directly against\nDescartes\u2019 primitive passions or Ekman\u2019s basic emotions\nalthough they have some similarities with the Western\ncounterparts.\n",
