    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Rule-following and Private Language\n3.5 Rule-following and Private Language\n\nOne of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that\nof rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes\nanother central point of discussion in the question of what it is that\ncan apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as\nbefore has it that a rule is an abstract entity\u2014transcending all\nof its particular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping\nthat abstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it.\n\nWittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:\n\u201c\u2026 we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say \u2018+\n2\u2019) beyond 1000\u2014and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008,\n1012\u201d (PI 185). What do we do, and what does it mean,\nwhen the student, upon being corrected, answers \u201cBut I did go on\nin the same way\u201d? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in PI\n185\u2013243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of\nattendant questions: How do we learn rules? How do we follow them?\nWherefrom the standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?\nAre they in the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?\nDo we appeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and\npublicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the\nanswers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of\nthe questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to\nthe test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic\npictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and\nWittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such\nliberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of\nexternal or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the\nrule.\n\nThese considerations lead to PI 201, often considered the\nclimax of the issue: \u201cThis was our paradox: no course of action\ncould be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be\nmade out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to\nconflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict\nhere.\u201d Wittgenstein\u2019s formulation of the problem, now at\nthe point of being a \u201cparadox,\u201d has given rise to a wealth\nof interpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the\ncrux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a\nlanguage. One of the influential readings of the problem of following\na rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the\ninterpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a\nskeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,\nthere are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no\nreal grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and\nWittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other\nconditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following\na rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several\ninterpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell\n1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives\n(e.g., Diamond, \u201cRules: Looking in the Right Place\u201d in\nPhillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002).\n\nDirectly following the rule-following sections in PI, and\ntherefore easily thought to be the upshot of the discussion, are those\nsections called by interpreters \u201cthe private-language\nargument.\u201d Whether it be a veritable argument or not (and\nWittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections point out that\nfor an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible in principle to\nsubject it to public standards and criteria of correctness. For this\nreason, a private-language, in which \u201cwords \u2026 are to\nrefer to what only the speaker can know\u2014to his immediate private\nsensations \u2026\u201d (PI 243), is not a genuine,\nmeaningful, rule-governed language. The signs in language can only\nfunction when there is a possibility of judging the correctness of\ntheir use, \u201cso the use of [a] word stands in need of a\njustification which everybody understands\u201d (PI\n261).\n",
