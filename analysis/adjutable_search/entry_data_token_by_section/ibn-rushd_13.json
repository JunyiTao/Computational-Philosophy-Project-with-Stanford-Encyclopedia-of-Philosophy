    "main_text": "Reception || Hebrew\n9.3 Latin\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s influence on Christian Europe, from the early\nthirteenth-century through the Renaissance, was massive, and has been\nextensively studied. Translations from Arabic into Latin began with\nMichael Scott, around 1220, and by the middle of the century most of\nthe Aristotelian commentaries had been translated (Burnett 2010,\n820\u201321; Hasse 2016, 341\u201357). Almost immediately after the\nwork of translation began his ideas grew in influence (Gauthier 1982),\nand already by the 1230s he is known as \u201cthe Commentator.\u201d\nConcerns quickly arose, however, over certain contentious claims, and\nby the 1260s the term \u2018Averroist\u2019 was used in a pejorative\nsense, particularly with regard to the unicity of the intellect\n(Kuksewicz 1968; see \u00a75 above), the eternity of the world (Dales\n1990; see \u00a74), and the threat of determinism (Martin 2015, see\n\u00a76.1). Even usually temperate authors such as Thomas Aquinas\nroused themselves to heated invective in considering these doctrines,\nand in 1270, and again in\n 1277,\n lists of condemned propositions were directed at the arts faculty at\nthe University of Paris, many concerning views associated with Ibn\nRushd (Brenet 2015; Wippel 1995).\n\nThe situation was, however, more complex than a simple opposition\nbetween the \u201cAverroists\u201d and their opponents. At a\nminimum, the field divides into three groups. First are those whose\nenthusiasm for a Rushdian reading of Aristotle leads them take boldly\nheterodox views in tension with Christianity. Leading figures here are\nSiger of Brabant,\n Boethius of Dacia,\n and John of Jandun (Brenet 2003). Even in this case there are doubts,\nhowever, regarding whether Ibn Rushd is the prime impetus behind their\nviews; Van Steenberghen (1980) prefers the label \u201cradical\nAristotelianism.\u201d Second are those at the opposite extreme,\nopposing not only Ibn Rushd\u2019s most radical ideas but even\nAristotelianism itself, as when Peter John Olivi complains of\nAristotle that \u201cwithout reason he is believed, as the god of\nthis age\u201d\n (Peter John Olivi \u00a73).\n Bonaventure becomes a leading figure in this movement (Mahoney 1988).\nThird are the great majority of philosophers in between, including\nThomas Aquinas and other leading figures of the age, who reject Ibn\nRushd\u2019s readings of Aristotle when they conflict with Church\nauthority, even while in most matters they continue to rely on\n\u201cthe Commentator.\u201d Thus a papal decree from 1341 calls on\nthe arts faculty at Paris to follow \u201cthe science of Aristotle\nand his commentator Averroes, and other ancient commentators and\ninterpreters of Aristotle, except in cases that run counter to the\nfaith\u201d (in Putallaz 2010, 111).\n\nWhere that third group agrees most fundamentally with Ibn Rushd is in\nthe conviction that the way forward in philosophy, at least in\ngeneral, is to adhere faithfully to the mind of Aristotle (\u00a71.2\nabove). Here Ibn Rushd looms particularly large over the history of\nEuropean philosophy, all the way through the Renaissance (Akasoy and\nGiglioni 2010, Hasse 2016). During these later years his name\ncontinues to be divisive: large numbers of theologians make common\ncause with the new breed of humanists against a persistent line of\n\u201cAverroists\u201d who continue to defend even Ibn Rushd\u2019s\nmost notorious doctrines. The most controversial figures are now\nItalian, and often associated with the University of Padua, such as\n Paul of Venice,\n Pietro Pomponazzi, Agostino Nifo, and\n Giacomo Zabarella.\n Yet even while fierce debate endures over the unity of the intellect\nand other such causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, the general run\nof scholars and students continues, page by page, to rely on Ibn Rushd\nas the paramount guide to Aristotle. New editions, new\nsupercommentaries, and even whole new translations appear until nearly\nthe end of the sixteenth century, most famously the Junta editions of\nAristotle with Ibn Rushd\u2019s commentaries, from 1552 and again\n1562, which remain in use to this day.\n\nWhere Ibn Rushd\u2019s influence is perhaps even more important, but\nless easy to pin down, concerns the relationship between philosophy\nand religion (Klima 1998, Marenbon 2007, Normore 1995). The most\ndistinctive feature of the \u201cAverroists\u201d is their\ninclination to pursue philosophical arguments to their logical\nconclusion, regardless of Church doctrine. To be sure, this has close\naffinities with Ibn Rushd\u2019s insistence that philosophy should\ninform religious study (see \u00a76.2), but in the censorious context\nof premodern Christianity such an approach was especially perilous.\nFigures like Siger of Brabant would stake out boldly heterodox-looking\nclaims, only to backtrack and insist that they were merely describing\nwhat pure philosophical reason would show, not defending these views\nas true. Often they would later disavow even their earlier strictly\nphilosophical claims. The autonomy of reason, against the claims of\nreligion, was not a principle that could be easily defended at this\ntime.\n\nFor further information see the entry on the\n influence of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on the Latin West.\n A particularly valuable collection of papers is found in\nNiew\u00f6hner and Sturlese (1994).\n",
