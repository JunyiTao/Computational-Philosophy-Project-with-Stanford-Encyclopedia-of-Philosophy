    "main_text": "Correctness and Imitation (421c\u2013427d) || An Ideal Language?\n7.2 An Ideal Language?\n\nHaving formulated\n (NAT**),\n Socrates seems to take up his original task of accounting for the\ncorrectness of concrete etymologically simple names like ion,\nrhe\u00f4n, and doun (424a\u2013b). But very soon,\nhe digresses: Instead of examining existing names, he expands on how a\nlawgiver should ideally go about creating names that imitate the being\nof their intended referents (424b\u2013425a). His explanation is\ndense and difficult, and a crucial\nsentence\u2014424d1\u20135\u2014is fraught with philological\nproblems. The basic idea seems to be that an ideal lawgiver would have\nto do four things:\n\nHe would have to provide a taxonomy of all the letters;\nhe would have to identify and distinguish those basic kinds of\nbeings to which all things can be traced back;\nhe would have to determine which letters or syllables resemble\nwhich basic kinds; and\nhe would have to form concatenations of letters and syllables that\nimitate the being of the nominanda.\n\n\nWhat Socrates sketches here is clearly a very ambitious research\nproject. Some parts of this research project\u2014the taxonomy of\nletters and, especially, the taxonomy of beings\u2014are certainly\nclose to Plato\u2019s heart; they are, after all, strongly\nreminiscent of the dialectical investigations that are conducted (or\nat least envisaged) in dialogues such as the Sophist, the\nStatesman, and the Philebus. It is less clear,\nhowever, whether Plato really believes that a linguistic lawgiver\nshould detect correlations between the two taxonomies and introduce\nnames that imitate the being of their referents on the basis of these\ncorrelations. Some commentators do indeed contend that the passage at\nhand contains Plato\u2019s recipe for the creation of an ideal\nlanguage. Most of these commentators\nare\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014adherents of\n Reading B\n (see, e.g., Anagnostopoulos 1973: 331f.; Baxter 1992: 80\u201385;\nand Barney 2011: 97). Other commentators\u2014usually proponents of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C\u2014object\n that the language Socrates describes here would have no real\nadvantage over other possible languages, since its users would not be\nable to access and appropriate the system of knowledge it encodes\nunless they embark on their own philosophical investigation (see,\ne.g., Williams 1982: 92). These commentators conclude that the passage\n424b\u2013425a is meant to show that even a mimetically perfect\nlanguage would not be particularly useful\u2014and thus to discredit\n (NAT**).\n",
