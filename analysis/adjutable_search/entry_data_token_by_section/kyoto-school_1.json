    "main_text": "Identity and Membership: Who Belongs to What? || A History of External Naming\n2.1 A History of External Naming\n\nThere has been considerable discussion surrounding the question of how\nto define the Kyoto School, and who to include as its members. By all\naccounts Nishida Kitar\u014d is the School\u2019s originator. (See\nthe entry on\n Nishida Kitar\u014d.)\n Yet it was never his intention to institute a \u201cschool\u201d\nbased on his own thought; in fact he is reported to have always\nencouraged independent thinking in his students. Moreover, unlike\nPlato\u2019s Academy or the Frankfurt School\u2019s Institute for\nSocial Research, the Kyoto School thinkers never founded an academic\ninstitution or formed an official organization (at least until The\nNishida Philosophy Association was founded in 2003; see the website\nlisted below). Their association was initially based merely on the\nfact that they studied and taught at Kyoto University and developed\ntheir thinking under the influence of Nishida as well as in dialogue\nand debate with him and with one another. Indeed the name \u201cKyoto\nSchool\u201d only came into use by the \u201cmembers\u201d\nthemselves much later, when at all.\n\nNames do not only tell us who or what something is; they also tell us\nwho or what something is not. Definitions not only seek to reveal an\ninternal essence; they also draw a line of demarcation between inside\nand outside. It is thus not surprising that names and definitions\noften have their origin in labels appended from without. These labels\nmay subsequently degenerate into stereotypes; or, conversely, they may\nbe positively appropriated and redefined by the group itself. Both of\nthese processes can be seen in the history of the \u201cKyoto\nSchool.\u201d\n\nThe name \u201cKyoto School,\u201d in fact, originated from without;\nor, more precisely speaking, it originated from the fringes of the\nSchool itself. Tosaka Jun (1900\u20131945), a student of Nishida and\nTanabe, coined the expression in 1932 in reference to Nishida, Tanabe\nand Miki Kiyoshi (1897\u20131945) as purportedly representative of\nthe epitome of \u201cbourgeois philosophy in Japan\u201d (see Heisig\n2001, 4). Tosaka\u2019s own developing thought had an explicitly\nmaterialist and Marxist orientation (see Tosaka 2014), and in his\narticle he criticized the School as promulgating a bourgeois idealism\nthat ignores material historical conditions and issues of social\npraxis. Tosaka\u2019s critique had an impact on the subsequent\ndevelopment of the Kyoto School\u2019s philosophies, and ironically\nTosaka himself is today considered by some to belong, together with\nMiki, to the \u201cleft wing\u201d of the Kyoto School (see Hattori\n2004).\n\nThe second significant moment in the naming (or\n\u201clabeling\u201d) of the Kyoto School came more clearly from\nwithout, and in an even more politically charged context. As Nishitani\nwas to recollect years later: \u201cThe name \u2018Kyoto\nSchool\u2019 is a name journalists used in connection with\ndiscussions that friends of mine and I held immediately before and\nduring the war\u201d (NKC XI, 207; see Heisig 2001, 277). Nishitani\nis referring here to a series of symposia that addressed the question\nof the meaning and direction of the Pacific War and another symposium\non the question of \u201covercoming modernity.\u201d These\ncontroversial symposia will be discussed in subsection 4.3 of this\narticle. In his retrospective comments, penned in 1977, Nishitani goes\non to say that by that time the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d had\ncome to be used by Americans and others to \u201cindicate purely a\nschool of thought.\u201d\n\nSince the 1970s the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d has gradually\nrecovered its underlying philosophical ring, which for several decades\nin Japan (especially outside of Kyoto) had been drowned out by its\npolitical overtones. This recovery happened first of all in the West,\nwhere scholars neglected the political controversies in their\nenthusiastic reception of the School\u2019s philosophies of religion.\nWhile the political controversies returned with a vengeance to Western\nacademia a couple of decades later, in a kind of pendulum swing to the\nhypercritical, the initial positive attention from the West had by\nthen helped to rehabilitate the image of the Kyoto School back home in\nJapan.\n\nFujita Masakatsu suggests that the question of defining the identity\nof the Kyoto School has often been a more pressing issue for Western\nscholars than for the Japanese themselves. He speculates that there\nare two reasons for this. One is that the Kyoto School never really\nhad any noteworthy competing schools of original thought within Japan\nwith which to contrast itself, and over against which to explicitly\ndefine its own identity. The second reason is that, while Westerners\ntend to draw out and focus on the shared general characteristics of\nthe School\u2019s thinkers, usually in contrast with the general\ncharacteristics of Western thought, for Japanese scholars of the Kyoto\nSchool the differences between the various thinkers often appear in\nsharper relief than do their shared commonalities (Fujita 2001,\nii).\n\nIn any case, just as the formation of the Kyoto School\u2019s ideas\ntook place between Western and East Asian horizons of thought, so has\nthe scholarly study and, to some extent, even the defining of the\nKyoto School taken place between scholars in Japan on the one hand and\nthose in Europe and North America on the other. Since one of the\ncommon characteristics of the Kyoto School philosophers is their\nattempt to set Japan and their own thought in the context of the wider\nworld, it is fitting that, with the increasingly international study\nof the Kyoto School, their thought is finally becoming what it always\nintended to be, namely, \u201cJapanese philosophy in the world\u201d\n(see Heisig 2004; Fujita & Davis 2005; Davis & Schroeder &\nWirth 2011).\n",
