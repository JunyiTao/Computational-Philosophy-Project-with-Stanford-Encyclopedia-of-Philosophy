    "main_text": "Explicature and Impliciture\n13. Explicature and Impliciture\n\nAs observed in\n \u00a71,\n Grice (1975: 24) introduced the technical term\n\u201cimplicature\u201d to denote either (i) the act of meaning or\nimplying one thing by saying something else, or (ii) what the speaker\nmeant or implied. Grice (1975: 87ff) used \u201csay\u201d quite\nstrictly, requiring what a speaker says to be closely related to what\nthe sentence uttered means on that occasion. Indexicals provide cases\nin which what a speaker says is not what the sentence used means. When\nBarb uttered \u201cI have to work\u201d in\n (1),\n she said that she, Barb, has to work; but the sentence she used does\nnot mean \u201cShe, Barb, has to work\u201d even on that occasion.\nEllipsis allows people to say things without even uttering sentences.\nIf John asks \u201cWhere did Mary go?\u201d and Sue answers\n\u201cTo the gym\u201d, then Sue said that Mary went to the gym. The\ninfinitive phrase she uttered was elliptical for a sentence meaning\n\u201cMary went to the gym\u201d but does not itself mean that.\n\nSperber and Wilson (1986a: 182\u20133) introduced the parallel term\nexplicature to mean what is \u201cexplicitly\ncommunicated\u201d. Carston (1988: 33) initially identified this with\n\u201cwhat is said, in Grice\u2019s\n terms\u201d.[71]\n On this definition, Barb\u2019s explicature in\n (1)\n was that she has to work, and her implicature was that she is not\ngoing to Paul\u2019s party. Carston\u2019s (1988: 40)\nparadigm case is less clear.\n\n(15) \nAlice ran to the edge of the cliff.\n\na. Alice jumped.\nb. Alice jumped off the cliff.\n\n\n\n\nAfter saying or observing that Alice ran to the edge of the cliff, a\nspeaker would typically use (15a) \u201cAlice jumped\u201d to mean\nthat Alice jumped off the cliff [15b]. Carston counts this an\nexplicature. It does resemble ellipsis, but a speaker who used (15a)\nto mean that Alice jumped up to the rescue helicopter said the\nsame thing while meaning something different. And if the speaker\nknew that Alice jumped up to safety, the speaker might be accused of\nmisleading the hearer but not of lying.\n\nCarston\u2019s (1988: 45; 2004a: 646\u20138) most influential\nargument is based on what are commonly called \u201cembedded\nimplicatures\u201d. She would claim that if \u201cAlice jumped off\nthe cliff\u201d were an implicature of \u201cAlice jumped\u201d,\nthen we should not understand (16a) and (16b) as having the same truth\nconditions. Yet we do, Carston believes. The alleged implicature seems\nto fall within the scope of the logical operator. Yet it cannot given\nthe definition of implicature\n (\u00a71).[72]\n\n(16) \n\n\n a. If Alice ran to the edge of the cliff and jumped, she is probably dead. \n b.   If Alice ran to the edge of the cliff and jumped off, she is probably dead.\n\n\n\n\nW. Davis (2016: \u00a75.3) replies as follows. A speaker who used\n (15a)\n to mean\n [15b]\n would just as naturally use (16a) to mean [16b], and hearers would\nunderstand the speaker accordingly. But what the speaker said\nis not entailed by [16b]. What the speaker of (16a) said would be\nfalse in circumstances in which Alice was unlikely to jump off the\ncliff if she jumped. Hearers would focus on what the speaker meant,\nthough, which would be true even in those circumstances. Since the\nspeaker meant one thing [16b] by saying something else [16a], the\nspeaker implicates [16b]. The speaker cannot implicate anything by\nuttering the antecedent of (16a) because the speaker does not say\nanything by uttering the antecedent, only by uttering the whole\nconditional. So there is really no embedding of implicatures when\n(16a) is uttered.\n\nThe relationship between\n (15)\n and (16) is special. In many other cases in which a sentence\n\u201cp\u201d conversationally implicates\n\u201cq\u201d, the conditional \u201cIf p then\nr\u201d does not implicate \u201cIf p and\nq then r\u201d. For example, If Bill got some\nproblems wrong, he might have gotten them all wrong does not\nimplicate \u201cIf Bill got some but not all problems wrong, he might\nhave gotten them all wrong\u201d.\n\nA lively debate between Relevance theorists and neo-Griceans concerns\nnumerical claims.\n\n(17) \nPeter has one child.\n\n a.Peter has at least one child. \n b.  Peter has exactly one child.\n\n\n\n\nAll parties agree that a speaker can use (17) to mean either [17a] or\n[17b]. Horn (1972) and Levinson (2000: 87\u201390) further agree with\nCarston that (17) itself is unambiguous. But whereas the neo-Griceans\nhold that (17) means [17a] rather than [17b], Carston (1988:\n46\u20137) maintains that (17) means neither but can be used to say\nboth. So the neo-Griceans hold that (17) always says [17a] while\nsometimes implicating [17b]. Carston holds that (17) is sometimes used\nto explicate [17a] and sometimes [17b]; neither is an implicature. The\nthesis that sentence meaning leaves open what is said to this extent\nis called semantic underdetermination.\n\nWhile still doubting that Carston\u2019s view can fully account for\ncardinals, Horn (1989: 250\u20131; 2010: 314\u20135) now concludes\nthat they do not behave like quantifiers. For example, if you know\nthat everyone passed, you must answer \u201cDid some students\npass?\u201d with \u201cYes\u201d. But if you know that Peter has\ntwo children, you cannot answer \u201cDoes Peter have one\nchild?\u201d without knowing whether the speaker meant \u201cat\nleast\u201d or \u201cexactly\u201d. Indeed, a case can be made that\n(17) is ambiguous, so that Neo-Gricean and Relevance accounts are both\nwrong (W. Davis 2016: \u00a77.3).\n\nFollowing Sperber & Wilson (1986a: 182), Carston (2004b: 635)\nlater defines an explicature as a development of a logical form\nencoded by the sentence uttered, and an implicature as any proposition\ncommunicated by an utterance that is not an\n explicature.[73]\n The technical terms \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201clogical\nform\u201d are understood in such a way that [15b] is a development\nof [15a]. Thus understood, \u201cexplicature\u201d covers much more\nthan what is said, and \u201cimplicature\u201d covers much less than\nwhat is implicated as defined in\n \u00a71.\n\nBach (1994: 160) uses \u201csay\u201d even more strictly than Grice,\nmeaning \u201cstrictly, literally, and explicitly\nsay\u201d. Since the speaker of\n (15a)\n did not explicitly say\n[15b],\n Bach counts \u201cThe speaker said that Alice jumped off the\ncliff\u201d as false. Bach (1994: 125\u20136, 140\u20131; 2006:\n28\u20139) agrees with Carston, though, in withholding the term\n\u201cimplicature\u201d when what the speaker means is an\n\u201cexpansion\u201d or \u201ccompletion\u201d of what is said.\nBach introduces the term impliciture (with \u201ci\u201d\nrather than \u201ca\u201d after soft \u201cc\u201d) to cover such\ncases. Bach restricts \u201cimplicature\u201d to cases in which what\nis meant is \u201ccompletely separate\u201d from what is said.\n\nA thesis attributed to Grice is that what S says is\ndetermined by \u201cdecoding\u201d, while what S\nconversationally implicates is determined by what S says\ntogether with an inferential, pragmatic mechanism (see, e.g., Sperber\n& Wilson 1986a: 182). An alleged problem, called\n\u201cGrice\u2019s Circle\u201d (Levinson 2000: 173\u20134,\n186\u20137), is that many of the processes involved in figuring out\nwhat is said, such as reference identification and ambiguity\nresolution, \u201cinvolve exactly those inferential mechanisms that\ncharacterize Gricean\n pragmatics\u201d.[74]\n Grice never talked about decoding however, and observed himself that\nconversational principles are involved in determining what is said\n(Grice 1957: 222). For example, if an ambiguous term is used, we\nnaturally assume\u2014in the absence of specific\ncounterevidence\u2014that the intended meaning is the one relevant to\nthe conversation. In a discussion of snow, \u201cThere is a large\nbank on Main Street\u201d is naturally interpreted as referring to a\nsnow bank.\n\nThere is no circle on Grice\u2019s view because what is said is the\nconclusion of one pragmatic inference, and is one of the premises in a\nfurther pragmatic inference to what is\n implicated.[75]\n The process is serial rather than parallel, although later\nconclusions may always lead to adjustment of earlier conclusions.\n",
