Embedded (or indirect) questions\n\nInterrogative expressions can serve as the argument of certain\nclause-embedding predicates, as when someone is said to know, tell,\ncare, or wonder who, what, whether, how, or why. Where the attitude\npredicate is knowledge, these sorts of examples are called cases of\nknowledge-wh. Knowledge-how in the sense of skill-possession,\nas in \u2018Smith knows how to ride a bicycle\u2019, has generated a\nliterature of its own and is treated elsewhere (see the entry on\n knowledge how).\n \n\nThe discussion of knowledge-wh has focused mostly on whether-, what-,\nwhich-, and who-complements, as in these examples:\n\n (36) John knows\nwhether the closet is empty. \n (37) John knows what\nis in the closet. \n (38) John knows who\ncame to the meeting. \n (39) John knows where the meeting\nwas held. \n\n\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1982) provide a rich source of examples of\nintuitively valid and invalid inferences involving wh-complements,\nsuch as the following intuitively valid inference (179):\n\n (40) John believes\nthat Bill and Suzy walk; only Bill walks; hence, John doesn\u2019t\nknow who walks. \n\n",
