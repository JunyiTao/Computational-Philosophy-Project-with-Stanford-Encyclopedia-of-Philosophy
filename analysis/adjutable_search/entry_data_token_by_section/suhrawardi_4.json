    "main_text": "Logic || Definition\n2.2 Definition\n\nRule seven of the first discourse is dedicated to the notion of\ndefinition, its conditions and reconfiguration into an\nishraqi principle (PI, \u00a7\u00a713\u20135; Ziai\n1990, 77\u2013114). Suhrawardi begins by rejecting the Peripatetic\ntheory of definition that he criticizes for the inductive approach it\nadvocates as a foundation for scientific knowledge and demonstration.\nHe uses logical and semantic arguments to question its\n\u2018essentialist\u2019 definition (Aristotelian) on which\nAvicenna\u2019s own \u2018complete definition\u2019 depends. He\nrejects the claims that it is possible to obtain a complete definition\nable to encompass all the essential constituents needed to lead to the\nknowledge of that which is previously unknown and in need of a\ndefinition. Suhrawardi writes that \u201cit is clear that it is\nimpossible for a human being to construct an essential definition in\nthe way the Peripatetics require\u2014a difficulty which even their\nmaster [Aristotle or Avicenna] admits. Therefore, we have definition\nonly by means of things that specify by conjunction\u201d\n(PI, \u00a715). Suhrawardi insists that a definition should\nenumerate, in some kind of unitary formula, all the essential\nconstituents of the described object. Therefore, he includes elements\nof definition by extension (enumeration of members of a\n\u2018class\u2019) and of definition by intension (enumeration of\ndefining property or properties), for example, that \u201cthe essence\nof man (which is the truth underlying the symbol \u2018man\u2019),\nis a thing which is only recoverable [\u2026] in the\nsubject. This act of \u2018recovery\u2019 is the translation of the\nsymbol to its equivalent in the consciousness or the self of the\nsubject\u201d (Ziai 1990, 127). For Street (2008, 178), what he calls\nhis \u2018anti-essentialism\u2019, or the inability to graps\nessences discursively, as he accepts the Platonic forms, does not rest\non his logic. Suhrawardi explains his \u2018conceptualist\u2019\nnotion of definition at greater length in his Paths and\nHavens (Suh. 2006, 83, 90\u2013100). His epistemological\ncritique of the Peripatetic theory of definition is undoubtedly\ninspired by Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s own critical evaluation\nof the Isagoge which was developed in his\nal-Mu\u2018tabar (1939, vol. 1, 55\u20137; cf. Ziai 1990,\n183\u20134), but also by Suhrawardi\u2019s own understanding of the\nepistemic role of self-knowledge as presence. \n\nIn the Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi introduces his\nishraqi theory of definition that signals what some have\nidentified as a \u2018Platonic\u2019 or \u2018Neoplatonic\u2019\nturn (Ziai 1990, 114\u2013128). Now, only direct experience\nguarantees acquisition of true knowledge, such that epistemological\nconsiderations are at the heart of his reconceptualization of the\ndefinition. Suhrawardi\u2019s theory of definition thus builds on a\nPlatonic (perhaps even Neoplatonic) epistemology. Knowledge of the\nreality of things occurs through the direct apprehension of the\nintrinsic light-nature (the thing as it is) of all entities\n(see 4.). Direct knowledge occurs through\n\u2018vision-illumination\u2019, as a person realizes that what is\nto be defined becomes available to one\u2019s self through\nself-consciousness. At such time, the soul becomes directly\naware of the reality of that which is to be defined. The soul is then\nable to grasp directly those essences whose elements can then be\ntranslated using proofs and demonstrations to develop a discursive\ntype of knowledge about that original apperception of reality. \n\nIn his Paths and Havens, Suhrawardi notes that to define\nsomething is to actually \u2018see\u2019 the thing as it really is\n(Ziai 1990, 104\u201314). Suhrawardi opens the second part of his\nPhilosophy of Illumination with the following principle:\n\u201canything in existence that requires no definition or\nexplanation is evident. Since there is nothing more evident than\nlight, there is nothing less in need of definition\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7107). Light, in and of itself, is not in need of\nany definition, because in and of itself it is self-evident. Here,\nSuhrawardi posits the epistemological and ontological centrality of\nthe concept of light. He argues that only direct intuitive experience\ncan lead to knowledge of the reality (haqiqa) of things,\nwhich definitions can only attempt to describe and explain via a\nposteriori rational investigations or demonstrations (Ziai 1990,\n81). Qutb al-Din Shirazi notes that ishraqi epistemology\nrelies on this type of personal and intuitive knowledge, itself not in\nneed of any definition (Ziai 1990, 133).\n\n",
