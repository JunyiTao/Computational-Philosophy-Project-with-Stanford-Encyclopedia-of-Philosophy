    "main_text": "The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms || The Two-Tracked Theory of Democracy\n4.1 The Two-Tracked Theory of Democracy\n\nHabermas\u2019s conception of democracy has been called a \u201ctwo\ntrack\u201d theory (Baynes 1995). That said, it is more like a\n\u201ctwo complex\u201d conception, since the \u201ctracks\u201d\nin question designate the formal and informal public spheres and each\nof these is a complex. At the centre is the parliamentary complex, not\nonly parliament but the administrative and judicial bodies\naccompanying it. Parliament itself is a formal \u201cpublic\u201d\nforum that is legally established and organized to take decisions\n(1992b [1996b: 355]).\n\nIt is surrounded by and embedded in an \u201cinformal\u201d public\nsphere, an \u201copen and inclusive network\u201d of various kinds\nof discourse\u2014moral, ethical, and pragmatic\u2014that form\n\u201ca \u2018wild\u2019 complex\u201d that is not formally\norganized, even though each form of discourse has its own internal\ndiscipline. (1992b [1996b: 307]). (Habermas also calls the informal\npublic sphere \u201ccivil society\u201d to indicate that it is not\nlegally or political regulated.) When deliberative democracy works as\nit should, discourse and its outputs\u2014moral norms, values, and\nmore broadly public opinion\u2014percolate into the parliamentary\ncomplex through a system of sluices and channels (1992b [1996b: 355]).\nThese inputs are then worked up in parliamentary discussion and debate\nand eventually embodied in the form of laws and policies and returned\nas outputs into society at large. As they have been shaped by public\nopinion and shared moral values, and worked up through debate, they\nfind acceptance by citizens on the basis of the reasons they embody.\nThat is how, when things go well, according to Habermas\u2019s\ntheory, legitimate law is produced. Roughly, this is Habermas\u2019s\naccount of the production of the \u201cvalidity\u201d of modern\nlaw.\n\nThis model can also be thought of in terms of the circulation of\ncommunicative power from periphery to centre, whereby the unregulated\nflows of communication and discourse in civil society lay siege to the\npolitical system, \u201cwithout, however, intending to conquer\nit\u201d (1992b [1996b: 487]) but in a manner than allows them to\ninfluence judgement and decisions in the political system. The model\nis supposed to explain how the embers of radical democracy can stay\naflame within a modern bureaucratic state. Earlier models of popular\nsovereignty presuppose that society is \u201can association writ\nlarge\u201d or a macro-subject with a sovereign will: citizens are\nactually authors of the very laws to which they must submit, and hence\nencounter these as an expression of, not a constraint on, their\nautonomy. But such a model would only work, if at all, in small-scale,\nethically homogeneous societies, with a very high degree of popular\nparticipation, none of which applies to modern Western states (1992b\n[1996b: 102\u20133]). By contrast, Habermas\u2019s discourse theory\noffers a picture where members of civil society can, through\nparticipation in discourse, help shape public opinion, which through\nthe circulation of communicative power from periphery to centre can\nindirectly \u201cprogram\u201d or \u201ccounter-steer\u201d the\npolitical system (1992b [1996b: 372; 332]) by means of laws and\npolicies that are \u201cin the equal interest of all\u201d (1992b\n[1996b: 98; 154]). In this way, he claims, the political autonomy of\nlegal persons is ensured since they\n\n\ncan at the same time understand themselves as authors of the law to\nwhich they are subject as addressees. (1992b [1996b: 408 187])\n\n\nWilliam E. Scheuerman\u2019s objection is pertinent here. On\nHabermas\u2019s view, a law acts as a \u201ctransformer\u201d\nbetween the communicative power circulating in civil society and the\nadministrative power of the legal and political systems, and it has to\ndo so if it is to facilitate social integration. However, this view is\nincompatible with Habermas\u2019s earlier conception of system and\nlifeworld, according to which the former, which includes the legal and\nadministrative system, remains a \u201cblock of more or less norm\nfree sociality\u201d (1981 [1987: 171]). And Scheuerman points out\nthat, not only is it improbable that communicative power can be\ntransformed into administrative power and counter-steer the political\nsystem, but Habermas gives no detail about where this interface\nlies\u2014institutionally speaking\u2014and how it operates.\n\nA more radical objection stems from direction of the Rochester School\nwho consider that the very idea of a \u201ccommon good\u201d or\n\u201cthe equal interests of all\u201d that might be served by law,\nis an illusion (Riker 1982). Other realist theorists of democracy,\ne.g., Luhmann, deny that public reasons flowing into the political\nsystem from civil society can and do steer political decisions\n(Luhmann 1969).\n",
