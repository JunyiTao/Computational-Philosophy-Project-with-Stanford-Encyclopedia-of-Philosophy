    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || Bayesians Divided: What Does Coherence Require?\n1.4 Bayesians Divided: What Does Coherence Require?\n\nProbabilism is often regarded as a coherence norm, which says\nhow one\u2019s opinions ought to fit together on pain of incoherence.\nSo, if Probabilism matters, the reason seems to be that coherence\nmatters. This raises a question that divides Bayesians: What does\nthe coherence of credences require? A typical Bayesian thinks\nthat coherence requires at least that one\u2019s credences follow\nProbabilism. But there are actually different versions of Probabilism\nand Bayesians disagree about which one is correct. Bayesians also\ndisagree about whether the coherence of credences requires more than\nProbabilism and, if so, to what extent. For example, does coherence\nrequire that one\u2019s credence in a contingent proposition\nlie strictly between 0 and 1? Another issue is what coherence requires\nof conditional credences, i.e., the credences that one has on the\nsupposition of the truth of one or another proposition. Those and\nother related questions have far-reaching impacts on applications of\nBayesian epistemology. For more on the issue of what coherence\nrequires, see\n section 3.\n\n\n",
