    "main_text": "Varieties of Approaches\n3. Varieties of Approaches\n\nWe can treat the study of defeasible reasoning either (i) as a branch\nof epistemology (the theory of knowledge), or (ii) as a branch of\nlogic. In the epistemological approach, defeasible reasoning can be\nstudied as a form of inference, that is, as a process by which we add\nto our stock of knowledge. Alternatively, we could\ntreat defeat as a relation between arguments in a\ndisputational discourse.  In either version, the epistemological\napproach is concerned with the obtaining, maintaining, and\ntransmission of warrant, with the question of when an\ninference, starting with justified or warranted beliefs, produces a\nnew belief that is also warranted, given potential defeaters. This\napproach focuses explicitly on the norms of belief persistence and\nchange.\n\nIn contrast, a logical approach to defeasible reasoning fastens on a\nrelationship between propositions or possible bodies of information.\nJust as deductive logic consists of the study of a certain\nconsequence relation between propositions or sets of\npropositions (the relation of valid implication), so defeasible (or\nnonmonotonic) logic consists of the study of a different kind\nof consequence relation. Deductive consequence is monotonic: if a set\nof premises logically entails a conclusion, than any superset (any set\nof premises that includes all of the first set) will also entail that\nsome conclusion. In contrast, defeasible consequence is nonmonotonic.\nA conclusion follows defeasibly or nonmonotonically from a set of\npremises just in case it is true in nearly all of the models\nthat verify the premises, or in the most normal models that\ndo.\n\nThe two approaches are related. In particular, a logical theory of\ndefeasible consequence will have epistemological consequences. It is\npresumably true that an ideally rational thinker will have a set of\nbeliefs that are closed under defeasible, as well as deductive,\nconsequence. However, a logical theory of defeasible consequence would\nhave a wider scope of application than a merely epistemological theory\nof inference. Defeasible logic would provide a mechanism for engaging\nin hypothetical reasoning, not just reasoning from actual\nbeliefs.\n\nConversely, as David Makinson and Peter G\u00e4rdenfors have pointed\nout (Makinson and G\u00e4rdenfors 1991, 185\u2013205; Makinson 2005),\nan epistemological theory of belief change can be used to define a set\nof nonmonotonic consequence relations (one relation for each initial\nbelief state). We can define the consequence relation \\(\\alpha\n\\dproves \\beta\\), for a given set of beliefs \\(T\\), as holding just in\ncase the result of adding belief \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(T\\) would include\nbelief in \\(\\beta\\). However, on this approach, there would be many\ndistinct nonmonotonic consequence relations, instead of a single\nperspective-independent one.\n\nAnd, as Phan Minh Dung has argued (Dung 1995), formal argumentation\ncan also be used to provide a basis for defining a nonmonotonic\nconsequence relation. A formal argument structure \\(F\\) is an ordered\npair \\(\u27e8A, B\u27e9\\), where \\(A\\) is a set of arguments, and \\(B\\) is a\nbinary relation on \\(A\\) (the attack relation). Then we can\nsay that an argument structure \\(F\\) has \\(p\\) has a consequence just\nin case \\(p\\) is the conclusion of some argument in the\noptimal extension of \\(F\\) (which can be defined in a variety\nof ways--see section 4.4).\n",
