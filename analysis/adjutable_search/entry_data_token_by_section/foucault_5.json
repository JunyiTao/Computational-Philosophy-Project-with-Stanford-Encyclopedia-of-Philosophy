    "main_text": "Major Works || From Archaeology to Genealogy\n3.3 From Archaeology to Genealogy\n\nFoucault explicitly presents The Order of Things as an\n\u201carchaeological\u201d approach to the history of thought. Three\nyears later, in 1969, he published The Archaeology of\nKnowledge, a methodological treatise that explicitly formulates\nwhat he took to be the archaeological method that he used not only in\nThe Order of Things but also (at least implicitly) in\nHistory of Madness and The Birth of the Clinic. The\nkey idea of the archaeological method is that systems of thought and\nknowledge (epistemes or discursive formations, in Foucault\u2019s\nterminology) are governed by rules, beyond those of grammar and logic,\nthat operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects and\ndefine a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the\nboundaries of thought in a given domain and period. So, for example,\nHistory of Madness should, Foucault maintained, be read as an\nintellectual excavation of the radically different discursive\nformations that governed talk and thought about madness from the\nseventeenth through the nineteenth centuries.\n\nArchaeology was an essential method for Foucault because it supported\na historiography that did not rest on the primacy of the consciousness\nof individual subjects; it allowed the historian of thought to operate\nat an unconscious level that displaced the primacy of the subject\nfound in both phenomenology and in traditional historiography.\nHowever, archaeology\u2019s critical force was restricted to the\ncomparison of the discursive formations of different periods. Such\ncomparisons could suggest the contingency of a given way of thinking\nby showing that the people living in previous ages had thought very\ndifferently (and, apparently, just as effectively). But mere\narchaeological analysis could say nothing about the causes of the\ntransition from one way of thinking to another and so had to ignore\nperhaps the most forceful case for the contingency of entrenched\ncontemporary positions. Genealogy, the new method first deployed in\nDiscipline and Punish, was intended to remedy this\ndeficiency.\n\nFoucault intended the term \u201cgenealogy\u201d to evoke\nNietzsche\u2019s genealogy of morals, particularly with its\nsuggestion of complex, mundane, inglorious origins\u2014in no way\npart of any grand scheme of progressive history. The point of a\ngenealogical analysis is to show that a given system of thought\n(itself uncovered in its essential structures by archaeology, which\ntherefore remains part of Foucault\u2019s historiography) was the\nresult of contingent turns of history, not the outcome of rationally\ninevitable trends.\n",
