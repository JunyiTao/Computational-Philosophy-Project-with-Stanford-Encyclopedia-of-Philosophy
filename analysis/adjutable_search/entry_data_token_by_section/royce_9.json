    "main_text": "Logic || Modal Logic of Agency\n3.4 Royce\u2019s Logic and Formal Mathematics\n\nRoyce was deeply interested in the developing theories of logic,\nmathematics, and geometry in the 1890s and early 1900s. While he had a\nlifelong interest in logic and mathematics, it was not until 1898,\nwhen he attended a series of lectures by C. S. Peirce titled\nReasoning and the Logic of Things (1898 [1992]), that he\nundertook a thorough study of the work of Cantor, Dedekind, Klein,\nCayley and Kempe. Royce regarded Peirce\u2019s lectures as\n\u201cepoch marking,\u201d as he noted in a letter to James (1970,\n422), in part because new mathematical theory gave him a way to\naddress a central criticism of his metaphysics.\n\nIn the years immediately prior to the Peirce lectures, Royce\u2019s\nmetaphysical views had been sharply criticized on the grounds that his\nconcept of the Absolute had made individuals unreal, subsumed by the\nwhole (Howison in Royce 1897, 98\u20139). Royce countered the\ncriticism, by arguing that the Absolute was a system that was composed\nof real individuals (2000, 297, 314\u20135). Royce, however, was\nunable to provide a compelling formal argument for the possibility of\na system in which the parts of a whole could also be distinct, a view\nrejected with a well-known argument of F. H. Bradley (Royce 1959,\n477\u2013485). Peirce\u2019s 1898 lecture included a case for his\nthen-current conception of continuity (he proposed several) in which\nthe unified whole was a logical consequence of a universe of discrete\nindividuals (Moore 2007), that is, where \u201cwe have now reached a\nmultitude so vast that the individuals of such a collection melt into\none another and lose their distinct identities\u201d (Peirce 1898\n[1992, 159]). In making his case, Peirce called on resources from\nBoole, Cantor, Dedekind and Kempe among others. By 1900, Royce offered\nhis own version of continuity, the concept of an infinite,\nself-representative system. Published as a lengthy\n\u201csupplementary essay\u201d to The World and\nIndividual, First Series, and framed as an answer to Bradley,\nRoyce aimed to provide a proof that a single infinite system could\ncontain multitudes of distinct individuals.\n\nBy 1901, Royce had begun to reframe his metaphysics in terms of the\nErlanger Programm, devised by Klein (1893) as a means of\nclassifying different geometries by identifying what is invariant\nacross transformations in each system. Klein demonstrated that the\ninvariants of projective geometry could be captured in a set of\npostulates that would also hold for Euclidean and other non-Euclidean\ngeometries each of which included the invariants of projective\ngeometry and additional invariants (Bell, 1940, 442\u2013448). Royce\nargued that Kempe\u2019s system, and Royce\u2019s own System\n\\(\\Sigma\\), were defined by abstract postulates that would be\nnecessary for any system of order whatever including projective\ngeometry. In unpublished notes from 1901, Royce explicitly attributed\nthe source of his discussion to the Erlanger Programm and\nargued that invariants of the sort identified by Kempe are illustrated\nin projective geometry, \u201cjust\u201d land transactions,\n\u201cKant\u2019s moral world,\u201d musical performance, and\nselves. For Royce, the invariants of geometry and so findings based\nupon their analysis could directly inform the analysis of other\nordering processes (1901, 96\u2013110).\n\nThe publication of \u201cThe Relation of the Principles of Logic to\nthe Foundations of Geometry\u201d (1905) and \u201cAn Extension of\nthe Algebra of Logic\u201d (1913b) were significant works of pure\nmathematics but were also intended to illustrate invariants across\ntransformations of all sorts. Burch (2011) has left open the question\nof how Royce\u2019s work in mathematical logic is related to his\ngeneral philosophical project, but has argued that Royce nevertheless\nmade a significant contribution to mathematical logic by developing\nthe concept of a Boolean Ring and an algebra identical to the system\ndevised at about the same time by Russian logician, Ivan Ivanovich\nZhegalkin, renowned as \u201cthe \u2018father\u2019 of the Russian\nschool of logic\u201d (231). Central to the Boolean Ring operations\nand to the larger System \\(\\Sigma\\) is Royce\u2019s development of\nthe operation of symmetric difference (discussed elsewhere as the \\(O\\)-relation),\nwhich is also viewed as one of\nRoyce\u2019s major contributions by later reviewers, Burton and\nLeblanc (1952). While Burch suggests the possibility of a full\nexposition of System \\(\\Sigma\\), apart from Royce\u2019s own there is\ncurrently no such treatment available. Burch also discusses\nRoyce\u2019s work in philosophical logic in the introduction to a\npaper by Royce addressing Russell\u2019s paradox as presented in\nRussell\u2019s 1903 The Principles of Logic. This paper,\nBurch argues, both demonstrates Royce\u2019s familiarity with\ndevelopments in modern logic at the time and presents an alternative\nresolution of the paradox similar to Frege\u2019s response while also\noffering a non-foundational set theory (1987). Other important\nassessments of Royce\u2019s work in mathematics and logic include\nearly reviews by Sheffer (1908), De Laguna (1906), and C. I. Lewis\n(1916), and more recent assessments in papers by Crouch (2011) and\nScanlan (2011).\n",
