    "main_text": "Relevance and Difference-Making\n7. Relevance and Difference-Making\n\nSince MacColl\u2019s and C. I. Lewis\u2019s strictures against\nmaterial implication, there has been an increasing number of voices\narguing that some notion of relevant connection between antecedent and\nconsequent is part of the meaning of conditionals. In the area of\nconditionals, the notion of relevance is claimed by distinct\ntraditions, however, and means slightly different\n things.[9]\n\nOne tradition concerns so-called relevant logics, designed to\nformulate a more demanding notion of implication than Lewis\u2019s\nstrict implication (cf. Meyer & Routley 1973). The idea of\nrelevant implication is based in large part on the idea that the\nantecedent and the consequent of an acceptable conditional \\(A>B\\)\nmust be connected in terms of topics. For example, a\nconditional of the form \\((p \\wedge \\neg p) > q\\) need not be\nvalid, despite having an impossible antecedent, since the consequent\nshares no content with the antecedent. Various constraints can be\nimposed on the idea of content-sharing, leading to various\nnon-classical logics of so-called relevant implication (see\nMares\u2019s 2020 SEP entry on relevant logics for an overview, and\nWeiss 2019 on the use of analytic entailment to deal with\nSextus\u2019 so-called fourth conditional).\n\nAnother approach to the notion of relevance is in terms of the idea\nthat the antecedent of a conditional should make a difference to the\ntruth, assertability or probability of the consequent. Consider a\nconditional like \u201cif London is in England, then Aristotle was a\nGreek philosopher\u201d. The conditional sounds odd because the truth\nof the antecedent does not matter to the truth of the consequent.\nWhile relevant logics capture the idea of relevance in terms of\ntopic-sharing, here the idea of relevance is captured in terms of the\ndifference that the antecedent makes for the consequent.\n\nThe idea of difference-making itself can be formulated in\nseveral ways. One way is proposed by Douven, in what he calls the\n\u201cEvidential support thesis\u201d (\u201cEST\u201d, Douven\n[2008, 2016: 108]). Basically, the EST says that a conditional\n\\(A>C\\) is relevantly assertable provided \\(\\Pr(C|A)\\) exceeds a\nsufficiently high threshold and \\(\\Pr(C|A)>\\Pr(C)\\). Douven\u2019s\nmain argument in support of the latter condition\u2014which is a\nrelevance criterion\u2014is that high probability is not enough for\nassertion. He gives the example of the following minimal pair:\n\n(8)\n\n\na.\nIf there is at least 1 Head in the first 10 tosses of this coin,\nthen there is at least 1 Head in the first 100,000 tosses.\nb.\nIf Chelsea wins the Champion\u2019s league, then there is at\nleast 1 Head in the first 100,000 tosses.\n \n\n\nBoth statements are such that the probability of the consequent given\nthe antecedent is high. However, in (8)-b the antecedent does not\nincrease the probability of the consequent, it is irrelevant in that\nsense, and the conditional may be called a \u201cnon-interference\nconditional\u201d. Douven (2016) defines validity in terms of\nacceptability-preservation according to the EST criterion, for all\nthresholds \\(t\\in [0.5, 1)\\). The resulting logic is weak, in\nparticular it violates Modus Ponens, RW, AND, CMon, Cut, OR and\nContraposition. Douven establishes the validity and invalidity of\nspecific principles (see Douven 2016: Theorem 5.2.1), but a sound and\ncomplete axiomatization of his logic is still an open problem.\n\nMore recently, an alternative approach was proposed by Crupi and\nIacona (forthcoming-b), yielding a stronger logic. Crupi and Iacona\nuse the Rips measure of confirmation and associate to a conditional\n\\(A>C\\) a score defined as \n\n\\[\\frac{P(C|A)-P(C)}{1-P(C)}\\]\n\n\nwhen \\(P(C|A)>P(C)\\), and defined to be equal to \\(0\\) otherwise.\nThis yields a modified score of \u201cuncertainty\u201d for a\nconditional, which they substitute for the standard notion of\nuncertainty in Adams\u2019s definition of \\(p\\)-validity. The logic\nthey identify violates RW and Cut, but it validates AND, CMon, OR,\nModus Ponens, restricted forms of Aristotle\u2019s and\nAbelard\u2019s theses (principles of connexive logic), and even\nContraposition. Crupi and Iacona (forthcoming-a) present a\npossible-worlds semantics for what appears to be the same logic, in\nwhich contraposition plays a central role.\n\nAhead of this recent wave of work, Rott (1986) pioneered another\nmeasure of relevance in a belief revision framework, a measure picked\nup by Spohn (2013), and proposed independently in various accounts of\ncausality. Arguing against Conjunctive Sufficiency (see\n sections 2.2),\n Rott\u2019 suggests that a \u201cdifference-making\u201d\nconditional \\(A>C\\) is accepted provided \\(C\\in K*A\\) and \\(C\\notin\nK*\\neg A\\). This is a relevantized variant of the Ramsey Test, ruling\nthat the conditional is accepted provided the revision by \\(A\\)\nresults in the belief that \\(C\\), but the revision by \\(\\neg A\\) does\nnot result in the belief that \\(C\\). Using the terminology of\n\u201cdifference-making conditionals\u201d, Rott (forthcoming) calls\nthe violation of RW the hallmark of conditionals that encode the idea\nthat the antecedent is positively relevant to the consequent. This\nyields a logic that also invalidates CMon, Cut, Or and Contraposition,\nbut it validates And, Aristotle\u2019s theses, a restricted form of\nAbelard\u2019s thesis as well as conditions such as\n\n(\\(>\\)1)\nIf \\(A >B\\wedge C\\), then \\(A>B\\) or \\(A>C\\).\n(\\(>\\)2a)\n\\(A>C \\tiff (A >A\\wedge C \\text{ and }A >A\\vee C)\\).\n\n\nIn general conditionals with a relevance reading tend to behave in\nrather unusual and unruly ways. Raidl (2021) develops a general\ntechnique of transferring completeness results for more\n\u201cwell-behaved\u201d suppositional conditionals \\(>\\) to\nrelevance-expressing conditionals definable in terms of \\(>\\). He\nis thus able to cover the proposal of Crupi and Iacona as well as that\nof Rott in a unified manner.\n\nRott\u2019s proposal turns out to be related to what is known as the\n\u201cdifference measure\u201d or as the \u201cscore of\ncontingency\u201d \n\n\\[\\Delta(p)=P(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)-P(C|\\neg A)\\]\n\n\nin the psychology of causality (Shanks 1995; Cheng 1997). In\nparticular, (Skovgaard-Olsen et al. 2016) found that depending on\nwhether this measure is positive, negative, or null, the probability\nof a conditional may or may not equal the conditional probability. In\nother words, relevance considerations appear to interact with\nassignments of probabilities to conditionals, the main finding being\nthat Adams\u2019 Thesis appears to hold good only when \\(\\Delta(p)\\)\nis positive. The equation breaks down, on the other hand, when\n\\(\\Delta(p)\\) is null, so precisely in the case of non-interference\nconditionals. Furthermore, Rooij and Schulz (2019) argue that an even\nbetter predictor of the acceptability of conditionals is given by a\nnormalized measure of contingency, that is, by the measure\n\n\\[\\Delta^*(p) = \\frac{P(C|A)-P(C|\\neg A)}{1-P(C|\\neg A)}.\\]\n\n\nWhether in logic or in the psychology of reasoning, the investigation\nof relevance measures and of the resulting inferences is currently a\nvery active field in the study of conditionals.\n",
