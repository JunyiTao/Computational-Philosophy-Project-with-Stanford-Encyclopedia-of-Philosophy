    "main_text": "Emotions, Affective Sensitivity, and Chinese Philosophy || Emotions in Western Philosophy and Psychology\n1.1 Emotions in Western Philosophy and Psychology\n\nIn Western philosophy and psychology, emotions are defined as inner\npsychological states with subjective feelings that are contrasted with\ncognitive states and processes of the mind. If one believes that\n\u20181+1=2\u2019, this cognitive state, in itself, does not come\nwith particular feelings, motivate specific actions, or facilitate\nobservable embodied expressions. Nor does it draw any evaluative\njudgments. Regardless of one\u2019s feelings or motivations, one can\nsimply believe that \u20181+1=2\u2019 is true. In addition, emotions\nare often associated with strong desires or passions that can conflict\nwith rational reasoning and reflective thinking. In his\nRepublic (Book IV), Plato argues that the soul\n(psyche) consists of three distinctive components, reason\n(logistikon), spirit (thumoeides), and appetite\n(epithumetikon). He puts reason against the affective\ncomponents of the mind. Stoic philosophers characterized emotions as\ninexplicable passion, uncontrollable urge, or irrational fear.\nAccording to Arius Didymus (a Stoic philosopher of the early Roman\nEmpire), emotional states are \u201cexcessive impulses which are\ndisobedient to reason\u201d (translated in Pomeroy 1999: 65A).\nDescartes (1649 [1989: 385]) believed that passion is internal\ndispositions and tendencies moved by external events that can go\nagainst rational understanding of the world. Although recent\npublications demonstrate strong academic interest in emotions in\nWestern philosophy and psychology (Damasio 1994; De Sousa 1987;\nGibbard 1990; Haidt 2001; Lutz 1988; Nichols 2004; Nussbaum 2001;\nPrinz 2004; Solomon 1984), emotions are still understood from the viewpoints of\nsubjectivity, phenomenality, motivation, passion and desire. \n",
