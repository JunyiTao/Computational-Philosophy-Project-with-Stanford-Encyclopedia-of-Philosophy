    "main_text": "Some (Unresolved) Empirical Issues || Content\n6.1 Content\n\nThe above discussion of the concept of alienation\u2014clarifying its\nbasic shape, sketching some of its theoretical forms, and introducing\na few complexities\u2014still leaves many issues unresolved.\nThese include many empirical and quasi-empirical issues. The\npresent section is concerned with some of the\nempirical assumptions and claims that appear in what might be\ncalled broadly philosophical accounts of alienation of the kind\ndiscussed above. It is not directly concerned with the extensive\nsocial scientific literature on alienation. That latter\nliterature is often preoccupied\nwith \u2018operationalising\u2019 the concept\u2014for\ninstance, treating job satisfaction or absenteeism as proxies of\nalienated work\u2014in order to engineer predictive models in\ndisciplines (including education, psychology, sociology, and\nmanagement studies) dealing with a variety of real world contexts\n(see e.g. Chiaburu et al 2014).\n\nAs an example of some of the empirical dimensions of broadly\nphilosophical accounts of alienation, consider Marx\u2019s\ncharacterisation of capitalist society as characterised by\nseparations which frustrate self-realisation, especially\nself-realisation in work. To come to a considered judgement about the\nplausibility of his views on this topic, one would have to be in a\nposition to assess, amongst other issues, whether work in capitalist\nsocieties is necessarily alienated. One would need to judge not only\nwhether existing work is rightly characterised as alienated (as\nforced, frustrating self-realisation, not intended to satisfy the\nneeds of others, and not appropriately appreciated by those others),\nbut also, if so, whether it could be made meaningful and unalienated\nwithout undermining the very features which made the relevant society\na capitalist one. (There are, of course, also many more\nnormative-looking issues here regarding that account of human\nflourishing: whether, for example, Marx overestimates the value of\ncreative and fulfilling work, and underestimates the value of,\nsay, leisure and intellectual excellence.) Reaching anything like a\nconsidered judgment on these empirical and quasi-empirical issues\nwould clearly require some complicated factual assessments of, amongst\nother issues, the composition and functioning of human nature and the\nextant social world.\n",
