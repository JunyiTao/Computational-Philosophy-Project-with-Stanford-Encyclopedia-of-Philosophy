    "main_text": "The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture\n4.  The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture\n\nA central issue of debate in the Critical Philosophy of Race has been\nhow to understand the causes of racism in relation to economic\nmotivations and the system of capitalism as well as cultural forces\nand social ideology. Orthodox Marxists often sidelined issues of\nracism, diminishing the struggle against racism as a struggle for\nbourgeois rights within a legal system that would remain structurally\nunjust under capitalism. Some thought the focus on racism would divide\nthe working class and weaken solidarity. Despite the weakness of these\narguments, it remains true that some anti-racist agendas sideline\neconomic issues and focus on representational equity at the top of the\npyramid. This has led to an ongoing debate about how to relate the\nissue of race with the issue of class (Grosfoguel 2016).\n",
