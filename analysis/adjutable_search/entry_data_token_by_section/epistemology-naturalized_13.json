    "main_text": "Other Topics and Approaches\n6. Other Topics and Approaches\n\nThe discussion of the past few sections has focused on the views and\narguments of select figures within NE. The rationale for this focus\nhas been twofold: first, because the positions and figures in\nquestion have been at the forefront of recent discussions of NE; and\nsecond, because the general epistemological affinity between Kornblith\nand Goldman in particular (i.e., their common adherence to\nreliabilism) has allowed us to isolate and appreciate both the central\nchallenges to NE and some of the major points of difference among its\nadvocates. Once again, however, the selective focus above should not\nobscure the fact that many other naturalistic epistemological theories have\nbeen offered\n (Section 1.2).\n Thus, for example, in addition to reliabilist (Goldman, Kornblith),\npragmatic (Stich), and information-theoretic (Dretske) views,\nteleo-functional thinking has been used in proffered accounts of both\nknowledge (Millikan 1984) and epistemic entitlement (Graham 2012).\nPollock (1986, 1987), and Pollock and Cruz (1999), seek to understand\nepistemic justification in terms of conformity to procedural norms of\nbelief-formation, the correctness of which is ensured by the contents\nof the relevant concepts. And\nothers\u2014\u201cnonfactualists\u201d such as Field (1998), and\n\u201cexpressivists\u201d such as Chrisman (2007)\u2014regard the\nuse of epistemic terms, and the explicit endorsement of specific\nepistemic norms and evaluations, as essentially a matter of expressing\none\u2019s attitudes, pro and con. These and other specific views\nrepresent other ongoing attempts to understand various epistemic\nconcepts and/or phenomena in a naturalistic manner. While each faces\ndistinct challenges, qua naturalistic views, the most\npressing issues facing them are those discussed above.\n\nIn addition to such positions with regard to specific epistemic\nmatters, there are other regions of epistemology in which NE figures\nprominently. This final section briefly describes three further such areas\u2014social epistemology,\nfeminist epistemology, and the debate over (epistemic)\nrationality.\n",
