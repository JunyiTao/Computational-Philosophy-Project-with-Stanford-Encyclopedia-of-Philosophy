The inquirers assume that a negation specifies\nthe opposite of the item negated (Sophist 240b,\n240d).  Think of opposites as polar incompatibles\u2014a\npair of opposed terms that exclude each other. These include polar\ncontraries, such as black and white, or hot and cold, which have some\nintermediate between them; and contradictories, such as odd and even,\nlarge and not-large, or beautiful and not-beautiful, which do not (see\nKeyt 1973, 300 n. 33). If not-being is the opposite of being, then\nnot-being is nothing at all, and we cannot think about that. A second\nsource of trouble about not-being infects being as well. The speakers\nmistakenly assume that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a\nname and a thing: a name picks out something, different names pick out\ndifferent things, and each thing has one proper name. The Stranger\nlater attributes the idea to some people he derisively calls\nLate-Learners, who urge that we call a thing only by its own name and\nnot by any other. Thus they allow us to call a man \u201cman\u201d\nand the good \u201cgood,\u201d but they do not allow us to call a\nman \u201cgood\u201d (Sophist 251b\u2013c) (for this\ninterpretation of the Late-Learners, see Moravcsik 1962, 57\u201359;\ncf. Bostock 1984, 99\u2013100, Roberts 1986, 230, and Malcolm 2006a,\n278).\n\n\nGiven these assumptions, it seems impossible to talk about not-being\ncoherently (on the puzzles about not-being, cf. Owen 1971,\n241\u201344).  The first puzzle (Sophist 237b\u2013e) shows\nthat we cannot meaningfully use the phrase \u201cwhat-is-not,\u201d\nbecause the phrase attempts and fails to pick out nothing. The second\npuzzle (Sophist 238a\u2013c) shows that we cannot say\nanything meaningful about what-is-not (i.e., about nothing), because\nin using the words \u201cwhat-is-not\u201d we treat the referent as\none thing (by using the singular). The third puzzle (Sophist\n238d\u2013239c) shows that we contradict ourselves even trying to\nstate the puzzles. If not-being is the opposite of being (i.e.,\nnothing), and if there is a one-to-one correspondence between a name\nand a thing, then Parmenides was right: we cannot coherently think or\ntalk about not-being. The Stranger still finds these puzzles\npersuasive at the end of the dialogue, because he says: \u201cIf a\nstatement is of nothing, it would not be a statement at all,\nfor we have shown that a statement that is a statement\n(logos) of nothing cannot be a statement\u201d\n(Sophist 263c). In a final pair of puzzles (Sophist\n239c\u2013240c; 240c\u2013241b), the Stranger shows that Parmenides\nalso provides the sophist a means to escape his pursuers\n(Sophist 241a\u2013c). The sophist does not say what-is-not\nafter all, because his images, while not the originals, are\nsomething\u2014images like the originals\u2014and not nothing. The\nspeakers later recognize that they made a mistake in assuming that\nnot-being is the opposite of being (Sophist 257b, 258e), but\nat this stage negation confounds them.\n\n\nThis entry skips over the puzzles about being, which aim to show that\nwe are in as much confusion about being as we are about not-being, a\nsituation that gives the Stranger hope: to the extent that he and\nTheaetetus get clear about being or not-being, they will get clear\nabout the other as well (Sophist 250e\u2013251a) (Owen 1971,\n229\u201331, calls this claim the \u201cParity\nAssumption.\u201d)[2]\n\n",
