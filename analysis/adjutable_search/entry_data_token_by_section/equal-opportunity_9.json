    "main_text": "The Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n10. The Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nDifferent conceptions of Equality of Opportunity tend to be aligned\nwith different views about what might be called the\n\u201cscope\u201d of Equality of Opportunity. There are two\ndimensions of the scope of Equality of Opportunity which might be\nhelpfully distinguished. First, there is the matter of the range of\ngoods or positions that considerations of Equality of Opportunity are\nrelevant for. Narrower views of the scope of Equality of Opportunity\nrestrict its application to a limited range of offices and positions\nallocated through a competitive process. Wider views of the scope\nmight encompass a broader range of positions, goods, and\nrelationships. Call this the \u201cgoods scope\u201d of Equality of\nOpportunity. Second, there is the matter of the range of persons\ndeemed relevant for Equality of Opportunity. Suppose it is claimed\nthat French society offers Equality of Opportunity for holding\npolitical office, in the sense that there are no formal or informal\nconstraints of relevance which stand between any French citizen and\nseeking to hold such office. Still, it might be that only French\ncitizens are eligible to run for political office, so the scope of\napplication of Equality of Opportunity is limited to French citizens.\nCall this the \u201cperson scope\u201d of Equality of\nOpportunity.\n",
