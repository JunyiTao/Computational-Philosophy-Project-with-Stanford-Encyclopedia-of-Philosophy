    "main_text": "Responsibility || Taking Another\u2019s Perspective\n3.2 Taking Another\u2019s Perspective\n\nAnother contribution feminists have made to the issue of\nresponsibility is the notion of taking another\u2019s perspective.\nNaomi Zack identifies the problem with racists, which, I believe, can\nbe applied to sexists, as being that a racist \u201clacks basic moral\nor ethical impulses to identify with other living beings [who are not\nmembers of the group with which the racist or sexist\nidentifies],\u201d and that such identification \u201crests on the\nability to seriously imagine oneself in the place of another\u201d\n(1998, 42\u201343). Being able to imagine oneself in another\u2019s\nplace allows a person to realize that being the object of racism is a\npainful experience, and then to take steps to stop racist behavior\nboth in themselves and in others. This bears on the issue of\nresponsibility in the following way: those in the dominant class might\nclaim that they are unable to take the perspective of the\nnon-privileged, and since \u201c\u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019,\u201d they have no obligation to do so (Superson,\n2004, 47).\n\nFeminists have made several suggestions about how the privileged might\ncome to take the perspective of the non-privileged. Sandra Bartky and\nIris Young have identified the phenomena of \u201ccultural\ndomination,\u201d or \u201ccultural imperialism,\u201d according to\nwhich the non-privileged are made to see most things in a culture from\nthe perspective of the dominant group, which serves to erase the\nimportance, if not the identity, of those in the former group (Bartky\n1990, 25; Young 1988, 285\u2013286). We might think that if the\nnon-privileged can be made to see things from the perspective of the\ndominant group, the latter are capable of seeing things from the\nperspective of the former. The first step to take in seeing things\nfrom the perspective of the oppressed might be to disaffiliate oneself\nfrom one\u2019s privilege. So argues Marilyn Frye about white\nwomen\u2019s disaffiliating themselves from their whiteliness (1995).\nFrye argues that white women feminists should stop constantly making\nthemselves \u201cwhitely,\u201d which she defines as a character of\npersons similar to masculinity whereby a person does not admit to\nbeing prejudiced, biased, and mean, yet at the same time is\npretentious, rude, condescending, overbearing, and patronizing.\nWhiteliness interferes with white women\u2019s ability to form\nalliances with women of other races, and even though\n\u201cunbecoming\u201d whitely will not eradicate racism, Frye\nbelieves it is a necessary step to doing so.\n\nMaria Lugones takes Frye\u2019s proposal a step further, introducing\nthe notion of \u201cworld-traveling,\u201d defined as\n\u201ctraveling\u201d to the world of others who occupy a different\nposition in the social hierarchy (1995). Lugones believes that\nworld-traveling allows the privileged to come to see things from the\nperspective of the oppressed and even to come to see how the oppressed\nsee the privileged: world-traveling will aid in overcoming cultural\nimperialism. Lugones notes that white women, for instance, have an\nobligation out of friendship to abandon their imperialism and come to\nsee things from the perspective of Hispanic women. We might apply\nLugones\u2019s idea more generally to the privileged and the\noppressed. To understand the notion of world-traveling, Lugones uses\nthe example of whether she is playful or not: in some worlds she finds\nthat she is, but in other worlds, she finds that she is serious.\nWhether she is playful, or more accurately, seen as playful,\nis a matter of how the dominant group constructs the concept of\nplayfulness. Lugones believes that in order to world-travel, one needs\nto give up the arrogant construction of concepts from one\u2019s own\nperspective. We can apply Lugones\u2019s notion of world-traveling to\nthe idea discussed in Section 3.1 of coming to see the non-privileged\nas being equal in humanity to the privileged. The privileged would\nhave to see the non-privileged as likes by directing their attention\naway from themselves and toward the nonprivileged, by appreciating the\npersonhood status of the nonprivileged, and by coming to understand\nthe complex hurts involved in oppression which requires recognizing\nthe interconnections between the systematically related barriers and\nforces that keep a group oppressed (Superson 2004, 38\u201349).\nFurther, in Lugones\u2019 words, the privileged would have to\nunderstand not as an observer but as a participant in a particular\nworld.\n\nBut not all feminists believe that the privileged can\n\u2018world-travel.\u2019 Laurence Thomas, for instance, argues that\nthe privileged cannot come to know the position of their subordinates\nbecause they cannot even grasp the latter\u2019s experiences (1999).\nAccording to Thomas, heterosexual men cannot imagine how a female rape\nvictim feels, since they cannot imagine the fear of rape that most if\nnot all women feel, and do not have to deal with social attitudes that\nmake them targets of sexual violence. By the same token, a white\nperson does not know what it is for a black person to experience a\nfeeling of being a second-class citizen when attacked by a group of\nwhites, nor can a white person come to know it if attacked by a group\nof blacks. Thomas believes that in oppressive societies, the\nprivileged are socially constituted differently from the oppressed,\nand so have different emotional configurations, making them experience\nthings in different ways (186). Being viewed as less than full and\nequal members of society, and having painful memories of these\nexperiences, are necessary conditions for the privileged\nperson\u2019s being able to take the perspective of the oppressed,\nwhich he is simply unable to do given his social condition. Whether\nthis absolves the privileged from responsibility for oppression is not\nsomething Thomas addresses in the context of this discussion, but he\nargues that the privileged have an obligation to engage in\n\u201cmoral deference,\u201d that is, to defer to those who speak in\nan informed way about experiences specific to their position of\nsubordination to which others do not have access. He asserts that any\nmorally decent, self-respecting person should listen to\nanother\u2019s moral story and acquire sensibility to the way in\nwhich that person lives in the world as a member of an oppressed group\n(189).\n\nSome philosophers invoke more traditional philosophical tools such as\nanalogies to get those in dominant groups to take the perspective of\nthose in subordinate groups. Judith Jarvis Thomson, in her seminal\narticle on abortion (1971), offers science-fiction-like analogies that\nserve as ways for men and women alike to imagine themselves in the\nposition of women who are considering the moral status of abortion in\ncases of rape, when the mother\u2019s life is at stake, and when\ncontraception has failed. The analogies require men, who do not\nexperience pregnancy, to imagine what it would be like to have a\nkidnapped violinist hooked up to them for nine months, or to be\ntrapped in a house with a rapidly growing baby that will crush them to\ndeath, or to live in a house with fine mesh screens only to have\npeople seeds drift in and take root in the carpeting and upholstery\nand grow into full-fledged persons for whom they are responsible.\nFeminist philosophers who write from a personal perspective attempt to\nget those in the dominant group to take the perspective of those in\nthe subordinate group by describing in detail their experience of\nbeing a victim of a sexist act or practice (see Section 5).\n",
