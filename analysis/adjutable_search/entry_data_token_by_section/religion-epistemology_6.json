    "main_text": "Reformed Epistemology\n7. Reformed Epistemology\n\n\nAn influential contemporary rejection of evidentialism is reformed\nepistemology, due to Wolterstorff (1976) and Plantinga (1983). As\nPlantinga develops it in his paper (1983), beliefs\nare warranted without Enlightenment-approved evidence\nprovided they are (a) grounded, and (b) defended against known\nobjections. Such beliefs may then themselves be used as evidence for\nother beliefs. But what grounding amounts to could be debated. Later,\nPlantinga proposed an account of warrant as proper functioning. This\naccount seems to entail that S\u2019s belief that p\nis grounded in event E if (a) in the circumstances E\ncaused S to believe that p, and\n(b) S\u2019s coming to believe that p was a case of\nproper functioning (Plantinga 1993b). It should be noted that the term\n\u201cwarrant\u201d used elsewhere in philosophy as a synonym for\n\u201cjustified\u201d (as in \u201cwarranted assertibility\u201d)\nis used by Plantinga to mean that which has to be adjoined to a true\nbelief for it to be knowledge. (See Plantinga 1993a). Accordingly the\nmost pressing criticism of Plantinga\u2019s later position is that it\nlargely ignores the question of justification, or reasonableness\nwhich, as Swinburne explicates it (Swinburne 2001) amounts to whether\nthe religious beliefs are probable relative to total evidence.\n\n\nWhile the details of grounding might be controversial it may be assumed\nthat reformed epistemologists  assert that ordinary religious\nexperiences of awe, gratitude, contrition, etc., ground the beliefs\nimplied by the believer\u2019s sincere reports of such experiences, provided\nthey can be said to cause those beliefs. Such grounded beliefs are\nwarranted provided they can be defended against known objections. They\ncan then be used as evidence for further religious beliefs. Thus if\nreligious experience grounds the belief that God has forgiven you for\ndoing what is wrong to other humans beings, then that is evidence for a\npersonal God who acts in a morally upright fashion. For, it can be\nargued, only such a God would find anything to forgive in the wrongs you\ndo to your fellow human beings.\n\n\nJerome Gellman (1992, 2017) draws our attention to the experience of\ngodlessness. This is occasioned by, but not inferred from, the evils\nthat surround us. If Reformed Epistemology is correct this would seem\nto ground atheism in the same way that the experience of forgiveness\ncan ground theism.\n\n\nOne difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the\nformer requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter\nmight dismiss such objections as either irrelevant or, worse,\nintellectual temptations. Included in the objections are not only\nthose such as the Argument from Evil that seek to rebut, but arguments\nfrom sociology and, more recently, cognitive science that seek to\nundermine by proposing a naturalistic cause for basic religious\nbeliefs. For instance, Justin Barrett (2004) posits a HADD\n(hyperactive/hypersensitive agency detection device), suggesting that\na sensitive agency detection device functions properly if the goal is\nsurvival but is hypersensitive if the goal is truth. This\nhypersensitivity then explains the human tendency towards supernatural\nbeliefs, undermining the proper basicality of those beliefs. Clark and\nBarrett (2011) suggest that this hypersensitivity could itself be part\nof the divine plan. An alternative, Bayesian, theistic response would\nbe that HADD exaggerates a properly basic probability for theism that\nis neither high nor too low prior to further evidence. This justifies\na part evidentialist, part reformed, program of assessing the\nall-things-considered probability resulting from the effect of\nevidence on this basic probability.\n\nA difference between reformed epistemology and Wittgensteinian fideism\nis that the former proposes a universal relaxation of the stringent\nconditions of evidentialism while the latter only proposes a\nrelaxation for some\u201clanguage games\u201d, including\nreligion.\n\n\nReformed epistemology could be correct and yet far less significant\nthan its proponents take it to be. That would occur if in fact rather\nfew religious beliefs are grounded in the sorts of ordinary religious\nexperiences most believers have. For it may well be that the beliefs\nare part of the cause of the experience rather than the other way round\n(Katz 1978).\n",
