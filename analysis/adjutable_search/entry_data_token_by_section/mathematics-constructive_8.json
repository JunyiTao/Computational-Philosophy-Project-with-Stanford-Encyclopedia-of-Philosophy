To do so, we need to distinguish between certain\ntypes of bar for the complete binary fan \\(2^*\\) (the set of\nall finite sequences in \\(\\{0,1\\})\\). \n\nLet \\(\\alpha \\equiv (\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2, \\ldots)\\) be a finite or\ninfinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \\(\\alpha\\)\nwith another string \\(\\beta\\) is \n\\[\n\\alpha^{\\frown}\\beta \\equiv \n(\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2 ,\\ldots ,\\alpha_n ,\\beta_1 ,\\ldots ,\\beta_m).\n\\]\n\n\nFor \\(b\\) in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) we write \\(\\alpha^{\\frown}b\\) rather than\n\\(\\alpha^{\\frown}(b)\\). By a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\)\nwe mean a subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that \n\\[\\tag{1}\nB = \\{u \\in 2^* : \\forall v\\in 2^* (u^{\\frown}v \\in D)\\}\n\\]\n\n\nfor some detachable subset \\(D\\) of \\(2^*\\). Every detachable subset\nof \\(2^*\\) is a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset. On the other hand, by a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset\n\\(S\\) of \\(2^* \\times \\bN\\) such that \n\\[\n\\forall u\\in 2^*\\,\\forall n\\in \\bN\\,\n ((u,n) \\in S \\Rightarrow (u^{\\frown}0,n) \\in S \\wedge \n  (u^{\\frown}1,n) \\in S)\n\\]\n\n\nand  \n\\[\nB = \\{u \\in 2^* :\\forall n\\in \\bN((u,n) \\in S)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nEvery \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) is a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset: simply take \\(S = D \\times \\bN\\), where \\(D\\) is\na detachable subset of \\(2^*\\) such that (1) holds. \n\nIf \\(?\\) denotes a property of subsets of \\(2^*\\), then\nBrouwer\u2019s fan theorem for \\(?\\)-bars tells us\nthat every bar with the property \\(?\\) is a uniform bar. We are\nparticularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars\n(already discussed in Section 3.1):\n\nFT\\(_D\\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n\n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subsets):\n\nFT\\(_{\\mathsf{c}}\\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is\nuniform; \n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subsets):\n\nFT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1}\\): Every \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bar of the complete binary fan\nis uniform; \n\nand the full fan theorem: \n\nFT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform. \n\nNote that, relative to BISH, \n\nFT \\(\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c \\Rightarrow\\)\nFT\\(_D\\). \n\nLubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are\nstrict. \n\nTypically, we want to prove that FT\\(_?\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to\nthe proposition that, for every set \\(S\\) of an appropriate sort, some\npointwise property of the form \n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\forall x \\in S \\exists t \\in T P(s,t)\n\\]\n\n\nactually holds uniformly in the form \n\\[\\tag{3}\n\\exists t \\in T \\forall s \\in S P(s,t).\n\\]\n\n\nOur strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a\nset \\(S\\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \\(N\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that \n\nif (2) holds, then \\(B\\) is a bar, and\nif \\(B\\) is a uniform bar, then (3) holds.\n\n\nThis, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the\nimplication from (3) to (2) implies FT\\(_?\\), we consider a ?-subset\n\\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) and construct a corresponding set \\(S\\) such that\n\n\nif \\(B\\) is a bar, then (2) holds, and\nif (3) holds, then \\(B\\) is a uniform bar.\n\n\nThe canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman\n[1984], in which \\(S\\) is the set of values of a given uniformly\ncontinuous mapping \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR, T\\) is the set of\npositive real numbers, and \n\\[\nP(s,t) \\equiv (s \\ge t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe pointwise property we consider is \n\\[\n\\forall x \\in [0,1] \\exists t \\gt 0 (f(x) \\ge t),\n\\]\n\n\nits uniform version being \n\\[\n\\exists t \\gt 0 \\forall x \\in [0,1] (f(x) \\ge t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe Julian-Richman results are as follows. \n\n\nTheorem 1: Let \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) be\nuniformly continuous. Then there exists a detachable subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that\n\nif \\(f(x) \\gt 0\\) for each \\(x \\in [0,1]\\), then \\(B\\) is a bar,\nand \nif \\(B\\) is a uniform bar, then \\(\\inf f \\gt 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2: Let \\(B\\) be a detachable subset of\n\\(2^*\\). Then there exists a uniformly continuous \\(f : [0,1]\n\\rightarrow \\bR\\) such that\n\nif \\(B\\) is a bar, then \\(f(x) \\gt 0\\) for each \\(x \\in [0,1]\\),\nand\nif inf \\(f \\gt 0\\), then \\(B\\) is a uniform bar.\n\n\n\nThe proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian\n& Richman [1984].\n\nThe two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to\nBISH, the fan theorem FT\\(_D\\) is equivalent to the positivity\nprinciple, POS: \n\nEach positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) has a\npositive infimum. \n\nIt follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan\ntheorem, not just FT\\(_D\\), is a standard principle. The situation is\nquiet the opposite in RUSS, where there exist both a detachable bar of\n\\(2^*\\) that is not uniform and a positive-valued, uniformly\ncontinuous function on \\([0,1]\\) that has infimum equal to 0; see\nChapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman [1987]. \n\nBerger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to\nestablishing the equivalence of POS and FT\\(_c\\). They establish a\nchain of equivalences between POS, FT\\(_c\\), and four principles of\nthe type \u201cif there is at most one object with property \\(P\\),\nthen there is one such object\u201d. The four unique-existence\nprinciples are:\n\n\nCIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited\nclosed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one\ncommon point has inhabited intersection (Cantor\u2019s intersection\ntheorem with uniqueness.) Note that a subset \\(S\\) of a metric space\n\\((X,\\rho)\\) is located if for each \\(x\\) in \\(X\\) the\ninfimum distance from \\(x\\) to \\(S\\) exists. \n\nMIN!:   Each uniformly continuous, real-valued\nfunction on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has\na minimum point.\n\nWKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one\ninfinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak K\u00f6nig lemma with\nuniqueness).\n\nFIX!:  Each uniformly continuous function from\na compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and\nwith approximate fixed points has a fixed point.\n\n\nIn, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \\(f\\) of a\nmetric space \\((X,\\varrho)\\) into itself\n\nhas at most one fixed point if \\(\\varrho(f(x),x) +\n\\varrho(f(y),y) \\gt 0\\) whenever \\(\\varrho(x,y) \\gt 0\\); \nhas approximate fixed points if for each \\(\\varepsilon\n\\gt 0\\) there exists \\(x \\in X\\) such that \\(\\varrho(f(x),x) \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\). \n\n\nA major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan\ntheorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity\ntheorem for \\([0,1]\\),\n\nUCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of\n\\([0,1]\\) into \\(\\bR\\) is uniformly continuous, \n\nthe proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of\nthe fan theorem. (Note that UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\) is equivalent, relative to\nBISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces:\nEvery pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally bounded\nmetric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for\nexample, Loeb [2005].)\n\nIt follows from results of Berger [2006] that \n\nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c\\). \n\nAlso, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that\n\nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\). \n\nHowever, we do not know if either of these implications can be\nreplaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\), and hence the\nfull uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is\nequivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet\nunidentified, version of the fan theorem. \n\nFor additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse\nmathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener\n[2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky\n[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram\nillustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,\nand omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources). \n\nInterested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse\nmathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary\ndocument:\n\nIshihara\u2019s principle \\(\\BDN\\) and the anti-Specker Property\n\n6. Constructive Algebra and Topology\n\nConstructive mathematicians initially concentrated their efforts on\nthe field of analysis, with considerable success\u2014witness the\nwealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does\nnot mean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the\nconstructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines et\nal [1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart\nto the constructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more\nrecently, Lombardi and Quitt\u00e9 [2011] have published the first\nlarge volume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra.\nHowever, not being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of\nmaking this article too long to hold the reader\u2019s attention, we\nchoose not to discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail;\nrather, in the following supplementary document, we turn to\nconstructive topology, describing some rather different approaches to\nthat subject:\n\nApproaches to Constructive Topology\n\n7. Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance\n\nInvestigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a\nseries of papers on preference, utility, and demand from 1982 onwards;\nsee Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral thesis, Hendtlass [2013]\nsubstantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand\nfunction; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed-point theory\nand its applications, in particular to constructivisations of two\nclassical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium.\n\nIn 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive\nmathematical finance, at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in\nMunich.They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset\npricing, the separating hyperplane theorem, and Markov\u2019s\nPrinciple are constructively equivalent (Berger & Svindland\n[2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent\nthe nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order\nto prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence\nof even relatively weak convexity properties (Berger & Svindland\n[2016a]). Their project suggests that mathematical finance, like\nmathematical economics, may be a rich source of elegant, practical\nconstructive theorems.\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the\nconstructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical\nlogic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real\nnumber equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the\nmathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries\nsuch as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the\nroute taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic\nlogic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible\ndecisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or\ntype-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within\nconstructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the\nnatural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.\n[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges &\nV\u00ee\u021b\u0103 [2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal\nmathematician, the only constraints being those imposed by\nintuitionistic logic. As Bishop and others have shown, the traditional\nbelief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today, that\nintuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the\ndevelopment of serious mathematics impossible, is patently false:\nlarge parts of deep modern mathematics can be, and have been, produced\nby purely constructive methods. Moreover, the link between\nconstructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the\nfuture implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the\ncomputer.\n\nFor further information about the state of modern constructive\nmathematics, we recommend the forthcoming Handbook of Constructive\nMathematics [Bridges et al., eds, 2023].",
