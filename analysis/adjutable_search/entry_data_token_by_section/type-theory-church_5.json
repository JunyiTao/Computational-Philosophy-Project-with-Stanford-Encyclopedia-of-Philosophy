    "main_text": "Metatheory || Lambda-Conversion\n3.1 Lambda-Conversion\n\nThe first three rules of inference in\n Section 1.3.1\n are called rules of \u03bb-conversion. If \\(\\bD\\) and\n\\(\\bE\\) are wffs, we write \\(\\bD \\conv \\bE\\) to indicate that \\(\\bD\\)\ncan be converted to \\(\\bE\\) by applications of these rules. This is an\nequivalence relation between wffs. A wff \\(\\bD\\) is in\n\u03b2-normal form iff it has no well-formed parts of the\nform \\([[\\lambda \\bx_{\\alpha}\\bB_{\\beta}]\\bA_{\\alpha}]\\). Every wff is\nconvertible to one in \u03b2-normal form. Indeed, every sequence of\ncontractions (applications of rule 2, combined as necessary with\nalphabetic changes of bound variables) of a wff is finite; obviously,\nif such a sequence cannot be extended, it terminates with a wff in\n\u03b2-normal form. (This is called the strong normalization theorem.)\nBy the Church-Rosser Theorem, this wff in \u03b2-normal form is unique\nmodulo alphabetic changes of bound variables. For each wff \\(\\bA\\) we\ndenote by \\({\\downarrow}\\bA\\) the first wff (in some enumeration) in\n\u03b2-normal form such that \\(\\bA \\conv {\\downarrow} \\bA\\). Then \\(\\bD\n\\conv \\bE\\) if and only if \\({\\downarrow} \\bD = {\\downarrow} \\bE\\).\n\nBy using the Axiom of Extensionality one can obtain the following\nderived rule of inference:\n\n\n\\(\\eta\\)-Contraction. Replace a well-formed part \\([\\lambda\n\\by_{\\beta}[\\bB_{\\alpha \\beta}\\by_{\\beta}]]\\) of a wff by\n\\(\\bB_{\\alpha \\beta}\\), provided \\(\\by_{\\beta}\\) does not occur free\nin \\(\\bB_{\\alpha \\beta}\\).\n\n\nThis rule and its inverse (which is called\n\\(\\eta\\)-Expansion) are sometimes used as additional rules of\n\u03bb-conversion. See Church 1941, Stenlund 1972, Barendregt 1984,\nand Barendregt et al. 2013 for more information about\n\u03bb-conversion.\n\nIt is worth mentioning (again) that \u03bb-abstraction replaces the\nneed for comprehension axioms in Church\u2019s type theory.\n",
