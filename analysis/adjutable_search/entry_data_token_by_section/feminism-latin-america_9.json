    "main_text": "Latin American Feminist Philosophy\n3. Latin American Feminist Philosophy\n\nLatin American feminist philosophy emerges at the nexus between theory\nand practice. The social activism of the 20th century\nfueled the production of theories that form the tradition of Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy as well as its place in the academy.\nHowever, the study of Latin American feminist philosophy remains\nscarce and derelict (Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). The\nsocial sciences have been the primary driver of institutional\nadvancement for feminist theory and to date philosophy trails in its\ntaking up of feminist issues as philosophical (Schutte 2003,\n208).  The existence of Latin American feminist philosophers\nhas been largely denied, and the specificities of their theoretical\ncontributions have been erased under the sexist, Eurocentric\norientation of philosophy. Recognition of their existence is a\npolitical act that contests the dominant architecture of the history\nof philosophy. Taking account of Latin American feminist philosophy\nrequires a historical and philosophical reconstruction that\nunderstands the fact that women from Latin America and the Caribbean\nhave long been thinkers. The philosophical work that remains to be\ndone requires engagement with their ideas.\n\nLatin American feminist philosophy is political (Gut\u00ederrez\nCasta\u00f1eda 1994: 186). The ideas that pushed social\ntransformation in the 20th century movements are grounded\nin politics that recognized the imperative for social change. The\npolitical dimension of Latin American feminist philosophy is reflected\nin the fact that many Latin American feminist philosophers were or are\nactivists, and the span of their thought often reflects their\nparticipation in resistance movements. Resistance can mean many types\nof political projects, and in the context of Latin American feminist\nphilosophy, the act of citing is understood as political because it\nworks toward building a philosophical canon that legitimizes the\nvoices of women long excluded from philosophical practice. In\nthis manner, feminism upholds a broad conception of politics that\ndisturbs the spaces in which it operates blurring the boundaries\nbetween the public and private (Gut\u00ederrez Casta\u00f1eda\n1994: 187)\n\nTracing a philosophical history of Latin American feminist thinkers is\na task that merits scholarly attention, and to date there is a lacuna\nof resources. One major obstacle is linguistic as a lot of textual\nsources have not been translated. Furthermore, the resources\nthemselves are not ample, although some notable publications have been\nmade. The Antolog\u00eda del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 1 del anhelo a la emancipaci\u00f3n\n(2010a) and Antolog\u00eda del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 2 movimiento de liberaci\u00f3n de las\nmujeres (2010b) coordinated by Francesca Gargallo are some of the\nfirst large-scale publications to anthologize Latin American and\nCarribean feminist philosophical writings. They are non-exhaustive\nresources that testify to the theoretical, argumentative, and\nmethodological contributions of Latin American and Caribbean feminist\nwriters spanning from the 15th to the 20th\ncentury. As the anthology rescues writers often lost to the pages of\nhistory, it also takes Latin America and the Caribbean, as\nnuestra or our America, as the point of theoretical\ndeparture. Thus, it enables a collective recognition of a history of\nfeminist thought that does not depend on North America or Europe for\nits identity. The anthology further demonstrates that Latin American\nfeminist philosophical thought is hardly new. It is grounded in a\nhistory of resistance to social and political conditions that impeded\nthe recognition of women as knowledge-producers (Gargallo 2009: 418).\nIt has been argued that early feminist philosophies are some of the\nfirst systems of thought to account for the politics of legitimacy\nwhereby social conditions grant privilege to the epistemic productions\nof one group in order to exclude and delegitimize the voices of others\n(Gargallo 2009: 420). The critique of legitimacy is one that follows\nLatin American feminist philosophy well into the 20th and\n21st centuries.\n\nFor instance, Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695), one of\nthe most cited writers of this tradition, advocated for the\nintellectual life of women, which entailed denouncing norms of\nhegemonic masculinity. Her image as a protofeminist writer has been\nassociated with lesbianism, as she led a monastic life and in so\ndoing, resisted the dominance of masculinity (Gargallo 2009: 419). Her\nexistence as an intellectual defied the authority of her times and her\nresistance is reflected in her writing.\n\nA further example can be found in the thought of Luisa Capetillo\n(1879\u20131922), which is rooted in her participation in labor\nmovements in Puerto Rico and the United States during her lifetime. As\na cigar factory reader, she was employed by the workers and functioned\nas an intellectual and cultural intermediary by reading workers\neverything from news to political theory. Capetillo became a reader at\na time when forty percent of the tobacco workers and eighty-seven\npercent of the agricultural work force of Puerto Rico were illiterate\n(Ramos 1992: 14). However, the presence of readers, like Capetillo,\nmade the tobacco labor force one of the most socially conscious (Ramos\n1992: 21). Her activism drew intellectual support from European\nanarchist philosophy that traveled to Puerto Rico through translations\nof authors like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Diderot, Bakunin, Kropotkin,\nMarx, and Nietzsche (Ramos 1992: 27). Capetillo made a mark on the\nPuerto Rican labor movement, but she became a transnational migrant as\nshe was driven out of Puerto Rico by a government crackdown on\nanarchists (Ruiz 2016: 3). In her short life of forty-two years she\nwould come to reside in New York City, Ybor City, and La Habana as she\ncontinued her activism by organizing labor strikes, arguing against\nthe institution of marriage, engaging in stylized resistance by\nwearing men\u2019s clothing, and publishing four books (Ramos 1992:\n66). Capetillo\u2019s most important contribution was producing ideas\nrooted in a workers\u2019 rights movement that moved across nations\nand was itself inspired by the travel of ideas.\n\nPhilosophy as a field of study in Latin America and the Caribbean was\ninstitutionalized and professionalized in the years spanning\n1940\u20131960. Hence, it is no surprise that subsequently women\ngained formal university education in philosophy. Matilde Carranza\n(1892\u20131981), born in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, was Costa\nRica\u2019s first woman to receive a Ph.D. in philosophy. She\nattended the University of Wisconsin and is also noted as one of the\nfirst women to receive a doctoral degree from the university. Her\nphilosophical thought centered on the importance of education for\nsocial transformation, which aligned with her anti-despotic and\negalitarian politics. However, her most notable impact was shattering\nthe myth that women were not apt for philosophy, thus paving the way\nfor women of other generations (Prada Ortiz 2013: 32\u201333). Ana\nIsabel Alfaro (1944\u20131990), born in Alajuela, Costa Rica, studied\nphilosophy at the University of Costa Rica. Her philosophical\ncommitments centered on the role of education in national development,\nas she took education to be socially transformative. As a result,\nAlfaro saw the role of the university as an integral part of social\nchange. Her commitments to the transformative powers of education were\nmethodologically rooted in interdisciplinarity and cultural diversity.\nNotably, Alfaro placed importance on the creative power of women\nwithin her philosophy of education, arguing for their creative\npotential and reflecting this commitment in her political alliances\nwith poor women (Prada Ortiz 2013: 55).\n\nFollowing suit, Monelisa Lina P\u00e9rez Marchand, Victoria Junco\nPosadas, Olga Victoria Quiroz Mart\u00ednez, Rosa Krauze, Elsa\nCecilia Frost, Vera Yamuni, and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Rovira Gaspar\nentered academic philosophy in Mexico in the middle of the\n20th century through the seminars of Jos\u00e9 Gaos\n(Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). Notable among these is Vera\nYamuni (1917\u20132003) and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Rovira, who\nrecognized the importance of doing philosophy from a Latin American\nperspective with a keen eye toward the specificities of women. Rovira\nwould apply this methodology to historicism and Yamuni to humanism\n(Gargallo 2009: 423). Yamuni is particularly important as her work and\nplace in the academy influenced many generations of feminist\nphilosophers. She was a transnational thinker born of Lebanese parents\nin Costa Rica, although she did most of her studying, teaching, and\nwriting in Mexico. Yamuni studied under Gaos and would dedicate a part\nof her intellectual career to engaging with the work of Gaos, notably\ncritiquing his misogyny. She further dedicated time to translate texts\nfrom English and Arabic to Spanish, reflecting her commitment to\ncreating conditions of philosophical access (Prada Ortiz 2013: 71).\nHowever, she is notably remembered as a feminist thinker through her\nwork on Sappho, Virginia Woolf, and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as her\nfeminist analysis of the role of women in the history of philosophy.\nHer writing conceptually explored sameness and difference long before\nit became a hotbed of feminist philosophical analysis in the 1990s\n(Prada Ortiz 2013: 87). Her influence as a feminist philosopher is\nprofound as she has been cited as the first to introduce feminist\nphilosophy into Mexico by her student Graciela Hierro, who became an\niconic figure of Latin American feminist philosophy in the 1980s and\n1990s (Prada Ortiz 2013: 83).\n\nThe social transformation of the 1970s and 1980s reverberated into the\nfield of philosophy. As women increasingly began to establish\nthemselves in the academy, their ideas developed. On the shoulders of\nsymbolic mothers and the politics of the times, Latin American\nfeminist philosophy began to proliferate as a diverse system of\nthought that took feminist theorizing to be a form of politics.\nHowever, the points of departure for analysis varied. Graciela Hierro,\nstudent of Yamuni, developed a feminist ethics informed by\nutilitarianism that explored the intimate relationship between ethics\nand politics focused on liberation and pleasure. For Hierro,\nwomen\u2019s politics is one centered on making claims about the role\nof women in a society where the condition of womanhood is understood\nas a variant characteristic of human life (Hierro 1990). Hierro, much\nlike Yamuni and the women that came before her, functioned as a\nsymbolic philosophical mother to many as she heavily influenced a\ngeneration of feminist scholars. Eli Bartra, a student of\nHierro\u2019s, maintained that feminism is a theoretical current\ndedicated to uncovering what it means to be a woman. For her, the\nfeminist project is political because feminism is a political\nphilosophy (Bartra 2001: 12). Diana Helena Maff\u00eda of Argentina,\ninfluenced by Bartra, further maintains that feminism is both a\npolitical position and a critical theory that lends itself toward the\nrevision of political ideals (Rietti & Maff\u00eda 2005).\nMar\u00eda Luisa Femen\u00edas, also writing from Argentina,\nmaintains a link between feminism and politics but takes Latin\nAmerican feminism to be characterized by its unique appreciation of\nthe intersections among gender, class, race/ethnicity, and religion as\nthey collectively forged conditions of existence (Femen\u00edas\n2007). Urania Ungo Montenegro of Panam\u00e1 defines feminism as a\npolitical theory of women that reflects the relationship between women\nand politics (Ungo Montenegro 2000).\n\nAlthough they diverge in their characterizations of the relationship\nbetween feminism and politics, all of these positions share a general\nunderstanding that to philosophically discuss Latin American feminism\nis to engage in political theory in a way that elucidates the diverse\nand complex relationships among women, gender, and politics. This list\nis by no means exhaustive, and further figures like Rosario\nCastellanos of Mexico and Celia Amor\u00f3s of Spain should not be\nforgotten as they influenced the positions developed by these\nthinkers. Furthermore, philosophers like Ofelia Schutte, Cuban-born\nand writing in the United States, have made notable contributions to\nthe landscape of Latin American feminist philosophy, reminding readers\nthat the feminist tradition occupies a part of a wider tradition of\npolitical liberation and theory of Latin America. All of these women\ndared to be thinkers at times when being a Latin American woman in\nphilosophy was unheard of, and they have come to form the foundation\nof a canon of thinkers that paved the way for new and emerging\nvoices.\n\nThe work of Ofelia Schutte in the United States remains one of the\nmost important contributions to Latin American Feminist Philosophy as\nshe is responsible for creating academic spaces that bridged ideas\nacross the hemisphere for English speaking audiences. In 1988 she\npublished \u201cPhilosophy and Feminism in Latin America:\nPerspectives on Gender and Culture\u201d (Schutte 1988), which\nprovides a framework for understanding the sociocultural specificity\nof women\u2019s conditions in Latin America (Schutte 1988: 63).\nIn 1994 she guest edited a special issue in Hypatia on\nSpanish and Latin American Feminist Philosophy featuring essays by\nCelia Amor\u00f3s, Mar\u00eda Luisa Femen\u00edas, Graciela\nHierro, and Griselda Gut\u00ederrez Casta\u00f1eda. The special\nissue closes with a list of Women\u2019s Studies Centers and\nPrograms in Latin America and Spain by country featuring Argentina,\nCuba, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Spain (Schutte 1994: 194). In\nbringing these voices together, Schutte bookmarks the birth of\nphilosophical feminisms of Latin America by flagging new\ninterpretations of philosophy that question the links between\nknowledge, gender, and power (Schutte 1994: 143). The special\nissue mirrors the framing of Feminist Philosophy in Latin\nAmerica and Spain (2007) edited by Amy Oliver and Mar\u00eda\nLuisa Femen\u00edas. Feminist Philosophy in Latin America and\nSpain continues to be one of the most important compilations of\nLatin American feminist philosophy in English featuring a range of\ntopics including ethics, gender, history, patriarchy,\ntranslation, and sexuality. \n\nArgumentatively, Schutte lays the philosophical groundwork for a\nrobust Latin American feminist philosophical methodology over the\ncourse of her career. In \u201cPhilosophy and Feminism in Latin\nAmerica: Perspectives on Gender and Culture\u201d (1988) she begins\nto frame Latin American feminist philosophy as a field that unfolds\nfrom gender consciousness in the context of discrimination and\noppression with specific research strategies that can appropriately\nattend to the situation of Latin American women and girls (Schutte\n1988: 65). Building on these insights, the last chapter of her\nbook Cultural Identity and Social Liberation in Latin American\nThought  (1993) takes up an analysis of the relationship\nbetween cultural identity, feminist theory, and liberation by\nexploring the historical precedents of Latin American feminist theory,\nplural feminist research strategies, the specificity of Latin America\nin relationship to gender issues as well as the evaluative and\nparticipatory models that structure feminist politics of the region\n(Schutte 1993). Her insights with respect to the specificity of the\nLatin American condition and gender elucidate the complexities of\ncontext that generate the conditions of the possibilities of Latin\nAmerican feminist thought requires centering the topics of\nviolence against women, women and development, and women and domestic\nwork that point toward the patriarchal appropriation of women\u2019s\nbodies and labor for social reproduction (Schutte 1993: 215).\nUltimately, the specificity of the Latin American gender context\nproduces the orienting markers of a Latin American feminist\ntheoretical method: a critical conception of knowledge, a connection\nbetween theory and practice, progressive projects and concepts of\nfreedom and liberation, and transformative politics of culture\n(Schutte 2011). Here transformation needs to be decolonizing in\nthat it needs to overcome the privileges of Eurocentric coloniality\nand Ango-Eurocentric modernity. Transformation is a constant challenge\nthat unleashes the perspectives of women of color, LGBTIQQ subjects,\necological feminisms and perspectives suppressed by male dominant\nconsortiums of power (Schutte 2011: 800). \n\nIn this vein, dissident voices of the early 2000s waged a decolonial\ncritique that came to characterize contemporary Latin American\nfeminist philosophical scholarship. Influenced by the pivotal\ncontributions of Mar\u00eda Lugones (2007, 2008), contemporary\ndecolonial Latin American feminist scholarship has tackled\nEurocentrism, colonial underpinnings, and omissions of identity in\nfeminist philosophy. Lugones was an integral voice in the formation of\na decolonial feminist tradition as she was the first scholar to\narticulate the concept of the coloniality of gender. In conversation\nwith the scholarship of Peruvian An\u00edbal Quijano (2000), she\nmaintained that the modern sex/gender system is rooted in the colonial\nproject that imposes a dimorphic sex/gender system framed through\nheteronormativity. Complementing Quijano, she maintains that the\ncolonial/modern gender system required the categorization of human and\nnon-human and the invention of racial divisions of the human. However,\nshe critically adds that gender played an important role in these\nrelationships, a point Quijano overlooks. As a result, the status of\nwhite women, existing alongside colonizing white men, operated on a\ndifferent nexus committed to the reproduction of racialized humanity.\nThe peoples of the colonized world did not participate in the modern\ngender system prior to its imposition. The import of this argument is\nthat gender and sexuality are co-constitutive of race and are formed\nin and through the colonial project that sought to subordinate\ncolonized peoples. Hence, to theorize about gender entails a look at\nthe heirlooms of colonialism that built the possibilities of the\nmodern world through the categorization of people into racialized,\ngendered humanity. This critique problematizes any idea of shared\ngender in womanhood because it fails to account for the racial and\nclass differences that cut across the formations of identities in the\nAmericas.\n\nOne of the most notable and comprehensive texts that brings Latin\nAmerican decolonial voices together is Tejiendo de otro modo:\nfeminism, espistemolog\u00eda y apuestas descoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b), edited by Yuderkys Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso, Diana\nG\u00f3mez Correal, and Karina Ochoa Mu\u00f1oz. The book provides\na critical intervention in contemporary Latin American feminisms from\nthe diverse positions and experiences of women (Escobar 2014: 11).\nRooted in decolonial epistemic practices, the book reconceives Latin\nAmerica as Abya Yala, the Kuna (Indigenous people of\nPanam\u00e1 and Colombia) term for what colonizers termed\n\u201cAmerica\u201d. Abya Yala translates as \u201cland of\nfull maturity\u201d or \u201cland of vital blood\u201d and is taken\nas a methodological starting point for theorizing ways of knowing\nthrough a decolonial lens. The contributors adhere to the claim that\ndecolonization cannot occur without de-patriarchialization. In other\nwords, resistance to capitalism, racism, homophobia, and all forms of\ndomination related to our modern social order has to incorporate\nstrategies of de-patriarchialization (Escobar 2014: 11). As such, the\ntext brings to the fore the importance of intersecting Latin American\nfeminisms with decolonial thought and exemplifies new emerging\ncritical voices that contribute to growth and proliferation.\n\nThe scholarship notably produces a Latin American feminist genealogy\ncommitted to prioritizing the voices of those systematically\nmarginalized or ignored and decenters dominant white,\nupper/middle-class feminisms that have failed to account for\ndifference (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a: 14). The scholarship\nis a further testament to the fact that no one dominant category will\nsolve the problem of unification (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a:\n20). The project of decolonial feminisms is not framed by privileging\none category of analysis over another (e.g., race over gender);\nrather, it proposes a systemic critique focused on the conceptual\nframework of dominant Latin American feminisms, calling attention to\nthe ways it has reified classism, sexism, racism, and\nheteronormativity. The project of decolonial feminisms is a movement\nin process, but its core seeks to bring together the productions of\nthinkers, intellectuals, feminist activists, lesbian feminists,\nAfro-descended women, Indigenous peoples, poor mestizas, and\nallies committed to the historical recuperation of anti-racist theory\nand practice from the epistemic position of Abya Yala\n(Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a: 32).\n\nTwo notable examples of decolonial feminist theory can be found in the\nwork of Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui and Rita Segato. Silvia Rivera\nCusicanqui is a Bolivian feminist sociologist and historian. She is\nknown for her critical historical analysis of the sociology of the\nimage, which holds that images have the power to construct critical\nnarratives that can un-frame different forms of contemporary\ncolonialism (Rivera Cusicanqui 2010). Images, more than words than\nthemselves, engender the hierarchy of the textual over the visual that\ncome to give identity markers meaning. However, words hide meaning and\nimages can reveal buried layers of meaning that may not be spoken.\nAlongside the preponderance of text and the presupposed colonial\nuniversality it carries exist other worlds of meaning marked by\nthe term ch\u2019ixi, which Rivera Cusicanqui describes as\nthat which is mottled in that it obeys the Aymara idea that things can\nbe and not be at the same time. The power of the undifferentiated is\nthat it is conjugated in opposites (Rivera Cusicanqui 2010: 70).\nIn a similar transformative critical move, Argentinian-Brazilian\nanthropologist Rita Segato, develops her lines of research at the\ncross-roads between a critique of coloniality and a responsive\nanthropology (Segato 2022: 1). The anthropological project, she\nargues, needs to be open to being interpellated through difference\nwithin the \u201cwe\u201d of the moral community that allows the\nother to judge us and tell us who we are and what is expected of us\n(Segato 2022: 3). The decolonial responsive anthropology she\ndevelops opens the door for questions on the nature of patriarchy, the\nrole of the state, and the intimate yet unspoken ways in which race\nand class are co-constituted, which are all explored in La\ncr\u00edtica de la colonialidad en ocho ensayos (2013) recently\ntranslated to English in 2022. \n\nThe Latin American decolonial feminist tradition has found influential\nallies in the Latina/x feminist tradition of the United States.\nLatina/x feminisms took shape during the 1960s and 1970s as part of a\nwide range of political struggles seeking gender and social justice\nthat comes to form a wide landscape of theories. The term\n\u201cLatina/x\u201d is broad, but far from monolithic as it can\ncapture a range of identities (e.g., Afro-Latina, Afro-Caribbean,\nNuyorican, Xicana). It symbolically encapsulates identity conditions\nof migration, immigration, and diaspora to the United States from\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although Latina/x\nfeminisms are a wide-ranging field, they generally adhere to a system\nof thought that attempts to unravel interlocking systems of\noppression, reflecting on the conditions of borderlands,\nrace/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, immigration, and religion in unique\nways. Most importantly, Latina/x feminist theory pays close attention\nto lived experience and made notable contributions to theories of\nidentity that extend beyond the borders of the United States. Here,\nfigures like Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Emma\nP\u00e9rez, Juanita Ramos, Norma Alarc\u00f3n, Chela Sandoval,\nMariana Ortega, Ofelia Schutte, and Mar\u00eda Lugones have been of\nsignificance. Notably, the work of Anzald\u00faa influenced\nLugones\u2019 conceptualization of the coloniality of gender, which\nis at the centerfold of decolonial feminist theory in both Latin\nAmerica and the United States. Although theories are always tied to\ntheir locations, they also travel in ways that require attending to\nthe processes of re-signification undergone through their traffic. It\nis for this reason that some decolonial feminist thinkers have called\nfor closer attention to the specificities of alterity that might set\nlimits on the theoretical application of ideas (Mendoza 2014: 101).\nMost recently, the collection of essays Theories of the\nFlesh (2020) explores the specificities of living alterity\nin the flesh in ways that bridge Latinx and Latin American feminist\norientations around decolonial critique, epistemologies of resistance,\nand coalitional politics. Hence, the Latina/x feminist\ntradition has been influential on its own merits and continues to pave\ncoalitional roads with Latin American and Caribbean thinkers both\nwithin and outside the United States.\n",
