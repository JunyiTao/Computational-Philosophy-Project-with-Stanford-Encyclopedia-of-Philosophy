    "main_text": "The Medical Model and its Implications || The Minimal Interpretation\n2.1 The Minimal Interpretation\n\n\nMinimalists employ a concept of disease as the observable, regular\nunfolding of a suite of symptoms. Kraepelin applied it to psychiatry as\nthe basis for differential diagnosis, for example between dementia\npraecox (schizophrenia) and other forms of insanity (1899, 173\u2013175). It\nis a familiar idea that the DSM\u2019s syndrome based conception of\nmental illnesses stands in the tradition of Kraepelin, who argued that\n\u201conly the overall picture of a medical case from the\nbeginning to the end of its development can provide justification\nfor its being linked with other observations of the same kind\u201d\n(1899, 3). This familiar neo-Krapelinian picture is that mental\nillnesses are regularly co-occurring clusters of signs and symptoms\nthat doubtless depend on physical processes but are not defined or\nclassified in terms of those physical processes.\n\n\nGuze (1992), for example, is a minimalist. In saying that\npsychiatry as a part of medicine he means that we can classify\ndisorders in terms of their characteristic symptoms and courses. McHugh\nand Slavney (1998) seem to agree. They say that a disease \u201cis a\nconstruct that conceptualizes a constellation of signs and symptoms as\ndue to an underlying biological pathology, mechanism and cause\n(302).\u201d To diagnose a patient as suffering from a mental\ndisorder, for McHugh and Slavney (48), is to label them in a way that\nwe judge helpful as a starting point for investigating physical\nprocesses.\n\n\nMcHugh and Slavney deny that a disease is a physical\nprocess\u2014\u201cits essence is conceptual and inferential\u201d\n(48). This way of thinking about diseases prescinds from\ntheorizing about underlying causes of a disease entity in favor of a\nconcentration on observable phenomena, not hidden causes. However, it\nis diseases understood as destructive processes that make up the taxa\nof medicine. Similarly, the successive editions of the DSM have sought\nto classify mental illnesses based on course and symptoms but not\nspecific causes.\n\n\n Many scholars have argued (e.g. Bynum 1994, Carter 2003,\nWhitbeck 1977) that in the nineteenth century medicine changed in many\nways, including a shift in thinking about disease. Instead of seeing\ndisease as the identification of symptoms, it was the linkage of\nsymptoms to distinct pathologies, understood as departures from normal\nfunction, that came to define disease. Heinrichs (2001, 271), for\nexample, insists that psychiatry needs to employ this basic medical\noutlook, and therefore needs a developed theory of how the mind/brain\nworks that can be used to identify psychological abnormalities and\nexplain how they arise. Andreasen (2001, 172\u201376) embraces the strong\ninterpretation. She argues that psychiatry, now emerging as a form of\ncognitive neuroscience, is for the first time able to identify the\nspecific pathophysiologies that underpin the symptoms of mental\nillness. This development fits the pattern suggested by Hempel (1965),\nwho expected psychiatry, as it matured, to develop a theory-driven\nclassification scheme based on an understanding of the objective nature\nof mental illness rather than just pragmatic factors (Hempel 1965; See\nFulford et. al 2006: 324\u2013341: Thornton 2008: 169\u201374).\n",
