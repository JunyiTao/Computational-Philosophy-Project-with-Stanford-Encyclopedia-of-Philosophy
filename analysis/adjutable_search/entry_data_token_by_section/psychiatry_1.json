A\nminimal interpretation makes no commitments about the underlying\nphysical structure that causes mental illness. The strong\ninterpretation of the medical model, in contrast, dissents on just this\nissue. It says that the proper medical understanding of disease is in\nterms of morbid anatomy. It is committed to specific causal hypotheses\nin terms of abnormalities in underlying neurobiological systems.\nMinimalists treat diagnostic labels as useful heuristics rather than\nnatural kind terms, whereas a strong interpretation commits psychiatry\nto a view of mental illness as a medical disease in the strongest\nsense, that of a pathogenic process unfolding in bodily systems.\n",
