    "main_text": "Absolute Identity\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nThe following constitute a \u201cstart-up\u201d set of objections\nand replies concerning relative identity and/or aspects of the\nforegoing account of relative identity and its rival. Time and space\nconstraints prevent a more extended initial discussion. In addition,\nthere is no presumption that the objections discussed below are the\nmost important or that the initial replies to them are without fault.\nIt is hoped that the present discussion will evolve into a more\nfull-blown one, involving contributions by the author and readers\nalike. Should the discussion become lengthy, old or unchallenged\nobjections and/or replies can be placed in the archives.\n\nObjection 1: \u201cRelativist theories of identity,\nall of which are inconsistent with Leibniz\u2019s principle [LL],\ncurrently enjoy little support. The doubts about them are (a) whether\nthey really are theories of numerical identity, (b) whether they can\nbe made internally consistent, and (c) whether they are sufficiently\nmotivated\u201d (Burke 1994, p. 133).\n\nReply: In reverse order: (c) The issues discussed in\n\u00a72 and \u00a74 surely provide sufficient motivation. (b) No proof\nof inconsistency has ever been forthcoming from opponents of relative\nidentity, and in fact the weak view is consistent inasmuch as it has a\nmodel in the theory of similarity relations. The arguments outlined in\nthe second paragraph of \u00a73 are frequently cited as showing that\nrelative identity is incoherent; but they show only that RI is\nincompatible with (unrestricted) LL. (a) See the replies to objections\n2 and 3 below.\n\nObjection 2: If an identity relation obeys only a\nrestricted form of LL\u2014if it preserves only some\nproperties and not all\u2014then how do we tell\nwhich properties serve to individuate a pair of distinct objects?\n\nReply: Similarity relations satisfy only restricted\nforms of LL. How then do we tell which properties are\npreserved by the same shape relation and which are not? It is\nno objection to the thesis that identity relations in general preserve\nsome properties and not others to demand to know which are which. At\nbest the objection points to a problem we must face anyway (for the\ncase of similarity). In general, a property is preserved by an\nequivalence relation if it \u201cspreads\u201d in an equivalence\nclass determined by the relation: If one member of the class has the\nproperty, then every member does. Every property spreads in a\nsingleton, as absolute identity demands.\n\nObjection 3: If identity statements are mere\nequivalencies, what distinguishes identity from mere similarity?\n\nReply: The distinction between identity and\nsimilarity statements (or sentences) is usually drawn in\nterms of the distinction between substantival and adjectival common\nnouns. If \\(F\\) is a common noun standing for a kind of\nthings, e.g., \u201chorse\u201d, then \u201c\\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d is a statement of identity, whereas if\n\\(F\\) is an a common noun standing for a kind of properties\nof things, then \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d is a\nstatement of similarity. (It\u2019s interesting to note that when the\nnoun is proper, i.e., a proper name, the result is a statement of\nsimilarity, not identity\u2014as in \u201cHe\u201ds not the same\nBill we knew before\u2019.) This distinction rests ultimately on the\nmetaphysical distinction between substance and attribute, object and\nproperty. While the distinction no doubt presupposes the concept of\nindividuation (the bundle theory, for example, presupposes that we\nhave the means to individuate properties), there is no obvious reason\nto suppose that it entails the denial of RI, i.e., the claim that no\ninstance of RI is true. For a beginner\u2019s review\u2014from an\nhistorical perspective\u2014of the issues concerning substance and\nattribute, see O\u2019Connor (1967); and for more recent and advanced\ndiscussion and bibliography, see the entry on\n properties.\n\nObjection 4: Consider the following alleged instance\nof RI:\n\n(1)\n\\(A\\) is the same word type as \\(B\\), but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent word tokens.\n\n\n\u201cIf \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 refer to the\nsame objects throughout (1), the first conjunct of (1) is not an\nidentity statement, and the counterexample (to the thesis that no\ninstance of RI is true) fails. If both conjuncts are identity\nstatements in the required sense, \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 must refer to word types in the first conjunct and\nword tokens in the second, and the counterexample fails\u201d (Perry\n1970, p. 189).\n\nReply: First, if \u201cin the required sense\u201d\nmeans \u201csatisfies LL\u201d, then the objection buys correctness\nonly at the price of begging the question. Advocates of relative\nidentity will maintain that the relation A is the same word type\nas \\(B\\) is an identity relation, defined on tokens, that does\nnot satisfy LL.\n\nSecondly, even if one insists that in this case intuition dictates\nthat if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to tokens in both conjuncts of (1), then\n\u201c\\(A\\) is the same word type as \\(B\\)\u201d expresses only the\nsimilarity relation: A and B are tokens of the same type,\nthere are other cases where, intuitively, both conjuncts of RI involve\nidentity relations and yet the relevant terms all refer to the same\nkind of things; for example,\n\n(2)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same dog but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are different\nphysical objects,\n\n\nas said of young Oscar and old Oscar. Here there is no temptation to\nsuppose that the relation A and B are the same dog is\nnot an identity relation. One may invoke a theory\u2014a\ntheory of temporal parts, for example\u2014that construes the\nrelation as a certain kind of similarity, but that is theory, not\npretheoretical intuition. It is no objection to the relativist\u2019s\ntheory, which holds in part that \u201c\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nthe same dog\u201d expresses a relation of primitive identity, that\nthere is an alternative theory according to which it expresses a\nsimilarity relation obtaining between two temporal parts of the same\nobject. Furthermore, in the case of (2), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer, again\nintuitively, to the same things in both conjuncts.\n\nThird, there are cases in which the relative identity view does\npossess an ontological advantage. Consider\n\n(3)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same piece of clay but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent statues.\n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are understood to refer to one sort of\nthing\u2014pieces of clay\u2014in the first conjunct and\nanother\u2014statues\u2014in the second conjunct. Assume that the\npiece of clay \\(c\\) denoted by \\(A\\) in the first conjunct\nconstitutes, at time \\(t\\), the statue \\(s.\\) Then assuming that\nstatues are physical objects, there are two distinct physical objects\nbelonging to different kinds occupying the same space at \\(t\\). Some,\nnotably Wiggins (1980), hold that this is entirely possible: Distinct\nphysical objects may occupy the same space at the same time, provided\nthey belong to different kinds. The temporal parts doctrine supports\nand encourages this view. A statue may be a temporal part of a\ntemporally extended piece of clay. But one statue, it seems, cannot be\na temporal part of another. Even so, however, the duality of\nconstituter and thing constituted is unparsimonious (cf. Lewis 1993),\nand the relativist is not committed to it.\n\nAgain, consider\n\n(4)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same book but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent copies (of the book).\n\n\nOne can say that in the first conjunct, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to books\n(absolutely the same book), whereas in the second conjunct, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) refer to (absolutely distinct) copies. But the alleged duality\nof books and copies of books is unparsimonious and the relativist is\nnot committed to it. There is no reason to concede to the philosopher\nthat we do not actually purchase or read books; instead we\npurchase and read only copies of books. Any copy of a book is\njust as much the \u201cbook itself\u201d as is any other copy. Any\ncopy of a book is the same book as any other copy. Nelson\nGoodman once remarked that \u201cAny accurate copy of the text of a\npoem or novel is as much the original work as any other\u201d\n(Goodman 1968, p. 114). Goodman was not suggesting that the\ndistinction between poem and copy collapses. If it does collapse,\nhowever, we have an explanation of why any accurate copy is as much\nthe original work as any other: any such copy is the same work as any\nother.\n\nObjection 5: Geach remarks that \u201c[a]s for our\nrecognizing relative identity predicables: any equivalence relation\n\u2026 can be used to specify a criterion of relative\nidentity\u201d (Geach 1972, p. 249). But \u00a73 above contains a\ncounterexample. Some equivalence relations are defined in terms of the\nI-predicable of a theory and hence cannot serve as such. (Any pair of\nI-predicables for a fixed theory are equivalent.) In fact it seems\nthat any equivalence relation presupposes identity (cf. McGinn 2000).\nFor example, the relation x and y are the same color\npresupposes identity of colors, since it means that there are colors\n\\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) such that \\(x\\) has \\(C\\) and \\(y\\) has \\(C'\\), and\n\\(C = C'\\). Identity, therefore, is logically prior to\nequivalence.\n\nReply: This is a good objection. It does seem to\nshow, as the objector says, that identity is logically prior to\nordinary similarity relations. However, the difference between\nfirst-order and higher-order relations is relevant here.\nTraditionally, similarity relations such as x and y are the same\ncolor have been represented, in the way indicated in the\nobjection, as higher-order relations involving identities between\nhigher-order objects (properties). Yet this treatment may not be\ninevitable. In Deutsch (1997), an attempt is made to treat similarity\nrelations of the form \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d\n(where \\(F\\) is adjectival) as primitive, first-order, purely logical\nrelations (see also Williamson 1988). If successful, a first-order\ntreatment of similarity would show that the impression that identity\nis prior to equivalence is merely a misimpression\u2014due to the\nassumption that the usual higher-order account of similarity relations\nis the only option.\n\nObjection 6: If on day 3, \\(c' = s_2\\), as the text\nasserts, then by NI, the same is true on day 2. But the text also\nasserts that on day 2, \\(c = s_2\\); yet \\(c \\ne c'\\). This is\nincoherent.\n\nReply: The term \\(s_2\\) is not an absolutely rigid\ndesignator and so NI does not apply.\n\nObjection 7: The notion of relative identity is\nincoherent: \u201cIf a cat and one of its proper parts are one and\nthe same cat, what is the mass of that one cat?\u201d (Burke 1994, p.\n138).\n\nReply: Young Oscar and Old Oscar are the same dog,\nbut it makes no sense to ask: \u201cWhat is the mass of that one\ndog\u201d? Given the possibility of change, identical objects may\ndiffer in mass. On the relative identity account, that means that\ndistinct logical objects that are the same \\(F\\) may differ in\nmass\u2014and may differ with respect to a host of other properties\nas well. Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are distinct physical\nobjects, and therefore distinct logical objects. Distinct physical\nobjects may differ in mass.\n\nObjection 8: We can solve the paradox of 101\nDalmatians by appeal to a notion of \u201calmost-identity\u201d\n(Lewis 1993). We can admit, in light of the \u201cproblem of the\nmany\u201d (Unger 1980), that the 101 dog parts are dogs, but we can\nalso affirm that the 101 dogs are not many; for they are \u201calmost\none\u201d. Almost-identity is not a relation of indiscernibility,\nsince it is not transitive, and so it differs from relative identity.\nIt is a matter of negligible difference. A series of negligible\ndifferences can add up to one that is not negligible.\n\nReply: The difference between Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 is not negligible and the two are not\nalmost-identical. Lewis concedes this point but proposes to combine\nalmost-identity with supervaluations to give a mixed solution to the\nparadox. The supervaluation solution starts from the assumption that\none and only one of the dog parts is a dog (and a Dalmatian, and\nOscar), but it doesn\u2019t matter which. It doesn\u2019t matter\nwhich because we haven\u2019t decided as much, and we aren\u2019t\ngoing to. Since it is true that any such decision renders one and only\none dog part a dog, it is plain-true, i.e., supertrue, that there is\none and only one dog in the picture. But it is not clear that this\napproach enjoys any advantage over that of relative identity; in fact,\nit seems to produce instances of RI. Compare: Fred\u2019s bicycle has\na basket attached to it. Ordinarily, our discourse slides over the\ndifference between Fred\u2019s bicycle with its basket attached and\nFred\u2019s bicycle minus the basket. (In this respect, the case of\nFred\u2019s bicycle differs somewhat from that of Oscar and\nOscar\u2212. We tend not to ignore that\ndifference.) In particular, we don\u2019t say that Fred has two\nbicycles even if we allow that Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus is a\nbicycle. Both relative identity and supervaluations validate this\nintuition. However, both relative identity and supervaluations also\naffirm that Fred\u2019s bicycle and Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are\nabsolutely distinct objects. That is, the statement that Fred\u2019s\nbicycle and Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are distinct is supertrue. So\nthe supervaluation technique affirms both that Fred\u2019s bicycle\nand Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are distinct objects and that\nthere is one and only one (relevant) bicycle. That is RI, or close\nenough. The supervaluation approach is not so much an alternative to\nrelative identity as a form of it.\n\nObjection 9: One may argue that the plausibility of\nRI rests to a large degree on certain linguistic phenomena and that we\ndo not need it after all because these phenomena are in fact apparent\nand the notion of relative identity can be explained away. For\nexample, Moltmann (2013) has recently argued that some apparent\nstatements of sortal-relative identity can be analysed on linguistic\ngrounds as statements of absolute identity. Consider an example of\nsuch statements: \u201cThis is the same lump of clay but not the same\nstatue as that\u201d, which is uttered in front of, say, two\nphotographs: one presenting the clay and the other showing the statue\nmade out of the clay. Moltmann starts her analysis focussing on the\ntwo pronouns at stake: this and that, the so-called\nbare demonstratives. The analysis reveals two different functions\nthereof: referential and presentational. Due to the referential\nfunction a bare demonstrative picks up a unique feature, or a trope as\nMoltmann claims. Secondly, this feature (trope) is used to recognise\nits bearer (in any possible world that is accessible from the world\nwhere the pronoun is uttered). Now in the example above this\nrefers to a complex trope, say the complex composed of this particular\nbrownness and this roundness, and \u201cwith the help of\u201d this\ntrope maps to a lump of clay as a bearer of this trope. Similarly,\nthat refers to another complex trope, say this particular\nbrownness and this angularity and maps to a bearer of this trope. The\ncrucial assumption here is that the tropes in question may have\nmultiple bearers, e.g., the brownness and roundness is a trope borne\nboth by the clay and the statue. Moltmann\u2019s semantics of the\n(apparent) statements of sortal-relative identity of the form\n\u201cThis is the same \u2026 as that\u201d has it that such\nstatements are true if this refers to a trope such that at\nleast one, but not all, of its bearers is identical (in the sense of\nabsolute identity) to a bearer of the trope to which that\nrefers. So our sentence \u201cThis is the same lump of clay but not\nthe same statue as that\u201d is true when (i) one bearer of the\nthis trope is the same as a bearer of the that trope\nand (ii) another bearer of that first trope is not the same as a\nbearer of the other trope.\n\nReply: The semantics\noutlined by Moltmann has its ontological cost because its proponent\nneeds to acknowledge that a single trope may have multiple bearers.\nBut even if you are persuaded by her argumentation to this\ncontroversial position, you may still accept RI. Moltmann\u2019s\ntheory concerns a specific class of relative identity statements and\ndoes not directly affect the applications of RI described above, which\nneed not be rendered as identity statements involving bare\ndemonstratives. For instance, accepting this theory you are at liberty\nto say that the original and remodeled ship are the same ship but not\nthe same collection of planks, whereas the reassembled ship is the\nsame collection of planks as the original but not the same ship. So\neven if the whole body of linguistic evidence for RI can be explained\naway, we may use relative identity as a theoretical explanatory tool,\ne.g., to provide resolutions to the paradoxes described above.\n",
