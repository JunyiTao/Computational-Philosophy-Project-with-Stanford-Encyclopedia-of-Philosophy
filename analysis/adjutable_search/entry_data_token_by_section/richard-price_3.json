    "main_text": "Price\u2019s Moral Philosophy || Necessary moral principles\n2.3 Necessary moral principles\n\nIf there are necessary moral principles, it might seem that they must\nbe exceptionless. If lying is, in virtue of its nature, wrong, then\nall lying is wrong. And the same will hold for any other principles.\nBut such moral rigorism seems deeply implausible. While some (most\nnotably Kant) have bitten the bullet, most of us believe that there\nare circumstances in which it is permissible, or even required, to\nlie. Price agrees. Principles can conflict and none automatically\ntrumps the others. Which principle should govern our actions will\ndepend on the circumstances. In some cases of conflict, it is clear\nwhat morality demands. But in many cases it is not: \u201cdoubt\narises; and we may thus be rendered entirely incapable of determining\nwhat we ought to chuse\u201d (R 167). The lack of clarity here is\nepistemic, not metaphysical: \u201cTruth and right in all\ncircumstances, require one determinate way of acting\u201d (R 167).\nBut since what that way is can be unclear, there can be disagreements\nbetween right-minded people about what to do. None of this, however,\nimpugns our knowledge of the fundamental principles.\n\n\nThe principles themselves, it should be remembered, are self-evident;\nand to conclude the contrary \u2026 because of the obscurity\nattending several cases wherein a competition arises between the\nseveral principles of morality, is very unreasonable. It is not unlike\nconcluding, that, \u2026 because it may not in some instances be\neasy to determine what will be the effect of different forces,\nvariously compounded and acting contrary to each other; therefore we\ncan have no assurance what any of them acting separately will produce,\nor so much as know that there is any such thing as force. (R 168)\n\n\nPrice has, in effect, anticipated Ross\u2019s celebrated distinction\nbetween prima facie duties and duties proper, even down to\nusing the same analogy about conflicting forces to illustrate the\ndistinction.\n",
