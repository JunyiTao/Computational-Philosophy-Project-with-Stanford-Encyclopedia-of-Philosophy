    "main_text": "The Main Interpretations || Frequency Interpretations\n3.4 Frequency Interpretations\n\nGamblers, actuaries and scientists have long understood that relative\nfrequencies bear an intimate relationship to probabilities. Frequency\ninterpretations posit the most intimate relationship of all: identity.\nThus, we might identify the probability of \u2018heads\u2019 on a\ncertain coin with the number of heads in a suitable sequence of tosses\nof the coin, divided by the total number of tosses. A simple version\nof frequentism, which we will call finite frequentism,\nattaches probabilities to events or attributes in a finite reference\nclass in such a straightforward manner:\n\nthe probability of an attribute A in a finite reference class B is\nthe relative frequency of actual occurrences of A within B.\n\n\nThus, finite frequentism bears certain structural similarities to the\nclassical interpretation, insofar as it gives equal weight to each\nmember of a set of events, simply counting how many of them are\n\u2018favorable\u2019 as a proportion of the total. The crucial\ndifference, however, is that where the classical interpretation\ncounted all the possible outcomes of a given experiment,\nfinite frequentism counts actual outcomes. It is thus\ncongenial to those with empiricist scruples. It was developed by Venn\n(1876), who in his discussion of the proportion of births of males and\nfemales, concludes: \u201cprobability is nothing but that\nproportion\u201d (p. 84, his\n emphasis).[9])\n Finite frequentism is often assumed, tacitly or explicitly, in\nstatistics and in the sciences more generally.\n\nFinite frequentism gives an operational definition of probability, and\nits problems begin there. For example, just as we want to allow that\nour thermometers could be ill-calibrated, and could thus give\nmisleading measurements of temperature, so we want to allow that our\n\u2018measurements\u2019 of probabilities via frequencies could be\nmisleading, as when a fair coin lands heads 9 out of 10 times. More\nthan that, it seems to be built into the very notion of probability\nthat such misleading results can arise. Indeed, in many cases,\nmisleading results are guaranteed. Starting with a degenerate case:\naccording to the finite frequentist, a coin that is never tossed, and\nthat thus yields no actual outcomes whatsoever, lacks a probability\nfor heads altogether; yet a coin that is never measured does not\nthereby lack a diameter. Perhaps even more troubling, a coin that is\ntossed exactly once yields a relative frequency of heads of either 0\nor 1, whatever its bias. Or we can imagine a unique radiocative atom\nwhose probabilities of decaying at various times obey a continuous law\n(e.g. exponential); yet according to finite frequentism, with\nprobability 1 it decays at the exact time that it actually\ndoes, for its relative frequency of doing so is 1/1. Famous enough to\nmerit a name of its own, these are instances of the so-called\n\u2018problem of the single case\u2019. In fact, many events are\nmost naturally regarded as not merely unrepeated, but in a strong\nsense unrepeatable \u2014 the 2020 presidential election,\nthe final game of the 2019 NBA play-offs, the Civil War,\nKennedy\u2019s assassination, certain events in the very early\nhistory of the universe, and so on. Nonetheless, it seems natural to\nthink of non-extreme probabilities attaching to some, and perhaps all,\nof them. Worse still, some cosmologists regard it as a genuinely\nchancy matter whether our universe is open or closed (apparently\ncertain quantum fluctuations could, in principle, tip it one way or\nthe other), yet whatever it is, it is \u2018single-case\u2019 in the\nstrongest possible sense.\n\nThe problem of the single case is particularly striking, but we really\nhave a sequence of related problems: \u2018the problem of the double\ncase\u2019, \u2018the problem of the triple case\u2019 \u2026\nEvery coin that is tossed exactly twice can yield only the relative\nfrequencies 0, 1/2 and 1, whatever its bias\u2026 According to\nactual frequentism, it is an analytic truth that every coin that is\ntossed an odd number of times is biased. A finite reference class of\nsize \\(n\\), however large \\(n\\) is, can only produce relative\nfrequencies at a certain level of \u2018grain\u2019, namely \\(1/n\\).\nAmong other things, this rules out irrational-valued probabilities;\nyet our best physical theories say otherwise. Furthermore, there is a\nsense in which any of these problems can be transformed into the\nproblem of the single case. Suppose that we toss a coin a thousand\ntimes. We can regard this as a single trial of a\nthousand-tosses-of-the-coin experiment. Yet we do not want to be\ncommitted to saying that that experiment yields its actual\nresult with probability 1.\n\nThe problem of the single case is that the finite frequentist fails to\nsee intermediate probabilities in various places where others do.\nThere is also the converse problem: the frequentist sees intermediate\nprobabilities in various places where others do not. Our world has\nmyriad different entities, with myriad different attributes. We can\ngroup them into still more sets of objects, and then ask with which\nrelative frequencies various attributes occur in these sets. Many such\nrelative frequencies will be intermediate; the finite frequentist\nautomatically identifies them with intermediate probabilities. But it\nwould seem that whether or not they are genuine\nprobabilities, as opposed to mere tallies, depends on the\ncase at hand. Bare ratios of attributes among sets of disparate\nobjects may lack the sort of modal force that one might expect from\nprobabilities. I belong to the reference class consisting of myself,\nthe Eiffel Tower, the southernmost sandcastle on Santa Monica Beach,\nand Mt Everest. Two of these four objects are less than 7 feet tall, a\nrelative frequency of 1/2; moreover, we could easily extend this\nclass, preserving this relative frequency (or, equally easily, not).\nYet it would be odd to say that my probability of being less\nthan 7 feet tall, relative to this reference class, is 1/2, although\nit is perfectly acceptable (if uninteresting) to say that 1/2 of the\nobjects in the reference class are less than 7 feet tall.\n\nSome frequentists (notably Venn 1876, Reichenbach 1949, and von Mises\n1957 among others), partly in response to some of the problems above,\nhave gone on to consider infinite reference classes,\nidentifying probabilities with limiting relative frequencies\nof events or attributes therein. Thus, we require an infinite sequence\nof trials in order to define such probabilities. But what if the\nactual world does not provide an infinite sequence of trials of a\ngiven experiment? Indeed, that appears to be the norm, and perhaps\neven the rule. In that case, we are to identify probability with a\nhypothetical or counterfactual limiting relative\nfrequency. We are to imagine hypothetical infinite extensions of an\nactual sequence of trials; probabilities are then what the limiting\nrelative frequencies would be if the sequence were so\nextended. We might thus call this interpretation hypothetical\nfrequentism:\n\nthe probability of an attribute A in a reference class B is the\nvalue the limiting relative frequency of occurrences of A within B\nwould be if B were infinite.\n\n\nNote that at this point we have left empiricism behind. A modal\nelement has been injected into frequentism with this invocation of a\ncounterfactual; moreover, the counterfactual may involve a radical\ndeparture from the way things actually are, one that may even require\nthe breaking of laws of nature. (Think what it would take for the coin\nin my pocket, which has only been tossed once, to be tossed infinitely\nmany times \u2014 never wearing out, and never running short of\npeople willing to toss it!) One may wonder, moreover, whether there is\nalways \u2014 or ever \u2014 a fact of the matter of what such\ncounterfactual relative frequencies are.\n\nLimiting relative frequencies, we have seen, must be relativized to a\nsequence of trials. Herein lies another difficulty. Consider an\ninfinite sequence of the results of tossing a coin, as it might be H,\nT, H, H, H, T, H, T, T, \u2026 Suppose for definiteness that the\ncorresponding relative frequency sequence for heads, which begins 1/1,\n1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9, \u2026, converges to 1/2. By\nsuitably reordering these results, we can make the sequence converge\nto any value in [0, 1] that we like. (If this is not obvious, consider\nhow the relative frequency of even numbers among positive integers,\nwhich intuitively \u2018should\u2019 converge to 1/2, can instead be\nmade to converge to 1/4 by reordering the integers with the even\nnumbers in every fourth place, as follows: 1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 11, 4,\n13, 15, 17, 6, \u2026) To be sure, there may be something natural\nabout the ordering of the tosses as given \u2014 for example, it may\nbe their temporal ordering. But there may be more than one\nnatural ordering. Imagine the tosses taking place on a train that\nshunts backwards and forwards on tracks that are oriented west-east.\nThen the spatial ordering of the results from west to east\ncould look very different. Why should one ordering be privileged over\nothers?\n\nA well-known objection to any version of frequentism is that\nrelative frequencies must be relativised to a\nreference class. Consider a probability concerning myself that I care\nabout \u2014 say, my probability of living to age 80. I belong to the\nclass of males, the class of non-smokers, the class of philosophy\nprofessors who have two vowels in their surname, \u2026 Presumably\nthe relative frequency of those who live to age 80 varies across (most\nof) these reference classes. What, then, is my probability of living\nto age 80? It seems that there is no single frequentist answer.\nInstead, there is my probability-qua-male, my\nprobability-qua-non-smoker, my probability-qua-male-non-smoker, and so\non. This is an example of the so-called reference class\nproblem for frequentism (although it can be argued that analogues\nof the problem arise for the other interpretations as\n well[10]).\n And as we have seen in the previous paragraph, the problem is only\ncompounded for limiting relative frequencies: probabilities must be\nrelativized not merely to a reference class, but to a sequence within\nthe reference class. We might call this the reference sequence\nproblem.\n\nThe beginnings of a solution to this problem would be to restrict our\nattention to sequences of a certain kind, those with certain desirable\nproperties. For example, there are sequences for which the limiting\nrelative frequency of a given attribute does not exist; Reichenbach\nthus excludes such sequences. Von Mises (1957) gives us a more\nthoroughgoing restriction to what he calls collectives\n\u2014 hypothetical infinite sequences of attributes (possible\noutcomes) of specified experiments that meet certain requirements.\nCall a place-selection an effectively specifiable method of\nselecting indices of members of the sequence, such that the selection\nor not of the index \\(i\\) depends at most on the first \\(i - 1\\)\nattributes. Von Mises imposes these axioms:\n\nAxiom of Convergence: the limiting relative frequency of any\nattribute exists.\n\n\nAxiom of Randomness: the limiting relative frequency of each\nattribute in a collective \\(\\omega\\) is the same in any infinite\nsubsequence of \\(\\omega\\) which is determined by a place\nselection.\n\n\nThe probability of an attribute \\(A\\), relative to a collective\n\\(\\omega\\), is then defined as the limiting relative frequency of\n\\(A\\) in \\(\\omega\\). Note that a constant sequence such as H, H, H,\n\u2026, in which the limiting relative frequency is the same in\nany infinite subsequence, trivially satisfies the axiom of\nrandomness. This puts some strain on the terminology \u2014 offhand,\nsuch sequences appear to be as non-random as they come\n\u2014 although to be sure it is desirable that probabilities be\nassigned even in such sequences. Be that as it may, there is a\nparallel between the role of the axiom of randomness in von\nMises\u2019 theory and the principle of maximum entropy in the\nclassical theory: both attempt to capture a certain notion of\ndisorder.\n\nCollectives are abstract mathematical objects that are not empirically\ninstantiated, but that are nonetheless posited by von Mises to explain\nthe stabilities of relative frequencies in the behavior of actual\nsequences of outcomes of a repeatable random experiment. Church (1940)\nrenders precise the notion of a place selection as a recursive\nfunction. Nevertheless, the reference sequence problem remains:\nprobabilities must always be relativized to a collective, and for a\ngiven attribute such as \u2018heads\u2019 there are infinitely many.\nVon Mises embraces this consequence, insisting that the notion of\nprobability only makes sense relative to a collective. In particular,\nhe regards single case probabilities as nonsense: \u201cWe can say\nnothing about the probability of death of an individual even if we\nknow his condition of life and health in detail. The phrase\n\u2018probability of death\u2019, when it refers to a single person,\nhas no meaning at all for us\u201d (11). Some critics believe that\nrather than solving the problem of the single case, this merely\nignores it. And note that von Mises drastically understates the\ncommitments of his theory: by his lights, the phrase\n\u2018probability of death\u2019 also has no meaning at all when it\nrefers to a million people, or a billion, or any finite number \u2014\nafter all, collectives are infinite. More generally, it seems\nthat von Mises\u2019 theory has the unwelcome consequence that\nprobability statements never have meaning in the real world, for\napparently all sequences of attributes are finite.\n\nLet us see how the frequentist interpretations fare according to our\ncriteria of adequacy. Finite relative frequencies of course satisfy\nfinite additivity. In a finite reference class, only finitely many\nevents can occur, so only finitely many events can have positive\nrelative frequency. In that case, countable additivity is satisfied\nsomewhat trivially: all but finitely many terms in the infinite sum\nwill be 0. Limiting relative frequencies violate countable additivity\n(de Finetti 1972, \u00a75.22). Indeed, the domain of definition of\nlimiting relative frequency is not even a field, let alone a sigma\nfield (de Finetti 1972, \u00a75.8). So such relative frequencies do\nnot provide an admissible interpretation of Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms.\nFinite frequentism has no trouble meeting the ascertainability\ncriterion, as finite relative frequencies are in principle easily\ndetermined. The same cannot be said of limiting relative frequencies.\nOn the contrary, any finite sequence of trials (which, after all, is\nall we ever see) puts literally no constraint on the limit of an\ninfinite sequence; still less does an actual finite sequence\nput any constraint on the limit of an infinite hypothetical\nsequence, however fast and loose we play with the notion of \u2018in\nprinciple\u2019 in the ascertainability criterion.\n\nIt might seem that the frequentist interpretations resoundingly meet\nthe applicability to frequencies criterion. Finite frequentism meets\nit all too well, while hypothetical frequentism meets it in the wrong\nway. If anything, finite frequentism makes the connection between\nprobabilities and frequencies too tight, as we have already\nobserved. A fair coin that is tossed a million times is very\nunlikely to land heads exactly half the time; one\nthat is tossed a million and one times is even less likely to do so!\nFacts about finite relative frequencies should serve as evidence, but\nnot conclusive evidence, for the relevant probability\nassignments. Hypothetical frequentism fails to connect probabilities\nwith finite frequencies. It connects them with limiting relative\nfrequencies, of course, but again too tightly: for even in infinite\nsequences, the two can come apart. (A fair coin could land heads\nforever, even if it is highly unlikely to do so.) To be sure, science\nhas much interest in finite frequencies, and indeed working with them\nis much of the business of statistics. Whether it has any interest in\nhighly idealized, hypothetical extensions of actual sequences, and\nrelative frequencies therein, is another matter. The applicability to\nrational beliefs and to rational decisions go much the same way. Such\nbeliefs and decisions are guided by finite frequency information, but\nthey are not guided by information about limits of\nhypothetical frequencies, since one never has such information. For\nmuch more extensive critiques of finite frequentism and hypothetical\nfrequentism, see H\u00e1jek (1997) and H\u00e1jek (2009)\nrespectively, and La Caze (2016).\n",
