    "main_text": "Introduction: What is Economics? || The emergence of economics and of economies\n1.1 The emergence of economics and of economies\n\nPhilosophical reflection on economics is ancient, but the conception\nof the economy as a distinct object of study dates back only to the\n18th century. Aristotle addresses some problems that most would\nrecognize as pertaining to economics, mainly as problems concerning\nhow to manage a household. Scholastic philosophers addressed ethical\nquestions concerning economic behavior, and they condemned usury\n\u2014 that is, the taking of interest on money. With the increasing\nimportance of trade and of nation-states in the early modern period,\n\u2018mercantilist\u2019 philosophers and pamphleteers were largely\nconcerned with the balance of trade and the regulation of the\ncurrency. There was an increasing recognition of the complexities of\nthe financial management of the state and of the possibility that the\nway that the state taxed and acted influenced the production of\nwealth.\n\nIn the early modern period, those who reflected on the sources of a\ncountry\u2019s wealth recognized that the annual harvest, the\nquantities of goods manufactured, and the products of mines and\nfisheries depend on facts about nature, individual labor and\nenterprise, tools and what we would call \u201ccapital goods\u201d,\nand state and social regulations. Trade also seemed advantageous, at\nleast if the terms were good enough. It took no conceptual leap to\nrecognize that manufacturing and farming could be improved and that\nsome taxes and tariffs might be less harmful to productive activities\nthan others. But to formulate the idea that there is such a thing as\n\u201cthe economy\u201d with regularities that can be investigated\nrequires a bold further step. In order for there to be an object of\ninquiry, there must be regularities in production and exchange; and\nfor the inquiry to be non-trivial, these regularities must go beyond\nwhat is obvious to the producers, consumers, and exchangers\nthemselves. Only in the eighteenth century, most clearly illustrated\nby the work of Cantillon, the physiocrats,\n David Hume,\n and especially Adam Smith (see the entry on \n Smith\u2019s moral and political philosophy),\n does one find the idea that there are laws to be discovered that\ngovern the complex set of interactions that produce and distribute\nconsumption goods and the resources and tools that produce them\n(Backhouse 2002).\n\nCrucial to the possibility of a social object of scientific inquiry is\nthe idea of tracing out the unintended consequences of the intentional\nactions of individuals. Thus, for example, Hume traces the rise in\nprices and the temporary increase in economic activity that follow an\nincrease in currency to the perceptions and actions of individuals who\nfirst spend the additional currency (1752). In spending their\nadditional gold imported from abroad, traders do not intend to\nincrease the price level. But that is what they do nevertheless. Adam\nSmith expands and perfects this insight and offers a systematic\nInquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.\nFrom his account of the demise of feudalism (1776, Book II, Ch. 4) to\nhis famous discussion of the invisible hand, Smith emphasizes\nunintended consequences. \u201c[H]e intends only his own gain; and he\nis in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to\npromote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always\nthe worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his\nown interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more\neffectually than when he really intends to promote it\u201d (1776,\nBook IV, Ch. 2). The existence of regularities, which are the\nunintended consequences of individual choices gives rise to an object\nof scientific investigation.\n\nOne can distinguish the domain of economics from the domain of other\nsocial scientific inquiries either by specifying some set of causal\nfactors or by specifying some range of phenomena. The phenomena with\nwhich economists are concerned are production, consumption,\ndistribution and exchange\u2014particularly via markets. But since so\nmany different causal factors are relevant to these, including the\nlaws of thermodynamics, metallurgy, geography and social norms, even\nthe laws governing digestion, economics cannot be distinguished from\nother inquiries only by the phenomena it studies. Some\nreference to a set of central causal factors is needed. Thus, for\nexample,\n John Stuart Mill\n maintained that, \u201cPolitical economy\u2026[is concerned with]\nsuch of the phenomena of the social state as take place in consequence\nof the pursuit of wealth. It makes entire abstraction of every other\nhuman passion or motive, except those which may be regarded as\nperpetually antagonising principles to the desire of wealth, namely\naversion to labour, and desire of the present enjoyment of costly\nindulgences.\u201d (1843, Book VI, Chapter 9, Section 3) In\nMill\u2019s view, economics is mainly concerned with the consequences\nof individual pursuit of tangible wealth, though it takes some account\nof less significant motives such as aversion to labor.\n\nMill takes it for granted that individuals act rationally in their\npursuit of wealth and luxury and avoidance of labor, rather than in a\ndisjointed or erratic way, but he has no theory of consumption, or\nexplicit theory of rational economic choice, and his theory of\nresource allocation is rather thin. These gaps were gradually filled\nduring the so-called neoclassical or marginalist revolution, which\nlinked choice of some object of consumption (and its price) not to its\ntotal utility but to its marginal utility. For example, water is\nobviously extremely useful, but in much of the world it is plentiful\nenough that another glass more or less matters little to an agent. So\nwater is cheap. Early \u201cneoclassical\u201d economists such as\nWilliam Stanley Jevons held that agents make consumption choices so as\nto maximize their own happiness (1871). This implies that they\ndistribute their expenditures so that a dollar\u2019s worth of water\nor porridge or upholstery makes the same contribution to their\nhappiness. The \u201cmarginal utility\u201d of a dollar\u2019s\nworth of each good is the same.\n\nIn the Twentieth Century, economists stripped this theory of its\nhedonistic clothing (Pareto 1909, Hicks and Allen 1934). Rather than\nsupposing that all consumption choices can be ranked by how much they\npromote an agent\u2019s happiness, economists focused on the ranking\nitself. All that they suppose concerning evaluations is that agents\nare able consistently to rank the alternatives they face. This is\nequivalent to supposing first that rankings are complete \u2014 that\nis, for any two alternatives x and y that the agent\nconsiders, either the agent ranks x above y (prefers\nx to y), or the agent prefers y to\nx, or the agent is indifferent. Second, economists suppose\nthat agent\u2019s rankings of alternatives (preferences) are\ntransitive. To say that an agent\u2019s preferences are transitive is\nto claim that if the agent prefers x to y and\ny to z, then the agent prefers x to\nz, with similar claims concerning indifference and\ncombinations of indifference and preference. Though there are further\ntechnical conditions to extend the theory to infinite sets of\nalternatives and to capture further plausible rationality conditions\nconcerning gambles, economists generally subscribe to a view of\nrational agents as at least possessing complete and transitive\npreferences and as choosing among the feasible alternatives whichever\nthey most prefer. In the theory of revealed preference, economists\nhave attempted unsuccessfully to eliminate all reference to subjective\npreference or to define preference in terms of choices (Samuelson\n1947, Houtthaker 1950, Little 1957, Sen 1971, 1973, Hausman 2012,\nchapter 3).\n\nIn clarifying the view of rationality that characterizes economic\nagents, economists have for the most part continued to distinguish\neconomics from other social inquiries by the content of the motives or\npreferences with which it is concerned. So even though people may seek\nhappiness through asceticism, or they may rationally prefer to\nsacrifice all their worldly goods to a political cause, economists\nhave supposed that such preferences are rare and unimportant to\neconomics. Economists are concerned with the phenomena deriving from\nrationality coupled with a desire for wealth and for larger bundles of\ngoods and services.\n\nEconomists have flirted with a less substantive characterization of\nindividual motivation and with a more expansive view of the domain of\neconomics. In his influential monograph, An Essay on the Nature\nand Significance of Economic Science, Lionel Robbins defined\neconomics as \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a\nrelationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative\nuses\u201d (1932, p. 15). According to Robbins, economics is not\nconcerned with production, exchange, distribution, or consumption as\nsuch. It is instead concerned with an aspect of all human action.\nRobbins\u2019 definition helps one to understand efforts to\napply economic concepts, models, and techniques to other subject\nmatters such as the analysis of voting behavior and legislation, even as\neconomics maintains its connection to a traditional domain.\n",
