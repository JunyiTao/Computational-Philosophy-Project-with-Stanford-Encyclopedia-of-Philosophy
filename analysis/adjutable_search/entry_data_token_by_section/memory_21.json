    "main_text": "The Self || Personal identity\n7.1 Personal identity\n\nLocke ([1689] 1998)\u2014who was perhaps anticipated in this by\nSpinoza (Lin 2005)\u2014discussed the idea that what makes a person\nat a given time count as the same person as a person at an earlier\ntime is that he remembers the earlier person\u2019s experiences. This\nmemory theory of personal identity\n has been much discussed since Locke (Mathews, Bok, & Rabins\n2009), and there are well-known substantive and methodological\nproblems for it. The primary substantive problem is that the memory\ncriterion for personal identity appears to be uninformative, because\none can by definition remember only one\u2019s own experiences, not\nthose of anyone else\u2014if memory thus presupposes personal\nidentity, it is unenlightening to say that personal identity\npresupposes memory. There have been attempts to meet this objection by\nintroducing the notion of quasi-memory, which is meant to be\nlike the notion of memory without the implication of personal identity\n(Buford 2009; Parfit 1984; Roache 2006; Shoemaker 1970). While the\nnotion of quasi-memory may enable us to disentangle memory from\npersonal identity, it remains to be seen whether it is empirically\ndefensible (Northoff 2000).\n\nThe primary methodological problem is that arguments for and against\nthe memory criterion tend to rely on thought experiments involving\nmemory swapping and other such cases. Moving away from these far-out\ncases, some philosophers have preferred to consider the implications\nof real memory disorders. Craver (2012; cf. Craver, Kwan, Steindam,\n& Rosenbaum 2014), for example, has argued on\nthe basis of cases of episodic amnesia such as that of the well known\npatient KC (Rosenbaum et al. 2005) that memory is not a presupposition of\nselfhood. Others have preferred to build on cognitive psychological\ntheories of autobiographical memory. Schechtman (1994, 2011), for\nexample, has argued that memory does not and need not provide simple\nconnections between discrete past and present moments of\nconsciousness, maintaining that what matters, as far as the sense of\npersonal identity is concerned, is the way in which autobiographical\nmemory summarizes, constructs, interprets, and condenses distinct\nmoments from the personal past to produce a coherent overall narrative\n(cf. Goldie 2012). Approaches such as Schechtman\u2019s appear to\ninvolve a change of subject, from personal identity as such\nto the subject\u2019s sense of personal identity. This shift\nis explicit in Klein and Nichols\u2019 (2012) examination of the role\nof autonoesis in underwriting the sense of personal identity\u2014the\nsense that one now is the same person as someone at an earlier time.\nRoache (2016) has questioned Klein and Nichols\u2019 interpretation\nof the clinical case on which their argument depends, and the debate\nover the relationship between autonoesis and the sense of personal\nidentity is ongoing (Fern\u00e1ndez forthcoming; Klein 2016b).\n",
