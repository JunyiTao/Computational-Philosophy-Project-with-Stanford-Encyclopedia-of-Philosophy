    "main_text": "The Paradox of Fiction\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has focused on a number of central issues in the philosophy\nof fiction: the nature of fiction; what it means to say that something\nis a truth of fiction; what (and in what sense)\nwe can learn from fiction; and how we can have emotional responses to\ncharacters of fiction. There are other issues in the philosophy of\nfiction that could have been discussed in this entry, a number\nof them the subject of related entries. Consider the question of\nwhat makes something a correct interpretation of a work of literary\nfiction. This topic, which is connected to the issue of truth in fiction,\nbecame of intense interest to both philosophers and literary theorists\nfollowing the publication of Wimsatt and Beardsley\u2019s \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d (1946), although the topic of\ninterpretation itself has a long history going back as far as Greek\nantiquity (see the entry on\n hermeneutics).\n There are also problems involving our reasons for seeking out works of\nfiction of various kinds. The previous section discussed the so-called\nparadox of fiction, but as it turns out this is a relative newcomer to\nthe set of problems that involve our engagement with works of\nfiction. There is also the much-debated puzzle of why we enjoy works\nof tragedy (and even horror); sadness and fear are scarcely emotions\nthat we would normally welcome, let alone enjoy, yet people readily\nengage with works of tragedy. (The so-called paradox of tragedy\nreceived a famous treatment, still debated in contemporary philosophy,\nat the hands of Aristotle in the\nPoetics, who also used tragedy as an example of how we can\nlearn from fiction.)  A newer problem,\nalthough discussion goes back to at least Hume, is the so-called\nproblem of imaginative resistance: given the ease with which readers\nof fiction can entertain all kinds of implausible fictional scenarios,\neven impossible ones, what explains the impediments we face when asked\nto imagine certain sorts of situations, for example ones in which\nmorally horrendous acts like torturing an innocent person are\nconsidered morally right? (For an overview of these puzzles, see\n the supplement to the entry on\n imagination).\n Juxtaposing these\nvarious problems and issues not only gives a good indication of the\nthematic richness of contemporary philosophy of fiction, but also\nreminds us of its long history.\n",
