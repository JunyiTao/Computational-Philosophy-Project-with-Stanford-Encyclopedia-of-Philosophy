    "main_text": "Representations of Full Belief || AGM Belief Revision\n2.2 AGM Belief Revision Theory\n\nLike nonmonotonic logic, the theory of belief revision is concerned\nwith how to update one\u2019s beliefs in light of new evidence. When\nthe new evidence is consistent with all prior beliefs, the counsel of\nthe theory is simple, if exacting: simply add the new evidence to your\nold stock of beliefs and close under deductive consequence. Things are\nmore complicated when the new evidence is inconsistent with your prior\nbeliefs. If you want to incorporate the new information and remain\nlogically consistent, you will have to retract some of your original\nbeliefs. The central problem of belief revision is that deductive\nlogic alone cannot tell you which of your beliefs to give\nup\u2013this has to be decided by some other means.\n\nConsidering a similar problem, Quine and Ullian (1970) enunciated the\nprinciple of \u201cconservatism,\u201d conseling that our new\nbeliefs \u201cmay have to conflict with some of our previous beliefs;\nbut the fewer the better.\u201d In his (1990), Quine dubs this the\n\u201cmaxim of minimal mutilation.\u201d Inspired by these\nsuggestive principles, Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and\nMakinson (1985) developed a highly influential theory of belief\nrevision, known thereafter as AGM theory, after its three originators.\n\n\nIn AGM theory, an agent\u2019s beliefs are represented by a set of\nsentences \\(\\bB\\) from a formal language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). The set\n\\(\\bB\\) is called the belief state of the agent. The belief\nstate is required to be consistent and deductively closed (Hintikka\n1961 and the entry on\n epistemic logic).\n Of course, this is a somewhat unrealistic idealization. Levi (1991)\ndefends this idealization by changing the interpretation of the set\n\\(\\bB\\)\u2013these are the sentences that the agent is\ncommitted to believe, not those that she actually believes.\nAlthough we may never live up to our commitments, Levi argues that we\nare committed to the logical consequences of our beliefs. That may\nrescue the principle, but only by changing the interpretation of the\ntheory.\n\nAGM theory studies three different types of belief change.\nContraction occurs when the belief state \\(\\bB\\) is replaced\nby \\(\\bB\\div \\alpha\\), a logically closed subset of \\( \\bB\\) no longer\ncontaining \\(\\alpha\\). Expansion occurs when the belief state\n\\( \\bB\\) is replaced with \\(\\bB+\\alpha = \\Cn(\\bB\\cup \\{\\alpha \\})\\),\nthe result of simply adding \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(\\bB\\) and closing under\nlogical consequence. Revision occurs when the belief state\n\\(\\bB\\) is replaced by the belief state \\(\\bB*\\alpha\\), the result of\n\u201cminimally mutilating\u201d \\(\\bB\\) in order to accommodate\n\\(\\alpha\\).\n\nContraction is the fundamental form of belief change studied by AGM.\nThere is no mystery in how to define expansion, and revision is\nusually defined derivatively via the  Levi identity (1977):\n\\(\\bB*p = (\\bB \\div \\neg p) + p.\\) Setting the mold for future work\n(G\u00e4rdenfors 1988, G\u00e4rdenfors and Rott 1995),\nAlchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson (1985) proceed\naxiomatically: they postulate several principles that every rational\ncontraction operation must satisfy. Fundamental to AGM theory are\nseveral representation theorems showing that certain intuitive\nconstructions give rise to contraction operations satisfying the basic\npostulates and conversely, that every operation satisfying the basic\npostulates can be seen as the outcome of such a construction. See the\nentry on\n belief revision,\n Huber (2013a), or Lin (2019) for an excellent introduction to these\nresults. \n\nAGM theory is unique in focusing on belief contraction. For someone\nconcerned with maintaining a database, contraction is a fairly natural\noperation. Medical researchers might want to publish a data set, but\nmake sure that it cannot be used to identify their patients. Privacy\nregulations may force data collectors to \u201cforget\u201d certain\nfacts about you and, naturally, they would want to do this as\nconservatively as possible. However, a plausible argument holds that\nall forms of rational belief change occurring \u201cin the\nwild\u201d involve learning new information, rather than\nconservatively removing an old belief. All the other formalisms\ncovered in the article focus on this form of belief change. For this\nreason, we focus on the AGM theory of revision and neglect\ncontraction.\n\nBefore delving into some of the technical development, we mention some\nimportant objections and alternatives to the AGM framework. As we have\nmentioned, the belief state of an agent is represented by the\n(deductively closed) set \\(\\bB\\) of sentences the agent is committed\nto believe. The structure of the agent\u2019s  reasons is\nnot explicitly represented: you cannot tell of any two\n\\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in \\bB\\) whether one is a reason for the other.\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1992) distinguishes between  foundations\ntheories, that keep track of which beliefs justify which others, and\n coherence theories, which ignore the structure of\njustification and focus instead on whether beliefs are consistent with\none another. Arguing for the coherence approach, he draws a stark\ndistinction between the two:\n\n\nAccording to the foundations theory, belief revision should consist,\nfirst, in giving up all beliefs that no longer have a \nsatisfactory justification and, second, in adding new beliefs\nthat have become justified. On the other hand, according to the\ncoherence theory, the objectives are, first, to maintain \nconsistency in the revised epistemic state, and, second, to make\n minimal changes of the old state that guarantee overall\ncoherence. \n\n\nImplicit in this passage is the idea that foundations theory are out\nof sympathy with the principle of minimal mutilation. Elsewhere\n(1988), G\u00e4rdenfors is more conciliatory, suggesting that some\nhybrid theory is possible and perhaps even preferable:\n\n\nI admit that the postulates for contractions and revisions that have\nbeen introduced here are quite simpleminded, but they seem to capture\nwhat can be formulated for the meager structure of belief sets. In\nricher models of epistemic states, admitting, for example, reasons to\nbe formulated, the corresponding conservativity postulates must be\nformulated much more cautiously (p. 67).\n\n\nPreviously, we have seen Pollock (1987) advocating for\nfoundationalism. In artificial intelligence, Doyle\u2019s (1979) \nreason maintenance system is taken to exemplify the foundations\napproach. Horty (2012) argues that\n default logic\n aptly represents the structure of reasons. For a defense of\nfoundationalism, as well as a useful comparison of the two approaches,\nsee Doyle (1992).\n\nAnother foundationalist view advocates for  belief bases\ninstead of belief states. A belief base is a set of sentences that is\ntypically not closed under logical consequence. Its elements represent\n\u201cbasic\u201d beliefs that are not derived from other beliefs.\nThis allows us to distinguish between sentences that are explicit\nbeliefs, like \u201cShakespeare wrote Hamlet\u201d and\nnever-thought-of deductive consequences like \u201cEither Shakespeare\nwrote Hamlet or Alan Turing was born on a Monday.\u201d Revision and\ncontraction are then redefined to operate on belief bases, rather than\nbelief sets. That allows for finer distinctions to be articulated,\nsince belief bases which have the same logical closure are not treated\ninterchangeably. For an introduction to belief bases see the\nrelevant section of the entry on the  \n logic of belief revision.\n For a book-length treatment, see Hansson (1999b).\n\nFinally, one of the most common criticisms of AGM theory is that it\ndoes not illuminate  iterated belief change. In the\nfollowing, we shall see that the canonical revision operation takes as\ninput an entrenchment ordering on a belief state, but outputs a belief\nstate without an entrenchment order. That severely underdetermines the\nresult of a subsequent revision. For more on the problem of iterated\nbelief revision, see Huber (2013a).\n2.2.1 Principles for Belief Revision \n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988) proposes the following postulates for rational\nbelief revision. For every set of sentences \\(\\bB \\subseteq\n\\mathbf{L}\\) and any sentences \\(\\alpha , \\beta \\in \\mathbf{L}\\):\n\n\n(AGM*1)\n\\(\\bB * \\alpha = \\Cn(\\bB *\\alpha)\\);\nClosure \n\n(AGM*2)\n\\(\\alpha \\in \\bB * \\alpha\\);\nSuccess  \n\n(AGM*3)\n\\( \\bB * \\alpha \\subseteq \\Cn(\\bB \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}) \\);\nInclusion \n\n(AGM*4)\nIf \\(\\neg \\alpha \\not\\in \\bB \\), then \\( \\Cn(\\bB \\cup\n\\{\\alpha\\}) \\subseteq \\bB * \\alpha \\);\nPreservation \n\n(AGM*5)\n\\(\\bB * \\alpha\\) is inconsistent iff \\( \\vdash \\neg\n\\alpha\\);\nConsistency \n\n(AGM*6)\nIf \\(\\vdash \\alpha \\leftrightarrow \\beta\\), then \\(\\bB * \\alpha\n= \\bB *\\beta\\). \nExtensionality \n\n\nClosure, Success, Consistency and Extensionality all impose\nsynchronic constraints on \\(\\bB*\\alpha\\). They say nothing\nabout how it must be related to the prior belief state \\(\\bB\\).\nClosure requires the new belief set to be deductively closed. Dropping\nthis requirement puts you in the camp of belief bases, rather\nthan belief sets (Hansson 1999a). Success requires that the new\ninformation is included in the new belief state.\nNon-prioritized belief revision relaxes this requirement\n(Hansson 1999a). Extensionality requires that the agent is sensitive\nonly to the logical content of the evidence, and not to its mode of\npresentation. Consistency requires that the new belief state is\nlogically consistent, at least when the evidence is\nnon-contradictory.\n\nPreservation and Inclusion are the only norms that are really about\nrevision\u2013they capture the diachronic spirit of AGM\nrevision. Inclusion says that revision by \\(\\alpha\\) should yield \nno more new beliefs than expansion by \\(\\alpha\\). In other words,\nany sentence \\(\\beta\\) that you come to believe after revising by\n\\(\\alpha\\) is a deductive consequence of \\(\\alpha\\) and your prior\nbeliefs. Consider the following principle:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf \\(\\beta \\in \\bB * \\alpha,\\) then \\((\\alpha \\rightarrow\n\\beta)\\in\\bB\\).\nConditionalization \n\n\nIn\n Section 2.1.1,\n we considered an analogue of conditionalization for nonmonotonic\nlogic. All the same objections apply equally well in the context of\nbelief revision. Recall from\n Section 1.2\n that a deductive consequence relation admits a deduction theorem iff\n\\(\\Delta \\cup \\{ \\alpha\\} \\vdash \\beta\\) implies that \\(\\Delta \\vdash\n\\alpha\\rightarrow \\beta.\\) So long as a deduction theorem is provable\nfor \\(\\Cn(\\cdot),\\) Inclusion and Conditionalization are equivalent.\nIf you found any of the arguments against Conditionalization\nconvincing, you ought to be skeptical of Inclusion.\n\nPreservation says that, so long as the new information \\(\\alpha\\) is\nlogically consistent with your prior beliefs, all of your prior\nbeliefs survive revision by \\(\\alpha\\). In the setting of\nnon-monotonic logic, we called this principle Rational Monotony. All\nobjections and counterexamples to Rational Monotony from\n Section 2.1.1\n apply equally well in belief revision. As we have seen, Preservation\nrules out any kind of  undercutting defeat of previously\nsuccessful defeasible inferences. Accepting both Preservation\n(rational monotonicity) and Inclusion (conditionalization) amounts to\nsaying that when confronted with new evidence that is logically\nconsistent with her beliefs, a rational agent responds by simply\nforming the deductive closure of her existing beliefs with the new\nevidence. On that view, deductive logic is the only necessary guide to\nreasoning, so long as you do not run into contradiction.\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988) also proposes the following two additional\nrevision postulates, closely related to Inclusion and\nPreservation.\n\n\n(AGM*7)\n\\( \\bB * (\\alpha\\wedge \\beta) \\subseteq \\Cn(\\bB*\\alpha \\cup\n\\{\\beta\\}) \\);\nConjunctive Inclusion \n\n(AGM*8)\nIf \\(\\neg \\beta \\not\\in \\bB*\\alpha \\), then \\( \\Cn(\\bB*\\alpha\n\\cup \\{\\beta\\}) \\subseteq \\bB * (\\alpha\\wedge\\beta) \\).\nConjunctive Preservation \n\n\nIt is possible to make the connection between belief revision and\nnonmonotonic logic precise. Given a belief set \\(\\bB\\) and a revision\noperation \\(*,\\) we can define a defeasible consequence relation by\nsetting \\(\\alpha \\dproves \\beta \\text{ iff } \\beta \\in \\bB*\\alpha.\\)\nSimilarly, given a defeasible consequence relation \\(\\dproves\\) we can\ndefine \\(\\bB = \\{ \\alpha : \\top \\dproves \\alpha \\} \\text{ and } \\bB *\n\\alpha = \\{ \\beta : \\alpha\\dproves \\beta \\}.\\) Then it is possible to\nprove the following correspondences between AGM belief revision and\nthe set of principles we called System R in\n Section 2.1.1.\n It follows that AGM revision can be represented in terms of a total\npreferential model over possible worlds.\n\n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(*\\) is a revision operation\nfor \\(\\bB\\) satisfying all eight revision postulates. Then, the\nnon-nonmonotonic consequence relation given by \\(\\alpha \\dproves \\beta\n\\text{ iff } \\beta \\in \\bB * \\alpha\\) satisfies all the principles of\nSystem R. Conversely, suppose that \\(\\dproves\\) is a consequence\nrelation that satisfies all the principles of System R. Then, the\nrevision operation \\(*\\) defined letting \\(\\bB = \\{ \\alpha : \\top\n\\dproves \\alpha \\}\\) and \\(\\bB*\\alpha = \\{ \\beta : \\alpha \\dproves\n\\beta \\}\\) satisfies all eight revision postulates.\n\n2.2.2 Entrenchment \n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988) introduces the notion of an entrenchment\nrelation in the following way:\n\n\nEven if all sentences in a \u2026 set are accepted or considered as\nfacts \u2026, this does not mean that all sentences are of equal\nvalue for planning or problem-solving purposes. \u2026 We will say\nthat some sentences \u2026 have a higher degree of epistemic\nentrenchment than others. The degree of entrenchment will,\nintuitively, have a bearing on what is abandoned \u2026, and what is\nretained, when a contraction or revision is carried out. \n\n\nTo model the degree of entrenchment, a relation \\(\\preceq\\) is\nintroduced holding between sentences of the language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\nThe notation \\(\\alpha \\preceq \\beta\\) is pronounced \u2018\\(\\alpha\\)\nis at most as entrenched as \\(\\beta\\).\u2019 G\u00e4rdenfors (1988)\nrequires that the relation satisfies the following postulates. For all\n\\(\\alpha , \\beta , \\gamma\\) in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\): \n\n\n\\(({\\preccurlyeq}1)\\) \nIf \\(\\alpha \\preccurlyeq \\beta\\) and \\(\\beta \\preccurlyeq\n\\gamma\\), then \\(\\alpha \\preccurlyeq \\gamma\\)\nTransitivity \n\n\\(({\\preccurlyeq}2)\\) \nIf \\(\\alpha \\vdash \\beta\\), then \\(\\alpha \\preccurlyeq\n\\beta\\)\nDominance \n\n\\(({\\preccurlyeq}3)\\) \n\\(\\alpha \\preccurlyeq \\alpha \\wedge \\beta\\) or \\(\\beta\n\\preccurlyeq \\alpha \\wedge \\beta\\)\nConjunctivity \n\n\\(({\\preccurlyeq}4)\\) \nIf \\(\\bot \\not\\in \\Cn(\\bB)\\), then \\([\\alpha \\not\\in \\bB\\) if\nand only if for all \\(\\beta\\) in \\(\\mathbf{L}: \\alpha \\preccurlyeq\n\\beta]\\)\nMinimality \n\n\\(({\\preccurlyeq}5)\\) \nIf for all \\(\\alpha\\) in \\(\\mathbf{L}: \\alpha \\preccurlyeq\n\\beta\\), then \\(\\beta \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\)\nMaximality \n\n\nGiven a fixed set of background beliefs \\(\\bB\\) and an entrenchment\nordering \\(\\preccurlyeq\\) on \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and letting \\(\\alpha\n\\preccurlyneq \\beta\\) hold just in case \\(\\alpha \\preccurlyeq \\beta\\)\nand \\(\\beta \\not\\preccurlyeq \\alpha\\), we can define a revision\noperator \\(*\\) as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\bB * \\alpha = \\Cn(\\{\\beta \\in \\bB: \\neg \\alpha\n \\preccurlyneq \\beta \\}\\cup \\{\\alpha \\})\n\\]\n\n\nThe idea behind this equation is that the agent revises by \\(\\alpha\\)\nby first clearing from her belief set anything less entrenched than\n\\(\\neg \\alpha,\\) (by dominance, this includes everything entailing\n\\(\\neg \\alpha\\)), adding \\(\\alpha\\), and then closing under logical\nconsequence. G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson (1988) prove that this\ndefinition gives rise to a revision operator satisfying AGM*1\u20138\nand, conversely, that every revision operator satisfying AGM*1\u20138\ncan be seen as arising from some entrenchment order in this\nway. These results illustrate why AGM theory is not a theory of\niterated revision: the revision operation takes as input an\nentrenchment order and belief state, but outputs only a belief state.\nThat severely underdetermines the results of subsequent revisions.\n\n\nGrove (1988) proves an analogous representation theorem for a systems\nof spheres semantics that generalizes Lewis\u2019 (1973) semantics\nfor counterfactuals. See the relevant section of the entry on the\n logic of belief revision\n for an introduction to\nGrove's possible world semantics. Segerberg (1995) formulates the AGM\napproach in the framework of dynamic doxastic logic. Lindstr\u00f6m\n& Rabinowicz (1999) extend this to iterated belief revision. Of\nnecessity, our presentation of belief revision theory has been rather\ncompressed. For an excellent article-length introduction, see the\nentry on\n logic of belief revision,\n Huber (2013a), or Lin (2019). For a book-length treatment see\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988), Hansson (1999), or Rott (2001). \n",
