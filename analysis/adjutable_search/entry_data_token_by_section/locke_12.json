The Two Treatises Of Government\n\nLord Shaftsbury had been dismissed from his post as Lord Chancellor in\n1673 and had become one of the leaders of the opposition party, the\nCountry Party. In 1679 the chief issue was the attempt by the Country\nParty leaders to exclude James, Duke of York from succeeding his\nbrother Charles II to the throne. They wanted to do this because James\nwas a Catholic, and England by this time was a firmly Protestant\ncountry. They had acquired a majority in the House of Commons through\nserious grass roots election campaigns, and passed an exclusion bill,\nbut given the King\u2019s unwillingness to see his brother excluded\nfrom the throne, the bill failed in the House of Lords. They tried a\ncouple of more times without success. Having failed by parliamentary\nmeans, some of the Country Party leaders started plotting armed\nrebellion.\n\nThe Two Treatises of Government were published in 1689, long\nafter the rebellion plotted by the Country party leaders had failed to\nmaterialize and after Shaftsbury had fled the country for Holland and\ndied. The introduction of the Two Treatises was written after\nthe Glorious Revolution of 1688, and gave the impression that the book\nwas written to justify the Glorious Revolution. We now know that the\nTwo Treatises of Government were written during the Exclusion\ncrisis in 1681 and may have been intended in part to justify the\ngeneral armed rising which the Country Party leaders were\nplanning.\n\nThere were serious obstacles to a rebellion to force James\u2019\nexclusion from the throne. The English Anglican gentry needed to\nsupport such an action. But the Anglican church from childhood on\ntaught that: \u201c\u2026men\u2019s political duties were\nexhaustively determined by their terrestrial superiors, that under\ngrave conscientious scruples they might rightly decline to carry out\nthose decrees of authority which were in direct breach of divine law,\nthey could under no circumstances have a right to resist such\nauthority\u201d. (Dunn, 1968, 48) Since by 1679 it was abundantly\nclear that the King opposed excluding his brother from the throne, to\nfavor exclusion implied \u201cexplicit and self-conscious resistance\nto the sovereign\u201d. Passive resistance would simply not do. On\nthe other hand, the royal policy \u201coutraged their deepest\nreligious prejudices and stimulated their most obscure emotional\nanxieties.\u201d So, the gentry were deeply conflicted and neither of\nthe choices available to them looked very palatable. John Dunn goes on\nto remark: \u201cTo exert influence upon their choice it was above\nall necessary to present a more coherent ordering of their values, to\nshow that the political tradition within which the dissenters saw\ntheir conduct was not necessarily empirically absurd or socially\nsubversive. The gentry had to be persuaded that there could be reason\nfor rebellion which could make it neither blasphemous or\nsuicidal.\u201d (Dunn, 1968, 49) To achieve this goal Locke picked\nthe most relevant and extreme of the supporters of the divine right of\nKings to attack. Sir Robert Filmer (c 1588\u20131653), a man of the\ngeneration of Charles I and the English Civil War, who had defended\nthe crown in various works. His most famous work, however,\nPatriarcha, was published posthumously in 1680 and\nrepresented the most complete and coherent exposition of the view\nLocke wished to deny. Filmer held that men were born into helpless\nservitude to an authoritarian family, a social hierarchy and a\nsovereign whose only constraint was his relationship with God. Under\nthese circumstances, anything other than passive obedience would be\n\u201cvicious, blasphemous and intellectually absurd.\u201d So,\nLocke needed to refute Filmer and in Dunn\u2019s words: \u201crescue\nthe contractarian account of political obligation from the criticism\nof impiety and absurdity. Only in this way could he restore to the\nAnglican gentry a coherent basis for moral autonomy or a practical\ninitiative in the field of politics.\u201d (Dunn, 1968, 50)\n\nThe First Treatise of Government is a polemical work aimed at\nrefuting the theological basis for the patriarchal version of the\nDivine Right of Kings doctrine put forth by Sir Robert Filmer. Locke\nsingles out Filmer\u2019s contention that men are not\n\u201cnaturally free\u201d as the key issue, for that is the\n\u201cground\u201d or premise on which Filmer erects his argument\nfor the claim that all \u201clegitimate\u201d government is\n\u201cabsolute monarchy\u201d\u2014kings being descended from the\nfirst man, Adam, and their subjects being naturally slaves. Early in\nthe First Treatise Locke denies that either scripture or\nreason supports Filmer\u2019s premise or arguments. In what follows\nin the First Treatise, Locke minutely examines key Biblical\npassages.\n\nWhile The Second Treatise of Government provides\nLocke\u2019s positive theory of government, it also continues his\nargument against Sir Robert Filmer\u2019s claims that monarchs\nlegitimately hold absolute power over their subjects. Locke holds that\nFilmer\u2019s view is sufficiently incoherent to lead to governments\nbeing established by force and violence. Thus, Locke claims he must\nprovide an alternative account of the origin of government \u201clest\nmen fall into the dangerous belief that all government in the world is\nmerely the product of force and violence\u201d (Treatises\nII,1,4). Locke\u2019s account involves several devices which were\ncommon in seventeenth and eighteenth century political\nphilosophy\u2014natural rights theory and the social contract.\nNatural rights are those rights which we are supposed to have as human\nbeings before ever government comes into being. We might suppose, that\nlike other animals, we have a natural right to struggle for our\nsurvival. Locke will argue that we have a right to the means to\nsurvive. When Locke comes to explain how government comes into being,\nhe uses the idea that people agree that their condition in the state\nof nature is unsatisfactory, and so agree to transfer some of their\nrights to a central government, while retaining others. This is the\ntheory of the social contract. There are many versions of natural\nrights theory and the social contract in seventeenth and eighteenth\ncentury European political philosophy, some conservative and some\nradical. Locke\u2019s version belongs on the radical side of the\nspectrum. These radical natural right theories influenced the\nideologies of the American and French revolutions.\n\nLocke\u2019s strategy for refuting Filmer\u2019s claims that\nmonarchs have absolute power over their subjects is to show that\nFilmer is conflating a whole variety of limited powers, all of which\nmight be held by one man and thus give the false appearance that a\nking has absolute power over wives, children, servants and slaves as\nwell as subjects of a commonwealth. When properly distinguished,\nhowever, and the limitations of each displayed, it becomes clear that\nmonarchs have no legitimate absolute power over their subjects.\n",
