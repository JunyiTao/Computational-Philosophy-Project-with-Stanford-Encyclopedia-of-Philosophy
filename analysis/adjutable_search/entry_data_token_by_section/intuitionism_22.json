    "main_text": "Philosophy || Dummett\n6.3 Dummett\n\nThe British philosopher Michael Dummett (1975) developed a\nphilosophical basis for Intuitionism, in particular for intuitionistic\nlogic. Dummett explicitly states that his theory is not an exegesis of\nBrouwer\u2019s work, but a possible philosophical theory for (in his\nwords) repudiating classical reasoning in mathematics in favor of\nintuitionistic reasoning.\n\nDummett\u2019s approach starts with the idea that the choice for one\nlogic over another must necessarily lie in the meaning one attaches to\nlogical statements. In the theory of meaning that Dummett uses, which\nis based on Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas about language and in\nparticular on his idea that meaning is use, the meaning of a\nsentence is determined by the way in which the sentence is used. The\nmeaning of a mathematical statement manifests itself in the use made\nof it, and the understanding of it is the knowledge of the\ncapacity to use the statement. This view is supported by the way in\nwhich we acquire mathematical knowledge. When we learn a mathematical\nnotion we learn how to use it: how to compute it, prove it or infer\nfrom it. And the only way to establish that we have grasped the\nmeaning of a mathematical statement lies in our proficiency in making\ncorrect use of the statement. \n\nGiven this view on meaning, the central notion in the theory of\nmeaning for mathematics is not, as in Platonism, truth, but\nproof; the understanding of a mathematical statement consists\nin the ability to recognize a proof of it when one is presented with\none. This then, as Dummett argues, leads to the adoption of\nintuitionistic logic as the logic of mathematical reasoning. \n\nInterestingly, as Dummett (1975) remarks himself, his theory of\nmeaning is far apart from Brouwer\u2019s ideas on mathematics as an\nessentially languageless activity. So that there are at least two\nquite different lines of thought that lead to the adoption of\nintuitionistic logic over classical logic, the one developed by\nBrouwer and the one argued for by Dummett. Dummett\u2019s work on\nIntuitionism has been commented on by various philosophers such as Dag\nPrawitz (1977), Parsons (1986) and Richard Tieszen (1994 en 2000). \n",
