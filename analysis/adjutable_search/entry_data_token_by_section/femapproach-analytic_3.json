Characteristics of Analytic Feminism\n\nAlthough there had been feminist philosophers using analytic methods\nsince the late 1960s, as feminist philosophy developed in the areas of\nepistemology, philosophy of science, and metaphysics there were\nclusters of controversies over the compatibility of feminist politics\nwith a preference for analytic philosophical methods. Panels at\nAmerican Philosophical Association meetings and discussions at the\nSociety for Women in Philosophy generated essays that explored these\nmatters. See, for example, issues of The APA Newsletter on\nFeminism and Philosophy (Tuana 1992; Meyers & Antony\n1993).\n\nThe term \u201canalytic feminist\u201d came into use in the early\n1990s in North America. Virginia Klenk proposed a Society for\nAnalytical Feminism (see\n Other Internet Resources)\n in 1991 and was its first president (Cudd & Norlock 2018 recount\nthe story). Ann Cudd characterized analytic feminism on the\norganization\u2019s website (see Cudd 1996 [2006) and in a special\nissue of Hypatia on Analytic Feminism (Cudd & Klenk\n1995). She notes that there is at best a family resemblance among\nanalytic feminists. Among the characteristics she cites are the\nfollowing:\n\n\nAnalytic feminism holds that the best way for scholars to counter\nsexism and androcentrism is through forming a clear conception of and\npursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality,\njustice, and the good while recognizing that these notions have often\nbeen perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy\n\u2026. Analytic feminism holds that many traditional philosophical\nnotions are not only normatively compelling, but also in some ways\nempowering and liberating for women. While postmodern feminism rejects\nthe universality of truth, justice and objectivity and the univocality\nof \u201cwomen\u201d, analytic feminism defends these notions. (Cudd\n1996 [2006: 158])\n\n\nAs we flesh out the family resemblances among analytic feminists it is\nimportant to remember that these resemblances include not only\nsubstantive positions, but also styles of presentation and other\npractices. Further, as we have already noted in the first two\nsections, analytic feminists share resemblances with others in their\neven larger \u201cfamily\u201d that includes both non-analytic\nfeminists and nonfeminist analytic philosophers. A large and diverse\nfamily indeed!\n",
