    "main_text": "The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition || Integration\n1.1 Integration\n\nThe Integration model treats philosophy and Christian theology as\ncontinuous, integrated activities. On this model, rational inquiry\nabout God does not sharply divide into discrete activities called\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d. Instead, there is\nsimply the single, continuous intellectual task of trying to\nunderstand God, and all things in relation to God, using all of\none\u2019s intellectual resources. This account does not deny the\nimportance of faith or revelation to the Christian intellectual life;\nrather, it denies that faith and revelation properly belong to a\nseparate activity called \u201ctheology\u201d in distinction from\nanother activity called \u201cphilosophy\u201d. According to this\nview, when we engage in rational inquiry of any sort, we should draw\non every available source of knowledge that is relevant to that\ninquiry. So when we engage in rational inquiry about Christian topics,\nwe should draw on scripture, Church tradition, and other such sources\nof knowledge, whether we call the resulting inquiry\n\u201ctheology\u201d, \u201cphilosophy\u201d, or something else.\nTo do anything else would be to hobble our inquiry from the outset,\naccording to the Integration view.\n\nThis account of the relationship between philosophy and theology has\ndeep roots in the Christian tradition. Before the rise of the medieval\nuniversity, it was the dominant view, and it still has contemporary\ndefenders (discussed below). Patristic thinkers did not typically\ndescribe their own intellectual work as \u201ctheology\u201d. The\nterm \u201ctheology\u201d already had a fixed meaning in late\nantiquity. It meant \u201cpoetic speech about the gods\u201d, and\nwas in general associated with pagan story-telling and myth-making:\nthe great \u201ctheologians\u201d, were Homer and Hesiod. Even\nthough Christian thinkers like Gregory of Nazianzus sometimes acquired\nthe honorific title \u201cTheologian\u201d, they did so because of\nthe lyrical and poetic quality of their writing, not because they\nwrote about Christian doctrinal topics (Zachhuber 2020; McGinn\n2008).\n\nThe general term that early Christian thinkers used to describe their\nintellectual work was, more often than not, simply\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cChristian philosophy\u201d.\nChristianity was regarded as the \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d over\nagainst the false philosophical schools associated with pagan thought.\n(See Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 8.1; Clement of\nAlexandria, Stromata 1.28.3, 1.28.4 1.80.5,6; Augustine of\nHippo, Against Julian, 4.14.72.) This usage is consistent\nwith Pierre Hadot\u2019s (1995) claim that in Greco-Roman antiquity\nphilosophy was understood as a comprehensive way of life.\nChristianity, on this model, is analogous to a philosophical school,\nin Hadot\u2019s sense (see also Zachhuber 2020).\n\nThe Integration account continued to be the default account of the\nrelationship between philosophy and theology into the early Medieval\nperiod. Before the rise of scholasticism in the great Western\nuniversities, there was no sharp distinction between philosophy and\ntheology. Anselm of Canterbury, for example, certainly has the concept\nof a line of inquiry that proceeds using reason alone, without\nappealing to revelation, but he does not label that inquiry\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in distinction from \u201ctheology\u201d.\nMoreover, in his own writings, he frequently blurs any such\ndistinction, as he seamlessly moves between rational reflection and\nargument, on the one hand, to prayers, meditations, and exclamations\nof thanksgiving, on the other (e.g., Proslogion 1\u20134).\nLike many premodern Christian thinkers, Anselm also held that\nintellectual inquiry and personal holiness are linked, so that the\nmore one grows in Christian virtue, the more rationally one is able to\nthink about God (Adams 2004; Sweeney, 2011). This understanding of\ninquiry and virtue is also a hallmark of the Integration account.\n",
