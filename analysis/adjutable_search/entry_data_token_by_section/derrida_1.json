    "main_text": "\u201cThe Incorruptibles\u201d\n2. \u201cThe Incorruptibles\u201d\n\nAs we noted, Derrida became famous at the end of the 1960s, with the\npublication of three books in 1967. At this time, other great books\nappear: Foucault\u2019s Les mots et les choses (The\nOrder of Things is the English language title) in 1966;\nDeleuze\u2019s Difference and Repetition in 1968. It is hard\nto deny that the philosophy publications of this epoch indicate that\nwe have before us a kind of philosophical moment (a moment perhaps\ncomparable to the moment of German Idealism at the beginning of the\n19th century). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous calls this\ngeneration of French philosophers \u201cthe incorruptibles.\u201d In\nthe last interview Derrida gave (to Le Monde on August 19,\n2004), he provided an interpretation of \u201cthe\nincorruptibles\u201d: \u201cBy means of metonymy, I call this\napproach [of \u2018the incorruptibles\u2019] an intransigent, even\nincorruptible, ethos of writing and thinking \u2026,\nwithout concession even to philosophy, and not letting public opinion,\nthe media, or the phantasm of an intimidating readership frighten or\nforce us into simplifying or repressing. Hence the strict taste for\nrefinement, paradox, and aporia.\u201d Derrida proclaims that today,\nmore than ever, \u201cthis predilection [for paradox and aporia]\nremains a requirement.\u201d How are we to understand this\nrequirement, this predilection for \u201crefinement, paradox, and\naporia\u201d?\n\nIn an essay from 1998, \u201cTypewriter Ribbon,\u201d Derrida\ninvestigates the relation of confession to archives. But, before he\nstarts the investigation (which will concern primarily Rousseau), he\nsays, \u201cLet us put in place the premises of our question.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWill this be possible for us? Will we one day be able\nto, and in a single gesture, to join the thinking of the event to the\nthinking of the machine? Will we be able to think, what is called\nthinking, at one and the same time, both what is happening (we call\nthat an event) and the calculable programming of an automatic\nrepetition (we call that a machine). For that, it would be necessary\nin the future (but there will be no future except on this condition)\nto think both the event and the machine as two compatible or even\nin-dissociable concepts. Today they appear to us to be\nantinomic\u201d (Without Alibi, p. 72). These two concepts\nappear to us to be antinomic because we conceive an event as something\nsingular and non-repeatable. Moreover, Derrida associates this\nsingularity to the living. The living being undergoes a sensation and\nthis sensation (an affect or feeling for example) gets inscribed in\norganic material. The idea of an inscription leads Derrida to the\nother pole. The machine that inscribes is based in repetition;\n\u201cIt is destined, that is, to reproduce impassively,\nimperceptibly, without organ or organicity, the received commands. In\na state of anaesthesis, it would obey or command a calculable program\nwithout affect or auto-affection, like an indifferent automaton\u201d\n(Without Alibi, p. 73). The automatic nature of the inorganic\nmachine is not the spontaneity attributed to organic life. It is easy\nto see the incompatibility of the two concepts: organic, living\nsingularity (the event) and inorganic, dead universality (mechanical\nrepetition). Derrida says that, if we can make these two concepts\ncompatible, \u201cyou can bet not only (and I insist on not only)\nwill one have produced a new logic, an unheard of conceptual form. In\ntruth, against the background and at the horizon of our present\npossibilities, this new figure would resemble a monster.\u201d The\nmonstrosity of this paradox between event and repetition announces,\nperhaps, another kind of thinking, an impossible thinking: the\nimpossible event (there must be resemblance to the past which cancels\nthe singularity of the event) and the only possible event (since any\nevent in order to be event worthy of its name must be singular and\nnon-resembling). Derrida concludes this discussion by saying:\n\u201cTo give up neither the event nor the machine, to subordinate\nneither one to the other, neither to reduce one to the other: this is\nperhaps a concern of thinking that has kept a certain number of\n\u2018us\u2019 working for the last few decades\u201d (Without\nAlibi, p. 74). This \u201cus\u201d refers to Derrida\u2019s\ngeneration of thinkers: \u201cthe incorruptibles.\u201d What Derrida\nsays here defines a general project which consists in trying to\nconceive the relation between machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity neither as a relation of externality\n(external as in Descartes\u2019s two substance or as in\nPlatonism\u2019s two worlds) nor as a relation of homogeneity (any\nform of reductionism would suffice here to elucidate a homogeneous\nrelation). Instead, the relation is one in which the elements are\ninternal to one another and yet remain heterogeneous. Derrida\u2019s\nfamous term \u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d (to which we shall return\nbelow) refers to this relation in which machine-like repeatability is\ninternal to irreplaceable singularity and yet the two remain\nheterogeneous to one another.\n\nOf course, Cixous intends with the word \u201cincorruptibles\u201d\nthat the generation of French philosophers who came of age in the\nSixties, what they wrote and did, will never decay, will remain\nendlessly new and interesting. This generation will remain pure. But,\nthe term is particularly appropriate for Derrida, since his thought\nconcerns precisely the idea of purity and therefore contamination.\nContamination, in Derrida, implies that an opposition consisting in\ntwo pure poles separated by an indivisible line never exists. In other\nwords, traditionally (going back to Plato\u2019s myths but also\nChristian theology), we think that there was an original pure state of\nbeing (direct contact with the forms or the Garden of Eden) which\naccidentally became corrupt. In contrast, Derrida tries to show that\nno term or idea or reality is ever pure in this way; one term always\nand necessarily \u201cinfects\u201d the other.\n\nNevertheless, for Derrida, a kind of purity remains as a value. In his\n1992 The Monolingualism of the Other, Derrida speaks of his\n\u201cshameful intolerance\u201d for anything but the purity of the\nFrench language (as opposed to French contaminated with English words\nlike \u201cle weekend\u201d). Derrida says, \u201cI still do not\ndare admit this compulsive demand for a purity of language except\nwithin boundaries of which I can be sure: this demand is neither\nethical, political, nor social. It does not inspire any judgment in\nme. It simply exposes me to suffering when someone, who can be myself,\nhappens to fall short of it. I suffer even further when I catch myself\nor am caught \u2018red-handed\u2019 in the act. \u2026 Above all,\nthis demand remains so inflexible that it sometimes goes beyond the\ngrammatical point of view, it even neglects \u2018style\u2019 in\norder to bow to a more hidden rule, to \u2018listen\u2019 to the\ndomineering murmur of an order which someone in me flatters himself to\nunderstand, even in situations where he would be the only one to do\nso, in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the idiom, the final\ntarget: a last will of the language, in sum, a law of the language\nthat would entrust itself only to me. \u2026I therefore admit to a\npurity which is not very pure. Anything but a purism. It is, at least,\nthe only impure \u2018purity\u2019 for which I dare confess a\ntaste\u201d (Monolingualism, p. 46). Derrida\u2019s taste\nfor purity is such that he seeks the idioms of a language. The idioms\nof a language are what make the language singular. An idiom is so pure\nthat we seem unable to translate it out of that language. For example,\nDerrida always connects the French idiom \u201cil faut,\u201d\n\u201cit is necessary,\u201d to \u201cune faute,\u201d \u201ca\nfault\u201d and to \u201cun d\u00e9faut,\u201d \u201ca\ndefect\u201d; but we cannot make this linguistic connection between\nnecessity and a fault in English. This idiom seems to belong alone to\nFrench; it seems as though it cannot be shared; so far, there is no\nbabble of several languages in the one sole French language. And yet,\neven within one language, an idiom can be shared. Here is another\nFrench idiom: \u201cil y va d\u2019un certain pas.\u201d Even in\nFrench, this idiom can be \u201ctranslated.\u201d On the one hand,\nif one takes the \u201cil y va\u201d literally, one has a sentence\nabout movement to a place (\u201cy\u201d: there) at a certain pace\n(\u201cun certain pas\u201d: a certain step). On the other hand, if\none takes the \u201cil y va\u201d idiomatically (\u201cil y\nva\u201d: what is at issue), one has a sentence (perhaps more\nphilosophical) about the issue of negation (\u201cun certain\npas\u201d: \u201ca certain kind of not\u201d). This undecidability\nin how to understand an idiom within one sole language indicates that,\nalready in French, in the one French language, there is already\ntranslation and, as Derrida would say, \u201cBabelization.\u201d\nTherefore, for Derrida, \u201ca pure language\u201d means a language\nwhose terms necessarily include a plurality of senses that cannot be\nreduced down to one sense that is the proper meaning. In other words,\nthe taste for purity in Derrida is a taste for impropriety and\ntherefore impurity. The value of purity in Derrida means that anyone\nwho conceives language in terms of proper or pure meanings must be\ncriticized.\n",
