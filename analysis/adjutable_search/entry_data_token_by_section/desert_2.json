    "main_text": "The Justification of Desert Claims\n3. The Justification of Desert Claims\n\nA number of related questions have been discussed under the general\ntitle of \u2018the justification of desert claims.\u2019 Some\napparently take the question about justification to be a question\nabout epistemic justification (see, for example, McLeod 1995,\n89). If we understand the question in this way, we may want to know\nhow \u2013 if at all \u2013 a person can be epistemically justified\nin believing that (for example) hard work is a desert base for reward.\nOthers take the question about justification in a different way. They\ntake it to be a question about explanation. Consider again\nthe question about the justification of the claim that hard work makes\nus deserve reward. On this second interpretation, the question is:\nwhat explains the fact that hard work is a desert base for reward?\nOthers speak in this context of \u201cnormative force\u201d (see,\nfor example, Sher 1987, xi). They seem to be concerned with a question\nabout what explains the fact that when someone deserves something, it\nis obligatory for others to provide it, or good that it be provided.\nStill others may phrase the question by appeal to concepts of\ngrounding or foundation. They may ask what grounds\nthe fact that those who work hard deserve rewards. Still others write\na bit more vaguely about the analysis of desert claims (see,\nfor example, Feinberg 1970). \n\nThere is a further distinction to be noted. Some who write about the\njustification of desert claims seem to think that it is specific\ndesert claims about particular individuals that call for\njustification. Thus, they might ask for a justification of the claim\nthat Jones deserves a $100 bonus for having worked extra hard over the\nholiday weekend. Others apparently think that what calls for\njustification is a more general claim about desert bases and deserts.\nThey might ask for a justification of the claim that hard\nwork is a desert base for financial reward. \n\nWe will formulate the discussion in the admittedly vague idiom of\njustification of claims about desert bases and deserts. But\nas we understand the question, it can be explicated in this way:\nsuppose someone claims that in general the possession of some desert\nbase, DB, makes people deserve a certain desert, D. If challenged, how\ncould the maker of such a claim support his claim? How could he argue\nfor his assertion? What facts about DB and D could he cite in order to\nshow that he was right \u2013 the possession of DB does make someone\ndeserve D? \n\nSome who write on this topic are \u201cmonists\u201d about\njustification; they apparently assume that there is a single feature\nthat will serve in all cases to justify desert claims. Others are\n\u201cpluralists.\u201d They defend the idea that desert claims fall\ninto different categories, and that each category has its own\ndistinctive sort of justification (see, for example, Feinberg 1970,\nSher 1987, and Lamont 1994). We first consider some monist views. \n\nSome popular views about the justification of desert claims are based\non the idea that such claims can be justified by appeal to\nconsiderations about the values of consequences. Sidgwick seems to be\nthinking of something like this in The Methods of Ethics\nwhere he mentions \u2018the utilitarian interpretation of\nDesert.\u2019 He describes this by saying: \u2018when a man is said\nto deserve reward for any services to society, the meaning is that it\nis expedient to reward him, in order that he and others may be induced\nto render similar services by the expectation of similar\nrewards\u2019 (1907, 284, note 1). (It is not clear that Sidgwick\nmeans to defend this view about desert; he seems to be offering it as\nan account of what a determinist would have to say.) \n\nSidgwick\u2019s statement has direct implications only for cases in\nwhich what is deserved is some sort of reward and the desert base of\nthis desert is some sort of \u2018service to society.\u2019 As a\nresult, it is not clear that this idea about justification, taken\nsimply by itself, has any direct relevance to cases in which someone\ndeserves punishment, or compensation, or a prize for outstanding\nperformance, or a grade for academic work. \n\nAccording to a natural extension of the view that Sidgwick mentioned,\na claim to the effect that someone deserves something, D, in virtue of\nhis possession of some feature, DB, is justified by pointing out that\ngiving the person D in virtue of his possession of DB would have high\nutility. \n\nWhile there surely are some cases in which giving someone what he\ndeserves would have high utility, this link between desert and utility\nis just as frequently absent. To see this, consider a case in which a\nvery popular person has engaged in some bad behavior for which he\ndeserves punishment \u2013 but suppose in addition that no one\nbelieves he is guilty. If he were punished for having done the nasty\ndeed, there would be an outpouring of anger from all of the popular\nperson\u2019s fans and friends who think he has been framed. If our\ninterest were in producing an outcome with high utility, we would have\nto refrain from punishing him. But in spite of that, since in fact he\ndid do the nasty deed, he does deserve the punishment. \n\nIn other cases, giving a person some benefit might have good results\neven though the person does not deserve to receive those benefits. To\nsee this, imagine that a crazed maniac threatens to murder a dozen\nhostages unless he is given a half-hour of prime time TV to air his\ngrievances. Giving him this airtime might have high utility \u2013 it\nmight be the best thing for those in charge to do in the circumstances\n\u2013 but at the same time we might feel that the maniac does not\ndeserve it. \n\nAnother serious problem with the consequentialist approach is brought\nout by consideration of the famous telishment case, also known as\n\u2018The Small Southern Town.\u2019 The example was presented by\nCarritt in his Ethical and Political Thinking, but gained\ngreat notoriety as a result of being quoted at length in Rawls\u2019s\n\u2018Two Concepts of Rules\u2019 (Rawls 1955). Here is the passage\nfrom Carritt:\n\n\u2026if some kind of very cruel crime becomes common, and none of\nthe criminals can be caught, it might be highly expedient, as an\nexample, to hang an innocent man, if a charge against him could be so\nframed that he were universally thought guilty\u2026 (Carritt 1947,\n65)\n\n\nIn this example, punishing an innocent person has high utility because\nit would have great deterrent effect. But the victim of the punishment\ndoes not deserve punishment \u2013 after all, he is innocent. This\nhighlights an important fact about desert and utility: sometimes it\ncan be expedient to give someone a reward or a punishment that he or\nshe does not deserve. \n\nIt appears then that the consequentialist approach confronts\noverwhelming objections. Sometimes deserved treatment is expedient;\nsometimes it is not. Sometimes undeserved treatment is expedient;\nsometimes it is not. As a result, appeals to the utility of giving\nsomeone some benefit or burden cannot justify the claim that the\nperson deserves that sort of treatment. \n\nA second approach to the justification of desert claims is based on\nsome ideas concerning institutions. There are several different ways\nin which this \u201cinstitutional justification\u201d can be\ndeveloped. (Our discussion in this section has benefited enormously\nfrom McLeod 1999b.) \n\nFirst, some background: an institution may be identified by a\nsystem of rules that define positions, moves, penalties, rewards, etc.\nIn some cases the rules of an institution are carefully written down\nand perhaps made a matter of legislation. The system of taxation in\nsome country might be a good example. In other cases the rules of an\ninstitution are not explicitly formalized. An example might be the\nsystem of etiquette governing the writing, sending, replying to, etc.\nof wedding invitations. It is not easy to say what makes an\ninstitution \u201cexist\u201d in a society. That is a puzzle best\nleft to the sociologists. \n\nWe may also need to assume that when people set up institutions, they\ndo so with some intention. They are trying to achieve something; or\nmore likely, they are trying to achieve several different things.\nMaybe different people have different aims. We can say \u2013\nsomewhat vaguely \u2013 that the point of an institution is\nthe main goal or aim that people have in establishing or maintaining\nthat institution. \n\nA person may be governed by some institution even if he does\nnot like it, or does not endorse it. Thus, for example, suppose a\ncriminal justice system exists in a certain state. Suppose some\nmiscreant lives in that state and has been charged with some crime.\nSuppose he is found guilty in a duly established court of law and is\nsentenced to ten years in prison. He is governed by the rules of the\njudicial system whether he likes it or not. To be governed by an\ninstitution one must live (or perhaps be a visitor) in the state or\nsociety where the institution exists, and one must somehow \u201cfall\nunder\u201d the rules. Those rules must \u201capply to\u201d the\nindividual. Again, these are tricky sociological notions, not easily\nspelled out. \n\nSome philosophers have said things that suggest that it is possible to\njustify a desert claim by identifying a currently existing, actual\ninstitution according to which the deserver is entitled to the desert.\nWe can state this idea a bit more clearly: \n\nAID: The claim that a person, S, deserves something, D, on the basis\nof the fact that he has a feature, DB, is justifiable if and only if\nthere is some social institution, I; I exists in S\u2019s society; S\nis governed by I; according to the rules of I, those who have DB are\nto receive D; S has DB.\n\n\nThis \u201cactual institutional\u201d account of desert is almost\nuniversally\n rejected.[2]\n There are several independent sources of difficulty. Most of these\nemerge from the requirement that a desert claim is justifiable always\nand only when there is an appropriate actual social\ninstitution. This produces a number of devastating objections. Suppose\na thoroughly decent person has suffered a number of serious\nmisfortunes. He deserves a change of luck; he deserves some good luck\nfor a change. Suppose he lives in a country where there is no social\ninstitution that supplies compensatory benefits to those who have had\nbad luck. If AID were true, it would be impossible to justify the\nclaim that he deserves it. \n\nAn equally serious objection arises from the fact that some of the\ninstitutions that actually exist are morally indefensible. Let us\nimagine a thoroughly horrible social institution \u2013 slavery.\nSuppose some unfortunate individual is governed by that institution.\nSuppose the institution contains rules that say that slaves who are\nstrong and healthy shall be required to work without pay in the cotton\nfields. Suppose this individual is strong and healthy. Consider the\nclaim that he deserves to be required to work in the fields without\npay in virtue of the fact that he is strong and healthy. AID implies\nthat this desert claim is justified. That is as preposterous as it is\noffensive. \n\nThe general point: we must not lose sight of the fundamental\ndifference between entitlement and desert. AID seems\nto confuse these. It seems to say that you deserve something if and\nonly if you are entitled to it by the rules of an actual institution.\nSince there are bad institutions, and cases in which desert arises in\nthe absence of institutions, this is clearly a mistake. \n\nWe can deal with all of these objections by altering the institutional\naccount of justification. Instead of making the justification of a\ndesert claim depend upon the existence of an actual social\ninstitution, we can make it depend upon the rules that would be\ncontained in some ideal social institution. The main change is that we\nno longer require that the social institution exists. We require\ninstead that it be an ideal institution \u2013 an institution that\nwould be in some way excellent or preferable. Then we can attempt to\njustify desert claims by saying that the deservers would be entitled\nto those deserts by the rules of an ideal social institution. \n\nWe can state the thesis this way:\n\nIID: The claim that a person, S, deserves something, D, on the basis\nof the fact that he has a feature, DB, is justifiable if and only if\nthere is some possible social institution, I; I would be ideal for\nS\u2019s society; S would be governed by I; according to the rules of\nI, those who have DB are to receive D; S has DB.\n\n\nBefore we can evaluate this proposal, we have to explain in greater\ndetail what makes a possible institution \u201cideal\u201d for a\nsociety. We might try to define ideality by saying that an ideal\ninstitution is one that would distribute benefits and burdens to\npeople precisely in accord with their deserts. With this account of\nideality in place, IID generates quite a few correct results.\nUnfortunately, it would be unhelpful in the present context. After\nall, the aim here is to explain how desert claims can be justified.\nThis account would explain desert by appeal to ideal institutions, and\nthen explain ideal institutions by appeal to desert. \n\nFollowing the rule utilitarians, we could attempt to define ideality\nby saying that a possible institution is ideal for a society if and\nonly if having it as the society\u2019s institutional way of\nachieving its point would produce more utility than would the having\nof any alternative institution. This yields a form of the\ninstitutional approach that seems importantly similar to the\nconsequentialist approach already discussed. \n\nUnfortunately, with this conception of ideality in place, the proposal\nseems to inherit some of the defects of the simpler consequentialist\napproach. It implies, for example, that if it is possible for there to\nbe a seriously unfair but nevertheless utility maximizing institution,\nthen people would deserve the burdens allocated to them by the rules\nof that institution, even if it were not in place. \n\nA further difficulty arises in connection with actual but not\noptimific institutions. Suppose, for example, the utility maximizing\nice-skating institution would have rules specifying that in order to\nwin the gold medal, a competitor must perform a 7 minute free program;\na 6 minute program of required figures; and that all contestants must\nwear regulation team uniforms consisting of full length trousers and\nmatching long-sleeved team shirts. Suppose in fact that this\ninstitution is not in place in Nancy\u2019s society. Suppose instead\nthat the de facto institution contains some slightly different but\nstill fairly reasonable rules for ice-skating competitions. Suppose\nNancy abides by all the relevant extant rules and is declared the\nwinner in a competition. She is entitled to the gold medal by the\nactual rules. It may seem, in such a case, that her claim to deserve\nthe medal would be justified. But since she would not be entitled to\nit by the rules of the ideal institution, IID implies that it is\nimpossible to justify her claim that she deserves the medal by virtue\nof her performance here tonight. \n\nIt appears, then, that difficulties confront the attempt to justify\ndesert claims by appeal to claims about the entitlements created by\ninstitutions, actual or ideal. \n\nSome philosophers have drawn attention to alleged connections between\ndesert claims and facts about \u201cappraising attitudes\u201d or\n\u201cresponsive attitudes\u201d (see, for example, Feinberg 1970).\nCommentators have understood these philosophers to have been defending\nthe idea that desert claims can be justified by appeal to facts about\nappraising attitudes. Some have said, for example, that David Miller\ndefended a view of this sort in his Social Justice (1976).\nWhile there may be debate about whether Miller actually intended to be\ndefending such a view, it is worthwhile to consider it. (In the\ndiscussion that follows we are indebted to McLeod 1995 and McLeod\n2013.) \n\nWe need first to understand what is meant by \u2018appraising\nattitude.\u2019 \n\nAdmiration, approval, and gratitude are typically cited as examples of\n\u201cpositive\u201d appraising attitudes. In each case, if a person\nhas such an attitude toward someone, he has that attitude in virtue of\nsome feature that he takes the person to have. Suppose, for example,\nthat you admire someone; then you must admire her for something\nshe is or something she did. Maybe she worked hard; or wrote a\ngood paper; or can run very fast; or is able to play the violin\nbeautifully. Similarly for the other positive appraising attitudes.\n\n\nDisapproval, resentment, contempt, \u201cthinking ill of,\u201d and\ncondemnation may be cited as examples of \u201cnegative\u201d\nappraising attitudes. They are similar to the positive attitudes in\nthis respect, if you disapprove of someone, then you must disapprove\nof him for something he is or something he did. Maybe he\nplagiarized a paper; maybe he is totally out of shape; maybe he is\nutterly talentless. \n\nMiller says that if we did not have these attitudes, \u2018we would\nnot and could not use the concept of desert\u2019 (1976, 89). He also\nsays that the range of possible desert bases coincides with the range\nof bases for appraising attitudes. You cannot deserve something on the\nbasis of your possession of a property, DB, unless we could have an\nappraising attitude toward you on the basis of your possession of DB.\nBut what is most important for our present purposes is that, according\nto Miller, \u2018the existence of these appraising attitudes makes\nintelligible the connection between a desert judgment and its\nbasis\u2019 (89). Some have understood Miller to be claiming that\nsomething about these appraising attitudes provides the answer to our\nquestion about the justification of desert claims. \n\nA certain appraising attitude may seem appropriate to a desert claim.\nFor example, suppose a person feels strong approval (a positive\nappraising attitude) of a subject in virtue of his heroic action. The\nattitude would be appropriate to the claim that the hero deserves a\nreward for his heroism. On the other hand, if someone feels contempt\n(a negative appraising attitude) for a person in virtue of his\ncowardice, then this attitude would be appropriate to the claim that\nthe coward deserves some sort of penalty. On one possible view,\nwhether a desert judgment is justifiable depends upon whether the\nperson who makes that judgment has an appraising attitude that is\nappropriate to the desert claim. \n\nThis view (presumably not Miller\u2019s) is clearly confused. Suppose\nthe leader of a terrorist gang claims that a member of his gang\ndeserves respect for having set off a suicide bomb in an elementary\nschool. Suppose the leader has great admiration for this the gang\nmember precisely because he set off the bomb. On the current proposal,\nsince the leader in fact has a positive appraising attitude toward the\nmember, his desert claim is justified. That cannot be right. \n\nThe difficulty cannot be resolved by appealing to the reactions of the\ncommunity. It is easy enough to imagine a case in which the\noverwhelming majority of the bomber\u2019s community admire him for\ndestroying the elementary school. Surely, however, no matter how many\nof his compatriots admire him for doing this deed, the claim that he\ndeserves admiration for having done it is still not justified. \n\nInstead of appealing to facts about the appraising attitudes that\nothers in fact have, we might consider a different question: what sort\nof appraising attitude would be fitting for others to have in virtue\nof the fact that he has committed this deed? If it would be fitting\nfor others to admire him for bombing the school, then he deserves\nadmiration. If it would be fitting for others to hold him in contempt\nfor bombing the school, then he deserves contempt. \n\nIn general, then, we might say that the claim that S deserves a\ncertain benefit (burden) in virtue of having done X is justified if\nand only if it would be fitting for observers to have a positive\n(negative) appraising attitude toward S in virtue of his having done\nX. \n\nThis proposal seems misguided for several reasons. First, it seems to\nbe circular. It purports to explain the justification of desert claims\nby appeal to claims about what appraising attitude would be\n\u201cfitting.\u201d But to say that it would be fitting for someone\nto receive a certain benefit is dangerously close to saying that he\ndeserves to receive it. In this form the proposal seems circular. \n\nFurthermore, it appears that there are cases in which a person\ndeserves something but in which no appraising attitude seems to be\nfitting. Suppose, for example, that an abandoned child is in need of\nmedical care and nurturance. The fact that the child is sick does not\nmake it appropriate for onlookers to admire her or to condemn her. It\ndoes not call for any \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d\nappraising attitude. Nevertheless, the claim that the child deserves\nmedical care and nurturance in virtue of her need might be justified.\nThis objection presents a genuine difficulty only if every appraising\nattitude is a favorable or an unfavorable attitude. If we assume that\npity, or compassion, is also an appraising attitude, the problem\nmentioned here will not arise.\n\nIn his (1970) Feinberg hints at a different way in which appraising\nattitudes might figure in the justification of desert claims. Feinberg\nstarts by noting that \u2018reasonable men naturally entertain\ncertain responsive attitudes toward various actions, qualities, and\nachievements.\u2019 Those who engage in the actions or manifest the\nqualities thereby deserve to be the subjects of the responsive\nattitudes. Going further, we can say that various forms of treatment\n\u2013 punishments, rewards, prizes, etc. \u2013 are the customary\nway of expressing the natural responsive attitudes. When such forms of\ntreatment are in this way the customary and natural ways of expressing\nthe attitudes, then those who engage in the action or manifest the\nquality deserve, in a derived way, to receive the treatment. The\nsuggestion, then, is that in such cases the claim that someone\ndeserves D on the basis of his possession of DB can be justified by\npointing out that giving D is the conventional way of expressing the\nresponsive attitude that reasonable men entertain toward those with\nDB. \n\nIf understood in the suggested way, this account would rely on some\nproblematic assumptions about the responsive attitudes that\n\u2018reasonable men naturally entertain.\u2019 We might well doubt\nwhether all such men invariably entertain those attitudes in cases\nwhere the recipients deserve to be their subject. In any case where\nonly some reasonable men entertain the attitudes, it would be\nimpossible to justify the associated desert claims. On the other hand,\nif we required merely that some reasonable men entertain the attitudes\nin question, then it would become far too easy to justify dubious\ndesert claims. Furthermore, it would make it possible for there to be\ncases in which someone both deserves a certain treatment and also\ndeserves not to get that treatment. \n\nThe details of the appraising attitudes approach remain controversial.\n\n\nA few philosophers \u2013 including George Sher (1987) and Julian\nLamont (1994) \u2013 said things that suggest a pluralistic approach\nto the question about the justification of desert claims. On this\nview, there are several different \u201cexternal values\u201d;\ndifferent values would be relevant in different cases; different\ndesert claims would be justifiable by appeal to different external\nvalues. Thus, for example, consider the claim that you deserve a\nreward for having saved a life. The external value in this case might\nbe some combination of the value of courage and the alleged value of\nhuman life. Consider a different case in which someone claims that you\ndeserve a high grade for having done outstanding work in a course. In\nthis case, the external value might be the value of academic\nachievement. In every case, a desert claim \u2013 if it can be\njustified at all \u2013 can be justified by pointing out that giving\nthe deserver the desert would properly respect the associated external\nvalue. A full exposition of this approach would require a detailed\naccount of what makes a certain external value be relevant to a desert\nclaim; it would also require a detailed account of what is meant by\nsaying that some action would \u201cproperly respect\u201d some\nexternal value. \n",
