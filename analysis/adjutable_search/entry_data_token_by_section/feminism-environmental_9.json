    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Characterization of Ecofeminist Philosophy\n3.1 Characterization of Ecofeminist Philosophy\nFrench feminist Fran\u00e7oise d'Eaubonne coined the term\n\u201cecological feminisme\u201d in 1974 to call attention\nto women's potential to bring about an ecological revolution.\nInitially, \u201cecofeminism\u201d referred generically to a wide\nvariety of \u201cwomen-nature\u201d connections, often based in\ndifferent disciplinary perspectives (such as History, Literary\nCriticism, Political Science, Sociology, and Theology). This is\nimportant because ecofeminism did not emerge as a\ndistinctly philosophical position until the late 1980s and\nearly- to mid 1990s.\nFor purposes of this essay, a general, common-denominator\ncharacterization of \u201cecofeminist philosophy\u201d is that it:\n(1) explores the nature of the connections between the unjustified\ndominations of women and nature; (2) critiques male-biased Western\ncanonical philosophical views (assumptions, concepts, claims,\ndistinctions, positions, theories) about women and nature; and (3)\ncreates alternatives and solutions to such male-biased views.\nA note about terminology is relevant here. Many ecofeminist\nphilosophers distinguish between the oppression of women and\nthe (unjustified) domination of nature. They do so on the\ngrounds that only those beings that have such characteristics as\nrationality, cognitive capacity, or sentiency can be oppressed. In\nWestern contexts, nonhuman natural entities such as rocks, plants,\nrivers, or (generically) nature are presumed to not have any such\ncharacteristics. As such, unlike women, they cannot be oppressed\n(although they can be unjustly dominated). What about nonhuman\nanimals? Many ecofeminist philosophers include animals, especially\ndomesticated animals, among those beings that are capable of being\noppressed, but deny that nature has this capability. They talk about\nthe oppression of animals (but not of nature). For purposes of this\nessay, the word \u201coppression\u201d will not be applied to\nnature; its applicability to animals will be left an open question.\nAccordingly, for example, ecofeminist philosophical perspectives on\nwomen-nature connections will not refer to \u201cthe oppression of\nnature\u201d, \u201cthe twin oppressions of women and nature,\u201c\nor \u201cthe mutually reinforcing oppressions of women and\nnature\u201d. However, they will refer to the unjustified dominations\nof women, nonhuman animals, and nature.\n",
