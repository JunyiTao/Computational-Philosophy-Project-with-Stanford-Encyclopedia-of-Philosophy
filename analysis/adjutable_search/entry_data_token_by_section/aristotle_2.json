    "main_text": "Phainomena and the Endoxic Method\n3. Phainomena and the Endoxic Method\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s basic approach to philosophy is best grasped initially by\nway of contrast. Whereas Descartes seeks to place philosophy and\nscience on firm foundations by subjecting all knowledge claims to a\nsearing methodological doubt, Aristotle begins with the conviction\nthat our perceptual and cognitive faculties are basically dependable,\nthat they for the most part put us into direct contact with the\nfeatures and divisions of our world, and that we need not dally with\nsceptical postures before engaging in substantive philosophy.\nAccordingly, he proceeds in all areas of inquiry in the manner of a\nmodern-day natural scientist, who takes it for granted that progress\nfollows the assiduous application of a well-trained mind and so, when\npresented with a problem, simply goes to work.  When he goes to work,\nAristotle begins by considering how the world appears, reflecting on\nthe puzzles those appearances throw up, and reviewing what has been\nsaid about those puzzles to date. These methods comprise his twin\nappeals to phainomena and the endoxic method. \n\n\n           \nThese two methods reflect in different ways Aristotle\u2019s deepest\nmotivations for doing philosophy in the first place. \u201cHuman\nbeings began to do philosophy,\u201d he says, \u201ceven as they do\nnow, because of wonder, at first because they wondered about the\nstrange things right in front of them, and then later, advancing\nlittle by little, because they came to find greater things\npuzzling\u201d (Met. 982b12). Human beings philosophize,\naccording to Aristotle, because they find aspects of their experience\npuzzling. The sorts of puzzles we encounter in thinking about the\nuniverse and our place within it\u2014aporiai, in\nAristotle\u2019s terminology\u2014tax our understanding and induce us to\nphilosophize.\n\n\n           \nAccording to Aristotle, it behooves us to begin philosophizing by\nlaying out the phainomena, the appearances, or, more\nfully, things appearing to be the case, and then also\ncollecting the endoxa, the credible opinions handed down\nregarding matters we find puzzling. As a typical example, in a\npassage of his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle confronts a\npuzzle of human conduct, the fact that we are apparently sometimes\nakratic or weak-willed. When introducing this puzzle, Aristotle pauses\nto reflect upon a precept governing his approach to many areas of inquiry:\n\n\nAs in other cases, we must set out the appearances\n(phainomena) and run through all the puzzles regarding\nthem. In this way we must prove the credible opinions\n(endoxa) about these sorts of experiences\u2014ideally, all\nthe credible opinions, but if not all, then most of them, those which\nare the most important. For if the objections are answered and\nthe credible opinions remain, we shall have an adequate proof.\n(EN 1145b2\u20137)\n\n\nScholars dispute concerning the degree to which Aristotle regards\nhimself as beholden to the credible opinions (endoxa) he\nrecounts and the basic appearances (phainomena) to which\n he\n appeals.[6] \n Of course, since the endoxa will sometimes conflict with one\nanother, often precisely because the phainomena generate\naporiai, or puzzles, it is not always possible to respect them\nin their entirety. So, as a group they must be re-interpreted and\nsystematized, and, where that does not suffice, some must be rejected\noutright. It is in any case abundantly clear that Aristotle is\nwilling to abandon some or all of the endoxa and\nphainomena whenever science or philosophy demands that he do\nso (Met. 1073b36, 1074b6; PA 644b5; EN\n1145b2\u201330).\n\n\nStill, his attitude towards phainomena does betray a\npreference to conserve as many appearances as is practicable in a given\ndomain\u2014not because the appearances are unassailably accurate, but\nrather because, as he supposes, appearances tend to track the\ntruth.   We are outfitted with sense organs and powers of\nmind so structured as to put us into contact with the world and\nthus to provide us with data regarding its basic constituents and\ndivisions. While our faculties are not infallible, neither are\nthey systematically deceptive or misdirecting. Since\nphilosophy\u2019s aim is truth and much of what appears to us proves\nupon analysis to be correct, phainomena provide both an\nimpetus to philosophize and a check on some of its more extravagant\nimpulses. \n\n\nOf course, it is not always clear what constitutes a\nphainomenon; still less is it clear which phainomenon\nis to be respected in the face of bona fide\ndisagreement. This is in part why Aristotle endorses his second\nand related methodological precept, that we ought to begin\nphilosophical discussions by collecting the most stable and entrenched\nopinions regarding the topic of inquiry handed down to us by our\npredecessors. Aristotle\u2019s term for these privileged views,\nendoxa, is variously rendered as \u2018reputable\nopinions\u2019, \u2018credible opinions\u2019, \u2018entrenched\nbeliefs\u2019, \u2018credible beliefs\u2019, or \u2018common\nbeliefs\u2019.  Each of these translations captures at least part of\nwhat Aristotle intends with this word, but it is important to\nappreciate that it is a fairly technical term for\nhim. An endoxon is the sort of opinion we spontaneously\nregard as reputable or worthy of respect, even if upon reflection we\nmay come to question its veracity. (Aristotle appropriates this term\nfrom ordinary Greek, in which an endoxos is a notable or\nhonourable man, a man of high repute whom we would spontaneously\nrespect\u2014though we might, of course, upon closer inspection, find\ncause to criticize him.)  As he explains his use of the\nterm, endoxa are widely shared opinions, often ultimately\nissuing from those we esteem most: \u2018Endoxa are those\nopinions accepted by everyone, or by the majority, or by the\nwise\u2014and among the wise, by all or most of them, or by those who\nare the most notable and having the highest reputation\u2019\n(Top. 100b21\u201323). Endoxa play a special role\nin Aristotelian philosophy in part because they form a significant\nsub-class of phainomena (EN 1154b3\u20138): because they\nare the privileged opinions we find ourselves unreflectively endorsing\nand reaffirming after some reflection, they themselves come to qualify\nas appearances to be preserved where possible.\n\n\nFor this reason, Aristotle\u2019s method of beginning with the\nendoxa is more than a pious platitude to the effect that it\nbehooves us to mind our superiors. He does think this, as far as\nit goes, but he also maintains, more instructively, that we can be led\nastray by the terms within which philosophical problems are bequeathed\nto us. Very often, the puzzles confronting us were given crisp\nformulations by earlier thinkers and we find them puzzling precisely\nfor that reason. Equally often, however, if we reflect upon the\nterms within which the puzzles are cast, we find a way forward; when a\nformulation of a puzzle betrays an untenable structuring assumption, a\nsolution naturally commends itself. This is why in more abstract\ndomains of inquiry we are likely to find ourselves seeking guidance\nfrom our predecessors even as we call into question their\nways of articulating the problems we are confronting.  \n\n\nAristotle applies his method of running through the\nphainomena and collecting the endoxa widely, in\nnearly every area of his philosophy. To take a typical\nillustration, we find the method clearly deployed in his discussion of\ntime in Physics iv 10\u201314. We begin with a\nphainomenon: we feel sure that time exists\nor at least that time passes. So much is, inescapably,\nhow our world appears: we experience time as passing, as\nunidirectional, as unrecoverable when lost. Yet when we move to\noffer an account of what time might be, we find ourselves\nflummoxed. For guidance, we turn to what has been said about time\nby those who have reflected upon its nature. It emerges directly\nthat both philosophers and natural scientists have raised problems\nabout time. \n\n\nAs Aristotle sets them out, these problems take the form of puzzles,\nor aporiai, regarding whether and if so how time exists\n(Phys. 218a8\u201330). If we say that time is the totality of the\npast, present and future, we immediately find someone objecting that\ntime exists but that the past and future do not. According to the\nobjector, only the present exists. If we retort then that time is\nwhat did exist, what exists at present and\nwhat will exist, then we notice first that our account is\ninsufficient: after all, there are many things which did, do, or will\nexist, but these are things that are in time and so not the\nsame as time itself. We further see that our account already threatens\ncircularity, since to say that something did or will\nexist seems only to say that it existed at an earlier time or\nwill come to exist at a later time. Then again we find\nsomeone objecting to our account that even the notion of the\npresent is troubling. After all, either the present is\nconstantly changing or it remains forever the same. If it remains\nforever the same, then the current present is the same as the present\nof 10,000 years ago; yet that is absurd. If it is constantly changing,\nthen no two presents are the same, in which case a past present must\nhave come into and out of existence before the present present. When?\nEither it went out of existence even as it came into existence, which\nseems odd to say the least, or it went out of existence at some\ninstant after it came into existence, in which case, again, two\npresents must have existed at the same instant. Now, Aristotle does\nnot endorse the claims set out in stating these sorts\nof aporiai; in fact, very often he cannot, because\nsome aporiai qualify as aporiai just because they\ncomprise individually plausible arguments generating incompatible\nconclusions.  They thus serve as springboards to deeper, more\ndemanding analysis. \n\n\nIn general, then, in setting such aporiai, Aristotle does not\nmean to endorse any given endoxon on one side or the\nother. Rather, he thinks that such considerations present credible\npuzzles, reflection upon which may steer us towards a defensible\nunderstanding of the nature of time. In this way, aporiai\nbring into sharp relief the issues requiring attention if progress is\nto be made. Thus, by reflecting upon the aporiai regarding\ntime, we are led immediately to think about duration and divisibility,\nabout\nquanta and continua, and about a variety of\ncategorial questions. That is, if time exists, then what sort of\nthing is it?  Is it the sort of thing which exists absolutely and\nindependently?  Or is it rather the sort of thing which, like a\nsurface, depends upon other things for its existence?  When we\nbegin to address these sorts of questions, we also begin to ascertain\nthe sorts of assumptions at play in the endoxa coming down to\nus regarding the nature of time.   Consequently, when we\ncollect the endoxa and survey them critically, we learn\nsomething about our quarry, in this case about the nature of\ntime\u2014and crucially also something about the constellation of\nconcepts which must be refined if we are to make genuine philosophical\nprogress with respect to it. What holds in the case of time, Aristotle implies, holds generally. This is why he\ncharacteristically begins a philosophical inquiry by presenting the\nphainomena, collecting the endoxa, and running\nthrough the puzzles to which they give rise. \n",
