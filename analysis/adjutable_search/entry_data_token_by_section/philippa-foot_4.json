    "main_text": "Virtue and Morality\n5. Virtue and Morality\n\nIn her treatment of abortion and euthanasia, Foot appeals to virtues\nof charity and justice. It is obvious, then, that the virtues play an\nimportant role in her conception of morality. On Foot\u2019s account,\nthere are three essential features of a virtue: first, a virtue is a\ndisposition of the will; second, it is beneficial either to others, or\nto its possessor as well as to others; third, it is corrective of some\nbad general human tendency.\n\nFoot starts her investigation of the connection between the virtues\nand the will by examining the role of intentions in determining\nsomeone\u2019s character. We evaluate someone\u2019s moral quality,\nshe thinks, primarily by examining his intentions (1978 [VV 4]). Yet,\ngood intentions are not sufficient to demonstrate that someone is\nvirtuous; in the case of charity or benevolence, one can show lack of\ncharity despite our good intentions, in failing to bring about the\nintended good. For example, one can be ignorant of something one\nshould have known, as famously illustrated by Foot with her example of\nfailing to learn basic first aid. Someone who is genuinely benevolent\nwill take the trouble to find out about basic first aid, and because\nsuch knowledge is so easily attained and so generally useful to\nothers, it shows a lack of charity to fail to attain such\nknowledge. Also, Foot points out that failures of performance can\ncount against someone\u2019s claim to possess virtue despite good\nintentions when one\u2019s heart is not in the action. Virtues are\ntherefore also \u2018dispositions of the heart\u2019 according to\nFoot, meaning that we must take the trouble to cultivate the desire to\nact well.  Conversely, virtue par excellence occurs in one\nwho is \u201cprompt and resourceful\u201d in doing good (Ibid.). A\nvirtuous agent will take pleasure in doing good things for others, and\nso for Foot, the will includes our intentions as well as our\n\u2018innermost desires\u2019.\n\nThere are plenty of qualifications to add here. Surely it is not\nalways in our power to effect changes in our emotions and desires; at\nleast, whether it is possible is an open question and subject to\npsychological inquiry (Hursthouse 1999: 113\u2013119). Still, Foot\nhas made a conceptual claim that is important here: we are charitable\nwhen our intentions and desires, to the extent that these are\nunder the control of our will, are such that we can act for the\ngood of others with ease and pleasure. If, due to a psychological\ncondition that is unresponsive to treatment, we cannot take joy in\nhelping others, then this does not count against our possession of\nvirtue. In fact, Foot thinks that such cases increase \u201cthe\nvirtue that is needed if a man is to act well\u201d (1978 [VV\n14]). But we must tread carefully here, for she does not mean that one\nin such a circumstance is necessarily more virtuous than one who is\nnot. Yet, facing a condition such as depression may test our virtue;\nits onset may lead one to fail to act in accordance with virtue, where\nan equally virtuous non-depressed agent would succeed. To speak more\ngenerally, some people will find themselves in circumstances,\npsychological or social, that will make greater demands on their\ncommitment to goodness.[6] This means that those who have a relatively\neasy time acting courageously or benevolently simply have not had\ntheir commitment to goodness tested in the same way as someone who\nfaces psychological obstacles. Those who face such obstacles\nmust show more virtue, though they are not necessarily more\nvirtuous than those in more ideal circumstances.\n\nThe virtue of wisdom presents another set of problems for the\nconnection of virtue with the will, which is essential to Foot\u2019s\naccount. Unlike other virtues, wisdom seems primarily to be an\nexcellence of the intellect rather than the will. Yet Foot argues that\njust because a putative virtue concerns the intellect does not mean\nthat the will is not also essential to it. For her, wisdom has two\ncomponents. First, it includes knowledge of the all-purpose means to\nvery general good ends. She includes here ends such as\n\u201cfriendship, marriage, the bringing up of children, or the\nchoice of ways of life\u201d (1978 [VV 5]). Such knowledge is within the\nreach of anyone who wants it, since one need not be especially clever\nin order to acquire it and, in this way, it is unlike specialized\nscientific knowledge, which is something within the grasp of a lucky\nfew who possess the necessary talent and opportunity to pursue it.\nThis means that the knowledge involved in wisdom is within the scope\nof the will: we can get it if we want it, and therefore we can in\nfairness be evaluated for our success or failure in its\nrealization.\n\nThe second part of wisdom, according to Foot, consists of knowing the\nworth of particular ends, something which she claims is difficult to\ndescribe. Here she has in mind the knowledge involved in realizing\nthat a life spent in the pursuit of wealth or fame at the expense of\ngood relationships is, in fact, a wasted life. This aspect of virtue\nis a matter of forming judgments about what is worthwhile in life, and\nshe thinks one can make false judgments about these matters. One\nwonders here how having a false view of what is worthwhile in life can\nbe a matter that is under the control of one\u2019s will. Yet Foot\nbelieves that there is a connection with the will here as well,\nstating, \n\n\nWisdom in this second part is \u2026 to be described in terms of\napprehension, and even judgement, but since it has to do with a\nman\u2019s attachments it also characterises his will. (1978 [VV\n7])\n\n\nThus, there is a case that the moral virtues, including wisdom, are\nvirtues of the will construed\n broadly.[7]\n The second feature is that the virtues are beneficial to their\npossessor or to others. As mentioned above, Foot in her early work\nembraces the view that the virtues necessarily benefit their\npossessors. She abandons that view in her middle period in favor of\none in which the virtues are beneficial \u201cin some general\nway\u201d (1978 [VV 2]). The benefit of the virtues may go to both their\npossessors and to others, or else exclusively to others. Courage,\ntemperance, and wisdom fall in the first category, benefiting both\ntheir possessors and others. She believes that charity and justice\nsometimes fall in the second category because they sometimes require\ntheir possessors to sacrifice everything (1978 [VV 3]). Justice, as she\nnotes, poses the biggest problem for the idea that virtues necessarily\nbenefit their possessors (1978 [VV xv, 3]). Yet, it is also unclear that\njustice necessarily benefits others, at least on any given occasion;\nsurely there are cases in which we could benefit someone by means that\ninfringe her rights, just as there are clearly occasions in which we\ncan do great benefit for many others, but only by violating\nanother\u2019s rights. So, there are no doubt occasions on which the\ndemands of justice require that we renounce certain benefits that we\ncould otherwise provide to others. But Foot seems to think that\noverall, it is beneficial for a society to consist of just\nindividuals. As she states, \n\n\ncommunities where justice and charity are lacking are apt to be\nwretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinists, or Sicily\nunder the Mafia. (1978 [VV 3]) \n\n\nIn this qualified sense, then, the virtues are good in that they are\nbeneficial.\n\nFoot raises the question of whether virtue always results in good\naction and, in \u201cVirtues and Vices\u201d (1978), she affirms\nthat it does. One difficulty is to account for the appearance that\nsomeone who is engaging in a bad action may still exhibit a virtue.\nShe gives the example of a fearless murderer: does the fearless\nmurderer exhibit courage? Foot thinks that the appearance that he does\nis misleading. She allows that we may be inclined to say that an act\n\u2018took courage\u2019 or to speak of the \u2018courage of the\nmurderer\u2019, but we still resist calling it a \u2018courageous\nact\u2019 or an \u2018act of courage\u2019. In \u201cVon Wright on\nVirtue\u201d (1989), Foot adds that we may be willing to describe an\naction as an \u2018act of courage\u2019 in cases where \n\n\nthe evil end is distant from the action concerned, as when, for\ninstance, a man does something to save his own life or that of his\ncompanions in the course of some wicked enterprise, such as an unjust\nwar. (1989 [MD 114]) \n\n\nShe believes this implies that courage is more than a simple mastery\nof fear; instead, it is mastery of fear in the context of the pursuit\nof good ends. Therefore, courage overlaps with daring and boldness,\nbut since the latter conditions may exist in the absence of any\ncommitment to goodness, they are not identical with the virtue of\ncourage. We may say, instead, that the mastery of fear is a necessary,\nbut not a sufficient, condition for the possession of courage.\n\nFoot\u2019s arguments attempt to show that the virtues are beneficial\nqualities that produce good actions. One might think that this should\nbe enough to establish that the virtues make one a good human being,\nbut one more step is needed as it is not yet clear whether the virtues\nare necessary for one to be a good human being. Foot argues that the\nvirtues are needed for humans as a corrective to general human\ncharacteristics that make it difficult for us to act well. In the case\nof virtues such as courage and temperance, it is rather obvious that\nwe are susceptible to feeling fear in ways that make it difficult for\nus to achieve worthwhile goals, and that similar difficulties are\nposed by the temptations of pleasure. In the cases of charity and\njustice, there are deficiencies of motivation due to the fact that we\nare generally not as attached to the well-being and rights of others\nas we are to our own (1978 [VV 9]). These tendencies are general, and\nneed not be exhibited in individual cases (1978 [VV 10]). As I noted\nabove, some individuals might find it relatively easy to exhibit\ncertain virtues, yet this is just an aspect of the circumstances of\ntheir lives, and it counts neither for nor against their possession of\nvirtue, and it does not matter for the purpose of determining whether\nthe virtues make one good qua human.\n\nSince no disposition of the will can count as a virtue unless it is a\ncorrective, according to Foot\u2019s view in her middle period,\n\u201ceverything is seen to depend on what human nature is\nlike\u201d (1978 [VV 10]). She clearly believes that the traditional\ncardinal virtues (courage, temperance, justice, charity, and wisdom)\ndeserve a place among the virtues as she construes them. Still she\nadmits:\n\n\nIt is possible\u2026 that the traditional list of the virtues and\nvices puts too much emphasis on hedonistic and sensual impulses and\ndoes not sufficiently take account of less straightforward\ninclinations such as the desire to be put upon and dissatisfied, or\nthe unwillingness to accept good things as they come along.\n(Ibid.)\n\n\nOn Foot\u2019s view, then, our theory of human nature must be taken\ninto account in our moral theorizing, and we must acknowledge as well\nthat our theory of human nature is open to revision.\n\nOn Foot\u2019s view, the goodness that is realized in possessing the\nvirtues extends beyond moral goodness; for example, she argues that\none may show courage in confronting something fearsome for the sake of\none\u2019s own life (1989 [MD 115]). The idea here, which she develops in\nher later work, is that one does not act well in neglecting\none\u2019s own interests, just as one who neglects the rights or\nwell-being of others is defective. Human goodness encompasses more\nthan moral goodness, and the virtues are connected with human goodness\nthus broadly understood.\n\nIt should be noted that, although Foot obviously made significant\ncontributions to the development of neo-Aristotelian virtue theory,\nshe explicitly disavowed allegiance to virtue ethics (RG 2). Her\nreasons for distancing herself from virtue ethics are somewhat\nobscure, and possibly misconstrue philosophers who advocate views\nunder that heading, but it seems from her writings on the nature of\nmorality that she considers morality something apart from virtue,\nsomething that is determined by an idealized, contractual moral code.\nHence, she endorses the attempts of John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon to\ndevelop social contract approaches to morality (1985 [MD 103]).\n",
