    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || Providence\n6.6 Providence\n\nPart IIIa-Iae of On the Universe is a lengthy treatise on\nGod\u2019s providence (providentia). William believes the\ndenial of God\u2019s providence, and in particular the denial that\nthe good will be rewarded and the evil punished, is an error \u201cso\nharmful and so pernicious for human beings that it eliminates from\nhuman beings by their roots all concern for moral goodness, all the\nhonor of the virtues, and all hope of future happiness\u201d (OO I,\n776a; Teske 2007, 92).\n\nAccording to William, God\u2019s providence (providentia) or\nproviding for the universe differs from foreknowledge\n(praescientia) in that, unlike foreknowledge, it embraces\nonly goods and not also evils (see OO I, 754b; Teske 2007, 30).\nWilliam is especially concerned to argue that God\u2019s providence\nis not just general in nature, but extends to all individual\ncreatures. God\u2019s care for the universe and its constituents is a\nmatter of God\u2019s knowing and paying attention to all things. From\nGod\u2019s point of view, nothing happens by chance. William\nintroduces final causality into his explanation by describing the\nuniverse as a teleological or goal-directed order, in which each thing\nhas a function or purpose established by God. God\u2019s care is his\nconcern that each thing fulfills its appointed function. Thus, God is\nnot necessarily concerned with what we might think is best for\nindividual things: flies get eaten by spiders, but this in fact is an\nend for which they were created. And ultimately animals were created\nfor the sake of humans, as William points out (for details on animals\nand providence, see Wei 2020, 49\u201374). In the case of humans,\nhowever, who are the apex of creation, their end is to experience\nhappiness in union with God, and God\u2019s providential care of\nhuman beings is aimed at this.\n\nBut if this is so, why do the evil prosper and the good suffer? What\nare we to make of natural disasters, of pain, suffering, death, and\nthe like? What, in short, are we to make of evil in the world?\nAlthough William does not take up the logical compatibility of evil\nwith an all-good, knowing and powerful god, he does attempt to explain\nat length how a range of particular kinds of evil are compatible with\nGod\u2019s providence and care for human beings. His explanation, in\ngeneral, is not novel and has roots in Augustine. He distinguishes the\nevils perpetrated by free agents and for which they are therefore to\nblame from other forms of evil, and argues that these other evils are\nin fact not really evil but good. Pain, for example, provides many\nbenefits, among which is that it mortifies and extinguishes \u201cthe\nlusts for pleasures and carnal and worldly desires\u201d (OO I, 764a;\nTeske 2007, 58). In many cases, what we call evil is in fact\nGod\u2019s just punishment, which William implies always has\nbeneficial effects. As for the blameworthy evils done by free agents,\nWilliam thinks that God permits these, but that it is incorrect to say\nthey come from God or are intended by him. They are rather the\nconsequence of rational creatures\u2019 misuse of the free will with\nwhich they were created, and the moral balance will be set right in\nthe future life, if not this one.\n\nIf the evils of this life appear to conflict with God\u2019s\nprovidence, God\u2019s providence and foreknowledge themselves seem\nto entail that everything occurs of necessity and hence that there is\nno free will. This concern leads William to consider a number of\ndoctrines that aim to show that all events happen of necessity. In\naddition to foreknowledge or providence, he considers the views that\nall events are the necessary causal outcomes of the motion and\nconfiguration of the heavenly bodies, or that all events result from\nthe heimarmene, i.e. the \u201cinterconnected and\nincessantly running series of causes and the necessary dependence of\none upon another\u201d (OO I, 785a; Teske 2007, 120); or finally,\nthat all things happen through fate (fatum sive fatatio).\nWilliam rejects all these grounds for the necessity of events (esp. on\nfate, see Sannino 2016).\n\nIn an interesting discussion of foreknowledge in part IIIa-Iae,\nchapter 15, he considers the argument that since it is necessary that\nwhatever God foresees will come about will come about, because\notherwise God could be deceived or mistaken, then since God foresees\neach thing that will come about, it is necessary that it will come\nabout. William replies that the proposition \u201cIt is necessary\nthat whatever God foresees (providit) will come about will\ncome about\u201d has two interpretations, \u201cbecause the\nnecessity can refer to individuals or to the whole\u201d (OO I, 778b;\nTeske 2007, 99). The argument for the necessity of all events\nequivocates between these two readings and is therefore invalid.\nWilliam notes that the distinction he makes is close to the\ndistinction between a divided and composite sense, but he is critical\nof those who instead distinguish an ambiguity between a de re\n(about the thing) and de dicto (about what is said)\nreading.\n",
