Epistemic Situationism\n\nAs mentioned above, practitioners of all stripes tend to recognize the\nimportance of empirical findings about cognition and inquiry. There\nare multiple reasons for this sensitivity beyond a predilection for\nnaturalism. First, even though VE is a normative discipline as\ndiscussed above, some practitioners accept a version of the ought\nimplies can principle. To the extent that empirical research in\npsychology, cognitive science, and other fields delineates the limits\nof human cognition, such research constrains the inquiries,\ndispositions, and states that can be epistemically demanded of people.\nMore ambitiously, one might think that extremely demanding epistemic\nnorms are sometimes inappropriate even if, strictly speaking, they can\nbe satisfied. Second, even if one rejects ought implies can,\nan alleged strength of VE is its ability to respond successfully to\nskepticism. However, if the dispositions practitioners assume to exist\nare never or rarely embodied by humans, then skepticism looms. Note\nthat this argument goes through even if people could acquire and\nmanifest epistemic virtues, just so long as they in fact don\u2019t.\nThird, empirical research may help to solve the generality\nproblem. Any episode of acquiring a belief can be classed under\nan indefinite number of headings; some such classifications\nindividuate highly reliable dispositions, while others individuate\nless reliable dispositions. When I infer from the fact that every\nemerald I\u2019ve examined is green that every emerald (whether\nexamined or not) is green, should my inference be described as\ninductive generalization or inductive generalization\nemploying projectable predicates? Though the generality problem\nwas first articulated as a hurdle for process reliabilism (Pollock\n1984), Goldman (1986: 50) and Zagzebski (1996: 300) recognize that VE\nfaces its own version of the problem. Should epistemic virtues be\ncoarsely individuated, so that open-mindedness makes the cut,\nor should they be finely individuated, so that open-mindedness\ntowards friends while in a good mood makes the cut? Zagzebski\n(1996: 309) argues that this question should be answered empirically,\nwith a preference for coarse individuation. Finally, practitioners who\nfavor an ameliorative or educative approach to VE have an additional\nreason to attend to empirical findings, because these may reveal\ncommon cognitive defects that could potentially be set right, as well\nas suggesting more promising prospects for cognitive and epistemic\ntraining and development than those employed in contemporary\npedagogy.\n\nThese considerations notwithstanding, the cognitive sciences might\npose a threat to VE. After all, to the extent that people\u2019s\ncognitive dispositions do not qualify as virtues (because they are\nunreliable or irresponsible, for example), the true beliefs they\nproduce will not count as knowledge (Alfano 2012). Recall that\npractitioners are largely in agreement that knowledge is true belief\nthat manifests virtue. If empirical studies suggest that\npeople\u2019s beliefs usually manifest cognitive defects or\nincompetence, then VE would be led to the conclusion that most of our\ntrue beliefs don\u2019t count as knowledge. This challenge to VE is\nanalogous to the \u201csituationist challenge\u201d to virtue ethics\n(Doris 1998, 2002; Flanagan 1991; Harman 1999; for a recent\narticulation, see Merritt, Doris, and Harman 2010).\n\nMark Alfano (2012: 234) first framed the problem as an inconsistent\ntriad: anti-skepticism, according to which almost all humans\nhave quite a bit of knowledge, epistemic situationism,\naccording to which most people\u2019s intellectual dispositions are\nnot virtues because they are highly sensitive to seemingly trivial and\nepistemically irrelevant situational factors, and VE. Regarding the\nreliability of people\u2019s inferential dispositions, Alfano (2014,\n2013b: chapter 6) pointed to a robust series of findings related to\nthe unreliability of heuristics such as the availability heuristic,\nthe representativeness heuristic, and the recognition heuristic.\nRegarding responsibilist VE, Alfano (2012, 2013b: chapter 5)\nemphasized findings on the substantial influence of seemingly trivial\nbut epistemically irrelevant factors on belief-formation. These\nfactors include mood elevators, mood depressors, and social cues of\nunanimous versus non-unanimous agreement. Subsequently, while a few\nphilosophers have twisted the empirical knife further (e.g., Olin and\nDoris 2014; Blumenthal-Barby 2015), at least four lines of response\nhave emerged.\n\nThe first main response to epistemic situationism is to deny that\nthere is a problem, referring to more heartening empirical evidence.\nFor example, Fairweather and Montemayor (2014) argue that\nheuristics\u2014instead of being unreliable mental\nshortcuts\u2014are more reliable than traditional inferential\npatterns that people tend to misuse. In a similar vein, Samuelson and\nChurch (2015) argue that heuristics, when properly monitored and\ninterrupted by top-down effortful cognition, can be reliable, and that\neffective exercise of such top-down control constitutes a version of\nthe responsibilist virtue of intellectual humility. And King (2014a)\ndefends responsibilism by pointing out that, at least on\nZagzebski\u2019s (1996) version of VE, knowledge needn\u2019t\nmanifest virtue but instead needs only to arise from the sort of\nmotivated inquiry that a virtuous person would engage in.\n\nThe second main response is more conciliatory, suggesting that VE\nshould focus less on achieving virtue and more on avoiding vice.\nRoberts and West (2015) contend that research on heuristics and\nrelated cognitive biases shows that humans are best understood as\nmanifesting various natural epistemic defects. The work of becoming a\ngood-enough cognizer is then a matter of cultivating ways of avoiding\nor overcoming these defects. They suggest that self-vigilance and\nincreased intellectual vitality are two key ways to handle these\ndefects, making their view somewhat similar to that of Samuelson and\nChurch (2015). Cassam (2016) argues that the extensive literature on\nconspiracy theories and conspiratorial thinking shows that people are\nprone to various intellectual vices, understood as character traits\nthat impede effective and responsible inquiry. Understanding human\ninquiry and how it is liable to go wrong thus requires a study of\nintellectual vices.\n\nThis suggestion is in line with the third main response to epistemic\nsituationism, which is to somehow offload some of the cognitive agency\ntraditionally required of the individual onto the material, social, or\npolitical environment. For instance, Pritchard (2014) argues for a\nmore modest version of VE that countenances the essential role of the\nenvironment in the acquisition of knowledge. Someone who is luckily\nplaced in their material, social, and political environment will end\nup with more knowledge despite less exercise of cognitive agency than\nsomeone who is unluckily placed, even if the latter exercises heroic\nlevels of cognitive agency. Epistemic situationism is thus\nreinterpreted as evidence for our inescapable epistemic dependence on\ncircumstance. Alfano (2013b, 2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg (2017,\n2018) connect the challenge of epistemic situationism with the\nliterature in the philosophy of mind on embedded, scaffolded, and\nextended cognition inspired by Clark and Chalmers (1998; see also\nSterelny 2010). The basic idea here is that when a cognitive agent is\nsuitably integrated with natural objects, artifacts, and other agents\nin their material, social, and political environment, those externalia\nmay be partially constitutive of the agent\u2019s cognitive\ndispositions. Embedded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable natural\nenvironment; scaffolded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable artificial\nenvironment; outright extended cognition occurs in a\ndynamically-reactive environment. Within this taxonomy, Alfano and\nSkorburg (2018) argue that it is possible to improve the reliability\nof the recognition heuristic not by developing further internal\ncognitive resources (as Samuelson & Church 2015 and Roberts &\nWest 2015 would have it) but by better structuring the informational\necosystem in which people find themselves\u2014a suggestion that\nharmonizes with recent work on the epistemology of information and\ncommunication technologies such as the Internet (Bozdag & van den\nHoven 2015; Lynch 2016) and library sciences (Fallis & Whitcomb\n2009). Alfano (2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg (2017) argue that, in\nsome cases, pairs of agents mutually constitute each other\u2019s\ncharacter by engaging in dynamic interactions with interlocking\nvirtues. The literature on embedded, scaffolded, and extended\nepistemic virtues is a natural development of VE\u2019s emphasis on\nintellectual agents and communities.\n\nA fourth response is that there is no evidence that knowledge requires\nthe sort of dispositions that epistemic situationism challenges and,\nmoreover, that there is theoretical and empirical evidence that\nknowledge does not require such dispositions (Turri 2017). More\nspecifically, according to this line of criticism, no serious argument\nhas ever been provided that knowledge requires reliability; instead,\nphilosophers have relied on weak explanatory arguments or, more\ncommonly, simply assumed that knowledge requires reliability (Turri\n2016a). Moreover, if knowledge is an achievement, then we should\nexpect it to not require reliability, because no other achievement\nrequires reliability (Turri 2015c). Additionally, recent empirical\nstudies have shown that the ordinary concept of knowledge\u2014which\nis the concept practitioners have claimed to be interested\nin\u2014does not make reliability a necessary condition of knowledge\n(Turri 2016a). For instance, in cases of perceptual and memorial\nbeliefs, people attribute knowledge at similarly high rates (~80%)\nregardless of whether the agent gets it right ten-percent of the time\nor ninety-percent of the time. Along with this line of criticism,\nresearchers have offered an alternative theory of knowledge that\nallows for knowledge produced by even highly unreliable cognitive\nabilities or powers (Turri 2016a,c).\n",
