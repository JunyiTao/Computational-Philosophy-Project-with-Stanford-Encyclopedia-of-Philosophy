    "main_text": "What (Linguistic) Ambiguity Isn\u2019t || Vagueness\n2.1 Vagueness\n\nCharacterizing vagueness is notoriously (and ironically) difficult,\nbut it seems to stem from lack of precision in the meaning or\nreference of a term or phrase. There are clearly words that are\nambiguous but not (obviously) vague: \u2018bat\u2019 is not vague\nbut it is ambiguous. \u2018Is bald\u2019 looks to be vague but not\nambiguous. \n\nA general hallmark of vagueness is that it involves borderline cases:\npossible cases that are neither clearly in the extension of the vague\nterm nor clearly not in its extension. An alternative characterization\ninvolves fuzzy boundaries rather than borderline cases (see Fara 2000,\n47\u201348). Cases of ambiguity can be like this: one can imagine a sorites\nseries involving something that is clearly a baseball bat at\nt1 that is changed particle by particle into a\nchiropteran with borderline cases of each mid-series, thus being a\nvague case of \u2018bat\u2019 in both senses. However, ambiguity\nneed not be characterized by borderline cases nor by sorites-series\nsusceptibility.\n\nInterestingly, there are views regarding vague language that treat\nvagueness as at least akin to ambiguity. Braun and Sider (2007) treat\nsentences with vague terms as expressing multiple distinct\npropositions and supervaluationism treats vague terms as expressing\nmultiple distinct semantic values. But the relevant notion of multiple\nexpression seem different from paradigmatic ambiguity, where two\nmeanings are definitely meanings of a term or phrase, not where a\nbunch of meanings are acceptable ways of making a term more\nprecise. If anything, one might think that these views treat vagueness\nas a sort of polysemy.\n",
