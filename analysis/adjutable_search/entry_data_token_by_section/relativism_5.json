    "main_text": "Why Relativism?\n2. Why Relativism?\nInterest in relativism as a philosophical doctrine goes back to ancient Greece. In more recent decades, however, relativism has also proven popular not only as a philosophical position but also as an idea underwriting a normative\u2014ethical and political-outlook. (see Bloom 1987, in particular the Introduction, and Kusch (ed.) 2019). A number of philosophical considerations as well as socio-historical developments explain the enduring interest in and the more recent popularity of relativism.\n",
