    "main_text": "Emotions and Qing in Early Chinese Philosophy || Emotions and Qing\n2.1 Emotions and Qing\n\nMany psychologists and philosophers report that emotions have\nparticular psychological properties such as phenomenology,\nintentionality, motivation, embodiment, and appraisal (Charland 2002;\nFehr & Russell 1984; Goldie 2002; Russell 1980). For example,\none\u2019s emotional state of anger against unfair discrimination can\nbe explained by one\u2019s feeling (distress, frustration),\nintentionality (unfair discrimination), motivation (complaint,\nprotest), embodiment (rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure), and\nappraisal (oppose, dislike). An emotional state, therefore, is a\npsychological complexity consisting of multidimensional or\nmultifactorial processes of the mind. On the basis of these\npsychological properties, one can easily understand Blackburn\u2019s\n(1996: 117) definition:\n\n\nThe typical human emotions include love, grief, fear, anger, joy. Each\nindicates a state of some kind of arousal, a state that can prompt\nsome activities and interfere with others. These states are associated\nwith characteristic feelings, and they have characteristic bodily\nexpressions.\n\n\nIn the Liji (\u79ae\u8a18 the Book of Rites), one of\nConfucian classics, one can find comparable categories (such as joy,\nanger, and love) and characteristics (such as feeling, arousal, and\nactivity) of emotions:\n\n\nWhat are the feelings [qing] of men? They are joy, anger,\nsadness, fear, love, disliking, and liking. These seven feelings\nbelong to men without their learning them. (Liji, 9.18; Legge\n1885a: 379)\n\nBefore the feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy are aroused it\nis called equilibrium (chung [zhong], centrality,\nmean). When these feelings are aroused and each and all attain due\nmeasure and degree, it is called harmony. (Liji, 31.1;\nZhongyong, 1; Chan 1963: 98)\n\n\nIt seems that ancient Chinese notions of qing and feelings\nare comparable with the Western psychological categories and\ncharacterizations of emotions as illustrated in Blackburn\u2019s\ndefinition and the passages of the Liji. In many ancient\nChinese texts, however, this similarity does not hold. Qing\ndoes not always refer to inner feelings or emotional states. It refers\nto many different things, some of which have little to do with inner\npsychological states.\n",
