    "main_text": "Tests of the MWI\n5. Tests of the MWI\n\nIt has frequently been claimed, e.g. by De Witt 1970, that the MWI is\nin principle indistinguishable from the ideal collapse theory. This is\nnot so. The collapse leads to effects that do not exist if the MWI is\nthe correct theory. To observe the collapse we would need a super\ntechnology which allows for the \u201cundoing\u201d of a quantum\nexperiment, including a reversal of the detection process by\nmacroscopic devices. See Lockwood 1989 (p. 223), Vaidman 1998 (p.\n257), and other proposals in Deutsch 1986. These proposals are all for\ngedanken experiments that cannot be performed with current or any\nforeseeable future technology. Indeed, in these experiments an\ninterference of different worlds has to be observed. Worlds are\ndifferent when at least one macroscopic object is in macroscopically\ndistinguishable states. Thus, what is needed is an interference\nexperiment with a macroscopic body. Today there are interference\nexperiments with larger and larger objects (e.g., molecules with 2000\natoms, see Fein et al. 2019), but these objects are still not\nlarge enough to be considered \u201cmacroscopic\u201d. Such\nexperiments can only refine the constraints on the boundary where the\ncollapse might take place. A decisive experiment should involve the\ninterference of states which differ in a macroscopic number of degrees\nof freedom: an impossible task for today\u2019s technology. It can be\nargued, see for example Parrochia 2020, that the burden of an\nexperimental proof lies with the opponents of the MWI, because it is\nthey who claim that there is a new physics beyond the well-tested\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. As the analysis of Schlosshauer 2006 shows,\nwe have no such evidence.\n\nThe MWI is wrong if there is a physical process of collapse of the\nwave function of the Universe to a single-world quantum state. Some\ningenious proposals for such a process have been made (see Pearle 1986\nand the entry on\n collapse theories).\n These proposals (and Weissman\u2019s 1999 non-linear decoherence\nidea) have additional observable effects, such as a tiny energy\nnon-conservation, that were tested in several experiments, e.g.\nCollett et al. 1995, Diosi 2015. The effects were not found\nand some (but not all!) of these models have been ruled out, see\nVinante et al. 2020.\n\nMuch of the experimental evidence for quantum mechanics is statistical\nin nature. Greaves and Myrvold 2010 argued that our experimental data\nfrom quantum experiments supports the Probability Postulate of the MWI\nno less than it supports the Born rule in other approaches to quantum\nmechanics (see, however, Kent 2010, Albert 2010, and Price 2010 for\nsome criticisms). Barrett and Huttegger 2020 argue that \u201ceven an\nideal observer under ideal epistemic conditions may never have any\nempirical evidence whatsoever for believing that the results of\none\u2019s quantum-mechanical experiments are randomly\ndetermined\u201d. Thus, statistical analysis of quantum experiments\nshould not help us testing the MWI, but we might mention speculative\ncosmological arguments in support of the MWI by Page 1999, Kragh 2009,\nAguirre and Tegmark 2011, and Tipler 2012.\n",
