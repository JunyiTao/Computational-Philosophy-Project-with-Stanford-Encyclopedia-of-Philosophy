    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nAs with many of his contemporaries, we know very few dates with\ncertainty in the life of Peter Auriol (a.k.a. Peter Auriole, Peter\nAureol, Petrus Aureoli, the Doctor Facundus). On the basis of\nhis later career it seems reasonable to suppose that Auriol was born\naround 1280, and we have evidence that he originated in the region\nnear the city of Cahors in France. We know that Auriol joined the\nFranciscan order in the order\u2019s province of Aquitania, and we\nsurmise that this took place sometime before 1300. From the structure\nof the contemporary Franciscan educational system we can deduce that\nhe studied in Paris sometime in the first decade of the fourteenth\ncentury, but evidence that some scholars have presented that Auriol\nheard Scotus in Paris or was definitely in Paris in 1304 is\ninconclusive. Auriol\u2019s first written work, dealing with the\nissue of Franciscan poverty (Tractatus de paupertate et usu\npaupere), seems to have been composed in 1311 or at latest early\n1312. In the latter year we know that Auriol was teaching in Bologna,\npresumably at the Franciscan convent in that city. It was here that he\nauthored his Tractatus de principiis naturae (Treatise on\nthe principles of nature), his only non-theological work. By the\nend of 1314, Auriol was in Toulouse, again apparently teaching at the\nFranciscan convent, and it seems that the two treatises that he\nauthored in support of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary\n(and in opposition to Dominican critics of that view) stem from this\ntime (Tractatus de conceptione Beatae Mariae Virginis and\nRepercussorium). In one or both of these cities, Auriol must\nhave also been lecturing on the standard medieval theological\ntextbook, the Sentences of Peter Lombard, and his massive\ncommentary on the first book of the Sentences, his\nScriptum super primum Sententiarum \u2014 more than 1100\nfolio pages in its early modern printing (Rome 1596) \u2014 was\nalmost certainly substantially finished by the autumn of 1316 when\nAuriol arrived in Paris, sent by the Franciscan order to earn his\ndoctorate. We used to think that Auriol read the Sentences at\nParis 1316\u201318, but new research has shown that he did this there\nover the sole academic year 1317-18 (Duba and Schabel 2017, esp. pp.\n159-165). No less a figure than Pope John XXII, Auriol\u2019s mentor,\nwrote to the Chancellor of Paris in a letter dated July 14, 1318,\nasking that Auriol be granted the doctorate. The letter served its\npurpose, and by late 1318 he was the Franciscan regent master in\ntheology there. Auriol served as regent master in Paris until 1320 or\n1321, lecturing on the Bible (from which resulted several extant\nbiblical commentaries), and holding at least one series of quodlibetal\ndisputations. In 1321, he was elevated by John XXII to the position of\nArchbishop of Aix-en-Provence, but Auriol died soon after taking\noffice, probably on January 22, 1322. (See, for more details, Teetaert\n1935, and esp. Buytaert 1952).\n\nAs should be clear from the above, Auriol\u2019s extant works are\npredominantly theological in nature, having been composed in\nconnection with his duties as a theological student and teacher.\nNevertheless, especially his commentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences is a treasure trove of philosophical thought\nspanning a vast range of issues in metaphysics, epistemology and\nphilosophy of mind, natural philosophy, and ethics; it is in addition\nhis most important and influential work. We possess several versions\nof Auriol\u2019s Sentences commentary. Besides the\nScriptum, which, as mentioned above, was mostly composed\nbefore Auriol arrived in Paris in the autumn of 1316, we have\nreportationes (student transcripts) of lectures that Auriol\nheld on all four books of the Sentences, some of which have\nobviously been reworked to one degree or another by Auriol himself and\nsome of which are still found only in medieval manuscripts. A version\nof his commentary on books II-IV was published in Rome in 1605 (along\nwith Auriol\u2019s single Quodlibet of sixteen questions).\nIn part because the project to critically edit all of Auriol\u2019s\nworks has been initiated only recently, the complex relationship\nbetween these published texts and other versions, found only in\nmanuscripts, as well as the relationship between the published\nScriptum and the extant reportationes on book I of\nthe Sentences, is not entirely clear. (See however, Nielsen\n2002; Schabel 2000a, pp. 67\u201376; Schabel 2000b; Duba 2000; for\nmore information on Auriol\u2019s works, see the bibliography on the\nPeter Auriol Homepage (Other Internet Resources).)\n2. The Character of Auriol\u2019s Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions\n\nAuriol\u2019s thought is relentlessly systematic; one finds certain\nbasic ideas or devices that crop up time and again in extremely varied\nphilosophical and theological contexts. Given this, it seems clear\nthat at an early stage in his career Auriol settled on these basic\nideas and devices as those best representing his fundamental\nconvictions, and then applied them rigorously, so that his philosophy\nand theology emerge from them like spokes from a hub. As a\nconsequence, Auriol\u2019s thought has the appearance of being\nextremely unified.\n\nAuriol also exhibits throughout his works a pronounced historical\nbent. That is to say, when dealing with nearly every philosophical or\ntheological issue, he takes as his point of departure a detailed\nanalysis of earlier and contemporary ideas on the matter at hand,\noffering for the most part accurate summaries of other positions and\ngenerally perceptive critiques. On the basis of this analysis of\nearlier positions, Auriol\u2019s own thought often takes shape as he\nproposes positions that have the goal of avoiding the pitfalls he sees\nin his predecessors\u2019 ideas. A recent study of Auriol\u2019s\ncitation practice in his Scriptum (Schabel 2009) has shown\nthat the top five university authors explicitly cited are, in reverse\norder: Durand of St. Pourcain, Hervaeus Natalis, Henry of Ghent,\nThomas Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus. While these were the authors who\nclearly had the greatest impact on Auriol\u2019s thought, he\nresponded throughout his works to many other theologians, including\nWilliam of Ware, Godfrey of Fontaines, Bonaventure, Richard of\nMediavilla (Middleton), Thomas Wylton, and Giles of Rome. Moreover,\nAuriol is clearly extremely well-versed in ancient and Arabic thought.\n(See e.g., Duba 2001.)\n\nFinally, Auriol is well known for proposing unusual and sometimes\nradical solutions to traditional problems. This was one of the reasons\nwhy Auriol\u2019s thought was so provocative to his contemporaries\nand to readers right into the seventeenth century. Recent research has\npointed to several areas of Auriol\u2019s thought as particularly\ninnovative. Among these areas can be mentioned the following.\n2.1 The Categories\n\nAuriol maintained that only five of the ten Aristotelian categories\nactually exist in the extra-mental world (substance, quality,\nquantity, action, and passion), the other five (relation, place, time,\nposition, and state/habit) being merely conceptual or mind-dependent,\ni.e. resulting from an intellect conceiving one of the actual\ncategories to be other than it is in extra-mental reality. Thus, the\nconceptual categories exist only potentially, but not actually, in\nextra-mental reality; it is possible for the intellect, upon\nacquaintance with one of the actual categories in extra-mental\nreality, to form the concept of the corresponding conceptual category\n(on Auriol\u2019s ideas on the category most broadly, see Amerini\n2014). This theory has been studied most thoroughly with regard to\nAuriol\u2019s ideas concerning the category of relation (cf. e.g.,\nHenninger 1989, pp. 150\u201373; Brower 2018, sections 3.1 and 3.2;\nFriedman 2013, pp. 550\u201356). In this context, Auriol maintains\nthat real relations are conceptual in nature, not existing in\nextra-mental reality, and hence dependent upon the activity of the\nmind; the three types of real relation originate from the\nintellect\u2019s acquaintance with respectively quantity (e.g., a\nrelation of equality), quality (e.g., a relation of similarity), and\naction and passion (e.g., a relation of causality). Moreover, Auriol,\nin stark contrast to the medieval tradition before him, thinks of\nrelations as being between two terms, and not in a subject\ntowards a term. While the impact of Auriol\u2019s ideas on the\ncategories has not been studied in any depth, nevertheless it is\ninteresting that Gregory of Rimini devotes a great deal of his\ndiscussion of the category of relation to a thorough attack on\nAuriol\u2019s view (Henninger 1989, p. 173; for Auriol\u2019s more\ngeneral views on the ontology of accidents as well as some reaction to\nthose views, see Pasnau 2008, Pasnau 2011, pp. 213-220).\n2.2 The Concept of Being\n\nAuriol modified Scotus\u2019 view on the univocity of the concept of\nbeing. While accepting Scotus\u2019 view that \u2018being\u2019 is\nunivocal both between God and creatures and between substance and\naccidents, Auriol nevertheless heavily criticized Scotus for\nmaintaining that being was contracted to the most general genera\nthrough various \u201cqualitative differences\u201d that themselves\nwere not included under the concept of being; on Scotus\u2019 view,\nbeing itself became like a genus that was contracted through an\noutside difference. Auriol rejected this view on the grounds that this\n\u201coutside difference\u201d was an illusion; according to Auriol,\nnothing escapes the concept of being. Instead Auriol maintains that\nthe concept of being is an indeterminate concept that grasps\nall beings at once and equally. This concept of being itself has no\ndeterminate content; instead it contains within itself implicitly all\nother concepts that the intellect could possibly form. Being, then,\nfor Auriol is not contracted to its inferiors through any added\ndifference, but merely through explicating what is already contained\nimplicitly and indeterminately in the concept of being (Brown 1964;\nBrown 1965; Goris 2002; Pickav\u00e9 2004; Aertsen 2012, pp.\n433\u201356). As with many other topics, the history of the reception\nof Auriol\u2019s view on the univocity of the concept of being\nremains to be written, but the important fifteenth century Thomist,\nJohn Capreolus, copied half of his eleven page treatment of this issue\nverbatim from Auriol\u2019s Scriptum only to reject\nAuriol\u2019s view in favor of a more Thomistic one. (See Brown 1964,\np. 6, esp. n. 10.)\n2.3 Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge\n\nAuriol developed influential theories on future contingents and divine\nforeknowledge. These take their starting point in two convictions that\nAuriol firmly holds. First, he maintains that immutability and\nnecessity are mutually implicative, and thus, since God is immutable,\nif he were to know the future, the future would be necessary. (This\nsame conviction led Auriol to reject, at least in some contexts, the\nuse of the popular later-medieval distinction between God\u2019s\nabsolute and ordained powers. For Auriol, there is no genuine\npossibility in God to will other than he does.) Second, Auriol took as\na fundamental principle the existence of human free will (on\nAuriol\u2019s theory of free will, see Hoffmann 2015; Alliney 2015).\nThese two principles lead Auriol to theorize that God does know the\nfuture, but not as future; rather God knows the future\nindistantly, as abstracted from all time; it is therefore\nthis special way of knowing the future that preserves human freedom\nand avoids divine necessitarianism. In accordance with this view,\nAuriol develops a three-valued logic, in which future-tensed\npropositions are neutral, admitting of neither truth nor falsity,\nthereby discarding the principle of bivalence (the principle claiming\nthat any proposition can have only one of two truth values).\nAuriol\u2019s position on future contingents and divine foreknowledge\nhad a great deal of impact in the later Middle Ages, since it often\ninspired refutations that nevertheless took into account the\ncriticisms that Auriol had made of, e.g., Thomas Aquinas, Henry of\nGhent, and John Duns Scotus (Schabel 2000a). When Auriol\u2019s view\nactually found an adherent in Peter de Rivo at the University of\nLouvain (Leuven) in the period 1465\u201374, it occasioned a major\ndebate involving in the end Pope Sixtus IV, who in 1474 officially\ncondemned aspects of Auriol\u2019s view. Despite this condemnation,\nhowever, it appears that Auriol\u2019s critique of earlier scholastic\nviews and some elements of his own theory on the topic influenced the\nhumanist Pietro Pomponazzi around 1520, and perhaps as well the\nreformer Martin Luther (Schabel 2003).\n2.4 Predestination and Free Will\n\nIn the related area of predestination, human free will is again a\nmotive force behind Auriol\u2019s ideas. Believing that earlier\nexplanations of the way God elected some to salvation and damned\nothers to eternal punishment left all too little room for human free\nwill, Auriol proposed a theory on which God offers his grace freely to\nall human beings. Salvation comes to those who passively accept this\nfree offer of grace. Those whom God knows offer an obstacle to grace,\ni.e. those who actively reject it, God damns to eternal punishment.\nThus, for Auriol, the central issue in predestination is how human\nbeings choose to react to God\u2019s free offer of grace: they are\njudged on their reaction. Auriol believes that he has avoided any hint\nof Pelagianism \u2014 where human beings can merit salvation on their\nown account \u2014 because individuals do not do anything\nactively in order to earn their salvation on his theory; they are only\nrequired to passively accept grace by not offering an obstacle to it,\nand this passive acceptance is, according to Auriol, a negative cause\nof the person\u2019s salvation. Auriol\u2019s theory when first\nproposed was an extremely innovative way of explaining the mechanics\nof salvation, and it came in for scathing criticism from, among\nothers, Gregory of Rimini; but, whether through direct influence or\nnot, elements of Auriol\u2019s theory appear in the works of such\nthinkers as William Ockham, Robert Holcot, and, on the eve of the\nReformation, Gabriel Biel (Halverson 1998).\n\nIn the rest of this entry, we\u2019ll look at two areas in which\nAuriol provoked a significant response in part on account of his\nradical solutions, two areas that also illustrate the systematic and\nhistorical nature of his thought: his ideas on the relation between\ncognition and reality (including his conceptualism) and his ideas on\nintuitive and abstractive cognition.\n3. Cognition and Reality: Conceptualism and the esse apparens\n\nIf there is one thing that is known about Peter Auriol, it is that he\nwas a \u201cconceptualist.\u201d Indeed, Auriol has often been\nviewed as a forerunner of William Ockham precisely on account of his\nconceptualism. What is probably the very first monograph ever devoted\nto Auriol (Dreiling 1913) deals with his conceptualism. Thus,\nunderstanding Auriol\u2019s conceptualism is a good place to start\nwhen dealing with Auriol\u2019s thought.\n\nIn fact, Auriol is a conceptualist. By this it is merely\nmeant that, for Auriol, only singulars (i.e. individuals) have real,\nextra-mental existence. As Auriol writes: \u201cevery thing, insofar\nas it exists, exists as a singular\u201d (omnis res, eo quod est,\nsingulariter est). Moreover, Auriol states explicitly that there\nis no principle of individuation \u2014 individuals just are\nindividuals and their individuality needs no further explanation. This\nis one of the most basic of Auriol\u2019s metaphysical principles,\nand it necessarily entails that universality and universals are mental\nphenomena, fabricated in some way by the intellect. Thus, for Auriol,\nthe individuality of singular things does not need explaining, but the\nformation of universal concepts on the basis of these individuals does\nneed explaining. What is important for understanding Auriol\u2019s\nconceptualism, then, is explicating his theory of intellectual\ncognition: determining the process by which the intellect fabricates\nthese universal concepts, determining what these universal concepts\nare, and what relation they have to really existing singulars in the\nworld.\n\nWhile only individuals have real, extra-mental existence, every\nindividual by its very nature has several different ontological or\nquidditative aspects. Auriol calls these quidditative aspects\nrationes (a term that will remain untranslated in the rest of\nthis entry). Thus, Auriol claims that, e.g., Socrates has the\nrationes substance, corporeality, sensitivity, rationality.\nMoreover, rationes of the same kind found in different\nindividuals are \u201cmaximally similar\u201d (simillimae).\ne.g., Socrates\u2019 corporeality is totally like Plato\u2019s\ncorporeality, which is totally like the donkey Brunellus\u2019\ncorporeality. It should be noted that these rationes are\nnon-universal characteristics, i.e. a ratio belongs to one\nand only one individual. This is why Auriol emphasizes the maximal\nsimilarity of rationes of the same kind: they are not the\nsame and they are not shared, they are merely as alike as they can be.\nWhat is most important about these rationes in the present\ncontext is that they are the basic unit of intellectual acquaintance:\nevery ratio of its very nature is able to serve as the basis\nfor a concept, although the concept that results from the intellection\nof a ratio can be modified by the way that we conceive it\n(our modus concipiendi), a purely psychological difference\nwith no immediate grounds in extra-mental reality. We might say that a\nratio directs our intellect to form one certain concept, this\ncore concept undergoing modification according to the way we conceive\nit. Our universal concepts, then, have in these rationes a\ndirect basis in extra-mental individuals. (See, for more on this,\nFriedman 1999, W\u00f6ller 2015, pp. 36\u201379; for the term\n\u2018maximally similar\u2019 [as it is used in Ockham], see\nPanaccio 1992, pp. 258\u201367.) What universal concept we actually\nform, according to Auriol, depends on how closely our will makes the\nintellect focus on the information we receive from the object of\ncognition, and hence how strong an impression the object makes on the\nintellect: the more closely focused, the stronger the impression, the\nmore specific the universal concept that is formed.\n\nTo understand further what universal concepts are, we need to know\nwhat Auriol thinks concepts in general are. Central to this is\nAuriol\u2019s theory of apparent existence or esse apparens,\nthat, at all levels, our cognitive faculties, in the very process of\ncognizing, put the object of cognition into a special type of\nexistence, termed by Auriol \u201capparent existence\u201d (esse\napparens). For Auriol, in line with the general medieval view,\nour cognitive apparatus is divided into a sensory part (including the\nfive external senses, the common sense, which puts the sense data from\nthe five external senses together, and the imagination, which stores,\nretrieves, and sometimes manipulates the sense data, as well as sends\nthem on to the intellect) and an intellectual part (including the\nagent and the possible intellect). According to Auriol, in any\ncognitive act \u2014 whether sensory or intellectual \u2014 the\ncognitive power puts the object of cognition into this special type of\nexistence, and the object of cognition in this special type of\nexistence is the object as perceived. Thus concepts as well\nas sensations are simply cognized things themselves in a type of\nexistence different from that which they have in extra-mental reality.\nAuriol employs at least two different approaches to argue for this\nview: one based on intellectual cognition, the other based on sensory\ncognition. (Auriol\u2019s trinitarian theology provides further\narguments for this view; see Friedman 2013, esp. Ch. 9, section 4.)\nWe\u2019ll look at each of these in turn, in the process sketching\nwhat it was about the theory of esse apparens that made it\nquite radical and disturbing to Auriol\u2019s medieval readers. (For\nthe sake of precision, esse apparens will go untranslated\nhereafter.)\n\nIntellectual cognition (see Friedman 1999;\nAdriaenssen 2014, esp. pp. 85\u201395; Friedman 2015; Adriaenssen\n2017a, pp. 82\u201399): Auriol\u2019s solution to the question of\nwhat a concept is takes its point of departure in the necessity of\nexplaining three things at once: essential predication; intellectual\nacquaintance with extra-mental objects; and necessary, scientific\nknowledge. Auriol holds that the first of these explanatory\nrequirements would not be fulfilled by any theory of concepts\naccording to which the concept is a type of representation or token of\nthe thing, if this representation has real \u2014 albeit mental\n\u2014 being. Examples that he gives of solutions of this sort are\nthat a concept might be the intellectual act or an intelligible\nspecies or any type of accident terminating an act of the\nunderstanding. All of these representations have some real being of\ntheir own. According to Auriol, these types of representational\ntheories of concepts would make explaining essential predication\nimpossible, since, assuming any of them, when I predicated, e.g.,\nanimal of human being, I would make a false predication, inasmuch as\nthe concept human being would not be the concept animal. The\nultimate problem with theories of universals of this sort, according\nto Auriol, is that if they were correct, then universals would not be\nuniversals at all, but would be particulars with their own real being.\nMoreover, not only these same types of representational views of\nconcepts, but also any theory that holds concepts to be Platonic\nIdeas, would hinder us in having intellectual acquaintance with\nextra-mental objects, Auriol\u2019s second explanatory requirement.\nOn both these types of theories, our knowledge would extend only to\nthese really existing entities. We would, according to Auriol, be\nintellectually blind to extra-mental reality. On the other hand, we\ncould certainly have intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental\nobjects, if our concepts were particular things in the extra-mental\nworld as they exist extra-mentally \u2014 a final position Auriol\ncriticizes \u2014 but we would be unable to have necessary,\nscientific knowledge, Auriol\u2019s third explanatory requirement. In\nfact, we would be unable to make universal judgments of any kind,\nsince there would be nothing universal about our knowledge; instead of\nknowing that all mules are sterile, we would know only that this mule\nis sterile and that that mule is sterile.\n\nHaving considered all these views and found them wanting, Auriol\noffers his own alternative: the only way to explain at once essential\npredication, intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental objects, and\nnecessary, scientific knowledge is to maintain that concepts\nare extra-mental particulars, but having a different type of\nexistence (modus essendi) from the real existence they have\nextra-mentally. This special type of existence Auriol terms esse\napparens, apparent being, but he uses many synonyms for it,\nincluding \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d\nexistence. (For other synonyms, see Tachau 1988, p. 90.) What\ncharacterizes this type of existence is that it is a particular\nextra-mental object, e.g., Socrates, but indistinguishably mixed\ntogether (indistinguibiliter immiscetur) with\npassive conception, i.e. the formation of a concept of Socrates. A\nconcept of Socrates is Socrates as conceived.\n\nFor Auriol, Socrates and a concept grasping Socrates, then, are the\nsame thing with differing types of existence. That they are \u201cthe\nsame thing\u201d Auriol means quite literally. He says that \u201ca\nthing and its intention do not differ numerically with respect to\nanything absolute\u201d; they are the same thing strictly speaking.\nWhat thing and intention differ by is a respect or a relation. And\nthis is no ordinary respect \u201cfixed to or superimposed upon that\nthing, as are other relations, rather it is utterly intrinsic and\nindistinguishably joined to it.\u201d This intrinsic relation, Auriol\ntells us, is the appearance of the thing as an object of perception\n(apparere) to a perceiver (hence the term esse\napparens). For Auriol, then, it is intrinsic to each and every\nthing to have two different types of being: real or extra-mental being\non the one hand, and intentional or objective being on the other.\nUnlike real being, the thing\u2019s intentional being needs a\nperceiver in order to actualize it. This is only to say that it is\nthrough the act of conceiving that a thing is put into intentional\nbeing.\n\nIn fact \u2014 and here we return to conceptualism \u2014 on the\nbasis of what Auriol has said, we can deduce that every particular\nthing, e.g. Socrates, has several potential intentional existences:\none for each of Socrates\u2019 rationes, those basic units\nof intellectual acquaintance that direct the mind to form certain\nconcepts of him. And, according to Auriol, all of these different\nconcepts of Socrates are Socrates. On Auriol\u2019s account,\nthis makes good sense: rationes are quidditative or essential\naspects without which a particular thing would not be the particular\nthing that it in fact is. Thus, Socrates is not Socrates without being\na rational animal, i.e. without having the rationes\nsensitivity and rationality. Socrates is every bit as much a human\nbeing as he is Socrates, and on Auriol\u2019s theory the concept\n\u2018human being\u2019 is every bit as much Socrates as is the\nconcept \u2018Socrates\u2019. Thus upon intellectual acquaintance,\nSocrates (and in particular his ratio of rationality) directs\nus to form the concept \u2018human being\u2019, and that concept\nis Socrates, one of Socrates\u2019 several potential\nintentional existences.\n\nIn this way Auriol attempts to deal with the problems he saw in other\ntheories of concepts. On the one hand, he attempts to get our\nknowledge grounded as firmly as possible on extra-mental things: a\nconcept simply is the intellected extra-mental particular in\na different type of being from that which it has extra-mentally, a\ntype of being that is nevertheless intrinsic to the extra-mental\nparticular; the concept offers no barrier whatsoever between\nconceiving mind and conceived object. At the same time, however,\nAuriol wants to preserve the universality of universal concepts and\ntheir use in essential predications and necessary, scientific\nknowledge, and he thinks that his theory of concepts does just that.\nBecause rationes of the same kind found in different\nindividuals are \u201cmaximally similar,\u201d they all direct the\nmind to form the same concept. Thus the concept \u2018human\nbeing\u2019 arising from Socrates is the same as the concept\n\u2018human being\u2019 arising from Plato, since they are both\nbased on the maximally similar ratio of rationality. Auriol\nis clear that a universal concept is all of its particulars,\nrose is all particular roses, animal is all\nparticular animals. That is to say, animal is the concept and every\nreally existing animal at the same time.\n\nSensory Cognition (Wood 1982, pp. 214\u201317,\n220\u201323; Tachau 1988, pp. 89\u2013100; Denery 1998, pp.\n28\u201339; Li\u010dka 2016; Pickav\u00e9 2017; Bolyard 2021,\nsection 4.2.2): The intellect is not the only cognitive faculty that\nfunctions by putting the cognized thing into esse apparens:\nthe sensitive faculties also work in this way according to Auriol. In\nfact, Auriol uses sensory cognition, and his claim that the senses\nform esse apparens, as further proof that the intellect does\nso as well. In a famous passage in Auriol\u2019s works\n(Scriptum, d. 3, q. 3, a.1, ed. Buytaert, vol. 2, pp.\n696\u201399), one that was known to and criticized by William Ockham,\nAuriol creates an account of sensory cognition that takes its point of\ndeparture in a group of \u201cexperiences\u201d that Auriol thinks\nprove that the senses cognize by actively placing the object sensed in\nesse apparens. Thus, if someone were on a ship moving down a\nriver, it would appear to that person that the trees on the shore were\nmoving; when a baton is twirled extremely rapidly, it appears to the\nviewer that a colored circle hovers in the air; a stick placed halfway\ninto a bucket of water appears to be broken; if I press on my eye\nwhile looking at a candle, it will appear that I see two candles; upon\nlooking directly at the sun, an afterimage appears. Auriol gives eight\nexperiences like these, but for him all of them lead to the same\nconclusion: that in each of these cases, what appears to us\n(i.e. our erroneous perception) does not correspond directly to\nreality but is a result of the senses\u2019 putting the object into\nesse apparens. Take the case of the twirling baton: what is\nthe circle that appears in the air? It can\u2019t be anything real\nexisting in the baton itself, since the baton is straight. Nor,\nclearly, is the circle something real hovering in the air. Finally,\nthe circle is not something in vision or in the eye, since we are\nseeing the circle and not our vision of it, and also since the circle\nappears to be in the air. For Auriol, the only possible explanation\nfor the circle is that it appears to us because our sense of sight has\nactively put the baton into esse apparens. More generally,\nwhat we see in these cases is \u201conly the appearance of the thing\nor the thing in esse apparens.\u201d Sensory error, for\nAuriol, is explained by appealing to the fundamental activity of the\nsenses. And Auriol insists that the senses are just as active in cases\nwhere they function correctly; this is because, since activity is a\nnoble trait to have, if in erroneous visions our sense of sight\nactively places the thing seen in esse apparens, it will\ncertainly do so in veridical visions. The difference between a\nveridical sensory experience and an erroneous one is that in a\nveridical one the way the object of cognition appears and the\nway it is in extra-mental reality coincide. So in veridical\nsensory experience we have no way to tell that the senses are placing\nthe thing into esse apparens. Thus, these experiences of\nsensory error are of immense importance, since it is only through them\nthat we can discern the necessary role that esse apparens and\nthe activity of the senses play in all sensory cognition.\n\nFor Auriol, then, the senses necessarily put the cognized object into\nesse apparens or intentional being; this is a condition of\nour perceiving. Moreover, Auriol makes clear in this context that this\nesse apparens is not a representation of the thing with its\nown real being; rather it is the thing itself merely placed\nin another type of existence. The esse apparens of a sensed\nobject is merely that object as sensed. (See on this particularly\nDenery 1998, pp. 34\u201339.) Obviously, this corresponds to the\ntheory we have already seen Auriol holds concerning esse\napparens in intellectual cognition, and Auriol makes the\ncorrespondence explicit. To go from sensory perception to intellectual\ncognition, Auriol uses a common scholastic principle called by\nPhilotheus Boehner \u201cThe Principle of Hierarchy\u201d (Boehner\n1949, p. 298): given two faculties, one lower and one higher (like\nsense and intellect), if the lower faculty can do something noble,\nthen the higher faculty can certainly do the same. The activity of the\nsenses, then, i.e. the fact that the senses put the object into\nesse apparens, since it is noble, shows that the intellect\nalso puts its object into esse apparens. (Auriol\u2019s\ntheory of sensory perception is complicated by the fact that Auriol\nseems to claim that some of the illusory sensory experiences he\nmentions exist outside the mind, e.g., that the colored circle is\n\u201cin\u201d the air and not \u201cin\u201d the mind. For\napproaches to this complication, see Pasnau 1997, pp. 69\u201376;\nDenery 1998, pp. 36\u201337; Li\u010dka 2016).\n\nThree general claims can be made on the basis of this examination of\nAuriol\u2019s ideas on cognition and reality. First, Auriol is a\nconceptualist, holding that universals are nothing more than concepts\nformed by the mind, although these universal concepts do have a direct\nbasis in the particular thing cognized (the rationes).\nSecond, a principle underlying Auriol\u2019s theory of cognition is\nthat cognitive faculties are fundamentally active. All cognition takes\nplace because a cognitive faculty places the object of\ncognition into esse apparens, which is merely the object of\ncognition in a different type of being than it has extra-mentally, the\nbeing of being perceived. Thus, Auriol is part of one pronounced\nstrain of medieval thought (deriving from Augustine and ultimately\nfrom Plato) that rejects that the soul and its powers are passively\naffected by extra-mental objects. (See on this Tachau 1988, Friedman\n2000.) Cognitive powers are, for Auriol, active. A third point, and\none that has been noted in a great deal of the secondary literature\n(e.g., Tachau 1988; Denery 1998; Bolyard 2000; Friedman 2000) is that\nby appealing to erroneous visions to show that both sense and\nintellect produce esse apparens or make things appear, Auriol\nhas given error a central place in his account of cognition. To put\nthis in another way, Auriol does not have a real problem explaining\nhow we can have erroneous perception and intellection (in contrast to\nmany theories of knowledge); rather he needs to explain how we can\nhave veridical ones and just as importantly how we can know when we\nare having veridical ones. This is roughly one of the functions that\nthe distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition served for\nsome medieval authors (in e.g., John Duns Scotus and William Ockham),\nalthough as we will see, Auriol does not use it in this way. Indeed it\nseems best to describe Auriol as a \u201creliabilist,\u201d holding\nas a type of axiomatic principle that under normal circumstances our\nGod-given cognitive faculties represent the world in an adequate\nmanner. (See Bolyard 2000, p. 175; that Auriol is not the only\nmedieval thinker with this reliabilist attitude, see e.g., Stump 1998,\npp. 306\u201307.) No matter what Auriol thought, however, the\nskeptical implications of Auriol\u2019s theory of esse\napparens did worry many of his medieval readers, and the theory\nelicited a critical response because some thought that it posed too\nsharp a break between cognition and reality. (For examples, see Wood\n1982, Tachau 1988, Adriaenssen 2017b)\n4. Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition and the Limits of Human Cognitive Abilities\n\nJohn Duns Scotus, who introduced the distinction between intuitive and\nabstractive cognition, took the view that intuitive and abstractive\ncognition were distinct because they had different objects. Thus, for\nScotus, we have an abstractive cognition of an object when it is not\ndirectly present to us, on account of there being some intervening\nrepresentation; an intuitive cognition can only come about when the\nobject of cognition is existing and directly present to us. For\nScotus, then, intuitive cognition carries along with it the guarantee\nthat the object of cognition exists; not so for abstractive cognition.\n(See Tachau 1988, esp. pp. 68\u201381; Dumont 1989; Pini 2014.) It is\nwell known that William Ockham took exception to this view, holding\nthat we can, in certain extraordinary (i.e. supernatural) cases, have\nintuitive cognition of non-existent objects. Auriol too objects to\nScotus\u2019 view.\n\nFor Auriol, in contrast to Scotus, intuitive cognition is possible\nwhether the object of cognition is present or absent. Likewise, an\nabstractive cognition of an object that is actually present is\npossible. The distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition\ndoes not depend on the object at all; the very same object can be\ncognized in both an intuitive and an abstractive way. According to\nAuriol, whether we are having the one type of cognition or the other\ndepends exclusively on the characteristics of the cognition that we\nare having, how the object appears to us. Auriol says explicitly that\nintuitive and abstractive cognition are in fact simply two\nfundamentally different ways that the esse apparens created\nby the cognitive faculties can appear to us: \u201cabstractive and\nintuitive cognition differ \u2026 for there are two modes of formal\nappearance \u2026 by which things appear objectively\u201d (trans.\nPasnau 2002, p. 201, n. 111). In order to illustrate this, Auriol\nclaims that ocular cognition, i.e. the sense of sight, is fully\nintuitive, while imaginary cognition, i.e. cognizing something through\nthe internal sense of the imagination, is fully abstractive. This is\nthe governing metaphor in Auriol\u2019s attempt to distinguish the\ntwo types of cognition: sight is intuitive, imagination is\nabstractive. Thus, describing sensory cognition, Auriol gives four\ntraits that together enable us to determine whether any particular\ncognition is intuitive or abstractive. First, an intuitive cognition\nis characterized by being immediate or direct, as\nwhen we see an object before us. Not so abstractive or imaginary\ncognition; it is mediate, requiring some type of discursive process.\nAuriol gives the following example: an astronomer sitting in his room\ncan predict an eclipse through calculation, and he can even imagine it\non that basis, but this is something entirely different from seeing\nthe eclipse directly. A second characteristic of ocular or intuitive\ncognition is the presentness of the object. The object of an\nintuitive cognition seems to be present (whether it actually is or\nnot), whereas the object of an abstractive cognition does not have\nthis appearance of presence. Take the astronomer again. He can imagine\nthe eclipse, but in the very act of doing so he knows that the eclipse\nis not present before him. The third and fourth characteristics that\nAuriol mentions are roughly equivalent: an intuitive cognition carries\nwith it the actualization and existence of its\nobject; not so an imaginary, abstractive cognition. The astronomer can\nimagine an eclipse, and even imagine an eclipse taking place right\nnow, but again, the very fact that he is imagining the eclipse bears\nwith it the recognition that it is not in fact actualized and\nexisting. Auriol sums up:\n\nTherefore, it is rightly said that an intuitive cognition is a direct\ncognition as opposed to a discursive one, that it is present as\nopposed to the absent mode in which the imagination reaches even\ntoward things that are present, and that it actualizes the object and\nposits its existence, since it makes the object\u2019s real existence\nand actual position appear, even if the object does not exist. And in\ncontrast it is clear that an imaginary cognition lacks and abstracts\nfrom these four conditions. It extends to its object neither directly\nnor presently, nor by actualizing or positing existence, even if one\nimagines the object to exist and be actual and even if it is present.\n(trans. Pasnau 2002, pp. 206\u201307, n. 109).\n\n\n(The most complete discussion of Auriol on intuitive and abstractive\ncognition is Boehner 1949; for the background and reception of\nAuriol\u2019s view, see particularly Tachau 1988; for a translation\ninto English of Auriol\u2019s major text on intuitive and abstractive\ncognition, his Scriptum, Prologue (aka Prooemium), q. 2, see\nPasnau 2002, pp. 178\u2013218.)\n\nThus, what is central to Auriol\u2019s distinction between intuitive\nand abstractive cognition is the character of the cognition as it\nappears to us. The distinction between them is phenomenologically\ndetermined. As mentioned above, in this way Auriol rejected\nScotus\u2019 view that intuitive cognitions are only of objects\npresent and existing. Auriol\u2019s rejection of Scotus\u2019\ndistinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition takes as one\nof its starting points several \u201cexperiences\u201d that recall\nthe experiences he employed to show that the senses put the object of\nsensitive cognition into esse apparens. For example, upon\nlooking directly at the sun or any other luminous object, an\nafterimage appears; thus a vision of the sun remains in the eye even\nwhen the object itself is absent. In dreams, we can experience sights,\nsounds, and tactile sensations, in the real absence of the objects of\nsensation. Persons who are deceived by illusions often see things that\nare not really there. In all of these sensations the object appears to\nbe actually present and existing, when it is not. Auriol concludes\nthat we can have an intuitive sensory cognition of non-existent\nobjects.\n\nThat was the characterization of intuitive sensory cognition\nas opposed to abstractive cognition. What about intellectual\ncognition? Auriol makes clear that the human intellect can have\nintuitive cognition. To show this he first appeals to the Principle of\nHierarchy mentioned above: because the lower faculties, the senses,\ncan have intuitive cognition, therefore it is certain that the higher\nfaculty, intellect, can have intuitive cognition, since it is more\nnoble than the abstractive cognition that we know the intellect does\nhave. Moreover, on the basis of a famous passage from St. Paul\u2019s\nI Corinthians (13:12 \u201cFor now we see in a mirror dimly,\nbut then face to face\u201d), Auriol maintains that we are assured\nthat the beatific vision of God is an intuitive intellectual\ncognition.\n\nAlthough intuitive cognition is possible for an intellect,\nAuriol, in contrast to William Ockham, nevertheless denies that we\nexperience intuitive cognition in this life. Because the\nintellect of the wayfarer (viator \u2014 the person in this\nlife) is dependent upon the senses and their cognition of particulars,\nAuriol denies that we can have (or at least that we can know that we\nhave) intellectual cognition with the direct and present, ocular-like\ncognition that is characteristic of intuitive cognition. Auriol says:\n\u201cThus each of these cognitions should be posited within\nintellect, although we do not experience intuitive cognition in this\nlife because of its conjunction with sensory intuition\u201d (trans.\nPasnau 2002, pp. 210\u201311, n. 121.) Intuitive intellectual\ncognition is reserved for the angels and for the blessed in heaven,\nunencumbered by bodily senses. All of our intellectual cognition in\nthis life is characterized by the discursivity and mediacy that is the\nmark of an abstractive cognition.\n\nAbove, it was mentioned that Auriol seems ultimately to be best\ndescribed as a reliabilist; he does not question that, given normal\nconditions, our God-given cognitive faculties work as they should and\nthat they are self-correcting. He does not seem to have been concerned\nabout possible skeptical ramifications of his theory of esse\napparens. But with this said, by denying that human beings in\nthis life have intuitive intellectual cognition, he set the stage for\nsomewhat strictly limiting human intellectual abilities in his\nphilosophy.\n\nThis last point explains some interesting features of Auriol\u2019s\nattitude towards human knowledge. In particular, despite the fact that\nAuriol maintains that God could give a person in this life an\nabstractive cognition of the divine essence, and that this abstractive\ncognition would be able to serve as the basis for demonstrative\nknowledge of all articles of the Christian faith (Scriptum,\nPrologue, q. 2, ed. Buytaert, vol. 1, pp. 211\u201314; trans. Pasnau\n2002, p. 213, n. 130 and p. 214, n. 133), nevertheless Auriol often\nexhibits a noticeable pessimism when it comes to human cognitive\nabilities. Thus, Auriol argues at length that in this life we are\nunable to decide such issues as whether the universe is eternal or\ncreated in time. (We know, of course, through Scripture that the world\nis not eternal, but we could never decisively prove this by means of\nunaided human reason.) Auriol argues that this is the case because we\ndo not have direct intellectual cognition of, e.g., temporal instants;\nsuch cognition would allow us to resolve this problem. (See esp.\nNielsen 1996, esp. pp. 223\u201326, 232\u201335, 239\u201341; see\nalso Nielsen 1999.) Here we see that Auriol\u2019s rejection of\nintuitive intellectual cognition in this life lies at the heart of a\nsomewhat pessimistic view of the reach of human reason: we do not have\ndirect intuitive knowledge of the world (much less of God), only\nindirect abstractive knowledge, and this places fairly strict\nlimitations on just what our intellect can achieve unaided. The\ndisembodied soul of the blessed, having direct intuitive intellectual\ncognition, will fare much better.\n\nAuriol\u2019s theory of human intellectual cognition of singulars\nalso shows the influence of his rejection of intuitive intellectual\ncognition in this life. Auriol is explicit that universal concepts\n(formed through the Aristotelian process of abstraction) always appear\nto us as abstractive cognitions, since what is universal abstracts\nfrom any presentness and directness of the object of cognition (see\ne.g. Scriptum, Prologue, q. 2, ed. Buytaert, p. 206, n. 111,\nl. 87, Pasnau 2002, p. 207; cf. Friedman 1997, pp. 310\u201314).\nThere were, however, a number of members of the Franciscan order,\nincluding John Duns Scotus, who was sometimes understood by\ncontemporaries to have claimed that singulars could be cognized as\nsingular by the intellect. (On this aspect of Scotus thought see,\ne.g., Boler 1982, esp. Pini 2008.) Auriol rejects this Franciscan\ntradition; because true intuitive intellectual cognition is barred to\nus in this lifetime, we can have no direct intellectual cognition of\nsingulars at all. Auriol maintains in his theory of intellectual\ncognition of singulars that we only form concepts of singulars through\nthe mediation of the senses and by means of a discursive process. (By\nrecognizing that the senses are now sensing a singular, the intellect\ncan reason that a singular must now exist and be present, but we have\nno direct intellectual knowledge or concept of any singular.) Auriol\nexplicitly claims, however, that angels and the blessed, lacking\nbodies and bodily senses, would have direct intellectual cognition of\nsingulars, just as God does by seeing his own essence. (On\nAuriol\u2019s theory, see Friedman 2000.) A mild pessimism about\nhuman cognitive abilities is thus systemic in Auriol\u2019s thought,\nand has its most clear expression in his claim that we do not\nexperience intuitive intellectual cognition in this life.\n",
