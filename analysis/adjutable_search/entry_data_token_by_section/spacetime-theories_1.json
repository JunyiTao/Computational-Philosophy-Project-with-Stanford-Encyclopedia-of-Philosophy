    "main_text": "Mach || Two Interpretations of Mach on Inertia\n1.1 Two Interpretations of Mach on Inertia\n\nBoth in Mach\u2019s interpretations of Newton\u2019s arguments and\nin his replies, one can already see two anti-absolute space viewpoints\nemerge, though Mach himself never fully kept them apart. The first\nstrain, which we may call \u2018Mach-lite\u2019, criticizes\nNewton\u2019s postulation of absolute space as a metaphysical leap\nthat is neither justified by actual experiments, nor methodologically\nsound. The remedy offered by Mach-lite is simple: we should retain\nNewton\u2019s mechanics and use it just as we already do, but\neliminate the unnecessary posit of absolute space. In its place we\nneed only substitute the reference frame of the fixed stars, as is the\npractice in astronomy in any case. If we find the incorporation of a\nreference to contingent circumstances (the existence of a single\nreference frame in which the stars are more or less stationary) in the\nfundamental laws of nature problematic (which Mach need not, given his\nofficial positivist account of scientific laws), then Mach suggests\nthat we replace the 1st law with an empirically equivalent\nmathematical rival, such as this one:\n\nMach\u2019s Equation (1960, 287)\n\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 (\\frac{\\Sigma mr}{\\Sigma m})}{dt^2} = 0 \\]\n\n\n\nIn this equation the sums are to be taken over all massive bodies in\nthe universe. Since the top sum is weighted by distance, distant\nmasses count much more than near ones. In a world with a (reasonably)\nstatic distribution of heavy distant bodies, such as we appear to live\nin, the equation entails that the velocity of a free body will be\nconstant (to an extremely good approximation) in precisely those\nframes that we already consider to be \u2018inertial\u2019 frames.\nThe upshot of this equation is that the frame of the fixed stars plays\nthe role of absolute space in the statement of the 1st law. This\nproposal does not, by itself, offer an alternative to Newtonian\nmechanics, and as Mach himself pointed out, the law is not\nwell-behaved in an infinite universe filled with stars; but the same\ncan perhaps be said of Newton\u2019s law of gravitation (see Malament\n1995, and Norton 1993). But Mach did not offer this equation as a\nproposed law valid in any circumstances; he avers, \u201cit is\nimpossible to say whether the new expression would still represent the\ntrue condition of things if the stars were to perform rapid movements\namong one another.\u201d (p. 289)\n\nIt is not clear whether Mach offered this revised first law as a first\nstep toward a theory that would replace Newton\u2019s mechanics,\nderiving inertial effects from only relative motions, as Leibniz\ndesired. But many other remarks made by Mach in his chapter\ncriticizing absolute space point in this direction, and they have\ngiven birth to the Mach-heavy view, later to be christened\n\u201cMach\u2019s Principle\u201d by Albert\n Einstein.[2]\n The Mach-heavy viewpoint calls for a new mechanics that invokes only\nrelative distances and (perhaps) their 1st and 2nd time derivatives,\nand thus is \u2018generally relativistic\u2019 in the sense\nsometimes read into Leibniz\u2019s remarks about motion (see\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 6). Mach wished to eliminate absolute time from physics too,\nso he would have wanted a proper relationist reduction of these\nderivatives also. The Barbour-Bertotti theories, discussed below,\nprovide this.\n\nMach-heavy apparently involves the prediction of novel effects due to\n\u2018merely\u2019 relative accelerations. Mach hints at such\neffects in his criticism of Newton\u2019s bucket:\n\nNewton\u2019s experiment with the rotating vessel of water simply\ninforms us that the relative rotation of the water with respect to the\nsides of the vessel produces no noticeable centrifugal forces, but\nthat such forces are produced by its relative rotation with respect to\nthe mass of the earth and the other celestial bodies. No one is\ncompetent to say how the experiment would turn out if the sides of the\nvessel [were] increased until they were ultimately several leagues\nthick. (1883, 284)\n\n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that the relative rotation in stage\n(i) of the experiment might immediately generate an outward force\n(before any rotation is communicated to the water), if the sides of\nthe bucket were massive enough. (Note that this response could not\nhave been made by Leibniz \u2013 even if he had wanted to defend\nMachian relationism \u2013 because it involves action at a distance\nbetween the water and the parts of the bucket, something he regarded\nas a metaphysical absurdity.)\n\n\n\nMach\u2019s thick-sided bucket\n\n\nMore generally, Mach-heavy involves the view that all inertial effects\nshould be derived from the motions of the body in question relative to\nall other massive bodies in the universe. The water in Newton\u2019s\nbucket feels an outward pull due (mainly) to the relative rotation of\nall the fixed stars around it. Mach-heavy is a speculation that an\neffect something like electromagnetic induction should be built into\ngravity theory. (Such an effect does exist according to the General\nTheory of Relativity, and is called \u2018gravitomagnetic\ninduction\u2019. The Gravity Probe B mission was designed to measure\na gravitomagnetic induction effect on orbiting gyroscopes due to the\nEarth\u2019s rotation.) Its specific form must fall off with distance\nmuch more slowly than \\(1/r^2\\), if the theory is to be empirically\nsimilar to Newtonian physics; but it will certainly predict\nexperimentally testable novel behaviors. A theory that satisfies all\nthe goals of Mach-heavy would appear to be ideal for the vindication\nof strict relationism and the elimination of absolute quantities of\nmotion from mechanics.\n",
