    "main_text": "Ethics || Ethics as Care of the Self\n4.1 Ethics as Care of the Self\n\nAstell can be read as part of a long-standing ethical tradition that\nis focused on the self and how it relates to its own moral agency.\nThis has been described recently by Hadot and Foucault as\n\u201cphilosophy as a way of life.\u201d Like philosophers in this\ntradition, Astell focuses on the self and its condition (see sections\n1.3, 3.1), articulates spiritual practices that the self can use to\nfurther its relationship with truth (see sections 3.1, 3.2), offers\nways for the self to critique social customs (see section 2.1), and\nattends to ways the self can continue to grow in freedom from\ndomination (see section 3). In philosophizing in this manner, Astell\nis steeped in Christian theology and the traditions of monasticism.\n(See Webb 2020 for a reading of Astell as a \u201ccare of the\nself\u201d philosopher; see Kendrick 2018 for a reading of Astell as\ninformed by Christian theology.)\n",
