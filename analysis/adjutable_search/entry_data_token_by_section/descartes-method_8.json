The Method in Optics: Deducing the Law of Refraction\n\nDescartes\u2019 discovery of the law of refraction is arguably one of\nhis most celebrated scientific achievements. We have already\nencountered the law of refraction in Descartes\u2019 discussion of\nthe anaclastic line in Rule 8 (see\n Section 3).\n There, the law of refraction appears as the solution to the\npenultimate problem, \u201cWhat is the relation (ratio) between the\nangle of incidence and the angle of refraction?\u201d We also learned\nthat the law of refraction depends on two other problems, \u201cWhat\nis a natural power?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the action of\nlight?\u201d In Rules, Descartes proposes solving the problem of what a natural power is by means of intuition, and he recommends solving the problem of what the action of light consists in by means of deduction or by means of an analogy with other, more familiar natural powers. In Rule 9, analogizes the action of light to the motion of a stick. Similarly,\nin Optics II, Descartes deduces the law of refraction from\nanalogies (or comparisons) and suppositions about the reflection and\nrefraction of light. As in Rule 9, the first comparison analogizes the\naction of light to the transmission of motion from one end of a stick\nto another, and is meant to illustrate how light travels\ninstantaneously from one part of space to another:\n\n\nI would have you consider the light in bodies we call\n\u201cluminous\u201d to be nothing other than a certain movement, or\nvery rapid and lively action, which passes to our eyes through the\nmedium of the air and other transparent bodies, just as the movement\nor resistance of the bodies encountered by a blind man passes to his\nhand by means of a stick. (AT 7: 84, CSM 1: 153)\n\n\nWhen a blind person employs a stick in order to learn about their\nsurroundings, they do so via the pressure they receive in their hands\nwhen the stick encounters an object. This resistance or pressure is\ninstantaneously transmitted from the end of the stick in contact with\nthe object to the hand. Light, Descartes argues, is transmitted from\nthe luminous objects to the eye in the same way: it is an\ninstantaneous pressure exerted on the eye by the luminous object via\nthe medium (e.g., air). The length of the stick or of the distance\nbetween the sun (or any other luminous object) and our eyes does not\nmatter, so long as (1) the particles of matter between our hand and\nthe end of the stick or our eye and the sun are continuous, and (2) the\npressure coming from the end of the stick or the luminous object is\nsufficiently strong to affect our hand or eye, so that whatever\nhappens at one end is instantaneously communicated to the other end\n(AT 7: 84, CSM 1: 153).\n\nDescartes\u2019 second comparison analogizes (1) the medium in which\nlight travels to a wine-vat (or barrel) completely filled with\nhalf-pressed grapes and wine, and (2) the action of light in this\nmedium to the tendency of the wine to move in a straight line towards\nholes located at the bottom of the vat:\n\n\nThe parts of the wine at one place tend to go down in a straight line\nthrough one hole at the very instant it is opened [\u2026]. In the\nsame way, all the parts of the subtle matter [of which light is\ncomposed] in contact with the side of the sun facing us tend in a\nstraight line towards our eyes at the very instant [our eyes] are\nopened [\u2026] (AT 7: 87\u201388, CSM 1: 154\u2013155).\n\n\nThis comparison illustrates an important distinction between actual\nmotion from one part of space to another and the mere tendency to\nmotion. Just as all the parts of the wine in the vat tend to move in a\nstraight line toward the holes at the bottom of the vat, so too light\nis simply a tendency the smallest parts of matter between our eyes and\nthe sun (or any other luminous object) have to move in a straight line\ntoward our eye. The space between our eyes and any luminous object is\nso crammed that the smallest parts of matter cannot actually travel\nfrom the luminous object to our eye. Instead, their\n\u201caction\u201d consists in the tendency they have to move\ntowards our eyes. This tendency exerts pressure on our eye, and this pressure,\nwhen communicated to the brain via the nerves, produces the sensation\nof light in the mind.\n\nThe third comparison illustrates how light behaves when its\nrectilinear tendency to motion (its tendency to move in a straight\nline) is affected by other bodies in reflection and refraction:\n\n\nBut when [light rays] meet certain other bodies, they are liable to be\ndeflected by them, or weakened, in the same way that the movement of a\nball or stone thrown into the air is deflected by the bodies it\nencounters. For it is very easy to believe that the action or tendency\nto move (which, I have said, should be taken for light) must in this\nrespect obey the same laws as motion itself. (AT 7: 88\u201389,\nCSM 1: 155)\n\n\nJust as the motion of a ball can be affected by the bodies it\nencounters, so too can light be affected by the bodies it encounters.\nDepending on how these bodies are themselves physically constituted,\nthey either reflect or refract light. Soft bodies, such as a linen\nsheets, sand, or mud \u201ccompletely stop the ball and check its\nmovement\u201d, while hard bodies simply \u201csend the ball in\nanother direction without stopping it\u201d (AT 7: 89, CSM 1: 155).\nSince the tendency to motion obeys the same laws as motion itself,\nDescartes demonstrates the law of refraction by comparing refracted\nlight to the motion of a tennis ball before and after it punctures a\nlinen sheet \n\n\nso thin and finely woven that the ball has enough force to puncture it\nand pass right through, losing only some of its speed (say, a half) in\ndoing so. (AT 7: 97, CSM 1: 158; see\n Fig. 2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Descartes\u2019 tennis-ball\nmodel of refraction (AT 6: 98, CSM 1: 159, D1637: 11 (view 95)). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nNot every property of the tennis-ball model is relevant to the action\nof light, and those that are not relevant can be excluded from\nconsideration. We can leave aside \n\n\nentirely the question of the power which continues to move [the ball]\nwhen it is no longer in contact with the racquet, and without\nconsidering any effect of its weight, size, or shape [\u2026] since\nnone of these factors is involved in the action of light. (AT 7:\n93\u201394, CSM 1: 157) \n\n\nSecond, it is necessary to distinguish between the force \u201cwhich\ncauses the ball to continue moving\u201d on the one hand, and\n\u201cthat which determines it to move in one direction rather than\nthe other\u201d on the other, since \u201cthis same force could have\nmade it move in any other direction\u201d (AT 7: 94, CSM 1: 157).\nConversely, the ball could have been determined to move in the same\ndirection \u201ceven if a different force had moved it\u201d\n(ibid.). Third, we can divide the direction of the ball into two\nprincipal components, which determine its direction: a perpendicular\ncomponent (line AC) and a parallel component (line AH) (see\n Fig. 2\n above). The ball must be imagined as moving down the perpendicular\nline at the same time as it moves across the parallel line (left to\nright), and these two components determine its actual\ndirection along the diagonal (line AB). Descartes terms these components parts of the \u201cdetermination\u201d of the ball because they specify its direction. Determinations are directed physical magnitudes. As we will see below, they specify the direction of the ball, and they can be independently affected in physical interactions.\n\nDescartes proceeds to deduce the law of refraction. The ball is struck\nby the racquet at A and moves along AB until it strikes the sheet at\nB. Where will the ball land after it strikes the sheet? Descartes\nstipulates that the sheet reduces the speed of the ball by half.\nConsequently, it will take the ball twice as long to reach the\ncircumference of the circle after impact than it did for the ball to\nreach the surface at B. We also know that the determination of the\nball in direction AB is composed of two parts, a perpendicular\ncomponent determination (AC) and a parallel component determination (AH). Descartes reasons that\n\n\n\nonly the one [component determination] which was making the ball tend in a downward\ndirection [AC] can be changed in any way through its colliding with\nthe sheet, while the one which was making the ball tend to the right\n[AH] must always remain the same as it was, because the sheet offers\nno opposition at all to the determination in this direction. (AT 7:\n97, CSM 1: 159) \n\n\nTo understand Descartes\u2019 reasoning here, the parallel component\ndetermination AH must be regarded as simply continuing along its initial path\nbecause it does not come into contact with the surface of the sheet.\nTo where must AH be extended? Since the ball has lost half of its\ninitial speed and consequently will take twice as long to reach the\ncircumference of the circle after impact, we double the length of AH\nby extending it to F. The ball must, therefore, land somewhere on the\nline dropped from F, but since it cannot land above the surface, it\nmust land somewhere below CBE. It lands precisely where the line\ndropped from F intersects the circle at I (ibid.). Once we have I, we\nextend AB to I. Descartes observes that the degree of refraction\n\u201cvaries exactly in proportion to the varying degrees of\npenetrability of the respective bodies\u201d (AT 7: 101, CSM 1: 161).\nHe insists, however, that the quantities that should be compared to\none another in this proportion are not the angles ABH and IBE\nthemselves (the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively),\n\u201cfor the ratio or proportion between these angles varies with\nall the different inclinations of the rays\u201d (ibid.). In other\nwords, the angles of incidence and refraction do not vary according to\nany determinable proportion. Instead of comparing the angles to one\nanother, Descartes compares the lines AH and HF (the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively), and sees\nthat the proportion between these lines is that of 1/2, a ratio that\nall refractions between these two media, whatever the angles of\nincidence and refraction, must obey. Since the lines AH and HF are the\nsines of the angles, Descartes\u2019 law of refraction is oftentimes\nreferred to as the \u201csine law\u201d. \n\n\\[\\sin i = n \\sin r \\]\n\n\nThe sine of the angle of incidence i is equal to the sine of\nthe angle of refraction r multiplied by a constant n\ndefined by the nature of the refractive medium (in the example\ndiscussed above, the constant defined by the sheet is 1/2 , so AH =\n1/2 HF).\n\nMany commentators have raised questions about Descartes\u2019\ndeduction of the sine law (see, e.g., Schuster 2013: 178\u2013184).\nFor example, what physical meaning do the parallel and perpendicular\ncomponent determinations (lines AH and AC) have? Is it really the case that the\nspeed of the ball is reduced only at the surface of impact, and not\nafter (see Schuster 2013: 180\u2013181)? In water, it would seem that the speed of the ball is reduced as it penetrates further into the medium. These and other questions\ncannot be examined in detail here. From a methodological point of\nview, Descartes insists that the law of refraction can be deduced from\nthe comparisons and suppositions he employs in Optics II (see letter to\nMersenne, 27 May 1638, AT 2: 142\u2013143, CSM 1: 103), and as we have seen, in both Rule 8 and Discourse IV he claims that he can demonstrate these suppositions from the principles of physics.\n",
