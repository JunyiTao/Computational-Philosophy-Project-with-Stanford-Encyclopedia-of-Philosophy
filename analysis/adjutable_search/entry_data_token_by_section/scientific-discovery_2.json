Discussions concerned the nature of\nobservations and experiments, the act of having an insight and the\nprocesses of articulating, developing, and testing the novel insight.\nPhilosophical discussion focused on the question of whether and to\nwhat extent rules could be devised to guide each of these\nprocesses.\n\nNumerous 19th-century scholars contributed to these\ndiscussions, including Claude Bernard, Auguste Comte, George Gore,\nJohn Herschel, W. Stanley Jevons, Justus von Liebig, John Stuart Mill,\nand Charles Sanders Peirce, to name only a few. William\nWhewell\u2019s work, especially the two volumes of Philosophy of\nthe Inductive Sciences of 1840, is a noteworthy and, later, much\ndiscussed contribution to the philosophical debates about scientific\ndiscovery because he explicitly distinguished the creative moment or\n\u201chappy thought\u201d as he called it from other elements of\nscientific inquiry and because he offered a detailed analysis of the\n\u201cdiscoverer\u2019s induction\u201d, i.e., the pursuit and\nevaluation of the new insight. Whewell\u2019s approach is not unique,\nbut for late 20th-century philosophers of science, his\ncomprehensive, historically informed philosophy of discovery became a\npoint of orientation in the revival of interest in scientific\ndiscovery processes.\n\nFor Whewell, discovery comprised three elements: the happy thought,\nthe articulation and development of that thought, and the testing or\nverification of it. His account was in part a description of the\npsychological makeup of the discoverer. For instance, he held that\nonly geniuses could have those happy thoughts that are essential to\ndiscovery. In part, his account was an account of the methods by which\nhappy thoughts are integrated into the system of knowledge. According\nto Whewell, the initial step in every discovery is what he called\n\u201csome happy thought, of which we cannot trace the origin; some\nfortunate cast of intellect, rising above all rules. No maxims can be\ngiven which inevitably lead to discovery\u201d (Whewell 1996 [1840]:\n186). An \u201cart of discovery\u201d in the sense of a teachable\nand learnable skill does not exist according to Whewell. The happy\nthought builds on the known facts, but according to Whewell it is\nimpossible to prescribe a method for having happy thoughts.\n\nIn this sense, happy thoughts are accidental. But in an important\nsense, scientific discoveries are not accidental. The happy\nthought is not a wild guess. Only the person whose mind is prepared to\nsee things will actually notice them. The \u201cprevious condition of\nthe intellect, and not the single fact, is really the main and\npeculiar cause of the success. The fact is merely the occasion by\nwhich the engine of discovery is brought into play sooner or later. It\nis, as I have elsewhere said, only the spark which discharges a gun\nalready loaded and pointed; and there is little propriety in speaking\nof such an accident as the cause why the bullet hits its mark.\u201d\n(Whewell 1996 [1840]: 189).\n\nHaving a happy thought is not yet a discovery, however. The second\nelement of a scientific discovery consists in binding\ntogether\u2014\u201ccolligating\u201d, as Whewell called it\u2014a\nset of facts by bringing them under a general conception. Not only\ndoes the colligation produce something new, but it also shows the\npreviously known facts in a new light. Colligation involves, on the\none hand, the specification of facts through systematic observation,\nmeasurements and experiment, and on the other hand, the clarification\nof ideas through the exposition of the definitions and axioms that are\ntacitly implied in those ideas. This process is extended and\niterative. The scientists go back and forth between binding together\nthe facts, clarifying the idea, rendering the facts more exact, and so\nforth.\n\nThe final part of the discovery is the verification of the colligation\ninvolving the happy thought. This means, first and foremost, that the\noutcome of the colligation must be sufficient to explain the data at\nhand. Verification also involves judging the predictive power,\nsimplicity, and \u201cconsilience\u201d of the outcome of the\ncolligation. \u201cConsilience\u201d refers to a higher range of\ngenerality (broader applicability) of the theory (the articulated and\nclarified happy thought) that the actual colligation produced.\nWhewell\u2019s account of discovery is not a deductivist system. It\nis essential that the outcome of the colligation be inferable from the\ndata prior to any testing (Snyder 1997).\n\nWhewell\u2019s theory of discovery clearly separates three elements:\nthe non-analyzable happy thought or eureka moment; the process of\ncolligation which includes the clarification and explication of facts\nand ideas; and the verification of the outcome of the colligation. His\nposition that the philosophy of discovery cannot prescribe how to\nthink happy thoughts has been a key element of 20th-century\nphilosophical reflection on discovery. In contrast to many\n20th-century approaches, Whewell\u2019s philosophical\nconception of discovery also comprises the processes by which the\nhappy thoughts are articulated. Similarly, the process of verification\nis an integral part of discovery. The procedures of articulation and\ntest are both analyzable according to Whewell, and his\nconception of colligation and verification serve as guidelines for how\nthe discoverer should proceed. To verify a hypothesis, the\ninvestigator needs to show that it accounts for the known facts, that\nit foretells new, previously unobserved phenomena, and that it can\nexplain and predict phenomena which are explained and predicted by a\nhypothesis that was obtained through an independent happy\nthought-cum-colligation (Ducasse 1951).\n\nWhewell\u2019s conceptualization of scientific discovery offers a\nuseful framework for mapping the philosophical debates about discovery\nand for identifying major issues of concern in 20th-century\nphilosophical debates. Until the late 20th century, most\nphilosophers operated with a notion of discovery that is narrower than\nWhewell\u2019s. In more recent treatments of discovery, however, the\nscope of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d is limited to either the\nfirst of these elements, the \u201chappy thought\u201d, or to the\nhappy thought and its initial articulation. In the narrower\nconception, what Whewell called \u201cverification\u201d is not part\nof discovery proper. Secondly, until the late 20th century,\nthere was wide agreement that the eureka moment, narrowly construed,\nis an unanalyzable, even mysterious leap of insight. The main\ndisagreements concerned the question of whether the process of\ndeveloping a hypothesis (the \u201ccolligation\u201d in\nWhewell\u2019s terms) is, or is not, a part of discovery proper\n\u2013 and if it is, whether and how this process is guided by rules.\nMuch of the controversies in the 20th century about the\npossibility of a philosophy of discovery can be understood against the\nbackground of the disagreement about whether the process of discovery\ndoes or does not include the articulation and development of a novel\nthought. Philosophers also disagreed on the issue of whether it is a\nphilosophical task to explicate these rules.\n\nIn early 20th-century logical empiricism, the view that\ndiscovery is or at least crucially involves a non-analyzable creative\nact of a gifted genius was widespread. Alternative conceptions of\ndiscovery especially in the pragmatist tradition emphasize that\ndiscovery is an extended process, i.e., that the discovery process\nincludes the reasoning processes through which a new insight is\narticulated and further developed.\n",
