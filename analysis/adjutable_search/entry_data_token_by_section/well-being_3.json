    "main_text": "Theories of Well-being || Hedonism\n4.1 Hedonism\n\nOn one view, human beings always act in pursuit of what they think\nwill give them the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. This is\n\u2018psychological hedonism\u2019, and will not be my concern here.\nRather, I intend to discuss \u2018evaluative hedonism\u2019 or\n\u2018prudential hedonism\u2019, according to which well-being\nconsists in the greatest balance of pleasure over pain.\n\nThis view was first, and perhaps most famously, expressed by Socrates\nand Protagoras in the Platonic dialogue, Protagoras (Plato\n1976 [C4 BCE], 351b\u2013c). Jeremy Bentham, one of the most\nwell-known of the more recent hedonists, begins his Introduction\nto the Principles of Morals and Legislation thus: \u2018Nature\nhas placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters,\npain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out\nwhat we ought to do\u2019.\n\nIn answer to the question, \u2018What does well-being consist\nin?\u2019, then, the hedonist will answer, \u2018The greatest\nbalance of pleasure over pain\u2019. We might call this\nsubstantive hedonism. A complete hedonist position will\ninvolve also explanatory hedonism, which consists in an\nanswer to the following question: \u2018What makes pleasure\ngood, and pain bad?\u2019, that answer being, \u2018The pleasantness\nof pleasure, and the painfulness of pain\u2019. Consider a\nsubstantive hedonist who believed that what makes pleasure good for us\nis that it fulfills our nature. This theorist is not an explanatory\nhedonist.\n\nHedonism\u2014as is demonstrated by its ancient roots\u2014has long\nseemed an obviously plausible view. Well-being, what is good\nfor me, might be thought to be naturally linked to what seems\ngood to me, and pleasure does, to most people, seem good. And\nhow could anything else benefit me except in so far as I enjoy\nit? \n\nThe simplest form of hedonism is Bentham\u2019s, according to which\nthe more pleasantness one can pack into one\u2019s life, the better\nit will be, and the more painfulness one encounters, the worse it will\nbe. How do we measure the value of the two experiences? The two\ncentral aspects of the respective experiences, according to Bentham,\nare their duration, and their intensity.\n\nBentham tended to think of pleasure and pain as a kind of sensation,\nas the notion of intensity might suggest. One problem with this kind\nof hedonism, it has often been claimed, is that there does not appear\nto be a single common strand of pleasantness running through all the\ndifferent experiences people enjoy, such as eating hamburgers, reading\nShakespeare, or playing water polo. Rather, it seems, there are\ncertain experiences we want to continue, and we might be prepared to\ncall these\u2014for philosophical purposes\u2014pleasures (even\nthough some of them, such as diving in a very deep and narrow cave,\nfor example, would not normally be described as pleasurable).\n\nHedonism could survive this objection merely by incorporating whatever\nview of pleasure was thought to be plausible. A more serious objection\nis to the evaluative stance of hedonism itself. Thomas Carlyle, for\nexample, described the hedonistic component of utilitarianism as the\n\u2018philosophy of swine\u2019, the point being that simple\nhedonism places all pleasures on a par, whether they be the lowest\nanimal pleasures of sex or the highest of aesthetic appreciation. One\nmight make this point with a thought experiment. Imagine that you are\ngiven the choice of living a very fulfilling human life, or that of a\nbarely sentient oyster, which experiences some very low-level\npleasure. Imagine also that the life of the oyster can be as long as\nyou like, whereas the human life will be of eighty years only. If\nBentham were right, there would have to be a length of oyster life\nsuch that you would choose it in preference to the human. And yet many\nsay that they would choose the human life in preference to an oyster\nlife of any length.\n\nNow this is not a knockdown argument against simple hedonism. Indeed\nsome people are ready to accept that at some length or other the\noyster life becomes preferable. But there is an alternative to simple\nhedonism, outlined famously by J.S. Mill, using his distinction\n(itself influenced by Plato\u2019s discussion of pleasure at the end\nof his Republic (Plato 1992 [C4 BCE], 582d-583a)) between\n\u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 pleasures (1863 [1998],\nch. 2). Mill added a third property to the two determinants of value\nidentified by Bentham, duration and intensity. To distinguish it from\nthese two \u2018quantitative\u2019 properties, Mill called his third\nproperty \u2018quality\u2019. The claim is that some pleasures, by\ntheir very nature, are more valuable than others. For example, the\npleasure of reading Shakespeare, by its very nature, is more valuable\nthan any amount of basic animal pleasure. And we can see this, Mill\nsuggests, if we note that those who have experienced both types, and\nare \u2018competent judges\u2019, will make their choices on this\nbasis.\n\nA long-standing objection to Mill\u2019s move here has been to claim\nthat his position can no longer be described as hedonism proper (or\nwhat I have called \u2018explanatory hedonism\u2019). If higher\npleasures are higher because of their nature, that aspect of their\nnature cannot be pleasantness, since that could be determined by\nduration and intensity alone. And Mill anyway speaks of properties\nsuch as \u2018nobility\u2019 as adding to the value of a pleasure.\nNow it has to be admitted that Mill is sailing close to the wind here.\nBut there is logical space for a hedonist position which allows\nproperties such as nobility to determine pleasantness, and insists\nthat only pleasantness determines value. But one might well wonder how\nnobility could affect pleasantness, and why Mill did not just come out\nwith the idea that nobility is itself a good-making property.\n\nAbove I noted the plausibility of the claim that nothing can benefit\nme if I don\u2019t enjoy it. Some non-hedonists have denied this,\nwhile accepting the so-called \u2018experience requirement\u2019 on\nwell-being. They suggest that what matters is valuable\nconsciousness, and consciousness can be valuable for non-hedonic\nreasons (see Kraut 2018; Kriegel 2019). But there is a yet more weighty\nobjection both to hedonism and to the view that well-being\nconsists only in conscious states: the so-called \u2018experience\nmachine\u2019. Imagine that I have a machine that I could plug you\ninto for the rest of your life. This machine would give you\nexperiences of whatever kind you thought most valuable or\nenjoyable\u2014writing a great novel, bringing about world peace,\nattending an early Rolling Stones\u2019 gig. You would not know you\nwere on the machine, and there is no worry about its breaking down or\nwhatever. Would you plug in? Would it be wise, from the point of your\nown well-being, to do so? Robert Nozick thinks it would be a big\nmistake to plug in: \u2018We want to do certain things \u2026 we\nwant to be a certain way \u2026 plugging into an experience machine\nlimits us to a man-made reality\u2019 (Nozick 1974, p. 43).\n\nOne can make the machine sound more palatable, by allowing that\ngenuine choices can be made on it, that those plugged in have access\nto a common \u2018virtual world\u2019 shared by other machine-users,\na world in which \u2018ordinary\u2019 communication is possible, and\nso on. But this will not be enough for many anti-hedonists. A further\nline of response begins from so-called \u2018externalism\u2019 in\nthe philosophy of mind, according to which the content of mental\nstates is determined by facts external to the experiencer of those\nstates. Thus, the experience of really writing a great novel\nis quite different from that of apparently writing a great\nnovel, even though \u2018from the inside\u2019 they may be\nindistinguishable. But this is once again sailing close to the wind.\nIf the world can affect the very content of my experience without my\nbeing in a position to be aware of it, why should it not directly\naffect the value of my experience?\n\nThe strongest tack for hedonists to take is to accept the apparent\nforce of the experience machine objection, but to insist that it rests\non \u2018common sense\u2019 intuitions, the place in our lives of\nwhich may itself be justified by hedonism. This is to adopt a strategy\nsimilar to that developed by \u2018two-level utilitarians\u2019 in\nresponse to alleged counter-examples based on common-sense morality.\nThe hedonist will point out the so-called \u2018paradox of\nhedonism\u2019, that pleasure is most effectively pursued indirectly.\nIf I consciously try to maximize my own pleasure, I will be unable to\nimmerse myself in those activities, such as reading or playing games,\nwhich do give pleasure. And if we believe that those activities are\nvaluable independently of the pleasure we gain from engaging in them,\nthen we shall probably gain more pleasure overall.\n\nThese kinds of stand-off in moral philosophy are unfortunate, but\nshould not be brushed aside (for a balanced discussion of the\nexperience machine, see Lin 2016). They raise questions concerning the\nepistemology of ethics, and the source and epistemic status of our\ndeepest ethical beliefs, which we are further from answering than many\nwould like to think. Certainly the current trend of quickly dismissing\nhedonism on the basis of a quick run-through of the experience machine\nobjection is not methodologically sound.\n",
