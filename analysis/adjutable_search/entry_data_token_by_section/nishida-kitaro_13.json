    "main_text": "The Unity and Development of Nishida\u2019s Philosophy || Stages in Nishida\u2019s Thought\n8.2 Stages in Nishida\u2019s Thought\n\n\nMany readers of Nishida have attempted to delineate stages in the\ndevelopment of his philosophy (Elberfeld 1999, 71ff.); others have\nrejected a division into discrete stages (Heisig 2001,\n104). As a heuristic approach to a summary of his thought, we may broadly\ndistinguish three stages. The first is defined by an overwhelming\nconviction that concrete reality is at base unitary and can be\narticulated from the standpoint of consciousness. We have seen that\nNishida successively names its most basic form  \u201cpure\nexperience,\u201d \u201cself-awareness,\u201d and \u201cabsolute\nfree will.\u201d Each of these exemplifies the fundamental reality\nfrom which all else becomes manifest through a process of\ndifferentiation. In An Inquiry Into the Good (1911), pure\nexperience describes the primal undifferentiated form that\nsubsequently dirempts into differentiated forms: experiencing subject\nand experienced objects, intellectual intuition and reflective\nthought, objectified nature and objectifying spirit\u2014all on their\nway to a higher unity.  Intuition and Reflection in\nSelf-Awareness (1917) shifts that idealistic description to\nepistemological questions. It explicates self-awareness as the form in\nwhich reflection and immediate experience or intuition are unified, that is,\nthe form that reflects itself within itself and gives rise not only to\ndifferentiating judgments but to differently experienced systems such\nas spirit and matter and to \u201cworlds\u201d such as art and\nreligion.  Eventually Nishida proposes that the most basic form of\nself-awareness is not a kind of knowing at all, but a willing or\n\u201cabsolute free will\u201d evident in valuing and creating. He\ndevelops this proposal in Problems of Consciousness (1920)\nand Art and Morality (1923).  Nishida later said his first attempts, formulated from the standpoint of consciousness,\ninvited the charges of psychologism (Nishida 1990, xxxi), and\nmysticism (Nishida 1987, xxiii), and so he abandoned the language of pure\nexperience and absolute will. It is clear, however, that his initial\nconvictions persisted a good deal longer: the most concrete form of\nreality is undifferentiated, and consciousness as the manifestation of\nreality is inseparable from it.\n\n\nThe second stage, broadly speaking, is defined by the standpoint of\nplace or topos (basho). This involves the attempts to\narticulate levels of differentiation and place them in more and more\ninclusive circles (to use one of Nishida\u2019s metaphors) until one\nreaches the most concrete and comprehensive circle, a circle without\ncircumference whose center is everywhere.  Nishida calls each such\ncircle a place or topos, each alloowing things to be and to be seen as\nwhat they are. The final topos places self-awareness in the world of\naction and expression which contextualizes it, and ultimately in\nabsolute nothingness. Nishida refers to the ultimate topos, alluding to\nBuddhist doctrine, as \u201cthe form of the formless,\u201d clearly\nreplacing earlier attempts to describe the basic form of concrete\nreality in positive and subjectivistic terms such as pure experience and absolute free will, This stage is evident in essays\nin From That Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and The\nSelf-aware System of Universals (1930), and extends to much of\nThe Self-aware Determination of Nothingness (1932). A\nHegelian language of dialectics gradually became more and more\nprominent in his formulations, as he turned his attention to the place\nof individuals interacting in the world. He wrote of individuals as\nthe \u201cself-determinations\u201d of the universal of\nself-awareness; and of absolute nothingness as a dialectical\nuniversal.\n\n\nThe third stage sharpens the focus on the dialectical world as a place\nof mediation between interacting individuals as historically embodied\nselves. Nishida now conceptualizes the world as the historical\nmanifestation of absolute nothingness. This stage represents what is\nfor Nishida the most comprehensive and concrete standpoint, that of\nthe historical world. The world unfolds \u201cfrom the created to the\ncreating,\u201d not in a straightforward linear progression but out\nof an \u201cabsolute present\u201d that in each moment holds\ntogether past determinations and decisions for the future. The\nhistorical world as such is a \u201cself-identity of\ncontradictories.\u201d The self realizes itself not in knowing itself\nas distinct from other selves or things but through forms of\nself-negation. One form calls for the self to recognize the absolute\nother in its own core to relate truly to the Thou or other relative\nselves. Another form calls for one to give oneself over to things or\n\u201cbecome one with\u201d the things it would know\u2014through\n\u201cenactive intuition,\u201d seeing them by interacting with them\nand interacting by allowing them to transform oneself. In this\nstage relations come to the fore: the relations between I and Thou,\nthe one and the many, the expressive self and its expressions, the\nJapanese nation and other nations. Each of these relations constitutes\na self-identity of contradictories and resists a monistic\ninterpretation. This stage, understood heuristically, stretches from\nthe final essays in The Self-aware Determination of\nNothingness through The World of Action and The\nDialectical World (collected as The Fundamental\nProblems of Philosophy, 1934), seven volumes of Philosophical\nEssays (1935\u201345) and several political writings, on to Nishida\u2019s last\nessay, \u201cThe Logic of Place and the Religious\nWorldview\u201d(1945). The final essay returns to the theme of\nreligious awareness and makes more explicit the Buddhist references,\nas well as the Christian influence, latent in much of Nishida\u2019s\nphilosophy. The focus on death and finitude, while consistent with the\nidea of self-negation, suggests a shift of standpoint, but Nishida\u2019s\nfinal reflections are too brief to be called a new stage in his\nphilosophy.\n",
