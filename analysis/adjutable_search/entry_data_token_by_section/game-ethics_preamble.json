    "main_text": "\n\nGame theory is the study of interdependent choice and action.\nIt includes the study of strategic decision making, the\nanalysis of how the choices and decisions of a rational agent depend\non (or should be influenced by) the choices of other agents, as well\nas the study of group dynamics, the analysis of how the\ndistribution of strategies in a population evolves in various contexts\nand how these distributions impact the outcomes of individual\ninteractions. It should be distinguished from\n decision theory,\n the study of individual choice in contexts where the agent is\nchoosing independently of other agents, and from\n social choice theory,\n the study of collective decision making. Our focus will be on the\nrelevance of game theory to ethics and political philosophy. For a\nthorough discussion of game theory and its relevance to other areas of\nphilosophy see the entry on\n game theory.\n\nWe can distinguish between two ways in which game theory is relevant\nto ethics. The first is explanatory. Game theoretic tools can\nbe used to explain things ranging from (i) the function of morality\nand (ii) general features of our moral practices, to (iii) the\ndynamics of morally or politically significant social issues and (iv)\nthe emergence, existence, and stability of particular moral norms. The\nsecond way in which game theory is relevant to ethics is\njustificatory. Here game theoretic tools are used to justify\nthings ranging from (i) particular norms or principles, to (ii) large\nscale social institutions, or (iii) general characteristics of our\nmoral practices. In what follows, we shall consider each of these\nuses, including the ways in which the former complement the\nlatter.\n",
