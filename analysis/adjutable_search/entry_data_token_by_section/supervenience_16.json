    "main_text": "Varieties of Supervenience || Multiple Domain Supervenience\n4.5 Multiple Domain Supervenience\n\nThus far this essay has focused primarily on single domain\nsupervenience (the exceptions are the discussions of weak and\nintermediate global supervenience). A form of supervenience\ncounts as single domain when and only when the A- and\nB-properties are possessed by the very same\nindividuals\u2014when the way something is in A-respects is\na function of the way it is in B-respects. Both weak\nand strong individual supervenience are clear cases of single domain\nsupervenience. But in some cases, what we want to say is that there\ncannot be an A-difference in certain things without a\nB-difference in certain other things\u2014distinct\nthings to which the former things are related in a certain way. When\nand if this is the case, there is multiple domain supervenience.\n\nOne place such a notion seems useful is in discussions of coincidence\nand material constitution. Those who think that a clay statue is\ndistinct from the lump of clay that make it up will claim that certain\nproperties of the statue must supervene on properties of the lump of\nclay that constitutes it. For example, there could not be two statues\nthat are discernible in shape without the statues being constituted by\nlumps of clay discernible in shape. For further discussion, see\n Section 5.5.\n\nKim (1988) has formulated a weak and strong version of multiple domain\nsupervenience. Let D1 and\nD2 be non-empty domains of\nindividuals, R be a relation between\nD1 and\nD2, and R|x be\nthe subset of D2 to which\nx is R-related. We can define the following\nnotions:\n\n(A, D1) weakly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to R just in\ncase necessarily for any x and y in\nD1, if R|x and\nR|y are B-indiscernible, then x\nand y are A-indiscernible.\n\n\n(A, D1) strongly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to relation R\njust in case for any x and y in\nD1 and any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if R|x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\nR|y in w2,\nx in w1 is\nA-indiscernible from y in\nw2. (Kim 1998)\n\n\nWhen R is identity, these are equivalent, respectively, to\nsingle domain weak and single domain strong individual supervenience.\nIt is because R might be a relation other than identity, for\nexample material constitution, that the definitions have the potential\nfor added utility. Here again, slight modification of Moyer\u2019s\nargument (Section 4.3.4) can be used to show that weak and strong\nmultiple domain supervenience are equivalent when the supervening set\nis intrinsic.\n\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience is another kind of multiple-domain\nsupervenience (proposed by Dean Zimmerman 1995, 88)). It can be\nformulated as follows (see Bennett 2004, 520):\n\nCoincidence-Friendly Supervenience : For all x and\ny, and all worlds w1 and\nw2, if x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\ny in w2, then for each\nthing x* in w1 to which\nx is R-related, there is something y* in\nw2 that is R-related to\ny and that is A-indiscernible from x*.\n\n\nThat is a strong version, but a weak version can be formulated as\nfollows:\n\nWeak Coincidence-Friendly Supervenience: For any world\nw and any x and y in w, if\nx in w is B-indiscernible from y\nin w, then for each thing x* to which x is\nR-related in w, there is something y* that\ny is R-related in w and x* is\nA-indiscernible from y*.\n\n\nHere again, when R is identity, these forms of supervenience\nare equivalent, respectively, to weak and strong individual\nsupervenience. And here again, the weak and strong versions are\nequivalent when A is a set of only intrinsic properties.\n\nWeak and strong coincident-friendly supervenience count as kinds of\nmultiple-domain supervenience, but they differ from Kim\u2019s weak\nand strong multiple domain supervenience in at least one important\nrespect. The final quantifier in the definitions of\ncoincident-friendly supervenience is existential, rather than\nuniversal as it is in Kim\u2019s weak and strong multiple domain\nsupervenience. As a result, Kim\u2019s multiple domain supervenience\nsays that if a and b are B-indiscernible,\neach thing R-related to a must be A-indiscernible\nfrom everything R-related to b.\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience says only that each thing\nR-related to a must be A-indiscernible from\nsomething R-related to b. This matters if\nR is B-indiscernibility, as it plausibly is in the\ncase of spatio-temporal coincidence\u2014the main philosophical\napplication of multiple-domain supervenience.\n\nFinally, Ralf Bader (2013) has developed versions of multiple-domain\nsupervenience to model relations between complex entities and their\nparts, including those permitted by non-classical metrologies.\n",
