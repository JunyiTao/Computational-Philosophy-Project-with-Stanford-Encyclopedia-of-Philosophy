    "main_text": "Holist Underdetermination and Challenges to Scientific Rationality || Holist Underdetermination: The Very Idea\n2.1 Holist Underdetermination: The Very Idea\n\nDuhem\u2019s original case for holist underdetermination is, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, intimately bound up with his arguments for\nconfirmational holism: the claim that theories or hypotheses can only\nbe subjected to empirical testing in groups or collections, never in\nisolation. The idea here is that a single scientific hypothesis does\nnot by itself carry any implications about what we should expect to\nobserve in nature; rather, we can derive empirical consequences from\nan hypothesis only when it is conjoined with many other beliefs and\nhypotheses, including background assumptions about the world, beliefs\nabout how measuring instruments operate, further hypotheses about the\ninteractions between objects in the original hypothesis\u2019 field\nof study and the surrounding environment, etc. For this reason, Duhem\nargues, when an empirical prediction is falsified, we do not know\nwhether the fault lies with the hypothesis we originally sought to\ntest or with one of the many other beliefs and hypotheses that were\nalso needed and used to generate the failed prediction:\n\nA physicist decides to demonstrate the inaccuracy of a proposition; in\norder to deduce from this proposition the prediction of a phenomenon\nand institute the experiment which is to show whether this phenomenon\nis or is not produced, in order to interpret the results of this\nexperiment and establish that the predicted phenomenon is not\nproduced, he does not confine himself to making use of the proposition\nin question; he makes use also of a whole group of theories accepted\nby him as beyond dispute. The prediction of the phenomenon, whose\nnonproduction is to cut off debate, does not derive from the\nproposition challenged if taken by itself, but from the proposition at\nissue joined to that whole group of theories; if the predicted\nphenomenon is not produced, the only thing the experiment teaches us\nis that among the propositions used to predict the phenomenon and to\nestablish whether it would be produced, there is at least one error;\nbut where this error lies is just what it does not tell us. ([1914]\n1954, 185)\n\n\nDuhem supports this claim with examples from physical theory,\nincluding one designed to illustrate a celebrated further consequence\nhe draws from it. Holist underdetermination ensures, Duhem argues,\nthat there cannot be any such thing as a \u201ccrucial\nexperiment\u201d (experimentum crucis): a single experiment whose\noutcome is predicted differently by two competing theories and which\ntherefore serves to definitively confirm one and refute the other. For\nexample, in a famous scientific episode intended to resolve the\nongoing heated battle between partisans of the theory that light\nconsists of a stream of particles moving at extremely high speed (the\nparticle or \u201cemission\u201d theory of light) and defenders of\nthe view that light consists instead of waves propagated through a\nmechanical medium (the wave theory), the physicist Foucault designed\nan apparatus to test the two theories\u2019 competing claims about\nthe speed of transmission of light in different media: the particle\ntheory implied that light would travel faster in water than in air,\nwhile the wave theory implied that the reverse was true. Although the\noutcome of the experiment was taken to show that light travels faster\nin air than in\n water,[3]\n Duhem argues that this is far from a refutation of the hypothesis of\nemission:\n\nin fact, what the experiment declares stained with error is the whole\ngroup of propositions accepted by Newton, and after him by Laplace and\nBiot, that is, the whole theory from which we deduce the relation\nbetween the index of refraction and the velocity of light in various\nmedia. But in condemning this system as a whole by declaring it\nstained with error, the experiment does not tell us where the error\nlies. Is it in the fundamental hypothesis that light consists in\nprojectiles thrown out with great speed by luminous bodies? Is it in\nsome other assumption concerning the actions experienced by light\ncorpuscles due to the media in which they move? We know nothing about\nthat. It would be rash to believe, as Arago seems to have thought,\nthat Foucault\u2019s experiment condemns once and for all the very\nhypothesis of emission, i.e., the assimilation of a ray of light to a\nswarm of projectiles. If physicists had attached some value to this\ntask, they would undoubtedly have succeeded in founding on this\nassumption a system of optics that would agree with Foucault\u2019s\nexperiment. ([1914] 1954, p. 187)\n\n\nFrom this and similar examples, Duhem drew the quite general\nconclusion that our response to the experimental or observational\nfalsification of a theory is always underdetermined in this way. When\nthe world does not live up to our theory-grounded expectations, we\nmust give up something, but because no hypothesis is ever\ntested in isolation, no experiment ever tells us precisely which\nbelief it is that we must revise or give up as mistaken:\n\nIn sum, the physicist can never subject an isolated hypothesis to\nexperimental test, but only a whole group of hypotheses; when the\nexperiment is in disagreement with his predictions, what he learns is\nthat at least one of the hypotheses constituting this group is\nunacceptable and ought to be modified; but the experiment does not\ndesignate which one should be changed. ([1914] 1954, 187)\n\n\nThe predicament Duhem here identifies is no mere rainy day puzzle for\nphilosophers of science, but a methodological challenge that\nconsistently arises in the course of scientific practice itself. It is\nsimply not true that for practical purposes and in concrete contexts\nthere is always just a single revision of our beliefs in response to\ndisconfirming evidence that is obviously correct, most promising, or\neven most sensible to pursue. To cite a classic example, when\nNewton\u2019s celestial mechanics failed to correctly predict the\norbit of Uranus, scientists at the time did not simply abandon the\ntheory but protected it from refutation by instead challenging the\nbackground assumption that the solar system contained only seven\nplanets. This strategy bore fruit, notwithstanding the falsity of\nNewton\u2019s theory: by calculating the location of a hypothetical\neighth planet influencing the orbit of Uranus, the astronomers Adams\nand Leverrier were eventually led to discover Neptune in 1846. But the\nvery same strategy failed when used to try to explain the advance of\nthe perihelion in Mercury\u2019s orbit by postulating the existence\nof \u201cVulcan\u201d, an additional planet located between Mercury\nand the sun, and this phenomenon would resist satisfactory explanation\nuntil the arrival of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. So\nit seems that Duhem was right to suggest not only that hypotheses must\nbe tested as a group or a collection, but also that it is by no means\na foregone conclusion which member of such a collection should be\nabandoned or revised in response to a failed empirical test or false\nimplication. Indeed, this very example illustrates why Duhem\u2019s\nown rather hopeful appeal to the \u2018good sense\u2019 of\nscientists themselves in deciding when a given hypothesis ought to be\nabandoned promises very little if any relief from the general\npredicament of holist underdetermination.\n\nAs noted above, Duhem thought that the sort of underdetermination he\nhad described presented a challenge only for theoretical physics, but\nsubsequent thinking in the philosophy of science has tended to the\nopinion that the predicament Duhem described applies to theoretical\ntesting in all fields of scientific inquiry. We cannot, for example,\ntest an hypothesis about the phenotypic effects of a particular gene\nwithout presupposing a host of further beliefs about what genes are,\nhow they work, how we can identify them, what other genes are doing,\nand so on. In the middle of the 20th Century, W. V. O.\nQuine would incorporate confirmational holism and its associated\nconcerns about underdetermination into an extraordinarily influential\naccount of knowledge in general. As part of his famous (1951) critique\nof the widely accepted distinction between truths that are analytic\n(true by definition, or as a matter of logic or language alone) and\nthose that are synthetic (true in virtue of some contingent fact about\nthe way the world is), Quine argued that all of the beliefs\nwe hold at any given time are linked in an interconnected web, which\nencounters our sensory experience only at its periphery:\n\nThe totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most\ncasual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of\natomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made\nfabric which impinges on experience only along the edges. Or, to\nchange the figure, total science is like a field of force whose\nboundary conditions are experience. A conflict with experience at the\nperiphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field. But\nthe total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions,\nexperience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what\nstatements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary\nexperience. No particular experiences are linked with any particular\nstatements in the interior of the field, except indirectly through\nconsiderations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole. (1951,\n42\u20133)\n\n\nOne consequence of this general picture of human knowledge is that all\nof our beliefs are tested against experience only as a corporate\nbody\u2014or as Quine sometimes puts it, \u201cThe unit of empirical\nsignificance is the whole of science\u201d (1951, p.\n 42).[4]\n A mismatch between what the web as a whole leads us to expect and the\nsensory experiences we actually receive will occasion some\nrevision in our beliefs, but which revision we should make to bring\nthe web as a whole back into conformity with our experiences is\nradically underdetermined by those experiences themselves. To use\nQuine\u2019s example, if we find our belief that there are brick\nhouses on Elm Street to be in conflict with our immediate sense\nexperience, we might revise our beliefs about the houses on Elm\nStreet, but we might equally well modify instead our beliefs about the\nappearance of brick, our present location, or innumerable other\nbeliefs constituting the interconnected web. In a pinch, we might even\ndecide that our present sensory experiences are simply hallucinations!\nQuine\u2019s point was not that any of these are particularly likely\nor reasonable responses to recalcitrant experiences (indeed, an\nimportant part of his account is the explanation of why they are not),\nbut instead that they would serve equally well to bring the web of\nbelief as a whole in line with our experience. And if the belief that\nthere are brick houses on Elm Street were sufficiently important to\nus, Quine insisted, it would be possible for us to preserve it\n\u201ccome what may\u201d (in the way of empirical evidence), by\nmaking sufficiently radical adjustments elsewhere in the web of\nbelief. It is in principle open to us, Quine argued, to revise even\nbeliefs about logic, mathematics, or the meanings of our terms in\nresponse to recalcitrant experience; it might seem a tempting solution\nto certain persistent difficulties in quantum mechanics, for example,\nto reject classical logic\u2019s law of the excluded middle (allowing\nphysical particles to both have and not have some determinate\nclassical physical property like position or momentum at a given\ntime). The only test of a belief, Quine argued, is whether it fits\ninto a web of connected beliefs that accords well with our experience\non the whole. And because this leaves any and all beliefs in\nthat web at least potentially subject to revision on the basis of our\nongoing sense experience or empirical evidence, he insisted, there\nsimply are no beliefs that are analytic in the originally supposed\nsense of immune to revision in light of experience, or true no matter\nwhat the world is like.\n\nQuine recognized, of course, that many of the logically possible ways\nof revising our beliefs in response to recalcitrant experiences that\nremain open to us nonetheless strike us as ad hoc, perfectly\nridiculous, or worse. He argues (1955) that our actual revisions of\nthe web of belief seek to maximize the theoretical\n\u201cvirtues\u201d of simplicity, familiarity, scope, and\nfecundity, along with conformity to experience, and elsewhere suggests\nthat we typically seek to resolve conflicts between the web of our\nbeliefs and our sensory experiences in accordance with a principle of\n\u201cconservatism\u201d, that is, by making the smallest possible\nnumber of changes to the least central beliefs we can that will\nsuffice to reconcile the web with experience. That is, Quine\nrecognized that when we encounter recalcitrant experience we are not\nusually at a loss to decide which of our beliefs to revise in response\nto it, but he claimed that this is simply because we are strongly\ndisposed as a matter of fundamental psychology to prefer whatever\nrevision requires the most minimal mutilation of the existing web of\nbeliefs and/or maximizes virtues that he explicitly recognizes as\npragmatic in character. Indeed, it would seem that on Quine\u2019s\nview the very notion of a belief being more central or peripheral or\nin lesser or greater \u201cproximity\u201d to sense experience\nshould be cashed out simply as a measure of our willingness to revise\nit in response to recalcitrant experience. That is, it would seem that\nwhat it means for one belief to be located\n\u201ccloser\u201d to the sensory periphery of the web than another\nis simply that we are more likely to revise the first than the second\nif doing so would enable us to bring the web as a whole into\nconformity with otherwise recalcitrant sense experience. Thus, Quine\nsaw the traditional distinction between analytic and synthetic beliefs\nas simply registering the endpoints of a psychological continuum\nordering our beliefs according to the ease and likelihood with which\nwe are prepared to revise them in order to reconcile the web as a\nwhole with our sense experience as a whole.\n",
