    "main_text": "The Conciliar Movement\n14. The Conciliar Movement\n\nIn 1378 some of the cardinals who had elected Pope Urban VI met again\nand elected another pope, claiming that their earlier choice had been\ncoerced. This was the beginning of the Great Western Schism. Various\npossible solutions were debated. One proposal was to call a General\nCouncil of the Church to end the schism. To this it was objected that\nonly a pope could call a council and that its decisions needed papal\nconfirmation. The prominent French churchman and academic, Jean Gerson\n(1363\u20131429), argued that such requirements were a matter of\nhuman ecclesiastical law, which should be set aside if it impedes the\nreformation of the Church. The arguments of Gerson and others\nprevailed, and the schism was in the end healed by a council. The\nCouncil of Constance, 1414\u20131418, deposed two rival popes (by\nthen there were three, one of whom resigned) and elected a new pope.\nThe Council also passed the decrees Sacrosancta (otherwise\ncalled Haec Sancta), which claimed that a council has power\nover a pope in all matters pertaining to faith and the reformation of\nthe Church and in particular the present\n schism,[74]\n and Frequens, which required the calling of a council every\nten years (both in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe conciliarists were those who argued that, at least in\nextraordinary circumstances, a council could be called, if necessary\nwithout papal permission, to deal with schism, with authority over\neven a true pope. They included Pierre d\u2019Ailly, Jean Gerson,\nHenry of Langenstein, John Maior, Jaques Almain, Nicholas of Cusa, and\nothers. They argued that every corporation has the power to take the\nmeasures that may be necessary if its survival is endangered by\nfailure in its head. The Church must be able to deal with situations\nin which the papacy is vacant or uncertain or corrupt; otherwise its\nexistence would be more precarious than the existence of a secular\nbody politic, which can replace its head if necessary. The analogy\nbetween the Church and a secular body politic ran through much\nconciliarist thinking.\n\nAs the conciliar movement developed, some argued, more radically, that\neven in ordinary circumstances the judgment of a council prevailed\nover that of a pope. Later popes (though they owed their position to\nConstance) opposed conciliarism, at least in its more radical form,\nand warned secular rulers that conciliarist ideas also threatened the\npower of kings\u2014they were aware of the analogy between\nconciliarist views of church government and anti-monarchical views of\nsecular government. The analogy was also noticed by some of those who\nwrote during the quarrel between Parliament and the King in\nseventeenth-century England (Oakley 1962: 3\u201311). Despite its\npossible anti-monarchical implications, the notion that the pope was\nsubordinate to a council remained attractive to the French monarchy,\nand in France conciliarism was one of the sources of Gallicanism.\n\nThere were a number of strands in conciliarist thought. One important\ninfluence was the tradition of canon law, in which it had been\nacknowledged that a pope could be judged and deposed if he became a\nheretic or notorious sinner (Tierney 1955). Ockham had likewise argued\nthat \u201con occasion\u201d anyone able to do so could rightly do\nwhatever was necessary to preserve the Church, for example by deposing\na pope who had become a heretic or notorious sinner. An unacknowledged\ninfluence was Marsilius, who had argued that the ultimate authority in\nthe Church was the Christian people, that councils should be convened\nby the secular ruler and that a council could not err in matters of\n faith.[75]\n Many conciliarists held that Christ\u2019s commission\n (Mark 16:15,\n \u201cGo ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every\ncreature\u201d) was primarily to the Church as a whole, and held\neither that the authority of the whole Church is vested in the pope,\nor in the council when papal power is obstructed or abused, or else\nthat the authority of the whole Church is normally vested in a council\n(while a council is in session). On either view, the council could\ndepose an unsatisfactory pope, but on the second view the council is\nthe chief organ of Church authority even in normal circumstances.\nOckham\u2019s view was that the normal constitution of the Church is\nmonarchical (according to Ockham, Christ had appointed Peter as sole\nhead of the Church), and a council or indeed someone else may acquire\npower over a pope, or in place of a pope, only in exceptional\n circumstances.[76]\n\n",
