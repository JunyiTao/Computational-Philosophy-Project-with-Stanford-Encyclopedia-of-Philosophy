There are many kinds of digital art, including digital\ncinema and video, digital photography and painting, electronic music,\nliterary works generated by so-called \u201cchatbots\u201d, NFT art,\nnet art, and video games. For the full range of digital art kinds, the\naim is to identify their essential features, ground their proper\nappreciation, and situate our understanding of them in relation to\npre-existing debates in aesthetics. This first-order inquiry cannot\nproceed without acknowledgment of the enormous interdisciplinary and\npopular interest in digital media. Claims are frequently made about\nfundamental shifts in the way we classify, evaluate, and engage with\nart now that computers seem to be involved in every kind of cultural\nproduction. The so-called \u201cdigital condition\u201d (Kittler\n1999) is characterized by a loss of trust in the image, a new way of\nexperiencing the world as indeterminate and fragmentary, and a\nbreakdown of traditional boundaries between artist and audience,\nartwork and artistic process. If we are looking for evidence of the\ndigital condition, we need to understand its conceptual structure.\nHere\u2019s where the philosopher comes in.\n\nAlthough technology-based art is viewed as the \u201cfinal\navant-garde of the twentieth-century\u201d (Rush 2005), and digital\nart has been part of the mainstream art world since the late 1990s\n(Paul 2008), the philosophy of digital art is still an emerging\nsubfield. Three seminal monographs, one on videogames (Tavinor 2009),\none on digital cinema (Gaut 2010), and one on computer art (Lopes\n2010), have been invaluable in laying the groundwork concerning\nphilosophical questions about art and computer technology. Since these\npublications, further philosophical attention has been given to the\ndigital arts, including the first published volume to focus on the\naesthetics of videogames (see Robson & Tavinor, eds., 2018). It\ncan be challenging for philosophers to keep up with the rapid rate at\nwhich digital technology develops. But a number of recent articles on\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in the arts show that philosophers are\nwell aware of and ready to meet this challenge (Atencia-Linares and\nArtiga 2022; Milli\u00e8re 2022; Moruzzi 2022; Roberts and Krueger\n2022). The body of philosophical work on AI art will no doubt continue\nto grow, as will bodies of work on virtual reality in art and Internet\nart. With this growth, we can expect to to learn a great deal more\nabout the extent and character of the digital cultural revolution.\n", "toc": [{"#WhatDigiArt": "1.

What is Digital Art?\n1.1 The Digital Art World\n\nIn its broadest extant sense, \u201cdigital art\u201d refers to art\nthat relies on computer-based digital encoding, or on the electronic\nstorage and processing of information in different formats\u2014text,\nnumbers, images, sounds\u2014in a common binary code. The ways in\nwhich art-making can incorporate computer-based digital encoding are\nextremely diverse. A digital photograph may be the product of a\nmanipulated sample of visual information captured with a digital\ncamera from a \u201clive\u201d scene or captured with a scanner from\na traditional celluloid photograph. Music can be recorded and then\nmanipulated digitally or created digitally with specialized computer\nsoftware. And a film is now the product of an extremely complex\nsequence of choices between analog and digital processes at the stages\nof image and sound capture or composition, image and sound editing,\ncolor correction or sound mastering, special effects production, and\ndisplay or projection.\n\nThe complexity of the digital cinema workflow draws attention to a\nfurther difference concerning whether reliance on the digital is\nrestricted to the way an artwork is made or extends to the display of\nthe work. A work may be made on a computer\u2014say, a musical work\ncomposed with Sibelius or a play written in Microsoft Word\u2014and\nyet meant for apprehension in a non-digital format\u2014say,\nperformance on traditional musical instruments or enactment on stage.\nSimilarly, a film could be captured and edited digitally before being\nprinted on traditional 35mm photochemical film for projection in\ntheaters. By contrast, works that are purely digital include a film\nmade and projected digitally\u2014for example, Dune (2021),\na piece of music composed and played back electronically\u2014for\nexample, the electroacoustic works of Gottfried Michael Koenig (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n and a work of ASCII art\u2014an image made up from the 95 printable\ncharacters defined by the ASCII standard of 1963 and displayed on a\ncomputer monitor.\n\nAn example of ASCII art:\n\n\n  (\\_/)\n (='.'=)\n (\u201c)^(\u201d) \n\n\n\nMore recent kinds of purely digital art include Instagram art and\nChatbot fiction. An example of the former is Land of Arca\n(2023), which is made up of narrative images created by AI and then\ncurated by the Instagram account\u2019s owner, IRK. An example of the\nlatter is any of the myriad science fiction short stories with which\nseveral literary magazines were recently deluged.\n\nEach of the examples above incorporates a computational process, to\nsome degree, in the presentation of the work. In many ways, works\nbelonging to digital media stand in stark contrast to those made by\ncompletely analog means.\n1.2 The Analog-Digital Distinction\n\nThe classical account of the analog-digital distinction is found in\nNelson Goodman\u2019s Languages of Art (1976). In fact\nGoodman\u2019s account remains practically the only general\naccount of the distinction. While David Lewis (1971) raises a series\nof objections to Goodman, Lewis\u2019 alternative account applies\nonly to the representation of numbers. And while John Haugeland (1981)\nreturns to the general distinction, he effectively qualifies and\nre-frames Goodman\u2019s account in order to overcome Lewis\u2019s\nand other potential objections. A few philosophers interested in\nclarifying the concepts employed by cognitive scientists have\nrecognized the need for a general account of the analog-digital\ndistinction (e.g., Dretske 1981; Blachowicz 1997; Katz 2008; Maley\n2011). But in this context, as well, Goodman\u2019s account is the\nessential point of reference. In some ways, this is surprising or at\nleast striking: As Haugeland points out, the digital is a\n\u201cmundane engineering notion\u201d (1981: 217). Yet the\nphilosophical context in which the notion receives its fullest\nanalysis is that of aesthetics. As is well-known, Goodman\u2019s\ninterests in this context center on the role of musical notation in\nfixing the identity of musical works. But a musical notation is also a\nstandard example of a digital system.\n\nOn Goodman\u2019s broad, structuralist way of thinking,\nrepresentational systems in general consist of sets of possible\nphysical objects that count as token representations. Objects are\ngrouped under syntactic and semantic types, and interesting\ndifferences between kinds of representational system track differences\nin the way syntactic and semantic types relate to one another. Digital\nsystems are distinguished by being differentiated as opposed\nto dense. The condition of syntactic differentiation\nis met when the differences between classes of token representations\nare limited such that it is possible for users of the system always to\ntell that a token belongs to at most one class. The condition of\nsemantic differentiation is met when the extension of each\ntype, or the class of referents corresponding to a class of token\nrepresentations, differs in limited ways from the extension of any\nother type; so that users of the system can always tell that a\nreferent belongs to at most one extension. Goodman provides the\nfollowing example of a simple digital computer, a system that meets\nthe conditions of both syntactic and semantic differentiation: Say we\nhave an instrument reporting on the number of dimes dropped into a toy\nbank with a capacity for holding 50 dimes, where the count is reported\nby an Arabic numeral on a small display (Goodman 1976: 159). In this\nsystem, the syntactic types are just the numbers 0\u201350, which\nhave as their instances the discrete displays, at different times, of\nthe corresponding Arabic numerals. Both the conditions of syntactic\nand semantic differentiation are met because the relevant differences\nbetween instances of different numbers are both highly circumscribed\nand conspicuous. This means that users of the system can be expected\nto be able to read the display, or determine which number is\ninstantiated on the display (syntactic differentiation) and which\nnumerical value, or how many coins, is thereby being indicated\n(semantic differentiation).\n\nAnalog representation fails to be differentiated because it is dense.\nWith an ordering of types such that between any two types, there is a\nthird, it is impossible to determine instantiation of at most one\ntype. Not every case involving a failure of finite differentiation is\na case of density but, in practice, most are. With a traditional\nthermometer, for example, heights of mercury that differ to any degree\ncount as distinct syntactic types and the kinds of things that can\ndiffer semantically. Similarly, for pictures distinguished according\nto regions of color, for any two pictures, no matter how closely\nsimilar, one can always find a third more similar to each of them than\nthey are to each other. Density is a feature of any system that\nmeasures continuously varying values. That is, as long as the system\nin question is designed so that any difference in magnitude indicates\na difference in type.\n\nReturning to the digital, some commentators have questioned whether\nGoodman\u2019s condition of (syntactic and semantic) finite\ndifferentiation is sufficient to distinguish the kind of\nrepresentation in question (Haugeland 1981; Lewis 1971). John\nHaugeland, for example, argues that there can be differentiated\nschemes without the \u201ccopyability\u201d feature that defines the\npractical significance of digital systems. Haugeland\u2019s solution\nis to require the practical and not just the theoretical possibility\nof a system\u2019s users determining type membership. In fact,\nhowever, Goodman himself would likely accept this modification. In a\nlater work, Goodman explicitly states that finite differentiation must\nmake it possible to determine type membership \u201cby means\navailable and appropriate to the given user of the given scheme\u201d\n(Goodman and Elgin 1988: 125).\n1.3 Digital Art: Production\n\nWhether or not a work of digital art is a work of representational\nart, and even with the most abstract works of digital art, there are\nlayers of representation involved in the complex processes of their\nproduction and presentation. Most of these layers, and arguably the\nmost important ones, are digital. Where there are analog systems\ninvolved, digital translation makes possible the realization of the\nvalues of the final work. This is perhaps best seen with paradigmatic\ncases of digital art. Consider the following two relatively early\nworks:\n\nCraig Kalpakjian, Corridor, 1995. Computer-generated\nanimation on laser video disc, in the collection of the San Francisco\nMuseum of Modern Art. The video leads us slowly down an empty office\nhallway that is slightly curved and evenly lit, with pale, blank walls\nand opaque glass windows.\nCory Arcangel and Paul B. Davis, Landscape Study #4,\n2002. Installation. A \u201creverse-engineered\u201d video game that\naims to transpose our everyday surroundings onto a video game\nplatform. The work \u201cplays\u201d on a Nintendo gaming system and\ndisplays a continuously scrolling landscape with the blocky,\nminimalist graphics of the Mario Bros. game.\n\n\nThe first of these works involves digital moving imagery that is\nentirely generated by a computer program. At the same time, the video\nlooks like it was or could have been recorded in an actual office\nsetting. The particular significance of the work depends on the viewer\nbeing aware of its digital composition while at the same time being\nstruck by its photorealistic familiarity. According to the San\nFrancisco Museum of Modern Art (SF MoMA),\n\n\nKalpakjian thus reveals the complete artificiality of the built\nenvironments we inhabit, and their aesthetic distance from more\nhumanistic forms. (SF MoMA n.d.)\n\n\nThe second work involves imagery that was initially captured\ndigitally. Arcangel & Davis began by taking 360-degree photographs\nof Buffalo, New York. They scanned and modified the photographs on\ntheir computer so that the images could be coded according to the\ngraphics capabilities of the Nintendo gaming system, and in order to\ngive the images the distinctive look and feel of the Mario\nBros. game. Arcangel & Davis then programmed the landscape\nimagery to scroll continuously across a TV screen, as in the Mario\nBros. game. Finally, Arcangel & Davis melted the chips in a\nSuper Mario cartridge, replacing them with their\nself-manufactured chips so that their landscape \u201cgame\u201d\ncould be run on any Nintendo system. As well as all the ways in which\nArcangel & Davis\u2019s work relies on both the technology and\naesthetics of videogames, there are clearly ways in which it\ndeliberately removes or blocks certain key features or capacities of\nvideogames, perhaps most notably their robust interactivity. Playing a\nvideogame essentially involves the prescribed creation of new display\ninstances of a work. But we do not \u201cplay\u201d Landscape\nStudy #4, and its imagery is fixed by the artist. The kind of\ninteractivity typical of videogames can also be found in artworks made\nwithout computers (see Lopes 2010: 49). But this type of interactivity\nis most closely associated with digital art because complex\ninteractivity is so much easier to achieve with the use of computers.\nThis suggests a high degree of self-consciousness in Arcangel &\nDavis\u2019s decision to block the interactivity of their\nreverse-engineered videogame. From the perspective of the philosophy\nof digital art, such a decision highlights the need for further\ndiscussion of the link between the nature of the digital and the\nnature of interactivity.\n\nWhat is it about the ways in which the works by Arcangel & Davis,\nand by Kalpakjian, are produced that makes them digital in an\nappreciatively relevant sense? Computer imaging depends on the\ninherent programmability and automation of digital computers. Digital\nimage capture depends on sampling and subsequently on the\nnear-instantaneous processes of discrete coding. None of this would be\npossible without a series of linked systems each with finitely\ndifferentiated settings.\n\nAt the most basic level, the myriad transistors in a computer are\nessentially tiny digital schemes, each with two types: the\n\u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d settings of the\ntransistor-capacitor switch. The settings are discrete and\ndistinguishable, as are their compliance classes, of 1s and 0s. The\nubiquity of binary code in computer processing is a consequence of the\nfact that a digital computer is essentially a vast collection of\non-off switches. A particular sequence of 1s and 0s realized at a\nparticular time in virtue of the requisite arrangement of transistors\nis a binary instance of a particular number, interchangeable with all\nother instances of the same number and not interchangeable with any\ninstances of different numbers. The difference between instances of\none number and instances of other numbers is strictly limited to the\ndifference in the ordering of 1s and 0s. In other words,\nGoodman\u2019s condition of finite differentiation is clearly met. In\nturn, the numbers can refer to other values, including the\nlight-intensity values of an image. A computation simply involves the\ngeneration of output strings of binary digits from input strings, in\naccordance with a general rule that depends on the properties of the\nstrings (Piccinini 2008). The modern (digital) computer encodes both\ninput data and assembly languages as sequences of binary digits, or\nbits, and allows for the internal storage of instructions. This makes\nthe computer essentially programmable in the sense that it can be\nmodified to compute new functions simply by being fed an appropriate\narrangement of bits.\n\nA program is a list of instructions, and instructions are strings of\ndigits. The modern digital computer has components that serve to copy\nand store programs inside the machine, and to supply instructions to\nthe computer\u2019s processing units for implementation in the\nappropriate order. The outputs of a system can be dependent on\nspecific inputs often in tandem with the conditional if-then\nstatements. This is what is involved in a\ncomputer executing conditional branching instructions such that it can\nmonitor and respond to its own intermediate computational states and\neven modify instructions based on its own processes. Such\nmodifications are dictated by an algorithm\u2014the program\u2019s\nset of rules and operations. It is the digital computer\u2019s\ncapacity for branching, due to its digital programmability, that\nallows for the kinds of higher-level automation involved in the use of\nimaging applications and sequential image-generation. Our artists,\nKalpakjian, and Arcangel & Davis, do not have to enter the strings\nof digits for every basic operation of the computer that underlies the\ncomplex operations involved in describing and manipulating images. If\nthey did have to do this, they would never finish making their\nartworks. Rather, artists can rely on open-source code, libraries, or\ncommercial software that automatically and instantaneously supplies\nthe lines of code required for the execution of their artistic\ndecisions.\n\nThe imaging software with which Kalpakjian works allows him to\ngenerate architectural interiors in rich detail. Arcangel & Davis\ndo not require as much from their imaging software given that they are\nmanipulating previously captured and scanned images. The process of\nscanning the photographs, just like the process involved in digital\nphotography, involves sampling and quantization of a visual source;\nassigning an integer, from a finite range, to the average\nlight-intensity measured across each small area of source-space\ncorresponding to a cell in a grid. This process involves averaging and\nrounding up values, and it involves measurement, or sampling, of light\nintensities at (spatially and temporally) discrete intervals. Some,\nindeed many, of the differences in light intensity across the source\nimage or scene (and at different times, in the case of moving imagery)\nare thereby dropped by the process of digital image-capture. Among\nsome media theorists, this fact has led to deep suspicion of the\ndigitally recorded image, prompting the feeling that the digital image\nis always a poor substitute for the analog. Current digital\ntechnologies for image-capture and display have such high rates of\nsampling frequency and resolution that the values dropped in\nquantization are well below the threshold of human perception. At the\nsame time, Arcangel & Davis\u2019s Landscape Study #4\nreminds us that digital artists may choose to exploit visible\npixellation for particular artistic ends.\n\nA digitally recorded image need not appear any less richly detailed or\nvaried in color than an analog image. All the same, in the terms of D.\nN. Rodowick, whereas the analog photograph is an \u201cisomorphic\ntranscription\u201d of its subject, a digital photograph is a\n\u201cdata-output\u201d, with a symbolically-mediated link to its\nsubject (Rodowick 2007: 117\u20138). This ontological\ndivide\u2014described by William J. Mitchell as a \u201csudden and\ndecisive rupture\u201d in the history of photography (1994: 59), is\nthen assumed to have aesthetic implications: Rodowick insists that the\n\u201cdiscontinuities\u201d in digital information \u201cproduce\nperceptual or aesthetic effects\u201d. Despite this insistence,\nhowever, Rodowick goes on to acknowledge that, with enough resolution,\n\u201ca digital photograph can simulate the look of a continuously\nproduced analogical image\u201d. This concession would seem to work\nagainst any attempt to identify the aesthetic effects of pixellation,\neven if \u201cthe pixel grid remains in the logical structure of the\nimage\u201d (Rodowick 2007: 119). But if we are to interpret Rodowick\ncharitably, he could be implying that ontology at least partly\ndetermines appropriate appreciation; even if a digital photograph can\nlook just like an analog photograph, its (known) digital status\naffects which of its perceptible features are aesthetically relevant\nand how we appropriately engage with them.\n1.4 Digital Art: Presentation\n\nThe media theorists\u2019 worry about the impoverished digital image\nprimarily refers to the production of digital images with its\nreliance on sampling and quantization. But there are also analogous\nworries about the digital presentation of images, worries\nabout deep structural changes to analog images once they are displayed\ndigitally\u2014for example, on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen\nor when projected digitally on a flat surface. Of course one could\nsimply be interested in investigating these structural changes without\nbeing particularly worried about them. This shall be our approach.\n\nThe traditional method of film reel projection has been a remarkably\nstable and entrenched technology, remaining largely unchanged for over\na century. But digital projection has almost taken over, particularly\nin conjunction with the networked distribution of films. Although\nfilms\u2019 audiences may not be able to see the difference on screen\nbetween analog and digital projection, their expectations are\nchanging\u2014for example, about what can go wrong in the\npresentation of a film. A deeper assumption that has not changed, one\nthat is almost universal among film scholars, is that films\nfundamentally depend on an illusion. Cinema is the art of moving\nimages and thus its very existence depends on our being tricked into\nseeing a rapid succession of static images as a persistent moving\nimage. In the philosophy of film, there is a small debate about the\nstatus of cinematic motion\u2014whether it really is an illusion as\ncommonly assumed. An analysis of digital projection technology reveals\nnew complexities in this debate but ultimately provides additional\nreasons to stick with the popular illusionist view.\n\nTraditional and digital projection methods could not seem more\ndifferent: the former involves running a flexible film strip through a\nmechanical projector; the latter involves a complex array of\nmicromirrors on semiconductor chips, which, in combination with a\nprism and a lamp, generate projectable images from binary code.\nNevertheless, both are methods for generating the impression of a\ncontinuously illuminated, persistent moving image from a sequence of\nstatic images. Compared with traditional projection, however, digital\nprojection includes an extra step, whereby the images in the static\nsequence are generated from flashes of light. In order to generate\neach image in the digital projector, a light beam from a high-powered\nlamp is separated by a prism into its color components of red, blue,\nand green. Each color beam then hits a different Digital Micromirror\nDevice (DMD), which is a semiconductor chip covered with more than a\nmillion tiny, hinged mirrors. Based on the information encoded in the\nvideo signal, the DMDs selectively turn over some of the tiny mirrors\nto reflect the colored lights. Most of the tiny mirrors are flipped\nthousands of times a second in order to create the gradations of light\nand dark making up a monochromatic, pixellated image\u2014a mirror\nthat is flipped on a greater proportion of the time will reflect more\nlight and so will form a brighter pixel than a mirror that is not\nflipped on for so long. Each DMD reflects a monochromatic image back\nto the prism, which then recombines the colors to form the projected,\nfull-color image. This image\u2014if it were held for long enough on\nthe screen\u2014would be perceived as static. In order then to\nproduce the impression of motion in the projected, full-color image,\nthe underlying memory array of the DMDs has to update rapidly so that\nall the micromirrors are released simultaneously and allowed to move\ninto a new \u201caddress state\u201d, providing new patterns of\nlight modulation for successive images.\n\nThe two-stage process of digital projection, by which the moving image\nis created from a succession of static images that are themselves\ncreated by motion, draws attention to the metaphysical complexity of\nthe question of how movies move. In particular, one is unlikely to\ndetermine the status of the impression of motion that makes possible\nthe art of cinema unless one can determine the status of the imagery\nthat is seen to move. Given that motion involves an object occupying\ncontiguous spatial locations in successive moments of time, a moving\nobject must be re-identifiable over time. A moving image in a film,\narising as it does out of the rapid display of a succession of still\nimages, is not obviously a persistent object that can be seen to move.\nThen again, perhaps it is enough that ordinary viewers identify an\nimage\u2014say of a moving train\u2014 as the same image, for the\nmoving image to persist (Currie 1996). Alternatively, the moving image\ncould be thought to persist as a second-order physical entity\nconstituted by a sequence of flashing lights (Ponech 2006).\n\nThe second proposal immediately runs into trouble with digital\nprojection. If the traditionally projected moving image exists as a\nseries of flashes of light, in digital projection, other\n\u201cintermediate\u201d objects must be granted existence\u2014for\nexample, the stable point of light consisting of the rate of flashes,\nand gaps between them, of a single micromirror on the DMD. At the same\ntime, the moving image itself must be stripped of its existence since\nit does not consist of flashes of light. This is due to the fact that,\nin digital projection, there are no gaps between frames and so no\nunderlying, imperceptible alternation of light and dark. This leaves\nthe realist in the awkward position of claiming that the moving image\ngoes in and out of existence with the switch between analog and\ndigital projection technologies.\n\nThe first proposal, on which cinematic motion is a secondary quality,\nthreatens to destroy the distinction between the apparent and the\nillusory. It suggests a way of reinterpreting any case of perceptual\nillusion as a case involving the ascription of secondary qualities.\nThat is, unless it can be shown that there are independent means of\nchecking that we are mistaken about genuine illusions. But even if\nthis can be shown, a problem remains: While there may not be an\nindependent check for the motion of an image, there is likewise no\nindependent check for a genuine illusion of color. Given the contrived\nconditions of film viewing, there is more reason to think of cinematic\nmotion as akin to an illusory, than to a genuine, experience of color.\nWith the introduction of digital projection, the conditions are\narguably even more contrived. For it is not just movement in the image\nbut the image itself that is constituted by rapid flashes of light.\nAnd the technology involved is far less accessible than that of a\ntraditional mechanical projector in the sense that one cannot, just by\nlooking at the projection device, see (roughly) how it works. In this\nway, an analysis of digital movie projection serves to reinforce the\ntraditional assumption that cinema is an art of illusion. In addition,\nhowever, the analysis suggests that the illusion at the heart of\ncinema is particularly impenetrable\u2014akin to an illusion of\ncolor, and thus an illusion of a mere appearance that cannot be\nchecked (Thomson-Jones 2013).\n2. Digital Images\n\nWith digital movie projection, we begin to see the importance of\nunderstanding the technology of display for understanding the nature\nof digital art. Another way we see its importance is in relation to\nimages displayed on LCD screens. According to Goodman, images are\nessentially analog. Nevertheless, there seems to be a way for\nengineers to circumvent the essential analogicity of pictorial schemes\nby using digital technologies for encoded subphenomenal\ndiscrimination. Arguably, finite differentiation can be imposed on the\nscheme of all possible images displayed on high-resolution LCD\nscreens. As we shall see, this has far-reaching implications for the\nways in which we think about and properly appreciate image-based\nart.\n\nBoth in his earlier and in his later work in aesthetics, Goodman\ncommits to \u201ca special relation\u201d between the analog and the\npictorial, one that is seen when we compare \u201cthe presystematic\nnotions of description and picture in a given culture\u201d. Given\ntwo schemes, S and S\u2032, where S\nconsists of all descriptions or predicates in a language such as\nEnglish, and S\u2032 consists of all pictures, if we were\ntold only of the structures of S and S\u2032, we\ncould distinguish the pictorial scheme by its being analog (Goodman\nand Elgin 1988: 130). The special relation remains, Goodman claims,\ndespite the possibility of a digital sub-scheme made up of black and\nwhite grid patterns all of which happen to be pictures. In such a\nscheme, the differences between patterned types that matter for the\nscheme\u2019s being digital do not include all of the differences\nthat matter for distinguishing pictorial types. Pictures are\ndistinguished by color, shape, and size, which vary continuously; any\nvariation in color, shape, or size potentially results in a different\npicture. When we impose limits on the differences that matter for\ndistinguishing one grid pattern in the scheme from another, we are not\ninterpreting the grid patterns as pictures; if we were to do so, we\nwould have to treat them as members of a syntactically dense, or\nanalog, scheme.\n\nGoodman\u2019s insight about grid patterns and pictures suggests an\nimmediate difficulty for explaining the digital status of images\ndisplayed on LCD screens: Clearly it will not be sufficient to point\nout that such images are pixellated, and therefore made up of small\nidentical building blocks that impose a lower limit on the differences\nbetween display-instances. Remember that pictures are defined by\ncolor, shape, and size, which vary continuously. This means there is\ngoing to be vagueness at the limits of types \u2013 even though the\nphysical pixels of an LCD screen are such that there are gaps between\nthe possible shapes, sizes, and colors that the screen can\ninstantiate; and, there are a finite number of shapes, sizes, and\ncolors that the screen can instantiate. Any means of discretely\ncarving up the property spaces of color, shape, and size has to\ninvolve grouping into types what are in fact (subphenomenally)\ndistinct shapes, sizes, and colors, some of which may differ less from\nadjacent properties grouped into other types. This makes it impossible\nalways to determine unique class membership; hence, finite\ndifferentiation fails.\n\nPixellation alone, no matter the resolution, cannot account for images\ndisplayed on LCD screens belonging to a digital scheme; digital images\nqua images thus remain stubbornly analog. But perhaps a\ncloser analysis of digital imaging technology can show that finite\ndifferentiation is met after all. Current technologies for sampling\nand instantiating light intensities group objective colors well below\nthe level of phenomenal discrimination. For example, in the standard\n\u201cTruecolor\u201d system, a display pixel has three 8-bit\nsubpixels, each of which emits a different visible wavelength with an\nintensity from a range of 256 values, yielding over 16 million\nobjective colors. Such a large number of available colors gives the\nimpression of a color continuum when, in fact, digital sampling\ntechnology has been used to carve up the objective color space into a\ndisjoint series of wavelength intensities. On the one hand, from the\nfact that display pixels can be lit at intensities between and\nindiscriminable from adjacent discriminable intensities, it seems to\nfollow that finite differentiation fails. On the other hand, precisely\nbecause digital technology involves microtechnology and metrology for\nsubphenomenal discrimination between colors, the light intensity\ngroupings that are expressed numerically as red-blue-green triplets\n(in, say, the Truecolor system) can be narrower than the\nobjective color types that contribute to the resultant image scheme.\nThe key is keeping the variations in the essentially analog properties\nof color, shape, and size small enough so that they cannot accumulate\nto the point of making a difference to image perception (Zeimbekis\n2012). The types in the scheme of digital images are technologically\nsegmented, transitive groupings of the same color-, shape-, and\nsize-experiences. The carving out of a transitive sub-set of\nmagnitudes has to occur relative to the needs of the users of the\nsystem. In the case of digital color, the types are classes of light\nintensities sufficient to cause the same color experience for\nnormal human perceivers. The replicability of digital images is made\npossible by the gap between the discriminatory limits of the human\nvisual system and the discriminatory limits of digital sampling\ntechnology.\n\nDigital images can be replicated insofar as they are digital and thus\nfinitely differentiated. They are finitely differentiated because they\nrely on subphenomenal sampling and display technology. In practical\nterms, replication depends on the use of binary code, even though this\nis not in fact what makes images qua images digital. Of\ncourse binary code representations are themselves part of a digital\nscheme. But the role of binary code in image-instantiation is just one\nof consistent preservation; preservation for long enough to permit\nreproduction. Despite the inherent replicability of digital images, it\ndoes not appear to follow automatically that artworks involving these\nimages are multiples.\n\nThe SF MoMA is in possession of the original of Kalpakjian\u2019s\nwork, Corridor; they control access to the video imagery. At\npresent, the work is not available to be viewed: it cannot be viewed\non-line as part of a digital archive or collection, nor is it\ncurrently on view in the physical space of the museum. The image\nsequence comprising the work could be multiply instantiated and widely\ndistributed, but in fact it is not, nor is it meant to be. Similarly\nwith Arcangel & Davis\u2019s work, Landscape Study #4:\nThis work is described as an installation, meant to be exhibited in a\nphysical gallery alongside an arrangement of printed stills, with a\ntelevision connected to a Nintendo Entertainment System. Again, the\nimage sequence displayed on the television could be multiply\ninstantiated and widely distributed, but it is not, nor is it meant to\nbe. Clips and copies of the landscape imagery are available on-line,\nbut these do not instantiate parts of the work itself. By contrast,\nworks of net art are instantiated whenever they are accessed by\nsomeone on-line.\n\nThere are many kinds of net art, including various forms of\nexperimental on-line literature, conceptual browser art, and works\ndrawing on software and computer gaming conventions. Extensive on-line\ncollections of visual and audiovisual net art are rigorously curated\nand at the same time immediately accessible to ordinary Internet\nusers. When it comes to the conventions of access and presentation,\nthe contrast is striking between works of net art and works like those\nby Kalpakjian, and Arcangel & Davis. Perhaps a digital artwork\ncomprising multiply instantiable images need not itself be multiply\ninstantiable. At this point, the philosophy of digital art joins an\nongoing debate about the ontology of art.\n\nOn the question of whether artworks are all the same kind of thing or\nmany different kinds of things, ontological pluralism is often taken\nto be implied by the primary role of the artist in\n\u201csanctioning\u201d features of their work (Irvin 2005, 2008;\nThomasson 2010). A sanction can consist simply in, say, the painting\nof a canvas by a self-professed artist and the subsequent display of\nthe work in a gallery. The artist has sanctioned those features of the\nwork that make it a traditional painting. But what was once largely\nimplicit is now often explicit: many contemporary works of art are\ndefined by a set of instructions for their presentation (e.g., aspect\nratio, resolution). We can find plenty of examples of non-digital\nworks that are defined by a set of instructions, such as Felix\nGonzalez-Torres\u2019 Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)\n(1991). This work is given to a gallery to display by way of nothing\nmore than a set of instructions for constructing and maintaining a\npile of candies. Whether non-digital or digital, the instructions\ndetermine what is part of the work and what is not, and whether the\nwork is singular or multiply instantiable. As a result, the\ninstructions guide appropriate interpretation of the work. On this\nview, ontology precedes interpretation: we cannot properly and fully\nappreciate a work, for the work that it is, without a prior\ndetermination of what it comprises. This is a matter of contention,\nhowever. On another way of thinking, artworks just are objects of\ninterpretation, and there is no artwork whose boundaries can be\nidentified before we begin interpretation (Davies 2004).\n\nThe issue of the relation between ontology and interpretation is a\ncomplex and difficult one, but progress can be made on the issue\nthrough an examination of digital art practices. This is particularly\nin light of the high degree of self-consciousness with which many\ndigital artists and digital art curators specify the features of\ndigital art works. It is a common practice, for example, when\narchiving net art, to have artists fill out a questionnaire in order\nto specify which features of a work are crucial for its\npreservation\u2014whether features of appearance, timing and motion,\ninteractivity potentials and methods, linking to other sites, or\nhardware and software. When a work of net art is individuated by its\nimagery, say, the artist has chosen to make the inherent replicability\nof digital imagery part of the work. That this is a choice is\nsuggested by the existence of singular works of digital visual art,\nlike the examples discussed above. The question of whether the works\nby Kalpakjian, and Arcangel & Davis can function allographically\nrequires further investigation (see D\u2019Cruz and Magnus 2014). But\nif they can so function, the artist\u2019s presentation instructions\nhave a primary role to play in fixing, not just the art form\n(installation, movie, conceptual work, etc.) but the basic structure\nof the work \u2013 for example, in determining whether the work is\nsingular and thus identical with a certain kind of physical display or\nmultiple with no original display. Where interactive digital works are\nconcerned, individuation is determined by a set of algorithms. An\nalgorithmic account of interactive digital art suggests that, although\nthe code is important for adequate instantiation of the work, it is\nthe algorithm that specifies the crucial features of the work (Lopes\n2010; Tavinor 2011; Moser 2018). Since the code is, ontologically\nspeaking, less relevant than the algorithm, this account makes\nallowances for the variability that may be found in the code when an\ninstance of a program is run on different kinds of devices.\n3. Appreciating Artworks in Digital Media\n\nReflection on the kinds and significance of choices available to an\nartist contributes to a full appreciation of the artist\u2019s work.\nFor any artwork, appreciation begins with recognition of its status as\na work, the product of artistic activity of some kind, and\nthus something to be appreciated as the achievement of an artist or\ngroup of artists. Most commonly, this achievement is understood in\nterms of the aesthetically significant effects achieved by an artist\nwith certain kinds of tools and materials and in light of certain\nappreciative conventions. In other words, the achievement is always\nrelative to an artistic medium. Returning to the case of an artist\nchoosing what to do about the inherent replicability of digital\nimagery, another way of thinking about this choice is in terms of the\nartist recognizing the limits and capacities of their chosen medium.\nImages conveyed digitally are always replicable and so when an artist\naims to convey artistic content through digital imagery, they either\nhave to accept the inevitable multiplicity of their works or resist\nthe tendency of the medium and somehow specify the work\u2019s\nsingularity in presentation. At a more fine-grained level, our\nappreciation of particular effects\u2014of color and composition,\nexpression, narrative structure, and so on\u2014depends on the\neffects themselves but also on background acknowledgment of their\ndegree of difficulty or innovation in the relevant medium. The\nproduction of digital art relies on the computer automation of many of\nthe tasks, both manual and cognitive, traditionally involved in making\nart. The effects achieved by computer automation cannot be assessed in\nthe same way as those achieved by traditional \u201chands-on\u201d\nartistic methods. The terms of our appreciation, therefore, need to be\nadjusted in the digital age. This is certainly compatible with the\ncontinued relevance of medium-based appreciation, as long as we can\nmake sense of digital media as artistic media (Binkley 1998). But\nthere is a strong tendency in film and media studies to assume that\nthe medium has absolutely no role to play in the appreciation of\ndigital art.\n\nSumming up this view, it supposedly follows from the fact that modern\n(digital) computers encode every kind of information in the same\nway\u2014i.e., as a sequence of binary digits\u2014that a digital\nartwork is no longer defined by its mode of presentation, whether in\nimages, moving images, sound patterns, or text. A work\u2019s display\nis rendered merely contingent by the fact that it is generated from a\ncommon code. By adding a particular instruction to the code sequence\nspecifying a work, imagery associated with that work could be\ninstantaneously converted into sounds or text, or just into different\nimagery. This possibility alone supposedly renders meaningless all\ntalk of an artwork being in a particular medium and being properly\nappreciated in terms of that medium (Kittler 1999; Doane 2007).\n\nGiven the considerable effects of digital technology on artistic\nproduction, it is perhaps understandable that some commentators are\ninclined toward a radical overhauling of art theoretical concepts. But\ntheir arguments in support of such an overhaul are, at best,\nincomplete. We see this once we cite some important continuities\nbetween ways of making and thinking about art in the analog age and in\nthe digital age. It has always been the case, for example, that\n\u201cany medium can be translated into any other\u201d (Kittler\n1999: 1): Without using a computer, someone could manually devise a\nset of rules (an algorithm) for the translation of image values, say,\ninto sounds or text. Moreover, a common storage and transmission means\nfor (moving) imagery and sound is not unique to digital technology: As\nDoron Galili points out (2011), electronic image transmission going\nback to the late nineteenth century\u2014in other words, precursors\nof the TV\u2014relies on the conversion of both images and sound into\nelectronic pulses.\n\nApart from these important continuities, the media theorist\u2019s\ninference from translatability to medium-free art simply does not\nhold. That we could set about \u201ctranslating\u201d the imagery of\nSeven Samurai into a symphony does not mean that the original\nartwork lacks a medium; it is a film, after all, and as such, it has\nto be in the medium of moving images. The symphonic translation of\nSeven Samurai is not the same work as the 1954 film by Akira\nKurosawa. This reminds us that, in deciding whether there is a digital\nmedium, we must not reduce the medium to the artist\u2019s materials,\nfor it also matters how the artist uses those materials. Nor must we\nlimit the constitutive materials of a medium to physical materials.\nThe case of literature shows that neither the materials of an art\nform, nor their modes of manipulation, need be physical. The medium of\nliterature is neither paper and ink nor abstract lexical symbols, but\nletters and words used in certain ways. There are, of course, many\ndifferent ways of physically storing and transmitting literary works,\nincluding by the printed page, in audio recordings, and by memory\n(human or computer). But from the fact that David Copperfield\ncan be preserved in many different formats, it does not follow that\nthis novel is any less decisively a novel and, as such, in the medium\nof literature.\n\nJust as with a literary work, the preservation and transmission of\ndigital works in different formats depends on the use of a common\ncode, but a binary numeric code rather than a lexical one. As we have\nseen, words and their literary uses constitute the medium of\nliterature. In the same way, binary code, along with the information\nit implements, and its artistic uses constitute the medium of digital\nart. This allows for the possibility that the digital medium contains\nvarious sub-media, or \u201cnested\u201d media (Gaut 2010). For\ninstance, within the medium of digital art, the medium of digital\nvisual art comprises artistic uses of computer code specifically to\ncreate images. In technical terms, such uses can be referred to as\n(artistic) \u201cbitmapping\u201d, given that a computer ultimately\nstores all images (2D and 3D vector) as bitmaps, which are code\nsequences specifying the integers assigned to light intensity\nmeasurements in a pixel grid. The medium of bitmapping is thus\ndistinguished by a kind of digital technology, but the kind used to\nproduce just those items belonging to the traditional medium of\nimages.\n\nOnce the notion of digital media is revealed to be no more confused or\nmysterious than the familiar notion of literary media, its irreducible\nrole in appreciation becomes apparent. To take just one example,\nproper appreciation of films in the digital age depends on recognizing\nthat digital filmmaking tools do not just make traditional filmmaking\neasier; they also present new creative possibilities and challenges.\nGiven the maturity and mass-art status of the cinematic art form, it\nis easy to take for granted the medium of moving imagery; we may think\nwe know exactly what its limits are, and we may even think we have\nseen everything that can be done with it. The digital medium is\ndifferent, however, and digital cinema is in both the medium of moving\nimagery and the digital medium.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to speak of\n\u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201climits\u201d in relation to\ndigital processes, which allow for instantaneous and endless\nmodification with increasingly user-friendly applications and devices.\nThe high degree of automation in the process of capturing an image\nwith a digital video camera, along with increasingly high image\nresolution and memory capacity, could make it seem as though digital\nimages are too easily achieved to be interesting. Then there are the\npractically endless possibilities for \u201ccorrecting\u201d the\ncaptured image with applications like Photoshop. When we take a photo\nor video on our smartphones, an AI program automatically optimizes\nfocus, contrast, and detail. Digital sound recording is likewise\nincreasingly automated, increasingly fine-grained, and reliant on\never-larger computer memory capacities. Modifying and mastering\nrecorded sound with digital editing software allows for an unlimited\ntesting of options. In digital film editing, sequence changes are\ninstantaneous and entirely reversible\u2014quite unlike when the\nediting process involved the physical cutting and splicing of a film\n(image or sound) strip. Digital tools thus allow filmmakers to focus\n(almost) purely on the the look and sound of the movie without having\nto worry about the technical difficulty or finality of\nimplementation.\n\nRather than dismissing all digital works as too easily achieved to be\ninteresting, medium-based appreciation requires that we consider the\ndigital on its own terms. This means we must allow for the possibility\nthat certain kinds of increased technical efficiency can bring new\ncreative risks. For example, even though committing to certain\neditorial decisions does not entail irreversible alterations to a\nfilmstrip, arriving at those decisions involves sifting through and\neliminating far more options, a process which can easily become\noverwhelming and therefore more error-ridden. When we properly\nappreciate a digital film, part of what we need to appreciate is the\nsignificance of any scene or sequence looking just the way it does\nwhen it could have, so easily, looked many other ways. Similarly, when\nwe properly appreciate an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame, we are, in part, appreciating certain representations,\nfunctions, and capabilities of the input-output system, made possible\nby digital media. This is undeniably a form of medium-based\nappreciation and the medium to which we appeal is digital. It is only\nwhen we think of a digital film as in a digital medium that we can\nappreciate it as a particular response to the creative problem,\nintroduced by coding, of finalizing selections from a vast array of\nequally and instantly available options.\n\nThe case of digital cinema is perhaps a useful starting point for work\nin the philosophy of digital art. Digital cinema is a multi-media art\nform, after all, involving 2D and 3D moving images as well as sound.\nIt also has the potential for robust interactivity, whereby audiences\nselect story events or otherwise modify a film screening in prescribed\nways (Gaut 2010: 224\u201343). Many of the digital tools developed by\nthe film and video game industries are now available more widely to\nartists interested in making other forms of digital art, including net\nart, digital sound installations, and virtual reality art (Grau 2003;\nChalmers 2017; Tavinor 2019). In terms of how the use of these tools\naffects proper appreciation, there are important continuities between\nthe filmmaking context and the wider digital art world. In addition,\nthe philosophy of film is a well-established subfield in aesthetics,\none that engages with both film theory and cognitive science in order\nto explicate the nature of film as a mass art (Thomson-Jones 2014,\nOther Internet Resources). For many of the standard topics in the\nphilosophy of film, interesting and important questions arise when we\nextend the discussion from analog to digital cinema. There is a\nquestion, for example, about the kinds and significance of realism\nthat can be achieved with traditional celluloid film as compared with\nmanipulated digital imagery (Gaut 2010: 60\u201397). The philosophy\nof film can provide some of the initial terms of analysis for artworks\nin a broad range of digital media. At the same time, it is important\nto approach each of the digital arts on their own terms under the\nassumption that the digital is an artistically significant\ncategory.\n4. Interactivity\n\nMore and more, contemporary artists are taking advantage of the\ndynamic and responsive capabilities of digital media to make art\ninteractive. The experimental online literature, conceptual browser\nart, and videogames mentioned above all require user interactivity,\nbut they do so to varying degrees. Therefore, if interactivity plays a\ndistinctive role in the digital arts, there are good reasons to\nanalyse the nature of these works more deeply.\n4.1 Defining Interactive Works\n\nNot all digital works are interactive, and not all interactive works\nare digital. However, since computers are inherently interactive, much\nof the early philosophical literature on interactivity arose from the\nemergence of computer art (also see Smuts 2009; Lopes 2001; Saltz\n1997). The distinctive character of interactive digital art is best\nconsidered in tandem with the work\u2019s ontology.\n\nBefore analyzing interactivity any further, first, consider the\nfollowing description of the digital installation \u201cUniverse of\nWater Particles on a Rock where People Gather\u201d (henceforth,\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d) by TeamLab:\n\n\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d is reproduced in a virtual\nthree-dimensional space. Water is simulated to fall onto the rock, and\nthe flow of the water draws the shape of the waterfall. The water is\nrepresented by a continuum of numerous water particles and the\ninteraction between the particles is then calculated. Lines are drawn\nin relation to the behavior of the water particles. The lines are then\n\u201cflattened\u201d using what TeamLab considers to be\n\u201cultrasubjective\u201d space.\n\nWhen a person stands on the rock or touches the waterfall, they too\nbecome like a rock that changes the flow of water. The flow of water\ncontinues to transform in real time due to the interaction of people.\nPrevious visual states can never be replicated, and will never reoccur\n(TeamLab 2018).\n\n\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d illustrates that interactive\nworks permit us to appreciate both the work and the properties brought\nabout by the interactions. To define these characteristics of\ninteractive art, Dominic Lopes states, \u201cA work of art\nis interactive just in case it prescribes that the\nactions of its users help generate its\ndisplay\u201d (Lopes 2010:36, original emphasis). The display is\nanything that is instanced in a work, or the perceptual properties\nthat come about via interactivity. Users help generate these features\nmaking interactive works distinctive. However, at this point, one\ncould imagine reading the chapters of, let us say, a digitized copy of\nThe Brothers Karamazov in random order, thereby changing what\nproperties get instanced from the original work. Does this example\nqualify as interactive art in the Lopesian sense? Although some\nstories, such as choose-your-own-adventure books, allow readers to\nshuffle the narrative arc, most traditional stories do not; if the\nrandomized Karamazov example is interactive, it is only so in\nthe weakest sense of the term because users are not\nprescribed to change the properties as described. Another way\nto think about these differences returns us to a work\u2019s\nstructure. Readers who decide to roguishly randomize a story merely\nchange how they access a work\u2019s structure simply\nbecause the medium does not prohibit it, whereas readers of\nchoose-your-own-adventure books and other interactive works can change\nthe work\u2019s structure in a prescribed manner (Lopes\n2001:68).\n4.2 Display Variability\n\nThat users are responsible for generating certain features of an\ninteractive work means that their displays, unlike those of\nnon-interactive works, can occur in a couple of different ways (Lopes\n2010: 37-38). The less standard of the two occurs when the displays of\nan interactive work are generated in a succession of states over a\nperiod of time, but where none of the displays can be revisited. One\nsuch example is Telegarden, a temporary work of computer art\nthat users accessed from a networked computer. The work was comprised\nof a table with an attached mechanical arm that dispensed water and\nfood for the plants via the users\u2019 inputs. As one may imagine,\nthe garden took shape in a variety of ways over the span of its\nexhibition, but each state of the garden, or its succession of display\nstates, could not be repeated. Although not common, videogames can\nalso exhibit this kind of display variability. Consider the\nexperimental game, Cube. For a limited time, players could\nexplore a large cube and its nested smaller cubes while racing to be\nthe first to reach the center. As with Telegarden, players\ngenerated different properties of the game displays by interacting\nwith it, but once a new display was generated, the previous ones were\ngone.\n\nThe more standard of the two variable structures for interactive works\nare displays that can be repeated, such as most net art and videogames\nthat can be accessed many times, from multiple locations, to generate\ndifferent displays. Although repeatable works are more common (at\nleast with videogames if not museum-housed works), more needs to be\nsaid about the changing properties of these works and how the\nrepeatability trait distinguishes interactive digital works from\nnon-interactive digital images.\n\nIf the display properties of digital images can vary from instance to\ninstance due to even slightly different settings on different devices\n(e.g., brightness, resolution, intensity), then the aesthetic and\nstructural differences of many works could be misconstrued as\ninteractive. Since the example just given is not an interactive work\nof art, it is worth looking more closely at what is going on with\nnon-interactive repeatable works versus interactive repeatable ones.\nConsider traditional performance works such as works of theater and\nmusic. Each performance might differ to a slight degree due to\ndifferent performers and other varying conditions of the environment,\nand these may certainly affect our aesthetic experiences each time.\nHowever, those changes, in principle, do not reshape the structure of\nthe performed play or song. In the same way, the subtle changes made\nwith a digitally displayed image do not change the structure of the\nimage-based work. Compare those slight artistic or aesthetic\nvariations to the display variability of interactive works. For\nexample, many videogames permit players to choose which route to take,\nquests to accept, characters to kill or save, personalities to adopt,\nand the like. These sorts of in-game player choices are not merely\ngenerating features such as varying the brightness or resolution, nor\nare they as straightforwardly interactive as a game of chess that ends\nin a win or a loss. Rather, the degree of variability permits multiple\nendings. Again for comparison, while traditional tragedies will always\nend on a tragic note, some highly variable works can end either on a\ntragic note or on one that is not at all tragic.\n\nTo articulate the above more clearly, Dominic Preston says,\n\n\nfor any given artwork, each possible set of structural and aesthetic\nproperties F is a display type of that artwork. (Preston\n2014: 271, original emphasis).\n\n\nFrom the above, we can briefly infer the following scenarios: works\nlike digital photographs are ontologically similar to plays and music\nbecause they consist of one prescribed display type. While the display\ntype might permit multiple displays (duplicates, performances,\ninstances, etc.) consisting of subtle variances between the particular\ntokens, there is still a single correct display that should be\nmaintained or achieved. Works that instance a succession of states\nsuch as Telegarden and Cube consist of multiple\npotential display types where only one display type is instantiated at\nany given time. Now, compare such works with those like videogames\nthat present us with the strong degrees of display variability\nmentioned earlier. Because some repeatable works can end drastically\ndifferently from one \u201cplaythrough\u201d to the next, there is\nno singular, correct display. Instead, these sorts of works consist of\nboth multiple display types and multiple displays, which means users\nwill generate one of the possible display types (and their displays)\neach time they repeat the work.\n\nAccording to Katherine Thomson-Jones (2021), there is a problem with\nPreston\u2019s claim that interactive artworks \u2014 at least ones\nthat are digital \u2014 have multiple display types, as well as\nmultiple displays. This is because the digital is inherently\nreplicable and replicability requires a transmissible display \u2014\na single display type that can have multiple, interchangeable\ninstances. This seems to introduce a problem of incompatibility: How\ncan we have an image whose instances still count as instances of the\nsame image-based work when those instances, in virtue of users\u2019\nactions, look very different from one another? There are various ways\none might overcome this problem \u2014 for example, by distinguishing\nbetween the display of an image and the display of an artwork that\nincorporates the image in question. Preston\u2019s distinction\nbetween display and display type can continue to play a role here.\nWhile the concept of interactivity with high variability is mostly\napplicable to videogames, one can imagine interactive digital\ninstallations, net art, and table-top roleplaying games to which it\nalso applies.\n\nIt is important to reiterate that the strong interactivity just\ndescribed is not restricted to the digital. Whilst interactivity is a\nstandard feature of many contemporary digital works, and the\nresponsiveness of such works is remarkable, non-digital appreciative\ncategories can also exploit a similar degree of display variability.\nFor example, literature, theater, and tabletop role-playing games can\nbe strongly interactive in ways similar to many digital artworks. What\nis unique about all such works are the ways in which things like\nimmersion, agency, identity, and fiction, to list a few features, are\nimpacted by interactivity, due to the user\u2019s role in the work\n(for more, see Robinson & Tavinor 2018; Patridge 2017; Meskin\n& Robson 2016).\n\nA noteworthy point about the concepts presented above is that they are\nall conceived with the norms of traditional art and art practices in\nmind, meaning, works of art that are predominantly object-based.\nHowever, as described, interactive digital works can be said to have a\n\u201cbehavior\u201d based on prescribed interactions. While\ntraditional artworks typically emphasize a work that is complete prior\nto audience engagement, interactive works emphasize the\nmoment-to-moment unfolding of the works by way of audience engagement.\nOne recent approach to the ontology of art suggests that interactive\nworks (among other kinds) are better conceived on a process-based,\nrather than on an object-based, model (Nguyen 2020). A key difference\nbetween the two models is that the former focuses on the user\u2019s\nactions and experiences or \u201cinward aesthetics\u201d, while the\nlatter focuses on the \u201coutward\u201d aesthetic features of the\nself-contained object (Nguyen 2020: 25). While a process-based account\nprioritizes the internalizability of a user\u2019s actions, it does\nnot completely give up the idea of an artistic object. Rather, it\nrenders the object\u2019s significance secondary insofar as any\nappreciation for a work\u2019s objecthood is in service to the\nactivities it permits (Nguyen 2020: 20).\n4.3 Interactivity and Creativity\n\nJust as the case of digital art can enrich our understanding of\ninteractivity, so it can enrich our understanding of artistic\ncreativity and creative attribution. This is in part because the\nissues of interactivity and creativity are closely related. In making\na work that is strongly interactive, an artist cedes to the user a\ncertain amount of control in determining the look, sound, or structure\nof the work\u2019s display(s). This raises a question about the\nuser\u2019s opportunities to be creative \u2014 to engage in\ncreative interactions with a work \u2014 and how these opportunities\ncan be supported or constrained by the artist\u2019s design. In order\nto answer this question, we need to unpack the notion of creative\ncontrol. In addition, we need to consider how creativity can be\nattributed to multiple agents involved at different stages of a\nwork\u2019s production. As it turns out, the case of AI art is\nparticularly useful when considering the conditions of creativity and\ncreative collaboration.\n\nThere is already a robust debate about the nature of creativity as it\noccurs in many different areas of human activity (see, e.g., Gaut\n& Kieran, eds., 2018; Paul & Kaufman, eds., 2014) There is a\ncase to be made, however, that this debate can be enriched by drawing\non work in the philosophy of AI. In everyday life, sophisticated AI\nsystems are now being used for all kinds of purposes: We rely on these\nsystems when we use Internet search engines, play strategic\nvideogames, accept purchasing recommendations from online retailers,\nand check for viruses on our computers. In addition, we can use AI to\ngenerate new images and text, some of which can be incorporated into\nworks of art. One can type a series of prompts into a chatbot like\nChatGPT in order to generate a new screenplay in a certain genre.\nSimilarly, one can assemble a set of images on which to train an\n\u201cartbot\u201d like MidJourney in order to generate paintings,\ndrawings, or what look like photographs. It is common to attribute\ncreative agency to the person who purposively initiates, and then\nmonitors, the program used to generate the images or text that make up\na work of AI art. A question remains, however, as to whether this\nshould be the sole creative attribution when AI is involved.\nSome artists describe the AI system with which they work as a creative\n\u201cpartner\u201d, and not just a sophisticated artistic tool.\nThis is particularly the case with recent artworks that rely on\n\u201cDeep Learning\u201d (DL) to generate images or text in a\nremarkably independent way. Both chatbots and artbots rely on deep\nlearning to categorize huge datasets (images or text) according to\npreviously undetected patterns. To do this, a DL system must give\nitself new instructions \u2014 ones that depart from the initial\ninstructions of the program \u2014 for the kind of image or text\nsegment, and for the particular image or text segment, to be\nproduced.\n\nAmong AI artists, the ones who write their own DL programs are the\nmost likely to describe AI as a creative partner rather than just a\ncreative tool. This seems particularly fitting when there is a\nsynchronous collaboration between the artist and their DL system. For\nexample, the works of Sougwen Chun are the result of Chun drawing\nalongside and in response to the actions of a mechanical drawing arm\nthat is controlled by Chun\u2019s custom-made program, D.O.U.G. (short\nfor \u201cDrawing Operations Unity Generation X\u201d).\nChun and D.O.U.G. take turns adding to a single drawing. During this\nprocess, it is harder than one might think to say what makes the\ndifference such that Chun is a creative agent, engaged in a creative\ndrawing process, and D.O.U.G. is not. This is the case even though it\nis Chun alone who comes up with the idea for the work and initiates\nthe drawing program.\n\nAs Margaret Boden has argued (2014), when philosophers deny the\npossibility of a computer ever being creative, they tend to\nunderestimate the capacities of computers to produce items that are\ngenuinely new as well as valuable in some domain. Still, many\ncreativity theorists argue that novelty and value are insufficient for\ncreativity; a third condition is needed, one concerning the manner of\nproduction. In order for something novel and valuable to count as\ncreative, it must have been produced in a way that is agent-driven.\nThe agency condition can be filled out, or broken down, in a variety\nof ways. At its core, however, the notion of agency is generally\nassumed to be opposed to the notion of having been\n\u2018programmed\u2019, or simply instructed, to perform certain\ntasks in a \u201cmechanical\u201d, or blind, fashion. Thus, the most\nbasic objection to the possibility of creative computers is that they\ncan only do what they are programmed to do, according to the\nintentions of a human agent. This objection needs clarification,\nhowever, since no set of rules completely determines the actions\ninvolved in following that set of rules. Since the advent of DL and\nother kinds of generative algorithm, it is possible for a computer\nprogram to change itself, to detect independent phenomena other than\nthe ones that it was designed to detect, and to mimic spontaneity\nthrough randomness. Is this an instance of creative rule-following? If\nit is, we might expand our notion of creative collaboration. Perhaps\ncreative collaboration is found, not just between human beings, but\nalso between human beings and machines. In so far as the machines in\nquestion support strong interactivity, a work of digital art might\ninvolve three-part collaborations between human artists, human users,\nand AI.\n5. Locative Art\n\nDigital media can also be used for the purpose of connecting physical\nlocations to virtual ones by using locative media. The phrase\n\u201clocative art\u201d is traced to Karlis Kalnins who applied the\nphrase to experimental projects coming from Locative Media Lab, a\ncollective of international researchers and practitioners working with\nlocative media. (Galloway & Ward 2005 ). Since the term\n\u201clocative\u201d is connected to location, site-specificity\nplays a significant role in our appreciation of locative works. Unlike\nwith non-digital cases, however, site-specificity in locative art is\nboth physical and virtual. The general concept is this:\nlocative-specific media connect physical spaces with virtual ones, the\nperceptual features of which are generated from a digital device by\nhuman interactions. We often experience locative media in our ordinary\nand daily lives through navigation systems like Google Maps or Waze,\nand also creatively through augmented reality apps like Pokemon Go, AR\ngraffiti (an app that allows users to visualize what their graffiti\nwill look like in situ), architectural simulators, and more.\nThese are location-based works, often called locative projects or\nlocative art, that use locative media. While locative technology has\nbeen around for decades, it is a relatively new subcategory to be\nrecognized within the arts. Even so, locative art is more broadly\nacknowledged in the fields of technology, games, and sociology.\n\nTo understand the many ways locative media might be used for artistic\npractice, consider the following three examples.\n\nWhat Was There (2010\u20132023) was a website that allows users\nto type in the coordinates of their current location (via their\ndigital device) to see how certain geographical locations look\nthroughout history. By typing a specific address into the application,\nthe user experiences the physical location in front of them and\nrepresented images and facts of that location as they appeared in the\npast, from the same vantage point. Data on the site relies on regular\ncitizens to upload historic images and connect them to specific\nlocations, making them accessible to others; the greater the\nparticipation the richer the experience when navigating a particular\nplace. Not only can guests gain a deeper connection to their specific\nlocalized places, but such applications motivate people to explore and\nappreciate locations outside of their normal destinations. \nThe Transborder Immigrant Tool has been used in a number of\nartworks and exhibitions.\n\n\n\nThe Transborder Immigrant Tool, devised by Electronic Disturbance\nTheater 2.0/b.a.n.g. lab, was a mobile phone application intended to\nguide individuals who were making their way to the United States\nthrough the deserts of the U.S./Mexico borderlands to water. The\napplication delivered poetry to its users in an effort to assist in\ntheir emotional and mental well-being while offering information about\nsurvival during the dangerous journey.\n\nThe creators of The Transborder Immigrant Tool considered it to be a\nperformance intervention that included the app itself, its API, public\nreactions, and an ensuing government investigation. By the time TBT\nwas ready for distribution in 2011, the border crossing had become\nmore dangerous, presenting the risk that carrying a TBT phone might\nput users in danger. While the project was never distributed to its\nintended users, it still succeeded in confounding systems of political\ncontrol, creating a call to action that resonated internationally, and\nusing poetry to \u201cdissolve\u201d the US-Mexico border\n(Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0 et al 2007).\n\n\nKlingKlangKlong is played with smartphones that translate the\nplayers\u2019 locations into sound. This is achieved in a\nstraightforward manner: By moving through the physical space, the\nplayers simultaneously move on the surface of a virtual sequencer. One\ndimension (usually the latitude of the player) corresponds to pitch,\nthe other dimension (longitude) is mapped to the time-position on the\nsequencer. The interface allows a manual switch to other audio\nparameters, although this feature is experimental. Each device\nreceives the location and state changes of the currently active\nplayers almost instantly. The devices are connected by a central\nserver, which also sets the boundaries of the playing field and\nmanages the virtual players.\n\n\n\nKlingKlangKlong serves as an experimental arrangement to explore the\nidea of playful (social) systems, a construction where human and\nvirtual subsystems play with each other. In addition to the human\nparticipants, it therefore deploys a number of virtual players\n(\u00bbVirtuals\u00ab). Humans and Virtuals meet each other in mixed\nreality, a concept that was realized in early locative games. The\ncommonly created soundtrack is the primary medium of communication\nbetween the players. Musical structures may temporarily arise through\nsynchronized movements or be destroyed by any player\u2019s\nintervention (Straeubig & Quack 2016).\n\n\n\nIn each of these examples, users synchronize geographical locations\nwith virtual ones, granting mobility for users while also further\nchallenging the paradigm of museum-driven works and art appreciation.\nThe interactivity described in section 4 factors significantly into\neach of these projects, but also of importance are the social,\neconomic, environmental, and political implications that factor in the\ndesign, development, and use of such works. Most of these projects are\nintended to bring about positive change, one way or another, by using\nlocative media and by borrowing certain gaming mechanics for the\npurpose of engagement and interactivity. In fact, much of what is\nwritten about locative art is from fields within digital media studies\non the media\u2019s \u2018playable\u2019 qualities (avoiding the\nidea that artists are trying to merely gamify public spaces).\n\nOn the playable nature of locative art, Miguel Sicart says,\n\n\n\nthe data produced and used in smart cities should not necessarily be\npresented as a utility for citizens. It should be presented as a prop\nfor play, as games but also as the source for toys and playgrounds.\nData-rich cities can become playable cities, and, by becoming such,\nthey can become more human, more inclusive spaces (Ackermann: 2016,\n27).\n\n\n\nOnce again, the process-oriented and performative nature of locative\nworks is central to appreciating the spaces they create. In connection\nwith the playability of locative media, locative projects are also\nmodifiable and typically intended to be hackable by the public in the\ncommunities where they are displayed. While the terms\n\u201chacker\u201d and \u201chacking\u201d may carry negative\nconnotations, in its original conception, the practice of hacking was\nmeant to improve upon existing computer programs, acknowledging the\nachievements of both the original creator and subsequent revisionists\n(Levy:1984). It is in this vein that locative projects are usually\nintended to change and improve over time given how users\n\u201cplay\u201d with the data and inputs. In other words, local\ncommunities can play with these projects and even modify them, making\nlocative works as relevant and reflective of the community as\npossible.\n\nThe above suggests that locative projects often have broader goals\nthan mere entertainment. Although often intended to motivate play and\nplayful attitudes, which, as indicated in the examples above can occur\nto varying degrees, the goal-oriented nature of locative works often\nmakes the kind of play involved a \u201cserious\u201d kind. Serious\nplay occurs when the enjoyment and pleasure that come from play do not\njust comprise entertainment but also serve some meritorious,\nreal-world goal. A work can be said to support serious play even when\nusers are not aware of the social or political goals of the work.\n\nThe customizable nature of locative media lends itself well to the\naltruistic aims of many locative artists. However, inclusivity,\nclimate protection, social change, and any other desired effect of\nlocative projects requires a given community to have sufficient funds\nfor, access to, and user-knowledge about digital locative technology.\nThis concern can also be understood, not just in terms of community\nrequirements, but also in terms of technological requirements, for\nsuccessful locative art. One way of putting it is as follows:\n\n\nFor any technological device to be \u201caware\u201d of its\ncontext\u2014physical or otherwise\u2014it has to be able to locate,\nclassify, collect, store, and use \u201crelevant\u201d information,\nas well as to identify and discard or ignore \u201cirrelevant\u201d\ninformation (Galloway & Ward 2005).\n\n\nThere are numerous political and economic factors affecting access to\nlocal and global spaces. With locative art, these factors are\nconcerning for both ethical and artistic reasons.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackermann, Judith, Andreas Rauscher, Andreas and Daniel Stein,\n2016, <em>Introduction: Playin\u2019 the city.
