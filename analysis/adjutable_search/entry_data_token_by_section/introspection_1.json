No major contemporary\nphilosopher believes that all of mentality is available to be\ndiscovered by introspection. For example, the cognitive processes\ninvolved in early visual processing and in the detection of phonemes\nare generally held to be introspectively impenetrable and nonetheless\n(in some important sense) mental (Marr 1983; Fodor 1983). Many\nphilosophers also accept the existence of unconscious beliefs or\ndesires, in roughly the Freudian sense, that are not introspectively\navailable (e.g., Gardner 1993; Velleman 2000; Moran 2001; Wollheim\n2003; though see Lear 1998). Although in ordinary English usage we\nsometimes say we are \u201cintrospecting\u201d when we reflect on\nour character traits, contemporary philosophers of mind generally do\nnot believe that we can directly introspect character traits in the\nsame sense in which we can introspect some of our other mental states\n(especially in light of research suggesting that we sometimes have\npoor knowledge of our traits, reviewed in Taylor and Brown 1988;\nPaulhus and John 1998; Vazire 2010).\n\nThe two most commonly cited classes of introspectible mental states\nare attitudes, such as beliefs, desires, evaluations, and\nintentions, and conscious experiences, such as emotions,\nimages, and sensory experiences. (These two groups may not be wholly,\nor even partially, disjoint: Depending on other aspects of her view, a\nphilosopher may regard some or all conscious experiences as involving\nattitudes, and/or she may regard attitudes as things that are or can\nbe consciously experienced.) It of course does not follow from the\nfact (if it is a fact) that some attitudes are introspectible that all\nattitudes are, or from the fact that some conscious experiences are\nintrospectible that all conscious experiences are. Some accounts of\nintrospection focus on attitudes (e.g., Nichols and Stich 2003), while\nothers focus on conscious experiences (e.g., Hill 1991; Goldman 2006;\nSchwitzgebel 2012); and it is sometimes unclear to what extent\nphilosophers intend their remarks about the introspection of one type\nof target to apply to the other type. There is no guarantee that the\nsame mechanism or process is involved in introspecting all the\ndifferent potential targets.\n\nGenerically, this article will describe the targets of introspection\nas mental states, though in some cases it may be more apt to\nthink of the targets as processes rather than states. Also, in\nspeaking of the targets of introspection as targets, no\npresupposition is intended of a self-detection view of introspection\nas opposed to a self-shaping or containment or expressivist view (see\nSection 2 below). The targets are simply the states self-ascribed as a\nconsequence of the introspective process if the process works\ncorrectly, or if the introspective process fails, the states that\nwould have been self-ascribed.\n",
