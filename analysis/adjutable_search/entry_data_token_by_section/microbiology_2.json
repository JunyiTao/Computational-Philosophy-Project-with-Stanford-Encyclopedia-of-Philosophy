    "main_text": "Reasons to Pay Attention to Microbes || Biological reasons\n2.1 Biological reasons\n\nAlthough \u201cbiological\u201d can refer to a multitude of\nphenomena, the focus here is on the ecology and evolution of microbes.\nEcology and evolution not only work together to explain the properties\nof particular microorganismal groups, but also reveal the broad\nbiological relevance of microorganisms to all life, and to human quality of life.\n2.1.1 Ecological reasons\n\nA basic reason to pay attention to microbes can be inferred from\nclaims that humans live in a fundamentally microbial world (e.g.,\nStaley et al. 1997). Statements of this sort refer to the\npervasiveness of microbes throughout the planet, and the fundamental\ncontributions they make to every ecosystem. Two aspects of microbial\nprocesses in the world stand out to make this view possible:\nbiogeochemical cycles and microbial symbiosis. Both matter a great deal to human existence, from the maintenance of the planet as we know it to the health of our own bodies.\n\nBiogeochemical cycles are what make the planet \u201cfunction\u201d\nin any sense. On Earth today, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen cycles are\nparticularly obvious. These cycles are interdependent, and display a\ndegree of stability over geological time (e.g., oxygen has made up 21%\nof the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for almost half a billion years,\ndespite extraordinary fluctuations in lifeforms and physical features\nof the planet such as temperature). Although geological processes\nsustain such cycles over very long timescales, the world humans\nexperience is largely a product of far more rapid microbial\ninteractions. Microbes \u201crun\u201d most of these cycles as they\ngenerate energy from chemical compounds and light (Falkowski et al.\n2008; Jelen et al. 2016). Microorganisms prevail even when they\ncomprise less of the biomass involved than macroorganisms\nparticipating in the same process. For example, plants form the\nphysical bulk of organisms involved in carbon and oxygen cycles\n(Bar-On et al. 2018), but a large amount of that biomass is made up of\nnon-living material in woody plants. This material is often called\n\u201cheartwood\u201d, and it does not contribute actively to\nbiogeochemical cycles (Chattaway\n 1952).[4]\n In fact, the very tendency of microbes not to hoard elements in the\nform of biomass and instead, to have a high turnover of metabolizing\npopulations (Strom 2008; Zimmerman et al. 2020), could explain in part\nwhy there are fairly rapid biogeochemical cycles on the planet rather\nthan long-term chemical sinks.\n\nAnimals such as ourselves could not live without oxygen, which is a\npowerful electron acceptor that allows the energy investments\npermissive of large animal body size (Payne et al. 2011). Oxygen on\nthis planet would not have become available were it not for pioneering\noxygen-producing microbes, which are photosynthesizers called\ncyanobacteria. They not only began to excrete oxygen almost three\nbillion years ago, but their very capacity to do so was forcibly\ncaptured by later eukaryotes and eventually led to algae, plants, and\nthe planet we know today. In a distal causal sense, therefore,\nphilosophy is possible because of bacterial photosynthesis.\n\nThe chemical cycling carried out by microbes occurs not only at a\nmacroscale with planetary implications, but also internally, in our\nvery own bodies. Symbiosis, the intimate \u201cliving together\u201d\nof different organisms, is a key organizational motif of the microbial\nworld, but it reaches far beyond microorganisms to encompass every\n(relatively) large living thing. Long recognized and conceptually\ndebated, symbiosis is usually deemed to include a variety of\nrelationship types: negative consequences for one of the organisms\n(parasitic), positive outcomes for both (mutualistic), and various\nmixes of beneficial and \u201cnon-harm, non-help\u201d relationships\n(commensal) between microbes and their partners (Saffo 1992; Sapp\n2004).\n\nA classic symbiotic relationship is found in lichens, which are made\nof tightly integrated fungi and photosynthesizing microbes (algae,\ncyanobacteria or both). Although the contributing organisms reproduce\nseparately, they form similarly organized units of lichen, generation\nafter generation. Benefits are often thought to accrue for both\npartners, and are cashed out as higher reproductive fitness (Honegger\n1998; however, cf. Hyv\u00e4rinen et al. 2002). Many other symbioses\nare intimate and persistent, but more obviously manipulate at least\none of the partners in the arrangement. A curious example is the\nbacterium Wolbachia in insects. This bacterium is obligately\npart of the insect reproductive process. It can \u201cfeminize\u201d\ninsect embryos and kill males to ensure its own reproduction (Werren\net al. 2008). But despite Wolbachia hijacking the insect for\nits own reproductive requirements, there are variable fitness benefits\nfor its host (e.g., Fry et al. 2004). In some host-symbiont systems,\nWolbachia and the insect can benefit, despite the\nmanipulation of the latter by the former.\n\nAll humans are involved in a range of ongoing stable symbioses with\nmicrobes living in and on our bodies. The majority of these microbes\nare in the gut, but the skin, lungs, and every bodily orifice are\npopulated by multiple groups of interacting microorganisms. Many of\nthe microbes in our gut are not really helping or harming us: they are\nthere to take advantage of the nutritional resources that are so\nplentiful in the intestines. Our body\u2019s immune response controls\nand manages them so they are at least not detrimental, even if they\nare ineliminable. Inescapable symbiosis implies, however, that human\nbodies are intrinsically and inseparably microbial ecosystems. Whether\nthis is meaningful in any philosophical sense will be discussed in\ndetail in\n Section 5.\n Human bodies are not where this question ends, however.\n\nBecause symbiotic microorganisms are tiny and pervade all ecosystems,\nand because such symbioses contribute so much metabolically to the\noverall biochemical activity on the Earth, some theorists have been\nmoved to suggest what is known as the Gaia hypothesis of the living\nEarth. In this view, Gaia is the total complex of \u201catmosphere,\nbiosphere, oceans and soils\u201d that is regulated by \u201ca\nfeedback or cybernetic system which seeks an optimal physical and\nchemical environment for the biota\u201d (Margulis & Lovelock\n1974: 473). Microorganisms are given primary mechanistic\nresponsibility for such regulatory effects, even though all life\nparticipates in self-maintenance of the wider system. Many biologists\nand philosophers remain unpersuaded by the Gaia hypothesis (see Resnik\n1992; Pigliucci 2014); nevertheless, it is worthy of mention as an\ninstance in which the versatility, abundance, minuteness and\npervasiveness of microbes lead to them being given a powerful\necological status for their roles in determining the way life works on\nEarth.\n2.1.2 Evolutionary reasons\n\nAnother way in which microbes have a dominating role in biology is\nbecause so very much of Earth\u2019s evolutionary history is devoted\nto them. Stephen Jay Gould, a microbiologically aware zoologist, is\noften quoted to capture the historical saturation of life on Earth by\n\u201cbacteria\u201d (which probably include Archaea in the sense he\nmeans\u2014see\n Table 1):\n\n\nThe most salient feature of life has been the stability of its\nbacterial mode from the beginning of the fossil record until today\nand, with little doubt, into all future time so long as the earth\nendures. This is truly the \u201cage of bacteria\u201d\u2014as it\nwas in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. (Gould 1994: 87)\n\n\nIn whatever way life began approximately 3.8 billion years ago, the\nfirst cells were something recognizably microbial, most probably\nbacterial. The next two billion years were also exclusively microbial,\nwith Bacteria and Archaea manipulating the planet\u2019s geochemistry\nto their own metabolic advantage, except when those unable to adjust\nto rising oxygen levels were wiped out by the cyanobacterial excretion\nof it. Another accidental consequence of microbial diversification was\nthe formation of eukaryotic microbes, which fewer than a billion years\nago diversified into the ancestral forms of the various multicellular\ngroups we recognize today. Most of that diversification has in fact\nhappened just in the last half billion years, in conjunction with\nongoing microbial activities, hence Gould\u2019s epithet.\n2.2 Philosophical reasons\n\nAll very well, you might say: biologists certainly should think\nmicrobes are important. But what about philosophers? What can microbes\ntell them? There are numerous debates in philosophy of biology in\nwhich neglecting microbes would seriously weaken, or at least bias,\nany philosophical conclusions that might be reached. This entry will\nfocus on three connected philosophy of biology topics: views about\nspecies, the tree of life, and major transitions in evolution. A\ndiscussion of a broader philosophy of science topic, philosophy of\nmodelling, follows in\n Section 3.\n2.2.1 Species concepts\n\nSpecies concepts might be of little philosophical interest if the only\norganisms that needed classifying were animals. The most applicable\nand conceptually well-founded species concept for animals\u2014and\nthe most familiar species concept to those outside biology\u2014is\nthe biological species concept (BSC). It says that a species is a\ngroup of organisms that can breed only within that group. Even though\nthere are some well-recognized problems in applying a single species\nconcept to all animal life (see Dupr\u00e9 2001), problem cases are\nusually seen as exceptions that do not fundamentally trouble the BSC\n(Mayr 1982; Coyne & Orr 1998; however, cf. Mallet 2008). Plants introduce additional\nbut probably surmountable problems, argue many zoologists (e.g., Mayr\n1982); unfortunately, fungi might be beyond the pale by virtue of\nresisting any such \u201cuniversal\u201d species concept (see\nPetersen & Hughes 1999). But since many fungi are unicellular, and\nexhibit all kinds of reproductive oddities, it might just be safest to\naccept the old assertion that unicellular and particularly asexual\norganisms do not and cannot form species, and thus are not exceptions\nto a universal species concept (e.g., Mayr 1987). These are just some\nof the issues that arise when venturing beyond animals in attempts to\napply species concepts. In response to these sorts of issues, a range\nof other species concepts have been proposed, drawing on\nmorphological, molecular, or evolutionary characteristics such as\nforming lineages of a certain sort (see the\n SEP entry on species).\n\nMicrobes, and particularly Bacteria and Archaea, provide a treasure\ntrove of problems for species concepts. They do not sexually\nreproduce, they are not morphologically rich for the most part\n(protists are, so morphology has been a large part of their historic\nclassification), and they do not form the right sort of reproductively\nisolated lineages. Importantly, whatever lineage-like interpretations\ncan be made of their descent relationships are confounded by major and\npromiscuous episodes of gene transfer between these otherwise distinct\nlineages (Doolittle 1999; Martin 1999; Gogarten et al. 2002). As soon\nas philosophers consider microbes, especially Bacteria and Archaea,\nthey usually default to a pluralistic view of species concepts. It is\none thing to find a concept that mostly works for animals and even\nplants, but it is more or less universally admitted that no single\nconcept works across the entirety of the diversity of the tree of\nlife, on any reconstruction of that tree (Dupr\u00e9 2001;\nEreshefsky 1998, 2010; Doolittle & Zhaxybayeva 2009).\n2.2.2 The tree of life\n\nThe tree of life is a representation of species in the form of lineage\nrelationships, or at least that is how it is commonly interpreted\n(Ragan 2009; O\u2019Malley et al. 2010). By making inferences from\npresent-day data back to ancestral states, including common ancestry\nand divergence points, evolutionary biologists can build phylogenies,\nwhich not only capture evolutionary relationships but also give them\napproximate dates. Phylogenies have traditionally been constructed on\nthe basis of morphological data, including fossils, but the last few\ndecades have seen the rapid rise of molecular phylogenies. The use of\ngene and protein sequences, plus computational methods, has allowed\nfar finer grained and more extensive reconstructions of all life on\nthe tree (including organisms with limited morphological characters,\nsuch as microbes and fungi).\n\nHowever, one unanticipated consequence of such a proliferation of data\nand trees has been the repeated finding that many prokaryotic\norganisms exchange genes between lineages, including genes of major\nlineage-defining importance. The extent and significance of such\ntransfers is such that the standard method of constructing a\nphylogeny, in the form of a graph-theoretic representation of lineages\nadmitting only vertical descent, is violated. In addition, molecular\ndata reveals the extent of hybridization in multicellular organisms\n(Mallet et al. 2016). The\ntree of life therefore becomes a questionable construct (Doolittle\n& Bapteste 2007; Dagan & Martin 2009), both metaphysically and\npragmatically. At the very least, any philosopher reflecting on the\ntree of life and what it represents will have to consider microbial\nevolution (Velasco 2010).\n2.2.3 Major transitions in evolution\n\nMajor transitions have been a focal topic in philosophy of biology\nsince John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s book,\nThe Major Transitions in Evolution (1997). They focused on\nkey transitions in the history of life on Earth ranging from the\norigin of cells to the origin of sex to the origin of language.\nPhilosophical discussion of the major transitions in evolution largely\nrevolves around efforts to find a unifying theme to bind major\ntransitions into a single theory (the same aspiration that drives many\nspecies and tree of life discussions). A common choice for that theme\nhas been individuality, meaning any major transition in evolution is\nunderstood to involve most centrally a transition in evolutionary\nindividuality (e.g., Ratcliff et al. 2017; Michod 2011; however, cf.\nO\u2019Malley and Powell 2016). But irrespective of any particular\ntheoretic commitment to the nature of evolutionary transitions,\nmicrobial evolution is crucial for understanding the various\ntransformations life on Earth made on the way to its current state.\nThis is very much the case even if theorists want to understand only\nthe evolution of eukaryotes, or even if they care exclusively about\nthe origin of metazoa\u2014the \u201ckingdom\u201d within\neukaryotes to which humans\n belong.[5]\n\nEukaryotes are organisms characterized by intracellular complexity,\nand in particular, by the compartmentalizing organelles within their\ncells. Most prokaryotes do not exhibit the same degree of\ncompartmentalization (however, cf. Murat et al. 2010). The majority of\neukaryotes are unicellular (Burki et al. 2020), but the macroscopic\nones are almost all multicellular and often conspicuous. It is very\ncommon for scientists and philosophers to consider bodily bulk and\nmultipart complexity as phenomena of evolutionary importance (e.g.,\nCarroll 2001). Although there can be many ecological reasons that\nsustain that impression (i.e., the sheer impact large organisms have\non environments; see Enquist et al. 2020), recent findings about the\norigins of eukaryotes might temper that view at least a little.\n\nThe long-standing view on the origin of eukaryotes is: A. That they\narose from a merger of a bacterium and an archaeon; and B. That this\nunique lineage flourished and carved out its own \u201cdomain\u201d\nspace in phylogeny (see\n Table 1).\n Being a domain is at least partly justified by the diversity and\ncomplexity of the organisms that comprise eukaryotes (Butterfield\n2014): plants, animals, fungi and protists. Recently, however,\ndiscoveries have been made of a diverse group of Archaea, known as the\nAsgard clade. Theoretically important eukaryotic features have been\ninferred from their genes (Eme et al. 2017). These gene-based\ninferences indicate that eukaryotes fit firmly within the\ndomain of Archaea, where they form a rather morphologically\nheterogeneous group, but nevertheless remain subordinated to their\nbasic archaeal identity (Williams et al. 2020). The same inferences\nalso suggest that eukaryotes originated gradually, driven by gene\ndiversification of various sorts (including gene transfers), and that\nthe endosymbiotic acquisition of the bacterium that became the\nmitochondrion possibly occurred late in the evolutionary story (Pittis\n& Gabald\u00f3n 2016). In other words, this\n\u201ctransition\u201d is not primarily driven by a transformation\nin individuality, and is first and foremost a story about\ndiversification within Archaea. Many details are still to be divulged\nabout the extant relatives of the group of Archaea closest to\neukaryotes, but a clear message is already available: understanding\nthe origin of eukaryotes requires understanding the evolution of\nArchaea.\n\nA similar lesson can be learned even when moving further along the\nhistoric branches of a schematic tree of life to gain insight into the\norigin and diversification of metazoans. Although classic schemes do\nnot include the origin of metazoans as a major transition, it is\nnevertheless a diversification of particular importance from a human\nperspective (Carroll 2001). Even if the origin of eukaryotes is\nthought to be uninteresting, because their original state is\nnecessarily unicellular, nobody would disagree that the origin of\nmetazoans is highly pertinent to understanding human evolution, since\nall metazoans are multicellular and humans are a group within\nthem.\n\nInterestingly, however, much of the recent progress in understanding\nthe origin of metazoans depends on findings about close unicellular\nrelatives of animals, particularly choanoflagellates as well as\nslightly more distant protists called filastereans and\nichthyosporeans. Genomic and experimental analyses of these organisms\nhave allowed evolutionary inferences about genes and features once\nthought to be exclusively metazoan. It turns out that the genetic\nbases of many characteristics once thought of as unique to metazoan\nevolution are also found in closely related unicellular organisms.\nAdhesion capacities, developmental signalling pathways, and\n\u201cmetazoan-specific\u201d gene regulatory factors\u2014all\nfeatures not normally thought of as properties of unicellular\norganisms\u2014long pre-existed metazoan origins\n(King et al. 2008; Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al. 2017). Moreover,\nmany of these extant unicellular relatives of metazoans turn into\ndifferent cell types as they transition to different stages in their\nlife cycles. Some stages form sophisticated multicellular\narrangements, which may sometimes be driven by interactions with\nbacteria (Alegado et al. 2012; Woznica et al. 2016). The moral of this\nstory is thus becoming familiar: even the evolutionary divergence of\nthe organisms considered the most complex (because of giving rise to\nourselves) needs a microbial perspective.\n\nSo far, this entry has discussed microbes from a \u201cmicrobes-eye\nperspective\u201d of biological classification, ecology and\nevolution. But of course there is a whole scientific field called\nmicrobiology, which is a collection of methods designed specifically\nto reveal what is going on in the microbial world. We now\nexamine more directly that science and some of its philosophical\nimplications.\n3. Microbiological Science\n\n\nMicrobiology of the future will become the primary biological science,\nthe base upon which our future understanding of the living world\nrests, and the font from which new understanding of it flows. (from\njournal summary of Woese\n 1994[6])\n\n\nAlthough it can be argued that microbiology began with microscopy in\nthe early seventeenth century (e.g., Gest 2004; Lane 2015), the\ndisciplinary starting point for bacteriology and eventually\nmicrobiology is usually bestowed on its experimental turn a couple of\ncenturies later (Bulloch 1938). Early microscopy allowed observational\nmicrobiology for sure, but it gave rise to limited classification, and\neven more limited insights into what microbes could do consistently.\nThe second half of the nineteenth century is when experimentation on\nmicrobes was codified, with the aim of understanding the specific and\nstable effects of particular microorganisms on disease in animals and\nplants. A central part of this emerging tradition involved pure\nculture techniques, Koch\u2019s postulates, and germ theory. Each of\nthese has ongoing philosophical ramifications.\n\nMedicine changed fundamentally in the later part of the nineteenth\ncentury, and many historians of medicine locate the scrutiny of\nmicroorganisms via experimental laboratory methods at the heart of\nthis transformation (e.g., Worboys 2000; Kreuder-Sonnen 2016). Pure\nculture, in which isolated and putatively causal microorganisms are\ngrown in laboratories, was the first step. Normally, bacteria and\nother microbes live in complex multispecies communities. Such\ncommunities, however, are useless for identifying and intervening on\nthe causes of diseases. Various innovations of nineteenth-century\nlaboratory science (glassware, growth media, identification methods,\nmicrography) enabled verifiable pure cultures of single species to be\ngrown independently of their host organisms. Such cultures in turn\nallowed Koch\u2019s postulates for causality to be implemented.\n\nKoch\u2019s postulates are a general method to identify causal\noutcomes from specific bacteria. Microorganisms isolated and grown\nfrom diseased hosts are introduced to non-diseased hosts to see if the\nsame disease obtains. Cultures from that new disease site then confirm\nthe presence and activity of the suspect microbe (Ross & Woodward\n2016; Gillies 2016). Once it could be established that these causal\neffects are highly specific and stable, the germ theory of disease\ncould then draw all such findings into one common framework with\npredictive power (e.g., tuberculosis will always be caused by a\nparticular bacterium, then known as the tubercle bacillus). The\nsystematicity and experimentality underlying germ theory thus began\nthe transformation of medicine from a purely observational and often\nanecdotal activity to an increasingly experimental and scientifically\nrobust programme of research that had therapeutic and preventive\nsuccesses (Worboys 2000; Vernon 1990). As a consequence, the\ninvestigation of bacteria and other microbes was integrated into a\nrange of established disciplines in universities, hospitals and\nindependent institutions (including industry) from the late nineteenth\ncentury onwards (Vernon 1990).\n\nThis tendency of microbiology to pervade and transform other fields is\na hallmark of the science\u2019s development. Molecular microbiology,\na product of the mid-twentieth century, amply illustrates this trend.\nFollowing the successes of germ-theoretic accounts of microbes and\ndisease, microbial biochemistry flourished as microbiologists focused\non the precise causal pathways by which microbes achieved their\neffects (whether in hosts or other environments). The laboratory\ntractability of microbes and versatility of their metabolic\naccomplishments gave rise to a vast experimental literature on\nbacterial biochemistry (e.g., Kluyver 1936; Stephenson 1939). In the\n1940s, this background lent itself to the emerging field of what\nbecame molecular biology, in which all the initial major discoveries\nwere made in microbial systems. The bacterium Escherichia\ncoli (E. coli) in particular had epistemic\n\n\nprimacy in forging our picture of the fundamentals of life\u2014the\nphysical and chemical underpinnings of gene structure, replication,\nand expression \u2026 [these and other] prokaryotes gave us the\nlanguage and much of the knowledge of molecular biology relevant to\nall organisms to this day. (Davis 2003: 154; see also Brock 1990)\n\n\nThe very identification of DNA as the material of heredity was carried\nout in bacterial and viral experimental systems (Avery et al.\n1943; Hershey & Chase\n1952). Subsequently, the expansion of molecular biology into genome\nsequencing and metagenomics (the sequencing and analysis of whole\ncommunity genomes) began and flourished in microorganisms. This\nbroader molecular scope enabled not only methodological and\ntechnological advances (see\n SEP entry on genomics and postgenomics),\n but also major evolutionary and ecological insights into the\nevolutionary history and community dynamics of large swathes of the\nbiosphere (Davis 2003; Handelsman 2004). Most new empirical insights\ninto major evolutionary transitions (as discussed in\n Subsection 2.2.3)\n are based on these genomic and metagenomic microbial\ninvestigations.\n\nBoth in the early and later developments of molecular biology,\nmicrobes functioned in many respects as general molecular models for\nbiological insight and technological development. The very fact that\nmicrobes can play this stand-in role for life in general drove many\nsuccesses in the field. However, it might be a concern that microbes\nare useful only for what they tell researchers about microbial life,\nand that the knowledge generated by microbiological investigations\nwill always be restricted to aspects of microbial biology. For\ninstance, gene regulation in the form of operons (modules of genes\ntreated as genetic regulatory units) was discovered in the bacterium\nE. coli, as well as in one of their viruses, in the 1950s\n(Jacob & Monod 1961). But although there are now known to be many\nimportant differences between bacterial and eukaryotic gene\nregulation, and different modes of gene regulation within just\nbacteria (Beckwith 2011), the E. coli operon model launched a\nwhole field of investigation driven by general expectations about how\ngene expression could be effectively controlled (Brenner et al. 1990).\nUltimately, eukaryotic gene regulation had to be studied in tractable\nmulticellular organisms in order to ascertain the additional\ncomplexities and differences of eukaryote gene regulation from the\nbacterial model.\n4. Microbes as Models\n\nThe lesson to be learned from the above historical discussion is that\neven though there are clear limits to the applicability of any model\nsystem, it is equally clear that microbes are remarkable in their\ncapacity to model living processes in general. This section elaborates\non the various ways this is the case. \n4.1 Virtues of microbial models\n\nWhile physical models of various sorts are used throughout the\nsciences, model organisms are a kind of model system particular to the\nlife sciences. \u201cModel organism\u201d typically refers to the\norganisms that are bred, propagated, and studied in laboratories in\nthe biomedical and life sciences. Classic animal examples include\nnematodes (\u201cworms\u201d), Drosophila (fruit flies) and\nmice. An important plant model is Arabidopsis\n(mustard cress). Fungi are represented by yeast, which is also used to\nmodel all eukaryotes (Botstein & Fink 2011). While a wealth of\nimportant model organism research is carried out on relatively large\norganisms, microbes are regarded as especially tractable model\nsystems. This is very much the case in experimental evolution and\necology, where microbial systems allow researchers to study dynamical\nprocesses in large populations over many generations. These modelling\ncapacities have general philosophical implications.\n\nThe methodology and epistemology of modelling with model organisms is\na topic of increasing discussion in the history and philosophy of\nscience (Ankeny & Leonelli 2011; Endersby 2007; see also the\n SEP entry on experiment in biology).\n These discussions include recent debates about what sorts of models\nmodel organisms are, and whether they qualify as genuine models. A\nnumber of philosophers of modelling classify model organisms in the\nsame category as other physical analogue models, such as the model\nairplanes used in studies of aerodynamics or the sandboxes used to\nmodel geological processes in laboratories (Weisberg 2013;\nMcClay and Dooley 1995;\n SEP entry on models in science).\n However, Levy & Currie (2015) object to this practice, arguing\nthat model organisms are not theoretical models in the sense of\ninterpreted structures studied as analogues of target systems in the\nnatural world. Instead, they see organismal models as specimens of\n(and thereby bases for extrapolation about) broader classes of\norganisms. Levy and Currie do, however, concede that in some contexts,\nsuch as experimental evolution and ecology, organismal models can play\na very similar role to that of theoretical models. Microbes are common\nchoices for this role as analogue systems in experimental\nsettings.\n\nAn early illustration of how such organismal analogues work can be\nfound in Georgii Gause\u2019s work in the 1930s modelling\ninterspecies competition. Gause wanted a simple, easily manipulable\nlaboratory system that would allow him to \u201celiminate the\ncomplicating influence of numerous secondary factors\u201d and\n\u201cunderstand the mechanism of the elementary process of the\nstruggle for existence\u201d (Gause 1934a: 92, 6). In order to\nrepresent in physical terms the logistic equation that models carrying\ncapacities for populations, Gause set up an experimental system of\npopulations of two species of paramecia, Paramecium caudatum\nand P. aurelia, both of which eat bacteria. Gause anticipated\nthat indirect competition between the species would modify one\nspecies\u2019 carrying capacity. When the paramecia were physically\nseparated, each population reached growth equilibrium, but when they\nwere put together and made to compete for the same limiting bacterial\nresources, one species drove the other extinct. This extrapolation\nfrom the logistic equation is nowadays known as the competitive\nexclusion principle, and has become a central principle in ecology\n(Hardin 1960). The mathematical and experimental model reached the\nsame conclusions.\n\nHowever, Gause then tried to use a microbial model to demonstrate the\nbasic mechanisms represented in another mathematical model of direct\ninterspecies competition (in the form of predator-prey relationships),\nthe Lotka-Volterra equations. In this case, his experimental system\nrepeatedly failed to capture the oscillating dynamics of the\nequations. This time he used one of the paramecia (P.\ncaudatum) and its unicellular predator, Didinium\nnasutum. Both species went extinct, unless Gause introduced\nadditional physical parameters or modified the mathematics (Gause\n1934b). Does this suggest that microbes simply cannot capture the\nappropriate dynamics and are unreliable as experimental\nrepresentations of mathematical models? In fact, an extensive history\nof subsequent experimentation found that the long-term oscillations\npredicted by the Lotka-Volterra equations are unrealized in\nany organismal model system unless major alterations are made\nto the basic variables. Only very recently have these oscillations\nbeen achieved over numerous generations, in an experimental model\nconsisting of unicellular algae and a microscopic metazoan predator\n(Blasius et al.\n 2020).[7]\n\n\nAn iconic contemporary example of microbial modelling is Richard\nLenski\u2019s long-term evolution experiment (Fox & Lenski 2015).\nLenski\u2019s group used a single ancestral genome of E.\ncoli to found twelve initially genetically identical populations\nin identical flask environments. They began propagating the\npopulations, by transferring a population sample from a well-mixed\nflask to a fresh flask (to replenish their resources) every 24 hours.\nLenski\u2019s group began this experiment in 1988 and it is still\ngoing today, which in early 2020 means more than 70,000 generations of\nmicrobial evolution have\n occurred.[8]\n These numbers are due to E. coli populations regenerating\njust over six times per day, with resource constraints keeping this\nnumber steady.\n\nA key original motivation of the experiment was to learn more about\nthe long-term dynamics of adaptation and diversification by studying\nevolution in real time, in a controlled setting. Because the\npopulations started out exactly the same and live in identical\nenvironments, any differences in fitness, physiology or morphology\nthat arise over time are due entirely to new mutations in clonal\nlineages (not prone to recombination). Many insights have arisen from\nthe long-term evolution experiment, including inferences about the\ndynamics of mutation, the role of chance in evolutionary trajectories,\nand the evolutionary origin of complex novel features (Fox and Lenski\n2015). While in a few cases these findings are restricted to\ninferences specifically about E. coli and similar bacteria\n(e.g., Sniegowski et al. 1997), most are considered to apply to the\nprocesses and dynamics of long-term evolution in general. In other\nwords, the microbes in the laboratory are not modelling microbes\nexclusively, but rather serving as a lens through which to understand\nmore generally the phenomena of evolving life. In some important\nrespects, these experimental systems are run like algorithms: exact\niterative procedures that lead to various outcomes, and which can be\nlooped and rerun at various points in the overall procedure.\n\nAlgorithms are of course the basis for computational simulations.\nPerhaps inspired by these structural similarities, Lenski\u2019s\ngroup and other collaborators turned their attention to an agent-based\nsimulation model called Avida (Lenski et al. 2003). In this\ncomputational model, self-replicating \u201cdigital organisms\u201d\ncompete for resources in the form of computer memory, and can\naccumulate mutations over time in their \u201cgenomes\u201d (strings\nof computer code). Lenski and colleagues are very clear that when they\nstudy Avida, just as when they study their E. coli in the\nflasks, the aim is to infer something about the evolving world at\nlarge: \u201cWhen we study this tractable system, we aim to shed\nlight on principles relevant to any evolving system\u201d (2003:\n139). Because Avida allows for open-ended exploration of evolutionary\ntrajectories via an algorithmic procedure, this way of modelling\nevolution turns out to be highly complementary to studying bacteria in\nthe laboratory.\n\nTo give an example: perhaps the most famous result from Lenski\u2019s\nlong-term evolution experiment is the origin of citrate utilization in\njust one of the twelve E. coli lineages (Blount et al.\n2008). Citrate is present\nin the bacterial growth medium and is a potential energy source, but\none that E. coli lack the ability to use aerobically (i.e.,\nin the presence of oxygen)\u2014or, at least they were unable to,\nuntil around 31,500 generations into the experiment when one strain\naccumulated the mutations relevant to growing on citrate. This new\ncapacity gave the population a relative advantage over\nnon-citrate-eating strains.\n\nTo work out how this had occurred, the researchers reconstructed the\nparticular evolutionary trajectory that led to this multi-step\ninnovation (Blount et al. 2012). They were able to do this\nstep-by-step reconstruction because of the tractability of the model\nsystem, and in particular because they had frozen regular time points\nin the evolutionary history of each bacterial lineage. Large bacterial\npopulations can be frozen and later revived; researchers can thus\nmaintain a \u201cfrozen fossil record\u201d (Lenski 2011) and\ncompare a current population\u2019s features (such as fitness or\nmorphology) to those of its ancestral population, or reconstruct steps\nin its evolutionary trajectory. In this case, frozen population\nsamples could be sequentially analyzed to infer the order of\nmutational steps. A very similar sort of reconstruction could be\ncarried out on the complex mutations occurring in the Avida simulation\n(Lenski et al. 2003). The researchers were able to rerun the computer\nmodel many times to understand every step along the way towards the\naccumulation of a complex mutation, in this case, a logic function\nmore complicated than any of the basic instructions in the digital\norganisms computer-code genomes. This allowed researchers to study the\naccumulation of mutations leading to complex novel traits in two\ncomplementary and comparable sorts of model systems.\n\nMany other small organisms have been used experimentally as living\nmodels of mathematical equations or simulations (e.g., mites,\nbeetles). But microbes are particularly tractable in that they are\neasy to maintain and propagate in a laboratory, especially compared to\nother classic model organisms like mice. This is partly because they\nare so small: huge populations of them can be kept in tiny spaces. It\nis also because some species do not need much looking after compared\nto other laboratory organisms; pop them into a flask of growth medium\n(a simple mix of a few chemicals) or smear them on an agar plate, and\ntheir populations will grow exponentially. Many laboratory cultured\nmicrobes have very short generation times compared to larger\norganisms. Some bacteria can produce tens of generations a day if not\nresource constrained, which allows for long-term evolutionary studies\nover reasonable human research timescales.\n\nBeyond these practical benefits, however, are epistemic advantages\nthat allow bacterial models to be compared very readily to\nmathematical and computational models. Population size has theoretical\nvirtues on top of the practical ones. Evolutionary theory predicts\nvery different outcomes for small versus large populations\n(Charlesworth 2002), and\nkey theoretical tools assume infinite populations (see the\n SEP entry on population genetics).\n The very large population sizes of most bacteria mean they are good\nproxies for these idealized equations. Microbial experimental systems\ncan not only serve as proxies for theoretical models, but also show\nwhen something is fundamentally wrong with the mathematical\nassumptions. In the case discussed above, Gause wanted to model the\nLotka-Volterra equations with a microbial analogue experiment. But the\nmathematical model assumes that both populations can rebound\ncontinuously from extremely low numbers, and that stochastic processes\ndo not affect these deterministic outcomes. In many actual\npopulations, the growth curves simply cannot rebound from very low\nvalues and the stable oscillations do not occur, just as Gause found.\nComputational simulations of the Lotka-Volterra equations similarly\nfind that extinction of predators or both predator and prey is\ninevitable unless additional resource limitations are introduced\n(Wilensky & Reisman 2006; Weisberg & Reisman 2008). The actual\ndetails of which models do better on what dimensions do not matter\nhere. The emphasis is on how modellers can shift back and forth from\nmathematics to computational simulations to microbial experiments\nbecause of basic structural similarities that are not overwhelmed by\norganismal complications (O\u2019Malley & Parke 2018).\n\nThe comparability of these very different media can be taken further,\nbecause of the capabilities discussed already for maintaining a\n\u201cfrozen fossil record\u201d by reviving ancestral populations\nand studying their evolutionary trajectories. This allows researchers\nto \u201cback up\u201d a population\u2019s evolutionary trajectory\nand \u201crerun\u201d it an arbitrary number of times from an\nearlier timepoint, by defrosting and reviving (repeatedly) a frozen\nancestral population sample (e.g., Travisano et al. 1995). This\nbacking up and re-running of population trajectories is very similar\nto the recursivity of algorithms in computer simulations. It also\nresonates with thought experiments such as Gould\u2019s (1989) famous\nidea about \u201creplaying the tape of life\u201d. While Gould\noriginally presented the thought experiment as a metaphor, and had in\nmind rewinding and replaying all of life on earth, long-term\nmicrobial evolution experiments show how at least a subset of\n\u201clife\u201ds tape\u2019 can actually be replayed (see Beatty\n2006 for discussion of the extent to which this sort of experimental\nwork fits Gould\u2019s ideas about his thought experiment).\n\nThought experiments such as replaying the tape of life have also been\nconsidered \u201cmental models\u201d (see\n SEP entry on thought experiments;\n Nersessian 2018), and\nphilosophers are very fond of constructing and manipulating such\nmodels to generate new insights. That microbial experimental models,\nwhich are very concrete, can potentially be compared to mental models,\nwhich are very abstract, might seem surprising at first glance. But if\ncomparability is central to modelling practice (O\u2019Malley &\nParke 2018), and if we recognize a range of model\nmedia\u2014including mental constructs\u2014then perhaps comparing\nabstract and idealized thought experiments with material models of\nunicellular life more often might be a fruitful philosophical\napproach. Now of course empirically inclined philosophers thinking\nabout cognition or the evolution of behavior might choose instead to\ncompare their mental models to models based on animals or plants. But\njust as Gause wanted the maximum reduction in extraneous complexity in\norder to compare basic mathematical structures with living population\nstructures, then so might philosophers who manipulate mental\nstructures want a stripped-down living model analogue. Whether or not\nphilosophers feel encouraged to carry out such comparisons is not the\nmain point of this section, however, which is primarily to note\nthat abstract modelling efforts with mathematics and algorithms (and\npotentially mental constructs) can effectively be compared with\nmicrobial model systems. Such comparability then raises a whole slew\nof additional questions for philosophical inquiry. One of the main\nquestions is about just how far such comparisons can be taken.\n4.2 Limits of microbial models?\n\nEven if philosophers concede that microbes might be good models for\nsome very basic biological processes (e.g., genetic pathways), they\nmight still believe that many phenomena of relevance to humans and\nother animals are too far from any microbial analogue. Because of\ninitially being defined by animal characteristics, phenomena such as\npredation, ageing, and kin recognition have often been thought to be\noutside the purview of microbes. However, it turns out that microbes\nare, in fact, productive objects of study for many of these\nphenomena.\n\nPredation, for example, is commonly thought of as a process that\ninvolves one animal killing and consuming another. Nibbling on plants\ncounts only as herbivory, and bacteria consuming other microbes used\nto be considered parasitic or perhaps even herbivorous, depending on\nwhether their \u201cprey\u201d photosynthesized (Guerrero et al.\n1986). Early discoveries of explicitly predatory behavior in bacteria\nannounced them as \u201cthe first parasitic organism that attacks\n[other] bacteria in a recognizably predatory fashion\u201d, despite\nbeing smaller than their prey (Stolp & Starr 1963: 242). Nowadays,\na large range of predatory behaviors are acknowledged in bacteria as\nmore is discovered about microbial diversity in behavior and feeding\nmode (P\u00e9rez et al. 2016). These discoveries have broadened the\ncategory of predation, and provide means by which to investigate the\ngeneral phenomenon of predation and its ecological impact. For many\nresearch purposes, bacterial predators and prey function as models for\nmore general relationships of this sort, and can even show the\nlimitations of current theory (e.g., Gause\u2019s experience with his\neukaryotic microbes).\n\nPhenomena such as ageing were also believed to apply only to\nmulticellular organisms. Bacteria and other unicellular life were\nthought of as ageless and \u201cimmortal\u201d, due to symmetrical\ncell division leading to new offspring replacing the progenitor cell\nand removing any opportunity for ageing (Nystr\u00f6m 2002). Because\nageing used to be defined as something that happened to organisms with\ndistinctions between germ and soma, it was assumed that\n\u201cunicellular bacteria are clearly not members of the exclusive\nclub of aging creatures\u201d (Nystr\u00f6m 2002: 596). However, a\nlarge body of research now investigates just how bacteria age, the\ndifferences between death and ageing, and what bacterial death means\nfor the very evolution of senescence (Baig et al. 2014). In other\nwords, bacterial ageing can model the core phenomena of what it means\nto grow old.\n\nLikewise, kin recognition was once defined on the basis of sensory\ncapacities that are not normally imputed to bacteria and other\nmicrobes (e.g., Hepper 1986). But kin recognition on the basis of\nchemical \u201csensing\u201d is now a well-known phenomenon in\nmicroorganisms, and has broadened what is known about the process in\ngeneral. In bacteria, recognition mechanisms are biochemical and have\nmolecular underpinnings, which means the process can be analyzed and broken down to its components relatively straightforwardly. In animals, inferences about recognition mechanisms are broader and less defined, due to\nthe behavioral level at which kin recognition must be investigated\n(Wall 2016). Protist kin recognition researchers argue that the\nphenomena, origins and evolution of kin recognition in eukaryotes is\nbest studied in diverse unicellular eukaryotic microbes (e.g.,\nPaz-y-Mi\u00f1o-C & Espinosa 2016). Nobody is saying that\nmicrobes directly represent the complex phenomena going on in\nanimals. Bacterial models of kin recognition in general are indirect\nand simplified representations of more complex processes of perception\nin other domains of life (Wall 2016). However, it is well established\nin philosophy that this sort of indirect representation is key to the\nvery practice of modelling (e.g., Weisberg 2013).\n\nSceptics might think there must surely be phenomena in complex\nanimals, such as humans, that resist such modelling. They might\nsuggest that cognitive activities are something that simply cannot be\nmodelled by microbes of any kind because there is no basic analogue\nwith which to work. But even for cognition, unicellular organisms have\nbeen extensively studied for decision optimization, efficiency\ncalculations, memory, anticipation and self-awareness (Westerhoff et\nal. 2014; Beekman & Latty 2015). Not only do these microbes\n(eukaryotic and prokaryotic) undergo direct examination for their own\ncognitive capacities, but they also stand in for the more complex and\nhard-to-access capacities of organisms such as animals. Again, the\nclaim here is not that microbes\u2019 cognitive capacities are the\nsame as those of animals. The claim is that microbes have capacities\nthat include key aspects of cognition, and these capacities can be\nstudied as analogues for cognition in general (including cognition in\nanimals). Just as for kin recognition, the quest to understand the\nunderlying foundations of cognition makes microorganisms such as slime\nmoulds and E. coli valuable models for cognitive capacities\nof a general kind that are not dependent on brains (Beekman &\nLatty 2015; Allen 2017). Whether this is best discussed as minimal\ncognition (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2016; see Lyon forthcoming for\ncriticism) or as another facet of a general capacity that is diversely\ndistributed across the tree of life (e.g., Allen 2017) is irrelevant\nhere: the point is simply that an examination of microbial research\ncan challenge, enrich and potentially reform how philosophers think\nabout classic subjects. Indeed, some new research in microbiology, which we turn to in Section 5, even\nclaims that microbes in the human body are influencing the mind.\n5. The Long Reach of Microbiome Research\n\nA recent microbiology topic of growing interest for philosophers is\nmicrobiome research, which examines all the microbial communities\nliving in host organisms. In humans, the gut microbiome in particular\nis associated with many health and disease states experienced by the\nhost, including mental health. There are two foci of philosophical\nattention given to these heterogeneous microbial consortia in host\nsystems, namely individuality (e.g., Skillings 2016) and causality,\nspecifically the causal role large mixed communities of microbes might\nplay in host health (Lynch et al. 2019). \n5.1 Individuality issues\n\nPerhaps the most basic philosophical issue that awareness of microbes\nleads to is that of individuality: individuating where one biological\nentity starts and another begins. Are microbes in and on human bodies\npart of those bodies or not? If they are deemed a part, in what way is\nthat parthood conceptualized? Rather than answering this question with\ntraditional tools of mereology (see\n SEP entry on mereology),\n philosophers of biology have focused on biological and evolutionary\ncriteria. In particular, the question of whether hosts and their\nmicrobes evolve as one Darwinian unit has become central to the\ndiscussion (e.g., Clarke 2013; Booth 2014; Godfrey-Smith 2015; Pradeu\n2016; Roughgarden et al. 2018). Criteria for evaluating when symbiotic\nbiological units have become a single evolutionary unit of selection\nare still disputed and promise considerably more philosophical\ndiscussion (see\n SEP entry on individuality).\n What is central to this entry is that such debates are rarely\ninspired by relationships between macroorganisms. The smallness and\nability of microbes to invade host bodies and even cells is what marks\nout microorganisms as the relevant focus of philosophical attention.\nTheir systemic effects on their environments is the other aspect that\nmakes them such important research foci. For example, microbes in the\nintestines are repeatedly linked to host brain states such as\nemotional well-being and depression (e.g., Valles-Colomer et al.\n2019).\n\nWe note, however, that the sheer excitement and novelty of unexpected\nfindings can also lead to exaggerated views of the relationship\nbetween human hosts and their microbes. Exactly how responsible\nmicrobiomes are for human experiences such as anxiety, depression,\nlearning and memory is uncertain and at least sometimes dubious (for\ndiscussion see Hooks et al. 2019). A similarly inflated claim is that\nknowledge of microbiomes necessitates a new view of self, or of what\nit means to be human (e.g., Rees et al. 2018; Ironstone 2018). While\ndozens of microbiome authors have made claims to this effect, with\nsome attempting to explain what it actually means for the microbiome\nto challenge or change our sense of self (e.g., Rees et al. 2018),\nthis claim still needs a great deal of clarification and substantiation (Parke et al. 2018). A\nvast range of things could be meant by \u201cself\u201d or\n\u201cwhat it means to be human\u201d in the context of these\nmicrobiome claims, ranging from something controversial about the\nnature of human biological individuality (see discussion above), to\nsomething factual about the composition of human bodies (i.e., people\nused to think their bodies were made of only human cells but now know\nthey are made of microbial cells as well), to something\nphenomenological about first-person human experience (to date, there\nis no evidence that microbes influence this). So, these claims about\nthe influence of microbiomes on \u201cwho we are\u201d are at best\nspeculative and exaggerated. Some of these conceptual problems\nprobably come about because of unclarity about how to investigate the\ncausal powers of microbiomes, and more generally about causal\nexplanation in microbiome research.\n5.2 Causality issues\n\nAlthough philosophers drawing on microbiome research have tended so\nfar to focus on metaphysical issues of individuality, issues\nassociated with microbiome explanations are probably more pressing for the\nscience and are now undergoing philosophical scrutiny. These\ninvestigations can work in two directions: using philosophical\nframeworks to explore the nature of microbiome causality or even\nwhether it occurs (e.g., Lynch et al. 2019), then using the insights\ngained to reflect further on the philosophy of causal explanation. For\nexample, Gillies (2019) examines treatment regimes arising out of\nmicrobiome research and proposes a \u201ccausal law\u201d account of\nexplanation to account for such phenomena. Other approaches take\nframeworks for causal explanation such as interventionism (see\n SEP entry on causation and manipulability)\n and propose refinements that arise from examinations of putative\nmicrobiome causality (Attah et al. 2020; Oftedal 2020). A particularly\nstrong finding of such analyses is that tradeoffs between key\ndimensions of causal explanation (stability, specificity,\nproportionality) require further philosophical attention.\n\nObviously, microbiome research is only one aspect of microbiology, but\nit illustrates nicely the general point of the philosophical richness\nof microbiological science. The occupation of humans by trillions of\nmicrobes means that traditional views of health, bodies, and even\nminds (according to some emerging research) need supplementing by\nmicrobial and microbiological perspectives. Because some of this new\nknowledge has only recently been revealed by large-scale molecular\ntechniques, many of the strongest and most \u201crevolutionary\u201d\nclaims require more rigorous conceptualization and analysis. But this\nis not exclusively a feature of microbe-associated science. Nor is the\noccupation of human bodies unique to microbes: helminths (worms) are\nhistorical human passengers, and are frequently argued to have\nsystem-wide benefits for their hosts that outweigh any harms (e.g.,\nLuke\u0161 et al. 2015). Nevertheless, we do not expect to see\nanytime soon a SEP entry on helminths. To clarify why, this essay will\nconclude by reiterating the several angles from which microbes and\nmicrobiology can be considered philosophically valuable.\n6. Why Microbes and Microbiology Warrant Philosophical Attention\n\nPhilosophy of microbes and microbiology goes beyond both its\norganismal and scientific bases. As discussed above, whether microbes\nare used as models or as sources of data about biogeochemistry, their\nimplications go much further. They constitute many of the material\naspects of human lives, from individual bodies to every process in the\nbiosphere. Although there are many ways in which general lessons are\ntaken from large organisms, broad swathes of biology depend on\nmicrobes in numerous ways, and this influences how researchers\nunderstand and theorize about organisms such as humans. For\nphilosophers of biology interested primarily in human or other animal\nbiology, there will always be some sort of philosophical payoff if\nmicrobiological angles are included.  Philosophers of science more\ngenerally may find that understanding models or experimentation\ncarried out with living systems can be enhanced by attention to\nmicrobial modelling practices.\n\nEven for philosophers who are not philosophers of science,\nmicrobiology can be brought to bear on issues such as identity,\nselfhood, human nature, and mind, to generate broader insights and\nsurprising conclusions. Not all such conclusions are defensible, but\nexamining the ways in which microbes might contribute to humanness\ncould be a valuable exercise. Consider why, for example, trillions of\nmicrobes living inside human bodies seem more easily regarded as part\nof that body, whereas the handful of helminths that do likewise are\nusually (but not always) distinguished as separate and ideally\nevicted. Microbes also offer philosophers tractable ways to study big\nquestions about the nature of life, causation, and representation in\ngeneral. For example, microbial experimental systems may be\nseen as material equivalents of the mental structures philosophers\nmanipulate in thought experiments. There is also something to\nlearn about the ways microbial and other modelling activities differ.",
