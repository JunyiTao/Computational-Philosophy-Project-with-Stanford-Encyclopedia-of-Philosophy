    "main_text": "What Is Drift, and Can It Be Distinguished from Natural Selection? || Mathematical Approaches to Drift\n2.3 Mathematical Approaches to Drift\n\nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) provide a good entr\u00e9e into\nunderstanding a mathematical approach to drift. They begin by\nacknowledging the historical uses of the term drift, identifying four:\n1) a \u201cSewall Wright Effect\u201d, 2) a \u201cHagedoorn\nEffect\u201d, 3) \u201cIndiscriminate Sampling\u201d, and 4)\n\u201cThe Finiteness of Natural Populations\u201d (with some of\ntheir characterizations not fully accurate; e.g., with the first, they\nconflate Sewall Wright\u2019s Shifting Balance Model where drift\nplays a role with drift itself). They suggest that these phenomena are\n\u201cdisparate\u201d although they acknowledge, citing Beatty\n(1984), that the first three can be understood in terms of sampling.\nBut the fourth form, they assert, cannot. They describe the fourth\nphenomenon as follows:\n\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg Law says that in infinite populations (of diploid\norganisms) there is no change in gene frequencies when there is no\nvariation in gene fitnesses. But natural populations are finite in\nsize; often they are small. In finite populations there will always be\nsome non-negligible chance that trait frequencies will diverge from\nexpectation. (Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002: 456)\n\n\nWith respect to this understanding of drift as the Hardy-Weinberg Law\nconjoined with a finite population, Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew maintain\nthat \u201cthere is no larger population literally being\nsampled\u201d (2002: 459). Instead:\n\n\n\u2026in these cases what happens is that the distribution of\nfitnesses in the population yields a prediction concerning the way in\nwhich a population will change. Drift is manifested as a difference\nfrom the outcome predicted by the fitnesses in the population. The law\nof large numbers tells us that the likelihood of significant\ndivergence from these predictions is an inverse function of the size\nof the population. The small size of a population increases the\nchances of error. (Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002: 459)\n\n\nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew then state that this is the common feature\nthat the four types of drift they outline all share; thus drift, on\ntheir view, is when a series of births, survivals, deaths, and\nreproductions diverges from the outcome predicted by differences in\nfitness. Note that, using the terminology introduced in the previous\nsection, this is a purely outcome-oriented\n(\u201coutcome-only\u201d) definition of drift. Whatever type of\nprocess (if any) might have produced the outcome plays no role in the\ndefinition. Matthen (2010) defends a similar characterization of\ndrift: \u201cDepartures from expected values are what population\ngeneticists call \u2018drift\u2019\u201d (Matthen 2010: 3).\n\nHowever, notice that the fourth drift \u201cphenomenon\u201d that\nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew identify isn\u2019t really a phenomenon.\nRather, it refers to a model from population genetics, the\nHardy-Weinberg model, and predictions based on that model. It is true\nthat as a consequence of the model, there would be no deviation from\nfitness expectations with an idealized infinite population (if we make\nsome philosophical assumptions about what happens in infinity; Sober\n(1984) raises questions about these assumptions), but that there would\nlikely be such deviations with a finite population. But this is a\npurely mathematical approach. The purely mathematical approach\ndoesn\u2019t ask what phenomena the model is supposed to be modeling\nand why it is that finite populations are of interest. There is also\nno explanation of why a Hardy-Weinberg model with an assumption of\nfinite population size should count as drift; perhaps this is because\nof a philosophical tradition of referring to this as drift (e.g., some\nparts of Sober 1984 read that way), or perhaps it is because of the\npreviously-noted longstanding association between drift and small\npopulation sizes. In contrast, on the Causal Process Account of Drift,\ndrift would occur even in infinite populations as long as there is\nindiscriminate sampling; drift-like outcomes (deviation from fitness\nexpectations) are not required.\n\nMillstein, Skipper, and Dietrich (2009) challenge the outcome-only\napproach to defining drift and the purely mathematical approach that\nit is based on. Thus, there seem to be some meta-disagreements between\nthe process-only and outcome-only approaches to drift; should our\ndefinitions of drift look to the history of biology or should they\nlook to mathematics? Should we glean our understandings of drift from\nthe phenomena that biologists have sought to understand (the phenomena\nthat they developed models for) or from the models alone? If from the\nmodels alone, are we inadvertently drawing on the measure or\noperationalization of drift rather than drift itself (Plutynski 2007)?\nDiffering answers to these questions seem to be at the heart of the\ndiffering definitions of drift.\n\nIf one doesn\u2019t interpret the model purely mathematically, but\ninstead considers what phenomenon the Hardy-Weinberg Principle\nwith-finite-populations is seeking to model, then there is indeed a\nlarger population being sampled. The equation models the changes from\none generation to the next; the original generation is the population\nthat is being sampled, and the next generation is the\n\u201csample\u201d. That sample may or may not be representative of\nthe original population, e.g., a heterozygote Aa of the\noriginal generation may or may not have offspring in the proportions\n25% AA, 50% Aa, and 25% aa.\n\nThe mathematical-oriented outcome-only definition of drift is often\nassociated with the so-called \u201cstatisticalist\u201d approach to\nevolutionary theory, but since it is simply a definition of drift and\nnot a metaphysical thesis it need not be. For example, a\nnon-statisticalist could consistently hold that natural selection is\ncausal (and thus, evolution would not be purely statistical, as it is\non the statisticalist interpretation), but that drift occurs when and\nonly when there is a deviation of the actual outcome from fitness\nexpectation. Indeed, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouchard and Alexander\nRosenberg (2004) seem to hold such a view. The intersection between\nissues of drift and the debates over statisticalism will be discussed\nfurther below.\n",
