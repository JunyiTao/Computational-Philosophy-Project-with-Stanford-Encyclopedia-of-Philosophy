    "main_text": "Discovery: From A-ha Moments to Discovery Strategies || Mechanistic Evidence in Medical Discoveries\n6.3 Mechanistic Evidence in Medical Discoveries\nDiscovery in medicine is another domain where the mechanical\nphilosophy has been applied. Thagard draws on the case of H.\npylori as a cause of ulcers to provide an account of how\ninvestigating mechanisms contributes to scientific discovery.\nThagard draws attention to both statistical evidence that suggests\nulcers are somehow associated with H. pylori, as well as\nmechanistic evidence that can explain how the agent of infection could\npersist in a hostile environment long enough to cause an ulcer. More\nrecently, philosophers interested in evidence-based medicine have\nprobed the relationship between these two types of evidence in the\nhealth sciences. Russo and Williamson argue that both types of\nevidence are necessary to justify causal inference; the correlational\nevidence establishes that there is a difference-making relation\nbetween some cause and some effect, while the mechanistic evidence\nestablishes how exactly the cause produces its effect\u2014the\n\u201cRusso-Williamson Thesis\u201d (Russo and Williamson\n2007). Philosophers have since refined the Russo-Williamson Thesis,\npointing out, for instance, that \u201ctype of evidence\u201d could\nrefer to different methodologies for gathering evidence or to\ndifferent objects of evidence.  Difference-making methodologies\ninclude observational studies and randomized controlled trials, while\nmechanistic methodologies include interventionist experiments such as\nthose described above; likewise, the object of evidence could be the\nevidence of an associated difference or it could be the evidence\nconcerning the mechanism linking the cause and effect (Illari 2011;\nsee also Campaner 2011).  Evidence-based medicine hierarchies, which\nrank different kinds of evidence in terms of its epistemic strength,\ntend to prioritize evidence from difference-making methodologies (such\nas randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) over mechanistic\nevidence; in reply, these philosophers argue that the different types\nof evidence are on a par (each with its own strengths and weaknesses)\nand advocate for integrating difference-making and mechanistic\nevidence, a sentiment which aligns with the emphasis on mechanism\nintegration discussed in Section 5.2 above\n(Clarke et al. 2013, 2014). \n",
