    "main_text": "Riemannian geometry || Riemann's generalisation\n5.1 Riemann's generalisation\n\nRiemann\u2019s ideas were both profound and na\u00efve, and for that\nreason they proved difficult to make precise, but we can content\nourselves with being na\u00efve initially. He supposed he was given a\nspace (he called it a \u2018manifold\u2019) in which one can at any\npoint impose a coordinate system at least on all points near to an\narbitrary initial point, and if \\(n\\) numbers are needed to specify\nthe location of a point he said that the space is \\(n\\)-dimensional.\nWe can think of this process as providing a map of at least that part\nof the space near the initial point onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Riemann was\nvery aware of the difference between local and global determinations,\nand this became one of the keys to his new ideas: the same local\nconditions are compatible with numerous different global\nconfigurations.\n\nHe then supposed there was a means of saying what the distance was\ninfinitesimally, by generalising the formula for \\(ds\\) from 2 to\n\\(n\\) variables. (He even allowed that entirely different formulae be\nused, but we shall not describe that part of his theory, which lay\nfallow for many years). Next, he generalized the intrinsic property of\ncurvature to higher dimensions; essentially, the \\(n\\)-dimensional\nobject has lots of 2-dimensional surfaces to which the Gaussian theory\napplies, so a notion of curvature of a \\(n\\)-dimensional object at a\npoint can be derived from a consideration of the 2-dimensional\nsurfaces that pass through the point.\n\nThere are properties of the space that are independent of the\ncoordinate system. If two different coordinate systems give out\ndifferent coordinates, but in such a way that the distance between the\npoints is preserved, then either system gives us the same geometry,\nand we find that the two agree on the curvatures at each point, on\ndistances, and so forth. Yet the framework of differential geometry\nproposed by Riemann is very flexible and general. He found that it\nallowed not only for alternatives to Euclidean geometry, but even for\ngeometries where the generalized curvature does change from point to\npoint. Initially this was scarcely taken up, and most authors focused\non geometries of constant curvature. As Riemann explained, his\nframework allowed for geometries of negative curvature (this is the\nLobachevskii-Bolyai case), of positive curvature (a new kind, often\ncalled elliptic geometry, or \u2018Riemannian\u2019 in a narrow\nsense), and also of zero curvature (Euclidean).\n\nBecause the formula for \\(ds\\) was written down subject to only a\nfew restrictions, there is no reason to believe that a Riemannian\ngeometry is defined with respect to an antecedent Euclidean geometry.\nThere is no claim that an \\(n\\)-dimensional Riemannian geometry is to\nbe obtained by a map from an \\(n\\)-dimensional subset of some\nEuclidean \\(m\\)-dimensional space. This means that geometry\ncan be done without reference to any Euclidean geometry. Euclidean\ngeometry is no longer epistemologically prior to any study of other\ngeometries. The reign of Euclid\nwas\u2014theoretically\u2014over.\n\nGiven a concept of distance on a manifold it is possible to talk about\ngeodesics\u2014a geodesic being a curve of shortest length between\ntwo points. Existence and uniqueness questions can be raised, and\noften answered. A significant advance was made independently by Tullio\nLevi-Civita in 1917 and Hermann Weyl in 1918, inspired by\nEinstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, when they showed how to\ndefine parallelism on a curved manifold (on Levi-Civita\u2019s\ncontribution, see Bottazzini 1999 and on Weyl\u2019s contribution see\nScholz 2001). Roughly speaking, in Weyl\u2019s presentation (1918),\ntwo vectors at different points are parallel if they belong to a\nfamily of vectors along a curve that do not vary along the curve. This\nbecame referred to as a way of establishing a connection between\ndifferent points, and the theory was called the theory of connections\non manifolds. One can ask if a family of tangent vectors to a curve is\ncomposed of vectors parallel to the tangent vector at the starting\npoint: if so, the curve is a natural candidate to be considered the\nstraightest curve between its end points, because the tangent vector\nnever accelerates along the curve. In modern differential geometry,\ngeodesics are defined via connections.\n",
