    "main_text": "Simplicity, Stable Belief, and Ockham\u2019s Razor || Examples\n5.2 Examples\n\nIn the Riddle of Induction, the verifiable hypotheses are the grue\nhypotheses with critical time t: any sequence of t green emeralds\nfollowed by blue ones entails the corresponding grue(t)\ngeneralization. Thus the grue hypotheses receive simplicity rank 0.\nAfter the grue hypotheses are eliminated, the only remaining\nhypothesis is \u201call emeralds are green\u201d. Given that it is\nthe only possibility in the restricted hypothesis space, \u201call\nemeralds are green\u201d is entailed by any sequence of green\nemeralds. Therefore \u201call emeralds are green\u201d has\nsimplicity rank 1. After removing the all green hypothesis, no\nhypotheses remain. \nIn the raven color problem, the verifiable hypothesis is \u201ca\nnonblack raven will be observed\u201d, which receives simplicity rank\n0. After removing the hypothesis that a nonblack raven will be\nobserved, the only remaining possibility is that only black ravens\nwill be observed, hence this hypothesis is verifiable in the\nrestricted hypothesis space and receives simplicity rank 1. \nThe simplicity rank of a causal graph is given by the number of direct\nlinks not contained in the graph. Therefore the fewer direct\nlinks are posited by the causal model, the higher its simplicity\nrank. \nThe simplicity rank of a set of conservation laws is given by the\nnumber of independent laws. (Independence in the sense of linear\nalgebra.) Therefore the more nonredundant laws are introduced by a\ntheory, the higher its simplicity rank. Each law rules out some\nreactions, so maximizing the number of independent laws given the\nobserved reactions is equivalent to ruling out as many unobserved\nreactions as possible. \n\n",
