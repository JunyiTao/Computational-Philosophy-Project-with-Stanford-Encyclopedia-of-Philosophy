    "main_text": "John Duns Scotus and the Role of Concepts\n7. John Duns Scotus and the Role of Concepts\n\nOne of the issues that Aquinas touched on but did not settle was that\nof the number of rationes an analogical term was associated\nwith. This issue stems\u00a0from Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories. As translated by Boethius, Aristotle introduced\nthe distinction between univocal and equivocal terms by claiming that\nwhereas univocal terms were subordinated to one substantiae\nratio, equivocal terms were subordinated to more than one\nsubstantiae ratio. The word \u2018ratio\u2019 here\nis capable of various interpretations, including \u2018definition or\ndescription\u2019, \u2018analysis\u2019, or \u2018concept\u2019,\nbut by the early fourteenth century logicians and theologians came to\nagree that the appropriate interpretation was \u2018concept\u2019.\nThe second threefold division of analogy given above suggests the\nimportance of a focus on concepts; and the question of how many\nconcepts an analogical term was subordinated to came to be central.\nThe nominalists held that so-called analogical terms were either\nmetaphorical or were straightforwardly equivocal terms subordinated to\ntwo distinct concepts, but the Thomists were split. Analogical terms\ncould be viewed as subordinated to an ordered cluster of concepts\n(possibly but not necessarily described as a disjunction of concepts);\nor they could be subordinated to a single concept which represents in\na prior and a posterior manner (per prius et posterius).\n\nThe issue was considerably complicated by the influence of John Duns\nScotus. In his early logical commentaries, Scotus had argued that it\nwas impossible to have two concepts that were related in a prior and\nposterior way, just as it was impossible to have a single concept that\ncaptured such a relationship. As a result, \u2018being\u2019 was a\nchance equivocal, and metaphor, which was a matter of linguistic\nusage, replaced semantic analogy. However, Scotus did believe in\nmetaphysical analogy, whereby God and creatures, substances and\naccidents were related in a prior and posterior way, and in his later\ntheological works he argued that without a unified concept of being\nneither metaphysics nor theology would be possible. Accordingly, he\nreplaced the claim that \u2018being\u2019 was a chance equivocal\nwith the claim that it was univocal. In order to support this claim,\nhe rejected the common doctrine that for a term to be univocal it had\nto be a strictly categorial term, picking out some natural kind or\nother. He argued that it was sufficient for univocity that\ncontradiction would arise when the term was affirmed and denied of the\nsame thing. He then argued that \u2018being\u2019 (ens) was\na univocal term subordinated to a single univocal concept.\n\nWhat one should make of the relationship between\u00a0the single\nunivocal concept of being and the being common to finite and infinite\nbeing (as substance and accidents) has proved to be a dividing point\nfor the Scotist tradition. Dumont has described how even the earliest\nfollowers of Duns Scotus struggled to bring together the seemingly\ncompeting claims of Scotus himself that, on the one hand, (a) there is\none univocal concept of being that is common to God and creatures,\nand, on the other hand,\u00a0(b) God and creatures are entirely\ndiverse realities with no real commonality. Different Scotists have\nemphasized one point or the other, with some Scotists taking the\nposition that there is a real community in being between God and\ncreatures in order to preserve the unity of the univocal concept of\nbeing, and other Scotists taking the position that the univocal\nconcept of being is purely logical in order to preserve the real\ndiversity between God and creatures. In developing these positions,\nScotists distinguish between different orders or kinds of univocity\nand analogy, including between logical and metaphysical univocity and\nlogical and metaphysical analogy. In the seventeenth century, the great\nScotist philosopher Bartolmaeus Mastrius proposed that, in reality,\nbeing is analogous to God and creatures, but analogy is not a medium\nbetween equivocation and univocation. Instead, every analogy reduces\nlogically to equivocation or to univocation. In the case of being as\ncommon to God and creatures, the analogy reduces to univocation. In\nrecent scholarship, Cross has defended a similar interpretation of\nScotus\u2019s doctrine, affirming that the semantics of analogy reduce to\nor depend upon a more fundamental core of univocity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEven for those within the Thomistic tradition, Scotus\u2019 arguments\nabout the univocity of \u2018being\u2019 had to be taken seriously.\nOn the one hand, the word does not seem to be straightforwardly\nequivocal, in the sense of being subordinated to more than one\nconcept, for we at least have the illusion of being able to grasp\n\u2018being\u2019 as a general term. As Scotus pointed out, in an\nargument reproduced by all who considered the issue (dubbed \u201cthe\nfamous argument from a certain and a doubtful concept\u201d by the early\nScotist Peter Thomae), we can grasp that something is a being while\ndoubting whether it is a substance or an accident, and this surely\ninvolves having a relatively simple concept of being at our disposal.\nOn the other hand, there does not seem to be any common nature\ninvolved, and in the absence of a common nature, Thomists thought that\nto call the term \u2018univocal\u2019 was inappropriate. What was\nneeded was a way of allowing the concept to enjoy some kind of unity,\nwhile allowing the word to have a significate that was not a simple\ncommon nature. For many thinkers from the early fourteenth century\nonward, the distinction between formal and objective concepts provided\nthe answer.\n\nThe formal concept was the act of mind or conception that represented\nan object, and the objective concept was the object represented. A\nformal concept is a sign or signifier, and an objective concept is\nwhat is signified.\u00a0If the spoken word \u2018being\u2019\ncorresponds to just one formal concept (a point on which there were\nsome differences of opinion), the focus of discussion shifts to the\nstatus of the objective concept. Is it the actual thing in the world\nwhich is thought about; is it a common nature or some other kind of\nintermediary entity which is distinct from the external object without\nbeing mind-dependent; or is it a special kind of mind-dependent object\nwhich has only objective being, the being of being thought (esse\nobjective, esse cognitum)? In the case of \u2018being\u2019,\nsince we are clearly not talking about either an individual thing or a\ncommon nature, we get back to the original set of questions about\nanalogical concepts, now posed at a different level. That is, are we\ntalking about a special ordering intrinsic to a single objective\nconcept, or are we talking about an ordered sequence of objective\nconcepts which corresponds to the one formal concept?\n",
