    "main_text": "What is Blame? || Cognitive Theories of Blame\n1.1 Cognitive Theories of Blame\n\nCognitive theories of blame hold that blame is fundamentally a\njudgment or evaluation that we make about an agent in light of their\nactions, attitudes, or character. One of the earliest cognitive theories of blame\nis due to J. J. C. Smart (1961), who develops his analysis of blame\nindirectly, since he begins by distinguishing between praise and\ndispraise (rather than with the more natural distinction\nbetween praise and blame). According to Smart, to praise or dispraise\nan individual is simply to grade them as a member of a\nparticular kind. And as Smart says, this sort of grading is no\ndifferent than the sort of grading involved in judging one apple to be\nbetter than the others at the supermarket. Crucially, Smart notes\nthat though you might dispraise a young philosopher for their poor\nwriting in a letter of recommendation, you are not thereby blaming\nthem for it. Thus for Smart, blame is distinct from dispraise. Unlike\ndispraise, blame involves more than merely grading someone\u2019s actions\nor character (morally), since blame carries with it the implication\nthat the person is responsible for their action or character. Blame,\nthen, is a negative evaluative judgment that implies\nresponsibility.\n\nIn a similar vein, Gary Watson (1996) has suggested that there is an\nevaluative form of blame connected with what he calls the\n\u201caretaic perspective\u201d. To blame someone in this way is to\njudge that they have failed with respect to some standard of\nexcellence (aret\u00e9). It is also to insist that the agent is\nresponsible for their action in the sense that the action is\nattributable to the agent\u2014it represents their\nevaluative standpoint, their practical identity, what they\n\u201cstand for\u201d (Watson 1996). Like Smart, Watson recognizes\nthat it is possible to make such a judgment dispassionately. Thus, on\nthe grading and evaluative theories of blame developed by Smart and\nWatson, there is nothing about blame that requires a blamer to be\nemotionally exercised in any way. However, unlike Smart\u2014who\nidentifies blame with a form of grading that implies moral\nresponsibility\u2014Watson does not take aretaic blame to be a\ngeneral analysis of blame. Rather, for Watson, aretaic blame\nis just one way among many that we blame others for their actions.\n\n\nEven though many have resisted thinking of blame as a form of grading,\na number of contemporary accounts of blame retain the core idea in\nSmart\u2019s (and Watson\u2019s) account that blame is a kind of evaluative\njudgment. But what sort of evaluative judgment will do? Many theorists\nhave identified blame with judgments that essentially implicate how\nthe blamed agent\u2019s moral or practical self was involved in the\nproduction of action. This allows cognitive theories to explain the\nspecial force of blame. After all, as T.M. Scanlon puts it,\n\u201cgiven that most people care about\u201d their moral selves\n(and others\u2019 opinions about their moral selves), judgments that\nimplicate these aspects of a person are not \u201cmere\ndescriptions\u201d (Scanlon 1986: 170). Michael Zimmerman (1988) and\nIshtiyaque Haji (1998) make this point more vividly when they argue\nthat to blame someone is to judge that in virtue of their attitudes,\nactions, or character, they have a stain on their moral self\nor a mark against their moral ledger. As Zimmerman puts it, when we\nblame someone, we judge\n\n\nthat there is a \u201cdiscredit\u201d or \u201cdebit\u201d in his\nledger \u2026 that his \u201cmoral standing\u201d has been\n\u201cdiminished\u201d (Zimmerman 1988: 38).\n\n\nOne need not endorse the idea of an actual moral ledger in\norder to hold a cognitive theory of blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2004),\nfor example, articulates a cognitive account of blame, where the\njudgment in question is a judgment that the blamed agent has shown the blamer (or\nanother) ill will. Since we care deeply about other people\u2019s judgments\nabout the quality of our wills, this judgment can also carry the\ndistinctive force of blame.\n\nDespite a number of supporters, there are many who are less sanguine\nabout the prospects of a purely cognitive account of blame. One\npotential problem for cognitive accounts is that they risk conflating\nblaming with judging blameworthy (Kenner 1967;\nCoates and Tognazzini 2012). After all, it seems quite possible to\njudge, for example, that another has displayed ill will or that they\nhave a mark against their moral ledger (and so, judge that they are\nblameworthy), without actually blaming that individual. The\nco-conspirator\u2019s recognition of the wrongness of a partner\u2019s criminal\nactivity might, in fact, underlie admiration for the partner\u2019s\nskillful execution of a heinous crime that most of us couldn\u2019t\nstomach. The fact that the same judgment could elicit such different\nresponses (repulsion and resentment in those of us who are committed\nto the values of morality and admiration in those who are not)\nsuggests that the judgment alone cannot constitute blame. More\nrecently, Hanna Pickard (2013) has argued that since it is possible to knowingly\nblame others inappropriately (i.e., to blame others even when we know\nthat they are not really blameworthy for their actions), the judgment\nthat another is blameworthy, or that they have shown ill will or\ndisregard, is not necessary for blame. It looks, then, that judgments\nof the sort discussed above are neither necessary nor sufficient for\nblame.\n\nA further problem for cognitive accounts is one suggested by Gary\nWatson (1987). According to Watson, attempts to identify or reduce\nblame exclusively to its cognitive components (recall that\nalthough Watson thinks that aretaic blame takes the form of judgments,\nit does not exhaust the phenomenon of blaming) make it seem \n\n\nas though in blaming we were mainly moral clerks, recording moral\nfaults \u2026 from a detached and austerely \u201cobjective\u201d\nstandpoint (1987 as reprinted in Watson 2004: 226\u201327).\n\n\nHere Watson argues that blame issues from the perspective of a participant in human\nrelationships, one in which we are not merely observing the moral\norder but are actively involved in a moral community. These sorts of\nconsiderations form the basis for emotional theories of blame. \n",
