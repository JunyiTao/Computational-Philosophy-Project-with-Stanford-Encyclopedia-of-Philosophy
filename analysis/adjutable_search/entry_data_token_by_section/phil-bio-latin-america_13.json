    "main_text": "Philosophy and History of Biology || Synchronic Philosophical Analyses\n5.1 Synchronic Philosophical Analyses\n\nWithin synchronic philosophical analyses, equally linked to the\nhistory of science for the reasons given above, we can refer to those\nalready mentioned in\n Section 4,\n where, from different conceptions of scientific theories, distinct\nbiological theories were analyzed at different moments of their\nhistorical development. For instance, the theory of evolution by\nnatural selection in Darwin\u2019s time, by using a Lakatosian (Palma\n& Wolovelsky 1997) or a structuralist analysis (Ginnobili 2010;\nGinnobili & Blanco 2019); or for an analysis of the same theory at\nthe time of the \u201csynthesis\u201d (Klimovsky 1994), or at a\nlater time (Mahner & Bunge 1997) by using the classical view of\ntheories. On the other hand, given the relations between synchrony and\ndiachrony, some of the works mentioned in Section 4 provide a natural\nbasis for the diachronic analyses referred to in the next section.\n\nIn addition, some of the works mentioned in\n Section 4\n made it possible to address specific problems raised by historians\nabout the theories analyzed. For example, historians of biology have\nwondered to what extent Darwin and Wallace proposed the same theory or\nwhether Mendel, with his work, mainly tried to solve the problem of\nheredity, introducing the basic concepts of genetics and the laws that\nbear his name. With their synchronic philosophical analysis of the\ntheory of evolution by natural selection, Ginnobili & Blanco\n(2019) show that Darwin\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s theories coincide\nin many ways. However, Darwin\u2019s proposal should be considered\nmore general, encompassing, and unifying than Wallace\u2019s, such\nthat Wallace\u2019s would constitute a part, more precisely a\nspecialization in the sense of metatheoretical structuralism,\nof Darwin\u2019s theory. In contrast, synchronic philosophical\nanalyses of Mendel\u2019s work (Casanueva 1997, 2002; P. Lorenzano\n2022) show the difficulty in stating that Mendel proposed a theory of\nheredity in identical terms to what is usually presented under the\nlabel of classical or even Mendelian genetics.\n",
