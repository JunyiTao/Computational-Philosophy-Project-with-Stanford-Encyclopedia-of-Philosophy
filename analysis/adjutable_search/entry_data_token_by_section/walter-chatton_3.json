    "main_text": "The Anti-Razor || The Chatton Principle\n3.2 The Chatton Principle\n\nBut as it is usually understood today, this is not a principle that\nOckham believed in or defended; neither is it specific enough of a\nprinciple of ontological commitment to attach seriously and\nexclusively to one philosopher. Ockham\u2019s actual theory of\nontological commitment was something like this:\n\nNo extra-mental distinction among extra-mental things (res)\nshould be assumed unless it can be proved (a) by arguments from\nself-evident premises, or premises of indubitable experience or, (b)\nby unquestionable experience of extra-mental things, or (c) by some\ninfallible authority such as the Bible, the Saints, or certain\nEcclesiastical pronouncements.\n\n\nSince it gives negative advice, telling us when not to make a\ndistinction among things, it is reductive in orientation, and we might\ncall it one example of a principle of parsimony. Ockham\ncoupled this attitude to a complex and original theory of how\nsentences get to be true. When coupled these two theories yielded\ninteresting arguments which reject the existence of motion, and of\nmost relations.\n\nChatton seemed to think that relying on this standard would yield bad\nresults in certain cases; in particular he thought that despite\nOckham\u2019s insistence to the contrary, certain semantic arguments\ncould be adduced to establish the existence of a restricted class of\nrelations. He developed his attack on Ockham and supported his own\nontological commitment to real relations with a counter-razor he\ncalled propositio mea = \u2018my proposition\u2019 and an\nars respondendi = \u2018a method of responding\u2019, and\nalso simply regula mea = \u2018my rule\u2019. I shall call\nit the \u2018Chatton Principle\u2019, to contrast with\n\u2018Ockham\u2019s Razor\u2019.\n\nHere is an early general formulation of the Chatton Principle from\nReportatio I, d. 30, q. 1, a. 4:\n\nConsider an affirmative proposition, which, when it is verified,\nis verified only for things; if three things do not suffice for\nverifying it, one has to posit a fourth, and so on in turn [for four\nthings, or five, etc.]. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, paragraph\n57, p. 237)\n\n\nHe states different versions of the Principle in other places, but\nthroughout his career the basic idea is always the same: we must admit\nthat there are as many things as are required to make a certain\nproposition true.\n\nLater on, due to the Principle\u2019s increasing importance to him,\nand to Ockham\u2019s direct criticisms of it (some of which are\nrecorded, for example in his Quodlibeta Septem I, 5), Chatton\ndeveloped a long defense for the Principle and a richer formulation of\nit. The richest formulation of the Principle we have is from\nLectura I, d. 3, q. 1, a. 1:\n\nWhenever an affirmative proposition is apt to be verified for\nactually existing things, if two things, howsoever they are present\naccording to arrangement and duration, cannot suffice for the\nverification of the proposition while another thing is lacking, then\none must posit that other thing. (Lectura I, d. 3, q. 1, a.\n1, paragraph 4, p. 2)\n\n\nSimilar versions occur in his Collatio et\n Prologus.[6]\n\nBy itself, this principle is trivial, of course, since anyone would\nagree that we should posit as many entities as we need. But there is\nmore to the theory than this. Chatton explicitly breaks his Principle\ninto two parts for purposes of justification and for application as\nwell. His full theory can be thought of as a two-stage meditation on\nontology. Stage one is given in version (2) above. To summarize stage\none, we could say that language can serve as a guide to ontology in a\ncertain way; setting aside the passage of time and the occurrence of\nmotion \u2013 think of an \u2018ontological snapshot\u2019, if you\nlike \u2013 and given a true proposition \\(p\\), we can investigate\nsystematically the question of what kinds of things (what kind of\nontological snapshot) are necessary to make \\(p\\) true, and hence we\ncan conclude from \\(p\\)\u2019s truth that those kinds things must\nexist. The question at stake here is truth-makers. What this\nfirst part of the Chatton Principle says is (1) that the truth-makers\nof propositions are things (res), and (2) that, under certain\nconditions, propositions are a guide to ontology.\n\nAs noted, this is all well and good as far as it goes; we must posit\nas many things in reality as are sufficient to make the proposition\ntrue, when it is true. But all by itself this simply begs the question\nof sufficiency. Chatton sees this and so claims therefore that the\nChatton Principle involves a second stage:\n\nHence it is required to posit a second proposition \u2026 and it\nis this: those things are not sufficient to account for the fact that\na proposition is true with which it is consistent that, in whatever\nway they are present according to arrangement and duration without a\nnew thing, the proposition would be false. (Lectura I, d. 3,\nq. 1, a. 1, paragraph 17, p. 7)\n\n\nHere Chatton gives us a test for when a certain number of entities is\ninsufficient to make a true sentence true. His test is phrased in\nterms of the consistency of the falsehood of the proposition and the\nexistence of certain things without another. By studying other texts\nwe are able to see that Chatton has in mind a kind of a\npriori version of Mill\u2019s methods. We are to imagine, within\nthe absolute power of God, whether the causal powers attributed to the\nkinds of entities in a given ontological snapshot would be sufficient\nto make the proposition in question turn out true. If they are not, we\nthen imagine other entities coming into being, adding each to the\nontological snapshot one at a time, checking to see after each\naddition whether the proposition would at that point have to be true.\nSo long as the insufficiency remains, we add another object to the\npicture. We check that the insufficiency remains via\nconsistency: so long as there remains no manifest\ncontradiction between the existence of the currently considered\nsnapshot and the falsehood of the proposition, the insufficiency\nremains, and we must continue to posit more things. Given this method,\nit would seem to follow that, for any set of entities, if the causal\npowers of those entities are found wanting on the basis of consistency\nand yet the proposition in question were known to be true, then\nanother kind of entity, with its attendant causal powers, would have\nto exist.\n\nAt this point we might ask what licenses us to conclude that the\nentity whose existence Chatton proves is indeed a res?\nCan\u2019t propositions get to be true and false for other reasons\nbesides a res coming to be or passing away? Chatton did not\nthink they could, at least in most cases, and his Principle exhibits\nthis commitment in version (2) above; the only way to add to an\nontological snapshot is to add things (res) to the picture.\nHence he relies on and is clearly committed to an assumption which\nsays that if an existent makes a difference to truth then it must be a\nreal thing (res). This assumption can be found in Aristotle\n(e.g., Physics, 225a 1\u201320) and Scotus (e.g.,\nOrdinatio I d. 30 qq. 1\u20132, n. 41). Often called the\nprinciple of contradictories, it can be stated as follows:\n\u201cThere can be no passage from contradictory state to\ncontradictory state without the generation or corruption of some thing\n(res).\u201d\n",
