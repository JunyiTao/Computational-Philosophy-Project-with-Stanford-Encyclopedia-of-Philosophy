    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods for Children || The Right to Solitude\n4.4 The Right to Solitude\n\nFor both children and adults, periods of solitude can be a condition\nfor a good life (as well as for fully enjoying relationships with\nothers). Unlike adults, children cannot decide to exit all\nrelationships; nor should they, provided they are subject to the\nlegitimate authority of guardians. Therefore they must rely on adults\nin order to have some protected time during which to be free from\nothers\u2019 company if they chose so. Recently, it has been argued\nthat children greatly benefit from having a significant amount of\nunstructured time during which they can realize a number of\ngoods\u2014such as play or creativity\u2014to which they have\nunique, or privileged access (Macleod 2010b, 2014; Brighouse &\nSwift 2014; Brennan 2014; Gheaus 2015a, 2015b). It is possible that\noccasional voluntary solitude is necessary for the full enjoyment of\nsuch goods. The existence of the right will depend on how these goods\ncontribute to children\u2019s wellbeing qua children, to\ntheir developmental interests, and\u2014in cases of conflict between\nthe two\u2014on how we ought to weight the child\u2019s interest in\nwellbeing during childhood against her interest in future\nwellbeing.\n",
