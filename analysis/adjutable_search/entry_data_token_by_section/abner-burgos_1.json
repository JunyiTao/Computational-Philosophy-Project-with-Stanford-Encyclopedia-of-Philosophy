    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nAbner\u2019s works may be divided into three different categories: polemic,\nscientific and philosophic.\n\nPolemic works: Mostradorde Justicia is the earliest\nand most important work of those writings of Abner that have survived.\nOnly a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists\ntoday, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a\nbrief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his\nconversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part\nof the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew\n(the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of\npolemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a\nChristian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to\nbelieve in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten\nchapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of\nparagraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of\nthe\n debate.[6]\n\nSummary of the chapters:\n\nI.\n Abner indicated which books could be used as a basis for proof\nduring polemic debates. In this chapter the master and the rebel agree\nthat both sides may bring in proofs from philosophical arguments.\n II.\n Abner\u2019s proof of the giving of a new law upon the coming of the\nMessiah.\n III.\n An explanation and justification for the revelation of a new\nlaw.\n IV.\n The arguments of those who deny that the messiah was to come and\ndie and bring atonement for the sin of Adam; and what refutes those\narguments.\n V.\n The arguments of the rebel which contradict the master\u2019s position\non the Trinity and the Incarnation of the person of the Son in the\nhuman form of the Christ, and the masters answer to those\narguments.\n VI.\n The rebel\u2019s arguments against incarnation of the divinity in the\nhuman form of the Christ and how the master tries to refute those\narguments.\n VII.\n An attempt to prove that the hope that the Jews have in the\ncoming of the prophesied Christ is a false hope, and that Jesus of\nNazareth was the Christ who came according to the time that was\nindicated for the coming of the Christ in the books of the prophets\nand the sages.\n VIII.\n Arguments of the Jews that the Christ has not yet come, which is\nthe basis for their claim that the Christians are the people of Edom\nor Esau, which was to be destroyed and to fall before the coming of\nthe Christ; and an attempt to refute those arguments.\n IX.\n An attempt to prove that the hope that the Jews have for the\ncoming of the Christ at any time is a false hope, and for this reason\nthe Jews are still in exile from the Land of Israel.\n X.\n Abner\u2019s attempt to prove that the Christians, according to the\ncustoms and commandments which they have in their laws, should be\ncalled the Holy Nation of Israel, and that the Jews, according to the\ncustoms and commandments which they have in the laws of the Talmud are\nnot fit to return to the Land of Israel; and the rebel\u2019s attempt to\nrefute those arguments.\n\n\nResponses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book\nsurvived both in the original\n Hebrew[7]\n and in a Castilian\n translation.[8]\n This book is a response to the different letters that Abner\u2019s only\nknown student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and\nChristian\n writings.[9]\n Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book\ncontains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an\nintroduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his\nphilosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2)\nthe Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and\nquotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary\nexistence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof\nof the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and\nother Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which\ntakes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had\nalready come and that Christianity is true.\n\nWhile Abner\u2019s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are\ngenerally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia,\nthe philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of\nthe Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular\nJewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be\nsaved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless\nand are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only\nthe people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence\nafter death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these\nphilosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of\nChristianity. Parts of Abner\u2019s critique of Jewish philosophers in this\nbook most probably influenced Crescas.\n\nLibro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work\nsurvived only\n fragmentally[10]\n in Castilian. The major argument of Abner in this book is that the\nJewish people forgot the secrets of the Torah, which are manifested by\nthe Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity.\n\nSefer Teshuvot ha-Meshubot (The Book of Responses to the\nApostasies) exists only in\n Hebrew.[11]\n There are three polemic\n letters[12]\n that deal especially with scriptural arguments on the subject of the\ncoming of the\n messiah.[13]\n",
