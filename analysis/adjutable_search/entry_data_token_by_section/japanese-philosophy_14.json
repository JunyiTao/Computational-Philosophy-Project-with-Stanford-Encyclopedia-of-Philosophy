    "main_text": "Possible Contributions to Philosophy at Large || Reality as Field\n5.2 Reality as Field\n\nPhilosophers often think of reality as consisting of elements that are\ndiscovered, engineered, combined, and adapted to meet the needs of\ntheir particular systems. In thinking about those elements of reality,\nWestern philosophy has often depended on primary concepts like\nthings, facts, stuff, sensations,\nsubject, object, being, substance,\nessence, attribute, quality, and so forth.\nAs that list of elemental concepts has become standardized, it has\nserved as a glossary for future thinking and further philosophical\ninitiatives. Philosophers may discover or even craft new elements, but\nthey do so against that preexisting background, like filling gaps\nwithin the periodic table. Commonly, those elements are thought to be\nfixed entities that are connected or acted upon by relational forces\nsuch as causes or agents. Change may also be understood as occurring\nthrough the interaction of forces in dynamic opposition, including\ndialectical opposition.\n\nBy contrast, Japanese philosophers typically view reality in terms of\na complex, organic system of interdependent processes, a system that\nincludes themselves as the knowers. Thus, the point of departure for\nthe analysis is not a separation between knower and known. Instead, to\nknow reality is to work with it, not as a discrete agent, but as part\nof a common field, designated by such terms as kokoro or the\n\u201cmidst\u201d (aidagara). The field consists not of\nthings as much as events or processes such as event-words\n(koto), interpenetration, generative force (ki),\nperformative intuition, pure experience,\nnaturalness (jinen), and so forth. In most Japanese\nphilosophies, oppositional polarities do not create dynamism, but\nrather, dynamism is the primary event out of which the polarities can\nbe abstracted after the fact. The polarities have no independent\nexistence of their own and so cannot cause anything, but only have\nexplanatory value for how the dynamism flows, showing its\nvectors of activity.\n\nHow might a field model of reality\u2014especially one that\nexplicitly places the thinker within the field being\nanalyzed\u2014challenge the way classical Western philosophical\nproblems have been posed and addressed? For one, philosophizing would\nseem to emanate not from the thinking thing (res cogitans)\nbut from the field of bodymind praxis.\n\nThe Field of Bodymind Praxis\n\nIf, as the Japanese model suggests, reality is a field and includes\nthe philosopher within that field, then the Way of philosophy is a\ntheory-praxis event within that field. The implication, then, is that\nphilosophizing involves the bodymind as a whole and not just the mind.\nIn other words philosophy is an embodied cognitive activity.\nAgain, this would not be alien to the ancient Greek philosophers.\nPlato\u2019s dialogues were not between ideas, but between people\nwith ideas; Aristotle\u2019s ethics were empty until embodied through\nthe praxis of habit. Philosophy is as much a product of philosophers\nas pottery is the product of potters. Therefore, to what extent, if\nany, can a philosophy transcend time, place, and culture? There would\nbe no philosophy without a flesh-and-blood philosopher and as a human\nbeing that philosopher is encultured in a particular social milieu.\nLike karma, that milieu conditions the philosopher even as the\nphilosopher conditions that milieu. In provoking such questions,\nJapanese philosophy\u2019s field of bodymind praxis coincides with\nconcerns in both ancient and postmodern streams of philosophy within\nthe West.\n",
