    "main_text": "The Semantics of Second-Order Logic || The Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of second-order logic\n3.1 The Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of second-order logic\n\nThe Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game is a game-theoretic\ntool for investigating to what extent two models are similar (see\nentry on\n logic and games\n for a general introduction to Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games).\nTwo isomorphic models would be very similar but normally we are\ninterested in similarity of models that are not isomorphic. The\nEhrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of second-order logic\ncharacterizes \\(\\ma\\equiv_{L^2}\\mn\\), i.e. the proposition that\nexactly the same second-order sentences are true in \\(\\ma\\) and\n\\(\\mb\\), just as the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of first\norder logic characterizes the first order elementary equivalence\n\\(\\ma\\equiv\\mn\\). See the entry on\n first-order model theory\n for more on elementary equivalence.\n\nFor simplicity we disallow function and constant symbols as well as\nfunction variables in this section. Suppose \\(\\ma\\) and \\(\\mb\\) are\ntwo models of the same finite relational vocabulary. In the game which\nwe denote by \\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\) two players I and II pick one at a\ntime subsets (or elements) of A or subsets (or elements) of\nB. During round i of the game player I can pick a\nrelation \\(A_i\\) on A (or an element \\(a_i\\) of A) and\nthen player II has to pick a relation \\(B_i\\) on B of the same\narity as \\(A_i\\) (or an element \\(b_i\\) of on B) and vice\nversa: Player I can instead pick a relation \\(B_i\\) on B (or an\nelement \\(b_i\\) of B) and then II picks a relation \\(A_i\\) on\nA of the same arity as \\(B_i\\) (or an element \\(a_i\\)) of\nA. After n rounds the pairs of played elements\n\\((a_i,b_i)\\) form a binary relation R on \\(A\\times B\\). If\nthis relation is a partial isomorphism of the structures \\(\\ma\\) and\n\\(\\mb\\) expanded by the played relations \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\), i.e., it\npreserves atomic formulas and their negations, we say that II has won.\nThe models \\(\\ma\\) and \\(\\mb\\) satisfy the same second-order sentences\nif and only if for each \\(n\\in \\oN\\) Player II has a winning strategy\nin \\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\). A model class (i.e. a class of models of a\nfixed vocabulary, closed under isomorphisms) K is definable in\nsecond-order logic if and only if there is an n such that if\n\\(\\ma\\in K\\) and Player II has a winning strategy in the\n\\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\), then \\(\\mb\\in K\\).\n\nThe first order version \\(G^1_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\), where players play only\nindividual elements, i.e., no relations are played, is very useful in\nworking with first order logic. Unfortunately the game\n\\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\) is much more complex. It is very difficult to\ninvent winning strategies for Player II except in the trivial case\nwhen \\(\\ma\\cong\\mb\\). If Player I plays a binary relation R on\nA, Player II should be able to play a binary relation \\(R'\\) on\nB such that whatever challenges Player I makes in the rest of\nthe game, even involving new binary relations, the relations R\nand \\(R'\\) look similar. If \\(V=L\\), then countable second-order\nequivalent models (with a finite vocabulary) are actually isomorphic\n(Ajtai 1979). For details, see\n \u00a710.\n Thus consistently in countable models there is no other winning\nstrategy for Player II than an isomorphism. Perhaps this explains why\nthe game is not as useful in second-order logic as it is in first\norder logic. However, if we restrict to monadic second-order logic,\nwhich in terms of the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game means\nrestricting the game to unary predicates, the situation\nchanges. A unary predicate just divides the model into two parts. If\nPlayer I divides A into two parts, Player II should find a\nsimilar division in B. This is more reasonable and there\nactually are useful strategies for Player II. For examples in the\nfinite context see\n \u00a716.\n\n\n\n",
