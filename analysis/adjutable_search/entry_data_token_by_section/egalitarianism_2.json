    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What?\n3. Equality of Condition: Equality of What?\n\n\nA society that satisfied the ideal of formal equality of opportunity\nmight provide grim conditions of life for those who are unsuccessful in\ncompetitions for positions of advantage. Even a perfect meritocracy\nthat satisfies the stringent Rawlsian fair equality of opportunity\nprinciple might impose the same grim conditions of life on those who\nlack marketable merit and skill. The class of competitive losers might\ninclude some who have adequate native talents but fail to make good use\nof them, but some of the losers will be those with the bad luck to be\nborn without much by way of native talent. The question then arises\nwhether any further substantive ideals of equality, beyond meritocratic\nideals, should be affirmed. (See Schar 1967.)\n\n\nOne family of substantive equality ideals, equality of democratic\ncitizenship and civil liberties, is perhaps no more controversial than\nformal equality of opportunity. Democratic equality embraces the norm\nthat law-makers and top public officials should be selected in\ndemocratic elections. All mentally competent adult citizens should be\neligible to vote and run for office in free elections that operate\nagainst a backdrop of freedom of speech and association, and in which\nall votes count equally and majority rule prevails. All citizens should\nhave the same wide rights to freedom of speech, assembly, association,\nand religious practice. Criminal justice rules should be applied\nevenhandedly to all and should embody the procedural values of the rule\nof law.\n\n\nA controversial extension of democratic citizenship resembles\nRawlsian equality of fair opportunity applied to the political arena.\nCall this ideal \u201cequal participation.\u201d Equal participation requires\nthat any individuals in society with the same ambition to influence the\npolitical process and the same talents of political persuasion and\norganization should have equal prospects of influence on the democratic\npolitical process. (See Rawls 2005, Lecture VIII, Christiano 1996 and\n2008, Walzer 1983, for a criticism, Estlund, 1999, and for a related\nview, J. Cohen 1989a.)\n\n\nThe remainder of this section surveys several proposals as to what\n(beyond democratic citizenship and civil liberties) should be\ndistributed equally among the members of society and how equality and\ninequality in the distribution of these goods should be measured. The\nlatter issue can be posed in this way: When various amounts of\nheterogeneous goods are held by different individuals, how can one\nmeasure individuals' overall holdings of goods so that it can be\ndetermined when people's overall holdings are effectively equal?\n",
