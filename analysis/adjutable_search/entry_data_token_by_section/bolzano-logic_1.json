    "main_text": "Logic as Theory of Science\n2. Logic as Theory of Science\n\nBolzano did not long remain satisfied with the logic sketched in the\nContributions Already in 1812, he recorded his intention to\ndevelop a new logic which would lead to a \u201ctotal transformation\nof the a priori sciences\u201d. The Theory of\nScience, written between 1820 and 1830 and published in 1837,\nmarks its realization, embedded in the broader context of general\nepistemology and methodology of science (which Bolzano also counted as\nlogic in a broader sense).\n\nBolzano defined the theory of science by its ultimate goal, which is\nthe division of human knowledge into disciplines and the composition\nof scientific treatises. According to the definition, the theory of\nscience is\n\n\nthe collection of all rules which we must follow, if we want to do a\ncompetent piece of work, when we divide the total domain of truths\ninto individual sciences, and present them in their respective\ntreatises. (TS, I, \u00a71, 7)\n\n\nThis definition presupposes a whole sequence of disciplines involved\nin the construction of a science, each of which is founded on the\npreceding one. The ultimate discipline in this sequence deals with the\ndelimitation of sciences and the principles of style of scientific\nwriting that should lead to the composition of a collection of\nscientific treatises forming an encyclopedia. Bolzano hoped that,\nfollowing the Great Encyclopedia of Diderot and D\u2019Alembert, the\nideal of the Enlightenment, the effort to spread scientifically\norganized useful knowledge would again find its finest expression in\nthe completion of an encyclopedia. In this way, the TS would\ncontribute to the general well-being.\n\nIn order to divide truths into different disciplines and present them\nin particular treatises, we first have to discover them. Such is the\ngoal of The Art of Discovery or Heuristic, which\ncontains rules for finding new truths. Heuristic presupposes the\npossibility of recognizing truths, which is the object of The\nTheory of Knowledge. Now, the decisive step in the exploration of\nthe layers of science leads to the most important part of the\nTS, The Theory of Elements, which analyses the\nobjective conditions of the subjective activity of knowing, namely the\ntheory of ideas, propositions and deduction, considered in and of\nthemselves, in short: formal logic. The Theory of\nFundamentals attempts to show that these elements are\npropositions in themselves and ideas in themselves, that there are\ninfinitely many truths in themselves and that we can know at least\nsome of them. Taking all the disciplines of the TS in the due\norder, we obtain the following structure:\n\nTheory of Fundamentals (Vol. I, \u00a7\u00a717\u201345),\nTheory of Elements, i.e., formal logic (Vol. I and Vol. II,\n\u00a7\u00a746\u2013268),\nTheory of Knowledge (Vol. III, \u00a7\u00a7269\u2013321),\nHeuristic (Vol. III, \u00a7\u00a7322\u2013391),\nTheory of Science Proper, i.e., the theory of the division of the\ntruths into particular sciences and the principles of composition for\nscientific treatises (Vol. IV, \u00a7\u00a7392\u2013718).\n\n",
