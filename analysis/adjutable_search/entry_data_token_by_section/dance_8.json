    "main_text": "Dance, Lived Experience and Somatic Awareness || Bodily (Kinaesthetic) Responses\n3.2 Bodily (Kinaesthetic) Responses\n\nIn dance philosophy there is controversy about how to construe the\nfelt, bodily responses that the audience can and often does have while\nwatching a dance performance. These felt, bodily responses are often\ncalled \u201ckinaesthetic\u201d, with the alternate spelling of\n\u201ckinesthetic\u201d (combining the movement sense of\n\u201ckinetic\u201d with a physical sort of sense of the aesthetic\nas beautiful, or graceful and the like) and the mechanism by which\nthese responses occur is one of the things that is debated. Two of the\nquestions that arise here are the following: 1) What is the causal\nprocess by which kinesthetic responses are felt? and 2) To what\nextent, if any, does an understanding of this causal process inform a\nproper understanding of dance qua dance as art?\n\nTo take the first question first: Causal processes that can explain\nkinesthetic responses in dance are by no means well understood. It is\nnot clear, for example, how \u201cempathy\u201d, understood in the\nbroad sense as the ability to feel something based on what we perceive\nas someone else\u2019s experience, like a dance performer\u2019s,\ninforms our kinaesthetic and other appreciative responses. (For more\non empathy and the kinaesthetic aspect of performance see Foster 2008\nand 2011.)\n\nSome contemporary philosophers of dance such as Barbara Montero\n(2006a, 2006b, 2012, and 2013) use research in cognitive science and\nin neuroscience in order to ascertain the answers to why audience\nmembers report feeling kinesthetic responses such as a quickening\nheart rate and certain tensions along with more mysterious feelings in\ntheir muscles and nervous systems. (For more on how dance philosophy\nincorporates approaches from cognitive science in these and other\nareas see\n Section 4,\n below. See also Bresnahan 2017b; Reason and Reynolds 2010; Sklar\n2008; and Smyth 1984 for more on kinaesthetic response to dance.)\n",
