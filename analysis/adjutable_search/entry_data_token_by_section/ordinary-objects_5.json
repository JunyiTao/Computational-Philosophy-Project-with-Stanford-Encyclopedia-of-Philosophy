    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Indeterminate Identity\n2.4 Indeterminate Identity\n\nA wooden ship is constructed and christened \u2018Theseus II\u2019.\nAs planks come loose over the years, they are discarded and replaced.\nAfter three hundred years, the last of the original planks is\nreplaced. Call the resulting ship \u2018the mended ship\u2019. The\ndescendants of the original owners have been collecting the discarded\noriginal planks, and\u2014three hundred years after the\nchristening\u2014they obtain the last of them and construct a ship\nthat is indistinguishable from the original. Call the resulting ship\n\u2018the reconstructed ship\u2019. Which, if either, of these two\nships is identical to Theseus II? It is natural to suppose that there\nis no fact of the matter: it is indeterminate which of the two ships\nis Theseus II.\n\nHowever, there arguably can never be indeterminate cases of\nidentity:\n\n(ST1)\nSuppose that it is indeterminate whether Theseus II = the mended\nship.\n(ST2)\nIf so, then Theseus II has the property of being indeterminately\nidentical to the mended ship.\n(ST3)\nThe mended ship does not have the property of being\nindeterminately identical to the mended ship.\n(ST4)\nIf Theseus II has this property and the mended ship lacks this\nproperty, then Theseus II \u2260 the mended ship.\n(ST5)\nIf Theseus II \u2260 the mended ship, then it isn\u2019t\nindeterminate whether Theseus II = the mended ship.\n(ST6)\nSo (by reductio), it isn\u2019t indeterminate whether Theseus II\n= the mended ship.\n\n\nST2 relies on two seemingly innocuous inferences: (a) from its being\nindeterminate whether Theseus II is identical to the mended ship to\nTheseus II\u2019s being indeterminately identical to the mended ship\nand (b) from there to Theseus II\u2019s having the property of being\nindeterminately identical to the mended ship. ST3 seems trivial as\nwell: the mended ship is definitely self-identical, so it does not\nitself have this property. ST4 looks to be an immediate consequence of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law: if Theseus II and the mended ship differ with\nrespect to even one property, then they are distinct. ST5 is trivial:\nif they\u2019re not identical, then it isn\u2019t indeterminate\nwhether they are\n identical.[29]\n\n\nEliminativists may go on to argue from ST6 to the conclusion that\nthere are no ships, as follows. If indeed it isn\u2019t indeterminate\nwhether Theseus II is the mended ship, then there would seem to be\nfive options:\n\n(i)\nTheseus II is identical only to the mended ship.\n (ii)\nTheseus II is identical only to the reconstructed ship.\n (iii)\n Theseus II is identical both to the mended ship and to the\nreconstructed ship.\n (iv)\nTheseus II is neither ship; it has ceased to exist.\n(v)\nTheseus II never existed in the first place; there are no\nships.\n\n\nOptions (i) and (ii) seem intolerably arbitrary, since the mended ship\nand reconstructed ship seem to have equal claim to being Theseus II.\nOption (iii) is out as well. If Theseus II is identical to both ships,\nthen (by the transitivity of identity) they must be identical to one\nanother; but they cannot be identical because they have different\nproperties (e.g., the one but not the other is composed of the\noriginal planks). Option (iv) is problematic as well. The history of\nmaintenance by itself would have sufficed for the persistence of\nTheseus II; the preservation and reassembly of the original parts by\nitself would likewise have sufficed for the persistence of Theseus II;\nand here we have managed to secure both. As Parfit (1971: 5) would\nsay, \u201cHow could a double success be a failure?\u201d Thus, we\nget (v) from argument by elimination.\n Fitting.[30]\n\nSome respond to the argument by maintaining that it is indeterminate\nwhich of various objects \u2018Theseus II\u2019 picks out. If\nthat\u2019s right, then ST2 is arguably false. One cannot infer the\nexistence of an individual who is indeterminately identical to Sue\nfrom the fact that it is indeterminate whether Sue (or rather Morgan)\nis Harry\u2019s best friend. Analogously, one cannot infer the\nexistence of an individual that is indeterminately identical to the\nmended ship from the fact that it is indeterminate whether Theseus II\nis the mended\n ship.[31]\n\n\nThe prima facie problem with this response is that there do not seem\nto be multiple objects such that it\u2019s indeterminate which one\n\u2018Theseus II\u2019 picks out. After all, when \u2018Theseus\nII\u2019 was first introduced, there was only one ship around to\nreceive the name! One can address this problem by maintaining that,\ndespite appearances, two ships were present at the christening: one\nthat would later be composed of entirely different planks and another\nthat would later be reassembled from a pile of discarded planks. What\nis indeterminate is which of these two temporarily colocated ships was\nchristened \u2018Theseus\n II\u2019.[32]\n\nOther responses are available. One might deny ST2 on the grounds that\nthere is no such property as the property of being indeterminately\nidentical to Theseus II. One might deny ST3, affirming that the mended\nship is indeterminately identical to the mended ship. One might deny\nST4 by denying that the distinctness of Theseus II and the mended ship\ncan be inferred from the fact that they do not share the indicated\nproperty. Or one might embrace option (iv), on the (stage-theoretic)\ngrounds that the ship that existed at the time of the christening is\nnot identical to any ship that exists at any earlier or later time.\n [33]\n",
