    "main_text": "Theoretical Responses\n3. Theoretical Responses\n\nIt\u2019s useful to think of Lewis and Perry as both rejecting the\nSimple Picture and as responding to its inadequacies by introducing\ndifferent sorts of complications.\n\nPerry rejects the Simple Picture\u2019s reliance on a simple, binary\nbelief relation. According to Perry, we need theoretical resources\nthat keep track, not just of which propositions subjects believe, but\nof the mechanisms by which they come to believe them.\n\nLewis rejects the Simple Picture\u2019s reliance on traditional\npropositions as the objects of belief. According to Lewis, we need\nobjects of belief that carve up a space of possibilities whose points\naren\u2019t worlds, but positions within worlds\u2014that is, worlds\ntogether with a position specified within them.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss Lewis\u2019 proposal first, then Perry\u2019s in\n section 3.2.\n",
