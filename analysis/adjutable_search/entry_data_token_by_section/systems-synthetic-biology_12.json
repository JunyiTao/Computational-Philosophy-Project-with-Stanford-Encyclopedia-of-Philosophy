    "main_text": "Revisiting Classical Philosophical Questions || Explanatory Pluralism\n4.2 Explanatory Pluralism\n\nSystems biology also brings new insights to discussions of scientific\nexplanation. In particular, network analysis in systems biology have\nfurther sparked discussion about the roles of mathematical\nabstractions to identify organizational features, counterfactual\ndependencies, and generalizable aspects of biological systems. The\nintegration of different disciplinary inputs and emphasis on\nmathematical modeling make systems biology a particularly interesting\ncase for discussions of whether the mechanistic account can fully\ncapture the diversity of explanatory practices in contemporary\nbiology.\n\nMechanistic accounts initially emphasized the differences between the\nexplanatory ideal of covering laws in physics and explanations in\nmolecular biology (Craver & Tabery 2015). Mechanistic explanations\ncite how biological functions arise from the interactions and\norganization of component parts or entities (Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Machamer et al. 2000; Glennan 2002). Since research in systems\nbiology is often integrated with research in molecular and cell\nbiology, some have argued that many cases in systems biology can\nreadily be seen as an extension of mechanistic research (Boogerd et\nal. 2013; Richardson & Stephan 2007). But although abstract\nmodeling is compatible with mechanistic research, it is a contested\nissue whether abstract models are developed towards research aims that\nare distinct from mechanistic explanations. While some contend that\nmathematical models are primarily used as inputs to or heuristics for\nmechanistic explanations, i.e., as mechanistic schemas (Darden 2002;\nMatthiessen 2015), others interpret the emphasis on quantitative and\ndynamic aspects as a departure from mechanistic explanations. One\nargument in support of the latter is that the modeling process does\nnot proceed from abstract to more detailed models, but in the opposite\ndirection, suggesting that mechanistic details may be vehicles for\nmore generic explanations rather than the other way around (Braillard\n2010; Serban & Green 2020). A second argument refers to the\ndifficulty of reconstructing a causal story from the abstract\nmathematical models (Issad & Malaterre 2015). Systems biology may\ntherefore also offer cases of non-mechanistic explanations.\n\nTopological or structural explanations emphasize how\nnetworks architectures generically determine dynamic behaviors,\nindependently of the causal details of the network (Huneman 2010;\nKosti\u0107 2020; Kosti\u0107 et al. 2020; Su\u00e1rez &\nDeulofeu 2019). Mathematical analysis of network structures underlying\nbiological robustness has been argued to exemplify this explanatory\ngoal (Jones 2014). Another type of non-mechanistic explanations is\nwhat Wouters (2007) calls design explanations, first outlined\nin the context of comparative physiology. Design explanations do not\ndescribe how a biological function is causally produced but instead\nclarify why a given design (and not an alternative design) is present.\nThey do so by pointing to constraints on the possible designs that\nmake some designs good, some suboptimal, and others impossible. The\nrelevance of design explanations for systems biology lies in the\ninterest to specify relations between functional capacities (e.g.,\nrobustness) and system organization (e.g., integral feedback control)\nvia design principles that are independent of specific contexts of\nimplementation (Braillard 2010; Boogerd 2017, see also Shinar &\nFeinberg 2011 for a candidate example from systems biology). Design\nexplanations highlight explanatory features similar to what Batterman\nand Rice (2014) call minimal model explanations (see also\nGross 2015). These explanatory accounts have been interpreted as\nvarieties of constraint-based explanations (Green and Jones\n2016), because they prioritize physical and formal constraints at the\nexpense of mechanistic details. Aside from highlighting differences in\nthe epistemic aims of explanation, some accounts also provide an\nontological justification for different explanatory\nstrategies, i.e., that higher-level phenomena are characterized by a\nfunctional loss of and autonomy from mechanistic details at lower\nlevels (Batterman and Green 2021; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020).\n\nAnother approach is to consider explanations in systems biology as\nmergers of different types of explanations. Some accounts highlight\nthe compatibility of different explanatory aims as ingredients in a\npluralistic approach to biological explanation (Brigandt et al. 2018;\nMekios 2015). One way to clarify the compatibility is that different\napproaches highlight constitutive or causal aspects\n(Fagan 2015). Distinguishing between these can possibly help identify\nthe distinct contributions of causal mechanistic modeling and\nmathematical analysis of network dynamics. Whereas causal relations\nare often prioritized in mechanistic accounts, Fagan (2015) suggests a\njoint account of collaborative explanations that combine\ndescriptions of the spatial organization and the causal relations in\nthe system. The increasing reliance on formal modeling in systems\nbiology also call for an examination of the relation between\nmathematical and mechanistic explanations (Baker\n2005; Brigandt 2013; Mekios 2015). Some have argued that an updated\naccount of dynamic mechanistic explanations is required,\nhighlighting the importance of mathematical and computational modeling\nfor understanding non-linear dynamics, cyclic organization, and\ncomplex feedback relations (Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2011, 2012;\nBrigandt 2013). In this context, idealized models are important for\nunderstanding the organization of mechanisms within a larger network\nstructure (Bechtel 2015b; Levy & Bechtel 2013; van Eck &\nWright\n 2021).[8]\n\nAlthough much, or perhaps most, of the philosophical work on systems\nbiology has focused on explanation, one cannot assume that explanation\nis the sole aim of systems biology research (MacLeod & Nersessian\n2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b). Design principle may not only explain how\nbiological functions are realized but also allow for explorations of\nwhether the same function could be realized in other or simpler ways\n(Briat et al. 2016). Thus, synthetic and systems biology also call for\nphilosophers to examine other epistemic aims, such as prediction,\ncontrol, and design, and well as theoretical and practical interests\nin understanding the minimal requirements for biological functions and\nlife itself.\n",
