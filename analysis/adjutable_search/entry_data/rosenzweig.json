    "preamble": "\n\n\nFranz Rosenzweig (1886\u20131929) ranks as one of the most original Jewish\nthinkers of the modern period. As a historian of philosophy,\nRosenzweig played a brief but noteworthy role in the neo-Hegelian\nrevival on the German intellectual scene of the 1910s. In the years\nimmediately following the First World War, he sought to bring about\nthe \u201ctotal renewal of thinking\u201d through a novel synthesis\nof philosophy and theology he named the \u201cnew thinking.\u201d\nRosenzweig\u2019s account of revelation as a call from the Absolute other\nhelped shape the course of early 20th-century Jewish and\nChristian theology. His reflections on human finitude and on the\ntemporal contours of human experience made a lasting impact on\n20th-century existentialism; and his account of dialogue\npresented the interpersonal relation between \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cYou\u201d as both constitutive of selfhood and as yielding\nredemptive communal consequences. Rosenzweig engaged in two major\nworks of translation, most notably the German translation of the Bible\nin which he collaborated with Martin Buber. He founded a center for\nJewish adult education in\nFrankfurt\u2014the Lehrhaus\u2014which attracted the most\nimportant young German-Jewish intellectuals of its time, and which is\nstill held up today as a model for educational programs of its\ntype.\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s renown, especially in Jewish and Christian\nintellectual circles, stems in large part from a fascination with his\ncompelling biography, a biography that included a near-conversion to\nChristianity, an inspired return to Judaism, the composition of the\nbeginning of his magnum opus on military postcards sent home\nfrom the Balkan front, the abandonment of a promising academic career\nin order to live and teach in the Frankfurt Jewish community, and his\nheroic efforts to continue his thinking, writing, and communal work\nafter succumbing to the paralysis brought on by ALS. But\nRosenzweig\u2019s singular philosophical importance rests almost\nentirely on his having written what is arguably the greatest work of\nmodern Jewish philosophy: The Star of Redemption. The\nStar is a system of philosophy that seeks to give a\ncomprehensive and ramified account of \u201cAll\u201d that is, and of\nthe human being\u2019s place within that \u201cAll\u201d. It is a\nsystem in which \u201crevelation\u201d plays a vital conceptual and\nmethodological role, and in which Judaism and Christianity are claimed\nto offer glimpses, each through the course of its liturgical calendar,\nof the redemptive unity of the \u201cAll\u201d which the philosopher\nseeks to know.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Personal and Intellectual Development\n\n\nRosenzweig was born in 1886, and grew up as the only child of Georg\nand Adele Rosenzweig, in an intellectually and culturally vibrant,\nassimilated Jewish home in Kassel. After beginning his university\nstudies in 1904 with the intention of studying medicine, first in\nG\u00f6ttingen and then in Munich, Rosenzweig moved in the fall of 1906\nto Freiburg. The University of Freiburg was one of the centers of the\nSouthwest school of neo-Kantianism at the time, and Rosenzweig studied\nphilosophy there with Heinrich Rickert and Jonas Cohn, and history with\nFriedrich Meinecke. By the early months of 1908, Rosenzweig had decided\nto write a dissertation on the genesis of Hegel\u2019s political\nphilosophy under Meinecke.\n1.1 Baden-Baden\n\n\nPerhaps the most important early influence on Rosenzweig\u2019s\nphilosophical development was his cousin, Hans Ehrenberg, whom\nRosenzweig would later claim was \u201cmy real teacher in\nphilosophy.\u201d Ehrenberg was a student of Wilhelm Windelband, and\nhe was a notable figure in the rise of neo-Hegelianism which Windelband\ndescribed, with a mixture of interest and surprise, in his 1910\nlandmark lecture, \u201cDie Erneuerung des\nHegelianismus.\u201d The question of the possibility of a renewal\nof Hegelianism was at the heart of Ehrenberg\u2019s attempt, early in\n1910, to collect some of the brightest young intellectuals, historians,\nand scholars of philosophy from southwest Germany together in\nBaden-Baden for a series of symposia devoted to making\n\u201ccontemporary culture into the object of historical\ncontemplation.\u201d Rosenzweig shared in Ehrenberg\u2019s enthusiasm\nin founding this \u201cBaden-Baden Gesellschaft,\u201d so much so\nthat its subsequent failure had a dramatic effect on his own thinking.\nRosenzweig apparently saw as the task of the Baden-Baden group the\nrevival of a philosophical-historical consciousness that would rival\nwhat Hegel\u2019s \u201cSpirit\u201d had meant for its age.\nTogether, the young Rosenzweig believed, these up-and-coming\nintellectuals would reconcile in science their respective subjectivity\nwith the objectivity of their time. They would take seriously the\nradical individuality of person and specialization of science that\ntypified the age, and would at once forge the \u201cunity\u201d of\nsuch \u201cununifiables\u201d in a holistic vision of\nknowledge and culture befitting the Zeitgeist. But the first,\nand what would end up being the only meeting of the society, appears to\nhave been an abysmal failure precisely because the historians who came\nto the meeting\u2014most of whom were, like Rosenzweig, students of\nMeinecke\u2014could in no way stomach the kind of sweeping,\nmetaphysical account of history leading up to the present that\nRosenzweig sought to revive. The Baden-Baden Gesellschaft dissolved as\nquickly as it was formed.\n\n\nThe failure of the Baden-Baden experiment led Rosenzweig to reach\nwhat he took to be an important conclusion: the individualism of\ncontemporary culture and the specialization of contemporary science\nwere not to be dissolved in an intellectual-spiritual unity of the\npresent. In Rosenzweig\u2019s diagnosis of the failure of\nBaden-Baden, one thereby finds hints towards Rosenzweig\u2019s later\ninsight that for a system of philosophy to grasp particulars as such,\nthe unity of that system must be grasped as future.\n1.2 Hegel and the State\n\n\nIn the fall of 1910, Rosenzweig left Freiburg for Berlin, where he\nbegan a period of archival work on Hegel\u2019s handwritten\nNachlass. Here he gathered the material for what would\neventually be his two-volume work, Hegel und der Staat.\nRosenzweig earned his PhD in the summer of 1912 for part of this work,\nand the book was nearly completed before the outbreak of the First\nWorld War, but Rosenzweig would only come to publish it in 1920.\nRosenzweig\u2019s Hegel und der Staat addresses itself to the\ntask Meinecke had delineated, in his Cosmopolitanism and the\nNational State, of understanding the political ideas of the\n19th Century as rooted in the personal and intellectual\ndevelopment of the creative thinkers who articulated them. In the book,\nRosenzweig traces the genesis of Hegel\u2019s political thought back\nto Hegel\u2019s earliest personal and philosophical musings over the\nrelationship between the human being and the world. Through careful\nreadings of Hegel\u2019s early handwritten manuscripts, Rosenzweig\nattempts to show that the Hegel of the mid-1790s found himself in a\nstate of perplexity over the possibility of reconciling the radical\nsubjectivity of the free individual human being with the objectivity of\nthe world. According to Rosenzweig, the path which the young Hegel\nfinds out of this perplexity, whereby he comes to understand the free\nself as realizing itself, and at once reconciling itself to the world,\nin time, enabled Hegel\u2019s own personal reconciliation\nwith his moment in history. More decisively for the history of\npolitical philosophy, it determined both the historical character of\nHegel\u2019s later thought, and the way he later came to understand\nthe reciprocal relation between the individual and the state in\nhistory.\n\n\nTowards the end of the book, Rosenzweig\u2014once again taking up\nMeinecke\u2019s Fragestellung\u2014considers Hegel\u2019s\nambiguous relation to the idea of the nation state. He notes how far\nHegel\u2019s rational view of the state is from the nationalist\nthought that arose in the second half of the 19th Century.\nBut he at once finds the confidence in the state which Hegel bequeathed\nto later nationalist thinkers\u2014a confidence in the state as the\nlocus of personal or national fulfillment, respectively\u2014to have\ncontributed to both the rise and the fall of the Bismarckian Reich.\n\n\nIn his post-war preface to Hegel und der Staat, Rosenzweig\nreflects on his initial hopes that the book might serve to\n\u201cdissolve the hard and limited Hegelian conception of the state\n\u2026 in its coming-to-be through the life of its thinker.\u201d\nIt is indeed the case that in situating Hegel\u2019s mature views of the\nstate within the trajectory of a lifetime of reflection about the\nrelationship between the self and the world in time, these mature\nviews seem to give way before the myriad political ideas and practical\npossibilities Hegel\u2019s thought might generate.  Perhaps the greatest\ncontribution Hegel und der Staat makes to its time, then, is\nthe way it shows Hegel\u2019s political thinking to be unexpectedly\nfruitful, just as Dilthey and Nohl had shown Hegel\u2019s theological thought to\nbe in the first decade of the 1900s. For it introduces to its readers\na Hegel whose reflections on selfhood, politics, and history are\nremarkably diverse, and hence available for appropriation in\nremarkably diverse directions. It is for this reason Rosenzweig had\nhoped, before the outset of the First World War, that his presentation\nof Hegel might help \u201copen up the prospect of a German future\nthat would be\u2014both inwardly and outwardly\u2014more\nspacious,\u201d that it might \u201cplay its small part in\npreparing, insofar as a book can\u201d, the path upon which\n\u201cthe Bismarckian state, its breathing restricted both internally\nand externally, would expand itself into a free empire breathing the\nair of the world.\u201d After the War, however, Rosenzweig could only\nmourn the fact that \u201ca field of ruins marks the spot where the\nempire previously stood.\u201d\n1.3 \u201cThe Oldest System-Program of German Idealism\u201d\n\n\nWhile still at work on Hegel und der Staat in 1913,\nRosenzweig made a scholarly discovery which led him\u2014and\nscholars of German Idealism after him\u2014to rethink the origins of\nGerman Idealism, and which at once precipitated a controversy in the\nfield that continues to this day. Earlier that year, the Prussian Royal\nLibrary in Berlin had acquired a fragment of a text, written by Hegel,\ngiven the title \u201cAn Ethics,\u201d because these were the\ntext\u2019s first two words. But a study of the fragment\u2019s\ncontent convinced Rosenzweig that the text was no narrow investigation\nof a particular field of philosophy, i.e., ethics, but rather took up\nthe very task that would later define German Idealism for posterity:\nthe task of system. Indeed, the text revealed its author committed to\nconstructing \u201ca complete system of all ideas or, what is the\nsame, of all practical postulates\u201d; it claims to find the point\nof unity for the distinct philosophical domains of nature and freedom\nin the aesthetic act; it calls for a new mythology in the service of a\nnew religion which would unify the enlightened and unenlightened\ntogether in \u201cthe last great work of humankind.\u201d Utilizing a\nmethod of dating Hegelian manuscripts introduced by Dilthey and Nohl,\nby which manuscripts could be dated according to landmarks in the\ndevelopment of Hegel\u2019s handwriting, Rosenzweig determined the\ntext to have been written in the early summer months of 1796. This led\nRosenzweig to conclude that he had found, in this fragment, the\n\u201cOldest System-Program of German Idealism,\u201d an explicit\narticulation of the defining task of German Idealism, written\n\u201cthree or at least two years before that work which up to now has\ncounted \u2026 as the first systematic attempt of the idealistic\nmovement \u2026 to bound the whole philosophical world between the\ncovers of a book, Schelling\u2019s [System of]\nTranscendental Idealism.\u201d\n\n\nIn his study of the fragment he found, moreover, Rosenzweig reached\na further controversial conclusion. If the text was to be dated in the early summer of 1796, as\nHegel\u2019s handwriting suggested, this\nwould place the writing of the text at the very moment in Hegel\u2019s\nlife when, according to Rosenzweig, he was in the midst of his\nmelancholic despair over the possibility of reconciling the\nsubjectivity of the free self with the objectivity of the world. If\nthis were the case, Rosenzweig reasoned, Hegel couldn\u2019t\npossibly have been the author of the text. \u201cOnly one person in\nthe philosophical Germany of 1796 possessed this youthful-victorious\ntone\u201d that pervades the text-fragment, Rosenzweig determined, and\nthat person was Hegel\u2019s friend and former fellow-student at the\nT\u00fcbinger Stift, F.W.J Schelling. In all likelihood, surmised\nRosenzweig, Schelling had sent or shown an original version of the text\nto Hegel, who, in turn, had copied it over for future perusal. The\noriginal had since been lost, and only Hegel\u2019s copy remained.\nSince the existing copy was in Hegel\u2019s handwriting, Rosenzweig\nconcluded, the text had mistakenly been assigned to Hegel himself. In\nRosenzweig\u2019s \u201cOldest System-Program of German\nIdealism,\u201d an article he wrote in 1914 and published in 1917,\nRosenzweig presented the two-page text, together with a demonstration\nof his conclusions and a determination of the position the text might\nbe said to occupy within Schelling\u2019s early writings.\nRosenzweig\u2019s presentation received high praise from its initial\nreviewers, but his conclusions about the text\u2014and about\nSchelling\u2019s authorship, in particular\u2014have been hotly\ncontested ever since. Although no scholarly consensus has yet been\nreached regarding the actual author of the fragment\u2014whether it\nbe Hegel himself, Schelling, H\u00f6lderlin, or perhaps yet another\nfigure in their circles\u2014scholars have generally come to\nquestion the supposition that Hegel suffered from a depression during\nthe late 1790s that would rule him out as its author.\n1.4 1913: Near-Conversion and Return\n\n\nRosenzweig moved to Leipzig for the winter and summer semesters of\n1913. There, while still conducting his research on Hegel, he studied\nmathematics and jurisprudence, and began what was to become a close\nfriendship with a young lecturer in jurisprudence, Eugen Rosenstock.\nThe two began to meet regularly to discuss philosophical and\ntheological matters. At stake for Rosenzweig appear to have been\nquestions closely linked to those he had contemplated during the\nBaden-Baden experiment and which remained on his mind as he\ninvestigated Hegel\u2019s coming of age in Hegel und der\nStaat: how can our radical subjectivity or selfhood be reconciled\nwith our grasp of the world? and how must the divine be conceived such\nthat it be understood as grounding and unifying both selfhood and\nworldliness? The failure at Baden-Baden had led Rosenzweig to question\nhis earlier historicist view that individual subjects might find their\nfulfillment as subjects in the world by joining together to form a\nzeitgeistig unity, worshipping in the Zeitgeist\n\u201cthe God revealing itself in the here and now.\u201d But how\nelse was the relationship between self and world to be grasped? This\nquestion appears to have been the source of some existential disquiet\nfor Rosenzweig, and heading into the summer of 1913, he appears to have\nentertained certain Gnostic notions that one could only realize\none\u2019s selfhood, and ground that selfhood in a relation to the\ndivine, through a denial of the world. But on July 7, 1913, Rosenzweig\nengaged in an all-night discussion with Rosenstock and his\n(Rosenzweig\u2019s) cousin Rudolf Ehrenberg, which Rosenzweig would\nlater look back on as the transformative event in his life. Over the\ncourse of this night, Rosenstock convinced Rosenzweig not only to\nrethink the significance of Christianity\u2014Rosenzweig apparently\ncame into that evening with a view of \u201ctrue\u201d Christianity\nas inherently anti-worldly, while Rosenstock stressed\nChristianity\u2019s redemptive work in the world\u2014but even that\na Christian life grounded in revelation and devoted to the mission of\nredeeming the world through history represented the only\ncoherent and compelling path to the kind of reconciliation of selfhood\nand worldliness which Rosenzweig sought. Rosenstock\u2019s challenge\nprecipitated a crisis in Rosenzweig: he later claimed to have spent the\nhours after the conversation alone in his room, pistol at hand,\n\u201cface to face with the Nothing.\u201d He emerged from the\nexperience determined to convert to Christianity in order thereby to\ntake up his place in the historical realization of redemption in the\nworld.\n\n\nThree months later, having returned to Berlin in October of 1913,\nRosenzweig reversed his decision, this as a result of a new conception\nof Judaism which would remain central to his thought for the rest of\nhis life. Through its mission of neighborly love, Rosenzweig continued\nto maintain, Christianity carries out the redemptive realization of\nunity in the world. But Judaism also has a vital role to play in the\nworld\u2019s redemption. The Jewish people lives in large part closed\noff from the rest of the world; but in its insular communal life,\nRosenzweig now claims, it anticipates the ultimate redemption, and\nthereby represents to the rest of the world the goal they must ever\npursue. Having arrived at a manner of grasping the reconciliation of\nthe self and the world in history that was common to Christianity and\nJudaism, Rosenzweig no longer saw himself compelled to convert, and\ninstead committed himself to a return to the Judaism that was his by\nbirth.\n1.5 Hermann Cohen\n\n\nDuring the following year, Rosenzweig rededicated himself to Judaism\nby enrolling in courses at the Berlin \u201cHochschule f\u00fcr die\nWissenschaft des Judentums.\u201d Hermann Cohen, the esteemed\nneo-Kantian, had retired from his professorship in Marburg the year\nbefore and was teaching at the Hochschule, and Rosenzweig developed an\nespecially close relationship with the elder philosopher. Rosenzweig\nformulated his earliest ideas on Jewish education through a public\ncorrespondence with Cohen, and it was in the wake of that exchange that\nCohen worked together with Rosenzweig and his father\u2014in the\nmonths before both Cohen and Rosenzweig\u2019s father died\u2014to\nestablish a new \u201cAcademy for the Study of Judaism\u201d meant to\nadvance both scholarship in the field of Jewish Studies and a new\nprogram for Jewish communal education. In the month before\nhis death, furthermore, Cohen allowed Rosenzweig to read the proofs to his last\ngreat work, Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism,\npublished after his death, in 1919. Rosenzweig found in this work what\nhe took to be a significant break away from Cohen\u2019s critical\nIdealism, and from the Idealist tradition in general. Moreover, in the\nbook\u2019s presentation of God and the human being as\n\u201ccorrelated,\u201d as independent but at once reciprocally\ndetermining one another, Rosenzweig believed to discover an\nanticipation of his own developing view of actuality as grounded in the\nreciprocal relations between God, self, and world.\n1.6 Revelation and \u201cAtheistic Theology\u201d\n\n\nIn 1914, already under Cohen\u2019s influence and unmoved by the\nromantic theology of Martin Buber popular at the time, Rosenzweig wrote\nhis first essay in Jewish theology, \u201cAtheistic Theology.\u201d\nThe article criticized as atheistic those tendencies of contemporary\nJewish theology, Buber\u2019s foremost among them, to conceive of the\nidea of God as an expression of the vital Jewish aspiration for unity.\nSuch theology, Rosenzweig argued, reduced the divine to no more than a\nhuman projection. In lieu of such contemporary trends, Rosenzweig\ninsists that theology in his time cannot avoid taking seriously the\nnotion of revelation: the notion that God, transcendent to and\nindependent of the human being in the world, at once enters into\nrelation with the human being in the world. Indeed, Rosenzweig claims\nhere that only by taking the transcendence and at once the revelation\nof God seriously\u2014rather than reducing the divine to an\nexpression of a Jewish life force\u2014can we grasp the split the\nhuman being experiences in history, between his personal\nself-realization and the realization of the world. It is the notion of\nrevelation, Rosenzweig suggests, that allows us to view history along\nan absolute redemptive trajectory, established by God\u2019s relation\nto the human being in the world. Such a notion of revelation would\nreappear at the center of Rosenzweig\u2019s systematic work, The\nStar of Redemption, a few years later. \n1.7 Wartime Political Writings\n\n\nFor much of the First World War, Rosenzweig served in an\nanti-aircraft unit stationed on the Balkan front. Rosenzweig wrote a\nnumber of pseudonymous essays while serving at the front\u2014signed\n\u201cAdam Bund\u201d or \u201cMacedonicus\u201d\u2014exploring\nthe political ramifications of the war. Some of these essays show\nRosenzweig\u2019s interest in the possibility that Germany might\ndevelop through the war into the centerpiece of a\n\u201cmiddle-European\u201d empire. Rosenzweig\u2019s most original\npolitical composition of the war years was a sweeping account of\npolitical geography entitled, \u201cGlobus: Studies towards the\nWorld-Historical Doctrine of Space.\u201d \u201cGlobus\u201d was\nRosenzweig\u2019s attempt to take seriously the designation of the war\nin which he was participating as a World War. In it,\nRosenzweig presents the history of the shifting geographic landscape of\npolitical power in the world, from the Roman Empire to the present, as\nthe gradual realization of the unity of the globe. The current war,\nRosenzweig suggests, pits three world empires against one another to\ndecide which will guide the globe towards its ultimate unification.\nRosenzweig makes it clear, in \u201cGlobus,\u201d that he understands\nthe events of the war as rooted in the absolute trajectory of world\nhistory that began in the world\u2019s creation and will lead to its\nredemption.\n2. The New Thinking\n\n\nIn a series of correspondences during the war, Rosenzweig also began\nto formulate those basic philosophical ideas that would govern his most\nimportant works. Here Rosenzweig articulated a critique of the\nphilosophical tradition culminating in German Idealism, and along with\nit a positive vision of the direction philosophy and theology, in\ntandem, should take in his time. Rosenzweig would later understand\nthese ideas as part of an intellectual project called the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d which he shared with his closest interlocutors, Eugen\nRosenstock-Huessy, Rudolf Ehrenberg, Hans Ehrenberg, and Viktor von\nWeizs\u00e4cker, and whose core insights had also been reached by\nMartin Buber and Ferdinand Ebner. Drawing from Rosenzweig\u2019s 1925\nessay, \u201cThe New Thinking,\u201d and taking into consideration\nRosenzweig\u2019s varied comments about the \u201cnew thinking\u201d\nin other writings, one can highlight the key ways in which Rosenzweig\nunderstood this \u201cnew thinking\u201d to differ from the\n\u201cold thinking\u201d of the philosophical tradition.\n\n\nRosenzweig understood himself to be living at a transitional moment\nin the history of philosophy. The systems of German Idealism, by\nRosenzweig\u2019s account, brought to completion a 2500-year arc of\nphilosophical thinking initiated by the pre-Socratics. In so doing,\nhowever, they at once brought to light tendencies of the philosophical\ntradition that prevented its representatives from achieving the very\nknowledge they set out to attain. These tendencies of what Rosenzweig\nrefers to as the \u201cold\u201d thinking, include the following:\n\n\nAbstracting from time. In their quest to grasp what is\nuniversally and essentially true, philosophers abstract from the\ntemporal, relational context in which human beings experience the world\naround them. This abstraction that points to what things are\nessentially, Rosenzweig suggests, cannot yield knowledge of things\nas they are. Indeed, such knowing, according to Rosenzweig,\ntakes the pathological case\u2014the case of a being stripped of the\nvery temporal and relational qualities that allow it to be the way it\nis\u2014as what is normal, or as the ideal against which our\nexperience must be measured.\n\nReductive reasoning. The attempt to grasp what things\nare essentially inclines the old thinking to reason out a\nsingle ground for all beings, thereby reducing particular beings to\nsomething other than what they are. Our everyday experience confirms\nfor us, Rosenzweig claims, the fundamental difference between divine,\nworldly, and personal beings. But over the course of the philosophical\ntradition, philosophers have repeatedly sought to reduce these three\nobjects of special metaphysics one to the other, rather than to take\neach up as independent and irreducible. Thus ancient philosophy, by\nRosenzweig\u2019s account, tends to reduce the divine and the human to\naspects of the cosmos; medieval philosophy reduces world and selfhood\nto aspects of the divine; and modern philosophy finds in the human self\nalone the firm ground upon which knowledge of all else is to be\nrooted.\n\nThinking from the Absolute standpoint. The quest for\nthe most comprehensive answer to the \u201cwhat is\u201d question of\nthe philosophical tradition leads the old thinking, in its German\nIdealist manifestation, to aspire to an \u201cAbsolute\u201d\nstandpoint from which the whole of what is\u2014the\n\u201cAll\u201d\u2014can be grasped in its unity. But even if one\nwere to grant the philosopher the possibility of seeing things from the\nstandpoint of the Absolute, such a standpoint would take away from the\nphilosopher the very unique outlook on the actual world which she\npossesses as individual. Moreover, seeking to grasp the whole\nof what is from the Absolute standpoint leads the German Idealist\nphilosopher to grasp particular beings not as they are, but rather as\nmere parts of or manifestations of \u201cthe All.\u201d Grasping such\nparticulars from the perspective of the Absolute hence reduces the\nparticulars qua particulars to nothing.\n\n\n\nFaced with the reductive tendencies of the \u201cold\nthinking\u201d Rosenzweig proposes a \u201cnew thinking\u201d that\npursues knowledge of God, world, and the self in their interrelations,\nfrom out of the individual standpoint of the human being in\ntime.\n\n\nThe new thinker aims to grasp all beings within the \u201cwhole\nhorizon\u201d of her individual standpoint, but her standpoint remains\nthat of an individual human being. She does not transcend her\nindividual, finite standpoint in order to attain a standpoint that\nwould pretend to be Absolute. She does not, according to Rosenzweig,\n\u201chave to take out her own eyes in order to see right.\u201d In\nthis emphasis on the fundamental individuality of the human being,\nRosenzweig sees himself as following in a line of post-Hegelian thought\nbegun by Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer, and epitomized in the life and\nthought of Nietzsche. For only in such thinkers, Rosenzweig claimed,\ndid the individual first cease to be a negligible quantity for\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe new thinker takes the temporal character of human experience\nseriously. Our temporal experience is stamped, Rosenzweig suggests, by\npast, present, and future, and thus our knowledge of the actual is\nmediated through these tenses of time. Before one even begins to\nphilosophize, one finds oneself in a world that is already there; thus\nthe new thinker relates to the things of the world through the prism of\nthe past. The human being experiences her own selfhood as\ncategorically present, and thus the new thinker relates to her\nown self and to the call to selfhood she experiences as present. From\nout of the presence of selfhood, the human being opens up into\nrelations with others, and the new thinker relates to those ultimate\naims which she shares with these others as future. \n\n\nIn its emphasis on temporality, Rosenzweig contends, the new\nthinking breaks away from assumptions about the nature of truth that\ndominate the philosophical tradition. For the new thinking suggests\nthat one does not attain truth by stepping out of the river of time,\nbut rather that truth is that which \u201cunfolds in time.\u201d\nThus, it is not enough to grasp what beings are sub specie\naeternitatis; such beings must be grasped in the nexus of temporal\nrelations in which we experience them.\n\n\nFinally, just as Rosenzweig\u2019s new thinking seeks to reform\nphilosophy\u2019s long-standing assumptions about the object of the\nphilosophical pursuit (truth) and the standpoint out of which the human\nbeing may seek to carry out this pursuit (Absolute or individual), so\nhe suggests that philosophy\u2019s traditional reliance on reason must\nbe qualified in order to attune itself to the temporality of human\nexperience. According to Rosenzweig, if thinking according to reason\nalone runs the risk of reducing all that is to a single ground, it is\nspeech whose fundamental link to the actuality of our temporal\nexperience can serve to temper the reductive excesses of reason. We\narticulate our experience of time through the tenses of our spoken\nlanguage; through language we name the things around us; and it is the\nspoken word through which we enter into actual relations with others.\nInspired by the \u201cnarrative philosophy\u201d to which Schelling\nalludes in the preface to his Ages of the World, and by the\nthought of his contemporary and friend Eugen Rosenstock, Rosenzweig\nthus proposes a form of \u201cspeech-thinking\u201d [see separate\nsection below] as integral to the new thinking\u2019s pursuit of truth\nin time.\n\n\nRosenzweig understands the new thinking to have been made possible\nfor philosophy, in part, by a turn towards theology. Indeed, Rosenzweig\nsuggests that the new philosophical approach towards understanding the\nnature of beings which the new thinking proposes\u2014to wit, that\nour access to knowledge about beings comes not primarily through an\ninquiry into what beings are essentially but rather through serious\nconsideration of the nexus of temporal relations in which we experience\nsuch beings\u2014rests on an insight that is theological at its\nroot. Recall that one of the failings of the \u201cold\nthinking,\u201d according to Rosenzweig, was its tendency to reduce\nthe different kinds of beings to one: grounding the world and the self\nin God, grounding gods and selves in the world, or grounding God and\nworld within the self. But the story theology tells about God, world,\nand the self\u2014and by \u201ctheology\u201d Rosenzweig refers\nquite narrowly to certain dominant trends of Jewish and Christian\ntheology\u2014is not a story about the grounding of any one of these\nfundamental kinds of being in the other, but rather is the story of the\nrelations between God, world, and human being. That is to say,\nthe theology in which Rosenzweig is interested assumes the independent,\nirreducible reality of God, world, and self, and accounts for the\nactuality we experience through the relations between these beings.\nTaking this theological insight as his lead, Rosenzweig proceeds to\nlabel the very threefold temporal experience of actuality through which\nthe new thinking grasps the nexus of relations between beings with\ntheological categories: our experience of the things of the world as\nalready being there in the moment we awaken to our selves is the\nexperience theology describes through its category of creation\nand understands as rooted in a relation between the world of things and\nits divine creator; our experience of being awoken or called to\nselfhood in the present moment is the experience theology describes\nthrough its category of revelation and understands as the\ndivine call to the human self; our experience of the ultimate goal we\nshare with other beings, which we anticipate as future, is the\nexperience theology describes through its category of\nredemption and understands as the vocation placed upon human\nbeings in the world by the divine.\n\n\nIn addition to denoting the narrow relation between God and the\nhuman self, \u201crevelation\u201d for Rosenzweig is the broad\numbrella concept which designates the theological insight which the new\nthinking takes as its lead: if one is to grasp beings as they are, if\none is to grasp truth in its unfolding in time, then one must grasp the\ntrajectory of the relations into which the three fundamental kinds of\nbeings enter spanning from creation to redemption. Revelation amounts\nto the \u201corientation\u201d after which the philosopher has long\nsought, according to Rosenzweig, because it shows the new thinker her\nplace and calling within that trajectory of relations.\n3. The Star of Redemption\n\n\nRosenzweig spent the last months of the war in and out of military\nhospitals for bouts of influenza, pneumonia, and malaria. At the end of\nAugust, 1918, he began writing The Star of Redemption and\nsending what he wrote back home to his mother on military postcards.\nAfter the war ended, he returned home first to Kassel, and then to\nFreiburg, devoting himself entirely to writing. He finished the\nStar in the middle of February, 1919.\n3.1 Overview\n\n\nRosenzweig understands The Star of Redemption as his\ncontribution to the \u201cnew thinking,\u201d and the book does\npolemicize against those systems of German Idealism in which Rosenzweig\nfinds the \u201cold thinking\u201d to be most fully realized. But the\nStar\u2019s post-Kantian metaphysical aspirations, its\nsystematic structure, and its dramatic scope recommend its comparison\nto the great systems of Schelling and Hegel more than to any other\nphilosophical work. Indeed, Rosenzweig insists in numerous contexts\nthat the Star be understood \u201conly as a system of\nphilosophy,\u201d that is, as committed to the very task of systematic\nthinking to which the German Idealists were committed. This tension\nbetween the systematic goals of the Star and\nRosenzweig\u2019s explicit call for a \u201cnew thinking\u201d that\nwould turn away from the assumptions and tendencies of the\nphilosophical tradition culminating in German Idealism has been the\nsource of considerable puzzlement among readers of the Star\nfrom Rosenzweig\u2019s own time down to the present. One might suggest\nthat Rosenzweig shares with the German Idealists the conviction that\nthe fundamental questions human beings ask\u2014including those\nquestions about the relationship between the individual self and the\nwhole of the world which perplexed Rosenzweig during his own personal\nand intellectual development\u2014can only find their grounded\nanswers within the context of a philosophical system. At the same time,\nhowever, Rosenzweig insists that the perennial philosophical quest for\n\u201cknowledge of the All\u201d can only reach its goals if\nphilosophy takes into consideration the insights of the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d regarding temporality, revelation, and the human\nbeing\u2019s fundamental individuality.\n\n\nThe Star is such a multi-faceted work, however, that\ngenerations of readers have discovered in it myriad philosophical\ninsights which far outspan its systematic aspirations. The book\u2019s\ninfluence on later Jewish thought and continental thought may well be\nsaid to rest far more heavily on the fruitfulness of some of those\nindividual insights in the book that appear to be decidedly\nanti-systematic, than on the book\u2019s own overall\ncommitment to systematicity. The book offers a rich account of the\ntemporal situatedness of the human being, and suggests that the\nactuality we experience can only be understood through the tenses of\npast, present, and future. It exemplifies the fusion of philosophy and\ntheology which the \u201cnew thinking\u201d is meant to realize; and\nits philosophical utilization of theological concepts like\n\u201ccreation,\u201d \u201crevelation,\u201d and\n\u201credemption,\u201d seeks both to aid philosophy in fulfilling\nits own 2500-year potential, and to answer those perennial questions of\nJewish and Christian theology that have perplexed religious thinkers\nthroughout the ages. The Star works out its own aesthetics and\nhistory of art. Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Star\nis its formulation of a \u201cspeech-thinking,\u201d which presents\nlanguage as the \u201corganon\u201d through which the unifying\nrelations between beings occur and can be understood. At the center of\nthis speech-thinking is a philosophy of dialogue which traces the\nawakening of selfhood through an I-You relation into which the self is\ncalled by the Absolute other. The book introduces a form of dialectical\nlogic meant to rival Hegel\u2019s. It offers a series of\ninterpretations of Biblical texts meant to evoke the uniqueness of the\nBible as a written text which nevertheless makes it possible to hear\nthe divine word. The Star presents Judaism and Christianity as\ncommunal forms whose institutions and liturgical calendar enable human\nbeings to bring eternity into time. And the book includes within it a\nsweeping history of religion and philosophy, politics and culture, from\nancient times to the present. In short, much like the systems of German\nIdealism, the Star offers the reader numerous points of\naccess; but all these points of access are meant to hold together\nwithin a single overarching vision of truth and the path to it.\n\n\nRosenzweig understands the task of system to entail grasping and\narticulating \u201cthe All\u201d\u2014the whole of what is\u2014in\nits identity and difference, that is, as both a single unity and as\nthe most comprehensive diversity of particulars. While he sees the\nquest for knowledge of the All as rooted in the early questions of the\npre-Socratics, he identifies the German Idealists as those who\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d system as the explicit overarching task of\nphilosophy. Committed as Rosenzweig remains, in the Star, to\nthis systematic task, he breaks from German Idealism perhaps most\ndramatically in the standpoint out of which he insists systematic\nknowledge is to be attained. In the systems of German Idealism, the\nphilosopher seeks to attain the standpoint of the Absolute\u2014the\nvery Absolute out of which all particular beings are understood to\nhave unfolded dialectically. According to Rosenzweig, such Absolute\nIdealism fails to grasp particulars in their particularity, because it\nassumes the fundamental unity of all particulars within the Absolute\nfrom the start. In contrast, Rosenzweig seeks to grasp the\n\u201cAll\u201d, in the Star, not from an Absolute\nstandpoint, but rather from the standpoint of the finite individual\nhuman being whom he finds situated\nin the middle of the course of the All, a course Rosenzweig\nunderstands as beginning in particularity, and advancing through the\nrelations between particulars to an ultimate redemptive realization of\nunity. One may read the very first sentence of\nthe Star\u2014\u201cAll knowing of the All begins in death,\nthe fear of death\u201d\u2014as a programmatic announcement of\nRosenzweig\u2019s basic quarrel with German Idealism over the standpoint\nout of which systematic knowledge may be attained: an Absolute\nstandpoint that claims to overcome the limits of human finitude will\nnot yield true knowledge of the All. Only a proper recognition of the\nunique character of the individual mortal human being holds the\npromise for systematic knowledge.\n\n\nThe Star is a disorienting work in many ways. Keeping in mind\nthe overall structure of the book can do much to help keep the reader\nfrom getting lost while reading it. The Star is divided into\nthree parts, each of which is itself divided into three\n\u201cbooks\u201d and includes, as well, both an introductory\nchapter presenting the particular sort of shift in thinking Rosenzweig\nwants to achieve through the books of that part, and a transitional\nchapter that prepares the reader to move on to what comes next. The\nthree books of the first part of the Star present\nphilosophical constructions of what Rosenzweig asserts to be the three\nfundamental kinds of beings\u2014God, world, self\u2014as\nthe elements out of which the system will be realized. The\nthree books of the second part introduce the course along\nwhich God, world, and self enter into relations among themselves that\nadvance towards unity, relations Rosenzweig denotes through the\ntheological notions of creation, revelation, and redemption. The third\npart of the book inquires into the possibility of envisioning\nthat figure of the star, in its redemptive unity, whose\nconstruction out of the elements along their course the reader has\nfollowed in the first and second parts of the book. The Star\nends with a depiction of what is seen in this vision\u2014God\u2019s face\nin the form of the star of redemption\u2014and then guides\nthe reader out from the setting of such vision back into everyday\nlife.\n3.2 Part I\n\n\nRosenzweig begins the Star with a reflection on human\nmortality, and his consideration of the irreducible uniqueness of the\nindividual revealed in death precipitates the break-up of the\n\u201cAll\u201d, which philosophy has long claimed to know, into what\nRosenzweig takes to be the three fundamental\u2014and fundamentally\nindependent\u2014kinds of beings: God, world, and self. Moreover,\nthe insights Rosenzweig draws from the human fear of death in the\nopening pages of the Star serve to direct him in his own quest\nfor knowledge of the \u201ctrue All\u201d that has eluded the\n\u201cold thinking\u201d of the philosophical tradition. The most\nimportant of these insights are the following:\n\n\nRosenzweig locates in the fear of death the source of the\nawareness of the basic split between selfhood and worldliness which\nhad perplexed him at least since his university years. In the fear of\ndeath, Rosenzweig claims, in the opening paragraphs of\nthe Star, the human being experiences her own \u201ctornness\nfrom the whole world\u201d. She is confronted with the fact that her\n\u201cI would be an \u2018it\u2019\u201d if she died. As\nthe Star proceeds along its course, Rosenzweig will both\noffer an account of this split the human being experiences, and show\nhow the reconciliation of selfhood and worldliness will only come with\nthe completion of the \u201cAll\u201d in redemption.\n\nIn serious contemplation of death, Rosenzweig suggests, one\nexperiences nothingness in a particular, and particularly\nimmediate fashion. The human being is set \u201cface-to-face with the\nNothing\u201d in the fear of death. Death shows the human being the\n\u201cunthinkable annihilation\n[Vernichtung\u2014i.e., the\nmaking-into-Nothing, or nothing-ing]\u201d of her\n\u201cI\u201d. The fear of death thus compels the human being to\nrecognize the extent to which her self or \u201cI\u201d is not at\nall securely self-grounded or absolute, but rather is ever suspended\nin nothingness. Moreover, Rosenzweig devotes considerable attention to\nthe particular quality of the nothingness experienced in the\nfear of death. I do not experience nothingness as a universal or\nabsolute state in the fear of death, Rosenzweig suggests, but rather I\nexperience my nothingness\u2014I experience nothingness as\na particular \u201csomething\u201d that threatens me and me\nalone.\n\n\n\nThe particularity of nothingness over which the human being hovers\nin the fear of death leads Rosenzweig to critique the starting points\nof the systems of German Idealism and to suggest his own alternative to\nthem. German Idealist systems\u2014and here Rosenzweig alludes to\nvarious sources in the writings of Schelling and Hegel\u2014conceive\nof the absolute ground of \u201cthe All\u201d as an undifferentiated,\n\u201corphic unity,\u201d out of which the differentiated reality we\nexperience unfolds dialectically. Armed with the particular character\nof nothingness drawn from the experience of the fear of death,\nRosenzweig suggests that the German Idealists \u201cpresuppose\u201d\nthe undifferentiated, universal character of the Absolute, as the\norigin of the \u201cAll,\u201d and they thereby mistakenly root the\nmyriad particular beings we experience in actuality in an original\nunity (i.e., an absolute or universal \u201cnothing\u201d). However,\nRosenzweig reasons, particulars that are ultimately the dialectical\nproduct of absolute unity cannot be said to be particulars at\nall. And thus the systems of German Idealism do not in fact attain or\narticulate knowledge of the identity and difference of\n\u201cAll\u201d that is; rather, they reduce the unique\ndifference inherent to the different kinds of particular beings to a\ncommon unity.\n\n\nThe particularity of nothingness experienced in the fear of death thus\nleads Rosenzweig to take up a starting point in difference. Every\nparticular kind of being must be taken up as derived from its own\nparticular nothing, rather than as rooted ultimately in a common\nunity.  Censuring the tendency of the philosophical tradition, once\nagain, to reduce the three domains of special metaphysics one to the\nother\u2014to reduce selfhood and world to manifestations of the\ndivine, or the divine and the self to aspects of the cosmos, or the\ndivine and the external world to products of the human\nmind\u2014Rosenzweig takes up each of these three different kinds of\nbeings as having generated itself out of its own particular\nnothing.\n\n\nTaking its lead from the particularity of nothing revealed in the\nfear of death, the first part of the Star thus begins by\nconstructing the particular respective being of God, world, and self\neach out of its own particular nothing. While Rosenzweig insists on the\nfundamentally independent natures of these kinds of being, the method\nby which he traces each\u2019s self-generation out of its particular\nnothing is the same. God, world, and self each emerges as an\nelement in Rosenzweig\u2019s system through a process in\nwhich Rosenzweig depicts two paths leading out of each particular\nnothing and arriving at a point of unity. The two paths that Rosenzweig\ntraces out of each particular nothing are as follows: 1) the path from\nout of the particular nothing driven by the affirmation of\nwhat is \u201cnot-nothing.\u201d Rosenzweig identifies this path as\nthe path of the \u201cYes.\u201d 2) the path from out of the\nparticular nothing driven by the negation of that very\nnothing. Rosenzweig identifies this path as that of the\n\u201cNo.\u201d These two paths then come to a unity in what\nRosenzweig refers to as the \u201cAnd\u201d of \u201cYes\u201d and\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nRosenzweig claims that he models his method for constructing the\nelements of the Star on the mathematical notion of a\ndifferential. (The differential models for Rosenzweig the possibility\nof generating something from nothing\u2014when that nothing is a\ndeterminate nothing, rather than a nothing conceived as absolute.) But\nin order to make sense of what Rosenzweig aims to achieve through his\nconstructions of the elemental God, world, and self in the first part\nof the Star, it is helpful to consider the kinds of qualities\nRosenzweig identifies with the affirmative and negative paths,\nrespectively, which emerge out of each particular nothing and merge\ntogether in each respective element. In Rosenzweig\u2019s\nconstruction, the affirmation of what is not-nothing within each\nelement (\u201cYes\u201d) always corresponds to a certain quality of\n\u201csubstantiality\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d attributed to that\nelement, while the negation of nothing within each element\n(\u201cNo\u201d) always corresponds to an \u201cactive\u201d\nquality attributed to the element. Thus it is infinite being (Yes) and\nfreedom (No) which fuse together in the self-generation of the\nelemental God; the presence of logos (Yes) and the vital plenitude of\nparticulars (No) that fuse together to form the elemental world;\nenduring character (Yes) and free will (No) that unite within the\nelemental self.\n\n\nIf thus Hegel famously insisted that truth be grasped \u201cnot only\nas substance, but equally as subject,\u201d Rosenzweig asserts that\nthe realization of this same kind of identity of substantiality and\nactivity is necessary to allow each of the elements to generate itself\nout of its nothing. Rosenzweig in fact devotes considerable time over\nthe course of the first part of the Star to demonstrating\nthat only those beings which construct themselves out of the\nunification of the dual paths of substantiality and activity, of\n\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d can hold themselves out of\ntheir respective nothings. Rosenzweig sees in this two-poled structure\nof each being its inherent \u201cfactuality.\u201d Indeed, he\nhighlights the way the German word for fact\nitself\u2014Tatsache\u2014brings together \u201cact\u201d\n(Tat) and \u201csubstantiality\u201d or\n\u201cmatter\u201d (Sache). Rosenzweig writes, \u201cNot\nthe substance [Sache], not the act [Tat], only the\nfact [Tatsache] is secure from falling back into the\nnothing,\u201d thereby indicating that only by emerging as the fusion\nof an active and substantial pole, can God, world, and the self gain a\nstanding in being each over against its respective nothing.\n\n\nThus eschewing the tendency of the philosophical tradition to root\nall beings in a single, unconditioned ground, Rosenzweig begins the\nStar by showing how all particular beings\u2014divine,\nworldly, personal\u2014can be understood as generating themselves\neach out of its own particular nothing. But throughout the first part\nof the Star, these constructions of the elemental God, world,\nand self remain \u201chypothetical.\u201d Rosenzweig suggests that\none only attains \u201ccertainty\u201d regarding these constructions\nwhen they are shown to be the necessary conditions for the actuality we\nexperience. As Rosenzweig proceeds to argue, in the second part of the\nStar, the actuality we experience is born of the\nrelations between God, world, and selves. That is to\nsay, the actuality we experience is not to be understood as rooted in\nan original metaphysical unity, but rather in the relations between\nparticulars each of which generates itself out of its own nothing.\nMoreover, Rosenzweig proceeds to show that in entering into the\nreciprocal relations with one another which ground our experience,\nelemental beings take steps towards the ultimate systematic unification\nof the \u201cAll\u201d.\n3.3 Part II\n\n\nThe second part of the Star introduces theology as\ncomplement to philosophy: here the theological \u201ccategories\u201d\nof creation, revelation, and redemption are shown to\n\u201cfulfill\u201d what is promised in the philosophical\nconstructions of God, world, and self from the book\u2019s first part.\nThis fulfillment occurs through the \u201ccourse\u201d along which\nthe elemental God, world, and self step into relations with one\nanother, relations that form the actuality we experience. Rosenzweig\ndesignates the divine turning into relation with the world as\ncreation; the divine turning into relation with the individual\nself as revelation; and the turning of the self into loving\nrelation with the world as redemption. How we are to\nunderstand the beginning of this chain of relations\u2014i.e.,\nwhy the divine \u201ccreates\u201d the world\u2014is an\nopen question among scholars, and some claim that Rosenzweig intends\nthe original turning of the divine to the world, and to the self,\nrespectively, to be grasped as acts of will or love inexplicable by\nphilosophical means. But Rosenzweig also makes it clear that particular\nbeings need to step into relations with one another precisely\nin order to realize themselves as what they are. God does not\nactually become the God he is elementally until he realizes\ndivine freedom in the grounding of the existence of the world in\ncreation, and until he receives human recognition for his divine being\nthrough revelation. The world does not actually become the\nworld it is elementally until it receives its essential grounding from\nthe divine in creation, and until its particulars attain to their own\nvital self-determination in redemption. The self does not\nactually become what it is elementally until it is awoken to\nits free I-hood through revelation, and until it realizes its freedom\nin its turning in love to the world in redemption.\n\n\nNow, in order for each element to fulfill itself through its\nrelations to its others, Rosenzweig asserts, each must undergo a\ncertain transformation. Rosenzweig here draws methodological\nconsequences from the very notion of revelation itself. The German for\nrevelation, Offenbarung, suggests that every being must\nundergo a kind of \u201copening up\u201d in turning into the\nrelations with others that revelation entails. Such opening up\nand turning outward demands what Rosenzweig calls a\n\u201creversal\u201d [Umkehr] of the \u201cYes\u201d and\nthe \u201cNo\u201d which united within each isolated element. What\nwas the \u201cYes\u201d pole within a given elements (i.e., its\nsubstantial pole) reverses into a \u201cNo\u201d (i.e., activity),\nand what was the \u201cNo\u201d pole within the element reverses into\na \u201cYes\u201d. Relations between elements are constituted, then,\nwhen, e.g., the \u201cNo\u201d pole within a given element reverses\ninto a \u201cYes\u201d and then unites up with what had been the\n\u201cYes\u201d pole within another element, now reversed into a\n\u201cNo\u201d. To give an example: creation demands that\nthe active, free pole of God (\u201cNo\u201d) reverse itself into the\nsubstantial grounding (\u201cYes\u201d) of the existence of the world\n(\u201cNo\u201d) which itself emerged out of the reversal of the\nessential pole (\u201cYes\u201d) within the elemental world. The\nunion of divine \u201cYes\u201d and worldly \u201cNo\u201d forged\nin creation, then, attains the same \u201cfactual\u201d character as\nrelation as did the union of \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d\nwithin each element: creation is a fact\u2014a\n\u201cTatsache\u201d\u2014according to Rosenzweig, insofar as it\nresults from the unifying relation between the being of the divine\ncreator (\u201cSache\u201d) and the active existence\n(\u201cTat\u201d) of the world\n\n\nRosenzweig devotes great care to demonstrating that the elemental\nbeings fulfill themselves through their reversals into relations with\ntheir others. But over the course of the second part of the\nStar, Rosenzweig proceeds to show that while God, world, and\nself realize themselves as the beings that they are by entering into\nthese reciprocal relations, this very course of\nrelations\u2014creation, revelation, redemption\u2014will at once\nlead them to realize the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d. Indeed,\nthe Star locates the unity, posited by the German Idealists\nat the beginning of their systems, in the\nredemptive conclusion of its systematic course. And\nRosenzweig can claim to have articulated the \u201cAll\u201d in both\nits identity and difference within his system because the very course\nof relations that leads particulars to form the unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d at once permits each particular to realize itself as\nparticular.\n\n\nThe course God, world, and self take into relations through the\nsecond part of the Star, according to Rosenzweig, generates\nthe actuality which we experience. Indeed, as indicated in the\n\u201cNew Thinking\u201d section above, Rosenzweig aims to show that\nwe have access to these relations of creation, revelation, and\nredemption, through the quintessentially temporal quality of our\nexperience. We experience the world we inhabit as\n\u201calready-there\u201d from the moment we become aware of it, and\nthis experience of the world as our past, Rosenzweig contends,\nis an experience of creation. Each of us experiences her own\nawakening to free selfhood as an experience that is quintessentially\npresent; it is none other than this experience of awakening to\nfree selfhood which Rosenzweig understands as our experience of\nrevelation. Finally, we experience our opening up into loving relations\nwith others in the world, and the possibilities such relations\ngenerate, through the prism of the future; and it is through\nthis future-directed experience that we anticipate\nredemption.\n\n\nRosenzweig draws important epistemological consequences from the\nfact that we can be shown to experience the relations of creation,\nrevelation, and redemption that occur between God, world, and self. He\nasserts that the fact that we have access through experience\nto the relations between those elements whose construction we traced\nthrough thought, offers us evidence for the credibility of\nthose very constructions. Rosenzweig suggests that the relationship\nbetween the thought of the first part of the Star and the\nexperience of the second part of the Star should be understood\nas one of promise and fulfillment; and he understands himself to be\nbringing together philosophy and theology in this very relation. For as\nthe elements constructed in the first part of the Star are\nshown to realize themselves, to fulfill their elemental potential\nthrough the theological relations of creation, revelation, and\nredemption, in the book\u2019s second part, Rosenzweig can claim to\nhave shown that philosophy finds its abstract constructs realized in\ntheology\u2019s account of actuality, and that theology finds the\nconditions for the possibility of its account of actuality in the\nconstructs of philosophy. It is this very reciprocally-confirming\nrelationship between philosophy and theology that Rosenzweig believes\nexemplifies the \u201cnew thinking.\u201d\n\n\nMuch as it was in his earlier thinking, the central theological\nconcept here in the second part of the Star is revelation. In\nRosenzweig\u2019s earliest formulations, revelation denotes the\nturning of the absolute other into relation with the human self in the\nworld, a relation through which the human self orients herself in the\nworld. In the Star, this same relation occurs in the midst of\na nexus of relations between beings, and it does indeed orient the\nhuman being who receives revelation within this nexus of relations.\nAware of herself as having been born into the world, awakening to her own\nfree selfhood, the human being is called on to enter into those\nrelations with others in the world that will realize the redemptive\nunity of the \u201cAll.\u201d Insofar as this unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d is anticipated as future, moreover, its\nrealization may be said to depend on human beings taking up the\nvocation they become aware of in revelation. The systematic unity of\nthe \u201cAll\u201d Rosenzweig seeks to know in the present,\nremains a possibility to be actualized. And Rosenzweig understands\nrevelation to orient the human being towards this actualization.\n3.4 Speech-Thinking\n\n\nThe second part of the Star is also home to\nRosenzweig\u2019s account of \u201cspeech-thinking,\u201d the\ncenterpiece of his contribution to the \u201cnew thinking\u201d in\nthe Star. Here Rosenzweig understands himself to be working\nout a form of the \u201cnarrative\u201d or \u201chistorical\u201d\nthinking which Schelling described, in the preface to his Ages of\nthe World, as the necessary complement to the philosophy of\nreason. Rosenzweig presents speech as more deeply linked to temporal\nexperience than is rational thought, and hence as a tool eminently\ncapable of grasping and articulating the relations of creation,\nrevelation, and redemption which we experience in time. We express our\nexperience of time through the tenses of language. We grasp the things\nof the world through our naming of them and in the stories we tell\nabout them. I articulate my own selfhood by calling myself\n\u201cI\u201d, and I experience my most intimate personal\nrelationships through a personal address to others as\n\u201cYou,\u201d or through calling them by their first names. In\nsong, moreover, Rosenzweig suggests we have a form of speech in which\nwe articulate the supreme hopes we anticipate for our future.\n\n\nIn the second part of the Star, Rosenzweig suggests that we\ncan grasp through speech the relations into which God, world, and the\nself enter, first and foremost, because speech in fact accompanies the\nwhole of the course that leads from creation to redemption. As that\nwhich makes us human, Rosenzweig claims, the power of speech is\nimplicit in every human being since creation; and yet the complete\nfulfillment of speech in a universal language that would be equally\neach person\u2019s own and at once common to all, can only be imagined\nas part of the redemptive future of humankind. In between creation and\nredemption, language both unites and divides people from one another:\nwe all share speech, but speech is different in every mouth. Within the\ncourse of the systematic relations between God, world, and self that\nstretches from creation to redemption, Rosenzweig thus understands\nlanguage as a tool of unification that does not reduce different\nindividuals to that which is the same: speech only unites those who\nrecognize or understand each other.\n\n\nRosenzweig thus views speech as the unifying thread whose genesis\naccompanies the relational advance of God, world, and self from\ncreation through revelation to redemption, and thus as an\n\u201corganon\u201d at our disposal for grasping these relations.\nEach step in the genesis of speech accompanies one of the relations we\nexperience along the path God, world, and self take towards their\nultimate unification in the \u201cAll.\u201d Rosenzweig presents the\ngeneration of the grammatical building blocks of narrative as\nintegral to creation, the relation between God and the world which we\nexperience as past. He presents the revelatory relation between God and\nthe self as a dialogue between an \u201cI\u201d and a\n\u201cYou\u201d always experienced as present; and he shows how\nboth the divine \u201cI\u201d and the self as\n\u201cYou,\u201d are constituted as such through such reciprocal\ndialogic exchange. And Rosenzweig depicts the redemptive bringing\ntogether of the worldly objects of narrative and the persons of\ndialogue in the communal song that anticipates the ultimate\nunity of redemption.\n\n\nThe speech-thinking of the second part of the Star seeks to\nshow that relations between particular beings are best grasped through\nspeech. But more importantly, Rosenzweig demonstrates in his\n\u201cspeech thinking\u201d that these relations occur\nthrough speech. Speech, Rosenzweig suggests, is the tool through which\nwe come to recognize ourselves as selves, and which at once unites us\nwith others along our path towards redemption. Speech, for Rosenzweig,\nis thus not only a tool for grasping relations. It is a tool for\nrealizing the path to the \u201cAll\u201d through relations.\n\n\nBy the end of the second part of the Star, Rosenzweig has\nset forth the course of his system, along which particular beings enter\ninto relations that will ultimately bring about their unification\nwithin the \u201cAll.\u201d Rosenzweig celebrates this achievement,\nat the end of the book\u2019s second part, by presenting the reader\nwith the geometric image that he suggests is constructed out of the\nelements in their relations. Depicting God, world, and self as three\npoints equidistant from one another, he shows, yields a single\ntriangle. The relations between each of the elements, furthermore,\nsuggest three further points, each one between those two elements which\nunite through it. The image befitting the system, Rosenzweig thereby\nproclaims, is not the \u201ccircle\u201d which has steered\nphilosophical thinking from Anaximander to Hegel, but rather the\nsix-pointed star formed by the three elemental points coupled with the\nthree points of relation into which the elements enter: the star of\nredemption.\n\n\nBefore turning to survey the third and final part of the\nStar, we should note here the situation Rosenzweig\u2019s\nreader finds herself in by the time she arrives at the end of the\nsecond part of the book. By this point in the Star, the reader\nhas been asked to see herself as situated in the middle of the course\nleading to the unification of the \u201cAll\u201d. As a result, the\nbook directs a certain challenge to the reader to take up her role in\nthe systematic advance towards the redemptive unity which Rosenzweig\nenvisions. Because the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d is projected as\nfuture, that is, the reader is called on to do her part to realize in\nactuality the very system of the \u201cAll\u201d which she may come\nto know through reading the Star.\n3.5 Part III\n\n\nBut if the unity of the system is projected into the future, can it\ntruly be known in the present? The third part of the\nStar presents life within the Jewish and Christian religious\ncommunities as the surprising answer to this question. According to\nRosenzweig, life within these communities allows for the possibility of\n\u201canticipating\u201d the ultimate redemptive unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d. The social practices through which these communities\nconstitute themselves lay the groundwork for such communal\nanticipation. More significantly, the course of the Jewish and\nChristian liturgical calendars\u2014the yearly path along which\nJewish and Christian communities celebrate creation, revelation, and\nredemption, each in its own particular manner\u2014makes it\npossible, according to Rosenzweig, for members of these communities to\nenvision within time, the ultimate unity of the \u201cAll\u201d that\nwill only be actual in the future redemption. Judaism and Christianity\nare thus to be understood, according to Rosenzweig, as\n\u201cguarantees\u201d of that ultimate redemption. Life within\nJewish or Christian community enables the person who stands in the\nmiddle of the course of the \u201cAll\u201d to see the ultimate unity\ntowards which all particular beings strive through relations, and to\ntake her place within this course with confidence.\n\n\nBut even as they serve as \u201cguarantees\u201d of the future\nredemption, Judaism and Christianity also serve crucial roles,\naccording to Rosenzweig, in realizing the actual redemption in\nthe world. Here Rosenzweig introduces the conclusions he reached back\nin 1913 regarding the complementary roles Judaism and Christianity play\nin the world\u2019s advance towards redemption. The Jewish people\nanticipates the ultimate redemption of the world within the closed,\ncommunal life it forges out of its intimate experience of relation with\nthe divine. Christianity advances the cause of the actual\nredemption of the world, by uniting the globe through its message of\ndivine love. While Christianity thus takes up the historical task of\nguiding the world towards redemption, it would lose its way, according\nto Rosenzweig, if the Jewish people did not perpetually serve as\nreminder, through its own communal anticipation of redemption, of the\nkind of unity before the divine for which the world is to strive.\n\n\nAfter presenting the course of relations between God, world, and the\nself as directed towards the ultimate unification of the\n\u201cAll\u201d, then, Rosenzweig suggests that the ways in which\nJudaism and Christianity make it possible to anticipate the ultimate\nfuture unity of the \u201cAll\u201d itself, serve to bring the\nsystematic knowledge of the \u201cAll\u201d that is possible for\nhuman beings to its completion. In the \u201cGate\u201d section with\nwhich the Star ends, Rosenzweig depicts the vision of\nredemptive unity with which knowledge of the identity and difference of\nthe \u201cAll\u201d is completed, as a vision of the star of\nredemption, the same star Rosenzweig suggested was constructed\ngeometrically out of the elemental God, world, and self as they stepped\ninto the relations of creation, revelation, and redemption. In this\nimage of a star, Rosenzweig identifies the face of God. But he suggests\nthat seeing God\u2019s face at once directs those human beings who\npursue knowledge of the \u201cAll\u201d back into the domain of human\nfaces, into that nexus of interpersonal relations through which the\nredemptive unity of the All is to be achieved in actuality.\n\n\nRosenzweig sends his readers out of the \u201cGate\u201d at the\nend of the Star back \u201cinto life,\u201d directing them\nto take on the redemptive task of unifying the \u201cAll\u201d which\nthe book itself describes. Rosenzweig thereby ascribes to human beings\na noteworthy relationship to truth itself. The systematic truth\nrevealed in the Star is not a thing that one might claim to\nknow or to experience like other things in the world. Truth is the\nredemptive goal of a course in which human beings participate. As a\nresult, human beings stand, according to Rosenzweig, in a relationship\nof \u201cverification\u201d to truth itself. Human beings verify the\ntruth of the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d by taking up the task of\nits realization. It is the task of the readers of the Star,\nRosenzweig implies, to make the \u201ceveryday\u201d context of their\nlives reflect and take part in this advance towards redemptive\ntruth.\n\n\nThe ending of the Star also sends the reader\nback into life at a particular moment in history. Here one must note\nthat Rosenzweig saw his time in history as particularly momentous.\nThe culmination of the philosophical tradition in German Idealism, so\nRosenzweig contended, coincided with the ending of the second epoch of\nthe world\u2019s historical advance towards redemption under Christian\nauspices, and the beginning of its third and final historical epoch:\nthe founding of the Church of John which Schelling foretold in his\nPhilosophy of Revelation. Rosenzweig understood his own time\nto be that of the \u201cJohannine completion\u201d of historical\ntemporality, and he even saw in the battles and revolutions through\nwhich he wrote the Star evidence of the advance of world\nhistory towards its ultimate redemption.\n4. Life and Thought after The Star\n4.1 Lehrhaus\n\n\nIn the year after the war ended, as Rosenzweig prepared both the\nStar and his Hegel and the State for publication, he\nturned his attention back to some of those issues in Jewish education\nthat had occupied him during his exchanges with Hermann Cohen.\nEncouraged by a group of Jewish intellectuals in Frankfurt to join\ntheir efforts to establish a new institute for Jewish adult education,\nRosenzweig began to formulate a program for Jewish education for his\nassimilated Jewish contemporaries, Jews who were educated and\nsuccessful in a variety of fields but who were, for the most part,\n\u201camharatzim\u201d\u2014ignoramuses\u2014when it came to\nthe Jewish sources. Rosenzweig traced the challenges facing Jewish life\nin his time back to the emancipation, which had brought unimaginable\nfreedoms and opportunities to the Jews of Europe, but which had, at the\nsame time, severed the organic connection between Jewish life, on the\none hand, and Jewish study and practice, on the other, that had been\nthe signature of traditional Judaism. Those who fought against the\nassimilationist tide of the 19th Century and continued to\ndevote themselves to Jewish law, in Rosenzweig\u2019s eyes,\ntransformed the living Torah into a rigid set of laws and practices\nrequiring zealous obedience. In his own time, Rosenzweig thus claimed,\nneither the orthodox nor the liberal forms of Judaism set out a path of\nJewish study and practice that was livable. Rosenzweig\u2019s\neducational program made the re-discovery of one\u2019s own personal\nJewish life, or the renewed commitment to one\u2019s own Jewishness\nthe starting point of the path of Jewish learning, and thereby sought\nto ensure that whatever was learned, whatever practices were taken on,\nwould become part of a living Judaism.\n\n\nRosenzweig here brought certain Platonic insights regarding the\ndangers of enlightenment to bear on his program of Jewish education.\nHis goal, he claimed, was to make it possible for contemporary\n\u201chyphenated\u201d Jews to travel the path of return to Judaism\nwithout losing in the process all that had oriented them in their lives\nup to that point. Such an intent led him to assert, in a 1923 open\nletter to Martin Buber called \u201cThe Builders,\u201d that\nobserving particular laws and practices of the Torah and the Jewish\ntradition in his time had to be rooted in each individual Jew\u2019s\nability rather than in her will. Only that Jew who\nwas capable of hearing the divine voice of revelation speaking\nand commanding through a particular law or practice, could relate to\nsuch a law or practice as an integral, meaningful part of her Jewish\nlife, rather than as an obsolete ritual demanding rigid, rote\nobedience.\n\n\nThe institute for Jewish adult education which opened, under\nRosenzweig\u2019s leadership, in the fall of 1920, was called\n\u201cThe New Jewish Lehrhaus,\u201d and its name both\nlinked it to the traditional Jewish house of study, the \u201cBeit\nMidrash\u201d and, as \u201cnew\u201d, distanced itself from\ntraditional study at the same time. The Lehrhaus aimed to\nimplement, even in the form of instruction it adopted, the approach to\nJewish return Rosenzweig had formulated. It did so by doing away with\nthe usual distance in the classroom between teacher and students. In\nthe Lehrhaus, most teachers were intentionally not\nmasters of the subject they chose to teach; they did not come to the\nclassroom with answers, but saw themselves, rather, as engaged in a\nquestioning-in-common with their students. The job of the institute and\nits leader, Rosenzweig asserted, was to ensure the \u201cpedagogical\nfruitfulness of amhaaratzus [i.e., ignorance].\u201d Here the\nquestions that emerged naturally among thoughtful students who\nrecognized their own ignorance of Jewish sources, served to forge a\nliving and intellectually satisfying path of Jewish enlightenment.\n\n\nThe Lehrhaus attracted many of the leading, up-and-coming\nJewish intellectuals of Weimar Germany into its classrooms. In its\nearly years, Martin Buber, Eduard Strauss, Ernst Simon, Richard Koch,\nRudolf Hallo, and\u2014before his death\u2014Nehemiah Nobel, were\nheavily invested in the conceptual and practical development of the\ninstitute. Through the 1920s, the Lehrhaus enjoyed the\nparticipation of such notables and future notables as Siegfried\nKracauer, S.Y Agnon, Erich Fromm, Bertha Pappenheim, Gershom Scholem,\nLeo Strauss, and Leo Loewenthal.\n4.2 The Little Book of Healthy and Sick Understanding\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s turn from philosophy to life, after completing\nthe Star, was dramatic and remarkable. Although Rosenzweig\ncontinued to think and write after the Star, he engaged in\nvery little philosophical writing, traditionally\nconceived\u2014an indication of both his satisfaction with the way\nthe\nStar expressed what he had to say, and the seriousness of his\ncommitment to turn away from philosophical writing and towards Jewish\nlife after having completed it.\n\n\nThere are two exceptions to Rosenzweig\u2019s turn away from philosophy\nproper. In 1925, Rosenzweig wrote an essay, \u201cThe New\nThinking,\u201d that offered an overview of the systematic structure\nand insights of the Star and which situated the book within\nthe movement of the \u201cnew thinking\u201d to which Rosenzweig\nunderstood himself to have contributed. Moreover, in the summer of\n1921, the year the Star was published, Rosenzweig was\ncommissioned by the Frommann Publishing House to write a popular\nintroduction to his philosophy. He produced \u201cThe Little Book of\nHealthy and Sick Human Understanding,\u201d a title which puns on the\nGerman term for \u201ccommon sense,\u201d \u201cgesunder\nMenschenverstand,\u201d in order to imply that philosophy\nbecomes sick when it deviates from the insights of common\nsense. Rosenzweig ended up so dissatisfied with the book that he\nrefused to have it published, but Nahum Glatzer edited and published\nthe book some forty years after it was written, first in an English\ntranslation and subsequently in the German original. The \u201clittle\nbook\u201d is noteworthy for the story it tells about a person who\nbecomes paralyzed by philosophical questioning: he cannot walk for\nfear there is no real \u201cground\u201d; his eyes won\u2019t see for\nfear all is a dream; his hands won\u2019t grasp for lack of any ultimate\nreason to do so.  Rosenzweig explains this paralysis as a result of an\nunhealthy reaction\u2014characteristic of philosophy\u2014to the\nhuman experience of wonder. In moments of awareness of ourselves, of\nothers, of the world, we may be struck by wonder in the midst of\nlife. When we allow life to unfold in time, Rosenzweig suggests, such\nwonder is resolved on its own: those relations which are the source of\nour wonder become part and parcel of the actual life we live. But\nphilosophy, Rosenzweig claims, cannot wait for wonder to resolve\nitself in the course of life.  Moreover, in the way that it questions\nthe source of its wonder\u2014\u201cwhat is\nthis x?\u201d\u2014philosophy ends up removing itself, and\nthe source of its wonder, from the flow of life.  Any answers it\nthereby receives for its questions no longer correspond to the very\ncourse of actual life in which alone they would be meaningful.\n\n\nTreatment for such philosophical paralysis, Rosenzweig claims, is\nnot to be sought in the philosophical pursuit of grounds, but rather in\nan appeal to common sense. The \u201chealthy\u201d character of\ncommon sense, according to Rosenzweig, derives from its inherent trust\nin the flow of temporal life, and in the language we use to describe\nthe things and persons we encounter within it. Common sense does not\nask \u201cwhat\u201d things are, Rosenzweig suggests, not because it\nlacks curiosity, but because it recognizes implicitly that all things\nand persons we encounter in life are part of a course of development in\nwhich alone they realize themselves as \u201cwhat\u201d they are. The\npatient can only emerge from his paralysis, then, by turning away from\nthe pursuit of essential grounds and regaining that trust that allows\nhim to reclaim his place in the flow of everyday life.\n4.3 Illness\n\n\nIn the fall of 1921, less than a year into his directorship of the\nLehrhaus and\u2014eerily\u2014months after he wrote his\naccount of philosophical paralysis, Rosenzweig began to notice symptoms\nof a disturbance of the nervous system. In February of 1922 he was\ndiagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Rosenzweig\ncontinued to devote himself to directing and teaching in the\nLehrhaus, but already in the spring of 1922, his speech was\nsignificantly impaired and he experienced difficulty writing. At the\nend of the summer of 1922, Rudolf Hallo replaced Rosenzweig as the\ninstitute\u2019s director, although Rosenzweig remained intimately involved\nin the programmatic development of the Lehrhaus in the years\nthat followed. By the end of 1922, Rosenzweig could no longer write;\nhe remained able to communicate orally to his wife and to a few others\nclose to him\u2014and through these to others as well\u2014until the\nspring of 1923. At that time the Rosenzweigs purchased a special\ntypewriting machine which allowed Rosenzweig first to type, and then\nsimply to indicate, the letters (and later, the first letters) of the\nwords he wished to communicate, by using a lever to move a disk to the\ndesired letter. As Rosenzweig became further incapacitated, more and\nmore was demanded of his wife, Edith, who would regularly guess the\nword Rosenzweig wished to convey from Rosenzweig\u2019s indication of that\nword\u2019s first letter. Incredibly, this procedure allowed Rosenzweig not\nonly to continue to communicate with others in person, but to continue\n\u201cwriting\u201d as well up until the time of his death.\n4.4 Translation\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s most important intellectual and cultural\ncontribution during the years of his illness came in his work on\ntranslation. In the fall of 1922, his writing and speech already\nsignificantly impaired, Rosenzweig began drafting a book of\ntranslations of poems written by the medieval Jewish poet and thinker,\nJudah HaLevi. He finished the translations, together with commentaries\non each poem and an afterword outlining his views on the task of\ntranslation itself, in the first week of 1923, and the book was\npublished as Sixty Hymns and Poems of Judah HaLevi in 1924\n(an expanded edition, Ninety-two Hymns and Poems of Judah\nHaLevi, appeared in 1927). In May of 1925, Martin Buber invited\nRosenzweig to collaborate with him on a new German translation of the\nBible, and Rosenzweig devoted much of the last years of his life to\nthis project.\n\n\nIn both the \u201cAfterword\u201d to the Judah HaLevi\nbook, and in a series of articles addressing the challenges of\ntranslating Scripture, Rosenzweig articulated the theory of translation\nthat stood behind these works. According to Rosenzweig, the task of the\ntranslator was not to transform the text being translated into a form\nthat would be easily accessible to those reading it in its new\nlanguage, but rather to transform the language into which the text was\nbeing translated through this very introduction of a foreign text into\nit. Rosenzweig sought to convey precisely the unfamiliar character of\nthe original language in his translations because he saw such\ntranslation both as a means of rejuvenating the language into which the\nforeign text was translated, and\u2014more dramatically\u2014as a\nstep towards the ultimate redemptive harmonization of all\nlanguages.\n\n\nIn order to convey precisely the unfamiliar, authentic quality of\nthe original Biblical text, Rosenzweig and Buber made an effort to\nimitate certain characteristics of the original text not often attended\nto in translations seeking to convey the meaning of texts literally.\nThey attempted to reproduce the cadence of the original Biblical text,\nand to imitate what they understood to be its \u201cspoken\u201d\nquality, by dividing any given section they were translating into\n\u201cbreath-units.\u201d They paid special attention to the roots of\nthe words translated, imitating the repetition of words with common\nroots so regularly employed in the Biblical text, and often seeking to\nconvey the way such roots refer intertextually to other Biblical\npassages, as well. \n\n\nThe origins of Rosenzweig\u2019s thoughts on translating stretch back to\nthe speech-thinking he developed in the Star. In order to\nmake sense of the tremendous import with which he invests the act of\ntranslation, it is helpful to recall two aspects of that\nspeech-thinking in particular. First of all, the Star\nintroduces speech as a revelatory form of relation that unites\ndifferent individual beings\u2014divine, worldly, and\nhuman\u2014even as it secures them as individuals. In his writings on\ntranslation, Rosenzweig points back to this relational quality of\nspeech and discovers in it the very act of translation\nitself. \u201cAll speech,\u201d he writes, \u201cis\ntranslation.\u201d In every dialogue with another person, Rosenzweig\nsuggests, one engages in a miniature act of translation. Insofar as\nsuch relations contribute to my own self-realization, this very act of\ntranslating\u2014of being open to and cognizant of the words of\nsomeone \u201cforeign\u201d to me\u2014becomes an integral part of\nthe way I realize myself. The way in which the introduction of a\nforeign text into a language can enable that language to realize\nitself in new ways reproduces, then, on the level of whole languages,\nthe manner in which the individual comes to realize herself, according\nto Rosenzweig, through the act of translation involved in every\ninterpersonal exchange.\n\n\nFurthermore, insofar as the Star presents speech as part\nand parcel of the series of relations between beings that stretches,\nfor Rosenzweig, between creation and redemption, it depicts the\ndiversity of human languages as both rooted in the common capacity for\nspeech inherent in every human being from the time of her creation, and\nat once as destined to find common fulfillment in a redemptive\nuniversal language which all human beings would share. If this is the\ncase, then translation can be understood to revitalize or rejuvenate a\nlanguage, when introducing a foreign text into it, precisely because it\nthereby awakens within that language possibilities which that language\nalready has dormant within it, possibilities rooted in both the common\nground and the common future that language shares with all others.\nInsofar as translation can then be said to actualize, within each\nlanguage, an aspect of the ultimate universal language which all\nparticular languages share as their redemptive future, then translation\ncan be understood as playing a vital role in the world\u2019s advance\nto redemption which Rosenzweig projected in the Star.\n\n\nHere one should note the unique role Rosenzweig sees the Bible as\nfilling in the world\u2019s advance towards redemption. Rosenzweig\nunderstands the Bible to be that written work which, more than any\nother, has enabled human beings to hear the spoken divine word, and\nthereby has directed them towards a common, redemptive purpose in the\nworld. According to Rosenzweig, the translation of the Bible into a new\nlanguage, or for a new generation, serves to usher the people who speak\nthat language, or who are part of that generation, into this\nworld-historical advance towards redemption. Rosenzweig may thus\nunderstand his own act of translating the Bible as playing its own\nsmall part in this quest for redemption, and for the harmonization of\nall languages which would announce it.\n4.5 Davos: Cohen, Cassirer, Heidegger\n\n\nRosenzweig died on December 10, 1929. Seven months before his death,\nin May of 1929, Rosenzweig had written a short essay, \u201cTransposed\nFronts,\u201d occasioned by the coincidence of two events: the recent\nsecond issuing of Hermann Cohen\u2019s Religion of Reason out of\nthe Sources of Judaism, and the celebrated disputation held at\nDavos, in March-April of that year, between Ernst Cassirer and Martin\nHeidegger. Rosenzweig\u2019s essay claims that a consideration of the\nDavos exchange in the light of Cohen\u2019s late work suggests,\nsurprisingly, that it is not Cassirer, Cohen\u2019s disciple, but\nrather Heidegger, the heir to Cohen\u2019s position of prominence at\nMarburg, who carries on in the direction of Cohen\u2019s most\nsignificant contribution to the thought of the time. Rosenzweig\u2019s\nlate essay is important, moreover, for the way it shows Rosenzweig,\nshortly before his death, reflecting on contemporary philosophical\ndevelopments and trying to situate such developments within the context\nof, or in relation to, his own \u201cnew thinking\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cTransposed Fronts\u201d repeats the controversial claim\nRosenzweig had made in his 1924 \u201cIntroduction\u201d to Hermann\nCohen\u2019s Jewish Writings: the notion of\n\u201ccorrelation\u201d which Cohen develops in his late work amounts\nto a break from the critical Idealism which had made him the center of\nMarburg neo-Kantianism, and an advance into the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d espoused by Rosenzweig\u2019s circle. Cohen\u2019s\ncritical idealism, Rosenzweig had asserted in his\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d took \u201cnature\u201d and\n\u201chumanity\u201d to be products of reason in its\ntheoretical and practical domains, and it thus remained exemplary of\nthe tendency of the \u201cold thinking\u201d to root all that is in a\nsingle Absolute ground. But the notion of \u201ccorrelation\u201d\nwhich Cohen develops, in his Religion of Reason in particular,\nportrays reason not as generative of its objects, but rather as the\nmedium through which God and human being, posited as irreducibly\nfactual beings, step into reciprocal relation.\n\n\nThe irony of the Davos disputation, Rosenzweig suggests, is that\nCohen\u2019s actual disciple, Cassirer, proves himself still mired in\nthe \u201cold thinking\u201d of Cohen\u2019s early work, while\nHeidegger, the apparent usurper of the Marburg stage upon which Cohen\nmade his name, turns out to be more true to Cohen\u2019s decisive\nphilosophical contribution. Indeed, Rosenzweig suggests that\nCohen\u2019s notion of \u201ccorrelation\u201d leads the way to\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201cleap into Dasein.\u201d Heidegger\u2019s\nsense that the task of philosophy is to uncover for the\n\u201cfinite\u201d human being the \u201cnothingness\u201d wrapped\nup in her freedom, rather than to posit an Absolute being as her\nground, makes him the proper heir indeed to Cohen\u2019s late\ndiscovery of the irreducibility of the individual being standing in\ncorrelation with the divine. It thereby stamps Heidegger\u2019s\nthought as kin to the very \u201cnew thinking\u201d whose crowning\nrepresentative Rosenzweig himself was. \n",
