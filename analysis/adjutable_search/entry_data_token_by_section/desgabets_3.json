    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Truth\n\nAccording to Desgabets, Descartes\u2019s fine doctrine concerning the\ncreation of the eternal truths, is the foundation of the true\n(Cartesian) philosophy. He claimed that had Descartes attended\nconsistently to this doctrine, he would have avoided all error. Due to\nits importance and opaqueness in Desgabets\u2019s writings, the\n\u201cCreation Doctrine\u201d has generated a great deal of\nexamination and debate, most recently stimulated by Beaude\u2019s and\nRodis-Lewis\u2019s publication of Desgabets\u2019s philosophical\nwritings (Desgabets, 1981). Rodis Lewis (1981) and Lennon (1998) set\nthe stage for the dialectic of the debates in the period. Schmaltz\n(2002), Cook (2005), Faye (2005), and Easton (2009) variously argue\nfor the importance of the doctrine in Desgabets\u2019s development of\nthe Cartesian philosophy, and its philosophical significance. Gatto\n(2017) presents a nice synthesis of the literature and sorts out the\ncomplicated reception and role of Descartes\u2019s doctrine,\nparticularly for Desgabets. Despite the controversies surrounding the\ninterpretation and significance of this doctrine, there are some\npoints of agreement. As Desgabets understood it, the Creation Doctrine\nrequires that God be equally the author of all created things, in\ntheir being and their essence. It requires that there be no essence\nwithout existence, which is to say, that there can be no purely\npossible beings either in the human mind as Descartes allowed, or in\nGod\u2019s mind, as Malebranche argued. The notion that such truths\nare in some way prior to God\u2019s creation of the world, existing\nas purely possible essences separate from actual existence, involves a\nseparation of essence from existence, and supposes that essence is\nsomething actually separable and conceivable without existence.\n\nTruth, which exists only by the relation of conformity of thought to\nits object, is contingent in that it depends on God\u2019s will in\nhis free creation of the universe. Truth is eternal in its\nindependence from time or temporal variations, and it is immutable in\nthat once God wills the world, things never change in respect to their\nsubstance but only in respect to their modes of being. Although we\nmust wait to know what things God actually created, we are guaranteed\nof the truth of our ideas since it is the object itself that\ndetermines what we perceive. Truth is necessary in that God gives all\nobjects He creates an irrevocable being, but it is contingent in\nrelation to His absolute and unlimited power. God is the equal author\nof the essence and the existence of things He created, He\n\u201c\u2026 gave them their essence and their existence which are\nequally contingent, and which once received, are nevertheless\npossessed by them irrevocably\u201d (OPD 6, 249). Desgabets\u2019s\nvoluntarism, then, is a qualified one, for though the eternal truths\ndepend upon God for their existence as their primary cause, they are\nno less indefectible, that is, they are unchangeable in their\nsubstantial being. Moreover, eternal truths discovered by us are true\nand necessary since God chose to create things in such a way that once\ncreated his will could not be undone.\n\nThe tenets that Desgabets drew from the Creation Doctrine show us\nwhere Desgabets parts ways with Descartes on many points. For example,\nDescartes erroneously concludes in Meditation V that essences, such as\nthe true and immutable nature of a triangle, can exist separately from\nmaterial existence as a purely possible being. According to\nDesgabets\u2019s strict adherence to the Creation Doctrine,\n\u201c\u2026 objects precede truth in the order of nature,\u201d\nsuch that, \u201c\u2026 it is impossible that there be a triangle\nseparate from its existence, or that the whole be greater than its\npart if there is no whole or parts, which is to say in a word, that\nour principle is found yet more true, and it is impossible to think of\nnothing\u201d (OPD 6, 232). The Creation Doctrine also grounds\nDesgabets\u2019s treatment of the senses as the foundation of all\nknowledge, and his view that the substances are indefectible. Although\nat times elusive, the unity of Desgabets\u2019s thought can be seen\nin his defense of the Creation Doctrine.\n\nTo conclude, when we view Desgabets\u2019s work as a whole, there is\nno doubt that what he viewed as a revision or perfection of the\nCartesian philosophy others have viewed as a fundamental departure. In\nhis favor, he never strayed from the Cartesian metaphysics of\nsubstance dualism, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and\ninteraction, and the view that extension is the essence of matter and\nthought the essence of mind. He remained loyal to the Cartesian\nphysics against the atomists. Moreover, and perhaps heretically to\nsome, he strongly rejected the rationalist epistemology which often\ndominates in Descartes, and argued that Descartes\u2019s own\nprinciples favor a sensory foundation for knowledge. By\nDesgabets\u2019s own lights, he remained loyal to the Cartesian\nprinciples: \u201cI will establish his reputation upon eternal\nfoundations by giving his philosophy its expected reputation. For, it\nhas to be known that his philosophy, once purged of certain errors and\nhaving received the vast scope possible to it, must pass for the\nmasterpiece of the human spirit, and for what is the greatest of its\nkind in the world\u201d (OPD 5, 152).\n",
