    "main_text": "Instrumental Coherence || Independent Requirements of Reason\n3.1 Independent Requirements of Reason\n\nOne answer is that when one is instrumentally incoherent one violates\nsome independent requirement of reason. That is, either one\nhas some specific attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nthat one ought not to have or one lacks some\nspecific attitude (or pattern of attitudes) that one ought to have.\nThe source of the problem, according to this answer, is not\nthat when one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates some\nrequirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.\nThe source of the problem is instead that when one is instrumentally\nincoherent, then it is guaranteed that one\u2019s having (or lacking)\none attitude (or pattern of attitudes) violates some\nindependent requirement of reason. (See Kolodny 2007b, 2008a;\nKiesewetter 2017, esp. Ch. 10; Lord 2018, esp. Ch. 2. For criticism,\nsee Brunero 2020, Ch. 4; Fogal and Worsnip 2021; Worsnip 2021, Ch. 3,\nLee 2021.)\n\nCertainly, this can happen in some cases, at least accidentally.\nSuppose our madman intends to start World War III, believes that he\nwill start World War III only if he intends to launch a nuclear\nmissile, but refuses to intend to launch a nuclear missile. The\nViolation Claim might be explained in this case by pointing out that,\nwhatever his other attitudes may be, he ought not to have the\nintention to start World War III, but does have that intention. But\nwhy should we suppose that, in general, whenever one has an\ninstrumentally incoherent set, one either has an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought not to have, or lacks an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought to have?\n\nThis would be so, in general, if the following were the case:\n\nOught Pattern 1:\nIn any situation, either\n\n\none ought not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends to M, or\none ought not to intend to E, or\none ought to intend to M.\n \n\n\nIt would also be so, in general, if the following were the case:\n\nOught Pattern 2:\nIn any situation, either\n\n\none ought not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends to M, or\nwhatever pattern of intention one ought to have, it is not one\nintends to E and does not intend to M; i.e.,\neither\n\n\none ought not to intend to E and not to intend to\nM, or\none ought not to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and not to intend\nto M or not to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and not to intend\nto M or to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and to intend to\nM or to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and to not to\nintend to M or not to intend to E and to\nintend to M or to intend to E and to intend\nto M.\n \n \n\n\nOught Pattern 2 speaks of \u201coughts\u201d for patterns of\nintention, rather than for single intentions. The reason for this is\nthat one\u2019s having an intention to X can affect\none\u2019s reason for having an intention to Y. This can\nhappen in the following way. First, one\u2019s reason to intend to\nY plausibly depends, among other things, on how likely one is\nto succeed in it. Second, how likely one is to succeed in it in turn\ndepends on how the future is likely to be. I am more likely to succeed\nin drying the laundry if there is no rain. Third, how the future is\nlikely to be can depend on how some person is likely to act. I am more\nlikely to succeed in drying the laundry if the children are unlikely\nto be playing with the hose at the same time. Fourth, the relevant\nperson may be the agent himself. I am more likely to succeed in drying\nthe laundry if I am unlikely to be at the same time watering the\ngarden. Finally, the fact that an agent intends to X can make\nit more likely that the agent will X in the future. The fact\nthat I intend to water the garden can make it more likely that I will\nbe watering the garden. Thus, the fact that an agent intends to\nX can make it more likely that the agent will not succeed in\nan intention to Y, and so that the agent has less reason to\nintend to Y. Given that one\u2019s intending to X\ncan affect one\u2019s reason to Y and vice versa, the\nquestions, \u201cWhat reason do I have to intend to Y? What\nreason do I have to intend to X?\u201d may be insufficiently\ndeterminate. Better questions may instead be \u201cWhat reason do I\nhave (to intend to X and to intend to Y)? What\nreason do I have (to intend to X and not to intend to\nY)? What reason do I have (not to intend to X and to\nintend to Y)? What reason do I have (not to intend to\nX and not to intend to Y)?\u201d\n\nThis phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the presence of one\nintention can affect one\u2019s reason to have another intention,\nshould be distinguished from the phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon,\nthat the presence of one intention and the presence or absence of\nanother can make it the case that one violates or satisfies a rational\nrequirement of instrumental coherence as such. First, what matters for\nrational requirements is what we believe about the relations\nbetween the intentions, whereas what matters for reason would seem to\nbe how they are likely to affect one another, which may be\nindependent of what we believe. Second, what matters for rational\nrequirements is intending to X as such, whereas what matters\nfor reason is what intending to X means for the future. In\nsome cases, intending to X (e.g., intending to become King of\nFrance in 2023), may not affect the likely future. In other\ncases, conditions other than intending to X (e.g., my\nself-trust that I will X even if I don\u2019t intend it now,\nor my knowledge that I will be tortured or coerced into\nX-ing) may affect the likely future in the same way.\nFinally, rational requirements are usually taken to be wide-scope, as\nwe will see below. That is, one never needs to have or lack any\nparticular attitude in order to satisfy them. By contrast, one usually\nneeds to have or lack a particular attitude in order to conform to\none\u2019s reason to have a certain pattern of intentions. If one\nought, for example, (to intend to X and not to intend to\nY), then one can comply with this requirement of reason only\nby intending to X and not intending to Y.\n\nOne might argue for Ought Pattern 1 in the following way. Suppose that\nit is not the case that one ought not to believe that one will\nE only if one intends to M. Then by:\n\nEpistemic Strictness:\nIf one believes P or is considering whether P,\nand it is not the case that one ought not to believe P, then\nit is the case that one ought to believe P.\n\n\none ought to believe it. Suppose further that it is not the case that\none ought not to intend to E. Then by:\n\nPractical Strictness:\nIf it is not the case that one ought not to intend to E,\nthen one ought to intend to E.\n\n\none ought to intend to E. Suppose further that:\n\nOught Intention:\nOne ought to intend to E only if one ought to\nE.\n\n\nThen one ought to E. Then by:\n\nVariant of Ought Necessity:\nIf one ought to E, and one ought to believe that one will\nE only if one intends to M, then one ought to intend\nto M.\n\n\none ought to intend to M. In other words, either one ought\nnot to believe that one will E only if one intends to\nM, or one ought not to intend to E, or one ought to\nintend to M.\n\nOne problem is that the objections to Ought Necessity that we saw in\n \u00a72\n seem to apply to Variant as well. Another is that Practical\nStrictness seems untenable (Way 2012a; Cheng-Guajardo 2014). It might\nbe the case neither that one ought not to intend to E, nor\nthat one ought to intend to E; intending to E might\nbe merely permitted. Suppose I ought to take a can of beans. I can\ntake the can of beans on the left, or I can take the equally good can\non the right. It is neither the case that I ought not to intend to\ntake the can on the left, nor that I ought to intend to take the can\non the left.\n\nBut perhaps in such cases one\u2019s intending to take the\ncan on the left provides a reason that tips the scales, thereby making\nit the case that one ought to intend the means to that end. (See\nSchroeder 2009, \u00a74.1; For criticism of the view that intentions\nprovide reasons in this way, see Broome 2001 and Brunero 2007.) If\nthat\u2019s true, then these cases of \u201cpicking\u201d\nwouldn\u2019t pose a special problem for Ought Pattern 1; in all such\ncases, one ought to intend to M.\n\nOne might argue for Ought Pattern 2 in the following way. Again,\nsuppose that it is not the case that one ought not to have the belief.\nThen, by Epistemic Strictness, one ought to have the belief. For the\ntime being, suppose that one does not intend to M. Then\nby:\n\nRequired Self-Knowledge:\nIf one does not intend to M, then one ought to believe\nthat one does not intend to M,\n\n\none ought to believe that one does not intend to M. Then\nby:\n\nReverse Closure:\nIf one ought to believe not Q and one ought to believe\nP only if Q, then one ought to believe not\nP,\n\n\none ought to believe that one will not E. Then by:\n\nEffectiveness:\nSo long as one ought to believe that one will not E, one\nhas no reason to intend to E, since the evidence suggests\nthat doing so is pointless.\n\n\none has no reason to intend to E. In other words, so long as\none does not intend to M, one has no reason to intend to\nE. If we also accept:\n\nCost:\nThere is reason not to intend to E,\n\n\nthen, so long as one does not intend to M, one has no reason\nto intend to E and reason not to intend to E. This\nmakes it plausible that there is more reason (not to intend to\nM and not to intend to E) than (not to intend to\nM and to intend to E). This does not mean\nthat one ought (not to intend to M and not to intend to\nE) all things considered. For example, it might be the case\nthat one ought (to intend to M and to intend to E).\nBut it does mean that whatever pattern of intention one ought to have,\nit is not to (not to intend to M and to intend to\nE). There is a superior alternative.\n\nOne question, of course, is whether we should accept these\nassumptions, in particular Required Self-Knowledge.\n\nAnother problem is that even if this explains Ought Pattern 2, and so\nthe Violation Claim, it does not explain the:\n\nSatisfaction Claim:\nOne satisfies a requirement by avoiding or escaping instrumental\nincoherence (of a kind which one would not satisfy by entering or\nremaining in instrumental incoherence) no matter how one does it.\n\n\nSuppose that one ought to have the means-end belief and one ought (to\nintend to E and to intend to M). However, one avoids\nincoherence by dropping the means-end belief, not intending to\nE, and not intending to M. Intuitively, one has\nsatisfied some requirement. This is what the Satisfaction Claim\nreflects. But one hasn\u2019t adopted the particular attitudes (or\npatterns) that one ought to adopt. How, then, are we to explain the\nSatisfaction Claim?\n\nA quick answer might be this. One might suggest, first, that one ought\nto be instrumentally coherent, because it is a necessary means to, or\nat least a necessary condition of, having the particular attitudes (or\npattern) that one independently ought to have, or not having the\nparticular attitudes (or pattern) that one independently ought not to\nhave. Suppose that one ought to intend to M, but does not.\nJust as (P or Q) is a necessary condition of\nP, so too a necessary condition of intending to M is\n(either not to intend to E, or not to believe that one will\nE only if one intends now to M, or to intend to\nM). Now suppose that instead of intending to M, one\ndrops one\u2019s intention to E. While one hasn\u2019t\nintended to M, which one ought to do, one has fulfilled a\nnecessary means, or at least a necessary condition, of that. Assume\nOught Necessity of\n \u00a72,\n perhaps slightly strengthened: that one ought to take any necessary\nmeans to, or at least fulfill any necessary condition of, what one\nought. In that sense, by dropping one\u2019s intention to E,\none has done something that one ought, and so satisfied a requirement.\nAnalogously, if one ought to post the letter, then, by similar\nreasoning, one ought (either to post the letter or to burn it). So, if\none burns the letter, one has done something that one ought, and so\nsatisfied a requirement.\n\nNote that this response assumes that either Ought Pattern 1 or Ought\nPattern 2 is correct. Otherwise, we have no guarantee that, in any\ngiven case, a necessary condition of having the particular attitudes\nthat one ought to have, or not having the particular attitudes that\none ought not to have, is (either not to intend to E, or not\nto believe that one will E only if one intends now to\nM, or to intend to M). So it inherits all of the\nchallenges in defending Ought Pattern 1 or Ought Pattern 2.\n\nAnother problem with this response is that it is not obvious that\nOught Necessity is true, as the Professor Procrastinate example of\n \u00a72\n suggested.\n\nA third problem is that necessary conditions of intending to\nM are easy to come by. Another necessary condition is (either\nintending to M or being instrumentally incoherent)!\nTherefore, in exactly the same way, one satisfies a requirement by\nremaining incoherent. But the intuitive Satisfaction Claim is\nprecisely that in escaping incoherence one satisfies a requirement of\na kind which one would not satisfy by remaining instrumentally\nincoherent.\n",
