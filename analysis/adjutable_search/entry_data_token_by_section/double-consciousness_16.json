    "main_text": "Beyond the Black/White Binary, Beyond Double Consciousness || Kaleidoscopic Consciousness\n5.3 Kaleidoscopic Consciousness\n\nAlcoff\u2019s reflections on whiteness and white double consciousness\ncome in the wake of her arguments for transcending the black/white\nbinary in Visible Identities. Jos\u00e9 Medina does Alcoff\none better, in a sense, by opening up the possibility of a\nmultiplicitous version of double consciousness as an epistemic tactic\nin the struggle for a more expansive democratic society.\n\nMedina discusses double consciousness \u2013 and its hypothetical\nmultiplicitous twin \u2013 in relation to his core argument, in\nEpistemic Resistance (2013), about the epistemic conditions\nof democratic citizenship and participation, that \u201ca crucial\npart of th[e] perfectionist ongoing struggle toward democracy is the\nresistance against epistemic injustices\u201d (4). \u2018Epistemic\ninjustice\u2019 is the term Medina takes from Miranda Fricker\u2019s\nnaming and analysis of that phenomenon, referring most broadly to a\n\u2018credibility deficit\u2019 \u2013 the discrediting of the\ntestimony or epistemic contributions of persons on the basis of their\nracial, gender, or other elements of \u2018visible identity\u2019.\nMedina\u2019s project is to develop methods to resist the domination\nof such oppressive epistemic circumstances.\n\nAddressing Du Bois\u2019s 1903 formulation, Medina argues that double\nconsciousness is inadequate for addressing the diverse forms of\nracialization of experience in the contemporary U.S., in which a\nmultiplicity of racially oppressed groups exist, as well as other\ngroups facing various other oppressions, on the basis of gender,\nsexuality, and other aspects of identity. The theory of democratic\nresistant consciousness Medina develops is also expansive in aiming to\nencompass the epistemic effects of not only racial but also gender,\nclass, sexual, and other forms of oppression, and the forms of\nepistemic injustice related to these, and so it necessarily transcends\nDu Bois\u2019 binary conception. Medina thus invokes a multiplicitous\nconsciousness \u2013 he actually dubs it \u2018kaleidoscopic\u2019\n\u2013 instead, but one that shares crucial similarities in profile\nwith Du Bois\u2019s original conception.\n\nMedina\u2019s conceptualizations emerge out of a pragmatist approach\nto democratic political theory. He assumes that the achievement of\nprogressive democratic socio-political objectives involves prolonged\nperiods of struggle, in which oppressive ideologies continue to exert\ntheir influence on social agents. Democratic activists \u2013 and,\nindeed, all moral agents in such circumstances \u2013 must therefore\ndevelop and use strategies of epistemic resistance to the deleterious\neffects of oppressive structures on their own internal patterns of\nresponse to racialized and \u2018othered\u2019 social actors\ngenerally. These forms of structural silencing and social ignorance\nfoster internalized blockages impeding agents\u2019 self-awareness,\nblockages which not only impair cognition but also impact the\nsensibilities, feelings, and imaginations of those agents as well.\nBecause he, as theorist, pragmatically adopts as well an activist\nperspective, Medina\u2019s concerns are not only diagnostic. He\ndevelops normative proposals for democratic forms of\n\u2018resistant\u2019 epistemic practices.\n\nMedina interprets Du Bois\u2019s account of double consciousness as\nan indication of how oppressed subjects can utilize their social\nposition to achieve a kind of clarity about both their own position\n\u2013 as having internalized the false dominant viewpoint about them\n\u2013 as well as about the position of those beneficiaries of\noppression \u2013 the ignorance and lack of self-knowledge of those\nin the dominant group itself. This is because those who are subject to\noppression have, as a function of double consciousness, access to both\nsocial viewpoints, and also are compelled by their situation to\nquestion the basis of their social standing and their\nself-understanding in a way those in the dominant positions are not.\nIndeed, according to Medina, those situated in the position of\noppressors, or who benefit from the oppressive regime, are often\n\u2018actively ignorant\u2019 \u2013 that is, ignorant in a way\ntheir own mode of life and activity helps to maintain and reproduce\n\u2013 of the basis and consequences of their standing and the social\ncontext of their own lives.\n\nTo bring about the epistemic resistance required, Medina argues for an\nepistemic stance he terms \u201ckaleidoscopic consciousness\u201d.\nThis is Medina\u2019s expanded version of Du Boisian double\nconsciousness, now explicitly presented as a norm of epistemic\npractice rather than an account of a pre-given social reality.\nKaleidoscopic consciousness involves an open, always anticipatory\nstance toward the possibility of new forms of oppressive social\nrelations and their related modes of \u2018active ignorance.\u2019\nSince forms of active ignorance as Medina calls them are in a sense\nself-fulfilling, blinding one to their own existence, and producing\nwhat he calls \u2018meta-blindness\u2019 \u2013 it is always\npossible \u2013 in some cases likely \u2013 that there are forms of\nblindness one suffers from without even knowing that fact.\n\nThis counter-hegemonic project is not confined to a reform of the\nindividual\u2019s consciousness alone: it involves a corresponding\nrecognition of and commitment to open, exploratory, and conscious\ninteractions with diverse social \u2018others.\u2019 Virtuous\nepistemic agents must be guided by what Medina calls an\n\u2018imperative of epistemic interaction,\u2019 of attunement to\nand reliance on regular encounters with those who are\n\u2018othered,\u2019 in various ways, by the system. This set of\nextended and socially distributed interactions is aimed at producing\nepistemic friction as a necessary condition for an adequate epistemic\norientation to the diversity of agents\u2019 viewpoints, and to\nresisting the diverse forms of socially functional blindness to the\nperspectives of socially \u2018othered\u2019 persons. Such\nunderstanding is a key component of a successful democratic political\nproject, according to Medina, and can only be achieved through what is\nitself a form of socially transformative epistemic practice.\n",
