    "main_text": "\n\nWhat it takes to be ultimate is to be the most fundamentally real,\nvaluable or fulfilling among all that there is or could be.\nHistorically, philosophy of religion in the West has taken God to be\nultimate. Over the past century, the field has become increasingly\naware that ultimacy is grasped under different concepts in the\nworld\u2019s religions, philosophies and\nquasi-religious philosophies\u2014so not only as \u201cGod\u201d\nbut also as, e.g., \u201cBrahman\u201d, \u201cthe Dao\u201d, and\nmore. Moreover, people have thought to conceptualize each of these\nultimates in numerous ways across cultures and times, so there are\nmany models of Brahman, many models of God, many models of the Dao,\nand more; perhaps there is even a model of what is ultimate for each\nperson who has thought hard about it. This entry presents a framework\nfor understanding this vast landscape of models of God and other\nultimates and then surveys some of its major sights. Familiarity with\nthis landscape can clarify the long journey to deciding whether there\nis anything ultimate, among other benefits.\n\nSection 1 defines \u201cultimate\u201d and \u201cmodels\u201d of\nultimates, discusses reasons to be interested in the project of\nmodeling what is ultimate or alternatively to think it futile, and\nexplains major categories that help organize the field of models.\nSection 2 uses these categories to relay over twenty models of\nBrahman, God and the Dao, both for their own sakes and as\nentr\u00e9es into the landscape (the models are numbered as they\nsurface to help the reader spot them and to show by example what a\nmodel is). Section 3 discusses the significance of the plurality of\nmodels once they are juxtaposed.\n",
