In the Aesthetic of 1901 (Aes.\n82\u20137, 114), and again in Essence of Aesthetic of 1913\n(EA 13\u201316) , he had been happy to deduce from his\ntheory that art cannot have an ethical purpose. The only value in art\nis beauty. But by 1917, in the essay The Totality of Artistic\nExpression (PPH 261\u201373), his attitude towards the\nmoral content of art is more nuanced. This may have been only a shift\nof emphasis, or, charitably perhaps, drawing out a previously\nunnoticed implication: \u2018If the ethical principle is a cosmic\n[universal] force (as it certainly is) and queen of the world, the\nworld of liberty, she reigns in her own right, while art, in\nproportion to the purity with which she re-enacts and expresses the\nmotions of reality, is herself perfect\u2019 (PPH 267). In\nother words, he still holds that to speak of a moral work of art would\nnot impinge upon it aesthetically; likewise to speak of an\nimmoral work, for the values of the aesthetic and moral\ndomains are absolutely incommensurable. It is not merely an\nassertion that within the domain of pure intuition, the\nconcepts simply don\u2019t apply; that would merely beg the question.\nHe means that a pure work of art cannot be subject to moral\npraise or blame because the Aesthetic domain exists independently of\nand prior, in the Philosophy of Spirit, to the Ethical.\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia article of 1928, Croce asserts positively that\nthe moral sensibility is a necessary condition of the artist:\n\nThe foundation of all poetry is therefore the human personality, and\nsince the human personality fulfills itself morally, the foundation of\nall poetry is the moral conscience. (PPH 221)\n\n\nStill it\u2019s possible to read him as not having changed his view.\nFor instance, Shakespeare could not have been Shakespeare without\nseeing into the moral heart of man, for morality is the highest domain\nof spirit. But we have to distinguish between the moral\nsensibility\u2014the capacity to perceive and feel moral\nemotions\u2014and the capacity to act morally. Croce\u2019s position\nis that only the first is relevant to art.\n\nThe early emphasis on beauty is downplayed in subsequent writing in\nfavour of the successful work art as expression, as constituting a\n\u2018lyrical intuition\u2019. In Essence of Aesthetic he\nwrites:\n\n\u2026what gives coherence and unity to the intuition is feeling:\nthe intuition is really such because it represents a feeling, and can\nonly appear from and upon that. Not the idea, but the feeling, is what\nconfers upon art the airy lightness of a symbol: an aspiration\nenclosed in the circle of a representation\u2014that is art; and in\nit the aspiration alone stands for the representation, and the\nrepresentation alone for the aspiration. (EA 30)\n\n\nCroce still holds that art is intuitive, a-logical or nonconceptual,\nand therefore by \u2018it represents a feeling\u2019 he does not\nmean that our aesthetic mode of engagement involves that concept, and\nhe does not mean that art is to be understood as symbolic, implying a\nrelation which would require an intellectual act of mind to apprehend.\nBoth would imply that our mode of aesthetic engagement would be\nsomething more, or something other than, the aesthetic, which is as\nalways the intuitive capacity. The point is simply that our awareness\nof the form of the intuition in nothing but our awareness of the\nunifying currents of feeling running through it. It is a claim about\nwhat it is that unifies an intuition, distinguishes it from the\nsurrounding, relatively discontinuous or confused intuition. This is,\nin effect, a claim about the nature of beauty:\n\nAn appropriate expression, if appropriate, is also beautiful, beauty\nbeing nothing but the precision of the image, and therefore of the\nexpression. \u2026(EA 48).\n\n\nExpression and beauty are not two concepts, but a single concept,\nwhich it is permissible to designate with either synonymous word\n\u2026 (EA 49).\n\n\nGenuinely new in the 1917 essay was Croce\u2019s appealing but\nenigmatic claim that art is in a sense \u2018universal\u2019, is\nconcerned with the \u2018totality\u2019:\n\nTo give artistic form to a content of feeling means, then, impressing\nupon it the character of totality, breathing into it the breath of the\ncosmos. Thus understood, universality and artistic form are not two\nthings but one. (PPH 263).\n\n\nAnd:\n\nIn intuition, the single pulsates with the life of the whole, and the\nwhole is in the life of the single. Every genuine artistic\nrepresentation is itself and is the universe, the universe in\nthat individual form, and that individual form as\nthe universe. In every utterance, every fanciful [imaginative]\ncreation, of the poet, there lies the whole of human destiny, all\nhuman hope, illusions, griefs, joys, human grandeurs and miseries, the\nwhole drama of reality perpetually evolving and growing out of itself\nin suffering and joy. (PPH 262)\n\n\nCroce\u2014and undoubtedly the political situation in Italy in 1917\nplayed a role in this\u2014was anxious to assert the importance of\nart for humanity, and his assertion of it is full of feeling. And the\nclaim marks a decisive break from earlier doctrine: form is now linked\nwith universality rather that with particular feelings. But it is\ndifficult to see beyond such metaphors as \u2018impressing upon it\nthe character of totality\u2019 (not even with the help of\nCroce\u2019s Logic). One is reminded of the Kantian dictum\nthat in aesthetics we \u2018demand universality\u2019 in our\njudgements, but there are no explicit indications of such. There is\none piece of Crocean philosophy behind it: Since art takes place prior\nto the intellect, so the logical distinction between subject and\npredicate collapses; therefore perhaps at least one barrier is removed\nfrom speaking of the \u2018universality of art\u2019. But that does\nnot indicate what, positively, it means. It obvious that there is\nsomething right about speaking of the \u2018universal\ncharacter\u2019 of a Beethoven or a Michelangelo as opposed to the\npitiful, narrow little spectacle of this month\u2019s pop band, but\nCroce doesn\u2019t tell us what justifies or explains such talk\n(various others have reached a similar conclusion; see Orsini p. 214).\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean that he had no right to proclaim it,\nand perhaps not to count his readers as agreeing to it.\n",
