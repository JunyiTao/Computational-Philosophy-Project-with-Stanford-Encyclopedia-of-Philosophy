    "main_text": "The Right to Vote || The Shelby Case and Its Aftermath\n4.3 The Shelby Case and Its Aftermath\n\nIn Shelby County, the Supreme Court struck down the coverage\nformula of the VRA, thereby rendering impotent Section 5\u2019s\npreclearance provision: with no coverage formula, no jurisdictions\ncould be picked out as ones needing to receive federal approval for\nchanging their electoral rules. The formula had been last updated in\nthe early 1970\u2019s, and, writing for the court, Chief Justice\nRoberts found that the use of the formula had become\n\u201cirrational\u201d in light of the \u201cdramatic [racial]\nprogress\u201d that had been made in the intervening decades (554 and\n556). He pointed out that the jurisdictions covered by the formula had\nrates of black voter registration and turnout as high, and in some\ncases higher, than the rates for whites, and that minorities had come\nto hold office \u201cat unprecedented levels\u201d (547) in those\nstates.\n\nJustice Roberts did not deny the existence of second-generation\nbarriers, but he argued that Congress had failed to reshape the\ncoverage formula to track the parts of the country in which such\nbarriers were most prevalent at present. Accordingly, he did not see a\nrational relationship between the formula and any remaining obstacles\nto racial discrimination in voting. Moreover, he contended that\nSection 5 constituted a \u201cdramatic departure from the principle\nthat all states enjoy equal sovereignty\u201d (535). In light of such\na departure from a principle that he regarded as fundamental, Roberts\nconcluded that Congress lacked the constitutional power to impose the\nold coverage formula.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg emphasized the evidential record that\nCongress had compiled prior to its 2006 reauthorization of the law.\nThat record led Congress to the conclusion that the old coverage\nformula was adequate to target those jurisdictions where\nsecond-generation barriers were most prevalent. For example, the\nrecord contained a study showing that covered areas were much more\nlikely to be successfully sued in Section 2 litigation than other\njurisdictions. Accordingly, Ginsburg judged that \u201cCongress had\nreasonably concluded that the coverage formula continues to identify\nthe jurisdictions of greatest concern\u201d (578). She also construed\nthe \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d principle as applying only to the\nvery limited circumstance in which a new state was being admitted to\nthe union: the new state must not be accorded a lesser, or greater,\ndegree of sovereignty than the existing states.\n\nRoberts is correct to see the VRA as a \u201cdramatic\ndeparture\u201d (535) from the traditional legal view of the power of\nthe national government to regulate state elections. As Ackerman\nstresses, the act was a radical piece of legislation, akin to a\nconstitutional amendment in the way that it overturned long-settled\nlegal understandings (2014). Nonetheless, Roberts\u2019s argument\nthat Congress must reshape the coverage formula is not convincing. On\nthe surface, it appears unreasonable for Congress to rely on an old\nformula despite important changes in the situation of blacks. But the\nfact that a situation has changed in some relevant respects does not\nmean that it has changed in all such respects, and a closer look by\nCongress determined that in one respect matters had not changed: the\nsame jurisdictions picked out by the old formula still had the most\nproblematic records in upholding the rights of blacks to an undiluted\nvote. Roberts glosses over the fact that increases in registration\namong blacks do not address the problem of racial vote dilution, and,\nalthough he is correct that black officeholding rates have increased\nconsiderably since 1970, it was reasonable for Congress to conclude\nthat the increase was due largely to vigorous federal enforcement\nbased on the old coverage formula.\n\nIn the wake of Shelby, states that had been subject to the\nfederal preclearance requirement (as well as a number of states that\nhad not been subject to it) have adopted laws and practices that make\nvoting more difficult than it had previously been and that\ndisproportionately disadvantage blacks, members of indigenous tribes,\nand other racial minorities. These laws and practices include photo ID\nand proof of citizenship requirements, restrictions on early voting\nand mail-in ballots, and a reduction in the number of polling places.\nThe prevention of voter fraud is the main rationale offered for such\nmeasures. However, litigation challenging the measures has been\nmounted across the country. Where a discriminatory intent can be\nshown, the measures are vulnerable to judicial invalidation (NAACP\nv. McCrory 2016), but absent a \u201csmoking gun\u201d showing\nsuch intent, the measures have been generally upheld (see, e.g.,\nBrnovich v. D.N.C. 2021). Their critics have contended that\nthe measures violate section 2 of the VRA because their\ndisproportionate racial impact means that the measures \u201cresult[\n] in \u2026 [a]n abridgment of the right to vote\u201d on account\nof race (VRA: section 2; Commission on Civil Rights 2018; Herron and\nSmith 2016). But legal and philosophical questions remain about how to\ninterpret the results-oriented language of section 2 and whether an\nintent to discriminate should be seen as a necessary element of any\nviable claim of racial discrimination in electoral arrangements\n(Altman 1998). \n",
