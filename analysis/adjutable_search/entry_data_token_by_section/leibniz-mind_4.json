    "main_text": "Perception and Appetition\n5. Apperception, Desire and the Unconscious\n\nOne of the better-known terms of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy, and of\nhis philosophy of mind, is \u201capperception.\u201d A famous\ndefinition is presented in section 4 of the Principles of Nature\nand of Grace (1714), where Leibniz says that apperception is\n\u201cconsciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this\ninternal state.\u201d He adds that this is \u201csomething not given\nto all souls, nor at all times to a given soul\u201d (G VI,\n600/A&G 208).\n\nDespite being well known, Leibniz\u2019s concept of apperception is\nnot necessarily well understood. In particular, the place of\napperception in the three-fold classifications given at the end of the\nprevious section\u2014of three kinds of perceptions and of simple\nsubstances\u2014is not agreed upon, despite the fact that this would\nseem to be of considerable importance. (See Kulstad 1991a for\ndiscussion.) A common understanding is that for Leibniz apperception\nis distinctive of spirits and is not present in even the highest of\nanimals beneath humans. While there is evidence that Leibniz at least\nsometimes adopts this position, there is also evidence that he\nsometimes endorses the view that (at least some) beasts also\napperceive. Since we may assume that at a minimum apperception\ninvolves consciousness (though not necessarily certain higher forms of\nconsciousness, e.g., self-consciousness, or reflective consciousness,\nin one sense or another), this leads to some uncertainty as to whether\nLeibniz assigns consciousness to beasts, that is, whether he does or\ndoes not agree with the famous Cartesian principle that beasts are not\nconscious but only material automata.\n\nThere are at least three specific lines of evidence for apperception\nin beasts. The first is that Leibniz sometimes uses very similar\ndefinitions and examples when talking about the contrast between, on\nthe one hand, apperceptions and petites perceptions\n(perceptions which are not apperceived), and, on the other, sensation\nand bare perceptions. This suggests, though it does not demonstrate,\nthat Leibniz is identifying apperception and sensation, not\napperception and rational thought. The second line of evidence is that\nhe often appears to take the side of the common man against\nDescartes\u2019 position on beasts, for example, when he says,\n\nIt will be difficult to rid mankind of this opinion which has been\nheld always and everywhere and which is universal if any opinion\ndeserves that term, namely, that beasts have feelings (letter to\nArnauld, 9 October 1687; G II, 117/LA 150).\n\n\nFinally, there are passages, notably in the New Essays concerning\nHuman Understanding (1704), in which Leibniz quite simply\nascribes apperception, directly or indirectly, to beasts, as, for\nexample, when he discusses the case of a wild boar that has only a\nbare perception of a human until the human shouts at it, at which\npoint the boar apperceives the person\n(\u201cs\u2019apper\u00e7oit d\u2019une personne\u201d)\nand begins a charge (Bk.II ch.21, sec.5; A vi VI 173). \n\nWithout trying to proceed further with this issue here, we can see\nthat whichever of these views is ultimately adopted, it remains the\ncase that Leibniz\u2019s theory of perception involves something very\ndistinctive in an age dominated by Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas,\nthe thesis that there are some perceptions of which we are not\nconscious, the much-discussed petites perceptions. Although\nLeibniz may not have been the first to propose such an idea (Aquinas,\nfor example, might have had a similar view; see his Summa\nTheologiae, I-II, q.1, art.3), and although the view in his hands\ndid not have the explosive quality that it did in the hands of Freud,\nthe thesis remains an intriguing and important part of his philosophy\nof mind. Indeed, the Preface of the New Essays concerning Human\nUnderstanding contains as strong a statement as one is likely to\nfind about the centrality of this view in a particular metaphysical\nsystem. Among other things, Leibniz makes it very clear that it is not\njust lower simple substances that have such unconscious perceptions\nbut also human minds.\n\nHaving raised the issue of unconscious perceptions, we should consider\nalso the question of unconscious appetitions. This is infrequently\ndiscussed, but the question should not be overlooked. Since\nappetitions are tendencies or strivings, ones which profoundly\ninfluence human actions, it is relevant whether or not an individual\nhuman is conscious of all of these strivings. Certainly, some have\ntaken the possibility of urges of which we are not conscious as highly\nimportant for the proper understanding of individual humans and,\nindeed, of the human condition generally.\n\nThere is evidence, notably from the New Essays, that Leibniz\ndid indeed draw a parallel between perceptions and appetitions with\nrespect to consciousness. Although he did not always explain the\ndistinction between conscious and unconscious appetitions with care\nand uniformity, it seems clear that he committed himself to\nappetitions of which we are not conscious, or which we do not\napperceive, just as he had committed himself to perceptions which are\nnot apperceived. Consider the following two statements in combination:\n\u201cdesires and tendencies which are apperceived are often called\nvolitions\u201d (New Essays, Bk.II, ch.21, sec.39; RB 192);\nand, \u201cThere are also efforts that result from insensible\nperceptions which one does not apperceive, and these I prefer to call\nappetitions rather than volitions (although there are also\napperceptible appetitions)\u201d (New Essays, Bk.2, ch.21,\nsec.5; RB 173).\n\nIn short, and perhaps oversimplifying to a certain extent, we can say\nthat in the Leibnizian realm of mind there are indeed only perceptions\nand appetitions, but in these there is a fundamental divide between\nthe realm of consciousness and unconsciousness. In the former, there\nare apperceptions and desires, the perceptions and appetitions of\nwhich we are conscious. In the latter, there are perceptions and\nappetitions of which we are not conscious. That does not mean,\nhowever, that this latter realm is unimportant in our mental lives. As\nLeibniz says, \u201cinsensible perceptions are as important to [the\nscience of minds, souls, and soul-like substances] as insensible\ncorpuscles are to natural science, and it is just as unreasonable to\nreject the one as the other on the pretext that they are beyond the\nreach of our senses\u201d (New Essays, Preface; RB 56). He\nwould have said the same, no doubt, about inapperceptible\nappetitions.\n",
