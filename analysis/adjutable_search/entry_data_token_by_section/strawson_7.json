He wrote very little on the topic, commenting\nlater on his \u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 and \u2018Social\nMorality and Individual Ideal\u2019, that \u2018[b]etween them,\nthese two papers effectively embody all I have thought or have to say\nin a philosophical area which, important as I recognize it to be, I\nhave never found as intellectually gripping as those to which I have\ngiven more attention\u2019 (Strawson 1998, 11). Nevertheless,\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 (Strawson 1962) is perhaps now\nStrawson\u2019s most famous and widely discussed paper.\n\nStrawson\u2019s aim in this paper is to dissolve the so-called\nproblem of determinism and responsibility. He does this by drawing a\ncontrast between two different perspectives we can take on the world:\nthe \u2018participant\u2019 and \u2018objective\u2019 standpoints.\nThese perspectives involve different explanations of other\npeople\u2019s actions. From the objective point of view, we see\npeople as elements of the natural world, causally manipulated and\nmanipulable in various ways. From the participant point of view, we\nsee others as appropriate objects of \u2018reactive attitudes\u2019,\nattitudes such as gratitude, anger, sympathy and resentment, which\npresuppose the responsibility of other people. These two perspectives\nare opposed to one another, but both are legitimate.\n\nStrawson\u2019s paper notes two broad ways in which we can withdraw\nfrom the participant perspective. The first involves cases in which\nthe agent remains someone to whom reactive attitudes are appropriate\nbut where something about the circumstances means that the attitude is\nnot appropriate in this particular case. Perhaps you stood on my foot\nbecause you were pushed. In this case, you have a good excuse for your\nbehaviour and resentment is no longer appropriate. The second involves\ncases in which the agent has more or less permanent incapacities which\nremove them from the domain of reactive attitudes in general. Perhaps\nthe person who stood on my foot is a child or in the grip of some\npsychopathological illness. In these cases, we cease to treat the\nagent as a fitting object of reactive attitudes, even if only\ntemporarily.\n\nStrawson takes these observations about the reactive attitudes to bear\non the reconciliation of determinism and responsibility because of the\ninescapability of the reactive attitudes. They are a central part of\nwhat it is to be human. The truth of determinism cannot, then, force\nus to give up the participant standpoint, because the reactive\nattitudes are too deeply embedded in our humanity. Between determinism\nand responsibility there can be no conflict.\n\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 has spawned an extensive\nliterature. It introduced the notion of reactive attitudes to debates\nabout free will and responsibility and one set of questions raised by\nthe paper concerns the nature of these attitudes. Strawson\ncharacterises them initially as those belonging to involvement or\nparticipation with others in interpersonal human relationships and he\ntakes them to target the good will of others as manifested in their\nbehaviour. Others have broaded the notion, instead emphasising their\nconnection to holding someone to some expectation or demand (see\nWallace 1994). Another set of questions concerns the relation between\nthe reactive attitudes and moral responsibility. Gary Watson, in a\npaper first published in 1987, reads Strawson as holding that the\nreactive attitudes are constitutive of moral responsibility and raises\na challenge for such a view in explaining our attitudes towards cases\nof extreme evil (Watson 2004). Others have queried whether Strawson\nintends the reactive attitudes to have such explanatory priority\n(Alvarez 2021)\n\nA final set of questions concerns the inescapability of the\nparticipant stance and its role in the overall structure of\nStrawson\u2019s argument. Some have emphasised the connections with\nStrawson\u2019s reading of Hume and Wittgenstein as set out in\nSkepticism and Naturalism; see, for example, Russell 1992. Others such\nas Allais 2014 have emphasised the connections with Kant, not least\nthe suggestive affinity with Kant\u2019s attempt to dissolve the\nproblem of free will in the Critique of Pure Reason. More recently,\nHieronymi 2020 provides a book-length defence of a \u2018social\nnaturalist\u2019 reading of Strawson\u2019s paper and De Mesel 2022\ntraces the connection between \u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 and\nStrawson\u2019s later (and underappreciated) writings on the same\nthemes. \n\nStrawson\u2019s paper and many of its important responses are\ncollected together in McKenna and Russell 2008. A set of papers\npublished to mark its 50th anniversary are collected in Shoemaker and\nTognazzini 2014.\n",
