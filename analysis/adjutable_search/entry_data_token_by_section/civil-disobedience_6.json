    "main_text": "Other Types of Protest || Rule Departures\n2.2 Rule Departures\n\nA practice distinct from, but related to, civil disobedience is rule\ndeparture on the part of authorities. Rule departure is essentially\nthe deliberate decision by an official, for conscientious reasons, not\nto discharge the duties of her office (Feinberg 1992, 152). If an\nofficial\u2019s breach of a specific duty is more in keeping with the\nspirit and overall aims of the office than a painstaking respect for\nits particular duties is, then the former might be said to adhere\nbetter than the latter does to the demands of the office (Greenawalt\n1987, 281). Rule departures resemble civil disobedience in that both\ncommunicate the agent\u2019s dissociation from and condemnation of\ncertain policies and practices. Civil disobedience and rule departure\ndiffer mainly in the identity of their practitioners and in their\nlegality. First, whereas rule departure typically is done by an agent\nof the state (including citizens serving in juries), civil\ndisobedience typically is done by citizens (including officials acting\nas ordinary citizens and not in the capacity of their official role).\nSecond, whereas the civil disobedient breaks the law, the official who\ndeparts from the rules associated with her role is not usually\nviolating the law, unless the rule she breaks is also codified in law.\nFor instance, jurors may refuse to convict a person for violating an\nunjust law. When they do, they nullify the law. However, many judges\nforbid any mention of jury nullification in their courtroom, so that\njurors are not allowed to advise each other of the possibility to\nrefuse to convict (Brooks 2004).\n",
