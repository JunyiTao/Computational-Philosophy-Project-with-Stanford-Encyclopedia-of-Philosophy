    "main_text": "Four Forms of Recognition\n2. Four Forms of Recognition\n\n\nWe can differentiate the concept of recognition according\nto the kind of features a person is recognized for. Most agree that only in a formal sense is recognition a vital human\nneed or an anthropological constant. New demands of recognition always\nowe themselves to the historically established and changing ideas of\nwhat kind of recognition we deserve. This is illustrated by the rather\nrecent historical development in which the premodern concept of honor\n(which was assigned to persons as members of a group within a\nhierarchical social structure) was divided into two parts: first, into\nthe modern notion of equal respect awarded to all agents capable of\nautonomy and, second, into the idea of esteem due to one\u2019s\nachievements. Whereas the former now guarantees a basic level of\nrecognition for everyone, the latter creates a hitherto unknown\ninsecurity with regard to the question of what kind of recognition one\ndeserves (Taylor 1992, 34\u201335); an insecurity which, according to some\nauthors, has led to the growing importance of intimate love and\nfriendship within the private sphere.\n\n\nKantians\u2014and liberals more generally\u2014usually concentrate\non the first dimension of the modern recognition order, i.e., on\nrespect for the equal dignity of autonomous beings. Hegelian theories\nof recognition, by contrast, embrace a more encompassing view of\nrecognition attempting to cover all spheres of recognition within\nmodernity. Thus, in his classical text on the topic, \u201cThe\nPolitics of Recognition,\u201d Charles Taylor distinguishes three\nforms of recognition (Taylor 1992). Whereas a \u201cpolitics of\nuniversalism\u201d aims at the equal recognition of all persons in\ntheir common humanity, a \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d\u2014as\nonly one dimension of a politics of recognition (Blum 1998; Thompson\n2006, 7\u20138)\u2014emphasizes the uniqueness of specific (and\nespecially cultural) features (Taylor 1992, 37) often associated with\ncommunitarianism. Finally, Taylor thematizes the recognition of\nconcrete individuality in contexts of loving care that are of utmost\nimportance to subjects (Taylor 1992, 37). It is these three dimensions\nof the modern recognition order\u2014which reach back to Hegel\u2019s\ntreatment of the subject\u2014that have been primarily analyzed in\nthe discussion (Ik\u00e4heimo 2002). They have even been interpreted\nas genealogically distinct stages along which individual persons gain\nself-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem (Honneth 1992, ch. 5).\nHowever, some have argued that a much more fundamental form of\n\u201celementary\u201d recognition (2.1) is underlying these modern\nspheres of respect (2.2), esteem (2.3) as well as love and friendship\n(2.4).\n",
