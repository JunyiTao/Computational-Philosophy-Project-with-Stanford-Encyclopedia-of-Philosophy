    "main_text": "Approaching Sin within a Religious Tradition || Religion-Neutral Value Theory and Sin\n1.1 Religion-Neutral Value Theory and Sin\n\nMost contemporary philosophy of religion assumes either a framework of\ngeneric theism or the framework of Christianity. (While the present\ntreatment largely reflects this focus from the literature on which it\ndraws, it should be noted that this focus has been criticized on a\nnumber of fronts. (See, for instance, Knepper 2014, Draper &\nNichols 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Simmons 2019a, and Timpe & Hereth\n2019).) Discussions that assume the framework of generic theism often\nproceed along the lines of what Marilyn McCord Adams calls \u201ca\nreligion-neutral value theory\u201d. Religion-neutral value theories\nseek both to avoid dependence on values specific to a particular\nreligious tradition and to include only such value assumptions as\nwould also be acceptable to an atheologian (M. Adams 1988: 127; for a\ncriticism of such an approach, see Moser 2019). Philosophers who have\nadopted such theories have tended\n\n\nnot to speak of sin, but of moral agency and responsibility, of moral\ngoodness or turpitude. (M. Adams 1991: 1)\n\n\nMcCord Adams herself thinks this assumption of neutrality is\nunjustified, however, citing the significant difference in ontological\ncommitment between theists and atheologians, and the implications this\ndifference has for their moral theorizing:\n\n\nDifferent ontological commitments with their different stores of\nvaluables widen or narrow the range of options for defeating evils\nwith goods. Secular value theories can offer only packages of immanent\ngoods; some religious theories posit an infinite transcendent goodness\nand invite relationship to it; while Christianity believes the\ninfinite good to be personal, and locates the happiness of finite\npersons in loving personal intimacy with the divine persons. (M. Adams\n1988: 129; see also Plantinga 1985: 36)\n\n\nIn short, the degree to which a belief system can make sense of a\nparticular claim or theory depends on the resources within that belief\nsystem (see Hasker 2008: 17\u201319, 120).\n\nA religion-value neutral approach to sin, in particular, would be\nconstrained by the relatively small number of shared values between\ntheists and atheologians regarding the core concepts at stake,\nincluding the nature of the harms involved and the opportunities for\nreparation. As suggested by Plantinga 2000, M. Adams 1988, and Stump\n2010, the simple fact that different religious traditions have\ndifferent constraints to work with and different resources to draw on\ndoesn\u2019t weigh for or against the plausibility of those\ntraditions. In this case, contemporary Christianity sets the value\nsystem within which conceptions of sin will be examined.\n",
