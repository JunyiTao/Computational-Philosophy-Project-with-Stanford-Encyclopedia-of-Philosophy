    "main_text": "The intelligibility of the new geometries || Poincar\u00e9 versus Russell\n6.3 Poincar\u00e9 versus Russell\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views brought him into collision with Bertrand\nRussell in the 1890s when he was emerging from his brief Hegelian\nphase and entering his Kantian phase. Russell was trying to establish\nthe Kantian a priori by arguing that there is one fundamental\ngeometry, which is projective geometry, and we have synthetic a priori\nknowledge of it (see Griffin 1991 on Russell and Nabonnand 2000 on the\ncontroversy).\n\nThere can be little doubt that Poincar\u00e9, with his much greater\ncommand of mathematics, won much of the debate, as Russell, with his\ncharacteristic willingness to admit his errors, was willing to\nconcede. But a significant difference of approach between them was\nnever to be resolved. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s analysis began with\nrigid bodies and their motions, from which a concept of distance is\ncreated. Russell argued on the contrary, that whatever we may discover\nthe concept of distance to be, we know before we begin that the\ndistance from London to Paris is more than a metre. This\nPoincar\u00e9 denied in his \u201cDes fondements de la\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie: \u00e0 propos d\u2019un livre de M.\nRussell\u201d (1899).\n\nIn Poincar\u00e9\u2019s view, we only know the distance from\none point to another on the basis of experience with rigid bodies, and\nthis knowledge has become innate in us. In Russell\u2019s view,\ndistance is to be regarded as a fundamental intuition, and if some\ncontemplated that the distance from London to Paris could be less than\na metre, we would know we could not be talking about distance. But\nPoincar\u00e9 insisted that talk of what we know should always be\ndependent on how we know it; without that, the claims were not\nknowledge claims at all.\n\nA mathematical illustration may illuminate the disagreement. For\nPoincar\u00e9, talk about what we might call ordinary geometry, the\nsense of space that we have prior to advanced instruction, is really\nabout the ability we have to measure things. We can carry a rigid body\naround, and use it as a ruler. It is because we can do that that we\ncan speak of the distance between places. If you want to make the\nset-up more abstract, there must be a space and a group that acts on\nthe space and moves points in the space around. If this group has the\nproperty that however a region of that space is moved around it is\nnever mapped onto a proper subset of itself then one can construct\nrigid bodies and talk about distance.\n\nFor Russell, one is free to take a space and assign a\n\u2018distance\u2019 to each pair of points (subject to some simple\nconditions which we omit). Relative to this sense of distance, one can\nsay if, as a region is moved around, points in it remain the same\ndistance apart or not. We have done this for our sense of distance on\nthe surface of the Earth, and we can do this whether or not we also\nhave some rigid body motions. In mathematical terms, Russell would be\nhappy with what is called a metric space. The point is not that one\ncould impose a metric on the surface of the Earth in which a\nparticular pair of points, say in Cambridge, were a metre apart and\nLondon and Paris were only half a metre apart\u2014one\ncould\u2014but that one can talk about distance without presupposing\nthe action of a group. Some metric spaces admit the action of groups\nthat preserve distance, others do not, but distance can be defined\nwithout talking about a group. Poincar\u00e9 was never confronted\nwith exactly this argument\u2014metric spaces are an invention of the\n20th century\u2014but we know what he would have said. He\nwould have said that it was valid mathematics but entirely formal and\ncould not be considered as genuine knowledge because it lacked a\npsychophysical dimension. We know this because it was his criticism of\nthe axiomatic geometries constructed by Hilbert (see below).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s arguments also met with objections from the\nItalian mathematician Federigo Enriques. Poincar\u00e9 had argued\nthat one way to see the validity of the geometrical conventionalist\nargument was to consider a disc in which everything was made of the\nsame material, which expanded as it heated, and in which the\ntemperature was a particular function of the distance of the centre of\nthe disc. This function, which Poincar\u00e9 specified, ensured that\nthe metric in the disc, as measured by rods made of the same material\nas the disc, was that of non-Euclidean geometry. Creatures living in\nthe disc would report that their space was non-Euclidean; we would\nreply that their space was Euclidean but subject to the distorting\neffect of a temperature field. Plainly each side can maintain their\nposition free of self-contradiction.\n\nEnriques argued, in his book Problemi della Scienza (1906),\nthat this was unreasonable. The creatures would be right to ascribe a\ngeometry to their space (and, indeed, non-Euclidean geometry) because\nthe distorting force is beyond their control. Their geodesics are\nbuilt in to the space, and it would be unreasonable of them to ascribe\nthe paths of geodesics to the operation of a \u2018force\u2019\nbecause that \u2018force\u2019 was not something they could even in\nprinciple manipulate. Heat, the gravitational effect of massive\nobjects, all these distorting influences are things that can be\nallowed for, because they can be changed. If, in the experiment above,\nit were to be claimed that space is Euclidean but our candidates for\nstraight lines are deformed it should be possible to vary the degree\nof deformation. One might conduct the experiment further away from any\nmassive objects, in emptier regions of space. If different experiments\ngave even slightly different results one would, in accordance with\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s own criteria for changing scientific\nconventions, look for something in the circumstances that was\nresponsible for the deviation of the light rays from straightness. But\nif no experiment were to show any difference, Enriques argued that it\nwould be rational to conclude that light rays travelled on geodesics\nand the geometry of space was non-Euclidean.\n\nIt is worth noticing that the growing sophistication of ideas about\nhow theoretical geometry relates to practical experience, and about\nthe nature of the knowledge that geometry supplies, belong to a family\nof changes across all of mathematics by 1900. An autonomous discipline\nof mathematics emerged that placed an increasing emphasis on formal\naspects of the subject and offered a complicated and often distant\nrelationship with the world of experience. This modernist turn in\nmathematics is discussed in various places (see Gray 2008 and the\nliterature cited there).\n",
