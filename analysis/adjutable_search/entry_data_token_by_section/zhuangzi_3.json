    "main_text": "A Modern Philosophical Interpretation || Skepticism\n4.7 Skepticism\nZhuangzi\u2019s stance toward Mohist formal realism (if we\ndisagree on a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, one party must \u52dd\nsh\u00e8ngwin) becomes clearer now. The Mohists\ndid not specify any objective mechanism of \u201cwinning\u201d\nbeyond some vague suggestion of tipping a balance. However Zhuangzi\u2019s\npoint in response appears to track the warning function of a\nnorm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging\nstandards, we may still be wrong). Zhuangzi takes\nsh\u00e8ngwinning as a vague primitive in\narguing that we cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by appeal to\nwinning disputes. The main mechanism Zhuangzi discusses is appeal to a\njudge or authority. We appreciate that all judges will also use terms\nlike sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that indexed by\ntheir acquired commitment momentum. Their judgments, like ours,\nexpress their momentum along a d\u00e0o of using\nthese words here, now and projecting the usage to\nthat, there, then. \n Given that you and\nI have been brought to \u8faf\nbi\u00e0ndispute and you win me over and I\ndon\u2019t win you over, in such a case is your distinction\nsubstantively \u662f Sh\u00ecthis:right? Mine\nsubstantively \u975e f\u0113i? If I win you over and\nyou don\u2019t win me over; is mine substantively right? And yours?;\nsubstantively wrong? Are they partly right and partly wrong? Or\njointly right and jointly wrong? You and I cannot know between\nourselves, so another human inherently inherits our obscurity and\ndoubt. To whom can we go to correct us?  Employing someone who agrees\nwith you, given that they are like you, how can they correct the\nsituation? Employing someone who agrees with me, given that they are\nlike me, how can they correct it? Employ someone different from both\nme and you to correct it, given that they are different from us both,\nhow can they correct it? Employ someone who is like both of us to\ncorrect it, given that they are like us both, how can they correct it?\nSo you and I and others cannot know, and in these condition on what\nother can we rely? The changing sounds\u2019 mutual dependence is like their\nconjoint autonomy. Harmonize them with glances at nature and make them\ndependent on eventual consensus and with that exhaust the\nyears. (Ibid., HY 7/2/84\u201392) \n\nIt is not clear if the conclusion is supposed to be a solution to the\nskeptical problem posed or merely a way to cope constructively with\ncomplexity and uncertainty. The passage rules out any appeal to a\nspecial authority of any other point of view\u2014while giving equal\nauthority in the construction to all. Even where we all share some\n\u201cconventional wisdom\u201d it does not have special\nauthority\u2014say over other creatures. This, was  implicit in Mozi\u2019s rejection of socially agreed\nd\u00e0os. Zhuangzi\u2019s notorious toying with the perspectives of\nanimals expanded it (for naturalists).\n.\n Gap-tooth asked\nKingsley, \u201cDo you know that which all natural kinds agree in\nsh\u00ecendorse-ing?\u201d He answers\n\u201cHow would I know that?\u201d \u201cThen, do you know of\nwhat you don\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cAnd how could I know\nthat?\u201d \u201cSo, does no natural kind know\nanything?\u201d \u201cAnd how would I know that? Nonetheless,\nlet me try to put it in language. How would I know that what I call\n\u2018knowing\u2019 is not not-knowing? And what I call\n\u2018not-knowing\u2019, is knowing.\u201d\n\nAnd let me try a question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they\nget pains and paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in\nfear; would monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to\nlive? \u2026 From where I see it, the origins of goodness and\nmorality, painting things as \u2018this/right\u2019 or\n\u2018not-that/wrong\u2019 are, as boundaries, both confused and\ncomplicated; how could I know how to distinguish them?\n(Ibid., HY 6/2/64\u201370)\n\n\nThis passage reinforces the conclusion that norms of correct word use\nis Zhuangzi\u2019s core skeptical target. So we may indeed know how\nto act, according to some norms of using \u2018know how\u2019 and\nnot if judged by some other d\u00e0o of correct usage of\nthe knowing/ignorant distinction. Linguistic skepticism easily\nmetastasizes to virtually any commitment. According to which\nd\u00e0o of projecting past practice should we\njudge this linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment or\nnot. Normative skepticism, in a use-theory is hard to\ncontain\u2014especially when the model of all judgments is as some indexed\n\u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that\nassignment. It sweeps in metaphysics, epistemics, and semantics.\n\nA consequence is that Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is broad but weak. Broad\nbecause it infects so many judgments, but weak not merely in the usual\nsense of denying absolute certainty, but in failing to imply that we\nshould stop or refuse to make the judgment. It does not rest on any\ntheory of the probability of an error, but that the concept of an\nerror is subject to the same concerns as the original judgment. It\nneither undermines nor give us reason to withdraw our\njudgments. Appreciating that others reach their views as naturally as\nwe do only removes our status to claim that our judgment is\nauthentically and uniquely correct. \nTemporally, Zhuangzi\u2019s\nskepticism is buttressed by reminding us of our own past experiences\nof learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had\nconsidered the way, was subject to reconsideration and\nimprovement. The skepticism does not target any specific failure in my\nepistemic process. It does not advise me to abandon my present\ncourse. It reminds me only to remain open to the further possibility\nof learning more\u2014about what? About the world? We can do that by\nlearning more about other natural ways of processing and how they work\nin the world\u2014other d\u00e0os.  It counts as\nskepticism because it reminds us that we normally err on the side of\noverestimating than underestimating our epistemic security. We think\nwe know and do not more often than we think we don\u2019t know and we\ndo. And that is because we underestimate the range of possible\nalternative d\u00e0os. Hence the pragmatic upshot of his\nskepticism is to remind us to engage with more other points of\nview.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is weak because it acknowledges that we\nmay apply different concepts of \u2018knowing\u2019 in different\nsituations. Implicitly, it does not deny that we could meet\nsome particular standard of knowing, but that we could know\nfor every situation which standard is the right one. What standard is\nthe right one to use for acknowledging or denying someone knows well\nenough to satisfy, for example, the correct d\u00e0o of\nassertion? \n\nThis feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism lies at the heart of the famous\ndebate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi about the fish-pleasure in which\nZhuangzi defends a claim to know against Hui Shi\u2019s\nchallenge. Zhuangzi makes an assertion and Hui Shi initiates the\nskeptical challenge. His challenge implies that there is a favored or\ncorrect standard of knowing that turns out to be impossibly\nstrict. All knowledge must come from inside. It\u2019s impossibly strict\nbecause it doesn\u2019t allow Hui Shi to issue the challenge in this\nconversation. \n\n  Zhuangzi and\nHui Shi wandered over the Hao River bridge. Zhuangzi said,\n\u201cthose mini-fish coming from there and cruising around, relaxed\nand unhurried, are fish at leisure.\u201d Hui Shi said \u201cYou are\nnot a fish; from whence do you know the leisure of fish?\u201d Zhuangzi\nretorted, \u201cYou are not me, from what perspective do you know my\nnot knowing fish at leisure?\u201d Hui Shi responds, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot you, of course I don\u2019t know about you; You are not a fish\nand that\u2019s enough to count as you\u2019re not knowing\nfish\u2019s leisure.\u201d Zhuangzi concludes, \u201cLet\u2019s\nreturn to where we started. When you said \u2018from what perspective\ndo you know fish at leisure\u2019, you clearly knew my knowing it as you\nasked me. I knew it here above the Hao.\u201d  (Ibid., HY\n\u00a045/17/87\u201391)\n \nGraham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this\npassage, noting that Hui Shi\u2019s challenge to Zhuangzi\u2019s assertion\ndoes not use the normal question form, (\u4f55\nh\u00e9how do you know?) but a locative question word\n(\u5b89 \u0101nwhence?). This brings the debate into\nalignment with Zhuangzi\u2019s concern about the various perspectives\nfrom which to deploy a d\u00e0o of word use. Here, as\n above, the word is \u77e5\nzh\u012bknow. The norm of asserting, as in\nEnglish, involves answering the challenge \u201chow do you\nknow?\u201d What normative conditions allow me, here and now,\ncorrectly to use the term zh\u012bknow\u2014hence\nto make the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew\nZhuangzi was relying on a d\u00e0o of using\n\u2018know\u2019 \u201cfrom zhuangzi\u2018s here\u201d and\nHui Shi knew Zhuangzi\u2019s situation from his own relevantly\nsimilar \u201chere-now\u201d and relying on the same \u9053\nd\u00e0onorm of claiming to know from a distinct\nperspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that a speaker can\nonly use \u77e5 zh\u012bknow when he\noccupies the perspective of the thing known.\n",
