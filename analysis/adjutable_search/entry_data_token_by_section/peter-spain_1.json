    "main_text": "Origins of Peter\u2019s Works on Logic\n2. Origins of Peter\u2019s Works on Logic\n\nPeter\u2019s logic seems to have its origin in the continental\ntradition. Evidence of the educational carreer of the\nTractatus appears from two commentaries (see De Rijk 1968,\npp. 23\u201334 and De Rijk (ed.) 1972, Introduction, pp. LXXff.),\nwhich contain short lemmata and a number of questions\n(questiones) together with their solutions. The tracts as\ncontained in these texts are very similar to the ones in the\nTractatus. The Tractatus has features that are\ntypical of the Paris tradition, such as the separate treatment of\nampliation, restriction and distribution, as well as several other\ndoctrinal elements (see De Rijk (ed.) 1972, pp.\nLXXXIV\u2013LXXXVIII). We do not know whether Peter had any\nconnection with Paris, nor can we say anything definitive about the\nidentity of his teachers. Earlier sources for Peter\u2019s works on\nlogic can be traced back to Boethian-Aristotelian logic, and\nauthorities in the field of grammar such as Priscian and Donatus.\n\nLike the Tractatus, the Syncategoreumata also\ndisplays a continental origin. It appears to have continued along the\nlines of a similar work by Johannes Pagus. This work, which has been\ndated between 1225 and 1235, was later on further developed by\nNicholas of Paris, who wrote his Syncategoreumata between\n1240 and 1250 (see Braakhuis 1979, Vol. I, p. 248).\n",
