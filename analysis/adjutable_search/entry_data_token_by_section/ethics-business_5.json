One way of advancing this project is by choosing a normative\nframework and teasing out its implications for business issues. In\nprinciple, it is possible to do this for any normative framework.\nBelow are four that have received significant attention.\n\nOne influential approach to business ethics draws on virtue ethics.\nMoore (2017) develops and applies MacIntyre\u2019s (1984) virtue\nethics to business. For MacIntyre, there are goods internal to\npractices, and certain virtues are necessary to achieve those goods.\nBuilding on MacIntyre, Moore develops the idea that business is a\npractice (or contains practices), and thus has certain goods internal\nto it (or them), the attainment of which requires the cultivation of\nbusiness virtues. Aristotelian approaches to virtue in business are\nfound in Alzola (2012) and de Bruin (2015). Scholars have also been\ninspired by the Aristotelian idea that the good life is achieved in a\ncommunity (Sison & Fontrodona 2012), and have considered how\nbusiness communities must be structured to help their members flourish\n(Hartman 2015; Solomon 1993).\n\nAnother important approach to the study of business ethics comes from\ndeontology, especially Kant\u2019s version (Arnold & Bowie 2003;\nBowie 2017; Scharding 2015; Hughes 2020). Kant\u2019s claim that\nhumanity should be treated always as an end, and never as a means\nonly, has proved especially fruitful for analyzing the human\ninteractions at the core of commercial transactions. In competitive\nmarkets, people may be tempted to deceive, cheat, use, exploit, or\nmanipulate others to gain an edge. Kantian moral theory singles out\nthese actions out as violations of human dignity (Hughes 2019; Smith\n& Dubbink 2011).\n\nEthical theory, including virtue theory and deontology, is useful for\nthinking about how individuals should relate to each other. But\nbusiness ethics also comprehends the laws and regulations that\nstructure markets and firms. Here political theory seems more\nrelevant. A number of business ethicists have sought to identify the\nimplications of Rawls\u2019s (1971) justice as fairness for business.\nThis is not an easy task, since while Rawls makes some suggestive\nremarks about markets and firms, he does not articulate specific\nconclusions or develop detailed arguments for them. But scholars have\nargued that justice as fairness: (1) is incompatible with significant\ninequalities of power and authority within firms (S. Arnold 2012); (2)\nrequires people to have an opportunity to perform meaningful work\n(Moriarty 2009; cf. Hasan 2015); and requires alternative forms of (3)\ncorporate governance (Berkey 2021; Blanc & Al-Amoudi 2013; Norman\n2015; cf. Singer 2015) and (4) corporate ownership (M. O\u2019Neill\n& Williamson 2012).\n\nA fourth approach to business ethics is called the \u201cmarket\nfailures approach\u201d (MFA). It originates with McMahon (1981), but\nit has been developed in most detail by Heath (2014) (for discussion\nsee Moriarty 2020 and Singer 2018). According to Heath, the\njustification of the market is that it produces efficient\u2014in the\nsense of Pareto-optimal\u2014 outcomes. But this only happens when\nthe conditions of perfect competition obtain, such as perfect\ninformation, no market power, and no barriers to entry or exit. (When\nthey don\u2019t, markets fail\u2014hence the market failures\napproach.) On the MFA, these conditions are the source of ethical\nrules for market actors. The MFA says that market actors, including\nsellers and buyers, should not create or take advantage of market\nimperfections. So, for example, firms should not deceive consumers\n(creating information asymmetries) or lobby governments to levy\ntariffs on foreign competitors (erecting barriers to entry).\n\nSelecting a normative framework and applying it to a range of issues\nis an important way of doing business ethics. But it is not the only\nway. Indeed, the more common approach is to identify a business\nactivity and then analyze it using \u201cmid-level\u201d principles\nor ideals common to many moral and political theories. Below I\nconsider ethical issues that arise at the nexus of firms\u2019\nengagement with three important groups: consumers, employees, and\nsociety.\n",
