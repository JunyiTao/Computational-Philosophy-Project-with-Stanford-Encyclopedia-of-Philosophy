    "main_text": "Dominant Kinds\n5. Dominant Kinds\n\nIn the previous section, we examined various ways of resisting the\nfirst premise of our original argument\u2014the claim that\nDavid did not exist on Monday. Let us now turn our attention\nto the second premise: Lump did exist on Monday.\nEliminativists like Unger and van Inwagen will reject this premise,\nsince they deny the existence of objects like Lump. But there are\nother accounts that reject this premise as well. One such theory is\nthe dominant kind view defended by Michael Burke (1994,\n1997a, 1997b).\n\nBurke begins with the assumption that there is a single object present\non Tuesday. For the moment, let us call this object \u201cRex\u201d.\nBurke assumes that Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue. This is a\nperfectly natural assumption, but it is also problematic. As we have\nseen, kinds are associated with different persistence conditions. For\nexample, unlike the kind statue, the kind lump of\nclay is associated with the property of being able to survive\nsquashing. Now consider the following principle: for any object\no and kind K, if o is a K, then\no has the persistence conditions associated with K.\n(Burke 1994, p. 598) If this principle is correct, then we have a\nproblem. Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue, so the principle\ntells us that it is able to survive squashing and that it is not.\nBurke concludes that the proposed principle is false\u2014it is\npossible for an object to be a K without having the\npersistence conditions associated with that kind. In particular, Burke\nclaims that Rex is a statue and a lump of clay, but it only has the\npersistence conditions associated with one of those kinds. Which one?\nBurke answers that, in general, an object has the persistence\nconditions associated with its dominant kind. What is a\ndominant kind? Burke answers that, in general, an object\u2019s\ndominant kind is the kind that \u201centails possession of the widest\nrange of properties\u201d (Burke 1994, p. 607). For example, if\nsomething is a lump of clay, then it must have certain\nphysical properties. If something is a statue, on the other\nhand, then it must have both physical and aesthetic\nproperties. In this sense, statue entails a wider range of\nproperties than lump of clay. Hence, statue\ndominates lump of clay. Rex therefore has the persistence\nconditions associated with the kind statue. Rex, in other\nwords, is just David. What about Lump? In the original story, the name\n\u2018Lump\u2019 is introduced for the lump of clay that exists on\nMonday. At that point there was no statue, so Lump\u2019s dominant\nkind is simply lump of clay. Let us now introduce the name\n\u2018Lump*\u2019 for the lump of clay that exists on Tuesday. The\nlump of clay that exists on Tuesday is also a statue (Lump* is David,\ni.e., Rex), so Lump*\u2019s dominant kind is statue. Hence,\nLump \u2260 Lump*. On Burke\u2019s view, the process of sculpting a\nlump of clay into a statue destroys one object (a mere lump of clay)\nand replaces it with another (a statue). The resulting statue is also\na lump of clay, but it is numerically distinct from the lump of clay\nwith which we began. Burke concludes that Lump exists on Monday, but\ndoes not exist on Tuesday. Hence, the second premise of the original\nargument is false.\n\nThe dominant kinds view has several advantages over the eliminativist\naccounts. Most notably, the dominant kinds view recognizes the\nexistence of ordinary objects like statues and lumps of clay and\nallows for these objects to gain and lose parts. However, some of the\nobjections raised in previous sections apply to Burke\u2019s view as\nwell. For example, the anthropic objection from section 2 can also be\nraised against the dominant kinds view (Sider 2001, p. 165). In\naddition, the view faces problems of its own.\n\nFirst, there is the objection from commonsense. According to Burke,\nsculptors can destroy lumps of clay by doing nothing more than\nreshaping them in accordance with certain artistic intentions. In\nfact, given certain theories of what constitutes an artwork, the\nsculptor doesn\u2019t even have to do that much. Suppose that an\nartist takes a liking to a particular rock in his yard. He gives it\nthe title Rocky and invites art critics to admire his new\nwork of art. If this is all it takes to create an artpiece, then this\nis all it takes to destroy a rock. After all, the rock at the\nbeginning of the story has piece of rock as its dominant\nkind, while the rock at the end has piece of art as its\ndominant kind. Hence, the latter rock is numerically distinct from the\nformer\u2014the original rock is no more. This seems absurd. Burke\nreplies by appealing to ambiguity (1994, 596\u20137). According to\nhim, \u2018the rock\u2019 could denote the rock (a singular\nobject) or the rocky stuff (the matter that constitutes that\nobject). On the first reading, the rock from the beginning of the\nstory is not the same as the rock at the end (since there is\na new dominant kind). But, on the second reading, the rock from the\nbeginning of the story is the same as the rock at the end\n(since it is the same matter throughout). Burke claims that this is\nenough to satisfy the demands of commonsense. (For more on mass terms\nand the distinction between stuff and things, see the entry on\n the metaphysics of mass expressions.)\n\nA second problem concerns Burke\u2019s account of dominance. Burke\nclaims that one kind dominates another when it entails a wider range\nof properties. This seems to get the current case correct, for there\nis a natural sense in which statue entails a wider range of\nproperties than lump of clay. But other cases are less clear.\nTake, for example, the case of a performance artist who poses his own\nbody to form a statue. The relevant object is both a person and a\nstatue. The kind statue entails having certain aesthetic\nproperties, but does not entail having any mental properties. The kind\nperson arguably entails having certain mental properties, but\ndoes not entail having any aesthetic properties. But, in that case,\nneither kind dominates the other, so Burke\u2019s account seems\nincomplete. (For further discussion of this worry, see Rea 2000.)\n\nA final problem for the dominant kinds view is that it cannot be\nextended to all cases of constitution. For example, in the Ship of\nTheseus case, we seem to have two ships in the same place at the same\ntime. Since there is a single kind at issue in that case, the\nquestion of dominance does not arise and Burke\u2019s account cannot\nhelp. (For further examples of this kind, see Fine 2000.)\n",
