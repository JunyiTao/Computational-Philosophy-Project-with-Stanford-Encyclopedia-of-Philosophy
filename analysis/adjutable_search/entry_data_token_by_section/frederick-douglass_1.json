    "main_text": "Natural Law\n2. Natural Law\n\nThe ideas that Douglass drew on in his arguments against slavery\noriginate from natural law theory and Christian theology. Douglass was\nan Enlightenment thinker, a nineteenth-century modernist, and a\nProtestant, so natural law in his view was a combination of the\nprescriptions of reason and revelation evident in\nthe historical and civilizational progress of humanity. One of his\nclearest articulations of this combined view is from a 1853 speech,\n\u201cThe Present Condition And Future Prospects of the Negro\nPeople\u201d (1853b [FDSW: 250\u2013259]), where condemns\ndeclares,\n\n\nSlavery has no means within itself of perpetuation or permanence. It\nis a huge lie. It is of the Devil, and it will go to its place. It is\nagainst nature, against progress, against improvement, and against the\nGovernment of God. It cannot stand. It has an enemy in every bar of\nrailroad iron, in every electric wire, in every improvement in\nnavigation, in the growing intercourse of nations, in cheap postage,\nin the relaxation of tariffs, in common schools, in the progress of\neducation, the spread of knowledge, in the steam engine, and in the\nWorld\u2019s Fair\u2026and in everything that will be exhibited\nthere. (1853b [FDSW:\n 259])[12]\n\n\nThe sources for his driving belief in natural law and its\nmoral implications were many: the founding documents of the United\nStates; popular intellectuals, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and his\ncolleagues and acquaintances in the American Abolition movement; the\nallies he encountered abroad; and his appreciation of George\nCombe\u2019s The Constitution of Man, from 1834 (Van Wyhe\n2004). However, given the numerous religious references in his\nspeeches and writings, a primary source for his employment of the idea\nof natural law was his adaptation of the American Protestantism of the\nSecond Great Awakening, with its democratic and republican values and\ngenerally independent spirit. All of this is on prominent display at\nthe conclusion of his famous speech, \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth\nfor the Negro\u201d:\n\n\nThe arm of the Lord is not shortened\u201c, and the doom of slavery\nis certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While\ndrawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great\nprinciples it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my\nspirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. (1852\n[SFD: 90])\n\n\nRelying on the deus ex machina was not enough for Douglass.\nHis vision of natural rights involved action; his image of civic\nrepublicanism emphasized the need for active participation to claim or\nearn one\u2019s rights and status as a citizen (Davis 1971; Pettit\n1997; Myers 2008; Gooding-Williams 2009). As Douglass scathingly\npointed out, the slave-holding states resisted the abolition of\nslavery, and many Americans were apathetic about its cruel\ninjustices\u2014humans resist providential justice. Therefore, he\nargued, the end of slavery required agitation, protest, and, if\nneeded, military intervention.\n\nDouglass longed for God to cast his thunderbolts of judgment at\nAmerican slave power, but he knew that human action was needed to\nabolish slavery in America (Blight 1989: 26\u201358). His view of, if\nyou will, enacted providence is on full display at the end of\nhis famous Fourth of July speech of 1852, where he cited Psalm 68:31\nand paired the idea of God\u2019s fiat with the image of Africa and\nAsia rising:\n\n\nThe far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet.\nThe Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat\nof the Almighty, \u201dLet there be Light\u201c, has not yet spent\nits force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice,\ncan now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and\ncrippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa\nmust rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \u201dEthiopia shall\nstretch out her hand unto God\u201c. (1852 [SFD:\n 91])[13]\n\n\nThere are many possible concerns about Douglass\u2019s view of\nnatural law, manifest destiny, and providence, which we can discern\nfrom a careful reading of the passage above; they involve a belief in\nhistorical teleological development and the human costs of that\nassumption. These costs include affirming nineteenth-century\nconceptions of civilizational backwardness of non-European societies\nor peoples. Thus, he is relatively silent about the United\nStates\u2019 destructive actions against indigenous peoples.\n\nThis aspect of Douglass\u2019s views led Wilson Jeremiah Moses to\ncharacterize him and other early black political figures as\n\u201dMoses\u201c figures: exodus leaders, recipients of natural law\nfor a chosen people. The chosen people, in this case, are African\nAmericans in their travail for freedom, as well as the American\nRepublic as a whole. Douglass\u2014twinned eternally with Abraham\nLincoln\u2014is a lawgiver in the American civil religion (Moses\n1978). This monumental, world-historical vita aside,\nDouglass\u2019s faith in progress, although tested to its breaking\npoint, resulted in his putting too much belief in the inevitability of\nprogress. Nonetheless, his faith had a moral, social, and political\npurpose. He had no time for political pessimism, which is either a\nnarcotizing sentiment for those who have surrendered to despair or a\nperformative luxury whose decadence only those secure in their liberty\ncan afford.\n",
