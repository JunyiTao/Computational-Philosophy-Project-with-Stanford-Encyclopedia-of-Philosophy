    "main_text": "Constitutive Aim\n6. Constitutive Aim\n\nThe question of what, if anything, is the constitutive (or formal) aim\n(or end) of intentional actions is a question about whether there is\nanything that all actions necessarily pursue, irrespective of their\nparticular ends. Some philosophers (Setiya 2016b) deny that there is a\nconstitutive aim of acting or that there is something that every\naction as such aims at. On this view, there is no such thing as an aim\ncontained in acting as such; each action just aims at its particular\nend. On the other hand, many philosophers try to derive important\nconsequences for ethics from the idea that action or agency has a\nconstitutive aim. However, we will leave aside the examinations of\nthese claims and focus only on the question as it pertains to the\ncharacterization of agency. (Cf. Bagnoli 2017; 2022.)\n",
