    "main_text": "Varieties of Evidentialism || Epistemic evidentialism\n5.3 Epistemic evidentialism\n\nBy far the most influential and widespread variety of Evidentialism is\nepistemic (see Chisholm 1957, Adler 2002, Conee and Feldman 2004, Shah\n2006). The central thesis of epistemic Evidentialism is that the norms\nof evidence governing belief are somehow based in the nature and aims\nof theoretical reason itself. To believe on insufficient evidence is\nat bottom an epistemic failure\u2014a failure to use our\ncognitive faculties in such a way that we are likely to acquire\nsignificant knowledge and avoid significant unjustified belief. Some\nphilosophers in this tradition also defend Locke's proportionality\nthesis according to which our degree of belief must be in proportion\nto the strength of our evidence (see White 2005). \n\nA major challenge facing proponents of epistemic Evidentialism is to\nfind an adequate motivation for it: if there are not sufficient\nprudential or moral grounds for the obligation to believe on\nsufficient evidence, then what is the source of its normativity? In\nresponse to the challenge, epistemic Evidentialists take a number of\ndifferent tacks. Some argue that the norms are underwritten by\nnecessary, conceptual truths. On this view, the very concept\nof belief reveals that it is a truth-aimed attitude that is only\nproperly formed on the basis of sufficient evidence in the possession\nof the subject. Thus an attitude that is not formed in this way is\neither not a genuine belief at all, or at best a deficient instance of\nit (see Adler 2002, Textor 2004).\n\nOther epistemic Evidentialists argue that doxastic norms arise not\nfrom analysis of the concept of belief, but rather from reflection on\nthe fact that our belief-forming faculties are simply set up to be\nsensitive to evidence. The faculties of perception, memory, testimony,\nintrospection, reasoning, and so on, typically generate beliefs on the\nbasis of sufficient evidence, and we usually regard these faculties as\nmalfunctioning, maladjusted, or misused when they generate beliefs in\nother ways. Pieces of apparent evidence\u2014epistemic reasons,\nbroadly-speaking\u2014reliably provide us with important information\nabout the world, and we have evolved to be sensitive to such reasons\nin our quest to survive and flourish.\n\nNote that the epistemic Evidentialist does not hold that the\nacquisition of significant truth\u2014even truth that promotes\nsurvival\u2014is the only relevant consideration in this region: our\nbelief-forming faculties are not mere thermometers or\nmotion-detectors. The idea is rather that, as evidence-sensitive\nbelievers, we don't merely want to believe significant\ntruths; rather, we want to have good grounds for taking propositions\nto be true, and to base our belief on those grounds (Feldman 2000;\nthough again see David 2001). This putative fact is then taken to\nunderwrite a norm: we ought to seek not just true belief but\nknowledge, or, more specifically, we ought to seek\nwidespread significant knowledge without widespread significant\nerror. To seek knowledge in this way is, among other things, to\nseek to have sufficient evidence for true beliefs and to base them on\nthat evidence.\n\nAnother kind of defense of epistemic Evidentialism says that the\ncentral Evidentialist principle\u2014that we ought to believe on the\nbasis of sufficient evidence that is in our possession\u2014is not an\nanalytic truth drawn from the concept of belief, and not a\n\u2018functional norm\u2019 arising from reflection on the way our\nfaculties are set up or designed, but rather a synthetic principle\nthat we simply rationally intuit in the course of reflecting on\nconcepts and thought-experiments. This approach seems coherent and in\nsome ways attractive, though it has not found many defenders in the\nliterature.\n",
