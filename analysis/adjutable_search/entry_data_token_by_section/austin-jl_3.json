    "main_text": "Language and Truth || Speech Acts and Truth\n2.3 Speech Acts and Truth\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll consider some aspects of Austin\u2019s\ntreatment of speech acts\u2014things done with words (the main\nsources here are: 1962b, 1956b, and 1963; see also 1946: 97\u2013103,\n1950a: 130\u2013133, 1953). The topics we\u2019ll consider are the\nfollowing.\n\n(1) In his work on\nspeech acts, Austin presents a different reason for why sentences,\ngiven their meanings, do not combine with the facts to determine\ntruth-values. The second reason is based on the fact that any sentence\ncan be used in performing a variety of linguistic acts. Although in\nstating, we typically produce statements that are assessable as true\nor false, in performing other linguistic acts, we need not produce\nthings that are assessable in that way. The second reason depends,\nthen, on two sub-claims: first, that whether a sentence is used on an\noccasion to make a statement\u2014more generally, something\ntruth-assessable\u2014is dependent on more than just what it means;\nsecond, that some uses of sentences to perform linguistic acts other\nthan the making of statements are not properly assessable as true or\nfalse.\n(2)\nConnected with (1) is Austin\u2019s discussion of a distinction\nbetween constative utterances\u2014broadly, utterances of a\ntype suitable to be appraised as to truth\u2014and performative\nutterances\u2014broadly, utterances that are suitable only for\nother forms of appraisal (1962b: 1\u201393).\n(3)\nIn\naddition to discussing the putative constative-performative\ndistinction, Austin sketches a distinction amongst speech act types,\nbetween locutionary acts, illocutionary acts, and\nperlocutionary acts\u2014broadly, the distinction between\nsaying anything at all, saying something with a specific force (e.g.,\nmaking a statement, asking a question, making a request), and the\nfurther effects of saying something with a specific force (e.g.,\ngetting an audience to believe something, getting them to tell you\nsomething, or getting them to do what you request). The need to draw\nsuch a distinction is now very widely accepted and probably amounts to\nAustin\u2019s central contribution to more recent work (1962b:\n83\u2013164).\n(4)\n\nAustin makes some cryptic suggestions about the wider significance of\nhis discussion of topic (3), concerning their bearing on, for example,\nwhat he calls \u201cthe true/false fetish\u201d and \u201cthe\nvalue/fact fetish\u201d (1962b: 148\u2013164).\n\n\nA topic that has figured in some recent discussions, but that we\nwon\u2019t discuss here, is this:\n\n(5)In\nthe course of discussing his main topics, Austin sometimes makes use\nof a distinction between serious and non-serious\nuses of language, and suggests that non-serious uses of language are\nderivative from serious uses. (Roughly, the distinction is a\ngeneralisation of distinctions between genuine assertions and mock\nassertions in fiction or on the stage. See e.g., Austin 1962b: 104.)\nJacques Derrida challenged the standing of the distinction and the\npriority that Austin seemed to accord to some of what he counted as\nserious uses. John Searle responded to Derrida and the issue has\nbecome a source of some attempts at engagement between those\nsympathetic to Searle\u2019s more \u201cAnalytic\u201d approaches\nto issues in this area and those sympathetic to more\n\u201cContinental\u201d approaches. (See Derrida 1977 and Searle\n1977. For recent discussion of aspects of the controversy see de\nGaynesford 2009, A.W. Moore 2000, Richmond 1996, Ricks 1992.)\n\n\nAustin presents the second reason for why sentences do not conspire\nwith the facts to determine truth-values in considering whether there\nis a useful distinction to be drawn between (indicative) sentences\nthat are used to make statements\u2014which Austin labels\nconstatives\u2014and sentences that are useable in the\nperformance of some act\u2014which Austin labels\nperformatives (or sometimes performatory)\n (topic (2) above).[17]\n Austin\u2019s opening list of examples of putative performatives\nincludes: \u201cI take \u2026 to be my lawfully wedded\n\u2026\u201d\u2014as uttered in the course of the marriage\nceremony; \u201cI name this ship the Queen\nElizabeth\u201d\u2014as uttered when smashing a bottle against\nthe stern; \u201cI give and bequeath my watch to my\nbrother\u201d\u2014as occurring in a will; \u201cI bet you sixpence\nit will rain tomorrow\u201d (1962b: 5). About these examples, Austin\nwrites:\n\n\nIn these examples it seems clear that to utter the sentence (in, of\ncourse, the appropriate circumstances) is not to describe my\ndoing of what I should be said in so uttering to be doing\u2026[fn.\nStill less anything that I have already done or have yet to\ndo.]\u2026or to state that I am doing it. None of the utterances\ncited is either true or false: I assert this as obvious and do not\nargue it. (1962b: 6)\n\n\nAustin is sometimes read as seeking to defend this view of\nperformatives. However, four features of his presentation suggest that\nhis view is not so straightforward. First, Austin presents the issue\nas concerning the classification by use of utterances of types of\nsentence, and we have already seen that he is in general\nsceptical about alleged associations between sentences and their\noccasional uses. Second, Austin fails here, and elsewhere, to offer\nserious arguments for his assertion that none of the cited utterances\nis either true or false. Third, Austin\u2019s assertion is made using\nthe apparently performative form, \u201cI assert \u2026\n\u201d\u2014a form that appears, moreover, to falsify the\ngeneralisation that performatives lack truth-values. Finally, Austin\nissues the following warning in a footnote, two pages earlier:\n\u201cEverything said in these sections is provisional, and subject\nto revision in the light of later sections\u201d (1962b: 4 fn.1).\n\nAustin goes on to discuss two apparently quite different modes of\nassessment for utterances of the two apparently different types.\nConstatives, as already noted, are assessed along the dimension of\ntruth and falsehood. By contrast, performatives are assessed along\ndimensions of happiness and unhappiness, or\nfelicity and infelicity. Taking the example of an\nutterance of \u201cI take \u2026 to be my lawfully wedded \u2026\n\u201d, and simplifying Austin\u2019s discussion, there are two main\nsorts of unhappiness, or infelicity, to which this performative is\nliable. First, there are misfires:\n\n\n\u2026if we\u2026utter the formula incorrectly, or if\u2026we\nare not in a position to do the act because we are\u2026married\nalready, or it is the purser and not the captain who is conducting the\nceremony, then the act in question, \u2026marrying, is not\nsuccessfully performed at all, \u2026[it] is not achieved. (1962b:\n15\u201316)\n\n\nSecond, there are abuses: in these cases, the act is\nperformed, but insincerely, perhaps for example in instituting a\nmarriage of convenience.\n\nIt\u2019s important to see that, even if it were true, in general,\nthat some things done using performatives\u2014e.g., marrying,\nnaming, bequeathing, and betting\u2014are neither true nor false, but\nrather are subject to assessment as happy or unhappy, it would not\nfollow that truth is out of the picture. That would depend, not only\non the basic claim that actions of those types per se are not\ntrue or false, but also on the claim that particular actions of those\ntypes are not also of other types that are assessable as true\nor false. And Austin recognised that actions can be of more than one\ntype (or, perhaps, that distinct actions might be performed\nsimultaneously):\n\n\nTo say that I believe you \u2018is\u2019 on occasion to accept your\nstatement; but it is also to make an assertion, which is not made by\nthe strictly performatory utterance \u201cI accept your\nstatement\u201d. (1950a: 133)\n\n\nIn the examples that Austin cites, things are done that are not\nassessable as true or false\u2014marrying, naming, betting, etc. But\nas Austin points out, those examples might also involve other things\nbeing done\u2014e.g., the making of statements\u2014that are, or\ninvolve things that are, assessable as true or false. However, even\nthough this undermines Austin\u2019s provisional characterisation of\nperformatives, the possibility that we might sometimes do more than\none thing in using a performative puts pressure on the idea that there\nis a simple connection between sentences and the various things we do\nin using them.\n\nI\u2019ve suggested that Austin\u2019s view of the putative\ndistinction between performatives and constatives is less\nstraightforward than it might at first seem. And the structure of\nAustin (1962b) bears out that assessment. Although much of the book\nseems to be devoted to pursuit of a distinction between performatives\nand constatives, none of the attempts succeeds. It is possible, but\nimplausible, that in the course of the lectures Austin found that he\nwas unable to draw a distinction that he thought should be drawn. A\nmore plausible interpretation is that Austin\u2019s purpose is not to\ndraw such a distinction. Rather it is to argue\u2014through the\nfailures of various attempts to draw the distinction\u2014that there\nis no such simple distinction\u2014no sorting of sentences into those\napt for performative, and those apt for constative, use.\n\nAustin argues against the distinction by appeal to the fact that the\nsame forms of assessment are applicable to utterances apparently of\nboth sorts:\n\n\n\u2026unhappiness\u2026seems to characterize both kinds of\nutterance, not merely the performative; and\u2026the requirement of\nconforming or bearing some relation to the facts, different in\ndifferent cases, seems to characterize performatives\u2026 (1962b:\n91)\n\n\nAttempts to make a statement are liable both to misfires and abuses.\nFor example, an attempt to make a statement using \u201cFrance is\nhexagonal\u201d might misfire if there were no such country as\nFrance, or (as discussed above) if no suitable intents and purposes\nwere manifest (1962b: 47\u201352). And an attempt might be an abuse\nif the speaker failed to believe that France was hexagonal. Attempts\nat performative utterance are liable to assessment either in terms of\ntruth or falsehood, or in terms similarly dependent on conformity with\nthe facts: my utterance of \u201cI warn you that the bull is about to\ncharge\u201d may be liable to criticism as mistaken rather\nthan unhappy if the bull is not about to charge (1962b: 55). More\ngenerally, it is often impossible to decide, just from the words a\nspeaker uses, whether their utterance is susceptible to one or another\nform of assessment. And there are cases like \u201cI state that\n\u2026\u201d which seem to satisfy all formal and lexical\nrequirements for being performative, and yet are used in utterances\n\u201c\u2026which surely are the making of statements, and surely\nare essentially true or false\u201d (1962b: 91). (Austin\u2019s\nideas here also bear on\n topic (4) above.)\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s views about performative utterances,\nsee Bach 1975; G. Bird 1981; Black 1963; Cohen 1964, 1974; Forguson\n1966; Heal 1974; Hornsby 1988, 2006; Jack 1981; Lemmon 1962; Lewis\n1972; Schiffer 1972; Sinnott-Armstrong 1994; Tsohatzidis 2018; Urmson 1977; Warnock\n1973b, 1989: 105\u2013151.)\n\nFrom the wreckage of the initial distinction, Austin assembles a new\nmodel\n (topic (3) above).\n The new model is founded on distinctions among various kinds of thing\nspeakers do\u2014various acts they perform\u2014when they\nproduce an utterance.\n\nThe locutionary act: the production of an utterance that\ncan be classified by its phonetic, grammatical, and lexical\ncharacteristics, up to sentence meaning (the phatic act). It\nis also the performance of an act that can be classified by its\ncontent (the rhetic act)\u2014a feature\ndistinctively of acts of speech. If I promise that I\u2019ll be\nhome for dinner and then promise that I\u2019ll work\nlate, my actions are instances of two different locutionary acts:\none with the content that I\u2019ll be home for dinner, and one with\nthe content that I\u2019ll work late (1962b: 94\u201398).\n The illocutionary act: an act classifiable not only by\nits content\u2014as with the locutionary act\u2014but also by its\nforce (stating, warning, promising, etc.). If I\npromise that I\u2019ll be home for dinner and later\nstate that I\u2019ll be home for dinner, my actions are\ninstances of the same locutionary act: both actions involve the\ncontent that I\u2019ll be home for dinner. However, my actions are\ninstances of different illocutionary acts: one has the force of a\npromise, while the other has the force of a statement (1962b:\n98\u2013101).\n The perlocutionary act: an act classifiable by its\n\u201c \u2026 consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or\nactions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons\n\u2026 \u201d. If I warn that the ice is thin, and so perform one\nillocutionary act, I may thereby perform a variety of perlocutionary\nacts: I may persuade someone to avoid it, or\nencourage someone to take a risk, and so forth (1962b:\n101).\n\n\nAustin\u2019s interest in the types of act so distinguished was\n\u201c\u2026essentially to fasten on the second, illocutionary act\nand contrast it with the other two\u2026\u201d (1962b: 103). What\ndid Austin think was important about the illocutionary act? And what\ndid he think were the dangers inherent in failing to mark it off from\nthe other types?\n\nAustin appears to have thought that the various modes of assessment\nthat he discusses\u2014e.g., true/false, happy/unhappy\u2014apply\nmost fundamentally to the illocutionary act, rather than the\nlocutionary or the perlocutionary\n act.[18]\n One point is that Austin thought that philosophers have had a\ntendency to view some assessments as to happiness (or felicity) as\nreally applying to perlocutionary acts, so as not bearing on the\nspecifically linguistic things that speakers are up to. Another\npoint\u2014and perhaps the point of primary importance\u2014is that\nAustin thought that philosophers have had a tendency to view\nassessments as to truth as applying most fundamentally to locutionary\nacts. Moreover, he thought that philosophers had conceived locutionary\nacts, not as abstractions from illocutionary acts, but rather as\nthings that might be done without any illocutionary purpose, just by\nvirtue of the linguistic expressions employed or their meanings. By\ncontrast, Austin held that locutionary acts are abstracted from\ninstances of illocutionary acts, and that assessment as to truth is\ndirected most fundamentally to the illocutionary act. (We\u2019ll\nconsider below a stronger and a weaker reading of the idea that\nassessment as to truth applies most fundamentally to the illocutionary\nact.)\n\nFor Austin, then, assessment as to truth is of a piece with various\nforms of assessment as to happiness, etc., and like those forms it is\nthe assessment of an act with respect to its goodness or badness. Thus\nAustin\u2019s discussion of illocutionary acts is bound up with his\nother discussions of the ways in which assessment of utterances as to\ntruth is dependent upon specific features of the circumstances of\nutterance. He writes:\n\n\nThe truth or falsity of statements is affected by what they leave out\nor put in and by their being misleading, and so on. Thus, for example,\ndescriptions, which are said to be true or false or, if you like, are\n\u201cstatements\u201d, are surely liable to these criticisms, since\nthey are selective and uttered for a purpose. It is essential to\nrealize that \u201ctrue\u201d and false\u2019, like\n\u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunfree\u201d, do not stand for anything\nsimple at all; but only for a general dimension of being a right and\nproper thing to say as opposed to a wrong thing, in these\ncircumstances, to this audience, for these purposes and with these\nintentions. (1962b: 144\u2013145)\n\n\nAccording to Austin, there is more involved in any such assessment\nthan a simple comparison of requirements imposed by linguistic meaning\nwith the facts. Reflection on the assessment of actions in which we\nspeak and the speech acts that classify them indicates two things:\nfirst, the distinction between assessment as to happiness and\nassessment as to truth is ultimately unprincipled; and, second, some\nmixture of various types of assessment applies to all, or nearly all,\nutterances. These ideas appear to be the basis for a cryptic claim of\nAustin\u2019s\n (mentioned above as topic (4)).\n Exploiting the various modes of appraisal to distinguish five very\ngeneral classes of speech act verbs, Austin writes that\n\n\nThey are\u2026quite enough to play Old Harry with two fetishes which\nI admit to an inclination to play Old Harry with, viz. (1) the\ntrue/false fetish, (2) the value/fact fetish. (1962b: 151)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s cryptic suggestion appears to be to the effect that, in\none or another way, classifications of utterances along the true-false\ndimension, or according to whether they are expressions of fact or\nexpressions of value, is\u2014for at least some purposes\u2014too\ncrude. The suggestion is susceptible of a weaker and a stronger\nreading. On the weaker reading, the suggestion is to the effect that,\nwhen the assessment of an utterance is at issue, it is\nessential to consider the force or forces that attach to the\nillocutionary act or acts thereby performed. Since various such acts\nmay have been performed, and since assessment of each act involves\nconsideration of a mix of facts and values, there is no clean way of\nsorting utterances on the basis either of whether or not their primary\nmode of assessment is on the true-false dimension, or of whether their\nprimary function is the expression of fact, rather than the expression\nof value. That leaves open that, with respect to at least some speech\nacts, a locutionary core\u2014a proposition, or propositions, or\npropositional-like element\u2014may be assessed in a way that makes\nno reference to force, for example, along the true-false dimension. On\nthe stronger reading, the claim would be that it is not possible to\ndetach a locutionary core from the force with which it is expressed in\nsuch a way that that core can be assessed without reference to force.\nOn its stronger reading, Austin\u2019s suggestion would have to\ncontend with an aspect of what is known as the Frege-Geach\nproblem: the challenge of explaining logical connections amongst\nspeech acts with different forces where those connections appear to\ndepend upon their sharing (elements of) a locutionary core (see Geach\n1965).\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s distinction amongst locutionary,\nillocutionary, and perlocutionary acts see Bach 1975; Bach and Harnish\n1979; G.
