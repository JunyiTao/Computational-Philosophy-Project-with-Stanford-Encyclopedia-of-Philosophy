    "main_text": "Correctness and Imitation (421c\u2013427d) || Indicating by Imitating\n7.1 Indicating by Imitating\n\nSocrates assumes that etymologically simple names must meet the same\nstandard as etymologically complex names: They need to \u201cindicate\nwhat each of the beings is like\u201d (422d)\u2014which turns out to\nmean that they need to indicate the being of their referents (423e).\nHe argues that etymologically simple names can only meet this standard\nby imitating the being of their referents (422e\u2013423e).\nAnd thus, he arrives at this augmented version of\n (NAT*),\n his earlier account of the correctness of etymologically complex\nnames:\n\n(NAT**)\nIf an etymologically complex name is a correct name for a given\nkind, this is because its etymological meaning ensures that it\ndescribes and thus indicates the way of being (ousia) that\nthe members of this kind share; and if an etymologically simple name\nis a correct name for a given kind, this is because its composition\nfrom letters and syllables ensures that it imitates and thus indicates\nthe way of being that the members of this kind share.\n\n\n(NAT**)\n is a full-fledged, completely general theory of the correctness of\nnames. The most pressing question raised by this theory is probably\nhow exactly the imitation of a way of being by means of letters and\nsyllables is supposed to work. Socrates\u2019 answer to this question\npresupposes that individual letters or individual syllables resemble\nthe basic kinds of beings (424d\u2013425a); he takes this to ensure\nthat a combination of different letters and syllables can\nresemble\u2014and thus imitate\u2014any given way of being. Note\nthat Socrates does not take the resemblance between letters and\nsyllables on the one hand and the basic kinds of beings on the other\nhand to depend on the sound of these letters and syllables, but on the\nway in which the mouth and the tongue move in articulating them. For\nhim, imitation is not onomatopoetic, but \u201carticulatory\u201d\n(Ademollo 2011: 309\u2013311; cf. Belardi 1985: 33).\n\nSocrates\u2019 theory of the correctness of etymologically simple\nnames has its problems and omissions; it does not take into account,\ne.g., that the mimetic qualities of a name would probably not only\ndepend on the letters and syllables from which it is composed, but\nalso on the way in which these letters and syllables are arranged\n(Barney 2001: 105 n. 31). Characterizing etymologically simple names\nas imitations is nevertheless an ingenious attempt at filling the\nexplanatory gap left by\n (NAT*).\n",
