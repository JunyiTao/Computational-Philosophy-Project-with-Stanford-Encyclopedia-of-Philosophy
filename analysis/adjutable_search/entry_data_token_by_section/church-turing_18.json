    "main_text": "Other Approaches to Computability || Hilbert and Bernays\n3.3 Hilbert and Bernays\n\nIn 1939, in Volume II of their titanic work Grundlagen der\nMathematik (Foundations of Mathematics), Hilbert and Bernays\nproposed a logic-based analysis of effectiveness. According to this\nanalysis, effectively calculable numerical functions are numerical\nfunctions that can be evaluated in what they called a\n\u201cregelrecht\u201d manner (Hilbert & Bernays 1939:\n392\u2013421). In this context, the German word\n\u201cregelrecht\u201d can be translated\n\u201crule-governed\u201d. Hilbert and Bernays offered the concept\nof the rule-governed evaluation of a numerical function as a\n\u201csharpening of the concept of computable\u201d (1939: 417).\n\nThe basic idea is this: To evaluate a numerical function (such as\naddition or multiplication) in a rule-governed way is to calculate the\nvalues of the function, step by logical step, in a suitable deductive\nlogical system. On this approach, effective calculability is analysed\nas calculability in a logic. (Both Church and Turing had\npreviously discussed the approach\u2014see\n Section 4.4.)\n\nThe logical system Hilbert and Bernays used to flesh out this idea was\nan equational calculus, reminiscent of a calculus that\nG\u00f6del had detailed in lectures he gave in Princeton in 1934\n(G\u00f6del 1934). The theorems of an equational calculus are (as the\nname says) equations\u2014for example \\(2^3 = 8\\) and \\(x^2\n+ 1 = x(x + 1) - (x - 1),\\) or in general \\(\\mathrm{f}(m) = n.\\) The\nHilbert-Bernays equational calculus contains no logical symbols (such\nas negation, conjunction, implication, or quantifiers), and every\nformula is simply an equation between terms. Three types of equation\nare permitted as the initial formulae (or premisses) of deductions in\nthe system; and the system is required to satisfy three general\nconditions that Hilbert and Bernays called \u201crecursivity\nconditions\u201d. The rules of the calculus concern substitutions\nwithin equations and are very simple, allowing steps such as:\n\n\\[ a = b, f(a) \\vdash f(b) \\]\n\n\nOn the basis of this calculus (which they called \\(Z^0\\)) Hilbert and\nBernays established an equivalence result: The numerical functions\nthat are capable of rule-governed evaluation coincide with the\n(primitive) recursive functions (1939: 403 and 393n).\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that Hilbert, the founder of proof theory,\nultimately selected an analysis of effective calculability as\ncalculability within a logic, even though Church and Turing\nhad already presented their analyses in terms of recursive functions\nand Turing machines respectively. Hilbert and Bernays went on to use\ntheir analysis to give a new proof of the unsolvability of the\nEntscheidungsproblem (Hilbert & Bernays 1939: 416\u2013421). This\nproof quietly marks what must have been an unsettling, even painful,\nshift of perspective for them. The idea of a decision procedure for\nmathematics had until the Church-Turing result been central to their\nthinking, and in Volume 1 of the Grundlagen, published in\n1934, they had assumed the Entscheidungsproblem to be solvable.\n",
