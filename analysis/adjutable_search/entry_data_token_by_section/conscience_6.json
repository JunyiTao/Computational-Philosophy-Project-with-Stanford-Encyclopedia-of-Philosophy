Conscience, self-identifying moral commitments, and moral integrity\n\nThe subjective character of conscience delimits a sphere of personal\nmorality that is an essential part of our sense of personal identity,\nunderstood as our sense of who we are and of what characterizes\nqualitatively our individuality (for instance, our character, our\npsychological traits, our past experience, etc.). My conscience is\nwhat makes me this particular individual in a social and\ncultural context that I want to keep separate from me.\n\nThis private space in which the individual finds her own sense of\nidentity often grounds the political use of the notion of conscience.\nThus, many people claim the right to stick to their\nconscience\u2014particularly by advancing so called\n\u201cconscientious objection\u201d\u2014when social expectations\nor legal obligations would demand otherwise. These political appeals\nto conscience are usually made on the basis of two principles. The\nfirst is the principle of respect for moral integrity, which finds its\njustification in the close relationship between the notions of\nconscience and of moral integrity on one side (Childress 1979), and\nthe sense of personal identity on the other. The second principle\noften invoked in the political uses of \u201cconscience\u201d is the\nprinciple of \u201cfreedom of conscience\u201d. The former will be\ndiscussed in this section, and the latter in the next section.\n\nThe concept of personal identity in the sense in which the notion is\nused here\u2014i.e what defines me as this particular person in a\nqualitative sense\u2014is intimately related to the notions of\nconscience (Wicclair 2011; Childress 1979) and of moral integrity, and\nmore specifically to the \u201cidentity view of integrity\u201d (Cox\net al. 2013; Williams 1973 and 1981). According to this view, for\npeople to have integrity means to remain faithful to\n\u201cidentity-conferring commitments\u201d, i.e.,\n\u201ccommitments that people identify with most deeply, as\nconstituting what they consider their life is fundamentally\nabout\u201d (Cox et al. 2013). This identity-conferring aspect of\none\u2019s morality is exactly what some people call\n\u201cconscience\u201d. According to Childress, for example, \n\n\n[i]n appealing to conscience I indicate that I am trying to preserve a\nsense of myself, my wholeness and integrity, my good conscience, and\nthat I cannot preserve these qualities if I submit to certain\nrequirements of the state or society. (Childress 1979: 327)\n\n\nConscience as self-identifying can be understood in two ways. It can\nbe thought of either as a set of core and self-identifying moral\nbeliefs that are \u201cintegral to an agent\u2019s understanding of\nwho she is (i.e., her self-conception or identity)\u201d (Wicclair\n2011: 4), or as a way of approaching and relating to such moral\nbeliefs, i.e., a \u201ccommitment to uphold one\u2019s deepest and\nself-identifying moral beliefs\u201d (Sulmasy 2008: 138) and \u201ca\nmode of consciousness in which prospective actions are viewed in\nrelation to one\u2019s self and character\u201d (Bluestein 1993:\n294).\n\nConceived in either way, conscience is an essential part of our\nunderstanding of what kind of person we are, and this is taken to be a\nreason for warranting protection of conscience and conscientious\nobjection in different contexts, particularly in the health care\nprofessions (Wicclair 2011: 25\u201326; Bluestein 1993: 295).\n\nWe have seen above that there is a sense in which, according to some,\npsychopaths can be said to lack conscience (Hare 1999): psychopaths\nare not capable of connecting their moral knowledge to their conduct\nthrough the feelings of guilt and disapproval which conscience, on\nsome accounts, produces. Interestingly, according to some\npsychologists, psychopaths are also less likely to base their sense of\npersonal identity on moral traits than normal functioning individuals\n(Glenn et al. 2010). More recent psychological studies have suggested\nthat people tend to link the identity of others not so much to their\nmemories, as traditionally believed, but to their morals: it is the\nloss of one\u2019s moral character and moral beliefs, rather than of\none\u2019s memory, that leads us to say that a certain individual is\nnot the same person anymore (Strohminger and Nichols 2015). These\nfindings provide empirical support to the idea that conscience is\nessential to one\u2019s sense of personal identity and to\nattributions of personal identity\n",
