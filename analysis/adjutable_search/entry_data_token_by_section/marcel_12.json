Hope\n\nHope is the final guarantor of fidelity; it is that which allows me\nnot to despair, that which gives me the strength to continue to create\nmyself in availability to the other. But this might appear to be\nnothing more than optimism\u2014frequently misplaced, as events too\noften reveal\u2014that things will turn out for the best. Marcel\ninsists that this is not the case. Following now familiar\ndistinctions, he makes a differentiation between the realm of fear and\ndesire on one hand and the realm of despair and hope on the other.\n\nFear and desire are anticipatory and focused respectively on the\nobject of fear or desire. To desire is \u201cto desire that\nX\u201d and to fear is \u201cto fear that\nX.\u201d Optimism exists in the domain of fear and desire\nbecause it imagines and anticipates a favorable outcome. However, the\nessence of hope is not \u201cto hope that X\u201d, but\nmerely \u201cto hope\u2026\u201d The person who hopes does not\naccept the current situation as final; however, neither does she\nimagine or anticipate the circumstance that would deliver her from her\nplight, rather she merely hopes for deliverance. The more hope\ntranscends any anticipation of the form that deliverance would take,\nthe less it is open to the objection that, in many cases, the\nhoped-for deliverance does not take place. If I desire that my disease\nbe cured by a given surgical procedure, it is very possible that my\ndesire might be thwarted. However, if I simply maintain myself in\nhope, no specific event (or absence of event) need shake me from this\nhope.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that hope is inert or passive. Hope is\nnot stoicism. Stoicism is merely the resignation of a solitary\nconsciousness. Hope is neither resigned, nor solitary. \u201cHope\nconsists in asserting that there is at the heart of being, beyond all\ndata, beyond all inventories and all calculations, a mysterious\nprinciple which is in connivance with me\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 28).\nWhile hope is patient and expectant, it remains active; and as such it\nmight be characterized as an \u201cactive patience.\u201d The\nassertion contained in hope reveals a kinship with willing rather than\ndesiring. \u201cInert hope\u201d would be an oxymoron.\n\nNo doubt the solitary consciousness can achieve resignation\n[stoicism], but it may well be here that this word actually means\nnothing but spiritual fatigue. For hope, which is just the opposite of\nresignation, something more is required. There can be no hope that\ndoes not constitute itself through a we and for a we. I would be\ntempted to say that all hope is at the bottom choral. (Marcel 1973, p.\n143)\n\n\nFinally, it should be no surprise that \u201cspeaking metaphysically,\nthe only genuine hope is hope in what does not depend on ourselves,\nhope springing from humility and not from pride\u201d (Marcel 1995,\np. 32). And here is found yet another aspect of the withering that\ntakes place as a result of indisponibilit\u00e9 in general\nand pride in particular. The same arrogance that keeps the proud\nperson from communion with her fellows keeps her from hope.\n\nThis example points to the dialectical engagement of despair and\nhope\u2014where there is hope there is always the possibility of\ndespair, and only where there is the possibility of despair can we\nrespond with hope. Despair, says Marcel, is equivalent to saying that\nthere is nothing in the whole of reality to which I can extend credit,\nnothing worthwhile. \u201cDespair is possible in any form, at any\nmoment and to any degree, and this betrayal may seem to be counseled,\nif not forced upon us, by the very structure of the world we live\nin\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 26). Hope is the affirmation that is the\nresponse to this denial. Where despair denies that anything in reality\nis worthy of credit, hope affirms that reality will ultimately prove\nworthy of an infinite credit, the complete engagement and disposal of\nmyself.\n",
