    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe Identity of Indiscernibles is a principle of analytic ontology\nfirst explicitly formulated by Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz in his\nDiscourse on Metaphysics, Section 9 (Loemker 1969: 308). It\nstates that no two distinct things exactly resemble each other.  This\nis often referred to as \u2018Leibniz\u2019s Law\u2019 and is typically\nunderstood to mean that no two objects have exactly the same\nproperties. The Identity of Indiscernibles is of interest because it\nraises questions about the factors which individuate qualitatively\nidentical objects. Recent work on the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics suggests that the applicability of the principle in the\nquantum domain is controversial (see French 2019).\n",
