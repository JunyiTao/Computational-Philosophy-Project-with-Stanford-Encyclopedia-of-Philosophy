What does contractualism demand?\n\nImpartial theories are often accused of being unreasonably demanding.\nFor instance, consider the fact that there are very many very needy\npeople in the world. A variety of aid agencies, which currently rely\non donations from private individuals, can alleviate these needs. No\ndoubt governments, multinationals, and others could do far more than\nthey do. But the question still remains: faced with such urgent needs,\nat least some of which I could meet at comparatively little cost to\nmyself, how should I as an individual act?\n\nImpartial moral theories often seem to give very demanding answers to\nthis question. This is easiest to see for utilitarianism.\nUtilitarianism tells me to put my dollars wherever they will do the\nmost good. In the hands of a reputable aid agency, my dollar could\nsave a child from a crippling illness, and so I am obligated to donate\nit to the aid agency. I should give my next dollar to an aid agency,\nand I must keep donating till I reach the point where my own basic\nneeds, or my ability to keep earning dollars, are in jeopardy. Most of\nmy current activities will have to go. Nor will my sacrifice be only\nfinancial. According to utilitarianism, I should also spend my time\nwhere it will do most good. I should devote all my energies to aid\nwork, as well as all my money.\n\nPerhaps we would admire someone who behaved in this way. But is it\nplausible to claim that those of us who do not are guilty of\nwrongdoing; or that we have a moral obligation to devote all our\nresources to charity? Such conclusions strike many people as absurd.\nThis leads to the common objection that utilitarianism is unreasonably\ndemanding, as it leaves the agent too little room (time, resources,\nenergy) for her own projects or interests.\n\nThis is a serious objection to utilitarianism. If contractualism can\navoid a similar fate, then this will be a significant advantage. But\nis contractualism less demanding than utilitarianism? It certainly\nseems possible that contractualism will generate very demanding\nprinciples, as it seems reasonable for those who are starving to\nreject any principle permitting me to retain inessential resources\nrather than meeting their most basic needs. I would then be doing\nsomething wrong unless I do all that I can to save other\npeople\u2019s lives\u2014at least until I reach the level below\nwhich I would be giving up necessary components of my own\nwell-being.\n\nA similar problem for contractualism is presented by Thomas Nagel, who\nargues that, in the present state of the world, it may be impossible\nto construct any set of principles which no-one can\nreasonably reject. Any possible principle of aid will either make\nunreasonable demands on the affluent (from their point of view), or\npay inadequate attention to the basic needs of the destitute (from\ntheir point of view). If the notion of reasonable rejection is at\nleast partly determined by the agent\u2019s own perspective, then any\nprinciple will be reasonably rejected by someone. (Nagel 1991 and\n1999).\n\nContractualists might reply that principles of aid presuppose some\nbackground set of entitlements, guaranteeing me the free use of my own\nresources. This raises two problems. The first is that, from the fact\nthat I own something, it does not follow that I do not have an\nobligation to give it away. The most that might follow is that others\nmay not force me to do so. The second problem is that, if our overall\ntheory is Contractualist, then the property rights themselves must be\ngiven a Contractualist justification. We need a system of property\nrights no-one can reasonably reject. Any system where property rights\nare very unequally distributed will be rejected by those who miss\nout.\n\nHow might contractualism reply to this demandingness objection? Like\nany impartial moral theory, contractualism can bite the bullet, and\nargue that morality is very demanding. The contractualist apparatus\nexplains why morality is demanding\u2014if we seek to act in\na way that we could justify to others, then we must adopt principles\nthat no-one can reasonably reject. Given the state of the world, these\nprinciples will seem very demanding to those who are\naffluent\u2014but the alternative would be principles that place an\neven greater burden on those who are worst-off.\n\nFor instance, Scanlon himself reaches the following principle through\ncontractualist reasoning:\n\n\nThe Rescue Principle:\nIf we can prevent something very bad from happening to someone by\nmaking a slight or even moderate sacrifice, it would be wrong not to\ndo so (Scanlon 1998, p. 224).\n\n\nThis principle could make very significant demands, especially if we\nwere continually facing situations where a slight sacrifice would save\nsomeone\u2019s life. If my sacrifice is much less than the very bad\nthing I prevent, it is hard to see how I can reasonably reject this\nprinciple.\n\nMore controversially, one of us has argued previously that analogous\nreasoning leads to an even more demanding principle.\n\nThe Stringent Principle:\nIf we can prevent something very bad from happening to someone by\nmaking a great sacrifice (e.g., giving most of our income to aid\nagencies and spending a lot of our spare time on campaigning and\nfund-raising), it would be wrong not to do so (Ashford 2003, p.\n287).\n\n\nIf the \u2018great sacrifice\u2019 is nevertheless significantly\nless bad than the \u2018very bad thing\u2019 that might happen, it\nis hard to see how I can reasonably reject this principle. If the\n\u2018very bad thing\u2019 is an agonising death, this principle can\nbe very demanding indeed.\n\nIt may be argued that even if this stringent principle follows from\ncontractualism, that is not a problem for the theory. Perhaps, in the\ncurrent state of the world, we should expect any moral theory grounded\non each person\u2019s equal moral status to be extremely demanding,\ngiven the drastic and irrevocable impact on those in need if they are\nnot helped, and the fact that there are constantly so many in this\nposition (Ashford 2003, p. 292\u20132).\n\nHowever, many moral philosophers\u2014contractualists\nincluded\u2014seek a more moderate moral theory. If contractualism is\nto avoid being extremely demanding, the challenge is to stop short of\nthe stringent principle. We need to find a principle that allows me to\nchoose my own lesser good over a (significantly) greater good for\nsomeone else\u2014and then to show that this principle cannot be\nreasonably rejected. For instance, suppose I spend my spare evening\n(and spare income) going to the movies rather than donating the time\nand money to a charity which could thus have saved someone\u2019s\nlife. We need an explanation of why those who die as a result cannot\nreasonably reject the principle that permits this behaviour.\n\nThe most promising answer lies, once again, in the possibility that my\ngrounds for rejecting a principle are not necessarily confined to its\ndirect impact on my well-being. I might reject a principle requiring\nme to devote all my time and energy to charity, not simply because of\nthe burdens it imposes on me but because, in leaving me no room for my\nown personal projects, it fails to respect me as a person. (The\ndestitute person will reply that a principle allowing me to leave her\nto starve fails to respect her as a person. The challenge for the\ncontractualist is to distinguish these two complaints. For one\nattempt, see Kumar 2000.)\n\nResponding to Parfit\u2019s presentation of the convergence argument,\nand his critique of the individualist and impersonal restrictions,\nScanlon notes that, because it rejects those restrictions, any\nimpersonal reformulation of contractualism is much more demanding than\nthe original formulation of contractualism (Scanlon 2011). This charge\nhas a particular dialectical significance, as rule consequentialists\noften present their theory as a more moderate alternative to the\nextreme demands of act consequentialism. If it retains those\nrestrictions, contractualism will always be less demanding than these\nalternative theories\u2014even if its demands are greater than\ncommonsense morality might normally expect.\n",
