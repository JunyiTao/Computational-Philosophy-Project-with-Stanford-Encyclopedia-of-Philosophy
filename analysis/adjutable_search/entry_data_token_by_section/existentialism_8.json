    "main_text": "Freedom || The Anxiety of Choice\n4.1 The Anxiety of Choice\nIn the canon of existentialist literature, no writer captures this\nidea better than Dostoevsky in his Notes from the Underground.\nThe nameless \u201cunderground man\u201d rebels against an\nincreasingly scientized, rational, and mechanistic picture of human\nbehavior promoted by Russian social reformers in the 1860s, where\neverything a person does was thought to be determined by causal laws.\nFor the underground man, this view reduces the human being to a\nmechanical cog or \u201ca piano key\u201d (1864 [2009, 18]), and it\nundermines the one value that gives existence its meaning and dignity,\nthat is, the capacity to choose and create our own\n lives.[5]\nTo affirm his freedom,\nthe underground man responds to this situation through self-immolating\nacts of revolt, doing the opposite of whatever the determinations of\nrationality, social convention, or the laws of nature demand. When he\nhas a toothache, he refuses to see the doctor; when he is at a party\nwith former school mates, he behaves in outrageous and humiliating\nways; when the prostitute Liza reaches out to him in tenderness, he\nlashes out at her in rage. In this sense, the underground man is an\nanti-hero. He recognizes that freedom is the highest value, the\n\u201cmost advantageous advantage\u201d (1864 [2009, 17]) for human\nbeings, but at the same time he realizes there is no way of knowing\nwhat might come of our choices; they may, as they do for the\nunderground man, result in our own self-destruction. As Dostoevsky\nwrites: \u201cWhat man wants is simply independent choice, whatever\nthat independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And the choice, of\ncourse, the devil only knows what choice\u201d (1864 [2009, 20]).\nThis account of freedom suggests that my being (or identity) is\nalways penetrated by the possibility of its own negation because I can\nalways question myself and assign new meanings to and interpretations\nof who I am in the future. My self-interpretation is always insecure or\nunstable. I may interpret myself as a philosophy professor today, but I\nam also not a professor insofar as I can freely choose to\nreject this identity and resign from my job tomorrow. In this sense, I\nam no-thing, a \u201cbeing-possible.\u201d As Sartre puts it:\n\u201chuman existence is constituted as a being which is what it\nis not and which is not what it is\u201d (1943 [1956,\n107]). For the existentialist, anxiety discloses this predicament to me,\nrevealing that I\u2019ve been abandoned to a realm of possibilities,\nwhere I face a dizzying array of options, and I alone am answerable to\nwhatever options I choose. Understood this way, anxiety is not directed\nat some external object or event in the world. If I am an incarnation\nof freedom, it is directed at me; I am the source of it. \n",
