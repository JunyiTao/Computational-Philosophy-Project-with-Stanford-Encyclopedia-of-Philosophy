The instrumentalist account is premised on the view that\nnot only does the state help one discharge one's duties of justice; it\nasserts that compliance with the state is necessary to the discharge of\none's duties. Hence, one acts unjustly if one fails to comply with the\nstate's commands.\n\n\nTo understand this, we need to introduce another concept. The idea\nis that the state does not only promote justice, it\nestablishes justice. What does this mean? It means that for a\nparticular community, the state determines what justice requires in the\nrelations between individuals. It does this by defining the relations\nof property and exchange as well as the institutions of the criminal\nlaw and tort law. To say that the state's legislative activity\nestablishes justice is not the same as saying that the state's activity\nconstitutes justice. Justice is still an independent standard of\nassessment on this account.\n\n\nThe reason for saying that the state establishes justice is that, in\nJoseph Raz's words, justice and morality more generally, underdetermine\nthe legislation necessary to bring about justice in a community. This\nmeans that one can implement the same principles of justice by means of\nmany different sets of rules. But one can treat others justly only if\none is on the same page as the others. So what is just in a particular\ncircumstance will depend in part on the set of rules that the others\nare acting on. To the extent that the state determines the basic\nframework of rules, it determines which actions are just and which are\nnot. One does not act justly, on this account, by deciding not to\ncomply with the state one lives in and sending money to another state\nor association. If one fails to comply with the rules of property or\nthe rules of exchange, one treats others unjustly. The options argument\nsuggests that somehow there is a way that one can discharge one's duty\nto others by doing something other than obeying the law. Instead of\nobeying the law of property of the society in which I live, I may\nsimply decide to send money to another part of the world where property\nrights are enforced. But this argument fails to appreciate the central\nimportance of law to defining justice among persons. Though not all\nlaws are just, justice among persons in any even moderately complex\nsociety requires law and obedience to law.\n",
