    "preamble": "\n\nHenry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862) was an American philosopher,\npoet, environmental scientist, and political activist whose major\nwork, Walden, draws upon each of these various identities in\nmeditating upon the concrete problems of living in the world as a\nhuman being. He sought to revive a conception of philosophy as a way\nof life, not only a mode of reflective thought and discourse.\nThoreau\u2019s work was informed by an eclectic variety of sources.\nHe was well-versed in classical Greek and Roman philosophy (and\npoetry), ranging from the pre-Socratics through the Hellenistic\nschools, and was also an avid student of the ancient scriptures and\nwisdom literature of various Asian traditions. He was familiar with\nmodern philosophy ranging from Descartes, Locke, and the Cambridge\nPlatonists through Emerson, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, all\nof whom are influential on Thoreau\u2019s philosophy. He discussed\nhis own empirical findings with leading naturalists of the day, and\nread the latest work of Humboldt and Darwin with interest and\nadmiration. His philosophical explorations of self and world led him\nto develop an epistemology of embodied perception and a non-dualistic\naccount of mental and material life. In addition to his focus on\nethics in an existential spirit, Thoreau also makes unique\ncontributions to ontology, the philosophy of science, and radical\npolitical thought. Although his political essays have become justly\nfamous, his works on natural science were not even published until the\nlate twentieth century, and they help to give us a more complete\npicture of him as a thinker. Among the texts he left unfinished was a\nset of manuscript volumes filled with information on Native American\nreligion and culture. Thoreau\u2019s work anticipates certain later\ndevelopments in pragmatism, phenomenology, and environmental\nphilosophy, and poses a perennially valuable challenge to our\nconception of the methods and intentions of philosophy itself.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Writings\n\nThoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1817 and died there in\n1862, at the age of forty-four. Like that of his contemporary\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Thoreau\u2019s intellectual career unfolded\nin a close and polemical relation to the town in which he spent almost\nhis entire life. After graduating from Harvard in 1837, he struck up a\nfriendship with fellow Concord resident Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose\nessay \u201cNature\u201d he had first encountered earlier that year.\nAlthough the two American thinkers had a turbulent relationship due to\nserious philosophical and personal differences, they had a profound\nand lasting effect upon one another. It was in the fall of 1837 that\nThoreau made his first entries in the multivolume journal he would\nkeep for the rest of his life. Most of his published writings were\ndeveloped from notes that first appeared on these pages, and Thoreau\nsubsequently revised many entries, suggesting that his journal can be\nconsidered a finished work in itself. During his lifetime he published\nonly two books, along with numerous shorter essays that were first\ndelivered as lectures. He lived a simple and relatively quiet life,\nmaking his living briefly as a teacher and pencil maker but mostly as\na land surveyor. Thoreau had intimate bonds with his family and\nfriends (the loss of his brother John in 1842 was a major trauma) and\nremained unmarried, although he was deeply in love at least twice. His\nfirst book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, was\nstill a work in progress in 1845, when he went to live in the woods by\nWalden Pond for two years and two months. This\n\u201cexperiment\u201d in living on the outskirts of town was an\nintensive time of examination for Thoreau, as he drew close to nature\nand contemplated the final ends of his own life, which was otherwise\nat risk of ending in quiet desperation. Thoreau viewed his existential\nquest as a venture in philosophy, in the ancient Greek sense of the\nword, because it was motivated by an urgent need to find a reflective\nunderstanding of reality that could inform a life of wisdom. This is\nbecause, according to the belief that philosophy is a way of life,\nthat very way of life \u201cwill necessarily be deliberative and\nreflective\u201d; accordingly, for Thoreau, \u201cthinking about his\nlife in the woods is central to his life in the woods\u201d (Bates\n2012, 29). Moreover, it is only after having cultivated \u201ca\nmeticulous and discerning awareness of the particularities of\nnature\u201d in one specific place (Robinson 2004, 100) that he\nbecame able to articulate a vision of the human being\u2019s capacity to be\ngrounded and at home in the world.\n\nHis experience bore fruit in the 1854 publication of his literary\nmasterpiece Walden, a work that almost defies categorization:\nit is a work of narrative prose which often soars to poetic heights,\ncombining philosophical speculation with close observation of a\nconcrete place. It is a rousing summons to the examined life and to\nthe realization of one\u2019s potential, while at the same time it\ndevelops what might be described as a religious vision of the human\nbeing and the universe. Walden has been admired by a larger\nworld audience than any other book written by an American author,\nand\u2014whether or not it ought to be called a work of\nphilosophy\u2014it contains a substantial amount of philosophical\ncontent, which deserves to be better appreciated than it has been.\nStanley Cavell has argued that Thoreau is an embarrassment to\n\u201cwhat we have learned to call philosophy,\u201d since his work\nembodies \u201ca mode of conceptual accuracy\u201d that is\n\u201cbased on an idea of rigor\u201d somewhat foreign to the\nacademic establishment (Cavell 1988, 14). Yet, as Cavell also notes,\nphilosophical authors have more than one way to go about their\nbusiness, and Thoreau\u2014like Descartes in the\nMeditations\u2014begins his argument by accounting for how\nhe has come to believe that certain questions need to be addressed. In\nother words, his method is predicated on the belief that it is\nphilosophically worthwhile to clarify the basis of your own perplexity\nand unrest (see Reid 2012, 46). And this is only one way of explaining\nhow a significant part of the challenge in coming to terms with\nThoreau is that his philosophy, like Nietzsche\u2019s, has a literary\nand poetic quality. The reader is charged with finding the coherence\nof Thoreau\u2019s whole philosophical outlook. Accordingly, this\nentry attempts to delineate the main themes of Thoreau\u2019s\nproject, in the hope of serving as an aid and stimulus to further\nstudy. It draws upon Thoreau\u2019s entire corpus, including the\nworks he left in manuscript that were published after his death.\n2. Nature and Human Existence\n\nIn his essay \u201cNature,\u201d Emerson asserts that there can be\nfound in the natural world \u201ca sanctity which shames our\nreligions.\u201d Thoreau would agree completely with this statement.\nBut in the same essay Emerson also inclines toward Platonism, stating\nthat nature is \u201cemblematic\u201d of higher truths, and\nsuggesting that the material world has value by virtue of being a\nsubsidiary product of mental reality: each natural object is therefore\n\u201ca symbol of some spiritual fact.\u201d For the most part,\nThoreau recoils from the idea that we could find some kind of higher\nreality by looking beyond nature: in the \u201cFriday\u201d chapter\nof A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, he asks:\n\u201cIs not Nature, rightly read, that of which she is commonly\ntaken to be the symbol merely?\u201d As he sees it, the realm of\nspirit is the physical world, which has a sacred meaning that\ncan be directly perceived. Accordingly, he seeks \u201cto be always\non the alert to find God in nature\u201d (Journal, 9/7/51),\nand to hear \u201cthe language which all things and events speak\nwithout metaphor\u201d (Walden, IV). Thoreau\u2019s\nmetaphysical convictions compel him to \u201cdefend nature\u2019s\nintrinsic value,\u201d in a way that situates him philosophically in\na place \u201cfar removed from Emerson and most\ntranscendentalists\u201d (Cafaro 2004, 132\u2013133). In his\njournal, Thoreau reports that his goal is to \u201cstate facts\u201d\nin such a way that \u201cthey shall be significant,\u201d rather\nthan allowing himself to be blind to \u201cthe significance of\nphenomena\u201d (Journal, 11/9/51 & 8/5/51). Evidently,\nhe does not accept that whatever we register through our aesthetic and\nemotional responses ought to be viewed as unreal. Indeed, Thoreau\nwould argue that the person who is seldom moved by the beauty of\nthings is the one with an inadequate conception of reality, since it\nis the neutral observer who is less well aware of the world as it is.\nAnd he exhorts us to unclutter and simplify our lives, by eliminating\nthe supposed necessities that can entrap us when we mistakenly\nconstrue them as essential (see Hunt, 2020).\n\nTo say that nature is inherently significant is to say that natural\nfacts are neither inert nor value-free. Thoreau urges his reader not\nto \u201cunderrate the value of a fact,\u201d since each concrete\ndetail of the world may contain a meaningful truth (\u201cNatural\nHistory of Massachusetts\u201d). Note the phrase: the value of a\nfact. Thoreau does not introduce an artificial distinction\nbetween facts and values, or between primary and secondary qualities.\nWhen we perceive sights, sounds, and textures, we are not standing as\ndisembodied consciousness apart from a world of inanimate mechanisms;\nrather, we are sentient beings immersed in the sensory world, learning\nthe \u201cessential facts of life\u201d only through \u201cthe\nperpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds\nus\u201d (Walden, II). The philosopher who seeks knowledge\nthrough experience should therefore not be surprised to discover\nbeauty and order in natural phenomena. However, these properties are\nnot projected onto nature from an external perspective\u2014rather,\nthey emerge from within the self-maintaining processes of organic\nlife. And the entire environment, the \u201cliving earth\u201d\nitself, has something like a life of its own, one which may be going\nwell or badly, containing but not reducible to the biotic existence of\nanimals and plants (Walden, XVII). This is what he elsewhere\ndescribes as the \u201cslumbering subterranean fire in nature which\nnever goes out\u201d (\u201cA Winter Walk\u201d).\n\nThoreau remarks upon the \u201cmuch grander significance\u201d of\nany natural phenomenon \u201cwhen not referred to man and his needs\nbut viewed absolutely\u201d (Journal, 11/10/51). The world\nis rich with value that is not of our making, and \u201cwhatever we\nhave perceived to be in the slightest degree beautiful is of\ninfinitely more value to us than what we have only as yet discovered\nto be useful and to serve our purpose\u201d (Faith in a\nSeed, 144). It is when we are not guilty of imposing our own\npurposes onto the world that we are able to view it on its own terms.\nOne of the things we then discover is that we are involved in a\npluralistic universe, containing many different points of view other\nthan our own. And when we begin to realize \u201cthe infinite extent\nof our relations\u201d (Walden, VIII), we can see that even\nwhat does not at first seem to be good for us may have some\npositive value when considered from a broader perspective. Rather than\ndismissing squirrels as rodents, for instance, we should see them as\n\u201cplanters of forests,\u201d and be grateful for the role they\nplay in the distribution of seeds (Journal, 10/22/60).\nLikewise, the \u201cgentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in\nthe house to-day is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too.\nThough it prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my\nhoeing. If it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in\nthe ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands, it would still\nbe good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass,\nit would be good for me\u201d (Walden, V). Our limited view\noften keeps us from appreciating the harmonious interdependence of all\nparts of the natural world: this is not due to \u201cany confusion or\nirregularity in Nature,\u201d but because of our own incomplete\nknowledge (Walden, XVI). Thoreau declares that he would be\nhappy \u201cif all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild\nstate,\u201d since in tampering with nature we know not what we do\nand sometimes end up doing harm as a result (Walden, X). In\nmany cases we find that \u201cunhandselled nature is worth more even\nby our modes of valuation than our improvements are\u201d\n(Journal, 11/10/60).\n\nIn nature we have access to real value, which can be used as a\nstandard against which to measure our conventional evaluations. An\nexample of the latter is the value that is \u201carbitrarily\nattached\u201d to gold, which has nothing to do with its\n\u201cintrinsic beauty or value\u201d (Journal, 10/13/60).\nSo it is a mistake to rush to California \u201cas if the true gold\nwere to be found in that direction,\u201d when one has failed to\nappreciate the inherent worth of one\u2019s native soil\n(Journal, 10/18/55). In the economy of nature, a seed is more\nprecious than a diamond, for it contains \u201cthe principle of\ngrowth, or life,\u201d and has the ability to become a specific plant\nor tree (Journal, 3/22/61). The seed not only provides\nevidence that nature is filled with \u201ccreative genius\u201d\n(Journal, 1/5/56), but it also reminds us that a spark of\ndivinity is present in each human being as well. One of\nThoreau\u2019s favorite analogies\u2014not only a metaphor, as he\nsees it\u2014is that between the ripening of a seed and the\ndevelopment of human potential. \u201cThe finest qualities of our\nnature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most\ndelicate handling\u201d (Walden, I). What he calls\n\u201cwildness\u201d is not located only in the nonhuman world; the\nsame creative force is also active in human nature, so that even a\nliterary work of art can reasonably be praised as a manifestation of\nwildness (see \u201cWalking\u201d; Walden, I). There is\n\u201ca perfect analogy between the life of the human being and that\nof the vegetable\u201d (Journal, 5/20/51), and thoughts\n\u201cspring in man\u2019s brain\u201d in just the same way that\n\u201ca plant springs and grows by its own vitality\u201d\n(Journal, 11/8/50; 4/3/58). Thoreau\u2019s exhortations to\nfollow the promptings of one\u2019s genius are based on the idea that\nby obeying our own wild nature we are aligning ourselves with a sacred\npower. What inspires us to realize our highest potential is \u201cthe\nprimitive vigor of Nature in us\u201d (Journal, 8/30/56),\nand this influence is something we are able neither to predict nor to\ncomprehend: as he describes it in the \u201cKtaadn\u201d chapter of\nThe Maine Woods, nature is \u201cprimeval, untamed, and\nforever untamable,\u201d a godlike force but not always a kind\none.\n\nAt one point in Walden, Thoreau quips that he\nusually does not count himself among the \u201ctrue\nidealists\u201d who are inclined to reject \u201cthe evidence of\n[their] senses\u201d (Walden, XIV). On the other hand, he\nscorns the sort of materialism that fails to penetrate the inner\nmystery of things, discovering \u201cnothing but surface\u201d in\nits mechanistic observations (Journal, 3/7/59). Instead, he\nargues that we must approach the world as \u201cnature looking into\nnature,\u201d aware of the relation between the form of our own\nperception and what we are able to perceive (Correspondence,\n7/21/41). There are reasons for classifying Thoreau as both a\nnaturalist and a romantic, although both of these categories are\nperhaps too broad to be very helpful. His conception of nature is\ninformed by a syncretic appropriation of Greek, Asian, and other\nsources, and the result is an eclectic vision that is uniquely his\nown. For this reason it is difficult to situate Thoreau within the\nhistory of modern philosophy, but one plausible way of doing so would\nbe to describe him as articulating a version of transcendental\nidealism. If Thoreau is indeed \u201cthe American heir to\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy,\u201d as he has been called\n(Oelschlaeger 1991, 136), it is because his investigation of\n\u201cthe relation between the subject of knowledge and its\nobject\u201d builds upon a Kantian insight (see Cavell 1992,\n94\u201395). Yet in order to understand why this might be an accurate\ncategorization, we must proceed from Thoreau\u2019s metaphysics to\nhis epistemology.\n3. The Ethics of Perception\n\nIf one were asked to name the cardinal virtue of Thoreau\u2019s\nphilosophy, it would be hard to identify a better candidate than\nawareness. He attests to the importance of \u201cbeing\nforever on the alert,\u201d and of \u201cthe discipline of looking\nalways at what is to be seen\u201d (Walden, IV). This\nexercise may enable one to create remarkably intricate descriptions of\na sunset, a battle between red and black ants, or the shapes taken by\nthawing clay on a sand bank; but its primary value lies in the way it\naffects the quality of our experience. \u201cIt is something to be\nable to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to\nmake a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and\npaint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look\u201d\n(Walden, II). Awareness cannot be classified as exclusively a\nmoral or an intellectual virtue, either, since knowing is an\ninescapably practical and evaluative activity\u2014not to mention, an\nembodied practice. Thoreau portrays himself not from a presumably\nneutral or impersonal vantage point, \u201cbut from an embodied point\nof view\u201d in which his somatic sensory experience puts him\n\u201cknowingly in touch with\u201d his surroundings (Goodman 2012,\n36). For such reasons as these, he has sometimes been interpreted as a\n\u201cphilosopher of the senses\u201d (Mooney 2009, 195), who offers\nan original response to the central problem of modern philosophy as a\nconsequence of recognizing that knowledge is \u201cdependent on the\nindividual\u2019s ability to see,\u201d and that \u201cthe\nworld as known is thus radically dependent on character\u201d (Tauber\n2001, 4\u20135).\n\nOne of the common tenets of ancient philosophy which was arguably\nabandoned in the period beginning with Descartes is that a person\n\u201ccould not have access to the truth\u201d without undertaking a\nprocess of self-purification that would render him or her\n\u201csusceptible to knowing the truth\u201d (Foucault 1997,\n278\u2013279). For Thoreau, it was the work of a lifetime to\ncultivate one\u2019s receptivity to the beauty of the universe.\nBelieving that \u201cthe perception of beauty is a moral test\u201d\n(Journal, 6/21/52), Thoreau frequently chastises himself or\nhumanity in general for failing in this respect. \u201cHow much of\nbeauty\u2014of color, as well as form\u2014on which our eyes daily\nrest goes unperceived by us,\u201d he laments (Journal,\n8/1/60); and he worries that \u201cNature has no human inhabitant who\nappreciates her\u201d (Walden, IX). Noticing that his\nsensory awareness has grown less acute since the time of his youth, he\nspeculates that \u201cthe child plucks its first flower with an\ninsight into its beauty and significance which the subsequent botanist\nnever retains\u201d (Journal, 7/16/51; 2/5/52). In order to\nattain a clear and truthful view of things, we must refine all the\nfaculties of our embodied consciousness, and become emotionally\nattuned to all the concrete features of the place in which we are\nsituated. We fully know only those facts that are \u201cwarm, moist,\nincarnated,\u201d and palpably felt: \u201cA man has not seen a\nthing who has not felt it\u201d (Journal, 2/23/60). In this\nway, Thoreau outlines an epistemological task that will occupy him for\nthe rest of his life; namely, to cultivate a way of attending to\nthings that will allow them to be experienced as elements of a\nmeaningful world.\n\nSince our ability to appreciate the significance of phenomena is so\neasily dulled, it requires a certain discipline in order to become and\nremain a reliable knower of the world. Like Aristotle, Thoreau\nbelieves that the perception of truth \u201cproduces a pleasurable\nsensation,\u201d and he adds that a \u201chealthy and refined nature\nwould always derive pleasure from the landscape\u201d\n(Journal, 9/24/54 & 6/27/52). Nature will reward the most\ncareful attention paid by a person who is appropriately disposed, but\nthere is only \u201cas much beauty visible to us in the landscape as\nwe are prepared to appreciate,\u2014not a grain more. The actual\nobjects which one person will see from a particular hilltop are just\nas different from those which another will see as the persons are\ndifferent\u201d (Journal, 11/4/58). One who is in the right\nstate to be capable of giving a \u201cpoetic and lively\ndescription\u201d of things will find himself or herself \u201cin a\nliving and beautiful world\u201d (Journal, 10/13/60 &\n12/31/59). Beauty, like color, does not lie only in the eye of the\nbeholder: flowers, for example, are indeed beautiful and brightly\ncolored. Nevertheless, beauty\u2014and color, for that\nmatter\u2014can exist only where there is a beholder to perceive it\n(Journal, 6/15/52 & 1/21/38). From all of his experience\nin the field making observations of natural phenomena, Thoreau gained\nthe insight \u201cthat he, the supposedly neutral observer, was\nalways and unavoidably in the center of the observation\u201d\n(McGregor 1997, 113). Because all perception of objects has a\nsubjective aspect, the world can be defined as a sphere centered\naround each conscious perceiver: wherever we are located, \u201cthe\nuniverse is built around us, and we are central still\u201d\n(Journal, 8/24/41). This does not mean that we are trapped\ninside of our own consciousness; rather, the point is that it is only\nthrough the lens of our own subjectivity that we have access to the\nexternal world.\n\nWhat we are able to perceive, then, depends not only upon where we are\nphysically located: it is also contingent upon who we are and what we\nvalue, or how our attention is focused. \u201cObjects are concealed\nfrom our view, not so much because they are out of the course of our\nvisual ray as because we do not bring our minds and eyes to bear on\nthem\u2026. A man sees only what concerns him\u201d\n(\u201cAutumnal Tints\u201d). In other words, there is \u201cno\nsuch thing as pure objective observation. Your observation,\nto be interesting, i.e. to be significant, must be\nsubjective\u201d (Journal, 5/6/54). Subjectivity is\nnot an obstacle to truth, according to Thoreau. After all, he says,\n\u201cthe truest description, and that by which another living man\ncan most readily recognize a flower, is the unmeasured and eloquent\none which the sight of it inspires\u201d (Journal,\n10/13/60). A true account of the world must do justice to all the\nfamiliar properties of objects that the human mind is capable of\nperceiving. Whether this can be done by a scientific description is a\nvexing question for Thoreau, and one about which he shows considerable\nambivalence. One of his concerns is that the scientist\n\u201cdiscovers no world for the mind of man with all its faculties\nto inhabit\u201d; by contrast, there is \u201cmore humanity\u201d\nin \u201cthe unscientific man\u2019s knowledge,\u201d since the\nlatter can explain how certain facts pertain to life\n(Journal, 9/5/51; 2/13/52). He accuses the naturalist of\nfailing to understand color, much less beauty, and asks: \u201cWhat\nsort of science is that which enriches the understanding, but robs the\nimagination?\u201d (Journal, 10/5/61 & 12/25/51) For\nThoreau, the most reliable observer is one who can \u201csee things\nas they are, grand and beautiful\u201d (Journal,\n1/7/57)\u2014in other words, the beauty and grandeur of the world\nreally are there to be seen, even if we are not always capable of\nseeing them. We can easily fail to perceive the value of being if we\ndo not approach the world with the appropriate kind of emotional\ncomportment.\n\nThoreau sometimes characterizes science as an ideal discipline that\nwill enrich our knowledge and experience: \u201cThe true man of\nscience will know nature better by his finer organization; he will\nsmell, taste, see, hear, feel, better than other men. His will be a\ndeeper and finer experience\u201d (\u201cNatural History of\nMassachusetts\u201d). He observes that scientific terminology can\nprovide the means of apprehending something that we had utterly missed\nuntil we had a name for it (see Walls 2012, 108). Yet he also gives\nvoice to the fear that by weighing and measuring things and collecting\nquantitative data we may actually be narrowing our vision. The\nscientist \u201cstudies nature as a dead language,\u201d and would\nrather study a dead fish preserved in a jar than a living one in its\nnative element (Journal, 5/10/53 & 11/30/58). In these\nsame journal entries, Thoreau claims that he seeks to experience the\nsignificance of nature, and that \u201cthe beauty of the fish\u201d\nis what is most worthy of being measured. On the other hand, when he\nfinds a dead fish in the water, he brings it home to weigh and\nmeasure, covering several pages with his statistical findings\n(Journal, 8/20/54). This is only one of many examples of\nThoreau\u2019s fascination with data-gathering, and yet he repeatedly\nquestions its value, as if he does not know what to make of his own\npenchant for naturalistic research. At the very least, scientific\ninvestigations run the risk of being \u201ctrivial and petty,\u201d\nso perhaps what one should do is \u201clearn science and then forget\nit\u201d (Journal, 1/21/53 & 4/22/52). But Thoreau is\nmore deeply troubled by the possibility that \u201cscience is\ninhuman,\u201d since objects \u201cseen with a microscope begin to\nbe insignificant,\u201d and this is \u201cnot the means of acquiring\ntrue knowledge\u201d (Journal, 5/1/59 & 5/28/54).\nOverall, his position is not that an imaginative awareness of the\nworld is incompatible with knowledge of measurable facts, but that an\nexclusive focus on the latter would blind us to whatever aspects of\nreality fall outside the scope of our measurement.\n\nOne thing we can learn from Thoreau\u2019s comments on scientific\ninquiry is that he cares very much about the following question: what\ncan we know about the world, and how are we able to know it? Although\nhe admires the precision of scientific information, he wonders if what\nit delivers is always bound to be \u201csomething less than the vague\npoetic\u201d (Journal, 1/5/50). In principle, a naturalistic\napproach to reality should be able to capture its beauty and\nsignificance; in practice, however, it may be \u201cimpossible for\nthe same person to see things from the poet\u2019s point of view and\nthat of the man of science\u201d (Journal, 2/18/52). In that\ncase, the best we can do is try to convey our intimations of the truth\nabout the universe, even if this means venturing far beyond claims\nthat are positively verifiable: \u201cI desire to speak somewhere\nwithout bounds; like a man in his waking moment, to men in\ntheir waking moments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate\nenough even to lay the foundation of a true expression\u2026 . The\nwords which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are\nsignificant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures\u201d\n(Walden, XVIII). We should not arbitrarily limit our\nawareness to that which can be described with mathematical exactitude,\nfor perhaps the highest knowledge available to us, Thoreau suggests,\nconsists in \u201ca sudden revelation of the insufficiency of all\nthat we called Knowledge before \u2026 it is the lighting up of the\nmist by the sun\u201d (\u201cWalking\u201d). And perhaps this is\nnot a regrettable fact: \u201cAt the same time that we are earnest to\nexplore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious\nand unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and\nunfathomed by us because unfathomable\u201d (Walden, XVII).\nBy acknowledging the limits of what we can know with certainty, we\nopen ourselves up to a wider horizon of experience.\n\nAs one commentator points out, Thoreau\u2019s categories\u2014so to\nspeak\u2014are dynamic, since they are constantly being redefined by\nwhat we perceive, even as they shape our way of seeing (Peck 1990,\n84\u201385). Every now and then \u201csomething will occur which my\nphilosophy has not dreamed of,\u201d Thoreau says, which demonstrates\nthat the \u201cboundaries of the actual are no more fixed and rigid\nthan the elasticity of our imaginations\u201d (Journal,\n5/31/53). Since the thoughts of each knowing subject are \u201cpart\nof the meaning of the world,\u201d it is legitimate to ask:\n\u201cWho can say what is? He can only say how he\nsees\u201d (11/4/52 & 12/2/46). Truth is radically\nperspective-dependent, which means that insofar as we are different\npeople we can only be expected to perceive different worlds (Walls\n1995, 213). Thoreau\u2019s position might be described as\nperspectival realism, since he does not conclude that truth is\nrelative but celebrates the diversity of the multifaceted reality that\neach of us knows in his own distinctive way. \u201cHow novel and\noriginal must be each new man\u2019s view of the universe!\u201d he\nexclaims, and \u201chow sweet is the perception of a new natural\nfact,\u201d for it suggests to us \u201cwhat worlds remain to be\nunveiled\u201d (Journal, 4/2/52 & 4/19/52). We may never\ncomprehend the intimate relation between a significant fact and the\nperceiver who appreciates it, but we should trust that it is not in\nvain to view nature with \u201chumane affections\u201d\n(Journal, 2/20/57 & 6/30/52). With respect to any given\nphenomenon, the \u201cpoint of interest\u201d that concerns us lies\nneither in the independent object nor in the subject alone, but\nsomewhere in between (Journal, 11/5/57). Witnessing the rise\nof positivism and its ideal of complete objectivity, Thoreau attempts\n\u201cto preserve an enchanted world and to place the passionate\nobserver in the center of his or her universe\u201d (Tauber 2001,\n20). It is an admirable goal, and one that remains highly relevant in\nthe intellectual climate of the present day.\n4. Friendship, Politics, and Environmentalism\n\nThoreau\u2019s ethic of personal flourishing is focused upon the\nproblem of how to align one\u2019s daily life in accordance with\none\u2019s ultimate ideals. What was enthusiasm in the youth, he\nargues, must become temperament in the mature person: the \u201cmere\nvision is little compared with the steady corresponding endeavor\nthitherward\u201d (Journal, 11/1/51 & 11/24/57). Much of\nour time ought to be spent \u201cin carrying out deliberately and\nfaithfully the hundred little purposes which every man\u2019s genius\nmust have suggested to him\u2026 . The wisely conscious life springs\nout of an unconscious suggestion\u201d (Wild Fruits, 166).\nCharacter, then, can be defined as \u201cgenius\nsettled\u201d\u2014the promptings of conscience in themselves are\nonly potentially moral, until we have integrated them into\nthe fabric of our everyday existence and begun to hold ourselves\nresponsible for living up to them (Journal, 3/2/42). Hence,\nwe need to cherish and nurture our capability to discern the\ndifference between the idea and the reality, between what is\nand what ought to be. It is when we experience\ndissatisfaction with ourselves or with external circumstances that we\nare stimulated to act in the interest of making things better.\n\nIt follows that the greatest compliment we can pay to another person\nis to say that he or she enhances our life by inciting us to realize\nour highest aspirations. So Thoreau views it as deplorable that\n\u201cwe may love and not elevate one another\u201d; the \u201clove\nthat takes us as it finds us, degrades us\u201d (\u201cChastity and\nSensuality\u201d). He speaks of \u201clove\u201d and\n\u201cfriendship\u201d as closely related terms which are tainted by\nthe \u201ctrivial dualism\u201d which assumes that the one must\nexclude the other (Journal, undated 1839 entry). Clearly,\nwhat he is concerned about is the kind of love the Greeks called\nphilia\u2014and in his sustained consideration of\nfriendship, as in so many other respects, Thoreau is \u201csquarely\nin the virtue ethics tradition\u201d (Cafaro 2004, 127). In his\nethical writings, the notion of wishing good on behalf of another\nperson is often taken to a severe extreme, as if he does not think it\npossible to ask too much of love and friendship. In A Week on the\nConcord and Merrimack Rivers, he says: \u201cI value and trust\nthose who love and praise my aspiration rather than my\nperformance\u201d (A Week, \u201cWednesday\u201d). This is\nwell and good, but Thoreau may be going too far when he proclaims that\na friend should be approached \u201cwith sacred love and awe,\u201d\nand that we profane one another if we do not always meet on religious\nterms; it is no wonder that he finds himself doubting whether his\n\u201cidea of a friend\u201d will ever actually be instantiated\n(Journal, 6/26/40). Nonetheless, as a recent interpreter of\nThoreau has pointed out, the \u201cexalted and rarefied ideal\u201d\nof friendship that he upholds does not imply that a friend is merely\ninstrumental to one\u2019s own self-realization (see Hodder 2010,\n129\u2013142). Above all, Thoreau\u2019s discussion of love and\nfriendship provokes us to reflect upon what we can and cannot expect\nfrom our closest human relationships, and on their role in a good\nlife.\n\nIt would be a mistake to consider Thoreau\u2019s political views in\nisolation from other aspects of his thought. It is, for example, his\nunderstanding of wild nature that informs his sociopolitical ideas. As\nwas noted above, nature is a point of reference outside the\npolis which can provide valuable moral guidance, reminding us\nthat society is not the measure of all things. Considering the human\nbeing as \u201can inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature,\u201d\nrather than a cultural artifact merely (\u201cWalking\u201d), he\nlooks to the nonhuman natural world and to our inherent\n\u201cwildness\u201d as a source of evaluation which can empower us\nto discover that the standards of our civilization are profoundly\nflawed. His conviction that nature provides us with \u201ca\ndifferent, truer, and more significant moral reality\u201d than what\nwe find in society provides the \u201ccrucial and often overlooked\npolitical core\u201d to what has been called his \u201cpastoral\nenvironmentalism\u201d (Taylor 1992, 12\u201324). Withdrawing into the\nnatural world allows us to view the state in a broader context and to\nconceive of ways in which social values and political structures could\nbe improved radically. This includes unjust laws that ought to be\nreformed, about which more will be said in a moment, as well as the\nunwritten rules embodied in prevailing expectations about how one\nought to live and what matters. Anticipating Heidegger\u2019s\ncritique of Das Man in section 27 of Being and Time,\nThoreau describes the source of these culturally prevalent attitudes\nas the \u201cThey\u201d (Walden, I; see also Bennett 1994,\n18\u201319) and is critical of their pervasive and corrupting influence,\ntheir way of making people content with distorted values. For\ninstance, most of his fellow citizens of Massachusetts are able to\ngreet each other politely on the street and in church, thinking of\nthemselves as morally decent while remaining complacent to uphold and\nperpetuate the institution of slavery in America (see \u201cSlavery\nin Massachusetts\u201d and \u201cA Plea for Captain John\nBrown\u201d). In denouncing a specific pernicious attitude that is\nwidespread among his contemporaries, Thoreau also seeks to identify\nand analyze the general tendency it exemplifies to defer to public\nopinion: for this reason, his project of social critique is not only\nrelevant to his parochial context but has universal implications. He\nis acutely conscious of the threat that shared modes of discourse can\npose to justice and authentic intersubjectivity.\n\nThoreau is only half-joking when he tells us that, after becoming\nfrustrated with society, he turned \u201cmore exclusively than ever\nto the woods, where I was better known\u201d (Walden, I).\nNot only is it true that a degree of solitude and distance from our\nneighbors may actually improve our relations with them, but by moving\naway from the center of town we liberate ourselves from a slavish\nadherence to prevailing attitudes. \u201cThe greater part of what my\nneighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,\u201d he claims,\nproviding this kind of example: \u201cIf a man walk in the woods for\nlove of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a\nloafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off\nthose woods and making earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an\nindustrious and enterprising citizen\u201d (Walden, I and\n\u201cLife Without Principle\u201d). This warped sense of value is\nall too common amidst the desperation of modern life, with its\n\u201crestless, nervous, bustling, trivial\u201d activity\n(Walden, XVIII). Thoreau builds a critique of American\nculture upon his conviction that \u201cthe mind can be permanently\nprofaned by the habit of attending to trivial things, so that all our\nthoughts shall be tinged with triviality\u201d (\u201cLife Without\nPrinciple\u201d): his polemic aims at consumerism, philistinism, mass\nentertainment, vacuous applications of technology, and the herd\nmentality that conforms to the dictates of an anonymous\n\u201cThey.\u201d During his life Thoreau spoke out against the\nMexican War and the subjugation of Native America, and campaigned\naggressively in favor of bioregionalism and the protection of animals\nand the natural environment. It is outrageous that he is often\nstereotyped as a recluse and hermit. Above all, the political issue\nthat aroused his indignation was slavery. Because Thoreau understood\nphilosophy as a way of life, it is only fitting that philosophical\nideals would lead him into political action.\n\nHe was an activist involved in the abolitionist movement on many\nfronts: he participated in the Underground Railroad, protested against\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, and gave support to John Brown and his party.\nMost importantly perhaps, he provides a justification for principled\nrevolt and a method of nonviolent resistance, both of which would have\na considerable influence on revolutionary movements in the twentieth\ncentury. In his essay on \u201cCivil Disobedience,\u201d originally\npublished as \u201cResistance to Civil Government,\u201d Thoreau\ndefends the validity of conscientious objection to unjust laws, which\nhe claims ought to be transgressed at once. Political institutions as\nsuch are regarded by him with distrust, and although he arguably\noverestimates the extent to which it is possible to disassociate\noneself from them, he convincingly insists that social consensus is\nnot a guarantee of rectitude or truth. One of the most valuable points\nhe makes against the critics of John Brown is that a person should not\nbe dismissed as \u201cinsane\u201d by virtue of dissenting from the\nmajority: Brown\u2019s anger is grounded upon an awareness of the\nfact that slavery is a violation of human rights, and Thoreau berates\nthe law-abiding citizens of Massachusetts for looking the other way\n(\u201cA Plea for Captain John Brown\u201d). Passively and quietly\nallowing an unjust practice to continue is tantamount to collaborating\nwith evil, he claims, articulating a principle of noncompliance that\nwould inspire the philosophically informed nonviolent resistance of\nMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, among others.\n\nWhen Thoreau argues that all of Brown\u2019s actions were justified\nbecause he was an inspired reformer with a sacred vocation,\nhe is appealing to something like the notion of natural right. His\nessay in this respect has a more general pertinence to debates about\nthe individual moral reformer in relation to community norms. It also\nraises the issue of whether political violence can be justified as the\nlesser of evils, or in cases where it may be the only available way of\nending injustice. Usually, he prefers nonviolent forms of advocacy\nsuch as creating \u201ccounter friction to stop the machine\u201d by\nopposing, and acting in defiance of, practices and laws that are not\nrighteous (\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d). Speaking about the act\nof protest that led him to spend a night in jail, he expresses\ncharacteristic irony by saying that \u201cI might have resisted\nforcibly with more or less effect, might have run amok against\nsociety; but I preferred that society should run amok against me, it\nbeing the desperate party\u201d (Walden, VIII). Although at\ntimes it sounds as though Thoreau is advocating anarchy, what he\ndemands is a better government, and what he refuses to\nacknowledge is the authority of one that has become so morally corrupt\nas to lose the consent of those governed. \u201cThere will never be a\nreally free and enlightened State, \u201d he argues, \u201cuntil the\nState comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent\npower, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and\ntreats him accordingly\u201d (\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d).\nThere are simply more sacred laws to obey than the laws of society,\nand a just government\u2014should there ever be such a thing, he\nadds\u2014would not be in conflict with the conscience of the\nethically upright individual.\n5. Locating Thoreau\n\nThoreau has somewhat misleadingly been classified as a New England\ntranscendentalist, and\u2014even though he never rejected this\nlabel\u2014it does not fit in many ways. Some of his major\ndifferences from Emerson have already been discussed, and further\ndifferences appear when Thoreau is compared to such figures as Orestes\nBrownson, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson Alcott. A history of\ntranscendentalism in New England which appeared in the late nineteenth\ncentury mentions Thoreau only once, in passing (Frothingham 1886,\n133). And a more recent history of the movement concludes that Thoreau\nhad little in common with this group of thinkers, who were for the\nmost part committed to some version of Christianity, to a dualistic\nunderstanding of mind and matter, and to the related idea that sense\nexperience is unreliable (Boller 1974, 29\u201335 & 176). A\ncrucial step in Thoreau\u2019s intellectual development occurred when\nhe \u201cdisassociated himself from Emerson\u2019s Transcendentalist\nview of nature as symbol\u201d (Slicer 2013, 181), as one scholar\nnotes. It was suggested above that a better way of situating Thoreau\nwithin the Western philosophical tradition is to consider him a kind\nof transcendental idealist, in the spirit of Kant. For reasons that\nought to be obvious by now, he should be of interest to students of\nKant, Fichte, and Schelling\u2014all of whom he studied at first or\nsecond hand\u2014as well as Schopenhauer. Thoreau was a capable and\nenthusiastic classicist, whose study of ancient Greek and Roman\nauthors convinced him that philosophy ought to be a lived discipline:\nfor this reason, he can profitably be grouped with other\nnineteenth-century thinkers, such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, who\nwere critics of philosophy in the early modern period. Yet he also has\nthe distinction of being among the first Western philosophers to be\nsignificantly influenced by ancient Chinese and Indian thought. He\nanticipates Bergson and Merleau-Ponty in his attention to the dynamics\nof the embodied mind, and shares with Peirce and James a concern for\nproblems of knowledge as they arise within practical experience.\n\nContemporary philosophers are increasingly discovering how much\nThoreau has to teach\u2014especially, in the areas of knowledge and\nperception, and in ethical debates about the value of land and life.\nHis affinities with the pragmatic and phenomenological traditions, and\nthe enormous resources he offers for environmental philosophy, have\nalso started to receive more attention (see, e.g., Balthrop-Lewis,\n2019)\u2014and Walden itself continues to be encountered by\nreaders as a remarkable provocation to philosophical thought. Still,\nit remains true that the political aspect of Thoreau\u2019s\nphilosophy has come closer to receiving its due than any of these\nothers: whether or not this is because such prominent figures as\nGandhi and King cited Thoreau as an inspiration, it has resulted in a\ndisproportionate focus on what is only one part of an integral\nphilosophy, a part that can hardly be understood in isolation from the\nothers. Even if it is a sign of Thoreau\u2019s peculiar greatness\nthat subsequent American philosophy has not known what to make of him,\nit is a shame if his exclusion from the mainstream philosophical canon\nhas kept his voice from being heard by some of those who might be in a\nposition to appreciate it. Then again, as Thoreau himself notes, it is\nnever too late to give up our prejudices. Others have observed (see\nSlicer 2013, 182\u2013183) that, based on the amount of prominent\nwork on Thoreau as a philosopher which has recently appeared, his\nprofile seems to be ever so gradually rising on the American\nphilosophical landscape.\n",
