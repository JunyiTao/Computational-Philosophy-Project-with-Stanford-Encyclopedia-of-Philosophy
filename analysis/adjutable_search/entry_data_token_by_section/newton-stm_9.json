    "main_text": "The Structure of Newton's Scholium on Time, Space, Place and Motion || Discriminating in Practice between Absolute and Apparent Motion\n5.4 Discriminating in Practice between Absolute and Apparent Motion\n\n Having argued his case that true motion consists in motion with\nrespect to absolute space, and thus having dealt to his satisfaction\nwith the metaphysics of motion, Newton turns in the final\nparagraph of the Scholium to epistemological strategies\navailable on his account. On an Aristotelian or Cartesian account, one\ncan directly observe the allegedly absolute motion of a body if both\nit and its immediate surroundings are visible. In contrast, because\nthe parts of absolute space are not directly accessible to the senses,\nit is very difficult, Newton confesses,  to ascertain the true motion of\nindividual bodies and to discriminate them in practice from the\napparent motions. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d he remarks in a rare moment of wit,\n\u201cthe situation is not entirely desperate.\u201d Evidence is available in\npart from apparent motions, which are the differences of true motions,\nand in part from the forces, which are the causes and effects of true\nmotions.  \n\n Newton illustrates with an example. Imagine a pair of globes,\nconnected by a cord, revolving about their common center of\ngravity. The endeavor of the globes to recede from the axis of motion\nis revealed by the tension in the cord, from which the quantity of\ncircular motion can be estimated. Furthermore, whether the direction of\ntheir revolution is clockwise or counterclockwise can be detected by\napplying forces to opposite faces of the globes to see whether the\ntension in the cord increases or decreases. All this can be done in\nempty space where no other bodies are present to serve as points of\nreference.  \n\n Suppose now that, in addition to the globes, there is second system\nof bodies maintaining fixed positions with respect to one another (for\nexample, the fixed stars). If the two systems are in a state of\nrelative rotation, one cannot gauge from just the relative rotation,\nwhich, if either, is at rest. However, from the tension in the cord\nconnecting globes, one can establish whether the relative rotation is\ndue entirely to the absolute rotation of the system of\nglobes. Supposing so, the second system of bodies can then be\nexploited to provide an alternative technique for determining whether\nthe globes revolve in a clockwise or counterclockwise \ndirection\u2014one simply consults the direction of rotation relative to \nthe stationary system.  \n\n At this point Newton cuts off the Scholium, explaining that the whole\npoint of having written the treatise to follow is to show how to infer\nthe true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences,\nand conversely the causes and effects from either the true or the\napparent motions.  \n",
