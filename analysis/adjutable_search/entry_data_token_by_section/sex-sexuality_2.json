    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Sexual Pleasure\n1.3 Sexual Pleasure\n\n\u201cPleasure\u201d refers to various phenomena: (a) physical\nsensations, with specific bodily locations (e.g., scratching an itch);\n(b) enjoyment, as when one takes pleasure in solving a jigsaw puzzle\nor lying under the sun (enjoyment does not have a specific bodily\nlocation, though the same phenomenon can be experienced as sensation\nand as enjoyment (e.g., lying under the sun); (c) a \u201cpure\u201d\nfeeling that is felt all over but has no specific bodily location, and\nthat need not be focused on a particular activity, such as being\nelated (Goldman 2016, 88); and (d) an attitude, to be \u201cpleased\nat something\u201d; the belief that what one is pleased at is good\n(Goldman 2016, 83\u201390).\n\nWe thus have four types of pleasure: pleasure-as-sensation,\npleasure-as-enjoyment, pleasure-as-feeling, and\npleasure-as-pro-attitude. All four concepts can be relevant to sex,\nbut the first two are especially important, because each can be a type\nof sexual pleasure, whereas the third is typically consequent to\nsexual activity and the fourth is an attitude about sex. (a) The\npleasure of orgasm is an obvious example of the first, and (b)\nenjoying sexual activity is a usual experience that people undergo.\n(c) One can experience elation because of having had great sex, and\n(d) one can feel pleased at that (Halwani 2020, 111\u2013122).\n\nMoreover, one or more parties to the act might experience\npleasure-as-sensation, yet not enjoy the activity itself ((a) and\n(b)). One can experience the pleasurable sensations of sex and enjoy\nthe act, yet feel repulsion at the act later and be displeased with\noneself at having engaged in the act ((c) and (d)). We can also see\nhow each pleasure has its opposite when it comes to sex: one can feel\npainful sensations during sex (e.g., anal penetration), one can endure\na sexual act (not enjoy it), one can feel nausea at what one has done\nsexually, and one can have a negative attitude at one\u2019s sexual\nactivity.\n\nAlthough orgasm does not exhaust the pleasures of sex, there is\nsomething to the idea that the pleasure of orgasm is unique. As a\nsensation, it is unique in the way it feels and in its intensity,\nthough this feeling might differ between men and women, especially\nsince women seem to experience various types of orgasm (Meston et al.\n2004, 174\u2013176; but see Wallen and Lloyd 2011, 780\u2013783).\nMoreover, it contrasts with other sensation-pleasures in its\nphysiological aspects and ability to be produced through genital\nstimulation. For example, the sensation of having one\u2019s ear\nlicked is not as such a pleasure and depends on whom one\nthinks is licking it. But the sensation of orgasm is not like this,\nwhich makes orgasm a pleasure that cuts across social layers, a bodily\nsensation unmediated by social meanings or concepts; \u201cthe trait\nof female orgasm [is] a physiological trait or reflex, not a social\ntrait\u201d (Lloyd 2005, 48). Of course its frequency, significance,\nand meaning vary socially, culturally, and contextually (Blair et al.\n2017; Janssen 2007; Mah and Binik 2002). This feature of orgasm might\nexplain how we can speak of sexual desire across times and cultures as\na unified phenomenon, even though sexual desires and bodily sensations\nare socially and linguistically mediated.\n\nIf the pleasure of orgasm is unique, why do people usually prefer sex\nwith someone else to masturbating, given that masturbating produces\norgasms, often more intense than partnered sex? This shows that orgasm\nis not the only pleasure sought in sexual activity, not that its\npleasure is not unique. Touching, smelling, kissing, and licking, for\nexample, are other goals of sexual desire (Soble 1996, 85\u201386).\nWe can even claim that people prefer the pleasure of orgasm\nthrough the other goals just mentioned.\n\nThe discussion of sexual pleasure is important in itself and, as we\nhave seen, for understanding \u201csexual desire.\u201d For example,\naccording to Igor Primoratz, \u201csexual desire is sufficiently\ndefined as the desire for certain bodily pleasures, period\u201d\n(1999, 46). But which bodily pleasures? One answer is\npleasure-as-sensation: those \u201cexperienced in the sexual parts of\nthe body, i.e., the genitals and other parts that differentiate the\nsexes\u201d (Primoratz 1999, 46). More generally, and accounting for\nsexual pleasures not located in the genitals, sexual pleasure\n\n\nis the sort of bodily pleasure experienced in the sexual parts of the\nbody, or at least related to those parts in that if it is associated\nwith arousal, the arousal occurs in those parts. (Primoratz 1999,\n46)\n\n\nTo distinguish a sexual from a nonsexual kiss, we ask which of the two\nis associated with arousal, and we understand the notion of arousal as\nessentially linked to the sexual body parts.\n\nBecause the above view relies solely on sexual pleasure-as-sensation,\nit would have to understand the other two types ultimately in terms of\npleasure-as-sensation. That is, what makes sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment sexual is its connection to arousal.\nThis implies that \u201csensory pleasure is more fundamental when it\ncomes to sex\u201d (Goldman 2016, 95).\n\nIn most activities, the pleasure and the activity are\nintertwined\u2014we do not watch a movie and then feel the pleasure.\nInstead, we enjoy the movie as we watch it. The pleasures here are\npleasures-as-enjoyment. Things are different with sex because of\npleasure-as-sensation, specifically, orgasm. Sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment supervenes on sexual pleasure-as-sensation, and\nit often culminates in orgasm, a result that comes at the end of the\nactivity (though the orgasm as an end differs between men and women).\nWe can then see why some prominent philosophers have considered\ntemperance and intemperance to be about bodily appetites satisfied\nespecially through touch (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics\n1118a\u20131118b).\n\nSexual pleasures-as-enjoyment and as-feeling might thus be parasitic\non sexual pleasures-as-sensations. The butterflies one feels in\none\u2019s stomach at the prospect of sex exist because of the\nexpectation of sensual pleasure, and so does enjoying a sexual act.\nSexual pleasure, especially as-sensation, stands out as a crucial\nmotivation for having sex, and its concept supplies us with a good way\nof defining \u201csexual desire.\u201d\n\nSexual pleasure need not be the primary motive for sexual activity,\nand people have sex for various reasons. Cindy Meston and David Buss\nidentify 237 expressed reasons for why people have sex (though in a\nfew cases they count the same reason more than once), including, in\naddition to sexual pleasure, finding the other person attractive,\nexpressing love, feeling desired by the other, deepening the\nrelationship, and trying new experiences (2007, 480). They are silent\non how many of the nonsexual motives are mingled with the motive for\nsexual pleasure. This question is important because it gets to the\nissue of how primary the sexual motive is in having sex, given that\nnot being attracted to one\u2019s potential sexual partner, even\nbeing repulsed by them, might be powerful enough to trump other\nreasons for wanting sex (people might not have sex just to\nexercise, to boost their self-image, etc.).\n",
