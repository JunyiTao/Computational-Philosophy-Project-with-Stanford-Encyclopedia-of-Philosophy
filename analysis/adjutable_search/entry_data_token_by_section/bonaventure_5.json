    "main_text": "Physical Creation || Matter\n3.3 Matter\n\nThe conflict between Scriptural sources and the Aristotelian writings\non the issue of the primordial state of matter is not so severe,\nbecause in the Aristotelian corpus there is no description of the\nprimordial state of matter, and the other sources available to\nBonaventure are themselves in disagreement. Augustine, for example,\nhad suggested in his literal commentary on Genesis that the matter of\nthe world could have been made all at once, whereas in his\nConfessions (Confessiones) he had suggested that\nthere might be an indeterminate and inchoate initial state of matter.\nThis possibility was further corroborated by such pagan authors as\nPlato and Ovid, who had posited a primordial chaotic state of matter\nout of which the present cosmic order gradually emerged (Plato,\nTimaeus 52D\u201353C, 54\u201355; Ovid,\nMetamorphoses, 43:5\u201345:7).\n\nBonaventure begins by distinguishing the consideration of matter from\nthe actual existence of matter in the order of natural history (In\nII Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q. 1 [Quaracchi II: 294a]). We may\nconsider matter simply as a constitutive principle of things and as\nsuch it is pure potency; this is the way that the concept of matter\nfunctions in Aristotle\u2019s Physics and, to\nBonaventure\u2019s mind, how Augustine spoke of matter in the\nConfessions. But we may also think of matter as it actually\nexists in time. In this respect, matter never exists and cannot exist\nas lacking all form. Such a claim, however, does not require that\nmaterial creation was brought forth as fully formed, even if such a\nposition might be more philosophically defensible than its opposite\n(In II Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q.2 [Quaracchi II: 296b]).\nInstead, Bonaventure suggests that physical matter was created in a\nstate wherein it had a tendency and capacity to admit many different\nforms, though it had none of them in its own right. Rather, its\npotentiality to develop distinct forms required further external,\ndivine agency in order for the distinct things having diverse forms to\nfully emerge (In II Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q.3 [Quaracchi II:\n299b\u2013300a]). Physical matter\u2019s properties in its\nincomplete state included extension and visibility (properties arising\nfrom the form common to all physical things, namely, light). These\nfeatures are still shared by all the items in the physical world, even\nthough Bonaventure admits, in accord with the Aristotelian teaching on\nthe heavens, that heavenly bodies, such as the stars, have matter that\ndiffers in kind from that of terrestrial things. Accordingly, after\nthings were fully produced matter was twofold, terrestrial and\ncelestial, but in its primordial state physical matter enjoyed a\ncorresponding unity that was one of contiguity, i.e., it was one mass\n(In II Sent., d. 12, art. 2, q.1 [Quaracchi II:\n 303a\u2013b]).[19]\n This primordial unity of physical matter continues to have some\nscientific bearing for Bonaventure since it grounds the consideration\nof the general physicist who may prescind from the process of\ngeneration and corruption and consider bodies simply in terms of their\nmobility in place and extension (In II Sent., d. 3, p. 1 art.\n1, q.2 [Quaracchi II: 97a]).\n",
