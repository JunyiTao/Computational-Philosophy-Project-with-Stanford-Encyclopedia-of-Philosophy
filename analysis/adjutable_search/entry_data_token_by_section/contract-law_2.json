If these\ncosts can be classified as harms, then promissory representations\nimplicate the duty not to harm. In other words,\n\n\n[i]f there is a general principle that one ought not cause harm to\nothers, that might be enough to justify some sort of rule against\n[agreement-breaking]. (Craswell 1989: 499)\n\n\nOn the harm-based view, contract law is analogous to tort law\u2014an\ninstance of a broader class of regulations enforcing harm-based\nobligations. More specifically, contract elaborates liability for\nmisrepresentation\u2014including not just fraud but also negligent\nmisrepresentation\u2014especially insofar as analogous doctrines in\nthe law of torts appear artificially cabined.\n\nThe leading contemporary proponent of the harm-based theory is T.M.\nScanlon, who argues that contract law imports the moral principles\ngoverning harm-avoidance into law (Scanlon 1998: 295\u2013327; 2001:\n93\u201394). Scanlon\u2019s view begins with pre-promissory moral\nprinciples that no one could \u201creasonably reject\u201d, which\nforbid certain ways of manipulating others and, moreover, require\npersons to exercise care in leading others to form expectations.\nScanlon explains the wrongfulness of lying and imposing misimpressions\nbased on these principles. He then defends a more specific principle\nof promissory fidelity:\n\n\nPrinciple of Fidelity: If (1) A voluntarily and\nintentionally leads B to expect that A will do\nX (unless B consents to A\u2019s not doing\nso); (2) A knows that B wants to be assured of this;\n(3) A acts with the aim of providing this assurance, and has\ngood reason to believe that he or she has done so; (4) B\nknows that A has the intentions and beliefs just described;\n(5) A intends for B to know this, and knows that\nB does know it; (6) B knows that A has this\nknowledge and intent, then, in the absence of special justification,\nA must do X unless B consents to\nX\u2019s not being done. (Scanlon 1998: 304)\n\n\nThe principle of fidelity articulates a first-order duty to keep\none\u2019s promises, grounded not in the simple fact of promising, as\non the bare reasons view, but in the fact that promises give\nassurances that lead to reasonable reliance and a risk of harm. The\nprinciple calls for doing as one has promised and not just making up a\ndisappointed promisee\u2019s losses, but it does not prescribe any\nspecific legal enforcement scheme. Consequently, an important\nchallenge for the view is explaining contract law\u2019s standard\nremedy for breach, which obliges the promisor to vindicate the\npromisee\u2019s expectation and not merely reimburse her for costs\nincurred through reliance.\n\nScanlon suggests that no one could reasonably reject a legal remedy\nthat protects the promisee\u2019s expectations given the substantial\nbenefits to promisees and the low costs to promisors (Scanlon 2001:\n105\u2013111). But the costs to promisors of a principle requiring\ncompensation for expectations may not be all that low. Scanlon\nimagines that promisors can easily avoid the special remedial\nobligations by qualifying their intentional representations with:\n\u201cof course, I\u2019m not promising\u201d. But such a\ndisclaimer, in the context of a regime that enforces promises,\nundermines the credibility of the communicated intention. A person who\nwishes to credibly signal her intent to perform while hoping to avoid\nliability for her promisee\u2019s expectations appears disempowered\nby Scanlon\u2019s regime.\n\nEven if a principle that enforces promissory expectations cannot\nreasonably be rejected, this still does not fully explain why the law\nfavors expectations. Some alternative remedy might equally fall within\nthe bounds of moral principles no one could reasonably reject. For\ninstance, the law could compensate based on reliance damages,\nreturning parties to their pre-contractual state in the event of\nbreach. Of course, the practical difference between vindicating\nexpectations and reliance-based losses is not always substantial. Lon\nFuller and William Perdue (1936) discuss cases where the two remedial\nschemes converge, as when markets are thick. Where a promisee\u2019s\nreliance on her promisor includes forsaking an identically attractive\noffer, then the promisee\u2019s reliance interest arguably equals her\nvaluation of performance\u2014that is, her contractual expectation.\nMoreover, a number of legal rules cabin the expectation remedy by\nimposing requirements of foreseeability (see, e.g., Hadley v.\nBaxendale (1854)) and mitigating one\u2019s losses (R2:\n\u00a7350); and the law sometimes opts for reliance damages where\nexpectation is hard to measure (see, e.g., Sullivan v.\nO\u2019Connor (1972)). Still, reliance and expectation are not\nalways congruent, and the law\u2019s clear preference for the latter\nrequires an explanation.\n\nA deeper problem is that Scanlon\u2019s defense of a regime that\nenforces contractual expectations does not fully vindicate the law,\nsince it presupposes moral constraints that have no legal analogue.\nScanlon (2001: 105) suggests that enforcing a promisee\u2019s\nexpectation is appropriate only if the compensatory burden is not\n\u201cexcessive\u201d and only if the promisor had \u201cadequate\nopportunity\u201d to avoid it based on an \u201cadequate\nunderstanding\u201d of their situation at the time of promising. But\nthe law does not qualify the promisor\u2019s duty in these ways. A\npromisor might have every intention to comply with a promise and yet\nlater find that, due to events she reasonably did not foresee, the\ncost of her performance has risen dramatically or the value to her of\nthe other side\u2019s promise has fallen. It is hardly obvious that\npromise-breaking in such cases violates the duty not to harm (could\nthe promisee reasonably expect the promisor to keep her promise in\nthis scenario?) or that it would be fair to make the promise-breaker\nliable for the promisee\u2019s full expectation (did the promisor\nhave a reasonable opportunity ex ante to avoid the burden?). While the\nlaw excuses breach if the unexpected costs of performance are\nextraordinary (under the doctrines of \u201cimpossibility\u201d and\n\u201cimpracticability\u201d, see R2: \u00a7261) or if the decrease\nin the value of the bargain is similarly substantial (see\n\u201cfrustration of purpose\u201d, R2: \u00a7269), these excuses\nare only available in exceptional circumstances (a leading case on\nimpracticability, Alcoa v. Essex (1980), involved unexpected\ncosts greater than $50 million). Historically, the common law\u2019s\npacta sunt servanda (\u201cagreements must be kept\u201d)\nprinciple used to be enforced quite unforgivingly (see Paradine v.\nJane (1647)); and while courts now recognize a broader category\nof excuses for non-performance, the law\u2019s remedial demands are\nnot so clearly consistent with Scanlon\u2019s moral framework.\n\nFinally, the harm-based view conceives of promissory duties as arising\nonly when the promisee reasonably relied or formed\nreasonable expectations. This invites the question of what\nmight ground the reasonableness of reliance or expectations. The\nanswer cannot be that the promisor is obligated by her promise and it\nis reasonable for the promisee to expect the promisor to honor her\nobligations. As an account of promissory obligation, this argument\ntravels a (very short) circle. The theoretical problem, moreover, is\ndirectly captured in law, given the contrast between contract and the\nmisrepresentation torts. These torts include, among their elements,\nthat defendants must have failed to exercise reasonable care in making\nfalse statements and, additionally, require plaintiffs to have\njustifiably relied on defendants\u2019 false statements (Restatement\n(Second) of Torts \u00a7552). Moreover, tort law expressly adds that a\nparty asserting liability for misrepresentations must have relied\nspecifically on the representations\u2019 being true, rather than\njust \u201cupon the expectation that the maker [of the false\nstatement] will be held liable in damages for its falsity\u201d\n(\u00a7548). Contract takes the opposite approach. As Learned Hand\nobserved in discussing warranties:\n\n\n[A warranty is] an assurance by one party to a contract of the\nexistence of a fact upon which the other party may rely. It is\nintended precisely to relieve the promisee of any duty to ascertain\nthe fact for himself; it amounts to a promise to indemnify the\npromisee for any loss if the fact warranted proves untrue, for\nobviously the promisor cannot control what is already in the past.\n(Metropolitan Coal Co. v. Howard 1946)\n\n\nIn other words, a kind of bootstrapping\u2014where the law generates\nexpectations of enforcement that it regards as a reason for\nenforcement\u2014is of the essence in contract.\n\nA more detailed look at doctrine compounds the explanatory challenge.\nFor example, the law does not allow contracting parties to escape\nliability by providing advance warning of breach (on\n\u201canticipatory repudiation\u201d, see Hochster v. De La\nTour (1853)). Contractual obligations are imposed notwithstanding\na promisor\u2019s attempt to negate their promissory intent and the\npromisee\u2019s reasonable reliance immediately after an apparent act\nof promising (see Lucy v. Zehmer (1954)). More generally, the\nharm-based view struggles to explain why the law imposes liability\neven if the promisee incurs no reliance costs or when the promisor is\nknown to be unreliable. In CBS Inc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing\nCo. (1990), the seller of a business warranted certain claims\nregarding the business\u2019 profitability. The buyer, after\nindependent investigation, confessed that he didn\u2019t think the\nwarranted representations were true. The court ruled that the\nbuyer\u2019s lack of belief in and reliance on the truth of the\nwarranted information did not relieve the seller of its obligations\nunder the warranty. Such rulings are prima facie puzzling on\nthe harm-based view.\n",
