While\nMendelssohn found himself at home with a metaphysics derived from\nwritings of Leibniz, Wolff, and Baumgarten, he was also one of his\nage\u2019s most accomplished literary critics. His highly regarded\npieces on works of Homer and Aesop, Pope and Burke, Maupertuis and\nRousseau \u2014 to cite only a fraction of his numerous critical\nessays \u2014 appeared in a series of journals that he co-edited with\nG. E. Lessing and Friedrich Nicolai. Dubbed \u201cthe Jewish\nLuther,\u201d Mendelssohn also contributed significantly to the life\nof the Jewish community and letters in Germany, campaigning for\nJews\u2019 civil rights and translating the Pentateuch and the Psalms\ninto German. Not surprisingly, as a Jew with an unwavering belief in\nthe harmonizing effects of rational analysis and discourse,\nMendelssohn rankled both institutional and self-appointed advocates of\nChristianity as well as Judaism. Thus, Johann Lavater infamously\nchallenged him to refute the arguments of the Pietist theologian,\nCharles Bonnet, or convert to Christianity (a challenge that\nMendelssohn effectively disabled with a plea for tolerance and a\nseries of reasons for refraining from such religious controversy).\nSimilarly, some Jewish thinkers took exception to Mendelssohn\u2019s\nJerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism and its argument\nfor conceiving Judaism as a religion founded upon reason alone. In\naddition to the \u201cLavater affair\u201d and his work as editor\nand critic, Mendelssohn was probably best known to his contemporaries\nfor his penetrating accounts of the experience of the sublime, for\nlucid arguments for the soul\u2019s immortality and God\u2019s\nexistence, for his close association with G. E. Lessing, for his\nprotracted \u201cpantheism dispute\u201d\n(Pantheismusstreit) with Jacobi during the 1780s, and for his\ninsistence that Lessing was not the Spinozist that Jacobi portrayed\nhim to be. To posterity he is perhaps best known as the model for\nNathan der Weise, the protagonist in Lessing\u2019s famous\nplay of the same name, championing religious tolerance. In the history\nof 18th century German philosophy, the contrasting yet also\noften complementary styles and approaches of Mendelssohn\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s philosophies play a central role. In a monumental\ncomparative study of their philosophies, Paul Guyer demonstrates that\nboth philosophers are \u201csynthesizers of rationalism and\nempiricism\u201d with different accents and strengths respectively\n\u2013 Kant drawing a \u201cricher picture\u201d of the human\nintellect, Mendelssohn of human experience (not least when it comes to\naesthetics and religion; see Guyer 2020, 4\u20135). \n", "toc": [{"#LifCar": "1.

Metaphysics and epistemology\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s \u201cOn Evidence in Metaphysical Sciences\u201d\n(the so-called Prize Essay) garnered first prize in the\ncontest staged by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences on the\nquestion of whether metaphysical truths are able to have the same sort\nof evidence as mathematical truths. (An essay by Immanuel Kant came in\nsecond place; for a detailed comparison and contrast of the two\n\u201cprize essays,\u201d see Guyer 2020, 27\u201372.) In\nMendelssohn\u2019s essay, published in 1763, he argues that\nmetaphysics pursues its subject matter by applying the same method\nthat mathematics does: conceptual analysis. As he puts it, \u201cThe\nanalysis of concepts is for the understanding nothing more than what\nthe magnifying glass is for sight\u201d (Philosophical\nWritings, p. 258). But Mendelssohn then proceeds to differentiate\nthe kinds of evidence in mathematics and in metaphysics in the\nfollowing way. Like calculus, but unlike geometry, metaphysics works\nwith concepts that are no less certain than those of geometry, but\nlack the transparency and imaginative resources available to the\ngeometer\u2019s concepts. The difference between mathematics and\nmetaphysics lies in the difference in the content of the concepts,\nnamely, the difference between quantity and quality. At the same time,\nthere is a basic harmony between the two disciplines since quantity\nand quality are both intrinsic characteristics of finite things and\nneither quantity nor quality exists without the other (for review of\nMendelssohn\u2019s and Kant\u2019s theories of mathematics, see\nCallanan 2014).\n\nMendelssohn acknowledges that, despite the fact that the method is the\nsame and the content in each case (mathematics and metaphysics) is an\nintrinsic character of things, progress in metaphysics has lagged far\nbehind that in mathematics. He suggests three \u201cobjective\u201d\nreasons for this lag: first, metaphysics\u2019 greater reliance upon\narbitrary signs (signs that do not essentially coincide with what is\nsignified); second, the holistic content of metaphysics (no quality\ncan be defined without an adequate insight into the others); and\nthird, metaphysics\u2019 need to establish the actual existence of\nwhat corresponds to the analyzed concepts. Thus, for Mendelssohn,\nmathematical truths need not suppose more than the appearances of\nthings as long as a distinction is maintained between constant and\ninconstant appearances or, equivalently, between appearances that have\ntheir basis in the intrinsic, essential constitution of our senses and\nthose that do not (e.g., those due to sickness or a faulty\nperspective). \u201cThus, even in the system of a doubter or an\nidealist, the value of not only pure, theoretical mathematics but even\npractical and applied mathematics remains, and it retains its\nundeniable certainty\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 268).\nMetaphysics, by contrast, requires a resolution of the problem of\nidealism.\n\nTwenty-five years after the Prize Essay, Mendelssohn\ncontinues to struggle with the issue of idealism in Morning\nHours, his final metaphysical work. Although he espouses a theism\nthat is compatible with a realist position (what he dubs\n\u201cdualism\u201d as opposed to idealism, materialism, and\nskepticism), he appears to be moving toward a position that straddles\nan idealist/non-idealist divide. He views inquiry into something\n\u201cextra-conceptual\u201d as tantamount to \u201cinquiring about\na concept that is actually no concept and therefore something\ncontradictory is supposed\u201d (Morning Hours, p.\n42/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 60f). A further tilt in the\ndirection of idealism is apparent in his rejection of the traditional\ndefinition of truth as an agreement of things with thoughts, on the\nground that the copy (the thought) cannot be compared with the\noriginal (the thing). Since thoughts can be compared with one another,\nhe turns to them for a determination of truth, though it is not clear\nhow this move can avoid idealism. At the same time, however, he\ndistinguishes truths that are certain (consisting in the\nagreement of thoughts with themselves) from actual truths,\ndetermined by adherence to principles of induction and analogy in\naddition to the principle of noncontradiction. The latter truths are\ntruths about facts outside us or about a causal connection, though\nthey are relative to certain factors: the number of sensations of a\nsingle sort that agree with one another, the number of different sorts\nof sensations that concur, and the number of times our assessment\nagrees with those of others, of other species, and of even\n\u201chigher entities\u201d (Morning Hours, pp. 6f, 37ff,\n41/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 15f, 54f, 59; for review of\nMendelssohn\u2019s epistemology in the undeservedly neglected first\npart of Morning Hours, see Dahlstrom 2018b and, more fully, Guyer\n2020, 123\u2013140). Echoing Descartes, Mendelssohn maintains that\ndemonstration of God\u2019s existence is necessary to certify the\nactual existence of things outside us.\n\nThis ambivalence can perhaps be traced to the mature\nMendelssohn\u2019s growing suspicions that the entire issue\nseparating idealists and those supporting contrasting positions is\nmisbegotten, a product of linguistic confusion (see the discussion of\nMendelssohn\u2019s views on language below). \u201cI fear that, in\nthe end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists\namounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the\nlinguist than for the speculative philosopher\u201d (Morning\nHours, p. 42 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, p. 61). Mention has already been made of\nMendelssohn\u2019s view in the Prize Essay that\nmetaphysics\u2019 necessary reliance upon artificial signs is one\nreason why its difficulties are more intractable than those of\nmathematics. In 1785, in Morning Hours, he goes further:\n\u201cYou know how much I am inclined to explain all the\ncontroversies of the philosophical schools as merely verbal disputes\nor at least as originally deriving from verbal disputes\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 75/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n104; for commentary, see Dahlstrom 2011). In keeping with these\nadvancing suspicions about the origin and the efficacy of the issue\nover idealism and dualism (realism), Mendelssohn eventually comes to\nassign reason a mediating role in disputes between common sense and\nspeculation. Common sense is usually but not invariably right, he\ncontends, and hence reason\u2019s task is to present a defense of\nspeculation when it departs from common sense. For valuable discussion\nof Mendelssohn\u2019s approach to common sense, see Franks 2011. (The\nappeal to reason to mediate and, if necessary, to rein in speculation\nalso plays a significant role in Mendelssohn\u2019s account of a\n\u201crefined\u201d or \u201cpurified\u201d pantheism in\nMorning Hours. On this point, see below \u201c9. Controversy\nwith Jacobi over Lessing\u2019s alleged pantheism\u201d). As for the\nimpact of Mendelssohn\u2019s approach to idealism in Morning\nHours, many scholars concur that Kant\u2019s Refutation of\nIdealism directly takes it up. However, at least one scholar contends\nthat Kant does so by accepting Mendelssohn\u2019s approach (Munk\n2011b) while others argue, albeit for contrasting reasons, that he\ndoes so in order to refute Mendelssohn\u2019s position (Dyck 2011;\nGuyer 2018a; see, too, Guyer\u2019s contrast of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nmore empirically-bent \u201cmodest epistemology\u201d with\nKant\u2019s more rationalist-inspired \u201ctranscendental\nidealism,\u201d in Guyer 2020, 167\u2013201.)\n3. Rational psychology\n\nIn Phaedo or On the Immortality of the Soul, loosely modeled\non Plato\u2019s dialogue, Mendelssohn combines a paean to Socrates\nwith an elaboration of the dreadful personal, moral, and political\nimplications if a person\u2019s life is her \u201chighest\ngood.\u201d A best-seller of its time, running through three\neditions, this \u201cclassic of rational psychology,\u201d as\nDilthey put it, also contains an argument for the simplicity and\nimmortality of the human soul, explicitly singled out for criticism by\nKant in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason\n(for review of Kant\u2019s and Mendelssohn\u2019s different\napproaches to the question of immortality, see Guyer 2020, 142\u2013166).\nMendelssohn supports the notion that the soul is simple and thus\nindestructible by noting that certain features of the soul, namely,\nthe unifying character of consciousness and the identity of\nself-consciousness, cannot be derived from anything composite, whether\nthose composite parts be capable or not of thinking. \u201cWe would\nbe able neither to remember nor to reflect nor to compare nor to\nthink, indeed, we would not even be the person who we were a moment\nago, if our concepts were divided among many and were not to be\nencountered somewhere together, combined in the most precise ways they\ncan. We must, therefore, assume at least one substance that combines\nall concepts of the component parts\u2026. There is, therefore, in\nour body at least one sole substance that is not extended, not\ncomposed, but instead is simple, has a power of representing things\n[Vorstellungskraft], and unites all our concepts, desires,\nand inclinations in itself\u201d (Ph\u00e4don (2007), pp.\n119f (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/1, pp. 96f). As for the human soul\u2019s fate after death,\nMendelssohn appeals to divine goodness and providence, which perhaps\nexplains why, following the publication of the Phaedo, he\nfinds himself needing to revisit the proofs for God\u2019s existence.\nPlaying an important role in Mendelssohn\u2019s development of his\nviews of the human vocation and human immortality in the years prior\nto the composition of the Phaedo is a 1764\u201365 debate\nwith Thomas Abbt. On the topic of Thomas Abbt\u2019s role in this\nregard, his correspondence with Mendelssohn, and Herder\u2019s\ncritical reaction to Mendelssohn\u2019s views, see Pollok 2017 and\nPollok 2018b. For an insightful study of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nanthropology more generally, see Pollok 2010.\n4. Natural Theology\n\nFrom the beginning of his career to the end, Mendelssohn consistently\nupheld the demonstrability of God\u2019s existence. However, not all\narguments were equally compelling in his view. In the Prize\nEssay he contends that probable arguments for God\u2019s\nexistence based upon beauty, order, and design are more eloquent and\nedifying but less certain and convincing than strict demonstrations.\nSimilarly, in Morning Hours, he cites the argument that the\nexternal senses\u2019 testimony to an external world is unthinkable\nwithout a necessary, extra-worldly being, but adds that this sort of\nargument would hardly convince an idealist, sceptic, or solipsist.\nThere are, however, at least two ways in which, according to\nMendelssohn, God\u2019s existence can be established with certainty.\nThe first way is through application of the principle of sufficient\nreason to the certain existence of contingent things. The inner\ntestimony of one\u2019s own cogito attests to the existence of\nsomething contingent. Since the sufficient reason for the existence of\ncontingent things must \u201cindirectly\u201d be a necessary being,\na necessary being exists. Hence, Mendelssohn sums up this argument by\nsaying: \u201cI am, therefore there is a God.\u201d\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 289; Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, pp. 78, 83f).\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s second way of proving God\u2019s existence is\nbased upon consideration of the idea of God together with the\nconditions of nonexistence. If something does not exist, then it is\neither impossible or merely possible. To say that something\nnonexistent is impossible is to say that its intrinsic properties are\ncontradictory, e.g., a square circle. To say that something\nnonexistent is possible is to say both that its intrinsic properties\nare insufficient to determine that it exists and that it is contingent\nupon extrinsic factors that do not obtain. If God does not exist, then\nit is either because the idea of God is impossible or because it is\nmerely possible, i.e., contingent. Since contingency entails\ndependency and independence is greater than dependence, it would\ncontradict the essence of a perfect being for that being to be\ncontingent. Hence, the idea of a perfect being cannot be the idea of\nsomething merely possible. But the idea of a perfect being also does\nnot contain determinations that must be affirmed and denied at the\nsame time; in other words, the idea is not impossible. In this way\nMendelssohn concludes that God exists from the consideration that the\nidea of God cannot be the idea of something nonexistent. While we can\nconceive finite, contingent, entities as nonexistent, we cannot\nconceive as nonexistent an infinite, necessary entity, namely, an\nentity that combines all affirmative features and properties to the\nhighest degree. \u201cIt can either not be thought at all or not be\nthought otherwise than with the predicate of actual existence\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 113/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n154). In this connection, it deserves mention that Mendelssohn rejects\nas quibbling the objection that existence is not a predicate. A\nconcept of existence, he maintains, emerges in all of us in a similar\nway as we search for what is common to what we do and undergo, thereby\nenjoying a universality that is not further analyzable. Thus,\nMendelssohn will allow that existence is not a predicate, that it is\ndifferent from all features and properties of things, and, hence,\ncannot be merely added to the list of properties of the most perfect\nentity. Nevertheless, whether existence is the \u201cposition\u201d\nof all properties of a thing or something inexplicable, Mendelssohn\nstands by his claim that we can only think something contingent\nwithout it. As he sums up the inference: \u201cA God is thinkable,\ntherefore a God is also actually on hand [vorhanden]\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 56 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 78).\n\nTowards the end of Morning Hours Mendelssohn introduces a\nfurther proof for God\u2019s existence, based upon our certainty of\n\u201cthe imperfection of our self-knowledge\u201d (Morning\nHours, p. 107/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 147). We have\ncertain knowledge, Mendelssohn contends, not only of ourselves but\nalso of the limited scope of this knowledge. \u201cI am not merely\nwhat I distinctly know of myself or, what amounts to the same, there\nis more to my existence than I might consciously observe of myself;\nand even what I know of myself is in and for itself capable of far\ngreater development, greater distinctness, and greater completeness\nthan I am able to give it\u201d (Morning Hours, p.\n103/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 141). From the limitations\nof our knowledge of ourselves (or, for that matter, of anything actual\nexisting) together with the less plausible assumption that \u201cthat\neverything actual must be thought to be actual by some thinking\nbeing,\u201d Mendelssohn infers that there is \u201can infinite\nintellect\u201d that does represent everything to itself (Morning\nHours, pp. 103f/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, pp. 141ff; for\na detailed comparison of Kant\u2019s favorable, pre-critical and\nunfavorable, critical views of proofs of God\u2019s existence with\nMendelssohn\u2019s early and late championing of certain proofs, see\nGuyer 2020, 75\u2013141; see, too, Rovira 2017.)\n5. Ethics\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s ethics is a form of perfectionism, resembling the\nrationalist perfectionism of Christian Wolff\u2019s ethics but also\nsignificantly departing from it in ways that echo Mendelssohn\u2019s\nappreciation of aesthetic and affective dimensions of moral life. In\nthe fourth and final part of his Prize Essay, Mendelssohn investigates\nthe extent of evidence in the foundational principles of ethics\n(Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Sittenlehre) and, in particular, how\nit compares to evidence (\u201cthe certainty and\ncomprehensibility\u201d) of geometry\u2019s basic principles. He\nintroduces the discussion with the observation that when someone\nundertakes the right sort of action, that person \u201ctacitly\u201d\nmakes the following \u201crational inference,\u201d a moral\nsyllogism in the form of a modus ponens:\n\n\nMajor premise: \u201cWhere the property A is encountered, my duty\nrequires me to do B.\u201d\n\nMinor premise: \u201cThe present case has the property A.\u201d\n\n\nThe major premise is a \u201cmaxim, a general rule of living,\u201d\nassumed at some other point and remembered on the present occasion.\nThe minor premise is based \u201cupon an exact observation of the\npresent circumstances and on the conviction that they fully agree with\nrequisite properties A.\u201d As in mathematics, the doctrine of\nmorals divides into two parts, the theoretical (instructional) and the\npractical (applied), where the former conveys the general rules of\nliving that serve as the major premises and the latter their\napplication in a particular case. Mendelssohn submits that it is not\ndifficult to prove \u201cwith geometric rigor and trenchancy\u201d\nthe general principles of ethics, i.e., the rational principles that\nprescribe what to do and to leave undone. Nothing is clearer or more\ncompelling, he observes, than Marcus Aurelius\u2019 conclusion that\nthese principles follow from what is common to us as rational\ncreatures. Because human beings have a common power of making value\njudgments (Beurtheilungskraft), all their judgments about\ngood and evil rest upon the same ground, diverging from one another\nonly to the degree that their insight does. There are accordingly\n\u201cuniversal ground-rules\u201d (what Mendelssohn also dubs\n\u201claws of nature\u201d) according to which human beings are\nsupposed to decide what to do and leave undone. Moving freely between\nthe singular and the plural in this regard, Mendelssohn refers without\nqualification to both \u201cthis universal law of nature\u201d and\n\u201claws of nature,\u201d but this looseness can probably be\nattributed to the fact that he entertains three ways of proving and\nthus articulating \u201cthe first law of nature.\u201d\n\nThe first proof is based upon observation. To determine these\nuniversal laws of nature, one need only observe what human beings do\nand leave undone, their various inclinations and passions, and single\nout what they all aim for. What all the desires and wishes, passions\nand inclinations have in common is the pursuit of \u201cthe\npreservation or betterment of our inner or outer condition or that of\nanother creature.\u201d Both those who are virtuous and those who are\nridden with vices aim at perfection, true or illusory, a perfection\nunderstood as the preservation or betterment of their inner or outer\nstate or that of others. From this universal pursuit the first law of\nnature flows, namely, \u201cmake your inner and outer state and that\nof others, in proper proportion, as perfect as you can.\u201d Duties\nto oneself, others, and to God can be derived from this first law.\n(The argument is short on details, to be sure, supposing as it does a\nuniversality and essentialness not afforded without further ado by\nobservation alone.)\n\nThe second proof establishes the same basic law but does so \u201ca\npriori\u201d on the basis of the \u201cmere definition\u201d of an\nentity with free will. The choices made by such an entity are based\nupon what it finds pleasing, namely, \u201cthe perfection, beauty,\nand order\u201d that it perceives or believes that it perceives in\nthe preferred objects. With their unmistakably aesthetic accent, these\nqualities serve as \u201cmotivating grounds\u201d\n(Bewegungsgr\u00fcnde) to act or refrain from acting. Without\nbeing physically coercive, these motivating grounds entail an\n\u201cobligatoriness\u201d or \u201cmoral necessity,\u201d since\nno free spirit could enjoy the opposite of them. This proof has been\nrecently challenged in at least two, complementary ways (Klemme 293).\nFirst, if a free, rational person necessarily chooses to act in\naccordance with her knowledge of good and evil, how can she be\nrequired to perfect herself? Second, why is the law normative and not\nmerely descriptive? These are significant objections but they arguably\nsuppose positions that neither Mendelssohn, the proponent of common\nsense, nor Mendelssohn, the metaphysician, can countenance. By\nunderscoring the imperfection but also the corrigibility of reasonable\npeople, common sense insures the meaningfulness of the injunction to\nself-perfection. From a metaphysical description of the basis\n(motivations, ends) of a rational choice, normative constraints follow\nfor making precisely those sorts of choices.\n\nThe third proof of this universal law of nature is based upon its\nagreement with the final purpose of creation. From the assumption of a\ncreator of the world who acts with wisest of intentions, it follows\nthat promotion of the perfection of the creation must be God\u2019s\nwill. To be sure, might never makes right and Mendelssohn accordingly\nstresses that law is a consequence not of divine power but of the\nright of a divine will. Nonetheless, from (i) the fact that God can\nonly want what is best and (ii) the fact that \u201ca right is\nnothing other than a moral capacity to do what conforms to the rule of\nperfection,\u201d it follows that God possesses the right to\nprescribe to his creation laws that are necessarily rules of its\nperfection. This third proof arguably represents a further departure\nfrom Wolff who rejects the equivalence of the natural law with a\ndivine command. For Wolff, only someone lacking reason has need of\nmotivations other than natural obligatoriness (Klemme 295f).\n\nSumming up these three proofs, Mendelssohn lists three basic maxims\nthat lead to the same conclusion. Whether we (1) consider what is\ncommon to all human inclinations, (2) recognize ourselves as entities\nendowed with free wills, or (3) acknowledge that we are God\u2019s\ncreation, \u201call three maxims lead to the common conclusion:\nperfect yourself and others.\u201d\n\nMendelssohn employs the expression \u201cright of nature\u201d\n(Naturrecht) to designate the sum of the laws of natural\nright resulting from the application of these rational principles to\nindividual cases. Given this one universal law of nature, the concepts\nof moral philosophy are sufficiently connected with one another to\nmake up a theoretical system and it is possible to develop \u201call\nour duties, rights, and obligations\u201d from that natural law. The\nresult is a moral philosophy as certain as metaphysics, namely, a\n\u201cscience of the qualities [Beschaffenheiten] of an\nentity with free will.\u201d At the same time, he contends that the\nderivation, not only of the universal natural law, but also of various\nmaxims from it (\u201cLove virtue,\u201d \u201ccontrol your\npassions\u201d) is as certain as any geometric proof. Yet, unlike\ngeometry, ethics is about human action and this science is, moreover,\n\u201cerected on the grounds of metaphysics,\u201d in particular,\nthe metaphysical doctrines of God, the world, and the human soul.\nHence, evidence in moral philosophy is necessarily even more difficult\nto obtain than in metaphysics. While the foundational principles of\nethics can be proven with the same certainty (Gewissheit) as\nthose of geometry, it is not on the same level with respect to its\nability to be comprehended (Fasslichkeit). Unlike geometry,\nethics supposes the comprehension of those metaphysical truths.\n\nAs for applied ethics, it is in the same position as any other\npractical science in that its degree of certainty is dependent upon\ncontingent and unknown circumstances as well as upon actions\u2019\neffects that cannot be foreseen with certainty. The minor premise of\nthe practical syllogism, determining what we should do in practice,\ni.e., in the case before us, runs through all levels of probability.\nThen, too, there is the possibility that the obligatoriness of some\nhigher-level duty stands in the way of the application of a\nlower-level duty but that, given the situation, this fact escapes\n\u201cthe sharpest attention.\u201d Indeed, what mortal, Mendelssohn\nasks, can be certain that his action is the best that he can do? In\nmost cases, \u201cconscience and a fortunate sense for the truth\n(bon-sens)\u201d must stand in for reason. Like taste in\nregard to beauty and its opposite, conscience and a sense for truth\nare capacities, developed over time, of correctly distinguishing good\nand evil, true and false respectively without the benefit of extensive\nreflection and on the basis of inferences that are less than clear.\nDespite the fogginess of its inferences, \u201cthis inner\nfeeling,\u201d this sense for the good and the true, acts on us\naccording to universal principles that, through constant practice,\nhave been incorporated into our temperament and accordingly influence\nour desires far more than the clearest rational inferences that may\nconvince but fail to stir us. Coupled with the acknowledgment of the\nlack of the appropriate distinct concepts for the particular\napplication, this recourse to conscience as a feeling suggests a\nfurther sharp break with the rationalism of Wolff and his followers\n(Klemme 298f).\n\nBy way of introducing the last segment of this discussion of evidence\nin ethics, Mendelssohn distinguishes theoretical and practical forms\nof approval. While it is impossible to doubt what is a matter of\nintellectual conviction, it is possible for us to act contrary to an\nobligation that we are convinced of. So, too, some truths are\nintellectually convincing but do not move us, whereas other, less\ncertain truths do so, producing \u201clively and efficacious\u201d\ncognition, passing over into the faculty of desire, and even\nmotivating decisions. The familiar reason for this discrepancy in the\nefficaciousness of truths is, Mendelssohn, submits, the recalcitrance\nof inclinations to reason. Approval of a truth becomes practical if\nthe rational principles either gain the upper hand over inclinations\nor put them to its advantage. Mendelssohn identifies ethics\u2019\nfour means of securing the agreement of reason and desire: (1)\nincreasing the number of motivations, (2) practice and habit, (3)\nadding pleasant sensations (for which art and literature are\nparticularly useful), and (4) examples that have been observed or can\nbe intuited (e.g., history, Aesop\u2019s fables).\n6. Aesthetics\n\nMendelssohn makes singular contributions to the development of the\nnewly developing discipline of aesthetics in 18th century Germany (for\noverviews of German aesthetics and Mendelssohn\u2019s place in it at\nthe time, see Beiser 2009, Pollok 2010, Madonna 2011, and Guyer 2014).\nIn On the Main Principles of the Fine Arts and Sciences,\nMendelssohn sets out from the assumption that the human spirit has\nlearned to imitate beauty, \u201cthe self-empowered mistress of all\nour sentiments,\u201d in works of art. He then proceeds to ask what\nthe arts have in common or, in other words, what beauty is.\nBatteux\u2019s thesis that art consists in the imitation of nature\nmerely defers the question or, better, requires its revision to the\neffect that we ask what the beauties of nature and of art have in\ncommon. After rejecting Hutcheson\u2019s appeal to an aesthetic sense\nas a deus ex machina that forecloses inquiry, Mendelssohn contends\nthat the common feature is a sensuously perfect representation (a\ncontention that can be traced back to Sulzer and Baumgarten).\n\u201cSensuous\u201d in this connection stands not simply for the\nfact that an object is sensed by the external senses, but also for the\nfact that an entire array of an object\u2019s features is perceived\nall at once. Unlike the distinct representation of a triangle whereby\nthe intellect distinguishes parts and aspects of the triangle from one\nanother, a sensuous representation is clear but indistinct, that is to\nsay, to have a sensuous representation is to perceive something\nwithout intellectually distinguishing its parts or aspects. But we can\nsensuously perceive an order or harmony to those aspects without\nintellectually distinguishing them. Beauty or the perfect sensuous\nrepresentation \u2014 whether in nature or in art \u2014 accordingly\npertains to forms, orders, harmonies, and \u201cindeed, everything\ncapable of being represented to the senses as a perfection\u201d\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 172). On this definition of art,\nwhat is represented can be ugly or repugnant as long as the\nrepresentation is sensuously perfect (though Mendelssohn does address,\nas discussed below, the mixed sentiment that accrues when the object\nrepresented is unpleasant). From these considerations, Mendelssohn\nderives two necessary conditions of fine art and letters: faithfulness\nof the representation (\u201cimitation\u201d) and, far more\nimportantly, the artistry, even \u201cgenius,\u201d involved. In\nthis connection, he argues that, as far as individual beauties in\nnature are concerned, they are inferior to the beauties produced by\narts. In On the Main Principles Mendelssohn also establishes\nthe general distinction between fine arts and fine science along the\nlines of the difference between natural and artificial signs. Whereas\nthe \u201cfine arts\u201d (beaux arts) \u2014 music,\ndance, painting, sculpture, and architecture \u2014 predominantly\nwork with natural signs, the \u201cfine sciences\u201d (belles\nlettres) \u2014 poetry and rhetoric \u2014 typically employ\nartificial signs. The distinction is hardly ironclad, however, and\nMendelssohn ends On the Main Principles with a discussion of\nways the arts may borrow from one another (e.g., allegorical painting)\nor combine (e.g., opera).\n\nAt one point in the dialogue On Sentiments\n(Mendelssohn\u2019s second publication but first publication on\naesthetic matters), one of the protagonists differentiates three sorts\nof pleasure: sensuous, beautiful, and intellectual (a differentiation\nwhich approximates respectively the three sorts of perceptions\nelaborated by Leibniz and Wolff, among others, namely, confused,\nclear, and distinct). In this context, Mendelssohn explains how beauty\naffords a distinctive pleasure precisely as the unity of the\nmultiplicity of things taken in by the senses (a view subsequently\niterated, as we have seen, in On the Main Principles).\nUnaddressed by this differentiation of pleasures, however, are the\nso-called \u201cmixed sentiments\u201d that we seem to experience\nsometimes in viewing what is otherwise painful, terrifying, or, at any\nrate, does not exhibit the harmony or order typical of beauty. At\nfirst (namely, in On Sentiments) Mendelssohn thought that the\nproblem could still be handled by identifying some perfection in the\nobject \u2014 e.g., the skillfulness of the gladiator, the virtue of\nthe tragic figure \u2014 as the source of the pleasure that we feel.\nSix years later, in Rhapsody or additions to the Letter on\nsentiments, he revises his explanation of these mixed sentiments\nby noting that each individual representation has a subjective and an\nobjective component (for a valuable account of Mendelssohn\u2019s\ndeveloping conception of mixed sentiments, see Pollok 2018a).\nSubjectively or \u201cas a determination of the soul,\u201d the\nrepresentation can affirm some perfection in the soul and thus be\npleasing, even though objectively or \u201cas a picture of the\nobject,\u201d we might find it repugnant. Tragedy is more complicated\nsince the sympathy that we feel for the tragic figure is based upon\nboth objective and subjective perfections (i.e., in him or her and us)\nas well as upon objective imperfection, the pain and injustice that\nbefall him or her.\n\nMendelssohn gives another twist to his interpretation of \u201cmixed\nsentiments\u201d in the Rhapsody and then later in \u201cOn\nthe Sublime and the Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences.\u201d\nExperiences of the sheer immensities of things \u2014 \u201cthe\nunfathomable world of the sea, a far-reaching plain, the innumerable\nlegions of stars, the eternity of time, every height and depth that\nexhausts us\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 144) \u2014\nsometimes make us tremble, but we still find them alluring. It is\ngratifying to experience them, though they confirm an imperfection as\nwell as a perfection in us. In \u201cOn the Sublime,\u201d\nMendelssohn further distinguishes beauty as something bounded from\nimmensity as something unbounded. He then distinguishes extended from\nnon-extended (intensive) immensity. The sea\u2019s unfathomableness\nwould be an example of extended immensity in nature; uniform\nrepetition of temporal intervals in music would be an example of an\nattempt to represent the experience of an extended immensity in art.\nBut Mendelssohn seems to be more interested in the non-extended or\nintensive immensities. \u201cPower, genius, virtue have their\nunextended immensity that likewise arouses a spine-tingling sentiment\nbut has the advantage of not ending, through tedious uniformity, in\nsatiation and even disgust, as generally happens in the case of the\nextended immensity\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 194).\nMendelssohn then introduces the category of sublimity for the perfect\nrepresentation of such intensive immensity, a representation that\nproduces awe precisely because it passes beyond our customary\nexpectations. For an insightful treatment of Mendelssohn\u2019s view\nof mixed sentiments as \u201ca complex account of the multiple\nsources of aesthetic responses to art,\u201d see Guyer 2011.\n\nThere is one last aspect of Mendelssohn\u2019s aesthetics that\ndeserves mention, not least for its bearing on subsequent developments\nin aesthetics. It has already been noted that the pleasures of beauty\nand sublimity are not to be identified as purely sensuous or purely\nintellectual pleasures. In keeping with this differentiation,\nMendelssohn differentiates the sort of approval involved in aesthetic\nexperiences from knowledge or desire, though he insists that aesthetic\nfeelings of pleasure can, nonetheless, serve \u201cas the transition\n(Uebergang) as it were from knowing to desiring\u201d\n(Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 61f; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 169, 307\u2013310). In his adoption of three\ndistinct capacities of the mind and in his appraisal of the aesthetic\ndimension as providing a bridge between matters of truth and falsity\n(capacities of knowing) and matters of good and evil (capacities of\ndesiring), Mendelssohn plainly anticipates central aspects of\nKant\u2019s mature, critical philosophy. A further, though less\nprecise similarity also deserves mention, namely, the likeness between\nKant\u2019s conception of the disinterested character of experience\nof the beautiful and Mendelssohn\u2019s conception of the experience\nas something affording us a pleasure that is neither simply sensuous\nor intellectual. \u201cWe consider the beauty of nature and art with\npleasure and satisfaction, without the slightest movement of desire.\nInstead, it appears to be a particular mark of beauty that it is\nconsidered with tranquil satisfaction; that it pleases if we also do\nnot possess it and we are still far removed from demanding to possess\nit\u201d (Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 61;\nPhilosophical Writings, pp. 34\u201351). For a more detailed\nreview of the robust affinities of Kant\u2019s aesthetics with\nMendelssohn\u2019s (despite Kant\u2019s rejection of perfectionism\nin aesthetics) together with a discussion of certain advantages of\nMendelssohn\u2019s aesthetics in contrast to Kant\u2019s, see Guyer\n2018b. More recently, while indicating how, prima facie appearances to\nthe contrary notwithstanding, \u201cKant\u2019s core aesthetic\nexperience seems deeply Mendelssohnian,\u201d Guyer nonetheless\nidentifies significant differences between their aesthetics. These\ndifferences include Mendelssohn\u2019s appreciation of the broader\nrange of properties \u2013 not least sensory qualities \u00ad\u2013\nthat enter into aesthetic experience and his recognition of \u201cthe\ncentrality of the expression of emotion in the experience of\nart.\u201d Guyer suggests two reasons for these differences:\nMendelssohn\u2019s lack of concern for the question of the universal\nvalidity of aesthetic judgment (presumably imperiled in Kant\u2019s\nview by introducing a role for sentiment) and the central role that\nMendelssohn assigns to emotion in moral motivation; see Guyer 2020,\n245\u2013255.\n7. Political theory\n\nIn Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism Mendelssohn\ndistinguishes church and state in order to demonstrate the salutary\nharmony between them and thus the need for tolerance. In the first\npart of the essay he accordingly argues that neither the state nor\nreligion can legitimately coerce human conscience and, in the second\npart, he maintains that this argument against \u201creligious\npower\u201d is supported by Judaism. The second point was no less\ncontroversial than the first, especially since many Jewish elders and\nrabbis maintained a right to excommunicate. But Mendelssohn counters\n\u2014 apparently erroneously \u2014 that the practice is not\ninherent in \u201cancient, original Judaism\u201d but rather\nborrowed in the course of time from Christianity.\n\nFar from separating temporal and spiritual concerns to distinguish\nstate and church (as Locke did), Mendelssohn insists that \u201cour\nwelfare in this life is \u2026 one and the same as [our] eternal\nfelicity in the future\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 39). Nor\ndoes he base the distinction between church and state on the\ndifference between convictions and actions. \u201cBoth state and\nchurch have as their object actions as well as convictions, the former\ninsofar as they are based on the relations between man and nature, the\nlatter insofar as they are based on the relations between nature and\nGod\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 56f). As far as convictions\nare concerned, neither church nor state can coerce; \u201cfor\nhere,\u201d as noted earlier, \u201cthe state has no other means of\nacting effectively than the church does. Both must teach, instruct,\nencourage, motivate\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 61). What\ncontributes mightily to their potential for mutual reinforcement is\nthe fact that there is also no difference in the make-up of the\nconvictions and duties themselves. The only difference between church\nand state in the matter of convictions is their ultimate sanction.\nThus, the moral philosopher will arrive at the same system of duties\nas the person who sees them as expressions of the divine; religion\n\u201conly gives those same duties and obligations a more exalted\nsanction\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 58). Matters\nare different when it comes to actions where the state can and must\ncoerce, namely, when society\u2019s size and complexity \u201cmake\nit impossible to govern by convictions alone, [and] the state will\nhave to resort to public measures, coercive laws, punishments of\ncrime, and rewards of merit\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 43).\nHerein lies for Mendelssohn the basic difference between state and\nchurch: civil society has, as the product of a social contract, the\nright to coercion, religious society has no such right. \u201cThe\nstate has physical power and uses it when necessary; the\npower of religion is love and beneficence\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 45).\n\nInsofar as Mendelssohn\u2019s argument for religious tolerance has a\nreligious premise, i.e., insofar as duties to others are founded upon\nthe relation to God (\u201cthe more exalted sanction,\u201d cited\nabove), it is less advantageous, it has been argued, than Kant\u2019s\nargument that rests simply on the innate right to freedom (Guyer\n2018c). An analogous challenge from a Kantian perspective concerns the\nimplications of Mendelssohn\u2019s defense of speculation as a source\nof reason\u2019s authority for his view of history.\nMendelssohn\u2019s rejection of the idea of moral progress in history\nand Kant\u2019s endorsement of the idea coincide, it is argued (Sweet\n2018), precisely with the contrast between Mendelssohn\u2019s\nacceptance of an authority external to reason and Kant\u2019s\ninsistence upon a self-legislating reason. For discussion of\nKant\u2019s criticisms of Mendelssohn\u2019s\n\u201cabderitism\u201d (non-progressivism), see Guyer 2020,\n321\u2013337.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Mendelssohn argues that Judaism is, at bottom,\na natural religion, containing no revealed truths not available to\nunaided reason. Occasionally, as Allan Arkush points out\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 20), he speaks more guardedly,\nrestricting this claim to the \u201cessentials\u201d of Judaism.\nEven with such qualifications, however, it is apparent that\nMendelssohn approaches Judaism and its history with a more or less\nDeist view that the original, ancient faith confirmed nothing more\nthan rational truths. Nonetheless, he combines this rationalist\napproach with a conception of revelation that underscores the\ndistinctiveness of Judaism and secures Jewish believers their destiny\nas God\u2019s chosen people. For, while the Sinaitic revelation\ncontains no supernatural truths, it does prescribe a way of life, the\npractice of which stands to benefit all mankind. (The interpretation\nof revelation strictly as legislation and not as adding to the store\nof truths is very likely borrowed, with qualifications, from Spinoza).\n\u201cJudaism boasts of no exclusive revelation of eternal\ntruths that are indispensable to salvation, of no revealed religion in\nthe sense in which that term is usually understood. Revealed\nreligion is one thing, revealed legislation,\nanother\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97). This gloss hardly\ndoes justice to Jerusalem and its significance; for further\ndiscussion, see, for example, Arkush 1994, Berghahn 2001, Gottlieb\n2011, McQuillan 2014, Rosenstock 2010, Pecina 2016, Sacks 2017, and\nGuyer 2020.\n8. Language\n\nMendelssohn finds linguistic considerations at the very heart of\ntraditional philosophical questions. As noted above (\u201c2.\nMetaphysics and epistemology\u201d), in the Prize Essay he\nregards metaphysics\u2019 greater reliance upon arbitrary signs as\none reason for its slow progress (relative to that in mathematics) and\nin Morning Hours he indicates his inclination to regard\ndisputes over idealism as purely verbal. Joining these remarks about\nthe import of language for philosophy are two main treatments of\nlanguage, one at the beginning, the other at the end of his career. At\nthe outset he critically addresses Rousseau\u2019s views on the\norigin of language in the context of the Berlin Academy\u2019s essay\ncompetitions on language (see Sendschreiben an den Herrn Magister\nLessing in Leipzig, the appendix to the translation of\nRousseau\u2019s Discours sur les origins de\nl\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 (1756), and Mendelssohn\u2019s\nreview of Michaelis\u2019 prize-winning essay (1759) in Briefe,\ndie neueste Literatur betreffend and \u201c\u00dcber die\nSprache\u201d (circa 1759)). Michaelis won the Academy\u2019s prize\nfor answering its question: \u201cQuelle est l\u2019influence\nr\u00e9ciproque des opinions d\u2019un people sur le langage et du\nlangage sur les opinions?\u201d). Mendelssohn takes issue both with\nRousseau\u2019s attempt to explain the origin of human language on\nthe basis of a description of the natural condition that human beings\nshare with other animals and with his neglect of any consideration of\nthe providential character of the development of language\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 27). In these early writings on\nlanguage, Mendelssohn emphasizes the interdependence of language and\nits development with the development of innate, divinely-endowed\ncapacities. These capacities include not only reason as the ability to\ngrasp conceptual connections and employ arbitrary signs\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, pp. 9f), but also \u2014 in\ntandem with the development of rational capacities \u2014 the\ncapacity for compassionate interaction in familial and social\nsettings. Thus, on the one hand, the recurrence of auditory, visual,\nand gesticular phenomena enables reason to signify phenomena bearing\nno resemblance to them and, indeed, to do so in a way decidedly\ndifferent from how other animals instinctively employ natural,\nimitative signs (Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 10). In this\nmanner Mendelssohn underlines the interdependence of reason and\nlanguage, understood as the use of arbitrary signs. On the other hand,\nlanguage develops within a process that is social as well as cognitive\nand the starting point for the investigation of its origins is the\nfamily rather than the individual. Borrowing from Condillac and\nchallenging Rousseau\u2019s view of language as primarily a tool for\nsocialization, Mendelssohn writes: \u201cThe drive to social life is\nequally innate in human beings and leads immediately to the occasion\nfor exercising the capacity for language\u201d(Gesammelte\nSchriften 6/2, p. 8).\n\nIn Jerusalem, toward the end of his career, Mendelssohn\nreturns to the subject of language in the context of articulating the\nsense in which Judaism is \u2014 for good reasons \u2014 a religion\nof the spoken rather than the written word, relying on an a living\ntradition to transmit and interpret divine legislation. In this\ncontext Mendelssohn again emphasizes the fundamentally social\ncharacter of language in the context of the performance of rituals,\nwhile calling attention to both the feebleness of ostensive definition\nand the fraught prospects for maintaining the same reference for words\nover time. In the course of arguing that human reason does not need\nsupernatural revelation in order to recognize the eternal truths\nindispensable to its happiness, Mendelssohn notes that Judaism relies,\nnot upon written phrases or formulations that are \u201cestablished\nforever, immutable,\u201d but instead upon a \u201cliving tradition\npassed on by oral instruction,\u201d capable of keeping pace with\nchanging times and circumstances (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97f,\n102f (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8,\npp. 160, 168). Judaism is thus for Mendelssohn primarily a religion of\nthe spoken word precisely as a means of maintaining its relevance to\nreal life in changing, historical contexts and maintaining the\npersonal bonds and Jewish identity among its members (see Sacks\n2017).\n\nMendelssohn adds a further reason for insisting that Judaism is a\nreligion of the spoken word, precisely as a supernatural legislation\nrather than a revealed religion. The constant attention paid to the\nwritten word not only can isolate human beings from one another and\nspeculation from practice, but also can induce a kind of idolatry.\nFrozen in time, the written word can become an idol itself, obscuring\nthe distinction between itself and what it is meant to signify (see\nFreudenthal (2012), pp. 105\u2013134).\n\nIn this connection Mendelssohn conjectures that written language\nemerged in the course of the development of visible signs, beginning\nwith a form of synecdoche where a concrete object reawakens the\nthought of a particular characteristic, e.g., a dog as a sign of\nfidelity. While the move from these objects to images of them and\nultimately to hieroglyphics seems natural enough, Mendelssohn muses\nthat the transition from hieroglyphics to a written alphabet\n\u201crequired a leap,\u201d far beyond ordinary human powers\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 108/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p.\n174). Nonetheless, it is written language\u2019s hieroglyphic origins\nthat Mendelssohn credits with the potential for superstition,\nidolatry, and speculative excess. Because hieroglyphic signs have no\nprototype in nature, they provided potent material for superstition\nand, indeed, Mendelssohn refers to the need for written signs as\n\u201cthe first occasion [Veranlassung] for idolatry\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 113 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 179).\n\nIn the second chapter of Jerusalem, this general account of\nlanguage and its development figures prominently in an argument that\nJudaism is a form of supernatural legislation rather than revelation.\nBy regarding language as primarily a living dialogue between persons,\nJudaism does not lose sight of its communicative function for the sake\nof thought. As a result, theory and speculation remain tied to\nhistorical practice and concrete action. Not coincidentally, the\nlanguage of Judaism is primarily prescriptive rather than descriptive;\neven its written prescriptions are \u201clargely incomprehensible\nwithout unwritten commentaries \u2026 transmitted by oral\ninstruction.\u201d Hence, the use of language in Judaism \u2014 its\nscript and ceremonial laws \u2014 fends off the all too human\ntendency to idolize the language itself.\n\nThe appeal to tradition (oral instruction) is necessary, Mendelssohn\nadds, given the fact that, over the course of time, the laws\nthemselves become unintelligible \u201csince no words or letters\nretain their sense unchanged from one generation to the next\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 128 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 193). In chapter 1 of\nJerusalem he makes a similar claim after noting (a) the\nelusiveness of inner perceptions to the perceiver herself and (b) the\nimpossibility of two people using the same words to express the same\n\u201cinner perceptions\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p.\n66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Where the words in\nquestion designate inner perceptions, there is no possibility of\nostensive definition, no more when uttered today than when uttered\nages ago. Indeed, in a passage that suggests both the inscrutability\nand endless deferral of reference, Mendelssohn observes that\n\u201cwords cannot be explained [erl\u00e4utert] by\nthings. Instead, we must again have recourse to signs and\nwords and, ultimately, to metaphors\u201d (Jerusalem (1983),\np. 66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Nonetheless,\nMendelssohn is more confident about words designating objects of\nexternal perceptions and about the prospects for mutual understanding\nin regard to them. Not incidentally, ceremonial law\u2019s ritualized\ncharacter calls for a recurrent context (including specific objects\nand persons) available to external perception in the course of an\nexchange between persons (including God). Notably, \u2018you\u2019\nand \u2018we\u2019 take precedence over \u2018I\u2019 and\n\u2018it\u2019 in such contexts, as the living references of the\nformer indexicals enables one to refer effectively to oneself and to\nthings generally.\n\nThus, in Jerusalem Mendelssohn stresses the ritual and\nperformative character of language, thereby complementing his view of\nthe inextricability of language and a reason that tempers speculation\nwith common sense. The mature Mendelssohn, keenly aware of the perils\nof ostension in determining reference, tempers the claims of\nspeculation with those of common sense and is more concerned with\nbridging theory and practice in the rites of language than in the\nclaims of pure theory. Nor should it be forgotten that\nMendelssohn\u2019s recognition of language\u2019s basically\nritualistic and empathic character, as a springboard to reason, is\nrooted in what he regards as the possibilities of Judaism (for review\nof Mendelssohn\u2019s philosophy of language, including the\nsignificance of translation and language\u2019s political meaning for\nhim, see Schorch 2012).\n9. Controversy with Jacobi over Lessing\u2019s alleged pantheism\n\nMendelssohn enjoyed, as noted at the outset, a lifelong friendship\nwith G. E. Lessing. In addition to their work as co-editors, Lessing\nanonymously published Mendelssohn\u2019s earliest works and\ncollaborated with him on the piece: Pope, a Metaphysician!\nThrough his popular plays, his influential work as a dramaturg, and\nhis stormy public debates with orthodox Lutheran clergy, Lessing was a\nparticularly daunting and engaging spokesman for the German\nEnlightenment, making him all the more dangerous to its opponents. His\nfinal work, Nathan the Wiseman, fittingly portrays a Jewish\nsage (presumably modeled on Mendelssohn) who makes a poignant plea for\ntolerance by arguing that the differences among religions are\nessentially matters of history and not reason. Along with Mendelssohn,\nLessing embraced the idea of a purely rational religion and would\nendorse Mendelssohn\u2019s declaration: \u201cMy religion recognizes\nno obligation to resolve doubt other than through rational means; and\nit commands no mere faith in eternal truths\u201d (Gesammelte\nSchriften, Volume 3/2, p. 205). To pietists of the day, such\ndeclarations were scandalous subterfuges of an Enlightenment project\nof assimilating religion to natural reason. Mention has already been\nmade of Lavater\u2019s attempt to draw Mendelssohn into religious\ndebate. While Mendelssohn skillfully avoided that confrontation, he\nfound himself reluctantly unable to remain silent when, after\nLessing\u2019s death, F. H. Jacobi contended that Lessing embraced\nSpinoza\u2019s pantheism and thus exemplified the\nEnlightenment\u2019s supposedly inevitable descent into\nirreligion.\n\nFollowing private correspondence with Jacobi on the issue and an\nextended period when Jacobi (in personal straits at the time) did not\nrespond to his objections, Mendelssohn attempted to set the record\nstraight about Lessing\u2019s Spinozism in Morning Hours.\nLearning of Mendelssohn\u2019s plans incensed Jacobi who expected to\nbe consulted first and who accordingly responded by publishing,\nwithout Mendelssohn\u2019s consent, their correspondence \u2014\nOn the Teaching of Spinoza in Letters to Mr. Moses\nMendelssohn \u2014 a month before the publication of Morning\nHours. Distressed on personal as well as intellectual levels by\nthe controversy over his departed friend\u2019s pantheism,\nMendelssohn countered with a hastily composed piece, To the\nFriends of Lessing: an Appendix to Mr. Jacobi\u2019s Correspondence\non the Teaching of Spinoza. According to legend, so anxious was\nMendelssohn to get the manuscript to the publisher that, forgetting\nhis overcoat on a bitterly cold New Year\u2019s eve, he delivered the\nmanuscript on foot to the publisher. That night he came down with a\ncold from which he died four days later, prompting his friends to\ncharge Jacobi with responsibility for Mendelssohn\u2019s death.\n\nThe sensationalist character of the controversy should not obscure the\nsubstance and importance of Mendelssohn\u2019s debate with Jacobi.\nJacobi had contended that Spinozism is the only consistent position\nfor a metaphysics based upon reason alone and that the only solution\nto this metaphysics so detrimental to religion and morality is a leap\nof faith, that salto mortale that poor Lessing famously\nrefused to make. Mendelssohn counters Jacobi\u2019s first contention\nby attempting to demonstrate the metaphysical inconsistency of\nSpinozism. He takes aim at Jacobi\u2019s second contention by\ndemonstrating how the \u201cpurified Spinozism\u201d or\n\u201crefined pantheism\u201d embraced by Lessing is, in the end,\nonly nominally different from theism and thus a threat neither to\nreligion nor to morality.\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s criticisms of Spinoza are discussed below but\nfirst the complexity of his relationship to Spinoza should be noted.\nIn his first publication, Dialogues (1761) he argued that\nmany of Spinoza\u2019s views were compatible with \u201ctrue\nphilosophy and religion.\u201d In Mendelssohn\u2019s mind, Leibniz\nmay have given that \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d its sharpest\nformulation but in all likelihood by deriving its central idea of a\npreestablished harmony from Spinoza. Moreover, as Mendelssohn puts it,\nSpinoza does not so much deny the distinctiveness of the actual world\nas construe it as it is in the mind of God before the creation,\nexisting only as a part of God (Philosophical Writings,\n102ff, 108ff). A quarter of a century later, Mendelssohn recapitulates\nthe latter argument as the key to understanding a\n\u201cpurified\u201d or \u201crefined\u201d Spinozism that\nLessing, at least in the realm of philosophical debate, would not have\ndismissed out of hand.\n\nNevertheless, as noted above, part of his response to Jacobi consists\nin demonstrating the shortcomings of Spinoza\u2019s philosophy. As\nmight be expected, he criticizes Spinoza\u2019s idea that there is\nonly one, infinite, and necessary substance. The idea is arbitrary,\nMendelssohn contends, since one can legitimately distinguish between\nwhat is independent or self-standing (das Selbst\u00e4ndige)\nand what obtains or persists for itself (das\nF\u00fcrsichbestehende). \u201cInstead of proving that\neverything obtaining for itself is only one, he [Spinoza] establishes\nin the end only that everything independent is one. Instead of\ndemonstrating that the entire aggregate of everything finite\nconstitutes a single self-standing substance, he merely shows that\nthis aggregate must depend upon the sole infinite substance\u201d\n(Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 107).\n\nOn a \u201cdeeper level,\u201d as Mendelssohn puts it, he also takes\nissue with Spinoza for failing to account for what Mendelssohn deems\nthe \u201cformal\u201d aspects of both corporeal and spiritual\nworlds. Thus, Spinoza\u2019s conception of extension in terms of\nimpenetrability may explain \u201cthe essence of matter,\u201d but\nit leaves unexplained, Mendelssohn contends, the particular\norganization and movement of bodies. What is unclear to Mendelssohn is\nhow parts can be in motion if the whole upon which they completely\ndepend (Spinoza\u2019s substance) is not in motion. Similarly, he\nwants to know how, on the basis of Spinoza\u2019s account of the\nsupposedly underlying attribute of extension, those parts come to have\nthe particular form and organization of motions and forces that they\nhave, that is to say, as organic, self-regulating entities.\n\u201cWhere can the origin of this [motion and form] be found?\u201d\nhe asks. \u201cNot in the whole, since the whole has no movement. The\nsum [S\u00e4mmtliche] of all bodies, untied into a single\nsubstance, cannot change place and has neither organization nor\nfigure\u2026. Whence the form in the parts, if the whole provides no\nsource for this?\u201d (Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n108).\n\nJust as Spinoza explains the matter but not the form of the physical\nworld, so, too, Mendelssohn charges, he gives an account of the matter\nbut not the form of the spiritual world. In this connection it is\nhelpful to recall Mendelssohn\u2019s differentiation of knowing,\napproving, and desiring from one another. Truth and falsity,\ncorresponding to knowing, provide the matter of the spiritual world.\nWhile they may, as Spinoza maintains, have their origin in thought as\nthe attribute of a single, infinite substance, categories\ncorresponding not to knowledge but to approving or desiring must have\nsome other source. Thus, according to Mendelssohn, Spinoza leaves\nunexplained \u201cthe difference between good and evil, desirable and\nundesirable, pleasure and pain\u201d (Gesammelte Schriften,\nIII/2, p. 109).\n\nYet, while some of these criticisms of Spinoza may be compelling, they\ndo not, Mendelssohn recognizes, carry the day for a refined Spinozist\nor pantheist. Spinoza\u2019s inability to explain how movement and\nvalues derive from the attributes of the one, infinite substance does\nnot, by itself, establish the theist explanation in\nMendelssohn\u2019s view. Accordingly, in Morning Hours he\ncasts Lessing as the spokesperson for a refined pantheism \u2014 a\nmove that figures prominently in this contribution to the\nPantheismusstreit. Lessing is portrayed as someone who, while\nagreeing with Mendelssohn\u2019s theist position, has a knack for\ngiving every reasonable argument its full due. In this context Lessing\npresents a pantheism that characterizes the one and only substance,\nnot only as a source of motion and desire, but also as capable of\nrepresenting every possibility to itself and approving that\npossibility that constitutes \u201cthe best and most perfect series\nof things\u201d (Morning Hours, p. 84/Gesammelte\nSchriften 3/2, p. 115). In other words, refined pantheism\nincludes every aspect of the entire metaphysical system of theism but\ncasts it solely as the object of divine intellect. As a result, a\nrefined Spinozist might wonder how different the positions are since\nthe theist purports to explain these seemingly recalcitrant phenomena\nmerely by appealing to the divine will. A refined pantheist might\naccept the difference between the world (thought) and God (thinker) at\na certain level, but insist that, in the end, the difference is on a\nmerely abstract level since thinking and thought can only be\ndistinguished as long as one is not actually thinking. After all,\n\u201cwho is to tell us that we ourselves and the world surrounding\nus have something more to them than the thoughts of God and\nmodifications of his original power?\u201d (Morning Hours,\np. 84 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/2, p. 116). To pretend to show that there is something that can be\npredicated of things outside God that cannot be predicated of the\ndivine thoughts of those things is to deny divine omniscience.\n\nBut, without further qualifications, this pantheist line of reasoning\nis faulty, Mendelssohn submits, for at least three reasons. In the\nfirst place, it abolishes a distinction presupposed by any truthful\nstatement, i.e., the distinction between original and copy. Secondly,\nthere are indefeasible marks that distinguish a finite\nself-consciousness (as an object and original) from the divine\nrepresentation (copy) of it. \u201cConsciousness of myself, combined\nwith complete ignorance of everything that does not fall within my\nsphere of thinking, is the most telling proof of my substantiality\noutside God, of my original existence\u201d (Morning Hours,\np. 85 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/2, p. 118). Finally, the pantheist confuses divine knowledge with\ndivine approval. God knows perfectly well my shortcomings without\napproving them and requiring their existence. Moreover, that they are\nthinkable hardly explains their existence since the opposite of them\nis just as thinkable. The problem for the pantheist, Mendelssohn\nsubmits, is explaining their existence, i.e., explaining what\nprivileges some divine thoughts over others.\n\nFor the theist, by contrast, there is a ready solution to the problem.\n\u201cThe thoughts of God that come to reality to the exclusion of\nthe rest will have this prerogative by virtue of their relative\ngoodness and purposiveness, insofar, namely, as they correspond thus\nand not otherwise, here and now, to the idea of the perfect and\nbest\u201d (Morning Hours, p. 89/Gesammelte\nSchriften 3/2, p. 122).\n\nStill, the difference between the theist and a refined pantheist is by\nno means this simple, Mendelssohn is quick to add. To be sure, Spinoza\nconceived intellect and will as one and the same. Nevertheless, at\nleast as Lessing understood him, Spinoza also differentiated\nacquaintance with what is true from acquaintance with what is good and\nidentified knowledge of the good with the \u201cwill\u201d insofar\nas through it one thought does have a prerogative over another.\nPantheism, so refined, secures religion and morality no less than\ntheism does, such that, assuming as much, Mendelssohn is led to ask:\n\u201cin what way now does the system defended by my friend [Lessing]\ndiffer from ours?\u201d (Morning Hours, p. 89/Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, p. 123). Seen in this light, the difference\nbetween theism and refined pantheism turns in the end on a speculative\nsubtlety without practical consequences, namely, on different\ninterpretations of the metaphor of divine light. Mendelssohn\naccordingly concludes that, like many another dispute in metaphysics\nand epistemology, the dispute between refined pantheists and\ntraditional theists is purely verbal.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Pri\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"Sec\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Pri\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Altmann, A. <em>et al</em>.
