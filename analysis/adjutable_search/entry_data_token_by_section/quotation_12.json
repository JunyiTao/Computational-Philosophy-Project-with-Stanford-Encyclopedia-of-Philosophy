    "main_text": "Five Theories of Quotation || The Identity Theory of Quotation (or, better: the Use-Theory of Quotation)\n3.5 The Identity Theory of Quotation (or, better: the Use-Theory of Quotation)\n\nThe label \u2018the Identity Theory of Quotation\u2019 was first\nused, as far as we know, by Washington (1992), though he attributes\nthe view to Frege (1892) and Searle (1969). However, the passages in\nwhich this view was allegedly offered prior to Washington hardly count\nas presenting a theory; they read more like dogmatic pronouncements\ndevoid of argumentation. Since Washington\u2019s paper was published\nrelated views have been developed in more detail by Saka (1998, 2004,\n2011a), Reimer (1996), Recanati (2000, 2001) and others.\n\nWashington\u2019s presentation of the Identity Theory is somewhat\ncompressed\u2014the key passage is this:\n\nThe quotation as a whole is analyzed into the marks that signify\nquotational use of the quoted expression and the quoted expression\nitself used to mention an object. All expressions, even those whose\nstandard uses are not as mentioning expressions, become mentioning\nexpressions in quotation\u2026a quoted expression is related to its\nvalue by identity: a quoted expression mentions itself. (Washington\n1992, p. 557)\n\n\nThere are three important components of this\n view:[12],\n[13]\n\nThe use of quotation marks (as in (4)) is a derivative\nphenomenon. The basic phenomenon is what Washington calls\nquotational use (Washington 1992, p. 557).\nThe primary function of quotation marks is to indicate that words\nare used quotationally (or mentioned) and not (merely) used with their\nregular extensions.\nQuotation marks do not refer according to Washington;\nthat which is doing the referring in the quotation is the expression\nitself, so in (2), for example, it is \u2018Aristotle\u2019, not\n\u201cAristotle\u201d that refers to \u2018Aristotle\u2019, i.e.,\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 refers to itself. It refers to itself because\nit is being used quotationally (not with its regular extension.)\n\n\nOne way to get a handle on this kind of view is to consider a spoken\nutterance of (6)\n\n(6)\nMy name is Donald.\n\n\nAccording to the Use/Identity theory, (6), when spoken, is grammatical\n(Washington 1992, pp. 588\u201390). There are no missing (or\nimplicit) quotation marks. When uttered by a person whose name is\n\u2018Donald\u2019 it is true (if \u2018Donald\u2019 is used\nquotationally). The function of quotation marks in written language is\nsimply to indicate that words are being used in this special,\nquotational, way, i.e. not (only) with their regular extensions. In\nother words, \u2018Donald\u2019 can be used in two different ways:\nwith its usual semantic value (its regular referent) or quotationally.\nIn the latter case, its semantic value is an expression.\n\nWe wish that the Identity Theory were not called \u2018the Identity\nTheory\u2019. (In private communication, Washington has expressed the\nsame sentiment.) The \u2018identity\u2019 component is picked up\nfrom the formulation, \u2018a quoted expression is related to its\nvalue by identity: a quoted expression mentions itself\u2019. This\nformulation, however, is deeply misleading, since according to both\nWashington (and later, for example, Saka (1998)), quotations are\nambiguous. They can, according to Washington, refer to types, tokens,\nor shapes (see Washington 1992, p. 594) and according to another\nproponent of this kind of view, Saka, they are even more flexible\n(Saka 1998, see further presentation of Saka\u2019s view below). A\nbetter label would be \u2018the Use-Theory of Quotation\u2019, since\nthis emphasizes the point that a proper understanding of quotation\nrequires appealing to a special way of using language. In what\nfollows, we use the ungainly compromise \u2018the Use/Identity\nTheory\u2019.\n\nIt is useful to contrast Washington\u2019s account with the\nDisquotational Theory. Recall, that, according to DQR, quotation\nmarks have a semantic function and that function is spelled out\nin the disquotational schema (DQR). (DQR) is a semantic axiom. It\ntreats quotation marks as identity functions. Speakers\u2019\nintentions figure not at all in this axiom (other than the intention\nto speak English). There is no need, on the Disquotational Theory, to\nappeal to a special kind of quotational usage. For Washington, the\nquotation marks have no genuine semantic function. They are no more\nthan a heuristic device for indicating that expressions are used in a\nspecial way, i.e. quotationally.\n3.5.1 Other Versions of the Use/Identity Theory: Reimer, Recanati, Saka, and the Picture Theory\n\nSeveral recent views share important components of Washington\u2019s.\nReimer (2003) combines versions of the Demonstrative Theory and the\nIdentity Theory. Recanati (2000, 2001, 2010) doesn\u2019t explicitly\ndiscuss any version of the Identity Theory, but his theory\nincorporates some of its components; it is distinctive by focusing on\nwhat he calls \u2018Open Quotation\u2019 (see Objection 5 to the\nDemonstrative Theory above) and the iconic aspects of\nquotation (see Recanati 2001 for elaboration). Two theories might be\nworth a closer look for those interested in exploring Use/Identity\nTheories further (the second of these is mostly of historical\ninterest).\n\nFirst, Saka (1998, 1999, 2003) has developed a theory that has much in\ncommon with Washington\u2019s (though it also differs in important\nrespects). He agrees with Washington in emphasizing \u2018quotational\nuse\u2019 (Saka calls it \u2018mentioning\u2019), but Saka has more\nto say about mentioning than Washington has to say about quotational\nuse (see Saka 1998 and 2003). Saka also goes further than Washington\nin claiming that quotation marks are not required for mentioning even\nin written language. (For Washington, it is only in spoken language\nthat we can quote without quotation marks). According to Saka, (34)\n\u2018is a grammatical and true sentence\u2019 (Saka 1998,\np.118.)\n\n(34)\nCats is a noun.\n\n\nEven though Saka agrees with Washington that quotation marks\n\u2018announce \u2018I am not (merely) using expression X;\nI am also mentioning it\u2019\u2019 (Saka 1998, p. 127), he differs\nfrom Washington in that he assigns them a genuine syntactic and\nsemantic function (Saka, 1998, p. 128). In this respect he\nincorporates components of what we above called the Disquotational\n Theory.[14],\n[15]\n\nSaka\u2019s account also differs from Washington\u2019s in that he\nemphasizes that quotations are ambiguous (or indeterminate) and that\nwhat they refer to depends on the speaker\u2019s intentions (see Saka\n1998, pp. 123\u20134). For further discussion of this point, see\n Section 5\n below.\n\nSecond, there is one view we have not discussed and which might\n(admittedly with some difficulty) be squeezed into the category of the\nUse/Identity Theory. Quine said a number of things about quotation; in\none passage he writes:\n\n\u2026a quotation is not a description but a hieroglyph; it\ndesignates its object not by describing it in terms of other objects,\nbut by picturing it. (Quine 1940, p. 26)\n\n\nDavidson (1979), taking his cue from this passage and others, baptized\nthe view intimated in Quine\u2019s passage as \u2018the Picture\nTheory of Quotation\u2019 (cf., also, Christensen 1967, p. 362). As\nDavidson notes, on this view:\n\n\u2026it is not the entire quotation, that is, expression named plus\nquotation marks, that refers to the expression, but rather the\nexpression itself. The role of the quotation marks is to indicate how\nwe are to take the expression within: the quotation marks constitute a\nlinguistic environment within which expressions do something\nspecial\u2026 (Davidson 1979, pp. 83\u201384)\n\n\nNotice that according to Davidson\u2019s description of this view,\nthe quotation marks per se have no semantic function; rather,\nthey indicate that the words are being used in a special way. They are\nbeing used \u2018autonymously\u2019, that is, to name themselves. So\nunderstood, the Picture Theory has at least this much in common with a\nUse/Identity Theory: they agree that quotation marks are inessential;\nthey only indicate a special use. They indicate that expressions are\nbeing used as a picture (or as a hieroglyph). The Picture\nTheory\u2014if it\u2019s even appropriate to call it a\ntheory\u2014is never elaborated in any great detail and we suspect\nthat if it were, it would become obvious that it is a version of the\nUse/Identity Theory.\n3.5.2 Strengths of the Use/Identity Theory\n\nUse/Identity Theorists claim that their theories are explanatorily\nmore powerful than traditional semantic theories. By seeing quotation\nmarks as a parasitic phenomenon, they are able to explain the\nsemantics of both quotation and this more general phenomenon in a\nunified way.\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal of specific data that these theories claim\nto be able to explain. The most important of these is the possibility\nof mentioning without quotation marks (as in spoken language and in\nwritten language when no quotation marks are used). If we take\nappearances at face value, that means meta-linguistic discourse (call\nit mentioning or quotational use) can take place in the absence of\nquotation marks. Hence, an account of meta-linguistic discourse must\nproceed independently of an account of the semantics (or pragmatics)\nfor quotation marks.\n\nThe following are additional claims made on behalf of the Use/Identity\nTheory (we take it to be an open question at this point whether these\npoints are sustainable):\n\nWhatever can be mentioned can be quoted. If new symbols and signs\ncan be mentioned, then they can also be quoted; hence, (BQ3) is\nsatisfied.\nThere is, on this view, often a particularly close relationship\nbetween the quoted material and the referent; sometimes it is\nidentity, sometimes it is instantiation, etc, so in various ways we\nmight say that (BQ4) is satisfied.\nIf our capacity for mentioning is limitless, then we have an\naccount of how quotation can be too (i.e., we have at least the\nbeginning of an account of (BQ1)).\n\n3.5.3 Weaknesses of the Use/Identity Theory\n\nDiscussion of the Use/Identity Theories is not yet as extensive as\ndiscussion of the Demonstrative Theory, so there are fewer objections\nto report. We discuss four concerns that have surfaced in various\ndiscussions.\n\nQuestion about the Relevance of Quotational Use/Mention:\nUse/Identity Theories put a great deal of weight on the idea that the\nsemantics for quotation cannot be developed without an account of\nquotational usage (mention in Saka\u2019s\nterminology.) There are several reasons for doubting this, two of\nwhich are these:\n\nIt is not obvious that the alleged phenomenon of mention without\nquotation marks is genuine. It might very well be, as mentioned in\nconnection with Objection 3 to the Demonstrative Theory, that it is\nnot possible to mention without using quotation marks. The cases\nappealed to might all turn out to be cases in which a conversational\nor conventional implicature is generated and where that implicature\ncontains quotation marks. Alternatively, the quotation marks might\nactually be in the logical form of the sentence through some form of\nellipsis. (See Garcia-Carpintero 1994 and Cappelen and Lepore\n1999).\nEven if we suppose that the phenomenon of mentioning without\nquotation marks is genuine, it is not clear why we should consider it\nrelevant to the semantics for quotation. Suppose that you\u2019re in\nthe business of trying to develop a semantic theory of sentences with\nquotation marks. Suppose it also turns out that it is possible to talk\nabout language by mentioning without the use of quotation marks. This\nmight just be a different way of talking about language. An\ninteresting phenomenon, no doubt, but not one that needs to have\nanything to do with the semantics for sentences containing quotation\nmarks. It does not follow from there being a variety of ways in which\nlanguage can be used to talk about language, that all of these ways\nare relevant to the semantics of quotation.\n\n\nQuestion about the Semantics-Pragmatics Divide: On the\nUse/Identity Theory, a lot of work is done by pragmatic mechanisms.\nThe appeal to speaker intentions plays a central role on all levels of\nanalysis. On Saka\u2019s view, for example, what a quoted expression\nrefers to is largely up to the speaker\u2019s intentions (and, maybe,\nwhat\u2019s salient in the context of utterance). A consequence of\nthis view is that there is no guarantee, for example, that an\nutterance of (35) or (36) will be true:\n\n(35)\n\u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 = \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019\n(36)\n\u2018run\u2019 is a verb in English\n\n\nThe two \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019s in (35) could refer to different\nobjects; the \u201crun\u201d in (36) might refer to, for example, a\nconcept (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999b and Saka 1999, 2003, 2011).\n\nOver-generation Problems: According to Use/Identity Theories,\nyou can do a lot with quotation. The question is whether this results\nin such theories running into problems of over-generation. Take, for\nexample, Saka\u2019s claim that a quotation refers to an item\nassociated with the expression. There\u2019s only one\nrestriction: This item cannot be the expression\u2019s regular\nextension. If this is the sole restriction on what quotations\ncan be used to refer to, we should be able to do things with quotation\nthat there\u2019s no evidence that we can. It could, for example, be\nthe case that in a particular context, the (regular) extension of\n\u2018love\u2019, call it love, was associated with the\nexpression \u2018money\u2019; maybe, for some reason, that\nassociation was contextually salient. Nonetheless, (37) cannot be used\nto say that love plays a central role in many peoples\u2019\nlives.\n\n(37)\n\u2018Money\u2019 plays a central role in many peoples\u2019\nlives.\n\n\nUse/Identity Theories have to explain what blocks such readings (or\nshow that they are possible). (See Saka 2003, and Cappelen and Lepore\n2003.)\n\nDual Use-Mention (BQ6): Washington says that quotation marks\nindicate quotational usage and that expressions used quotationally\nrefer to themselves (or some related entity). If so, the logical form\nof (12) should be that of (17), clearly not a correct result.\n\n(12)\nQuine said that quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n(17)\nQuine said that quotation\n Ted.[16]\n\n\n\nIt is at least a challenge to Identity/Use theorists to explain how\nthe theory can accommodate simultaneous use and mention.\n\nIn addition to the above points, there\u2019s a lively debate about\nthe specifics of identity/use theories. For discussions of Saka, see\nCappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), and for discussions of\nRecanati, see Cappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), Benbaji\n(2003, 2004a, 2004b), and Cumming (2003).\n\nWe now turn from discussions of large-scale theories of quotation to\ndiscussions of how to understand specific aspects of our quotational\npractice. Two issues have been particularly important in the recent\ndiscussions: Mixed Quotation and the alleged ambiguity of quotations.\nOne\u2019s view of these issues has wide reaching implications for\nwhich theory of quotation one favors. We discuss these in turn.\n",
