    "main_text": "The surviving works || Commentary on Hermogenes\n4. Influence\n\nSince most of Syrianus\u2019 work is lost, it is not easy precisely\nto gauge the reach and depth of his influence, but it is safe to\nassume that it was considerable. Syrianus had two important pupils who\ndetermined the philosophical culture in Alexandria and Athens\nrespectively. One of these was Hermias of Alexandria, the father of\nAmmonius, a most influential later commentator on Aristotle. Hermias\ndid not stay in Athens but returned to Alexandria to teach philosophy\nthere, passing away prematurely in his forties. By him we possess a\ntranscript of lectures (scholia) on Plato\u2019s Phaedrus,\nand it is generally supposed that the work draws on the lectures of\nSyrianus which Hermias attended, although Hermias nowhere mentions\nSyrianus by name (a not uncommon practice). As already stated above,\nthe other pupil of Syrianus was the eminent Proclus, a student of\nSyrianus\u2019 at roughly the same time as Hermias. In contrast to\nthe latter, Proclus frequently acknowledges Syrianus in his writing.\nProclus possessed an unusually powerful ability to synthesize and\nsystematize Platonism, and it seems reasonable to suppose that many a\ndoctrine he subscribed to he had learned from Syrianus.\n\nCopies of Syrianus\u2019 commentary on the Metaphysics were\navailable in Alexandria several generations after his death and used\nby Asclepius of Tralles and, if the attribution of the commentary on\nthe Metaphysics of Ps.-Alexander to Michael of Ephesus is\ncorrect (see above), his work was available in Constantinople in the\n12th century. The first Renaissance Latin translation of\nSyrianus was produced by Bagnoli and published in Venice in 1558.\n",
