(O2)\n\nAlthough ontology is often understood as the discipline that tries to\nfind out what there is, or what exists, this is rejected by many in\nthe contemporary debate. These philosophers think that the job of\nontology is something different, and there is disagreement among them\nwhat it is more precisely. Among the proposed options are the projects\nof finding out what is real, or what is fundamental, or what the\nprimary substances are, or what reality is like in itself, or\nsomething like this. Proponents of these approaches often find the\nquestions about what there is too inconsequential and trivial to take\nthem to be the questions for ontology. Whether there are numbers, say,\nis trivially answered in the affirmative, but whether numbers are\nreal, or whether they are fundamental, or primary substances, etc., is\nthe hard and ontological question. See Fine (2009) and Schaffer (2009)\nfor two approaches along these lines. But such approaches have their\nown problems. For example, it is not clear whether the question\nwhether numbers are real is any different than the question whether\nnumbers exist. If one were to ask whether the Loch Ness monster is\nreal, it would naturally be understood as just the same question as\nwhether the Loch Ness monster exists. If it is supposed to be a\ndifferent question, is this due to simple stipulation, or can we make\nthe difference intelligible? Similarly, it is not clear whether the\nnotion of what is fundamental can carry the intended metaphysical\nweight. After all, there is a perfectly clear sense in which prime\nnumbers are more fundamental in arithmetic than even numbers, but this\nisn\u2019t to hold the metaphysical priority of prime numbers over\nother numbers, but simply to hold that they are mathematically special\namong the numbers. Thus to ask whether numbers are fundamental is not\neasily seen as a metaphysical alternative to the approach to ontology\nthat asks whether numbers exist. See Hofweber (2009; 2006, chapter 13)\nfor a critical discussion of some approaches to ontology that rely on\nnotions of reality or fundamentality. Whether such approaches to\nontology are correct is a controversial topic in the debate about\nontology which we will not focus on here. However, this approach gives\nrise to a special connection between logic and ontology which we will\ndiscuss in the following.\n\nThe relation between the different approaches to ontology mentioned\njust above is unclear. Is something that is part of reality as it is\nin itself something which is fundamental, or which is real in the\nrelevant sense? Although it is unclear how these different approaches\nrelate to each other, all of them have the potential for allowing for\nthat our ordinary description of the world in terms of mid-size\nobjects, mathematics, morality, and so on, is literally true, while at\nthe same time these truths leave it open what the world, so to speak,\ndeep down, really, and ultimately is like. To use one way of\narticulating this, even though there are tables, numbers, and values,\nreality in itself might contain none of them. Reality in itself might\ncontain no objects at all, and nothing normative. Or it might. The\nordinary description of the world, on this conception, leaves it\nlargely open what reality in itself is like. To find that out is the\njob of metaphysics, in particular ontology. We might, given our\ncognitive setup, be forced to think of the world as one of objects,\nsay. But that might merely reflect how reality is for us. How it is in\nitself is left open.\n\nWhether the distinction between reality as it is for us and as it is\nin itself can be made sense of is an open question, in particular if\nit is not simply the distinction between reality as it appears to us,\nand as it really is. This distinction would not allow for the option\nthat our ordinary description of reality is true, while the question\nhow reality is in itself is left open by this. If our ordinary\ndescription were true then this would mean that how reality appears to\nus is how it in fact is. But if this distinction can be made sense of\nas intended then it gives rise to a problem about how to characterize\nreality as it is in itself, and this gives rise to a role for logic in\nthe sense of (L1).\n\nIf we are forced to think of the world in terms of objects because of\nour cognitive makeup then it would be no surprise that our natural\nlanguage forces us to describe the world in terms of objects. And\narguably some of the central features of natural languages do exactly\nthat. It represents information in terms of subject and predicate,\nwhere the subject paradigmatically picks out an object and the\npredicate paradigmatically attributes a property to it. If this is\ncorrect about natural language then it seems that natural language is\nutterly unsuitable to describe reality as it is in itself if the\nlatter does not contain any objects at all. But then, how are we to\ndescribe reality as it is in itself?\n\nSome philosophers have proposed that natural language might be\nunsuitable for the purposes of ontology. It might be unsuitable since\nit carries with it too much baggage from our particular conceptual\nscheme. See Burgess 2005 for a discussion. Or it might be unsuitable\nsince various expressions in it are not precise enough, too context\nsensitive, or in other ways not ideally suited for the philosophical\nproject. These philosophers propose instead to find a new, better\nsuited language. Such a language likely will be a major departure from\nnatural language and instead will be a formal, artificial language.\nThis to be found language is often called \u2018ontologese\u2019\n(Dorr 2005, Sider 2009, Sider 2011), or \u2018the fundamental\nlanguage\u2019. The task thus is to find the fundamental language, a\nlanguage in the sense of (L1), to properly carry out ontology, in the\nnew and revised sense of (O2): the project of finding out what reality\nfundamentally, or in itself, etc., is like. For a critical discussion\nof the proposal that we should be asking the questions of ontology in\nontologese, see Thomasson 2015 (chapter 10).\n\nBut this idea of a connection between (L1) and (O2) is not\nunproblematic. First there is a problem about making this approach to\n(O2) more precise. How to understand the notion of \u2018reality in\nitself\u2019 is not at all clear, as is well known. It can\u2019t\njust mean: reality as it would be if we weren\u2019t in it. On this\nunderstanding it would simply be the world as it is except with no\nhumans in it, which would in many of its grander features be just as\nit in fact is. But then what does it mean? Similar, but different,\nworries apply to those who rely on notions like\n\u2018fundamental\u2019, \u2018substance\u2019, and the like. We\nwon\u2019t pursue this issue here, though. Second, there is a serious\nworry about how the formal language which is supposed to be the\nfundamental language is to be understood. In particular, is it\nsupposed to be merely an auxiliary tool, or an essential one? This\nquestion is tied to the motivation for a formal fundamental language\nin the first place. If it is merely to overcome ambiguities,\nimperfections, and context sensitivities, then it most likely will\nmerely be an auxiliary, but not essential tool. After all, within\nnatural language we have many means available to get rid of\nambiguities, imperfections and context sensitivities. Scope\nambiguities can be often quite easily be overcome with scope markers.\nFor example, the ambiguities in \u2018\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)\u2019\ncan be overcome as: \u2018either \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)\u2019 on\nthe one hand, and \u2018\\(A\\) and either \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)\u2019, on\nthe other. Other imprecisions can often, and maybe always, be overcome\nin some form or other. Formal languages are useful and often\nconvenient for precisification, but they don\u2019t seem to be\nessential for it.\n\nOn other hand, the formal fundamental language might be taken to be\nessential for overcoming shortcomings or inherent features of our\nnatural language as the one alluded to above. If the subject-predicate\nstructure of our natural languages brings with it a object-property\nway of representing the world, and if that way of representing the\nworld is unsuitable for representing how reality is in itself, then a\ncompletely different language might be required, and not simply be\nuseful, to describe fundamental reality. Alternatively, if the formal\nlanguage is needed to articulate real existence, as we might\nbe tempted to put it, something which we can\u2019t express in\nEnglish or other natural languages, then, too, it would be essential\nfor the project of ontology. But if the formal language is needed to\ndo something that our natural language can\u2019t do, then what do\nthe sentences in the formal language mean? Since they do something our\nnatural language can\u2019t do, we won\u2019t be able to translate\ntheir meanings into our natural language. If we could then our natural\nlanguage would be able to say what these sentences say, which by\nassumption it can\u2019t do. But then what do sentences in the\nfundamental language mean? If we can\u2019t say or think what these\nsentences say, what is the point for us to use it to try to describe\nreality as it is in itself with them? Can we even make sense of the\nproject of finding out which sentences in such a language are correct?\nAnd why should we care, given that we can\u2019t understand what\nthese sentences mean?\n\nA sample debate related to the issues discussed in this section is the\ndebate about whether it might be that reality in itself does not\ncontain any objects. See, for example, Hawthorne and Cortens 1995,\nBurgess 2005, and Turner 2011. Here the use of a variable and\nquantifier free language like predicate functor logic as the\nfundamental language is a recurring theme.\n\nFormal languages might be called upon to help overcome an inherent\nflaw built into our natural languages, as discussed above, or they\nmight be called upon to overcome a limitation of our natural\nlanguages. One such limitation might be an expressive one. For\nexample, it is unclear whether our natural languages contain truly\nhigher-order quantifiers, ones that interact with, say, predicates or\nsentences directly, as opposed to just terms. If our natural languages\nare limited in this way, then it might be tempting to carry out\nmetaphysics and ontology in a higher-order formal languages, which\ndoes not suffer such a limitation. And since such formal languages can\nbe characterized precisely, that gives rise to the possibility of\ngiving precise proofs of various statements of metaphysical\nsignificance. This project is pursued under the label higher-order\nmetaphysics by several contemporary philosophers in some from or\nother, see, for example, Williamson 2003 and Dorr 2016. For\ncriticism, see Hofweber 2022. This approach can be seen as\ngeneralizing formal ontology in the sense of section 4.3 to formal\nmetaphysics, and is related to some of the approaches to formal\nontology discussed above. \n",
