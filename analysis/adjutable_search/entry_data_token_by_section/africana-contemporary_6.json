    "main_text": "Stage one: emergence || Characteristic themes\n4.1 Characteristic themes\n\nAfter noting the framing themes of (1) Africanaity and (2)\nproblematicity, as discussed above, we might follow Gordon (2008) and\nOutlaw (2017) in noting additional preoccupations like the\nfollowing:\n\nPhilosophical anthropology (because the question of the human of\ncourse looms large for people whose assumed status as subhuman is one\nof the foundation stones of European modernity)\nLiberation (for obvious reasons, beginning with the ethical and\nexistential burdens of living in oppressive circumstances and of\nfinding the balance between justifiable resistance and unethical\noverreach)\nMeta-reflections on reason (because the meaning of reason looms\nlarge for people typically assumed to be emotive, sensual,\nnon-rational brutes, people whose life chances were constrained by,\namong other things, powerful forms of what we now call epistemic\ninjustice)\nIdentity and self-consciousness (because epistemic injustice often\nhampers the pursuit of self-knowledge, and raises the ethical and\nexistential stakes of responsibly constructing the self)\nTheoretical archaeology (this is Dotson\u2019s (2017) term for,\nas Outlaw puts it (2004), the recovery of underappreciated\ncontributions by African-descended individuals and cultures)\n\n\nThese themes are not at all the exclusive preserve of Africana\nthinkers. The key to Africana thought is the way these themes converge\non and grow out of the condition of Africanaity, which is bound up\nwith distinctive modes of racialization and rooted in a particular\nuniverse of overlapping but distinct histories, geographies, and\ncultural practices.\n\nAfricana philosophy of course puts many more themes in play than these\nfew. But extending the list and reducing the space available for\nexplaining what the list means is at this point less useful than\nconsidering what it means for this enterprise to be rooted in\noverlapping sociohistorical contexts. This requires shifting from a\nstudy of unifying themes to a reflection on the centrifugal forces\nthat pull Africana philosophers in the direction of distinctive\nregional and methodological preoccupations.\n\nBefore moving on to these narrower considerations of region and\nmethod, though, a final overarching theme requires mention. Adeshina\nAfolayan and Toyin Falola conclude their introduction to the excellent\nPalgrave Handbook of African Philosophy by identifying a\nnewly pressing need that informs their editorial approach. African\nphilosophers have, they say, long focused on consolidating their\nprofessional standing and navigating intramural scholarly debates.\nHowever understandable that was, it is time, Afolayan and Falola\nsuggest, for \u201cAfrican philosophy to get on the street and get\ntheir theories dirtied by the predicament on the continent\u201d\n(Afolayan and Falola 2017, 12). In other words, African philosophy\nshould embrace its status as what Outlaw (2017), following Leonard\nHarris (following Frederick Douglass), calls a \u201cphilosophy born\nof struggle.\u201d This is clearly one of the overriding themes for\nAfricana philosophy as a whole, and should be added to the list.\n\nPhilosophy born of struggle (because philosophical reflection is\nnot a leisure exercise devoted to unwinding abstract puzzles, or it is\nnot just or always or most crucially that. It is (among other things)\na practice of bringing philosophical impulses and resources to bear on\ncertain pressing problems of life, and of exercising philosophical\nimpulses unrelated to those problems\u2014impulses related instead,\nsay, to beauty, or to the theory of knowledge\u2014despite the\nburdens of frequently problematic situations)\n\n",
