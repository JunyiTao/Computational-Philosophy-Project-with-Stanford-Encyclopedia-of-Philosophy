    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories\n2. The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories\n\nThe complex and multi-faceted character of linguistic phenomena means\nthat the discipline of linguistics has a whole complex of\ndistinguishable subject matters associated with different research\nquestions. Among the possible topics for investigation are these:\n\nthe capacity of humans to acquire, use, and invent languages;\nthe abstract structural patterns (phonetic, morphological,\nsyntactic, or semantic) found in a particular language under some\nidealization;\nsystematic structural manifestations of the use of some particular\nlanguage;\nthe changes in a language or among languages across time;\nthe psychological functioning of individuals who have successfully\nacquired particular languages;\nthe psychological processes underlying speech or linguistically\nmediated thinking in humans;\nthe evolutionary origin of (i), and/or (ii).\n\n\nThere is no reason for all of the discipline of linguistics to\nconverge on a single subject matter, or to think that the entire field\nof linguistics cannot have a diverse range of subject matters. To give\na few examples:\n\nThe influential Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1916)\ndistinguished between langue, a socially shared set of\nabstract conventions (compare with (ii)) and parole, the\nparticular choices made by a speaker deploying a language (compare\n(iii)).\nThe anthropological linguist Edward Sapir (1921, 1929) thought\nthat human beings have a seemingly species-universal capacity to\nacquire and use languages (compare (i)), but his own interest was\nlimited to the systematic structural features of particular languages\n(compare (ii)) and the psychological reality of linguistic units such\nas the phoneme (an aspect of (vi)), and the psychological effects of\nlanguage and thought (an aspect of (v)).\nBloomfield (1933) showed a strong interest in historical\nlinguistic change (compare (iv)), distinguishing that sharply (much as\nSaussure did) from synchronic description of language structure ((ii)\nagain) and language use (compare (iii)), arguing that the study of\n(iv) presupposed (vi).\nBloomfield famously eschewed all dualistic mentalistic approaches\nto the study of language, but since he rejected them on materialist\nontological grounds, his rejection of mentalism was not clearly a\nrejection of (vi) or (vii): his attempt to cast linguistics in terms\nof stimulus-response psychology indicates that he was sympathetic to\nthe Weissian psychology of his time and accepted that linguistics\nmight have psychological subject matter.\nZellig Harris, on the other hand, showed little interest in the\npsychology of language, concentrating on mathematical techniques for\ntackling (ii).\n\n\nMost saliently of all, Harris\u2019s student Chomsky reacted strongly\nagainst indifference toward the mind, and insisted that the principal\nsubject matter of linguistics was, and had to be, a narrow\npsychological version of (i), and an individual, non-social, and\ninternalized conception of (ii).\n\nIn the course of advancing his view, Chomsky introduced a number of\nnovel pairs of terms into the linguistics literature: competence vs.\nperformance (Chomsky 1965); \u2018I-language\u2019 vs.\n\u2018E-language\u2019 (Chomsky 1986); the faculty of language in\nthe narrow sense vs. the and faculty of language in the broad sense\n(the \u2018FLN\u2019 and \u2018FLB\u2019 of Hauser et al. 2002).\nBecause Chomsky\u2019s terminological innovations have been adopted\nso widely in linguistics, the focus of sections 2.1\u20132.3 will be\nto examine the use of these expressions as they were introduced into\nthe linguistics literature and consider their relation to\n(i)\u2013(vii).\n",
