    "main_text": "Alternative accounts || Descriptor revision\n8.4 Bayesian models\n\nThe AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are\nbased on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is\nbelieved or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs\ncan be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or\nless easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does\nnot admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,\nusually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all\ndegrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.\nDichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of\nbelief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a\nreasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the\nprobabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are\nclosely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;\nMakinson 1965).\n\nHowever, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing\nwith the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a\ncondition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision\ntheory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of\nprobabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in\nthis limiting case (Makinson 2011). \n",
