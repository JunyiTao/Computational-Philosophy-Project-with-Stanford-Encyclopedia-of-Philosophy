    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || Domain-Specific Identities and Reductions\n2.2 Domain-Specific Identities and Reductions\n\nDavid Lewis (1969) argues that the inconsistency between the identity\ntheorist\u2019s thesis and multiple realizability evaporates when we\nnotice a tacit relativity of the former to contexts. A common sense\nexample illustrates his point. The following three claims appear\nlogically inconsistent:\n\n(1)\n There is only one winning lottery number.\n(2) \n The winning lottery number is 03.\n(3) \n The winning lottery number is 61.\n\n\nThese three similar claims likewise seem inconsistent:\n\n(1\u2032)\n (the identity theorist\u2019s thesis) There is only one\nphysical-chemical realization of pain.\n(2\u2032) \n The physical-chemical realization of pain is C-fiber firing.\n(3\u2032) \n The physical-chemical realization of pain is \u2026 (something\nelse entirely).\n\n\n(2\u2032) and (3\u2032) reflect the multiple realizability\ncontention. But there is no mystery in how to reconcile (1)\u2013(3).\nAppend \u201cper week\u201d to (1), \u201cthis week\u201d to (2),\nand \u201clast week\u201d to (3). Similarly, append \u201cper\nnervous system-type\u201d to (1\u2032), \u201cin human nervous\nsystems\u201d to (2\u2032), and \u201cin mollusk nervous\nsystems\u201d to (3\u2032). Inconsistencies evaporate. Lewis\u2019s\npoint is that identity claims are always specific to a domain. One\nmight wonder whether Lewis\u2019s point generalizes to capture the\nscience fiction examples Putnam hinted at in passing (see\n \u00a71.2\n above). Lewis was certainly aware of Putnam\u2019s (1967)\nargument\u2019s reach (Lewis offers this argument as part of a review\nof the book in which Putnam\u2019s piece first appeared). So we can\nassume Lewis thought domain-specific reductions generalize to\nthese metaphysically possible cases as well. (See Lewis\u2019s own\nelaboration of this argument in his 1983.)\n\nMany reductionist philosophers subsequently elaborated on\nLewis\u2019s point with the help of scientific examples. Patricia\nChurchland (1986: Chapter 7), Clifford Hooker (1981), Berent En\u00e7\n(1983), and other philosophers of science have described historical\nintertheoretic reductions where a given reduced concept is multiply\nrealized at the reducing level. A common example is the concept of\ntemperature from classical equilibrium thermodynamics. Temperature in\na gas is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy. Temperature in a\nsolid, however, is identical to mean maximal molecular kinetic energy,\nsince the molecules of a solid are bound in lattice structures and\nhence restricted to a range of vibratory motions. Temperature in a\nplasma is something else entirely, since the molecular constituents of\na plasma have been ripped apart. Even a vacuum can have a\n(\u201cblackbody\u201d) temperature, though it contains no molecular\nconstituents. \u201cTemperature\u201d of classical thermodynamics is\nthus multiply realized microphysically in a variety of distinct\nphysical states. Yet this is a \u201ctextbook\u201d intertheoretic\nreduction in the history of science. It is just that the reduction,\nand the subsequent ontological identifications across theories, are\nspecific to the domain of physical state.\n\nLewis\u2019s original response also underlies Jaegwon Kim\u2019s\n(1989, 1992) appeals to structure-specific \u201clocal\nreductions\u201d. Kim agrees that multiple realizability rules out a\ngeneral reduction of (structure-independent) psychology to some\nphysical science. But it permits, and even sanctions, a local\nreduction of psychology to a theory of the physical mechanisms of\ngiven structure-types. (Kim admits that the relevant structure-types\nhere will probably be narrower than biological species.) Local\nreductions involve \u201cstructure-specific bridge laws\u201d where\nthe mental-physical biconditional occurs as the consequent of a\nconditional whose antecedent denotes a specific structure-type (e.g.,\n\u201cif X is a member of structure type S, then\nX is in mental state M if and only if X is in\nphysical state P\u201d). Conditionals whose antecedents denote\ndifferent structure types will typically have biconditionals as\nconsequents whose mental term-constituents are co-referential but\nwhose physical term-constituents denote different physical events.\nMultiple realizability forces this much revision to the bridge laws of\nclassical reductionism. But according to Kim, domain-specific local\nreductions are the rule rather than the exception in science\ngenerally, and are sufficient for any reasonable scientific or\nphilosophical purpose.\n",
