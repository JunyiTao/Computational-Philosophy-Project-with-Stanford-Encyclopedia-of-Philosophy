    "main_text": "Types of Events || Actions and Bodily Movements\n2.3 Actions and Bodily Movements\n\nPrima facie, actions are naturally categorized as a subclass\nof events, namely, animate events. Like all events, actions are said\nto occur or take place, not to exist, and their relation to time and\nspace is event-like as well: they have relatively clear beginnings and\nendings but unclear spatial boundaries, they appear to tolerate\nco-location, and they cannot be said to move from one place to another\nor to endure from one time to another, but rather extend in space and\ntime by having spatial as well as temporal parts (Thomson 1977).\nActions and events appear to be on a par in causal explanations, too:\nactions can be causes of which events are effects (Davidson 1963,\n1967b). Some authors, however, prefer to draw a distinction here and\nto treat actions as relations between agents and events,\nnamely as instances of the relation \u2018bringing about\u2019 (von\nWright 1963; Chisholm 1964; Bach 1980; Bishop 1983; Segerberg 1989),\nor perhaps the relation \u2018seeing to it that\u2019 (Belnap and\nPerloff 1988; Tuomela and Sandu 1994; Horty 2001). On such views,\nactions are not individuals unless relations are themselves construed\nas tropes.\n\nWhether or not actions are treated as events, one might be tempted to\ndistinguish between actions proper (such as Anita\u2019s\nraising of her arm) and bodily movements (such as the rising\nof Anita\u2019s arm), or between intentional actions\n(Anita\u2019s walk) and unintentional ones (Anita\u2019s\nfall). For some authors, this is necessary in order to explain\nimportant facts of human behavior (Montmarquet 1978; Hornsby 1980a,b;\nSearle 1983; Brand 1984; Mele 1997). It has been argued, for example,\nthat the relationship between an action and the corresponding bodily\nmovement is not one of identity but, rather, an asymmetric relation of\ngeneration (Goldman 1970), or of mereological inclusion (Thomson\n1977), or of physical constitution (Evnine 2016), or of embodiment\n(Fine 2022). Or perhaps the relationship is more complex: all actions\nwould be sequences of the form volition-cause-bodily movement (Moore\n1993), or structured events that begin in the brain and end with the\nbody\u2019s moving (Smith 2021). However, it has also been argued\nthat such distinctions do not pertain to metaphysics but rather to the\nconceptual apparatus by means of which we describe the realm of things\nthat happen. On this view, an arm raising is just an arm\u2019s\nrising under a mentalistic description (Anscombe 1957, 1979; Davidson\n1971; Sher 1973).\n",
