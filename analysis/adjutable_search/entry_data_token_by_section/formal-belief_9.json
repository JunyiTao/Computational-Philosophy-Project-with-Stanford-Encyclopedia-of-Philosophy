    "main_text": "Full and Partial Belief || Bridge Theories\n4.2 Bridge Theories\n\nAnyone who allows for the existence of both full and partial belief\ninherits a thorny problem: how are full beliefs related to partial\nbeliefs? That seemingly innocent question leads to a treacherous\nsearch for  bridge principles connecting a rational\nagent\u2019s partial beliefs with her full beliefs. Theorists engaged\nin the search for bridge principles usually take for granted some set\nof rationality principles governing full belief and its revision, e.g.\nAGM theory, or a rival system of non-monotonic reasoning. Theorists\nusually also take for granted that partial belief ought to be\nrepresentable by probability functions obeying some flavor of Bayesian\nrationality. The challenge is to propose additional rationality\npostulates governing how a rational agent\u2019s partial beliefs\ncohere with her full beliefs. In this section, we will for the most\npart accept received wisdom and assume that orthodox Bayesianism is\nthe correct model of partial belief and its updating. We will be more\nopen-minded about the modeling of full belief and its rational\nrevision. \n\nIn this section, we will once again take propositions over the set\n\\(W\\) to be the objects of belief. As before, the reader is invited to\nthink of \\(W\\) as a set of coarse-grained, mutually exclusive,\npossible ways the actual world might be. We write \\(\\Bel\\) to denote\nthe set of  propositions that the agent believes and use\n\\(\\Bel(A)\\) as shorthand for \\(A\\in \\Bel\\). We will also require some\nnotation for qualitative propositional belief change. For all\n\\(E\\subseteq W\\), write \\(\\Bel_E\\) for the set of propositions the\nagent would believe upon learning \\(E\\) and no stronger proposition.\nWe will also write \\(\\Bel(A|E)\\) as shorthand for \\(A\\in \\Bel_E.\\) By\nconvention, \\(\\Bel= \\Bel_W.\\) If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a set of propositions,\nwe let \\(\\Bel_{\\bf F}\\) be the set \\(\\{ \\Bel_E : E \\in {\\bf F} \\}.\\)\nThe set \\(\\Bel_{\\bf F}\\) represents an agent\u2019s  dispositions\n to update her qualitative beliefs given information from \\({\\bf\nF}\\). \n\nThe following normative constraint on the set of full beliefs \\(\\Bel\\)\nplays a large role in what follows.\n\nDeductive Cogency. The belief set \\(\\Bel\\) is\nconsistent and \\(B\\in\\Bel\\) if and only if \\(\\cap \\Bel \\subseteq B.\\)\n\n\nIn other words, deductive cogency means that there is a single,\nnon-empty proposition, \\(\\cap \\Bel\\), which is the logically strongest\nproposition that the agent believes, entailing all her other\nbeliefs.\n\nAll of the rationality norms that we have seen for updating\nqualitative beliefs have propositional analogues. The following are\npropositional analogues for the AGM principles from Section 2.2.1.\n\n\n(Closure)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\Bel_E=\\Cn(\\Bel_E)\\); \n\n(Success)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(E\\in\\Bel_E\\); \n\n(Inclusion)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\Bel_E \\subseteq \\Cn(\\Bel \\cup \\{E\\}) \\); \n\n(Preservation)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf \\(\\neg E \\not\\in \\Cn(\\Bel) \\), then \\( \\Bel \\subseteq \\Bel_E\n\\); \n\n(Consistency)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\Bel_E\\) is consistent iff \\( E\\neq \\varnothing\\); \n\n(Extensionality)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf \\(E\\equiv F\\), then \\(\\Bel_E=\\Bel_F\\).  \n\n(Conjunctive Inclusion)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\Bel_{E\\cap F} \\subseteq \\Cn(\\Bel_{E} \\cup \\{F\\})\\); \n\n\n(Conjunctive Preservation)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf \\(\\neg F \\notin \\Cn(\\Bel_E)\\) then, \\(\\Cn(\\Bel_E \\cup \\{F\\})\n\\subseteq \\Bel_{E\\cap F}.\\) \n\n\nSupposing that for all \\(E\\subseteq W\\), \\(\\Bel_E\\) satisfies\ndeductive cogency, the first six postulates reduce to the following\nthree.\n\n\n(Success)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\cap \\Bel_E \\subseteq E\\); \n\n(Inclusion)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\cap \\Bel \\cap E \\subseteq \\cap \\Bel_{E};\\) \n\n(Preservation)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf \\(\\cap \\Bel \\nsubseteq \\neg E,\\) then \\(\\cap \\Bel_{E}\n\\subseteq \\cap \\Bel \\cap E.\\) \n\n Together, Inclusion and Preservation say that whenever information \\(E\\) is consistent with  current belief \\(\\cap \\Bel,\\) \\[\\cap \\Bel_E = \\cap \\Bel \\cap E.\\] If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a collection of propositions and for all \\(E\\in {\\bf F},\\) the belief sets \\(\\Bel,\\Bel_E\\) satisfy the AGM principles, we say that \\(\\Bel_{\\bf F},\\) the agent\u2019s disposition to update her qualitative beliefs given information from \\({\\bf F}\\), satsifies the basic AGM principles.\n\nWe will use \\(\\Pr(\\cdot)\\) to denote the probability function\nrepresenting the agent\u2019s partial beliefs. Of course,\n\\(\\Pr(\\cdot)\\) is defined on a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of subsets of \\(W\\).\nIn the usual case, when \\(W\\) is finite, we can take the powerset\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(W)\\) to be the relevant \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. To update\npartial belief, we adopt the standard probabilistic modeling. For\n\\(E\\subseteq W\\) such that \\(\\Pr(E)>0,\\) \\(\\Pr(\\cdot|E)\\) is the\npartial belief function resulting from learning \\(E.\\) We will\nsometimes use \\(\\Pr_E\\) as a shorthand for \\(\\Pr(\\cdot|E)\\). Almost\nalways, partial belief is updated via standard conditioning. As\nbefore, \\({\\bf A}^{\\Pr}\\) is the set of propositions with positive\nprobability according to \\(\\Pr\\).\n4.2.1 Belief as Extremal Probability\n\nThe first bridge principle that suggests itself is that full belief is\njust the maximum degree of partial belief. Expressed\nprobabilistically, it says that at all times a rational agent\u2019s\nbeliefs and partial beliefs can be represented by a pair \\(\\langle\n\\Bel,p \\rangle\\) satisfying:\n\nExtremal Probability. \\( A\\in\\Bel\\) if and only if\n\\(\\Pr(A)=1.\\) \n\nRoorda (1995) calls this the received view of how full and\npartial belief ought to interact. G\u00e4rdenfors (1986) is a\nrepresentative of this view, as are van Fraasen (1995) and\nArl\u00f3-Costa (1999), although the latter two accept a slightly\nnon-standard probabilistic modeling for partial belief. For fans of\ndeductive cogency, the following observations ought to count in favor\nof the received view.\n\nTheorem. If \\(\\langle \\Bel, p \\rangle\\) satisfy\nextremal probability, then \\(\\Bel\\) is deductively cogent. \nG\u00e4rdenfors (1986) proves the following.\n\n\nTheorem. Suppose that\\(\\langle \\Bel_E, \\Pr_E\n\\rangle\\) satisfy extremal probability for all \\(E\\in {\\bf A}^{\\Pr}.\\)\nThen \\(\\Bel_{{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}}\\) satisfies the AGM postulates. \n\nIn other words: if an agent\u2019s partial beliefs validate the\nprobability axioms, she updates by Bayesian conditioning and fully\nbelieves all and only those propositions with extremal probability,\nher qualitative update behavior will satisfy all the AGM postulates\n(at least whenever Bayesian conditioning is defined). Readers who take\nthe AGM revision postulates to be a sine qua non of rational\nbelief update will take this to be good news for the received view.\n\n\nRoorda (1995) makes three criticisms of the received view. Consider\nthe following three propositions.\n\nMillard Fillmore was the 13th President of the United States;\nMillard Fillmore was a U.S. President;\nMillard Fillmore either was or was not a U.S. President. \n\n\nOf course, I am not as confident that Fillmore was the 13th president\nas I am in the truth of the tautology expressed in (3). Yet there does\nnot seem to be anything wrong with saying that I fully believe each of\n(1), (2) and (3). However, if extremal probability is right, it is\nirrational to fully believe each of (1), (2) and (3) and not assign\nthem all the same degree of belief.\n\nRoorda\u2019s second objection appeals to the standard connection\nbetween degrees of belief and practical decision making. Suppose I\nfully believe (1). According to the standard interpretation of degrees\nof belief in terms of betting quotients, I ought to accept a bet that\npays out a dollar if (1) is true, and costs me a million dollars if\n(1) is false. In fact, if I truly assign unit probability to (1), I\nought to accept nearly any stakes whatsoever that guarantee some\npositive payout if (1) is true. Yet it seems perfectly rational to\nfully believe (1) and refrain from accepting such a bet. If we accept\nBayesian decision theory, extremal probability seems to commit me to\nall sorts of weird and seemingly irrational betting behavior.\n\nRoorda\u2019s final challenge to extremal probability appeals to\ncorrigibility, according to which it is reasonable to believe\nthat at least some of my beliefs may need to be abandoned in light of\nnew information. However, if partial beliefs are updated via Bayesian\nconditioning, I can never cease to believe any of my full beliefs\nsince if \\(\\Pr(A)=1\\) it follows that \\(\\Pr(A|E)=1\\) for all \\(E\\)\nsuch that \\(\\Pr(E)>0\\). If we believe in Bayesian conditioning,\nextremal probability seems to entail that I cannot revise any of my\nfull beliefs in light of new information.\n4.2.2 The Lockean Threshold The natural response to the difficulties with the received\nview is to retreat from full certainty. Perhaps full belief\ncorresponds to partial belief above some  threshold falling\nshort of certainty. Foley (1993) dubbed this view the  Lockean\nthesis, after some apparently similar remarks in Book IV of\nLocke\u2019s (1690/1975)  Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding. So far, the Lockean thesis is actually ambiguous.\nThere may be a single threshold that is rationally mandated for all\nagents and in all circumstances. Alternatively, each agent may have\nher own threshold that she applies in all circumstances\u2013that\nthreshold may characterize how \u201cbold\u201d or\n\u201crisk-seeking\u201d the agent is in forming qualitative\nbeliefs. A yet weaker thesis holds that the threshold may be\ncontextually determined. We distinguish the strong,\ncontext-independent Lockean thesis (SLT) from the weaker,\ncontext-dependent thesis (WLT). The domain of the quantifier may be\ntaken as the set of all belief states \\(\\langle \\Bel,\\Pr \\rangle\\) a\n particular agent may find herself in, or as the set of all\nbelief states whatsoever.\n\n\n(SLT) There is a threshold \\(s\\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1)\\) such that all rational  \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) satisfy \\[\\Bel(A) \\text{ iff } \\Pr(A) \\geq s.\\]\n(WLT) For every rational \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) there is a threshold \\(s\\in(\\frac{1}{2}, 1)\\) such that \\[\\Bel(A) \\text{ iff } \\Pr(A) \\geq s.\\]\n\n\nMost discussions of the Lockean thesis have in mind the strong thesis.\nMore recent work, especially Leitgeb (2017), adopts the weaker thesis.\nThe strong thesis leaves the correct threshold unspecified. Of course,\nfor every \\(s\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1)\\) we can formulate a specific thesis\n\\(\\text{SLT}^s\\) in virtue of which the strong thesis is true. For\nexample, \\(\\text{SLT}^{.51}\\) is a very permissive version of the\nthesis, whereas \\(\\text{SLT}^{.95}\\) and \\(\\text{SLT}^{.99}\\) are more\nstringent. It is also possible to further specify the weak thesis. For\nexample, Leitgeb (2017) believes that the contextually-determined\nthreshold should be equal to the degree of belief assigned to the\nstrongest proposition that is fully believed. In light of deductive\ncogency, that corresponds to the orthographically ungainly\n\\(\\text{WLT}^{\\Pr(\\cap \\Bel)}\\).\n\nThe strong Lockean thesis gives rise to the well-known  Lottery\nparadox, due originally to Kyburg (1961, 1997). The lesson of the\nLottery is that the strong thesis is in tension with deductive\ncogency. Suppose that \\(s\\) is the universally correct Lockean\nthreshold. Now think of a fair lottery with \\(N\\) tickets, where \\(N\\)\nis chosen large enough that \\(1-(1/N) \\geq s.\\) Since the lottery is\nfair, it seems permissible to fully believe that  some ticket\nis the winner. It also seems reasonable to assign degree of belief\n\\(1/N\\) to each proposition of the form \u2018The \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\)\nticket is the winner.\u2019 According to the Lockean thesis, such an\nagent ought to fully believe that the first ticket is a loser, the\nsecond ticket is a loser, the third is a loser, etc. Since cogency\nrequires belief to be closed under conjunction, she ought to believe\nthat all the tickets are losers. But now she violates cogency by\nbelieving both that every ticket is a loser and that some ticket is a\nwinner. Since \\(s\\) was arbitrary, we have shown that no matter how\nhigh we set the threshold, there is some Lottery for which an agent\nmust either violate the Lockean thesis or violate deductive cogency.\nAccording to Kyburg, what the paradox teaches is that we should give\nup on deductive cogency: full belief should not necessarily be closed\nunder conjunction. Many others take the lesson of the Lottery to be\nthat the strong Lockean thesis is untenable.\n\nSeveral authors (Pollock (1995), Ryan (1996), Douven (2002)) attempt\nto revise the strong Lockean thesis by placing restrictions on when a\nhigh degree of belief warrants full belief. Broadly speaking, they\npropose that a high degree of belief is sufficient to warrant full\nbelief unless some defeating condition holds. For example, Douven\n(2002) says that it is sufficient except when the proposition is a\nmember of a  probabilistically self-undermining set. A set\n\\({\\bf S}\\) is probabilistically self-undermining iff for all \\(A \\in\n{\\bf S}, \\Pr(A)>s\\) and \\(\\Pr(A | B)\\leq s,\\) where \\(B=\\cap( {\\bf S}\n\\setminus \\{ A \\}).\\) It is clear that this proposal would prohibit\nfull belief that a particular lottery ticket will lose.\n\nAll proposals of this kind are vitiated by the following sort of\nexample due to Korb (1992). Let \\(A\\) be any proposition with a degree\nof belief above threshold but short of certainty. Let \\(L_i\\) be the\nproposition that the \\(i^{th}\\) lottery ticket (of a large lottery\nwith \\(N\\) tickets) will lose. Consider the set \\({\\bf S} = \\{ \\neg A\n\\cup L_i | 1 \\leq i \\leq N \\}.\\) Each member of \\({\\bf S}\\) is above\nthreshold, since \\(L_i\\) is above threshold. Furthermore, the set\n\\({\\bf S} \\cup \\{ A\\}\\) meets Douven\u2019s (as well as\nPollock\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s) defeating conditions. Therefore,\nthese proposals prohibit full belief in any proposition with degree of\nbelief short of certainty. Douven and Williamson (2006) generalize\nthis sort of example to trivialize an entire class of similar formal\nproposals.\n\nBuchak (2014) argues that what partial beliefs count as full beliefs\ncannot merely be a matter of the degree of partial belief, but must\nalso depend on the type of evidence it is based on. According to\nBuchak, this means there can be no merely formal answer to the\nquestion: what conditions on partial belief are necessary and\nsufficient for full belief? The following example, of a type going\nback to Thomson (1986), illustrates the point. Your parked car was hit\nby a bus in the middle of the night. The bus could belong either to\nthe blue bus company or the red bus company. Consider the following\ntwo scenarios.\n\n(1) You know that the blue company operates 90%\nof the buses in the area, and the red bus company operates only 10%.\nYou have degree of belief 0.9 that a blue bus is to blame.\n(2) The red and blue companies operate an equal\nnumber of buses. A 90% reliable eyewitness testifies that a blue bus\nhit your car. You have degree of belief 0.9 that a blue bus is to\nblame. \n\n\nBuchak (2014) argues that it is rational to have full belief that a\nblue bus is to blame in the first scenario, but not in the second. You\nhave only statistical evidence in the first scenario, whereas in the\nsecond, a causal chain of events connects your belief to the accident\n(see also Thomson (1986), Nelkin (2000) and Schauer (2003)). These\nintuitions, Buchak observes, are reflected in our legal practice:\npurely statistical evidence is not sufficient to convict. If you find\nBuchak\u2019s point convincing, you will be unsatisfied with most of\nthe proposed accounts for how full and partial belief ought to\ncorrespond (see Staffel (2016)). \n\nDespite difficulties with buses and lotteries, the dynamics of\nqualitative belief under the strong thesis are independently\ninteresting to investigate. For example, van Eijk and Renne (2014, Other Internet Resources)\naxiomatize the logic of belief for a Lockean with threshold\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Makinson and Hawthorne (2015) investigate which\nprinciples of non-monotonic logic are validated by Lockean agents.\nBefore turning to proposed solutions to the Lottery paradox, we make\nsome observations about qualitative Lockean revision, inspired largely\nby Shear and Fitelson (2018).\n\nIt is a theorem of the probability calculus that \\(\\Pr(H|E) \\leq\n\\Pr(E\\rightarrow H)\\). So if \\(H\\) is assigned a high degree of belief\ngiven \\(E\\), the material conditional \\(E\\rightarrow H\\) must have\nbeen assigned a degree of belief at least as high ex ante. It\nis easy to see that as a probabilistic analogue of the principle of\nConditionalization from non-monotonic logic or, equivalently, the AGM\nInclusion principle. That observation has the following consequence:\nany belief that the Lockean comes to have after conditioning, she\ncould have arrived at by adding the evidence to her prior beliefs and\nclosing under logical consequence. Therefore Lockean updating\nsatisfies the AGM principle of Inclusion. Furthermore, it follows\nimmediately from definitions that Lockean update satisfies Success and\nExtensionality.\n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(s\\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1)\\). For\nall \\(E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}\\), let \\(\\Bel_E = \\{ A : \\Pr(A|E) \\geq s\\}\\).\nThen, \\(\\Bel_{{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}}\\) satisfies Inclusion, Success and\nExtensionality. \n\nIn Section 2.2, we argued that Inclusion and Preservation capture the\nspirit of AGM revision. If Lockean revision also satsified\nPreservation, we would have a clean sweep of the AGM principles, with\nthe exception of deductive cogency. However, that cannot hold in\ngeneral. It is possible to construct examples where \\(\\Pr(\\neg E) \\lt\ns,\\) \\(\\Pr(H)\\geq s\\) and yet \\(\\Pr(H|E) \\lt s\\). For Lockean agents\nthis means that it is possible to lose a belief, even when revising on\na proposition that is not disbelieved.\n \nRecall the example of Alice, Bob and the Ford from Section\n2.1.1. Let \\(W=\\{a, b, c\\}\\) corresponding to the worlds in which\nAlice owns the Ford, Bob own the Ford and no one in the office owns\nthe Ford.  Suppose the probability function \\[\\Pr(a) =\\frac{6}{10},\n\\Pr(b)=\\frac{3}{10} \\text{ and } \\Pr(c)=\\frac{1}{10}\\] captures my\npartial beliefs. For Lockean thresholds in the interval \\((.75,.9]\\),\nmy full beliefs are exhausted by \\(\\Bel=\\{ \\{a,b\\}, W\\}.\\) Now suppose\nI were to learn that Alice does not own the Ford. That is consistent\nwith all beliefs in \\(\\Bel\\), but since \\(\\Pr(\\{a,b\\} | \\{b,c\\}) =\n\\frac{3}{4}\\) it follows by the Lockean thesis that \\(\\{a,b\\} \\notin\n\\Bel_{\\{b,c\\}}\\). So Lockeanism does not in general validate\nPreservation. The good news, at least for those sympathetic to\nPollock\u2019s critique of non-monotonic logic, is that the Lockean\nthesis allows for undercutting defeat of previous beliefs.\n\nHowever, Shear and Fitelson (2018) also have some good news for fans\nof AGM and the Lockean thesis. Two quantities are in the golden\nratio \\(\\phi\\) if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their\nsum to the larger of the two quantities, i.e. for \\(a>b>0\\), if\n\\(\\frac{a+b}{a} = \\frac{a}{b}\\) then \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\phi\\). The\ngolden ratio is an irrational number approximately equal to \\(1.618.\\)\nIts inverse \\(\\phi^{-1}\\) is approximately \\(.618.\\) Shear and\nFitelson prove the following intriguing result. \n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(s\\in (\\frac{1}{2},\n\\phi^{-1}]\\). For all \\(E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}\\), let \\(\\Bel_E = \\{ A :\n\\Pr(A|E) \\geq s\\}.\\) Let \\({\\bf D}=\\{E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr} : \\Bel_E \\text{\nis deductively cogent} \\}.\\) Then \\(\\Bel_{{\\bf D}}\\) satisfies the six\nbasic AGM postulates. \n\nThat shows that for relatively low thresholds, Lockean updating\nsatsifies all the AGM postulates\u2013at least when we restrict to\ndeductively cogent belief sets. For an explanation of why the golden\nratio arises in this context see Section 6.2 in Genin (2019).\n4.2.3 The Stability Theory of Belief\n\nFor many, sacrificing deductive cogency is simply too high a price to\npay for a bridge principle, even one so simple and intuitive as the\nstrong Lockean thesis. That occassions a search for bridge principles\nthat can be reconciled with deductive cogency. One proposal, due to\nLeitgeb (2013, 2014, 2017) and Arl\u00f3-Costa (2012), holds that\nrational full belief corresponds to a stably high degree of belief,\ni.e. a degree of belief that remains high even after conditioning on\nnew information. Leitgeb calls this view the  Humean thesis,\ndue to Hume\u2019s conception of belief as an idea of superior\nvivacity, but also of superior steadiness. See Loeb (2002, 2010) for a\ndetailed development of the stability theme in Hume\u2019s conception\nof belief. Leitgeb (2017) formalizes Hume\u2019s definition,\narticulating the following version of the thesis:\n\n(HT) For all rational pairs  \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) there is \\(s\\geq 1/2\\) such that \\[\\Bel(A) \\text{ iff } \\neg B \\notin \\Bel \\text{ implies } \\Pr(A|B)> s.\\]\n\n\nIn other words: every full belief must have stably high conditional\ndegree of belief, at least when conditioning on propositions which are\nnot currently disbelieved. Since full belief occurs on both sides of\nthe biconditional, it is evident that this is not a proposed \nreduction of full belief to partial belief, but rather a\nconstraint that every rational agent must satisfy. The Humean thesis\nleaves the precise threshold \\(s\\) unspecified. Of course, for every\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} \\lt s \\lt 1,\\) we can formulate a specific thesis\n\\(\\text{HT}^s\\) in virtue of which the thesis is true. For example,\n\\(\\text{HT}^{.5}\\) requires that every fully believed proposition\nremains more likely than its negation when conditioning on\npropositions not currently disbelieved.\n\nSome form of stability is widely considered to be a necessary\ncondition for  knowledge. Socrates propounds such a view in\nthe  Meno. Paxson Jr. and Lehrer (1969) champion such a view\nin the epistemology literature post-Gettier (1963). However, stability\nis not usually mooted as a condition of  belief. Raidl and\nSkovgaard-Olsen (2017) claim that Leitgeb\u2019s stability condition\nis more appropriate in an analysis of knowledge and too stringent a\ncondition on belief. A defender of the Humean thesis might say that\nevery  rational belief is possibly an instance of knowledge.\nSince knowledge is necessarily stable, unstable beliefs are  ipso\nfacto not known.\n\nLeitgeb demonstrates the following relationships between the Humean\nthesis, deductive cogency and the weak Lockean thesis.\n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\)\nsatsify \\(\\text{HT}\\) and \\(\\varnothing \\notin \\Bel.\\) Then, \\(\\Bel\\)\nis deductively cogent and \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr\\rangle\\) satisfy\n\\(\\text{WLT}^{\\Pr(\\cap \\Bel)}.\\) \n\nSo if an agent satisfies the Humean thesis and does not\n\u201cfully\u201d believe the contradictory proposition, her\nqualitative beliefs are deductively cogent and furthermore, she\nsatisfies the weak Lockean thesis, where the threshold is set by the\ndegree of belief assigned to \\(\\cap\\Bel,\\) the logically strongest\nproposition she believes. Leitgeb also proves the following partial\nconverse.\n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(\\Bel\\) is deductively cogent\nand \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) satisfy \\(\\text{WLT}^{\\Pr(\\cap\n\\Bel)}\\). Then, \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) satsify\n\\(\\text{HT}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(\\varnothing \\notin \\Bel\\).\n\nTogether, these two theorems say that the Humean thesis (with\nthreshold 1/2) is equivalent to deductive cogency and the weak Lockean\nthesis (with threshold \\(\\Pr(\\cap\\Bel)\\)). Since it is always possible\nto satisfy HT\\(^\\frac{1}{2}\\), Leitgeb gives us an ingenious way to\nreconcile deductive cogency with a version of the Lockean thesis.\n\nRecall the example of the lottery. Let \\(W=\\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_N\n\\},\\) where \\(w_i\\) is the world in which the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) ticket\nis the winner. No matter how many tickets are in the lottery, a Humean\nagent cannot believe any ticket will lose. Suppose for a contradiction\nthat she believes \\(W\\setminus \\{w_1\\}\\), the proposition that the\nfirst ticket will lose. Now suppose she learns \\(\\{w_1, w_2\\}\\), that\nall but the first and second ticket will lose. This is compatible with\nher initial belief, but her updated degree of belief that the first\nticket will lose must be \\(1/2\\). That contradicts the Humean thesis.\nSo she cannot believe that any ticket will lose. In this Lottery\nsituation the agent cannot fully believe any non-trivial proposition.\nThis example also shows how sensitive the Humean proposal is to the\nfine-graining of possibilities. If we coarsen \\(W\\) into the set of\npossibilities \\(W=\\{w_1, w_2\\}\\), where \\(w_1\\) is the world in which\nthe first ticket is the winner and \\(w_2\\) is \u201cthe\u201d world\nin which some other ticket is the winner, the agent can believe that\nthe first ticket will lose without running afoul of the Humean thesis.\n\n\nIf Buchak (2014) is right, no agent should have beliefs in lottery\npropositions\u2013these beliefs would necessarily be formed on the\nbasis of purely statistical evidence. Kelly and Lin (2019) give\nanother scenario in which Humean agents seem radically skeptical, but\nin situations which are evidentially unproblematic. Suppose the\nluckless Job goes in for a physical. On the basis of a thorough\nexamination, the doctor forms the following dire opinion of his\nhealth: her degree of belief that Job will survive exactly \\(n\\)\nmonths is \\(\\frac{1}{2^n}.\\) Therefore, her degree of belief that Job\nwill not survive the year is \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots +\n\\frac{1}{2^{12}} > .999.\\) Shockingly, the Humean thesis prevents the\ndoctor from forming  any non-trivial beliefs. Let \\(\\leq n\\)\nbe the proposition that Job survives at most \\(n\\) months and let\n\\(\\geq n\\) be the proposition that he survives at least \\(n\\) months.\nLet \\(B\\) be the strongest proposition that the doctor believes.\nSuppose for a contradiction that \\(B\\) entails some least upper bound\nfor the number of Job\u2019s remaining months, i.e for some \\(n\\),\n\\(B\\) entails \\(\\leq n\\) and does not entail \\(\\leq n^\\prime \\) for\nany \\(n^\\prime \\lt n\\). By construction, \\(\\Pr(B| \\geq n) =\n\\frac{\\Pr(n)}{\\Pr(\\geq n)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) for all \\(n\\). But since\n\\(\\geq n\\) is compatible with \\(B\\), the Humean thesis requires that\n\\(\\Pr(B| \\geq n) > \\frac{1}{2}.\\) Contradiction. \n\nThe example of the doctor suggests that the price of Humeanism is a\nrather extreme form of skepticism: in many situations a Humean agent\nwill have no non-trivial full beliefs at all. That criticism is\ndeveloped extensively in Rott (2017) and Douven and Rott (2018). The\ndoctor also illustrates how the Humean proposal allows arbitrarily\nsmall perturbations of partial beliefs to be reflected as huge\ndifferences in full beliefs. Suppose the doctor is slightly more\nconfident that Job will not survive a month, i.e. her survival\nprobabilities decrease as \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon, \\frac{1}{4},\n\\frac{1}{8} - \\epsilon, \\frac{1}{16}, \\frac{1}{32}, \\ldots.\\) Now the\ndoctor can believe that Job will be dead in two months without running\nafoul of the Humean thesis.\n\nSo far we have inquired only into the synchronic content of the Humean\nproposal. What sort principles of qualitative belief update does it\nunderwrite? Leitgeb demonstrates an intimate relationship between the\nAGM revision principles and the Humean thesis: every agent that\nsatisfies the AGM principles, as well as a weak version of the Lockean\nthesis, must also satisfy the Humean thesis. So if you think that AGM\ntheory is the correct theory of rational qualitative belief update\n(and you believe that a high degree of partial belief is a \nnecessary condition of full belief) you must also accept the\nHumean thesis. More precisely, Leitgeb proves the following:\n\nTheorem. Suppose that \\(\\Bel_{{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}}\\)\nsatisfies all AGM postulates and for all \\(E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr},\\) \\(A\\in\n\\Bel_E\\) only if \\(\\Pr(A|E)>r.\\) Then, for all \\(E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr},\\)\n\\(\\langle \\Bel_E, \\Pr_E \\rangle\\) satisfy \\(\\text{HT}^r\\). \n\nSo any agent that violates the Humean thesis must either fail to\nsatisfy the AGM postulates, or the high-probability requirement. Note\nthat the converse is not true: it is not the case that that if all\npairs \\(\\langle \\Bel_E, \\Pr_E \\rangle\\) satisfy the Humean thesis,\nthen \\(\\Bel_{{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}}\\) must satisfy the AGM postulates. To\nprove this, suppose that \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle\\) satisfy the\nHumean thesis and \\(\\cap \\Bel \\subset E\\) for some \\(E\\in{\\bf\nA}^{\\Pr}.\\) If we let \\(\\Bel_E = \\{E\\}\\), then \\(\\langle \\Bel_E, \\Pr_E\n\\rangle\\) satisfy the Humean thesis. However, such an agent patently\nviolates rational and even Cautious Monotony. For a somewhat more\ndetailed treatment of the relationship between AGM theory and the\nHumean thesis, see Section 6.3 in Genin (2019). For a full treatment,\nsee Leitgeb (2017).\n4.2.4 The Tracking Theory of Belief\n\nLin and Kelly (2012) propose that qualitative belief update ought to\n track partial belief update. On their picture, partial and\nfull beliefs are maintained and updated by parallel cognitive systems.\nThe first system, governed by the probabilistic norms of Bayesian\ncoherence and conditioning, is precise, slow and cognitively\nexpensive. That system is engaged for important deliberations\nrequiring a lot of precision and occuring without much time pressure,\ne.g. retirement planning. The second, which in some way maintains and\nupdates full beliefs, is quicker and less cognitively burdensome. That\nsystem is engaged in ordinary planning: grocery shopping, or selecting\na restaurant for a department event. (For an objection to the two\nsystems view, see Staffel (2018).) What keeps these two parallel\nsystems in sync with each other?\n Lin and Kelly (2012) study  acceptance rules that specify a mechanism for transitioning gracefully into the qualitative and out of the probabilistic system. An acceptance rule \\(\\alpha\\) maps every partial belief state \\(\\Pr\\) to a unique qualitative belief state \\(\\alpha(\\Pr)\\) with which it coheres. For example, the strong Lockean thesis determines an acceptance rule once we specify a threshold. The Humean thesis, on the other hand, underdetermines an acceptance rule, merely imposing constraints on acceptable pairs \\(\\langle \\Bel, \\Pr \\rangle.\\) An agent\u2019s qualitative updates  track her probabilistic updates iff \\[\\alpha(\\Pr)_E=\\alpha(\\Pr_E),\\] whenever \\(\\Pr(E)>0\\). In other words: acceptance followed by qualitative revision yields the same belief state as probabilistic revision followed by acceptance.\n\nHere is a way to understand the tracking requirement. Suppose that,\nalthough an agent maintains a latent probabilistic belief state, most\nof her cognitive life is spent reasoning with and updating qualitative\nbeliefs. A typical day will go by without having to engage the\nprobabilistic system at all. Suppose Monday is a typical day. Let\n\\(\\langle \\alpha(\\Pr), \\Pr \\rangle\\) be the belief state she woke up\nwith on Monday: her full and partial beliefs are in harmony. Let \\(E\\)\nbe the total information she acquired since waking up. Since\nqualitative beliefs are updated on the fly, she goes to sleep with the\nqualitative belief state \\(\\alpha(\\Pr)_E\\). Overnight, her\nprobabilistic system does the difficult work of Bayesian conditioning\nand computes the partial belief state \\(\\Pr_E\\), just in case she runs\ninto any sophisticated decision problems on Tuesday. Before waking,\nshe transitions out of her probabilistic system \\(\\Pr_E\\) and into the\nqualitative belief state \\(\\alpha(\\Pr_E)\\). If she fails the tracking\nrequirement, she may wake up on Tuesday morning with a qualitative\nbelief state that is drastically different from the one she had went\nto sleep with on Monday night. If she tracks, then she will notice no\ndifference at all. For such an agent, no mechanism (other than memory)\nis required to bring her full and partial beliefs back into harmony on\nTuesday morning. Supposing that we  enter the probabilistic\nsystem by conditioning our previous partial belief state \\(\\Pr\\) on\nall new information \\(E\\), and  exit by accepting\n\\(\\alpha(\\Pr_E),\\) tracking ensures that transitioning in and out of\nthe probabilistic system does not induce any drastic changes in\nqualitative beliefs. An agent that tracks will notice no difference at\nall. An agent that does not track may find her full and partial\nbeliefs perpetually falling out of sync, requiring many expensive\nacceptance operations to bring them back into harmony. \n\nTracking may be a desirable property, but are there any architectures\nthat exhibit it? Lin and Kelly (2012) answer this question\naffirmitively. Since Bayesian conditioning is taken for granted, Lin\nand Kelly must specify two things: a qualitative revision operation\nand an acceptance rule that jointly track conditioning. We turn now to\nthe details of their proposal. As usual, let \\(W\\) be a set of worlds.\nA  question  \\({\\bf Q}\\) is a partition of \\(W\\) into a\ncountable collection of mutually exhaustive propositions \\(H_1, H_2,\n\\ldots,\\) which are the complete  answers to \\({\\bf Q}.\\) The\npartial belief function \\(\\Pr\\) is defined over the algebra of\npropositions \\({\\bf A}\\) generated by \\({\\bf Q}.\\) Let \\(\\prec\\) be a\nwell-founded, strict partial order over the answers to \\({\\bf Q}\\). (A\nstrict partial order is  well-founded iff every subset of the\norder has a least element.) This is interpreted as a  plausibility\nordering, where \\(H_i \\prec H_j\\) means that \\(H_i\\) is strictly\n more  plausible than \\(H_j\\). Every plausibility order\n\\(\\prec\\) gives rise to a deductively cogent belief state\n\\(\\Bel_\\prec\\) by letting \\(\\neg H_i\\in \\Bel_\\prec\\) iff there is some\n\\(H_j\\) strictly more plausible than \\(H_i\\) and closing under logical\nconsequence. In other words, \\(\\cap \\Bel_\\prec\\) is the disjunction of\nthe minimal elements in the plausibility order. \n First we  specify an acceptance rule. Lin and Kelly propose the  odds threshold rule. The  degree of belief function \\(\\Pr\\) is used to determine a plausibility order by setting \\[H_i \\prec_p H_j \\text{ if and only if } \\frac{\\Pr(H_i)}{\\Pr(H_j)} > t,\\] where \\(t\\) is a constant greater than \\(1\\) and \\(\\Pr(H_i),\\Pr(H_j)>0\\). This determines an acceptance rule by setting \\(\\alpha(\\Pr)= \\Bel_{\\prec_p}.\\) Since the odds threshold rule determines a plausibility order \\(\\prec_p\\) and any plausibility order \\(\\prec\\)  gives rise to a deductively cogent belief state \\(\\Bel_\\prec,\\) the Lottery paradox is avoided. In other words: the bridge principle that any rational \\(\\langle \\Bel,p \\rangle\\)  are related by \\(\\Bel=\\alpha(\\Pr)\\) enures that \\(\\Bel\\) is deductively cogent. Furthermore, the odds threshold rule allows non-trivial qualitative beliefs in situations where the stability theory precludes them. Recall the case of the doctor. Consider the odds threshold \\(2^{10} -1\\). Given this threshold, the hypothesis that Job will survive exactly 1 month is strictly more plausible than the proposition that he will survive at least \\(n\\) months for any \\(n\\geq 10\\). This threshold yields the full belief that Job will survive at most 10 months. However, in the case of the Lottery, the odds threshold rule precludes any non-trivial beliefs. (The content-dependent threshold rule proposed by Kelly and Lin (forthcoming) may allow non-trivial beliefs in the Lottery situation.) See Rott (2017) and  Douven and Rott (2018) for an extensive comparison of the relative likelihood of forming non-trivial qualitative beliefs on the odds-threshold and stability proposals. \n\nIt remains to specify the qualitative revision operation. Lin and\nKelly adopt an operation proposed by Shoham (1987). The plausibility\norder \\(\\prec\\) is updated on evidence \\(E\\) by setting every answer\nincompatible with \\(E\\) to be strictly less plausible than every\nanswer compatible with \\(E,\\) and otherwise leaving the order\nunchanged. Let \\(\\prec_E\\) denote the result of this update operation.\nWe use the updated plausibility order to define a belief revision rule\nby setting \\(\\Bel_E = \\Bel_{\\prec_E}.\\) Then, for all \\(E,F\\subseteq\nW\\), \\(B_E\\) is deductively cogent and satisfies:\n\n\n(Success)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\cap \\Bel_E \\subseteq E\\); \n\n(Inclusion)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(\\cap \\Bel \\cap E \\subseteq \\cap \\Bel_{E};\\) \n\n(Cautious Monotony)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n If \\(\\cap\\Bel\\subseteq E\\) then \\(\\cap \\Bel_E \\subseteq \\cap\n\\Bel.\\) \n\n\nHowever, it does not necessarily satisfy Preservation. To see this\nsuppose that \\({\\bf Q}=\\{H_1, H_2, H_3\\}\\) and \\(H_1 \\prec H_2\\) but\n\\(H_3\\) is not ordered with \\(H_1\\) or \\(H_2\\). Then \\(\\cap \\Bel =\nH_1\\cup H_3.\\) However \\(\\cap\\Bel_{\\neg H_1} = H_2 \\cup H_3\\nsubseteq\n\\cap \\Bel\\) even though \\(\\cap \\Bel \\cap \\neg H_1 \\neq\n\\varnothing.\\)\n\nLin and Kelly prove that Shoham revision and odds-threshold based\nacceptance jointly track conditioning:\n\nTheorem. Let \\(\\prec\\) equal \\(\\prec_p\\) and let\n\\(\\Bel_E = \\Bel_{\\prec_E}\\). Then \\(\\Bel_{\\mathcal{P}(W)}\\) satisfies\ndeductive cogency, Success, Cautious Monotony and Inclusion.\nFurthermore, \\(\\Bel_E = \\alpha(\\Pr)_E = \\alpha(\\Pr_E)\\) for all\n\\(E\\in{\\bf A}^{\\Pr}\\). \n\nIn other words: odds-threshold acceptance followed by Shoham revision\nyields the same belief state as Bayesian conditioning followed by\nodds-threshold acceptance. (Kelly and Lin (forthcoming) recommend a\nmodification of the odds-threshold rule proposed in Lin and Kelly\n(2012).) Although the original plausibility ordering \\(\\prec_p\\) is\nbuilt from the probability function \\(\\Pr,\\) subsequent qualitative\nupdate proceeds without consulting the (conditioned) probabilities.\nThat shows that there are at least some architectures that\neffortlessly keep the probabilistic and qualitative reasoning systems\nin harmony.\n\nFans of AGM will regret that Shoham revision does not satisfy AGM\nPreservation (Rational Monotony). Lin and Kelly (2012) prove that no\n\u201csensible\u201d acceptance rule that tracks conditioning can\nsatisfy Inclusion and Preservation. We omit the technical definition\nof sensible rules here. For a summary, see Section 6.4 in Genin\n(2019).\n4.2.5 Epistemic Decision Theory\n\nAll of the bridge principles we have seen so far have the following in\ncommon: whether an agent\u2019s full and partial beliefs cohere is a\nmatter of the full and partial beliefs  alone. It is not\nnecessary to mention preferences or utilities in order to evaluate a\nbelief state. There is another tradition, originating in Hempel (1962)\nand receiving classical expression in Levi (1967a), that assimilates\nthe problem of \u201cdeciding\u201d what to believe to a Bayesian\ndecision-theoretic model. Crucially, these authors are not committed\nto a picture on which agents literally decide what to\nbelieve\u2013rather they claim that an agent\u2019s beliefs are\nsubject to the same kind of normative evaluation as their practical\ndecision-making. Contemporary contributions to this tradition include\nEaswaran (2015), Pettigrew (2016) and Dorst (2017). Presented here is\na somewhat simplified version of Levi\u2019s (1967a) account taking\npropositions, rather than sentences, as the objects of belief.\n\nAs usual, let \\(W\\) be a set of possible worlds. The agent is taken to\nbe interested in answering a  question  \\({\\bf Q},\\) which is\na partition of \\(W\\) into a finite collection of mutually exhaustive\nanswers \\(\\{ H_1, H_2, \\ldots H_n\\}.\\) Levi calls situations of this\nsort \u201cefforts to replace agnosticism by true belief,\u201d\nechoing themes in Peirce (1877):\n\nDoubt is an uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to\nfree ourselves and pass into the state of belief; while the latter is\na calm and satisfactory state which we do not wish to avoid, or to\nchange to a belief in anything else. On the contrary, we cling\ntenaciously, not merely to believing, but to believing just what we do\nbelieve.\n\n The agent\u2019s partial beliefs are represented by a probability function \\(\\Pr\\) that is defined, at a minimum, over the algebra \\({\\bf A}\\) generated by the question. Levi recommends the following procedure to determine which propositions are fully believed: disjoin all those elements of \\({\\bf Q}\\) that have  maximal  expected epistemic utility and then close under deductive consequence. The  expected epistemic utility of a hypothesis \\(H\\in{\\bf A}\\) is defined as: \\[E(H) := \\Pr(H)\\cdot U(H) + \\Pr(\\neg H)\\cdot u(H),\\] where \\(U(H)\\) is the epistemic utility of accepting \\(H\\) when it is true, and \\(u(H)\\) is the utility of accepting \\(H\\) when it is false. How are \\(u(H), U(H)\\) to be determined? Levi is guided by the following principles.\n\nTrue answers have greater epistemic utility than false\nanswers.\nTrue answers that afford a high degree of relief from agnosticism\nhave greater epistemic utility than true answers that afford a low\ndegree of relief from agnosticism.\nFalse answers that afford a high degree of relief from agnosticism\nhave greater epistemic utility than false answers that afford a low\ndegree of relief from agnosticism.\n\n\nIt is easy to object to these principles. The first principle\nestablishes a lexicographic preference for true beliefs. It is\nconceivable that, contra this principle, an informative false belief\nthat is approximately true should have greater epistemic utility than\nan uninformative true belief. The first principle precludes trading\ncontent against truthlikeness. It is also conceivable that, contra the\nthird principle, one would prefer to be wrong, but not too\nopinionated, than wrong and opinionated. The only unexceptionable\nprinciple seems to be the second. \n\nTo measure the degree of relief from agnosticism, a probability\nfunction \\(m(\\cdot)\\) is defined over the elements of \\({\\bf A}\\).\nCrucially, \\(m(\\cdot)\\) does not measure a degree of belief, but\ndegree of  uninformativeness. The degree of relief from\nagnosticism afforded by \\(H\\in {\\bf A},\\) also referred to as the \namount of content  in \\(H\\), is defined to be the complement of\nuninformativeness: \\(cont(H_i) = m(\\neg H_i).\\) Levi argues that all\nthe elements of \\({\\bf Q}\\) ought to be assigned the same amount of\ncontent, i.e. \\(m(H_i)=\\frac{1}{n}\\) and therefore \\(cont(H_i)=\n\\frac{n-1}{n}\\) for each \\(H_i\\in{\\bf Q}\\). The set of epistemic\nutility functions that Levi recommends satisfy the following\nconditions: \n\n\\(U(H) = 1 - q\\cdot cont(\\neg H);\\)\n\\(u(H) = \\hspace{7pt} - q\\cdot cont(\\neg H),\\)\n\n where \\(0 \\lt q \\lt 1.\\) All such utility functions are guaranteed to satisfy Levi\u2019s three principles. The parameter \\(q\\) is interepreted as a \u201cdegree of caution,\u201d representing the premium  placed on truth as opposed to relief from agnosticism. When \\(q=1\\) the epistemic utility of suspending judgement, \\(U(W)\\), is equal to zero. This is the situation in which the premium placed on relief from doubt is the maximum. Levi proves that expected epistemic utility \\(E(H)\\) is maximal iff \\(\\Pr(H)> q \\cdot cont(\\neg H).\\) Therefore, Levi\u2019s ultimate recommendation is that the agent believe all deductive consequences of \\[\\cap \\{ \\neg H_i \\in {\\bf Q} : \\Pr(\\neg H_i)> 1 - q \\cdot cont(\\neg H_i) \\}.\\] From this formulation  it is possible to see Levi\u2019s proposal as a question-dependent version of the Lockean thesis where the appropriate threshold is a function of content. However, Levi takes pains to make sure that the result of this operation is deductively cogent and therefore  avoids Lottery-type paradoxes.\n\nContemporary contributions to the decision-theoretic tradition proceed\ndifferently from Levi. Most recent work does not take epistemic\nutility to be primarily a function of content. Most of these proposals\ndo not refer to a question in context. Many proposals, such as\nEaswaran (2015), Dorst (2017), are equivalent to a version of the\nLockean thesis, where the threshold is determined by the utility the\nagent assigns to true and false beliefs. Since these are essentially\nLockean proposals, they are subject to Lottery-style paradoxes. ",
