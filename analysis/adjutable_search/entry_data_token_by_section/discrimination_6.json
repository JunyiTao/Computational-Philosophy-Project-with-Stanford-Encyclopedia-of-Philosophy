    "main_text": "Types of Discrimination (in its Moralized Sense) || Organizational, Institutional, and Structural Discrimination\n2.3 Organizational, Institutional, and Structural Discrimination\n\n\nIn many cases, acts of discrimination are attributed to collective\nagents, rather than to natural persons acting in their individual\ncapacities. Accordingly, corporations, universities, government\nagencies, religious bodies, and other collective agents can act in\ndiscriminatory ways. This kind of discrimination can be called\n\u201corganizational,\u201d and it cuts across the direct-indirect\ndistinction. Confusion sometimes arises when it is mistakenly believed\nthat organizations cannot have intentions and that only indirect\ndiscrimination is possible for them. As collective agents,\norganizations do have intentions, and those intentions are a function\nof who the officially authorized agents of the institution are and\nwhat they are trying to do when they act as their official powers\nenable them. Suppose that the Board of Trustees of a university votes\nto adopt an admissions policy that (implicitly or explicitly) excludes\nJews, and the trustees vote that way precisely because they believe\nthat Jews are inherently more dishonest and greedy than other\npeople. In such a cases, the university is deliberately\nexcluding Jews and is guilty of direct discrimination. Individual\ntrustees acting in their private capacity might engage in other forms\nof discriminatory conduct; for example, they might refuse to join\nclubs that have Jewish members. Such a refusal would not count as\norganizational discrimination. But any discriminatory acts\nattributable to individual board members in virtue of some official\npower that they hold would count as organizational discrimination.\n\n\nStructural discrimination\u2014sometimes called\n\u201cinstitutional\u201d (Ture and Hamilton 1992 [1967]:\n4)\u2014should be distinguished from organizational: the structural\nform concerns the rules that constitute and regulate the major sectors\nof life such as family relations, property ownership and exchange,\npolitical powers and responsibilities, and so on (Pogge 2008: 37). It\nis true that when such rules are discriminatory, they are\noften\u2014though not always\u2014the deliberate product of some\ncollective or individual agent, such as a legislative body or\nexecutive official. In such cases, the agents are guilty of direct\ndiscrimination. But the idea of structural discrimination is an effort\nto capture a wrong distinct from direct discrimination.  Thus, Fred\nPincus writes that \u201c[t]he key element in structural\ndiscrimination is not the intent but the effect of keeping minority\ngroups in a subordinate position\u201d (1994: 84). What Pincus and\nothers have in mind can be explained in the following way.\n\n\nWhen the rules of a society\u2019s major institutions reliably\nproduce disproportionately disadvantageous outcomes for the members of\ncertain salient social groups and the production of such outcomes is\nunjust, then there is structural discrimination against the members of\nthe groups in question, apart from any direct discrimination in which\nthe collective or individual agents of the society might engage.\nThis account does not mean that, empirically speaking, structural\ndiscrimination stands free of direct discrimination. It is highly\nunlikely that the reliable production of unjust and\ndisproportionately disadvantageous effects would be a chance\noccurrence. Rather, it is (almost) always the case that, at some\npoint(s) in the history of a society in which there is structural\ndiscrimination, important collective agents, such as governmental ones,\nintentionally created rules with the aim of disadvantaging the members\nof the groups in question. It is also likely that some collective\nand individual agents continue to engage in direct discrimination in\nsuch a society. But by invoking the idea of structural\ndiscrimination and attributing the discrimination to the rules of a\nsociety\u2019s major institutions, we are pointing to a form of\ndiscrimination that is conceptually distinct from the direct\ndiscrimination engaged in by collective or individual agents. Thus\nunderstood, structural discrimination is, as a conceptual matter,\nnecessarily indirect, although, as an empirical matter, direct\ndiscrimination is (almost) always part of the story of how structural\ndiscrimination came to be and continues to exist.\n\n\nAlso note that the idea of structural discrimination does not\npresuppose that, whenever the rules of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions consistently produce disproportionately disadvantageous\nresults for a salient group such as women or racial minorities,\nstructural discrimination thereby exists. Because our concern is\nwith the moralized concept of discrimination, one might think that\ndisproportionate outcomes, by themselves, entail that an injustice has\nbeen done to the members of the salient group in question and that\nstructural discrimination thereby exists against the group.\nHowever, on a moralized concept of structural discrimination, the\ninjustice condition is distinct from the disproportionate outcome\ncondition. Whether a disproportionate outcome is sufficient for\nconcluding that there is an injustice against the members of the group\nis a substantive moral question. Some thinkers might claim that\nthe answer is affirmative, and such a claim is consistent with the\nmoralized concept of structural discrimination. However, the\nclaim is not presupposed by the moralized concept, which incorporates\nonly the conceptual thesis that a pattern of disproportionate\ndisadvantage falling on the members of certain salient groups does not\ncount as structural discrimination unless the pattern violates sound\nprinciples of distributive justice.\n",
