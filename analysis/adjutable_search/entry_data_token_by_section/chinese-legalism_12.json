    "main_text": "Ordering the Bureaucracy || Monitoring Officials: Techniques of Rule\n4.2 Monitoring Officials: Techniques of Rule\n\nThe chapter \u201cDefining the standards\u201d of Han Feizi\nfamously criticized Shang Yang for being too focused on fa\n(meaning in this context the control of society), while paying\ninsufficient interest to the problems of governing the political\napparatus. Han Fei, by contrast (as well as Shen Buhai, many of whose\nideas Han Fei adopted), paid primary attention to the latter. Han\nFei\u2019s observation, \u201cthe sage orders the officials, not the\npeople\u201d (Han Feizi 35.4.1) is insightful. No problem\ncould be dealt with adequately unless the ruler possessed an efficient\nand responsive bureaucracy.\n\nDealing with the bureaucrats posed two problems. First, Han Fei\npresumes that officials will normally do whatever possible to cater to\ntheir selfish needs, bringing about dereliction of duty, corruption,\nand the resultant weakening of governability. Second, and more\npeculiar to Han Feizi, the text repeatedly warns that the\nreal problem with the officials is not just that of corruption and\ninefficiency. Rather, powerful officials are bent on subverting the\nsovereign\u2019s power and even outright usurping the throne. A\nprudent ruler should adequately deal with both\u2014indirect and\ndirect\u2014threats. To do so, he must pay utmost attention to the\n\u201ctechniques of rule\u201d (shu \u8853).\n\nThe term shu has two aspects. First, it refers to a variety\nof bureaucratic devices aimed at monitoring the officials\u2019\nperformance. For instance, \u201cTechnique is bestowing office on the\nbasis of concrete responsibilities, demanding performance on the basis\nof titles, wielding the levers of life and death, and examining the\nabilities of the ministers\u201d (Han Feizi 43.1.2,\n\u201cDefining the standards\u201d). These are reasonable mechanisms\nthat can be adequately utilized in modern management. Ditto for the\ntext\u2019s insistence that the ruler preserves absolute control over\nrewards and punishments. Yet there is a second, and more problematic\naspect of shu: it refers to a variety of means aimed at\nsafeguarding the ruler\u2019s power against his scheming underlings.\nThis underlying concern is well palpable in Han Fei\u2019s discussion\nof the principle of \u201cperformance and titles\u201d\n(xingming \u5f62\u540d)\u2014one of the crucial elements\nin his administrative thought (for the term xingming cf.\nMakeham 1990\u201391; Indracollo forthcoming). Han Feizi\nexplains:\n\n\nA sovereign who wants to suppress treachery must examine and match\nperformance (or the form, xing \u5f62) and title (or the\nname, ming \u540d). Performance and title refer to the\ndifference between the proposal and the task. The minister lays out\nhis proposal; the ruler assigns him the task according to his\nproposal, and solely on the basis of the task determines [the\nminister\u2019s] merit. When the merit matches the task, and the task\nmatches the proposal, [the minister] is rewarded; when the merit does\nnot match the task and the task does not match the proposal, he is\npenalized. \u2026 Thus, when the clear-sighted sovereign nourishes\nhis ministers, the minister should not claim merit by overstepping\n[the duties of] his office, nor should he present the proposal that\ndoes not match [his task]. One who oversteps his office\u2019s\n[duties] dies; one who[se proposal] does not match [the task] is\npunished; then the ministers are unable to form cabals and cliques\n(Han Feizi 7.2, \u201cTwo levers\u201d).\n\n\nGoldin (2020: 214) compares the notion of \u201cperformance and\ntitles\u201d to the modern call for bids. A minister makes the\nproposal on the basis of his official duties; his actual performance\nis then matched against his proposal and the result (reward or\npunishment) is determined accordingly. Whether or not one accepts the\nlogic of this management style, it is safe to say that in principle it\nis not controversial. However, it is framed above within the context\nof the ruler\u2019s struggle against ministerial treachery and\nagainst cabals and cliques. This brings us to the more problematic\naspect of Han Fei\u2019s \u201ctechniques\u201d: their clandestine\nand tricky nature. Han Fei explains:\n\n\nAs for techniques of rule, they are hidden in the breast. It is that\nthrough which you match up all the various ends and from your secret\nplace steer the ministers. Therefore, laws (fa) are best when\nthey are clear, whereas techniques should not be seen. (Han\nFeizi 38.8.2, \u201cObjections 3\u201d)\n\n\nThe reason behind this secrecy is that the techniques of rule serve\nnot just to help the ruler perfect the bureaucratic mechanism, but,\nmore urgently, to safeguard him against closest aides. Han\nFeizi is adamant in its repeated warnings to the ruler: beware of\neverybody; especially of your ministers. For instance, chapter 8,\n\u201cExtolling authority\u201d postulates:\n\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \u201cA hundred battles a day are fought\nbetween the superior and his underlings.\u201d The underlings conceal\ntheir selfish [interests], trying to test their superior; the superior\nemploys gauges and measures to restrict the underlings. Hence when\ngauges and measures are established, they are the sovereign\u2019s\ntreasure; when the cliques and cabals are formed, they are the\nministers\u2019 treasure. If a minister does not murder his ruler,\nthis is because the cliques and cabals are not formed yet. (Han\nFeizi 8.8)\n\n\nAmazingly, Han Fei\u2014himself an aspiring minister\u2014concludes\nthat the ministers are by definition the ruler\u2019s mortal enemies.\nIf they did not carry out the assassination, it is only because they\ndid not prepare adequately, or, as the text explains elsewhere,\nbecause the ruler was prudent enough to outwit them through the proper\napplication of the techniques of rule. Han Fei\u2019s view echoes\nShen Buhai\u2019s assessment that the ruler\u2019s true enemies are\nnot the outsiders, \u201cinvaders and bandits,\u201d but rather an\ninsider: a minister, who \u201cby limiting what the ruler sees and\nrestricting what the ruler hears, seizes his government and\nmonopolizes his commands, possesses his people and takes his\nstate\u201d (Creel 1974: 344, translation modified).\n\nThis pronounced anti-ministerial mindset of the fa thinkers\nstands at the backdrop of some of Han Fei\u2019s most questionable\nrecommendations to the ruler, such as \u201cissue confusing\nedicts\u201d or \u201csay the opposite of what you mean\u201d\n(Han Feizi 30.0.0, \u201cInner Congeries of Explanations,\nPart I: The Seven Techniques\u201d). The friction between the\nfairness and transparency of fa and the trickery and secrecy\nof shu is most visible here. Song Hongbing (forthcoming A)\nsuggests that it reflects Han Fei\u2019s realization of the dirty\nnature of political struggles in which fair and transparent norms of\nfa are not applicable. Indeed, if we accept Han Fei\u2019s\ngloomy expectation that almost every political actor is driven purely\nby selfish interests, then the politics becomes a perennial war of\nsurvival. This said, sometimes the thinker qualifies his own cynicism\nand indicates that through proper utilization of the means of his\ndisposal the ruler can maintain his rule without going to extremes.\nThus, having compared the ministers to the ruler-devouring tigers, Han\nFei explains: \u201cwhen the application of laws and the punishments\nis reliable, the tigers will be transformed into humans, reverting to\ntheir true state\u201d (Han Feizi 8.7; \u201cExtolling\nauthority\u201d).\n\nIn the final account, ministers are human beings, and they can serve\nthe ruler well. All that is needed is to remember that the\nruler-minister relations are based not on devotion and loyalty but on\npure calculation of benefit. Insofar as the ruler relies on techniques\nof rule and utilizes the advantages of his positional power (section\n5.1 below), in particular his control over rewards and punishments,\nthe ministers will serve him faithfully. They will do it not because\nthey are morally committed to the sovereign or the polity, but due to\na simple calculation of personal benefits. This is yet another\nmanifestation of the advantage of the rule by impartial standards.\n",
