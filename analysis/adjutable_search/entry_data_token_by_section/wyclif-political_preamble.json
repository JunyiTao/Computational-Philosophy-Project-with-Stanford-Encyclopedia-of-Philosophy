    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe central idea of Wyclif's political philosophy is that the\ndominium defining God's primary relation to creation\njustifies all human dominium, whether it be the mastery of a\nking, a lesser civil lord, or a priest. But unlike predecessors who\nwere content to define God's mastery as foundational to human lordship\nin non-metaphysical terms, Wyclif made ready use of his realist\nontology to argue that God's dominium functions as a\nuniversal by causality for all instances of just human\ndominium. For medieval political theorists, this was not\ncommon practice; some, like\n Aquinas,\n can be argued to present unified systems of metaphysics, political\nthought, and ecclesiology, but many others, including\n Ockham,\n Marsilius of Padua, John of Paris, and\n Giles of Rome,\n did not. If, like Ockham or Giles, they had metaphysical positions,\nit is impossible to argue persuasively that their ontologies affected\ntheir politics. This makes Wyclif's political and ecclesiological\nthought notable, for it is one of the few cases where a distinguished\nmetaphysician used his ontology as a foundation for a detailed\nexamination of the just arrangement of authority in church and\nstate. An immediate corrollary to Wyclif's axiomatic position that all\njust human dominium derives from God is that no private\nproperty relations, which serve as the underpinnings for all human\nmastery, are just without grace. Because, following\n Augustine,\n private property is a direct result of the Fall of man, the ideal\nstate is one of communal ownership. Since the Church is the\nre-established ideal state, grace does not provide for its just\nownership of any property whatsoever. Because Wyclif saw the\nfourteenth-century church enjoying the lion's share of property\nownership in England, he argued that the king was bound by God to\nrelieve the church of its property, and to rule over it as a divinely\nappointed steward. The substance of this argument was realized by\nHenry VIII, and so Wyclif has been associated, if only as prophetic\nforerunner, with Tudor reformation. The form of Wyclif's arguments are\nin no way comparable to modern arguments, though, and are more\ndirectly associated with earlier Franciscan positions, like those of\n Ockham,\n than they are with later political theory. In this essay, the Latin\nterm dominium will be used to distinguish Wyclif's\ntheologically medieval view from its modern English correlate\n'dominion', which connotes absolute mastery.\n",
