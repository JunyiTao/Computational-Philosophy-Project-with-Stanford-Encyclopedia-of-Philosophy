    "main_text": "Film and Authorship\n3. Film and Authorship\n\n\nFilms are the product of many individuals working together.  This is\napparent when one watches the credits at the end of any recent\nHollywood film and sees the myriad names that come scrolling by.  To\ncoin a phrase, it takes a village to make a movie.\n\n\nIt might therefore seem surprising that there is a significant\ntendency among film scholars to treat films as the product of a single\nindividual, its auteur or author. On this line of\ninterpretation, the director of the film is the creative intelligence\nwho shapes the entire film in a manner parallel to how we think of,\nsay, literary works being authored.\n\n\nThe idea of the director as auteur was first suggested by\nFrancois Truffaut\u2014later to become one of the central directors\nin the French New Wave. Truffaut used the term polemically to\ndenigrate the then dominant mode of filmmaking that emphasized the\nadaptation of great works of literature to the screen. In the attempt\nto valorize a different style of filmmaking, Truffaut argued that the\nonly films that deserved to be designated art were those in which the\ndirector had complete control over its production by writing the\nscreenplay as well as actually directing the actors. Only films made\nin this way deserved to be given the status of works of art.\n\n\nThe well-known American film scholar and reviewer, Andrew Sarris,\nadopted Truffaut's theory in order to legitimate film studies as an\nacademic discipline. For Sarris, the auteur theory was a\ntheory of film evaluation, for it suggested to him that the works of\ngreat directors were the only significant ones. In his somewhat\nidiosyncratic use of the idea, he even argued that the flawed works of\nmajor directors were artistically better than masterpieces made by\nminor ones. A more defensible aspect of his ideas was the emphasis on\nthe entire ouvre of a director. Within film studies, the\nemphasis on synoptic studies of individual directors is derived from\nSarris' version of the auteur theory.\n\n\nA negative consequence of the influence of auterism is the\nrelative neglect of other important contributors to the making of a\nfilm. Actors, cinematographers, screenwriters, composers, and art\ndirectors all make significant contributions to films that the\nauteur theory underestimates. While Truffaut introduced the\nterm polemically to support a new style of filmmaking, subsequent\ntheorists have tended to ignore the context of his remarks.\n\n\nAs a general theory of the cinema, then, the auteur theory is\nclearly flawed. Not all films\u2014not even all great ones\u2014can\nbe attributed to the control of the director. Actors are the clearest\nexamples of individuals who may have such a significant impact on the\nmaking of a specific film that the film has to be seen as attributable\nto them even more importantly than the director. Although films like\nTruffaut's own may be (mostly) the product of his authoring, a Clint\nEastwood film owes a great deal of its success to that actor's\npresence. It is a mistake to treat all films as if they were simply\nthe product of one crucial individual, the director.  Still, old\nhabits die slowly, and films are still referenced by means of their\ndirectors.\n\n\nA more general criticism of the auteur theory is its emphasis\non individuals. Most of the great directors studied by film theorists\nworked within well-defined institutional settings, the most famous of\nwhich is Hollywood. To attempt to understand films without placing\nthem within their broader context of production has been seen as a\nreal shortcoming of the theory.\n\n\nThis sort of criticism of auterism has received a more\ntheoretical formulation within postmodernism, with its famous (or\ninfamous) declaration of the death of the author. What this\nself-consciously rhetorical gesture asserts is that works of art,\nincluding films, should not be seen as the product of a single\ncontrolling intelligence, but have to seen as products of their times\nand social contexts. The goal of the critic should not be to\nreconstruct the intentions of the author but to display the various\ndifferent contexts that explain the production of the work as well as\nits limitations.\n\n\nWhile the general institutional context is certainly crucial for\nunderstanding a film, the auteur theory does nonetheless\nprovide a useful focus for some efforts in the scholarly\nstudy of film: an exploration of the work of individual directors. But\neven here, there has been worry that the theory overemphasizes the\ncontribution of the director at the expense of other\npeople\u2014actors, directors of photography,\nscreenwriters\u2014whose contributions may be equally important to\nthe making of at least some films.\n",
