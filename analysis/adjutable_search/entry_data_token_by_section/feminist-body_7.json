    "main_text": "Sexual Difference || This Sex Which is Not One\n3.2 This Sex Which is Not One\n\nIn the work of Irigaray, (1975, 1977, 1993), we find a sustained\ncritique of both philosophy and psychoanalysis, for their masculinist\npresuppositions. She points out that in these bodies of work\n\u201cman\u201d is presented as the universal norm, and sexual\ndifference is not recognized, or it is recognized in such a way that\nwoman is conceptualized as the \u201cmaternal-feminine\u201d, which\nhas been left behind in the move to abstract thought. Such a critique\ninsists on the recognition of sexual difference and the difference\nthat female corporeality can make to the shape which thought can take.\nShe makes here what may seem like a rather startling claim: namely\nthat the morphology of the body is reflected in the morphology of\ncertain thought processes. So, for example, western rationality is\nmarked by principles of identity, non-contradiction, binarism, atomism\nand determinate individuation. She sees this as: \u201cthe one of\nform, of the individual, of the (male) sex organ\u201d. In contrast:\n\u201cthe contact of at least two (lips) keeps woman in touch with\nherself\u201d (1977 [1985: 79]), and suggests an ambiguity of individuation, a fluidity\nand mobility, a rejection of stable forms.\n\nSuch claims have been interpreted by some as suggesting that Irigaray\nis a biological essentialist, that she sees the biology of male and\nfemale bodies as yielding (potentially) different patterns of thought,\nand that she is insisting that the thinking and writing which is\nexpressive of women\u2019s bodies should be made visible. In contrast\nto such a reading however, is Irigaray\u2019s own insistence on the\nimpossibility of returning to a body outside of its representation\nwithin culture. This makes evident that the bodily features which she\ninvokes in her writings are not brute materialities, but, (as is\nperhaps made clearest in Whitford 1991), bodies as they\nfeature in the interconnected symbolic and imaginary of western\nculture. (1991: chapter 3). When Irigaray refers to male and female\nbodily characteristics she is, according to Whitford, capturing the\nway she finds these features both represented and imagined, that is,\naffectively experienced, in the personal and social domain. She argues\nfor the need to reconstruct an inter-connected imaginary and symbolic\nof the female body which is liveable and positive for women. Whitford\nsuggests this is not an essentialist task of providing an accurate\ndescription of women\u2019s bodies as they really are. It is a\ncreative one in which the female body is lovingly re-imagined and\nrearticulated to enable women to both feel and think differently about\ntheir embodied form. Irigaray\u2019s attention to the imaginary body\nis, however, informed by a respect for a materiality, a nature, which\nalthough open to multiple modes of disclosure, offers us two kinds\nof sexed bodies, to which our imaginary significations remain\nanswerable.\n\nIrigaray herself considers how philosophical and psychoanalytic\nthinking would be different if we took a re-imagined female or\nmaternal body as its starting point instead of the male body, imagined\nin phallic terms. Such work has been continued in the writings of, for\nexample, Battersby (1998), Cavarero (1995) and Alison Stone (2011).\nBattersby explores \u201cwhat happens to the notion of identity if we\ntreat the embodied female as the norm for models of the self\u201d\n(1998: 38). Natality challenges a fixed conception of identity, makes\nevident that self and non-self are not in opposition, and that\nidentity \u201cerupts from the flesh\u201d (1998: 39). For Cavarero\nthe lack of attention paid to the fact that we are born from woman has\ngiven western metaphysics a preoccupation with death rather than\nbirth. Stone (2011) explores the maternal body to suggest models of\nsubjectivity of a new kind, immersed in relations of intimacy and\ndependence. Stone \u201canalyses this form of subjectivity in terms\nof how the mother typically reproduces with her child her history of\nbodily relations with her own mother, leading to a distinctive\nmaternal and cyclical form of lived time\u201d (2011: Jacket).\n",
