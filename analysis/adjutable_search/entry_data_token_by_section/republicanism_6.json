    "main_text": "Republican Liberty: Problems and Debates || What Counts as \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 Power?\n2.2 What Counts as \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 Power?\n\nA second major difficulty in developing the republican idea of freedom\nlies in giving precise meaning to the notion of arbitrariness.\nAccording to what criteria are we to consider power\n\u2018arbitrary\u2019? Not simply when its exercise is random or\nunpredictable. This view would undermine the whole point of the\nrepublican conception of political liberty. As discussed above, with\nlong experience a slave is better able to predict his master\u2019s\nbehavior, and so it appears less random to him, but (the civic\nrepublican wants to argue) the slave does not enjoy greater freedom by\nthat fact alone. Just because one is better able to cope with\narbitrary power, it does not follow that one\u2019s domination is any\nless.\n\n\u2018Discretionary\u2019 is much closer to the relevant meaning of\narbitrary, but it is not quite right either. Discretionary power might\nbe delegated to a public agency with a view to advancing certain\npolicy goals or ends\u2014as for example Congress has delegated\ndiscretionary authority to the Federal Reserve\u2014but we would not\nwant to say that this reduces our freedom (or, at any rate, not so\nlong as that discretionary authority is appropriately answerable to a\ncommon knowledge understanding of the goals or ends it is meant to\nserve and the means it is permitted to employ). For reasons explained\nin the fourth section of this entry, contemporary civic republicans\nmust be able to offer an account of non-arbitrary, yet discretionary\nauthority.\n\nHow then should we characterize arbitrary power? Broadly speaking, two\nanswers have been proposed. The first defines non-arbitrariness\nprocedurally. Power is not arbitrary, on this view, to the extent that\nit is reliably controlled by effective rules, procedures, or goals\nthat are common knowledge to all persons or groups concerned\n(Lovett\u00a02010, 2022). To be reliable and effective, on this view,\nconstraints must be resilient over a wide range of possible changes or\nmodifications in the relevant circumstances. Roughly speaking, the\nprocedural view equates republican freedom with the traditional idea\nof the rule of law, provided we are willing to extend the latter idea\nconsiderably (List 2006; Lovett 2016a).\n\nAlternatively, we might define non-arbitrariness democratically. Power\nis not arbitrary, on this second view, to the extent that it is\ndirectly or indirectly controlled by the concerned persons or groups\nthemselves. In an example offered by Pettit (2012, 57\u201358),\nsuppose Andrea has given Bob the keys to her alcohol cupboard, with\nstrict instructions that no matter how much she pleads, he is not to\nreturn them except on twenty-four hours notice. Since Bob must answer\nto Andrea for his conduct in this regard, his power over her is not\narbitrary. In roughly the same way, the power of the state over its\ncitizens will not be arbitrary provided the people have an equal share\nin controlling how their state exercises its power. Many authors\nsubscribe to some version of this democratic view (see for example\nBohman 2008; Laborde 2008; Forst 2013; McCammon 2015).\n\nEither way, two caveats are worth noting. The first is that, on either\nview, arbitrariness simply means uncontrolled and vice versa.\nPettit\u2019s recent preference for the latter term over the former\n(e.g., Pettit 2012, 2014) is simply due to its superior clarity, and\nrepresents neither a real change in view nor the addition of a new\ncondition alongside the old. The second caveat is that, again on\neither view, arbitrary or uncontrolled power should not be defined\nalong substantive lines as power that is unjust or illegitimate. This\nwas never Pettit\u2019s view, though in earlier work (e.g., Pettit\n1997) some passages may have inadvertently suggested otherwise. The\nwell-known problem with a moralized definition of arbitrariness is\nthat it would collapse our conception of republican freedom into a\ngeneral account of the human good (Larmore 2001; Costa 2007; Carter\n2008).\n",
