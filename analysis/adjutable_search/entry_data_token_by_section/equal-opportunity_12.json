    "main_text": "The Scope of Equality of Opportunity || Person Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n11. Concluding remarks\n\nThe term Equality of Opportunity is really used to refer to several\ndistinct ideas, thematically unified by some form of commitment to\npermitting differential access to goods or positions based on certain\nfactors and condemning it in relation to others. The thinness of that\nbasis of unity helps to illuminate the apparent widespread (although\nnot by any means universal) agreement over the value of Equality of\nOpportunity. It also serves to expose the sense in which that degree\nof agreement is ultimately illusory, and that surface agreement\nconcerning the value of Equality of Opportunity can often conceal\nunderlying substantive disagreement over the respects in which\nindividuals ought to be made equal with one another.\n",
