    "main_text": "\n\nStarting with Frege, the semantics (and pragmatics) of quotation has\nreceived a steady flow of attention over the last one hundred or so\nyears. It has not, however, been subject to the same kind of intense\ndebate and scrutiny as, for example, the semantics of definite\ndescriptions or of propositional attitude verbs. Many philosophers\nprobably share Davidson\u2019s experience: \u2018When I was\ninitiated into the mysteries of logic and semantics, quotation was\nusually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction\nwas accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and\nmention of expressions\u2019 (Davidson 1979, p. 79). Those who leave\nit at that, however, miss out on one of the most difficult and\ninteresting topics in the philosophy of language.\n\nConsider the following\n sentences:[1]\n\n(1)\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true in English iff snow is white.\n\n(2)\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 refers to Aristotle.\n(3)\n\u2018The\u2019 is the definite article in English.\n(4)\n\u2018Bachelor\u2019 has eight letters.\n\n\nQuotation interests philosophers and linguists for various reasons,\nincluding these:\n\nWhen language is used to attribute properties to language or\notherwise theorize about it, a linguistic device is needed that\n\u2018turns language on itself\u2019. Quotation is one such device.\nIt is our primary meta-linguistic tool and if you don\u2019t\nunderstand quotation, then you can\u2019t understand sentences like\n(1)\u2013(4). Those who are in the business of theorizing about\nlanguage are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms\nthat render (1)\u2013(4) intelligible.\nTheories of quotation address questions not just about\nhow quotations refer, but also about what they refer\nto. In this regard, theories of quotation tell us what we are talking\nabout in (1)\u2013(4).\nQuotation is a paradigmatic opaque context, i.e. a context in\nwhich substitution of synonymous or co-referential expressions can\nfail to preserve truth-value. To understand the nature of opacity you\nmust understand how quotation functions.\nQuotation is a device for talking about language, but it does so\nin a particularly tricky way: somehow quotation manages to use its\nreferent to do (or at least to participate in) the referring. Putting\nquotation marks around a word creates a device that refers to that\nvery word: \u2018\u2018Aristotle\u2019\u2019 refers to\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019. As such, quotation is a particularly\ninteresting referential device.\nAs with all issues in the philosophy of language, theories of\nquotation harbor assumptions about how best to draw the distinction\nbetween semantics and pragmatics, and they do so in a particularly\nilluminating way.\nAccounting for quotation presents some interesting technical\nchallenges in formal semantics, attempting to resolve which can shed\nlight on our understanding of such fundamental notions as\nindexicality, monstrosity, and compositionality.\n\n\nThe entry is structured as follows:\n",
