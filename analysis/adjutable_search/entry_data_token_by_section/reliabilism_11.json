However, it\u2019s\nwidely thought that beliefs come in degrees: a person might believe\nthat it\u2019s sunny and also believe that it\u2019s Monday, but\nhave a higher degree of belief in the former than the latter. This\nraises the question: can reliabilism be extended to provide an account\nof the justificatory status of degrees of belief?\n\nFormal epistemologists have long been interested in different\n\u201cscoring rules\u201d\u2014functions that measure the accuracy\nor inaccuracy of degrees of belief (hereafter, credences). For\nexample, one widely discussed scoring rule is the Brier score\n(Brier 1950). Let \\(C(p)\\) be an agent\u2019s credence in \\(p\\); let\n\\(T(p)\\) be \\(p\\)\u2019s indicator function, which equals 1 if \\(p\\)\nis true, and 0 if \\(p\\) is false. \\(C(p)\\)\u2019s Brier score is\ncalculated by the formula: \n\n\\[(C(p)-T(p))^2\\]\n\n\nThus, a credence of 1 in a true proposition will get a Brier score of\n0\u2014the best score possible. A credence of 1 in a false\nproposition will get a Brier score of 1\u2014the worst score\npossible. An intermediate credence of .6 will get a Brier score of .16\nif the proposition is true, and .36 if it is false.\n\nGiven a particular scoring rule R, we can develop a measure of\nprocess reliability (Dunn 2015; Tang 2016; Pettigrew 2021). Let\nX be some credence-forming process: that is, a process that\noutputs credences in a range of propositions. We can use R to\nscore all of the credences that X produces. Average all of\nthese scores, and we have a measure of X\u2019s degree of\nreliability. Process reliabilists can then use this measure of\nreliability to give an account of justification for credences: a\ncredence is (prima facie) justified iff it is produced by a\nreliable credence-forming process.\n\nWhat is the most suitable scoring rule for process reliabilism to use?\nRecent work has begun to tackle this question. In what follows, we\nconfine ourselves to discussing two particularly prominent scoring\nrules\u2014the Brier score and a calibration score.\n\nGiven its prominence in the literature, the Brier score is a natural\noption. But using the Brier score to measure the reliability of\ncredence-forming processes faces challenges. For example, Dunn (2015)\nand Tang (2016) object that if the Brier score is used, a\ncredence-forming process that only outputs mid-level credences (say, a\ncredence of .6) will never qualify as highly reliable; hence the\ncredences it produces will never count as highly justified. Both Dunn\nand Tang object to this consequence. For instance, Tang argues that\nsometimes a particular input requires having a mid-level credence. If\nI have a vague visual experience of the silhouette of a horse, then it\nseems I should only have a mid-level credence that there is a horse in\nfront of me: a credence of .6 in this proposition might well be\njustified, whereas a credence of 1 or 0 would not.\n\nAnother option is to measure the reliability of credence-forming\nprocesses using a calibration score. To see what it means for\na credal state to be well-calibrated, consider the following example\nfrom van Fraassen:\n\n\nConsider a weather forecaster who says in the morning that the\nprobability of rain equals .8. That day it either rains or does not.\nHow good a forecaster is he? Clearly, to evaluate him we must look at\nhis performance over a longer period of time. Calibration is a measure\nof agreement between judgments and actual frequencies\u2026 This\nforecaster was perfectly calibrated over the past year, for example,\nif, for every number r, the proportion of rainy days among\nthose days on which he announced probability r for rain,\nequaled r. (van Fraassen 1984: 245)\n\n\nAccording to the calibration approach, a credence is justified iff it\nis produced by a well-calibrated process. This avoids the objection to\nusing the Brier score: after all, a credence-forming process that\nproduces mid-level credences can still be well-calibrated.\n\nHowever, the calibration approach has also elicited criticism. Goldman\n(1986) asks us to imagine an agent A, 70% of whose opinions\nturn out to be true. A can achieve a perfectly calibrated\ncredence function by adopting a .7 credence in every proposition about\nwhich she has an opinion. However, Goldman argues that it\u2019s\nwrong to automatically conclude that A\u2019s credal state is\nperfectly reliable. If A has no good reason for adopting a .7\ncredence in many of the propositions in question, then her credal\nstate shouldn\u2019t count as justified. Dunn (2015) defends the\ncalibration approach, arguing that the relevant question is whether\nthe process that produced A\u2019s credal state is\nreliable. In order to answer this question, it\u2019s not enough to\nlook at the truth-ratio of A\u2019s opinions at the actual\nworld; rather, we should look across a range of nearby worlds. If\nit\u2019s just a matter of chance that 70% of the propositions\nA has an opinion about are true, then by looking at the\ntruth-values of A\u2019s opinions at nearby worlds the\ncalibration approach will be able to avoid the counterintuitive\nconsequence that A\u2019s credal state is perfectly\nreliable.\n\nTang (2016) objects to the calibration approach on the grounds that a\ncredence-forming process can be well-calibrated even though that\nprocess is insensitive to relevant evidence. In light of the perceived\nshortcomings of the calibration approach (and those of alternative\nscoring rules), Tang proposes a synthesis of reliabilism and\nevidentialism, where evidentialism can roughly be understood as the\nview that a belief\u2019s justification is determined by how well it\nis supported by the believer\u2019s evidence. According to\nTang\u2019s proposal, a credence of \\(C(p)\\) is only justified if it\nis based on some ground \\(g\\), such that the objective probability of\nthe credence having a true content given \\(g\\) approximates \\(C(p).\\)\nMore recently, Pettigrew (2021) has argued that these two approaches\nshould not be viewed as competitors at all. Pettigrew suggests that we\ncan develop a version of the calibration approach that makes reference\nto the agent\u2019s evidence. Once we do, this version turns out to\nbe extensionally equivalent to a version of Tang\u2019s approach.\nBoth Tang and Pettigrew\u2019s approaches to this issue can thus be\nviewed as syntheses of reliabilism and evidentialism, to be discussed\nin more detail in\n \u00a74.2\n below.\n\nOnly recently have philosophers started to systematically explore the\npossibility of using scoring rules to provide a reliabilist theory of\ncredal justification. Given its position at the intersection of\ntraditional and formal epistemology, this will likely prove to be a\nrich and important area of ongoing research.\n",
