    "main_text": "Different Kinds of Luck\n1. Different Kinds of Luck\n\nLuck is a pervasive feature of human life (Williams 1981, 21). It\nappears to arise in (at least) four main ways (Nagel 1979; Statman\n1993, 11). First, the outcomes of our actions are affected by luck\n(resultant luck). Some months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nin 2022, it may have seemed prudent to invest in stocks. Someone who\ndid so may rightly see the ensuing reduction of her wealth as bad\nresultant luck. Second, the circumstances in which one acts introduce\nluck (circumstantial luck). A person who is offered proper incentives\nand plenty of time to deliberate may make a wiser decision than she\nwould under less favorable conditions; it may be by accident that she\nfinds herself in the favorable conditions and hence makes the wiser\ndecision (but see Pritchard 2005, 254\u2013261). Third, luck affects\nthe kind of person you are (constitutive luck). Genetically, some\npeople are at greater risk of cancer through smoking than others, and\nbecause of this it makes sense to say that some smokers are lucky to\navoid cancer. Finally, there is luck in the way one\u2019s actions\nare determined by antecedent circumstances (antecedent causal luck).\nChildren who grow up in a stimulating environment perhaps become more\nmotivated than they would in a duller setting; yet children rarely\ndetermine the time and place in which they are raised. When we add up\nresultant, circumstantial, constitutive, and antecedent causal luck,\nthe area of life that is free of luck seems to shrink \u201cto an\nextensionless point\u201d (Nagel 1979, 35; compare Parfit 1995,\n10\u201312; Lang 2021; Levy 2014).\n\nLuck that does not affect a person\u2019s interests is irrelevant\nfrom the point of view of justice. But luck that does\u2014whether\nthe interests are characterized in terms of welfare, resources,\nopportunities, capabilities to achieve functionings, or in some other\nway\u2014certainly seems relevant. People who end up less well (or\nbetter) off than others as a result of luck often ask \u201cWhy\nme?\u201d (Otsuka 2004, 151\u2013152). For instance, many affluent\npeople, reflecting on the situation of poor people in poor countries,\nwould be inclined to think that it is simply the latter\u2019s bad\nluck to have been born in such countries. They would further assume\nthat it is their own good luck to have been born in affluent\ncountries, that they do not deserve their favorable starting position,\nand that this makes the inequality unjust. If those who live in poor\ncountries were in the situation they find themselves in through their\nown fault, and not victims of bad luck, no question of distributive\njustice would arise. But they are not, and it seems unfair and unjust\nthat some people\u2019s prospects are worse than others\u2019 simply\nin virtue of birthplace (Caney 2005, 122; for opposing considerations\nsee Miller 2007, 56\u201375). The underlying assumption seems to be\nthat luck-affected differential standings are morally undesirable or\nunjust (Arneson 1989, 85; Tan 2012, 149\u2013185; Temkin 1993, 200);\nbut this assumption calls for philosophical clarification. Given the\npervasiveness of luck, such clarification appears to be required\nwhenever people end up unequally well off.\n",
