    "main_text": "Epistemology || Knowledge, Belief and Intellectual Perfection\n3.1 Knowledge, Belief and Intellectual Perfection\n\nLike most Medieval Aristotelians, Albalag understands the ultimate\ngoal of man in terms of intellectual perfection (Tiqqun\npreface: 2\u20133, n.30: 42; cf. Maimonides,\nGuide III:54; Farabi, Selected Aphorisms: 61;\nAverroes, Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction: 103). To\nfulfill this goal one has to attain knowledge of existents in a manner\n\u201cthat dispels doubt\u201d (Tiqqun preface: 3). The\nformula of \u201cdispelling doubt\u201d points to the conception\nof certainty (yaq\u012bn), which is defined in the Arab\nAristotelian tradition as a cognitive state in which the cognizer\nacquiesces that what she perceived is necessarily true and cannot be\notherwise (see Black 2006: 15\u201325). In line with this tradition,\nAlbalag specifies the logical tool of demonstration as the\nmeans for fulfilling the criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e.,\nattaining certainty).\n\nThis, however, raises a difficulty, for the ultimate goal of man would\nseem to be exclusively tied to philosophy, while the role of religion\nwould be meager. Although this difficulty is not peculiar to Albalag,\nit is particularly strong in the Tiqqun where a notable\ndichotomy between \u02beemunah (belief) and\nyedi\u02bfah (scientific knowledge) serves to confine\nreligion/Scripture to a domain of knowledge that is quantitatively and\nqualitatively different from demonstrative knowledge (i.e., prophetic\nknowledge). Whether this knowledge qualifies as an alternative or a\nparallel means to philosophy in fulfilling the epistemic requirement\nof intellectual perfection is a complex question. Insofar as the\nTiqqun is concerned, \u02beemunah can rightly be\nequated with fideism (see Tiqqun n.30: 38, 51), unlike the\nphilosophical conception of belief (for which\n\u02bei\u02bftiq\u0101d and ta\u1e63d\u012bq were\nthe basic technical terms in Arabic) advocated by many Jewish and\nMuslim philosophers and theologians (see, for instance, al-Farabi \nBook of Demonstration: 63\u20134; Sa\u02bfadia Ga\u02beon \nBook of Beliefs: 14; Maimonides Guide\nI:50). In view of the latter, belief consists in judgment or\naffirmation, following from cognitive processes and syllogistic\nreasoning, that a given perceived object is true. In this way, belief\nis said to be associated with certainty or approximation of certainty\ndepending on the form of reasoning.\n\nThe Tiqqun, by contrast, points to a traditional conception\nof belief; one that amounts to simple acceptance of a given Scriptural\ndoctrine or a set of doctrines as true without prior rational\njustification (Tiqqun n.30: 51). Simple belief can always be\nregarded as a source of certainty on account of prophetic authority\nand this appears to be the basic standpoint of the Tiqqun\n(for background on the conception of belief in Jewish thought see\nWolfson 1942: 213\u2013261; Kellner 1986; Rosenberg 1984:\n273\u2013307). Yet it is important to consider the implications that\nthe Tiqqun\u2019s extreme skeptical stance in regard to\nprophetic knowledge raises for this standpoint. The Tiqqun\nencompasses a number of significant remarks stressing the\ninaccessibility of the Torah's prophetic secrets to non-prophets\n\u2014we will see below that the Torah has two layers of esoteric\nknowledge, prophetic and philosophical.  What remains is the layer of\nphilosophical knowledge to which philosophers, as Albalag points out,\ncould have access. Accessing this layer of knowledge essentially\ndepends on allegorical interpretation of Scripture in terms of what\nwas learned from demonstrative sciences (see below). This means that\nwhatever assent Scripture evokes in a person who is well-trained in\ndemonstrative sciences (i.e., a philosopher) will be of the type of\nreason-based, namely demonstrative, assent (cf. Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 17\u201318). It would, thus, be beside the point to\nspeak of \u201csimple belief\u201d (\u02beemunah pasho\u1e6dah),\nunless we grant that simple faith attaches to the surface layer of\nScripture. But this, again, would be implausible, since Albalag admits\nthat this layer is addressed to the multitude of people who,\n\u201clike animals\u201d, lack rationality, rather than philosophers\n(Tiqqun n.30: 45; for further discussion see Guttmann\n1945).\n",
