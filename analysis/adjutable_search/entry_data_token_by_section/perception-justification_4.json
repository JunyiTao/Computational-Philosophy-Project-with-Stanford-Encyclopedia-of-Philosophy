    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Consciousness\n1.4 Consciousness\n1.4.1 Does consciousness play a justifying role?\n\nAn uncontroversial theory of perceptual experiences holds that they\nall have a conscious character\u2014for any experience \\(e\\)\nthere is something it is like to have \\(e\\).\nFurther, part of what it is for something to be an\nexperience is for it to have a conscious character. There is much\ndebate about how to explain the nature of perceptual consciousness,\nbut there is little debate about whether something is an experience\nonly if it has a conscious character.\n\nThere is much more room for debate about the importance of\nconsciousness for the epistemology of perception. One strategy of\nexplaining how experiences justify beliefs focuses on their conscious\ncharacter. We may call it the phenomenal approach.\n\nTo see why this approach is a contender, consider subjects who have\n\u201cblindsight\u201d. They have visual representations of\nwhat\u2019s in their blind field without having conscious visual\nexperience of anything in their blind field (see Weiskrantz 2009 for a\nsurvey, and Phillips and Block 2016 for a debate about whether there\nreally is unconscious perception). Now these subjects are better than\nchance at identifying objects in their blind field, but they have to\nbe prompted to make a guess. For our purposes, imagine a hypothetical\nblindsighted subject who does not need to be prompted to form a belief\nthat there is an \\(X\\) to the left. Now compare that\nsubject with an ordinary sighted subject who forms a belief that there\nis an \\(X\\) to the left on the basis of visual\nexperience. There are various questions here whose answers might\nsupport the phenomenal approach (see Smithies 2012a, 2019: ch. 3 for\nmore).\n\nFirst, is the blindsighted subject completely unjustified in believing\nthat there is an \\(X\\) to the left? If you think the\nanswer to this question is yes, and you\u2019re not a skeptic about\nthe sighted subject, you arguably should be sympathetic to the\nphenomenal approach. What else would explain this difference between\nthem?\n\nSecond, is the blindsighted subject at any rate less justified than\nthe sighted subject in believing that there is an \\(X\\)\nto the left? If you think the answer here is yes, again you arguably\nshould be sympathetic to the phenomenal approach. What else would\nexplain this epistemic difference between them?\n\nIn response, one might deny that the epistemic differences obtain (see\nLyons 2009, also Berger 2020). Even if one accepts that the epistemic\ndifferences obtain, one might still insist that they are equally or\nbetter explained by alternative candidates than consciousness. For\nexample, perhaps the blindsighted subject does not count as seeing the\n\\(X\\), and perhaps the sighted subject is more\njustified than the blindsighted subject simply thanks to seeing the\n\\(X\\) (as an \\(X\\)). Here the\nexplanatory burden would be borne by bearing a perceptual relation to\nthe thing, rather than having an experience with a certain\ncharacter.\n\nHere it might help to compare the sighted subject with a conscious\nsubject for whom things are just the same from the inside, but who\nfails to see any \\(X\\) because she is hallucinating. If\nthe sighted subject and the hallucinating subject are equally\njustified in believing there is an \\(X\\) to the left,\nvisual experience might be a better candidate than seeing to explain\nthe epistemic symmetry between the sighted and the hallucinating\nsubjects.\n\nSuppose the blindsighted subject and sighted subject are equally\njustified\u2014is the phenomenal approach then doomed? Speaking\nloosely, even if the blindsighted subject has the same epistemic\neffect as the sighted subject, it\u2019s not entirely clear that\nthere must be the same cause (or perhaps there is a common unconscious\ncause present even in the sighted subject).\n\nTo support the claim that consciousness doesn\u2019t supply\nperceptual justification, one might look to other real-life cases of\nunconscious visual representation. One sort of case is that of\nunconscious priming. Here you are exposed to a stimulus too quickly\nfor it to register in visual experience, but for all that it still\ndoes affect your behavior. For example, an unconsciously registered\nnumeral might improve your ability to report that a subsequently seen\nnumeral is greater or lower than 5, depending on whether the priming\none is itself greater or lower than 5 (Naccache and Dehaene 2001). Now\nthis sort of case is arguably not one in which unconscious visual\nrepresentations justify. The subjects concerned plausibly do not form\nbeliefs that are good candidates to be justified by their unconscious\nvisual representations. But consider people with visual hemi-neglect,\nwho seem to lack conscious visual experience of their neglected\nfield.\n\nSome neglect patients seem to take in information about the neglected\nstimuli, and to form beliefs about it. For instance, some of them,\nwhen presented with a burning house in their neglected field and a\nnormal house in their normal field, prefer the one that isn\u2019t on\nfire (Marshall and Halligan 1988; Bisiach and Rusconi 1990). Here they\ndo form a belief that is a candidate to be justified by their\nunconscious visual representation. Their belief that the house in\ntheir neglected field isn\u2019t preferable might be justified by the\ninformation they take in, even if the intake is through unconscious\nperception. If this case is one in which the subject is justified, and\njustified to the same degree as in ordinary cases of conscious\nperception, one might then start to wonder whether consciousness must\nplay a role even in ordinary cases of perceptual justification.\nPerhaps it is side-stepped by unconscious visual representations even\nthen.\n1.4.2 What aspect of consciousness plays a justifying role?\n\nIf the conscious character of experiences does play a justifying role,\na further question remains about why it does so. One might hold that\nthere is no further explanation to be provided here. Perhaps the\ncapacity of consciousness to justify is a fundamental fact of\nepistemology. According to another proposal, consciousness justifies\nthanks to being introspectively accessible. On this internalist\nconception of justification, a special kind of access to a source is\nnecessary for the source to provide justification, and consciousness\nstands out for allowing this sort of access (see e.g. Smithies 2012b,\n2019).\n\nHere we will focus on a particular aspect of the conscious character\nof experiences, one highlighted by Pryor (2000) among others. To get a\nfeel for this feature if you are sighted, first look away from this\nsurface and imagine a black circle in front of you. Now look at this\nsurface and have a visual experience of the black circle in front of\nyou constituting the period ending this sentence.\n\nIn the former case, you were not justified in believing that there is\na black circle in front of you. In the present case, you are. One\ncandidate way to explain the epistemic difference is to focus on a\ndifference between what it is like to imagine and what it is like to\nhave a visual experience (see Martin 2002 for more).\n\nThe salient feature of experience here is not easy to pin down. The\nrough idea is that, when you visually experience, as opposed to when\nyou visually imagine, things are presented to you as actually being\nthe case. How this feature of experience is best to be understood is\nopen to debate. For now let us leave open its exact nature and simply\nuse the term \u201cpresentational phenomenology\u201d as a\nplace-holder for whatever it is (for more elaboration see Chudnoff\n2012 or Bengson 2015, and see Teng 2018 for a challenge to privileging\npresentational phenomenology).\n\nEven if presentational phenomenology is epistemically privileged,\nthere remains an important question about its scope. Suppose you see a\ncow through a picket fence. There is arguably some way you\nperceptually \u201cget\u201d that there is an extended cow there.\nFor a dramatic contrast, start by considering Damien Hirst\u2019s\n Some Comfort Gained From the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in Everything,\n that consists of a cow vertically sliced into a series of boxes\narranged like dominos. Now suppose you know you are seeing the Hirst\nsculpture through a picket fence, where the segments align exactly\nwith the gaps in the fence. Here you arguably would not perceptually\n\u201cget\u201d that there is an elongated cow there.\n\nIn the ordinary case of seeing a cow through a picket fence, it is\ndebatable whether presentational phenomenology includes the presence\nof an extended cow, or whether it includes only those regions of the\ncow not occluded by the fence (see Noe 2005 for further discussion).\nIf your presentational phenomenology includes only the non-occluded\nregions, and only presentational phenomenology supplies perceptual\njustification, the rational powers of experience threaten to be\nlimited. You would not have justification to believe that an extended\ncow is present just by taking your experience of the cow through the\nslats at face value. Analogously, if only the facing surface of an\nobject is phenomenally present, you might have justification to\nbelieve only that the facing surface is present by taking your\nexperience at face value. Here we might find ourselves back at the\n\u201cveil of surfaces\u201d discussed in\n section 2.2.\n\nSome might accept this prediction. In his 2018a and 2018b, Chudnoff in\neffect does. He compares seeing an ordinary occluded dog with seeing\nan unfamiliar occluded blob, and claims that our visual experience in\nsuch cases has presentational phenomenology only with respect to what\nis not occluded, and gives us immediate justification for beliefs with\nrespect to only what is not occluded. On his view, our background\ninformation about dogs picks up the slack to enable us to have a\njustified belief about the full shape of the dog, whereas no\nbackground information is available for us to have a justified belief\nabout the full shape of the occluded blob. In response, Helton and\nNanay 2018 in effect argue that Chudnoff\u2019s view threatens to\nlead to skepticism about ordinary beliefs about occluded objects, and\nunderestimates the powers of visual experience with respect to novel\noccluded objects. To avoid potential skeptical problems, some may\nprefer to take a more expansive view of presentational\nphenomenology.\n",
