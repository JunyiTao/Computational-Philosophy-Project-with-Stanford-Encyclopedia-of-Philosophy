    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || The Historical Construction of Race\n3.3  The Historical Construction of Race\n\nThe social constructionist approach can sometimes lend itself to the\nidea that societies can bring races into existence simply by the formal\nuse of the category in, for example, official legal documents. This\nview in turn can give rise to the belief that races can be\ndeconstructed by reversing this process. The historical approach to\nracial identities offers a different, though not entirely distinct\napproach. Racial groups exist within history and are formed by\nhistorical forces, but these include not only top-down machinations of\nstates but also the collective agency of those so designated. It is not\njust state policies that construct identities, but social movements,\nboth progressive and reactionary. Through historical periods and\ncollective group action, the meanings of race can change as well as\ntheir political valence (Glasgow et al. 2019; Omi and Winant 1986; Alcoff\n2015).\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois took a Hegelian approach that understood African\npeoples in the post-slavery diaspora as engaged in a dialectic process\nof self-formation in light of their racialized treatment. Slaves had\nbeen violently dispossessed of their languages, ethnic cultures and\nreligions as a means of domination and control. Yet, rather than simply\nassimilating to the Anglo-European culture of North America, black\npeople even under slavery were creatively producing new forms of\ncultural expression and communal forms of life that gave voice to the\nsensibilities of their unique and shared historical experience (Du Bois\n1903 [1997]). Historical forces had shaped the conditions in which blackness\nbecame a feature of the self, albeit a dynamic and variable one.\n\nSimilarly, in the southern part of the Western hemisphere, theorists\nsuch as Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos and Jos\u00e9 Carlos\nMari\u00e1tegui were articulating specifically racialized forms of\nsocial identity with political implications (Vasconcelos 1925 [1997];\nMari\u00e1tegui 1928 [1993]; Von Vacano 2011). For Vasconcelos, racial\nidentities are the product of both biological and social forces, but\nracial rankings are simply tools of \u201cimperialistic policy\u201d\nto generate self-justification (Vasconcelos 1925 [1997, 33]). Vasconcelos was\nconcerned to defend racial mixing, which was a practice widespread in\nLatin America and also the target of criticism by European\nintellectuals who justified their own superior ranking on the basis of\nclaims to purity and unified cultural essences. Vasconcelos held that\nsuch claims ignore the fact that all races are in a constant process of\ninteraction and mutual influence. Diversification improves humanity, he\nbelieved, and will eventually produce a more unified or cosmic race\nstronger than any \u201cpure\u201d race. Yet, while advocating in\nthis way for mestizahe, or the mixing of races and cultures,\nVasconcelos reproduced a new form of racial ranking in which\n\u201cpure\u201d blacks and Indians were ranked lower than mixed race\npeoples, or mestizos.\n\nIn contrast, Mari\u00e1tegui criticized the way in which mestizo\nand criollo elites defined the \u201cproblem of the Indian\u201d as a\nproblem of resistance to assimilation. As a forerunner of societies\nthat define themselves today as \u201cplurinational,\u201d\nMari\u00e1tegui argued that political systems needed to recognize the\nlegitimacy of Indian identities and land claims. Indigenous groups in\nPeru had distinct ideas and practices about how to communally navigate\nland stewardship, how to practice religion, and how to express\naesthetic values, and these practices had produced flourishing\ncommunities prior to the Conquest. Indian survival was not predicated\non assimilation but on land.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, theorists tended to hold that\nthe Conquest and transatlantic slavery altered and realigned but did\nnot erase prior values, practices, or beliefs (Henry 2000). New group\nidentities carried vestiges of earlier practices and cultural ideas.\nLiberation from colonialism and emancipation from slavery created new\npolitical constituencies who had shared aspirations for new forms of\nsociety in which they could chart their own futures. These new\nconstituencies manifested some continuities with the pre-Conquest,\npre-slavery past but were also dynamic responses to new conditions and\npossibilities. For example, while diverse indigenous groups were\nforcibly realigned by territorial annexations, they responded by\ndeveloping new group identities that included pan-indigenous identity\nwhile maintaining a historical consciousness of their distinct lineage\n(Jimeno 2014; de la Cadena 2015).\n\nThe contrast between political philosophy in Latin American versus\nEurope is instructive here. The project of Latin American political\nphilosophers such Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Simon Bolivar and\nMari\u00e1tegui was never to create ideal political institutions for\nany given collection of abstract individuals, but to create workable\ninstitutions that could overcome the devastations wrought by\ncolonialism, cultural imperialism, and slavery. This required\naddressing group differences and group histories. For\nMari\u00e1tegui, the Indians of Peru deserved land rights not as\nindividuals but as specific historical peoples whose land had been\nstolen. The political philosophy of a nation such as Peru could not\nthen follow liberal theoretical traditions that treated individual\ncitizens as essentially fungible with uniform rights and duties.\n\nThis is what fueled Mart\u00ed\u2019s concern that the\nEurocentric universities of Latin America offered no \u201canalysis of\nelements peculiar to the peoples of America\u201d (Mart\u00ed 1999,\n114). As a result of their European or U.S. based curriculum,\n\u201cthe young go out into the world wearing Yankee or French\nspectacles, hoping to govern a people they do not know\u201d (ibid).\nMarti despised the concept of race, held that racism was a sin against\nhumanity, and sought to undo the racism that the Spaniards\ninstitutionalized in the colonial era (Schutte 2011). But he also held\nthat new societies must come to understand and address the fact that\ndifferent groups had distinct histories with their own \u201cvital and\nindividual characteristics of thought and habit\u2026\u201d\n(Mart\u00ed, 119) Eurocentric curricula are not universal, but\nparticular, and may have only partial relevance outside Europe. Writing\nsome decades later, the philosopher Leopoldo Zea echoed\nMart\u00ed\u2019s warning and argued that philosophical approaches\nneed to address human and cultural specificity (Zea 1986).\n\nIn many post-liberation, post-slavery writings, racial identity\nbegan to signify differently than it had for the colonizers: it came to\nmean group identities and forms of life that had been forged by\nhistorical processes involving not only colonialism but also the forms\nof resistance devised by the colonized. Generic terms like\n\u201cBlack\u201d would change their meanings to signify new group\nformations whose content or unifying elements referred both to the\nenforced diaspora as well as new forms of collectivity and resistance.\nThe generic term \u201cIndian\u201d itself denoted a widely diverse\nset of communities, initially united only in that it was used by\nsettler societies to project negative attributes on all indigenous\npeoples. In this sense the term had elements very similar to other\nracial terms. Yet it began to signify something more substantive as\nwell as more positive: a difference of historical experience, values,\nand practices that cut across many particular differences between\nindigenous groups. There is ongoing debate today about the validity of\nsuch a broad term, but there is agreement that the term\n\u201cIndian\u201d signifies not only what was done to the\npeoples it signifies, but broadly shared forms of religiosity,\ncommunity, and relationality (Teuton 2008; Pratt 2002; Burkhart\n2019).\n",
