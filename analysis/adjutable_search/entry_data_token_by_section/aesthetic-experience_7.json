    "main_text": "Mental aspects of aesthetic experience || Conceptualization\n2.2 Conceptualization\n\nOne traditional line of thought in aesthetic theory takes it that\naesthetic experience of an object excludes conceptual thought about\nwhat kind of thing that object is. This was central to Kant\u2019s\n(1789 [1987]) view; he thought that the imagination and the\nunderstanding could engage in a \u201cfree play\u201d in aesthetic\nexperience precisely because no conceptual binding restricted the way\nan object presented itself to us in this context.\n\nThe same idea has been central to vastly different theories of\naesthetic experience too. After Croce (1902, 1938), Collingwood (1938\n[1958]) denied that an emotion could be conceptualized in the\nexpression essential to aesthetic experience because conceptual\n\u201cdescription generalizes \u2026 Expression, on the contrary,\nindividualizes\u201d (112). The idea that conceptualization is\ngeneralization, and so incompatible with the focus on the\nparticular demanded by aesthetic experience, is an enduring\none (see e.g. Sibley 1974, 1983). Theodor Adorno (1970 [1997]) claimed\nthat artworks offer the promise of escape from worldly\nconceptualization, although he also argued that this promise is\ninevitably broken, given that artworks are themselves aspects of the\nreal world.\n\nEven those who take aesthetic experience to be a mode of cognitive\ncontact with the world often distinguish it from other cognitive modes\nin terms of its incompatibility with conceptualization. The Romantics\n(see Section 1.5.1. above) thought that the \u201cabsolute,\u201d or\nthe total infinite substratum of reality, could be experienced in a\nconcrete individual, but not by conceptualization. Nelson Goodman\n(1968 [1976]) treated aesthetic experience as a matter of\nunderstanding objects that present their subjects in an analog way\n(with what he calls \u201csyntactic density, semantic density, and\nsyntactic repleteness,\u201d p. 252), where this contrasts sharply\nwith the conceptual mode of representation offered by natural\nlanguages.\n\nOn the other hand, various philosophers have argued that\nconceptualization is positively necessary to aesthetic\nexperience.\n\nScruton (1974) took a form of \u201cunasserted\u201d conceptual\nimagination to be central to the \u201cseeing-as\u201d and\n\u201chearing-as\u201d (etc.) of aesthetic experience. In this\nScruton was influenced by Wollheim, but Wollheim\u2019s (1968 [1980],\n1990, 1994) reliance on conceptualization in aesthetic experience\nplausibly runs deeper than Scruton\u2019s. To have an aesthetic\nexperience of an artwork in particular is, in part, to\ninterpret it, and to interpret an artwork is in part to\nattribute certain intentions concerning that very experience to the\nartist who made it (1987, p. 8; for a famous criticism of this claim,\nsee Wimsatt and Beardsley, 1946). This attribution of intentions\nsurely involves conceptualization, insofar as intention itself\ndoes.\n\nA similar interpenetration of thought and experience undergirds\nWalton\u2019s (1970) famous argument that an aesthetic experience of\nan artwork necessarily involves assigning that work to a category. The\nexpressive chaos of Picasso\u2019s Guernica would not seem\nchaotic at all if it belonged to a genre of \u201cGuernicas\u201d\nwhich tended to be much more brashly colored and three-dimensional; in\nthat context, it would seem flat, muted, even gentle. In a rare entry\ninto aesthetics, p. F. Strawson (1966) once argued that aesthetic\nappraisal\u2014itself plausibly a part of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014must involve conceptualization of a work of art\nas such, in order to focus attention on just those features\nrelevant to such appraisal (for critical discussion, see Sibley 1974\nand Wollheim 1980).\n",
