    "main_text": "Protagoras\u2019 Political Thought || Protagoras on justice and law\n5.4 Protagoras on democracy\n\nFrom an historical-political perspective it is worth noticing the\nparallel between Protagoras\u2019 thesis and Athenian democracy.\nAwareness of the importance of nomos was of course widely\nspread in the Greek world from an early time. It is not a coincidence,\ntherefore, that in the myth the mention of Zeus\u2019 law clearly\nalludes to some very famous Hesiodic verses (Hesiod is also explicitly\nmentioned among many other authoritative figures earlier in the\ndialogue, at 316d\u2013317c):\n\n\nPerses, lay these things in your heart\n\nAnd give heed to Justice, and put violence entirely out of your mind.\n\nThis is the law (nomon) that Cronus\u2019 son [i.e., Zeus]\nhas established for human beings:\n\nThat fish and beasts and winged birds\n\neat one another, since Justice is not among them;\n\nbut to human beings he has given Justice, which is the best by far.\n(Hesiod, Works and Days 274\u2013280)\n\n\nThis quotation is not a display of erudition, but aims to indicate the\nreal subtext of the myth, with Protagoras adopting a subtle strategy\nof appropriation of the poet. Hesiod\u2019s basic idea is that\nnomos (law, justice, politics) is what distinguishes humans\nfrom animals, insofar as it allows them to transcend the world of\nbrute force and violence by creating an order based on shared values.\nAs a matter of fact, as we have seen, this is also Protagoras\u2019\nthesis: what is typical of human beings is the common possession of\njustice, which is to say their political and social capacity.\nProtagoras\u2019 myth, by alluding to Hesiod\u2019s story,\nemphasises such a convergence. But also in this case the divergences\nare as interesting than the affinities. Borrowings are never neutral,\nand the appropriation is also a transformation. In Hesiod, Justice is\ndivine, a deity, the daughter of Zeus, who intervened when he saw that\nmen fail to respect her (Works and Days 257, 265;\nTheogony 901\u2013903). All mythological imagery aside, this\nmeans the belief in the existence of absolute justice; human justice\nis not independent of this order of divine values, but must rather\nconform to it. The situation radically changes with Protagoras whose\ninnovation consists in his emphasis on the human rather than divine.\nThere is no place for divinity; justice is something human; it is\ndetermined by laws, which can vary\u2014it is not what brings us\nclose to the gods but what makes it possible to fulfil our natural\npotential. This emphasis on law as the result of collective human\ndecisions was particularly well-suited to one of the key motives of\nthe Athenian democratic propaganda, which insists on the idea of\ndemocracy as everyone\u2019s government, as the government of the\npeople as a whole and not just of a part of it (see Thucydides\nHistory VI 39: \u201cdemocracy (demos) is the name\nfor all, oligarchy for only a part\u201d). Secondly, also in the\nAthenian political discourse the emphasis on the community is used to\njustify another cornerstone of the democratic ideology, arguably the\nmost important one, namely the very close bond that must hold together\nthe city\u2019s interest and the individual\u2019s, where the former\nis the precondition for the latter (for some interesting parallels,\nsee Pericles in Thucydides History, II 40, 2 and 60,\n2\u20134 and Herodotus Histories V 78). Thirdly, the\nparallel between the vindication of opinions implied by MM and another\nkey motive of Athenian democracy, isegoria (everyone\u2019s\nright to express their idea in the assembly), need to be taken into\naccount: the right for everyone to express their ideas seems to rely\non the assumption that all opinions are legitimate, as indeed\nProtagoras argued. All in all, without having to posit that\nProtagoras\u2019 doctrines were developed precisely for this purpose,\nit is possible to note that they were far from irrelevant or foreign\nto the new political phase that Athens was experiencing.\nProtagoras\u2019 views provide a theoretical basis for participatory\ndemocracy (Kerferd 1981a: 144; particularly important is Farrar\n1988). Protagoras emerges as a democratic political thinker: he is a\npolitical thinker because he has shown that the social (or\npolitical\u2014from polis) dimension is fundamental; he is\ndemocratic insofar as he suggests that political action is a\ncollective and shared kind of action. It is hardly a coincidence that\nthe main ancient reflections on democracy have often been set in\nrelation to his ideas (see, e.g., Herodotus Histories III\n80\u201382 or Dissoi logoi 7; Anonymous of Iamblichus, 90, 7\nDK).\n\nIndeed, presenting democracy, the form of government of the new times,\nas the heir and culmination of the Greek political tradition is\ncertainly a brilliant outcome which legitimises Protagoras\u2019\naspirations and ambitions. By claiming a direct link with the great\npoets and thinkers of the past but also by appropriating and\ntransforming their tenets, Protagoras can present himself as an heir\nto Greek paideia, as one of the great masters, or, rather, as\nthe great master, the only one who is capable of imparting a\nteaching that drew upon tradition but also meet the needs of the new\ntimes. In such a way, Protagoras could reinforce his claim to be the\nnew teacher, the educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the\nneeds of the new world of the polis. Plato\u2019s goal, in the\nProtagoras and in the Theaetetus, was to show that this\nwas not correct\u2014if in the myth the sophist was implicitly\nidentifying himself to Zeus, at the end he will turn out as\nEpimetheus. But for the time being, until this has been proven, one\ncan well understand the enthusiasm of the Athenians when they heard\nthat the great thinker had arrived in Athens (Protagoras\n310b\u2013e).\n",
