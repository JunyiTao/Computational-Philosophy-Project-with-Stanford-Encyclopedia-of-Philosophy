    "main_text": "Apology\n11. Apology\n\nUnique among Plato\u2019s works, this is a formal speech. The aim of\nforensic rhetoric by a defendant is normally acquittal, but\nSocrates\u2019 aim here seems to be to bring out the truth of his\nlife, regardless of how it affects the jury. Still, although he begins\nwith the orator\u2019s usual disclaimer of speech-craft, Socrates\nspeaks artfully enough that the result could be used to illustrate a\ntextbook of rhetorical technique.\n\nThe official charge is that he corrupted the young men of Athens, and\nthat he introduced new gods; this implies the old charge from\nAristophanes Clouds, that Socrates replaced the gods with\nnaturalistic explanations, and that he corrupted the youth by teaching\nrhetoric, \u201cto make the worse argument win.\u201d Socrates\ndenies having taught anything, and disclaims any interest in natural\nscience or the teaching of rhetoric.\n\nHow, then, did he come under such suspicion? Socrates claims it is\nbecause he led a life that seemed strange to his compatriots, in\nfulfillment of his mission. Socrates claims to have been given this\nmission by the god, evidently Apollo, and he identifies this mission\nwith his gadfly role of shaming people into sharing his quest for\nvirtue. He may have developed elenchus (which derives from a word for\nshame) for this purpose, but he has another purpose for elenchus as\nwell. Once the oracle declared that no one was wiser than he, Socrates\nhad set out to test the oracle\u2019s meaning by examining all those\nwho claimed to be wise. Finding none who could pass the test, he\nconcluded that the meaning of the oracle was probably this: that true\nwisdom belongs to the god, and no human being can be wiser than a\nperson who is aware, as Socrates says he is, of his own inadequacy in\nwisdom. In keeping with this result, Socrates is cautious in his\nphilosophical claims in the Apology. On the subject of life\nafter death, he presents himself as agnostic, although other texts\nshow him to have been committed to the immortality of the soul.\n\nSome scholars have argued that Socrates\u2019 defense is ironic. On\nthis see Leibowitz 2014.\n",
