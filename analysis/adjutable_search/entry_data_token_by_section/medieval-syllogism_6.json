    "main_text": "William of Ockham\n7. William of Ockham\n\nAround the time William of Ockham (c. 1287\u20131347) wrote his\nCompendium of Logic (Summa logicae), medieval logic\nbegan to change. More emphasis was placed on the theory of\nconsequences than the theory of syllogisms. A theory of consequences\nwas developed by Abelard in the course of his discussion of topical\ninferences and hypothetical syllogisms, and during the thirteenth\ncentury the basic idea was further developed in treatments of the\ntopics, but in the fourteenth century works devoted solely to\nconsequences began to appear (Green-Pedersen 1984). The most famous is\nJohn Buridan\u2019s Treatise on Consequences (Tractatus de\nconsequentiis), though earlier authors such as Walter Burley had\nalso stressed consequences over syllogisms. Burley probably wrote his\nOn the Purity of the Art of Logic (De puritate arte\nlogicae) as a reply to Ockham\u2019s famous Summa. For\nOckham, however, syllogisms are still the most important formal\ninferences, and he devotes most of Book III of the Summa to\nthem (see Normore 1999 for a recent study of Ockham\u2019s logic). \n\nLike Campsall, Ockham has nothing to add to the theory of assertoric\nsyllogisms, which was by then well understood. Let us, however, have a\nlook at the proof method using the expository syllogism that medieval\nlogicians such as Ockham seem to have preferred over Aristotle\u2019s\ncumbersome method of ekthesis. Ockham uses this method\nfrequently, though not as frequently as Buridan later did.\n\nThe method is used to prove the third figure moods. Expository\nsyllogisms are perfect for this because the middle term is the subject\nof both premises in that figure. Darapti, for example, runs as\nfollows:\n\nEvery B is A\nEvery B is C\nSome C is A\n\n\nProofs by expository syllogism are practically self-evident. To prove\nDarapti, one has only to take a particular instantiation of the two\npremises to get:\n\nb is A\nb is C\nOne C is A\n\n\nThe resulting syllogism is an expository syllogism since it has\nsingular terms as subject terms, and so Darapti is proved. This method\nis reminiscent of ekthesis since it involves particular\ninstantiation, though it is not the same method.\n\nAs we have seen, the theory of modal syllogisms was explored in order\nto try to save Aristotle\u2019s theory, and this was still the motive of\nmost logicians in the first half of the fourteenth century. But Ockham\nhimself seems no longer to be interested in this project. His aim\ninstead seems purely systematic, and in his desire to extend his basic\nmethods he manages to bring the theory into a whole new light.\n\nThe most fundamental distinction in modal syllogistic is of course\nthat between composite and divided modal sentences, but divided modal\nsentences are also equivocal according to Ockham. Using ideas\ndeveloped in the theory of supposition, he distinguishes between\ndivided modal sentences with an ampliated subject term and those with\na non-ampliated subject term. Let us look at how Ockham draws the more\nfundamental distinction.\n\nOckham proceeds by dividing modal sentences into sentences with a\ndictum (cum dicto) and those without a\ndictum (sine dicto), dividing modal sentences with a\ndictum into composite and divided senses. He adds that a\nmodal sentence cum dicto taken in the divided sense is always\nequivalent to a modal sentence sine dicto. Ockham expresses\nthe dictum in Latin by an accusative and infinitive\nconstruction. Thus, in the sentence \u2018That every human being is\nan animal is necessary\u2019 (in Latin \u2018Omnem hominem esse\nanimal est necessarium\u2019), \u2018That every human being is\nan animal\u2019 (\u2019Omnem hominem esse animal\u2019) is\nthe dictum of the sentence, which has the mode\n\u2018necessity\u2019 predicated of it. He treats the\ndictum as the subject term of the modal sentence, and the\nmode as the predicate term. It is important to distinguish between the\ndictum and an assertoric sentence. The dictum is\nwhat is asserted in an assertoric sentence. Thus, when the\ndictum is said to be necessary or possible and there is a\nsentence asserting it, such a sentence is necessarily or possibly true\n(Summa logicae II, 9).\n\nAs noted by Campsall, the fact that both the dictum and the\nmode are treated as terms has an important consequence for composite\nmodal sentences. \u2018That every B is A is necessary\u2019 is,\naccording to the reading suggested, not a universal affirmative but a\nsingular affirmative sentence. Ockham adds that one can also call such\nsentences universal or particular, depending on whether the original\nsentence \u2014 that is, the sentence referred to by the\ndictum \u2014 is universal or particular.\n\nThe syllogistic for composite modal sentences is equally\nstraightforward and reduces to a few valid consequences. He explicitly\nmentions the following six (Summa logicae III-1):\n\n(7:1)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are necessary, so is the conclusion\n(7:2)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are possible and\ncompossible, then the conclusion is possible\n(7:3)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are contingent and\ncompossible, then the conclusion is contingent\n(7:4)\nA necessity sentence, whether in the composite or divided sense,\nalways entails the corresponding assertoric sentence\n(7:5)\nAn assertoric sentence entails the corresponding possibility\nsentence\n\n\n(7:4) and (7:5) are used by Ockham to get:\n\n(7:6)\nA necessity sentence entails the corresponding possibility\nsentence\n\n\nIt is consequences such as these that give Ockham a syllogistic for\ncomposite modal sentences. He simply takes the standard assertoric\nsyllogistic and applies these rules to them. Ockham\u2019s syllogistic for\ndivided modal sentences, however, is much less straightforward.\n\nIn Book III-1, Ockham expresses the equivocal nature of divided modal\nsentences as follows:\n\nBut if the possibility proposition is taken in the divided sense or if\none takes a proposition equivalent to it \u2014 such as the\npropositions, \u2018Every human being can be white\u2019, \u2018A\nwhite being can be black\u2019 and the like \u2014 then this\nproposition must be distinguished by virtue of the third mode of\nequivocation, in the way that a subject can supposit for those that\nare or for those that can be, that is, in the way that a subject can\nsupposit for that about which a thing is verified with a word about\nthe present or for that about which a thing is verified with a word\nabout the possible; or else it denotes what it can supposit for, which\nI say to exclude quibbling. If this is said about \u2018Every white\nbeing can be a human being\u2019, then one sense is,\n\u2018Everything that is white can be a human being\u2019, and in\nthis sense it is true as long as nothing is white except a human\nbeing. Another sense is, \u2018Everything that can be white can be a\nhuman being\u2019, and this is false, provided either only a human\nbeing is white or something other than a human being [is white].\n\n\nHere he clearly states that a possibility sentence has two readings,\nnamely:\n\n(7:7)\n(Quantity) what is B can be (quality) A\n(7:8)\n(Quantity) what can be B can be (quality) A\n\n\n(7:8) has generated some scholarly debate as to what Ockham really\nmeant by this reading of divided possibility sentences. Does he mean\nby (7:8) that the subject term is ampliated to stand for possible\nbeings as well as for actual beings? Can a strict nominalist such as\nOckham really accept quantification over possible beings? (For the\ndetails, see Karger 1980, Freddoso 1980, McGrade 1985, Knuuttila 1993:\n139\u201349, and Lagerlund 2000: 107\u2013112.)\n\nOckham also thinks that contingency sentences are equivocal in the\nsame sense as possibility sentences, but not necessity sentences. The\nonly reading he accepts for these sentences is:\n\n(7:10)\n(Quantity) what is B is necessarily (quality) A.\n\n\n(7:10) implies that only actually existing things have necessary\nproperties. It is unclear why he thinks this (see Lagerlund 2000:\n112\u2013114), but it gives his syllogistic an unattractive feature\nthat has awkward consequences. For example, no conversion rules for\ndivided necessity sentences are valid and there are also no valid\nmoods in the second figure.\n\nOckham also discusses syllogisms with mixed composite and divided\nmodal premises. He mentions some very interesting consequences in the\ncourse of this discussion.\n\n(7:11)\nThat every B is A is possible \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(7:12)\nThat some B is A is possible \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(7:13)\nThat this is A is possible \\(\\equiv\\) This is possibly A\n(7:14)\nThat this is A is contingent \\(\\equiv\\) This is contingently A\n(7:15)\nThat this is A is necessary \\(\\equiv\\) This is necessarily A\n\n\nIn (7:11) and (7:12), the subject terms of divided modal sentences\nmust be ampliated for the consequences to hold. It is interesting to\nnote that for categorical sentences with singular subject terms, the\ndistinction between composite and divided senses collapses. His\nexample is \u2018That Socrates is white is possible\u2019 implies\n\u2018Socrates is possibly white\u2019. With the help of these\nconsequences he can prove some additional moods to be valid in the\ndifferent figures.
