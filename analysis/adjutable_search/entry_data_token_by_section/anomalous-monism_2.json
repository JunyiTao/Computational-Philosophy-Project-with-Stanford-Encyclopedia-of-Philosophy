    "main_text": "Premise I: The Interaction Principle || Mental and Physical Events\n2.1 Mental and Physical Events\n\nDavidson restricts the class of mental events with which Anomalous\nMonism is concerned to that of the propositional\nattitudes\u2014states and events with psychological verbs such as\n\u2018believes\u2019, \u2018desires\u2019, \u2018intends\u2019\nand others that subtend \u2018that-\u2019 clauses, which relate\nsubjects to propositional contents such as \u2018it is raining\noutside\u2019. Anomalous Monism thus does not address the status of\nmental events such as pains, tickles and the\nlike\u2014\u2018conscious\u2019 or sentient mental events. It is\nconcerned exclusively with sapient mental events\u2014thoughts with\npropositional content that appear to lack any distinctive\n\u2018feel\u2019.\n\nThough traditional and intuitive, this way of dividing up the domain\nof the mental isn\u2019t without controversy. Generally, Davidson\nexpresses some skepticism about the possibility of formulating a clear\nand general definition of the class of mental phenomena (Davidson\n1970, 211). And he is suspicious about the idea of mental states given\nto, but uninterpreted by, concepts (Davidson 1974a), which is how\nphilosophers have often thought of conscious phenomena. But for\ncurrent purposes the class of propositional attitudes will suffice as\na criterion for the mental. One key reason for so limiting the reach\nof Anomalous Monism, as we shall see\n (4.2),\n is that it is the rational status of the relevant mental\nevents that Davidson usually cites as responsible for mental\nanomalism. Conscious events have traditionally been thought to occur\nin non-rational animals, a position with which Davidson shows some\nsympathy (Davidson 1985a). Such events thus appear to fall outside of\nthe domain of the rational, and thus outside of the purview of\nDavidson\u2019s argument.\n\nDavidson is even less helpful about offering a criterion for the\n\u2018physical\u2019 (Davidson 1970, 211). One half-hearted attempt\ncomes in the statement that\n\n\n[p]hysical theory promises to provide a comprehensive closed system\nguaranteed to yield a standardized, unique description of every\nphysical event couched in a vocabulary amenable to law. (Davidson\n1970, 224) \n\n\nThis is at best a promissory note about some future language of\n\u2018physics\u2019\u2014the \u2018true\u2019 physics\u2014and\nit incorporates a requirement of the causal closure of the physical\ndomain that creates problems for certain aspects of Anomalous Monism\n(see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n It is probably best to take a \u2018physical\u2019 description\nsimply to be one that occurs in the language of a future science that\nis similar to what we call \u2018physics\u2019 today but with none\nof its inadequacies. One important component of such descriptions is\ntheir capacity to figure in strict laws of nature (see\n 3.1).\n While this is non-negotiable for physical terms, it is an open\nquestion for mental terms, and Davidson will be arguing\n (4)\n for a negative answer.\n\nWhen Davidson first argued for Anomalous Monism he subscribed to a\ncausal criterion of event-individuation, according to which two events\n(event-descriptions) are identical (co-refer) if they share all the\nsame causes and effects (Davidson 1969). He much later came to reject\nthat criterion in favor of one according to which events are identical\nif and only if they occupy the same spatiotemporal region (Davidson\n1985b). The difference between these views will not, however, be\nreflected in our discussion. It does not appear to affect either the\nderivation or the essential nature of Anomalous Monism. For our\npurposes, Davidson\u2019s central claims are that what makes an event\nmental (or physical) is that it has a mental (or physical)\ndescription, and the extensionalist thesis that events are concrete\nentities that can be described in many different ways (\u2018the\nflipping of the light switch\u2019, \u2018the illuminating of the\nroom\u2019 and \u2018the alerting of the burglar that someone is\nhome\u2019 can all pick out the same one event in different terms).\n(For controversies concerning extensionalism, see\n 5.2\n and the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism).)\n\nThe interaction principle states that at least some mental events\ncause and are caused by physical events (Davidson 1970, 208). This\nleaves open the possibility of mental events that do not causally\ninteract with physical events. However, given Davidson\u2019s early\nviews about event-individuation (the causal criterion) it is unclear\nthat this possibility can be realized. His later views on\nevent-individuation appear to leave this possibility open, but his\ngeneral claims about the causal individuation of mental contents and\nattitudes (see\n 4.3\n and\n 6.3\n below) also stand in some tension with this possibility. In any case,\nDavidson goes on to say that he in fact believes that all mental\nevents causally interact with physical events (Davidson 1970, 208),\nbut he restricts his argument only to those that actually do. Given\nthe pressures just noted in favor of the inclusive reading of the\ninteraction principle, we shall assume it in what follows.\n\nThe interaction claim itself should be understood as follows: some\nevents that have a mental description or instantiate a mental property\ncause and are caused by events that have a physical description or\ninstantiate a physical property. Formulating the interaction principle\nin this way both clears the way for an extensional reading of the\ncausal relation (events are causally related no matter how they are\ndescribed), and also leaves open the possibility, which Davidson will\nsubsequently argue for, that mental events in particular must have\nsome non-mental description/instantiate some non-mental property. At\nthis stage that possibility is left as an open question, but it is\nimportant to notice that for it to be an open question we need to at\nleast allow for a distinction between events and the ways in which\nthey are picked out in language.\n",
