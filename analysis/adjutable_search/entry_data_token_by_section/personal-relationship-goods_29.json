    "main_text": "Policies and Institutions || General Measures\n6.2 Measures Aimed at Children\n\nChildren have the strongest case for an entitlement to certain\npersonal relational goods, within ongoing caring relationships, on the\ndouble ground that they are being owed the goods for their wellbeing\nqua children and for the sake of the developmental importance\nof the goods. One of the developmental reasons is to enable the future\nadults to secure personal relationship goods for themselves (Brighouse\n& Swift 2014; Brownlee 2016a).\n\nAs in the general case, a variety of state measures can ensure a fair\nprovision of personal relationship goods to children. Most basically\nperhaps, the elimination of child poverty\u2014which, in practice\nwould mean the elimination of poverty in general\u2014is needed in\norder to allow all parents to parent well (Brighouse & Swift\n2014).\n\nFurther, states can and should be held accountable for ensuring that\nchildren have adequate parents or parental figures (Ferracioli 2014).\nThe fair provision of personal relationship goods for children may\nstart with regulating procreation. Lisa Cassidy argues that those\npeople who do not expect to make good parents have a duty to abstain\nfrom having children (Cassidy 2006), and several philosophers argues\nthat people who decide to have children are under a duty to adopt\ninstead of bringing new ones into existence (Friedrich 2013; Collins\n2013; Rulli 2016). Nobody, to the best of my knowledge, argues in\nfavor of enforcing these duties via state policy. A milder,\nand in some conditions possibly justified, approach would be for\nstates to nudge prospective adequate parents to adopt rather than\nprocreate. Another way of curtailing the kind of procreation that\nresults in some children lacking due access to personal relationship\ngoods would be the introduction of parental licenses. Licensing\nprocreators would require those who fail to obtain them to refrain\nfrom procreating. It is however difficult to see what legitimate means\nof enforcing such licenses exist (Engster 2010; De Wispelaere &\nWeinstock 2012).\n\nWhile it is hard to find legitimate ways to regulate\nprocreation\u2014although perhaps we should not stop searching for\nsolutions\u2014the situation is a bit more hopeful with respect to\nregulating in order to ensure better parenting and, more generally,\nbetter child-rearing. On the first count, there is a convincing case\nfor licensing biological parents (LaFollette 2010) although\nimplementation is difficult. But a bundle of second-best policies\ninclude the introducing of parenting classes, perhaps mandatory (Cutas\n& Bortolotti 2010; De Wispelaere & Weinstock 2012) and the\nencouragement of fathers to take up parental leave in order to be\ninvolved in childcare from the start.\n\nBeyond improving parental care, states have also been said to have a\nduty to create robust, state-subsidized and mandatory institutional\ncare to complement parental care, with the aim of containing abuse and\nneglect care and giving more children the opportunity to enjoy\npersonal relationship goods (Gheaus 2011). States could also make sure\nthat all schools put the intrinsic goods of justice on their curricula\n(Macleod 2018), including any such goods that are relational in\nnature\u2014for instance, by adding counseling and guidance functions\nto the academic function of schools. Finally, the parents of a growing\nnumber of children world-wide engage in long-term migration. These\nchildren spend a significant time of their childhoods physically\nseparated from their parents and without good alternative parental\nfigures. One remedial solution would be for states to use some of the\nremittances sent by migrant parents in order to organize counseling\nand emotional support for the children left behind (Gheaus 2013).\n\nSome policies that have been proposed for other reasons may, as a\nside-effect, also ensure that more children enjoy the personal\nrelationship goods they are owed. Such is Arneson\u2019s (2014)\nproposal discussed in the previous subsection; Gina Schouten\u2019s\n(2015) suggestion that states support gender justice by subsidizing\nparental leaves, care breaks for parents and good quality childcare\ninstitutions; and, possibly, Anne Alstott\u2019s (2004) suggestion\nthat states help parents to honor the demanding, non-exit demand of\nparenting through financial support.\n",
