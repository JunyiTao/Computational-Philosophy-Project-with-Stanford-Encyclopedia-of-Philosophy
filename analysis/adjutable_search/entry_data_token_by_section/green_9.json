    "main_text": "Idealist Ethics || Self-Realization and the Common Good\n3.3 Self-Realization and the Common Good\n\nIn particular, Green links self-realization and a common good. He\nbelieves that full self-realization can take place only in a community\nof ends (PE \u00a7\u00a7183\u201384, 190\u201391, 199, 232)\nin which each person cares about others for their own sakes\n(PE \u00a7\u00a7199\u2013200) and aims at a common good\n(PE \u00a7202, 236). But why? At one point, Green suggests\nthat this concern for others, at least for those within one\u2019s\nimmediate circle, is given or natural.\n\n\nNow the self of which a man thus forecasts the fulfilment, is not an\nabstract or empty self. It is a self already affected in the most\nprimitive forms of human life by manifold interests, among which are\ninterests in other persons. These are not merely interests dependent\non other persons for the means to their gratification, but interests\nin the good of those other persons, interests which cannot be\nsatisfied without the consciousness that those other persons are\nsatisfied. The man cannot contemplate himself as in a better state, or\non the way to the best, without contemplating others, not merely as a\nmeans to that better state, but as sharing it with him. (PE\n\u00a7199)\n\n\nGreen might simply be invoking this familiar concern that one has for\none\u2019s intimate associates. If I do care about the welfare of my\nassociates, and these desires survive deliberative endorsement, then,\naccording to Green, I make their welfare part of my own personal good\n(PE \u00a7\u00a791\u201392). But this may make an\nagent\u2019s interest in others dependent on her contingent desires.\nTo explain how the demands of the common good are categorical\nimperatives, we need to explain how pursuit of a common good is an\ningredient in self-realization.\n\nGreen claims that a rational agent\u2019s interest in others is\nrooted in her search for a \u201cpermanent\u201d good (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7223, 229\u201332, 234). Moral personality requires\nimpulse control and the abilities to distinguish myself from my\nappetites and to frame the question what it would be best for\nme\u2014a temporally extended agent\u2014on the whole to do. This\nwill involve endorsing some goals as good and as worth making\nshort-term sacrifices or investments for. This is to value goals and\nprojects in which I am involved that have some degree of permanence.\nGreen seems to think that the right sort of association with others\nextends this permanence in a natural way\u2014indeed, that it\nprovides a kind of counter-balance to mortality or surrogate for\nimmortality.\n\n\nThat determination of an animal organism by a self-conscious\nprinciple, which makes a man and is presupposed by the interest in\npermanent good, carries with it a certain appropriation by the man to\nhimself of the beings with whom he is connected by natural ties, so\nthat they become to him as himself and in providing for himself he\nprovides for them. Projecting himself into the future as a permanent\nsubject of possible well-being or ill-being\u2014and he must so\nproject himself in seeking for a permanent good\u2014he associates\nhis kindred with himself. It is this association that neutralises the\neffect which the anticipation of death must otherwise have on the\ndemand for a permanent good. (PE \u00a7231)\n\n\nSelf-realization involves a kind of quest for intrapersonal\npermanence. In the intrapersonal case, I preserve myself when the\nactions and intentional states of a future self depend in the right\nway on the actions and intentional states of my present and past\nselves. But interpersonal association involves deliberative\nconnections between associates, in which the intentional states and\nactions of each depend on those of the other. This might explain why\nGreen thinks self-realization aims at interpersonal permanence as\nwell. I more fully realize my capacities in association with others,\nand this association gives me reason to treat the good of my\nassociates as part of my own good.\n\nIn linking moral virtue with pursuit of a common good, Green accepts\nAristotle\u2019s claims about the importance of the fine\n(kalon) and the common good to an agent\u2019s own\neudaimonia or happiness (Irwin 1992, 2009:\n\u00a7\u00a71242\u20131244). Though Green sees the Aristotelian roots\nof his own perfectionism, he does not accept Aristotle\u2019s account\nof the scope of the common good. Whereas Aristotle\u2019s\npolitics recognize significant restrictions on the scope of the common\ngood excluding slaves and women (Politics II 4\u20137,\n12\u201313), Green thinks its scope should be universal (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7205\u201317, 249, 253, 271, 285).\n\n\nThe idea of a society of free and law-abiding persons, each his own\nmaster yet each his brother\u2019s keeper, was first definitely\nformed among the Greeks, and its formation was the condition of all\nsubsequent progress in the direction described; but with them \u2026\nit was limited in its application to select groups of men surrounded\nby populations of aliens and slaves. In its universality, as capable\nof application to the whole human race, an attempt has first been made\nto act upon it in modern Christendom. (PE \u00a7271)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s own conception of the common good is universal; full\nself-realization and the securing of a really permanent good occurs\nonly when each person respects the claims made by other members of a\nmaximally inclusive community of ends (PE \u00a7\u00a7214,\n216, 244, 332). In this respect, Green\u2019s belief that eudaimonism\ncan and should support cosmopolitan concern for others is perhaps\ncloser to the Stoic than the Aristotelian conception of the common\ngood (see Brink 2018).\n\nGreen associates this cosmopolitan conception of the common good with\nEnlightenment ethical conceptions, in particular, Kantianism and\nutilitarianism. He regards the philosophical and political influence\nof utilitarian and Kantian conceptions of impartiality as progressive\ninfluences (PE \u00a7\u00a7213\u201314). According to the\nutilitarian conception, everyone should count for one and no one for\nmore than one (PE \u00a7213). According to the Humanity\nformula of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative, one must treat\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in others, always as an end in\nitself and never merely as a means (PE \u00a7214). Though\nGreen thinks both utilitarian and Kantian conceptions of impartiality\nare right to insist on the wide scope of the common good, Green\naccepts the distributed concern with each moral person that he\nassociates with Kant\u2019s Humanity formula of the Categorical\nImperative (PE \u00a7\u00a7215, 217).\n\nGreen thinks that we each have reason to promote this sort of\ncosmopolitan conception of the common good. But he goes further,\nclaiming that the common good involves no conflict between the good of\nthe agent and the good of others (PE \u00a7244).\n\nBecause Green thinks that self-realization aims at the common good, a\nnoncompetitive conception of the common good is a substantive and\ncontroversial commitment. We may wonder if there are any genuinely\nnoncompetitive goods, such that one person can\u2019t enjoy them\nunless all others do. And even if there are genuinely noncompetitive\ngoods, we might doubt that the personal good would be exhausted by\nsuch a common good. If we think of the personal good as that which an\nindividual has reason to want in itself for her own sake, it seems\nplausible that the personal good and the good of others will overlap\nbut not coincide perfectly.\n",
