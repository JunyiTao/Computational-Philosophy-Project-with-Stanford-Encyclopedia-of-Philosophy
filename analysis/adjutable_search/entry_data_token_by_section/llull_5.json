    "main_text": "Life and his philosophical and religious project || Philosophical and political success\n1.5 Philosophical and political success\n\nRamon Llull traveled again to Paris on November 1309. This was a\ndifferent visit, not only due to the increasing acceptance of Llullian\nthought at the University, but also for his involvement in political\nactivities. Clear proof of this situation was the letter of approval\nsigned by professors in the Faculties of Medicine and Theology after\nhearing a lecture on his Art on February 1310. In addition,\nLlull met King Philip IV and was awarded a letter of recommendation by\nthe King. The following year, the chancellor of the University of\nParis certified Llullian doctrine to be \u201cin accordance to the\nCatholic faith\u201d. (Dominguez Reboiras and Gay\u00e1 2008:\n108)\n\nWhen Pope Clement V summoned a General Council in Vienna during the\nsummer of 1311, Llull sent a series of requests that defined his\nreligious and political program. Some of the petitions included were\nthe foundation of language schools, the unification of the military\norders, funds for a new Crusade, questions regarding the clothing of\nthe priests, the eradication of Averroism, and a program to preach\nCatholic faith in synagogues and mosques. Some of these petitions were\nalready part of the topics to be discussed and were addressed during\nthe Council. The most important of his requests was the decision to\nfound and promote Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldean language schools, which\nwas one of the main objectives of the Llullian project. Regarding the\nunification of the military orders, the Council seemed to acknowledge\nLlull\u2019s proposal and used it to discuss the fate of the\nTemplars, a Christian military order which would be formally dissolved\nafter the Council.\n",
