    "main_text": "Introduction: What is Economics? || Contemporary economics and its several schools\n1.2 Contemporary economics and its several schools\n\nContemporary economics is diverse. There are many schools and many\nbranches. Even so-called \u201corthodox\u201d or\n\u201cmainstream\u201d economics has many variants. Some mainstream\neconomics is highly theoretical, though most of it is applied and\nrelies on rudimentary theory. Theoretical and applied work can be\ndistinguished as microeconomics or macroeconomics. There is also a\nthird branch, econometrics which is devoted to the empirical\nestimation, elaboration, and to some extent testing of microeconomic\nand macroeconomic models (but see Summers 1991 and Hoover 1994).\n\nMicroeconomics focuses on relations among individuals (with firms and\nhouseholds frequently counting as honorary individuals and little said\nabout the idiosyncrasies of the demand of particular individuals).\nIndividuals have complete and transitive preferences that govern their\nchoices. Consumers prefer more commodities to fewer and have\n\u201cdiminishing marginal rates of substitution\u201d \u2014 i. e.\nthey will pay less for units of a commodity when they already have\nlots of it than when they have little of it. Firms attempt to maximize\nprofits in the face of diminishing returns: holding fixed all the\ninputs into production except one, output increases when there is more\nof the remaining input, but at a diminishing rate. Economists idealize\nand suppose that in competitive markets, firms and individuals cannot\ninfluence prices, but economists are also interested in strategic\ninteractions, in which the rational choices of separate individuals\nare interdependent. Game theory, which is devoted to the study of\nstrategic interactions, is of growing importance in economics.\nEconomists model the outcome of the profit-maximizing activities of\nfirms and the attempts of consumers optimally to satisfy their\npreferences as an equilibrium in which there is no excess\ndemand on any market. What this means is that anyone who wants to buy\nanything at the going market price is able to do so. There is no\nexcess demand, and unless a good is free, there is no excess\nsupply.\n\nMacroeconomics grapples with the relations among economic aggregates,\nsuch as relations between the money supply and the rate of interest or\nthe rate of growth, focusing especially on problems concerning the\nbusiness cycle and the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on\neconomic outcomes. Many mainstream economists would like to unify\nmacroeconomics and microeconomics, but few economists are satisfied\nwith the attempts that have been made to do so, especially via so\ncalled \u201crepresentative agents\u201d (Kirman 1992, Hoover\n2001a). Macroeconomics is immediately relevant to economic policy and\nhence (and unsurprisingly) subject to much more heated (and\npolitically-charged) controversy than microeconomics or econometrics.\nSchools of macroeconomics include Keynesians (and\n\u201cnew-Keynesians\u201d), monetarists, \u201cnew classical\neconomics\u201d (rational expectations theory \u2014 Begg 1982,\nCarter and Maddock 1984, Hoover 1988, Minford and Peel 1983), and\n\u201creal business cycle\u201d theories (Kydland and Prescott 1991,\n1994; Sent 1998).\n\nBranches of mainstream economics are also devoted to specific\nquestions concerning growth, finance, employment, agriculture,\nhousing, natural resources, international trade, and so forth. Within\northodox economics, there are also many different approaches, such as\nagency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976, Fama 1980), the\nChicago school (Becker 1976), or public choice theory\n(Brennan and Buchanan 1985, Buchanan 1975). These address questions\nconcerning incentives within firms and families and the ways that\ninstitutions guide choices.\n\nAlthough mainstream economics is dominant and demands the most\nattention, there are many other schools. Austrian economists\naccept orthodox views of choices and constraints, but they emphasize\nuncertainty and question whether one should regard outcomes as\nequilibria, and they are skeptical about the value of mathematical\nmodeling (Buchanan and Vanberg 1989, Dolan 1976, Kirzner 1976, Mises\n1949, 1978, 1981, Rothbard 1957, Wiseman 1983, Boettke 2010, Holcombe\n2014, Nell 2014a, 2014b, 2017, Boettke and Coyne 2015, Hagedorn 2015,\nHorwitz 2015, Dekker 2016, Linsbichler 2017 ).\n\nTraditional institutionalist economists question the value of\nabstract general theorizing and emphasize evolutionary concepts\n(Dugger 1979, Wilber and Harrison 1978, Wisman and Rozansky 1991,\nHodgson 2000, 2013, 2016, Hodgson and Knudsen 2010, Delorme 2010,\nRichter 2015). They emphasize the importance of generalizations\nconcerning norms and behavior within particular institutions. Applied\nwork in institutional economics is sometimes very similar to applied\northodox economics. More recent work in economics, which is also\ncalled institutionalist, attempts to explain features of institutions\nby emphasizing the costs of transactions, the inevitable\nincompleteness of contracts, and the problems \u201cprincipals\u201d\nface in monitoring and directing their agents (Coase 1937; Williamson\n1985; M\u00e4ki et al. 1993, North 1990; Brousseau and\nGlachant 2008).\n\nMarxian and socialist economists traditionally articulated\nand developed Karl Marx\u2019s economic theories, but recently many\nsocialist economists have revised traditional Marxian concepts and\nthemes with tools borrowed from orthodox economic theory (Morishima\n1973, Roemer 1981, 1982, Bowles 2012, Piketty 2014, Lebowitz 2015,\nAuerbach 2016, Beckert 2016, Jacobs and Mazzucato 2016).\n\nThere are also socio-economists, who are concerned with the\nnorms that govern choices (Etzioni 1988, 2018),\nbehavioral economists, who study the nitty-gritty\nof choice behavior (Winter 1962, Thaler 1994, Ben Ner and\nPutterman 1998, Kahneman and Tversky 2000, Camerer 2003, Camerer and\nLoewenstein 2003, Camerer et al. 2003, Loewenstein 2008,\nThaler and Sunstein 2008, Saint-Paul 2011, Oliver 2013),\npost-Keynesians, who look to Keynes\u2019s work and especially\nhis emphasis on demand (Dow 1985, Kregel 1976, Harcourt and Kriesler\n2013 Rochon and Rossi 2017), evolutionary economists, who \nemphasize the importance of institutions (Witt\n2008, Hodgson and Knudsen 2010, Vromen 2009, Hodgson 2013, 2016,\nCarsten 2013, Dopfer and Potts 2014, Wilson and Kirman 2016),\nneo-Ricardians, who emphasize relations among economic\nclasses (Sraffa 1960, Pasinetti 1981, Roncaglia 1978),\nand even neuroeconomists, who study neurological concomitants\nof choice behavior (Camerer 2007, Camerer et\nal. 2005, Camerer et al. 2008, Glimcher et al.\n2008, Loewenstein et al. 2008, Rusticinni 2005, 2008,\nGlimcher 2010). Economics is not one homogeneous enterprise.\n",
