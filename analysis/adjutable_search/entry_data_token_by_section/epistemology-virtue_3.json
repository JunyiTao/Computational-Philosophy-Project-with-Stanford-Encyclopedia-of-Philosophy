    "main_text": "Conventional and Alternative\n4. Conventional and Alternative\n\nDisagreements about the nature of virtue are closely connected to\nanother pair of disagreements. These disagreements concern which\nquestions and methods should feature in epistemology.\n\nMany practitioners deploy VE\u2019s resources to address standard\nquestions in standard ways. (Here \u2018standard\u2019 means\n\u2018standard for contemporary Anglophone epistemology\u2019.) They\noffer analyses or definitions of knowledge and justification. They try\nto solve puzzles and problems, such as the Gettier problem and the\nlottery problem. They construct counterexamples. They confront the\nskeptic. This is conventional VE.\n\nOther practitioners address alternative questions or use alternative\nmethods. They shun definitions and tidy analyses. They focus on topics\nother than knowledge and justification, such as deliberation, inquiry,\nunderstanding, wisdom, profiles of individual virtues and vices,\nexaminations of the relations among distinct virtues and vices, and\nthe social, ethical, and political dimensions of cognition involved in\nmisinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and so on. They ignore the\nradical skeptic. They mine literature and drama for inspiration and\nexamples. This is alternative VE.\n\nAn example of conventional VE is Ernest Sosa\u2019s (1991: section\nIV) attempt to define knowledge as true belief held \u201cout of\nintellectual virtue\u201d, or to settle the dispute among\ninternalists and externalists about epistemic justification (Sosa\n2003: ch. 9), providing detailed definitions and carefully trying to\ndisarm counterexamples. Another prime example of conventional VE is\nLinda Zagzebski\u2019s (1996: part III) definition of knowledge and\nattempted resolution of the Gettier problem.\n\nAn example of alternative VE is Robert Roberts and Jay Wood\u2019s\n(2007) view that conventional questions and methods have eviscerated\nepistemology, and that we should instead aim to reform intellectual\nculture by sketching subtle and nuanced pictures (\u201cmaps\u201d)\nof the intellectual virtues, drawing freely on literature, history,\nand scripture. Another example is Jonathan Kvanvig\u2019s (1992)\nargument that VE will flourish only by relinquishing the Cartesian\nepistemological project and instead focusing on the role that virtues\nplay in training and education. Others have argued that the kernel of\ntruth in VE is best developed in an interdisciplinary context drawing\non the methods and findings of the cognitive, social, and life\nsciences (Turri 2015a).\n\nThe foregoing does not imply that VE is a house divided against\nitself. On the contrary, we find a spectrum of conventional and\nalternative approaches rather than a simple dichotomy, and among\nvarious practitioners we often see a \u201clive and let live\u201d\nattitude. Thus while some practitioners of alternative VE counsel a\nradical, wholesale break from conventional questions or methods, most\neither blend conventional and alternative elements (e.g., Zagzebski,\nRiggs, Battaly), or see value in conventional VE (e.g., Baehr 2011).\nConventional practitioners likewise recognize that\n\u201calternative\u201d questions are not only important but as old\nas philosophy itself, such as questions about wisdom and the social\ntransmission of knowledge. The same goes for the\n\u201calternative\u201d methods of consulting literature, as Plato\nlooked to Homer, approaching philosophical questions with scientific\ntools, as Aristotle inquired into the biological and social bases of\ncognition, and referring to scripture, as the Islamic philosophical\ntradition did in relation to the norms of testimony.\n",
