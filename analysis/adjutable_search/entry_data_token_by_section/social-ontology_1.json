    "main_text": "History || Ancient and Early Modern Debates on the Sources of Social Entities\n1.1 Ancient and Early Modern Debates on the Sources of Social Entities\n\nAncient inquiries into the nature of social phenomena introduced\nquestions that remain active today: Which features of the world are\nproducts of humans or society, and which are products of nature? What\ndoes it mean to say that something is a social creation? A central\nconcern of Sophism, a school of Greek philosophy in the fifth century\nBCE, was the contrast between nature (phusis) and custom,\nlaw, habit, or convention (nomos). In particular, they\ndebated the sources of justice, law, and language: are these rooted in\nphusis or in nomos?\n\nAncient philosophers explored the mix between natural and human\ncontributions in the construction of familiar features of the world.\nThey did not, however, theorize much about exactly what\npeople do in order to create the social world. Instead, they wrote of\nagreements, compacts, conventions, habits, laws, customs, and so on,\nwithout paying particular notice to separating these from one another.\nIn the early modern period, theories of these sources broadened\nconsiderably, as did the variety of social phenomena being\ninvestigated. Approaches developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies include:\n\nSocial entities as products of covenants: Hobbes, in\nLeviathan (1651), argues that a stable commonwealth is generated by\ncovenants among all the people in a society. Hobbes\u2019s analysis\nis reflexive: the people who institute the commonwealth are those who\nare members of the commonwealth. Hobbes analyzes covenants in terms of\nagreements, and also provides an analysis of agreement, a crucial part\nof which is to explain what makes agreements binding.\nSocial entities as products of convention: As an\nalternative to \u2018compact\u2019 or \u2018agreement,\u2019 the\nlegal theorist Samuel Pufendorf, in De Officio Hominis et\nCivis (1673), uses\nthe term \u2018convention\u2019 as the basis for law and language.\nHe argues that conventions do not need to be explicitly formed or\nagreed to. Instead, we can have tacit conventions\u2014i.e.,\nconventions that we may not even be aware we have. Hume greatly\nadvances the analysis of convention and of social phenomena in terms\nof it (Hume 1740). He expands the scope of convention to include a\nwide variety of social entities\u2014not only law, property, and\nlanguage, but also money, government, justice, and promises.\nSocial entities as products of God and Nature: Other\nearly modern philosophers root the social world in the\nnatural\u2014both in divine commandment and in human nature. Robert\nFilmer, a seventeenth century monarchist, argues in\nPatriarcha (1680) that the state is a family. This implies, according to\nFilmer, that state authority is no different from the authority of a\nfather over his family. Locke\u2019s Two Treatises on\nGovernment (1689)\nsharply criticize Filmer and provide a competing analysis, though\nLocke, too, sees God and nature as the sources of the state and of\nproperty. Locke rejects Filmer\u2019s comparison of the state with a\nfamily, arguing instead that political authority has its source in the\nnatural rights of each individual created equally.\n Social entities as products of the individual mind:\nLocke\u2019s theory of \u201cnominal essence\u201d is important for\na number of contemporary approaches to social ontology, even though\nLocke does not himself associate nominal essences with the social\nworld in particular. A nominal essence is a definition of a species or\nsort of thing, which people assemble in their minds out of ideas.\nIndividuals generate these definitions when they observe things in the\nworld and classify them according to their apparent similarities.\nNominal essences, in Locke\u2019s approach, are generated\nmentalistically: they are formed from the association of ideas in the\nmind. Moreover, they are generated individualistically: a nominal\nessence defined by any given person is fully defined by that\nperson\u2019s own mental states.\n\n\nIn Locke\u2019s work, we also see the foundations for a new inquiry\nthat blossomed in the eighteenth century\u2014not into the\nsources of social phenomena, but into their\nconstituents or building blocks. (See also sections\n 2.3,\n 3, and\n 4\n for contemporary theories of constituents vs. sources of social\nentities.)\n",
