Modularity and philosophy\n\nInterest in modularity is not confined to cognitive science and the\nphilosophy of mind; it extends well into a number of allied fields. In\nepistemology, modularity has been invoked to defend the legitimacy of\na theory-neutral type of observation, and hence the possibility of\nsome degree of consensus among scientists with divergent theoretical\ncommitments (Fodor, 1984). The ensuing debate on this issue\n(Churchland, 1988; Fodor, 1988; McCauley & Henrich, 2006) holds\nlasting significance for the general philosophy of science,\nparticularly for controversies regarding the status of scientific\nrealism. Relatedly, evidence of the cognitive penetrability of\nperception has given rise to worries about the justification of\nperceptual beliefs (Siegel, 2012; Stokes, 2012). In ethics, evidence\nof this sort has been used to cast doubt on ethical intuitionism as an\naccount of moral epistemology (Cowan, 2014). In philosophy of\nlanguage, modularity has figured in theorizing about linguistic\ncommunication, for example, in relevance theorists\u2019 suggestion\nthat speech interpretation, pragmatic warts and all, is a modular\nprocess (Sperber & Wilson, 2002). It has also been used demarcate\nthe boundary between semantics and pragmatics, and to defend a notably\naustere version of semantic minimalism (Borg, 2004). Though the\nsuccess of these deployments of modularity theory is subject to\ndispute (e.g., see Robbins, 2007, for doubts about the modularity of\nsemantics), their existence testifies to the relevance of the concept\nof modularity to philosophical inquiry in a variety of domains.\n",
