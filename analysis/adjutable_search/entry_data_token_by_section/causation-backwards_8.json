    "main_text": "Paradoxes || The Consistency Paradoxes\n3.2 The Consistency Paradoxes\n\nThe consistency paradoxes arise when you, for instance, try to kill\nyour younger self by a backward causal process but evidently have to\nfail. The reason why you must fail is quite obvious. Your younger self\nbelongs to the past and therefore, since you cannot change the past,\nyou cannot commit retro-suicide. This answer tacitly assumes that\nresurrection is impossible. You may, of course, kill your younger self\nin the past without changing the past if you have come alive again\nlater on. This is not what is paradoxical. What is paradoxical is the\nfact that you are assumed to be able to kill your younger self in the\nsense that you are well-equipped to make these kinds of\nretro-killings, you may even be targeting your younger self, but you\nmust always miss. The same holds, indeed, for all those people who\nstay alive into the present. You cannot retro-kill somebody yesterday\nwho is alive today. There must be certain constraints which prohibit\nyou from making retro-suicide or retro-killing, and these constraints\nmay be very local, changing from case to case, or they may be\nuniversal in nature depending on some physical laws. So, on the one\nhand, the assumption is that it physically possible for you to kill\nsomebody in the past; but, on the other hand, it is physically\nimpossible for you to do what is physically possible. This is the\nparadox.\n\nA way out of the paradox was suggested by David Lewis (1976) who\nargued that the ability of killing somebody should be understood as a\npossibility compossible with the relevant fact. As an opera singer,\nfor example, you are able to sing operas, since you have the physical\ncapacity and training to do so, but because of a temporary loss of\nvoice, you cannot hum a single tune. What you can do relative to one\nset of facts, is something you cannot do relative to another set of\nfacts. This contextual solution explains why you are able to\nretro-kill your younger self, given the fact that your gun is in\nproper working-order, you have a good aim at your target, and no one\nforces you to abstain from taking action. But it also explains why you\nare unable to retro-kill anybody who is alive today because you cannot\nchange the past. The consistency paradox exists only in virtue of an\nequivocation of a context-sensitive \u2018can\u2019, and if we\nnotice that, we see that the paradox vanishes like dew before the\nsun.\n\nSome may reply that we are still talking about different abilities. In\ncontrast to the case in which the opera singer sometimes cannot sing,\nyour attempt to carry out retro-suicide inevitably fails. The opera\nsinger is able to sing operas because he has shown it before and can\ndemonstrate it again, but the attempted retro-killer has not proved\nand can never prove his ability. Therefore you are never in a\nsituation where you can kill your younger self. If we accept this\nobjection, we may reformulate the solution by saying that the\ncontextual solution explains why you should be able to retro-kill your\nyounger self under the appropriate circumstances. But, again, how can\nwe talk about the ability to make retro-suicide relative to certain\nfacts at all, if there are no possible worlds in which you carry out\nyour deed. It seems reasonable to say that you have the ability to do\nsomething if there is a possible world in which you carry out this\naction. This is true of the opera singer. He can sing operas because\nhe does it in a possible world in which he has not lost his voice. But\nyou cannot make retro-suicide because there is no possible world in\nwhich you kill your younger self. You are unable, even in principle,\nto do so.\n\nIn sum, the consistency paradox is no paradox as long as you do not\ninsist on changing the past. You are unable to change the past, and\ntherefore you are unable to retro-kill anybody who is alive when you\ntry to kill them. The paradox seems to arise only because you wrongly\nbelieve that you are able to do something you are unable to do.\n\nNow if there is no paradox on the conceptual level, what then is it\nthat makes retro-suicide physically impossible? It could be either\nlocal facts or global facts. Local facts that could constrain your\naction of retro-killing are many. Your hand was shaking while firing\nyour gun, you got a fly in your eye, you were disturbed by a cat, you\njust fainted, etc. These constraining facts seem reasonable by\nthemselves; they could have happened independently of your overall\ncapacity of killing somebody in the past, but also in the actual\nsituation interact with your ability and turn the action into an\nunsuccessful event. The problem is merely that such an explanation\nlooks suspicious. It is a general fact that we cannot retro-kill\nanybody who is alive after the time the death purportedly took place.\nLikewise it is a general fact, assuming that backward causation (or\ntime travel) is physically possible, that we can retro-kill anybody\nwho is not alive after the time the purported death took place. But\nthe explanation of a general fact requires an appeal to a general fact\nor a law of nature. Thus a reference to a singular contingent fact to\nexplain why you never succeed in killing your younger self seems not\nto fulfil the requirement of being an explanation.\n\nThe problem may be better understood in following way: each time you\ntry to retro-kill somebody who is not alive after the time the\npurported effect of killing took place, your assassination may still\nfail because of your hand was shaking, etc. Such particular facts\nexplain why you actually missed the target which you in principle were\nable to hit. But to say that you are in principle able to perform\nretro-killing means that there are laws of nature that normally allow\nyou to perform such an action in the appropriate circumstances.\nSimilarly, each time you try to retro-kill somebody who is alive after\nthe purported death took place, you may fail for one reason or\nanother. But you must always fail to retro-kill somebody who is alive\nafter you did your action, i.e., you are in principle unable to\nretro-kill such a person. In those cases it is physically impossible\nfor you to kill, say, your younger self. It seems, therefore, that\nthere should be some laws of nature, working on either a local level\nor a global level, which violate such an action and makes it\nphysically impossible.\n\nA possible solution may be found in a recent result which shows that\nthe most basic features of quantum mechanics may ensure that we could\nnever alter the past, even if it should be possible to interact with\nthe past. The two physicists, Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil (2005\nin\n Other Internet Resources),\n imagine some form of quantum mechanical feedback by introducing\nfigurative beam splitters which are unitary, i.e., the splitters allow\nthe feedback loop to be reversed because they have the same number of\nentry ports and exit ports. From quantum mechanics we know that an\nobject may behave like a wave and that some unitary operator describes\nthe propagation of a physical system. The system is represented by a\nwave function, also referred to as a path, and the time evolution of\nthe system is calculated as a sum over all possible paths from the\ninitial state to the final state. This calculation is usually\nrestricted to the forward direction of time. Now, if we think of some\nof the paths as unfolding backwards in time, Greenberger and Svozil\nare able to prove that either the forward and the backward component\npaths of the loop cancel out, or that the propagator, which\nestablishes the feedback in time, \u201cwipes out the alternative\npossible futures, thus guaranteeing the future that has already\nhappened\u201d. Thus, if you could aim at something in the past, the\nlaws of nature prohibit you to act in ways that are in conflict with\nwhat makes the future what it is (what it already turned out to be).\nThe authors\u2019 conclusion is that if you go back in time or effect\n\u201cthe past quantum mechanically, you would only see those\nalternatives consistent with the world you left behind you\u201d.\n",
