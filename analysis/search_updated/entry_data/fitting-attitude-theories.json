    "preamble": "\n\nAt the most general level, fitting-attitude theories of value (FA\ntheories) seek to explain various kinds of evaluative facts (e.g.,\nfacts about what\u2019s good, admirable, or delightful) by appeal to\nother normative facts about certain types of human responses. FA\ntheories can differ according to (i) the kinds of evaluative facts\nthey aspire to explain, (ii) the kinds of normative facts about human\nresponses in terms of which they explain the evaluative facts, and\n(iii) the types of responses to which they appeal in their\nexplanations. For example, an FA theorist might propose to explain\nevaluative facts about who\u2019s admirable in terms of\nnormative facts about the fittingness of admiration:\nthey might hold that whenever someone is admirable, that\u2019s\nfully\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting for anyone to admire that\nperson. And they might offer parallel explanations, in terms of the\nfittingness of various other types of response, for a range of other\nevaluative facts, such as facts about who\u2019s lovable,\nblameworthy, despicable, delightful, etc.\n\nExplanations like these are the bread and butter of FA theories. It\nseems platitudinous that someone is admirable just in case\nthey\u2019re fitting to admire, lovable just in case they\u2019re\nfitting to love, blameworthy just in case they\u2019re fitting to\nblame, and so on. What makes these claims of equivalence and their kin\nso plausible is that the evaluative properties they reference each\nseem clearly connected to a human response of a certain kind where the\nrelevant connection seems normative rather than merely descriptive.\nBeing lovable, for instance, isn\u2019t merely a matter of being\nsomeone whom one does or could love; instead,\nit\u2019s a matter of being someone whom it\u2019s fitting\nto love or who merits this attitude. And the same goes for\nmany other specific evaluative properties, including but not limited\nto those mentioned above (Brandt 1946; Schroeder 2010; Way 2012;\nHoward 2018). FA theories offer a natural account of these\nequivalences. For example, the FA theorist can say that what explains\nthe equivalence of being lovable with being\nfitting to love is that facts involving the former property\nare always grounded in, or obtain in virtue of, facts involving the\nlatter.\n\nMany FA theorists aspire to explain not only various specific\nevaluative properties, such as being lovable or delightful, but also\ngeneric value, i.e., the property of being simply good, or valuable\nsimpliciter. Assuming that being valuable\nsimpliciter is identical to being desirable, an FA theory is\nstraightforward: a thing\u2019s being valuable simpliciter,\nor desirable, could be explained in terms of its being fit to\ndesire. Alternatively, if being valuable isn\u2019t (always) a\nmatter of being desirable, then FA theorists might instead explain\nfacts about what\u2019s valuable in terms of facts about what\u2019s\nfitting to value, where this attitude of\n\u2018valuing\u2019 might consist in various pro-responses,\nincluding, inter alia, being glad that, respecting, taking\npleasure in, and protecting.\n\nFA theories have many advantages. For example, they seem to constitute\nan attractive middle ground between \u201cprimitivism\u201d about\nevaluative facts\u2014the view that such facts are fundamental or\ninexplicable in other terms\u2014and\n\u201csubjectivism\u201d\u2014the view that evaluative facts are\nfully explicable in terms of non-normative, naturalistic facts about\nhuman responses (McHugh and Way 2016). Relatedly, FA theories of value\nsimpliciter purport to \u201cdemystify\u201d facts\ninvolving this property (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). And FA theories more generally\nstand to provide unifying explanations of the varieties of value\n(Schroeder 2010; Rowland 2019) and to explain the structure of, and\nvarious necessary connections within, certain parts of the normative\nand evaluative domain (Way 2013). But FA theories also face a number\nof outstanding issues, including concerns about circularity and\npotential counterexamples. This entry clarifies the nature of FA\ntheories of value, highlights some important choice points for\nproponents of these theories, and surveys and catalogues the main\nadvantages of the theories and the most pressing, outstanding issues\nthat they face today.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points\n1.1 Metaphysical, Conceptual, or Semantic?\n\nEarly proponents of FA theory were sometimes unclear about whether\ntheir intent was to elucidate the natures of evaluative concepts,\nterms, or properties (e.g., Brentano 1889/2009; Broad 1930; Ewing\n1939, 1947). In the last decade, however, FA theorists have tended to\ntheorize mostly in a metaphysical mode, seeking to account for various\nevaluative properties and facts (McHugh and Way 2016; Howard 2019;\nRowland 2019). This entry follows the current trend and characterizes\nFA theories as metaphysical theses. That being said, for many of the\nnecessary equivalences between specific evaluative and normative\nproperties that certain FA theories entail, their semantic and\nconceptual counterparts plausibly hold with the corresponding kind of\nnecessity. For example, one might reasonably claim that it\u2019s\ntrue in virtue of the meanings of the constituent terms, and so\nanalytic, that someone is admirable just in case they\u2019re fitting\nto admire (Brandt 1946; Kjellmer 1986). And some have recently argued\nthat it\u2019s also true of conceptual necessity, i.e., in virtue of\nthe identity of the concepts, that something is generically valuable,\nor valuable simpliciter, if and only if it\u2019s fitting to\nvalue, or \u201cworth valuing\u201d (Svavarsd\u00f3ttir\n2014).\n\nMany contemporary FA theorists, then, take their FA theories to\nprovide metaphysical accounts of evaluative facts and properties. But\nthere are various ways to understand what a metaphysical account of a\nproperty is. Sometimes such accounts are said to reveal the\nessences of the properties they aim to explain (Fine 1994),\nother times to assert property identities (Jackson 1998), and\nstill other times to specify grounds (Rosen 2015b; Berker\n2018). Common to many contemporary FA theorists, however, is the claim\nthat their metaphysical accounts of evaluative properties in terms of\nnormative properties of human responses entail that facts involving\nthe latter are explanatorily prior to facts\ninvolving the former, such that the former facts are always grounded\nin the latter. This is important for several reasons. First, it\nreveals a core commitment of many contemporary FA theories, viz., that\nthe evaluative facts they seek to explain obtain in virtue of\nnormative facts about human responses, rather than the other way\naround. An FA theory of facts about what\u2019s fearsome,\nfor instance, would entail that whenever something is fearsome,\nthat\u2019s because it\u2019s fitting to fear. Second, this\nexplanatory commitment would seem to rule out understanding FA\ntheories as stating property identities, given the irreflexivity of\nthe grounding relation (see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n\nSome claim that the order of explanatory priority posited by FA\ntheories conflicts with commonsense (for discussion, see Stratton-Lake\nand Hooker 2006; Jacobson 2011): if something is fitting to value, for\ninstance, isn\u2019t that precisely because it\u2019s valuable? In\nother words, doesn\u2019t the fittingness of valuing a valuable thing\nderive from the value of that thing rather than the reverse? And\nindeed, isn\u2019t the value of valuable things, at least in\nprinciple, independent of any actual or possible human responses to\nthose things? Such concerns are discussed further in sections 2.1 and\n3.2.\n1.2 FA Theory, Primitivism, and Subjectivism\n\nThe explanatory element of FA theories also distinguishes these\ntheories from \u201cprimitivism\u201d about their explananda.\nWhereas an FA theory of an evaluative property seeks to explain facts\ninvolving that property by appeal to normative facts about human\nresponses, primitivism about the property holds that facts involving\nit are explanatorily basic or fundamental. A paradigmatic proponent of\nprimitivism is G.E. Moore (1903), who held this view about the\nproperty of being (intrinsically) good, or valuable\nsimpliciter. For Moore, something that\u2019s good\nsimpliciter just is good; its goodness can\u2019t be\nexplained in other terms, and so, a fortiori, can\u2019t be\nexplained in the way FA theorists propose. Notably, Moorean\nprimitivism about good is in principle compatible with FA theories of\nvarious other evaluative properties. For example, one might favor an\nFA theory of being pitiful, but reject such a theory of being\ngood (or vice versa). And more generally, FA theorists might be\nselective, for various reasons, about the evaluative properties they\nseek to explain. Possible reasons for such selectivity are discussed\nin section 3.\n\nFA theories of evaluative properties can also be distinguished from\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d theories of those properties, which seek to\nexplain evaluative properties entirely in terms of human responses\nthat meet certain non-normative criteria (e.g., Lewis 1989). For\nexample, a subjectivist might hold that whenever someone is admirable,\nthat\u2019s because that person would be admired by anyone who knew\nall the facts, reflected adequately on them, etc. FA theories, in\ncontrast, hold that what makes someone admirable is that admiring them\nmeets some normative condition. What this condition is,\nprecisely, is a matter of intramural debate (see section 1.3). If the\ncondition in question can ultimately be explained in naturalistic\nterms, then FA theories may also turn out to be subjectivist theories\n(McHugh and Way 2022a). For example, if an FA theorist explains facts\nabout what\u2019s good in terms of facts about what\u2019s rational\nto value, but then explains the latter normative facts in naturalistic\nterms, then their FA theory is subjectivist (Smith 1994). However, FA\ntheories needn\u2019t be subjectivist: instead, they might\ndeny that the normative facts in terms of which they explain certain\nevaluative facts can themselves be explained in naturalistic\nterms.\n1.3 Which Normative Property?\n\nSo far, this entry has used the word \u2018fittingness\u2019 to pick\nout the normative property that FA theories appeal to in their\nexplanations of evaluative facts. The fittingness relation can be\nglossed as the relation in which a response stands to its object when\nthe object merits, or is worthy of, that response. Thus to say that\nsomething is a fitting object of admiration is to say that it merits\nadmiration, or is worthy of this attitude. Many FA theorists have held\nnot only that fittingness is the right normative relation to appeal to\nin explaining evaluative facts, but also that fittingness is\nexplanatorily fundamental relative to the rest of the normative domain\nsuch that all other normative facts can be explained in terms\nof it (Broad 1930; Ewing 1939, 1947; Chappell 2012; McHugh and Way\n2016; Howard 2019). But FA theorists needn\u2019t be committed to\neither of these claims. For instance, FA theorists might agree that\nevaluative facts should be explained in terms of facts about fitting\nresponses, but reject that fittingness is explanatorily fundamental\nrelative to the rest of the normative domain. Alternatively, they\nmight deny that fittingness is the right normative property to appeal\nto in explaining evaluative facts and opt instead to explain\nevaluative facts by appeal to facts involving a distinct normative\nproperty of responses. Other candidates for the normative property in\nquestion include a response\u2019s being such that one\n\u201cought\u201d to have it (Sidgwick 1874), its being\n\u201ccorrect\u201d (Brentano 1889/2009), \u201cjustified\u201d\n(Ewing 1959), \u201crational\u201d (Brandt 1979; Anderson 1993;\nSmith 1994), \u201crequired\u201d (Chisholm 1986; Lemos 1994),\n\u201cwarranted\u201d (Gibbard 1990), or its being such that\nthere\u2019s (some, sufficient, or decisive) \u201creason\u201d for\none to have it (Scanlon 1998; Schroeder 2010; Rowland 2019). The\ndebate among FA theorists concerning which normative property to\nappeal to in their theories continues today. Presently, the two most\npopular options are fittingness and reasons. For example, an FA\ntheorist who favors the latter option might claim that whenever\nsomething is valuable, that\u2019s fully\u00a0because there are\nreasons for anyone to value it (see section 1.5). Some costs and\nbenefits associated with the FA theorist\u2019s selection of either\nof these currently popular options are discussed in sections 2 and\n3.\n1.4 Fitting for Whom?\n\nFA theories explain evaluative properties in terms of normative facts\nabout responses that are somehow called for by things that have those\nproperties. But who is to have the responses in question?\nThis is undertheorized, but the answer seems to be: it depends. In\nparticular, the answer seems to depend on the nature of the evaluative\nproperty that an FA theory seeks to explain. If the evaluative\nproperty is \u201cagent-neutral\u201d, then everyone, or just\nanyone, is to have the response in terms of which FA theories aim to\nexplain the relevant property; if the property is\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d, then at least someone, but not just\nanyone, is to have the response. Whether an evaluative property is\nneutral or relative can be a matter of debate, but consider\nawesomeness as a plausible example of the former and\nshamefulness as an example of the latter. The awesome calls\nfor everyone, or just anyone, to be in awe of it, but the same\nisn\u2019t so for shamefulness: not just anyone is to be ashamed of a\nshameful act; instead, a shameful act calls for shame only on the part\nof the person who performed it (or perhaps also on the part of those\nwho are somehow closely\n related).[1]\n\nA further, related question is whether the normative property of\nresponses that FA theories appeal to is (or should be)\nobjective, such that all facts are in principle relevant to\nwhether it obtains, or perspectival, such that only\nepistemically accessible or possessed facts are relevant. Here, too,\nit seems the FA theorist should say that it depends on the nature of\nthe evaluative property that an FA theory aims to explain. For\ninstance, facts about whether someone is blameworthy\ndon\u2019t seem to depend on anyone\u2019s epistemic position, so\nsomeone could be blameworthy without anyone knowing it. FA theorists\nshould therefore say that such facts are to be explained by appeal to\nan objective normative property of responses, i.e., a property the\nobtaining of which can be affected by facts unknown to the subject. In\ncontrast, since facts about the curiousness of a question or\nthe credibility of a proposition can seem to depend on a\nsubject\u2019s perspective, FA theorists should say that such facts\nare to be explained by appeal to a normative property that\u2019s\nsimilarly perspective dependent (Way 2020)\u2014for example,\nsubjective reasons (Fogal and Worsnip 2021) or perhaps\nwarrant (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000a). This is a further\nway in which an evaluative property might be agent-relative, as\nopposed to agent-neutral: if it\u2019s perspectival, as opposed to\nobjective. To be clear: this doesn\u2019t mean that FA theories are\nnecessarily disunified, appealing to different normative properties\ndepending on their explanandum. Instead, FA theorists can seek to\nexplain whatever objective normative property they appeal to in terms\nof its perspectival counterpart or vice versa, and claim that\nevaluative properties can ultimately be explained by appeal to\nwhichever of these is more fundamental. For example, an FA theorist\nmight appeal to both objective and subjective reasons to explain the\nfull range of evaluative properties they aim to explain, but then\nexplain subjective reasons in terms of objective ones, and thus\nultimately appeal only to normative facts of a single kind in\nexplaining the evaluative facts.\n1.5 Buck Passing\n\nSome suggest that FA theories date as far back as Kant (1785 [1996])\n(see, e.g., Suikkanen 2009). More commonly, the progenitors of FA\ntheory are taken to be Sidgwick (1874) and Brentano (1889/2009).\nAlthough many have discussed and defended FA theories in the meantime\n(for a nice potted history, see Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004) it\u2019s relatively\nuncontroversial that T.M. Scanlon (1998) is largely responsible for\nthe contemporary revival of interest in FA theory (Jacobson 2011).\nAccording to Scanlon\u2019s \u201cbuck-passing\u201d account of\nvalue, \u201cto call something valuable is to say that it has other\nproperties that provide reasons for behaving in certain ways with\nregard to it\u201d (96). There are several things to note about\nScanlon\u2019s account. First, it purports to provide a theory\nspecifically of being valuable simpliciter. Scanlon\ndoesn\u2019t comment on whether he takes the form of his account to\ngeneralize to apply to more specific evaluative properties such as\nbeing lovable or delightful, though it\u2019s easy to see how it\nmight. For example, we might claim that to call something delightful\nis to say that it has other properties that provide reasons for being\ndelighted by it. Second, Scanlon isn\u2019t very specific about\nhow we have reason to behave with regard to valuable things,\ni.e., about the specific human responses in terms of which he aims to\nexplain facts about value simpliciter. This seems\nintentional. Scanlon suggests that \u201cto claim that something is\nvaluable (or that it is \u2018of value\u2019) is to claim that\nothers also have reason to value it, as you do\u201d (95), but holds\nthat \u201cvaluing\u201d might consist variously in a range of\npro-responses, where the particular kind of pro-response to a valuable\nthing that we have reasons to have depends on, and so varies according\nto, the kind of valuable thing at issue. For example, on\nScanlon\u2019s view, the pro-response(s) that we have reasons to have\ntoward a valuable piece of music can differ from the pro-response that\nwe have reasons to have toward a valuable friendship. And it can be\nmatter of substantive normative dispute, he suggests, which\npro-response we have reasons to have toward each. Thus, Scanlon\nwrites: \u201cunderstanding the value of something often involves not\nmerely knowing that it is valuable or how valuable it is, but also how\nit is to be valued\u201d (100). (For a possible difficulty with this\npart of Scanlon\u2019s view, see section 3.4.)\n\nThe final thing to note about Scanlon\u2019s account is its\ncommitment to the claim that the property of being valuable\ndoesn\u2019t itself provide a reason to value the things that have\nit. Rather, Scanlon claims, being valuable is the \u201cpurely\nformal, higher-order\u201d property of having other properties that\nprovide reasons for a pro-response. This is the feature of\nScanlon\u2019s view that makes it a \u201cbuck-passing\u201d\naccount: the account passes the normative buck from the property of\nbeing valuable to lower-order properties of a thing that provide\nreasons to respond to it favorably, where these lower-order properties\ncorrespond to the value-making features of the valuable thing in\nquestion. This feature of Scanlon\u2019s account has been called its\n\u201cnegative thesis\u201d (Schroeder 2009). This is in contrast to\nits \u201cpositive thesis\u201d: that whenever something is\nvaluable, that\u2019s fully\u00a0because there are reasons to have a\npro-response to it. The positive thesis is what makes Scanlon\u2019s\ntheory an FA theory: it claims that certain evaluative\nfacts\u2014facts about value simpliciter\u2014are always\ngrounded in normative facts about certain human responses, viz., facts\nto the effect that the relevant responses are favored by reasons. As\nseveral authors have pointed out, however, Scanlon\u2019s negative\nthesis isn\u2019t entailed by the positive one and is otherwise\ninessential to FA theory (see esp. Schroeder 2009). The costs and\nbenefits of the negative thesis are still being debated today (for\nsome advantages, see Suikkanen 2009; for some costs, see Schroeder\n2009 and Johnson King 2019). Perhaps the most promising, conciliatory\napproach is to claim that the property of being valuable does provide\na reason to value the things that have it, but only a\nderivative reason which doesn\u2019t contribute any weight\nto the case for valuing the thing in question over and above that\ncontributed by the non-derivative reasons provided by certain of the\nthing\u2019s lower-order properties (Schroeder 2009; McHugh and Way\n2016; Rowland 2019). Regardless, since the negative thesis isn\u2019t\nplausibly essential to FA theory, whether to accept this or some other\nversion of it is a further choice point for FA theorists.\n\nTo summarize, FA theorists face a number of choices in formulating\ntheir theories: are their theories metaphysical accounts of evaluative\nfacts and properties, analyses of evaluative concepts, or semantic\naccounts of evaluative terms? Which evaluative items, in particular,\nwill they aim to explain? Which normative property of responses will\ntheir theories appeal to: fittingness, reasons, or some alternative?\nWho are the subjects of the relevant responses? And do their accounts\n\u201cpass the buck\u201d? We can characterize FA theories, defining\ntheir nature and scope, according to our answers to these\nquestions.\n2. Attractions\n\nThis section canvasses three main attractions of FA theories: their\nability to explain various interesting connections between certain\nnormative and evaluative properties (section 2.1); their promise to\n\u201cdemystify\u201d various evaluative properties in various ways\n(section 2.2); and their potential to unify the evaluative properties\nthey aim to explain by identifying what\u2019s common to them, while\nrespecting and clarifying any important differences between them\n(section 2.3).\n2.1 Normative-Evaluative Connections\n\nA central attraction of FA theories is that they promise to explain\ninteresting connections between certain normative and evaluative\nproperties (McHugh and Way 2016). For example, it seems difficult to\ndeny that being valuable and being fitting to value necessarily\nco-vary with each other such that something has value if and only if\nit\u2019s fitting to value, or merits being valued (though see\nsection 3.2 for discussion). And, as discussed in the introduction to\nthis entry, similar equivalences also seem to hold between various\nspecific evaluative properties, such as being admirable or delightful,\nand the fittingness of correspondingly specific types of human\nresponses, e.g., admiring, or being delighted by. FA theories offer\nstraightforward explanations of these equivalences, viz., that facts\ninvolving the evaluative property on the left-hand side are always\ngrounded in facts involving the normative property of responses\nmentioned on the right-hand side, such that facts of the former kind\nobtain if and only if, and because, facts of the latter kind do.\n\nAs another example, consider that whenever something has value, it\nseems that there\u2019s at least some reason to value it. More\nprecisely, it\u2019s plausible that, whenever x is valuable\nin respect p, p is a reason to value x (Way\n2013). For example, if your friendship is valuable in respect of the\nhappiness it brings, the happiness it brings is also a reason to value\nyour friendship. An FA theory that explains facts about value in terms\nof facts about reasons for valuing is well-suited to explain this:\nwhenever p is a respect in which x is valuable,\nthat\u2019s fully because p is a reason to value x.\nAnd parallel explanations can be given of similarly plausible claims\nconcerning the connections between various specific evaluative\nproperties and reasons: respects in which x is admirable,\nlovable, or contemptible, for instance, are also reasons to admire,\nlove, or contemn x, because facts involving the former\nproperties are always grounded in facts involving the latter.\n\nIn principle, FA theorists who appeal to fittingness rather than\nreasons to explain evaluative facts could also explain the necessary\nconnections between reasons and evaluative facts just mentioned. To do\nso, they\u2019d need only to offer an account of the relationship\nbetween fittingness and reasons that, together with their FA theories,\nexplains the connections in question (McHugh and Way 2016; Howard\n2019). For example, consider a theory of reasons on which reasons for\na response consist in facts that contribute to the fittingness of the\nresponse. Paired with an FA theory of value that says that whenever\nx is valuable in respect p, that\u2019s fully\nbecause p contributes to the fittingness of valuing\nx, this account entails that whenever x is valuable\nin respect p, p is a reason to value x.\nLikewise, FA theorists who formulate their theories in terms of\nreasons rather than fittingness could try similarly to explain the\nnecessary connections noted above between evaluative properties and\nvarious kinds of fitting response (Schroeder 2010). And more\ngenerally, regardless of which normative property an FA theorist\nappeals to in their explanations of evaluative facts, explanations of\nthe above connections are in principle available to them.\n\nIn this respect, FA theories have an advantage over so-called\n\u201cno-priority views\u201d which hold that evaluative facts and\nnormative facts of other kinds can\u2019t be fully, non-circularly\nexplained by appeal to one another, such that neither\u00a0kind of\nfact is more fundamental (Ross 1939; Wiggins 1987; McDowell 1998;\nTappolet 2011). Indeed, at least barring their ability to provide\nnaturalistic explanations of the normative and evaluative facts that\nfigure in the above connections, it seems that no-priority theorists\nwould need to take these connections as brute. In this way, FA\ntheories have more explanatory power than no-priority views (Rowland\n2019).\n\nThe potential to explain the above connections, however, isn\u2019t\nunique to FA theory. For example, consider a version of value\nprimitivism, of the kind described in section 1.2, that would reverse\nthe order of explanation posited by FA theories, explaining normative\nfacts about human responses in terms of evaluative facts about the\nobjects of those responses. A proponent of this kind of\n\u201cobject-focused\u201d primitivism might hold that whenever\nsomething is fitting to value that\u2019s fully\u00a0because that\nthing is valuable, and that this is what explains why something has\nvalue if and only if it\u2019s fitting to value. And they might\npropose similarly to explain the parallel equivalences between the\nfittingness of various other types of response and other evaluative\nproperties. Likewise, an object-focused view that claims that facts\nabout reasons to value things are always grounded in the value of\nthose things might explain why there are always reasons to value\nvaluable things (Orsi 2013b). Object-focused views thus seem able to\nexplain the normative-evaluative connections noted above. Moreover, as\nwas mentioned in section 1.1, some find the order of explanation\nposited by this kind of primitivism more intuitively plausible than\nthat claimed by FA theory (for discussion, see Hooker and\nStratton-Lake 2006; Jacobson 2011). Still, FA theories do seem to have\nimportant advantages over object-focused views in explaining the\nconnections in question.\n\nFor one, FA theory is far more parsimonious. Suppose we explain\nnormative facts about human responses (whether they\u2019re facts\nabout the fittingness of those responses or facts about reasons for\nthem) in terms of evaluative facts about the objects of those\nresponses, as object-focused views suggest. So, for example, we\nexplain facts about fitting admiration in terms of facts about the\nadmirability of admiration\u2019s object, facts about fitting love in\nterms of facts about the lovability of love\u2019s object, facts\nabout fitting shame in terms of facts about the shamefulness of\nshame\u2019s object, and so on. Assuming these evaluative facts\ncouldn\u2019t then be explained in terms of normative or evaluative\nfacts of some other kind, it seems we\u2019d thus be left with a\n(massive) plurality of different kinds of evaluative fact, each of\nwhich would be fundamental at least relative to the rest of the\nnormative and evaluative domain.\n\nAlternatively, if, as the FA theorist proposes, we explain all such\nevaluative facts\u00a0in terms of facts involving a normative relation\nof a single kind\u2014e.g., the reason relation or the\nfittingness relation\u2014then we could in principle take only facts\ninvolving that relation to be fundamental relative to the rest of the\nnormative and evaluative domain. Indeed, even if we didn\u2019t take\nfacts involving the relevant relation to be fundamental and instead\nexplained them in terms of facts involving some other normative\nproperty of human responses, we\u2019d still have to posit fewer\nkinds of fundamental facts as compared to object-focused primitivism.\nThus, FA theories are more parsimonious than object-focused\n views.[2]\n\nA second version of value primitivism, however, fares better along\nthis dimension. On this view\u2014call it\n\u201cresponse-focused\u201d primitivism\u2014normative facts about\nhuman responses are to be explained not in terms of evaluative facts\nabout the objects of those responses, but rather in terms of\nevaluative facts about the responses themselves (Moore 1903). In\nparticular, this view holds that normative facts about our responses\nare always grounded in facts to the effect that it\u2019s somehow\nvaluable (simpliciter) to have those\n responses.[3]\n Similar to object-focused views, response-focused views also seem\nable to explain the normative-evaluative connections noted above. For\nexample, response-focused primitivists might claim that something is\nvaluable if and only if it\u2019s fitting to value because whenever\nsomething is fitting to value, that\u2019s because it\u2019s\nintrinsically valuable to value it; and, as a substantive matter,\nsomething is intrinsically valuable to value if and only if it\u2019s\nvaluable (Hurka 2000). And the response-focused theorist might\nsimilarly explain the parallel equivalences between various other\nevaluative properties and the fittingness of certain other responses,\narguing that it\u2019s always intrinsically valuable, e.g., to admire\nthe admirable, love the lovable, despise the despicable, etc.\nLikewise, response-focused views might claim to explain why there are\nalways reasons to value valuable things: they might hold that\nwhenever there are reasons to value something,\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because valuing it is valuable and, as a substantive\nmatter, if something is valuable, then it\u2019s valuable to\nvalue.\n\nIn contrast to object-focused views, response-focused views\nneedn\u2019t be less parsimonious than FA theory. In principle, a\nresponse-focused primitivist could hold that all other normative and\nevaluative facts are to be explained ultimately in terms of facts\nabout the value simpliciter of various types of human\nresponse (or states of affairs, or whatever they take to be the\nfundamental bearers of value) (Moore 1903). However, response-focused\nviews do face potential counterexamples that bear on the plausibility\nof their possible explanations of the normative-evaluative connections\nunder discussion (Way 2013; Howard 2018). The main type of\ncounterexample targets the response-focused view\u2019s claim that,\nwhenever a response is fitting, it\u2019s valuable to have that\nresponse. Perhaps it\u2019s somehow valuable to value what\u2019s\nvaluable, but is it also valuable to be disgusted by the disgusting,\nto envy the enviable, and to be bored by the boring? If not, then\nresponse-focused views would seem unable to explain, e.g., why\nit\u2019s fitting to be disgusted by something if and only if\nit\u2019s disgusting. And, for similar reasons, they\u2019d also be\nunable to explain, e.g., why there are reasons to be disgusted by the\ndisgusting, to be bored by the boring, etc.\n\nFA theories thus look to have some important prima facie\nadvantages over at least many of their competitors in explaining the\nnormative-evaluative connections noted \n above.[4]\n Of course, none of these\nadvantages is necessarily decisive with respect to overall theory\nchoice and there is, in any case, room for rivals of FA theory to\ndispute them. For example, an opponent of FA theory might suggest that\nthe outstanding issues for FA theory that we\u2019ll discuss in\nsection 3 are at least as serious as the worries for primitivism\nraised above. Nevertheless, it remains an attraction of FA theory that\nit seems well placed to explain the normative-evaluative connections\nin question.\n2.2 Value \u201cDemystified\u201d\n\nA second attraction often claimed for FA theory is its potential to\n\u201cdemystify\u201d value in various ways. Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2004) suggest, for example, that FA\ntheory \u201cremoves the air of mystery from the normative\n\u2018compellingness\u2019 of values\u201d (391). Their thought is\nthat it\u2019s no mystery why facts about the value of things should\nhave normative implications for our responses to those things if such\nfacts are always grounded in, and so imply, normative facts about our\nresponses. But there are other ways in which FA theories have been\nclaimed to demystify value and, in particular, value\nsimpliciter.\n\nPerhaps the most important way in which FA theory stands to demystify\nvalue is by answering skepticism about it. In an influential paper,\nPeter Geach (1965) argues that there\u2019s no such thing as being\ngood or valuable simpliciter. In particular, he argues that\nthe only intelligible kind of \u201cgoodness\u201d there is, is\n\u201cattributive goodness\u201d, i.e., the kind of goodness that a\nthing has when it\u2019s good as the kind of thing that it is. Thus,\nfor Geach, while it makes sense to claim that things can be good\nas the kind of thing they are\u2014e.g., that there can be\ngood toasters, baristas, and bombs\u2014there\u2019s no sense to be\nmade of claims to the effect that something is just plain\ngood, i.e., valuable in a way that isn\u2019t relativized to a\nparticular kind of thing. Citing Geach, Philippa Foot (1985) and\nJudith Jarvis Thomson (1993, 1997) also marshal versions of this idea\nagainst traditional forms of consequentialism, which, on a natural\ncharacterization, aim to explain the rightness and wrongness of acts\nultimately in terms of facts about the (comparative) value\nsimpliciter of their outcomes. Although Foot and Thomson\ndisagree with Geach that all value is attributive\n(acknowledging the existence of a distinct property of being good\nfor, for instance), they at least agree that there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as being just plain good, or valuable simpliciter.\nThis conclusion is independently interesting, but, if true, would also\nhave devastating implications for traditional forms of\nconsequentialism (not to mention for primitivism about value\nsimpliciter of the kind discussed in sections 1.2 and\n2.1).\n\nAs several authors have noted, however, FA theories seem to offer a\npromising response to this kind of skepticism (Zimmerman 2001; Nye,\nPlunkett, and Ku 2015; Rowland 2016; McHugh and Way 2016). In\nparticular, FA theorists might hold that facts about value\nsimpliciter can be explained\u00a0fully\u00a0in terms of\ncertain kinds of normative facts about certain kinds of valuing\nresponses. Since skeptics about value simpliciter\naren\u2019t similarly skeptical about the kinds of normative facts\nthat FA theorists might appeal to in explaining this property, the FA\ntheorist\u2019s account of value simpliciter would thus seem\nto render the property intelligible, even by the skeptic\u2019s own\nlights. In this way, FA theorists can answer skeptics about value\nsimpliciter.\n\nAnd skepticism about value simpliciter isn\u2019t the only\nkind of value skepticism that FA theories stand to answer. In the last\nseveral decades, a version of consequentialism known as\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d consequentialism has come to prominence,\npromising to account for a range of normative phenomena often held to\nbe incompatible with traditional formulations of the view, e.g.,\nspecial obligations and deontic constraints (Dreier 1993; Portmore\n2005; Smith 2003). This kind of consequentialism can be developed in\neither of two ways. On the first way, agent-relative consequentialism\nposits a distinctive evaluative relation, viz., that of being valuable\nrelative to an agent, where this \u2018agent-relative\nvalue\u2019 is distinct both from value simpliciter, which\nis typically held to be agent neutral, and from the relation of being\nvaluable for the agent (see esp. Portmore 2005). According to\nsome, this relation can be glossed as value from the agent\u2019s\n\u201cpoint of view\u201d, where what\u2019s valuable from an\nagent\u2019s point of view\u00a0is meant to be distinct somehow, at\nleast in principle, from what the agent believes, or should believe,\nto be valuable (see, e.g., Hurka 2003). Agent-relative\nconsequentialists who posit this distinctive relation thus claim that\nwhich outcomes are best relative to an agent might differ\nfrom the outcomes that are either best simpliciter or best\nfor the agent. And, at least sometimes, what an agent ought to do on\nthis view is what would produce the outcome that\u2019s best relative\nto them. Paired with the right substantive assumptions about how to\nrank outcomes relative to particular agents, this apparatus purports\nto allow agent-relative consequentialists to capture the normative\nphenomena noted above. The second way of developing the view works\nsimilarly except that, rather than positing a distinctive notion of\nagent-relative value, on top of value simpliciter and the\nrelation of being valuable for, this variant of the view claims that,\nin fact, there\u2019s just a single kind of value, whose\nnature is fundamentally agent-relative, and which agents ought always\nto maximize (Smith 2009).\n\nHowever, in an influential paper, Mark Schroeder (2007b) questions the\nintelligibility of the kind of agent-relative value to which these\nversions of consequentialism appeal. And many others have also\nclaimed, similarly, that they lack any independent, pre-theoretical\ngrip on the notion of agent-relative value (Dancy 2000; Hurley 2017;\nMaguire 2016; Zimmerman 2011). In response, agent-relative\nconsequentialists (of both kinds) have turned to FA theory, claiming\nthat the relevant evaluative relation can be rendered intelligible by\nexplicating it in terms of certain normative properties of preference\nor desire (see esp. Portmore 2011 and Smith 2009). For example, the\nagent-relative consequentialist might claim that the agent-relative\nvalue of an outcome can be explicated in terms of agent-relative\nreasons for preferring it to its alternatives. They might then claim\nthat what agents ought to do is to bring about the outcomes they ought\nto prefer, all things considered, with the stipulation that\nagent-relative reasons for preference can be relevant to which\noutcomes agents ought to prefer. The details are important here, and\ncertain ways of developing this view seem less tenable than others\n(see, e.g., Schroeder 2007, 292\u201394). Still, FA theories do seem\nto offer agent-relative consequentialists the most promising line of\nresponse to their skeptical critics. (For more on this application of\nFA theory, see the entry on\n value theory).\n2.3 Unifying the Evaluative\n\nA third attraction of FA theory is its potential to unify the\nevaluative properties it aims to explain, by identifying what\u2019s\ncommon to those properties, while also clarifying important\ndifferences among them. As an initial example, consider the various\nways of being good simpliciter. A thing might be good\ninstrumentally, noninstrumentally, intrinsically, extrinsically, in\nsome respect, or overall. An FA theory of being good\nsimpliciter can be applied to provide unifying explanations\nof all these ways of having this property (McHugh and Way 2016;\nRowland 2019). Perhaps the most popular way to do this is to appeal to\ndifferent ways of valuing. For instance, an FA theorist might\nhold that whenever something is noninstrumentally good\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value for its own\nsake, whereas when something is instrumentally good,\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value ultimately\nfor the sake of something else (viz., something that\u2019s\nfitting to value for its own sake). For example, they might say that\nhard work is instrumentally good because it\u2019s fitting to value\nultimately for the sake of any reward it brings that's itself fitting\nto value for its own sake. Similarly, FA theorists might hold that\nwhenever something is intrinsically (extrinsically) good,\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value that thing\nintrinsically (extrinsically), i.e., for its intrinsic (extrinsic)\nproperties. For example, they might say that wisdom is intrinsically\ngood because it\u2019s fitting to value for certain of its intrinsic\nfeatures, whereas money is extrinsically good because it\u2019s\nfitting to value for certain of its extrinsic, relational properties.\nLikewise, the FA theorist might explain facts about a thing being good\nin some respect (overall) in terms of facts to the effect that\nit\u2019s fitting to value that thing in that respect (overall). For\ninstance, they might hold that one outcome is good overall because\nit\u2019s fitting to value on the whole, whereas another outcome is\nbad overall, but good in some respect, because it\u2019s fitting to\nvalue in that respect (but not overall). And these accounts can of\ncourse be combined to explain any way of being good that consists in a\ncomplex of some possible subset of any of the above ways of possessing\nthis property. For example, an FA theorist might claim that whenever\nsomething is noninstrumentally, extrinsically good in some respect,\nthat\u2019s just because it\u2019s fitting to value that thing for\nits own sake, for its extrinsic properties, in the relevant respect.\nAnd there are other possibilities for the FA theorist here, beyond\nappealing to different ways of valuing. For example, an FA theorist\nmight propose to explain the difference between something being good\nin a respect as opposed to being good overall not by appeal to\ndifferences in the ways of valuing that figure in their accounts of\nthese properties, but rather by appeal to differences in the normative\nproperties that their accounts deploy. For instance, Rowland (2019)\nsuggests that whenever something is good in a respect, that\u2019s\nbecause there\u2019s a pro tanto reason to value it, whereas\nwhen something is good overall, that\u2019s because there\u2019s\nsufficient reason to value it. Which approach is more\nplausible is a matter of intramural debate.\n\nIn addition to offering unifying explanations of all the ways of being\ngood simpliciter, FA theories also promise to unify other\nvarieties of value. For example, just as we might offer FA theories of\nbeing good simpliciter, we might also offer them of the\nproperties of being attributively good and of being good\nfor some person or thing (Schroeder 2010; Skorupski 2010;\nMcHugh and Way 2016; Rowland 2019). For example, McHugh and Way (2016)\nsuggest as a first pass that whenever something, x, is\nattributively good, or good as a kind of thing K,\nthat\u2019s fully\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting for anyone for whom\nit\u2019s fitting to want a K to value x. And\naccording to Rowland (2019), whenever something, x, is good\nfor some person or thing, S, that\u2019s\u00a0because there\nare reasons for anyone who has reasons to care about S to\nvalue x, because they have reasons to care about S.\nAnd the prospects seem at least equally good for a fittingness-based\nFA theory to explain the relation of being good for, and for a\nreasons-based FA theory to explain the property of being attributively\ngood. So, regardless of which normative property of responses FA\ntheories appeal to, they have the potential to unify these different\nvarieties of value. And since it\u2019s plausible that different\nvarieties of value must have something in common in virtue of which\nthey all qualify as varieties of value, it\u2019s an\nadvantage of FA theories that they\u2019re able to explain what this\nis\u2014viz., that each can be fully explained in terms of facts\ninvolving normative properties of responses to be had by certain sets\nof agents\u2014while also respecting the real, important differences\nbetween the kinds of value in question.\n\nAnd FA theories also seem able, similarly, to unify the variety of\nspecific evaluative properties that populate the evaluative domain,\ne.g., that of being admirable, delightful, praiseworthy, etc. For\nassuming that, for each such property, facts involving it can be\nexplained in terms of facts involving a certain normative property of\na certain type of response, FA theorists can claim that this is what\nall such properties have in common, while also properly distinguishing\namong them according to the particular type of response that they\nappeal to in their explanation of each. And, according to some, there\nare likewise prospects for applying FA theories to so-called\n\u201cthick\u201d evaluative properties, such as that of being\ncourageous and kind (for extensive discussion, see Rowland 2019, ch.\n9). If so, FA theories stand to provide unifying explanations not just\nof proper subsets of evaluative properties, but of all such\nproperties. Indeed, the most ambitious FA theorists might claim that\nall evaluative properties have in common that they can each be\naccounted for in terms of a certain normative property of a certain\ntype of human response.\n3. Outstanding Issues\n\nDespite the attractions discussed above, FA theories also face several\noutstanding issues, which challenge both their extensional adequacy\nand explanatory commitments. This section covers four outstanding\nissues for FA theory. The first three consist in putative\ncounterexamples that\u00a0pose extensional challenges: the Wrong Kind\nof Reason problem (section 3.1); the Wrong Kind of Value problem\n(section 3.2); and the problem of partiality (section 3.3). The fourth\nand final issue challenges the explanatory element of FA theory,\nalleging that at least certain FA theories may be viciously circular\n(section 3.4).\n3.1 The Wrong Kind of Reason Problem\n\nPerhaps the most famous challenge to FA theories is what\u2019s known\nas the Wrong Kind of Reason problem (WKR problem). At a first pass,\nthe WKR problem is the problem that, at least sometimes, it seems that\nwhat\u2019s valuable doesn\u2019t correspond to what there\u2019s\nreason to value. For example, consider an FA theory like\nScanlon\u2019s buck-passing view from section 1.5, which entails that\nsomething is valuable if and only if (and because) there are reasons\nfor just anyone to value it. The trouble is that, intuitively, there\ncan be reasons to value things that have no value as well as reasons\nnot to value things that do have value. To adapt an example from Roger\nCrisp (2000), suppose an evil demon will kill you unless you value a\ncup of mud. This fact seems like a reason to value the cup, but the\ncup, being a cup of mud, has no value. Hence, an FA theory like\nScanlon\u2019s buck-passing view seems sometimes to predict that the\nobject of a valuing attitude has value when, intuitively, it\ndoesn\u2019t. Similarly, consider an FA theory that explains facts\nabout what\u2019s valuable in terms of facts about what there\u2019s\nsufficient reason to value. Now suppose the demon will kill\nyou if you value something of value. Here, we might think you lack\nsufficient reason to value the valuable thing. If so, then this\nversion of FA theory also seems subject to counterexample. This class\nof counterexamples is known as the \u201cWrong Kind of Reason\nproblem\u201d since the reasons that figure in the\nexamples\u2014reasons that (dis)favor a valuing attitude without\nmaking the attitude\u2019s object (dis)valuable\u2014are of the\n\u201cwrong kind\u201d to figure in FA theories: they\u2019re\nreasons to value x that are irrelevant to whether x\nhas value, and hence can\u2019t be appealed to in order to explain\nwhy x is (or isn\u2019t) valuable.\n\nThe WKR problem generalizes in two important ways. First, it seems to\narise not only for certain FA theories of value simpliciter,\nbut also for certain FA theories of more specific evaluative\nproperties. For example, Crisp\u2019s demon might equally threaten\nharm unless you admire someone who\u2019s not admirable, despise\nsomeone who\u2019s not despicable, love someone who\u2019s not\nlovable, etc. Second, in addition to arising for versions of FA theory\nthat explain evaluative facts in terms of facts about reasons\nfor certain responses, the WKR problem also arises for FA theories\nthat try to explain evaluative facts by appeal to deontic facts of\nvarious other kinds\u2014for example, by appeal to facts about which\nresponses we ought to or may have. Indeed, just as the demon\u2019s\nthreat might give you a reason to value the mud, it might also make it\nthe case that you should or that you\u2019re\nrequired to value it, or that valuing it would be\njustified. The question of whether the WKR problem\ngeneralizes to apply to all versions of FA theory is discussed in\ndetail below.\n\nAs is always the case when a theory is confronted with putative\ncounterexamples, two broad responses are available: proponents of the\ntheory might either reject the counterexamples or concede them, but\ntry somehow to revise the theory so as to avoid them. Proponents of FA\ntheory have explored both kinds of\n response.[5]\n The first kind of response amounts to skepticism about wrong-kind\nreasons, the view that such \u201creasons\u201d aren\u2019t really\nreasons at all and hence aren\u2019t counterexamples to FA theory. On\nthis view, the demon\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t give you a reason to\nvalue the mud (or make it the case that you should or may value it);\ninstead, it at best gives you a reason to want to value the\nmud, or to bring it about that you do if you can. Thus, FA theories\nthat explain facts about value by appeal to facts about reasons (or\noughts, permissions, etc.) don\u2019t falsely predict, e.g., that the\nmud has value. Hence, for WKR skeptics, putative WKRs pose no problem\nfor FA theories (Parfit 2011; Skorupski 2010; Way 2012).\n\nThe success of this response is a matter of debate. According to many,\nthe claim that WKRs for attitudes aren\u2019t reasons for those\nattitudes seems implausible on substantive, first-order grounds. After\nall, the fact that the demon will kill you unless you value the mud\ndoes seem to speak in favor of valuing it, and it also seems this fact\ncould contribute to making it the case that you ought to value the\nmud, or that you\u2019d be justified in valuing it. And, for various\nreasons, many have found unsatisfying the skeptic\u2019s attempt to\nsave the phenomenon by claiming that, although the demon\u2019s\nthreat gives you no reason to value the mud, it does give you a reason\nto want or to try to bring it about that you do (see, e.g.,\nD\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000b, Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004, Danielsson and Olson 2007, Reisner 2009,\nand Rosen 2015a).\n\nWKR skeptics thus need to argue that WKRs aren\u2019t reasons for the\nattitudes they seem to favor and to explain why they\u2019re not\n(McHugh and Way 2016). One popular proposed explanation of why WKRs\naren\u2019t reasons appeals to a response-condition on reasons,\naccording to which a consideration p can be a reason for you\nto A only if you could A for the reason that\np (Kelly 2002; Shah 2006; Parfit 2011). However, proponents\nof FA theories that explain facts about value in terms of facts about\nreasons seem committed to there being reasons that violate such a\ncondition (Way 2012). To adapt a case from Schroeder (2007a), suppose\nNate loves successful surprise parties thrown in his honor but hates\nunsuccessful ones. Plausibly, if there\u2019s a surprise party for\nNate next door, then there\u2019s value in his going and hence, on a\nreasons-based FA theory, a reason for him to want to go. However,\nsince Nate hates surprise parties he expects, this isn\u2019t a\nreason for which he could want to go: \u201cfor as soon as you tell\nhim about it, [the reason] will go away\u201d (Schroeder 2007a, 165).\nHence, reasons-based FA theories seem committed to there being reasons\nthat violate a response condition. Thus, an appeal to this condition\nto explain why WKRs aren\u2019t reasons looks untenable as part of a\nreply to the WKR problem as it applies to these theories.\n\nThe second strategy for responding to the WKR problem, in contrast,\naccepts that WKRs are reasons. Proponents of this second strategy\nconcede the counterexamples that constitute the WKR problem and try to\nrevise FA theories in light of them. The idea is to distinguish\nbetween the \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d kinds of\nreasons to figure in FA theories, and to reformulate the theories such\nthat they reference only reasons of the \u201cright\u201d kind. The\ndistinction between right-kind reasons (RKRs) and WKRs for valuing\nattitudes can of course be easily drawn by appeal to the property of\nbeing valuable simpliciter: RKRs to value x are\nreasons to value x that also make x somehow\nvaluable, whereas WKRs to value x are reasons to value\nx that don\u2019t also make x valuable. Likewise,\nRKRs to admire x are reasons to admire x that also\nmake x admirable, RKRs to despise x are reasons to\ndespise x that also make x despicable, etc. But such\naccounts of the RKR/WKR distinction are of course unavailable to FA\ntheorists, at least insofar as they aspire to provide non-circular\naccounts of evaluative properties.\n\nOver the last two decades, many have attempted to draw the RKR/WKR\ndistinction in a way that doesn\u2019t render FA theories circular.\nAn early proposal held that RKRs are given by facts about the objects\nof the attitudes they favor, whereas WKRs are given by facts about the\nfavored mental states themselves (Stratton-Lake 2005; Piller 2006;\nParfit 2011). But the object-/state-given theory is extensionally\ninadequate: some WKRs are object-given (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004) and some RKRs may be state-given\n(Schroeder 2012). For example, if a demon will kill me unless I admire\nhim, this looks like a reason to admire the demon that\u2019s given\nby the object of this attitude, but it\u2019s irrelevant to whether\nthe demon is admirable, and hence a WKR. On the flip side, the fact\nthat I\u2019ll soon get more information relevant to deciding whether\nto \u03c6 might be an RKR to hold off intending to \u03c6, despite its\nconcerning not the object of intention, and whether it\u2019s\nworthwhile, but the state of intending itself.\n\nAnother view\u2014the \u201calethic view\u201d\u2014holds that\nright- but not wrong-kind reasons to A are reasons to\nA that bear on whether A accurately represents its\nobject (Tappolet 2011; Rosen 2015). But this proposal also faces\nsignificant difficulties. First, it seems to require taking on\ncontentious commitments about how various types of attitudes represent\ntheir objects in order to guarantee the account\u2019s extensional\ncorrectness (McHugh and Way 2016; Schroeder 2010); and second, these\ncommitments may render FA theories circular, if it\u2019s held that\ncertain of these attitudes represent their objects as having\nevaluative properties (Ross 1939). For example, if we assume that\ndesire represents its object as desirable, then the alethic view would\nyield the plausible result that RKRs for desire are reasons for desire\nrelevant to whether the object of desire is desirable. But (1) this\nview about the representational content of desire is contentious, and\n(2) this commitment would seem to render an FA theory of desirability\n circular.[6]\n\n\nIn addition to these, many other accounts of the RKR/WKR distinction\nhave been offered and criticized (see, e.g., the proposals in\nSchroeder 2010 and Rowland 2019 and the criticisms of each,\nrespectively, in Sharadin 2013 and McHugh and Way 2022a). Common to\nmany proposed ways of drawing the RKR/WKR distinction is a commitment\nto the idea that the distinction can be drawn in terms of reasons and\ncertain non-normative properties alone. This commitment is common, for\ninstance, to all of the proposals mentioned so far. But none of these\nproposals has gained wide acceptance. Partly in light of this, a\nnumber of authors have opted to avoid this commitment, and instead to\noffer an account of the RKR/WKR distinction that takes FA theories\nback to their earliest roots. On this approach, the RKR/WKR\ndistinction can be drawn in terms of the normative notion of\nfittingness. Roughly, RKRs for attitudes are considerations that\ncontribute to the fittingness of those attitudes, whereas WKRs for\nattitudes are reasons for attitudes that lack this feature. On this\nproposal, an FA theory of value simpliciter amounts to the\nthesis that facts involving value simpliciter are always\nfully and ultimately grounded in facts about the fittingness\nof certain valuing responses, rather than in facts about\nreasons for those responses.\n\nProponents of this position argue that the WKR problem poses no\nproblem for FA theories of value so understood (Danielsson and Olson\n2007; Chappell 2012; Sharadin 2015; McHugh and Way 2016; Howard 2019).\nThey claim that while facts like the demon\u2019s threat may provide\nreasons for the attitudes they support, or even make it the case that\nyou ought to have those attitudes, such facts are irrelevant to\nwhether those attitudes are fitting. For example, even if the fact of\nthe demon\u2019s threat gives you a reason to value a cup of mud, or\nmakes it the case that you ought to have this attitude, this fact\nisn\u2019t one in virtue of which the mud merits being\nvalued, or is worthy of this attitude; hence, this fact fails to make\nthe attitude fitting (see the characterization of fittingness, in\nterms of merit and worthiness, offered in section 1.3). The judgment\nthat WKRs such as the demon\u2019s threat are irrelevant to the\nfittingness of the attitudes they favor is widely shared. In addition\nto the authors cited above, see, inter alia, Broad 1930;\nBrandt 1946; Ewing 1939, 1948; Wiggins 1987; and McDowell 1998. Hence,\nsome have argued, drawing the RKR/WKR distinction in terms of\nfittingness, and so formulating FA theory ultimately in terms of\nfittingness rather than in terms of some (other) deontic notion,\noffers a promising solution to the WKR problem for FA theories of\nvalue \n simpliciter.[7]\n Further, this strategy promises to generalize to address the problem\nas it occurs for FA theories of other, specific evaluative properties\nas well.\n\nAt least on the face of things, then, FA theories that explain\nevaluative facts ultimately in terms of facts about the fittingness of\ncertain types of response seem to have an advantage when it comes to\nanswering the WKR problem. Still, some have raised concerns with the\nproposed appeal to fittingness in addressing this problem. For\nexample, some authors claim to lack a pre-theoretical grip on the\nnotion of fittingness, and thus find explanations of evaluative facts\nin terms of facts involving the fittingness relation uninformative\n(Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). And others have argued,\non various grounds, that facts involving the fittingness of human\nresponses will ultimately need to be explained in terms of reasons (of\na certain kind) for those responses (Schroeder 2010, 2020). A fully\nsatisfying answer to the WKR problem that appeals to the notion of\nfittingness will thus need to address these challenges.\n3.2 The Wrong Kind of Value Problem\n\nThe Wrong Kind of Value problem (WKV problem) also poses\ncounterexamples to at least certain FA theories. It alleges that there\ncan be cases in which something has value without calling for any\nvaluing response on the part of anyone\u2014i.e., the thing\nisn\u2019t fitting for anyone to value, there\u2019s no reason for\nanyone to value it, it\u2019s not the case that anyone ought to value\nit, etc. In short: there are cases where facts about value\ncan\u2019t correspond to normative facts to the effect that\nsome valuing response is called for, since in some cases the former\nsort of fact can obtain without the latter.\n\nTo illustrate, consider an example, the spirit of which is due to\nKrister Bykvist (2009), in which there are happy egrets, but no past,\npresent, or future agents, i.e., beings capable of having a valuing\nresponse. Plausibly, the egrets\u2019 pleasure has value. But, the\nthought goes, since there are no beings in this world capable of\nvaluing the egrets\u2019 pleasure, the egrets\u2019 pleasure\ncan\u2019t be valued and hence a valuing response to it can\u2019t\nbe fitting or otherwise called for. Thus, the value of the\negrets\u2019 happiness doesn\u2019t correspond to a normative fact\nabout a valuing response. Hence, FA theories must be extensionally\ninadequate.\n\nAnother kind of example is due to Andrew Reisner (2015). In this kind\nof example, the value of something in a given world depends on whether\nanyone in that world values that thing. If anyone in the relevant\nworld does value the thing, then the thing becomes disvaluable, or\nbad. However, if no one values it, then it\u2019s valuable. (There\nare various ways of filling out this kind of case, but these are its\nimportant structural features; for Reisner\u2019s preferred version,\nsee ibid., 467\u20138.) In this kind of case, valuing something\nvaluable extinguishes its value. Reisner claims that it therefore\ncan\u2019t be fitting to value the valuable thing; hence, FA theories\nare extensionally inadequate.\n\nDefenders of FA theory have responded to these cases in various ways\n(Orsi 2013a; Way 2013; Elliott 2017; Rowland 2019). Perhaps the most\npopular response to each is one that purports to answer both. This\nresponse agrees that it\u2019s not fitting (or otherwise called for)\nfor anyone in the happy egret world to value the egrets\u2019\npleasure (since there are no beings capable of valuing in this world)\nand that it\u2019s not fitting for anyone in the world Reisner\ndescribes to value the thing whose value would be extinguished if\nanyone in that world were to value it. But, the response goes,\nit\u2019s nonetheless fitting for beings in other possible\nworlds\u2014us, for example\u2014to value the egrets\u2019 pleasure\n(so far as it goes) and to value the valuable thing whose value would\nbe eliminated were to it be valued by its worldmates (Orsi 2013a; Way\n2013; Rowland 2019). Hence, in both kinds of case, the value at stake\ncan still be said to correspond to normative facts about a certain\nvaluing response, albeit a response to be had by beings of other\nworlds.\n\nReisner (2015) anticipates and criticizes the above response on\nvarious grounds, though see Rowland (2019, ch. 7) for an extended\nreply. A different response, also offered by Rowland, suggests that FA\ntheorists might state their theory counterfactually, claiming\n(roughly) that whenever something has value, that\u2019s fully\nbecause valuing it would be called for were there any beings\ncapable of valuing it around. On this formulation of FA theory,\nsomething has value if, in the nearest world where there are beings\ncapable of valuing it, their valuing it is called for. Since a valuing\nresponse to the egrets\u2019 pleasure is evidently called for in the\nnearest world where there are beings capable of valuing it, this\nformulation of the theory thus predicts that the birds\u2019 pleasure\nhas value. Thus, this formulation of FA theory seems at least to avoid\nBykvist\u2019s kind of counterexample. However, it doesn\u2019t also\nobviously avoid Reisner\u2019s. In Reisner\u2019s case, unlike\nBykvist\u2019s, the nearest world where there are beings capable of\nvaluing the valuable thing in question is the same world that contains\nthe valuable thing. But recall: if beings in that world were to value\nthe valuable thing, the thing wouldn\u2019t be valuable. And\naccording to Reisner, this means that it can\u2019t be fitting or\notherwise called for, for those beings to value the thing in question.\nReisner here relies on a principle according to which it can be\nfitting for an agent S to value a thing x only if\nx would be fitting to value, conditional on\nS\u2019s valuing it. If this principle is true, then the\ncounterfactual proposal fails to address Reisner\u2019s case; but see\nRowland (ibid.) for arguments that it\u2019s false.\n\nWhich of these responses to the WKV problem is preferable, and whether\neither is ultimately acceptable, remain open questions, and so\nconstitute avenues for further research. Two final points are worth\nemphasis. First, the force of the WKV problem, unlike that of the WKR\nproblem, seems to depend not at all on which normative property of\nresponses that FA theories appeal to in their explanations of\nevaluative facts. In particular, the problem seems to apply with equal\nforce to FA theories that appeal to the fittingness of human\nresponses and to those that appeal to reasons for those\n responses.[8]\n Hence, the WKV problem may apply more widely than the WKR problem.\nBut, secondly, the WKV problem seems in another way narrower than the\nWKR problem. For while the WKR problem applies not only to FA theories\nof value simpliciter, but also to FA theories of specific\nevaluative properties, such as those of being shameful or disgusting,\nthe WKV problem may not generalize in this way. For notice that the\nWKV problem illustrates and supports the worry, mentioned in section\n1.1, that facts about value simpliciter can seem independent\nof (normative) facts about actual or possible human responses. But\nfacts about what\u2019s shameful or disgusting\nseemingly couldn\u2019t be independent of (normative) facts about the\nhuman responses of shame or disgust (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2006;\nJacobson 2011; D\u2019Arms 2022). Perhaps something could be valuable\nin a world without valuers, but could something be shameful in a world\nwithout shame? If not, then the WKV problem may be a problem for some,\nbut not all, FA theories, depending on the evaluative properties the\ntheories target. At best, then, the WKV problem wouldn\u2019t be a\nreason to reject FA theory tout court, but only to be more\nselective about which FA theories we accept.\n3.3 The Problem of Partiality\n\nIn addition to offering accounts of monadic evaluative properties,\nsuch as being lovable or valuable, FA theories can offer accounts of\ndyadic, comparative evaluative properties, such as those of being more\nvaluable or better than. For example, FA theorists might\nclaim that whenever x is better than y, that\u2019s\nfully because it\u2019s fitting to value x more than\ny, or to prefer x to y. Likewise, they\nmight hold that whenever x is more lovable than y,\nthat\u2019s fully because x is fitting to love more than\ny. Indeed, according to some, FA theorists should take\nmonadic properties like that of being valuable or lovable to be\nexplanatorily posterior to their comparative counterparts (Schroeder\n2010). But the problem of partiality poses potential counterexamples\nto FA theories of at least certain comparative evaluative properties,\nfor example, that of being better than. The problem, roughly, is that\nin some cases where y is no better than x\u2014or\nindeed, where x is worse than y\u2014it can seem\nfitting to be partial to x, or to prefer x to\ny. For example, suppose that either My Pal or a Stranger can\nbe rescued from drowning, but not both. And suppose also that, except\nfor the fact that My Pal is my pal and that Stranger is a stranger,\neverything else is equal. Plausibly, then, My Pal\u2019s being\nrescued is no better than Stranger\u2019s being rescued and vice\nversa\u2014the two outcomes seem equally good. Still, it can seem\nfitting for me to prefer that My Pal is rescued. Hence, it can seem\nfitting for me to prefer one outcome to another when the outcomes are\nequally good. This is the kind of example that constitutes the\npartiality problem; and instances are easily multiplied.\n\nThe partiality problem was noticed and discussed by one of the\nprogenitors of FA theory, A.C. Ewing (1939), but has only recently\ncome to occupy the attention of contemporary authors (e.g., Bykvist\n2009; Olson 2009; Lemos 2011; Zimmerman 2011; and Orsi 2013).\nImportantly, the problem seems to apply only to FA theories of\ncomparative evaluative facts that propose to explain the relevant\nfacts in terms of normative facts that call for just anyone to have a\ncertain response. For example, that it\u2019s fitting for me to\nprefer that My Pal is rescued seems problematic only for FA theories\nof betterness that propose to explain facts about what\u2019s better\nthan what by appeal to facts about what\u2019s fitting for just\nanyone to prefer (or to value more). This way of explaining the\nproperty of being better than is a natural way of capturing the\npopular and plausible idea that betterness is an agent-neutral\nevaluative property (see section 1.4). However, if we hold\ninstead\u00a0that betterness is fundamentally agent-relative, in the\nmanner of Smith (2009), then we might reject the idea that facts about\nit are to be explained always in terms of normative facts about\nwhat\u2019s fitting for just anyone to prefer (as Smith himself\ndoes). This would be one way of avoiding the partiality problem as it\napplies to FA theories of better than, though the view about\nbetterness on which it rests is controversial; by far, the majority\nview is that the property is agent-neutral.\n\nA second way of dissolving the partiality problem is suggested by\nJonas Olson (2009). On Olson\u2019s view, the partiality problem is\nstructurally the same as, and indeed a special case of, the WKR\nproblem (see section 3.1): the fact that My Pal is my pal gives me\n(some, sufficient, or decisive) reason to prefer the outcome where\nthey\u2019re saved to the outcome where Stranger is, but it\ndoesn\u2019t make the former outcome any better than the latter.\nHence, according to Olson, a solution to the WKR problem should also\nsuffice to solve the problem of partiality. On Olson\u2019s favored\nsolution to the WKR problem, FA theorists should explain evaluative\nfacts in terms of facts about fittingness rather than reasons. Olson\nsuggests that while the fact that My Pal is my pal might give me\nreason to prefer that they\u2019re rescued, this fact\ndoesn\u2019t also make this preference fitting. Hence, FA\ntheories that explain betterness in terms of what\u2019s fitting for\nall agents to prefer, rather than in terms of what there\u2019s\nreason for all agents to prefer, can avoid the problem of\npartiality.\n\nHowever, there are two worries for Olson\u2019s diagnosis of the\nproblem of partiality as an instance of the WKR problem. First,\nwhatever we might think about the plausibility of WKR skepticism as a\nsolution to the WKR problem, this view seems less plausible as a\nsolution to the problem of partiality. Even those inclined to deny\nthat the demon\u2019s threat gives you a reason to desire a cup of\nmud would likely find it hard to deny that My Pal\u2019s being my pal\ngives me a reason to prefer that they\u2019re saved. Further,\nit\u2019s not obviously incoherent for the WKR skeptic to deny that\nthe former fact is a reason while accepting that the latter one is.\nThus, the fact that WKR skepticism seems at least more viable as a\nsolution to the WKR problem than it does as a solution to the problem\nof partiality suggests that these problems aren\u2019t the same.\n\nSecond, as indicated above, it can seem plausible not only that I have\nreason to prefer that My Pal is rescued, but that, contrary to Olson,\nthis preference is fitting. This, too, would distinguish the examples\nthat constitute the problem of partiality from those that constitute\nthe WKR problem. As discussed in section 3.1, the demon\u2019s threat\nseems not to make it fitting to the value the mud\u2014it\u2019s not\na fact in virtue of which the mud merits being valued. By\ncontrast, the fact that My Pal is my pal can seem to merit my\npreferring that they\u2019re rescued; and if it does, this preference\nis fitting.\n\nBoth of these considerations put pressure on the idea that the problem\nof partiality is an instance of the WKR problem. But they also suggest\nthat, like the WKV problem (section 3.2), the problem of partiality\nmay pose a problem for certain FA theories regardless of the normative\nproperty they appeal to: Just as the fact that My Pal is my pal gives\nme a reason to prefer that they\u2019re saved, or perhaps makes it\nthe case that I should have this preference, this fact may also make\nthis preference fitting. Hence, the problem of partiality in this way\nthreatens to be a rather general problem for FA theories, specifically\nfor those that aspire to explain certain comparative evaluative\nfacts.\n\nBeyond Olson\u2019s proposal, various other solutions to the\npartiality problem have been suggested and debated (see, e.g., Lemos\n2011; Zimmerman 2011; Orsi 2013a; and Nye, Plunkett, and Ku 2015).\nHowever, it\u2019s fair to say that, so far, none has gained wide\nacceptance. Thus, the partiality problem, perhaps more so than the WKR\nproblem or the WKV problem, remains an outstanding and pressing issue\nfor FA \n theory.[9]\n3.4 Circularity\n\nAs noted in the introduction to this entry, some FA theorists identify\nwhat\u2019s valuable simpliciter with what\u2019s\ndesirable, and explain facts about what\u2019s desirable in terms of\nfacts about what\u2019s fitting to desire. Other FA theorists,\nhowever, reject that the valuable can be identified with the\ndesirable, often on the grounds that some valuable things seem not to\ncall for desire but for other pro-responses (Ewing 1939; Anderson\n1993; Scanlon 1998). For example, we might think that persons have a\nparticular kind of value that calls fundamentally for responses like\nrespect and preservation, and indeed that desire\nisn\u2019t the proper response to the special value of persons at\nall. And more generally, FA theorists might hold that the pro-response\ncalled for by a valuable thing can vary according to the kind of thing\nat issue. For example, as Scanlon (1998) suggests, the pro-response\ncalled for by a valuable friendship might differ from that called for\nby a valuable piece of music. Hence, Scanlon (and others) opt to\nexplain facts about value in terms of normative facts about\nvaluing, where valuing can consist variously in a range of\npro-responses.\n\nBut such FA theories face a challenge. As Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2004) put it, the challenge is to specify\n\u201cthe common denominator for all the responses in the\n\u2018pro\u2019-category\u201d, to tell us \u201cwhat makes them\n\u2018pro\u2019\u201d (401). What makes respect and reverence, for\nexample, positive responses (as opposed to negative ones)? And why is\nprotecting something a pro-response to it while pondering it is not? A\npossible and extensionally plausible answer would be to define\npositive responses as responses that are called for by valuable things\n(and negative responses as responses that are called for by\ndisvaluable things), but this makes FA theories circular. The\nchallenge is for FA theorists to specify what makes pro-attitudes\n\u201cpro\u201d without circularity.\n\nAn early version of this challenge was pressed by W.D. Ross (1939), as\na criticism of Ewing\u2019s (1939) FA theory of value\nsimpliciter. Ross suggests that Ewing\u2019s account of\nvalue in terms of fitting positive emotional responses is circular\nbecause the positive emotional responses he appeals to are always\naccompanied by the thought that the object of the response is somehow\n\u201cgood\u201d. Since positive emotional responses to a thing\ninvolve taking the thing to be good, the goodness of a thing\ncan\u2019t be non-circularly explained by appeal to (fitting)\npositive emotional responses. Ewing\u2019s (1947) response was to\ninsist that positive emotional responses aren\u2019t necessarily\naccompanied by the thought their object is good. Instead, a positive\nemotional response need only be accompanied by thoughts about its\nobject\u2019s non-evaluative, good-making characteristics.\nHence, positive emotional responses needn\u2019t involve the thought\nthat their objects are good.\n\nThe success of Ewing\u2019s reply to Ross continues to be a matter of\ndebate (Hurka 2014, ch. 2). In any case, Ewing\u2019s reply\ndoesn\u2019t offer a positive account of what makes pro-responses\n\u201cpro\u201d; it merely rejects a possible answer to that\nquestion that would make FA theories circular. Another possible\nresponse to the challenge is to embrace circularity. According to\nsome, even if we can\u2019t adequately characterize pro-responses\nwithout reference to the kind of value that FA theories seek to\nexplain, FA theories can nonetheless remain illuminating and\ninformative (see esp. Wiggins 1987 and Tappolet 2011). In short, we\ncan concede the circularity, but claim it\u2019s not vicious. This\nresponse pairs well with the \u201cno-priority view\u201d discussed\nin section 2.1, but seems contrary to FA theories of value, insofar as\ntheir explanatory element is essential to them.\n\nA third response is to concede the purported circularity of certain FA\ntheories of value simpliciter, to reject such theories in\nlight of that circularity, but to embrace FA theories of more specific\nevaluative properties, which, on the face of it, seem less vulnerable\nto circularity worries. According to this response, the right response\nto the present challenge isn\u2019t to abandon FA theory tout\ncourt, but to be more selective about which FA theories we\naccept. For example, we might reject an FA theory of value\nsimpliciter on grounds of circularity, but accept FA theories\nof being delicious, trustworthy, admirable, despicable, lovable,\ndelightful, and so on. Of course, proponents of even this more limited\napproach may still ultimately need to characterize the responses in\nterms of which they seek to explain these evaluative properties\nwithout referring to those properties, but, according to some, the\nprospects for doing so seem at least comparatively promising (Gibbard\n1990; D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000b; Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004; Jacobson 2011; Rosen 2015a).\n\nA fourth and final response, of course, would be to try to tackle the\ncircularity challenge head on by offering a plausible account of what\nmakes pro-responses \u201cpro\u201d that doesn\u2019t refer to the\nnotion of value simpliciter. Perhaps, for example, what makes\npro-responses \u201cpro\u201d is some common descriptive\nmotivational element (Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). Or\nperhaps there\u2019s some common normative element to all\npro-responses that FA theorists could non-circularly appeal to. At the\ntime of writing, however, this issue is underexplored, and the task of\ndeveloping this kind of response remains outstanding.\n",
