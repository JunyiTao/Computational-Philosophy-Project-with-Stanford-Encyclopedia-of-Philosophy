    "main_text": "Humor as Play, Laughter as Play Signal\n6. Comedy\n\nWhile there is only speculation about how humor developed in early\nhumans, we know that by the late 6th century BCE the Greeks\nhad institutionalized it in the ritual known as comedy, and that it\nwas performed with a contrasting dramatic form known as tragedy. Both\nwere based on the violation of mental patterns and expectations, and\nin both the world is a tangle of conflicting systems where humans live\nin the shadow of failure, folly, and death. Like tragedy, comedy\nrepresents life as full of tension, danger, and struggle, with success\nor failure often depending on chance factors. Where they differ is in\nthe responses of the lead characters to life\u2019s incongruities.\nIdentifying with these characters, audiences at comedies and tragedies\nhave contrasting responses to events in the dramas. And because these\nresponses carry over to similar situations in life, comedy and tragedy\nembody contrasting responses to the incongruities in life. (Morreall 1999, ch. 1\u20134). \n\nTragedy valorizes serious, emotional engagement with life\u2019s\nproblems, even struggle to the death. Along with epic, it is part of\nthe Western heroic tradition that extols ideals, the willingness to\nfight for them, and honor. The tragic ethos is linked to patriarchy\nand militarism\u2014many of its heroes are kings and\nconquerors\u2014and it valorizes what Conrad Hyers (1996) calls\nWarrior Virtues\u2014blind obedience, the willingness to kill or die\non command, unquestioning loyalty, single-mindedness, resoluteness of\npurpose, and pride. \n\nComedy, by contrast, embodies an anti-heroic, pragmatic attitude\ntoward life\u2019s incongruities. From Aristophanes\u2019\nLysistrata to Charlie Chaplin\u2019s The Great\nDictator to Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11,\ncomedy has mocked the irrationality of militarism and blind respect\nfor authority. Its own methods of handling conflict include\ndeal-making, trickery, getting an enemy drunk, and running away. As\nthe Irish saying goes, you\u2019re only a coward for a moment, but\nyou\u2019re dead for the rest of your life. In place of Warrior\nVirtues, it extols critical thinking, cleverness, adaptability, and an\nappreciation of physical pleasures like eating, drinking, and sex.\n\n\nAlong with the idealism of tragedy goes elitism. The people who matter\nare kings, queens, and generals. In comedy there are more characters\nand more kinds of characters, women are more prominent, and many\nprotagonists come from lower classes. Everybody counts for one. That\nshows in the language of comedy, which, unlike the elevated language\nof tragedy, is common speech. The basic unit in tragedy is the\nindividual, in comedy it is the family, group of friends, or bunch of\nco-workers.\n\nWhile tragic heroes are emotionally engaged with their problems, comic\nprotagonists show emotional disengagement. They think, rather than\nfeel, their way through difficulties. By presenting such characters as\nrole models, comedy has implicitly valorized the benefits of humor\nthat are now being empirically verified, such as that it is\npsychologically and physically healthy, it fosters mental flexibility,\nand it serves as a social lubricant. With a few exceptions like\nAquinas, philosophers have ignored these benefits.\n\nIf philosophers wanted to undo the traditional prejudices against\nhumor, they might consider the affinities between one contemporary\ngenre of comedy\u2014standup comedy\u2014and philosophy itself.\nThere are at least seven. (Morreall 2009, ch. 7). First, standup comedy and philosophy are\nconversational: like the dialogue format that started with Plato,\nstandup routines are interactive. Second, both reflect on familiar\nexperiences, especially puzzling ones. We wake from a vivid dream, for\nexample, not sure what has happened and what is happening. Third, like\nphilosophers, standup comics often approach puzzling experiences with\nquestions. \u201cIf I thought that dream was real, how do I know that\nI\u2019m not dreaming right now?\u201d The most basic starting point\nin both philosophy and standup comedy is \u201cX\u2014what\u2019s\nup with that?\u201d Fourth, as they think about familiar\nexperiences, both philosophers and comics step back emotionally from\nthem. Henri Bergson (1900 [1911]) spoke of the \u201cmomentary\nanesthesia of the heart\u201d in laughter. Emotional disengagement\nlong ago became a meaning of\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d\u2014\u201crational, sensibly composed,\ncalm, as in a difficult situation.\u201d Fifth, philosophers and\nstandup comics think critically. They ask whether familiar ideas make\nsense, and they refuse to defer to authority and tradition. It was for\nhis critical thinking that Socrates was executed. So were cabaret\ncomics in Germany who mocked the Third Reich. Sixth, in thinking\ncritically, philosophers and standup comics pay careful attention to\nlanguage. Attacking sloppy and illogical uses of words is standard in\nboth, and so is finding exactly the right words to express an idea.\nSeventh, the pleasure of standup comedy is often like the pleasure of\ndoing philosophy. In both we relish new ways of looking at things and\ndelight in surprising thoughts. Cleverness is prized. William James\n(1911 [1979], 11) said that philosophy \u201csees the familiar as if\nit were strange, and the strange as if it were familiar.\u201d The\nsame is true of standup comedy. Simon Critchley has written that both\nask us to \u201clook at things as if you had just landed from another\nplanet\u201d (2002, 1).\n\nOne recent philosopher attuned to the affinity between comedy and\nphilosophy was Bertrand Russell. \u201cThe point of\nphilosophy,\u201d he said, \u201cis to start with something so\nsimple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so\nparadoxical that no one will believe it\u201d (1918, 53). In the\nmiddle of an argument, he once observed, \u201cThis seems plainly\nabsurd: but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to\nbe frightened by absurdities\u201d (2008 [1912], 17).\n\nOften writing for popular audiences, Russell had many quips that would\nfit nicely into a comedy routine:\n\nThe fundamental cause of trouble is that in the modern world the\nstupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt\u201c\n(1998, 28). \nMost people would die sooner than think\u2014in fact they do\nso\u201d (1925a, 166).\nMan is a rational animal\u2014so at least I have been told.\nThroughout a long life, I have looked diligently for evidence in favor\nof this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come\nacross it, though I have searched in many countries spread over three\ncontinents\u201c (1950, 71). \nMathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know\nwhat we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is\ntrue\u201d (1925b, 75).\n\n\nFor more examples of the affinities between comedy and philosophy,\nthere is a series of books on philosophy and popular culture from Open\nCourt Publishing that includes: Seinfeld and Philosophy\n(2002), The Simpsons and Philosophy (2001), Woody Allen\nand Philosophy (2004), and Monty Python and Philosophy\n(2006). Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein have written Plato and\na Platypus Walked into a Bar \u2026 : Understanding Philosophy through\nJokes (2008), and Heidegger and a Hippo Walk Through Those\nPearly Gates: Using Philosophy (and Jokes!) to Explore Life, Death,\nthe Afterlife, and Everything in Between (2009). In philosophy of\nmind, Matthew Hurley, Daniel Dennett, and Reginald Adams (2011) have\nused humor to explain the development of the human mind. In\naesthetics, No\u00ebl Carroll (1999, 2003, 2007, 2013) has written\nabout philosophical implications of comedy and humor, and about their\nrelationships with the genre of horror. The journals Philosophy\nEast and West (1989), the Monist (2005), and\nEducational Philosophy and Theory (2014) have published\nspecial issues on humor. The ancient prejudices against humor that\nstarted with Plato are finally starting to crumble.\n",
