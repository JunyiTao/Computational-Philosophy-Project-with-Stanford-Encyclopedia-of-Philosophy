    "main_text": "Confucian Feminism: A Hybrid Feminist Theory || Rectification of Nei-Wai\n7.1 Rectification of Nei-Wai\n\nSexism is undeniably a shared human experience in most societies.\nDifferent intellectual traditions might have framed the degree and the\nways in which women are lesser differently\u2014let it be lesser in\nintellect, will, or sphere of influence\u2014but women\u2019s lesser\nstatus is plain. Women in Confucian philosophy are lesser, first and\nforemost, in their sphere of influence; the womanly sphere of\nnei\u2014even though it is indispensable to the expansive\nsphere of wai\u2014is restrictive and mostly concerned with\nthe functional aspects of household management. Confucius\u2019s\nfamous saying that one does not need to leave home to get involved in\nstate governance is true to a certain extent (Analects 2.21),\nbut part of the process of self-cultivation to achieve moral\nperfectibility is to expand one\u2019s sphere of influence\nconcentrically from family, state, to the world at large.\n\nA woman, confined to the realm of nei, is essentially a\nfunctional vessel for household management, a sort of thing that\nConfucius said a well-rounded exemplary person should not be\n(Analects 2.12). The structural impediment derived from the\nconfinement of nei will need to be addressed in Confucian\nfeminism, since any viable feminist theory, first of all, will need to\nbe able to deal with the gender-based division of labor that confines\neach gender to a set of prescriptive roles and duties regardless of\none\u2019s actual capacities or unique circumstances. The\nnei-wai distinction as applied to gender, as noted earlier,\nis derived from the functional differentiation (bie \u522b)\nin the spousal relationship as in fufu youbie\n(\u592b\u5a66\u6709\u522b). Hence, in order to address the\nproblem of the confinement of nei, the spousal relationship\nas articulated in the Confucian five core social relations\n(Mencius 3A4; Zhongyong, Ch. 20; Daxue)\nwill also need modification as well.\n\nOne possible replacement for the spousal relationship within the\nConfucian framework would be friendship (you \u53cb), which\nis anchored in the virtue of trust (xin \u4fe1). Unlike the\nspousal relationship, friendship is not primarily, distinctively, nor\ninvariably gender-based; furthermore, the excellence of Confucian\nfriendship is marked by friends\u2019 mutual commitment to moral\nperfectibility, instead of a functional distinction based on gender or\na fulfillment of some sort of external obligations/duties. Lastly,\ngiven the long overlapping usage of friendship and familial\nrelationships from antiquity onward, east and west, this substitution\nis not inappropriate textually or historically (Rosenlee\n 2015).[14]\n",
