    "main_text": "The Late Period || Paul of Venice\n5. Observations\n\nSeveral instructive observations can be made about the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature.\n\nFirst, although this article has focused on Liar-type paradoxes, and\nalthough the medieval literature did too, it also included other kinds\nof puzzles. For example (the \u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019\nparadox), where a = \u2018b is false\u2019 and\nb = \u2018a is false\u2019, no Liar-type paradox\narises; contradiction can be avoided by simply taking one of the two\npropositions as true and the other as false. But medieval logicians\nregarded such cases as problematic because they require us to assign\ndifferent truth values to propositions that are semantically exactly\nalike; there is no reason to pick a as the true proposition\nrather than b or conversely (see Read 2006). Cases like this,\nwhich violate only a kind of semantic \u201cprinciple of sufficient\nreason\u201d, were often included under the heading\n\u201cinsolubles\u201d (for example, Buridan, Sophismata\nVIII.8). A variety of epistemic and pragmatic puzzles were often\nincluded as\n well.[32]\n There was rarely any attempt, as is usual in present-day literature\non the paradoxes, to ignore all the inessentials and focus in on a\nsingle paradigmatic case that gets at the kernel of the issue. For\nmedieval authors, the issue was a broad one. Many did not attempt to\ngive any precise and rigorous characterization of what it takes to be\nan insoluble. Often, the definitions they did give are quite general\nand include much more than Liar-type paradoxes. In contrast,\nBradwardine\u2019s definition is precise: an insoluble is \u201ca\ndifficult paralogism secundum quid et simpliciter arising\nfrom some [speech-] act\u2019s reflection on itself with a privative\ndetermination\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: \u00a72.1).\n\nSecondly, medieval authors did not have any sense of theoretical\n\u201ccrisis\u201d over insolubles, as modern discussions of the\nparadoxes often do. The medievals did not regard the paradoxes as\nthreatening the very foundations of reasoning. On the contrary, most\nauthors seem to have regarded them as merely argumentative nuisances,\nand their main concern was to come up with a way of dealing with them\nwhen they arose in disputation. No doubt this difference from the\nreaction to the logical paradoxes in modern logic is due to the\ndifferent contexts in which the discussions emerged. Modern logic is a\nformalized, systematic discipline, closely tied to the foundations of\nmathematics; medieval logic, by contrast, was much looser and informal\n(which of course is not to say it lacked insight), much more tied to\nthe give and take of live academic disputation.\n\nThirdly, and related to the second point, most medieval authors\nthought it was entirely feasible to find a completely satisfactory\n\u201csolution\u201d to insolubles. Insolubles were regarded as\nresting on a straightforward but pernicious fallacy, although authors\ndisagreed over just what the fallacy is. William of Ockham, for\ninstance, writes,\n\n\nAs for insolubles, you should know it is not because they can in no\nway be solved that some sophisms are called insolubles, but because\nthey are solved with difficulty. (Ockham [O-SL]: III-3,\n46)\n\n\nOne medieval author who is known to have departed from this confident\nview is William Heytesbury, who raises objections against his own\nview, and then remarks (Heytesbury [H-OI]: 45, emphasis added):\n\n\nMany objections of this sort can be raised against this view, which it\nwould be difficult or impossible to answer to complete\nsatisfaction.\n\n\nAgain, about his own view he says (p. 21, emphasis added):\n\n\nI do not claim that it or any [opinion] is altogether satisfactory,\nbecause I do not see that this is possible. Nevertheless I\nrate this one among all of them to be nearer the truth.\n\n\nRichard Lavenham, an English contemporary of Wyclif, perhaps put the\nprevailing optimism best (Spade 1975: 93; Heytesbury [H-OI]: 8):\n\n\nJust as the bond of love is sometimes called insoluble, not because it\ncan in no way be untied (sit solubilis) but because it can be\nuntied [only] with difficulty, so a proposition is sometimes called\ninsoluble, not because it is not solvable but because it is solvable\n[only] with difficulty.\n\n",
