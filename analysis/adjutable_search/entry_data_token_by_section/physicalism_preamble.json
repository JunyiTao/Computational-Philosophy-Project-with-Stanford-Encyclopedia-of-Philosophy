    "main_text": "\n\nPhysicalism is, in slogan form, the thesis that everything is physical.\nThe thesis is usually intended as a metaphysical thesis, parallel to\nthe thesis attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Thales, that\neverything is water, or the idealism of the 18th Century philosopher\nBerkeley, that everything is mental. The general idea is that the\nnature of the actual world (i.e. the universe and everything in it)\nconforms to a certain condition, the condition of being physical. Of\ncourse, physicalists don\u2019t deny that the world might contain\nmany items that at first glance don\u2019t seem physical \u2014\nitems of a biological, or psychological, or moral, or social, or\nmathematical nature. But they insist nevertheless that at the end of\nthe day such items are physical, or at least bear an important\nrelation to the physical.\n",
