Yet, Descartes\u2019\nversion of the problem, more than any other, has left its mark on the\nphilosophical discussion.\n\nEarlier versions tended to touch upon dreams just briefly and discuss\nthem alongside other examples of sensory deception. For example, in\nthe Theaetetus (157e), Plato has Socrates discuss a defect in\nperception that is common to\n\n\ndreams and diseases, including insanity, and everything else that is\nsaid to cause illusions of sight and hearing and the other senses.\n\n\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that knowledge cannot be defined through\nperception. \n\nDreams also appear in the canon of standard skeptical arguments used\nby the Pyrrhonists. Again, dreams and sleep are just one of several\nconditions (including illness, joy, and sorrow) that cast doubt on the\ntrusthworthiness of sensory perception (Diogenes Laertius, Lives\nof Eminent Philosophers; Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of\nPyrrhonism).\n\nAugustine (Against the Academics; Confessions)\nthought the dream problem could be contained, arguing that in\nretrospect, we can distinguish both dreams and illusions from actual\nperception (Matthew 2005: chapter 8). And Montaigne (The Apology\nfor Raymond Sebond) noted that wakefulness itself teems with\nreveries and illusions, which he thought were even more\nepistemologically worrisome than nocturnal dreams.\n\nDescartes devoted much more space to the discussion of dreaming and\ncast it as a unique epistemological threat distinct from both waking\nillusions and evil genius or brain-in-a-vat-style arguments. His claim\nthat he has often been deceived by his dreams implies he also saw\ndreaming as a real-world (rather than merely hypothetical) threat.\n\n\nThis is further highlighted by the intimate, first-person style of the\n Meditations. Their narrator is supposed to exemplify\neveryone\u2019s epistemic situation, illustrating the typical defects of\nthe human mind. Readers are further drawn in by Descartes\u2019 strategy of\nmoving from commonsense examples towards more sophisticated\nphilosophical claims (Frankfurt 1970). For example, Descartes builds\nup towards dream skepticism by first considering familiar cases of\nsensory illusions and then deceptively realistic dreams.\n\nFinally, much attention has been devoted to several dreams Descartes\nreportedly had as a young man. Some believe these dreams embodied\ntheoretical doubts he developed in the Discourse and\nMeditations (Baillet 1691; Leibniz 1880: IV; Cole 1992;\nKeefer 1996). Hacking (2001:252) suggests that for Descartes, dream\nskepticism was not just a philosophical conundrum but a source of\ngenuine doubt. There is also some discussion about the dream reports\u2019\nauthenticity (Freud 1940; Cole 1992; Clarke 2006; Browne 1977).\n",
